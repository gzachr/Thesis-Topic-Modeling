hello again welcome back to the channel
my name is shay
today we're going to be checking out a
video called 10 things filipino fears
between dating a foreigner by the
filipina p i know what you're thinking
this is kind of a bit of a random video
to react to but when you really think
about what channel you're on right now
is it really that random
i don't think so i'm kind of just out of
curiosity
um
it's really the only reason why i'm
reacting to this video i am curious as
to what these 10 things are and if i can
somehow require this knowledge and apply
it to
future
life decisions then i feel like that is
a win-win in our books we get the
content we get the knowledge and we get
the girlfriend
on a serious note i thought this might
make for a good video i feel like i've
got a few things i could say about this
although it's from uh for the penis
point of view there is actually
another video that is 10 things foreign
which i definitely want to watch so i
don't know we might make this a
back-to-back recording but yes play the
video shout out to the for the pena p
this is the first time i've come across
this channel because we're reacting to a
video she obviously deserves a shout out
so hopefully it's okay reacting to this
video if not
well that's life isn't it
okay
i literally saw using my recommendations
one day
so hi folks the filipina p here telling
it like it is hello well it's time for
some serious truth bombs today but this
time i'm gonna drop him on myself and
all my filipina sisters
she sounds slightly american or
criticism but as an honest look at our
darkest fears when it comes to
relationships filipino americans once
again
i'm gonna go where other channels don't
filipinos discussing a perspective you
probably won't hear anywhere else
thanks to my actually being a filipina
and also one who's willing to discuss
the subject
some of these fears are grounded in
reality some in fiction some are funny
very well universal and unsolvable but
these are the things we worry about and
obsess over so if you want an inside
look
does that keep us up at night i need
some help here goes
first let me explain a cultural
situation here that's really at the
heart of the matter oh yes you have to
understand what it's like to grow up as
a filipina with your friends family
parents and the church all telling you
that your primary goal is to marry and
reproduce
the mantra of married with children
married with children is enough to give
al bundy a migraine but it's pounded
into our heads from birth and becomes
the bedrock of a filipina's identity
it also explains the reason why so many
of us filipinas already have quite a
past when you meet us
even at a very young age
sometimes we've already had a husband a
child or two and we seem almost
desperate to settle down before the
music stops and there's no more chairs
available
what's difficult for some foreigners to
understand is that despite how slow
everything else is here
the life cycle of the filipina is
actually sped up to such a degree that
if we reach the age of 30 without having
a husband and at least one child were
considered past our expiration date by
saying what
in fact
but we even get labeled as leftovers if
we find ourselves in that position
yep
left over
while many western women are still
completing their education into their
mid-20s and beyond and haven't even
seriously considered having children yet
they're already at an age that creates
panic in many filipinas who see their
chances slipping away fast
that may explain why even nice girls
from the province may already have a
child and a few ex-boyfriends by the
time you meet them it's time to make
sense chatting with an innocent sounding
filipina
and in your mind you imagine that they
must spend every sunday kneeling in
church but when you discover the reality
of their situation
it becomes obvious that they've been
kneeling in other places as well oh my
god this is nothing happens
their boyfriend or husband has left a
human and they see their prospects as
dismal at best
then suddenly you pop onto the scene
full of hope and promise
so why should a filipina be scared of
that
what's to be afraid of
well
leave it to us to bury ourselves under a
mountain of worries
some very real and some just plain silly
so let's dive right into that black hole
shall we
our past
ever wonder why getting us to talk about
our past is like pulling teeth everyone
is a possibility first in our culture
people just don't discuss those things
filipino men rarely ask their partners
about past relationships and there's a
don't ask don't tell policy in effect
here it's almost like a game we play
they like to assume we're all virgins
even with a child in our arms
then you guys come along and bluntly ask
us things about our past and our first
reaction is to duck and cover because
this is obviously let me stop this this
is obviously from her point of view so
she's speaking from her experiences i
don't know how much we can really take
from this video but it's interesting
none of this we have a real fear of
discussing our past because it bears all
our mistakes for you to see
and that's just not the asian way of
saving face
it's one of the reasons why we often
deny having children when in fact we've
sent them to live with a relative and a
lot of other deceptions we're guilty of
what we may have debts you're not aware
of and you have more chance of
single-handedly raising the titanic than
of getting us to tell you our actual
notch count
we feel like we need to be perfect for
you or you'll reject us
especially with all the other options
available to you
the physical fears
unlike western women who often receive
plenty of male attention despite
physical issues like extra weight or
unfortunate piercings we filipinos think
that one little flaw could be the
difference between landing a good guy or
getting disguise for everyone there the
supply statement
is that tough here and we know it it's
so tough in fact that little things
you'd never even notice can destroy our
confidence right when we need it the
most
for instance filipinas have a thing
about armpits we think that ours are
ugly because sometimes they have dark
lines and chicken skin instead of the
smooth underarms of western women
it can bother us so much that we'll keep
our arms clean i need to read the
comments afterwards even when greeting
you for the first time at the airport
hello
no i know that's not something oh my god
i don't think i've ever heard a
foreigner say
oh man i had to dump her did you see
those pits
she'd have to wear long sleeve before
i'd tap
that but for whatever reason
a guy with an underarm fetish is a
filipina's kryptonite
unfortunately
dental work isn't high on the priority
list here and many of us have too many
cavities or crooked teeth that are badly
in need of orthodontics
you'll notice that a lot of filipinas
get braces as an adult when they can
finally afford them it's actually a
status symbol here
but many of us simply can't shell out 80
000 pesos necessary to correct the
problem
as a result
you'll often encounter filipinos who've
seen enough tv to believe that every
western woman has an endless role of
bright white teeth which makes us a lot
less likely to smile or even talk
strangely i can understand the whole one
thing that we can easily do something
about is what many of us ignore
while being among the most feminine
looking women on earth
many filipinas seem oblivious to their
thick lustrous flowing hair
on the upper lip
if a philippine is interested in dating
a foreigner it would be prudent to put
away that obsession with armpits and
pull out a waxing strip instead
we don't need you guys coming up with
more slogans like if there's hair on the
lip i'll give her the slip i mean these
are easy fixes though like you have
around them anyone can fix these
issues i don't think it's the imaginary
people this is
that we're inadequate in bed
even if we'd had our fair share of
sexual encounters i wouldn't know
filipinos imagine all sorts of exotic
tricks and talents that western women
must know that we're not privy to
we think of our own past encounters as
being clumsy and brief which they often
are
and fear that you guys expect more
exotic shenanigans in the bedroom
involving whipped cream and swinging
from chandeliers i think all guys are
like that though maybe not real guys
jesus in reality not speaking from some
experiences
who end of things with a filipina
because of her lack of experience
then
there's the concern about our language
skills
even though we probably know a lot more
english than you know tagalog instead of
being proud of our multilingual
abilities we feel awkward and
incompetent
we're afraid of being judged by you
so instead of trying to communicate
sometimes we just sit there in silence
we're happy to have you order something
for us in the restaurant so we don't
have to try pronouncing the menu items
and all of us have learned the same way
whatever you want
in order to minimize our need to speak
or share an opinion
relationship fears
we filipinas are often afraid that we
don't measure up to the other women of
the world that you might have had
relationships with
sexy adventures sophisticated women
things like that gracefully you know
it'll screw you up entertain wealthy
guests at cocktail parties after coming
home from their pilates classes
thanks to the images we've been exposed
to
we have a distorted view of what it
means to be a western woman
even if it's far from the truth
you think of us one way we see ourselves
another way
but reality is irrelevant it's all
perception
sometimes beauty is receiving ourselves
as inferior because our life experiences
are so limited
so what are we really truly terrified of
that will give you the best remaining
years of our youth and beauty and our
devotion to you
and you'll end up leaving us
it's happened already to many of us
the men that say they love us one day
are gone the next
sometimes leaving us with children to
make future searches for a mate even
more improbable
it's a reality here so we expect it
we wait for it and all the while our
clocks are ticking at a frantic pace
because of the expectations of our
culture
unfortunately to come with the
possibility of being abandoned some
filipinas adopt an offensive strategy of
i'll get them before they get me and use
the same tactics in reverse
playing men against each other and
jumping from one ship to the next
leaving them on fire and sinking with
little care or remorse
but much of that despicable behavior is
based in fear
fear of being rejected or replaced
and while you might say i wonder how
much of this is actually
let me explain how it really is
different
because foreigners hold most of the
cards here
i'll make my last point and use an
analogy to do it filipinos see the
dating scene here in the philippines
like a giant car dealership with an
endless lot of different makes and
models
all of them for free
there are ferraris and ford pintos
brand new ones and old rusty ones that
barely run and even if you have
virtually no money it seems like all you
foreigners have to do is pick the one
you want
i don't know
we're a lamborghini we're eventually
gonna get some dings and scratches
and we know that every week
a whole new shipment of brand new cars
gets delivered to that lot right down
the street and all you have to do is
leave us by the side of the road and go
pick out another one and that's a sad
way to think about it sounds really
harsh and you may not see it that way at
all
but remember what i said about reality
and perception
and in this case
it's the perception that as we age
there's always going to be a shinier new
model to catch your eye
and nothing much stopping you from
making a switch
all these gnawing insecurities keep us
filipinos asking ourselves the question
why would he still want me
well
hopefully the answer is true love
and if you believe in it
and are lucky enough to find it
then maybe you'll be able to put all
those fears and insecurities into a
little bottle
and toss it into the sea of forgotten
thoughts
until you notice those crow's feet
wrinkles and how's my armpits
i was thinking if i just got laser
treatments maybe those lines would
disappear and i could raise my arms hey
this is a quality concept okay there's
one more fear that i've saved for less
because it's a little personal and
that's breast size
nothing strikes fear into the hearts of
some women more than worrying about how
their chest measures up and it looks
like mother nature has abandoned the
filipina
according to dailymail.co and world
data.info
filipinas have the smallest chest on the
planet well western women americans in
particular have the largest
once again i'm going to use my computer
to show you the actual data
now obviously not all filipinos are the
same size it's always a bell curve like
this
i can't believe what i'm watching right
now
so the average filipina has an a
cup size
the bell curve for western women is
substantially different
with this
what the average of full d cup size
as you can see
oh come on guys i swear i can't take you
anywhere
that's great
oh there's another part just one last
thing
if you think about it i'm kind of like
your bartender listening to your
comments and questions giving you advice
when i can and brewing up some
intoxication what are we drinking this
evening for your enjoyment the only
thing i ask in return is a small tip in
the form of a thumbs up on this video
subscribing to my channel
get a reaction thumbs up and hitting the
notification bell so you know when your
next round that's a solid video i think
i've learned a few things from that
it'll only take 10 grand
a lot of this is from her perspective
maybe from her friends as well you
wouldn't want to shaft your bartender
would you
and for last call
why not enjoy some of my other videos
too
see you real soon
because i didn't really do much research
on this creator
so i don't know if this is a filipina in
the philippines or a filipina living
overseas somewhere because she sounds
like she's got an american accent accent
accent yeah i don't know i don't know
how to take that video some of the
things i was aware of obviously but some
of them also apply to
everyone especially with the whole
appearance if you're aware of something
that you're not happy with you're going
to focus in on that one little thing and
think that that's going to
turn someone off or that someone's not
going to be interested in you because of
that one little thing that usually the
small things people don't even notice
that's something that i've noticed
especially about myself there was a
great variety of humor experience and
presentation that was a solid video and
i think this sort of video helps people
especially foreigners that are going to
the philippines and hopefully finding a
potential partner one day to be aware of
these things especially when two
different cultures collide i know there
are many foreigners that go over there
specifically to find a partner either
because that's their preference or they
just want out of their current life
maybe they're not into whatever
lifestyle that they've just come from
and by me reacting to this video i'm not
saying that i'm looking for the pina
girlfriend maybe once upon a time i was
leaning more towards that direction i'm
guessing this was more geared towards
for the penis in the front of the paint
and not for the penis worldwide yeah
that's all i'm gonna say on this video i
don't know if this is even
worth watching uh this reaction video
hope you guys enjoyed the video and
see you guys
in the next one
