[Laughter]
he just
flexed on them
[Music]
and after having reacted to everything
reyes says reyes's
amazing z shot video
you guys uh sent me a bunch of messages
with other videos of mr efren
reyes who apparently is a legend
and yes because he is the winner of like
70 international titles which is
insane um the title of this video
is efrain yes
super shots compilation eight ball nine
ball
pool i think this one might even be more
interesting and
in that video i mentioned that i saw
crazy shots you know where people like
would lift the ball and all
and some of you told me that he did that
stuff even though
he wasn't the biggest fan of that
technique you know
apparently he is a smooth uh player he
prefers
other techniques but before we start
please consider follow me on instagram
at music
a game news and without further ado
and let's get to it
wow
let's go
oh boy did he kick that in
[Applause]
[Music]
wow
boy bingo
all right
[Applause]
appreciate you taking time i know you're
really busy uh here at the event i
really appreciate you taking time to
stop by
and share with us a little bit about the
tournament
thank you very much for having me right
here see there i wonder if he would have
been
able to put both balls in at the same
time
oh
i love it because he used the table to
help himself
[Music]
oh [ __ ]
and just so you know i'm not a pro at uh
billiard or pool okay
i just enjoy the sport i'm calling it a
sport i know you're not running and
jumping
but it still qualifies as a sport i
think
and i'm not like the biggest fan of it i
just really enjoy
playing pool
and i actually get competitive when i
play pool
no
yeah that is insane i really wonder if
he actually
caught that one come on man
that's crazy
[Music]
get out of here get out of here get
[Applause]
yes
oh it's the z shot it's the z
shot
yeah man in the side
and try to avoid the uh
the striped one he's two rail banking at
raw
you kidding me
[Applause]
what is he gonna do
i mean seriously seriously would you
have
thought that you could actually put that
ball
in that hole i mean the position of that
ball you would not
try to put it in that hole like no no
no no no no no
maybe you could have done like a v shot
i don't know if you can call it a v
shot but basically do this you know
[Applause]
okay so he told them where he's gonna
put it right there
right yeah here
oh
he just flexed on them
no okay right now he's just playing with
them he's toying with them
any you know basic player i guess
would never try to make it fancy like
that
he would shoot it straight into that
hole
[Applause]
dude
you know at the beginning of the video
like the first few
uh you know snippets of his shots that
they showed i was a little bit
underwhelmed i was like really
but now these are getting so interesting
the intensity is getting bigger
difficulty is getting bigger
farewell tour exploding he's gonna do
another
one oh
he's like a lovable old man now and did
you see
how he avoided the weight ball
oh wow
that is crazy
all right oh come on no no i refuse
i refuse okay like seriously a normal
person
a normal person that's competing and
wants to win
it'd be like all right i put it in the
uh top left corner when you see it from
the perspective of
efren right top left corner easy peasy
bum bum in
i'm pretty sure that here he's gonna try
to
to to put it in another hole i mean look
how close the ball is to that hole right
let's see
no no see he said he's gonna put it in
the bottom left
corner hole i think
no no no no no no no no efren be nice
what
[Applause]
i'm sorry that was magic i have to see
this again
i have to see this again
holy
[Applause]
wow
[Applause]
wow that's
the mark of a legendary player
it's someone who can predict who can put
the ball
wherever he wants oh my god
there it jumped
this one is epic i'm sorry this shot
is epic
i'm sorry but that last shot was just
insane
in say wow wow
wow wow as much as i enjoyed the z
shot video this is better because you
get different scenarios different
tricks you know and you can really see
his talent
on display here wow okay now it is your
turn to tell me which
is your favorite shot i told you which
one is mine all right
it's the uh it's it's i have two it's
the last one you know the
and the one where it was obvious that he
could put it in
it's the one where the the ball was put
like in
in the middle of the table but upwards
and then he hit it anyway i can't
describe this it's too complicated to
describe you know
