It's good.
Are you looking for a veggie ball recipe
that's filled with veggies and
tastes good?
You don't call them veggie balls!
What's it called then? Vegetable ball?
That doesn't sound good,
it kind of sounds vulgar.
So guys, I have 2 options for you.
And not only that,
but I also have 2 kinds of
manong sauce.
It's so delicious!
One more,
I'll just double dip.
Welcome to Panlasang Pinoy!
Let's make 2 kinds of veggie balls.
I didn't say vegetable ball.
And let's pair it with 2 kinds of manong sauces.
The sweet and spicy sauce
and the spicy vinegar one.
These are the ingredients that we'll be using
for our recipes.
If you're ready, let's cook this.
Let's start making the manong sauce first,
the sweet and spicy one.
This'll be easy.
I just boil some water
and add in a star anise.
Just 1,
don't overdo it since the flavor might overpower.
And here is our Knorr Liquid Seasoning.
Once these ingredients are added,
I'll add in the sugar.
I'm using brown sugar.
The more brown, the better
since light brown sugar exists.
It doesn't say there that it's slightly light,
it just says light brown.
Very brown sugar is better.
And then I add in pepper,
garlic powder,
and we'll also add onion powder.
Once these ingredients are added,
I'll just fetch some chilis
since we're making it sweet and spicy.
When it comes to the chilis,
I just chop these.
I made some bigger slices
but if you want to maximize the spiciness,
slice them into smaller pieces.
If you put those in your mixture,
the spiciness will stick right away.
I'll just season this
and add in salt.
You can put in ground black pepper if you want.
Let's mix it well.
And I cook this for 2 minutes
so we can get the flavor of the star anise.
This is okay,
let's just let the sauce thicken.
This is what you call a slurry.
Of course, you already know this.
It's just cornstarch and water.
The important bit is to mix it well.
The cornstarch has to be diluted
and then I add the mixture in little by little.
Let's not pour all of the slurry in
so we can gauge the consistency
or the thickness of our sauce.
Which is why I do it slowly.
Let's put in half.
After that half,
if you think it needs more,
you can finish it.
And you saw that, right?
I took out the star anise
because if you don't,
you might eat it accidentally.
It tasted weird if you bite into it whole.
Our sauce is good.
Up next is our spicy vinegar sauce.
I'm just cutting some Thai chili peppers
since this sauce should be spicy.
And let's combine it with onions.
I'm using yellow onions
and I chop these into the right size
because some of us like it very fine.
If you dip it in that,
the onions come with.
If you're into that,
feel free to cut it into smaller pieces.
And here's the garlic,
I just use a garlic press for this so it's quicker.
Although if you don't have a garlic press,
it's okay.
Let's slice the garlic very finely
or just crush it.
It'll still depend on you
if you want the taste to be garlicky or not.
And then I season this with pepper
and salt.
I want the flavor of the dipping sauce
to be savory,
not just sour and spicy.
Which is why I add Knorr Liquid Seasoning,
the chili kind.
So it's also spicy.
Savory and spicy.
And we'll add a little soy sauce.
Actually guys, this soy sauce is for the color.
Although it'll give the dish a little flavor.
And after that, I'll sweeten it a bit
so I add in sugar.
And here's the vinegar,
you can use distilled vinegar
like what I'm using,
or white vinegar.
Let's just mix this well.
Guys, if you want the ingredients to be more flavorful,
you can microwave this for at least 1 minute
and then let it cool down
or just mix it like this.
It's ready.
So now,
let's make our veggie balls.
We'll make 2 kinds.
Here is our veggie ball number 1.
Let's add in a lot of vegetables.
I added in the all-purpose flour
and cornstarch.
And here's the baking powder.
When it comes to the baking powder,
follow what the recipe says.
Don't over do it or else it'll turn out bitter.
I also added onion powder,
garlic powder, and ground black pepper.
I mix all of these thouroughly.
Let me remind you.
When it comes to the recipe,
just visit panlasangpinoy.com
and you'll see all of the details there.
Let's add the water here
but I don't add everything.
I only use a third of this
and then I mix it slowly.
And I only add water little by little
and then mix until everything is in
and until the mixture becomes smooth.
And once the mixture is okay like this,
we can add the other ingredients.
Knorr Liquid Seasoning,
I use the original kind.
This will give it the savory flavor
and let's add more pepper
and salt.
So guys,
the ingredients we're adding
are the components for a basic
yet flavorful batter mixture.
Once we cook this,
it already has flavor.
But because we're making veggie balls,
we still need vegetable components.
And not just any vegetables,
let's add as many as we can.
I have some butternut squash here.
It looks a bit different, right?
It tastes a bit sweet.
Let's prepare this first.
I just take out the seeds
by scraping them out,
just make sure they're taken out properly.
Even the cobweb-like stuff inside,
let's take them out.
And then we can peel them after,
this is the easiest step because of our vegetable peeler.
And here is our next vegetable,
a carrot.
It's too big
so I'll only use half.
When it comes to the carrot,
we'll do the same thing.
I just do prep by peeling it
and then I shred both of these vegetables.
If you're feeling diligent,
you can manually chop or mince this
by slicing them into thin pieces.
But if you're in a rush,
a vegetable shredder will help you.
Although I know this won't be a perfect ball shape
figure later because of the long components we used.
When it comes to the taste,
it's still good.
So let's combine all the vegetables in this bowl.
Let's shred this carrot next.
You can also use a food processor
if you don't feel like manually shredding this.
It'll come out more fine.
Once we've shredded the carrot,
let's combine it with the butternut squash.
Now, I'll get the chives
or the green onions
and I chop this.
If you don't have green onions available,
you can use regular onions.
The taste of this is important for our veggie balls.
Let's combine everything in the bowl.
We're still going to add another vegetable later.
Let's get our mixture and combine everything.
When it comes to the veggie ball,
besides the vegetables I used,
do you use any other vegetables?
What's your suggestion?
Can we add something else to this?
So I just mixed this thoroughly
and add in some green peas.
I'm using frozen green peas that I thawed.
You can also use canned guisantes
as long as you drain the liquid it comes with.
And then mix it well.
I'll heat up the oil.
The more oil, the better.
And since we made a lot of our mixture,
let's cook this by batch.
I want to try something new.
I bought this online
since I watched it from Tiktok.
I don't know if this'll work here
but I know this works with other kinds of mixtures.
Let's try it.
I'll just add the veggie balls here since they turned out long
because theyr'e shredded.
I have a feeling that it won't become perfect balls,
so here they are.
It looks like I'm right,
I feel like it'll look like an alien.
Let's see.
So here they are.
Uh oh, they all stuck together.
But it's okay, you can separate them.
It looks like okoy,
okoy balls.
But it's okay,
at least we got to separate them.
I just cooked this
until it became golden brown.
You'll notice it's cooked if it floats.
So it looks like the tool I bought
isn't for this mixture.
I'll use it next time for other mixtures.
But for the meantime,
let's make it traditionally.
This is what you call the 2 spoons method, okay?
I'll show you why it's called 2 spoons.
So what we'll be doing is
we scoop from the mixture
and then we switch it from spoon to spoon.
And we put it straight into the oil.
This method won't make them stick together,
just don't make them stick deliberately.
And then we continue to fry this
just like what we did earlier.
I'm sure you'll ask me
if you can do this in advanced
which means you'll do it now then cook it tomorrow.
And then put it in the refrigerator.
Of course you expect me to say yes.
I'm gonna have to say no.
I'll answer that later but for now,
let me taste this, I've been craving since earlier.
It looks fine, right? Even if it looks like okoy.
It's so delicious!
One more.
The taste is good,
I'll dip it in later.
Going back to that question earlier,
the reason why I don't recommend
preparing this a day in advance
and cooling it in the fridge
is because of the baking powder.
Baking power reacts instantly with water
if you mix it with liquids.
So it means it'll release gas right away.
If we use this the day after,
we'll lose the effect of the baking powder.
Although the taste will be the same delicious flavor.
The only difference is it won't rise
like how we want it to.
So I strongly suggest that if you're doing this,
cook it right away.
So there.
Our veggie balls are good
as you can see.
It still looks nice even though it resembles okoy.
I just moved this to a plate
and combined everything.
I laid out a paper towel
so it absorbs the oil
or you can set it on a wire rack
so the oil drips down.
So we're on veggie ball number 2.
We're going to boil this,
why you say?
Because I use eggplants here.
This is what I did to the eggplants.
I first peeled these.
Most of the time,
if we want to cook and peel the eggplants,
we grill these
or we burn off the peel in an open flame.
This is the alternative method,
some of you might like this better.
So I peeled the eggplants,
and then I boil these until they soften.
Of course I cut these in half so it fits my pan.
It's just simple
and it doesn't emit smoke.
You don't even need to grill it or
play directly with fire.
I said the wrong thing,
it's bad to play with fire
so don't do that!
Let's just put the eggplant directly in fire, okay?
And once this is done,
it's okay.
You'll notice it still has water.
I'll take out the stem first.
I should've taken them out earlier
before I boiled it.
And
the water you see in the bowl,
throw it away.
We want to remove all the water
as much as possible.
And let's get a fork,
we're about to assemble our talong bola-bola.
It's like tortang talong that we made into balls.
I'll be adding in yellow onions.
And we just do the same.
I just chop these,
if you want these smaller,
I recommend you do that.
The smaller, the better.
And here's the garlic,
I'm using fresh garlic
that I press.
You can use garlic powder if you want.
Let's just mix this well
and I add in Knorr Liquid Seasoning with chili.
So it's a little spicy.
We'll also add pepper
and salt.
Let's just mix these ingredients well.
And once this is mixed,
we'll add the egg.
Just one,
this will act as our binder.
Once the egg is added,
I'll also add cornstarch
and all-purpose flour.
Once the flour is added,
we'll just mix this well.
Let's not go overboard with the flour,
just follow the amount in the recipe.
If we add more, this'll turn out more dense.
We want the texture to be just right.
This mixture is okay already.
This is almost ready to cook.
But wait,
we'll still add a coating to this.
I use panko bread crumbs,
these are Japanese bread crumbs.
You can use regular bread crumbs
or if they're not available,
just regular flour will do.
Just add the flour
like how I added the bread crumbs from the bowl.
And then, we'll just shake this
and coat our bola-bola mixture.
I think I got too big of a scoop,
let's make it smaller next time.
I'll add a little first
then we roll the mixture.
Let's position them next to each other.
There, this is perfect.
So we'll use this much.
Once we've rolled
all of our mixture in the bread crumbs
and finished coating them,
we can now fry these.
We'll use the same oil we cooked with earlier.
When it comes to the heat setting,
I use low to medium heat.
We can also lower this if needed.
We don't want to bring up the flame
because if we did,
the bread crumbs will cook right away.
You'll see it turn brown
but it's only the outside that's cooked.
The heat should penetrate the middle.
So we only need a weak flame
and cook it slowly until it turns brown.
And since the oil we used earlier isn't that much,
we need to flip our talong balls
so the other side cooks.
And once this turns golden brown like this,
it's good.
We'll just move this to a plate with a paper towel
so the excess oil gets absorbed.
Let's serve this.
This is perfect for a snack.
Actually, these talong balls aren't just for snacks.
I personally eat these as a meal.
You'll know later what sauce is the best for this,
one that pairs really well
according to my preference.
Guys, this is ready.
I'll just put this on a serving plate
with our veggie ball number 1.
And here is our veggie balls.
Veggie ball 1 that looks like okoy,
okoy balls.
And our talong balls.
And here are our sauces.
Here is the spicy vinegar dipping sauce
and our sweet and spicy sauce
manong dipping sauce.
Let's taste it!
I just got a stick for our veggie balls.
You see here
that you have 2 veggie balls to choose from.
The 1st has different kinds of vegetables,
the 2nd
is just like tortang talong that we turned into
veggie bola-bola.
Actually I tried this earlier,
you saw me steal a bite.
I'll just taste it again
along with our manong sauce.
Let's start with the vinegar.
It's good.
It's spicy but
our veggie balls are so flavorful.
It just looks like okoy.
You can call these okoy balls
since I didn't cut the veggies into small pieces,
I just shredded them.
But if I cut these smaller,
you won't see it popping up like that.
Let's try our next manong sauce.
It's so delicious!
So this is the same sweet and spicy sauce
that comes with the fishball or squidballs we buy.
It's good!
Which is why I want to eat this sauce
with our talong veggie balls.
Let's try the vinegar with our talong balls.
So far guys,
i'll be honest with you,
this is the sauce I like between the 2.
Here.
It's good.
I think
I can eat our talong balls with rice
and dip it in vinegar.
The flavor is good.
Veggie ball.
I remember this from my childhood in the Philippines.
During those times, fishballs were trending
and also squid balls.
But squid balls were a bit expensive
so you'll get sick of eating fish balls often.
The other option were veggie balls.
It's like a big mixture they fry,
that one was cheaper.
It's a win.
If you're avoiding meat,
this is perfect for you.
Which of the 2 do you think is more delicious?
Is it the the one I'm holding right now or-
Let's just get both.
Or the 2nd one, the talong balls.
Let's not double dip.
I'm tempted to dip this,
no one will see me anyway.
Do you also double dip?
Wow!
Here are our 2 versions of veggie balls
with matching manong sauces.
Let's eat!
