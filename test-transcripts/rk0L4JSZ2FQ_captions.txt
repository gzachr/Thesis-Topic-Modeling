(Useful travel tips)
(Lee Hwijae, San E)
Traveling is a war! Battle Trip!
So hot, so hot...
It was so hot...
- Now the cool wind's blowing. / - Right.
- It's Chuseok next week. / - Already?
- It's already Chuseok. / - Already.
- Time really flies. / - Right.
That's why on Battle Trip...
- We had Kim Minkyo. / - Right.
- We had Lee Jaehoon. / - Yes.
They didn't just travel a lot to their destinations.
- It was their second home. / - Right.
Think about it.
If someone lived at a destination...
- You can't beat them. / -  Right.
- That's what it's like. / - Today?
- Locals. / - Today.
This is a big match.
- Ho Chi Minh against Manila. / - Yes.
You'll regret it if you miss today's show.
Today's travel planners...
- We have 4 people! / - I'm confident.
- Let's bring them out! / - Come out.
(Who is it?)
Gosh.
- High-five. / - Hello.
You look so dirty.
She's really tall.
- Hello. / - Wow.
Could you turn the lights on over here?
Why is it so dark?
It's not dark.
Has their make up been done a tone darker?
We've been used as props to make
Sandara Park's team stand out.
- No way. / - Don't say that.
- Sandara lived there for a long time. / - Yes.
I lived there for over 10 years.
Please introduce yourself in the local language.
We've lost.
- That's so different. / - We've lost.
Jo Seungyeon speaks 6 languages.
- That's right! / - 6 languages.
I can't speak Vietnamese.
They speak French in Vietnam.
To tell the truth, Taehoon...
- He said Vietnam's his second home. / - Right.
But he doesn't speak Vietnamese.
We're a team, right?
I heard this, Sandara.
You're a huge fan of Battle Trip.
- Really? / - Yes.
I'm not lying.
- I've seen every episode. / - Right.
I got really mad watching the show.
I lived abroad!
- For over 10 years. / - 10 years?
I called right away.
The director immediately said okay.
Of course he said okay.
- Sandara lived there for 10 years. / - Yes.
- Why's Vietnam your second home? / - I know.
The reason...
When I was in my third year at university,
my father went on a trip to Vietnam.
- He came back after a week. / - Right.
He immediately packed a huge suitcase.
- He told me this. / - What?
"You're the head of our family now."
Then he left for Vietnam.
- Is this a true story? / - Yes.
He lives there until this very day.
He was impressed that he went to live there.
My little brother came after studying in the U.S.
- My father told him to come to Vietnam. / - Okay.
He's been living there for the past 15 years.
That's what it's like there?
Around 10 years ago, my little sister...
She went there to meet my father and brother.
- Again? / - She's been living there for 10 years.
That's what Vietnam's like!
- Of course we have to go there! / - It's dangerous.
- Wait. / - If you walk around there...
If you mention my father's name,
1 out of every 2 Koreans knows my father.
- Is he that famous? / - The writer came with us.
They asked around to prepare for the shoot.
Everyone knew my father.
- That's what the writer told me. / - Really?
The locals there.
As long as the footage is good...
- I'm sure we can win. / - This is the best!
We're not as good with words.
They could sell this as gold.
- Please help us. / - Yes.
I've always been curious about this.
Sandara, were you born in the Philippines?
No. I went there in elementary school.
- Yes. / - In elementary school?
- I went there. / - You're totally Korean.
I spent my teenage years there.
- Abroad? / - You lived there for a long time.
Were you treated well there?
Before we left, Sandara said that
she's a princess in the Philippines.
- Whatever. / - She told you that herself?
She said she's the princess of the Philippines.
- In fact... / - It's true?
You'll realize once you seen the video.
- The Dara Tour. / - The name's really pretty.
We've prepared the V-neck Tour.
What?
You look good together.
- We're not going to lose. / - Right.
- Yes. / - They wore couple t-shirts.
From the photo...
It doesn't look like we went traveling to Vietnam.
We look like Vietnamese who came to Korea to film.
Okay then.
We need to introduce today's 100 judges.
Welcome!
- Welcome. / - Please judge objectively.
This week's destinations
are the 2 top tourist destinations in South-East Asia.
The Philippines vs. Vietnam.
Is there something to watch out for?
One of the reasons why I wanted to
introduce the Philippines on Battle Trip...
People usually ask me this about the Philippines.
Isn't it dangerous? I hear public safety's poor.
They always ask me that.
It's just that unfortunate incidents
are shown in the news.
I wanted to show that
it's not dangerous at all.
I prepared both a beginner's and...
- Intermediate course. / - Beginner, intermediate?
For women.
What should we watch out for?
I think viewers should take
a different approach to traveling.
When it comes to traveling,
according to how well you know the district,
how much you know about the culture,
your trip can be totally different.
You don't just enjoy the scenery.
You enjoy everything that the country offers.
Compared to before your trip,
once you return,
you'll realized that you've matured.
- That's our trip. / - Let's not watch the video.
Let's just vote.
They've all been won over.
- The more you know, the more fun. / - Right.
Your knowledge creates the fun.
What do you do when you go traveling?
You usually view cultural assets.
To view the asset, you listen to audio guides...
- Or you read a book. It's bothersome. / - You read.
If you watch our video...
- You don't need to do that. / - We...
- We do everything. / - We keep talking.
- 24 hours a day./ -  A living docent.
- That's a real trip. / - Docent.
I'm really looking forward to this, Taehoon.
Let's view the first half now.
How do I say that in the local language?
Let's view it!
That's difficult.
Surprise. Hello.
I'm going on the Dara Tour today.
I'm princess Dara of the Philippines.
Princess of the Philippines.
I've watched all of Battle Trip.
It's fun. It's enjoyable and...
It made me want to compete.
I got up while watching it.
I want to be on that show!
I can do an even better job.
Kim Minkyo who went to Pattaya 27 times...
Lee Jaehoon who went to Saipan 30 times...
I'm sorry.
I lived in the Philippines for over 10 years.
I have 2 years' experience as a tour guide.
I'm Sandara, princess of the Philippines.
(Sandara Park debuted in the Philippines)
(The Philippines is still crazy over Sandara)
(Native who speaks 2 languages)
I can order without a menu because
I've been here so many times.
(The best travel planner ever)
I made a deal. 250 peso.
You can't beat people who've lived there.
This is too strong.
- The Dara Tour. / - Yes.
I've been on your tour before.
Sandara takes her close friends
on the Dara Tour.
I went once.
When we walk around, everyone recognizes her.
If you want to say hi in Filipino,
you could just say, "Sandara."
Everyone does this. "Oh! Sandara!"
(She's active on Filipino TV and commercials)
In the case of the Philippines,
the country's made up of 7,107 islands.
There's so much to see.
There are so many islands.
For first-time travelers,
there's the beginner and intermediate course.
For first-time travelers,
I think it'd be good to show Manila.
The Garosugil of Manila...
Manila has a street like that?
What do you mean?
This is the Garosugil of the Philippines.
- Garosugil of the Philippines? / - Yes.
The hottest place in Manila.
Remember the volcanic mountain we climbed?
The volcano at the peak?
- We'll go there first. / - That's a good spot.
(The smallest volcanic mountain the world!)
This is Mount Taal!
- Wow. / - It's beautiful.
- I watched the Saipan episode. / - Right.
They did a lot of water activities.
But they didn't view Nemo.
Really?
Look, Nemo.
Nemo, Nemo...
We'll catch Nemo and show the viewers.
What is this place?
Look how clear the water is.
Make some noise!
(3-day package, the Dara Tour)
I feel sorry for Taehoon.
- Can I leave in the middle? / - No.
In Korea, in the news and in the papers,
a lot of unfortunate incidents have been reported.
That's why a lot of people think it's dangerous.
I want people to realize that
the Philippines isn't entirely dangerous.
I'll show you a new side to the Philippines.
The princess of Asia, a K-pop star!
- A top model too! / - How cute.
- The Dara Tour! / - Come in, come in.
Are you departing now?
The weather's so lovely.
(Fashionista has gotten changed)
You shouldn't spin it like that.
(Where are you going?)
(First business class trip on Battle Trip?)
What's going on?
It's not regular economy class.
It's premium economy.
A lot of foreign airlines have that now.
It's my first time.
Premium economy class seats...
They're wider than I expected.
Premium economy...
It's neither economy nor business...
It's in the middle.
Business class is really expensive.
However, this...
You only need to pay an extra $30.
It's just $30.
You can travel more comfortably for $30.
You can upgrade you seat for $30.
- You can upgrade for $30? / - Yes.
- That's a must. / - I didn't know.
They even have wi-fi.
I know. You can watch movies.
(15MB, free usage for 30 minutes)
Look.
Battle Trip?
"I love that show."
"I have to watch this on TV."
Thank you.
We've departed at last.
Wow. This is so much fun.
There's been so much improvement.
How long is the flight?
- 3 and a half hours. / - 3 and a half hours.
It's the closest resort from Korea.
We've arrived. This...
We're at terminal 2.
Terminal 2 is used only by
Philippine Airline's airplanes.
It's not as busy at the other terminals and
you can claim your luggage faster.
We've arrived in Manila.
We're here!
I've been to the Philippines several times.
Seeing Sandara travel...
It feels like a different country.
- You'll see a different Philippines. / - Everyone...
Everyone tells me that.
What are we going to take?
- Let's call an Uber. / - Uber?
In the Philippines, it's best to rent a car that
has a driver or to take a taxi.
- This is legal, right? / - Yes.
A lot of people think that...
- It could be dangerous for women. / - Right.
You can view the driver's details on your phone.
Their face, car number...
It even shows their cell phone number.
Just send them a text message.
(Beginner's course: Discover a new side to Manila)
We're here.
This feels like a totally new world.
10 years ago, Bonifacio...
- It was empty. / - There was nothing here?
There was nothing here.
I came recently and it had totally changed.
At night, it transforms into a hot place.
There are clubs here.
It's quite luxurious.
It's a good street for women to walk around.
- This is downtown Manila. / - Bonifacio.
I want to go there.
Go, go, go!
- Let's have a coffee. / - I really want a coffee.
It's so cold.
Hi.
Surprise!
Hi.
(Sandara's fan approaches shyly)
(People line up for photos)
Thank you.
I feel relaxed because I used to live here.
The people here are really gentle.
I feel upset because the Korean media
only reports crimes.
Sandara, are you as famous as
Hwijae in the Philippines?
I don't know if it's okay to say this.
I'm as famous as Yu Jaeseok.
- Not Lee Hwijae? / - Hwijae's nothing.
- Hwijae's not worth comparing to. / - Right...
Don't compare you to him?
(Upset)
No.
- Both of them put together. / - Right.
- Yu Jaeseok and Lee Hwijae? / - Put together.
That's how famous you are.
There's a spot where I used to take photos.
Let's take a photo then.
Let's pretend we're receiving energy.
Okay.
I want to receive it like this.
What? Goose bumps!
Photos are important when traveling.
- Not like that. / - No?
It doesn't look very good.
A little...
I'm really bad at taking photos.
Eat nice food, have coffee, play games, take photos.
Share your photo with me!
I'm hungry.
- Let's eat. It's past meal time. / - Right.
Let's go have sinigang.
- I'll introduce that. / - Here?
- Let's eat here. / - What's the first meal?
It's a famous Filipino dish.
It's called sinigang.
It's similar to tom yang koong.
The sour taste comes from tamarind.
- That creates the sour flavor. / - Sinigang.
- Yes. / - I've never heard of it.
I couldn't eat it at first.
Now, it's my favorite food.
Once, we went on a tour to the U.S.
My Filipino fans made this and brought it...
To my hotel.
- I really wanted to eat it. / - Wow.
- But they don't have it in Korea. / - Not yet.
They don't sell it in Korea.
They can't create the sour taste.
They don't have the ingredients.
Pork sinigang.
Shrimp sinigang and fish sinigang.
Excuse me.
Here it is.
This is sinigang.
Is it similar to Korean stew?
It's like tom yam koong.
- This... / - I want to try it.
It has an ingredient called ube.
I've eaten a lot of ube ice cream and candy.
I've never eaten it as a dish.
(What does ube sinigang taste like?)
(Excited)
(Shocked)
It's purple.
Focus on the purple soup.
We're eating purple soup right now.
The only purple soup we've ever tried...
- Is red bean porridge. / - Right.
(Hand shakes in fear)
Is it okay?
Is it okay to eat purple soup?
(Afraid to eat the purple soup)
- It's okay? / - It has ube in it.
- I've only eaten clear soup. / - Is purple soup okay?
Gargamel made purple soup to boil smurfs in.
Magic soup.
He never put meat in it.
(Sandara tries it first just in case)
I like it.
I go crazy over sinigang.
It's a little...
(She begins digging in)
(Will Hyoni like the taste of sinigang?)
Is it okay to say I don't like it?
Yes.
Actually, the taste of sinigang...
Koreans don't like it because it's sour.
It's okay.
The smell...
It smells corn soup. I love that.
Yes.
(The taste of sinigang?)
- Is it good? / - Look.
- Is it good? / - It's...
It's vinegar.
We're ruined.
- Nice. / - She can't lie.
Do you like tom yam koong?
- I love tom yam koong. / - I love it.
The more you taste it,
it grows on you like tom yam koong.
You get a shock at first.
It's like really thick vinegar.
- It's not usually this thick. / - Thick vinegar.
- It's because of the ube. / - It's not like this?
No wonder they don't sell this in Korea.
I've never tasted anything like this before.
I don't know what to compare this taste to.
It has big slices of pork in it...
Like this.
Right.
I'm going to try the meat.
Thick pieces.
It tastes really good with the pork.
It's really unfamiliar.
It's too sour if you taste just the soup.
I didn't think it would taste
really good as a meal but
it tastes quite good with the meat.
It's good with the meat.
It's pork...
It's like pork with lemon sauce.
That's what it tastes like.
If you don't eat it with the toppings,
if you try just the soup...
I was shocked by the taste.
- I put rice in this soup and eat it. / - Really?
I really love sinigang.
If you eat the vegetables with the rice...
I really love this.
Spain, the U.S., Japan, China...
It was a colony to all those nations so
there's been a lot of influence.
It doesn't have a strong fragrance.
That's the taste of sinigang.
It's sour and it can be hard to eat.
Koreans will find it easy to eat
all the other foods.
They don't sell sinigang in Korea but
it's a famous food in the Philippines.
If you compare it to Korean food,
it's like pork and kimchi stew, right?
- Yes. / - You're right!
I should try that when I visit the Philippines.
It's like when I first tried tom yam koong in Thailand.
I got a shock.
Foreigners get a shock when they come to Korea
and try kimchi or soybean paste stew.
Later, they can't forget the taste.
You like it.
It grows on you.
It's strange at first but you get used to it.
I can't help myself from picking up this pink food.
- This... / - What's this?
It's asado.
Is it like curry?
Beef asado?
It's a beef dish.
It's a local dish that's been influenced.
- Hwijae would like that. / - Totally.
The beef's so soft.
- It's like braised short ribs. / - That's right.
The texture and taste is really similar
to braised short ribs.
I think anyone would enjoy this.
It'd be great for Koreans to try this.
Filipino style braised short ribs.
(They continue eating)
It's good.
Wow!
It's here.
- Purple again. / - More purple.
This is it.
What's with the color?
(Ube ice cream)
Wait...
(Ube ice cream)
Did they freeze the soup?
- Earlier... / - This is how ube's usually eaten.
- Just try this. / - Okay.
- Just try the ice cream. / - Okay.
We have to have halo halo for dessert.
All restaurants have this.
It's a national snack in the Philippines.
It's different at every restaurant.
The ingredients and fruits
can't be tasted in Korea.
I really like it.
- It looks like a toy. / - Ube ice cream.
(Delicious)
It's really delicious.
That's good. That's delicious.
The soup wasn't good, right?
The soup tasted good the more I ate it.
This is like milk ice flakes
with chestnut ice cream.
That's what it tastes like.
It's so good.
I love this.
You're right.
You're a genius in expressing tastes.
It's like milk ice flakes.
With the ice cream...
It tastes better if you mix it together.
I think this is leche flan.
What's this?
Pandan. They only have this in the Philippines.
Pandan..
The foods that Sandara's introducing
are all new to us.
We've been to the Philippines so many times...
- Why didn't we ever eat that? / - I've never seen it.
My friends...
They also said they hadn't tried it on previous trips.
When I thought of local Filipino food,
I expected the restaurant to be really humble.
I think this is a great place for girls to
come and try local food.
What are we going to do now?
You said it was amazing last time.
- Laguna pool villa village. / - Great.
This is the really good part.
When I went on the Dara Tour...
- We stayed at a different place every day. / - Right.
One of the places we stayed at...
I've been to many countries but
I really enjoyed myself there.
There's a really long waterslide.
- It's like a water theme park. / - Right.
They have slides inside the house.
A waterpark?
- You can own a waterpark for a day. / - Yes.
It's not really big.
It's like a village with houses.
You can knock on the door.
You can deal the price on the spot.
- Sleep there. / - They have rooms and a pool.
You can cook your own food there.
(Swimming pool)
- Wow. / - What is this?
I think their budget's different to ours.
- No, no. / - No way.
When the viewers see this...
- They'll be really amazed. / - Right.
I think we should show that accommodation,
rather than staying in Manila.
- It'd be more fun. / - Manila's really typical.
Drumroll!
Accommodation that you've never seen!
Find your own house!
Even Koreans who lived in
the Philippines for several years don't know it.
We've just arrived.
It took a little over an hour.
Why aren't we going to choose our house now?
I want to buy something. I've invited friends so...
I should serve something.
It's just the 2 of us.
I thought about what we should do at the pool villa.
Just the two of us...
Should I invite my friends?
Yes, do that.
Do a lot of people come if you invite them?
Of course. I have a lot of celebrity friends.
It's similar to traditional markets in Korea.
They sell a variety of food here.
This is really different to earlier.
It really feels like we're in the Philippines now.
There's a huge gap between the rich and poor.
They may not want to give you change.
You should aim to pay the right amount.
Carry small change with you.
(Sandara's fan approaches)
This market's going crazy.
I told you Sandara means hi here.
Right now...
You can see it for yourself.
(I want to be in the photo)
I got hit several times.
People walking past
felt so excited to see Sandara.
- They hit me... / - They pushed you aside?
- Mangosteen. / - I want to buy mangosteen.
Yes, buy a lot of this.
It's cheap.
We should eat a lot of fruit here.
Fruit is really cheap here as it's local produce.
- Fruit tastes good in the markets. / - Mangosteen.
- It's cheap. / - It's so cheap.
- That's so delicious. / - Mangosteen.
- What's that? / - Korean pears.
I'm so surprised.
Korean pears must taste better.
They don't have pears here.
That's why!
(Dara Tour, exploring the traditional market)
(Laguna pool villa village)
I haven't been here in ages.
This brings back memories.
This entire village...
They're all private pool villas.
It's not just this village.
On the way, there are more.
- There are thousands. / - There are several villages.
You can go and knock on the door.
Take a look around. If you don't like it, go to
the next house, knock and choose.
You need to walk around a lot then.
- Face to face? / - Yes.
Wi-fi's only available on the plane then.
- Right. / - That's the fun.
You can look around, negotiate the price yourself.
That sounds fun.
The weather's better now that it's dark.
This is great.
You have to tell them what you want.
A cheaper place, smaller place...
You can choose what's best for you.
I found this really amazing last time.
- You can choose your own place then? / - Yes.
That's the fun.
It's pink outside.
Wow.
Here's the pool.
A pool and karaoke machine...
- They're the basics. / - Basic options.
Expensive places have game consoles.
The price begins from around $70
to $1,000. There's a huge variety.
- $1,000 for 1 night? / - Yes.
Is it okay to just walk in?
Sometimes, there are people staying there.
Is it okay to go inside?
There's a lot of bamboo here.
It's expensive. It's 25,000 peso.
Do you want to go there?
Yes, it looks small.
- It's dark. We should decide. / - Yes.
This is very Filipino style.
There's a bungalow too.
It's cute.
It's so cheap!
It's 7,000 peso. If we stay here today,
he'll give it to us for 5,000 peso.
It must be the off season right now.
25 people.
There are 5 rooms.
- The staff... / - I can hear everyone whispering.
- They're whispering. / - The staff got a good sleep.
The price is good. Let's keep this in mind.
The slide is a little short.
We want to show the viewers
something that looks totally amazing.
There it is!
I can see something.
An amusement park...
- Right! / - A resort.
- Wow. / - This is amazing!
- Wow. / - Wow!
- What? / - This is it!
What?
- It's so cheap. / - A waterpark...
You can own that for a day.
This is it!
I want to sleep here.
- Wow, the slide. / - The slide's really long.
I haven't been to a waterpark recently.
- The water's deep too. / - Wow.
It's like your own house.
It's really different to pool villas
by the beach, right?
- This is nice. / - Wow
The price...
- It looks really expensive. / - Right.
20,000 peso.
It's around $400 then.
$400.
(A cozy $100 pool villa)
(A waterpark scale $400 pool villa)
- A lot of your friends are coming... / - Then...
If we all pay for it together...
If just 5 more people come,
7, 4...
If 5 people come, it's $80 each.
- Anyway, it's not bad. / - You're right.
- Let's do it, okay? / - I had to ask...
My friends to pay too.
That's cheating.
That's not fair.
Let's set up now.
Perfect!
There's so much food.
Balloons, a karaoke machine...
We've prepared a great party.
I was curious about this.
Pork rinds?
It's a snack?
You should dip it in vinegar.
It's like a bland version
of Cheetos.
It's not as salty.
It's goes well with beer.
It looks delicious.
I want to taste it.
I want to see how different it is to Korean chicken.
Dip it in the sauce.
It's just chicken.
It's really tender.
It's been cooked well in soy sauce.
It's really soft.
- It's good. / - You don't need to dip it in the sauce.
Does it taste like marinated pork hocks?
- The soy sauce taste is stronger. / - Is it better?
I think they're here. Hello?
Wow! One person's here.
The national son of the Philippines.
Hi. What's that?
The national son's on a scale of his own.
I need to pay this off for the next year.
- National son of the Philippines. / - National son?
- The national son. / - I invited celebrity friends.
- Wow. / - He's Korean.
A Korean comedian.
- Ryan Bang. / - Yes.
- He's famous. / - Yes.
He was on "Screening Humanity."
I don't have anywhere to put this.
- This is my favorite soju. / - Soju?
Soju, soju and beer, mix.
This is Joross Gamboa.
We've been best friends for 12 years.
She even came on my honeymoon with my wife.
You went on their honeymoon?
You were both on "Screening Humanity."
She's your senior.
I went on it because of Sandara.
I asked her before I went on the show.
Sandara told me to do it.
She said it'd create good memories for me.
I really loved it.
(The lechon arrives)
We always eat this at parties.
The pork has rice, garlic inside.
No, not that.
- Sikyung loves that. / - No.
It's a must for parties.
That's so good.
We only need this for parties.
All we need is lechon. It's the culture here.
This is really delicious.
Once you taste it, you get addicted.
Our party's more classy now.
I don't like Korean pork skins.
This is savory.
It's really soft.
Me too!
(A private waterpark on a summer night)
Under the sea...
I'm a grilled clam!
(Me too)
(Not you)
This is Robi Domingo.
He's smart and talented.
(Dives)
- He's a famous star in the Philippines. / - Yes.
All 3 of them are famous, right?
They're really famous.
(Enjoy a local pool villa too!)
(The beginner's course ends)
It's so pretty.
There's no one here.
It feels like a secret island.
(Only available in the Dara Tour's bonus book)
(Nemo and a sea turtle)
Nemo really exists!
Today's the second day of the Dara Tour.
Yesterday was the beginner's tour.
It was just easy traveling.
- Today's more active. / - More dynamic.
Intermediate course!
(Intermediate course: Explore the outskirts of Manila)
We're hungry so we should eat now.
Since I was a little kid...
Until now.
I've been eating this for decades...
Decades?
Your age...
It's so good.
I can order...
Without looking at the menu.
(I'm best at ordering)
(Respectful gaze)
(It looks good)
I ordered a lot.
You have to go there if you go to the Philippines.
Right. Have you tried it?
- Yes, I go there too. / - You know it.
It's famous.
At last, our food!
I'm so hungry.
Surprise!
Let's begin.
(Quality food for a fast food restaurant)
Most fast food places...
- They sell hamburgers. / - Right.
They don't sell that here.
They sell spaghetti for cheap.
You don't need to go to a restaurant.
You can enjoy simple food here.
Should I have ordered spaghetti there?
Spaghetti and chicken.
Let's begin eating.
(Playing their own background music)
It's good.
I feel like an elementary student eating this.
When I first came to the Philippines,
my parents bought me spaghetti here.
In 1995, they didn't have that in Korea.
I took a bite...
It was a new world.
It has sausages in it.
It has sausages in it so
it tastes sweet.
The pasta that's served here...
It isn't bouncy like the pasta
that they serve at Italian restaurants.
I think that's why this tastes good.
It's soggy and it's mixed with cheese.
It's spicy.
- The serving's big too. / - It's really cheap.
Yes.
They have spicy chicken here now.
It's spicy.
I want this.
Chicken...
It's just been fried.
If Jaeseok eats this,
he'll love it.
- Kids would love this. / - Yes.
Guys like Jeon Hyunmoo.
Want to eat this with me?
I'll pretend to serve my boyfriend.
Open up.
(End of girlfriend roleplaying)
I went to the Philippines a few years ago.
Everyone inside the restaurant was smiling.
I decided that I had to go there.
It was delicious but I didn't try the spaghetti.
Should we slice the steak now?
You can have steak...
- For $1. / - We ate steak.
(The aromatic fragrance of a hamburger patty)
It's really tender and juicy.
It's good.
Where are we going now?
We're full...
Let's go to Mount Taal.
- There? / - I love it there.
I want to be proposed there.
- Really? / - Yes.
She wants to be proposed to.
There's a volcano called Mount Taal.
It's the smallest active volcano in the world.
In the past, on my SNS...
I was so into the moment.
I said that I would say okay
if a guy proposed to me there.
(Smallest yet most beautiful volcano in the world)
(Sandara wants to be proposed to at Mount Taal)
A lot of Koreans go there but
I think the course I've planned will be a little different.
She wants to be proposed to here.
Sandara's future husband,
please remember this spot.
We're here at last!
Mount Taal.
Let's take the boat
to arrive at the island.
At the village, we'll ride a horse
to ride up to the peak. That's the system.
The cost of the boat, horse and meal
costs around $70 each.
Isn't that cheap?
- I think it's raining. / - It's a shower.
I hope it doesn't rain because...
You can't see the view if it rains.
(Will they make it to the peak of Mount Taal?)
Let's wait and see.
Our opponents offered a lot to see.
- I want to go there. / - Most of all...
The village with pool villas.
If I'd known that place when I was single...
- Right. / - That's so unfortunate.
- I feel so regretful. / - When you were single...
You didn't go traveling when you were single?
I have a family now. Protect me.
Okay.
The only place I've been to in
the Philippines is Cebu.
If I'd known a place like that in Manila...
Anyway, I think it'd be nice to go there
with my family too.
- But... / - Most tourists to the Philippines...
- Only go to Cebu or Boracay. / - Right.
That's why I decided to introduce Manila.
You didn't just get rid of the stereotypes
that we have of Manila.
I want to go to Manila right now.
It was lovely.
Everything was great.
What am I saying?
What did I just say?
I think the food melted you.
It's okay. Their trip was nice.
- It was really nice. / - Our trip will be nice too.
- That's important. / - Of course.
Imagine that you went there with your family.
You knocked on the doors.
What do you do if all the villas are full?
That could happen but...
- There are thousands. / - There are so many.
There are resorts nearby...
- Run by Koreans. / - Hot spring resorts.
Hot springs.
You don't need to feel afraid.
I think it'd be good to go there.
It's like taking a trip to Gapyeong
with your friends.
Sandara used to go to Laguna
with her friends.
It's really safe.
I think it'd be great to visit there.
While we're on the subject...
- Teach us some tagalog. / - Tagalog.
Sandara spoke it earlier.
- She was impressive. / - Also...
- It suits her. / - Teach us some greetings.
Tagalog is a language that's
derived from Spanish.
- There are a lot of similar words. / - Really?
To begin...
When you walk past, "kmusta?"
- Kmusta? / - It means how are you.
- Kmusta? / - Yes.
- Kmusta? / - Kmusta?
How do you say I want to win?
I want to win.
That's really hard.
But I think I'll lose.
No, don't say that.
But I think I'll lose.
- What? / - We won't lose.
Hey! Don't say things that I can't understand.
- Hey! / - Calm down.
Don't call her hey. She's a guest!
Don't say things I can't understand.
I feel really offended.
What did you just say?
- Hey? / - We won't lose.
- Yes. / - Right.
Give me a discount.
You need to know this.
Discount.
The Filipino language...
- You can say that? / - English is common.
- Right. / - Words like hi, hello...
- Right. / - I'm curious about something.
Did Yang Hyunsuk go there too?
- On the Dara Tour? / - Oh, our boss...
It's better for both of us if he doesn't go.
(Sandara keeps business and pleasure apart)
Tell us someone that we know...
- That's been there. / - That has a double meaning.
- 2NE1. / - 2NE1 went.
When BIGBANG came on a tour...
I took them to the destination
that you'll see soon.
- That's great. / - Also, non-celebrity friends...
I write down restaurants and menus for them.
They thank me when they return.
I can understand now why
you wanted to come on the show so much.
You really wanted to introduce it.
She lived there for 10 years.
She wants to win and go back again.
She's preparing another tour.
This is just the beginner's and intermediate course.
After I win...
- I want to take another trip. / - Advanced course?
- Yes. / - An advanced course.
If you want to go back, it's better to lose...
- Then go back. / - Right.
Director, give her a second chance.
- Let's view the rest of the trip then. / - Yes.
- The second half? / - Yes.
Let's view the second half of the Dara Tour.
- Go! / - Go, go, go!
This is the real thing.
- This is the good part. / - This is the good part?
Yes.
It look like the ocean but it's a lake.
This isn't the ocean? It's a lake?
There's so much water.
Don't rain!
Don't rain!
There's a Filipino dance to prevent rain.
It's called the sun dance.
Show us.
Does that really exist...
- Or did you make that up? / - It really exists.
It's the wet season so there were a lot of showers.
(Serious)
This is supposed to stop the rain.
Don't fall!
♪ Rain, don't fall, go away! ♪
♪ I'll disappear without a trace! ♪
♪ You thought I'd cling... ♪
♪ No way, don't fool yourself! ♪
(Dance time)
When did I do that?
(Go away, rain!)
My head hurts.
You can see a jungle once you enter the island.
My wish to buy a house over there
in the future.
The view's really great.
It's really expensive.
(Dream on)
There are houses there?
Yes, if you go up...
It's so pretty.
Wow. It's beautiful.
It's because I did this dance.
The sky...
It feels like you're in a totally different place.
- To get there... / - How long does it take?
- It's close to Manila. / - Yes.
The scenery's very exotic.
The view is spectacular.
It looks like Jeju-do.
- It looks like Korea. / - From now...
- We'll ride horses like warriors? / - Let's ride.
This...
I could be asked to be in a historical drama.
Of course.
You're really good at horse riding.
- She's excited. / - The rain's weaker now.
Their youthful energy worries me.
It never ends. What about our team?
Our team will get tired easily.
I'm already worried.
The horses are pretty.
Let's ride.
The horses are small like the ones in Jeju-do.
Yes. They're the perfect size for me.
I feel sorry for the horse.
(She looks shaky)
When we go up...
We have to ride the horse.
You're taller than the horse.
I felt sorry for the horse.
She's taller than the horse.
The horse took me there but
I felt really bad for the horse.
Did your feet touch the ground?
No, of course not.
Why didn't you let the horse ride you?
Hang in there.
I have a conscience.
I chose the biggest horse that they had.
I won't be able to ride that.
- You're too tall. / - I'd feel bad for the horse.
You're going to see a spectacular view.
Let's go.
- We're going up. / - Wow. It's really big.
On the way up to the peak...
You can see houses here.
I think people live inside.
- Sandara! / - Hello.
Hello.
They know easy Korean words.
Sandara!
Everyone here called out her name too.
How did they recognize you from that far away?
Everyone recognized her.
(A jungle-like forest)
Human hands haven't touched this place.
The trees have all grown naturally.
It feels like the jungle.
You'll feel that if you come here.
It feels like the jungle, right?
Are you sure you're not walking on the ground?
Are you just pretending to ride the horse?
- Like this... / - In fact...
Duck, duck.
(Duck)
(Perfect)
This is scary.
I think I'm going to fall to the left.
It's quite thrilling but
the owners always say the horses are veterans.
My concept today is hip hop.
You know it, right? Hip hop.
Hip hop style.
(I am YG!)
(Groove to the beat)
I'm riding a horse.
My skin's burnt.
Our team's desperate.
- Look here. / - Don't do that.
Don't say that to Taehoon.
I'm riding a horse.
My skin's burnt.
I'm on TV.
Yeah!
Come on, come on. Yo!
When she sees this...
CL's going to give me a hard time.
She's cute.
Isn't it boring if you ride that
for 30 minutes?
It's fun taking in the scenery.
The scenery keeps changing.
They didn't fall for it.
We're almost there.
Look at the sky.
Hello!
The view's totally different.
It's totally different to last time.
There are several trails to the peak.
That's the usual course.
- It's different to last year, right? / - Yes.
I wanted to give the viewers
a new tip so I chose this course.
The course that all those people are taking...
That's the most popular course.
It's really crowded.
The course we took is the intermediate course.
I think that trail takes longer too.
- You're right. This is shorter. / - This is shorter.
It's really quiet.
We need to walk up a little bit.
We have to walk up for around 2 to 3 minutes
to reach the peak.
Okay.
It's so pretty.
- Wow. / - It's beautiful.
That's lovely.
Pose.
What was that?
I'm happy now.
On the beginner's course,
the sun's really strong.
There aren't many trees.
The intermediate course has more advantages.
At last!
Introducing Mount Taal!
Mount Taal.
It's the smallest active volcano in the world.
It looks really big.
- It's a volcano? / - Yes.
That's why it has hot springs.
It was listed no. 1 as a site...
- To view before you die. / - No. 1?
- Yes. / - Yes.
Here we go.
You missed.
Geez.
- Nice shot. / - Do you like golf?
- Wow. / - You feel so good.
I'm scared of heights.
Why is it still here?
Why didn't it fly?
I hit it.
- Cheers. / - Cheers.
This is coconut juice.
Yum!
We're drinking coconut juice while enjoying this view.
This is coconut juice, right?
- You have to scrape the flesh. / - Right.
Even cucumbers taste good on the mountains.
- Coconut... / - You can eat it with a spoon.
I don't have a spoon right now.
(I'll use my teeth)
I'll grate it with my teeth.
Okay then.
Let's go back down.
We worked hard. We should eat now.
Let's go!
Wait for me.
I've been left behind.
The staff tell me that
they didn't eat anything in the Philippines.
They didn't like the food.
When I travel with the staff,
I order for them.
They say, "Where did this food come from?"
They dig into their food.
Also, I give them tips on sauces,
how to eat the food.
- Somewhere more delicious... / - Sandara's tour.
- San E, let's go. / - I want to.
- Let's pay for our own expenses. / - Sure.
(Mount Taal)
("J" Grill)
Growl, growl.
- I'm so hungry. / - We're here at last!
I'm a regular here.
When I lived in the Philippines,
I came here practically every day.
I don't need to look at the menu.
I can order right now.
(A delicious array of Filipino food)
The food looks really expensive.
I really love this restaurant.
- It's expensive. / - BIGBANG had a concert here.
They said, "We hear you rule here."
"Introduce us to a restaurant."
I brought them here.
They were all late.
It wasn't my fault.
I decided to show them
the view when the sun set.
We came and it was dark.
It was pitch black.
So the guys said,
"Why did we come here?"
Once they tasted the food, it was good.
- They ordered more and ate. / - Right.
They said they wanted to come with their parents.
The food's so good they wanted to share it.
- That's great. / - They wanted to feed their parents.
Oh?
It's ours!
The food's here.
- Because we're hungry. / - The food's here.
- We were hungry. / - Also, that...
- Look. / - There's a method to eating it.
There's a way to enjoy the food.
Squeeze calamansi juice?
You need to squeeze calamansi juice.
Calamansi is the Filipino version of lemons.
It's more sour than lemons.
Squeeze this.
Also, only in the Philippines...
It's similar to soy sauce.
You have to be speedy.
- Hot sauce, okay? / - Okay, do it.
- The food's similar. / - It's pork sisig.
You have to eat that with alcohol.
- Is it a hot plate? / - Yes, sizzling.
It tastes really good with beer.
Sikyung, have it with beer.
- Drink up. / - 0 calories?
Is it good? How many calories is it?
Minus 100 calories.
Minus 100 calories?
It's so good.
- It's good? / - Yes.
It's so good. This restaurant...
Is that garlic rice?
Rice is always garlic rice.
- Let's begin. / - Let's eat.
(A spoon of garlic rice with sisig)
Do you eat it with the rice?
Like how we mix rice with bulgogi.
There it is.
(She screams like a dolphin)
Wait.
Is this chicken?
This dish is called pork sisig.
It's pork.
Is it a staple food in the Philippines?
It's like how we eat kimchi or soybean paste stew.
- It's like that. / - It's like Korea's bulgogi.
Sort of.
It's fried with vegetables.
The texture is quite crispy.
It's like eating pork skin.
But...
It's not skin, it's flesh.
That's why it's really tender.
I think it tastes better when
you mix it with the rice.
It's here!
Squid.
What is it now?
- Squid? / - This is really...
- It looks good. / - The staff would all love this.
The moment I ate that...
- I ordered beer. / - It's beer food.
- Wow. / - It's so good.
Women would all love this.
You have to order beer.
I know how to describe this taste.
This...
At the convenience store...
We buy tough octopus or squid legs.
It's the same sauce but this is soft.
It's not tough.
This is really...
It's bouncy and tender.
The sauce is the same. It's delicious.
- That looks good. / - This restaurant...
- It's not a traditional place, right? / - It's so good.
- They're all traditional foods. / - Really?
They sell sinigang here too.
- Enjoy. / - Enjoy.
They drink beer with ice.
Right.
This is so good.
If they sold this at pubs in Korea,
the pub would be a huge success.
This...
They should sell this in Korea.
Sikyung has been won over.
- Wow. / - Your mouth's been ajar for ages.
What can I do?
Goodness.
They should sell this in Korea.
This is an urgent matter.
It's so good.
This...
This is one of my favorite foods.
Shrimp gambas.
I love this.
I always order 2 plates of this.
- The sauce... / - Gambas.
- Gambas. / - That's expensive.
It's $6.80.
Shrimp, shrimp!
- No way. / - The squid was just $4.90.
I love the vegetables in this.
- It's like chili shrimp. / - It's a little spicy.
Also...
It has an egg.
It's like it has a steamed egg on top.
- It calls for rice. / - It's delicious.
Kids would love this.
It has an egg.
Oh?
Oh?
- Ours? / - You get mad if it goes to another table.
I think it's ours.
- Look at it. / - You love to eat.
- You have to forget about your diet. / - Seafood...
It's great in the Philippines.
(A huge creature arrives)
It's like the character in Dooly.
- The alien fish. / - Right.
(Lookalikes)
It's a fish that's found in the Philippines.
It's eaten steamed or fried.
- I chose fried. / - Let's eat.
It has garlic flakes on top.
- It costs $6. / - They boned it and fried it.
- Sorry. / - Sorry.
Here's a piece for you.
A piece for me too.
I want this too.
I'm going to calm down, explain the taste now.
Okay.
Oh...
I think I need to have it with the sauce.
I'm going to make it for you.
Sandara's sauce.
The sauce recipe is very important.
Sandara's sauce.
- Add the calamansi. / - The proportion's important.
This, then this...
Eat it with this.
Spicy, sour, salty.
I could eat just the sauce.
- She's the Filipino version of Baek Jongwon. / - Yes.
I'm chef Sandara.
When we eat fish in Korea,
the fish itself doesn't have an intense flavor.
You have to eat it with the sauce.
The fried fish has a good, chewy texture.
That's why it's more delicious.
- It's crispy. / - Yes. That creates the flavor.
How did they fry it like this?
It looks delicious.
- I ate there all the time. / - You hiked during the day.
That's why you were so hungry.
We didn't eat much for breakfast.
- We starved for the rest of the day. / - I'm a model...
So you didn't think I'd eat?
It's better to eat and work out.
I've almost finished an entire bowl of rice.
- Wow. She ate it all. / - I ate a whole bowl.
I eat 2 bowls when I go there.
I have to watch my weight all the time.
I usually eat just half a bowl of rice.
- She's a model. / - Just half a bowl.
I ate a whole bowl here.
This restaurant's really delicious.
That's why I'm eating like this.
Okay. The Dara Tour's intermediate course...
- It's a success, right? / - It's a success!
- Cheers! / - Cheers!
Today's hotel is amazing.
It's one of the top 3 hotels in Manila.
- It's really plush. / - It's so nice.
BIGBANG stayed at this hotel.
A lot of international stars stay here
when they come to perform.
- Know how we could afford it? / - No.
Until September, there's a promotion
for the deluxe room. It's $150.
We're going to spend a luxurious night.
It's so clean.
Wow.
- This room is $150? / - Yes.
Did you stay for a week?
- 3 days. / - We starved ourselves...
So we could show you a lot.
- This is good. / - Sleep. We're taking the first flight.
- Wash and sleep. / - The first flight?
There are over 7,000 islands in the Philippines.
Out of those, we're going to visit
one of the most beautiful oceans.
It's not Boracay or Cebu.
(Bonus book: Under the sea to find Nemo)
(Ocean untouched by human hands)
(Like a fairy tale under the ocean)
(The Dara Tour goes to a hidden island)
I went to the Philippines many times to go diving.
It's great.
- You took a domestic flight. / - Yes.
It takes 80 minutes.
We're here!
(How exciting)
It's located next to Cebu.
Most people go to Cebu.
We came to Bohol. You said we're not coming here.
Our destination isn't Bohol but
they sell delicious ice cream here.
The tricycle is a method of public transport.
- It's a motorcycle, right? / - Yes.
- I feel happy. / - It looks fun.
I rode that to school.
Really?
(They ride out of the city)
(They feel free)
- I feel so free. / - Right.
We're here.
We've arrived.
- Goodness. / - Then...
When you come to Bohol, you have to try this.
The ice cream...
They only sell this in Bohol.
- This really... / - This ice cream!
I still can't forget the taste.
- It's just... / - Organic ingredients.
- What should I try? / - Then...
- Mango, durian... / - Ube too.
Melon.
- It's so good. / - I want...
Melon please.
They have coconut too. I want it all.
I think we have to pay now.
She just glared at me.
- I saw her expression. / - Cute.
Purple again!
You love purple.
You eat with your eyes, then your mouth.
Thank you.
What did you order?
Melon and pandan.
Pandan...
It's a fruit in the Philippines.
It's usually eaten with coconuts.
I ordered something dragon...
Dragonfruit and mango.
Mango ice cream...
I thought it'd taste like the fruit mango.
It doesn't take like yogurt ice cream
or fruit ice cream.
It's really sticky but
it has a really rich fruit flavor
This is really different too.
It tastes a little like Indian naan.
It's still crispy.
The cone's made of potatoes.
It's made with potatoes.
Now that we've had ice cream,
where are we going?
The final bonus book of our trip!
We're going to meet Nemo.
We're going to see Nemo?
- Should we meet him? / - Nemo and Dory.
Wait, Nemo and Dory.
Sandara's coming. Go, go, go!
- Wow. / - At last...
- It was a lake earlier. This is the sea. / - It's over.
Most people...
- Go to Cebu then drop by Bohol. / - Right.
We went to Bohol and are going to another island.
- When are you going to tell me? / - It's a secret.
- You'll find out when we get there. / - Really?
- The ocean! / - Let's go!
Let's film a music video.
I was the cinematographer for our video.
(What's that?)
(Feels sickened)
Nemo and Dory.
- This is the hidden island I spoke about. / - Really?
Balicasag Island.
Wow.
(Balicasag Island)
Look at the color.
How far away is that from the mainland?
30 minutes.
- According to the weather. / - By boat?
It's right next to Cebu.
2 hours by boat.
- 2 hours from Cebu? / - Yes.
- You can go from Cebu. / - People don't know.
It will be really busy once people see this.
- Balicasag. / - Balicasag.
Look at that.
We're here.
1, 2, 3.
Sandara!
- Return your life vest. / - Come on.
Really? My life vest...
- Look. / - It's so pretty.
There's no one here.
It feels like a secret island.
More people will visit here soon.
We had to come here in advance.
Let's go to the table.
- Let's get set up and go in the water. / - Okay.
- There weren't many people nearby. / - Right.
- No one's here. / - To find Nemo and Dory.
I think we'll find them today.
I wonder if we'll find a turtle too.
(To find Nemo, Dory and the turtle)
(Dara Tour's journey begins)
- Oh, my God. / - I love the boat too.
It looks really exotic.
The boat's a traditional boat.
It's called a bangka. It looks like that.
Indigenous people used to ride that...
The water must be so clear.
I really wanted to jump in.
(She dives into the water at once)
It's so nice.
The water's so clear so I didn't hesitate.
I jumped right in.
There are over 7,000 islands in the Philippines
so there are a lot of resorts.
- Among them... / - We only know about Cebu.
- The water's so clean. / - Only the famous spots.
It's famous for being pretty.
We only go to Cebu, Boracay...
- We all go to the same places. / - Right.
(Only on the Dara Tour)
The water's quite deep.
You should prepare yourself.
Don't say that. I can't jump.
(Actually...)
If we go to the ocean,
what kind of watersports can you do?
I'm good at jet skis.
- You want to play on the water? / - On the surface.
- Not in the water? / - I don't want to suffocate.
I don't want to suffocate.
(First attempt at snorkeling)
You haven't been snorkeling before?
I'm afraid of going in the water.
- But the water's really clear. / - You did it this time?
I usually just jet ski.
- It's fun once you tried it, right? / - Yes.
- It's amazing. / - It was great to see Nemo.
We only saw it in books.
For example...
We met huge turtles.
The clam opened its mouth.
The clam did this.
The clam...
(What did the guide catch?)
It's blue.
A blue starfish.
I said I wanted to catch this.
Hi. Wow!
I'll let you live.
It dies if it's out of the water.
- I set it free. / - It's pretty.
There aren't many tourists so you should go now.
When they created the animation,
they took that fish as the model.
Right.
In South-East Asia,
even broken pieces of coral...
- It's illegal to take it with you. / - Right.
You need to return it.
(Where are you?)
(Tired)
Did you see Nemo?
No. Wait a minute.
I'm so tired.
Forget Nemo.
Goodness.
(Exhausted)
She said forget Nemo.
(Forget Nemo)
Nemo's below you.
Nemo?
(Nemo?)
(Knock, knock)
(Nemo, come and play with me)
Is this the only place you can see Nemo?
It lives among the coral.
- That's Nemo. / - There it is.
(Dad, someone's here)
(Who are you?)
(I'm shy, I want to hide)
(Vanish)
Nemo's actually alive!
I've never seen it before.
She's cute.
Nemo's alive.
Oh, my God.
I feel like I've met a figure from history.
Nemo's alive.
How cute.
I only saw it in the animation.
You've never gone snorkeling before?
- I was scared. / - Take your vest off next time.
- You can dive and go up. / - It's so fun.
That's right. We didn't get to do that.
- Turtle, turtle. / - A turtle?
Yes. We saw a turtle right
beneath our legs.
(Gosh)
(Let me get closer)
(Eating)
(You're embarrassing me)
(Sorry to disturb your meal)
It's cute. It's eating.
It's eating like this.
It's still.
(Enjoy snorkeling at Balicasag Island)
Bye!
That's the end?
Don't go.
I remember it all now.
Goodness.
We really had no idea about the Philippines.
- In the ocean... / - Yes.
The food.
Your trip...
I loved every part of it.
Especially the ocean at the end...
I don't know where else we'll be going but
I think it will the most
beautiful ocean on Battle Trip.
We have to talk about the island.
What else can you see besides Nemo and the turtle?
There's a dolphin tour.
Thousands of dolphins jump like this.
Right.
- Thousands? / - Sandara, can you prove that?
- You just want to win. / - I was shocked too.
- I... / - Not even that many dolphins...
- Exist in the world. / - Right.
Hundreds jump.
Dozens, dozens...
I've been on a dolphin tour before.
You can't see them immediately.
They use walkie-talkies and travel for ages.
- They swim around. / - You have to find them.
That's why on some days, you can't see them.
I circled Jeju-do to see the dolphins.
If you travel in the same direction,
you can't see them.
That's so true.
Right.
- You need to meet like this. / - Right.
If you don't have a plane...
Dolphins communicate to each other
by using sound waves.
Hey, they're circling this way.
So if too many people visit,
it could avoid them.
That island's going to be a huge hit.
We didn't have enough time.
The Dara Tour is usually more packed.
I had to...
I had to let the crew sleep.
Goodness.
I took a lot out.
She spent her school years there.
That's why she speaks that way.
She uses a lot of slang.
- Most importantly... / - Dara Tour was for 3 days.
- Your expenses... / - I bet you spent a lot.
- Your expenses are important. / - Yes.
- Let's do this. / - Your total expenses.
Excluding the airfare,
how much were your travel expenses?
- Per person. / - Per person.
$230.
That's so cheap.
For 3 days?
$230 per person.
That's because your friends paid
for the $400 pool villa.
It doesn't include the Laguna villa...
- But even excludng that... / - Right.
If you divide the costs with your friends...
You can dutch pay.
We don't have any friends.
Only the 2 of us traveled around.
Why didn't you make more friends then?
Let's go.
If you want to go to the Philippines according to
the Dara Tour, please vote.
(A different take on the Philippines)
(The judges' choice?)
- Okay. / - I'm scared.
- Okay, everyone. / - No.
How many people would pack
their bags for the Philippines?
I have to go back.
- The judges' choice? / - Choice!
- The second digit. / - No.
If the second digit's low, the first will be high.
- It's rotating. / - I think the women will vote.
- The first digit counts. / - I expect a new record.
- How many? / - Go up.
- 8. / - 8.
88.
- 88. / - 78.
78.
- 78. / - 88.
78.
- I told you it's hard. / - It's hard.
- Wow. / - It's still a high score.
If they got 78, what about us?
- I know. / - 78...
It's not easy to score over 80.
- This... / - Do you think you can beat that?
When I first came on the set...
- They shined as soon as they entered. / - Right.
However, as time passed,
I grew to think it's worth competing.
- Okay. / - Okay then.
- 78 isn't a low score. / - It's high.
- Right. / - It's hard to score over 80.
Let me inform the viewers.
We'll be taking a break next week.
- So... / - Look forward to next time.
(The hidden pearl of Asia, Vietnam)
(Vietnam, the nation of youth)
What a great view.
Let's have a great time.
Coffee, coffee.
- This is South-East Asia. / - They have it.
There's a desert.
(Exciting bikes on the desert)
(Excited)
Coriander, cumin...
You have to eat this.
I love spicy food.
(Vietnam delights the eyes and ears)
This is great.
