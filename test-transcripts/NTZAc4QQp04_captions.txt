[Applause]
[Music]
that night
you said i won't let it go
i said baby
[Music]
so this is probably the hardest video
that we've ever had to make and
hopefully it's going to be the hardest
video we'll ever have to make again
there is no right way of doing this yeah
it's the first time
[Music]
five seconds into the video
okay
we should name this video we're not
ready for this
yeah probably yeah um because we're not
so as you can see from the title and the
thumbnail of this video
nelly and i have separated
and
we're only
now ready to really talk about it to you
guys and we feel that now is the right
time to finally
um tell you guys what's been going on in
our lives over the past few months um
i'm leading into that we've been
separated for a few months already
and the reasons
behind the breakup are really very
personal and we don't want to share too
much i'm sure you guys do understand but
just to put it into
a short sentence or a few words so you
guys can understand this over the past
few months nelly and i have kind of
grown apart yeah
and um
as a consequence we
thought we'd give it a try to kind of
have a trial separation we went our own
ways for
a few weeks we tried to spend some time
apart and do our own thing
and after that we both realized that at
this point in our lives it just makes
more sense to
except
yeah that's
yeah
now this this
um
for sure comes as a shock to many of you
and i'm sure it's also very hard to
understand especially because still hard
to understand for us especially
exactly especially because we do still
love each other um just we we realized
that we cannot go on the way it has been
going and we need to
make a change for us to be
happy
also as individuals
happy happiness comes from within
happiness should never be dependent on
others it should always be within you
and i think we just realized
so
it's it's clear to us that many of you
guys watching us every single day have
already realized that something has been
going on and at this point i really
would like to thank all of you out there
that have nonetheless respected our
privacy that haven't been trying to pry
on on you know what's going on in our
lives and just giving us the space thank
you so much we really do appreciate it
and as you probably can see we have
turned the comments off on this video
just because this channel's creator
always has been good vibes only yeah but
unfortunately a huge live event like
this we have to share with you guys but
we decided to turn off the comments just
because we do not want any form of drama
or any form of people taking sides or
anything like that because for a simple
reason um we don't have any drama in our
lives um
there was nothing crazy behind the
scenes between the two of us we are
two adults that love each other and just
decided yeah and and there's this term
called
conscious uncoupling
and i think we have so much respect and
love for each other that we
know that
it wouldn't serve anybody
to point fingers or blame or whatever so
no drama on our side so now don't get us
wrong um this has not been easy for
neither of us it's probably been the
hardest that we've ever had to do in our
entire hottest time of my life
of our lives
i mean
there's a saying
healing private go in public
right so we were dealing
with this in our own way
privately we have cried a lot both
we talked a lot i think
we becomes we came so much closer
through this breakup just talking
through things that we weren't aware of
and
just
talking about areas in our lives that we
can personally we think
we could improve on not saying you could
i could right
it has definitely not been easy i
went to bali
and extended for another month um
intentionally
just to
heal yeah spend some quality time with
friends and
heal and work on myself and
work through this really really hard
breakup mike did a similar thing with
his trips um i think travel is something
that always brings a lot of uh
peace and happiness into our lives and
um
yeah
yet we've been communicating on a daily
basis
throughout every day since
there has not been a day since since
like it's been months and there's not
been a day that we've gone without
talking to each other because it's very
important to us we're still best friends
it it has been difficult to deal with
this also in front of the camera as you
might
have seen in the past body language i
know you guys have been commenting like
crazy something is off natalie is not
wearing her engagement ring
we see your comments uh
we do understand that you're also
concerned but we just needed some time
to
process to process and to do it right
for us yeah it's not like we just not
like it's not like we just gave up and
so it's not gonna we we really worked
and we really tried and but we just came
to the realization that
it's better for
each of us to
proceed as we are preceding that song so
it can mechanical
um he's an engineer so
see we're still joking yeah i think i
think now we've reached a point or we've
we've worked through this process for so
long that we can just be together be
happy yeah and
look back with happiness at the past yes
and we're at peace
with ourselves and with each other and
with our decision and it took a very
long time to accept but
i think
for now
that's all we have to share uh yeah as
you as you guys did notice we both are
starting to start to pursue our own
passions and our own goals nelly's been
really focusing a lot on nelly's life
and i hope that every single one of you
watching right now heads over subscribes
wrote to 100k
i'm almost in 50k yeah
yeah it makes me very very happy to see
that people also see me as nelly as an
individual doing my own things and
empowering other people especially women
traveling by themselves and just doing
the things that they are passionate
about so i really want to say a big big
thank you for everybody who has
subscribed to my channel and also
supported me along the way i see your
comments i see your messages i
love you so so much this community
is
so much to us and that's why we also
said
that we really want to
do this video because you guys have been
such a huge part of our life and you are
our family
um
i just want to say thank you
that's all
however we
yeah sorry
it's not easy
wait
so it's at this point in time that i
would like to thank today's videos but
it's not just the george that's just the
show that is just a joke um so yes um
we're getting off topic here yeah we're
getting so
we're both pursuing our own goals and
our own passions and at the same time
we're both very supportive and
encouraging about each person's goal me
with the new coffee shop business
nelly's been my um
conciliation for
because we do really value each other's
um opinion and at the same time we are
going to continue to do a few projects
that we've been really passionate and
happy about we're going to continue to
do together
the airbnb that we're opening up
together our real estate in general we
both have really been enjoying it and
we're going to continue to pursue it
um and this is not an end of
us it's just the end of
the relationship of mike and nelly
in in a form that you have known us for
so long we've been together for 14 years
that's a very very long time and we
consider ourselves as soul mates and
best friends so i'd say the the intimate
partnership continues the romantic
partnership yeah not
yeah exactly so
we're still friends we're still good we
still love each other yeah and um
i need a i need a tissue
um what else have likely
been continuously a few questions like
you know what happened to peanuts we
just put out an etsa because it would be
too hard to separate from her
individually there she is joker's side
she's right here
yeah um so yeah um
as mentioned
nelly's going to be focusing a lot on
nelly's life and i'm going to be
focusing a lot on the coffee shop
project but to split up the workload
because we've been a team for so long um
nelly's going to start creating content
for what's up philippines for the
reaction videos and i'm going to focus
on bringing you guys cinematics travel
vlogs food vlogs but also aviation
making it happen aviation mic i've been
planning to do videos uh for a very long
time but he did a cocktail video his
cocktails are getting so good
but kind of this this whole uh thing
took absolute priority over creating
content and so we really took the time
to work on ourselves we took the time
for as many said the conscious
uncoupling
and yeah it's it's
it's been a process it has been a
process
um
everybody who has been through breakups
knows how
crazy it can be and then especially
being in the public eye
is even crazier yeah and at this point
uh we really
do highly appreciate um you guys
continuously respecting our privacy so
um we really don't want to have any
messages concerning this or comments on
the channel this is something that we
went through ourselves personally yeah
um if you just want to send us a few
kind words please we're happy to receive
those kind of messages but anything else
will just be yeah ignored deleted
whatever
[Laughter]
it's so hard to do to do this video
we were feeling very
anxious about this yes very anxious
that's where we but at the same time we
both have been like saying over the past
few
weeks like it's time it needs like we
want to do it it's time to do it it's
time to share this with you guys um we
wanted to have some closure and also
kind of like have a
opportunity to share with you about our
new beginnings and new passions new
i don't know
new things that are coming into our life
that we really
love and if you have been following us
um
on instagram where we shared a little
bit more about that
i think you could sense that we found
things that make us really really happy
as individuals
i personally will go on a few travels
with my friends
i
really enjoyed spending some quality
time with friends that has been so so
good for me
and then also just doing some solo
travel uh i think
the feedback of my el nido series has
been freaking amazing and to be very
honest it has been good to just
you know
take some
time um
for how do i say softkey
yeah i don't have friends so i'm just
going outside so that anybody wants to
travel with you
leave a comment below but not this video
because the comments are turned off
i'm joking i'm joking i'm talking i i do
have friends i just you just went on a
very [ __ ] amazing trip to japan yeah
exactly
yeah yeah i think yeah oh all right guys
no no no questions
because usually i say like if you have
any questions leave them in the comments
down below the comments are off um this
is this is the one
this is the one place in the one time
we're gonna talk about this yeah and
that's also something that i wanted to
mention um
it has been really really hard for us
so
yeah yeah we just want to
share
everything in this video
and yeah
and i think it it also needs to be said
that
in our life ned and i have always
tried to do whatever we do at our
fullest capacity and the best we can do
it and the same was with this breakup we
tried to do it as
as good as possible um for us both as
kind as possible for us both as
individuals and that's why we just had
to keep you in the dark for a little
while for us to figure this out for us
to sort this out um we didn't want to
just go out and say it it's over and
then have this big drama that's not us
everything we do we do with a certain
passion and we do with the integrity and
integrity and that was way more
important to us to sort this out before
we sort
this out
yeah
we're still joking with each other
you can tell it's all good
um
and also something that yeah like we we
we shed a lot of tears together yeah
um but we are
in a good place yeah exactly we and and
i know there's going to be like thoughts
of these kind of things we still remain
business partners we still remain very
close connected we're still very very
close friends and if i ever need anybody
i know i can call ned any time and vice
versa
so
this is not a
separation as human beings this is
purely a separation in the romantic
sense yeah and um we will always be
very close
and grateful for the amazing time that
we had in the past 14 years
it's something that i wanted to mention
especially because there have been a lot
of questions about you know my
engagement ring and
the wedding and everything
and let me just say one thing
we decided or like mike made a really
great suggestion that i'm going to share
very soon um
because
um
i still remember this moment as
something very special in my life and i
just want to
keep it with me yeah and uh yeah that's
all i can say for now
