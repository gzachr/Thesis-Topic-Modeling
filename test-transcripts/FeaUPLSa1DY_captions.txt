ad executive by day an internet star by
night
mccoy dubs is known across the
philippines for his humor
creators like us
more views more engagement
more fame thank you
but all of that depends on whether
mccoy's post reaches fans during social
media's prime time
between 8 and 11 pm every night so my
video
2 minutes and 18 seconds then let's post
so you see
[Music]
i know
[Music]
strong internet connection is very
important
because i always follow the algorithm
of of the social media platform odiba
antagal ganon pago magano
rolio oh you see
and if not i won't be able to
gain the the views the engagement rate
that i need to
do i know to achieve
mccoy is not alone he is one of millions
of filipinos frustrated with an internet
infrastructure
that's outdated unreliable and comically
slow
in a recent study of worldwide broadband
the philippines ranked 100th out of 175
countries with an average download speed
of just under 33 megabits per second
for comparison some of its neighbors at
the top of the list
singapore thailand hong kong all clock
in at
over 200 more than six times faster
one reason for the slow service
geography
the philippines is made up of thousands
of islands
so getting connected to a wired network
is tough
and while mobile should be a viable
alternative
wireless relies on cell towers which are
so expensive to build
that today there's only enough to serve
40 of the population
leaving everyone else searching for a
signal
but there's another reason that when it
comes to connectivity
filipinos are stuck in the 90s
1995 to be exact while match.com paved
the way for online love in america
filipinos were still using pages and
landlines to communicate
so the president fidel ramos launched a
policy to improve the country's
telecommunication network
problem was instead of investing in the
emerging technology of the internet
the policy doubled down on tech that was
about to be obsolete
a company applying for a telecom license
had to promise to build and almost
impossible to achieve
400 000 landlines it eventually became
a barrier to entry it requires
a company to be big enough at least to
to have
the not only the resources but the
temerity to actually go through that
process
the policy made it difficult for any new
company to enter the market
and that consolidated power into the
hands of just a few telecom giants
at a time when demand for connectivity
was heating up
in the internet age you need to have
different
you know networks in many areas and then
they
interconnected each other
[Music]
today a duopoly controls the market
and that means the big companies have no
incentive to make things better
the public's demand to improve their
service is often unheard
a situation described by a lawmaker as
an abuse
if your subscribers do not have any
choice
but to avail your services you can
thrive
even if you don't improve your service
or even if you don't
spend too much on making more investment
or expanding your network
when contacted for comment globe telecom
cited the lengthy permit process
and bureaucratic red tape as the causes
of slow internet service
they also claim to have invested 12
billion us dollars to improve its
network and services
invested all his savings to start a
business
a courier and delivery app that operates
entirely online
or at least it's supposed to start my
internet
our customers are booking online so when
they book online even they don't have
they do have internet in their area
we cannot receive it so once we don't
receive it we cannot serve them
the customer will complain we cannot
even say that
was in a telco provider was in an
internet connection i mean we deal with
that
that's a big frustration
[Music]
for christian patchy internet service
can mean the loss of as much as 1 000
u.s
dollars per week that's a big money that
we cannot lose
in what's become a daily occurrence
christian follows up with his service
provider
[Applause]
it's very difficult for them to be
contacted so
i just dropped the call a lot of
business will experience this one so not
just only for
our company
[Music]
unreliable internet does not only hurt
the economy
with covert 19 stay-at-home restrictions
it's also putting the future of the
country at risk
susanna's children and 24 million others
are now learning online
is
and one and when goes october two us
dollars can buy the family one week of
data
or two kilos of rice education wins over
hunger in the librea family
the problem is
foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
so what is the solution to help society
move forward
the number one solution is the
government they have the power they have
the they have the authority to create
new policy new law for us to be able to
have a good internet connection here in
the philippines
with the pandemic pushing filipinos to
the limit president duterte
is responding to the outcry with a
threat to the telcos
i might just as well close all of you
to make it services commercially
available to the public by march 2021
two months later lawmakers allowed a new
telco to build a network
the company is owned by the president's
friend
[Music]
but with an outdated policy intact
many say nothing will change it's a
no-brainer
those who benefit from from the status
quo the outdated policy
simply do not want them to change
because
it is what makes them thrive i guess
[Music]
you
