silence wedding night
[Applause]
that was for you
you know i'm really curious are you too
competitive with each other
yeah in sports you know in school we are
on track together and he always wins
yeah that's because you always stop
halfway to take a nap get it
in the hair get it yeah yeah winston we
get it
i'm the best at telling jokes by the way
petunia not as good as me
what makes you say that

first up so let's set the standard thank
you

nervous to be back on agt
um yeah a little also right it's gonna

[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]

[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
all the judges stand up this is a
different darcy lynn
than the darcy lind who won america's
got talent two years ago
you walk out here like a seasoned
professional and
you are the epitome of a dream coming
true thank you
well i have to say oscar
you have won my heart with that no way
and i really do hope the super fans vote
for you tonight
i really do because we've thoroughly
enjoyed watching it tonight so thank you
thank you thank you
i am so happy that you're back for
america's got town champions
because you honestly one of the most
unique
talents you really are so special thank
you
i was literally blown away by that
apart from being so charming and funny
you've actually got this incredible
singing voice
thank you but you've got this killer
competitive instinct as well and that's
what makes you stop
there are only two spaces in the final
and
i think you deserve to be the world
championship
then i got the call to be a wild card
i am grateful to have another chance to
win this competition
but it's also like terrifying
how am i gonna come back and blow the
roof off the place
i would definitely consider petunia my
lucky charm
she helped me get the golden buzzer she
helped me win
season 12. and she is a diva
and she likes to win
but there's only one winner
i'm not gonna let it go
my carrots oh my carrots
oh my carrots what look at all these
people
hey all you look there up there up there

this for so many reasons is your best
ever performance you've ever given i
mean
it's hard enough at your age to sing
opera
but you're doing it through a rabbit
i think you may win tonight
mel b do you agree oh my gosh of course
i agree i mean
just your delivery and your confidence
because you are
self-taught and you've worked so hard to
get this far you deserve
everything and much much more

performance
it was truly amazing because we didn't
know you sing opera you've gone through

shot at this tonight
