[Music]
and i am tired today mainly because of
ramadan i don't have a lot of energy so
i do not want to react to something too
serious or too complicated and that is
why i chose to react to
will dasovich's vlog
video
called filipino versus spanish language
similarities hilarious
um it's crazy man if i didn't know that
will dasavich was half filipino i think
when you read the name wild dasovich you
would never think that this person is
filipino
at all at all i mean will will will is
just like will smith you know it's just
a regular
i don't know
western name
and dasovich
sounds more russian right so where is
the filipino in that but i think he's
half filipino
um
there you go but before we start make
sure to follow me on instagram at music
game news because that is where you can
dm your suggestions and if you guys are
nice tomorrow and hopefully if also i
have energy tomorrow i can um
try to compile a bunch of those uh viral
filipino singers on tik tok videos uh
and make a reaction out of it again
because that was a lot of fun and
apparently you guys really enjoyed it
um all right let's get to it
one two three
this is the spain spanish verse filipino
spanish hamon
[Music]
well as you may know you know spanish
and filipino have a lot of similarities
and i've reacted to a couple of videos
where they compare the two but this is a
brand new one hopefully they'll have
more interesting words to compare
and this is the spanish verse filipino
challenge or the spain spanish verse
filipino spanish challenge or the
similarities between spain spanish and
filipino spanish chop something like
that we have spent the last two weeks
together and we realized our languages
are why did they have why did they spend
the last two weeks together or the last
few weeks together hmm
are quite similar have a lot of the same
words almost the same but different
let's jump into it how are you
[Music]
with an s i would say
because i'm from the south
but in spain normally you say come estas
you have to
i mean
i went to cuba and dominican republic i
know it's not spain but they speak
spanish and they say como estas como
estas como estas you use the lesbo
no i say comata because we don't say
that you almost don't say the s in the
south we don't but
yeah standard spanish would be
i want to bring the lisp to the
philippines and say come on
enough with the list
i like it it makes you sound elegant i
think you know okay next word
alone
sorry i'm half filipino it's my second
language there you go half filipino have
my mom come here i need to double check
is it pantalone or pantalones
yeah for us it's only pantalon there's
no pantalones what time is it
yeah i understand spanish okay so we
have oras well i understand spanish more
than filipino that's the only word we
are similar in that
la mesa
[Music]
so
in spanish to the table la
mesa
yeah it's funny but it's like j-e-s
but the pronunciation yes
yes but it's just
tres cuatro
and then i don't know anything else
after that i'm bringing that back
like pilipino almost yeah sometimes yeah
oh not sometimes always man the f
becomes a p
sometimes it's weird actually now that
you say that wait say that again
i feel like when you say you just sound
rich oh really
i feel like
she just speaks rich people filipino you
know
yeah basically
[Music]
no
[Music]
[Music]
oh it's not the same not at all
i met this guy in colombia and he asked
my logo is and i told him it's a chongo
which means monkey and filipino and he
said oh it's the same thing in colombia
that's probably because
in spain and latin america there's a lot
of words that change a lot and we
actually don't understand them a lot of
the time so maybe it's a thing there for
us it's just mono
mona and feminine
yeah the same just not written the same
way z and s
but no z not with a z yes
so you just remove our lisp
[Laughter]
and in arabic it's sabbat sabbat zapatos
don't you guys spell it with the z yeah
it's zapatos so in spain you say zapatos
but in latin america they really zapatos
i guess ours is the same as latin
america zapatos
[Music]
yeah magic okay we have medias
and we have calcetines
is what we call socks melias for me
would be tights but in latin america
medias is
socks there you go
so you see i think he should have done
this video with someone from latin
america
not from spain sounds like uh filipinos
have more in common with countries from
latin america
not just so you don't have caffeine no
that's like that's where you eat right
mom
or something
canteen
[Laughter]
garenderia do you have that that's where
you eat
no is it canteen you don't have
carenderia
okay so you have longanisa and you have
tofino that i'm not speaking like you
see no
casino
and uh you don't have a dubbo
that's so funny
[Music]
what about fruits like monsanas
oh ours has an s
well for us if it's plural we say yeah
if ours is plural it's manga mansana and
if it's a small apple wow
if it's a small apple manzanilla no
monsanto i didn't i just learned that
right now
it's pumpkin pumpkin you have calabasas
i thought there was a little candle is
pumpkin and calabafin is like little
pumpkin it's zucchini do you have
calamansi
it's a filipino lemon basically
it's like a miniature lemon lime i don't
think we have it no wow we're going down
the rabbit hole from kalamansi to
kalamantin to calabasa
i don't even know
basically speak the same language
basically it's pretty close
[Music]
red cheese
or mantas or is it
rather than the bad sheets is what you
put then after the bad sheets you put it
on top but then you remove it when you
go to sleep does
mean cover cover so
means
yeah so it's a bad cover but it's not
the sheets for us okay
[Music]
oh that's like past tense
i understand yeah that's so funny
because entiendo means i understand no
do you understand for us if i want to
say do you understand i would say
entiendes and you will reply entiendo so
he's like the other way around damn
interesting yeah
i remember people were saying like oh
you should learn spanish because you
know filipinos so it's like similar but
for me it's just more confusing because
you know
you know it but it's different it just
sounds the same yeah i was really
surprised because i didn't know filipino
has so many spanish words until i moved
to dubai and then i was always
surrounded by a lot of filipinos and i
would hear spanish words and i'd be like
wait why are they speaking spanish and
then i realized no it's just they have
so many similar words it's so
interesting yeah when it when and listen
to you and your friends speak it's like
every fourth word i catch it
[Music]
or something
[Music]
right
uh in arabic is soccer
and i think in filipinos probably also
hey i didn't see you there well now that
you're here um why don't you celebrate
uh for making it this far into this
video by subscribing to the channel by
turning on that notification bell so
that you don't miss any future videos
and of course and the most important
thing to like this video because it does
help out the channel tremendously
and now if you don't mind i'm going to
go back to my business
with an l wow it's actually an arab
world it's like zukar or something
[Music]
i don't know why they decided to change
sunday okay linga newspaper
periodical
yeah okay so the audio for us could be
periodical newspaper or it could be a
diary like a journal
you know journal is cuaderno juano for
us means a notebook yeah rather than
journal that you write daily that's the
addi okay
which one is it
i guess that's the same paper
but plural for us is manga papel we
don't add s like americans or spanish do
you just add manga before the word manga
manga
so libro book is that the same yeah i'm
just looking at whatever manga
instead of libros
wow
but it's easier is it easier to add the
s at the end or the
uh
at the beginning
[Music]
oh really well it sounds like bench
banco bench
or
[Music]
but the way you say it sounds totally
latin american they would say
then j they pronounce it in certain
countries they say
instead
okay and we say
the months ago
i don't i can't i can't do it
i don't know the month
this is where my filipino gets weak mom
okay ready go start from start from
january go okay
pedro
they all sounds the same spanish and
filipino fun okay thank you
again it's just the rich way to say
no it's just filipinos transforming the
f's into peace influencia seriously
influenza
i might get roasted though because you
know again it's my second language i'm
not like the best at pronouncing but
it's pretty much the same at least you
speak it's like the language exactly to
all the americans out there who make fun
of me you only know one language
same exactly
no no sorry i'm speaking spanish
i'm sorry i'm saying yeah okay
[Music]
okay
and filipino espares
[Music]
[Music]
nyon is now mismo right now yeah same
thing
like right now but hey house tv show
drama
tell us
they have tele
[Music]
television
[Laughter]
and yeah you guys also love to transform
the v into a b or a b into a v
teeth it's close to french lid
wow that's long or just
to sweep the floor while it's thinking
can you say brush succlay suckling
because we call that the bu so we have
to specify is toothbrush not just the
brush
ah there you
i've heard that term before supply
[Music]
it's like more like a butter for us
cooking like a paste
like animal fat and stuff we will call
that manteca
we have montequilia
we have two that's margarine
it's like a bad word in filipino
right is it bad can you use it no we
have to use it within a bigger sentence
you would say someone's got malality
like buttermilk if they're very rude or
like very angry you say malaliche or you
can use it to say attola leche like
going very fast but leche on its own
it's just milk well i said
yeah that's the yeah i'm sure that's the
same international
so
leche in filipino is a bad word
[Laughter]
[Music]
it's an interjection you used to say
it's not a bad wording
in tagalog right
my mom's rich friends say that word they
say
but how i
hear it more commonly used is like when
someone's rich and upper class and
they're all like
they're like fancy or whatever it's like
oh they're so conyo
yeah completely opposite does not mean
wow we would use it like
you know it's like an interjection yeah
but it means that okay or you can say
get going
what the hell are you saying or what the
hell are you doing we can add that to
the sentence it's basically the f word
for uh for the spanish
make it more dramatic but it's
definitely a bad word in spanish you
would not say that in front of your kids
no what the f are you doing no
filipinas don't use that word around
your spanish friends or do what or yeah
or
i think that's it this is the spain
spanish verse filipino spanish spanish
challenge whatever you hang on
a lot of new importance
i'm going to start speaking
spain spanish in my filipino
language so that i can sound yeah cool
like that

um
voila voila we've done it uh it was a
fun video i'm pretty sure that will
dasovich does not edit his videos his
own videos you know because he's he's
he's big man he's got like what three
channels two channels i know that he has
one with millions of uh
of subscribers and his vlog channel
does he did he reach the million already
on it or not yet
because i know he opened like a vlog
channel on the side
yeah almost almost he's at 992
000 subscribers so he's almost gonna
you know reach the million but he also
has a main channel will dasovich
who has reached
let's see
which okay i'm pretty sure he's got like
at least 3 million on this one almost
almost
2.74
million
i wonder
okay
yeah i wonder why he decided to open a
vlog a secondary vlog channel
maybe
he was scared you know just in case they
close his first channel i don't know
because you never know youtube you know
but he has a second channel but he also
i mean his first channel was also
vlogs
so i don't know i don't know it's it's
little oh
he's got a video with the
nas i finally met nice daily and this is
what happened
ah because there was like some kind of
beef between the two
interesting interesting
yeah uh so i was saying his first
channel also you know is filled with
vlogs but he decided to open a second
one with with vlogs i don't know it's a
little confusing
but yeah this is confirmation that uh
spanish
and filipino are very similar languages
so
you guys should spend time trying to
learn spanish and spanish people should
spend time trying to learn filipino you
know because of the similarities
um
voila
