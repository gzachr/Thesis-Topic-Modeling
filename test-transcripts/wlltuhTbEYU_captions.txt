okay so we are going into a german
restaurant that is called broadside so
it's cool it's really like
anti-social because it's social
distancing and you just look at your
phone
george and mike having a little date
yeah
very nice
so this is a social distancing
gathering kind of i just said to lucy i
can't
wrap my head around it good morning guys
what's going on i hope you're all having
a fantastic
day today lily and i are shortly gonna
head over to bgc
because we forgot something important
that we needed to get from the hardware
store and while we're over there we're
gonna
grab a little bite to eat with george
and lucy which is going to be nice
and it's going to be the first time
eating at a restaurant because seemingly
there is a place on bgc high street
that allows uh eating outside of the
restaurant
they have like some sort of social
distancing set up
i'm not quite sure what to think of it
right now george and lucy told us
yesterday that there is a spot where we
can eat so we're going to check it out
today but before we get into today's
vlog
a lot of you guys responded to our post
a few days ago
saying you know which camera equipment
that we're using you guys asked how do
we edit
our vlogs so it is a happy coincidence
that today's vlog is sponsored by
filmora which is a video editing
software and nelly will tell you a
little bit
more about filmora guys i received so
so many messages concerning how i edit
my pictures and how we edit our videos
and today i'm breaking these silence
so the good news is it's not that
complicated uh
you just have to start doing so um thank
you so much for today's sponsor filmora
femora is a video editing software
it's super easy to edit your videos it's
just
drag and drop and it's super intuitive
and it's free
so i thought i'll give you a little a
little insight
um how i do my videos and maybe you guys
know we started our new channel what's
up philippines
so i started uh editing more videos
which is really cool so i can help out
mike
uh he can focus on the vlogs i also see
that a lot of you guys want to
make a little family movie of your
vacation or just post on instagram
so i'll give you a one minute
a quick intro um so you can do it at
home
okay so the thing that i was most afraid
of is to get started because i felt like
i was
um overwhelmed with technical stuff and
that i need
so much time to learn video editing and
that's something that put me off
for a very long time so i will walk
a few steps through with you just to
show you how easy
it is to get started and you can
practice at home
so okay ready let's go
alright here we go we choose our files
and drag and drop it into the program
take the files you want to edit and drag
it into the timeline below
next step is the music these are mostly
b-roll scenes with no
talking so you can choose the music
within filmora and you can easily just
add it to the timeline per drag and drop
i will lower the original volume on my
shots because it's only captured the
surrounding sound and we don't need that
in my case
now we will trim our shots with the
scissors icon and try to have different
perspectives of the walking shot
as you can see i can just delete the
empty room and put the clips easily
together
i want to add a font for the intro so
the viewer knows what it is about
so you can just add your personal
favorite in the title section
and here we go so this was shaka cafe in
shogao island
i can adjust the font to my liking and i
want to highlight the
location and you can also align the
title a little bit
so i'll just choose my preference in the
color wheel down here
and voila this is what the little
animation looks like
if you're a fan of transitions you can
easily add some styles per drag and drop
to your video
let's see how this looks in the preview
nice let's edit
play yep i like it
what i also like to do is to give the
video a color grading
i prefer a slightly cinematic look if
it's too much
you can just adjust the intensity to
your liking
and since i want this look throughout
the whole video i will put the color
effect on top
so everything that is below will get the
color grading
and you can switch the little eye icon
on the left
to see how it looks with and without the
color grading
once you're done with everything you
just have to click export and that's
it super easy so the good thing with
filmora is
you have a lot of video effects in the
program
uh you have video effects you have stock
footage which is very important when
you're looking for a very specific scene
let's say you want to have
a scene where a bird is flying but you
haven't filmed it um so you can find it
there
you have the audio or something that is
super super important for video editing
because
um as you guys know music is
one of the most important factors in our
vlogs it gives you that feeling
that vibe so let's say you want island
vibe so you want more like guitar
playing
or if you want if you have epic drone
shots you want to have something that is
more like cinematic
and of course you can add some pictures
as well and
zoom in or zoom out so that's a very
nice feature and it's all
in one program so you don't have to you
know
leave the program and search for it it's
all in here
okay so there are a lot of reasons why i
can really highly recommend this editing
software
especially for beginners it's super easy
it's very intuitive
and it's super affordable compared to
other editing softwares that
cost a lot of money so huge thank you
for filmora
for sponsoring today's video i'm really
happy that i can share some insights
with you guys
help you out with your vacation videos
or just family videos which is super
important
um if you want to capture your memories
and
yeah you will find the download link in
my description in our description down
below
so check it out it's free and let me
know send me your uh
creations tag me on instagram if you
found something and edited something
with filmora please let me do if you did
so and
yeah let's continue with the vlog
so it's been really tremendous help uh
that mellie's been able to edit vlogs as
well lately it's been
taking a lot of workload off me because
i used to edit all the vlogs nelly edits
the reaction
videos now which is really cool and i
know a lot of you guys want to make
videos about your trips your travels
your memories
and uh filmora is just one of those
options it's an inexpensive editing
software
and you can just use your smartphone to
film and
that use that to edit so you don't have
to spend a ton of money to get great
videos but
if you guys want to see more of how we
film our vlogs of course we've got
the links in the description down below
everything from like
drone camera gopros which gopros that we
use i've been using gopros a lot lately
and all that good stuff
uh today our oven is being picked up so
we need to get that ready right now
and then we're gonna head over to bgc
and yeah
let's get this day going oh by the way
guys i ordered some coffee from toby's
because i ran out of milk
and i went downstairs and i forgot my
mask
and it was so crazy i was standing in
the elevator and all of a sudden i
realized that my mask is not on
and i felt so naked i felt so
weird moving around without masks so i
was like covering myself
up and then i ran back into the
apartment to get my mask but
it's so weird how the the human mind
changes so fast
and what's weird um i thought about this
yesterday night
uh when i went to bed because i i saw a
meme
where somebody says like keys wallet and
then he's like
mask and he's running back so um i know
there is a
fine uh for not wearing masks in manila
but i would feel
so guilty not putting on my mask
yeah i just felt bad now i was like oh
no i was like i had even i was just
going down to get the
coffee from the grab driver but i just
[Music]
couldn't
[Music]
get oh
this was so good so our album is on the
way to its own
uh to its own new owner i can't talk
anymore sorry
makes me really happy because this woman
is a single mom
has two kids lost her job and now she
can
cook and bake and make a living from it
so
makes me so happy
[Music]
so we have two options we can eat
outside or inside
here is
okay so we are going into a german
restaurant that is called broadside so
you have to stand here first
[Music]
so this is cool there's like a qr code
that you scan yeah yeah so then it opens
up the link
[Music]
here and then you put in your health
declaration
so it's all online that's pretty good
tracking
yeah it's contact contact creation nice
[Music]
[Music]
so it's cool it's really like
anti-social because it's social
distancing
and you just look at your phone you can
definitely say this restaurant is german
yes heartsleek will comment i think
there's even a broadside in austria that
we used to go to
yeah this is german efficiency like this
whole thing
this whole situation
george and mike having a little date
yeah
yeah very nice
just stay your side what will dating be
like actually
when we all get back to dating new
people
like actual dating it's gonna be weird
[Laughter]
it looks like we are all craving some
sausages
so i'm going to order my favorite which
is the
kitty cleaner it's sausage filled with
cheese
one sausage crafted touche because it
comes with the cheese sausage
the vice versa the garlic pork sausage
it comes with everything you want and
the sauerkraut
i need sauerkraut i need a potato salad
i need beer
[Laughter]
[Music]
i think all four of us uh
made it a rule to just drink on the
weekend
yeah yeah pretty much
but this is the base it's to not drink
during the week i think that's a
must drink you just drink a week that's
all you do
so this is a social distance distancing
gathering
kind of okay i'm actually really really
happy that
the menu is online on your own phone
it's something that you touch every day
and we disinfect it all the time so we
don't have to touch
other menu parts menus how do you say
menus
yeah yeah
[Music]
um
from a distance that's something you say
in german so we're going to
have a sip of german vice pier if you
guys
watch the oktoberfest video you might
know that i can take a lot of
this
okay so we have to get used to this
whole
dining experience because there's a wall
in between me and lucy
um and it's just it's just
so different i just said to lucy i can't
wrap my head
around it because it's it's such a
different experience it's nice though
that we can sit together but it's
different it's nothing that we that we
were used to
it's just like kind of a cool experience
[Music]
thank you
so it's really weird for me to be here
and like taking off my mask and eating
food
i don't even know how this is possible
but
it is the way it is and so we love to
eat sausages in austria
and germany it's the same thing so we've
been craving
some really nice sausages and now we
finally have some
oh look at that it's like a medley
and we have some pretzels
nice should we take should i should i
give it a try yeah
so how how is it talking to george it's
good
it's okay yeah can you hear him
so all right we have here like a medley
of sausage i'm just going to go for the
bratwurst because there's two
nice german mustard
and then i'm going to grab a pretzel
here
oh yeah
you know sometimes we really love being
in the philippines
but sometimes you miss foods from at
home
i'm sure a lot of you guys that live
abroad know the feeling
there's certain foods that you just
missed that you can't get
so this is just nice so one thing that i
have been missing
is potato salad
[Music]
that's that's an austrian classic
and it's just it's so good it's really
good it's
cooked and then just mix with some
vinegar and salt and usually you have
some red onions in it
[Music]
[Music]
really good okay guys how was
the restaurant experience good yeah it
was quite hard to hear each other
yeah the glass screen it was it was
almost like normal life was
back but then you realize there's you're
wearing a mask there's a screen in front
of
each other we're cleaning the cutlery
yeah we're separated out
uh but really nice to see you guys yeah
and do something a little bit normal
yes until we walk back outside and
realize everything's still
very strange but yeah it was good but
that restaurant i was just saying our
vlog that restaurant
really took precautions yeah in keeping
us safe and keeping the staff safe as
well
yeah and we just discovered that this
restaurant up there works
uh it's doing the same thing same time
tomorrow
see ya all right guys
we always do this like three times
[Laughter]
by the way guys if we would all be
avengers what would we be
in your opinion let us know in the
comments down below why are you asking
mike
because somebody sent us a message
saying they think that
i'm though yeah i think they meant the
fat one from
endgame lucy lucy was black widow yeah
how do you feel about that
it's fine he's got many powers
underrated
he is underrated and he's funny yeah
yeah
it's always good to be funny if you
can't be anything else
to be
they must be og viewers yeah there we go
all right okay
now we can
[Music]
[Laughter]
so i got this really really cute
delivery look at this
wow it's dried flowers i have some
really
nice lavender um so
oh it's so good and oh this is from a
small company called
higger living i'll link it down below
and i got a mirror
oh so nice i'm so excited isn't that
like a
swedish term for living comfortably yes
yes
scandinavian
[Music]
i think it's in general look at this
it's so good oh
very nice very nice look guys it's you
yes it's you um so the next few vlogs
will also be
a little bit about decorating and just
you know getting
sorting things out at home which is
really nice so
i'm so excited about that uh we just got
back and
uh 100 so nice to be able to
go out and have a bite to eat with
friends i don't know how this restaurant
portside actually does it
because i thought there is no dining in
at the moment but they have
stringent safety protocols so you have
to fill out this whole questionnaire
before
for the contact tracing and then they
have these plexiglas
windows between each of their customers
each of us had a whole section of the
bench
dedicated to us so everybody had their
own bench
and uh yeah very
very good safety protocols actually i i
wish life would always be like this
because i'm a bit of a germaphobe i must
say every now and then
so seeing uh everything being sanitized
constantly and
having these strict protocols is really
nice um and besides that oh besides that
um it was really nice to just
you know meet our friends and socialize
even though we were socially distancing
which is really good for the soul i
think it doesn't come out in the vlogs
lately very often how
close friends george and lucy are we
literally have
a whatsapp group and we're talking to
each other every single day
yeah like through this whole quarantine
the past three months we'd be
in contact at least once a day and it's
just so nice to have our friends close
by now
again so really really cool um
i hope you guys enjoyed this video it's
like a whole new
world from what we've had in the past
three months which is really nice
we got a few very exciting food vlogs
