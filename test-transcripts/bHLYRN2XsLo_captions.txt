good morning guys and welcome to a brand
new vlog from the road finally
my road trip from manila to chagao has
started and my first stop on this trip
is actually the petron gas station here
at eslex get a full tank of gas that
will
kind of take me to the very first stop
of today's trip or the first stop of
this entire trip which is going to be
naga city in camarines
i'm going to make a few stops on the way
i know already i've driven this route
many times by car so i know how
beautiful it is i'm so so excited to get
on the open road it's just me my bike
and the road and obviously you guys
coming along for the journey so we're
all fueled up and ready to go so let's
hit the road
is
[Music]
maybe
[Music]
all right guys first little stop on this
route is
uh we're just here in the quezon
province and i just passed by
these beautiful
rice fields here it is so so so
stunning and beautiful and i was so
lucky with the weather so far because it
was raining so much the past few days
that's why i postponed the strip but you
look at it right now it is so so
stunningly beautiful
hello
the people here in the province are so
nice it's so stunningly beautiful
i think as i proceed a little bit more
south it's going to get a little bit
rainy but
hello
but the bike
has been so nice to ride i don't even
notice the extra weight with these cases
on here
and i have
a lot of gear with me i mean this bike
is loaded up to the brim
and it's so dry it's so smoothly so
nicely
ah look at this view
so nice and i just actually realized i
stopped here and i thought to myself you
know what let me fly the drone for a
second
and then i realized i forgot the drone
at home
which is hugely annoying but
in actual fact i did want to get a
smaller drone so once i arrive in naga
city today i'll go to the mall and
hopefully
there's a few electronic stores uh one
of them which will carry
an actual drone so
let's see if that works out i think the
next thing that i need right now is
coffee i think we're gonna need to sort
out the truck
i don't think i'm gonna find the
starbucks but yeah coffee for sure

all right guys big update from the road
we have actually arrived in
pico pretty much i mean uh
we just arrived at the other side of the
coast we are at the water and it is
absolutely
beautiful here check this out
ah it is so nice
to be
by the water again
hello
let's eat
thank you
oh it is so pretty here
and it started just raining a little bit
a while ago but it was really just so
little that i didn't really get wet and
it already stopped so now it's just the
road that's a little bit moist and
otherwise
it is stunning wow
it just started absolutely pouring down
here and luckily i was just next to
just next to it looks like an old petrol
station with a sea with a little bit of
a roof so
i just parked underneath here till the
rain
stops overcomes less um i'll probably
put on my rain gear now i actually only
need rain pants because this motorcycle
jacket is waterproof so
i don't think it's gonna be too bad but
i'm gonna let it pull down for a little
bit now
ah looking good
it is
pouring down again it is this weather is
appalling today uh so i pulled over for
a quick pit stop at a petrol station to
have lunch today and lunch today is
going to be an rx bar and coffee is
going to be a cliff coffee shop because
there's no way i can go it is raining so
hard
these are my options for today i mean
i'm underneath the roof even underneath
this roof i'm getting soaked
so
just no good way to do this
i'll just have lunch here
don't wait for the moment
[Music]
all right it seems like a truck is
broken down here in the middle of the
construction site which has caused
absolute traffic
havoc
like for around
10 kilometers going this way luckily
with the motorbike i can just drive past
it
or like this guy in his jungle i used to
drive faster as well
ooh but this is like the difficult part
because
it's slippy
and grass and my bike is pretty heavy
let's see if i can get past here
oh my god guys you can see the tip of my
own volcano back there
even though it's so far away that is so
awesome
look i mean just look how beautiful it
is here it's insanely beautiful
yes
and we have made it to
camarines lotte
gateway to be called londia
it just keeps going on and on for like
these guys are gonna be smudgier for
four or five hours at least
[Music]
[Music]
wow we have arrived here
in naga what a drive
what an easy going drive that was so so
fast i felt like i mean i have been
driving for seven hours but it felt more
like a maybe three or four hour ride
it feels like a time travel anyway i
arrived here now at the hotel that i
booked for tonight
so i can get checked in have a shower
get changed park the motorcycle and then
explore in naga for a little bit which
i'm super duper excited about guys if
