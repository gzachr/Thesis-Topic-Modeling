oh
all right guys
that's officially done
that was a delayed report of marriage to
the Philippine Embassy you guys were
wondering
why people think that my wife's
Blacklist is because we never submitted
that forever
and all I gotta say is yeah it's it's
you know it's my fault
it's me me and the wife's fault and it's
mostly mine because she's been on my
butt for years to get this done and I
didn't do it the last time
getting distracted procrastinating and
then getting carried away with other
tasks
you can care of the kids doing this and
that and then you just lose sight and
then you just keep moving on to the next
thing and that's that's really my
problem in lots and lots of things is um
procrastinating
or are getting
um you know sidetracked big time
but yeah
hopefully that clears up lots of the
questions because uh people really
believe that she's blacklisted and she's
not
