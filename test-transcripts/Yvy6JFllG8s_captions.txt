weird day in manchester it's
partly rainy partly sunny but
inside of me it's sunny so that's all
that matters um right now i'm at
the alley picking up some sourdough
bread
and then later on i want to show you
something that
absolutely blew my mind yesterday
it's it's hard to describe it in words i
have to show it to you so
stay tuned thank you
thank you

long already

yeah okay let me play
this
that's the first time that the cat comes
to me
as well
okay maybe she just came for the food
no idea what mike ordered but it's a lot
oh my god oh my goodness
[Applause]

is a
cake delivery from me waiting at the
lobby hello

was dozing off like a second ago so

okay tired looking okay i can't wait to
show you what i got
[Music]
peanut is definitely happy about the box
that she got
yeah that's your candle now right
[Laughter]
okay this is actually super interesting
peanut was just uh
trying the cake or the flowers on the
cake and as soon as we came closer she
pretended
like she was not interested at all but
she
she wants to know what it is
no
okay it's actually the next day and
george and lucy are coming by they
brought us some coffee and i thought
why not just bring the cake and blow out
the candles together
um to have a little bit of feeling of
celebration so yeah now they
are waiting outside and uh we'll give
them a piece of the cake
[Music]

where are your ear yes
[Music]
okay so guys here is a reality check
quarantine birthdays are very different
and definitely memorable ones
i haven't vlogged that much during my
birthday just because i
felt a little bit sad that you know i
can't be with my friends i can't be with
my family
and i try to catch up with everybody
and just also take some time off for
myself to
reflect on the year what happened and
it was kind of ah very different
very very different but i have to say
that
um it made my day that i got woken up by
a kiss
from mike and then george and lucy
dropped by to
blow out the candle with me or like
with me also mike prepared a very very
delicious brunch
that we had and i had some wine with it
which was really nice
and then we just watched some tv series
in bed
with with peanut and that was my
birthday there were a lot of special
moments during
throughout the day and it's the little
things that add up and at the end of the
day
i went to bed with a smile and for the
very first time in a very very long time
i went to bed before midnight which was
really really great i'm very thankful
for a new kind of
birthday experience i also got three
birthday cakes from the pinay baker
so thank you so much for sending those
to me she messaged me a few weeks ago
saying hey i really want to send you a
birthday cake and since
you know i'm not a good baker i said yes
and
i really really love them they were
super delicious and also slightly
guilt-free
i also got hundreds of messages and
i could barely keep keep up replying but
because it was just so so much and i'm
really grateful that there are people
out there who
thought of me that day and made me feel
very very special on my birthday at home
we were
very limited with the movement since
mike had his surgery the week before
i also didn't really feel like
celebrating too much because
it was just a bad timing but we said as
soon as mike is feeling better we're
going to head out somewhere and have
i don't know a nice dinner or something
or like
plan in a little getaway but yeah that
was it
that was the vlog for today a very
low-key casual
from at home from my birthday experience
during the quarantine
and it's definitely one for the books i
hope i'll see you guys tomorrow same
time simply remember to stay awesome
be positive and make it happen
[Music]
bye
[Music]
you
