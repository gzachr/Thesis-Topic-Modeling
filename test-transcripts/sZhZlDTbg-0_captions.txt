Filipino snacks Filipino candy and we're
just gonna jump right in and try
different kinds of snacks we have no
idea what to expect how it's gonna taste

can't smell much of a Oh
very sticky very sweet it's a little bit
like granola yes Rice Krispies salah

is experiment
[Music]
Wow so what is this we'll roll with this
kid it gives me the floor
so the nicely packaged and single little
wax paper packages oh it's very crummy
so this seems to be like egg white maybe
egg whites with sugar and then it's
baked
[Music]
oh yeah
oh yeah eat the whole thing with it okay
meeting the whole thing yeah it's very
dry but it's good it was too sweet
yeah exactly my taste
I think milk or tea what
yeah I don't see this as much like there
are eggs on the street like that's fish
balls those are the popular streets but
this is it yeah is it sweet or is it
savory it's a surprise now that you say
it means yeah first I wanted to say nuts
but it doesn't taste nothing like a
little bit of a deep a
all the very nice because it's not too
sweet
it almost tastes healthy no there's a
lot of spices that you guys can taste a
lot of spices it say in English with
inside Oh what is Mungo variation of the
hope yeah but it's not nice and the
texture is very different you wanna see
