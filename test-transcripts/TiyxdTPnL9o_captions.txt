when you flip these trays of flan you
got to just be super confident when you
approach this task work super fast and
go right into it the whole flan inside
the donut situation i don't know how i
came up with it honestly i think what it
came down to was they wouldn't be
actually experiencing the flan unless
there was an actual
[Music]
when we start prep on wednesdays the
first thing we do is make the dough
we are starting on our brioche show
basically this recipe is the base for
all of our donuts depending on the
flavor we'll change it up a little bit
we'll add cocoa powder for our chocolate
and ube extract for ubedo so kevin is
our co-founder and he's also the
operations director here at cora he's
gonna go ahead and get the eggs in he
actually takes over all of our doughs
now next we have milk and you can see
there's ice in here brioche tends to
proof very quickly because of the sugar
content and if brioche or any bread for
that matter proofs too quickly or too
much it starts to develop like this
alcoholic flavor and smell and it's just
not pleasant so we figured that to slow
down the process to have pretty much all
of our ingredients cold so we're going
with the flour and we use two different
types and they have two different
percentages of gluten i like to have a
really really fluffy donut a donut with
a little bit of bite in it and so we
found that this balance of flowers this
ratio of flowers has given us like the
lightest fluffiest donut
right now i'm just performing something
called the windowpane test on our dough
to see that the gluten has developed the
point of this is to see how elastic the
dough is
the more elastic a dough is the more air
it can hold in from the gases that are
being released by the yeast as it's
proofing
culture has their version of donuts this
donut is similar to foam bellini dough
it's honestly almost exactly the same
the process is so similar
before i started this donut business i
don't even remember the last time i had
a donut in my life the fact that i'm
doing this as a my full-time job these
days
it just really makes me laugh
currently we do only offer pickup and
everything that we produce currently
during the week is already paid for and
available for pre-order i think one of
the biggest challenges uh with running a
business with this model i guess a
pre-order model is that being that
everything is already paid for you're
kind of like on the hook for it for some
reason chef gets sick and she can't come
in or the dough is not reacting properly
you know it's one of the struggles
okay so now we're gonna degas our doughs
they've been resting in the fridge for a
couple hours and see how nice and fluffy
they are they've doubled in size so we
just wanna take that excess gas out of
them if you
allow this to just keep puffing up and
it might puff up so much that it'll just
push the top right open and then the
dough will start to dry out and crust so
we don't want that we can only do so
much but at the end of the day the doe
is going to do whatever it wants it's a
living breathing thing
understanding how doe reacts to its
environment and how you work with it is
such an art i mean it's it's a science
really
we have this machine over here that we
call r2d2 and what that machine does for
us is it portions dough into 36 balls
brioche joe because of its high fat
content it's got so much butter in it
and lots of whole milk and eggs it
actually lasts longer than your typical
yeast raised donuts
take this over here
and a lot of people ask why we don't use
the big cans
for some reason
condensed milk in
volume is like hard to find that doesn't
have the fillers in it
we are making the flan now filipino flan
is really different from maybe the flans
you've had in spain or in other latin
american countries because it's got a
lot a lot a lot of egg yolks
so i'm just going to get this nice and
smooth i just want to get rid of like
big pieces of egg and get it nice and
homogeneous now when my grandma used to
make this she actually would take all of
the eggs
and she would put it through a
cheesecloth and that's how she would
strain it with her hands
got cristiano when mike cooks she's
emptying some condensed milk and
evaporated milk
[Music]
coming through hot
if it doesn't fully coat the bottom of
the tray your your flan is going to be
like naked in some parts they're not
going to have that nice even color
across the entire flan if the caramel
itself on the tray is not level then
when you bake your custard it's not
going gonna be leveled you gotta work
super fast
[Music]
then we measure out two and a half
quarts of the custard
and then we're gonna take the torch and
torch the surface of the custard to get
rid of any bubbles
the flan has finished cooking it's
cooked for about an hour in there at 250
degrees
the flan is nice and cooled down now
you could not work fast enough and the
entire flan will just like slide off the
tray if you're like too nervous about it
and then we'll just have to make a whole
another flan start from the beginning so
now we're going to go ahead and punch
our flan into
circles
this is actually one of my favorite
projects to do on prep it's just so
satisfying the next step for the
lechoflan donut is to actually punch the
hole in which the flan goes inside
nothing too much to it you kind of feel
it bite back at you you don't want to go
all the way you kind of just want to
fluff it back up and ideally it looks
something like this where there are no
creases on the edges here we have our
flan cream it's basically a byproduct of
the actual flan circles once we punch
the flan circles everything that's left
behind the scraps we blend in a roboku
and it turns into uh this flower cream
[Music]
second to last step here is to actually
add the flan inside
we basically got two desserts here in
one
[Music]
so cora is my grandmother's name her
full name was corazon mendoza the
luchaflan recipe is from my
grandmother's recipe book that i found
after she passed away
last step of the flan here we go the
extra mile and then use the leftover
caramel to brush clean the flan and we
really really just want a nice shiny
perfect circle right in the center
our team is very very small and we've
always been small when we started it was
really just
kevin and i honestly for the first few
months all right team good morning
going over the numbers really quick
we're going to be producing 130 boxes
total all of our current employees are
quite young i think they're all under 23
24 so they're all very early on in their
careers for me that's the most exciting
thing being their current mentor their
current leader i just love to watch them
grow lance
get in here bro
this is lance another one of our cooks
so he's already peeled all of the ube
which and i put it in quotes because
it's actually uh okinawan purple yam we
use this purple yam for the garniture
just because it's like the closest thing
that we can find and it's personally i
think the closest in flavor to like
actual ube so you can't find fresh ube
in america because
ube is an invasive species actually it
doesn't grow anywhere the only way you
can get your hands on authentic ube is
frozen imported from the philippines
this
is a frozen grated ube
we had to have ube on our menu i already
knew this you can't pass that vibrant
purple color
so we are now making the ube pastry
cream in these pots we have milk heating
up with a little bit of ube extract and
she's adding the frozen grated ube to
each of these batches
[Music]
the base of our pastry cream what really
gives it that anxiousness that thickness
and makes it like you know a cream
that's pipeable is starch so here we
have some corn starch and this pastry
cream in particular is quite thick
because of the ube
so as she's stirring i'm going to pour
this in in a thin stream so that we
don't get big clumps of this mixture
cooking in there and you're going to see
how quickly it thickens up because the
milk is already so hot what that's doing
is gelatinizing the starches in this mix
ube in its natural state really does
have like a really deep earthiness to it
because it is it is growing like
underneath the soil
it smells kind of like vanilla a little
bit almost fruity i would say
we've rinsed this about three four five
times as many times as it takes to get
the water pretty much clear that means
that most of the starch has been rinsed
off these are the purple yam chips that
are going to go on top of the ube donut
for garnish
i think a lot of people when they do
make ube desserts
i feel like they don't go hard they
don't take it all the way home with it
every component of our donut has ube
somewhere in it
you know whether it's extract whether
it's the actual grated yam you know it
just gives you that maximum ube punch of
flavor
the busiest part of the day is usually
about two hours out from when we're
ready to start boxing i would say like
about 12 o'clock it really just all
comes down to crunch time and it just
really is a race to the finish line
one o'clock y'all
one o'clock we're running behind we all
got to really pick up the speed all
right
right now i am working on the garniture
for our kamoteku donut our kumoteku
donut is based off of a filipino street
food that essentially is a fried sweet
potato that's caramelized and it's nice
and crispy and then it's sprinkled with
a little bit of toasted sesame we
actually source our sweet potatoes from
a local asian vendor they give us really
huge sweet potatoes so that we can yield
these nice big circles out of them that
kind of crown the donut we need almost
200 pieces for this week
at cora i am very extra when it comes to
my work
i just love having multiple components
in everything i make multiple textures i
love having different mouth feels
different flavors come at you from
different places and every time you take
a bite a mussoline is basically a pastry
cream the base is is the same you know
we've got our starch that thicken up
that milk
sugar of course and eggs but a mussoline
is one is one that's a little bit
fluffier than a standard pastry cream so
this is a toasted sesame paste you can
see how dark it is it's much it's a
little bit darker than peanut butter
this is sort of the mousse part of the
mussoline and basically what we want
is for the butter to look
nice and
white and fluffy before we add that
pastry cream that we made earlier that's
now cooled down
and that is our mussoline i'm just going
to give it a taste i always like to
taste all of our fillings before we put
them in bags because that's the last
time i'll see them
this is my lovely mother uh aka tita
babes
today she's going to be helping shanice
glaze our kamoteku
um you want to say anything for the
camera for the people
oh my god you'd make her cry and then
i'm gonna cry oh my god here comes the
big boss my dad's here too and i had no
idea he was coming so this is my dad he
is uh
i don't know he's just hanging out
having my mom and my aunt on site with
us
it's a lot of fun it's definitely
brought us closer together especially
over the fact that we're bonding over
her mother and my grandmother and how
this business was built on that
right now they're just getting the glaze
to the right temperature and the right
consistency it's essentially our the
same glazed base it's the white
chocolate base for our glaze with some
muscovado sugar added
so our sweet potatoes are done
they've been baking for about 20 minutes
they've got a little syrupy they're
really nice and soft almost like a
custard
when they fry the sweet potato they
actually throw some sugar directly into
the oil
that caramelizes and wraps around the
sweet potatoes and this sort of
emulates that because it gets nice and
crispy
so while i'm torching the sweet potato
shanice is starting to fill the donuts
up so she's going to go in with the
first layer of filling which is our
sweet potato puree that we made from the
scraps the last step of the komoteku
donut is to take our broulaid sweet
potato piece and roll just the edges in
a bit of toasted sesame seeds
it gives it a nice little crunch a
little bit of a nutty flavor that is the
finished komodo cube
we are almost done with production this
is actually the last donut that's
getting assembled before we start our
line to get all of the donuts packaged
in their boxes entwined and then given
to our customers
hey how are you
good good here you go
oh under frida okay i got one in the
beginning i didn't feel burdened to put
filipino culture or food on the map i
think in more recent times i've been
feeling some pressure to create more
don't know if that's necessarily because
of feeling pressured to
be an ambassador for this filipino food
movement i think it's been more pressure
on myself from a personal and
professional standpoint to just be a
better chef because i'm constantly
thinking of new ideas and how i want to
put something new into the world and i
want it to be so unique
cora is the coming together of my entire
life
there is no way
that my grandmother is looking down on
us
and isn't so proud of all the work we've
done honestly it always started with her
and it's going to end with her wherever
cora takes us
behind all of it is my connection with
her and my connection with my heritage
and my connection with my family
so it's the end of the day
we just finished eating family meal and
now we're packing it all up because we
ordered way too much food and
and then what and then we got to do this
all over again next week
[Music]
