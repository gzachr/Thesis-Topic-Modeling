welcome back
Happy Chinese New Year happy Luna New
Year or Chinese New Year
I'm just making sure the siblings are
okay and waiting for people to turn up
so we're just warming up a little bit
what happened
yeah it's weird um
just trying to see what happened because
usually there's a comment section
there's a solid comment section for some
reason it's not
doesn't seem to be active on one that's
weird
hmm
well that kind of defeats the purpose
because we need that section
so people can ask comments
so we'll just say maybe it's a warm-up
thing maybe it's just warming up
just checking the settings guys it seems
to be set up properly
does seem to be set up properly so I
think that might be
I don't know maybe some type of
technical era
my apologies guys if that's a
my apologies if that's a technical error
but uh yeah I obviously set this up a
week ago meaning just to give you guys
plenty of warning
so you could have seen that on the
Facebook page or here
on the YouTube channel
you can check for updates and all that
type of stuff
the heck
what the heck
already and we are
I believe we are live
foreign
technology
yeah Okay good guys what happened was
um I was here early I was here early so
welcome back to be Avengers welcome back
to the channel thank you for joining the
live stream I was here early on time I
had a technical error
that was a technical issue so I was live
broadcasting it just wasn't going
through to YouTube
so for those of you that understand you
need you need two separate things going
on you need to record yourself somehow
and then send that to YouTube now you
can draw through Google hangouts which
is what I'm using
and there's also more third-party
systems so that's what you know some
people have a live full show but yeah
you need all this equipment and all this
special software and stuff so it's not
that bad but one of those things all
right so welcome back guys
welcome back thank you for joining me if
anyone is joining me
[Music]
alrighty
is um
live stream so you can ask questions you
know go ahead please that's all Point
ask questions or if you just wanna
share things
and um
yeah I'll just I'll just share what I
I've been doing I'm a little tired I was
binge watching
uh El Chapo
El Chapo I'll write that down I was
watching the El Chapo series it's about
um
that's in a lower drug cartel in Mexico
that was cool so I already watched the
first season previously and I went wow
I'm a big fan and then I didn't know
there was a second and third season so I
found out and by the way that's life now
we don't go on the TV with the remote
control
you know we go on the internet
you know the internet of things or
whatever so let's entertainment now
entertainment is writing in your hand
it's not bad but a lot of people get
upset and they don't understand what it
is so
anyway yes I was watching El Chapo on
Moon
uh online and that was really cool it's
a really cool series and um
yeah I know it's bad drug cartels but it
actually covers the history it actually
covers a lot of history of Mexico and uh
like the political history and you know
other other issues that were going on so
it's just I think they did such a good
job one it's entertaining it's just you
know TV series or an entertainment
series
but to a Netflix
it's on Netflix excuse me so if you have
Netflix you know go ahead
um it's really weird in Australia we're
still working out the whole pay TV thing
or
online streaming thing we're still
working it out and um anyway hopefully I
can get Netflix at some point but I have
friends who have it and uh yeah they
love it it's fun
coffee
so anyway yeah I'm Soul's watching
season two of El Chapo that was really
good
uh so if you're into you know crime
series or crime drama
that was really cool it also gives you a
bit of just a bit of insight I know it's
just dramaticized as entertainment at
the end of the day we have to remember
that movies you know they're
entertainment
even even a highlight reels you know
you know I was watching some some
highlight reels on Instagram and
Facebook and I was like where are you
that's so cool but it's just
entertainment you know can't take it too
seriously sometimes and um
that's going to be an issue for our
youth you know our youngsters young
people growing up they're going to need
to know how to deal with that uh because
they're going to say things on on social
media and get jealous or upset and
people still do like I'll give you an
example
oh
oh he's my spare rim
just by the way I did a ram upgrade
video go ahead and watch it laptop RAM
upgrade that is a basement I've got 12
gigabytes of RAM 12 gigabytes of RAM
I'm loving it because
the internet uses a lot of ram random
access memory so just like by Nature now
being on the Internet or browsing or
watching videos or going on Facebook
that uses up a lot of ram I've also
known as Amazon and eBay when I'm online
shopping on Amazon and eBay there's a
lot of RAM
what else Google Chrome Google Chrome
the browser that uses up a lot of RAM
and I checked with some techos some tech
experts they said yeah every year Google
Chrome has gotten heavier and heavier
and users are more and more RAM now the
reason why it's more powerful
you know an internet browser now is not
the same as a programmer app now it's
not the same as a program or app 10
years ago so 10 years later you know
you've got to upgrade parts you've got
to upgrade your RAM and your hard drive
but uh anyway
oh
yeah we got an expensive hard drive is a
hard drive high speed hard drive Samsung
850 Pro it's a reverse image on the
camera I know uh that's to do with
photography it's called a mirror a
mirrored camera it does a mirror image
that's how it captures the image anyway
that comes from the old photography days
I've got our 850 as well that's from my
other computer model laptop
and I actually originally tested it with
the 750 I just threw the box here
but uh yeah all good Samsung are the
best man do not buy any other hard
drives they are worth it at least for
now you know it's different time periods
but at least for now they are making the
best in the business they are worth
every cent worth every penny
anyway yeah so go to get my my laptop
upgrade video so the whole point is
there's only so much you can do with a
laptop usually you don't really upgrade
them that was always the traditional
thing
but with uh Windows 7 yes with Windows 7
onwards won the software allowed it to
be more powerful many uh the
architecture 64-bit architecture you can
recognize more parts more RAM blah blah
blah fast forward to Windows 10. very
much so even more so more powerful
Windows 10 can recognize even more
Hardware
uh even more capability even more
powerful so yeah Windows 10 is awesome
um you know you can understand I was
testing on the source testing the parts
testing Windows 10 yeah I'm very happy
with
um for me because I'm a business
consultant there was a lot of problems
because we weren't allowed to use it you
know we had to sort of use what other
partners were using you know just work
purposes office work
and for God's sake you know um some of
them some of the major Partners were
using Windows 8.1 and I said guys we
can't keep using it it's unstable
it's unstable it's crap like we're
getting our work done but it's really
inefficient so finally I complained
enough
and um at all for Solutions like come on
let's just roll over to Windows 10 it
shouldn't be too bad most of our
software and Business Systems should be
compatible and they were and they were
um else to do with our vpns we have to
make sure we had secure connections for
the you know just for working
communication we're doing
and um
yeah it ended up working Windows 10
ended up working like just straight off
the bat it was it was our own we knew it
was our own business software and our
communication software that was the
issue uh you know showed how I outdated
was so anyway
um
yeah that was just my little Mission
with Windows 10 you know worked out well
so
you know I'll write that down
foreign
that down in the comment section so you
guys can see
where is everyone we've got five
watching uh Hey awesome thanks for
joining guys I'm just warming up I'm
just warming up so I know how it is
sometimes uh I don't have a guest today
I thought I'd just do it solo and that
way I could focus on answering your
questions and any queries thank you very
much for joining
then we've got a couple people watching
right now awesome uh leave a comment hey
appreciate it leave a comment just say
hello that's the whole point guys don't
be shy so I'm still warming up yes I was
watching one I was watching El Chapo I
still haven't finished apparently
they're up the third season El Chapo TV
series so
yeah I look forward to catching up on
the third season uh what else yeah 2018
guys very interesting year for me 2018.
it was it was a very much a year of
development
um a lot of reflection in a good way
a lot of self-awareness not
self-conscious self-awareness you know
being self-aware of things that I wanted
to deal with whether it was my health
and fitness uh further like self-study
and education
uh work you know the work or business
goals I might have
you know things like that so I don't
want to get too carried you know people
get um
gosh people get really carried away I
don't know I know like I would like to
make some videos about it so I will at
some point but uh yeah Investments
people get very carried away with
Investments because they they hear that
word that I would and I get all erected
they get a massive Direction and they
get I'm not kidding you know as I get
business clients like banging at my door
and I have to tell them no I have to
sell them that I'm not going to deal
with you if you're going to get all
weird you know but um
yeah I mean putting cash in a savings
account is an investment
a cash savings account a lot of people
don't understand that and what they
don't understand for example right now
um You can find a good interest rate of
say two percent
savings interest two percent savings
interest and this jerk off was talking
to me like they came to me right they
came to me I was going to come
investment in business and finance
advice because of my background
all right so I'm the businessman the
business consultant uh business advisor
right
and uh again I'm probably gonna start
sharing more about that side of my life
so I go to business finance background
and they came to me they jerk off and
they're like oh to be a better business
whatever I said well how much savings do
you have and they they weren't revealing
it to maybe they had something though
that nothing
I said look why don't you get a cash
savings account look around and get a
good one
that you're happy with and save what you
can whatever it is ten dollars a week or
twenty dollars a week yeah that's an
investment you have to start somewhere
right but you have to start with that
and they're like oh well I'm already
doing that and I said okay well soon
we'll keep doing it and see how high you
can go can you save 30 a week or 40 a
week you know whatever they get paid and
I think they're getting paid fortnightly
every two weeks
okay so every payday every two weeks go
ahead and save fifty dollars or whatever
you can and
it's like oh but I need Capital Growth
and I need growth and I need gains and
blah blah blah blah and it's just like
are you kidding me
Google
the power Google what that means
you know I know I'm getting a bit pet
peeve now but I was like Google what
that means because you don't even
understand what risk is
risk is not when you don't understand
something just spell it out
risk is when you don't understand
something that's when you're in risk of
something right that's the definition of
reason
foreign
by the way guys I do this just for notes
as well just for documentation uh and
notes for myself and for the viewers too
so I can always look back and then check
what the hell we're talking about and
look at the notes you guys can too
especially if um my accent is a bit
heavy sometimes I have to modifying my
accent speak like an [ __ ]
but anyway so this particular person
I was like if you make two percent from
a savings account
at least you make two percent it's
better than losing it all
and if you say the r word recession the
r word which we're heading for recession
means like crash like economic crash
economic downturn
well then you lose everything right so
it's like you want you you know you're
being so you're trying to be so cool and
Savvy and greedy well you're just gonna
lose everything right two percent's
better than losing it all
that's what a lot of the greedy idiots
don't understand they want games games
they don't understand the risk and
what's the risk the risk is not
understanding what the hell the subject
matter you know
it doesn't matter if it's toxic waste
property whatever you've got to
understand what the risk is and a lot of
people just don't want to accept that
so I learned that from um a professional
a professional friend of meaning he's
he's not a property investor like he
knows his stuff he works at his
properties himself he lives in that area
he works on the properties he patrols
the neighborhoods he knows what the
neighborhoods are like is it loud is it
high crime or not obviously he goes for
good neighborhoods he makes sure the
Lawns are kept outside as if you see
that place it looks cool whether it's an
apartment or a townhouse or whatever
right
see that this is what I mean it's a
full-time job you don't just buy a
property and become rich you've got to
work on it every week every day you know
you've got to keep working on
uh what else you've got to understand
the rental rates you've got to
understand the interest rates if you
borrowed money which most people do
you see I'm getting carried away now
because this is actually a big part of
my life but um
you know you guys get to see me
traveling around and doing other stuff
hey John John what's up what's up John
you've only got playing John John with
the green icon thanks hey thanks for
joining us bro thanks for commenting
that's the whole point ask questions
on this I'm just showing the fat I'm
just uh killing time while
we're waiting for more people to rock up
we've got about four people watching now
thank you
awesome come on guys share it share it
get some other people on you
there's two on the fat I'm purposely
doing this solo so I can focus on
answering your questions and focus on
you guys and also just show a bit of an
update so um
yeah just to finish up on what I was
talking about before property yeah I
mean it's not simple
you know you know make sure the carpet
is maintained put in new carpet or put
in new floorboards make sure there's new
coats of paint make sure things aren't
falling apart and whatever you know
you've got to do things like you've got
to make sure all the Taps have new
washers have they been seated have they
been polished properly otherwise you get
corrosion
you know how's the plumbing you know
how's the electrics again make get a fix
it's a pet peeve
um they're not supposed to do it but
they do it
but just to give you an idea in
Australia all new homes are supposed to
be insulated you don't have fiberglass
insulation in the walls
and I was talking to some Builders they
still then do it that is do it to cut
corners they're supposed to put
fiberglass insulation to make sure it's
all energy efficient uh warmer or cooler
you know for the different weather
conditions
they're Slack
you know really really silly okay yeah
um jono so John thank you for joining
and coming do you do you think you can
retire in Philippines in the future
maybe
um that's where all the series came from
Brother
so John that's where the series came
from uh season four
I've been I've been exploring I've been
investigating that option yeah and uh
right now no
right now just because of my own
personal circumstances and um
well actually that's not true I could I
could go over there right now quick just
because I've done I've done well I've
made a lot of good decisions Young
and it's it's definitely what I was just
saying earlier
that hey I saved when I had good work
there were times when I'll be honest at
other times I had a crappy part-time
jobs as a student earning 10 grand a
year 15 grand a year I'm being honest
and obviously I graduated as a student
that are working full-time man some
employers really took advantage even in
an office job they know you want to
start your office career your business
career your Finance career you know like
that so I'll just say that my finance
career
and they're taking advantage and they're
only paying 30 000 salary no bonuses
nothing then
you're like this is crap and they know
because you just want to build up work
experience right
and then anyway so you know fast forward
you slowly earn 35 and then 40 and 45.50
so I've made a lot of smart decisions
from Young uh you know from my early 20s
uh I was making a lot of smart decisions
I knew to play the long game you know
it's like it was drilled into me just
from my community and and my own my own
uh you know like colleagues and peers
play the long game do the right thing
play the long game I know it sounds very
cliche I should have talked about it
earlier but that's what I did and it
worked out so now in my 30s I have that
ability to to do what I like because I'm
I made a lot of good decisions early so
to give you an example when I whenever I
earned good money you know Contracting
whatever you know it's not forever it's
for three months six months I use that
money to pay off my student debt
so my student was about forty thousand
dollars and I paid it all off as soon as
I could in my 20s as soon as I could so
whenever that extra bit of money I
wasn't buying fancy watches all the time
and driving fancy cars I was using all
that extra money even this like two
grand three grand to pay off my student
debt so uh yeah I remember it's about
forty thousand dollars but I just you
know slowly slowly kept paying it off
um says John to answer your question
um considering the cost of living yeah
you're going to spend about twelve
hundred dollars U.S a month in
Philippines 1200 us a month and if you
look in my videos I cover that so if you
look at season three especially
but I covered through all my videos so
yeah look at Philippine season three
um now
in regards the cost of living you can
double cover everything that will cover
your basic cost of living 1200 us a
month
what do you need to understand is if you
start partying
you start partying really hard you know
you're gonna run out of money real quick
there's other factors too you can get
robbed you can get scammed it's not
about being negative I'm giving you a
reality check
so you really also need startup capital
I mean you need to know like hey maybe
you have five grand for a motorbike 10
grand for a motorbike or car
you're going to need to get set up
you're going to need a basic vehicle
even a scooter yeah just start off with
something simple
um what else you got any furniture and
finishings you know you might need a
microwave
you know what I'm saying a cooktop a
little electric stove you're going to
need things uh Cutlery
blankets you know so you're definitely
going to need some uh some startup cash
so
yeah just so I hope I answered your
question John uh please keep asking if
you wish when are you coming back yeah
look Jose Jose G he's asking when I'm
coming back Jose um I was going to go in
February February this year but I
decided like now oh geez well the time
flies I'll look at the calendar
yeah no it's a for me I'd rather focus
on um my personal life and business and
um there's some things I've got to deal
with life right I got to deal with life
so unlike all the other bull crappers
acting like oh wow big show off look at
me you know be
vlogger or whatever it's like you know
there's a reality check you know I gotta
gotta work a job and pay the bills
um
these are the goals I hope to reveal
that later on this channel but other
goals I'm working on and you know if I
take care of that Foundation just like a
reinforced concrete foundation
it takes the longest time
the longest time to build that
Foundation but once it's dry once it's
set it reinforced concrete man you can
build anything
so that's the whole idea yeah that I'm
building on my life and uh if things go
well I can travel whenever I like
crazy
uh what season of Philippines did you
earn the most money from videos okay 621
Norby that's a good question
the most money from your videos so I
would say uh Philippine season four and
we're not allowed to talk about it Norby
I'm being serious we all have a basic
contract with uh Google YouTube and
their contract stipulates you cannot
talk about the money
to give you an idea
um
what I earn a month
from YouTube might might buy an external
hard drive
to
you know you better be smart enough to
work out what that means so what I earn
a month might buy me a memory card
and a hard drive I'm just trying to
point a hard drive to show you you know
like like you know one of those these
cheap
external hard drives
yeah so Norby you know one of these hard
drives you put in the computer and I
backup all my photos and videos on a
hard drive
just to give you an idea right
so these aren't very expensive so
you know the big YouTubers guys you
gotta understand a lot of people have
this misconception and you really got to
get a three thick heads you lose money
by making videos
it's so expensive to make videos it's so
time consuming you lose money
right so a lot of people do it as a
passion they do it as a just a hobby in
their passion and of course Casey
neistat he's a big logo I love Casey man
he breaks a DSLR every month
yeah a thousand dollar DSLR he breaks
one every month
just to give you an idea he's breaking a
camera plus the lens the lens cost
couple of green as well the different
lenses he uses
he's breaking a camera every month then
so that's a full-time job it doesn't
matter what you guys think of it he does
it full time 60 to 70 gigabytes of
filming every day
every time he makes a video 60 to 70
gigabytes that means he has to buy a
hard drive a memory card a new camera a
new lens because he keeps breaking them
yeah so yeah you don't make [ __ ] so look
I'm just going to tell you straight
Norby the average YouTuber makes 30 a
month
they make about 30 a month you know most
most will make around that I'm being
serious and like I said unless you're
big Casey knows that like you really
know your staff you're breaking a camera
every month like a three thousand
dollars worth of equipment he breaks
everything that guy but you understand
that's his job
you know that's he's he's burning all
his money to make those videos right
uh so I'm happy that he's successful and
it took him years I think it took him
eight years
took him a long time he talks about it
he talks about his own videos but anyway
are you dating YG 360 are you dating uh
not at the moment I was I was I was
trying to and um that's part of me I'm
working on that I'm not kidding I'm
working on that in the best way possible
like
um you know working on myself you know
it's it's a thing like if there's better
ways interpersonal skills or
communication skills
it's a difference between cats and dogs
but it's actually a thing so
yeah you know the dining game
what else we got
another year I was I wasn't curious
about the amount but what season was the
most profitable oh brother yeah okay
season four
but it doesn't even cover like the the
combination the flights I pay for that
all myself guys I'm not sponsored I have
to sponsor myself you know maybe one day
right and that's the whole idea I just
thought for you guys to share with all
of you and uh maybe that gets more
reconditioned later
you know I've been interviewed on SBS
Radio which is a TV and radio Media
company here in Australia SBS media yeah
they interviewed me on SBS Filipino
radio and that was cool but that's all
you know just because you get one one or
two interviews don't make you at
somebody
but um yeah that's all I do normally
that you build it up I want to keep
building it up and um
yeah it doesn't what I make from
advertising Revenue I'm being honest
doesn't even cover the cost of my videos
you know it costs so much to make them
uh yeah it's money to share with you
guys sharing all that valuable
information sharing that value
and uh helping other people out because
that was the whole idea I was like
why does the song make videos to help
another person out there and that's
that's why I started making and I
actually I was actually making them from
my friends so
uh when I saw into the camera I was
pretending I was talking to my friends
in Australia like hey guys this is
what's Happening Here
but uh so that's how the whole vlogging
thing started
and uh I didn't even know about Casey
neistat either I didn't know like I'd
seen his iPod video many years ago he
made a video where he was talking about
the iPod and how it it's designed to
break every 12 months
um you know I kind of I kind of knew of
him but I didn't follow him and then um
it was actually you guys my subscribers
told me to get on watch Casey neistat
and I went all right
so I didn't I was just figuring out I
was just literally
making trouble videos you know for
myself
and uh yeah they worked out and still
made from yeah and now and you know I'm
just making videos in general for fun

yeah but John I like I like where you
were going about cost of living so
yeah so for me you still got to
understand it's a developing country and
it sounds obvious but it's not so you
know like the crime rate is different
different medical standard uh so to live
well I know people that have done it who
live well you're probably going to need
2 000 a month and the way they did it
they were already using some sort of
pension system meaning they're old
they'll retired so they already had some
sort of pension income coming in or a
military pension
um you know all that type of stuff you
know you see all these bull crap
entrepreneurs you know it's the new word
entrepreneur so all these all I'm an
online entrepreneur and you understand
all these advertisements I it I hate it
you see these advertisements on YouTube
and Facebook they're bullcrappers right
they're bullshitters
and you know pay me a couple of grand
I'll make you an online entrepreneur was
[ __ ] and a couple of guys approached
me actually
uh you know a private message they
approached me around about this stuff
and I knew straight away they were
bullcrappers
and I asked them like what do you guys
really want they go I want to sit back
on an island making money for nothing
I was like
yeah but what what do you actually offer
what what value do you offer go like
this nothing they just want to make a
bull crap they actually contacted me
about it they wanted to make a bull crap
you know Channel or you know social
media
uh to discharge people money for their
bull crap and I was like no I'm not
interested jerk off you know what I mean
their whole objective is to cheating
another person it's stupid all it takes
is a heartbeat on the internet
as soon as people figure out their their
Bull crappers and scammers man they're
down the tube everyone's gonna know the
whole internet's gonna know it's stupid
absolutely stupid it's uh yeah if you if
you're the whole Faker till you make it

and uh you know that's something I'm
interested in I know I know it may sound
funny especially if you're an American
man appreciate your freedoms we've got
to pay a thousand dollars in
registration fees on average just just
for like a bolt action single shot rifle
like a 22. you know you get your little
peashooter you put the little 22 pop
open the bulb
a thousand dollars in fees and
registration or licensing stupid that's
just all the registration and uh upkeep
so if you don't have to do that anyways
man get yourself a goddamn double barrel
or pump action or something get yourself
something you know get yourself with 22
at least get some get an AR-15 of course

yeah I know it's not your real name
baggy mag I know it's your it's your
avatar it's just your screen name I know
the adventures right that's not my real
name
I'm Brandon Brendan
so Brendan's Adventures that's where the
name came from it was actually I'm an ex
an ex uh encouraged me you know to make
a YouTube channel so she already had a
YouTube channel she had like 30
subscribers 30 or 50.
and then she was like yeah set it up
it's not hard and you know just give it
a go and just
put a name
and I was like what do I want to do with
this Channel and I thought I was
literally had a point where I was like I
want to have more Adventures because I
do a lot of office work so stuck in the
offers the office job
you know and I wasn't happy you know I
was making good money I'm very grateful
for that and I was working with some
awesome people but I wasn't happy so I
thought what do I want to do this
channel well I want to have Adventures
so that's like the adventures that's
where you came from
and um
and that girl wasn't a very nice girl
anyway it didn't work out but I know she
was okay if she you know just didn't
work out you know what dating but uh it
was funny so I was like oh wow she's got
50 subscribers and then you know I built
up my channel and you know wow look at
me now sort of thing I'm going on 20 000
subscribers and uh guys yeah sure please
share the Channel with other people help
me get up up to the 20K you know that
would be really like a good milestone
for me uh so I know that one you guys
are interested and I'll keep making
videos and series
um oh you remember me Life in the
Philippines as I said I remember you and
said star from a while back yeah
so yeah says it's gone but now it says
style is gone for now that's um his own
choice he made his videos private or
took them down
and um guys I don't know why people are
getting all weird about it he was okay
I'll explain it I don't want to keep
talking about him to be honest
um
because I know him in real life as well
right so I'm not going to razz I'm not
gonna rise and decent on the person
disrespecting another person especially
when they're not here but he he
announced on his channel that he had
broken up with his wife Lynn and he
wanted to keep partying
right so you make it that what you will
but he made his own decision he's a
grown ass man he wants to keep biting
then he's that's his own choice I mean
breaking up with your wife is a big deal
right it's a serious decision so
best wishes all right well if they offer
you guys
so that's it you know and then he took
down his videos you know so
a bit crazy a bit crazy
I'm being polite and just hang around
some dodgy people it does a lot of
accusations he'd been doing dodgy things
or hang around other people um dodgy
people so again accusations
that's that's on him and the community
to work out yeah I'm not interested in
gossiping easy
hmm
in my coffee all right
yep he's in this other guy saying he's
in Philippines now since November 2017.
yeah
um I checked out your channel man yeah
I'll do a quick look I was just um
taking a look yeah cool
Johnson yeah John said uh I said
Somebody's a fan of females yeah
ladyboys yeah no I I get Razz anymore I
kept when we're friends and we're
traveling together I kept resonating
Manny he was cool about it like he could
take a joke but um it's a thing they
would go I've told me in real life they
would go they would chase him
that would go crazy over him yeah man I
mean you know they see a younger Western
you know younger American guy
that means money let's get straight
let's get that straight it means money
they try some money and you gotta
understand if they're ladyboys
it's actually men so that they could
physically overpower him they could beat
him up and grab him
and it's that's a risk Anyway by the way
Thailand especially it's it's an issue
we get rocked by ladyboys in Thailand
it's a thing I know it sounds funny but
it's it's something you just have to be
careful
uh Norby 621 Norby some really messed up
rumors going around about
hey man like I think his Facebook is
still active uh you know he messaged you
that's what I'm telling people message
him directly uh you know go straight to
the source and you know that's that but
it's also up to him as in he could
easily
put videos up again or release them or
or speak to his own defense that's it's
for him so let's let's move on and and
guys come on wake up
Philippines yeah boom boom boom
all right there's a lot of action going
on you know whether it's drugs partying
this and you know there's a lot of
things going on
so um
that's that's for one to decide and you
can have an early grave there man it's
sad you see guys in bars at 10 A.M like
that's why I did this video early just
so it's a bit more convenient for the
different time zones sometimes it's a
bit harder in other time zones
um usually I do them a bit later
but yeah I mean this like right now it's
it's 11 30 uh a.m in Australia and
there's people in the bars in
Philippines getting drunk on red horse
and cheap rum it's crazy
and then you'll hit an early grave
that's what they're looking for
the problem is they don't the problem is
they don't die they just keep drinking
slendy and slowly fading away and
getting more and more miserable
uh Ken Kenji Kenji hitmaker
hi Brandon when's your next trip to Asia
um yeah I'm not sure Kenji I was just
saying that at the start I'm working on
myself and my own personal life I've got
other things to worry about I'm being
very serious you know like work and
other things
and if I could get that squared away
then I won't have to worry I can do
whatever I like and um trouble trouble
whenever I like and wherever I like but
yeah I was actually going to do it now
February but I decided against it um
there's too much going on in the
business world
and you know I'm a businessman
there's too much going on in the
business world right now
and
because people get upset when I talk
about the economy so I
I've studied economics and I still
follow economics I mean people get upset
but I could talk about it I'm not sure
how interested the audience is but yeah
there's some there's a lot of economic
things happening
uh yeah so you might want to Google the
economy wherever you are I follow
I try to follow as many as possible
because they're data points you get more
data by studying more things but I
follow typically the US economy and
Australia I follow it because we we
we're actually linked together you know
we're like we're allies and partners
and what happens in the US also impacts
Australia
uh yeah so dance to your question Kenji
I'm not sure I was going to trouble now
but
um I'll probably push you out maybe to
later in the year because later in the
year things go well hey I deserve a
vacation but we'll see if business goes
well yeah otherwise um
oh by the way there's a better I better
post it this is really serious there's a
measles outbreak guys
it's a measles earthquake
uh in Philippines so get your shots
yeah
um I'm glad I remember that
I'd get you shots before you go even if
you're if you're Pinoy if you're
Filipino you can get a measles uh what
do you call it a vaccination uh
injection for free all right so if
you're Filipino you can get it for free
uh foreigners won't have to pay if
you're in Philippines I think they're
offering it for free too because they
don't want more people to uh get
uh the measles right it's highly
contagious it's spreading right is that
outbreak
so guys yeah serious night there's a
measles outbreak in Philippines tell
your friends and family get your shots
get your injections whether whether
you're in the country or going to visit
all right it's serious
uh yeah so that's a serious thing you
know Public Service warning yeah there's
also a lot of terrorist activity you got
uh Abu sayaf and you've got Isis Isis is
the Islamic State of uh Iraq and Syria
that's why it's got that weird acronym
and uh you've got abusive group now the
problem is Isis are recruiting they're
absorbing a lot of these terrors so
whether they call themselves local name
abasaya for Isis they're terrorists and
they're they're doing like bombing
campaigns kidnappings murders
so that's happening in the south in the
very far south in like Jolo Island so
there's a big there's a military
campaign going on there right now
and for the for the soft idiots who
don't understand
um they did a peace deal the government
offered a peace deal they chose peace
you know you get these uppity it's
really sad I you know I shouldn't I
shouldn't sound so critical
it's really sad because people don't
understand it's happening
you know they've got hard terrorists man
they'll kidnap you and cut off your head
and put it on the internet
they'll be they'll be hedge you it's
serious you know and
the government the government offered a
peace deal they said put down the gun
you know we'll draw a piece still
they're still active the Rebels the
rebels and terrorists so people get all
up with you they don't understand it's
not the same as Australia or America
you kind of say oh let's choose peace
they chose piece and the rebels kept
attacking
and they've kidnapped a couple of um the
last two uh I heard about were some
Canadians there was also some Malaysians
and Indonesians and I got kidnapped but
these two Canadian guys got they had it
to Young Canadian guys kidnapped and
then they took them South and cut off
their heads you know it's not funny you
know so it's not as simple as choosing
peace they chose peace
the government offered a peace deal on
Victory space they broke the peace deal
they used the peace deal to rearm to
regroup and re-arm and then once they
re-arm they kept attacking something
so you know it was a strategic move they
just used the peace deal to regroup and
re-arm
uh and Isis uh have moved in
you know
uh I've liked the videos of uh Kenji
I've liked your videos over the past
years thanks for keeping it real great
job
had to see many more preacher hey thanks
Kenji hitmaker yeah I appreciate it man
yeah yeah so we're still going guys
we're still going as in
uh I'm just I'm sharing what I like you
know so if I like cooking I like to
share that anymore if I like uh you know
a hobby do it yourself Hobbies
you know like that's why I did all these
computer videos you know to share with
you guys one don't be scared work on
your computer upgrade the RAM upgrade
the hard drive you know don't be scared
just to encourage you guys to share that
bit of Education
and also show you that that's what I'm
interested in you know I mean it's
technology I had to I had to learn for
work and also I have to like in these
videos you know I had to make sure my
Hardware was up to date
yeah it's dangerous in Mindanao yep so
guys I'm not hating I mean that I like I
like Mindanao because I've been down
there
uh Davao City and um
Zamboanga Del Norte you know so the top
across from dumagiri City basically
uh what was the tapatan and dipolog I
liked it I had a great time you know I
went with some Filipino friends I liked
it it was great
but obviously vacation we're traveling
around on vacation having a great time
and then going back to a safer region so
of course it's not recommended I mean
some people are very irresponsible
showing off oh look at me I'm in mind
okay yeah we get it you're there and
what they're not telling you is they're
usually with Filipino friends
they're not just running around Crazy by
themselves they're with a wife or a
girlfriend you know someone close to
them or extended family and you know
extended friends
um you know we've got to be responsible
you can't just go running around a war
zone or a very dangerous area you're
going to get kidnapped and beheaded you
know you've got to be I think we're just
going to be a little bit more
responsible so I know it's different if
you've got a wife
or a girlfriend or family down there but
yeah
yeah don't get into Mindanao try not to
uh or Davao City go to the specific
well-guarded cities so devout city is
the safest city of Philippines yeah
that's awesome I've been there you know
I enjoyed it it was nice I should go
back
bring of mine uh Norby you're saying
friend of mine in ilagan said the
Muslims came and said if you don't vote
for Muslim they will have War
I'm sure it was a scare tactic and hope
nothing comes of it yeah me too yeah
absolutely
and you don't understand guys it's not
just the Muslim terrorists there's also
this Rebel groups they're just Rebels
you got NPA in your People's Army uh
they're like communist rebels uh they
call them mountain police because
in the mountains there's nothing there's
no hospital no schools so they're
they're literally the local security
so some NPA are just like uh Mac and I
said
well that's what they call a mountain
police sometimes it is like mountain
ranges you know like
local police you know local militia so
sometimes it's got nothing to do with
ideology or religion nothing good you
know like sometimes they're just locals
guarding their area
that's how bad it is sometimes too A lot
of people don't understand you've got
drug cartels crime syndicates again I'm
not Rising guys I'm not saying there's
like to send or bad it's just a reality
check because
so many people get fresh off the plane
and they grew and googly eyes I've been
that person going oh well oh man they
get robbed you get robbed
you know you get scammed you get robbed
you know because you're looking around
thinking why isn't everything more like
organized and like uh America or
Australia because it's different it's
totally different and that's why I like
it it's a great adventure you go on this
amazing adventure but it is hectic it is
hectic
my American friends are like what does
that mean oh my why does he say hectic
then we'll look up the meaning of hectic
Google it it is hectic but you it's
quite amazing I mean you know
the shooting range videos alone people
wouldn't believe it girls some girls who
were Rising me some Australian girls
though razzing the [ __ ] out of me you
know I knew them why are you gonna feel
the things you know they'll like being
really weird I'll go watch my videos
I'll go to the shooting range you go to
the islands island hopping beaches
drinking fresh coconuts eating Seafood
they're really upset and jealous and I
was like um it's documented
it's there
ATVs quad bikes you know all that cool
stuff yeah uh on this chewing of fat
Andy King says it's all CIA mercenaries
uh I can't rule that out we've got to be
careful
be careful Andy King we've got to be
careful because um they there's a
there's a lot of controversy that either
CIA
um either Google YouTube are working
with the CIA or they're paying they're
paying for the intelligence which would
make sense spending on all these
platforms Facebook Instagram
uh Twitter Youtube Google they gather
your information the Gathering data
right and why would they go through all
the data well it boils down the business
they want money so they sell it to who
pays enough money for it that's reality
check it doesn't mean you need to get
all paranoid but you certainly do need
to be careful like uh two-stage
authentication things like that just
upping your security strong passwords it
does matter because
uh you know there's all these hacking
scandals with Facebook that's real I
have to change my passwords on Facebook
you see what I mean two-stage
authentication means if someone logs
into my if I if I log into my email or
Facebook or YouTube
I get another request on my phone like
this and I have to
say yes that was me on my phone so that
way if I get hacked they know whether
it's me or not because I have to verify
on the computer and on my phone
so just for the people don't understand
what it means everyone should be doing
that by the way I know it's annoying but
you kind of have to like I got hacked by
these jerks in the UK I got a warning
warning your account is being accessed
by uh someone in UK in London or
whatever well that's not me I'm in
Australia so straight away I just
clicked it says is this you or not yes
or no I said no they said yep we thank
you for verifying we just block them
so you see what I mean
that was just on my email my Facebook
right but immediately they knew I use
Microsoft Outlook Outlook news straight
away this is not Brendan because
Brennan's in Australia well
intermittedly us is this you or not and
Facebook new as well same thing Facebook
new hey Brennan's in Australia why is
this person hacking in from UK you know
like or why is this why is it trying to
be accessed
and of course it may be you maybe you're
traveling so you can also verify yes
that's me I'm traveling
uh Andy King
Muslims have become the world scapegoat
unfortunately yeah well look they need a
they need a
book for what it's worth my opinion you
know my just two cents they need to
speak up more I mean if I I have friends
who are good Muslims and they need to
speak up and we need to hear we need to
hear from them
because they're very quiet you know
they're very very reserved and quiet
but the bad ones are very local very
loud and terrorists and killing people
so you seeing
if if there are good ones out there we
need to hear from you you need to speak
up and you need to set a better example
to those bad ones
and um to give you guys an example um
the word Jihad has several meanings and
that's the problem and it was actually a
western analyst to explain this to me an
Australian
so you know an educated first person
Jihad means holy Warrior that's the
rough translation but it could also mean
spiritual Warrior like a monk
like a monk you know a spiritual Warrior
so it means someone who is spiritual who
prays who is spiritual
it does not mean uh killing people in
the name of God I don't want to get I
don't want to get too carried away guys
I could tell this this is going to get
messy but that's what just a simple
thing like that
teaching people Jihad means spiritual
Warrior it means the Battle of Silph you
know battling against drugs and alcohol
or gambling badly battling against uh
lying and cheating
the spiritual
and spiritual pullings so that's what it
means to be a spiritual Warrior so
unfortunately what they do is they
target drug addicts people who are low
income low education they brainwash them
and radicalize them
uh and say hey you're going through a
tough time we'll help you so they do
they help them they get them off drugs
or they feed them they clothe them and
saying Hey brother now that we've helped
you
you know and they say hey we're going to
teach you about Jihad you know and and
it's corrupt you know they're teaching
them hey kill people in the name of God
no
that's not in the name of God that's in
the name of murderers
you know you're just being a straight
murderer a killer at that point like hey
if I smoke someone in the car park well
I'm a straight murderer that's but I
unless I own it
I'm just joking but um it happens hey it
happens you know so sometimes it's
haters I'm like sometimes I'm gonna be
crazy I'm like yeah well meet me in
Philippines we'll finish it
this guy was hating on me I'm just
obviously I'm getting loosed in this guy
was hating on me I was like bro I'm like
have you met in real life and um this

[Music]
um
yeah can you imagine me like
doing crazy things well you probably
can't I do crazy things in Philippines
so yeah good look good questions guys
keep in common
keep them going
um and I guess maybe some of you are
probably interested uh each trip I've
been investigating moving there
each trip each season I'm going around
investigating
uh whether I can move it so that's the
whole point uh I have not found I have
not yet found a place for me I'm not
saying it's bad for everyone I'm just
saying for me
you know could I can I live here or
maybe I could stay here longer or you
know and each place has been for the
most part uh you know great experience
Great Adventure but not not quite a
place I'd like to live yet
not quite uh but maybe again maybe I
just need to explore more
and also different places in life too
from places in life like I was saying at
the start of the video you know I'm
working on my my work my business my
career
uh you know I'm I'm focused on building
up other things
and a very important foundation once I
have that Foundation I can build
anything I want you know as in like a
it's a metaphor or a philosophy
and I really mean that guys you know pay
attention to it that you've got to build
foundations in life because life is a
long game
if you don't have that Foundation you'll
crash and then whatever you build will
crash and Full House of Cards so Life's
a long game you know it's a long game
uh
did you see uh Andy said did you see
Elaine Robert if I'm the GT Tower no I
did not what's up with that
I'm gonna google it
okay I guess that was a thing guys I'm
I'm so like I don't even watch TV I'm
being honest I don't watch TV in
Australia I watch TV when I'm traveling
or just on occasion
French Spider-Man arrested oh I see
french Spiderman yeah I heard about him

McCarthy building geez
okay
uh yeah thanks for telling me Andy you
see I'm a bit out of the loop so that's
also cool too when we when we do these
things
uh and also comment sections I get to
learn from you guys no ropes even yeah
I'm looking at a picture I'm just
Googling it yeah he's crazy man
that's so dangerous
yeah that's so dangerous man
so guys yeah keep the comments coming
keep the questions coming
all right so I'll look at that later I
might yeah I might post that article
saying I'll look into it later but um
yeah cool
cool
yeah so
uh oh by the way there was a huge like
clean up Manila Bay campaign this year
2019 and they they did it like that in
January January Feb
uh John thank you for bringing it up
Erica yeah we'll talk about it next but
I'll just finish up
hello bay was disgusting disgusting many
many
um people have put videos on YouTube
like individual videos or even big
vloggers big YouTuber names
and guys just respect it's just full of
trash like it's just disgusting so all
it took was one one month
one month January of volunteers my big
respect big respect to the volunteers
and they all went down there with trash
bags and they got like
45 garbage trucks they fill up like 45
trucks they said 45 tons but it's not
really accurate because I was filling up
each truck right
so all the volunteers went down there
with gloves and then picked up all the
trash and driftwood
night and day difference so I posted
that article on
my Facebook check out my Facebook page
guys the adventures on Facebook
and uh you know most you probably know
about it that's why you're here
but uh yeah it was just amazing one
month
so good on good on them good on the
Pinoy good on manila I really mean it to
all the volunteers respect huh big
respect it shows you when you work
together you could they got it done like
on a weekend
you know like they all help each other
they go to dinner on the weekend it
looks just clean now at least they said
the water is still toxic
but it's a good start it's a good start
this is how you improve the quality of
the water you got to pull the trash out
stop dumping trash they're also finding
the businesses the businesses that have
been dumping trash and the squatters
there's a people squatting around there
they have to clean them up and then they
also have to find them
you know but that's the whole point
right people would drink a coffee and
throw it in the sea they would eat a
food and throw the wrapper in the city
it's like no no you gotta collect the
trash you can't keep destroying your own
country you know I mean that's why I
never went back to Boracay I didn't like
Morocco when I went in 2013. I had about
like just it was it was nice it was nice
enough but I wouldn't want to go back
again it was because it's very expensive
and heavily polluted you know those
Suraj sewage you know
you could smell the pawn way in the
water I'm not kidding and that was in
2013. so finally
finally they cleaned it up good on you
know did you throw it there president
duterte they said hey no more would be
good to clean this up so good on them so
yeah they need to do a lot more but I
just
you know well done well done to all
those people involved like cleaning up
whether it's cleaning up Morocco or
cleaning up Manila keep doing it it's
worth it otherwise people will think
your sister is disgusting destroyed uh
island country it's meant to be a
beautiful
it's meant to be a beautiful orange
country that's what it's supposed to be
and it still can be
right so keep it up uh yeah Erica so I
met Erica at Apollonia Hotel uh I I
realized yeah I keep making these
references maybe it's a bit hard for you
guys to find let me just Google it
but I met her when I first went to
Apollonia Hotel
and um that's it I wish
I wish there was more but now we became
friends and
you know very respectful
we became friends and we kept in touch
and
I mean that sincerely because obviously
I'm here in Australia
hold on let me just write some links uh
I was talking about this at the start
guys I'd like to do this for
documentation for myself
and also any other the viewers who come
in late
I just posted the link that's the
Apollonia hotel and the laundry day
and um say if you want to see her and
yeah she was a nice Scott now because of
contractualization most people lose
their contracts after six months the
reason why the employees don't want to
pay extra benefits you know like medical
and insurance so all they do is they
hire people every six months and then
fire them even if they're good
and uh of course the smart employer
would keep them because you keep the
experience in the training and a good
stuff now
so yeah so Eric I have to keep moving
around working in different hotels she
now works like in uh like office job
tech industry and like tech support you
know call center and whatever
uh yeah we kept in touch she's a good
goal he kept in touch and uh and we
built a good friendship and I'm being
sincere because there's no way I could
touch her if you know what I mean
there's no funny business going on
and she just told me look she's just she
was straight she just told me she's
interested in friendship
and uh she didn't she didn't ask for
money
you know she didn't answer money or
anything like that she just said uh she
liked Kim touch and keep our friendship
and also um
you know it's sincere you know she went
through some hard times I was there for
her I went through some hard times and
she was at least nice to me you know
like that's what life's about
and uh yeah but yeah and she's obviously
going through a gym Journey so she was
cool so because we built this trust and
friendship you know sincere
she'll show me your June videos
and I was like look we don't have to I
got her permission I said uh why don't I
because there's a show me short clips of
uh Jim a Jim Journey for herself
I said why don't I make a video just for
fun just for us you know I put music and
I'll edit it you know it's like you know
she's just doing these amateur videos
with her phone
and she's like yeah okay just just uh
you know let's take a look so I made the
video I showed her first I didn't I
didn't post it and she said yeah that's
really cute okay you know she could see
what I was doing she goes yeah okay um
go ahead go ahead and post it
uh uh she said I could post it on
YouTube but she didn't want me to post
it on Facebook so because you know she's
maybe she doesn't want people uh
stalking her or swarming around on
Facebook because I said I'll do it for
you many emails from my channel I'll
just I'll just make the video just for
you you know for your own
personal thing and she said no no no you
go ahead you go and she she liked it you
know it's fun you know why not
uh we wanted to keep making more so
we'll see you know if you guys like it
we'll keep making more uh just for fun
but it was it was really for her as a
gift to her as a friend like I wanted to
encourage you keep going
you know she went through a lot of
personal problems you know I don't want
to talk too much about that that's a
private life but she had a lot of
personal problems and relationship
problems so she dealt with it by going
to the gym to to get fit but to get over
the stress and and perhaps it and I know
a lot of people that have done that I
know guys too guys who have to get over
stress and upset they went to the gym
and ended up getting really buff
you know I want to I want to step off
and up to it uh or at least Fitness just
for my fitness
anyway so yeah that's the story with
Erica and she is a nice girl I mean
we've had chats uh I even asked her like
what are you after as relax what are you
after and she is like well how about a
meal like like when you're in town let's
have a meal let's have a dinner date you
know like that's it like she's like I'm
gonna have to
not after money or whatever you know it
actually works she's got a she's got a
full-time uh office job
I mean it's hard it's not guys they
don't own much it's hard but
you know at least she's doing it honest
so
yeah you know the temptation to get
involved in more illicit things is
always there
but um anyway so I hope that that was
enough for you John
or call bro yeah yeah keep asking
questions guys so who else we got we got
John we got Andy
um
Kenji
blowing machine
YG 360 YJ 360.
um yeah you know what let's go back to
that question YJ yeah so I was I have
been dating just on and off just
slowly like I'm not in a rush and I'm
being absolutely serious I've just
you know when you get over it you know
like sometimes when you get a bit over
it you're like oh I've spent
so much time and effort on this and
maybe I just need to work in myself more
or focus on work or focus on business
focuses on other things
and um
you know just I'm just saying my
experience has been very different that
you know we all got to grow up it
doesn't matter how young or old we all
have to grow and mature and as many
types of maturity be it Financial
maturity or spiritual maturity or
intellectual maturity you know there's
many ways to mature
and um
for me I guess whatever while I'm
working on all of those things but two
I don't need the drama
I don't need the drama brother sometimes
it's just like I just need to focus on
myself in a good way
you know so getting work done getting
bills paid
fixing my own health
see my own health and well-being and
that's what you're supposed to do
whoever you are you're all supposed to
be working on yourselves fixing
yourselves first
you know people get all weird and uppity
and
you know it's like fix yourself first
before you start even trying that
deal with someone else or fix someone
else you know we're so Keen the judge
and tell other people what to do haven't
even fixed yourself
so that's where I'm at I'm just saying
live philosophy
you can look in the Dr Jordan Peterson
gosh I'm just
you know talking too much gonna have a
drink of water
uh I like to study Dr Jordan Peterson
he's coming to Australia this uh in a
week yeah he's coming to Australia to Dr
Jordan Peterson he is a clinical
psychologist
look into him
and uh
he's awesome
on this again writing this down for
documentation
so he's a clinical psychologist and
University liquor
and uh the reason why he's so important
is he uses a lot of empirical data
back up what he's saying he doesn't just
say silly things off the cuff typically
not I mean we're all human he'll say
this is the data I've looked at you can
follow up later he will send you that
data he will send you the links he'll
send you the reports the research
so it's not as he just says silly things
off the coffee
he's like this is what the data shows us
10 years of research has showed us this
20 years to show us this and because of
that we can start to form more educated
decisions more logic and rationale
imagine that
and the reason why it's so important we
we live in this age of insane insane
political correctness we need to wake up
and the no more political correctness
what I mean by that is political
correctness listen to the name
political towards politicians they're
Liars their professional lives and
correctness it's a Liars it's a liar's
excuse It's not correct
the Maya right political Preakness so it
is lies
and we call them politically correct
it's just the way our politician can lie
manipulate now this is stupid
it's stupid I mean to give you an idea
we're becoming more gender neutral in
Australia
if we become gender-neutral country it
is so stupid it means you won't be able
to say hello Miss
because it's gender
all right stupid so it means you won't
even be able to shake hands with a girl
a woman you have to say hello look I
can't touch you hello gender neutral you
look very clone today and you look like
a clone because we're generally you
understand how stupid that is we'll have
to talk to each other like clones
because we're not allowed to address
gender you know it's just stupid you can
see how out of control it is and a lot
of them um a lot of them are soft
there's companies and politicians
they're soft that is scared
we can call a man on the internet now we
got the internet we can call them out
they're supposed to be we convert them
out of office if they're politicians
we're supposed to we're supposed to vote
him out of office get rid of them
they're being idiots like that and if
it's companies we can say hey we don't
have to do business with you you won't
get our money and uh and we can leave
that reviews online too you know the
power of the internet
in just a few moments thousands of
people could uh share that or put bad
reviews and bad comments online
I was very interested to see that with
another company I I was just looking
into it like it was a food company and I
won't say who it is it was a it's like a
food chain
I'm not getting all these bad reviews
online people were hating like are we
paid your food and whatever it's like
there's popular food people are still
wired like junk food like fast food
I was just like wow people wouldn't just
hate him on Facebook hating on Google
like
and it just goes to show you like for
all their fancy marketing and
advertising that the market was already
designing people were just aiding online
in Australia people were giving a lot of
negative feedback on a certain food
chain
I was like well okay yeah
they're they're pretty losing they're
going to lose sales at some point or
they're going to get into trouble at
some point
but um yeah and what made it was was how
they were dealing with it they people
were calling them out as Liars saying we
that was where the controversy came from
where they were saying that this food
chain had lied about their products and
blah blah blah who cares right just fast
food
but customers felt that opposite they're
like you're liars and whatever so
yeah yeah
it was a thing it was a thing so I was
just like wow the power of the internet
um
also
you can't guys go ahead and ask
questions can I ask questions otherwise
I'm going to keep babbling on
you know what I'm gonna get some notes I
did write down some notes earlier about
stuff that's been happening
so
since you guys are slow on the questions
keep asking questions
uh
yeah I've been vaping just to cover that
for those of you know to quit smoking
products or quit smoking if you're a
smoker save your health take care of
your thing
oh okay uh yes um
also tell a story while we're waiting I
met this really cool Filipino engineer
now it's my friend's brother so I was
visiting my Filipino friend in Dumaguete
and his brother became an engineer I
believe a civil engineer
and he went to Afghanistan on a private
contract
so his job was to help build schools and
Roads and hospitals you know the civil
engineering side so
he became friends with this guy in the
military base because that's where they
stayed you know all these contractors
and Military they had to stay inside the
base
and uh it was a pretty big base it was
one of the big ones so they had you know
cafeterias and whatever and he met the
FBI so they're like hey Filipino and
that's cool
and uh that became friends and he became
friends of his FBI guys American
and he was like just in his like
sneakers you know like uh
shelter sneakers I don't know what you
call them like Converse in a canvas
sneakers he showed me this is just
simple canvas sneakers
his brother we're in Afghanistan man you
need boots and he's like sir I'm
embarrassed I don't have boots and he
goes yo for real
he goes yes yes okay look just like
because do you like Oakley oh yeah
perfect Oakley see because you're like
okay and he goes yeah man Everyone likes
Oakley there he goes I got you some
Oakley combat boots now I knew the ones
I'm
you showed me a picture uh I know the
ones I've got similar ones I've got
Oakley SI the original Oakley standard
issue SI Boots the real special forces
boots but anyway they're just boots they
look like sneakers on steroids so anyway
uh go watch and watch the review Kane
shoe review I'll actually talk about
this stuff the shoes the boots anyway
CSR sir thank you so much you guys know
English Bro Look let's get this straight
we're together in Afghanistan yeah
don't worry about these things you need
equipment basic shoes you can't go out
in those
sneakers they're just gonna fall apart
all right so he goes yeah I know I
didn't have time to buy any proper boots
and you know I just took the contract
and jumped on the plane I need to work
you know from Philippines
from a poor family and he goes yeah look
he's brother I understand we're friends
just don't let it be a problem what else
do you need because uh maybe just gloves
and safety glasses he gets done he got
him some Oakleys you know some nice Oak
cliches and of course just some leather
gloves you know just uh like you know
riggers gloves work gloves because okay
exactly so tell me about your mission
and he goes well my mission is I gotta
go to town I need to do surveying
um you know basically Market out repair
the road put in a professional you know
asphalt road we're going to build the
school here we're going to build up
rebuild the hospital it's been blown up
you know blah blah blah
is when are you gonna do all this he
goes well full time every now I'm just
going to go into town and
particularly town and we're going to get
started he goes no you can't run around
like that now he goes we'll go together
because we'll go together alrighty
because I need to go to town too to
train the um Afghan National Police A
and B the same town so you guys okay
I'll go there I'll train the National
Police we'll go to as a group
uh join task force right we're we're
Joint Task Force now and also we'll go
with the DEA drug enforcement agency
because they're fighting the Opium
farmers and they're drug Runners and the
heroin Runners you know because they
grow a lot of opium there and the Opium
is either sold Pure or sold as heroin
so this is a Filipino around there's a
Filipino engineer and he's like holy
[ __ ] like he was it was an amazing story
I wanted to interview him but he didn't
want to be on camera
and um
really cool guy and he's a kickboxer you
know he's a real cool guy you know like
we're really fit and it's pretty cool
for a funeral he had he had these
Amazing Stories you know so he was from
Negros uh in the Dumaguete area
and then anyway this is before duterte
too this was back in
uh what Season Two Season Two that was
in um Philippine season one and two you
know I mean I was hanging out with him
so anyway so he'd come back and he was
earning good money I think he was
earning
fifty dollars I'm not sure it was fifty
dollars a day or fifty dollars an hour
all he said was fifty dollars so maybe
it's fifty dollars an hour as an
engineer and a dangerous in Afghanistan
maybe it's even less maybe it's 50 a day
anyway
you get what I'm saying yeah it might
have been even less so that's why I was
like to the DEA into the FBI it's like
guys like I need this work you know I'm
from Philippines I need it yeah we
understand brother but don't don't run
around by yourself or go with you and
you don't understand DEA are heavily
armed they look like soldiers they've
got the Chevrolet helmet the body armor
the m4s
and uh and they're chasing the drug
runners
and then you've got the normal NATO
security Force
like isaf International Security
assistance Wars or you know NATO
so then you've got the other NATO
partners and other security contractors
so anyways this is an amazing story that
this Filipino from
Dumaguete had gone all the way to
Afghanistan for work and uh and you know
luckily survive yeah they got attacked a
couple of times and he gets a bit gets a
bit uh crazy
but uh yeah it was just he was like he
wasn't showing off you could tell he's
like man like it's not fun getting shot
at you know
it's not fun risking your life you know
for whatever I think it was 55 a day I
think it was a day
because the construction company are
like yeah that's cheap labor
and for him he's like yeah that's good
work
that's why the FBI guy was very nice to
me like one he was checking him out to
make sure he was an ally he was cool
he is to have inside attacks sometimes
but two they became friends you know
Filipino and American
allies you know I have a strong
relationship
and he was like man get these guys some
boots and some safety glasses and some
gloves you know just getting some stuff
like you know don't let it be a problem
sort of thing
anyway so that was just a nice story I
wanted to share but anyway so you know
uh I think he's okay I think he's he's
still like uh I think he stopped taking
their work it was too dangerous
okay Lee w
I have a question about a visa extension
in Philippines going for three months
have to go to immigration for extending
it's okay if return ticket is three
months out right yes Lee so Lee I'm not
sure what country you're from you need
to go to your Embassy in your country so
just say you're in Australia you can go
to the Philippine Embassy here and you
can ask them for an extended Visa
right
if you don't get that sorted from the
start of the trip
they can reject you on Entry to the
country
no Visa no trip okay so this is what
guys do they do a throwaway a burner a
throwaway so some guys go there
with a round trip ticket
or a okay us uh yes Lee from the US and
look U.S is still a Allied country with
Philippines so they could probably
extend that to 60 sometimes even 90 days
but you got to go to you got to get
approval from the embassy right so just
regarding the burner
the throwaway ticket or the burner
ticket what it means is you make you
have a real ticket to go to the
Philippines and you have a second ticket
to go to Malaysia or Singapore or you
know a cheap a cheap local flight to
leave the country
you use that to get into the country
because you must have an exit ticket
okay you must have an exit ticket so
that's the catch if you if you don't
have an exit ticket they can force you
like they won't approve your your entry
into the country they can force you to
leave
um
The Grubby pirate nice I jump on at the
first word I hear the political
quickness this could be good yeah
right
uh yeah okay whatever Corey
um
so I'm just reading the question so Lee
says aloud I go all the time but listen
yeah exactly that's what I'm saying Lee
because you have a round trip
a ticket to leave the country
30 days of visa-free
okay 30 days of these are free but if
you want to go longer you're going to
have to extend your Visa so I'm telling
you how the guys do it right
so just clear your mind I'm telling you
how to do it you go into the country and
then you just keep extending once you're
inside the country
right but you have to have you have to
have a throwaway ticket you have to have
an exit ticket
no it won for three months no it won't
that's why I say just I know it gets
maybe you're getting confused go to the
Embassy firstly
go to the Embassy first call them email
them it's not hard call your local
Embassy first meaning whichever one you
is yours
ask how do I get an extended one and
what how how far can I extend right
though these are no trip I actually know
a European goal I think she was
Norwegian I mean uh Dutch yeah she was
from Norway you know nice very nice girl
she came here for a wedding you know her
friend's wedding like yeah she's coming
you know please uh you know we'll pick
you up from the airport
she didn't have a visa for Australia she
just caught on the airplane to come to
the wedding
no Visa no trip they held out at the
Australian airport Sydney Airport
and said no book another ticket go
online use the internet for free
somewhere else so she went to Thailand
she flew from Sydney airport to Thailand
yeah
no Visa no treatment
yes especially a long stay like that
just no no what you're doing
I think I've answered you well enough
Lee
so yeah you can go for 30 days or less
Visa free the Visa is the stamp when you
enter the country the Stampy is actually
a Visa like when they stamp it to say
yep you've entered the country that's
your permission to be in the country
but if you want to go longer yeah you
get an extended money in Australia um I
I know of Australians they talk about
they get 60 day ones so they apply
before they go and they get approved you
know we're allies and Friends
so yeah as Australians we get we can get
longer ones too
but what a lot of guys do is they just
extend once they're in country sometimes
they're very um go with the flow like oh
you know what I might stay longer and
they go to the local
immigration office and extend longer you
know the Filipino their local Filipino
one
so that's what all of these expats do a
lot of these expats don't have a
long-term Visa they're actually on
visiting tourist visas and they just
extend every 30 days or 60 days whatever
whatever deal they work out
and some of them are dodgy too I mean
some of them are stupid they're bribing
and doing stupid things
they shouldn't they shouldn't have to
because
that in itself could get them kicked out
of the country
okay gotcha but I was thinking that the
return ticket would work
uh
yeah it looked Lee if it can work I know
what you're saying but why don't you
confirm with the source right if the
Philippine Embassy is the source go
confirm with the major source first
otherwise you'll be just be wasting your
money you know
get confirmation first and then you'll
know what moves to make whether you get
a throwaway ticket or the normal your
normal round-trip ticket
uh I I called the Philippine Embassy
here they were actually very dismissive
they're like bro don't worry just
they'll like just extend like just go
over there have a good time and I was
like oh okay you know like so I'm very
you know as I say you know not very like
they bro just go over there have a good
time you've got an Australian passport
that's the first thing to ask they go
don't worry we like like they they have
a good relationship with Australia
you go to Australian possible just go
you know the attitude was just very I
think maybe a bit slack I think a bit
unprofessional
they're like just don't worry go over
there if you want to stay stay extended
but maybe the guy was just a bit lazy on
the phone but yeah it was cool
but that he did say he goes look it's 30
days Visa free as long as you get the
stamp going into the country you're okay
because it means you entered the country
legally that is your Visa
uh Vietnam is a sticker because the
communist country but same concept they
get a sticker and they put that sticker
in your passport that that is your Visa
um
I'd say with Thailand finally in
Stamford I hope to say with many other
countries they can stamp it but that's
the whole point the stamp is the
official you've entered this country
legally and they usually put a date on
the stamp too
so no how long you stayed it's very
simple very practical
um you know it applies to all countries
no Visa no trip but by the way uh
Vietnam was cool even in Australia they
processed my Visa in three days
they said one week they said sir be
patient one week they did it in
yeah three days I just applied I just
call them and you know fill out the form
and apply it and they said yeah done
um and they and like I said they gave me
a sticker they said come in with your
passport or you can post it to us
depending you know how you want to do it
but they do need your passport and they
just put the sticker in there
um
you good
but yeah Vietnam was not hard at all but
you do have to get that sorted out first
okay
um if you're lucky they might do it at
the border if you try to cross the
border into the Vietnam like on a bus or
saying or you know if you're backpacking
or if you just fly there on the Fly
uh they can still process you in the
airport but you have to be patient you
might be stuck in the airport for a
couple of hours or a couple of days
um but they yeah they they just say get
it first you'll get it easily whatever
country you're from just get your visa
first
um
yeah at least saying thank you okay yeah
thanks Lee
yeah um what I'll do I'll because I was
talking about this earlier I'll see I'll
find the video and I'll just post it
I'll post the video where we're talking
about it I mean it's not the sale end or
it's just to give you um
the link so I don't waste your time as
well uh these are
and um you know just to share
information dude that's not
very scary
that was with says stole that was the
video and and says and Lynn talk about
their balik Buy on Visa meaning because
he married a Filipina he got he got an
extended uh
Visa or partner visit and they had to
show their marriage papers so they they
played it safe they brought their
marriage certificate
and it's discretionary so the
immigration officer went Europe has his
passport is the marriage certificate is
his wife
okay so and it gave you my 12 month I'm
not sure if they paid I think they got
it for free
so I think it was a 12-month visa for
free
so I'm not saying
go get married just for a free Visa
but it might help the guys who are
married you know that who have wives or
husbands you know uh Partners who are
Filipina
yeah good questions I good questions Leo
I'm glad you're asking them in they're
all good keep asking questions guys how
many we got 14 watching thank you for
joining uh 14 people
that's the whole point ask questions
uh
the throwaway ticket is not confusing
Lee I just want to clarify that maybe
it's the way that I explained it
the law I'm just saying the very basic
immigration law is if you're visiting
you have to prove you are visiting
proof that you are visiting is a ticket
to leave the country
you have one ticket to come in on this
day and then you have another ticket to
leave the country on another day they
don't care how you leave
airport Seaport they don't care how you
live but you've got to leave
right some guys will literally leave for
24 hours they'll literally just reply to
Malaysia or Hong Kong
24 hours and then just fly back
or Taiwan you know that is they'll just
literally take a trip somewhere for one
day and then come back
but that's what the law says right it's
the same with uh many countries if you
have to keep your word it's about
keeping your promise keeping your word
and that's really something we should
all do
so if you made a promise that you're
only visiting 30 days or you have to
keep your promise right right you have
to keep your word
it's it's just about that
so having that ticket is proof that
you're going to leave
now you throw it away and say oops I
overstayed I better go to immigration
and extend see that's legitimate too
that's also legitimate
but you see what I mean it's to
discourage people from overstaying it's
the same in Australia if you ever stay
in Australia immigration will come after
you and kick you out bro
you
so
people try people try a friend of mine
I'll tell you an interesting story just
about which one the fact so guys ask
questions you know just join the vet
a friend of mine Aaron from Fiji he's so
stupid he overstayed and uh he kept
applying different ways of immigration
he tried doing the partner Visa oh I
fell in love with this girl in Australia
and
the immigration officer was so nice he
goes I don't I like you brother I've
been the Fiji
I don't have a problem with you don't do
this
he said if you put in these papers to
extend your your Australian visa for
your partner fall in love [ __ ] Visa
he goes brother I'm gonna investigate
you and you're going to get kicked out
of the country
you guys don't do it man yeah and this
girl she's like 18 a young girl you know
just young and trying to be trying to
help him stay in Australia so it's not
real he trees us pretending to be his uh
lover
he goes brother you're going to get this
young girl in trouble she's only she's
only 18 she's young she's gonna get into
big trouble right you can't you can't
cheat the system
so that's why he backed out and he spoke
to her father the father said look I
know what you guys are doing I like my
daughter's trying to help you but just
don't get her in any legal trouble
you see so stupid he only got her in the
big legal trouble and nearly got himself
kicked out
so anyway the point is he just kept over
saying like he kept making up more
excuses oh I want to do a student visa
and all um terrorists are trying to kill
me in fiji's
such an idiot so the immigration
obviously investigated he said okay you
want amnesty you want a refugee status
yes yes I want Refugee status in
Australia
so the immigration officer investigated
he checked with the Fijian police he of
course checked with the Australian
police and you know it took a few months
and then he said almond we've
investigated we found no evidence of um
any cases against you in Fiji no death
threats nothing like that so you've
overstayed you're now being deported and
you can't come back to Australia for
five years
he got banned from Australia for five
years idiot he said man you should have
just gone back to Vijay you could have
come back the next day you see what I
mean so yeah don't overstate
don't overstate especially in Australia
you get in the big trouble
um hello Joseph my life in Metro Manila

immigration officer goes

talk about you know I say Legos AF
Legos AF bro you know people say lit AF
on lit AF it's like Lego's AF man if you

uh yes obviously you know you're into
Motors and I'm into other things how's
it going uh Jay Jay scored Theo hello
Jay scorio yeah it's going well it's
going well brother that's the whole
point ask questions
um great chance to talk and share
it's going well oh there was a heat wave
man there was a nasty heat wave in
Australia like 40 degrees celsius so I
don't know what's that Fahrenheit 90
degrees Fahrenheit
man it was so hot you know like um air
conditioning units were failing
batteries were leaking
uh you know trucks were breaking down
and you know there was power outages and
all this crazy thing going on so yeah
and finally it's called down let me
check the weather
it's now
uh just seven oh 19 degrees today so a
bit cooler nice and sunny very
right uh Sun
but 19 degrees Celsius so I guess that's
40 degrees Fahrenheit
uh yeah it man like you'd just be
covered in sweat it was too much
it was too much the computer was
overheating you know
everything was overheating
um
what do we got we got dead management
I respect
respect dead management 101 when are you
traveling to North America for Vlogs I
was thinking about this year I don't I'm
not I'm just tossing it out
well seriously thinking about this year
or maybe soon
because I was at a point just for myself
personally like hey if I don't do it now
maybe I'll never do it and um
I would very much like to visit uh the
friends in America and just see America
for myself seriously you know uh and of
course Second Amendment we can use I
could at least try and honor the Second
Amendment and uh do some shooting
that'll be cool too
uh you gotta understand uh
for those who don't get it we can't own
AR-15 in Australia we cannot own them we
tried to get around it by having both
action ones single shot ones like it
just looks like an AR we're still not
allowed to have it they're just they
don't like anything that looks scary
it's very stupid
so even though the law does allow the
law does allow for pump action or bolt
action rifles that is then like that it
looks like an AR-15 you know the
receiver
stupid
the
yeah so that's why I get a bit excited
right there's a lot of stuff that we
can't always get sometimes sometimes it
sneaks through but you still have to be
careful
um okay when you're coming back yeah
it's uh Joseph I was thinking about
uh Joseph Ed I was thinking about now I
was thinking about now but I'm focused
on business brother
uh I've got just for me I just decided
I'm gonna focus on uh you know running
my own small business I run my own
Consulting business
and uh yeah the economy because there's
some things going on with the economy so
I want to be honest when I make sure
that's taken care of and then after that
I can
retire early hopefully I can retire
early
I say ingest but you never know because
I'm gonna have to make videos about it
because you guys aren't going to believe
it but uh
yeah anyway oh [ __ ] uh oh [ __ ] I didn't
know it could be that cold there you get
to know yet so we get we get Four
Seasons brother like up north in
Queensland we have tropical just like
Philippines
down south uh we have Snowy Mountains I
actually live near the snowy mountains
um so because I'm in a mountain region
um yeah people go skiing skiing and
snowboarding in winter in wintertime
and yeah
uh Laurie W hey Lori about 25 here in
the west of Sydney hey cool Laurie from
Sydney go up
uh nice one hey thank you for joining us
Lori yeah so uh just to make sure I'm
getting everyone the end he called
himself the end
Norway heard Norway is getting a
semi-auto rifle ban soon rifles will
um
rifles with big magazines yeah okay
that's sad the end I'm sorry to hear
that brother I hope you can still get
something man seriously
I'm not I'm not talking like crazy
look at Switzerland Switzerland has a a
perfect model
look at the history just to sum up they
were invaded in World War One
they were invited and occupied they said
we want to be neutral we choose peace
that was still invaded and occupied so
they made a law that they were allowed
to have reserves and those reserves were
allowed to keep rifles at home you look
them up they're not stupid you lock them
up at home
but if you ever need to defend the
country you have a rifle at home
and because they couldn't afford a whole
Army that's the truth they couldn't
afford a professional Army so they had
to rely on local reserves you know
people like you and me who had rifles
locked up
so Switzerland uh Switzerland is the
most armed country by Capital per capita
not by population by per capita so I
think they're 50 armed
so I know I know America's population is
bigger I'm just saying in Switzerland 50
of their people are up
because they've had a hundred years of
this uh this Reserve culture which is I
think is very brilliant you know they're
very peaceful very wealthy country
you see you can't invade Switzerland
healthy countries aren't that's why they
did it so they're very clever you see
the people would help pay for the cost
of defending the country
and that they that way they would never
be invaded that's why they weren't
invaded for World War II because I had
the best Rifleman in the world
it became a thing they were known about
having the best Riflemen and rifles in
the world they're very expensive Swiss
rifles you know they're like Swiss
Watchers
but anyway enough about my history as
you can tell I love I love history I
love studying it I studied it in school
for myself as extra credits extra
classes and then I also my primary study
was finance and law
accounting and law see I'm you know what
I'll just say yeah my if you've listened
this one my
my apartment background is accounting
and I chose to specialize in accounting
so it's all coming out now oh [ __ ] I
didn't know that okay what else are we
talking about
we have good gun laws here in Australia
no we don't
oh yeah we do excuse me uh let me
correct yes we are very strict
we have very strict gun laws in
Australia
Norway okay yeah
um
I'm sorry I'm just trying to uh go
through the comments and uh catch up
with you guys never heard of that I
thought Australia was hot always no
brother we get snow I made videos I made
videos of ice to prove it there were
hail storms ice snow yeah
but honestly in the mountains you know
because it's cold in the mountains but
even here even on the street
it just depends how far north or how far
south the further south the colder it is
yeah
the end uh is saying that's such a
confusing name the end is saying yes I
have 12 guns three pistols three
revolvers one rifle one pump 12 gauge
four semi a four semi orders
awesome I wish I could hang out with you
brother I wish we could go to the range
and train man that would be cool our
retired army your ride right he's
retired army yep hey cool man hey maybe
uh you guys have a similar policy that
when you retire from the military you're
allowed to
to keep some things as a reserve or that
you'll encourage it
but I mean I uh yeah look Europe is
changing too the map of Europe is
changing you've got the brexit you know
economic things going in the brexit the
British exit from Europe
uh different European new union members
failing and
yeah so the Europe's going through a bit
of a very tough economic time
come to Norway yeah yeah something
normal yeah why not
beautiful beautiful uh women in uh
European beautiful Vikings
descendants and Vikings your Nordic
but anyway it is very famous I think
this very famous uh martial artist in
Norway too like bazaruden
bazruta means a Dutch kickboxer and all
these things yeah there's a lot of
famous martial artists
in uh in that region the Dutch yeah
and I've watched a lot of Dutch TV
series funny enough they're just like
fictional but uh the eagle
they call it the eagle and you're
rounder round I love Brock Rona the
Viking
yeah they're famous see famous uh
Vikings and explorers
we say Ragnar in English
anyway
come on guys ask questions this is cool
that's the whole point uh
us would you like 16 people watching hey
thanks 16 people
[Music]
but yeah I don't know if Joseph is still
hanging around but yeah Joseph Mann uh
we've had chats about the economy before
so you know some people get upset but
yeah so keeping an eye on the economy
keep in mind both us and Australian
economy there's some things happening
and uh and the main thing um if you
don't have debt or you pay off debt you
won't be impacted
you won't be impacted by any type of
Downton but uh yeah it's just it's a
thing so
I don't want to get too distracted uh
yeah so the end is saying I have
tiger mini 14 to rigor 10 22s
oh rugo Ruger Mini 14 yes yes that's yep
okay 10 22s
and a 308 Browning BAR oh no way a 308
Browning BAR
no way is that is that the Browning
semi-auto rifle
I remember Browning made a semi a really
nice semi-auto um fabric National
FN FN of Belgium made a really nice 308
um and it's like a bar the design I
think I know the one you mean it's a
very nice
uh rifle nothing fancy as a YouTuber he
did a review on it he calls it the
pirate anti-pirate rifle
because pirates still attack ships
around the world especially in Africa or
Asia Southeast Asia
um yeah that'll be great at defending
against Pirates uh
I think I know what you mean that's a
nice if it's a bar you're crazy if it's
truly a bar but uh
yeah hey Browning running uh my good
good stuff because Browning is FN for
fabric National or national Factory of
Belgium
they make good stuff man
uh yeah go to Glock 19 now I thought you
had a Glock 17. Joseph saying he's got a
glock 19 now whatever
what in Philippines is that what you
mean
my brother has a ton of tons of guns
yeah your brother's cool he's actually a
shooter
you just you're just the guy you can't
hit anything
it's on camera you missed the target man
that's on you
that's on you
um
I'm just I'm just Rising you man relax
I'm just Rising my brother you know I
have a 33 round mag for Michael I know
you do oh yeah see you don't even know
what model you got me
learn your [ __ ] but uh no I'm being
I know I'm just Rising I'm just joking
around guys yeah right now it's a good
gun Glock 17 is a good gun it's what I
don't like about Glocks I don't like the
um the grip I'll show you
they've got a very bulky group
so the nature of the grip this is just a
training tool right just a journey talk
obviously for training uh see it's very
Square very blocky
very very sharp edges very blocky and
those finger grooves are very annoying
right so the problem is when you hold it
it doesn't fill up the wave of your hand
it doesn't feel like that that web you
get this weird block like that
okay so anyway I'm not I can use them
you throw me throw me a G9 I'll use it
it's not a problem I've got videos on
that shooting blocks all right it's not
a problem but uh they're more suitable
for people with decance if you have big
games you wrap your big mix around it
yeah and then there's you know different
grip modifications I don't like that I
don't like having to modify it too much
some guys even file off the finger
groups
so if you threw me one and said this was
yours like if you gave me your Glock I
would fall off the finger grooves
not much like you just get a file and
carefully take that off and I'd actually
put on one of those
extra pads back here just a bit more of
a grip pad
that's if you gave me one if you gave me
one for free otherwise I would spend my
money on something else
there's a plethora of choice there's so
many good options there
I'm not saying
one is necessarily better than the other
I'm just saying there's lots of choices
now I'd rather go something else
um
yeah I saw that video you have a Joseph
has a glockensoft video yep uh Lori W oh
sorry and the end is saying I have a
Walther nine millimeter P99 hey that's a
that's an expensive gun they weren't
successful because I was so expensive
and now you got the PPQ
the PPQ is the new version which is a
bit more affordable and still very
accurate yeah they're very not that's
James Bond
P99 is a James one gun uh HK Mark 23
Socom 45 no way that is a very
physically big gun
it's a very good one that's a very big
handgun
um US Special Forces uh Socom stop using
it because it was so big it was it was
totally fine with the suppressor you
know Big King gun but it was too big so
now they're using USP compacts HK USB
complex they're compact uh version so
they're calling it The USP tactical all
it is is a compact USB a handgun with a
threaded barrel to put the suppressor
but yeah I also in the end those are

[Music]
yeah you got a vlog 19 Airsoft I thought
that was actually a good video where you
covered the difference between the
airsoft and the the real one
and the end is saying he's got to
silence say hey cool man that's cool
yeah different countries some countries
prefer silences it's not a James Bond
guys it's not like the Hollywood movies
it's because it's layout they hurt your
ears it'll make you go deaf if you don't
wear ear protection so some countries
are cool like that because they realize
it's noises pollution
uh it's actually it's actually safe of
to your ears to put a suppressor
it's not it's not totally quiet it still
makes noise so it's much safer and to
clean a shot to you in regards to
Marksmanship it's a cleaner shot there's
less burning gunpowder and Flash and
blast
so you get a cleaner shot yeah
and that's why Marksman used them again
it's not some
secret ninja thing it's because it's it
helps you shoot better
oh okay thank you you've seen my
shooting videos hey thanks man
yep and just the same is shooting Angel

you know the roller locking technology
it's it's the roller locking delayed
blowback that HK so famous for it's it's
great but it's just a bit old
they're designed the overall design but
it's still good
it's still still very good yeah they're
still accurate reliable tough
um the proof is in the pointing I mean
those designs are from the 60s and
they're still
a lot a lot of that equipment mp5s g3s

motorbike picture because that's all I
know about you sorry bro you got a
picture of a motorbike so get some
get some picks up man
you know just for fun or get some short
videos after fun you know why someone
says legal I have Sansa on my Remington
700 Trail light oh nice
yeah yeah there were the Remington 700
became famous because um
the US Military and many SWAT teams and
that use it it's it's just another rifle
uh there's so many competitive options
there I'm not rezzing and I'm saying
it's good
but there's so many good ones out now
you know from Savage
um of course Winchester who was Mossberg
Mossberg will be making some very nice
economy rifles like that affordable you
know like bolt actions but they're very
nice very accurate
I'll surprise same with Savage
there's no one and you've got Winchester
yeah you've got Ruger yeah they're all
doing it yeah that's cool so Remington
700 classic sniper rifle yeah
yeah
um
keep them coming guys keep them gone
I heard the new he's saying the new
Norway uh Army raffle is the HK416 and
417
both very nice both they're very
expensive
so typical HK over engineered they're
very reliable
very accurate both them too the 417
especially in 308 yeah I've seen the
civilian version many just guys
demonstrating it and very accurate very
nice it's meant to be a DMR designate
designated Marksman rifle
but it shoots MOA guys have brewed it
shoots MOA very accurate yeah so
did Mantra and as you can tell look I'm
gone [ __ ] as you can tell I pray like
to visit USA probably the most uh we'll
see unless maybe I'll go to Norway and
meet beautiful women and shoot guns over
there with it my new friend
for real bro came with natural come over
and we'll go shooting
um yeah now probably USA just just
because you know historically there's so
much Rich history
I have American friends you guys speak
English I can modify my accent if it's a
little too strong
speak American
you can go to the range and do some
plinking
uh
Michael Strong question when you visited
that gun shop in Cebu did you notice if
they sold full auto trigger groups uh do
you mean the handgun the handgun rain
the handgun video
there's a there was an old maybe if
you're good Michael um I had a very old
video
where I did go to some other stores
um
but very brief and my camera work wasn't
good said answer your question no
I know but
uh I uh
Michael I'll show you I'll show you some
full auto trigger groups no no no
actually I did I think Michael I did
show you some videos
yeah he's saying the rapper yeah yeah
the lwc rep uh r-e-p-r
um yeah yeah no Michael hey you're
clearly a Precision shooter but for the
military all I get is what they issued
so if you're like here's your military
rifle off you go they don't get a choice
so at least that they've got it in the
Armory you know how it is
they don't get to choose the best
Precision rifles like you can
um
yeah so no to answer your question no
that was on school Subaru they don't
sell they don't typically sell
um full auto true groups I did see spare
like 1911 triggers
you know so as a part they might have
some parts but not not the full auto
receivers I have seen full auto
receivers though in Philippines
um coffee thing the car 15 is the cut
down the M16
from that Vietnam period Vietnam War
period so
yeah I saw a car 15 and I saw an impul a
more modern info for water and a M16
the M16 had a AR-15 full auto trigger
group before the
the band before the U.S band so
obviously it's a historical
type of lower receiver
um
oh yeah okay so the end is saying he can
buy the civilian version of practical
shooting in semi-auto yep cool that's
cool man
but it sounds like it's getting strict
they're trying to ban it in your in your
area in Norway
yes Bushmaster AR-15 hey they used to be
good
I don't know what time period Bushmaster
used to be uh really like even
apparently
like U.S Special Forces would buy the
upper receiver
built by just the upper and then put it
on their full auto military laws so yeah
I mean the military were using them for
spare parts and spare uploads yeah
in the past in the past now now
Bushmaster has been bought out by
venture capitalist company
so at an investment firm
you know Finance go and bought them out
and it's a totally different company the
new the original company is now called
Windham Armory
Windham is a town in America or so
Windham reopened as Wyndham Armory
oh hey Canadian commodity we're talking
about you man I like to eat chili yeah
we're just talking about you man Legos
Legos AF
a Canadian gay Lego no I'm just joking I
was talking about you that the meaning
of commodity Commodities like badass
the badass motorbike Rider yeah if
you're into motorbikes check out
Canadian commodity Rider
I was just talking about your Kawasaki
Ninja how you went dude you went on the
dirt roads with a Kawasaki Ninja which
is a street bike
that's cool hey commodity
yes just hunting semi-autos with big
mags yes yeah I see so they're doing
magazine restrictions yeah
in Europe he's talking about Europe uh
Michael stronger lives in California so
yeah it's depressing here when it comes
to high speed
hey at least you can still get some
stuff of good wine
tools this is a good training tool
though seriously this is a good drink
it's good for martial arts that's why I
can do like disarming techniques and
it's it's much easier to train people
too because clearly it's inert
they want they want doing things so it's
much safer for training people and
instructing
or a past life
anyway
yeah okay
yes you did
oh Craig K hello Craig
okay I'm just giving people shout outs
oh buyer Matos
hey hey um Matos
thank you for joining us I mean it
oh I say you've got a you've got a
little bit of a channel so you've got
some videos up all right
it's 3am in Norway oh well thank you for
joining us hey you look yeah that's what
I did it this time because the the time
difference with the Americas can be so
different too so hey look I appreciate
you joining us man
uh I I'm hoping it's like Saturday
in Norway Let me let me Google it
yes 300 on Sunday what
man if if you're late for work tomorrow
tell them tell your boss you're watching
the adventures you know
send them to my channel
I'll give you a shout out and say yeah
no way it was represented
Norway was represented cool did you need
to hit Port Barton I I was going to
Craig okay thanks um I was going to but
the locals wouldn't take us I'm not I'm
not joking we're in El Nido and man
skip El Nido is a waste of time is this
a fishing Village run down fishing
Village you know the electricity didn't
work the water didn't work there was
constant outages
power and water outages there was no
phone signal no internet scene all the
time
you know and they wouldn't take us the
locals didn't take us because they were
wanting us to spend our money in El Nino
and that type of attitude you know that
type of corrupt disgusting attitude you
know we're like hey we'll pay good money
please take us to in the van
foreign
jokes
jokes you know I know we we should have
uh
come up with a better solution but we're
like gosh man you know
and we said why why wouldn't you take us
there there's nothing that stay stay in
El Nido you see what I mean like very
Petty
very Petty you know they would rather
trap us in El Nido and we'd be unhappy
so you leave El Nino with a bad
impression you know and you can
understand that a lot of people are bull
crapping it's not that I'm hating on El
Nido a lot of people are bullcrapping I
don't know why they keep bullcrapping
acting like oh it's so cool you go there
and you get disappointed
I'm not kidding every one of my viewers
who has been there
has messaged me to at least say yeah
you're all right man they we got tricked
we went there and we got tricked or we
went there we got scanned you know
anyway so Paul Barton is near El Nido
Apollo one for those who don't
understand it's only whatever in an hour
or two's drive a couple hours drive
something like that uh it's not that far
uh and yeah it's much more pristine you
know very nice so yeah I've heard good
things A friend of mine has been there
anyway and covered a couple of friends
have been there
so enough about that so I don't get
carried away
um
Michael Strong any issues bringing in
rifles in the Philippines for
recreational purposes
you could because you can legally import
them
but it's very expensive you know
corruption fee import tax blah blah blah
fee bribe whatever
uh yeah so I mean like they can get
AR-15s so they can get just about
anything but you've got to you know
obviously talk to a licensed gun store
they will import it
so forth so yeah look um
I I mean competition Shooters do it so
you could inquire
you can absolutely inquire with the the
the department of firearms
Department the Philippines Department of
firearms yeah I can send you a link if
you want
and you could inquire with them yeah and
you could definitely inquire with the
embassy you could say like hey as a
competition shooter
like oh yeah yeah because competition
Shooters have to do that they have to
bring their equipment with them to
compete around the world it's very
very annoying
but you certainly can't do it
stay there a month
look at my series Greg okay I have
Philippine season one two three and four
whole travel series
anyway I have stayed there for some time
the end I am retired army so I have good
army pension oh cool
oh I see well maybe yeah
you could easily leave um
leave them if you have good army pension
yeah you just have to be smart you know
I mean people will try to
overprice they will try to charge you
extra as far enough but you'd be nice be
respectful try to learn the language you
know just try to learn the local culture
not perfect just try people notice the
difference you know if you're always
being uh rude and snobby
of course they will try to achieve you
but if you're being nice trying to fit
in yeah but look some of the best advice
I got is look as a foreigner you're
always a Target
you're always a Target so I knew of a
very successful Foreigner he's a
businessman
British businessman
he said mate look I'm 42 he's very
successful he goes to the Philippines
six months he lives Philippine six
months and then uh back in England
near London for six months so of course
he runs his business and then
just comes to the Philippines whenever
and it's better to have that option
because sometimes uh
how can I say it sometimes you miss the
Western standards the good medical
you know good living standard clean
uh so for him it's a good mix even
though he's uh flying back and forth
like that
so yeah the point is to have options
don't make any big decisions you know
rent rent out if you have to leave in a
hurry if something happens
earthquake super typhoon you can just
quickly they have a lot of natural
disasters or if someone targets you to
try and kidnap you or Rob you you know
if you're getting harassed yeah you need
to leave very quickly
uh
dead management 7 PM Saturday here in
Calgary Canada hey call Dad imagine
you're from Canada
you've got maple syrup Dr Peterson
Nickelback
uh
uh marijuana
yeah awesome good on you um Canadians in
the outdoors
Michael Strong oh I wasn't being
specific bring rifle make holes in
things then leave with that oh
yeah oh yeah okay yeah sure well that's
what I do yeah I go over there and grab
a rifle it seems like
uh Celine Dion yeah Celine Dion well
well done yeah so we've got the calls
going on there
yeah so Michael I mean you've seen my
videos yeah I like to I like to hit the
range as soon as possible and also I've
hung out with some security contractors
and some security guys over there
uh it's fine meaning you know like I
like I like
the old uh gun thing so
what's the what's dead management saying
something about
all right you can you can legally shoot
in Canada yeah good on you and I heard
like
you know different limits like five
round capacity or 10 Rand capacity like
you guys can get AR-15s
and use a 10 round magazine
uh but it has to be the pistol magazine
there's a there's an AR pistol you know
it's a shorty AR pistol so because it's
a pistol magazine they can put 10 Rounds
in it something like that
anyway a lot of guys know about it but
yeah it's cool I saw some videos on it
some some Canadian shooters that was
cool
ask questions guys
yeah no but you can get around it
there's a workaround and it's legal
if the magazine was designed from the
factory to hold 10 Rounds you can use it
you can use it
so for example
if a 10 round 40 caliber handgun
magazine
fits in a nine millimeter which it does
and it can hold an extra round or two
then you're allowed to use it
so if you have a 10 round AR-15 magazine
that was meant for a handgun a pistol
I know I cut down pistol because it was
classified for a pistol you're allowed
to use it in the rifle it's silly it's a
workaround it's silly they should
disallow it
they should just make it legal but
Canada you know
provincial governments and your bill c16
your bull crap gender pronouns we'll
talk about that earlier so yeah that's
what I was talking about earlier guys in
in Canada they have um compelled speech
compelled speech means the government
controls how you speak
and it means you don't have freedom of
speech anymore and it's just amazing you
Canadians are supposed to be protesting
peacefully email your government say hey
we're not happy you took away freedom of
speech
you know like you guys need to wake up
because if you don't have freedom of
speech anymore
uh in Philippines um not that I know
actually
getting excited I don't believe there's
a magazine capacity in Philippines I
don't believe so
I don't believe so
um
it's more I'm being actually serious
it's more what you can get your hands on
scarcity is always an issue in
Philippines you know it's not what
people think Hollywood
guns are expensive and scarce so just
finding the parts is a problem
and um I learned a lot from that you
don't get to choose it's not like you
know in America you get to pick all
these accessories if if all you have is
a weekly old M16 from Vietnam War like I
didn't believe it until I saw this the
serial number
and when I saw the stamping the markings
I was like oh man this is all this is
M16 A1 or M16 depending original
uh I I didn't realize how old they were
so yeah if that's all you have that's
all you have
even getting a new recall spring is a
problem I was like damn guys you need
new wrinkle Springs like that that's all
yeah
but I don't even clean the barrel
sometimes too they're very naughty you
know maintenance you know different
different attitude towards maintenance
they clean the outside
but they don't clean the inside you've
got to clean the internals guys you got
to put some oil in there anything put
motor oil just put something in there
guys get so weird about oil and
lubricant
so um yeah Michael yes what you can get
away with it's not it's not even like
like even if you can find a drum
even a Magpul Pmag is so expensive you
know in America they're 10 bucks
it's about 10 or 12 dollars for a Magpul
Pmag which are excellent magazines
they were created from polymer to make
them affordable
in Philippines they're like eighty
dollars
they're like 80 for a PMAG it's insane
in Australia too by the way in Australia
they're about 90 to 100 for a b mate
it's insane so you're price gouging
because of all the taxes and
regulation is stupid
corruption
it's certainly you know Magpul Pmag
should not be a hundred dollars it's an
affordable polymer you know plastic
style amazing
and they're very reliable don't get me
wrong they're high reliability
but they'll design that way to be
disposable so it's semi-indisposable so
you can use them reuse them but if you
lose it break it throw it away lose it
in combat that's the whole point you're
not worried
uh that is why I'm asking because I was
thinking about bringing the wrapper to
Cebu drop the full auto trigger group oh
all right right yeah yeah you could try
you were running for a lot of issues
Michael and I think that you would
sooner get ripped off people would try
to cheat you or steal your rifle
yeah you could do that you could
absolutely do that uh like right yeah
I'll see what you mean bring your rifle
and then work on it in Philippines like
swap parts have your phone swap back
because I mean technically it's like a
competition shooter you would bring a
rifle for the competition
complete the competition and then go
back yeah it's just a lot of hassle
brother
a lot of outside everyone's going to
want a commission and a fee and
everyone's going to be trying to charge
you a thousand dollars for some bull
crap
you know people are going to try and
steal it from you
yeah I know what you're saying brother I
mean
Michael you might want to go to like go
go do the tourism thing just go there
and enjoy some ranges as a tourist or
even locally you know Nevada don't you
have some
full auto ranges in uh Las Vegas or
whatever
you see what I mean you know you want to
have some fun you can have some fun
but yeah I wouldn't I wouldn't bring
your own equipment it's just too much of
a hassle unless you're competing if
you're doing a professional competition
obviously you enter and try to win the
competition you know represent your
country
uh
everything in Australia is expensive
expensive expensive yes Corey Canadian
commodity yes
that's why we have the magic of eBay and
Amazon
uh I mean I was talking about it before
I was talking about the ssds you know
look I'm going to keep doing it assume
it uh
hard drives oh and this is a show and
tell this is a CD case CD-ROM for the
computer laptop
or any computer and that way you can put
a spare hard drive so if you want to
backup hard drive if you never use your
CD-ROM you want to see the optical disk
drive
yeah you can put in one of these and put
in a spare hard drive if they're cool I
was going to make it I was going to do
that but I think I won't bother we'll
see you
we'll see you know chime in leave
feedback try me see these ssds high
speed hard drives this guy was resident
on me like oh you're rich you're worth
it it's like it's just a hard drive
it's just a computer mod and this guy's
resume like someone I knew oh you're
rich like in Australia I was like bro
save up
okay bro you drink cases of beer you
party you know stop drinking save up and
buy some hard drugs because he's a gamer
he likes playing computer games
so I wasn't Rising him back I was like
man you're my friend just yeah they're
cool but it was causing problems people
were acting like I'm rich because I got
Samsung ssds but they're cool I did pay
a premium oh so back excuse me back on
point I paid a premium the prices
recently came down just this year I
noticed like we couldn't get our hands
on them in Australia just for the
audiences I understand
we we couldn't get them in Australia so
I had to buy it off Amazon
and I'm very happy I did I got it from
Marcela in Florida USA thank you Florida
USA uh I got this one from uh another
vendor in Australia but he he was on
selling he got he got from China
whatever but they're all genuine they're
all genuine Samsung ssds these are hard
drives for the computer for those who
don't understand super fast high speed
so you can watch my SSD videos but my
point is uh yeah guys it's not just
being silly like I couldn't find them I
just literally couldn't find them in my
locality and and when I did people were
charging
like 300 for this
I paid I paid 120 120 Australian for
this one that's what I paid
people were trying to pay charge 300
come on it's a report
and people were trying to charge a
thousand dollars I saw one on sale 600.
on sale in Australia 600 this is stupid
so I got I got mine uh for 400 I think
400 Australian from Amazon seller at the
time I'm just saying ages ago at the
time it was a good deal because you just
couldn't find them
now the prices could come down I've seen
these for 200. 250 ish 200 250 ish so
that's what I mean it's just getting
more and more affordable so it's cool
anyway let's keep going I'm getting
carried away
okay so the end on Norway AR-15 is legal
if you are shooting in competition
orgs and Arsenal AKA uh yeah oh I see
what you mean because the Australian
military is the style orc guys it's
called an acronym you pronounce the
acronym together you don't say Aug but
you can if you want so yeah in Australia
we use this Aug or style org
you need a reason
yeah but we can't we can't own them as
souvenirs you know in the military and
Arsenal AK is a nice year Arsenal play
Arsenal Bulgaria Maybe
well Bulgarian AKs are nice yeah they're
not don't underestimate Chinese
um ones if you could own them in Norway
it could it's a narenkos even just as
well
I don't know how much they cost there
but I was I was impressed on being
honest guys I was impressed with the
Norinco handguns a Norinco M4 carbine
uh yeah I was impressed um narenko 1911s
mp5s
they worked like I can't complain that's
why I was impressed I was worried it
might blow up but they all
they all work just fine
um that's what I plan to do to go to
Cebu visit a range again yeah okay
uh yeah Michael I mean if you're on
Facebook you can message me on Facebook

magical eBay and Amazon yep yep hey I
had to buy car parts too I'm like I
couldn't find a radiator for my car
and the one I found was inferior quality
it was a really poor quality one for 400
I got a beautiful aluminum aluminum
aluminum hey I love you like I said
beautiful alloy racing radiator just a
single um
single core not one of those really
thick ones but just a direct replacement
for 200 bucks half the price so I got
myself a racing radiator for my car like
I call high performance one it's just a
radiator
uh for half the price yeah so
it's Australian man sometimes we're very
uncompetitive sometimes they're very
behind
yeah um we have two dollar shops you
know we have the two dollar store one
dollar store
yeah we have we have junk shops here
yeah and they're handy too just to get
the job done
but uh online brother sometimes we we
have to like I said I didn't it wasn't
that I wanted to buy a radiator online I
realized it might be a risk
but hey they did good they were they
were a good uh
Workshop the business was a actually a
you know a specializing car parts and
it was fine it worked out fine fixed my
car perfect it was actually a
performance upgrade yeah it worked out
perfect
uh

the resin band waterproof practical but
it's still got a little bit of a gold
little bling bling

yeah I've bought a lot of stuff of
Gumtree too that's cool and uh and
Facebook classifieds Facebook's doing
Marketplace Facebook's trying to do the
classified thing too so yeah yeah
technology man connecting us
Michael Strong yeah he's absolutely
right uh a 250 Gigabyte SSD is thirty
dollars is what he's saying yeah exactly
brother
like I knew I'm looking online I knew
they're ripping us off I was like
six hundred dollars I mean one terabyte
let's be fair one terabyte Samsung A50
Pro this is top of the rank top of the
line SSD I know this is an older model
now
600 bucks for a one terabyte come on man
they're ripping us off yeah
so I look free market that's why we have
these markets and good on those vendors
for helping us out yeah
yeah aluminum is the way to go so the
problem is it's a Honda
uh Michael uh Honda for some reason like
to use a polymer top tank so the
radiator body is aluminum and then they
put a polymer top tank and it changes
color when it gets old and cracks
so it's a bit counter-intuitive so
that's why I went no I don't want to I
don't want to get into the deployment
redhead as they crack
um
400 Au is 370 Canadian yeah well I'm a
boy man
hey Legos Legos AF Corey Legos
Glory I'm a baller bro I'm a Gangster I
gotta
Pro SSD yeah I'm slapping down the big
money
ain't no one's sponsoring me on payment
only
uh no I'm just joking guys come on relax
but it's that's what I mean it's a thing
my friend was Rising me oh you're rich
I was like bro stop drinking he takes
you know he takes drugs and you drink I
was like bro stop drinking and taking
drugs
um
yeah how many gigabytes uh so this is
one terabyte one terabyte and this is
500 gig
and for anyone who follows me I tested
the 750 that the 750 Evo the entry level
version also excellent
also excellent Samsung will stop making
it Samsung are cool they went you know
what let's not make this 750 let's just
make the good the good stuff so yeah
save your panties man get a Samsung
uh in hindsight I should have just got
the evos because they're more affordable
and they're just as good
they're just as good I I wanted to test
the pro because I do a lot of video
editing and that's well worth it for me
I just me you know oh Gucci okay you
know I wanted to get the good ones I
wanted to get the Louis Vuitton the
Gucci bag you know
uh anyway I'll get attracted um my name
is David yeah David well thank you uh
for joining us David yeah you're cool
man David from Norway David the Viking
Australia has a huge racing industry
right uh not any yeah not anymore
because we shot down our Poland
manufacturing uh made like a lot of
muscle cars V8s and v6s uh yeah so hold
in shut down uh Ford Ford Australia uh I
think you're shutting down they made you
know four V8s and turbos and
yeah they made some good cars actually a
friend of mine had the Ford fpv
oh muscle car big V8 oh man I had two
friends actually had fpv's and another
guy had an xr6 turbo you know six
cylinder turbo oh man yeah
and um
and you know so the holding fans think
of you know plenty of Holden V8s uh what
do you call the club sports hsvs
yeah so we used to Michael we used to
have a lot of these muscle cars and then
just uh
the manufacturing died off so we still
have races like at sports events if you
want to attend some
race car vans and stuff yeah but uh yeah
sad man when they're losing the car
manufacturing
like like not just to be like uh support
Australia um it's sad man it was nice it
was nice that we made cars here but the
companies fall behind that was the
problem it's
it's a good old thing of uh they forgot
how to adapt
those who survive are not the strongest
and not the smartest and not the fastest
it's the ones who adapt
they didn't adapt they didn't adapt and
uh yeah they went out of business you
know
so very cliche but you know that's life
uh okay so let's keep going
I'm getting I'm getting [ __ ] I'm
getting carried away getting excited
yeah okay dead management yeah you like
eBay yeah nothing wrong with eBay like
eBay changes the world I'm not kidding
you in a good way you're connected us
you know I don't care like we could have
been doing business and we're helping
each other out like awesome
connecting people
uh
that's too much is what I meant all
right right
well Corey I don't know maybe um
maybe one day you'll man up and get an
SSD
Corey's my friend because I didn't come
out to Cory's my friend I'm just
arresting you gory man up man up brother
come on look on look on Amazon uh Canada
doors and look on Amazon
book on eBay you know don't you have
classifieds or something yeah
whatever
so that is true plus uh Michael Strong
is saying that is true Plastics will
crack eventually usually when it cracks
the thermostat is sticking
yep that's what happened the the
thermostat was sticking and the pump was
over pressuring
yeah yeah uh hey you know your stuff
Michael yep that's exactly what happened
and I I paid 30 for a new um thermostat
uh that was that was okay
I sometimes catch the Australian V8
Supercars yeah I used to watch it too
not anymore I I don't really watch TV I
mean I just you know on the internet
that's what guys gotta understand these
things are cool smartphones
entertainment has been decentralized no
one watches TV anymore I mean people use
TVs to put the internet they're putting
internet on there but yeah
the internet killed the TV
I was just saying at the start you know
I was watching uh El Chapo a TV series
El Chapo but I was watching it on the
internet I was watching it on my
computer
so that's why computers are so cool you
can do so much with them uh work as well
as entertainment entertainment center
yeah
cool
yes keep them coming guys keep the
questions coming
uh I saw us capture yet all right
but as you can tell I got a bit I got a
bit obsessed with the whole SSD thing
just because it's a technology Elite for
me it's really increased my work
efficiency
so whether it's office work typing up
reports emailing
you know hundreds of files
the nature of what you do on a computer
the computer must always access the
files on the hard drive
right so the computer the brain the CPU
must always access the hard drive you
know of the operating system so
obviously my operating system is
installed on
so if this is super fast SSD hey awesome
the brain can work faster you know so it
increases your work efficiency and a lot
of the technos don't realize that like I
I have had 6 000 files transferred in a
month
because of video editing because of my
business work office work 6 000 files
so your average person may not transfer
that many photos and videos and editing
so when you're transferring that many
files you need the efficiency yeah I
mean
you know not everyone will go that far
so I mean I don't do I don't do that
much uh files editing and transferring
all the time but yeah
yeah man El Chapo is awesome J J saying
it yeah yeah it's a good series right
and it covers the Mexican history like
respect respect to Mexico it just at
least helps foreigners like us just
seeing a little bit more history as well
El Chapo's still at New York got hurt on
trial yeah he's still the real El Chapo
is still on trial yeah they're
complaining because they made this
series and saying oh it's going to
influence the troll
no [ __ ] he was already on the news
anyway you know
silly so anyway uh Canadian committee
writer I haven't had cable TV service in
my house in years yeah me neither man I
mean I've never had cable my friends
have we used to go to the houses to
watch you know the sports game or a cool
TV show
um you know as a catch up
as well so it's like oh Thursday night
let's watch Sons of Anarchy at this
person's house you know
uh Laurie Laurie Laurie sometimes I
switch the TV off and watch episodes of
video yeah thanks anyway that's people
people are telling me and I do it too
like oh if I'm on a TV like a smart TV I
don't watch TV I'll watch the internet
oh watch yeah watch YouTube channels on
Netflix
um
well I'm a Amo I'm gonna run down ammo
on Netflix ammo on Netflix
look it up ammo Philippines that's a
it's a Philippine series
I'm gonna write down for you guys ammo
on uh ammo Philippines or Netflix it's a
really cool series and uh it's about you
know the whole War on Drugs you know
it's about the lives of people you know
in the War on Drugs in Philippines
but the reason why it's so important you
know it's just you know snapshot for the
people who don't understand what's going
on but it shows they can make a
professional Netflix series I mean it
respect say to the Filipinos don't get
upset it shows you can make a
professional
Netflix series the whole world can say
hey at least you're making a
something to contribute you know Mexico
making El Chapo and uh narcos that's a
there's a TV series narcos you know for
Colombia it's not to say they're bad
countries is a show they can make
professional movies professionally
entertainment
the
still going yeah Joseph you're back
you're still going oh crap man I've been
talking for a while
hello how long I've been diving for my
goodness
oh my goodness
because I started at 11.
uh 12-1 oh geez two and a half hours so
guys I'm gonna take you to the people
watching I might wrap it up
I might wrap it up
if you guys don't ask much more
questions or not many more people are
going to join us I'm just going to recap
too guys uh because you know I'm gonna
start something up uh Happy Chinese New
Year or Happy Lunar New Year I'll put a
link on my Facebook page so you can
choose your your lunar symbol your star
sign so to speak

telling so I'm I'm born and you're the
pig and 2019 is the year of the pig so
it's going to be hopefully a prosperous
year for me retire early
uh what else we got yeah we already
talked about the laptop upgrade so check
out my ram upgrade videos and my SSD
upgrade videos
just to learn just to learn what the
hell they are you don't have to be an
expert
get it done
um
yeah so also we're talking about some
other popular themes look guys I'm not
kidding 2019 you look at Gary Vayner
there's so many
really good public speakers and and like
motivators unless they're talking about
it
man it's all about honesty now it's all
about honesty online because these
things expose this phones
these things are good smartphones
iPhones whatever they expose this
so if you keep bullcrapping a line
you're just going to get exposed at some
point
uh so you know honestly honestly it's
becoming a a good Trend online on social
media I know it sounds so hokey to say
it like that but
it's like funneling finally we're going
to crush those bullshitters we're going
to crush all those people that that kept
lying and bullcrapping for their
whatever their fee their monetization
their bull crap you know I'm talking
about you know the 22 year old life
coaches oh I'm a 23 year old life coach
pay me a fee and I'll tell you how to
get rich yeah
you know they do weird things too they
they rent they rent mansions to show off
it's not really an end that they just
rent a expensive place to show off or
they rent a Lamborghini to shop yeah
weird things like that really weird you
know con artists yeah that's what I'm
trying to say the Quan the con artists
the scammers
yeah this game has been calling him out
man so it's become a thing so Gary
Vayner his real name is Gary vaynerchuk
he's a very big YouTuber and or social
media expert he actually runs a media
company
so he's a millionaire this guy right
he's a multi-millionaire so Gary
vaynerchuk's been talking a lot about it
I've been following garyvee
so he uses garyvee for sure
um yeah he's cool man I don't all right
then garyvee
yeah he's a social media expert man that
guy
uh what else uh yeah I did questions and
answers for Philippines and Southeast
Asia or in general but there wasn't that
many questions but hey thanks guys I
appreciate it I appreciate all of you
who did come and ask questions and jump
in even just the watch or listen
uh I should have a little bit of a
trouble story yeah and um
scams and crazy experiences yes I'll
finish up with that too guys in
Southeast Asia I've been talking to
other people too and I've traveled to
other countries I just haven't always
covered it so I've been to Malaysia
Singapore Thailand Vietnam
Philippines
and I've been to uh Europe as well I've
been to
um the Netherlands which is Norway I
guess
I always get that confused uh Amsterdam
which is in Netherlands which is in
Hawaii
you get one so I've been to Amsterdam
uh we're also in the Italy
Israel
Australia of course
yeah I think that's
I think that's it for now
so yeah you get the idea but I didn't
always I wasn't vlogging back then I
wasn't always covering it but uh yeah
you always got to watch out for these
games when people are skimming cash
anything to do with cash and you guys
know it must be the same in Europe in
America I've seen cash games here in
Australia that's why we shop online now
that's why we use credit card and
Bangkok
we don't use uh cash bills cash notes
anymore
and uh because it causes so many scams
and corruption in crime and a Chinese
businessman Jack Ma I think it's Jack Ma
he's a billionaire he went to the
Philippines to talk about business and
uh you know just to give a conference
and he said guys best advice you can
give you
internet go online in Philippines go
online do everything online Internet or
digital you can do it all on your phone
but the reason why it'll reduce
corruption all those cash games and
skimming
so for those who don't understand
they'll purposely jug up the price in
cash no Trace they purposely won't give
you a receipt always ask for a receipt
and uh you'll get upset like you pay for
your hotel cash
you don't get a receipt
next thing
because you say you paid for two days or
something or three days
oh sir oh Ma'am Excuse Me Miss you need
to pay for your hotel like no I paid on
arrival I paid yesterday oh do you have
a receipt
no receipt no pay pay again
you're getting very upset
same with the tour you go on a tour
you got no receipt or you have to pay
again
time at the restaurant see it gets
annoying you have to pay it again
you know or they keep changing the price
you see so
things like that you know the price on
the menu was 500 pesos for the meal uh
or 200 pesos Suddenly It's a thousand
what happened you know so and you got to
be tough so just pay what you think is
fair and get out of there it might cause
an altercation or whatever or like I
said get a receipt always get a receipt
uh and I asked them to itemize it always
ask them to itemize it because it may be
a misunderstanding like you've got to
just be careful you don't make
accusations straight away
maybe they'll itemize it and say oh okay
you didn't realize all the items you did
order or did not order
so you can determine hey that's not mine
why are these extra items on here
see okay so you go no take these ones
off these are mine see one two three or
whatever and you pay for what's fair
Yeah well yeah exactly right Joseph's
saying he would go off yeah you're gonna
make a scene guys
you gotta be tough You're Gonna Make a
Scene scream whatever
because uh sometimes they're just taking
advantage you know and people always get
pissed off local Filipinos always get
pissed off when I ask for a receipt I
say it with a smile not sponsors Miss
I understand you're doing your job at
the hotel well I understand you're doing
a job uh at this place you know please
can I have a receipt you know like that
just saying nicely like oh how dare you
are you saying I'm dishonest to go no
by law
usually there's a sign next to the
register by law you must provide receipt
no receipt no pay
you say you sound like that they can get
pissed off let them get pissed off don't
worry
because otherwise like I said they're
going to say the same to you oh no
receipt no pay you pay again you know
you pay more
anyway I just wanted not to stir anyone
up just to get that out of the way it's
a common problem but hey to be fair you
can't be uppity you can't be snobbly
because that happens in Australia
uh I've dealt with people who try to do
that in Australia too and I said oh
that's okay no receipt no pay well I
just told them um guys if you want to do
this like I know what you're doing
you're trying to scare me
I'm Gonna Leave a bad review online
that has been quiet I said if you if you
do this and I'll leave a battle review
online okay like everyone fair warning
I'll put a bad review
crush them
that bad review and crush them then
because you know people were like oh man
they're Dodges yeah
so you'd be surprised the power on the
internet I didn't do that to be mean I
was very nice and I said guys be cool
we had a deal charge me what's the
proper price and give me a receipt
no problem and this is in Australia
they want him to play okay they've got
to pay
so that's a that's a good one too I mean
don't don't be mean about it you've got
to be fair but I I was fair I said I
gave him a chance and they were
dishonest so I gave him a bad review
The Adventurous strikes again
what's up my photos yeah man well guys
look it's kind of dying off so if if you
guys bring up topics I'm happy to keep
talking otherwise

I'm guessing that's your avatar I'm
guessing you don't really look like that
but uh maybe maybe you're what Pinoy
you're a Filipino or something
see the cheapest yeah absolutely
cigarettes are so expensive in Australia
it's we have packs of 30 and 25 we just
prefer bigger packs more smokes
but uh even a 20 pack of Marlboro Reds
meaning like for like because it's the
most common cigarettes in the world
a 20 pack of Marlboro Reds is like 30
dollars man 30 bucks
Man You're Gonna Be Rich this week
tobacco you got to be a drug dealer
you're gonna be a trouble vlogger you
know
yeah so like in the Philippines it's
like one dollar two dollars for a packet
yeah
yeah most of that's taxes by the way
it's got guys that's stupid
it's [ __ ] huh 30 bucks for a pack of
cigarettes
uh
and wouldn't hope when you go back to
Philippines say Edward you must be
Charming in a bit late so it's Stacy
um
yeah I was thinking about now thinking
about February but I'm I'm busy with
work and business I've got other working
business to take care of here and I'm
playing the long game I'm better off
taking care of my long-term life you
know my dealing with life you know
building up my life
uh everything goes to that and then I'll
have to say I can travel whenever I like
or maybe I could retire early
I know I'm gonna have to flesh it out
I'm gonna have to make a new Vlog series
and play Shout out but yeah because I do
a lot of Finance work
and uh keep an eye on the economy
U.S us and Australian economy so it's
something I do like as a job and I and I
also don't mind and enjoy it it's not
something people should be scared of you
guys should really be researching
the economy and things too but uh yeah
I'm keeping them very careful eyeing it
so there's some things going on I just
want to be around to keep an eye on it
yeah you know be responsible or just be
responsible do the right thing that's
why I want to make some videos if they
should add more for people who are
interested
uh so yeah so to answer your question
Edward uh maybe later in the year maybe
Christmas time will say maybe later but
I've got other things to worry about
priorities prioritize
and then I can uh do what I like later
it goes well
so Stacy yet okay thanks Stacy well
thanks for sharing so much I'm just
reading through all the different
comments Stacey Stevens
Michael Strong uh I told her she needs
to be careful and not trust anyone
now I just found out she's going to El
Nido I was like man she can get skin
she's only 22 first-time traveler money
yeah just tell her to watch my El Nido
videos I'm not kidding not just a
Shameless plug go there she can have a
great time in El Nida but it's not gonna
be what she thinks it's not going to be
the bull crap slow motion oh showing off
because that's everything looks better
in slow motion you see guys are putting
up beautiful videos
professional great videos I like I
respect how good they are but that is
showing off at El Nino is a fishing
Village and you get scammed there
so go there have a good time guys I'm
not saying it's
all bad just go there have a good time
but don't get I think it's gonna be
what some highlight reel that's called
entertainment that's called video
editing very good professional editing
because I'm not kidding guys my I'm I
actually have friends who have been
there friends in real life and they got
so upset
I was like what's wrong they go well we
went down we thought it'd be something
else
so they wasted their two weeks leave
they wasted their savings you know
Filipino friends deals are very
expensive
they got very upset because they felt
they wasted all their time money going
there and also foreign Travelers you
know Australians Americans they got very
upset I said why they said the same
thing they thought like it was a tourist
trap they just went there and wasted
their time and money so that's what I
mean by if you go there
knowing the truth at least you don't get
upset you go okay I have a couple of
days
drink cheap rum party on the beach uh
peace in the water that's what the
tourists do I'm you know do your stupid
thing in El Nino and then keep going to
uh Puerto Princesa or Quran you know
travel around go to Port Barton
so I'm not saying it's bad guys I'm
saying go there with a more realistic a
practical mindset because people get so
upset when they go down there and find
out and I don't raise them I don't make
fun of them I don't you know they're my
friends
I'm like well you know I'm sorry you had
a bad trip I hope you're okay and lesson
learned yeah
I try to be nice about it I'm not Rising
anyone I promise
because I know I know what it's like
because I went there and I I was tricked
I was tricked I felt uh let down
so I'll keep going sorry I went on a bit
of a
bit of a long long one there
is such a rip-off Jay scored here yeah
man look you can go there and have a
good time but just understand what it is
yeah and if you're good at negotiating
don't pay those bull crap tourist prices
because I'll try to charge you double or
triple
uh you know you can get cheap rum like
one dollar for a glass of rum you know
like that's why Backpackers go there
then
pay one dollar and pass out a glass of
ramen
stupid yeah uh
oh okay so Stacy the reason why we do
live streams is is so we don't have to
sit up professional video editing and
whatever can you imagine I've got to set
up my camera and the tripod and
oh it takes hours it takes
um for every minute of video you see is
an hour of work so when you see my 10
minute videos that's 10 hours of work
so instead of me setting up this and
then editing it and uploading blah blah
blah
very straightforward direct you can ask
me questions it's you know
it's much easier and practical and that
way we can communicate
so instead of waiting for me to edit
another video you can just ask me
questions right now
so yeah and also um
you know more content you can see me
live you know you know I'm not just uh
doing my usual vlogger thing on the
camera this is me you know
and all my business books and law books
knowledge and wisdom
yeah these are all business and law
books
um
Joseph is saying you're too young to
retire well I know that's what that's
why it's ridiculous but anyway look I'll
get it one step at a time because I went
I went like really retired just like do
something else I'll go to America and
open a
open a shooting range I'll go to
Philippines and open the shooting range
[Music]
that would be cool actually um people
would come and I could give you lessons
I could I could run
um
classes I could do um training workshops
and Clinics yeah that'd be cool
Edward hope that's my plan right right
now to retire earlier well Edward
um I gotta clarify it's like
is there's nothing wrong with having big
goals but you also got to understand
what stepping stones are right I could
retire there right now I'm not trying
it would be simple I'm being practical
it'd be simple
I'll retire with very little and it'll
be very simple life I'll be living on my
uh kalamundai and rice or malungai and
rice
you know like soup chicken soup and rice
and
I would eat out every now and then but
that would be a very simple life and I
would be happy with it
but if anything went wrong
you know
that'll be an issue you know what about
Vehicles what about transport whatever
so the whole point is they're Stepping
Stones
um so whatever you need to do brother I
think you need a folk this is my whole
theme too I'm really being this because
I went through this 2018 that's actually
what I was doing all of 2018 sorting out
my own life
uh because I could have traveled again
and I did it and just like now
I purposely chose all the trouble I'll
get a sort out my own life
uh yeah you've got to build up those
Stepping Stones man whatever that is
whatever that is you get good at your
job or find a job that you can like and
get good at
and it takes years that's what I did it
took it took me years man I've been
doing
uh I've been working
professionally for 13 years brother I
know I look young I've been working
professionally for 13 years and before
that you know part-time jobs working in
a retail School working in a restaurant
working in blah blah blah you know and
I've still done those jobs on the side
for extra cash
you see so there's no shortcuts so I'm
not I'm not playing
you know I mean like what I was saying
at the start of the chat 40 000 I had 40
000 in student debt that was my goal my
first goal pay that off
you know I still come from that older
generation you know when we went to UNI
and did [ __ ] degrees now it's a big
business I mean it now it's just a big
business so 40 000 was cheap I I checked
my study pathway because I did a lot of
study uh degrees Advanced diploma
master's degree
I have a master's degree right
and um I checked if I was to do that all
again it would cost 120 000 dollars
one hundred and twenty thousand dollars
in Australia I was like that is [ __ ]
can you imagine that that it that would
that would kill a young student to build
up that much debt at 21 22 23 you know
even if you get a bit older you study
slowly
man could you imagine you graduated
whatever 22 23 25 120
000 that [ __ ] up man excuse my
language because I didn't I didn't
realize because Joseph talked about it
because my time because I did it a long
time ago it was about forty thousand
dollars right so a bit more affordable
and I paid it off I paid for it myself
slowly you know slowly got a good job
and paid it off
man I didn't realize how expensive it is
now like a hundred thousand like that
wow yeah
uh
sorry I'm getting distracted but yeah
just to share where I'm at as well can
you see why why I share these things so
that's why I say Stepping Stones
my first one was paying it off
the student debt debt and then now on
debt free I have the ability to sort of
do what I want
and I have savings
right
yep so Joseph is saying live streaming
is good and fun way to chat with your
viewers yep exactly right and and meet
kind of you know meet some of you as
well I'm not sure
how many of you watch my videos or not
and I'm learning like we got this guy
from Norway he's really cool Dave from
Norway and we now have Stacy from the US
Stacy I'm pretty sure I've seen your
comments before but
um
you're a straight up guy that is why I
don't I like you no [ __ ] oh well
thank you Stacy aren't you sweet
well that's the whole point right why
why bullcrap
but uh Joseph is saying I like that
is what I wanted I thought that is what
I wanted I Miss America I wish I could
do six months each well you should
brother that's what I was saying uh we
call him English John because he didn't
want to be interviewed I really want to
interview him he had such good stories
and tips
oh yeah English John lives half in UK
and a half the Year in Philippines and
he's very successful he has a company
he's earning good money uh Construction
Company
yeah he he earns Top Dollar Man
well he owns British pounds uh yeah he's
earning good money and yeah he does what
he wants sometimes he has to go back he
has to go back to UK to watch the
company just to make sure the guys
aren't doing stupid [ __ ] want to keep
keep clients customers happy if they
have a big project
but because this project-based work
construction you know they finished this
school
they finish this office if they're
fixing the office you know and they
finish the work and the Project's
finished and then you can
you can take a break
uh and then come back to the next
project you know so I'm the same too I
do a lot of project-based work so I
finished my project that's how I that's
how I did the travel guys
um I took a pay card I did my projects
when they finish I go travel and then
come back and then try and find a new
project but employers don't like it they
really don't like that they don't like
that yet have freedom they try to
enslave you it's really a thing it's
still a thing they're trying to you know
like no we don't like how you go
somewhere and disappear
we don't like how you got qualifications
and you're independent and yeah they
don't like it but by the way hey they're
always waiting
employers always need staff and they're
always waiting so
it's a thing you know like I said I took
a pay cut there's no shortcuts
but uh you know worst case I'll go work
for a boring office job again and
pay the bills
I may have to I may have to but that may
get me to where the next stepping stone
to get where I want to be right that's
life it's like School you've got to
learn how to read and write do your high
school but treat it like jail okay I've
got to get out of jail you know your
goal is to get out of jail beat the
system you know learn how to read learn
how to write and then get out of there
and you know get on to something be
going better
okay so yeah I'm just I'm just you know
rambling on let's keep going
yeah after a couple of years you will
see yeah yeah Joseph exactly that's
better to play it out better to know and
just give it a try
whatever it is you're doing
uh Dave the end YOLO you only live once
oh that's [ __ ] I know what you're
saying but I don't I don't go for that
YOLO [ __ ] yo y'all right people make
fun of my accent YOLO you only live once
you're low it's acronym
yeah that's everyone I know has done
YOLO has had serious health problems
you don't die quickly I'm not kidding
you don't die quickly you know they eat
junk food they take drugs you know
ecstasy speed you know MF amphetamine
cocaine heroin like oh you're not you
die slowly it's a very slow process
you'd isolated to have health problems
back problems that they break their back
you're lowing
they have multiple health problems you
know
yeah everyone I know is I'm just being
serious responsible guys
so don't think it's you only live once
it's called a slow and painful death
I'm not kidding diabetes you name it
like a you know
they didn't last the white they didn't
they didn't have the YOLO fun experience
they thought they would they had fun for
one or two years and then they had
multiple health problems
that's how it really works yeah and they
end up suffering dying a slow painful
death so uh convenience of America
Joseph State convenience of America uh
a feeling of belonging somewhere many
reasons a big one being friends and
family and food yeah yeah exactly
exactly uh like don't get me wrong
Australia is a very lucky beautiful
country we're very clean and safe and
very high living standard but it does
get very expensive because of that
but don't get me wrong Australia is a
beautiful country
uh Stacy Stevens says too many Filipinos
here in SoCal oh you're in Southern
California yeah Circle I see them daily
well hey there's more the population of
California is bigger than the whole of
Australia we have 24 million people in
the whole of Australia I think you got
26 million people in SoCal or in
California
but hey I mean you got maybe Stacy you
don't like what some of these Filipinos
or it's a bit too much
they all work in healthcare yep nurses
they're exporting nurses yeah
so many nurses I mean that's why
that's where this came from I made these
Filipino nurse friends male and female
they migrated to Australia so we became
friends and they're like yeah go
see our country go visit Philippines and
and sometimes I would go with them or
visit them their family and uh that's
where the whole connection came from
yeah so
yeah a lot of nurses man
a lot of nurses Edward hope that's
understanding
the end same in Norway yep
a thing that's talking about lifestyle
like yeah it's you know you miss it you
miss the the
living standard you know it's nice to
have a Higher Living standard Healthcare
safe clean and all that but it's also
nice to have similar Ventures and a bit
of a vacation so I think that's more to
the point I'm still doing the vacation
exploring thing but because I haven't
really found a place so I could live
long term we'll see
maybe maybe I fall in love with a
beautiful girl in a village in Mindanao
and fight the rebels and become a
trouble leader you know
uh maybe you know maybe that that will
happen one day
Michael Strong Filipinos are like Honda
we're everywhere oh my that doesn't make
sense on those reliable
no events the Filipinas are always live
man I'm being serious I invited the
Filipino nurse friends male and female
to my house for dinner I wanted to cook
for them you know you see if you see my
cooking videos
so make Chinese and noodles and all this
stuff
and that turned out three hours late
I said guys dinner was 6 p.m I told you
Facebook text I called you I thought
they dissed me I thought they just
ditched me right they turn up at like on
9pm I was pissed off I was like falling
asleep and I was already getting the
keys to go out I was like you know what
they teach me I'm just going to go out
I'm going to go out and you know party
it was the weekend
and then finally they're turning up it's
are you kidding me Filipino time
you know we're not talking about Manila
traffic we're talking about Australia
you know they're just being
yeah like island island time
they they think they're in the islands
mucking around they don't take it
seriously and they and they make fun of
us they make fun of westerners they go
oh you're so anal westerners you
Americans you're so anal you're so anal
on time
you assies
you're so big on time you know like they
make fun of us man I think we're they
think we're crazy because we care about
uh punctuality
I mean yeah we get obsessed with work
work work time but
you know it goes both ways we could
chill out a bit too but they could turn
up on time that would be nice
this is not Manila traffic no this is
not my uh airport this is not Manila
airport
um
don't get me wrong I'll have Philippines
we're moving somewhere forever is a
bigger thing than people think yep but
it's best advice no big moves oh there's
more comments sorry I'm scrolling down
I've got to keep answering questions
no big decisions if you ever go to
Philippines whatever six months one year
take your time no big decisions none
don't go rushing buying a property or a
land or a lot though
check it out first because guys get in
they get scammed they get into trouble
you know are they get robbed get signed
for you oh there's a foreigner here
let's Rob him with a gun
and now you know you just sunk in all
your money buying a lot or buying an
apartment you know
uh Stacy Stevens uh okay thank you now I
understand you and others okay well I'm
glad I was rambling on thank you oh Bob
okay
you're the real deal all good thanks
much well thank you Stacy Stevens maybe
you should start blogging or making some
fun videos
guys it's not about showing off this is
what people don't understand if you like
baking or selling that to Corey like
Canadian friend if you like baking make
videos about baking like baking your
cakes like cool
you don't need to show off it's just
about sharing your thing so if you're
into baking you know or if you're in the
Lego or motorbikes
so whatever you're into yeah I mean
get into it um
just sell the market short put options
ah Stacy
very very clever you figure it out huh I
have a friend here who is Joseph is
saying he has a friend who is a pro
shooter yeah whatever man whatever that
means what Pro Airsoft shooter
pro pro I don't know pro basketball
shooter whatever man documented
you know it is you've got to document it
document it seeing is believing it
just sell the market sure that's a good
one Stacy yeah
that's a good one you know be very
interesting to have a real chat with you
yeah
maybe I'm not sure what you do Stacy but
you understand how it works here Michael
Strong people need to check out Bali for
retirement Philippines isn't the only
interesting yep uh Bali has always been
very popular for Australians
so flights to Indonesia are quite
expensive but to buy a league
specifically Bali there's like flights
every day very affordable
like a few hundred dollars like 300
sometimes on sale just to get people
going there
uh I went to Bali so Michael's saying I
went to Bali and fell in love with the
culture I highly recommend visiting Bali
in Indonesia yeah look that's why I
didn't go I thought it's just a tourist
trap you know it's very touristy I just
thought no not for me
um Indonesia out of Indonesia or wider
Indonesia is different from Bali Bali is
designed for tourism
so don't get me wrong they got what they
wanted they wanted a tourism so they
made a tourism Haven
but very different because my friend got
a motorbike he's Australian you rented a
motorbike and went all around the
country
you don't stay in this village stay here
stay here you know and then you went to
Bali and he said man totally different
from Bali
so don't get me wrong I'm not I'm not
raising it
um he said it was beautiful he liked it
but he said totally different you know
people are more reserved Muslim country
you have to learn the culture you've got
to be respectful but in Bali whoa party
very loud you know very loud people
showing off in bikinis and [ __ ] like
that Muslim country man you know they
hate they hate it I'm saying the locals
hate it they don't like our
westerners are going there getting wild
you know getting loose but they want the
tourism so it's business you know it's
like finally
Bali in Indonesia are different things
but yeah you're right I should I should
just take a quick vacay why not go party
uh Bali is English-speaking yeah mostly
because I know they want the tourism
uh Joseph was asking Stacy Stevens
housing market falling here and they're
also in Australia yeah
we've been grossly uh over inflated our
housing market in Australia is grossly
over inflated
so much so even the international
monetary fund and other regulating or
other monitoring groups not regulators
uh I've said you guys are insanely over
inflated now of course what's the
reality check Australians get butt hurt
right I don't want to hear that so they
just keep
over inflating it and now it's dropping
significantly so in the last year
they've dropped about 10 I think about
10
um I I've got to keep checking because
it keeps changing I think it's 14 now
and um
the major cities uh like economists and
analysts so this is again something I'm
bursting the economic analysts and the
economists and financial analysts are
saying man in Sydney and Melbourne
they're so frothy like 1 million or 2
million for a one bedroom apartment like
like like this like a small one-bedroom
apartment
one million two million you can't afford
it never in your lifetime and it's not
nice whether it's a run down apartment
with rats and [ __ ] and crack pipes you
know
uh you can't afford that in your
lifetime
so of course it has to be adjusted it
has to come down because it's too frothy
it's way too expensive the average
person on 50 Grand salary that's average
salary in Australia average income this
is the same income
the average person earns 50 Grand a year
they can't afford a million dollar
apartment that's [ __ ] it's not even
a nice penthouse
it's a it's a crack house it's a rundown
yucky
one bedroom Studio one bedroom apartment
so yeah I mean you can't you can't live
you can't even have a roof
so yeah they said they set the four
maybe 30 to 40 depending on how the
economics play
uh it's sort of with interest rates and
bonds and I don't want to get too
carried away like I said I should
probably make a separate video about
that but um yeah depending on how the
market plays it they've got they have to
drop at least 20 maybe maybe 40.
it just depends on how the economics
play out
different economic uh situations
scenarios
but yeah so like I said if you're
earning it's probably the same in
America if your average income is 45 50
Grand salary a year or income some type
of income
and you can't afford it you can't afford
the repayments and you've got to buy
groceries food electricity water taxes
you know you can't even afford to leave
brother you know
anyway I'm getting distracted
um
I from Canada sorry Frank bopper hey
Frank bopper or Bopper Frank hey good to
hear from you brother um yeah this is it
I like it when you guys tell me where
you're from
chime in
J scordio it's all about sacrifice a
little now in order to look up the
letter yeah brother
exactly right Jane it's what I've been
renting about this whole time thank you
oh you said it very well
so I'm trying to find the comment again
I just lost it
yeah exactly right man I mean
to give you an idea um
when I was 20 I'll tell you guys an
awesome story when I was 20.
23. I saved up I'd saved up some money
right I saved up a bit of money uh
because I you know I gotten a job at 21
you know 2021 my first office job and I
got a pay rise growing awesome good on
me I was only on 50 Grand a year I was
only on 40 45 Grand a year you see I'm
being honest
I was only on 45 Grand a year but I'm
like yeah awesome I'm finally earning
full-time money I'm not a student you
know
and I was like I really want to get a
Mercedes just a C-Class uh what was it
now what was it a c220d like a diesel
was it I think that's the name anyway it
was like it was a 220d the diesel turbo
diesel and uh you know it was a good
looking car C-Class with the twin
headlights
uh you know really good looking car you
know early 2000s so that's made me 2006
in a model uh oh 2003 you know because
at the time anyway
I found one for 40 Grand and I was like
yeah I want to get this car I want to
show off because I'm young right at the
time I'm you know in my 20s ladies
getting in my Mercedes you know you want
to show off the girls I'm being honest
and I went no
you know what no I'm gonna get I'm gonna
have I had a Honda Civic I'm gonna stick
with my Honda Civic
I think people are razzing me
why don't you get a BMW or something and
I had a company car I had a company BMW
by the way they lent it to me it wasn't
mine it was the directors but as a
rewarder you know if you did well he
goes hey take the company card just you
know don't waste your money you work for
the company so I'm driving around in a
BMW 3 Series still a nice car 353 you
know it's still nice
and um
so he's like hey don't hey don't worry
if people arrested you get in the
company BMW go show off he's like he's a
really cool director
he's a really cool guy and and he and he
sold the company and that's why you know
we'll have to move on otherwise I
probably still be working for him to
this day it was a really cool man Simon
you know let's give him a shout out this
uh director Simon and um
anyway like you shouldn't have sold the
company he should have kept it he just
he just cashed out by the time he turned
40. he just was like ah I'm retiring
early you know silly you should have
kept his legacy going
but anyway the whole point was yeah I
made that decision already in my early
20s I don't want to just
waste money on a car to show off you
know so yeah it sucks now so I'm better
taken care of later
generally
so remember Outlet Mercedes-Benz was
like forty thousand dollars
well instead of putting forty thousand
dollars in that mercedes-bands I'll put
it into my education and paid off my
student debt you see what I mean
but it's not really correct to say it
because I kept studying even even at a
time I was still studying I was doing
like postgraduate certificates diplomas
Masters my Master's Degree any
I've been studying for a long time
professionally
it's a thing when you become a
professional like you have to keep up to
date and you have to keep retraining
it's just it's
the pathway it's uh what they call it
learning experience the journey and I
and then usually you know as you can
tell it used to be now it's just money
it's just schools trying to make more
money for me so anyway um
yeah I'll stop battling on it was just
yeah absolutely all right Jay it's about
sacrifice I made those sacrifices early
so I wasn't suffering later
at all
I'm living well I'm living well later
that's why we're Oakley no I mean I'm
being materialistic it's like yeah
that's why I got this awesome watch
now what's true actually yeah because I
paid off my dates so that's why I get
down with some stuff
anyway
see I'm being materialistic but yeah
look I meant what I said so I chose
between investing in myself I know it
sounds very cliche
or a stupid car you know don't get me
wrong it was a nice Mercedes luxury car
but you see what I mean at that point in
life I was like no I better invest in
myself
and then take care of my future and uh
you know people are ask me man people
are asking me you made fun of me but hey
it worked out at least for me I'm just
saying it worked out for me
it sucked then but um
I'm not struggling now at least I'm
certainly grateful
okay Michael Strong in this dense
hassar people can speak English in their
arm
that's all right he's saying in Bali
yeah yeah okay
yeah cool man look you guys are making a
good point Bali is so affordable from
Australia
uh yeah I might I might get one of the
South lights I'll look at a sale and
just jump on a flight I know guys that
go on a weekend I know it sounds crazy
they just go for like three four days a
long weekend and just go party or even
just relax just relax yeah
uh and I have other friends who go to
Bali but the outer body not in town
they go to like a villa or a beach house
you know they rent a villa and just
chill out you know in their own little
sort of private pillow or beaches yeah
or Resort
you know a bit less hectic a bit less uh
bit less loud
crazy
uh Joseph haha who retires in Canada
what what are you Joseph's resin some
guy who's retiring again or whatever
um
Edward hope my very most important thing
I'm focused on now is saving money just
to be comfortable yep absolutely Edward
absolutely brother
I mean don't be too don't be too cheap
and I mean that respectfully you know
what I mean you got to find a balance if
you need to get bills paid if you want
to live well
like Live Well you know
um but yeah you just don't live beyond
your means
yeah you just don't overstretch because
like I said I said this at the start of
the video you know even if you put a
hundred dollars in a savings account
two percent savings uh two percent
savings interest rate is better than
losing it all
and it's better than losing you know so
okay Stacy Stevens my physician pays 4
000 a month in student debt
she owes 150k and you must pay it back
can cannot go bankrupt yep
yeah
in Australia the ATO manages it the
Australian tax office they manage
student debt we call it higher education
loan program
it's an acronym help a higher education
loan program
so in Australia it's technically a tax
day
technically it attached it to the
federal government so you better pay you
don't pay it back they can Crush you
they can take away your passport they
can Crush you they don't want to
they're like just pay it back slowly you
know just whatever you can afford
paybacks love you there's also a table
uh there's a threshold table of income a
click level so depending on your income
you have to compulsory payback a little
bit like one percent of your income
uh a year so I think it's 50 Grand if
you earn 50 000 income
you have to pay one percent of your
income to pay back your student debt
so most people just do it that way
compulsory
uh repayments through their taxes
uh but yeah that's so again you know me
just being me
I didn't realize how much I saved
because I paid off my student debt so
quickly so early it saved me all the
interest fees and charges
because that's where they get you on a
loan any loan credit card debt it's the
interest fees and charges so because you
know badass be advantages I'm paying off
my stream that quick
they don't get to charge me all those
interests and fees you know so I
probably saved myself about 40 000 in
interest and things
yeah badass friend yeah winning long
game yeah yeah so you say there's a
reason why you you played out
that's there's a reason why you played
the long game you know you win long term
anyway so
let's keep going like I said look but
guys like I said I didn't Joseph uh was
the one who woke me up Joseph in Manila
because he was talking about his son
going to school
uh EJ where I didn't realize how
expensive school is now going to
University College is so expensive now
it's it's grossly inflated and uh and it
shouldn't be because we have the
internet the internet should be making
it cheaper
online universities and you can do the
study online and Technology it should be
cheaper it shouldn't be so expensive
anyway let's keep going
uh the end uh Dave I'm free can have a
meet up in Australia yeah yeah I really
should
um people have said
people have said they've seen me in
Australia and they knew it was me they
heard me speak and they saw me with the
camera they went okay it's the adventure
but it didn't come up they're very shy
so um I told them later I was like
because they're messaging me I was like
hey come up just come up and say hello
like just to be friendly but yeah they
saw me with the camera and I heard me
speaking oh team you know but same in
Philippines people have messaged me
Americans and Filipinos like I knew it
was you you were vlogging in the airport
and we you know they saw me with the
camera like yeah they're too shy
sometimes they try to
meet up but yeah I should do a meet up
yeah in Australia and Philippines and
Bali
wherever
uh
let's keep going
having a baby makes that really hard to
do yeah having a baby yeah well that's
what I haven't had a baby that I know of
you know so
uh yeah well you know it's also a
mindset it's mentality brother
it's mentality like I said I've got
friends who have
for some reason they always have 200 a
week for alcohol and cigarettes
because remember cigarettes are very
expensive they always got 200 a week
Ryan hell or Sean for cigarettes and
alcohol
plus they have another hundred dollars
for crystal meth they're marijuana
yeah because they like drugs
so they always spend 300 bucks a week
partying
they find the money somehow
you know how are they doing it probably
illegitimate but still hey they
they got through no no that's not true
actually that's not true they have
full-time jobs
they they do have full-time jobs that's
how they can afford
to burn so much money so
one of them I told him off he was on 80
000 a year and he got promoted 90 000 a
year a truck driver
joke off man he's on 90 000 a year
doesn't have a cent in his pocket just
gambling drugs alcohol cigarettes
prostitutes
a dying brother if you can spend that
much money a year you know like 500 a
week partying
put into a savings account go traveling
you're traveling around the world
all
right off your house you can if you can
afford to spend that much money you know
free income
put her on your house pay off your
mortgage jerk off man total jerk off and
he he defaulted on his mortgage he
defaulted he didn't pay off the house
that's what people are talking about
oh it's too expensive it's too much you
just defaulted lost the house idiot
uh anyway so we'll keep going enough
because I tried to help him I'm not
being too harsh I really did try to help
him we tried interventions and stuff
like that like drug interventions
gambling interventions you know he's a
father his brother we all tried to help
you
no so gambling junkie drug addict you
know
he got you got what he wanted that's
what he wanted
anyway uh the end I'm uh whatever Marco
strong things in Bali are super cheap
too jukada has majority Muslim very nice
people also has Catholic Catholics and
Christians
and Bali is in Hinduism oh
really I'm gonna look into that well I
like okay all right nice people in
Indonesia
okay I'm gonna look into that
yeah yeah okay
um
look I've met Indonesians here I've
worked with Indonesians I've had
Indonesian friends international
students yeah it's cool I've got no
problem with that I like the food I like
Indonesian food
I've been to Malaysia it's very similar
you see Malaysia and Indonesia are very
similar similar culture you know they
they
exchange you know they jump to each
other's countries
yeah you know they mix you know same
tribe you so to speak
similar Southeast Southeast Asian tribes
and same with the Filipinos they're also
a similar tribes
yeah okay uh Joseph got a run to have a
good one guys yeah hey thanks for
joining us Joseph in Manila
uh
alrighty yeah thanks Jonas Bro Stacy
Stevens congrats Miss Universe Miss gray
Filipino mum Aussie father
maganda
yeah
yep she's awesome I think it's Katrina
petroina Katrina gray yeah good honor
she's from Queensland Cairns Queensland
she she I used it man she smashed it she
crushed it meaning she was confident
well spoken educated
she really should have won
excuse me
excuse me last juice
gonna drive through it she really
deserved to win she she had it all you
know beautiful she got the catwalk the
costumes you know all that
the evening gowns you know the whole
thing but at least she was well spoken
intelligent
yeah you know she brought up with the
AIDS issue Aids HIV she's a
IDs HIV Advocate you know awareness and
protection
very you know responsible we don't know
that's that's the whole point of these
beauty pageants guys
the Filipinos love them they love these
beauty pageants yeah they start from
Young it's a national sport
the whole idea is to get attention on
some important issues that's why they do
it for charity well they're supposed to
do it for charity you know
gosh
sorry guys I go to bed something
happened
maybe I'm vaping too much
um
yeah that's that's what it's all about
the whole point is yeah it sounds very
superficial and shallow Oh look at these
beauty queens you know some girls get
upset
it's like no you don't need to get upset
and jealous or guys
yeah it's about these beauty queens but
they get attention onto charity and
important issues so
if if everyone did the wrong thing we
wouldn't need these beauty pageants but
people don't do the right thing so we
kind of do need a beauty pageant every
now and then yeah
that's fun it's fun it's entertaining
that's the whole point but yeah good on
uh Miss Universe and she's you know
Filipino Australia
so we both won
Philippines and Australia both won so
good on her Miss Gray
did Miss gray if you ever see it keep it
up I love how you confident and educated
and uh very responsible keep it up
responsibility that's what it's about
uh oh Michael Strong you gotta go take
care yes oh no
yeah Stacy Stevens yes Stacy Stevens 33
mil
too much drama
oh I think you're talking about the
population because I was blabbing on
population of Southern California 33
million people yeah
Michael Strong what's too much drama
Stacy I've been with many of them they
work work in old retirement homes all
over all the
her local Filipino community in Southern
California yeah okay
that's annoyingly true man I've been
okay
Stacy saying the video you made long ago
about the Aussie Pinay who was trying to
get you to go with her was great
oh
okay
um I'll hook up
oh look I'm gonna we call it guys uh you
know what I'm gonna I'm gonna find it
let me just
keep asking questions I'm just gonna
wanna the reason why whenever we get a
reference like that
I'll just share the link to keep it
convenient
because people are like what are they
talking about
yeah El hookah that was the that was a
true story I wasn't bullcrapping like I
know people razzed on me and hated me
that was a true story because I was
Green
oh it's so green like um you know it was
my first trip to Philippines very first
I never experienced it
anything like it I never experienced the
country before I've been the Malaysia
Singapore Thailand Vietnam Vietnam
you know Europe Israel I've been out
everywhere and then I'll go to
Philippines it was just it was culture
shock it really flipped me up
it just it screwed me up but that's why
I keep going back because it's like what
else is there like maybe there's other
cool things to you know
um
yeah it's a story time it's a Story Time
video when I was telling a story yeah
I'm guessing you're I'm guessing you're
more mature um
Stacy Stevens
uh no I'm still going through sorry guys
I've got to catch up thank you for all
the comments guys I've got to catch up
now
uh The Big Short yeah that's a great
movie uh thank you for sharing Stacy
Stevens guys if you ever want to learn
about a bit about the economy watch The
Big Short
The Big Short it's a great movie and
also uh Margin Call
yep so thank you for sharing that yep
the big could be straight people don't
know about those movies they're such
good movies and obviously based on true
stories
um
The Big Short
Margin Call imagine cool yep
you gotta understand that they just
dramaticized as movies but it just helps
maybe the average person understand
what's happening you know
so anyway not to scare anyone it's just
you shouldn't be scared of it learn
learn just like
you know a silly computer part Ram this
is RAM for a computer
learn what it is and put Ram in your
computer and call it good you don't need
to be an expert just get it done you
know
um
so Michael Strong the main tour of the
spot in Bali is then then's pasta yeah
but once you go out of it you see the
countryside it's uh absolutely gorgeous
yeah that's what my friends are telling
me they go to the countryside yeah
scuba diving too I've got a place a trip
to Australia to check out the jbr okay
oh Great Barrier Reef yeah yeah Michael
you sound like you've got a lot of
experience uh traveling already so
that's cool man respect
yeah yeah so now look thanks for sharing
Bali because yeah maybe
why not I'll take a trip there
I should have because people um people
go there all the time
from Australia
Stacy Stevens here it is three thousand
for an apartment one room in a new place
right
it's all about like repayments or rent I
think which means
okay so Michael Strong yeah in West
Hollywood an apartment is a freaking
rip-off
that's where my office is at okay I'll
see what you mean at Santa Monica
Boulevard and La canciation
Sienna
um
and dtl oh downtown LA is a [ __ ]
okay Michael yep no look I've heard that
I'm not in such a language but I've
heard yeah it's just concrete run down
not so nice so yeah I'm not Rising on
you guys I like the feedback I like how
you're sharing that's the whole point
Stacy Stevens if a woman only wants you
for a car she's not worth it yeah
yep she'll ditch your ass in a heartbeat
I mean yeah she won she might fall for
it initially that's what the guys don't
understand and thank you for saying that
Stacy I'm still catching you in comments
guys you're not fooling anyone yeah you
got your fat whip you got a nice car
you're nice watch you're not fooling
anyone
right she's gonna leave your ass in a
heartbeat she's just going to try and
snatch what she can so because your
impression was showing off
when she works at that's not real then
where she's gonna go
or uh you're gonna have to keep up with
that and then you're gonna have to keep
doing stupid things and then you're
gonna make a fool of yourself right
you're just going to keep burning money
for the most ridiculous reasons so it's
normal when you're young see that's why
I shoot that story when I was younger in
my early 20s what do you want to do you
want to show off you want to show off
your first goals but uh
fast forward uh
there's better ways to do it man there's
better ways to build a relationship
dates and meet people
and I I'm being serious I've dated girls
like that and it was terrible it didn't
last long and they were just terrible uh
it didn't matter how pretty they were it
was this fake
so fake me Michelle like we just quiet
and it's not nice so that's why I'm
single yeah
um
all right let's keep going
um
Michael Strong I'm jealous to go to Bali
just for this weekend how amazing is
that for Australia yeah because of our
geography we're close to we are
australasia we're part of Southeast Asia
a lot of Australians just don't realize
it's a 23 hour Journey from California
yeah long long flight from California
yeah done it twice well you've done it
twice
oh man cool Michael
Stacy Crush
perfect you said it
she owned the runway yeah
yeah she's slated you were talking about
um Miss Universe
you know it's like oh she's slated you
go girl
oh she crushed it
anyway yeah but she did what she did
uh all right I'm still catching up El
hookah was a classic yep Jay
yeah
um I'm not kidding I I was very
embarrassed but I was getting over it
too
I showed that video
to a couple of her friends I didn't do
it to be me because they asked me why
aren't you friends with her anymore they
knew they need can you see the problem
when we're too nice it's too much
[ __ ] I'm being serious right
oh we don't want to say anything we want
it to be nice and you know we didn't
want to upset you you know blah blah
blah I said no I said real friends tell
the truth
yeah
if you were real friends you would have
told me what she was like and that this
was a scam and things were happening you
you intentionally let me
go with this person knowing that there
were a scammer
and dishonest and disgusting
so anyway I showed him the video and um
they laughed they laughed they were like
yeah they said it's all true I was like
ah
so now now you admit it right so because
I was like oh we didn't want to say
anything oh what are you talking about
they said yeah
they said yeah that's like you know it's
a it's a cover-up it's a Act
yeah so
anyway silly so they're not they're not
friends with her anymore just to make
the point
you know they used to be her crowd her
friends her girlfriends and they're not
friends with her anymore
because they know like she's you know
she's doing these naughty dirty
disgusting things it's like hey
sweetheart
if you want to be a working girl go work
but don't don't bring don't bring that
[ __ ] to us you know or keep quiet
don't
don't make it so obvious you know anyway
um yeah let's keep going
uh
uh yeah the Big Sean Might Recall yeah
The Wolf of Wall Street yeah The Wolf of
Wall Street uh the end yeah that's a
good movie too that's more entertainment
uh great entertainment Leonardo DiCaprio
is a great
great uh actor a great movie but just it
didn't really cover so much the
what's happening what's happening with
the economy
been to New York oh Focus Warrior hey
welcome Focus Warrior um no I haven't
been to New York yet
I would love to
New Amsterdam
so the story I heard is the Dutch
founded New York they called it New
Amsterdam
then the British came and took it over
and called it New York because the
British like to say York
and the Europeans like the same
Amsterdam you know so anyways uh um yeah
anyway
interesting story so now I I have not
been yet I would love to one day
hopefully
Stacy's saying downtown LA is tent city
after the dark said oh I see
a lot of uh what homelessness drug
addicts squatting yeah
Focus Warrior can you say hi to Kai
Molina and Shani Rose my kids yeah hey
uh Kai and Shani it's a kai kai Molina
and Shani Rose
I'm not like I'm not sure if that's
their full name or four names but yeah
hey of course Focus Warrior yep
not a problem 2B how's that housing in
Australia I heard of the news about
Sydney you might turn into slums yeah um
they're obviously exaggerating obviously
sensationalizing but there is great
truth to it now the problem is you got
the economic factor and you got the
human factor right the human factor
being the deciding World Cup
the economic factor is our interest
rates are too low
and uh because of those languages rates
people over overboard so their current
uh Reserve Bank right that's all that's
our Federal Reserve our Reserve Bank of
Australia has the cash rate at 1.5
percent
the problem is the banks are greedy
they're not listening to them and the
banks are charging like four percent
and they're slowly getting higher you
know 3.7 3.8 3.9 percent four percent
but you know they're slowly increasing
interest rates on mortgages and loans
so that's already happening can you see
the problem so the Market's already
getting squeezed
um
so again like I said that's that's more
there I'm just sharing the economic and
the facts the finance
well what about the human factor
well people want to get rich quick so
they buy these stupid half a million
dollar one million dollar properties and
they're not worth that
now that prices are falling they're
getting stuck
oh how do I pay back this property you
see
and then what do they do they either
have to try and renegotiate hopefully
they can
or maybe they renege they default I know
people that have defaulted like real
people in person they defaulted
you know so what do you do right
it's not it's it's being sensationalized
in the media yes that's the media's job
but they are reporting the truth that uh
we are we are heading for some very very
um
wild territory we're going to be on a
wild roller coaster ride if you want to
say it nicely
or you could say we're heading for um a
very big mess
we're heading for a very very big mess
again so that's part of why I haven't
traveled that's a big part of why I
haven't traveled yet I'm I'm just
keeping an eye on things
um
but yeah like it was what I was saying
earlier to be I'm just responding to
2b's question
I mean you know the average person on 50
000 salary a year
cannot afford a one million dollar
apartment and we're talking about a one
bedroom [ __ ] apartment it's not like
nice
I've seen some my friend bought one
I said why did you buy it she said well
it's in the city it's close to my work
but I said sweetheart you can't afford
it
she's on 50 000 a year
uh salary you know her income
one million dollar apartment crazy
those before those before prices started
calling down so silly as well she's
stuck in that boat
she paid 1.1 million before the prices
came in now it's probably eight hundred
thousand seven hundred thousand like
that and falling
more so I mean use your practical common
sense
your average person can afford a
property for maybe 300 000. tops tops
350 400 000 tops
so you see what I mean it's just not
practical you'll never pay back in your
lifetime you don't have enough time to
pay back
because you've got interest fees and
charges when you borrow 300 000 on a
mortgage you pay back double you pay
back six hundred thousand
right because I got to make some money
the bank wants to double their money
it's a very basic math
so if you borrow 100 000 you pay back
200 000.
if you borrow 300 000 you pay back 600
000.
so if you borrow one million remember
that [ __ ] one million
okay you borrow [ __ ] one million
you've got to pay back 2 million
see it's not fair you'll never pay back
in your life so it's impossible it's not
it's not possible to have such high
property prices
uh and we're a smaller country we've got
a population of 24 million see I'm
getting carried about I'm becoming an
economist now I'm getting into the
economist mode so yeah just for people
who don't understand what I'm talking
about
uh yes how do you pay back 2 million
in your lifetime you'll never pay it
back
you never pay back you know so
anyway
uh so let's keep going Michael Strong
that's not overnight though that's
estimated to be 20 years yes it thank
you Michael I'm
uh yeah
over the coming years yes
it's a and it's a very wide estimate yep
so I think realistically they're gonna
drop
uh at least another 20 at least
because because again in practicality no
one can afford it
and then they're probably going to drop
another 20 too depending on how the The
Wider economy behaves
meaning an economy is many things
uh
just to give you an idea you have gross
domestic product like what people earn
what people contribute productivity
taxes
you know equities bonds fixed interest
property there's so many different
factors gold silver
there's so many things and that's the
problem a lot of people don't want to
spend the time to study each piece of
the puzzle
so if you want to understand economics
you must study each piece of the puzzle
no one wants to spend the time I spend
the time see the difference so everyone
wants to answer like give me the magic
answer it's like brother or sister
like buddy study it full time study each
piece of the puzzle full time then
you'll understand
you're not going to do that then you're
not going to understand right there's no
short answer
but yeah so depending on the economic
factors I think they'll drop 40 long
term long term they'll drop 40 uh
yeah
anyway the property prices just because
no one can afford it as I said no one
can afford a million dollar one bedroom
or Studio
uh anyway so yeah keep us keep asking
questions guys
keep asking questions uh well gosh we're

I kid you not I love tinola because it's
a very Filipino thing uh tinola manok is
chicken soup but there's different types
you can put mung bean they call it bong
bong there's a different name you can
put mung bean or barley but it's
basically chicken soup
you trouble up the chicken pieces boil
it up very tasty all the flavor comes
out of the bones and me and then I put
in malunggay leaves which is moringa
Moringa lakes or moringa tree or
kalamungai
it's highly nutritious I'm not kidding I
like it because it's a very unique
Philippine I think
you know other cultures have lechon
roast pig or roast chicken
whatever but yeah that I could you not I
could I could eat that every day I did I
did try and eat it every day not every

survival skill
it's a Survivor School you've got to
learn how to cook guys you've got to
learn how to cook
[Music]
even if it's uh what do you call it
ramen noodles two we call it two minute
noodles here because it takes two
minutes to cook them two minute noodles
ramen noodles hey make a start
gotta start somewhere
uh okay
Michael Strong 2B that's gonna be a hard
question
but do you know how to cook it yeah I
mean I I know roughly because I know how
to make chicken soup but I just throw in
the malungi leaves if you want to do it
like that but I'd be happy to learn
don't get me wrong I'm happy to learn
from my local or I've seen other liquor
stores they put in okra
or you know cabbage or spinach yeah you
can put other vegetables in there so
it's a delicious tasty soup
uh Jay Jay from Perth hey that's cool
hey
excuse me jail I think I've seen your
comments before yeah hey that's cool man
Jay's from Perth Western Australia you
guys got the mining boom you got some
mineral boom going on over there
Adam Ramirez El Nido Quran tips in
motorbike rental from Los Angeles
um
okay I I have made some motorbike uh
rental tips but yeah okay
um
I guess I could share that
but specific I mean they're the same
tips they apply anywhere like negotiate
brother you got to negotiate fuel when
it comes to the motorbikes how much does
the bike cost to rent
for how long and how much is the fuel or
do you pay for the fuel you have to work
out all those details I know it's so
annoying but you have to you have to ask
they won't tell you so you'll bring it
back and you'll play all this extra crap
well I'll say or you always feel that
scratch you know maybe they try to scam
you things like that you know so you got
to be tough you're going to be tough and
say no that scratch was already there or
inspected first inspected make sure it's
working make sure it's not scratched
or if it is identify look it's already
scratches on me you know
but yeah typically you pay a rental fee
and then uh for fuel
so I'll give you a good example
um we had scooters in sabang
that's that's a good example
uh we had scooters
uh
and we've got motorbikes
[Music]
um
it's all good I actually have um a video
of motorbikes just I walked past the
place so coron motorbikes
it's not a writing video it's just me
talking about I'm trying some motorbikes
for rent
so uh that's that's for you brother
and um
and I'll share the one where I was I was
actually negotiating the price of a
scooter rental in Savannah it's called
what's your standard
but I'll I'll specifically put the topic
uh scooter into
it
it's the bank Beach Porto Calera but the
principles are the same
yeah so there you go that should uh
hopefully address your question
um
so this is cool so we're learning so
much about everyone now uh Dave the end
is from Norway 39 Mal hey cool you're
not that old but you said like you made
it sound like you retired like military
pension but I see you left the military
and now you're civilian life but cool
awesome you should change your account
name to Dave Dave end or something or
Dave from Norway or something like that
that's cool
uh Michael Strong one thing I learned is
that you don't win a woman's heart win
their stomach
well they say that about men too they
say you should win a man's stomach yeah
to learn to cook yeah yeah no well I
mean yeah women are impressed by that
um they get insecure though oh if you're
cooking clean then then maybe you don't
need a girlfriend you know like you know
like Filipinos like oh then maybe you
won't know me it's like no I'll still
marry you but just we can both quick and
clean
survive
and uh yeah you know it's just funny
it's just funny how some people react uh
you know Western girls often get
impressed
you know like Australian girls would be
like oh well you know or whatever
that's a great way to impress them but
yeah survival skills guys it's not it's
not just to impress a girl on a date you
need to survive I know guys who can't
even make ramen noodles would God see
so yeah you won't survive if you get
into trouble or if um you know you're
doing it tough it happens everyone goes
through a tough time at some point in
their life whether economically or
emotionally or whatever
you know I've already got friends who
divorced you know they married young
and I say this respectfully they're
married in their 20s you know here in
Australia
many different cultures Asian middle
eastern uh you know Australian New
Zealander
European
man they're all divorced you know
I'm not I'm not razzing them I'm not
making fun because I respect marriage
I'll take it seriously maybe that's why
I haven't married yet because I take it
too seriously
but they all married for fun Facebook
Instagram [ __ ] shut up and they're
already divorced
hello
and you know and I I like I would like
to treat it more seriously than that
like you know more responsibly
so what do you think happened even in
their marriages they remember they
married young they were struggling they
did better cook they didn't add a clean
they were struggling and they're
fighting all the time
yes I think not just cooking I'm just
saying
they didn't really know each other they
didn't marry for the right reasons they
they didn't talk about it was this oh
let's get a photo for Instagram and
Facebook and now let's break up
anyway anyway I'm getting loose so let's
keep going
no well actually I'm not getting loose
that's true
all right this stuff is happening uh
but anyway yeah you don't win a woman's
heart you win a stomach no I think it's
the other way around I think you win a
man's stomach and uh you don't win a
woman's heart you win
um
you win her what shoe collection you win
her shoe addiction you have to buy him
shoes for them
uh
Peter Poulter do you still keep contact
with assist Style no not I haven't
spoken to him in a while man I'm
enjoying your live chat hey thanks Peter
uh yeah I was coming out earlier you can
I believe his Facebook page there's
still Facebook is still open so I
encourage you guys don't don't be shy
try and message him what's gonna happen
he says no or he doesn't reply so if you
want to know just message him directly
don't you know you don't need to be
embarrassed but no I haven't kept in
touch with him
um
guys you know what I like to like
respect people's confidence so if people
tell me things in private I try to keep
private you know I want to keep that
trust and confidence and integrity
but all I can say Peter is he said it
publicly on his channel that he had
broken up with his wife and he was still
enjoying the party lifestyle
and uh if you don't know what that means
it means you need to buy extra condoms
right so
he made his choice he broke up with his
wife to go party and boom boom boom and
do whatever
that's on him right so I'm not Rising
that's on him he's got to own that
he's a grown-ass man he's got to own
that and then uh later he took down
those videos he also had some party
videos you know dancing and with his new
girlfriends
whatever so no I don't keep in touch
with him
like uh and there was a lot of you know
controversy and gossip on the internet I
didn't care for it I don't want to get
involved in that bullcrap you know like
uh you know sort of like best wishes
sort of thing yeah and you're more
important Peter tell us more about
yourself
Adam Ramirez oh hey roads are dangerous
in Palawan to motorbike first timer
yeah like yeah yeah
because some some of them are nice
asphalt some are concrete some are rocks
some are dirt so just like anything yeah
you got to go slow brother
um
I mean obviously we saw people doing it
but yeah really in Poland we took vans
most people take bands because they're
regular you know you jump on a van
everyone pays for a seat that way it's
more affordable and then you drive
Brew or you take boats you know ferry
boats always take the fast boat whenever
possible pay the extra money get the
fuzz but if you take the slow bait you
can drown a sink and they're just so
densely
um it's because they overload them
too much people too much cargo and then
uh yeah so and of course you have
airplanes I don't know why people
complain I guess they're being cheap but
you have airplane
if an airplane can transport you safely
and quickly
hey great vacation you know I know it's
not very one by name
why not and also fast fast jet uh fast
jet or what excuse me fast Ferry
you can understand when I went to Quran
from Quran to El Nida there was no fast
boat at that time
and I'm sure they saw my Vlogs and saw
me complaining and [ __ ] and did
something and uh now they have a fast
ship you know like a steel ship
uh fast ship yeah well worth it I think
it's like
eight hours slow bug or two hours or
three hours last year I can't remember I
made a video about it
But to answer your question uh your
roads are always dangerous in
Philippines brother
they're always I use you've got to be
careful that extra big cable go slow if
you don't feel confident like going up a
mountain whatever don't do it like just
don't do it uh if people fall off you
know people fall off mountains and
things and get an accident
Michael's strong again
um
just remember Adam it's always hot in
Philippines so you're going to go you're
going to be under the sun
yep you get burnt man that's why people
wear their jackets back the front one
has a windshield but because you just
get burnt your chest your neck your arms
your face you just get birth
yeah you gotta wear a hat wear a cover
and of course um don't be shy
you know whatever hat you want to wear
but yeah absolutely you'll get burnt
like crazy
yep I was driving you know ATVs and
quads you know I just prefer that a bit
easier and yeah my arms my neck my face
was all but yeah I mean I didn't mind it
was fun it was cool but even with the
sunglasses the handkerchief for the Dust
and bugs you know all this dust and bugs
in your face
and the helmet is still you know my neck
and arms are all burnt
but it was fine don't get me wrong it's
cool fun
okay
right
yep you're welcome Adam Ramirez to be
important Princesa Palawan most roads
are in terrible State yeah it's it's
weird because um that is all
because uh yeah they used to be like
okay but you know the tourism grew and a
very good point to be
to be um that's that's funny man you're
gonna come up with a better name like a
real name
so
in Puerto Princesa yeah so uh I saw a
lot of development work last time I was
there
you know they're already you know trying
to prepare New Roads new shopping malls
new stuff because it uh grew so fast
region is a series of islands and it's
still a remote area
so being a quiet sleepy remote area
there's not much going on not much
development
uh don't get me wrong very beautiful
so yeah they still need to develop
further but don't get me wrong it's very
beautiful
Adam Ramirez any suggestions on sick
hostels in Quran brother watch my videos
I already covered that I mean I went to
ecology I'll get I'll get the video
um I went to eco lodge by the hospitals
I I did cover some too I think
I'm not saying you have to stay at these
places I'm just saying I did I did give
a
like a coverage
let me let me
um
eco lodge is misleading it's not like
the ecology or ecosystem it stands for
Economy Lodge current economy lodge see
how they played on words
so it's not to do with the environment
but they do care about the environment
um
and uh Casa Quran as well I covered Casa
Quran so yeah look at look at my Quran
videos brother like you can go to my
channel and search it but I'll try to
make it easy for you
I think I did Cover a Quran Hotel
what was it what was it Zurich oh yeah
Zurich yeah that was ghetto man that was
good it was okay and I'll just get it
that was a great trick that was a great
trip but Zurich was a bit gooder and
they they did try and scare me a little
bit because the manager was not there if
the manager was there it would have been
fine but the staff were being a bit
naughty Zurich uh
action
house yeah
but that's just one example there's many
many affordable they call them pension
houses
I'm just saying culturally they call
Affordable Place suspension houses
because Motel means sex when you say
hotel it means a six motel I'm just
that is what they call it and there's
short stay motels like you can stay two
hours three hours four hours you know
short stay bump
so usually people are having their love
affairs or students you know students
just want to quickly go with their
girlfriend
whatever so that's that's why I just
kind of weird whenever I say are there
any cheap motels are there any motels oh
sure very bad why you go to motel you
are a bad boy so what I just need a chip
I just need achievement you know like um
they thought I'm doing something bad and
they say no sir we have pension house
whatever is happening you know so anyway
funny stories I've got plenty of
colorful stories so let's keep going
uh you're traveling solo okay I see what
you mean
uh Troy Arab Airbnb guys I I know I
haven't covered it on my channel
but try Airbnb because I wanted this
trial it and started using it but I've
just been using other vendors you know
yeah so Airbnb are pretty cool because
you know you're
you're just using someone else's
apartment or house or whatever and it
can be very affordable especially in
bigger cities
yeah but uh hey don't get me wrong
there's still great options for
traditional hotels they're very
affordable in Southeast Asia so
let's keep going
oh okay so you're Michael Strong thanks
for joining us brother I appreciate you
sharing and I'll have to look in the
barley now
and good luck with the shooting and get
an AR-15 Michael Strong
I'm not sure if you have an AR get an
AR-15
message me yeah
because we can't even have the
Ministries okay let's keep going so yeah
thanks Michael Strong
to be yeah it's a waste of time and
money to get married in your early 20s
well not necessarily
I'm not hating on marriage and it's
because I grew up in a very traditional
you know Asian family
I think it's really important
but people really they don't have the
courage and confidence to have the real
chat like what do you really want out of
this marriage and be honest and that's
both both parties like are you just
after money or do you want to have kids
you want to raise kids
um do you want to trouble you know
people don't have the confidence
so in your early 20s you usually just
don't have the confidence to have that
chat
so what do you do you lie to each other
you're [ __ ] oh yeah I'm like that
and oh yeah sure let's live happily ever
after
you see what I mean
and then yeah excuse me guys I'm just
dealing with muscle
excuse me pardon me but yeah so it's not
to say that marriage in your 20s is bad
it's that most people don't have the
chat
and then they don't go chat to the
parents and work it out properly
uh you know so all manner of lies and
bullcrap and sneaking around and what
happens when other parents aren't happy
and they're fighting and now the couples
fighting and oh and the Mother-in-law
doesn't like them
do you think because I didn't have the
chat they all made the chat about all
that stuff
like in time
so it took them two years to have those
shirts like just slowly dating you know
if it took them five years to have those
chats that's what they'll supposed to do
have those awkward chats
that way you can work it out and even if
it doesn't work out better you break up
instead of having a messy divorce you
know you know what I mean breaking up
while dating
rather than breaking up when you're
married and you're supposed to be
together
and then you have a messy divorce and
I've seen that it's me and it's nasty
when you see a messy divorcing it hurts
because especially when you're friends
with them too
so uh yeah so the whole point is
communicate communicate communicate
communicate I know it sounds very cliche
but most people need the courage they
need the strength
you know the the confidence to okay have
that chat
have that damn chat
and you know what I'm gonna tell a story
because I'm getting carried away and
I've got to own this a friend of mine
who's a hairdresser he's a silent
achiever good looking guy and he always
dresses well like always wears a shirt
and trousers it's a hairdresser and

her back and they they did end up
getting married
um but can you say that these are the
chats you're supposed to have so
this is my marriage counseling I know
that was that was a good one but man
when he told me that story because I
know I was like oh you said that and you
took the ring off and I was like oh
and he goes bro it's not worth it
even if I'm like oh I don't want to say
anything I don't want to upset her we're
just going to break up anyway we're
going to keep fighting it's my point so
that if we needed to work that out you
know as awkward as that was
anyway let's keep going let's see what
else people are saying
or to be what advice would you give to
your 15 year old self
um I I think I would because I just
spoke so long I would give that same
advice about marriage
until that same advice like have have
them have the chats build up the
conference to have those awkward chats
and um
to my 15 year old I would say
do things that help you build confidence
do things that help you build confidence
and it's one step at a time
and what else would I tell my 15 year
old till
many people will lie to you in your life
yeah I'm being honest that's what I'd
say to my 15 months old many people will
lie to you in your life slap wake up I'd
slap myself and say wake up
um you know just to be very brief many
people close to me have betrayed me
yeah I mean in in personal relationships
in business you know
and um
yeah it's it's okay I'm a shooter now
I'm a shooter so
if schools need to be sold one day I'll
smoke them with the 12 gauge shotgun
no I'm joking I'm joking
or am I
no but it's a thing yeah once he's once
you start
doing certain things uh you know once
you start leveling up in general you
start building up your life and leveling
up you know you figure this stuff out so
yeah I say to my 15 year old self many
people will lie to you in your life and
many people will betray you
um
but
you know it's okay just do things that
help build your confidence that's what I
would say
yeah
yeah I'd say I'd say something like that
you know I would think of a better
speech
in bravado I could write down a better
speech but yeah that's what I'd say Okay
Michael Strong oh I just remembered Adam
even locals do not
travel drive at night yeah thank you
Michael and strong yes
he's saying locals don't drive at night
sometimes
it's very dangerous yep they don't turn
on their headlights they don't have the
light bulbs or they don't want to waste
electricity or they can't afford light
bulbs
the halogen bolts
bikes as well as cars and trucks very
dangerous yeah they'll crash into you
man they'll crash into each other it's
crazy
I remembered
I hired the event the entire van for
myself for a hundred dollars from Porto
Princessa tornado yeah yeah that's
common I mean usually you share it
you're a high roller Michael but yeah
you just share it with a couple of
people
uh
van will be full of people yeah I mean
it doesn't have to be yeah
I was with myself Seth Lin and the Two
Italians only five of us
I know on those two Filipinos yeah we
had a full van but it was comfortable
like we had room we went we went to that
but I know what you mean yeah it gets
annoying when I when I put like 10
people and you're like are you serious
yeah they do that on everything uh even
buses
I kid you not I've been on a bus from
Cebu Cebu City going down south to oslob
and then Dumaguete we were like this in
the bus standing up
and then we would have to walk out and
let people out of the bus and then walk
back in you know is that packed well we
didn't really walk out they just jumped
up they would jump on top of the chairs
on your shoulders it was just ridiculous
it's um yeah as the bus continued more
people got off and eventually we could
sit down but it was just ridiculous
uh that was too much that was really too
much making everyone stand like that so
I really feel for you know the elderly
and people have to stand like two hour
bus
it's really really hot
but do Thursday I think duterte is
fixing up too so anyway uh let's keep
going
oh Neo Neo steeled double o one um Neo
Shield I guess Neo I'll just go Neo hey
Nia good to hear from you brother yeah
he's a regular long-time subscriber he
he says I grew up driving in Philippine
roads
in vehicles without seat belts when you
don't wear them you have a tendency to
not drive at speeds
which throw you around yeah you're
cornering when you turn Corners you
really gotta yeah slow down yeah yeah so
yeah Neo's got a good point you've got
to build up experience and know how to
drive slowly it's a thing
in the west we actually crash a lot we
drive too fast and we crash it's a fact
so many people crashes on the news you
know Cupid
uh so that is a good point they do learn
to drive slowly and carefully
Michael is saying
the drive will not be fast since the
roads are under undeveloped so it will
take four hours to arrive in El Nido
yeah that's true yeah it's very true and
the driver is going to stop to eat yep
so you might want to take a toilet break
CR against I needed
Adam Ramirez hey thanks for the two
dollar tip bro hey I appreciate it man

uh David Bond if you want he's playing
football ah see this patchum Parabellum
it's true serious patchum Parabellum
there's a reason why they say that in
Latin
the Romans have been saying that for a
long time and the rest of Europe
inherited it
yeah that's where nine mil Parabellum
came from nine millimeter was named
after War the caliber of War
I mean they did it for marketing let's
be honest they did it to sell the
goddamn bullets like millimeter
parability for marketing but yeah it
comes from Latin for those who
understand
if you see peace you prepare for walk
that's true

should do it too don't be embarrassed
don't be embarrassed focus on yourself
you know whatever it is whether it's
working on your reading your writing
your public speaking technology learning
how to use a computer
learning how to communicate it's
personal skills you know having those
weird chats with your partner
or awkward chats you know
uh yeah it's important to work on
yourself you know and personal
development so to speak and we're
supposed to do it
but not many of us but take the time
and uh
if you get good first then you can get
good and help other people later
you see how it works you can't help
anyone if you're not good first
that's why it's all you know you got to
take care of yourself first not in a
selfish way just literally like
um if you've got problems well we all
got problems or it's normal
so yeah fix them first
hit yourself first okay uh and also yeah
