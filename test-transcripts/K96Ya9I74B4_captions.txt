there are just so many things going on
right now and i just want to go home
to manila okay guys whoa
[Music]
rather short b-roll intro day for you
guys but you've basically
seen this place like every single inch
square inch of this place you've seen it
already good morning guys what's going
on
uh it feels like i haven't talked to you
guys in a very long time even though we
have been uploading
daily to either our main channel or the
reaction channel so
we have been talking but not like a
heart to heart the last video was more
kind of like a topical thing
gcq we're here what does it mean
let's go into town get some provisions
and talk about that
[Music]
is dropping off the washing inside i
wanted to share something with you guys
something a little bit
upsetting um so we created
this uh very fun video for you guys it
was the
quarantine games 2020 which was a very
amusing
very fun video that unfortunately got
flagged by youtube as inappropriate
content and it took us a while to figure
out why it was flagged as inappropriate
and
the subtitling system the automatic
subtitling system of youtube
misunderstood me
when i said a word they thought it was a
very bad word when in actual fact it was
a very good word
and that flagged the video as
inappropriate
and hence youtube just killed the video
and none of you guys like
not even a percent of you guys got to
see the video so
if you haven't seen it it's really it's
a fun upbeat vlog that we did together
with um george and lucy with michelle
uh carson and zoe there were a lot of
people involved in the video it was
really it's really fun
and it'll pop up right here so
definitely check it out if you haven't
seen it um
it's still there just youtube doesn't
push it out to the audience
[Music]
look at this little puppy so cute
oh my god oh my god
do it with a
so since yesterday officially province
of surigao del norte
is under a general community quarantine
so what does this mean well the uh
the measures of the current you know a
little bit less strict than they were
under the enhanced community quarantine
but by no means does this mean that we
can just go out and
explore the island or anything general
community quality in still means
stay at home go out to buy essentials
and
people that are allowed to go to work
are allowed to go to work that is it
it doesn't mean that we can go out and
just explore the island
what it does mean is there a certain
activities that are allowed during the
general communication general community
quarantine
that is a mouthful for example video
production is allowed
now what does that mean for vlogging i
don't know we will find out very soon
but it's one of the things that i
allowed but uh yeah it's still very
very unsure exactly what people can do
what people can't do
um one thing is clear whenever we leave
the house
this this is how we're going to
communicate with each other so
uh it's a face mask all the time and if
you don't wear a face mask
you might get a find right now we're
currently getting breakfast at a
local spot that's called beach baby
obviously for tay cart that's another
one of those things on the general
community quarantine it's still only
forte cotton
so that is another thing we'll have to
get used to in life there's no
not going to be any restaurant visits
for quite some time
thank you very much uh we'll just start
because nelly and i really love to
go to restaurants but you know safety
comes first it's a small price to pay
and we'll have to see how it develops
with the new normal now
if a place is on the community
quarantined for general community
quarantine for two weeks then
it should transition to the new normal
if there's no spiking cases i guess
uh what the new normal means is still
very unclear
i feel like you guys don't know i feel
like you don't know how i feel at the
moment because you can't see that i'm
actually got a smile on my face it just
looks kind of
with the mask maybe serious all the time
i don't know let me know in the comments
down below
[Music]
[Music]
um
so we're trying to get some chicken from
the market we didn't have chicken
in a very very long time so keep fingers
crossed
that we can have a little change of
taste today
[Music]
good news what's the good news we have
some chicken
nice careful it's dripping uh-oh i'm
quite quite happy that we got the
best pande coco on the island which is
so delicious if you ever happen to be in
chagall
you will find the stand opposite of the
church they're not always
there but if they're there get your
hands onto these
delicious little fluffy
[Music]
okay guys whoa
something really strange is happening at
the moment
uh we came back home and
oh guys be careful
it comes from this side it's from this
yeah do you think somebody's throwing
them
it looks like somebody's throwing it
sorry um
today we were sitting in the bedroom and
all of a sudden i
hear something falling into the swimming
pool here
and i looked at it and it was a stone so
i was like
very strange where does this come from
few minutes a few minutes later there
was another stone coming
from above so i was like okay what's
going on here
now we went outside came back again
and there are stones
falling from the sky right now i think
there's somebody throwing stones at the
building
literally but why a bell just clamped
onto the roof to see i don't know
maybe some stupid kids playing i don't
know
anyways don't go don't go no i'm staying
underneath the roof
yeah cool that has been happening
uh yeah so one of our caretakers
is currently climbing on the roof to see
what's going on
are they birds in sagar that pick up
stones and let them drop because
i've read of there being birds that drop
stones really
but why all of a sudden why i mean we've
been here for like
over a month
[Music]
young man just throwing some for fun
did you tell him to stop yeah
okay thank you
yeah so it was some young man over there
throwing stones over here for whatever
reason i have no idea i think they're
really dangerous
you know when when it hits you on the
head exactly and it's it's not just like
it wasn't just like
now it's been going on all day i mean if
you look here in the pool
i can see there's a rock back there
there's a rock over here
anyways what i actually wanted to say
before
this person started throwing drugs
is that i have some good news some very
good news
and some bad news i'll start with the
bad news
so uh we published the current in games
vlog and one of the challenges was to
eat
choco mucho and as you guys know i don't
react really well to chocolate so
may i present to you my new friends my
new pimples in the face
it was really really bad to eat that
much chocolate
so i think i'm going to stop for
a while now because my skin doesn't like
it
it's just everything is very itchy and i
feel very ugly
and i need to get back to normal
the good news is you guys love the video
which i'm really really happy about
because
the day before we were really kind of
down and then we did this this video
and we were so happy we enjoyed filming
it so much
we we had one of the happiest moments
during our quarantine and i was pretty
sure you guys will love it
and the feedback has been amazing um
so then um i think mike mentioned that
the thing with the monetization happened
so
uh youtube started youtube stopped
pushing the video out to you guys so if
you missed it
uh definitely check it out i will
link it here here the very good news is
after being very down that the video
hasn't been shown to you guys in
appropriate way
i was feeling very down but
then i read the comments um a few
messages on my channel
and it made me very
teary-eyed because a lot of people say
they are they were struggling
so much with with anxiety and depression
and that that video made them small and
they watched it several times and it put
a smile on their face
and i think that was
the best news for us despite the fact
that um
you know it wasn't shown properly to
like all of our subscribers
there are over 300 000 here so yeah
if you enjoyed the video feel free to
share it with your friends or to
with somebody who needs a smile um i
think it's very
very well done i i have to say it was
really well done
like we put in so much effort and i i
really struggled to
not uh i would say not smart i was like
super serious and i had this role of
being the
game host and then the athlete so it was
so
hilarious um maybe we'll do a little a
little behind the scenes
um so like a few fun facts
all of our friends who submitted videos
for that
uh for the quentin games had no idea
what we were up to we just gave them
a task for example we said to carson and
zoe or just you know
do a happy dance and cheer cheer people
up
to george and lucy we said oh george
could you play
a song and sing we heal as one and
lucy you danced to it and be very
inspirational
and the results were incredible
incredible
uh yeah and then you know
obviously um the turnout was so
so good that i had to like i was loving
tears when we were editing the video so
yes i think i promoted it a lot so if
you haven't checked it out check it out
all right guys nelly and i sitting down
now to film some more videos for our new
channel

had an overview yet subscribe right now
check out our videos and
yeah um also guys if you have any
contacts or information on railroads
between
surigao city and late and elia and i
want to
get back home to manila please let us
know in the comments down below
maybe if you know who to contact at
montenegro shipping lines and fast cut
yeah uh those are the ferries that are
not go to between surigao and late day
we really need your help on this
maybe you can reach out on our behalf
and kind of like ask them
what the latest information is because
we battling to get infos on that
yeah and thank you so much for sending
us the info for the dot
sweeper flight unfortunately it's only
for filipinos not for foreigners so
yeah um i think it was the third or
fourth flight
that we didn't manage to get on so
also we're currently waiting on a travel
pass from makati city that allows us to
drive
all the way back home also during the
gcq in the areas
heading up and then obviously at the
checkpoints uh in the manila area we
need something to
kind of enter so yeah we're waiting on
all of that and the ferry so a lot of
things
going into our uh planning to get back
home
um as i said a lot of a lot of you guys
have commented like oh why don't you go
out and explore the island
that's not what gcq is um it's still
the the general community quarantine and
quarantine means stay at home
unless you're going out to get
essentials or go to work so
you can't go out and explore and also
after the two weeks of gcq
it still lies in the power of the local
government units to decide if
they will continue the quarantine or
keep the quarantine going on so i don't
think even
after may 15th i don't think that the
quran team will be lifted here in chaga
it still might
be continued or the karaga region might
decide to lock down again so there's so
many things that go into it
that need to be considered so we really
want to be at home that's
that's our our main priority right now
and you must forget
we we we are we've been straight we left
manila
uh the fourth of march and we've been
stranded so
when we we left manila not knowing that
there was going to be
any quarantine whatsoever we thought we
were going to be out of manila for a few
weeks
during our road trip and then when we
had left manila all of this
happened so we literally were stranded
since all of this already happened and
yeah
and of course if you know any direct
contact uh please let us know
it has been really really difficult to
get the right person in front of us
um even like with local d.o.t
here or like manila representative so
please if you know somebody uh who is in
charge
of anything that could help us let us
know uh shoot us an email or send us a
message on instagram it will be really
really helpful
if it's if it's like the interagency
task force or the
dot units in makati and here
uh or some makati city officials that
can maybe help us with just like
it's so hard to get the right infos and
the right regulations it's
it's really hard because it's such a
special case for us
um because we were foreigners that live
in the philippines and are stranded
outside of
makkah it's so complicated it is so
complicated so
any help is highly appreciated
unfortunately the austrian embassy in
makati is unable to
unable unwilling uh to help i don't know
why
yeah we feel a little bit left out um
as i mentioned earlier on the kranting
games
vlog was really a video that we enjoyed
doing
a lot we had so much fun um it was the
first time in corinthians that we felt
pure happiness so check it out
that's it sorry
okay guys i'm going to be very honest
with you i
woke up today
and i actually wanted to have a positive
vlog
and be happy but it's really difficult
at the moment for me
there are just so many things going on
that
are kind of circulating in my head
um right now and i just want to go home
to manila i'm really
sorry that i can't be my true self right
now
i'm trying i'm really trying
and i feel like it's important to share
because the other day i received a
message from a viewer saying
oh why can't you be more positive and
i'm like
we have tried really hard really hard to
stay positive
and i know that a lot of people don't
see us being in a bad situation
but there are certain things that we are
not talking about
on camera um
and i just wanted to let you know that
it's okay to have bad days
i'm really sorry that i can't be happy
every day i'm trying
we are both trying um
i just feel like
i need to share this with you to be
authentic
because not every day is easy during
currently
and during this uncertain time so
i also received a message from a viewer
who said
if you need help there is currently a
free hotline from good work philippines
where you can
call a specialist and who can help you
and guide you through you know times
when you have
bad days i'm happy that i have mike
so you know every time when i'm having a
bad day i can talk to him but
i'm pretty sure that a lot of people out
there are not able to talk about what
bothers them
and yeah it's linked in the description
down below
thank you so much for tuning in today
i'm hoping for better days
yeah well this is going to sound awkward
but remember to stay
awesome
positive and make it happen take care of
yourselves guys
mentally and physically yes
speak soon
you
