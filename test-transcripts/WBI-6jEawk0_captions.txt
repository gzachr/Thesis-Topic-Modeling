[Music]
good morning from a freezing cold minus
3 degree
austria we are here in my little
hometown where i grew up in austria
and we are going for a morning walk to
answer
some
questions that you guys asked yesterday
on nelly's instagram account by the way
if you don't follow nelly
instagram account is in right here so
close to hitting 100k on instagram so
head on over give her a follow give her
likes and her message she really
appreciates it and replies to pretty
much every single message
i try suddenly we got a bunch of
questions yes uh a bunch of very
prominent questions there were a few
questions that were asked like dozens
and dozens of times yeah and we decided
to answer those questions today here on
this vlog
yeah we haven't done an update video in
a very long time um with a little q a
session so i thought okay
now is the time because we have seen the
comments we read your comments we see
the messages
and we see there are some questions we
have to answer how is life going okay
question number one how's life going
chaotic
life is very very chaotic have you as
you have seen in the past few vlogs
because
originally we left the philippines to
travel for
just like 28 days and it keeps getting
extended by the craziness going on in
the world right now
and uh
life is good i'm really happy to be with
family and i'm really happy to see
friends
starting to really really miss manila
though
starting to miss the routine the daily
life that we have in manila you know the
good healthy routines and
yeah i'm missing manila i'm missing my
coffee shop runs it's a different pace a
different life here in austria uh you
have to slow down a little bit
especially when you
yeah when you're out in the country
literally nothing around here the
closest coffee shop is a 30-minute drive
away from here so i actually bought an
espresso machine just so i could have my
flat white here in austria
but yeah it's it's it's really nice to
be at home by my parents my mom cooks
for me every day
my dad makes breakfast for me every day
i just get up and i'm there it's nothing
to do
so yeah you slow down and you relax we
we've taken an absolute abstinence from
alcohol to stay healthy
so life is chaotic good
happy but missing manila
yeah by the way guys we are currently
standing in front of a
farm yes
and in there there are some cows and
usually the cows
are out in the field
and you can come here and buy your
milk exactly there's a milk dispenser
here where you just put in the coins and
you get a liter of milk these are
actually quite happy cars right now
they're indoors but they get to roam
around outside and they eat look quickly
yeah they eat grass they they grass-fed
kettles are
really happy cows
and this is how it looks
here you put in
um the money
or the card and here you get the milk
freshly
squeezed out of these cows they're so
cute
nelly question number two yes are we
going to visit george and lucy
very very frequently asked question
since we are in europe and we are just a
two-hour plane ride away from george and
lucy but the answer is unfortunately no
um
travel is a complicated thing right now
and george and lucy are about to have
their child within like maybe today or
this week or next week so we don't
really want to add stress to the
situation um as well but the good news
is we're going to facetime soon we are
in touch with them
literally every day so we have whatsapp
group and you know we just text every
day so we are still close um still
communicating on a daily basis and of
course we miss them but we'll definitely
visit them once the baby's day and
they're like settled especially uh now
during covet you know george and lucy
have to kind of isolate from the outside
world because if they have to go into
hospital
to
give birth to the child and one of them
gets covered
it's really really bad so they they are
isolating as much as possible so it
wouldn't be fair for us to even you know
offer to come and then sit and play and
have so much contact so yeah in the
future 100 sure but for now it doesn't
make sense
mike what country are we going to visit
next
we are currently planning a very very
special trip
very very special location that we're
going to be visiting
um and i don't want to spoil it i want
it to be a surprise
but we're going to be flying in the next
few days
and we're both super super excited for
this
and i think uh
it's going gonna be some really amazing
content gonna be coming out today i know
you guys are gonna enjoy that i know you
guys are gonna enjoy it i know we're
gonna enjoy it
and it's gonna be the last step before
one of the upcoming questions that are
gonna be asked yes the most asked
question is
when are you coming back to the
philippines
and the answer is
very soon
it's it is imminent that's how soon it
is it is so soon that the next country
visiting the flight back to manila will
be going from that country to manila
yeah directly unless uh
unless i don't know
robocop crown variant pops up somewhere
we don't want to jinx it okay i don't
want to it's enough
of
you know being stuck and
not being able to go anywhere before
daft punk crown comes
here's just an indicator of how cold it
is
this is
a blank sheet
of ice
solid frozen block of ice yeah it is
it's really cold and we are not
happy about
i miss i miss the warm weather i miss
the warm people i miss the smiles i miss
the good vibes
i mean
yeah austria is beautiful we saw the
comments and you guys really appreciated
the content that we did here
um
but we just feel a little bit happy in
the philippines yeah and with that being
said um content wise we are still going
to do a street food video
here austrian street food we are going
to go up a mountain with ralph which is
actually happening tomorrow
and we have a special special event
on sunday yes that we will share very
soon we're not going to spoil anything
about that
it's really we're super excited about it
and then a lot of people requested that
we also do kind of something or about
the sound of music we're kind of looking
into that right now and obviously a
tour of vienna yes so many have been
requesting that so we'll definitely
still do that before we travel and
skiing skiing yes
so much to do such so little time yeah
okay what you see in the background here
is a fear kantov so it's a farm that is
basically a square
and it is open in the middle um it's a
very old
uh traditional
form of farming farmhouses here in
austria well this is getting renovated
but this is how
farms look in
austria right lily next question yes
where's peanut where is pita peanut is
in our condo
with taco with our friends
we miss her so much and
i'm not happy that we are away for so
long but she's in good hands she gets a
lot of cuddles a lot of love and she has
a playmate i mean i can quickly show you
here this is taco this is peanut
they're so cute together yeah
so as you guys see she has a playmate
she's not alone
and we're so so happy to hug her once we
are back
okay mike what do you think of when you
feel down
what do i think of when i feel down is
that like what do i do to stop myself
from being down yeah i think so
i'd like to
i like to think of the positive things
in life the things that
um
i appreciate in life the things i'm
happy i have the people i'm happy i have
and as barney stinson once said
when i'm sad i stop being sad and be
awesome instead i just try to think of
the positive things in life and try to
think of what is the cause of me being
sad what is the actual root why am i sad
and most of the times
you'll realize that it's
not really worth being sad about yeah
and sometimes when i feel down i write
down three things that i'm grateful for
and i try to visualize
you know
where i want to be in what kind of state
of mind i want to be how it feels like
and
yeah if you set a goal and say oh i want
to do this once i have overcome that um
it's much easier to focus on on the good
on the on the positive outcome yeah and
if i can give one advice to anybody out
there
uh never compare yourself to other
people
it's never good don't compare yourselves
to us no yeah that's very important to
communicate as well everybody everybody
has
their issues everybody has their
problems
and
very few people
share to the outside what problems or
what issues or thoughts or what things
they have that are that are
uh distracting them in life so never
compare yourself to other people people
like to just put the good
side of their life out there not the
negative side so
social media is something very very
dangerous just uh
focus on yourself don't focus on other
people
and something that we did during this
trip is just basically
you know leave the phone in the car or
just not
not have it available at all times
because we you know
grab our phone automatically and it was
just for us it was good to take a break
to take a step back and be fully fully
in the moment i haven't posted many
instagram stories from all south africa
trip also not that many videos although
we spent
quite a time there and it was so good
just to
you know enjoy the moment and not enjoy
them
the
phone yeah okay next question
what camera gear do we use oh that's a
good question so uh our main filming
vlogging camera is the sony a7s3 paired
with a vid mic pro plus microphone
that's like our main setup everything
linked in the description down below
it's amazon links we get a little bit of
a kickback when you use them so if
you're in looking for gear please use
those links yeah okay nelly very
interesting question up next what are
your favorite songs right now uh
favorite songs right now of course uh
chad faker we're huge fans of chat faker
we listen to chat fake i think every day
we listen to a lot of jazz so we just
have a jazz playlist
we also listen to
[Music]
french music french cafe music because
it relaxes us and we also listen to our
vlog music we have a whole playlist for
you guys
it will pop up right here
and it's also linked in the description
box down below
um because we get asked so much about
the music that we use in our vlogs that
we decided to dedicate
a channel to it so um if you want you
can subscribe and you can just i think
how long is it mike oh it's two hours
almost three months at home and you want
to listen to you know making it happen
good vibes music from our vlogs you can
just
hit play and it will run for like two
hours
um in the background so yeah also so
basically that channel was the making it
happen shorts channel we just changed it
to making it happen music because we
didn't have time to do all these short
videos yeah and we also have shorts now
on youtube yeah exactly so we don't need
a dedicated channel for it but yeah also
we're gonna put on there just like
playlists for different situations
because
i have
different kind of playlists that i
listen to when we are hanging out with
friends or when i'm trying to learn from
my pilot's license when i'm trying to
relax
on a date night so i'll i'll put all of
that music together in playlists i'll do
like one or two per week so you guys can
just listen to it i actually wanted to
do also a christmas playlist yeah i'll
do that for next year yes i'll do that
for next year but definitely head on
over there subscribe watch watch the
playlist that's online now it's it's
just very chill you can just have it
running in the background and yeah yeah
i also bought a ton of amazing
b-roll from our travels through palawan
because everywhere in the philippines
and titles and artists exactly so
it's not just uh good music if you have
a tv hanging in your living room you
have amazing like
b-roll footage from the philippines
running in the background which is
really nice
okay and another one that is very very
high in demand when it comes to the
questions
when is your wedding
and when is your family coming to visit
the philippines so
that's a two-part question and it
belongs together our wedding is as soon
as our family can visit us in the
philippines
right now only
foreigners that have a long-stay visa
like us can travel back to the
philippines
um
if you guys saw a few weeks ago we got a
permanent residency visa that's why we
did this whole trip because we were able
to come home to the philippines again
um but tourists are not permitted
foreign tourists so we have to wait
until tourism opens again for foreigners
in the philippines and then we can set
the date
and then we can make plans
i'm hoping that it's 2022
but it just really depends on
the world it depends on what's what's
going to happen you know
safety still has the utmost priority
um so we have to put our own personal
interests aside
and concentrate on getting the world
back to where it needs to be but we
spoke a lot about the philippines with
our friends and family and they are
super super excited to visit
i know that uh my cousins were already
looking for flights and i said whoa whoa
wait you can't even enter the country
you have to wait um yeah because they
just saw a footage as well on the vlogs
and
everybody is super excited because we
shared our experiences
and yeah it's going to be amazing once
they can travel to the philippines all
right guys thank you for submitting the
questions once again nelly's life

let us know how you like it in the
comments yes yes that's not how you like
the idea of having our music and our
playlist ready there for you to listen
