what is up guys it is validate on blog
it is a nighttime vlog today something
completely different
Nelly and I decided to come out to
publish on and check out the awesome
little bars and
clubs bars cafes restaurants yeah I
don't want to be above that I supposed
to have amazing drinks we're just gonna
run around this like five hotspots here
impoverish on papazoni Burano it's kind
of like the center of the city progress
on translates to city center
we're in Makati publish on in Makati a
very old neighborhood as you can see
from the buildings but over the past few
years a lot of cool restaurants and bars
have moved into this area and that is
what we want to explore and show you
guys today so one thing that we haven't
done so far
it's just to try some nice neighborhood
spots so we are based in the Gaspee
village as you guys now and today we're
going to try some old fashioned I guess
my dear stay private let's do those
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
nearly for number one what's the verdict
the verdict is we stay too long I have
two things I'm drinking a shot
[Music]
interior design the drinks were
fantastic the music reminded me of Soul
Train which we wash together you guys
done the Soul Train with you so
Hoss video
it's probably going to be one of the
easiest and most fun videos ever but my
verdict is one of the best old fashions
I've had in months really good wild
turkey bourbon not too sweet ice-cold
nice splash water on the very nice
cosmetic part and pull by good music
and the crowd and the crowd was cool and
young so now we're going to location
number two which is the apartment
nodosa you've done it if that's it if we
can find it

really cool place we met the two guys
that are running the events here today

CJ I actually watched our videos so
really cool to meet people that are
involved in the whole scene here Carlo
Sean and actually the guys that make it
happen really cool yeah we're gonna go
down and check out the band I think
they're stopped angle yeah
[Music]
alright phonetic we just left the
apartment the verdict is it's a cool
place they have like multi-level
situation going on they got a life ban
which is really awesome and seemingly
every Friday they have a they call it
the green door the green bar where they
just have vinyl so mode nothing digital

very fun luck I thought this was going
to be a Oh welcome to the blog and
