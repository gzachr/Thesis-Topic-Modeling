hi i'm femi okay
today on the stream filipino nurses on
the front lines of
covid we find out why one group of
nurses have died from the coronavirus
in greater numbers than their co-workers
i know you have
questions this is a mystery that has
multiple answers
jump into the youtube comment section
and you too can be part of today's show
we start with a tribute from one of the
largest nurses unions
in the united states take a look
filipino nurses and other foreign
trained health workers
are very much the unsung heroes
of healthcare delivery
and there are so many hospitals and
healthcare institutions
that would not be able to run as
efficiently and effectively
without the work of filipino nurse
migrants
we're about to delve into the life the
work and some of the challenges of being
in the filipino nurse community with
sonny with janine with rosem thank you
for being on the stream
i'm going to get you to introduce
yourself to our audience sunny
go ahead tell us who you are what you do
thanks so much for having me
um first i wear a couple of hats i'm a
clinician i'm a pediatric nurse
practitioner but i'm
also a phd prepared nurse scientist and
professor at villanova university where
i teach
health policy research and pediatrics
good to have you janine
tell our audience who you are what you
do
so i'm janine um i'm a proud filipino
immigrant
um i migrated here when i was 19 with my
family
and i've been an icu nurse for about six
years now and
i'm i work in a cardiac icu in the top
hospital in new york city hi nice to
have you rosem
welcome to the stream introduce yourself
to the stream viewers
uh thank you so much for having me uh
similar to sunny i
i wear a bunch of different hats i am a
operating room nurse for about nine
years
i'm also a proud filipino immigrant and
i have also been documenting a bunch of
filipino nursing families throughout the
pandemic as a freelance documentary
photographer
all right so lady i'm going to get all
of your take on this because they're
more
there's more than one answer but i i
want to start sunny with you
there's a statistic that is a shocking
statistic
for filipino nurses and covered
casualties and coveted deaths coveted
infections
can you hit us with that statistic
because
it is huge and it will make everybody
stop doing what they're doing and watch
the tv
or their screens i think the first thing
people have to know
is that filipino nurses make up four
percent of the total
registered nursing population in the
united states however
when it comes to covid they've suffered
one-third of the casualties that have
been experienced by registered nurses
in the u.s this may be due to a couple
of things
first of all filipino nurses
disproportionately work
in really highly acute areas like
intensive care for instance
also they're also employed sometimes in
areas such as long-term care facilities
which are not as acute
but are really great vectors as we know
for the covid virus
i'm just looking janine uh pictures of
you
working on my laptop here and that
statistic
how did you find out about it and then
how did you experience it
so the small number relatively small
number of filipino nurses
working the u.s healthcare system and
then the large number who were impacted
by covet
so um i personally experienced it
when you know when new york city was
first hit by the pandemic
and the first surge happened in new york
city and we were admitting
very sick coveted patients in our icus
and that number is just really alarming
for me i actually didn't know about it
till
just recently um but also i think
um it's very important to know that you
know
even before the pandemic um
filipinos were already experiencing
poverty
and you know multi-generational and
multi
um multi-family households
and you know um there's
there's already inequality and i think
the inequalities
was just exacerbated by clovid19
when you talk about inequality and
poverty experience poverty if i say why
that is such a giant question we'll be
here for forever
but if you could sort of pinpoint why in
particular
some filipinos would be already in a
difficult situation
can you do that
sure so um
inequality because i think there's just
a lot of filipino nurses that work
in densely populated urban areas like
new york city and
los angeles right so um
and the fact that we work in areas
wherein they're
just like high exposures like the icus
the eds like sunny said
you know we're already um we're already
at a higher risk
of getting infected by cobit sure sunny
go ahead
so i think another really important
thing is that kovitz sort of highlights
an
issue that's really at the forefront of
a lot of things that are happening
in terms of legislation right now
specific to immigration
so a high proportion of you know
filipino nurses are immigrating from the
philippines
for many many reasons and they are the
solution to health care staffing
shortages in a bunch of countries
not just the us but canada ireland
germany uk australia finland
and the uae and so because filipino
nurses that
basic um sort of human capital that's
coming from the philippines
the highly qualified and trained human
capitalists coming from the philippines
is coming to help us with our staffing
shortages in the us
that's one of the reasons why they
experience
poverty when they arrive because when
you're new you're really just trying to
get settled and you don't really have a
lot
while you're trying to get on your feet
during covet a lot of things happened
there were there were a lot of solutions
that hospitals tried to use to mitigate
the staffing shortages
using our domestically trained nurses
and by that i mean nurses educated in
the united states
we tried to use unlicensed nurse interns
who cared
for coveted covid19 patients we tried to
learn nurses and doctors
who were already retired to come back to
us to try and practice
but in that sense we also relied
on this immigrant nursing workforce that
either has been here for a long time
or was recruited to come here to help us
resolve some of our staffing solutions
in that period
and that's why there may be poverty
experienced by the filipino community
even before the pandemic rosem i want to
play
a a little comment this is from melissa
and we asked melissa why would more
filipino nurses be dying
than their co-workers at exactly the
same time
working in the same conditions and this
is what she told us i would love you to
react
and then give us your take too here she
is
i think it really comes down to the
barrio to bedside pipeline
that is deeply rooted in u.s imperialism
and colonialism in the philippines
a recent study by jennifer nazareno of
the brown university filipino health
initiative
found that instead of addressing
insufficient staffing and unsafe working
conditions in the u.s
for decades policy has led to an exodus
of mainly white rns
from the acute inpatient and icu
settings
and has led to the direct recruitment of
immigrant labor primarily filipino
of these crucial roles that now have an
ever dangerous and life-threatening role
in covet 19.
rosem go ahead
there is just really a lot of things to
unpack
from from her statement her really
powerful statement
to start off i feel uh there is really
historical ties
to what brought the filipino nursing
diaspora here
in the in the united states um
uh american colonialism had established
the nursing profession to be what it is
what it is now in the philippines and in
turn
have uh have prepared many filipino
nurses
to be nurses in america instead of their
home country
so as so over the years as more and more
shortages have happened
uh through different pandemics and
different health crises filipino nurses
have answered that call
um or which really goes back to what she
was saying as
as more uh white uh nurses leave the
field
and create this demand filipino nurses
really
fill in those gaps and as mentioned
earlier it's usually in acute settings
in really high populated areas like new
york city
and culturally a lot of filipino nurses
also
live in in these multi-generational
households like
janine had mentioned earlier
so all of these different factors
coupled with
health health disparities as well
a lot of filipino communities have
high rates of diabetes or heart disease
and and
all of these risk factors really are
compounding each other
uh to make the community really be hit
hard by
colgate 19. ladies i want you to respond
to some of the comments on youtube you
don't have to agree with them
but i am really intrigued by your
reaction uh
rosem from youtube
filipinos will do jobs that people here
in the united states complain or won't
take
that is direct and pretty brutal your
thoughts
i think there's some accuracy in that
for sure um i think
a lot of the families i've photographed
are are working
60 hours a week or two full-time jobs
sometimes even three jobs
just to provide for their family and
they're not necessarily people
who would complain about work conditions
because they really
feel strongly about caring for their
patients and caring for their family
so i've also met some from
people who have paid the price for it
the pobata family um
her cheryl pabato she lost both of her
parents to
coven 19 very early in the pandemic
and that was because her father did not
have
personal protective equipment to protect
him while transporting
a cleveland 19 patient and that's
something that
he wasn't empowered enough to feel that
he could refuse
because he really wanted to care for his
patient at that time and i
i feel like many people were really
placed in difficult situations
especially in the beginning of the
pandemic when there was such a shortage
to protect yourself rosem i'm just
looking at your your photo series here
diaspora on the front lines talk us
through some of these pictures i'm just
about to click through here
this family um this
is uh the kapadyan family and that's
elizabeth grace and ernest capagnan and
that's
their first born child and both of them
are
nurses ernest on the right here he works
in the biocontainment unit so he
he has seen patients essentially die
every day
and this is mark bontagon here he works
night shift
at a telemetry unit and he tends to also
volunteer to take care of
covent patients on his on his unit
and that's him resting on his day oh man
you feel that
you feel that that pain where you're so
tired it hurts
some people in our youtube comment
section janine are just saying
this is all about racism this is all it
is
we're in the united states the
institutions are racist
this is racism janine respond
so like what i said earlier there was
already
some level of um inequality uh that was
just
exacerbated by the covid19 and i think
we should just
continue these conversations because
it's actually really important to
um to be able to talk about it and be
able as a filipino be
able to speak um my personal experiences
about it and
just you know i think it's true
there's some level of um inequality
maybe racism we don't know um at this
point
but um honestly do you
honestly not know are you just feeling
very cautious about not
calling it out we are in america right
now we are in america in 2021
are you being careful because you still
have to go back to work
later right and if we're saying health
institutions in the united states
uh could do so much better for their
filipino nurses
it's okay if you want to give that
question to sonny right
do you want to hand it over to her sonny
take it
so one thing i think that's really
important to remember and i think
touches on the experiences of
all nurses that are here is that it's
not easy to come to the united states
when you come to the united states you
are a highly
trained person that has a baccalaureate
degree
you in order to practice as a registered
nurse in the united states you also have
to pass
an english language exam you need to
have that education evaluated to make
sure it's the same
or at least equivalent to an american
education and you also have to pass
a board exam what's not expected when
people come here and
just as a footnote i'm also an immigrant
but i immigrated from
canada so when i check that box i check
immigrant
and i also check filipino but the
perception is a little bit
different but understanding that
you know people people who get care from
a filipino nurse are getting care from
an individual who has been trained to
care for them
who has had an education equivalent to
what we've had in the united states and
this idea of
inequality in terms of education
language
and culture is really a huge barrier to
sort of resolving a lot of the things
that
you're seeing there in the chat and also
by my colleagues that are here with me
and one of the things we could do so
much better
is to one understand that we're
recruiting people to come work
with us not for us but with us alongside
us
here in the united states and we could
do so much better by helping them
enculturate themselves
in the u.s but also within healthcare
facilities where both providers aren't
really
necessarily culturally competent enough
to understand what the immigrant nurse
does
because for so long there have been so
many other names that have been
attributed
to immigrant nurses or nurses that just
don't look like what we expect or white
such as foreign educated nurse um
you know internationally educated nurse
which are
basically euphemisms for nurses that
haven't come
from here and that's where we can you
know we can really make a great
improvement
you know on may 11th there's going to be
this very important document
released from the national academy of
medical sciences here in the u.s
so when that when that report gets
released it's going to be the future of
nursing report
2030 i will be so interested to know in
that report
which is focused on health equity if
anything is in there that really focuses
on how we can make the experience of
nurses coming to this country better so
we can work together
roseanne what do you want to add i can
tell that you have something
extra to jump into the conversation go
ahead
i i think just kind of jumping in on
that conversation
one of the things i discovered
throughout this journey of documenting a
lot of filipino nursing families is
there are recruitment agencies who
who who play the middle middleman role
in recruiting these nurses from the
philippines
and one of the nurses i i had documented
um she learned that this company is
taking a significant chunk of her salary
for the first
three years and that that also speaks to
the poverty issue
the adjustment period of immigration and
all these inequalities that really come
into play
to make you disadvantaged right from the
get-go when you're just trying to better
your life
and also provide care for people around
you
barbara glickstein is in our youtube
comments right now hi there barbara
thank you for having us
uh thank you for being part of the show
and barbara says thank you
for covering this critically important
issue the public needs to understand
how important filipino nurses are to the
health of the public
and their role in the health care system
and staffing
i i want to go back to the reason why we
started this conversation and bring in
emerson
because emerson is trying to unpack why
or when so many medical professionals
were on the front line
why filipino nurses in particular
face extra danger have a listen have a
look
a significant number of filipino
registered nurses work
in acute in critical care areas that
include
the intensive care unit and the
emergency department
which makes place in directly exposed or
vulnerable to the effects of the new
coronavirus
filipinos have disproportionate rates of
chronic illness
such as diabetes and hypertension when
compared with
other asian american subgroups these
conditions have been associated with the
severity of comet 19 symptoms
including deaths many of these
filipino-registered nurses
may be burdened by these chronic disease
states
janine i remember in the uk
last year during the early days of the
pandemic
the national health service discovered
that
people of color who in the medical
profession were dying
at greater numbers than their co-workers
they took them off the front lines they
made sure that they were safe as much as
they possibly could be
what has changed for filipino nurses
now that we've got this information that
we know that you have added risk
you're still working what's different
now
um i think um it can be nothing
i do not think there's much difference
to be honest with you there's just more
we're just we just have more information
and more knowledge about what we're
dealing with
um compared to when we first started
um last you know last year yeah um
so and there's like the vaccine now
and all those things we have more ppe's
now which is good
so i don't think there's much difference
but
i one thing i learned from this though
is i
have more appreciation and i feel more
proud of being a frontline worker and
filipino nurse
roseanne what's different now
i i would have to echo what janine said
that
at my job there hasn't really been
much difference i i feel like i am the
person who has been
telling the statistics to everyone i
know um
but it hasn't really shaken any kind of
changes
not that i i also kind of don't really
know
how to move forward from here knowing
knowing these
really astounding numbers
are you scared are you more scared now
that you've got the information
i think i'm i'm not more scared i'm kind
of more angry and i think that's really
why i'm pushing
for a lot of awareness on this topic i
think
not just what is happening now i also
want people to have an understanding of
what happened in the past that brought
us here
to really have this deeper understanding
of this filipino nursing diaspora we're
not just
people who are dying we're not just
statistics there are people's lives here
that are really
full and i want people to also get to
know that piece
i want to bring in one more thought and
this is from
butch de castro and it's really about
taking action
once we know this information how do we
act upon it have a listen to butch
healthcare organizations must critically
examine
those factors and decisions that create
working conditions
that increase filipino nurses
occupational exposure to covid
it's not just about the personal
protective equipment that's made
available to them
but it's also what nursing units they're
primarily employed in
what patients they're routinely assigned
to
what shifts they're typically given um
how many
hours they're made to work and the
bigger question that needs to be asked
is how institutional discrimination
may be influencing these determinations
and thus
unjustly subjecting them as nurses of
color
to disproportionate risk and burden of
covet-related illness
and death sonny what would you suggest
that we now do with this information not
just
filipino nurses but the public as well
what next you know covet has taught us
many things um you know we we've put a
lot of things in place that have helped
us to just get through this pandemic
and some of them have been really
brilliant but
what we really have to understand is
that these changes that we're making
through this discussion cut discussion
are going to make things better
for everybody and i think it's it's
a really important thing one to sort of
make sure that everybody is staffed
appropriately
two to make sure that we have the
equipment that we need in order to
protect us
but also really make conscious decisions
about
how nursing staff is being distributed
and
used you know nursing is a really tough
job
and when you're working at the front
lines of covid these
are areas and situations that we've
never been exposed to
so it's important for us to work
together
to make this whole year something that's
really meaningful but also something
that carries
us through a post-covered world
we need to really figure out a better
way to be a stronger
nursing workforce so that we can both
balance
the needs of you know nurses like janine
right at the front line and
nurses in the or like roseanne together
sunny janine rosem thank you very much
for taking part in our conversation
today about filipino nurses
and how they're being disproportionately
impacted by covid than their co-workers
thank you youtubers for your comments
and questions i have a feeling there are
a few nurses
in the youtube comments thank you for
that and let me send you to one more
place here
this is can lugen this will tell you
about
filipino nurses the tradition in the
united states
and also show you some of the
extraordinary people who we lost
over the past year thanks for watching
the stream see you next time
you
