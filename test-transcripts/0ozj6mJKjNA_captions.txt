so
a few days ago i reacted to a video
about what filipinos think of their
presidential election 2022
after having published the video a few
hours after i went to the comment
section as i usually do you know to read
the comments answer some comments and
like some comments
and i read that a lot of comments were
talking about a video that the youtube
channel project nightfall made you know
i wasn't sure what they were talking
about but clearly uh the people that
commented about it were not happy and
wanted to know what i thought of it okay
so
i looked it up you know on youtube i
went to the uh project nightfall youtube
channel and i did not see anything
related to that and apparently the video
was deleted
but
but the internet is the internet you
know nothing escapes the internet of
course
some people had already uh downloaded
the video so they re-uploaded it on
youtube and facebook and those links
were actually sent to me so today we
will be uh reacting to that video see
what project nightfall said about i
think uh the elections
so the title of the video i don't know
if that's
how uh the guy from project nightfall
entitled his video but here it's called
project nightfall
deleted video
slash why the philippines chose a
dictator's son as president
um
i'd like to preface my reaction video by
saying that i am not the biggest fan of
uh project nightfall you know especially
uh the way he edits his video the way he
presents his uh you know speeches
they feel very exaggerated you know so
that always like bothers me and irks me
and they he he always puts like this
positive spin on everything you know
it's just
it just doesn't feel very um down to
earth
all right let's just say it that way
okay uh before we continue on make sure
to follow me on instagram at music game
news because that is where you can dm me
all your suggestions
and without further ado let's get to it
oh why the philippines chose dictator's
son as predator as president okay so
that's how he called it
the whole world is looking at filipinos
right now as they're about to elect a
late dictator's son to be the president
of the philippines
so right there
you know i don't know if you can say
that because a lot of filipinos do not
consider ferdinand marcos as a
dictator in other countries this is what
you'll see
the greediest dynasty in the world is
back
[Music]
and from outsiders watching it unfold
this is what you'll hear the son of a
guy who terrorized the film
yep yup this video was sent to me uh
multiple times they asked me to react to
it unfortunately i could not because it
is owned by hbo i would have gotten a
copyright uh strike or issue whatever so
i decided not to react to it but still
watch it you know by myself
and
i kind of like you know this guy i
forgot his name but i like how he
presents things he puts a comedic spin
on everything you know and to be honest
the way he presented everything was good
but i did not agree uh with his final
thoughts
philippines for years is now the front
runners to take over bon bon marcos has
shown virtually no remorse for what his
father put the country through so why is
it that this man is leading a
presidential race by a landslide yes
over 30 million filipinos voted for him
at least according to the partial
unofficial tallies that is true but see
i could have made a video about the
unofficial tally but for me
it's not right to make a video about
that because it clearly states that it's
unofficial
i may make a video about
him becoming president if he officially
becomes president you know
uh is it because filipinos seen
something in him that a big part of the
world doesn't is it because filipinos
see something in him that's a big part
see it's the the way he speaks the way
he presents and the dramatic music and
the editing of the video that always
irks me
art of the world doesn't
[Music]
knight thumb this is a special night fam
that's how he calls them
yo that will spotlight not my opinion
but the voice of filipinos
for the filipinos and if you're what
okay well in that case if it's not his
opinion
then why are so many filipinos upset
with this video and why
did he remove it delete it from his
channel you know if it's not his opinion
why should he care really
hmm
unless he really thinks about his
youtube channel as a business and he
does not want that video to hurt his
channel you know
man people that cannot stay true to
themselves and i'll never get it
watching this election unfold from a
different part of the world stick around
because you might get your answer
wow look at that sea of pink lenny
robrito's
followers
ladies and gentlemen this is what they
said when we asked what are your hopes
and fears for the next president of the
philippines
does project nightfall live in the
philippines please let me know in the
comment section below because i feel
like he does or at least somewhere in
southeast asia because every time i see
him in his videos uh it seems like he is
living somewhere very warm
one thing is definite as it's often in
the politics there is a strong contrast
in opinions one side is already bracing
for really dark times it's a really dark
time for the philippines right now i
fear that disappearance torture
politically detained
death and other unlawful acts against
our freedom and human rights might
happen again while the other
is celebrating a bright future ahead and
as
30 plus millions of filipino people
voted for him i don't think we have the
reasons to be afraid of because yes
majority of us believed in him
so far the people that are being
interviewed sound very young
there is no reason to be fair because
our new elected president is chosen by
the majority
and i hope that new administration will
help all the filipinos in hall of needs
and put some good plans
in health education
economy and infrastructure it's almost
like they're living in different
realities holding different sets of
facts how could they trust a leader
who uses
disinformation networks to promote
himself
fake news
okay see that's the thing um
someone like me you know who is not for
any of these candidates gets all the
information thrown at him okay
and i've been
receiving information about bongbong
marcos bbm but also lenny robredo uh
using this information you know like
this person said
so you really don't know you know
disinformation networks
uh yes most people are saying that bb
bbm is the one who's using this
technique but i'm also getting uh
information from
people saying that also lenny robredo
has used this technique you know this
information network so i don't know i
don't know who to believe to promote
himself fake news
and trolls
from what i saw also from these videos
is that he is not actually paying these
so-called trolls and he's just
firm believers of bbm that are doing the
the work for him and promoting him
without him actually paying them you
know
so i don't know i don't know if he has a
hand in all of this or not
how could i
support a leader
who never liked attending debates
never like being criticized
well that's the thing uh yeah you could
ask that question about him not
attending debates but the people would
answer you it's because those
um
the people who would ask him the
questions are already biased so he did
not want to waste his time
in those events you know
but i don't agree with the fact that he
did not um
he did not attend any
actually debate maybe i haven't seen him
debate with with other
uh candidates but i did see him being
interviewed by multiple judges
hey i didn't see you there well now that
you're here um why don't you celebrate
uh for making it this far into this
video by subscribing to the channel by
turning on that notification bell so
that you don't miss any future videos
and of course and the most important
thing to like this video because it does
help out the channel tremendously
and now if you don't mind i'm gonna go
back to my business
there are no fears as it is the
beginning of new era a new place for
filipino to arise from prostration and
hope and maybe that is why marcus jr's
call for unity during his campaign has
resonated with a lot of people who are
simply tired with the so-called toxic
division
i fear that the relationships
friendships
that's been broken
by the
elections
we all have our differences we all have
our own principles and beliefs but then
the critics also ask what is the point
of unity under a family name that has
stolen so much from the country
my biggest fear for this election is to
have a president that is themed with
corruption and built by this information
i am genuinely scared to put back into
position
what the people back then ousted to
which marcus supporters you
and those are genuine fears i'm not
gonna belittle you know their uh their
thoughts and their feelings
actually cunter with two things it is
time to forgive what his family did and
that he cannot be judged through his
father's sins
that i agree i don't know but the first
one if you can forgive
what people are claiming that
ferdinand marcos and his wife did but
clearly you cannot judge the son through
his father's sins i mean give the dude a
chance you know what i'm saying
night fun i realized that it doesn't
look good when me a foreigner comments
on other countries affairs
i don't agree with that i think we are
all free to
speak our minds as long as we do it
respectfully
and do uh
prior research and even if we don't do
the research
we can still say what we think by also
taking a step back you know and not
uh being too
uh upfront with what we say you just
have to say things
in a manner that doesn't uh hurt you
know people that are concerned with this
situation and in my case for example i
never take a stand i just tell you what
i see from the video i would firmly take
a stand if i actually lived in the
philippines and if i were a filipino and
if i were impacted by this big decision
you know what i mean
we all know because it's politics there
are many more complicated issues that
this video has not even touched yet
rampant fake news disinformation some
reports of election irregularities to
name a few
if you ask me how i feel so is that true
what he he just showed us that blurry
video of cubs tearing up ballots it
could be anything
for the country that has become such a
big part of my mission
here is what i know to be true i know
that filipinos deserve so much from
their government i know that the poor
and the underrepresented demand a public
servant who truly cares about their
needs in jobs
health and education and i know that
every voter only wants best for their
nation
and as i know all of this i must tell
you something that is very
sad disappointing and difficult
i have been contacted by many people
from the philippines and i can see how
many are
so afraid to even voice their opinions
that is why we have blurred the faces
i mean i have been contacted by a lot of
filipinos who want me to do
research before saying anything
and who want me to
not talk about just one candidate you
know to be interested in
you know the most uh
qualified candidate so in this case it
was mostly bbm and then robredo
and i also reacted to um
you know pacquiao's interview with
tonita with tony gonzaga sorry
um but i did not feel like filipinos
were afraid to speak their minds you
know
i felt like maybe they were concerned
about their country if one or the other
candidates win but i honestly did not
feel like they were afraid to speak
their mind on the contrary you know they
were very upfront and they were like no
this is what i think this is what i
think
that's why i'm a little surprised that
they blurred uh that he blurred their
faces here because in my previous
reaction video
you know they were interviewing people
in the streets they did not blur their
faces and they spoke their minds about
what they wanted from the presidential
election right so
of the he i think he just likes to make
his videos very dramatic you know
people who speak in this video because
the hate is so strong because the
division is so strong because the trolls
are so strong some people are even
worried for their lives
simply for expressing their opinions i
have said it
it could be true but that's not what i
gather from uh you guys you know when
you contact me either
you know on facebook or instagram or
even in the comment section honestly my
comment section i'm very impressed very
very impressed by the state of my
comment section under my uh you know
reaction videos of uh political uh
political landscape in the philippines
you know and even some of you told me
that they were respectful you know the
comment section was respectful but also
very entertaining because you guys have
obviously a lot to say about it but i
did not see any animosity i did not see
hate i did not see
maybe a little bit of anger you know but
honestly that's not what i'm getting
from uh from you guys i don't know maybe
he is
he his experience is different i don't
know
before and i'll say it again the
philippines is a beautiful nation that
deserves all the blessings of this world
[Applause]
that is why only recently our project
not for organization helped raise funds
after the typhoon that hit the filipinos
over 20 000 affected people received
help from it
[Applause]
that's beautiful if that's true kudos to
you man
[Applause]
that's great in that moment in these big
numbers we saw a beautiful unity and we
hope that this type of unity will
prevail no matter what so that when the
next elections happen no one is scared
for their lives in expressing their
opinions
about the future
of their country
okay
okay okay so guys i honestly don't know
why he deleted this video deleted this
video from his uh from his channel
because like he said at the beginning he
did not really proclaim
his thoughts on on the matter he just
said that the philippines deserves
uh all the best you know everything
that's good you know they deserved the
right president you know the most
qualified president but he didn't really
tell you who he was for or whatever he
didn't really give his opinion so i
don't see why
uh he deleted this video deleted this
video
i think
uh bbm support and supporters came at
him because this video was
wasn't pro leni robredo because they
didn't even mention loneliness
they just showed a sea of pink
and if you know what's going on in the
philippines you would know that those
are the supporters of lenny roberto
and he also you know he this video is a
little bit against bbm because he
mentioned ferdinand as being a dictator
uh he mentioned the trolls and the the
the disinformation networks and all that
related apparently to bbm so i can see
why bbm uh fanatics
and supporters would you know come at
him
um but i just don't think he should have
deleted this video you gotta stand
behind your content man
um
on my channel i do not remember deleting
any video even after receiving so much
hate the only thing that
i reserve the right for myself to do is
to
uh
basically delete negative like and
insulting comments you know that's it
but the the video will remain
that's it i may have deleted one video
because someone requested me to delete
it but it had nothing to do with
politics it was basically because
i was saying that
uh i think morissette amon created a
song
but she didn't it was actually uh regine
velasquez's song but i didn't know that
you know so i guess i was like fine i
can delete that video it's not a big
deal
but i think that was the only video that
i deleted
um
but yeah the
i think i think why people also
you know disliked this video
and
may be fed up with his videos it's more
because of his style
you know the the
these videos that are
edited this
this way you know this this dramatic way
the music the way he pronounces things
and he clearly puts a lot of thoughts
behind it you know he doesn't
press record like me and just speaks to
you guys candidly you know i can hear it
from the audio how he
uh carefully reads the sentences and
tries to put a lot of emphasis and
dramatizes a little bit the way he
speaks so that it has more impact and
and on top of that he puts the dramatic
music it just drives me nuts seriously
and also
uh
you know because these
the the the vertical format has gone so
has become so uh you know important in
social media like tik tok like instagram
like even youtube shorts now he's making
videos in this vertical format so that
uh he can like chop up his video and
make them into short videos so that they
can go viral and all that so clearly
project well to me to me at least i i
don't know what his goal is okay
but he is businessman first to me that's
what i feel like he's a businessman who
apparently also uses his skills you know
and the money that he gets from his
videos to help filipinos which is
awesome and i love that
you know but i feel like he his mindset
is business first and that's what i
don't necessarily like with not just
project nightfall but a lot of youtubers
out there when in my case i'm always
just trying to
first of all have fun with my videos and
i like that uh human components to my
videos where i don't just chop chop chop
edit edit edit edit you know where i
just speak to the camera like that
and i'm not gonna
sit here and lie to you and say no i
don't care about the money no of course
i care the money that's how i pay my
bills you know but that definitely does
not come first it's the enjoyment it's
that just
just talking to you guys like talking to
you guys you know on instagram and in
the comment section
is like second to everything you know i
love going in the comment section uh and
reading you guys as a matter of fact
let's go into his comment section and uh
and see what people say i'll read the
you know the first comments
don't listen to the hate they will
always be mad at you for stating the
truth so i'm guessing this guy is a
pro
narcic project nightfall okay he's he's
happy with what he said
all i can say god bless your career okay
uh all he can boast about is nothing
except from the privilege that he is a
son of the former president marcos
nothing more salutes to nightfall
projects for making a content out of it
even though filipinos who voted for this
person are already throwing hate at him
okay so these people are pro
project nightfall
all i can say is this dude earns so much
money by making pinoy content
oh my
nice take except his supporters to bully
you for expressing your opinion and
being unbiased because they have this
uncertainty
to their chosen leader that's why they
don't like to see the other side but
that's the thing i don't feel like he
even expressed his opinion
he didn't
um
project nightfall next time please do
deep research interview our elders our
grandmothers and grandfathers who
experience martial love themselves don't
make interview
uh to the new generation teenager it's
true man i've noticed that i've noticed
that the people he was interviewing were
all youngins
uh this is so real reality bites i've
long stopped watching project
nightfall's videos full of toxicity
uh well i i wouldn't know because i
don't watch his videos but i do feel
some type of
uh what do you call it
you know there is a an overload of
positivity sometimes so that could also
be toxic
full of toxicity stress and fright slash
scary factors this one crossed the line
shame on him
if he were residing here in the
philippines then he'd almost be
certainly deported from making such
hurtful and unfair remarks shame on upnf
okay so according to this guy he does
not live in the philippines but
i think he lives close by
um
in my opinion the only thing why project
nightfall received so much backlash on
this was because usually when he makes
videos he tends to dig deeper about the
information to understand it better and
spread awareness
not just believe and conclude his
opinions after only interviewing
filipino citizens plus it only cited
most with the bad responses it's his
negligence
i don't think in this case he could have
done more research i mean there is
research to be done tons of it actually
but in the end i don't think that you
will come out
with a clear mind you know you you're
not gonna come out being like oh
ferdinand marcos was a dictator so his
son should not be president you know or
leni robredo should be the next
president i i really don't think it's
black or white i really think it's a
gray area and that's why people are in
limbo in a way you know they're very
uncertain about what's gonna happen if
bbm uh becomes president and apparently
he will become president so i don't know
oh my gosh i've been speaking for 27
minutes this is too long um
hopefully this video was helpful with
you guys as you know uh at the end of
each of my titles i always say honest
reaction i am actually not afraid
uh to speak my mind
um
yeah
yeah but uh it's you know during these
uh political political times in the
philippines i just i'm not filipino i
may be filipino by heart but i'm not
filipino and i cannot uh
you know vote so it doesn't really
matter what i think really when what
matters is what you think i can only
give you
uh my opinion about how i felt
uh watching interviews of all these
candidates you know and you know
documentaries and just stuff about them
but you have to be very careful
uh while
uh you know researching just
you cannot believe everything there you
go
let me know in the comment section below
your thoughts on this um please as usual
um be respectful in the comment section
uh yeah just think about the people who
are going to read you behind
we want the uh mgn community to
be presentable you know have a good
image so please be respectful
