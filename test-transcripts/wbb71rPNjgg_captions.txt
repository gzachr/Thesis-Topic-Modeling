then joined me for a
workout session at the gym yeah and we
thought we were going to do a
home vlog today just as mike said to
bring you up to date
with our life because we haven't shared
that much lately because we're all out
and about
and i saw some comments of people saying
where is peanut what happened to peanut
i haven't seen it in a while
what's going on so it's all gorgeous
just
she's not in monday moves yeah she's a
very vocal cat but she loves to be
picked up she just
meows all the time so yeah a very vocal
cat
yeah so i'm just going to make us some
breakfast and then we're going to
start into the day and i am
kind of very motivated to work out and
do sport and go for runs because
i desperately want to get into the best
shape
of my life for our wedding because
nellie and i are getting married here in
the philippines we
talked about it in a recent vlog it was
actually our valentine's vlog where we
kind of announced that we're getting
married in the philippines and today
we also want to talk about our dream
wedding in the philippines and what it
would look like and
from the way things are developing it
looks like it really
is going to be a fairytale wedding
more about that later you chipped chanel
you stubbed your toe you lost your phone
life's a rolling stone on a broken
roller coaster
scream [ __ ] move on throw your hands and
move on it's all good
today is your day time is filled with
swift transition put yourself in good
position if you want
things can go your way ain't no time to
smell the roses gotta get to where the
goat is the world's already been paid
okay guys we definitely took our time
to vlog today because between
breakfast and now it's sunset
yeah it's been a little bit uh well we
only started the vlog at like
one o'clock yeah because we had later we
do intermittent fasting so we had late
breakfast yeah
working out and getting yeah yeah and
definitely something that i will
miss about this condo is the sunset view
that's something that just fills the
room
with this golden light as you can see
here
it's absolutely beautiful and then we
have the view of
manila bay and the reflection of the sea
which is
absolutely stunning so yeah but we have
a different
different sense of view now yeah well
different soon
anyways so i know it's it's mostly me
talking
about how things should look like for
the wedding but what about you
oh so yeah we were just talking about
what would our dream wedding be like
and i think we both really really would
love
some sort of a beach wedding yeah i mean
there's so many amazing spots
in in the philippines there's a lot of
amazing spots around manila that would
be lovely
but like if i'd have to if something
would pop into my head what would be
like my dream situation i think like
beach
yeah plus if we consider bringing our
family here
um we would definitely want them to be
by the beach because in austria we don't
really have a beach
and traveling is restricted in europe
right now
and the beaches that we have in europe
are not the same kind of beach
yeah um it's a completely different vibe
it's more tropical here you have
the palm trees and beautiful white sand
beaches with turquoise water
um so in europe it's a different kind of
beach
so we'd really love to have a for
everybody to have that
really amazing um opportunity to
see one of the best beaches in the world
while they are at our wedding and maybe
spend some extra time there to
you know have a little vacation yeah one
thing we have to say
is we have been completely completely
overwhelmed by
filipino kindness since announcing that
we want to have our wedding here in the
philippines i mean it has been
just we've been getting so many messages
so many emails
of people offering to help us with our
wedding it's it's crazy i
i this is truly going to be like a
fairytale wedding because it's going to
be so
nice and um starting from like
planning to photography videography
the the groom's suit and the
wedding dress yeah so it's so it's
impeccable
to kind of have
community who is so talented and so
giving where we had people designers for
example
uh reaching out to us saying
we would really i would really love to
design your dress and one of those
designers was
actually um the designer who designed
the miss world
philippines dress for our friend
michelle d uh
in that golden dress which looked
absolutely stunning and i was just like
what absolute what i felt so honored and
so
special and also like a celebrity
designer reached out and said he wants
to do
my groom suit yeah i feel so honored i
mean yeah
so oh my god i i have to show a few
inspires with you guys
but first of all yes
you would love to have peanut as our
flower girl
[Laughter]
do you think we can make it happen uh i
think she will run off into
the sunset with our rings
oh peanuts
i'm sure you will enjoy being the flower
girl yeah it's just
absolutely insane yeah it doesn't really
wait a second currently uh
george lucy and melinda are sending each
other sunset pictures
they're sending us what it looks like
they got a rainbow right now and we said
wow
beautiful sunset yeah but i mean
you can't really see it on camera yes
you can see it
yeah i know but it's it's just like with
this lens
the sun looks so tiny yeah but in
reality the sun is like
i don't know in reality it's this huge
bowl of flaming helium millions of miles
away from us
and just before nelly corrects me i do i
am very well aware that it is hydrogen
that is flaming
and it's taking four hydrogen atoms to
form helium in
a process called nuclear fission before
i correct you before you correct me you
know i'm such a pro
okay um oh it's your inspo
yeah i got my very own pinterest wall
with inspo
and as you can see it's going to be as
mentioned
a bohemian inspired webbing with lots of
natural tones
i'm not i'm not much of a pink person i
would say i'm more like
earthy colors and that's how i would
like to
have the wedding as well so yeah the
the flowers are going to be something
like this and then the dress
um it's more like you know it's not
glamorous it's
more a little bit playful and a little
bit
flowery um very natural
looking makeup as you can see here
and even um makeup artist reached out
and said
yeah this is something i like very
pretty
i love pink dress mike hates pinterest i
love it
and then as mentioned um i want to have
flowers in my hair like this
and for mike i thought about
a suit like this so since it's a beach
wedding like a bright
colored um thing would be nice
but of course i'll leave it up to you
what you want to wear
yes but i'm just saying it would look
nice
um you know what they say what
happy wife happy life exactly
wow the sky it's it's insane what's
going on lately yeah
it's just it's the crazy sunset season
yeah it always seems to be at a certain
time of year the sunsets just get
inside everything is in this crazy sepia
tone right now
and when the sun sets it just gets
red kind of yellow like
it's yellow secure red all of the colors
we did reaction videos the other day and
they kept staring out of the window
because the sunset was so nice um yeah
so yeah this is this is some kind of the
in sport i also pinned a few
um every practical tips for planning
your wedding during a global pandemic
you know new normal um
really like this kind of dress
and what else yeah what the hell
look at that it's crazy it looks like
i'm sorry said nelly i'm so distracted
but this is like whoa
i'm trying to stick the camera out like
this is literally
this is no color grading this is what it
looks like
nuts wow
okay sorry okay yeah and the
i just realized that my screen is stuck
this is the kind of decoration i was
thinking of
something a little bit more casual and
then with these
colors even like this setting with lots
of
natural elements natural decorations
yeah lovely and i think i i will be able
to find a lot of these
um very talented
suppliers who already reached out to me
so i have to thank you so much for all
the messages i'm truly truly overwhelmed
and i have to sit down
this weekend hopefully or soon to
just put it all together into one list
because for me you know i never put
too much thought into getting married to
be honest
and now until a few weeks ago until a
few weeks ago and now i'm
super super excited about it and i'm so
happy to
plan the day to make it a memorable one
for us and for our family and friends so
yeah exciting times and i'm so confident
and happy that we decided to
get married in the philippines because i
think it's going to be
magical magical it's like
yeah it's going to be great
all right i'm gonna give these guys a
few more sunset shots and then we'll
check in on a few yeah
[Music]
is
[Music]
literally never get bored of sunsets and
sunrises they are always
a special special occasion and
i'm really looking forward to the new
condor because we might not have the
view that we have
here right now but what we do have is a
rooftop
pool yeah ever so often
i wake up very early even before sunrise
even before nelly and here in this
apartment i don't get to see the sunrise
ever
even though i'm awake for when it's
happening it just because you don't see
the sun
it doesn't have the same effect but with
the newer condo i can go to the rooftop
with a cup of coffee
and enjoy the sunrise and the sunset to
the pool and swim
yeah so that's gonna be pretty amazing
yeah and
quick update on the couch situation
because you guys also reached out to us
um the reality is we measured it out we
put the couch upside down and
checked the feet checked the feet and
everything because a lot of you said oh
you can just dismantle
the feet and squeeze it in but
unfortunately it doesn't work that way
because the wood that the plywood that
is
inside the car we checked the outermost
points
of even without the legs is still over
three meters and a lot of you
thought we were talking about getting it
into our condo getting it in is no
problem
it's just literally the the the width of
the living room
is less than the width of the couch so
it just doesn't make sense
um and i think it doesn't also make
sense to
have it all like cut apart and modified
because that was also
one suggestion from you guys that there
are so many um
hello yeah i think also the being that
it would take out the whole width
of the living room it's just too big it
won't it won't fit the
this living room it's kind of more
squared whereas the new one is a little
bit longer
yeah and mike didn't want to give up on
the couch for
quite a few days i wouldn't say just
trying to find ways to squeeze it i mean
it's a new couch and we love the couch
so
if we can make it fit you know why not
make it fit but
if it doesn't work today today we
decided we have to sell it
so the offer stands if you need
this wonderful couch that we have in our
living room
um please reach out to us on instagram
should be available by may yeah it's
available but maybe
um so yeah as you guys can tell we are
quite excited
do you still want to add something or
are we ending i think we can
yeah we can talk further once we have a
few details but
this was the the first sneak peek of the
wedding
preparation yeah and also yeah guys
