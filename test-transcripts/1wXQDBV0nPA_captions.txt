and as you may know
yesterday i reacted to an interview
actually should i say maybe a couple of
interviews
because it was the interview of
mateo but also amanda of them
uh which who is the miss universe
thailand and arabia mateo is miss
universe philippines all right
it was it was a good interview it wasn't
the best because in my opinion
the questions could have been better but
i thought that both
both contestants you know answered
pretty well
uh but today today i have lots of energy
because ramadan is over
you know i can eat whenever i want i can
drink whenever i want so i have a lot of
energy
and i decided to release three videos
for you guys to enjoy
during the course of the weekend yes yes
yes
the first video is you and i
will be discovering the uh national
costume
that matea rabio will be rocking
okay after that video we will react
to a video where you see miss
philippines okay miss universe
philippines with her national costume
miss thailand miss universe thailand
with her costume national costume
and miss universe indonesia with her
national costume i think it's important
that we react to that video as well so
that we can develop
a legit you know a proper opinion and we
can have a nice comparison between
uh you know the the the countries you
know so that we can
uh form a proper opinion and decide who
which one we like best you know what i
mean before we start let me read the
title of this video
it says full video missing crown
ni rabia mateo national costume miss
universe there you go
um but yeah before we start please
consider follow me on instagram
music game news baby and without further
ado
let's get to it
oh okay okay well there you go
like the reveal is instantaneous okay
there is
no uh tension no
buildup to the reveal okay holy so
it's um wings fluffy wings
with the colors of the philippine so you
know red
blue i don't see any white and i see
three stars and that's all right but
where is the sun
wow she does look beautiful
wow yeah look at her she looks like it's
weird it's like
um it's it's a it's a mix between
butterfly and an angel that's how i see
it
believes in miss philippines
she's giving me a feel of uh victoria's
secret models
feels pasha
so obviously they are speaking in
tagalog so i don't understand what
they're saying
wow
okay
wait that was the intro that's it that
was just the intro okay so i guess
they're gonna show us
multiple angles and multiple footage of
of this
[Music]
national costume hey i love the fact
that she's doing this with her hands
like come on
come on hype it up
[Music]
where is the sun okay so the white color
where's the white color is the white
color supposed to be her
not really because in her interview you
know she was
mentioning the fact that she is uh brown
you know brown skinned
so she can't really represent the white
of the of the flag right now
man her heels are so high
oh i just noticed they have different
colors okay one heel
is blue and the other one is red okay to
match the the wings
very nice
oh
she's able to be cute and sexy at the
same time
oh they are comparing her to
who who is this person is she like uh a
previous miss philippines or something
because
the dress looks exactly the same
um minus the the sun
so the crown oh wow
yeah where's the crown it's universe
stage
seriously though where is the crown
it's important to have the crown
do you think there is a reason why she
is not
wearing the the crown that represents
the the sun
is that behind the scenes footage of her
before she went on stage or after she
came back from the stage from her walk
and i know i have a lot of questions
because the person that's speaking is
beginning tagalog so i can understand so
if you would please you know answer my
questions in the comment section
i love how like they slowed the content
followers
she's beautiful there you have it
and i love the fact that some of you
agree with me
that yes she did gain a little bit of
weight you know and it looks better on
her i think
this peeps a national costume
tony rabia just comment below
okay there we have it for the first
video i honestly like
the national costume but
it's not 100 representative of
the national flag you know
look if it doesn't bother you it doesn't
bother me
and if it doesn't cost her points
you know it's all good
she was still beautiful she was still
charming
she was still sexy you know what i'm
saying so
i don't have a problem with it but but
we
only saw rabia's national costume
now if we compare it with the other ones
maybe it will enhance you know
her her look or maybe
it will what is it was it the opposite
of enhance
decrease i don't know but yeah i'm
basically looking for the opposite of
enhance
yeah uh her look okay
now we will go to that video
and compare yes baby but before we go
