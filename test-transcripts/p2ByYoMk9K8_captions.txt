singing is second nature for filipinos
everybody can sing why is everybody
smiling i was like do i have something
in my face everybody's smiling and
people are like hello
kids passing by hi
this toilet and i went in and i'm like
how do
like what do i
how
it is not easy to chop the head of a
chicken traumatized for life the
shocking revelations continue welcome to
part two
of culture shock moments we experience
in the philippines as foreigners yes we
moved to the philippines a few years ago
and we adapted already
but nevertheless we had a few moments
where we were like what is going on here
we don't understand is this for real
and one of those
moments was actually the very first time
we visited quran yes this is number
before that yes if you haven't seen part
one you gotta watch part one as well
put pop up right here
yeah
i know there will also be at the end of
this video okay so yes uh come on first
time we came to the philippines was on
coron island uh we saw some beautiful
islands they wanted to do some island
hopping and we came straight out of the
hotel and were like what is going on why
is everybody so friendly
smiling i was like do i have something
in my face everybody's smiling and
people are like hello
kids passing by hi
so we're like wow that's
so that's so friendly so unique then we
went on to the island hopping boat and
all of a sudden the other people on the
boat started singing and they were so
joyful and i was like what is going on
like is there somewhere a hidden camera
um yeah that was a culture shock moment
for us because coming from a country
like austria
people are very much reserved
barely ever share smile with you yeah
it's more the angry look or the
skeptical look and then another
experience also in koran was we were
asked for directions
and the guy was like yeah come with me
oh wait that's the next point oh that's
the next point
okay okay next point is going the extra
mile to helping out without expecting
anything in return so as i said uh this
person was we asked for directions and i
would expect the austrian way which is
just go there
yeah or like i don't have it yeah so
it wouldn't be there like go this like
over there
don't leave me
and this person was like so friendly
he's like oh where you from come with me
i'll show you
and from from like a lot of travels that
we've done in the past
we assumed oh this is somebody just
looking for money because it happens a
lot a lot of countries you travel to
um people will carry your bags do thus
do that and then they'll ask for money
so we assume that this is what's going
on but it's not
the philippines people just really want
to see where's he
bringing us to maybe this is one of
those tourist traps you know where they
bring you to the store and then maybe
buy something
but it was the complete opposite and for
us it was such an eye-opening moment and
we kind of
learned in that moment that
kindness is a huge thing here in the
philippines so
um yeah fun experience and sometimes you
just have to let go and trust
okay next one
are you excited for the next one i don't
know what it is
okay so here in the philippines there is
barely any toilet paper
at toilets but you have one thing which
is the table
yes or the
what do we have here the day the bidet
yeah so
i was like travel what am i i'm gonna do
with the table the bidet i used to be
there yeah but when you're in the
province or island hobbies yeah in the
islands um you usually use the table
there is no toilet paper usually so yeah
that was one of those i can remember
also in koran we were on island and
nature called
and there was just this mike had a
moment this toilet and i
i went in and i'm like
how do
like what do i
how
uh here's a here's a suggestion always
carry some toilet paper with you if you
need it um but yeah
for
your
everything
business at the toilet showering like i
did on um
in on the el nido island hopping uh it's
quite an experience and i think you know
during this pandemic there has been a
shortage on toilet paper and we will
likely not be affected but by that
because we have learned to use a pda
exactly i installed bidets here now in
our apartment and i figured out a way to
install it to the water heater so we
have warm water in the day
luxury
a few days ago we received something in
the mailbox that we got really really
excited about and
it's our toothbrush we're so excited to
work with a brand that has the best
electric toothbrushes which is
fossil
maybe you guys realize but this year
mike and i practice a lot of self-care
and self-care is also hygiene and your
daily habits that you have one of those
daily habits is brushing your teeth and
we decided to have some really elegant
and fleek design this time not any funky
looking toothbrushes we really wanted
toothbrushes that are effective and
remove all the nasty things in your
mouth i know there are a lot of electric
toothbrushes out there on the market but
i want to tell you why i fell in love
with fozo since using it first of all i
love the design it's super elegant and
really beautiful you can remove more
plug than with manual toothbrushes the
sonic power delivers a gentle yet
effective clean and has 42 000 motions
per minute so this toothbrush has four
cleaning modes clean white gum care and
polish and it has three intensity
settings from low medium and high
we also got two brush heads without
tooth brushes
and it has 180 day battery life which is
incredible because i remember i had a
different brand and i had to charge it i
think every few weeks so if you want to
get the same models that we got i will
link all the details down below and
thank you for sponsoring today's video
and now back to the blog
okay next one oh yeah we had that in
another video strangers will invite you
to food and drinks yes and this is this
is not just you know it's not just a
simple invitation people will go like
the extra mile i can remember well it's
one of my favorite moments which was in
negros when we were invited people just
casually hey just uh come for dinner
come for dinner okay okay we met this
guy german guy at a coffee shop um and
they're like what are you doing here and
we were just like we're visiting and
he's like do you want to hang out
tonight and we're like okay so we came
back we were literally rushing from apo
island back to
um i set up the world record for driving
time from dumaguete to barcode yeah and
we went there and they prepared a whole
feast for us yeah big lechon
on the table specialties it is one of my
favorite videos you have to check that
out after this video we'll link it here
it'll pop up right
there damn it wait
it'll pop up it'll pop up watch it it's
like we had like
the most amazing uh food from
yeah these are sweet and we felt so bad
because we were already late because our
tour was late to operate was dinner but
it was waiting for us and arriving there
and seeing what they prepared for us was
a very very humbling experience for us
just to invite somebody over that you
just met at a coffee shop and prepare
this whole feast was incredible and
that's not the only time that it
happened i remember it happening in
mindanao sorry mindoro where we you know
just went to the beach met the viewer
and he's like come and eat with us
tonight and he prepared this poodle
fight for us and our friends which was
incredible and then also another viewer
reached out to us abby
uh when we did the making it juicy on
the road road trip and she said i have a
friend in date uh you can stay at his
place and he will take care of you and
we literally just went there not knowing
who this person was who sent us an email
and also not knowing who the person is
that we're driving but we just
we just stayed with them for a few days
and it was amazing and they became
literally our filipino family here and
also there we had one of the most
amazing experiences we've ever had in
the philippines which was callaghwas
island yeah
very very incredible vlog we're so proud
of that video will also pop up yeah
it's always confusing for youtubers
because it's oh it's mirrored yeah okay
we're halfway there okay let's take a
second and you have been enjoying this
video so far give it a thumbs up
and subscribe it's free i guarantee our
content is free for you guys you will
just get a notification on your phone
that we uploaded a new video that's it
lots of fun content here in the channel
okay let's continue
oh my goodness culture shock moments
loud music at malls in shops and
everywhere
and there's like random karaoke
going on at full volume yeah and i
remember
like so many trips where we would just
literally stand next to the road and
then a tricycle will pass by
[Music]
yeah it's so fun um sometimes it's a lot
sometimes when you're grocery shopping
and it's super loud and you feel like
you're in a disco it's uh overwhelming
but it's fun it's it's kind of you walk
into some place and then they play loud
music and you feel good
a big culture shock moment because in
austria we barely ever have that it's
illegal
like everything it's illegal
okay another culture shock moment was
the huge portions of meals here
yeah yeah so we would order a soup just
literally a soup
and it will
like we would get a bowl
like this it's like it's like for 10
people yeah it's for sharing so the
whole food concept here is all about
sharing the food that is on the table
you order you order soup in austria you
get like yeah like tiny little
here in the philippines it's yeah it's
uh family is a big thing here and
sharing a meal with you know your family
your friends is also very big so yeah
all portions are usually huge if you
order rice you get a mountain of rice
and it was very confusing because the
prices are so much lower than what we
were used to in the west so you'd say
well the soup is only like 300 pesos
it's gonna be like small soup then they
bring out like boatload of soup yeah
good soup it's a
oh yeah okay culture shock moment and i
already mentioned that when you go to a
market and i i'm talking about the wet
market it can be
a shocking
experience if you're not used to it i
remember that time when we were in bohol
with our friend pierre friends pierre
and trina and we visited the market and
they had some meat freshly cut meat and
like all the things and
it's kind of
it's a lot it's a lot when you're not
used to it because you must imagine we
come from austria we go to a supermarket
you have everything nicely wrapped up um
you just go there take your
meat and you go home and some some
markets you'll you'll go there like do
you have chicken yeah yeah absolutely
and you're just like
just traumatized for life
like
can i put this head back on the chicken
you're good buddy you good buddy
but no jokes aside um i prefer it that
way now than the other cook
i'm trapped
remember the time i had to chop the head
of the chicken for us
because we bought the chicken at the
market and it was just a chicken then we
unwrap it and it's a whole chicken with
the head like
we took it out of the bag and the head
just flops out
it is not easy to chop the head of a
chicken it is not easy broke my knife
and my spirit it was like the time that
i got traumatized when i saw my cousin's
grandma killing the chicken in front of
my eyes and then later on we had it for
the lunch and i couldn't eat chicken for
a month but yeah now we are pretty much
used to it it's fresh farm fresh oh yeah
okay next one is also a good one so the
social media landscape here the culture
is very well established so you will
literally when you go into the park you
would see groups of people dancing to
tick-tocks and it's normal like nobody
would give you
stupid looks or would say like what are
you doing here
or nothing it's so well accepted and
even like for us as vloggers when we
walk around with a camera nobody is like
so it's very very well established so
here we are accepted we were blogging
we're like what's up guys and blah blah
blah blah and miami would be like hey
what's up guys in australia
[Laughter]
so that's something that i really
appreciate anyway like in in austria
when you say you're a youtuber people
will be like yo what
is that a job yeah
can you make a living on that
last but not least and this is uh
something very very essential for the
philippines singing is second nature for
filipinos everybody can sing and even
those people that can't sing still sing
they sing so good yeah from the heart
from the heart yeah
it's just it's just so fascinating when
you travel through the provinces
every little town has its own karaoke
bar
um and there were always people singing
and it's just so beautiful because
you know it's just something that we are
not used to in austria because
in austria people don't go out and
they're just like all right i'm going to
sing mariah carey today at the
bus
um so yeah that was yeah even like the
experiences that we had with our friends
going to a karaoke bar like uh what is
what was that called
doesn't matter um it was a fun
experience we were even singing filipino
songs
and i also saw
miki bustos posted something like a fun
joke about filipinos singing when they
go to when they're abroad and people say
like ah come on come on sing and they're
like nah nah i'm good i'm good and
they're like no come on can't be that
bad and then they start singing and
everybody's like
a fun video i think i'll i'll just link
it here in the description down below
yeah all right that was it how
fun
yeah they could be like theoretically
we'd have enough to do like parts 10.
yeah i know right yeah you guys let us
know if you want to see another part of
this and if you have your own culture
shock moments that you would like to
share i know a lot of you guys are
watching from abroad and i know a lot of
you guys moved to the philippines as
well so yeah let's see let's share in
the comments down below
and also i mean the the title of this
video might be like you might think oh
we have culture shock moments like what
are they talking about but you know ice
we see it in a positive way we learned
so much in the past few years and we
changed for like girl we have adapted
some very uh nice great traits
that we learned here yeah it's always
good to to get out of your comfort zone
and learn new environments we're also
taking the step we're going to try and
move from the city to the province um so
