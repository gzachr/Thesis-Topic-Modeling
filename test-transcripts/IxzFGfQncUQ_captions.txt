pinoy uh filipino
subscribers out there and there's
there's a video called cancel korea
movement in the philippines a korean
perspective
from jessica lee um i've seen a bunch of
other reaction channels react to it as
well
i don't know really what there is about
it apparently
i assume there's some beef between the
philippines and korea
for some reason i have no clue why i
don't understand what's going on
but i keep seeing this recommended and
you guys commenting about it and talking
to me about it i was like you know we
should give it a watch and see what we
think what's going on figure out
the scenario like what is actually
happening and there's a bunch of videos
to this i think jessica lee's made a few
videos on this um

you guys's help with the support of the

it goes a long way but i'm super i'm
curious man
there's a cancel korea movement in the
philippines um didn't think that like
you know the philippines would do so
many of that so i'm really curious to
see what
she's going to say about the philippines
so yeah let's
see what happens guys
hey guys jessica here this morning i
woke up reading a lot of comments
messages and emails from you guys
requesting me
to share my thoughts about this issue
that arise from the philippine talker
bella porch which sparked a lot of
debate
online and that also led to the
formation of
hashtag cancel korea in the philippines
asking for apology from koreans and also
i guess to raise awareness towards
racial discrimination against the
filipinos when i first heard about this
keyword
cancel korea i was like what
ken soccer it was such an extreme
keyword cancel korea thank you so much
to
those people who enlightened me about
this issue as well to give you a summary
of this
issue it started from the filipina tick
tock star
bella porch and the netizens noticed
that on her
arm there was a tattoo that resembled of
the flag
rising sun i hope you guys all know what
the rising
sun flag is that's a big red flag big
red flag man
not good for koreans because that flag
was
used during the forceful japanese
occupation here in korea
which lasted for about 35 years so that
flag is associated with japanese
imperialism and due to the imperial
japan's
mistreatment during that time of
occupation the flag
can be very offensive for many koreans
that is why we are especially sensitive
about this so i took
a look into her tattoo if it was really
similar to that rising sun flag and i
noticed that it really
reminded me of that flag no wonder why
many koreans were
reacting quite negatively about this i
do understand where they're coming from
so bella has made a public apology
regarding her tattoo
she has said that at that time i didn't
know the history but when i found out i
immediately had it covered and scheduled
for removal
world war ii also guys japan killed a
lot of
philippine filipinos man so i like i
want to double check and look at my
phone
a few more things when it came to japan
in the philippines
but the problem started by how
some korean citizens were attacking not
only this tiktoker bella but
also the filipinos as a whole leaving
comments that are basically
very offensive to filipino people and i
was also very offended by that so i will
read to you guys some of the comments
that i saw poor country non-educated
people
short people the philippines is a slave
state
no wonder you have no too little
education that's why your country will
stay
in the philippines have like the nicest
people ever minded
and this kind of sweetest nicest people
like in the world live in the
philippines unacceptable
any form of racial discrimination is
unacceptable for me
and pretty sure with many of you guys as
well so about this and
to those people who got offended by
these comments of some korean netizens
i would like to apologize from the
bottom of my heart i'm very
sorry for you guys i feel very
uncomfortable because i also grew up in
the philippines for
around the same amount of time that i
was in korea and so
i do feel very sorry for you guys i
would like to apologize
on behalf of those rude korean netizens
so this
issue provoked a lot of filipinos
that movement of hashtag cancel korea
started on twitter and that hashtag
movement only started today but it has
garnered over 200
tweets already i could definitely that's
pretty crazy
anger of these people so some of the
twitter users
are sharing their own experiences about
discrimination
from the koreans so the first tweet
starts with the hashtag
and it says it was 2018 when i last
visited seoul
it was a five-day trip and not a single
day we didn't encounter a rude
korean every night we went back to the
hotel even though we were happy
there's that little sting in my heart in
the heart but sometimes i want to go
back sometimes i don't
next one is i may like your songs your
cultures and i even wanted to study in
korea but i love
my country i'm gonna put my lipstick
down and probably raise my flag
this is the time when i felt like okay i
kind of can see where this is going and
i literally stopped
myself in the third post i saw which is
some koreans saying that filipino are
ugly but look at these queens
do they look ugly i don't think so and
they put some pictures of the filipino
celebrities
so this is the time when it gets a bit
confusing because the whole point of
this movement
is to raise awareness about racial
discrimination that koreans or
any people shouldn't be racist right but
this posed
some crazing that filipino were ugly
well i would say it's a rather
emotional response i don't think
reacting to this situation
emotionally is effective or is the best
thing
it's just an extreme way of expressing
and trying to deliver a message
next one you could also see can somebody
tell me is there a korean who has
crowned as miss universe
miss world or miss international this is
off topic it's not
related to the core of the problem i
mean the idea of a hashtag movement
okay that's like how many things work
nowadays
but when it becomes like this emotional
and just
attacking and not really straight on
point
and it can really just buy more anger
many people
are also mentioning about the war the
korean war where
many filipinos came to korea to fight
for
our side and that is such an honor
i also got comments from some
of the families of those who are
veterans and
yeah that is the reason why i'm also
trying to
really see the positive connections
between korea and the philippines
instead of you know focusing on the
negatives
yeah there's definitely a lot of
connection between the team really
an issue that we can never get rid of
you know starting from the spark of the
chronovirus
where a lot of people around the world
were being racist to
any person that looked chinese followed
by the blm
movement this kind of issue is really an
issue and it's very daunting
to encounter this but one thing that i
would like
you guys to know is that please do not
judge the whole
of korea by these few netizens that you
encountered online
i really do understand how it feels to
be mocked or insulted
because of your race or because of your
nationality
that is why i do understand why these
people who are joining this
movement seem to be expressing their
anger in a very emotional way
and seeing that kind of twitter posts
honestly
is not that new for me because a few
years ago i also uploaded a video
titled racism in the philippines and in
that video i shared about some of the
discriminational
experiences that i got when i was in the
philippines as a young student
and the whole point of that video was
for me
just raising awareness about the issue
of racism and
reducing it as much as possible and
really taking it away in our generation
but a lot of my volcano viewers left
hateful comments full of anger saying
that oh
korea is worse oh you guys koreans are
such a blah blah blah and it was
yeah it was very hurtful for me and i
and that kind of comment is not new for
me because i always get those
constantly and i know it's very hard not
to make any generalizations
from a personal experience that you
encountered but that
can lead to very very dangerous social
issues later on
i know my apology on behalf of those
rude koreans or this video
won't calm your anger and the pain
that you received but i hope that we
could get
through this together with a positive
and
rational manner as much as possible to
really raise awareness
to eventually solve but i still hope you
guys found it informative
and i will see you guys in my next video
bye i might have forwarded a little bit
there i don't know if i did
um on man you know you don't want to see
stuff like that
it's messed up that people are going to
go say things like that about like
another group of people
um i have no time for that type of
negativity
um my channel man positive stuff guys
like i want every like
when i go live or when i post videos i
want the comments to be positive
people can say things about me like you
know what i get that but don't be mean
to other people you know don't throw
hate at anyone and it's like just why be
prejudiced why be racist why say all
these nasty things man
um just because one person might do
something
don't like make the whole like it's like
that one tick tock whatever person
had a tattoo but she wasn't even her she
wasn't doing it you know
in a negative way she didn't know
anything about it and she educated
herself
so right right from the get-go people
should realize like hey like stop
attacking
this one subtitle and then two they all
started attacking philippine the
philippines and the filipino people
based off just one person and it's like
that's
so wrong in so many ways and it's just
so
it's ridiculous man and you're going to
see people do that i'll do live streams
and people say stuff and i i don't agree
with it and guess what i kick him out
if you start attacking people because of
their race religion
anything like that i don't want any time
with you okay you're not like that's
just common sense guys just treat others
how you want to be treated
you know what i mean and it's disgusting
that
people talk and act the way they do
sometimes um
i think there's a lot more good in the
world though than bad and hopefully
you know everyone from this like people
that did say mean things hopefully they
look back they're like wow i shouldn't
have said that
you know if not then you know what i
wouldn't talk to those people and just
don't even give them any attention
if you see someone posting something
that just block them you know what i
mean
um i'm sorry that i mean it's just it's
messed up it's sad
because i have a lot of friends from the
philippines and i respect all you guys
from the philippines
i have a lot of people that i know from
korea and so
from what she showed it didn't show it
seemed like the filipinos people that
are from the philippines were defending
themselves
they weren't attacking koreans but they
were defending themselves
saying like look we are educated we are
beautiful
and so no shame i don't feel bad
everything they said
i'm like all for it because they they
didn't say anything mean back you know
what i mean
and the fact that the philippines even
helped fight the koreans in the war it's
like come on guys like they helped you
out in the korean war and it's like
you'd think from just that alone it'd be
nicer you know there'd be some
camaraderie there you know like
but no so i that really wow i didn't
want sam to watch this video
um i might have her watch it i just i
know it'll make her feel really sad
and for me it just it upsets me you know
you know i don't want to see stuff like
this it's 20 20 guys
treat people right for all my pinoy
filipinos out there keep your heads up
y'all are amazing
nicest people beautiful people just such
great hearts
same people in korea man like everyone's
great
but the stuff i've seen from the
philippines all i've heard is nothing
but positive stuff
i got friends at work over here saying
that you should married in the
philippines like i'll give you a tour
like
nothing but nice things um when it comes
to the philippines
and i don't like seeing stuff like this
i don't like seeing people
say mean things but jessica hats out to
you
i liked the video i'm definitely curious
to see the other video
that she has the sorry the philippines
from the korean video
um but it's just messed up man and it
said that she got made fun of when she
lived in the philippines
you know she shouldn't have to have gone
through that um it's just
not not fair and it
makes my heart sad man it makes me sad
it bums me out it really kills me inside
to see stuff like this happening stuff
around like you know it's just
it's so much easier to be nice to people
and i hope people start to realize that
it's way you feel better to be nice you
know it's just i feel
you feel better you know when you're
mean do you ever enjoy it i would say
no i hate being mean i don't like when
they're like
that side of me comes out i hate seeing
that so i'm sorry to everybody that
is made fun of or hurt i've been there
myself
but this is disgusting you know and i
wish they wouldn't have made a hashtag
cancel korea because it
it never like you know don't ever go
