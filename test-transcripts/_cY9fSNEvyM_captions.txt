and it is the best decision of recent
[Music]
years
it is hard to put in word how amazing it
is to experience
this beautiful weather in manila the
past two or three days
it is so so nice and with sunshine and
blue skies come
phenomenal moods i will say right now we
are in the car on our way to bgc
because uh george and lucy i i texted
george and lucy this morning and said we
have some errands to run bgc showing me
for coffee and george asked me hey
i have to pick something up from the
post office in target could you give us
a ride
and of course it's much safer to sit in
our car which
you know is not a taxi it's not hundreds
of people getting in and out of those
cars just us nelly and i
we're gonna give george and lucy a ride
to first we're gonna have coffee
then we're gonna give them a ride to the
post office where they need to pick
something up
and then we have a few more errands to
run and then back to our home and makati
ah nice day also i'm excited to hang out
with george and lucy for a little bit
you know it was it always helps
to meet friends and have a good laugh i
know george and lucy haven't been on the
vlog
in quite some time but we have met up
with them uh
for dinner and coffee so yeah it's just
good for our souls good for the heart
and soul to
spend time with friends yeah i do have
to agree with mike
the beautiful weather makes it so much
more exciting the good mood is
automatically back
um i know it's rainy season so it can
get really uh cloudy and kind of
dark sometimes and i realized i realized
that when we were at home and it was
really really dark
that i wasn't really that excited but
i'm super happy that we have sunshine
blue skies
and we're meeting jordan lucy which is
also very nice so
exciting day ahead
[Music]
you'd be surprised
[Applause]
[Music]
oh my i'm about to get a sunburn out
here it is so sunny
anyway guys today i wanted to share
something with you guys that has been
making me incredibly happy and it's not
nelly
and it's not peanut although they do
make me incredibly happy
that's not actually what i want to talk
about today it's something that i have
to use
every single day of my life and i spend
a lot of time with it and recently
something has changed that has been so
good for my mental health
and talking of mental health i had a few
days where i was a little bit down
so i decided to reach out to my best
friend
and also to my sister and i just had a
really really long talk i think i was
two and a half hours with my sister
on a facetime call and it felt really
good we were just
basically hanging out and talking about
stuff
[Music]
[Applause]
so thirsty the squad is complete yes the
squad is here
hello
have you got enough got enough waving
this wasn't planned it just happened
how are you guys very well very well
very hot
that's my fault
we've got some iced coffees on the way
today george yes we got
so many comments about you
oh the hair over here
[Music]
we're going to see how long we can get
before we get too fed up and then we
might get trimmed
generations on my back
all the secrets that i keep
got me shackled by my past
i can feel it
[Music]
all right we arrived good luck thank you
see you in two weeks
please don't leave won't be long
hopefully
okay three hours later
and now we wait and now we wait
for however long it takes what thank god
that our post office is
like literally just around yeah it's
just across the road from us and it's
the main
post office building in makati which is
really good yeah so it took us 15 to 20
minutes to get here
luckily no traffic yes very little
traffic
i guess we have to talk now
just say we have because we don't have
anything else to do
[Music]
we can listen to some music yeah let's
put in some music
so by the way guys since we watched chef
for the second time we've been
absolutely in love with the playlist
from the movie
so yeah we listen to those like almost
every day
such a good mood playlist it is but it
makes me want to drink margaritas and
eat nachos
we will link the playlist down below
just in case you need a little
cheer up um it's so nice to just listen
to it it just
it feels like you are somewhere on
vacation how was your very first
postal experience very good smoother
than we thought you know
smoother than we thought would you like
to see what you received
my driving license my which it means i
can drive vehicles
again hopefully soon hopefully soon well
it doesn't mean that you can it means
that you may
it means that i'm mate
so we originally had planned to get some
take-out food at
and bring it home and eat it but being
that we met up with jordan lewis so
we're gonna
grab some lunch together small bite
okay the new normal is when you enter
restaurant you will see
these qr codes
then you have to scan it and you'll have
the menu
so we can all be socially awkward
all on our phone i'm not even looking at
the menu
all right guys this was a nice little uh
yes uh lunch
nice little outing absolutely we got
things done
things sauteed
now we can happily go and quarantine
ourselves again yes
back to the cocoon
okay we need some encouraging words i
just need some words of
motivation just in general just in
general to make it through quarantine
keep going stay positive keep your head
up and make it happen
change that was great times will
[Music]
[Laughter]
okay guys it was very nice hanging out
very nice
i swear we always think about this exact
point i know it's so weird there's the
footage from before yeah same thing
thanks for joining us thank you
appreciate it
see you soon we'll see you very soon
[Music]
yeah hello hello
how's it going
[Music]
sorry we left you alone for so long
and ladies and gentlemen this is the
reason for
mike's happiness oh my god guys
ah i changed i switched away
from apple to windows and
it is the best decision of recent years
this computer here is a ryzen 9
4 800 hs series processor with a gtx
1660 ti and 40 gigabytes
of random access memory 3200 megahertz
this is a beast of a laptop
it is you just sold for that laptop it
is so
blazing i mean it's like scrubbing
through the timeline i got like 4k
footage in here now scrubbing through
the timeline working with slo-mo shots
my friend pierre
sent me 10 bit raw 4k
120 fps files from the brand new sony a7
free to test out
and this computer handles it without
breaking a sweat
for those of you who are not technical
as mike is
that means that this computer is a beast
and he's so happy with that computer
that even i
considered buying a new one for myself
as well because i can't shoot
i can't edit any anything with slo-mo on
my computer so i have to
this car on this one this computer
outspecs
a top-of-the-line 16-inch macbook pro
just a 16-inch macbook pro specs similar
to
reach the similar powers as
it can't it got this is the fastest cpu
processor that it exists right now for
laptops
and it can't outperform it but something
that gets
close to it from apple will cost five
thousand dollars
and this i think it's one thousand five
hundred dollars
so a fraction of a fraction of a
fraction
yeah and it has like these so
so i'm not techy at all but the way that
my mike explained it to me is that this
computer has a processor inside that
comes with
more power but it is
cheaper yes to purchase also you can put
in your own
memory memory you can adjust it to your
liking
stuff is user replaceable here without
avoiding the warranty
which is super awesome and
i mean the the price is so good and it's
just
like apple prides themselves with having
like the best hardware and like clean
design and so on
my macbook pro the usbc plugs
were so weak that it would just
fall out constantly yeah we had lots of
tongles dangling
twice to the side twice it corrupted sd
cards because the sd card really just
fell out
this year look how hard i have to pull
look it's turning the chair
i can't even yeah that's how hard you
have to pull
you have lots of slots here usb this is
by the way not not a sponsored video
it's not a sponsor this is just uh we
have the invoice for this computer
yeah we purchased we purchased it
ourselves
um and where was it the pc express
pc express yeah it's got two usbc it's
got two usb a
3.0 it's got two
different modes of charging one with the
barrel plug which
gives you more performance faster
charging a usb c
plug it's got this included it's got a
mouse included it's it's i am so happy
i'm so happy and the most important part
is mike is in a much better mood
lately because of this computer which is
really nice i
because i have farm i have a lot more
fun editing these vlogs
yeah i was so annoyed with my my macbook
the footage it kept like stopping
the playback it wasn't so much crashing
but it was just lagging
all the time constant lagging
it was constant lagging and that that
was just something that was so hot it
was hard to edit i couldn't edit slow-mo
footage
it was annoying yeah and i saw him
watching a lot a lot of
youtube videos which computer to get
and he came up with this one and it
looks actually really
nice i'm quite surprised i'm i'm a lot
about the
optics uh and this one
looks it's magnesium shell and
everything it's not unibody but
it's great it looks nice no flex on the
keyboard
it's good that's awesome peanut agrees
as well
right yes the only thing
hello peanut say hello
the only thing if ever the only thing
that i'm missing is
that it doesn't have thunderbolt because
it's not an intel processor and
thunderbolt is
exclusively to intel so it takes a
little bit longer to copy my data
from the heart from the sd card to the
hard drive but
like now i just plugged it on i got a
coffee and it was done long before i got
back
and the way it works with mike when he
is completely
convinced about something that he loves
a lot
like me
no um this computer
is one of his favorite things he loves
his
what is it one plus five one plus so you
he switched away from apple he used to
be the biggest biggest apple fan
a few years back but then he got more
and more frustrated because they just
didn't drop the ball peanut you don't
have to
worry about anything huh
by the way guys i got this plant this
fiddle
ambino li uh tree from a viewer
and um there is a new leaf coming in
[Music]
every day
[Music]
i got
[Music]
sometimes it just needs little tweaks in
your life
to make yourself a little bit uh more
overall happy for me is the fact that
the sun is shining again
mike is a very balanced with this new
computer
we reach out to the people that we
love and enjoy hanging out with and
yeah that's sometimes that's all that uh
counts to make yourself feel a little
bit better also fun fact
wearing earrings again so if you
remember i wanted to get my ears pierced
because
um my earrings didn't go through
yesterday i'm going to
uh to go through and i can wear earrings
again makes such a difference
when you have a little bit of extra on
your ears and it's changed a little bit
the appearance
um yeah just small small little things
do you have anything to add for the day
today
uh for the day today um uh no not really
