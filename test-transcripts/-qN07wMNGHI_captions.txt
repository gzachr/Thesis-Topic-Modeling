foreign
[Music]
not the greatest angle of all lighting
but
apparently just we're just chilling at
the moment right there yeah
[Music]
we've got
Marty's crackling
spicy vinegar flavor so I'm gonna snack
on these because I've got a new big
energy that's why I'm having chocolate
for this fast energy and then
crash as well we'll try this for the
Vlog we're going to film everything at
this point
oh yeah that's much better
oh that's using actual lights in this
place I don't think I've tried these
spicy vanilla flavor
these are decent
so basically and then I have a few
meetings about an hour meeting and
basically we've got to get ready and go
to the theater at solve for Martin
Rivera's 4D concert so four decades damn
that's a long time to be doing this
although I don't follow him that closely
from what I've seen with all his
relationships with pretty much every
artist in the Philippines everyone known
artist he's like The Godfather he just
gives off that Vibe like that's the guy
to know we know a guy who can get us
backstage passes production passes
but it wasn't it was until after we were
told that that we found out that regime
was going to be performing tonight so
you know the nightness is just getting
better and better and fingers crossed
this could be the Redemption moment but
we're not going to jinx ourselves not
going to expect it because if you expect
it you're gonna set yourself up for
disappointment
so we're going into this but I thought
that it may happen
but possibly not but I'm feeling pretty
confident right now because everything
seems to be falling into place so this
is the Vlog you guys have been waiting
for hopefully you uh keep it together
I'm putting it out there into existence
I know she's not to expect it but just
don't let your emotions get the better
of you
and we'll try and make sure the quality
the quality is on point
yeah quality was never ever questioned I
think the reason why I got really
emotional the first time was because I
had zero expectations of meeting anybody
it's my first in the Philippines to see
Virginia's concert and the sheer sort of
like
determination from everyone and else
around me like pulling together and
trying to get me that moment with her
and her accepting that that was just
something I've never experienced I think
it was that emotion that got made it was
the The Helpful helpfulness of the
people around me this time there's gonna
be no tears only only happy smiley faces
probably a relief base as well what do
you think
probably finally also your moments with
these artists
spicy is what sparked these Vlogs I'm
like man that's quite a bit routine
Katrina and Morris sit all in what five
days yeah
this is when they were very popular too
they're still popular now but you know
in terms of like reactors I'm getting
like some big crazy views but you know
what I didn't really know you much about
that I understand I was aware of your
I was just like oh this guy's gonna hate
me
I love that I got there first
I know
I bet you love that you have that one up
on me the first one yeah
you know part of me like actually you
know that was my genuine reaction I was
like no I was like I need to get my
together that's what really just pushed
me to go I mean I knew there was a
concert coming out I was like there's no
I can't miss this yeah and look at us
now oh God no like Best Buds and rock
stars maybe I I don't know I'm thinking
a bit too favorably here but I
I think because we were kind of like
some one of The Originals that kind of
did the Filipino reaction stuff and of
course all the fans are trying to get
all the other reactors to come over and
we've done that already I feel like
we've sort of almost ignited the Vlog
side of people as well they're starting
to get to all vlogging stuff because
yeah yeah true
I feel like that now started like we've
almost paved the way for them that's you
know if you're coming here to see them
that's expected that you Vlog
you know I wouldn't mind seeing some
other reactors come over here maybe some
of the ones that go further back they
have been reacting for a long time just
I don't want to say validate their
Channel but it just shows that hey you
weren't just in this for views for views
and stuff like that
saying that just because they come to
the Philippines doesn't mean that's not
what they're still in it for but it
would be nice just to have that you know
I mean pocket you come here a lot a lot
of the times to create content
is to create content for you so you get
to enjoy what we get up to in the
Philippines and meeting the artists and
showing you sort of like a look into it
a little window into their world that's
kind of what I do it not so much like oh
look I've met and you haven't it's like
oh yeah yeah these are the people that
I've been watching for the last five
years six years in fact
I don't know I like sharing what I'm
doing and to an extent we do film it to
other people watch it obviously but more
of it is just because that's what I want
to do yeah and I need to capture it
because there's a lot of stuff that I
captured and I haven't even posted so
it's just just really having it the fact
that it's going to get views people want
to see it as a bonus yeah I mean if we
went on just used alone I probably would
start vlogging a long time ago oh yeah I
started doing travel Vlogs since 2008
before I even had my YouTube channel but
I did that because it was my personal
thing that was like something I could go
back on in the future and these Vlogs
are just an extension of that but also
to share with you guys that's quite a
nice moment I think that was nice yeah I
might even record a reaction or two a
little bit
definitely not today
maybe uh after our music video
I mean like the following day that was a
lovely it's currently pissing down
outside the rivers turned to
Vanessa has just texted me to say that
it's raining cats and dogs so we're
stuck in traffic
oh so we may not see her tonight
we kind of have to really because we're
shooting tomorrow she's 10 across the
invoice I am scared to open it well as
you can see
the buildings have practically
disappeared it's absolutely chucking you
down a lot of the city over there you
can't even see it look at that it's gone
there is nothing to see here guys just
rain rain and more rain so we're
supposed to have a production meeting
anytime now with Vanessa our producer
who's doing the TV show
um she's saying it's raining cats and
dogs so it means she's running late
we've got some commitments later on in
the day and we don't want to be rushing
and have overlap so kind of hoping she
gets here quite soon to discuss all the
arrangements the timings that sort of
thing for tomorrow and she's also sent
through an invoice
which I haven't opened yet I'm very
nervous I'm not
we've kind of discussed costs and we
know how much it's going to be costing
us anyway but just the fact that it's
now like an official document certainly
scares the business at me and just to
clarify obviously they've got it from
your explanation but this is all
financed by us two alone yeah it's a
South Finance project so I open the
invoice go for a minute
[Music]
oh my God that's a big document oh
scary to look at Chase all right so it's
invoice to me because it's going through
my business account it's more
professional it looks better that way
yeah
so ah there's an extra little fee what's
that for Bank fees uh okay
when you make international transactions
there's usually a little extra on top
you've got to pay because it's an
international conversation this isn't
the total low is it this is the services
for the crew so yeah yeah it's a crew
invoice so it's pretty bang on what we
expected so you've got the producer
um and the prep to shoot for her role
we've got two camera operators see the
cheese put Sony A7 S3 we she told me two
black magic cameras
either way it doesn't really matter
we're getting two crew so there's the
production coordinator
[Music]
uh production Vans we've got van hire
because you know we've got to get places
uh a cash float
which I think is just for like
miscellaneous odds and souls type thing
and back these
give us a total all looks pretty good so
we are on track yeah and I'm excited
we've got a celebrity chef we've got a
celebrity Tick Tock star
thing I think it is a thing in this
generation so yeah um so we've got two
great people attached to the project
um we've got a family that we're gonna
work with and spend time with and have
some Cara Yogi with
I didn't think of a song too I wanna
sing my heart out after a few beers I
did get some of that a deep heartache
which is out of my system
that's definitely on the list I think
that's it isn't it that's really the
main bulk of the show you know a few
days ago we were just kind of stressing
out we're in short of what was confirmed
and what wasn't yeah but now that
everything's pretty much in stone yeah
we're good to go yeah I think I even got
to Singapore so I was already I would
say half my hair but I was pretty much
here we didn't have any of that
confirmed we didn't even know if we
definitely filmed it tomorrow
who knows buddy you use juicing out in
Singapore and while that was happening I
was just drinking my life away I said I
can't deal with this right now but
we're we're in really good space and
really all we need to focus on now
leading up to that
it's just getting a few hours sleep yeah
I'm gonna make sure we get some rest
otherwise we're going to be on those
energy drinks for the next two days yeah
we've got a 4 a.m call time so we need
to be up earlier than that and then we
also have a late night tonight we can
make it work I can I can function on
four hours you know I almost tempted to
do if we get to meet the artists before
the concert it doesn't matter if we
leave early it does it doesn't
attempt to Mr finale but we've kind of
done and we don't know and we're not
that we're not that cameras so
say that we only do it too
I don't know
for the tickets either so we're not
losing anything and we don't know if
we're going to get recognized here so we
may get stopped it's just like a
possibility of like time yeah dragging
over yeah but ideally yeah and early
night and then we got a nice
say dies early start tomorrow it's an
ungodly hour but it is what it is but
you you got to sacrifice yourself for a
few days for a TV show the main focus
really for us is just to get the content
like be ourselves be ourselves and just
we just have to trust the people around
us to do their best we just have to give
them the content to film which is
different for us because we're usually
doing everything yeah I'm so used to
being in control of everything we want
everything to go absolutely perfect
so putting that trust in other people is
also I wouldn't say a stress but
at lingering at the back of my site did
you get the right angles is the audio
good see never you know what I mean the
difference is that these guys are
working professionals that's true yeah
already for me I am going to think about
the audio now or think about the camera
angles I can just say okay this is what
you want to try and capture like we meet
the chef we want to get like mid shots
of visible chatting to each other then
close-ups of us actually doing the
things and a lot of it's a pretty pretty
standard like they used to shooting Live
Events so this is new for me basically
yeah pretty much I'm used to you like if
you need like only something filmed and
you're there like I don't have to worry
about you so you're probably as close as
it's come to me doing this sort of thing
yeah it's different if you were to
interest say a friend like another
friend of your friend that's how do I
record yeah that type of bread yeah oh
God I had that moment as lovely areas as
you are they
um it was quite nerve wracking at the
wish Awards giving you my camera to that
responsibility of having my camera to
film is on the stage did a great job but
you you do worry what you're going to
yeah where you don't know what someone's
okay like you've never used the camera
before I mean
you don't know we're going to get it I
don't think it's a huge problem but yes
it's a pilot and it's gonna be our first
episode
we want to make sure it's going to be
the best that it can be so we've just
kind of thought screw it let's get an
audio recordists and uh they can they
can work out all that kind of stuff how
are you feeling right now Dan
um tired very very tired I'm trying to
like I'm like glue
trying to hold it together trying to
hold it together all those pieces of me
and I'm just a little bit nervous about
going to the concert tonight and the
hour we get back is making me nervous
yeah
based on the little sleep I got
last night this morning which is
self-inflicted
as long as I get three I can live on
three I've been to work on literally
Thursday I went to work on an hour and a
half sleep
so I don't know how you do it I know
almost actually dying at work I was like
this is my last day I I should have just
taken the day off I've forced myself to
go because I didn't want to hear it when
I get back so
then what you don't want to do is so
little sleep that you're so tired the
next day that you just look miserable
I've been constantly tired this whole
week it's like constantly dragging over
so I don't know how bug should you write
out but I'm here uh
but other than that
I have no idea how weird in editing
these Vlogs or putting them together
but we do what we do normally do is just
wink it just wing it you know there you
go that could be the next tattoo just
wing it yeah just skip matching tattoos
then rock star man I don't even send
over the font so you can get the exact
[Laughter]
because I'm just thirsty you know well
they said help but this is like I don't
know
no but I've been just thirsty since I've
woken up that was good that was just to
fill the Gap what was Johnny again I
mean it filled it but you know it felt a
different Gap
does this remind you of something then
this exactly you know it's enough to
populate Mars
oh it is as well yeah the coconut water
I always look at that so much this would
be a great award like I feel like I'm a
speech thanking all my
true followers or supporting my music
video is going to be releasing next year
yeah Maura shade version three
almost did that too I'm so glad I didn't
that would have just been Overkill yeah
so the song was titled closer featuring
Maria The rubbo Who sounds amazing on
the side should have sound incredible
actually I was actually listening to it
on the plane it was getting me excited
because it was night time I was like man
this even like a plain sort of vibe I
was like man it's like closer the song
is called closer and I'm getting closer
to the Philippines I'm getting closer to
oh potentially future partner and future
mother of my children
that's how I looked at it I'm excited to
shoot the music video we've got
your friend that you met in the UK it
goes by the name of John how do you
pronounce his last name gorillas
and we've also got a female Talent who's
going to be playing the role opposite me
would you just look at the next video
then please because you know they'll
watch one video and then they won't
watch the wrist so that's true come on
guys stick with us you know we we
deliver on content like no other person
does we we here
we wish you other reactors are they here
are they here
I don't see anybody to see anyone else
so that's not a dick that's just an
observation
that thank you for supporting the videos
all right
