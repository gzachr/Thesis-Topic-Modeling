yes of course welcome everybody back to
the channel welcome back to the live
stream I hope now the audio is better
there wasn't
back in the first uh attempt where we
were basically hearing back the
evolution we were hearing the live
stream on the phone bar within the live
stream so hopefully that now is solved
um
no this is incorrect
anyway just checking in is everybody
hearing us okay is everything well if
you're new to this stream today we are
actually cooking bicol Express together
which is one of my favorite Filipino
dishes
that's not true that is not true there's
many Filipino dishes that I'm not the
biggest fan of
um but Bitcoin Express definitely is one
that I'm a big fan of
22.
so usually when I say it is one of my
favorite Filipino dishes it's because we
are talking about the Silicon lechon
Express but I wouldn't say like
caldereta or Calipari is one of my
favorite Filipino dishes
I have no idea what it's about but look
I can see you are blasting along with
the cooking already so what do you how
what is the process of making a
traditional be called Express or your
version of it yeah I don't think it's a
traditional vehicle Express just like
what I do with silica and how I fry the
meat first before adding the rest of the
ingredients before sauteing the garlic
ah sorry the onion and the Tomato
together with seasick with seasick with
a little Express I also
fry and sear the pork first and then
afterwards else the onion and the garlic
and the ginger and the chilies together
and let it simmer let the meat simmer in
um
what they call this look at that uh
coconut cream yeah coconut cream
it's so difficult to just keep speaking
in
I don't know if yeah well you know live
streaming it is really really much
easier it takes a little bit getting
used to but yeah I want to hear from you
guys in the chat like where are you
watching today's live stream from where
are you located either inside the
Philippines or outside of the
Philippines uh for those that are maybe
you around here we're located in BGC per
gig in Metro Manila and whoever is close
to believe me if you're hungry come by
for some vehicle Express free tasting if
you want to try
so yeah um the first time I had Bitcoin
Express when was that actually quite
quite a long time ago I think it was on
the second or third trip to the
Philippines that I got to try to be
called the express the first time yeah
and I think it was oh I remember I had
it in public Sean it was with my friend
Robert he took me out to some uh some
traditional Filipino food in publish
home and yeah that's where I got to try
Beacon Express the first time but
obviously not not to compare with the
Bitcoin Express from the vehicle region
itself
yeah but why why
you educated me recently yesterday it
was called Biko Express it's not because
it was yes correct actually I believe
because Express comes from Pampanga and
it was made to eat on the train going to
the Biko region please correct me in the
comments if I'm wrong I do not want to
be spreading like uh misinformation
hello hello can everybody hear us good
is the audio nice now does it work let
me just do a quick test
oh yeah audio is good fine I I had such
I had a heart attack early on because it
wasn't working especially because
there's a whole intro part of it and
then the audio was bad now what can I
help you with
like me to mix you a drink I feel bad
because I'm here enjoying myself yeah I
think it's something you can do it yes
what beverage would you like
uh what about the one you made
uh the one I had last night which would
be a Blackberry or actually you can make
a whiskey sour we have eggs now yes
whiskey sour coming right up
so in today's show we have um fruit and
Cocktails at the same time so quite nice
well that's how the tower dual usually
is by the way the rice is in the rice
cooker
cooker rice cooker rice cooker
um and that usually this is how it is
right like I would cook I would do the
rice and everything
meanwhile you'll eat some drinks yes
I'll mix this up a drink or pick the
movie or
what do you guys usually do on a
Saturday I used to always go out on a
Saturday just because it's you know the
weekend and and it's more fun
you tried you guys got dropped
that's scary
oh we're having more technical
difficulties today let me just fix this
up real quick
all right
well I apologize for dropping you uh
that's weird
that was
yes everything is charged oh my God I'm
telling you guys it is not easy to do a
live stream sometimes you uh things
happen that you wouldn't expect
sounds like a tight logo YouTube video
so anyway let me know in the chat right
now what are your favorite cocktails
what you like to pair it up so actually
you just asked about what they like to
do on a Saturday yeah yeah what do what
do most people do on their Saturday
night well I wonder because I used to
just go out a lot actually I would do I
used to go out here in BGC or Makati or
something you know drink and and what is
that what does mama mean
ah foreign
by the way guys I'm using this lovely
bottle of whiskey that my brother gifted
me when he came to the Philippines the
last time really nice place nicely with
the acidity
and what's your Ula for tonight
oh yeah what what are you guys having to
eat have you eaten I just saw comments
saying that
uh she just cooked we could express as
well earlier oh nice yeah
this is
it used to be like one of the things one
of the dishes that I would cook
regularly just because it's so easy and
so it's good yeah
at some point was super expensive
yes yes uh we figured out today that
um
more SM grocery store yeah awesome the
SM means the SM store is actually quite
inexpensive in comparison to uh the
other schools here in BGC so I think we
brought in quite a lot of food also for
next week and we kept around 4 000 pesos
yeah 4 500 Pesos in it it's it's always
like that because I'm like if you look
at this
if you look at this set of like the
entire bundle of chili yeah in Landmark
this would cost like 80 pesos this is
20. 20 pesos yeah yeah it's quite good
so
cheaper
yeah let me know where do you like to
get your groceries and I would say like
SM is much more local yeah it's much
more local compared to like Landmark I'm
more used to going to SM neck growing up
yeah versus plasma because in Laguna we
never had like landmarks the closest
Landmark would be yellow bound
by the way guys today I discovered what
is it called the Japan home Japan Home
Center one of those 89 pesos in 88 pesos
or 99 pesos per item and I bought like a
bunch of like microfiber cloths and
it's a sushi maker like a sushi roll
maker yeah you were so happy yeah
[Music]
yeah
so energy
I mean I've always liked about Homestead
but it's nowadays I think it's difficult
to find uh branches of Japan really they
used to be everywhere but what I always
see is uh Japan Surplus
something something on the sides of the
roads in the province yeah
on the side of the highway
drop the name it survived
[Music]
just cook just be prepared Saturday's
lounging day for me doing usual
household tours cook dinner watching
something on my cocktails Tequila
Sunrise Tequila Sunrise nice yeah we
should give it to Tequila summer as a
try one thing
is there anyone close enough to
that can
hop on a fingering plant just come here
and let's let's chill together make it a
vibe
oh nice we have 53 people in the uh
in the live stream that's very nice
thank you for joining us today on this
live stream actually I have to say we
plan on doing these live streams on a
regular basis maybe like a live stream
per week doing things like cooking
um but also maybe like going to special
like restaurants where it's cool to live
stream but just let us know in the chat
right now or if even better in the
comments or send me a message on
Instagram making it happen Vlog like
what would be a kind of a live stream
that you would be like excited about
watching that you'd be interested like
what are some topics what are some ideas
please do let us know yeah
and since then since this 50 oh no
they're 65 now so first it's the 65
people that are here and finally you can
answer the question that people ask the
most yes
what is that what is the question tell
me what is that what is the most asked
question is it is it why why I'm so
loving to you is that the most last
question
let's see if it pops up I'll answer it
all right if the most asked question
let's figure out what the most asked
question is and when it pops up we can
answer
everybody ask in the chat right now by
the way what I'm doing here with my
cocktail is I'm pre-shaking the whiskey
sour to get the Emulsion going
and then I'll add ice and I'll shake it
again
by the way yes I'm not sure if I
announced this here on the Vlog already
but
um the next most location is actually
going to be in Makati uh it's going to
be the poison location right
[Music]
and the reason why I'm so excited about
making cocktails lately is that most
location is actually also going to serve
cocktails which is going to be really
exciting so we'll have like cocktail
evenings maybe we can do like live music
sessions things like that so
yeah quite quite splitting with the idea
of that because I always do love
you guys
let's see
what is your age Gap okay
it's so funny because this question
comes up every time in the Q a
and the reason why we always joke about
that is because people sometimes make
such a big deal about it I guess we
don't really we don't really mind but
it's just funny to like keep the running
guy going
giving funny answers yeah
so the answer is gray is 65 and I'm 22.
laughs
joke Lang joke Lang so I mean most of
you guys know that I just turned 40 this
year in March
and you turned I turned you turn I turn
around
she went up to the grocery store in this
outfit today
well go ahead and say
I'm going to try and guess in the chat
how old they're great love this video
will go
online

to do it
you guys are close
I'll be there anyway yeah so go ahead
stay potatoes
huh
okay
all right
no I'll be waiting for the guys okay the
first guest is coming in 25.
[Music]

that's the last comment what
I can't go ahead guys comment comment
what's your guess what's your guess
guess the age
I know usually you're not supposed to
ask a lady for her age but I guess this
is the exception everybody gets together
I guess in the chat
[Music]
people
so we're getting further away guys we're
gonna throw away
[Music]
okay guys I apologize already because
it's going to get a little bit loud when
I shake the cocktail with the ice
so love
love how long does it does it take to
make Beacon Express
this is like 30 minutes 30 minutes and
what are these steps that you've been
taking so far just chopping everything
up
this is
yeah this this just chopping everything
up
okay so the guests are coming in 24 23
and we have already one correct guess
which is O V Cube pH the second guess is
correct I was born in 2000. November so
I am a Scorpio
cheese tortillas
[Music]
it's sold out right
yeah
guys sorry about the noise but I gotta
shake it like a polaro pizza
preach all the glasses
please
how this whiskey salad turned out today
you know with whiskey sours if you mix
it up with the
sugar that you're using because it's a
different sugar that I'm using today
than last time so it always kind of
changes the oh look at this color
uh this is the coconut sugar
definitely makes it a lot darker
all right guys quick rapid fire if you
have any questions that you wanted to
know and you've left it in the Q and A's
like Instagram stories that are posted
but they didn't get answered now's your
chance to ask again
I made two levels this is just enough
for one actually
yeah
okay is that essential
uh it was not intentional no but it is
what it is
so this one is yours
okay
um so we've chopped out all the
vegetables and now we're going to the
frying fish right yeah we could but like
I'm just gonna chop the ginger actually
do you want to do that chop the ginger
no uh
station ready
oh
who would believe I am older than white
dragon
that was just a joke one time in the
video
oh Janina Rose thank you so much for the
Super Chat highly highly appreciated
thank you thank you thank you thank you
Mike how tall is Graham
um so I am I'm one one meter 88 or six
foot two and you are I guess like one
175 centimeters I'm five seven five
seven okay here we go
yes you're making people come
also there's a question
like
what does that mean
[Music]
s
just in general like uh this and
something annoys me or something yeah
like you mean are you asking how many
times today
okay I don't know what happened to you
whiskey sour honestly it was quite what
is that
what did happen to those whiskey sour
this is not how whiskey sun is supposed
to look what happened here
what is that
I mean it smells good
out of the dishwasher yeah no I'm just
confused by the color and the texture it
has is it maybe the egg
I don't really try it
so can they answer that question
uh it's five seven tall for Filipino
woman
I guess I'd say so I mean yeah I said
you you're taller than most
most uh people that I most people most
not most most uh the most women in the
Philippines that I know you seem to be
taller
it's just ah and actually every time you
would meet someone every time you're
outside and we would meet someone I love
turkey guys would say oh you're so much
soldered person
like they can't believe that I'm telling
person because like here at camera like
if I next to Mike I look like uh I don't
like enhance
oh he's so tidy because you have a size
comparison between us two is quite uh
the size difference is quite big
so answering the love
um do we get
on each other's nerves well sometimes
obviously in relationships it's a normal
thing that you fight I think
relationships would you never have
arguments or fights are
uh very dangerous but when we but when
like when we say fight we don't fight
like
we never like throw things at each other
or
cuss at each other no it's not like that
not like that oh Janina Rose thank you
so much thank you thank you thank you
much appreciated the Super Chat highly
appreciated
uh here's another mic I'm imagining you
feeding your one and only
you're only one
but usually
um I feel like the worst torture I could
do instead of like screaming at you when
we're fighting instead of screaming or
anything I would just ignore him the
silent tree yeah silent treatment silent
treatment like a lot of women don't know
that's the key to winning an argument
the silent tree how is it oh well now I
know how I now I am old and I am away
the more silent
the more no more
[Music]
Caleb I think I'm gonna make this an old
fashioned instead okay
I put it over into the room because it's
uh it's too yeah
all right I gotta move you guys a little
bit so we can move over to the friend
station let's see if this works
so over here we have the pan set up
already we're now the fireworks are
gonna start I hope that we don't set up
the fire alarm again
so uh maybe we'll see some of the
building stuff today as well when they
come to check why the fighters went up
[Music]
by the way guys I love it every time
that Great Cooks uh silicon when she's
done with the first step which is frying
the pork I was coming like pick a pic
get myself a few bites of the pork and
it is the delicious delectable
where my
my grandmother would close up
like what my grandmother used to support
a little bit yeah
okay I think the Whiskey's salary it's
just because of I think it was the egg
that made it kind of weird
and yeah I don't know that color was
just so different yeah and I'm quite
understandable when you crack the egg
was it uh liquidy or is there still a
mini crust
um nope it was just a normal just a very
normal egg nothing
strange anyway I will say I do feel like
a
um old-fashioned today anyway
okay
and for today's old-fashioned I will be
using a monkey shoulder usually with an
old-fashion I'll go with a burden but
I've run out of burger today so I'm
gonna go with whiskey I wonder how the
audio quality is for the uh
how is the audio quality with the the
frame right now guys is it too loud is
it okay
let us know in the cup
um good question good question a lot of
the dishes
by myself but the basics of cooking and
my interest in cooking started by
witnessing my grandmother who came
during fiestas in Laguna Laguna and
Batangas we always we always spend a lot
of time and a lot of effort
um cooking disappearing Fiesta so most
of the time my grandmother would need
help like peeling potatoes or chopping
carrots and stuff like that and that's
how my interest in cooking started
um and
actually
today
um just a few hours ago we were supposed
to cancel the live stream because
we just received the news and news that
my grandmother passed away after a few
weeks of that thing would be longer and
dietitians in the hospital eventually
[Music]
um she passed away today and it was it
was
to some extent
um really using because she wasn't so
much pain and he wasn't so much I
believe that it was hard it was very
difficult to watch someone who
raised you to be in her that that and
and and
gasping for it
but yeah
um she decided
um
where the live stream anyway
um so yeah
thank you for thanking you for your time
father
yeah maybe uh a bit of a lot of
distraction also to do the live stream
today and you know give a little bit of
purpose and activities and yeah
all right
I hope the cocktail turns out nicely but
often with a little bit of a disaster
and I hope if I fell on let him go off
as well
[Music]
oh my thoughts on the missing subtitles
oh my God I have so many thoughts on
that it's
um so it's interesting because I uh I've
been really swallowing along with the
whole uh story of the Subway after such
uh something really because you know a
lot of uh there was a lot of things
happening with that thing like quality
things that were
um not really good and also the
engineering of the thing was also much
that I heard that they used mainly
carbon fiber to build a subtly which is
a very bad material for that use case
because carbon fiber is very step very
hard and withstands a lot of pressure
but it's not flexible at all so once it
reaches the point of no return it just
breaks and explodes and there's no way
back with like stainless steel it has a
certain amount of flex yeah
what else do we have uh
Mike you look you're lucky to find Gray
she's white material yes I couldn't
agree more I am I am very lucky I've
made that realization a few times in the
past year that I'm a very very lucky man
oh
all right
all right let's I'll bring you guys over
here so you can see what we're frying up
here
oh that looks very very nice look at
that
[Music]
I over
they have one
ah
that looks lovely
by the way guys I'll give you a quick
tour of my cocktail area uh here's some
nice bottles of Patron gold and silver a
nice Hendrix gin a nice selection of a
few whiskeys here and here goes my
variegated
my plant also here there's some nice
teas as well
like infusing simple syrup with tea
can really up your game when you're
making cocktails and then yes just a few
uh bottles of wine here's the the coffee
machine but this is basically like the
the man cave where I uh yeah just mess
around with things that I like doing
yeah this would be like I over tried it
like this I made it like for what I
would do for Pentagon yeah but it looks
good
[Music]
not so much
okay let me
try a piece of the fork
s
so good
it's also good
by the way this is the lighting setup
here
and here
is Peanut
peanuts say hello to the live stream
peanut has been very very cute lately
good girl
[Music]
um
very cuddly and she's carrying her Teddy
around everywhere
which is very cute
yeah by the way guys we were able to
sort the mosquito situation right
the majority of the mosquitoes are gone
without the buy one
right let me
set this back up here
so love
what would you say is your favorite
Filipino dish beside of silicon because
we all know that we both read the
destiny
but let's say the sightseeing up what
would you say is
a few like a few days ago like what do
you think is mine
aside from Cinema
you're asking do you know no I told you
what it is everyone
does uh what I have here is a big ice
cube that is made up of a cold brew
coffee and I made this coffee chocolate
from most coffee beans so it's a a very
nice uh like flavor infused Ice Cube
that goes really well with making it
like grony you can have a cold brew
Negroni or in this case we have in
um old-fashioned so it's going to be a
cold brew infused old-fashioned really
gives like nice uh caramel flavors into
the cocktails super super delicious
oh wow there's so many so many uh cats
the question does gray have a twin
sister
not really to an assistant yes but not
not a twin and your sisters yeah
yeah your sister's never been in the
Vlogs right
um
like it's time to wake up baby
love what's your least favorite
Philippines
that's not a hard question which is my
favorite I I really don't I just I just
can't put the ballot it's the the
textures
[Music]
a fan of dishes that are too sweet like
uh the three Filipino spaghetti I uh
it's not that I disliked it but I
wouldn't say it's my favorite
for you yeah you did I mean it was it
was okay I liked it but it's not
something that you know if I have the
choice if I'm looking at a menu and I
see a sweet Filipino spaghetti it's not
something that I would
uh gravitate towards or decide to
to drink that
if that makes any sense I mean with all
honesty your absolute favorite is the
city yeah my absolute favorite is
definitely like there's no day of the
week that we would not have synagogue it
has we have to have silicone like one
week like every once a week yeah we once
a week would you would like to delve
into the city oh my God we're almost at
a hundred people in the live stream very
very nice
um so here's a question will I degrade
put back on on her Express recipe
yeah
yes right there
you shouldn't have asked that because he
doesn't like uh yeah I don't really like
I'm not a big fan of bugs so I've been
I've been trying to hide it because it
doesn't
again
I actually thought that this goes into
no problem
[Music]
see you should not have asked now I
could have just put it without him
knowing
um
have you tried the electronic or red
silicone
have you what is red cinnamon I don't
know I could use it the watermelon you
know in the chat about red singer is
I've never this is the first time I'm
hearing of it
might be something interesting also does
Mike know of kanpur okay
concealer
it's not nice without
also because the fresh cologne is not
accessible just putting a hamburger
so uh
might look so happy with gray you can
see it in his smile you're quite lucky
to have her yes I couldn't agree more
looking forward to trying more coffee
when I get to home yes definitely I've
been so appreciative of the support for
most happy uh if you guys don't know
more coffee is located in Robinson's
Magnolia we have a lot of really really
cool specialty beverages some really fun
uh sweet temperatures like flavored
stuff that's really cool but also just
like the Classic Soft coffee
um so I'm really really proud of most
crafty I'm really proud of the team and
the many that we put together and I
really appreciate it all the support
that you guys have been giving also more
copies

just fantastic
oh we have an open one oh it's just a
different one yeah so this is the
dorians by the way uh thank you to
Lawrence that actually sent us a care
pack with a lot of different types of
touches yeah we're very excited to get
it I I certainly like the uh the
practice that is infused with Jimmy
actually with that not go well with the
uh be cool Express because of the spicy
I often already
cheers
okay I think red cine gun is sinigan
with watermelon actually I've had it
once
one uh yeah it's nice I right that was a
little bit too sweet for me as well I
like the the Lesser sweet ones
okay can I store yes yes can I hollow
hollow mix next yes sir oh it smells so
good like when that coconut cream goes
inside the pan
mixes up with everything we're really
lucky
let's cheers
this is a uh old-fashioned
me I'm like um
it's less sweet because it's not bourbon
it's whiskey
and this is the
the coffee
no uh this is monkey shoulder whiskey
so this recipe is
quite fast already like is there
anything still missing
and
a lot of tomatoes red tomatoes is that
what
I've never tried the watermelon
synagogue because I'm so scared of the
Innovative idea and stuff like that
ah red silicone instead of fresh tomato
he used tomato paste

way of you know sharing content and
letting us know guys do you are you
enjoying this live stream is this
something that you'd like to see more
often on the channel I already said
before to let us know some uh some
recommendations of like a wish list of
things that you'd like us to do in live
streams we can put it into our plan but
yeah definitely uh we want to be doing
this like once a week a live streaming
week and I think the the cooking kind of
aspect of it is always a nice nice idea
oh nice
can I show my hidden palette
the singing no it's not much of a hidden
talent What's your hidden pattern my
talent that you're always so proud
spray can do the thing with her tongue
that I've never seen anybody ever do
anywhere on the planet it's the first
time I've ever seen okay sure this but I
think I'll have to bring the camera
closer it's so funny how you're so oh no
actually
now you already promised it so now you
have to show us
you do that
I have no idea how that even works
all right here's the vehicle Express is
progressing nicely
love you put it too close in my face I
told you I haven't brushed my teeth no
no it's okay
it's okay
all right sorry guys I'm putting you
back on the tripod
all right love what other questions can
we answer that we didn't have time to
answer in the
so every every q a video I get oh sorry
every q a degree I get so many questions
about peanut and yeah peanut is doing
very very well she's such a good cat
very uncomplicated cut actually and in
recent months she has become super super
needy and super super cuddly it's just
one of those things with cats when you
have a young cat they're very
um so when they're babies they're very
affectionate because they just need the
protection and they need to feel
comforted but then when they get like
I'd say two or three months they become
very dependent independent and it's like
their teenage years teenage years and
they don't have to do anything with the
parents and they're just like maculit
but now peanut is that age that's the
logic for for cats being that way that's
a logic yeah yeah and then I think when
they get like two years old that's when
they become super super cuddly and super
affectionate and she yeah she whenever
I'm at home she doesn't like to leave my
size because my divorce my little baby
so as you can see she'll just she'll
just stay here on my shoulder all day
it's so weird for me because I'm
actually scared of cats before like I
couldn't I could never get close to
peanut because I'm just I'm scared of
cats I become frantic and I I panic
immediately but and and you told me like
you told me the first time once peanut
sees me she's gonna bite me because she
bites everyone just to what did what did
he say it's like to assert her dominance
like she yeah to show off that it's her
home she's she's in charge and
everything but she's supposed to kind of
stop doing that as well
my point
is
what does that mean uh yeah I actually
left it in the oh the spoon I forgot it
let's go looking out for us guys
ah these are like
so I actually I had the service pause
because for me the starting is only
relevant when I'm traveling when I'm out
camping when I'm somewhere where they
usually would be bad internet connection
that's where I like to be installing
um so I deactivated the service which is
a nice thing you can pause it and
reactivate that at any time but today I
actually reactivated it because I lent
it to a friend uh actually my business
partner I lended to him because he said
he's been having internet connection
problems here in BGC so he wants to give
it a try and I'll let you guys know how
it worked out for him because he has a
little bit better visibility to the sky
than we do here at this building
no yes can you see if you can
this is
our uh
here's our situation with our cupboard
we actually bought these lift organizers
that industry just overflows
here yeah I know a brush
you don't want to use the bone broth
that I don't know
the greatest fold that I still have to
lift things down from Charlottesville
no come on
stop
you just say things like that to TV
to say things like that please I know
this is chicken
where is this
Style
what besides the salt
oh there's some more uh battery problems
I can relate I might have you tried long
what's that
what is that come please elaborate what
is oh
t-o-g-u-e it's what time okay the spring
beans
soybeans the the one with the crunchy
thing bean sprouts bean sprouts yeah
well that sounds a lot like just like
spring rolls right right now yeah you
love it we love it
one of my favorite million plus
um Mike do you try corn coffee I can't
say I've ever tried corn coffee
yesterday we went for Korean barbecue
and BGC and we have corn tea which I
didn't try by the way yeah it was quite
nice it was something different
something refreshing
yeah it's like new and refreshing
exciting
I'm sorry I'm sorry I'll get out of your
way
by the way guys while I have you here uh
did you all see yesterday's Vlog we
um went to Batangas to go snorkeling and
we tried out the sequel D2 they kindly
sponsored our video yesterday and I am

underwater jet pack it is so much fun
and I think that Vlog was also so much
fun it was very very enjoyable very very
like fun upbeat positive
yeah I enjoyed it I enjoyed it let me
know in the chat that you were able to
watch that video and if you liked it as
well I think that spot that we found we
decided that that should be a nice
Village only tomorrow
Henry technically yeah maybe yeah
because it's a nice little uh Hideaway
spot you can go there they have good
internets they have beach access you can
go snowflang it's so so relaxing so nice
yeah
and the water looks cool from Elaine
pink Beach Zamboanga piece yes uh Pink
Peach sambaranga definitely we are
getting ready to start our team oxelia
uh which is going to be like part two we
started with the hilaga serial we went
up north the team of Seattle is going to
take us down south uh we want to go all
the way down to the most southern point
of the Philippines and some guanga is
very very high up on our list and we
definitely would want to visit the pink
Beach as well
um we actually had planned to do the
Teamworks area already earlier but
obviously with everything going on in
our lives right now
in the whole
situation we we tried to postpone all
our travel plans
just because make
make calls
Jose is still going to happen we're
still going to do it
um we just have to define the date
Wednesday
oh this is on
yes
um
understand
peanut is talking to us
if you're eating time it's not your
goodest time yet
oh I have to go way down here look this
is burning a little bit ready
for a little bit
but it's supposed to rendered
um yeah
I think in school I'll let this stuff
cool down and then I'll put it back onto
the heat so yeah team oxidative
definitely happening definitely exciting
to do that
um but it's just like a lot of things
came into the way like uh yeah life is
not linear life comes with curves and
surprises unexpected things also we've
been working on a new project we've been
tirelessly working on a new project uh
starting a new business in the
Philippines that we are incredibly
excited about sharing it is something
huge it's something that's never done in
this form it's never been done before in
the storm in the Philippines and we
can't wait to share that news with you
guys
um because it's been an absolute passion
for a bit of ours and it's going to be
happening very soon and also at the same
time over the past few weeks I have been
writing my very first book and I
actually finished writing my book when I
was it two two or three days ago or four
days ago uh yeah I I wrote a book I'm so
excited I can't believe it I actually
finished it a few days ago and I'll be
sharing what that is and where you can
get the book if you would want to see
the book but if you guys want to take a
guess what the book is about it's an
ebook so if you want to guess what the
e-book is about please do so in the chat
it's mostly so good it smells so good
yeah it does
describe you guys real quick
oh this is looking lovely
so good
okay so I have been getting a few
comments already about what the book
could be about let me just Mount you
guys back onto the tripod
go oops
all right so uh the the book is a
technology oriented book and it is a
guide on how to
manage certain Technologies I'll just
keep it at that I'm giving away too much
already
but yeah you guys are here in the live
stream uh you uh get like a first-hand
views of what it could be
um by the way guys uh we wanted to
become like we want to be a little bit
more uh engaged in the chats that we're
having on this video so I think we need
to find a way to be able to focus on
individual charts more than a long
Stream So maybe the next stream we'll
try and do kind of like uh members only
stream that could be a fun thing to do
where we talk a bit more like in depth
about things that are happening in our
lives
um so yeah let me know let me know what
you guys would like to see on these like
since I was really
wow still so many people I'm just like
you by the way guys
um also don't forget to leave a comment
on this live stream because the chat
suddenly disappears after a while uh
when the live stream is done but the
video still lives and exists here on the
channel and it's easier afterwards to
read comments as well to keep up to date
waiting for you Mike to collab again
with thin snow gray and Charlotte being
subscribed to your channel since you
start collab with Vince now ah thank you
so much yeah as I if we both get into
the same like area of the Philippines
I'm sure we can uh coordinate a a meet
up and do a little bit of a collab are
they in yourself
let's see
all right
very nice oh my God I have to say I'm so
so hungry right now
are you hungry well just yeah I guess
it smells really good now
all we've had to eat today so far is
just a grilled cheese right yeah
oh yeah
sure have you what did you get the
failed at any point
wasn't there one one time you cooked us
and it burned it was in South Africa
yeah but there was a soap but I didn't
eat that because I was sick at the time
right
foreign
like all different corners of the world
in those live streams it's crazy to
think with technology like how it's
easier to connect to people from all
over the world it's so nice
leave it
peanut okay not sitting in the corner I
think she doesn't know what's going on
it's too spicy for you it feels like
white sauce spicy
this peanut
I always find it so cute it says yes so
many of you always uh like so concerned
about peanut when we're traveling or
like when we're doing stuff over which
is not in the block for like one or two
days everybody's like what's happening
to peanuts with peanuts peanut is always
while taking tea out uh our friend Jay
David said she also has a Kat Mindy so
they get to hang out together
look at that
yeah
yeah I think that's part about the new
family here
by the way uh the mosquito zapper is
fantastic I think the problem has been
solved permanently I'd say and today we
actually got a second zapper just for
the card because sometimes you get like
mosquitoes in the car from the garage
and
no
it's good to have

started hit by the storm recently right

international travel destination
so we want to travel to Taipei because
Taipei has yeah
yeah we want to travel to Taipei and
explore some street food in Taipei also
Taipei is really promoting tourism at
the moment and there's kind of a like a
raffle where when you travel to Taipei
you potentially
