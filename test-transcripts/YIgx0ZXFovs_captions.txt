now I'm waiting for grab to Katrina and
now let's just taking ages as well I had
a grand driver and he didn't even know
where he was he's asking me where do I
go and I'm like mate you should be able
to tell by your grand screen exactly
where I am and he's like all the other
way down there I'm stopped her I don't
have time to so I cancelled on that and
now I'm waiting for another grab driver
and I'm currently 45 minutes late and
it'll probably take me 15 minutes to get
there so I'm gonna be an hour late I'm
just hoping Katrina isn't on yet Edie

stuffed the slide up Julie just misses
me as he eats already sleeping it's
already Abed sorry we finally made it
