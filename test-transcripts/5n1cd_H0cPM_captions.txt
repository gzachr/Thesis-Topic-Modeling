today i finally get to do something that
i was
strictly prohibited strictly prohibited
from doing
i'm so excited
[Music]
i'm good things they
don't burst i wish that they could but
i'm sorry
i just want to draw with you tonight
[Music]
six weeks guys it has been six weeks
since i had my surgery here
in manila the philippines and today i
finally get
to do something that i was strictly
prohibited
strictly prohibited from doing for six
weeks
what is up guys welcome to the vlog
[Music]
alright guys so the thing i wasn't able
to do and that i'm going to start to do
on a regular basis from now on again is
going to the gym and getting a good
workout done the doctor told me strictly
no weight lifting
strictly no gym light cardio was the
only thing that i was allowed to do over
the past six weeks so i'm super super
excited
to get back to the gym i don't know if
you guys are feeling new around here
this channel you might not know but i
used to
go to the gym really on an everyday
basis
so this is like a huge huge huge moment
for me and i'm super excited
i'm so excited
[Applause]
[Music]
oh wow what a difference it's been a
while since we've been in the gym
oh my god oh so nice
so bright here such a great gym
i feel already so much better super
motivated
but i have to say i struggle with a few
exercises because it's been
months since i used the gym so the goal
is to get back on track and get better
[Music]
see
all right we are done at the gym first
day oh
so good it was so good yeah it felt
really good to
have worked out again and uh we
as you saw before we came here with the
motorbike so we avoid traffic
which makes it just easier to go to the
gym easier to be in a healthy habit
and now we're going to treat ourselves
to some healthy food to a salad
from our favorite greek place which is
located right across the road
oh look at the beautiful sky ah i feel
good i feel so good i love the gym it's
so
bright and nice and just and it
motivates me so much and we were texting
with george and lucy because they
work out here as well and we said we're
going to make a new hashtag
making it juicy getting ripped oh nice
nice i'm super excited i'm i'm super
pumped
and it makes such a difference to be at
a gym versus
working out at home mike and i used to
literally literally live at a gym we
would go there
in the morning and in the evening back
in austria and we were super super
ripped
but i think we're going to take it easy
especially with mike um
building up slowly after his surgery
yeah his fitness levels
um i will say what i really really like
about the gym
is the safety precautions yeah so every
single station has a own alcohol bottle
and an old
towel so you can disinfect before and
after which is really really cool
and the stuff there is so
nice so helpful makes it really
enjoyable to work out right couldn't
agree more
let's get a salad and drive home
so definitely have this feeling of
happiness after the workout which i
didn't have for a very very long time
because it's just it's not the same when
you work out at home
there's this burden to even get started
we have weights at home we tried to work
hard but we never really did so
um yeah i hope that that we will
keep up the consistency we both mike and
i agree that we're going to
try to work out as often as possible but
also
be very responsible with our health and
um
take breaks we need that so looking
forward to this
amazing meal from soof
best greek in town
tell me that you don't wanna be on your
own
[Music]
guys it is two days actually
it's three days since that workout at
the gym and
my muscles are so so sore i'm not used
to it anymore it's so crazy
but i have to say it feels it's like the
good kind of
pain you know the no pain no gain um
it's the good kind where you know you
did a good workout and your body is
like rebuilding those muscles now so i
did
like the first time in a very very long
time i did like biceps curls and i did
a chest workout and it was really really
intense but
really really good and i'm so
pumped and motivated for that gym it is
the fitness army
in the bgc location that we visited if
you had realized from the vlog
the place is amazing the trainers are
awesome
really fun fun guys and i think we
excited to also be able to work out with
george and lucy sometime
because when you have like friends
at the gym it just makes it that much
more enjoyable
but at the same time i'm also just
excited to go and walk out with nelly
and make it to our new routine we didn't
go we only
we've been once and then kind of life
came in between because we had a bunch
of stuff to do this week
but then from next week we're going to
go again on monday we're going to go
again on thursday
because tuesday and wednesday we are
away on a little trip
making it juicy on the road is all i
want to say at this time
guys i hope you enjoyed today's vlog i
definitely enjoyed being back at the gym
and we will see you guys tomorrow same
time same place remember to stay awesome
be positive and make it happen bye
