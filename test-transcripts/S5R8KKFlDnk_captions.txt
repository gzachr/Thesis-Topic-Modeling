what is the meaning of life this meaning
is not for you to find but for you to
[Music]
define
and welcome back to mg and the echo
arosio vela and before we even start
this
video i'd like to thank the gma
network and let me tell you why it's
because
when i uploaded my video about medium
defensor santiago um the youtube
algorithm you know
caught my video not only put a copyright
claim on it but
also blocked it you know and
in the uh the backhand it said that you
know it belongs to the gma network and i
was
really bummed out not because i wanted
to make you know
money out of it or anything like that
but because i genuinely
loved miriam defensor santiago
and i wanted a different audience
you know to to know who she is so i
actually
contacted uh you know the gma network
through
youtube and asked them if they would
kindly
uh just you know unblock the video and
not only
did they unblock the video but they also
let me
monetize it which i am very thankful
for thank you so much gma network you
guys are the best
and that is something that abs-cbn
never actually did you know because i
did dispute
a bunch of claims from abs-cbn and they
always
refused but the gma network actually
they almost always accept so thank you
so much gma
network and now my audience has access
to the video
and get to see you know and gets to
learn
about medium defense or santiago and
guys i'm telling you the truth here when
i say that
in my thumbnail i actually wanted to put
instead of pine
pineai president i wanted to put the
best
president the philippines never had i
actually wanted to put that but then i
was like
i'm not filipino so i'm not sure that
i'm supposed to
actually put that in my thumbnail
because i don't know i don't know if she
actually could have been the best
president you know and i don't know
enough about her
but you know i released the video and
then in the comment section
that's what most people are writing you
know the
best president the philippines never had
and i was so pleased to see that i was
like wow
i actually got it right that's actually
the feeling that i got
from watching that video you know so
this is
awesome and it's lovely to see that you
guys really
enjoyed that video and we are requesting
more i actually did not plan to make
this second video about
uh medium defense or santiago
but someone sent me this video and i
thought
why not and i'm learning something even
newer
about this wonderful woman so apparently
she wrote a book that's called
stupid is forever and apparently in this
video they're gonna show us
famous quotes from uh the book slash
from medium defensor santiago so i hope
you guys are
ready and i really really hope that this
video is not gonna be
blocked and in order to avoid that i
decided to record the the audio of the
video
with my microphone instead of putting
the original audio of the video
now having said that please consider
following me on instagram at
music game news and
now we can go we can do it let's go
boom handbags i don't like them at all
because they occupy my hands my hand
should always be ready in case i need to
slash somebody
what this very powerful message came
from no other than the iron lady of asia
miriam defensor satyam a filipina are
you serious
that's something that she said she
doesn't like handbags because
she needs her hands to be free in case
she needs to slap somebody
wow i love her humor academic
lawyer judge author and states women
who serve in all three branches of the
philippine government
judicial executive and legislative
born miriam palma defensor on june 15
1945
miriam defensor santiago was named as
one of the hundred
most powerful women in the world in
1997. there you go he was known for
being a long-serving senator of the
republic of the philippines
and elected as judge of the
international criminal court
and the sole woman recipient of the
philippines highest national recognition
was named laureate of the ramon
basically award for government service
with a citation for bold and moral
leadership
in cleaning up executive i love this
shot do you know why
because ah wait a minute nah never mind
i
actually thought that she was the only
one
wearing like this very poppy uh
pink color but i think they did that on
purpose
you know they put everything in black
and white so that she can stand out
but it would have been great if that was
actually the case in real life that
everyone was wearing like brown
black white and she was the only one in
pink you know that would have been
so cool government agency in 1988
she ran in the 1992 presidential
election but was controversially
defeated
[Music]
seriously
because he has given us money or he has
promised us an appointment or a
promotion in public office
or some humanity public contract we
would have helped to perpetuate
a vicious cycle of blood
[Music]
yes
[Music]
so she tried to become president
twice and failed and apparently the
second time when she ran
against duterte it's because she was
already
sick well that's what you guys are
telling me in the comment section below
and she was
already losing her train of thought you
know so it was difficult for her
wow but man did you see the poise
the way she talks a lot of
power and a lot of uh assurance you know
in the way she speaks
those are the signs of a leader in 2012
million different sources and charisma
became the first filipina
and the first asian from a developing
country to be elected a charge of the
international criminal court in 2016 she
became part of the international
advisory council
of the international development law
organization
myriad different stories at chat was
served three terms in developing senate
on october 13 2015 she declared her
candidacy by president of philippines in
the 2016 election
after her doctors for the united states
declared her cancer stable
and receded ah that is so sad can you
imagine your doctors tell you that your
cancer has receded and
stable and then what a few months later
you die because
because of it damn damn you cancer
lost the election in december 2018
the prestigious castle service cross was
posthumously conferred about santiago
making her the first and so far only
woman and six persons since 1946 to be
enthralled in the country's highest
roster
miriam lady
the platinum lady the incorruptible lady
yeah tiger lady i think that's the best
one the uncorruptable
lady you know she cannot be corrupted
yes and most popularly
the iron lady of asia yeah she died on
september 29 2016.
in memory of her greatness philippine
tales would like to share
this amazing thoughts of william
defensor santiago let's go
kept inspiring us up to this day and
always yeah
the cancer that demands our urgent
attention
is corruption and poverty wow
i love love love the fact that she's
using
something that's you know affecting her
badly to actually teach people
about corruption and poverty you know
she's so right
because can corruption and poverty is
the same
it eats you up from the inside
the dalai lama has taught me that the
best way to live
life is to try and avoid desire
desire is really the basic source of
unhappiness
i don't know if i am okay with that or
if um
yeah i don't know i don't know i don't
know why should you avoid
desire if it's like a first instinct you
know i
i don't think you should avoid your
first instinct at all
so i'm not sure about this one i'm just
being honest
and it's like the best way to live life
is to try and avoid a desire basically
you're fighting your first basic
instinct your
entire life no no in my opinion
you can do a little bit of both you know
that's what i what i always say you have
to stay
in the middle you need to learn how to
balance yourself you know don't go to
the extremes
too often the extremes are fine from
time to time you know they make you feel
rush a rush but it's best to stay
between i'd say like
uh 40 percent and 60 you know
i have no one at my side except god and
his angels i pray to god that he will
turn my enemies into pillars of sauce
okay well this would speak to uh people
that are very
religious oh my god and they took the
picture
of her doing the cross no
like exorcism
[Music]
leadership is not about personality it's
about behavior
and observable set of skills and
abilities uh i think it's about both
i think it's about personality and uh
behavior
and an observable set of skills and
abilities i think you need a little bit
of personality you know
and she had both you know she has a
strong personality and i think a lot of
people like her
because of her personality as well you
know people don't follow
unfortunately don't follow a person that
is good and has great intentions
and has uh you know observable set of
skills and abilities but
personality wise you know they're flat
you know unfortunately
they just don't you know it's more
interesting to follow someone
that has charisma that has a personality
and everything you know you
i don't know that's just what i think
[Music]
yes i want to be known as terminator
terminator who has seen the movies let
me know in the comment section below
and i'm talking about terminator one and
two because the rest they're
they're kind of they kind of suck
and which one is your favorite my
favorite is the second one
my style is confrontational yes when i
see evil i want to remove it
right away and i kind of saw that in the
clips that they showed in
the previous video i reacted to you know
she is direct
you know she is who she is and i love it
honest just like this channel you know
i wish i wish more channels you know
would be more honest and not
abide by the uh capitalist
rules you know of oh i have to say
i have to always say you know positive
things just because i don't want people
to bash me
and i don't want companies to uh
you know remove me from their list you
know and stuff like that
come on man have some decency
[Music]
in a corrupt country if you want to
succeed in politics
you must keep your conscience under
control
well i don't know if it only applies to
just politics i think it applies to a
lot of things
i'd like an in-depth critique of this
quote
[Music]
which means not all that sweet is loyal
to you
remember a sweet candy is always wrapped
it's always wrapped in plastic
and guess what too many of sweet candies
will hurt your teeth okay careful
careful they will it will rot your teeth
your tooth
you know eventually so careful i like
this one
ah look at that they put her teeth
in the in pink
what is the meaning of life this meaning
is not for you to find but for you to
define
i love it i love it basically the way i
see it is like speak with your actions
yeah and apply what you
what you're thinking like lead by
example
[Music]
life is a consequence of our moral
choices sure why not yeah
[Music]
humor is the audience
[Music]
oh my god plural floral
because filipinos like to switch the p's
and f's right oh that was awesome
see personality i think it's important
[Music]
women as agents of change
society as a whole when women are
educated
and empowered economically their
families
become healthier their children go to
school
incomes she was definitely a
spokesperson for uh
the female community if you will i mean
i saw that
in the last video where she believes
or i don't know if she genuinely
believes that but she did
mention that basically women
are superior to men because women
are made from uh human materials but
men aren't something like that
[Music]
to help the right redress the wrong it
seems so easy
to be strong so simple to be true
all big and fast the vicious crowd
when mother means alone thank you very
much
to be honest i am very curious
to see uh how the world would turn out
if uh women were in power
of countries you know i'm just curious
about it
[Music]
ignorance can be treated but stupid is
forever there you go that's the quote
the main quote
of the book i guess ignorance can be
treated
because you can teach right but
stupid is forever and i guess
stupid is when you're hard-headed i
guess you know
you're not open-minded and you're not
willing
to learn i think that's what she means
by that
[Music]
there you go this was
very pleasant as well and i could have
kept
reading more of her quotes and tried to
think about them you know i think it
would have been even more interesting if
i had a
guest to debate about all these quotes
you know what i mean so
since i don't have anyone right now
let's debate together in the comment
section below and
tell me your thoughts about the multiple
quotes
that were featured in this video this
was
lovely and it is sad and it is a shame
that you know she left us too soon you
know she could have been an amazing
president uh from what i've gathered you
know
and you guys answered my question too
and said that her son
actually committed suicide which is very
very very sad my god that is terrible
but but but okay so this was my second
video about medium defensor santiago

interesting
