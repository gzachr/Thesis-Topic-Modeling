and welcome
this is a big night right here everybody
uh miss universe
is 70 years old
i'm 64.
so i'm six years younger than miss
universe
you can't tell i'm 64
because i am so flat
i am just so black
now listen to me
miss universe started
around 1952.
that was about
three years
before color tv
the introduction of color tv came about
in 1952
we didn't get a color tv
in our house
to 1972
because my father decided
we had enough color in our house so we
didn't get the tv
but without color
you would not see all the beautiful
costumes and gorgeous contestants and
fabrics that we have and tonight
we are in the beautiful country of
israel
[Applause]
this is a country with so much rich
culture in history
uh we flew into tel aviv
you fly into tel aviv
my crew
uh told me that they had a wonderful
beautiful
four hour long drive
to the city of a lot we are in a lot
israel right now
[Applause]
now you have to fly
into tel aviv
they took a four-hour drive
i called a helicopter
same beautiful drive it was wonderful
take a helicopter listen to me get a
helicopter
that's four hours
long way
and i'll tell you something else
we're in a lot for the first time but
let me ask you something is this stage
not absolutely amazing
the crew in a lot the staff in a lot has
been absolutely wonderful this is one of
the nicest stages i've ever been on and
i've been on a lot of stages so give it
up for the crew here in eli israel
now listen everybody
the 80 women competing tonight
are role models and they radiate
confidence and charisma they're not only
the rising leaders of today they are
truly the inspirational leaders of the
next 70 years on behalf of everyone
involved with miss universe i want to
thank our host country for going above
and beyond to make sure that all coveted
health protocols were being followed so
that we could gather here safely in a
lot
now
the most exciting thing about tonight
is finding out which one of our 80
delegates will become the new miss
universe
and no one knows him better than our
correspondents miss usa 2019
extra tvs chesley chris and legendary
fashion icon carson crescent
thanks thanks steve throughout the
evening chesley and i will be bringing
you the inside scoop on the competition
and everything else happening tonight we
can see it all up here oh yeah exactly
we've done our homework and we're ready
to bring you in-depth analysis and
insight about the delegates and all
things miss universe and while we're
starting the night off with 80
contestants who come from every
continent except antarctica maybe next
year just 16 will be selected as
semi-finalists and move on to compete on
the stage this evening i'm getting
butterflies just thinking about it over
the next three hours we will find out
which delegate would be wearing these
stunning power of unity malwa crown i
might borrow that at the end of the
night me too but first here's a look
back at the interview and preliminary
competition that will help determine who
moves on to compete in tonight's
semi-finals
the most nerve-wracking part of this
whole process is today interview day
we're gonna do amazing the judges
interview is one of the most important
parts of the competition it's the
olympics of pageantry
the next three minutes determine
basically the next year and that
influences the rest of your life
the new help is these concepts we have
we just want someone that can be
authentic they know who they are they're
confident and they are willing to step
in the role for a year
they want to see you under pressure they
want to see how you handle yourself
[Music]
we are backstage about to go live for
the 70th miss universe preliminary show
and i am so excited
my nerves are jittering but i'm about to
live my dream that i've been watching on
tv forever and here we are
tonight our 16 semi-finalists will
compete on stage in the swimsuit round
then after another elimination 10 will
move on to the evening gown competition
where the field will be cut to a top
five yes and then next those delegates
will move on to the question round where
they're interviewed by the selection
panel and then three of them face off in
the final question round before taking
part in a final look then at the end of
the night a new miss universe will be
wearing that crown steve back to you

tough decisions to make for they will be

well
just some manta rays and green eye
barracudas let me tell you something
with my family when i was a child i used
to swim in the sea of seven colors in
this beautiful archipelago of san
andreas island and there's a myth
when uh
simone gonzalez a poet died
some barracudas cry
tears blue tears under the green moon

[Music]
singapore
[Music]
congratulations thank you steve thank
you so much well listen uh come on stay

uh singapore is one of the smallest
countries in the world how does it feel
to have made such a big impact here at

our fourth
semi-finalist is
[Music]
panama
[Applause]
congratulations thank you
[Music]
well i hear that you crashed a u.n
meeting in order to get a job once how
did you manage to do that ah shalom
israel
you know i believe in in god's calling
but i also believe it's up to us to
answer that call
so
when you're in an underdog situation i
think that you have to take that into
your own hands so i after years of
trying and failing to get to further my
advocacy and human rights at the united
nations i decided to hop on four flights
and go all the way to the other side of
the world put myself in the room and ask
for my chance
that led to me becoming a united nations
fellow for human rights so if you can't
find a seat at the table go ahead go
ahead and build your own
yeah thank you
thank you
[Music]

is
puerto rico
[Applause]

caribbean so you'll definitely love this
but to give you a little bit of context
bomba was developed by our african
ancestors so it's something that we use

way so i'll give you a little bit of
steps you first salute the drums salute
the drums and then you break your hip to
the right break your hip to the right

understand what is what is that
well steve have you ever visited the
bahamas all the time you know that
well you would know that for us manners
and respect is a big thing and so i've
decided to test the theory in my travels
i realized that a common
a common interaction that we have is
knowing that respect matters go a long
way and so it's my duty to teach my
clients the importance of having good
table manners formal dining overall

80 women came here with the chance to

south
africa
[Applause]

janisberg i love it there i love it
there
well competing at miss universe
uh was your childhood dream how does it
feel to be living that dream right now
it literally feels like christmas
morning to be honest right now but i
actually learned that dreams don't
happen by chance it's a culmination of
hard work dedication discipline but i'm
truly so grateful to be here
yes
thank you so much and congratulations
again well there it is everybody we now
know the top 16. give it up for the top
16.
well let's check in with uh
chesley and carson
i was a little bummed not to see israel
make the top 16. you always want to root
for the hometown girl but we do have a
very competitive group here especially
when you have someone as cheerful and
vibrant as vietnam up there
she's fantastic i'm praying she makes it
to the final round because her evening
gown is spectacular stunning back to you
steve
well whoever takes home the crown
tonight will be shouldering a lot of
responsibility and that's because miss
universe is more than a title
for in so many ways the women who wears
the crown represents all women their
aspirations their goals the unlimited
opportunities they have ahead and no one
understands that more than our current
miss universe
andre uh
meza
she's the one who fulfilled her duties
with determination and dedication poise
and professionalism and here are just a
few of the highlights from her
exceptional reign
miss universe is
when they said mexico i couldn't believe
it because the audience was so loud that
i thought it came from the audience you
ready for the journey i am it starts
right now let's go
as miss universe i have the opportunity
to talk with different women
organizations in the countries that i
have visited that's something that we
made a priority because of the situation
that i have experienced in my country of
the violence against women i grew up
watching that it's something that we all
live at some point of our lives that it
shouldn't be happening it's not okay we
supported this campaign to stop street
harassment a kind of violence so typical
that we don't see it as violence i also
had the opportunity to work with the
latino commission on aids and gaming
health crisis and i actually became the
godmother of the latino commission on
aids i am just so honored and so
thankful with miss universe for making
this happen our message and our platform
is touching people all around the world
and that's what's important for me
please welcome the reigning miss
universe andrea
meza
how are you
i am great i have to say that i'm a
little emotional
i would imagine so you know because you
were crowned doing a global pandemic
but still managed to achieve so much
over the past year what was the
highlight of your reign
well i think it's it's hard for me to
say just
one thing it was seven months but it was
a very intense period of my life
something that changed my life or
completely i would have to say that the
highlight was getting to work more with
this group of women and working towards
women rights and empowering other women
you know when you are in this position
you realize that you get the power to
inspire others with your actions and

more time
carson over to you
[Applause]
swimsuit competition i think venezuela
usa india and panama made excellent
showings now you may have noticed that
steve harvey isn't the only icon whose
style has changed over the years so have
fashion choices for miss universe
contestants since the very first pageant
in 1952 i was there now gowns and
swimsuits are different big hair and big
shoulder pads are long gone and we've
evolved to the wonderful porsche and
scarlet dresses you saw in tonight's
opening number but over the decades
regardless of the style worn by our
contestants or their sisters around the
world
fashion has always been a great way for
women to tell their
story swimsuits make a big hit with the
delegates she is a highly fashionable
young lady they appear absolutely
stunning on the runway the crown is
always crooked and they never put it
straight on you
you have the scepter and you have the
big
code
the fashion over the 70s it was
completely different it is 45 years ago
it is like ancient history
we didn't have two pieces we wore one
pieces
but they were so beautifully constructed
the swimsuits came down
way below the hip back in the 80s it was
big hair big makeup that evolved quite a
bit fashion changes and thank goodness
because well we thought we were cute it
was pilot jackets and a lot of shoulder
pads
and the hair
crazy
i think the 90s were like belly shirts
and you know bangs i was in the wrong
era
fashion changed trends changed and the
world has changed but the soul of the
miss universe pageant is still there
[Applause]
[Music]
well that was great uh
my wife actually designed this jacket
for the swimsuit competition the scarf
was supposed to
i was supposed to not look
but i'm 64 years old i don't have much
longer so i enjoyed it thank you for
having me
uh it's going to be a lot less crowded
as our super 16 are about to become the
terrific 10. it's miss universe live on
fox

where
i'm a citizen of the world you can crown
me miss universe now when we know our
history we can build better on our
future this really showed that we're not
that much different it's really in our
dna
[Music]
well fans all around the world all have
their favorites in the competition
but uh it's the selection panel that
decides who moves on and who does not
and this is not just a big moment for
contestants it's all so a big moment for
those around the world who place bets
on miss universe there are people who
place bets you've got to be
pretty surprised right now there's some
amazing choices left and if i was you i
would not be betting my children's
college fund on this because you have no
idea who the winner will be but as long
as i'm hosting everybody stands a chance
i've said the wrong name before so it
could happen
anyway
although all and you know what
you could be a little bit more lively as
a crowd that would help out okay so you
enjoyed yourself israel
huh thank you act like it here we go
although all 16 remaining contestants
are deserving only 10 of them are still
in the running to become this universe

beloved town of louisa i am working on a
double bachelor's degree in pre-med and

become the first doctor in the family
because i view health as a holistic way
of not only our physical health but our
internal health as well
i have worked with many people who have
suffered not only mental but physical
abuse
so you need to learn how to know
yourself love who you are respect

[Music]
usa
hi my name is elle smith and i miss
universe usa
at the end of the day people are my
passion i work as a reporter in
louisville kentucky so i've always loved
to write working as a journalist in
local news i know the importance of
journalism in society and we ask the
hard questions we get those answers and
we educate the community
so something that i'm extremely
passionate about every single day
my platform is cervical cancer education
and awareness due to my grandmother
passing away from cervical cancer in
2015 and we all know that grandmas are
the best and my grandma was my absolute
favorite person in the world i want to
honor her and gynological health is so
uncomfortable to talk about but it's a
necessary conversation
usa
moving on to our next round is
[Music]
india
[Applause]
miss universe india
well i'm doing masters in public
administration because i'm the youth of
my country and i'm keen to know what's
happening in my country and how it's
administrated
along with that i'm an actor and a model
and i've done two punjabi regional
movies and through following my passion
of acting i would like to inspire people
by choosing strong characters and
breaking stereotypes and stigmas well my
mother is my best friend she's a
gynecologist and she has multitasked her
life and broken the stereotype of
patriarchy system in my community and
now i'm looking forward to take the
legacy from
india
the fifth woman
in our top ten is
south africa
hello my name is
miss universe south africa and i am from
richards bay i've been dancing ballet
since the age of nine and that's where
my true essence is
my dad passed away 11 years ago leaving
my mom to raise my siblings and i
and i really saw the strength of a woman
and how tenacious and steadfast women
are it was so beautiful to have an
example like that in my mom and i
believe i am that woman today because of
her i decided to pursue a degree in
bachelor of laws because i've always had
a passion for women's rights because i
believe in women empowerment and those
are things that truly resonate with me
south africa
[Applause]
[Music]
earning the sixth spot is
the bahamas
my name is chantel o'brien and i am miss
universe from the bahamas and i live in
nassau
i am a pageant runway and etiquette
coach and i love being able to do it
because i know that it's an avenue to
inspire and motivate and empower women
to embrace who they are and know that
perfection doesn't exist
my platform is perfection is a myth and
it's really a framework and a design for
young people especially to know that
their journeys is going to be tough
sometimes it's not very conventional but
there are bridges to be crossed you know
and you can overcome anything that you
set your mind to
the bahamas
[Applause]
one step closer to the crown is
philippines
hello i'm beatrice luigi gomez miss
universe philippines from cebu city my
role model for women empowerment is my
mom
she raised me and my sister she was a
single mom and she showed me that the
challenges that you can go through in
life you will be able to overcome it as
long as you are determined and that you
are responsible for your actions i
joined the philippine navy reserve force
in the height of the pandemic last year
i did the basic citizens military with
the philippine navy first so when they
recruited me i submitted my requirements
right away and i joined the training i
joined the navy for a reason and that is
to help the most vulnerable communities
in my hometown in cebu city
philippines
[Applause]
three spots remaining
and one of them
will go to
france
hello my name is clemence boutino and i
am miss universe friends from paris i am
a student in history of art so my dream
job is to host and produce a tv show
about history and culture and make
history accessible for everyone i'm part
of an association which helps the women
who have been suffering from cancer and
disease it is about helping them in
their recovery to make them feel
confident and beautiful again
france is a really diverse country
actually i was born in a french island
in the caribbean sea i've lived on the
beach all my life i have another culture
through my island i feel that when you
are french you are like worldwide
actually and i'm really proud to be
french
friends
doing fine at number nine is
[Music]
columbia
hello i am valeria bosa miss universe
colombia from cartagena india i grew up
on an island by the ocean so i
understand the importance of taking care
of our nature specifically about plastic
pollution and how we can all do small
things such as reducing reusing and
recycling my father couldn't afford to
go to school when he was young so thanks
to a good mother he got that access and
improved his life and his family's life
so that's why i'm passionate about
education and i'm working for every
children that have the same opportunity
my dream is to become the minister of
education in my country one day
colombia
[Applause]
this is not easy
because there are seven women whose
names i haven't called and we've got
only one more spot left
the last contestant to move forward is
aruba
hi my name is tessly zimmerman i'm miss
universe aruba and i'm from costa
chiquito
i started playing tennis at the age of
six and i did this for about 13 years
where i got to represent aruba and
numerous international and national
tournaments i even got offered a tennis
scholarship to go study abroad
mental health is a cause that i'm very
passionate about because it's not only a
problem that's happening on aruba but
it's also a problem that's happening
worldwide the youth empowerment group
that i joined raises awareness it
empowers them but it also informs them
on this topic because they are the
future of tomorrow and for me that's
important to give them the knowledge
that they need to lead tomorrow
aruba
all right everybody let's hear it for
our top 10.
one of the challenges we face is climate
change let's take a look at what our
contestants are doing to help our
environment
the environment is very important
because it is the only home that we have
in our lives and it's time to take
charge and become involved in how
climate change is affecting our world
[Music]
i liked engineering and i wanted to find
a way to help the environment and more
professionally i decided to become the
ambassador of the anti-coalition
campaign in my country i want to
encourage other people to consume in a
more sustainable way everything is
connected as we all know it's a whole
ecosystem we have to work as a global
community to restore our environment
and that's why i realized how plastic is
affecting our oceans and our species
we are probably not able to do
everything in the world but you can
start in your community
we should leave nothing behind but our
footprints
[Music]

my god
ah
okay
[Music]
[Applause]
what
[Applause]
well we're back at miss universe
everybody and it's about to get real for
our top five this is the selection panel
question round which is how this
prestigious committee will determine the
final three each contestant is hearing
their question for the first time and
each one has only one shot to answer no
second chances no do-overs no mulligans
the way this round works is the
contestants will randomly select a name
of selection panel member that member
will then ask a question after the
delegate answers the next woman's call
will come forward and select who they
want to ask that question uh you've all
got 30 seconds to answer and when your
time is up you will hear this sound
all right interpreters will be provided
uh to those who require one so let's do
it
everybody ready
india is first
[Applause]
okay your question comes from reena
hi this india
hi miss reno
many people think climate change is a
hoax
what would you do to convince them
otherwise
honestly my heart breaks to see how
nature is going through a lot of
problems and it's all due to our
irresponsible behavior and i totally
feel that this is the time to take
actions and talk less because our each
action could either kill or save nature
prevent
and protect is better than repent and
repair and this is what i'm trying to
convince you guys today thank you
thank you
next up
is south africa
go ahead and pick your selection
panel question member
okay
[Music]
oh god
your question comes from
uravushi

shalom israel

paula and the entire miss universe
organization for this

hi miss south africa hello ma'am yes i
hope you're enjoying i really am are you

in their teenage years be held against
them years later
i believe that everybody should be held
accountable for their actions and if a
person doesn't know how to act on social
media they should be cancelled i believe
in cancer culture in the same breath i
also believe in redemption culture and
hoping that the person has matured and
has known better and done better i hope
that they could do better and be
redeemed
so i do believe that they can grow and
be allowed
a gap to do that thank you
thank you
really good

now are you ready for your question of
course okay
how can women best handle body shaming
body shaming
our body is our temple so we must take
care of it
our inner beauty is what's really matter
let's cultivate our inner beauty so it
can reflect to our external beauty thank
you
thank you
thank you
thank you
okay you're here for her too
colombia your turn
your question comes from laurie
hello miss columbia hello laurie you
look beautiful tonight along with the
rest of the contestants
and your father's jacket
you look nice too dad
okay
according to global citizen 95 of the
world's countries are led by a male head
of state
how would the world be different if more
women were in charge
leaders
women are leader by nature we have the
power to raise our voice and make
transcendental decisions in society as
role models make an example but not just
with words with action
that's why women raising our voice as in
this platform called miss universe we
are taking charge of our lives and
deciding what we want to
uh to the society in order to make it a
better one so women let's raise our
voice and make us a better
united universe thank you
thank you
and philippines you're up
go ahead
yes
your question comes from iris
hi eastends
hi miss series pleasure to meet you
pleasure to meet you too you know i love
your country so
my question is
given the ever-changing coveted
situation what is your opinion of
mandating a universal vaccine passport
bogertov
i believe that public health is
everyone's responsibility
and to mandate a vaccine inoculation is
necessary and if
mandating pass a vaccine passport would
help us
in regulating and
the rollouts of vaccine and mitigate the
situation of the pandemic today then i
would agree on mandating the necessary
passport of vaccination thank you
thank you
and thank you to the top five now listen
for everyone watching their answers
under pressure will determine who moves
on and who goes home so let's get some
reaction from carson
and chesley
you know i think this was a really
important part of the competition i mean
miss universe becomes a global
spokesperson an ambassador and you
really have to be able to articulate uh
tough questions exactly and i think all
these questions were very timely their
questions that miss universe could
expect in interviews on social media
from fans and so i don't see a clear
front runner based on these answers
right now so i'm interested to see what
the judges do and who advances to the
top three it's anybody's game when we
come back we'll find out which
contestants have earned that coveted
spot in the final three and then they
get their chance to answer one final

you've been working towards for years
and there's just one more challenge in

will become the next miss universe now
while one contestant answers the others
will be wearing soundproof headphones
it's a level playing field each one of
you has the exact same chance to win and
simply put it's up to you to rise to the
moment
you've each got 30 seconds to answer if
you go over the time you will hear this
sound

requested and that time will not be
counted in the 30 seconds
so headphones on
south africa come on over

[Applause]
what advice would you give to young
women
watching on how to deal with the
pressures they face today
i would implore young women today to
choose courage over comfort every
opportunity they get
i'd also like women to know that since
the beginning of time they've had
anything everything rather within them
to achieve anything they've wanted it
was unfortunately the world that
convinced us that we did not thank you
thank you
[Applause]
india please join me
here is the question
what advice would you give to young
women watching on how to deal with the
pressures they face today
well i think the biggest pressure the
youth of today is facing is to believe
in themselves
two
know that you are unique and that what
makes you beautiful stop comparing
yourselves with others and let's talk
about more important things that's
happening worldwide i think this is what
you need to understand come out speak
for yourself because you are the leader
of your life you are the voice of your
own i believed in myself and that's why
i'm standing here today thank you
okay
[Music]
paraguay please join me
[Applause]
here is the question
what advice would you give to young
women watching on how to deal with the
pressures they face today
so
i've been through so many hard
situations in my life
but i overcome it
so i want all women
all person who is watching in this
moment
to join forces to do what you meant to
do because you can do it no matter the
situation you can overcome it and you
can always be victorious thank you
thank you
well we have three ambitious women
all confident all uniquely talented now
while the selection panel is getting
ready to decide who answered it in the
best way befitting the next miss
universe let's check in with
uh
chesley and carson to get their
reactions
okay it all comes down to this final
question it's been neck and neck you
know i was rooting for paraguay queer
eye for the paraguay but
i think after that i think south africa
and india maybe had a stronger
performance in that final question i
have to agree with you i mean south
africa a degree in law as an attorney
girl i see you that was an incredible
answer i do not object
thank you i'm glad to know so well
carson i mean the time has come we're at
the end of the pageant i need to know
who is your winner i'm gonna say
india okay
any reason
i love that gown
that's shallow i know because she's got
good fashion sense i'm okay with that
you know i love i love the gown
yeah really well if i had to pick right
now i would say south africa okay why
like i said the attorneys we stick
together
and she gave a great answer that i think
resonates with a lot of people listening
at home agreed well coming up our three
finalists have one more chance to shine
one more chance to impress the selection
panel in the final look and then the big
moment we've all been waiting for as we
crown a new miss universe live on fox
last night the president of carnival
cruise line's christine duffy presented
the spirit of carnival award to miss
universe of the bahamas chantel o'brien
chantel and her miss universe sisters

attending next year's carnival cruise
[Music]
welcome back to miss universe
well to make it this far
our three finalists have gone through
the preliminaries the swimsuit
competition evening gown the selection
panel q a and the final question 80
began this journey in 70 70 77 are now
like us watching to see who is worthy to
wear the crown but there's one more
chance for our final three to impress
the selection panel
it's called the final look
and it could mean all the difference
between being a runner-up and becoming
the next miss universe
the final three will be joined by a
talented trio of singers performing
hallelujah in three languages english
hebrew and arabic
[Applause]
[Music]
what i've heard there was a secret quote
that david laid and he pleased the lord
but you don't really care for music
do you
it goes like this the fourth effect
the monofall the major lift the bathroom
composing
hallelujah
hallelujah
[Music]

[Music]
[Applause]
hallelujah
[Applause]
[Music]
her beauty and the moonlight
[Music]
her
she tied you to
a kitchen chair she broke your throne
and she cut your hair and from your lips
[Music]
hallelujah
[Applause]
[Music]
let's hear it one more time for our top
three
carson
chesley your thoughts wow how beautiful
was that like wiping tears off of each
other's eyes we were both up here
getting a little emotional yeah you know
any one of these three women could win
this very easily and i just thought that
was a great moment you know to show all
of these cultures coming together on
this stage it's a competition yes but
it's also a celebration of incredible
women doing amazing things all over the
world i couldn't agree more and this is
a special moment for whoever wins
whoever becomes you know the 70th miss
universe but the women who don't win the
other top two they made it to the top
three at miss universe and represented
their country as well so very excited
for all of these women i think it's
gonna be somebody from earth that wins
it always is it always is somehow biased
well we're just moments away from
finding out who will be our next miss
universe it's coming up live on fox
[Music]
stop it
tony dela rosa we have a few questions
who are you
how'd you know how to do that she's a
doctor you're illegal
i am my mother
she's just a help
you are trouble you're a thief it's fine
informant
specialist i did what i did to save my
son but this is not who i am
the cleaning lady series premiere
january 3rd on fox so the next young
lady who will be crowned miss universe i
would say to her
take it all in
never again in your life will you get to
have the whole world there
talk to people make friends really feel
that each one of you are a queen finally
you represent your wonderful country
you got to kind of remember it for
yourself write it all down like the
moments the little moments you'll forget
my advice would be find your voice find
your purpose and be honest and true to
yourself get interested in what's
happening in the world get interested in
what matters to you so when you do speak
you speak from your truth make sure you
maintain relationships with your sisters
like me
immerse in the experience because very
few women have this experience and enjoy
it life goes so fast
before you know it you're 77
