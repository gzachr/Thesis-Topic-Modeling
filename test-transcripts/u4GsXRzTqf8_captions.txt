No, no, no!
(lighthearted music)
What's up, everybody?
Good morning.
Good morning.
So getting Austin ready for school
practicing on the long
hair for Isla later.
Oh-ah!
Toughen up.
Look at that, turn around to the side.
Dang!
Do you wanna keep it up like that?
Yes.
Oh, look at it.
Oh, that's clean!
(laughing)
That didn't even hurt.
Yeah, it didn't even hurt, right?
Alright, we're good to go.
Yeah!
- [Rafael] What up?
What up?
- [Rafael] Ready for some breakfast?
Yes.
- [Rafael] What do you want?
Is there any eggs?
- [Rafael] I need to get
some eggs today, later today.
But what would you want
for breakfast, what else?
Egg and toast.
- [Rafael] I just said
we don't have eggs, bro.
Oh yeah.
(laughing)
So between options of cereal, bacon
eggs, which we don't have
this guy decides to go and
have this for breakfast.
(mumbles)
(laughing)
- [Rafael] All right go ahead
Start smacking away for breakfast.
Oh, big healthy breakfast.
Adrian look, oh yummy.
- [April] There's some blueberry in there.
Can you say blueberry?
Can you say blueberry?
- [April] Not that.
Such a monster.
Adrian can you say snake?
Snake.
(laughing)
Let me hear it again?
Snake.
Snake.
Where are you going?
I'm going to play.
- [Rafael] What?
Already?
Yeah.
(laughing)
All right so that's
part of breakfast here.
Now we're gonna get going
and take this boy to school.
We are going to school!
- [April] So later today after
school we're gonna go to cut.
What are we gonna film?
- [April] I don't know, you
have "Kids Try" videos I think
or maybe it's "Kids Describe."
Kids Describe?
- [April] Yeah you know
like how when you describe
something to Koji and then he draws it?
Oh yeah.
- [April] Yeah I think
it's that, I'm not sure.
So that should be fun.
All right, you ready for your school day?
Yes.
- [April] Yeah?
Oh man my socks are falling off.
Sorry!
I think I accidentally gave
him Adrian's socks this morning
that's why they're too small
and he's wearing rain boots.
So your socks will probably
be falling off your feet.
So I apologize.
(laughing)
I'll only forgive you if
you say it in Italian.
- [April] I apologize, I am so sorry.
I will feed you some spaghetti.
(laughing)
Love you.
Love you.
- [April] Okay, bye.
Bye-bye.
Overall, Austin is amazing.
He's an amazing big, big
brother, he loves it.
You know, Adrian is at that age
where he is constantly
pushing his brothers buttons
but at the same time, he's
like Austin's little lemming
he does everything that Austin does
so you know, if Austin
wants some alone time
he really can't have it
unless he goes somewhere else
and completely hides because
Adrian is just like a magnet
to him and he wants to do
whatever his big brother is doing.
Look there's school, Adrian, there he is.
And honestly most of the
time Austin is really good
about including him and they play together
and even when Adrian just like,
his monster side comes out
Austin is pretty, pretty
patient for a six-year-old.
I'm pretty amazed at how patient
he can be with his brother.
Hi babe!
Yay I just got picked up from school
now I'm heading to Cut!
- [April] How was school today?
Awesome!
- [April] Are you ready to tape, Austin?
Yes!
- [April] Yes!
Oh man it's raining.
- [April] Here we are.
- [Austin] It is raining!
- [Camera Woman] All right,
say, "See you next time?"
- [Austin] See you next time.
- [Camera Woman] Bye!
- [Austin] Bye!
- [Camera Woman] All
right you can leave now.
Not actually leave, but you can walk off.
All right that's a cut.
What did you just film?
The giant food.
- [Camera Woman] This is cool.
It's so soft you can pet him.
(laughing)
(children mumbling)
No!
- [April] Hey!
Stop it.
(Austin singing while Adrian screams)
- [April] Adrian, show me your smile.
(Adrian screams)
- [April] Oh man.
All right Austin, go
ahead and do a sit up.
(laughing)
Okay do a snake, how do you do a snake?
(hissing)
How do you do a turtle?
How do you do a bee, a bumble bee?
(buzzing)
Crocodile?
How do you do an owl?
(makes owl noises)
Adrian do you know what this is?
This one is?
A circle.
You are right.
Adrian what's this?
What's this, Adrian, what's this?
Triangle.
You are correct.
And what is this?
(laughing)
Say square.
Square.
- [April] Good job.
And now it's time for me to
sing you my favorite song.
A song?
Do I really have to sing a-
glug, glug, glug my face is a bug.
I eat ants for breakfast
right off the log.
(laughing)
The end!
Now read that.
Now we're done!
Time to go to bed.
No!
Okay he needs to go to bed
because he has school tomorrow.
- [Rafael] He has school in the morning.
Mmm, good night!
Okay go to sleep babe, love you.
Love you.
