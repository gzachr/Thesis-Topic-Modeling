i've never seen a tune up this size
before no i think this is pretty small
for a tuna is it
[Music]
when asking the question what is
filipino food
there's so much that's left out of the
conversation right as outsiders
i think we get a very limited picture of
what filipino food is we know the
typical adobo
because we have access to these things
on the outside but the philippines is
actually an incredibly diverse
place right and right now we're standing
in
farm or banks a more autonomous region
of muslim india now we never hear about
food from this region
we actually never really hear about the
muslim minorities in the philippines
true
how do you create a national identity
out of a group of people
spread across more than 7 600 islands
belonging to dozens of ethnic tribes
speaking nearly 200 different languages
oh yeah
and let's not forget religion the men
and women of the philippines received
that's a challenge the philippines faced
when it finally gained independence in
1946
after over 400 years of colonization by
spain
japan and the us but the problem with
forging one national identity is that it
might end up
excluding some people i guess the
question is
if you don't hear yourself reflected in
this larger
national narrative where does that leave
you
and what are the real life consequences
so we came to mindanao the southern
region of the philippines to find out
[Music]
i'm going to buy meat and i think
some coconut some chili for the dish
i think food that we serve is a crucial
part
of our identity as a people
[Music]
amir is a proud taosuk one of the 13
islamized ethnolinguistic tribes of the
moro people
for you to present this though so food
in the mainstream
i think most of the filipinos will feel
a bit
surprised that this is part of the
futile
food he's also part of the transitional
government of the new autonomous region
called bangsamoro
or barm it's the only muslim majority
area of the philippines
which is asia's largest catholic nation
so a lot of the produce here are coming
from different parts of
mindanao okay mindanao is the food
basket of the
philippines but for all its agricultural
wealth
this land of promise is a region that
remains the
poorest in the philippines we're drawing
a huge crowd
all right let's get out before we draw a
bigger crowd
sorry amir and his aunties will be
teaching us how to make tiola
a blackened coconut beef soup
[Music]
charred coconut paste is a special tau
saga ingredient
and it gives the soup its unique black
color
wow it's so it's so black
you can only find it it's celebration
food that's unlike any mainstream
filipino dishes we've seen or tasted
before
[Music]
oh my god it is spicy
but like i think this is my ideal level
of spice oh wow that's so good
yeah i really like the lemongrass inside
of it
all the suspense totally worth it i know
do you think that food from mindanao is
part of that national narrative of what
filipino food is
i think there's still a long way to
to achieve that it needs a little more
awareness promotion right the mainstream
filipino to appropriate food like this
that this is the southern
version of bulalo so i i think it's it's
not right to do that
right so taking their own names they're
familiar
because it really
[Music]
we have been marginalized in terms of
land position
of education or basic social services
and also the chance to mainstream other
aspects of our identity like food
like our dances and of course first and
foremost the marginalization of our
history as a people
there is a written history of this
country
that does not represent the history
of my people mindanao's history
might look different depending on who
you ask
when you talk about you know philippine
history it
is only recently now that there's a
recognition
of the muslims or the bangsamoro
contributions
this is aldine alonto he studies
conflict resolution
and bangsamoro history for many moro
tribes
this is a story of resistance against
various colonizers and the filipino
government
it's a story of marginalization for some
like the indigenous and muslim
people displaced from their lands in the
early 1900s
the american colonizers and the
subsequent filipino government
encouraged christian filipinos to
resettle in mindanao
through a series of agricultural
policies
by the 1970s mindanao was no longer a
muslim majority island
when history as well as national
policies
were carried out they were left out
and that created insecurity and
precisely that's why some muslims or the
bangsamoro feel that they are
second-class citizens
and it's very hard to work in in in a
country in a government
that you don't feel like you're part of
it historically and politically
so separatist groups like the moro
national liberation front
and later the moral islamic liberation
front took up
arms to fight for an independent muslim
state
but even after the first autonomous
region was established in 1989
bloodshed continued during the half
century of conflict
brutal violence was inflicted on all
sides
an estimated 120 000 people died and
over 2 million were displaced
many peace talks later bangsamoro
autonomous region of mindanao was
inaugurated
in early 2019.
many banks tomorrow are
curious at the same time apprehensive
and
vigilant to to what will happen to barn
because
past experience with arm there was a
little in terms of
changing their lives when i say there
should be a legitimate self-criticism
local politicians
local constituency within the muslim
area
needs to flesh out their own
and you might be asking what any of this
has to do with food
but marginalization comes in many forms
that food from this region is foreign
even to filipinos themselves
is a symptom of a larger issue why do
you think there's been so little
like documentation of the foods here in
the past
the conflict in mindanao superseded
everything that is
good about the planes we will not talk
about for example
and the local food because it you know
the conflict is everything
tend to be centered on that marawi
is a good example whatever you've heard
about this northern city of mindanao
probably has to do with the siege
in may 2017 isil-affiliated militants
tried to claim the city as an
isil territory the government responded
by deploying troops and using aerial
bombardment
[Music]
after five bloody months the city center
was destroyed
marawi made international headlines and
many came to associate this region with
terrorism
the images of death and destruction
burned into memory
[Music]
the devastated city center which came to
be known as ground zero
remains in ruins two years later
[Music]
it's crazy this is like a ghost top
everything is still here the same way
that it was left and
you can see plants growing out of the
bullet holes on the walls
yeah it's like they're like reclaiming
the land that everyone else has kind of
just
abandoned i mean what i notice are the
graffitis on the walls that says pipe of
property
and yellow signs that says no consent
demolition from it
so much of the reconstruction efforts
has been stalled and i guess there's a
lot of like
mistrust between the residents and the
government that if these buildings were
demolished like they wouldn't have any
right to return to their land
oh my god
like how do you rebuild after something
like this
i just got such crazy chills
[Music]
when people living here fled they
assumed they would return to their homes
when the siege was over
two years later many like hayamara still
live in evacuation camps
temporary refuge turned into
semi-permanent homes
have you been back to your home since
the siege
first visited
[Music]
so do you have any expectations of
returning home
anytime soon
[Music]
the impact of the siege has seeped into
every aspect of life here
the martial law has been in place since
then not just in marawi but on the whole
island
checkpoints militaries and curfews have
become a part of everyday life
even access to food changed because the
commercial center was destroyed
the markets still haven't been fully
restored according to our local producer
ace she was born in marawi city
so this food stalls used to be located
in padilla and one of the biggest
markets in moravia city that's located
in ground zero
but because of what happened they were
forced to relocate which goes to shows
that the siege did not only cause people
to be displaced but also the food market
which affects the ability of people to
access their food
but at the same time as you can see the
city is still very vibrant
i think it's one of the strengths of
marina being able to adjust the
circumstances
and you can see this resilience
everywhere
ace invited us to her favorite place to
taste traditional marinal food
her home ace could you introduce
us yeah yeah sure so this her name
is zoraida but we generally call her
bubble like everyone in the house and in
this street
because she is like the bubble of
everyone
babo is an affectionate term to describe
an older woman
kind of like auntie so is bobo the best
cook around
are you bubble yes
we were gonna learn how to make pia para
a manok
or chicken coconut stew first she's
gonna make a palapa
and what's panata palapa is an essential
part of every meal it's like the
seasoning of marinara
it's a mix of grated coconut spices and
sakura
white scallion native to this region
palapa can be used as a marinade
a condiment or even an appetizer
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
and like in other moro cuisines coconut
and turmeric play
major roles so what's the significance
of turmeric powder
this dish is cooked in coconut twice
once boiled in fresh coconut milk
and then stir-fried with grated coconut
there's just something so pleasurable
about the sound of like the bubbling and
sizzling
when you open up the pot
[Music]
i think it's because it also signals to
us that like
food is almost yeah exactly
because the maranaos are people of the
lake chicken and meat are typically
reserved for special occasions
and this was quite the spread they
prepared for us
[Music]
okay i think we should try the one that
we did first we usually use the soup
mix the soup with the rice okay
it's very delicious how do i save it's
very delicious in my
mate
why is it important for your food and
your culture to be represented
the importance isn't about getting clean
for the culture in this tradition it's
about letting them know that this is
this tradition is filipino too babu was
here during the siege ace was away at
school
but whether or not they experienced it
firsthand every mara now felt the impact
especially in how they were perceived
after
the ideologies that we used to not
tolerate
like some people are usually hesitant to
say that
muslims are dangerous or marines are
dangerous but after the siege
it becomes easier for them to express
that in many ways
by verbally or just like by kind of
actively discriminating
the marines that they meet because now
they feel like because the siege
happened and it was caused by a muslim
like probably all other muslims are like
that so which is sad because we are the
victims but at the same time we have the
obligation to prove that we are not the
perpetrators as well
the non-verbal
[Music]
thank you for coming here without fear
that's what she said
that's because when mindanao is in the
news it's often
about the kidnappings terror attacks and
isil
conflict sells and that leaves little
room to explore the rich history
and culture of these islands but that's
slowly changing
what time is it food time
i actually looked at my watch
like actually what time is it we had
lunch with chef dr sharif pendatun
he writes about food from mindanao
introducing these flavors to the
mainstream philippines which one is it
the tuna soup tuna broth okay you guys
don't mind msg no
no okay it probably has a lot of it
okay so this would be the senina okay
this is and then this is the kilauea
the people of the floodplains and the
largest moro tribe
when you ask someone what you're having
for dinner he'd ask
what fish are you having so you see the
significance the relevance of fish
in our diet and culture so how do you
say it
um so literally what's your fish
what's your fish yeah what's your fish
what's your fish
but we're not here to talk just about
the uniqueness of food from this region
rather than focusing solely on
differences he wants to look at food as
a free-flowing exchange of ideas
and influences okay this is the kilo
incoming
again this is not you know this is not
magenta
it's not um so it's an introduction but
it has become part of the repertoire
this mode of preparation i believe came
from the ilocanas from the north
um this is called trinola or tola
it's a visayan thing so but we do i mean
in magenta now you can call this dinda
because there are a lot of
science here actually i would have never
imagined tuna in a clear soup like this
me neither
i guess i'm just so used to having
canned tuna
or sashimi tuna thank you the dishes we
were eating
all embodied a blend of different
backgrounds much like datu
my grandfather was born here and then he
married someone from the north
in luzon my dad the same thing so my mom
isn't from here as well
so i got to have a taste or
a glimpse of a world you know a
different world
i try to integrate these things into the
stuff that i do
when i cook when i write all these
different markers of identity
must be complicated to navigate um it is
quite complicated um but
again um we can make it less complicated
and simplify it
these things matter um as you know as
hallmarks or as um
illustrations of our culture and our
past and all these things but
ultimately all of us have to eat all of
us you know
just need the same basic things
there's a really like thin
line between embracing and being proud
of your heritage
and also using that as a way to exclude
and a way to differentiate
a lot of push for self-determination
often comes from people who have been
told for so long that you are this you
are this you are this
and so a lot of like reclaiming seems to
happen with these kind of oppressed
groups
but then when you go so far the other
way then it just continues the
polarization
who has the power to change these things
is a completely different
question altogether
a nation is a story a story we
collectively believe in
that binds together a group of people
within an imagined border
but this story shouldn't be about just
one protagonist
maybe it shouldn't even be one story
i don't believe that there's such thing
as
on one version of a filipino i feel like
the fact that the philippines is a
multicultural community itself is what
makes it filipino
it's continually changing it's not
stagnant because if it's stagnant
eventually that's the death of any
identity
because those we exclude suffer real
life consequences
[Music]
and when we exclude we lose out on so
much
is it ready i'm gonna give us a clap
there you go okay
hey guys thank you so much for watching
this episode of fork the system in the
philippines

philippines that we had never even
