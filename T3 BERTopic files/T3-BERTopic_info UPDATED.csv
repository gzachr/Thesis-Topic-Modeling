about pesos Ill change his Ive got to say having a scooter makes a huge difference Oh change for me is like Thats easy super efficient I do my own oil changes though all no mechanic Hmm They pump they pump your get the hood of they pump your gas for you in the Philippines Yeah I really go on defeat which as far as I know is only offered in Asia offers mindblowing fuel efficiency On average it gets about miles per gallon So its three liters for pesos Roughly every month I pay pesos for gas now that is hard to beat Thats impossible to beat a month Lets try somewhere between on it somewhere between that somewhere between that it depends on much you drive to be honest it differs And he got a and its a Honda bike Hondas good I feel like I feel like I will have the time of my life Another thing I have to take care of today is my visa for the Philippines So Im now at another shopping mall about minutes away from my place Uhhuh and inside they have a field office for the Bureau of immigration Okay so Im going ahead and show you exactly how Im able to stay here legally Let me see this Hello Hello Let me watch my video ads thats all Im trying to do make sure you dont skip the ads So So when I first arrived in the Philippines prior to the pandemic Uhhuh its given a stamp at the airport or a visa on arrival Which allowed me to stay in the country under a tourist visa for a little less than a month I think days to be exact But if a foreign visitor decides to extend their stay in the country just like I did The Philippines Bureau of immigration offers two months and six month extensions And these can be obtained over and over For six month extension is only offered in Manila So I choose to give an extension every two months at this field office Yeah just extension Thank you very much All I have to do is fill out a small form with my information provide my expiring visa and passport pay the extension fee at the cashiers desk and then wait about two hours to retrieve my passport and New visa extension document Normally I just grab a bite to eat and do a bit of shopping in the mall to pass the time Today Im paying two cards It one is the typical extension fee of pesos And another one is a yearly fee that you have to pay for an i card Its an identification card for foreigners here and that is pesos dollars okay I usually end up paying about pesos per year for immigration charges and Visa extension fees for dollars really isnt that bad Its not its not in some other day You have to completely leave and come back for visa renewal every so often Im thankful I dont have to go through that hassle Yeah thats good Well that was pain free After turning in my forms a few hours ago I now have my Passport and official document showing that my visa is valid for another two months There you go There you go Its that easy Thats simple Lets take a few hours Its still our whole day ahead of you I think that has to be the cheapest amount Ive ever paid for parking pesos cents Wow how many malls is out the Philippines I mean malls is all here Central Park tower Thats nice Five of visit here you will see me up here I dont know where he at but you will see me over here bro Youll see me in this pool This is nice You Pint house hotel This is nice', 'There is a cluster of islands that looks like one of the most beautiful places on Earth The Philippines People have been living here for over years traveling between these islands trading with each other and with the region and developing religion identity and culture It eventually became a country called Mai And while all of these advancements were happening here on these islands another group of humans had been evolving in another part of the world over here in New York But this other group had a different culture a different religion Many of their advancements were achieved through expansion not collaboration Youre amazing And their religion thrived when they stomped out others They wanted to conquer These islands these people this culture would soon be swallowed stripped of what made them them And soon their name would be changed after the name of the king of their conquerors This isnt a story I see It drives from the Kings Phillips too from Spain Now thats why its Philippines I see This is an interesting fact Its just about a big powerful military taking over new lands We know that story pretty well The story of these people offers a new perspective to anyone who will listen Its a perspective that has been wiped from our history books Because of the inherent discomfort and tension with this fact that the United States once a colony that heroically threw off an empire to become independent soon became an empire itself It contradicts our founding belief that it is quote evident that all men are created equal And this story isnt just history That empire still exists today with colonial possessions and subjects Its all wrapped up in the story of these islands and their people So I want to tell you the story of how the US stole the Philippines There are still American citizens today who do not have equal voting rights These are citizens of America whos high on territory The US Constitution grants a citizenship to everyone who won the royal exile in one jurisdiction So theyre going to focus on the ages after Spains colonialization right Okay This video could be called how Spain stole the Philippines And it was the first nation to conquer and control these islands like years ago Actually exactly years ago And indeed Spain left a very deep influence on these islands not least the name itself which is named after King Philip Spain brought their religion their language their culture Which is why the most common last names in the Philippines are like Reyes or Del Rosario de la Cruz Del Los Santos But the heyday of the Spanish Empire came and went And by the s it was kind of crumbling But it was the arrival of a new superpower that I believe had a bigger imprint Not just on the Philippines but on the US itself It established rules and behaviors that we still grapple with today And thats why this is the story of how the US stole the Philippines So lets go', 'Were back from the buffet We got all this delicious authentic Filipino food So they also gave us some complimentary water Or do we have to pay for this No its not free They even got

native to the country the being the National Language Filipino an official variety of the Tagalog language coofficial agreement thats it right there Thats it right there With the languages native to the country the being the National Language Filipino an official variety of the Tagalog language coofficial language Tagalog language Tagalog language So that was the language that we have recently learned about in the Philippines Yeah Okay Well get in some of you From an alongside English I guess its a little like how Indonesias National Language also to the United Groups speaking hundreds of native languages across the diverse archipelago nation is a Malaybased dialect called Indonesian With English being an official language alongside Filipino and thus being a mandatory subject in the school while Spanish has no longer been required for decades now the Philippines technically has the forced largest population of English speakers in the world with over native speakers and around million speakers So its more native and English Less Spanish Another thing Ill say Filipino Yeah but Filipino right so okay We get in some way yall Yeah Yeah Total The Philippines is one of the very few countries in Asia to have Christianity as its major religion I probably dont need to tell you this because colonialism Before they were taken over by the Spanish though the Philippines were largely Islamic and Hindu before that and early folk beliefs before that and part of Pangea before that Back in the th century an explorer named Mahdum Karim left his province in Malaka bringing Islam to the Philippines He converted the Hindu king Raja Baginda of the Sultanative Sulu to Islam no Star Trek fans that is not a coincidence and then marrying his daughter just for good measure Islam became increasingly popular after this conversion following an inflow of Muslim traders from the Middle East Malaysia and India Today the oldest mosque in the country is named after him but just years later another influential guy would show up in the Philippines His name was Ferdinand Magellan When it comes to colonialism the Philippines is sort of like a reverse Thailand When Magellan came to the islands in he claimed the archipelago for the Spanish crown naming it after his friend Phil Then he was shopped by an arrow and figured out kills on the island of Maktan Three further expeditions were sent all lending a disaster With Miguel Lopez de la Gaspi establishing the first Spanishstyle arrow and figured out kills on the island of Maktan Three further expeditions were sent all Actually it was there in these later expeditions After the Philippines One of the island was named after Phil Oh Okay Okay', 'Showing I was just your eyes Yeah thats the same working Yeah No its working Oh its

Im today Im going to speak in languages he has a language for every year that he was born that is impressive Tagalog uh thats insane though he speaks so well as well like I just wonder what language your thoughts are in at this point you know you could just go and just flow it all together what language do you think in yeah the age of six I was taught the English language it is a second language of the Philippines and so we were taught English the English language here in the Philippines in like in the first grade and up to college I think so that is why I think English is a language that I most comfortable speaking with because you know Ive studied a lot of years Im fluent in it and I could speak with any English speaker in the world learning languages wasnt in my mind and its like its the last thing I could do but at the age of I knew I wasnt considered with only two languages thats pretty crazy Spanish as well man I wonder what led him down this road to learn all of these languages at he was not content with only speaking two languages and thats beautiful he decided on his own that hes gonna I need to speak more languages these subtitles are autogenerated it looks like so theyre not going to be like perfect okay not going to be perfect but well be able to get the gist yeah of what hes saying um yeah lets just turn these off this is opening it for me Im like its Rihanna what I just wanna cheese gosh what is YouTube doing yeah a difference did he just say he learned over the internet I I heard the internet I dont know what he said but thats insane if he said that similar Filipino language is similar to Espanol a little bit thats what I heard thats what you heard at the end thats what I heard you dont know I heard what I heard okay let me know if I heard right okay the Filipino language is similar to the the Spanish language I mean honestly a lot of these languages could vimilar because its like once you I feel like once you learn you learn its kind of like theyre not all like similar theyre not like all similar words but I mean especially Italian French and Spanish they were talk they were taught to us in school like their similarities in their words but I dont know I dont know I dont know what I mean back in a few hundred years ago these different countries that were well established went and conquered and settled like all over the world and like forced their belief systems and their languages on other cultures so it wouldnt be surprised like surprising for me to learn that theres a lot of mixture between the languages like that what in the world it sounded again like it was theres some similarities yeah definitely between the languages I heard some words like I kind of want to play a game with myself to see if I can tell if theres any words I dont know any of these languages languages guys we need to this is so inspiring this is so inspiring that is amazing man Italian he said he learned it on Facebook Im pretty sure I heard Facebook if any Im not trying to be offensive I promise Im just joking yeah Im in a bit of a jovial mood this evening as well so Im not trying to offend if I offend anybody I apologize just joking but I swear he did say I learned it on Facebook because you know Italian hello France and hes doing all this with like sitting in a bathtub with a shower curtain behind him you dont know that and I heard um a rooster I did I wonder if he lives New Roland okay we just got done listening to Roland yeah you are the reason and his chickens were trying to sing with him it was beautiful it was awesome beautiful thats crazy man I watched UFC for a very long time they have a lot of international Fighters and I will watch like prefight postfight press conferences and a lot of them you know they they just speak their native language and you have to get The Interpreter to interpret it so Ive Ive heard people speak all of these languages and his his dialect seems to be so perfect like his pronunciation of the words like it seems so well it seems so good its still I yeah as soon as hes speaking it its like you close your eyes and youre like somebody whos from that that speaking that language comfortably all the time is speaking to you like what German oh this reminds me Brothers yeah Jesss brother actually speaks German yeah I wish she was here right now he could tell us how well he he speaks it yeah he could tell us that and tell us what hes saying I Im freaked out if you have a deep voice and you uh speak German Im freaked out okay its like watching a horror movie it does it does come off very aggressive Its a Spooky language yeah especially the deeper your voice it is spooky dude is the lighter your voice the more Im okay with it okay your brother has a bit of a deep voice yeah he does and but and some German guys they have such deep voices I know you guys know what Im talking about if you hear a very deep voiced guy talking German Im out of there you not youll look around and look for me Im gone okay hiding under her blanket shaking make it stop angles and you can express more fluent it was the weirdest one so far the way that they enunciate some words like what in the heck that is crazy this is so impressive what did that say Africans I did not know that was a language thats crazy I yeah I havent heard of that now Afrikaans its my lifting that is crazy Esperanto I havent heard of that these are were getting into languages that I didnt even know existed now this is insane this is crazy because hes not just saying like words just like random words like yeah hes speaking to you literally having like the conversation hes talking about that specific language maybe but hes literally having sentences it sounds like hes explaining why or how he learned it yeah and what the differences are like hes singing or saying this is so crazy and so mindblowing and so inspirational so cool what now were on the Indonesian Gracia what okay so question for people who are multilingual does the because I learned Spanish in French but I literally didnt take advantage of it in high school I just was like there to get the grade and get out of there but like when you learn a language is it easier to understand it after you learn it or is it easier to learn it after you understand it like when somebody speaks to you if you can understand what theyre saying is it easier to learn it after that or is it easier to learn it once youve already learned the language Ive always been curious about that or maybe its different for different people but I dont understand the question maybe Im just not meant for being multilingual but like so when when youre speaking another language to me if I can understand every word youre saying before I even know how to speak the language back to you would that make it easy accessible you can still like learn I dont know maybe maybe its not possible I dont know but Im just like saying like yeah see my brain is too small for that question maybe it was a dumb question you never know maybe the question was to super dumb and now your brain cant process it because its a dumb question I really am curious and I would like to know what you guys think I try to take Spanish in high school they just kicked me out of the classroom like sir your tongue its not shaped correctly you could just leave now about Spanish classes Im not gonna try it my tongue shes very adamant about my tongue gets swollen when I try just it gets beat up in my mouth for some reason dude Im so ooh Russian I like it is dude he can go everywhere he wants in the world so thats awesome our friend Adina is from Romania is uh and shes a twin which is beautiful I like that foreign how many is this so far I dont know I got lost after like three are you kidding me oh my goodness Im just mindblown by all this this kid is incredible foreign I want to see a video where he like went around to all of these countries and just randomly walks up to somebody and starts switching between languages or something be so fun their faces would probably be like Philippines okay his brains starting to freeze up Im just kidding dude that sounds like the hardest language ever are you kidding me is insane I cant thats insane I cant wait what did that say I it went to is it a Filipino right a Philippine language Philippine yeah yes okay together so thanks for watching I hope I have said the right words and if I have made mistakes Im sorry Im not really fluent in all of them so thats its just a practice so thank you very much thank you thank you that is awesome Ive said this multiple times in our videos because we will have people who will take the time to write in English even though its not their first language and at the end they always say Im sorry my English isnt that good and Im just like you should not apologize no that is incredible you should be so proud of yourself on our Channel just know you dont ever have to apologize for anything like that no we are like humbled by your incredible talent to be multilingual yeah you should be so proud of that I I want to be I want to have at least bilingual I at least want to learn one other language besides English but I just think its so cool and so amazing that you take the time to to to like hone those skills yeah of all the skills that you can learn in this world like I know how to do a few things really well but to learn a completely different language and then you learn another one and then another one and then another one another one another one another way all the way to who cares if youre fluent in all of them why you are freaking doing a great job yeah that is amazing that is unbelievable that blows my mind because not only that like they have all different kinds of like styles to save them like I oh my gosh my brain would just go I would just be melting I dont know because I would try so hard I would think about it first of all the overthinking would just get me and Id freeze and everything that I was saying but like that was so impressive I cant oh that was awesome Ive asked I used to work a lot of construction and I worked with a lot of Spanish speaking people and I was just like okay you speak English really well what do you thinking what thoughts what are your thoughts in youre like well it depends sometimes its easier to think in English sometimes its easier to speak uh to to think in in Spanish it depends on the phrase because I guess some phrases are like just easier to get out in English some are easier to get out in Spanish or whatever language you speak so its just like once you learn so many and you do become fluent in them like what language do you think its just its always been a question that Ive had it on I never even thought to think like that question thats an interesting question though for sure because its like thinking is such a instantaneous thing so you look over there at something youre like oh a red shirt yeah or oh this movie trailers on oh this thing its just like some things like how does that work I dont even know my mind is just boggled by this whole entire thing yeah now Im even more confused thank you very much that was incredible shout out to you friend yeah this video up on his own channel were going to include a link to this original video yes we definitely are um Marilyn Ramos yeah wow we are subscribing right now yeah for sure like the video wow that was freaking incredible that is so cool I Im in awe thats insane ah he can understand its been two years already Im afraid that he even learned some language from Another Universe keep going yeah this guys limit he can understand the memes in other languages hes too powerful its too freaking funny that

yourself as a Portuguese keep it up so you will have a beautiful future in your life hugs from Lisbon Portugal that is so cool such a cool freaking comment section right here because I agree with it this one not only does he speak different languages but he can also mimic accents of the other languages yes that is so amazing thats what I was so impressed with like thats what you said in the thing he could he can speak the different dialect is that what that you would call it like because when you you speak the language and then you speak that certain dialect of how the how it sounds like yeah were not even familiar with the wordings of being multilingual okay so let us know yeah please he definitely got the accents right he definitely had the freaking as a Korean and English native speaker he did well in speaking Korean Im amazed that he got all the grammar right good job awesome this is a cool comment section wow hi Marlon youre so talented learning many foreign languages I love when

'christmas celebrate', 'celebrating christmas', 'merry christmas', 'merry christmas happy', 'christmas christmas', 'christmas merry', 'december christmas']","['Anyway were at the top of the hill and by my voice you can see I change my breathing pattern But as everyones aware at this time of the year it is Christmas in the Philippines and everywhere else around the Christian world and as a result different things are celebrated different ways of celebrating They all have their different ways locked into tradition Whether the traditions here and the Philippines which is sort of driven probably by marketers pushing their wares at this time of the year Hello having to buy a big spread of food to put on the table for the th of December which is traditionally the Catholic time when we eat our food after midnight on Christmas day because we will have attended in their mind midnight maths which is a massive following here in the Philippines But one of the things which is sad because the Philippines is one of those places where the corruption and Im not saying the corruption of the country in terms of politics officials Im not referring to any of that because thats everywhere in the world But Im talking about the innocence corruption in the world where so many things happen because were forced by people making the decision that we must do this and we must do that But there are different reasons and one of them is of course Christmas even for a poor family they still will have some food special food It might be just one orange could be a bunch of bananas whatever it is its a demonstration and a symbol of their devotion to celebrate Christmas here in the Philippines and to sort of verify and make it seem more real they take photos of the family around the table with the plentiful food maybe just a big bowl of pancit Bahon for everybody to have and to eat and to enjoy on Christmas Eve The idea of giving gifts is often a very small gift because of the value of buying gifts for everybody in the family is pretty hard So the idea also is to just carry out the symbolism of Christmas a time of sharing time with the family time reflection in religion some might say time to be hypocritical because whilst some have got enough to feed themselves many here in the Philippines dont have that luxury and therefore Christmas is just another day for them a day where they have to find and locate a meal some kind of food to nourish themselves and its not always easy because in the Philippines it is illegal to actually beg so there are some people who will punish those poor people for trying to get a few pesos for a meal Ive never really understood it but as a guest in their country its not for me to ponder on it too much therefore we wont go any further on that subject but you know somebodys started to build a home looks like theyre proceeding a little bit further theres a small house very small house but its a home this is one thing about the Philippines is that you can have a piece of land and you can develop it virtually building codes are on paper and theyre generally followed through common sense rather than regulation nobody wants to spend harder on money on something that will fall down and be of no use anymore or have to be retrieved and rebuilt again these are lovely pieces of land here for building a pole house but people dont quite see it the same way oh look somebodys it looks like somebodys doing something here theyre putting in a dug out the footings so somebody is again building something here every day theres always something going on here in the Philippines and Im very grateful for all of you guys and girls who follow my channel and subscribe and make some wonderful comments they spur me along for my thought for the day some wandering chickens whereas your home he said but if you live in these parts of Cabaretanso or Cabaretan Norte you may find yourself walking down roads like this to different areas that Ive never really explored but the offer and the opportunity is here as a foreigner we have time on our hands we are none of us know for how long but it opens up all kinds of possibilities for our life to be nourished by such things as beautiful trees lovely photographic areas foods for thought and were now going down the hill my goodness Ive got to walk back up this one too but I have never walked down here before but they look like theyre putting in a little bit of infrastructure here to make this area a bit safer for landslide because they put in a great big retaining wall and it looks like their family are building another home alongside what is another very modern home here in Cabaretan Norte somebody is spending a lot of money I think so nice big retaining wall along the front of their property you see you can wander around your own area when youre in the provinces and refresh your mind your spirit everything just by having a little walk you can have a little bit of exercise a bit of nourishment for your eyes and time to reflect all these things or even being run over by a van only wide enough for one vehicle at a time but this is the joy of just living your retirement here in the Philippines all of the other issues that weve discussed become again just part of ones daily challenges time when we can reflect on did we make the right decision I dont think any of us who have finally decided to come here would turn the clock back and not come here because to do so would be true first of all admit failure which none of us want to do that but also we would be missing out on our final years in a place where we can relax enjoy and just simply soak up the feelings and views not only visual but also points of view of others around you the friendly filipina the friendly filipina faces the beautiful ladies all of these things that mean something in our lives so if you like this video dont forget to like share and subscribe and I do hope you have a lovely Christmas no

to just in general be confident about who you are and what you bring to the table just before you even date because I feel like the source of problems in a relationship come from insecurities and you know doubt right Which is stem from insecurities And I feel like if youre confident in yourself youre confident you know who you are and what you want right Im not saying that you know you should be picky or anything like that Like go out meet people go on dates get to know people really like you know understand them Dont just make you know first second judge Dont make judgments based off like snap judgments right But if youre in a relationship and you realize that you know youre putting in more effort and it just Theres a lot of red flags and stuff You can go ahead and you know decide and like oh it seems as though theres a lot of red flags here Im going to go move to a different country or a different different country Because Im assuming the flags are planted in the country of the person youre dating right Like you know Liz you know our country So like lets say Im a country you know I have a much of red flags planted on me You go you know what Im going to go to a different country It seems like theres a lot of red flags here Right I dont know if thats going to catch on But But like because I think right now were talking about relationships and stuff but like more so just dating No I feel like more people are justcopy like dating Its kind of hard to find someone whos actually looking for like a serious relationship And with dating apps being such like a big thing now theres one more tender I dont know whatever the fuck out there is Its kind of like weird when you act to meet someone whos like investing time and effort Effort is a big thing where you know you dont even see anymore And Hensers is like cultured I noticed when it comes to especially with like I cant speak much for like Filipinos because I dont I dont really They a lot of Filipinos not because I dont want to but just because like full Filipinos Because I dont know the situation never presented itself But Ive noticed with foreigners though theres like this I dont know if you guys can agree Theres this thing where youre like oh theyre just foreigner How do we hear for too long Youre my very programmed that you know this is just like a hook up or a fling And whatever happens happens I think for you two though because you guys might have bumble right So how did you guys know that oh this is more than a hook up I mean I think I think that starts with me you know I hate to take the claim I hate to take the fame and all the glory here I wont go back Well discover that later But I mean I went into it like I was on Bumble I was on Bumble because I was bored and also lonely right Like everyone else who goes on dating apps right This is everyone okay Im not special here But I mean I always approach it with that like if Im gonna go and actually spend the time to go and swipe and meet people I dont wanna just be like wasting At least for me I didnt wanna spend time just looking for hookups and stuff I would go for people who I felt like oh I could actually see something more than that Now if I ended up being a hook up and didnt have anything else past that you know thats fate right I didnt look for that And I feel like generally speaking now at least from all the dudes Ive talked to all the dudes theyre looking for hookups Theyre not looking for relationships And thats why a lot of people cant find relationships Its not just the dudes that also girls right Some people go on the dating apps because theyre looking to satisfy their urges Theyre looking to satisfy their urges Theyre you know theyre horny All those reasons right And its easier right And its easier right Because theres other people on the other side who are looking at the same exact thing Its a transaction right You go hey Im horny Youre a horny You know lets meet up right They just send you up text You know this is according to my guy friends right And then that happens just like that right And so I think that a lot of the problem is that like dating apps have become synonymous with hookups Its not like theyre not synonymous with relationships Because I feel like if there was a different you know vision different you know whats the word Im looking for Different impression upon the dating apps I dont think thats the right word But it still gets a point across And then people would be finding more relationships Because people are still finding relationships Theyre still getting happy and stuff Some of them start from hookups right And some of them start from like bar get together and stuff But so people are still looking for them Its just that when people are on like an application and their whole you know gold areas for hookups youre going to end up with a lot of hookups Thats just sort of the nature of it right', 'Okay There is one country in the world that has taken for granted more than any other place This country is home to the kindest individuals with an incredible love for life Theyre responsible for inventing video calls baby insulators for rural areas And they also play a massive role in the invention of chips that we use in so many of our confused videos today I have no idea This country has citizens living all over the world to help you and I to help the elderly the sick the poor and many of them go totally unnoticed Very true And I told you that they are taking for granted a meeting with scarce opportunities and many family members make the top decisions to go and work on the scenes so that they can better provide for their loved ones Yeah true The filipera government has catalyzed on this phenomenon as actively exporting people for profit bringing over billion a year into the country In fact the filipans is the top supplier of nurses in the world with about of all overseas nurses coming from the world Wow And its during the pandemic The demand for people to be here is a versus highend financial aid Without the filipans the world might not have something like this The total land tax of square kilometers These breathtakingly beautiful islands are known for their agriculture and their home to over of the worlds culture That is true Yeah Its really I thought it on the fins nose video A mouth of the dwindling supply of coral reefs that we have left The lushest soil on the islands is so rich and fertile that crops can be planted all year round So with no filipans there would be a huge shortage in the production of imported coconuts bananas and tropical fruits from all around the world As a blossoming and devaluing tech giant the Philippines is known as the text capital of the world where the country sends in excess of million text messages and just so you could get a sense of how much I love this country There are two things that you should look at The heart wrenchingly intimate care that families give their illness as a country with massive massive poverty issues Many families are not able to afford care So caring for those who have reached an older age has become deeply embedded in the background Its all about the family The Philippines is the gold standard in Asia for how women should be treated as society The global gender background and the Chinese young and the Philippines are growing Wow I didnt love that The growing Arlenees Asian creatures are growing Beating the US and many other countries around the world Good job Philippines The world would be less flavorful and so nearly as charming and definitely a lot less magical So in order to sustain one of the most important and resourceful bases on earth we need them We also come to meet that beautiful country There are beautiful places that are not as beautiful as the other countries There are beautiful many different top situations and there are many places that are still developing And thats why so many families are being so romantic and so beautiful What are we going to do now In the beginning of this video I said that the Philippines is the place and as well That is most taken from London and I stand by that statement A big part of my company free and familiar in Spanish is employing people within the Philippines These people are a big part of my heart and I made this video to show my massive gratitude to one of the people I believe in Please join me in thanking the Philippines and right thank you Philippines Thats nice Nice initiative I hope you have one to acknowledge today Lets share this video to show appreciation and to show the rest of the world what an amazing place the Philippines is My name is Rita Piliyah and thank you so much for watching', 'Oh my gosh Boom Boom Boom Oh my gosh Oh my gosh Two hours Its like hearing this from a coach but I cannot disagree because it does happen Maybe its the reason why this diving team flopped in the C Games Oh my gosh That must be so painful Oh no no no no no no no no no no that is so bad Good one Good one We all worked in the train in Japan Yeah we should have even realized how hard it would become for him He left his family in the Philippines and started living together with coach Kokimia in a small apartment while studying high school at take your university This is a school where most elite student athletes go Carlos was only on his second year He struggled in school because he suddenly had to learn to both read and write in Japanese Do you understand The way he did his improvement Carlos coach required him to write the entries in his diary on a daily basis He started during the daytime and spent the rest of his free time training with his coach Are you Carlos obviously got culture shot so he started showing some size of the motivation He would make mistakes he normally wouldnt and fall down more often than usual Coach Kokimias very strict training approach wasnt helping either If you dont have a chance to do it you can do it The going to be a big injury if you dont do that there Youre not going to do it again Without thinking Without thinking Carlos diary entries never talked about his feelings so coach Kokimia had no clue about what to do with him anymore He was so bad that there was a point when Carlos told him that he wanted to quit I dont know if Im going to win or not Im not going to win Im not going to win The coach was at his wits end so he decided to pull off one more trick to motivate Carlos He brought him to an allJapan national gymnastics competition Coach Kokimia was one of the judges there and one of the competitors is Japans Olympic gold medalist Kenzo Shirai This guy is considered as one of the greatest young gymnasts of the day Training floor champion Shirai put in a reigning champion performance on the floor Its Oh Man I would break my name He won his world records as the youngest gymnast to ever win a gold medal on the world stage at And the only human being to have pulled off a salto backward stretch with quadruple twist or known today as the Shirai Oh yeah When they name it after you you know youre the goals When they enter him along with five other great moves he invented himself The dude was an absolute genius He rightfully earned the nickname Mr Twister and a not even surprised about it Watching Kenzo perform in Gwen seemed to have been a lot of enemies He might have just realized that he still had a long long way to go But in that days diary entry he never talked about quitting Instead he wrote about his admiration for Kenzos talent He started writing about his feelings which was kind of unusual for him The next day he showed up early in the gym and wrote his own training plan without being told by his coach He seemed to have found a new source of motivation He had to hand him a check it out Okay so this is actually pretty recently Oh my god He twis so quickly Wow wow they defied gravity Thats a quadruple twisting some assault Deep breath Focus on the tasker hand Three and a half minutes Followed by the full twisting front So difficult Thats good Such a terrifying way to establish immense pressure They can only imagine what Carlos was feeling at that moment because hes the next one to perform He looks much younger too years okay Filipino Yeah because Carlos only stands at Kenzo is known for his twists Carlos shines with power and elevation Whoa So high Hes also stronger Oh Just told to get together there on the combination Oh three and a half hours That was lovely The landing is so important There they are Whoa Clean Excellent awareness Multivision Assurance but he is very short Hes clinging the blow with his toes What a talent this young man is Did you see the side Oh moved into the shell of the metal position Okay Silver is still great Oh Kenzos core is going to come in the process So hes still in the podium Hopefully Strike front Well pipe front Lovely control Oh yeah thats gorgeous Wow Thats beautiful Lovely style in his movement Two and a half twists double twisting front Locking the feet together Carloss metal finish wasnt perfect for sure But it still made him the first Filipino and Southeast Asian gymnast to have everyone on the world stage He kept competing and training after the event Yeah casual I dont know if youre watching this video but if youre you are The editing is great especially when it comes to the music that you have chosen to synchronize with the visuals with the images and the video Honestly you made a great choice Hopefully it wont be too problematic for me because of copyrights But I really enjoyed what you did there Like the ending of the rotation of the athlete It ended exactly at the same time as the classical music that was awesome Until it was time for another shot the following year The World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Stuttgart Germany Kenzo Shirai didnt make it to the competition because of an ankle injury There you go Arthur Delalloyan was there Interestingly he was a nonfactor in the competition as he only finished four Interesting Its got a pretty good record of the World Championship Oh but Maybe he was tired The guy who became a problem though was Israels Artim dAlgo Oh How a full sumble Mmm Toss of the handswing devil from the one and a half twist She doesnt see many of those And again how about Fantastic work from Artim dAlgo He showcased a balance of power and technique which gave him a score that is high enough to warrant an early celebration from the crowd and his team I think I would be my friend can take him But you guys may have already heard of this saying Never count a Filipino Mmm I think he can take him I wasnt that impressed I think Carlos can kick his ass Mmm Wow Beautiful really beautiful I just got chills there Youngster from the Philippines Looking good so well Wow What a rise in for the occasion So fast in the twist That was just a double twist Wow He can jump extremely high Looking at Artims face feels like hes about to pass out When the score gets revealed Woo There you go He already made history in year ago He might just win Maybe he was like you know Im too short for basketball Even if I can jump extremely high So let me try in another sport Oh thats so huge Im pretty cool for the Philippines What a moment for him What a moment for the Philippines And just like that Carlo Yulo won the first ever gold medal for the Philippines in artistic worlds gymnastics Ladies and gentlemen in honor to the winner the national anthem of Philippines']"

before this well defended so they in place car bombs roadblocks and they employed sniper fires so this city is essentially divided by this river so the enemy is contained within this area of the other now the target of our manoeuvring elements is to neutralize those vantage positions through our mortar I dont think I would want to be in something like this man cuz this is hella terrifying this is scary man like you you dont know you could be walking through someone ever boom boom there goes a bomb under your foot oh so much comes out no interest are shooting you man its not something anyone should have to look through man this is terrified hours after we left this base these Marines were ambushed during an operation were killed and all wounded in what was the bloodiest day for the armed

a plan to escape are you safe right now Wow for the people trapped inside Marui the army is not moving fast enough and the situation is becoming more desperate by the day Colonel Jawahar era is the

wellequipped your truth well our armed forces are well educated highly trained we are very capable to address their recent is obviously theres also a lot of criticisms towards the Armed Forces suggesting that youre not well equipped and that youre not doing a great job quite frankly actually militants well I think that thats their opinion okay how long do you think its gonna be well we dont want to give timeline because we we need to put premium on the lives of the people that were trapped in that conflict area right obviously time is running out for them I mean stuff yes were doing our best', 'Just after midnight the Chinese began their attack with a heavy artillery barrage Soon after the Chinese forces advanced but had difficulty as the th battalion successfully defended their positions with mortar and artillery However a massive Chinese Arms push the Turkish brigade from their position allowing the Chinese to surround the Filipinos eastern side Seeing the incoming danger Lieutenant Colonel Junisha OHeda immediately or I can see the resemblance Right now Im kidding organized a unit of battalion cooks and I do like that they had Kalyan the East flank with the help of M light tanks and artillery support Lieutenant Colonel OHedas makeshift unit was able to hold off the advancing Chinese forces Thats crazy situation only got worse when the Puerto Rican th infantry regimen Situated on the West flank began to fall back from Chinese attack with the West flank now exposed The Chinese began advancing but were blocked by a platoon of Filipino soldiers situated on a hill overlooking Yulton Commanded by Lieutenant Jose Arceaga this platoon refused to yield held their ground This gave Lieutenant Arceagas company commander Captain Conradu Yap enough time to mount a counterattack The counterattack successfully extracted the trapped platoon from the hill and also stopped the Chinese from further advancing But sadly Lieutenant Arceaga and Captain Yap were killed during the fight In the early morning of April to Lieutenant Colonel OHeda led the second counterattack using M tanks This caught the Chinese off guard and pushed them away from the hill they were trying to seize The Filipinos fought like a little baby before it was ordered to withdraw and link up with the rest of the division in the south Filipino soldiers died were wounded and were missing in action while the Chinese and North Koreans lost around soldiers', 'Lets keep watching According to the testimony of the defenders files of dead where theyre The files of dead I was assigned as the Reconnaissance Pratun leader of the Reconnaissance Company of the th Battalion Combact in Perthop then under Colonel Salvador Abseide Being volunteers we were rushed to the front lines in Korea We took a railroad that took us to North of Seoul the capital of South Korea And passed beyond the th parallel where the reenacted on the th Battalion Combact team Perthop was stationed And after spending overnight there we were taken to our front line positions Also the th parallel In the vicinity of the city of Chorobon which is already part of North Korea During the third week of May our battalion decided that it is now or never And I was picked by the battalion commander to lead the assault And this is now my self got into the big battle for Hill Eri And I was assigned to do this with my Pratun about men We started the approach to the enemy fortifications About maybe four oclock in the morning And in May in North Korea four in the morning its still very dark and very cold When we got to Nomans land after a truck ride of about minutes we had to creep and crawl So like he said this guy was hand picked by the battalion commander Im not sure if hes the battalion leader if hes the not commission officer But he said he had about guys Theyre all infilling via Jeep But you got to remember if theyre coming in with vehicles theyre going to have to stop a few clicks if not more from the enemy And silently creep up on the enemy so they dont know hes there So I can imagine if he said they creeped and crawled theyre probably doing this for a pretty good while For most of that period within Nomans land we had to prat with our bayonets on whether there are mines planted with three pipes in the right fields to build injuries About two hours of creep and crawling we saw really mortally the enemy fortifications which were our targets We informed red quarters that were here already in the assault line we called it We did to jump off towards the hill but we passed first the preparatory fires that we had planned So this is very common with the military operations A lot of the time we always go out with four observers we go in JTAC which is the equivalency for the Air Force And theyre able to call in fire from anything from mortar tubes all the way up to you know be one bombers And a lot of the time they preplan these coordinates out to exactly where they need fire when they call for it And this were from the fighter planes of the supporting American forces that dropped the bomb bombs along the target area In the meantime we were advancing up the hill but when the neapambams were falling too closely to us and endangered our troops I called dead quarters to cease fire on that and then bring in the artillery And we continued advancing upward When we were too close to the enemy positions we called for cease fire of the artillery but we asked for tank direct fire Awesome From our supporting forces in the bomb And so the tanks being able to fire directly at the target almost in a straight line started firing So I did not catch his name and I did not catch his rank Does anyone know if hes an officer hes a noncommissioned officer My guess is hes probably going to be an officer but what he was saying is that hes lifting fires essentially what its called Hes lifting fire the neapond is too close He called an artillery fire Its getting a little too close He lifted that fire and now hes calling an indirect tank fire He also has the ability and we do it every once in a while is where we shift the fire As the tanks firing we continue to advance to very near the top of the enemy fortifications And when it was time to do it I said lift the tank fires were going to attack We identified the bunkers and the factshalls of the enemy one by one and we attacked them with rifle fire with bionettes and in some cases with demolitions The hand to hand combat lasted for about to minutes Until I determined that the enemy resistance died down and I started accounting for my men and I found out that they were all present accounted for except for one or two that were wounded I was very proud of the fact that we accomplished our mission']"

Chinese so we know from the beginning that in their head the Asian is the one who bring this Kobe in this country or all over the world but no matter what hes not supposed to hurt anyone this racism stuff I just was not dead in America it was still there but you know I didnt know it was still that very much inherent but only hidden I mean it is a lot of my perception about what America is actually you know I thought before you know when you watch the movies and its called the cops will be there right away its not the case Im a healthcare workers I provide care I give lives I help people Im not hurting anyone and the way I look America before I I look at them like top of the sky and after these incidents its its not the way I I look at it before because I didnt know that because of my Asian and Im immigrant thats how they treat all the immigrants and all Filipino here in United States I thought its just like youre watching TV TV novellas but no because it happened to me and my family considering how they view America as a whole and how I view things differently from them I think they did have faith in the legal system but now they started to see how it actually is for people like us does not come as a surprise but it does give us a an experience of what it feels like to be the ones on the receiving end of that system and wanting Justice and help that that we need from them about the government helping theres a part that from the beginning theyre advertising theyre there for for all the victims but thats not exactly what happening and then aside from that the Philippine consulate it takes like five months before they get in touch with us you know if we didnt really if the group itd be my God the group didnt really push for it with the media I mean they wouldnt get that much attention from the police and the legal system they try to dissuade you from pursuing the case saying you know its going to be expensive in the lawyer like that I am thankful for the support group that all of these Community organizations the organization that Im actually volunteering with has helped me the most the Filipino Migrant Center as well as the National Alliance for Filipino concerns youre actually able to get pro bono lawyers pool was glad to represent a sync work free of charge', 'okay so its a little different than other missions because youre sweating all the times humid um i know as sisters we like to look our tip top best all the time um and its good to try and look good obviously but i wouldnt worry too much about full on makeup um just something simple because it will end up melting off your face by the end of the day youll sweat it off pretty much um your hair is gonna be crazy no matter what they have something called rebonding in the Philippines it chemically strains your hair because it just like turns into a frisball um just put your hair up youll rather have it up to keep you cooler um closewise so this is where ive heard a lot of contradicting opinions before my mission a lot of different sisters tell me like over this or this it really is up to you ive heard cotton is good because its more breathable but also when you sweat it just stays it doesnt dry off of cotton until you take it off and so i didnt like that personally there were some days i preferred to wear cotton but its hard because you just feel wet all the time um another one i liked a lot of sheer things so im trying to think i dont know how to explain sheer just you know sheer material and the problem of that is its seethrough so um if you could find something i went to the sister missionary mall and i got stuff that um werent as seethrough which was really nice um but sheer material is nice because the sweat just rolls right off and so its not staying on you the only problem is that does feel a little bit tighter and so sometimes you might feel a little bit hotter wearing that uh skirts be careful of your skirts i had moments on my mission where i got like really light skirts because i was like oh okay its gonna be hot so lighter skirts are good uh no theyre not because there are what are called storms or baguos at the philippines and the wind will just come and lift your skirt up that happened to me a couple times and that was pretty uncomfortable i had to throw those skirts away um lets see yeah you want probably about calf length skirts anything higher than that i know it can be to the knee but you have to take in consideration that youre gonna be writing on jeep knees and tricycles and so when you do that and youre climbing in the jeep knees and stuff if you bend over it it like goes up higher and you can see stuff so i i was always most comfortable with calf length um skirts and then as for shoes when youre prosoliting depending on what mission you go to even in the city i prefer to wear rubber shoes so anything from like good ballet shoes from crocs that those were my favorite because theyre breathable um you dont some sisters were stockings or like socks i dont like that just because its really really hot in your feet smell awful by the end of the day um but rubber shoes are really good um you need to bring other shoes that are good for um like conferences because youll have general authorities like apostles coming and speaking to you so i had a pair of nice like leather shoes and those are actually nice sometimes during the rainy season because your feet do get kind of cold when they get wet so a good place for that would be next to the missionary mall i got my shoes there and theres a shoe store i think to the left of it and those lasted me my entire mission even when dogs came and ate them up um they were really useful um lets see one of their tips bring a lot of mosquito repellent sisters tend to get eaten a lot more than elders do i dont know why that is but yeah your mosquitoes will definitely attack you and i think thats it']"

that notification bell so that you can stay updated with the most amazing places that I get to visit on this earth Id love to have you join me along on this journey Lets dive right into number one And of course that is swimming with the whale sharks at number one Whats happening These whale sharks are all PCveryvery sensitive creatures to its surroundings I always learn Ive learned that these whale sharks are very innocent They dont eat people They dont You are free to literally beat next to them without being harmed Thats what I remember I dont have the footage for you to show you when you come back up in the water Yeah Ill do it Ill do it for a little bit I want to see what they do first So the induction that we received that was actually in multiple languages So if youre Chinese or Korean they have one in every single language And of course they have that in English too I thought that was a very internationallyaccommodating sort of induction if you like And then after that without further ado were jumping straight in there The time that you spend with the whale shark is actually quite intimate because the whale sharks are very friendly They swim right up to you It is crazy But what I didnt like about the experiences that they didnt give you any food for So you actually cant spend as much time underwater as you normally get to it Its really designed for beginners to enjoy just like the proximity to the whale shark Before a slightly more advanced sort of swimmer in a diver that I am I would probably appreciate it a little bit more time underwater I didnt know why but maybe the waters a bit saltier I would have loved to swim more time underwater and get those dope ass shots But I dont think we did too bad this time around And when you actually have the people the guys that are on the boat that are there for you they take the best photos for you They wont really have to do it Theyre multilingual as well So if they know your Korean theyre like Pasha but lets do that again Like it all in Korean So its really nice that most of you watch this video Korean But anyway theyre really keen on getting in that best shot Theyll give you multiple times to go underwater Theres actually no real time limit for this You can stay there as long as you like because youre going to be absolutely smashed And its such a surreal experience because these whale sharks come right up to you Its scary Friendly its really daunting at the same time It wont be your fault if you accidentally kick the whale sharks here and there because you want to keep a distance but they just come up to you It is mental And as you can see its not just one whale shark that you get to see Theres literally a dozen of them every Theres like seconds So its quite crazy You feel scared but after all you get comfortable when you get to enjoy I guess the presence around you as well Yes it is a really interesting place because they actually feed these whale sharks which you know some people stand on the other side of the fence for that kind of stuff as well But I think its still good because it raises awareness that this kind of shark is from the whale shark mouth I just dont want to be in the whale How many of the fact check I think Yeah do whale sharks From my understanding I dont think there are people Im small Yeah so when they open their mouth and they water yeah come on man But the thing is when he started to explain more of the experience I was like Im in We cant get friendly Thats good But its just open water And is there aage bracket with that I would like to know that We would like to know that you know sir Wildlife does exist and makes people that are able to go and visit it to want to protect nature and things like that So I thought overall it was a great experience and I really appreciate the way they do it Of course there are other areas in the world where you can find whale sharks without having to feed them But one thing is guaranteed is that if you actually go there you will be able to see whale sharks They are literally everywhere And it is such a privilege to see them and I absolutely enjoy my time there', 'okay weve made it to the east coast of Cebu just up the road from oslob which is where they have this very famous activity let me explain a little bit and then you can let me know what you guys think so basically what they do is you go out on a little wooden boat and you dont go very far out to see and there are huge whale sharks the largest fish in the world and they swim in a circle and you can interact with them swim next to them take pictures near them and on the surface it looks incredible but heres the thing a long time ago someone decided it was a good idea to go out there and and feed these whale sharks that swim here throughout the year on their migration around the Philippines because whale sharks migrate constantly to mate to feed and their fish right so they they need to move around and here in oslob they started to feed them and they got accustomed to getting fared they liked the food and it was a lot easier for them just to sort of swim in a circle come back every morning get fed every day and then they sort of started selling these tours where Backpackers and tourists from all around the world will come here and theyll go out on the boat trip and there are rules in place youre not supposed to touch them youre not supposed to hit them but Ive seen quite a few Vlogs of my friends going there I remember when Carl Watson went there and he documented it for his channel when he was sharing his Filipino adventures and well look this is what happened when he went the thing is they sort of say to you or youve got to keep your distance from the whale sharks but the waters so crowded with so many people and theres so many boats that you get in the water and youre like try not to bump into anyone else try not to smack your head off the boat and before you know it theres a whale shark come underneath your feet and your depth perceptions officer in the waters you dont know if youre going to kick it in the head or in a bin and there was a part of me that wanted to kind of still go and still do it to see if it had got better if things had changed but just looking on Google Maps you know I click on the link to head down there and the first picture I see is this poor whale shark covered in Barnacles because the issue is is because theyre not migrating because theyre not moving around theyre not getting cleaned theyre not getting the right skin care you know theres little fish that come and eat the the bacteria off their skin or whatever and theyre getting covered in Barnacles theyre getting scars from flippers and boats and other things and it just looks like a bit of a cluster and not really something that I want to promote because I love whale sharks and Ive swam with a whale shark inco PP and it was an incredible experience to see it in the wild and I just think seeing them in that state it might be some good footage it might be wild it might be very outrageous and certainly interesting but I just dont want to promote it on my channel because I just dont fully agree with it so you can have a different opinion to me thats fine but this is just my opinion and why Im not going to oslob to share something that the Philippines is very famous for and what the Cebu is very famous for so Sam was going to call it here guys I think Im going to keep driving up to Cebu get back tonight rest up and the Adventures Continue in the next episode', 'The sharks I will admit well sharks live in far more places than the waters of the Philippines After all the ocean is a big place But since thousands of them migrate to the Philippine Elasmo branch Mecca from December to May they deserve a spot on this list Sometimes reaching lengths of up to feet whale sharks are the largest species of shark in the world So large in fact that they have often been mistaken for whales thus the name But dont worry they arent after humans They swim around close to the surface to catch tiny food sources in the water like plankton To a YouTube search and youll find plenty of videos of scuba divers safely swimming around massive whale sharks as they meet Would you swim up to one Oh yeah Ive actually watched a few videos about them They are very docile Theyre not aggressive at all Id have no issue with it Theyre just big Yeah theyre basically whales because they eat plankton in small small microbes So its not like a dangerous It would be like a super intense interaction though Like my fear but also kind of one too is something like a blue whale or a humpback whale Yeah Like thatd be terrifying But at the same time you know youre kind of safe Well not sure Crab fisherman Yeah crab fisherman But it was a crabber I had watched a thing explaining why he didnt get swallowed Its because their throats are smaller than even like a baby Really That big giant whale would not be able to swallow a human because its not they dont theyre not designed to swallow around it Its to keep water out of their stomachs Yeah So Im in the deep blue in the Philippines The prime time to spot a whale shark is from February to April And so if youre more of a beach in ocean type of person than a jungle lover maybe you would enjoy one of several tourist attractions in the Philippines That is a simple example I can feel the odds of a walk on top']"

you have a lot of experience right now So can you tell us what has been being black in the Philippines in Well its actually an amazing experience Because Ive been here for not quite long but just a little while Its an amazing experience Because youre able to experience Amir Youre able to have a lot of experience positive and negative Especially as a black person You encounter a lot of racism Actually when I arrived here when I my first thing I entered in the cheap I saw some people like Carvin their nose I already observed actually I already knew this was a subracism But through the years and time was going on time was going on No what No thats the first time Ive heard that The Carvin the nose Like this Like I saw the video the other day of a man sitting on the airplane And he didnt like that He was sitting next to a black person And he was just like like maybe your belly smell is shake but Im coconut And everything else I got on here What do you smell like I didnt know they do that Like they cover their nose out of like they make it something like we stand Maybe look Well not one thing like stank We smell like some of the best smell of people ever Gaze Oh this is you and youre not gonna rock We aint gonna do anything else I got on Yeah we do smell like you know the richness of the rich Yeah you feel me But it always gonna smell good So you cover your nose I dont know what youre covering your nose for Yeah actually I are But used to it You know but its a I can say that I got used to it and actually became so normal And its been great experience What are some zero type that Filipino have on black people and where do you think it comes from Yeah first of all is that the perception that a lot of Filipinos have towards the black people It is for the fact of them thinking that in Africa I mean start by Africa itself Some of them think that Africa is a country itself When in fact Africa is a continent on which contains countries And that is the first one When they talk about Africa and they say that Africa in general they cannot distinguish with from Angola with from Ghana with from Cameroon They do not have that distinguish as what we have Unlike just like us Angolas as well When we come to the Philippines we think that every bad that comes from Asian goes to Africa to Angola For us youre Chinese Thats how we see you And they also think that Africans are good with basket ball As long as Africa you got the hides They see as a basket ball They dont think about you being a football player anymore Second least them thinking about you being a basketball player When they see what they want to But the Philippines number one in basketball So it makes sense They probably are looking for recruiters Or they probably want to play one at one at one You know Thats probably why I dont think the football is like a hype thing for the Philippines So basketball makes sense to him Say that Yeah To your ball say it Dont dont dont dont dont dont call your attention And also yeah its one of those that you see here in the Philippines But some of the stereotypes that Filipino have on black people And where do you think it comes from Well they usually see black people I mean yeah of course from TV from America And they see many things like black people are normally strong I think many people when Filipino actually when they see me they think Im a black American and Im something like that And yeah they ask where I am where Im from They dont usually know my country but I take the time to educate them when I come from my country from Angola But usually they think that Im a black American Yeah But they are very friendly and they ask me a lot of questions Im pretty much open to answer their questions Do you think the perception Yeah I think its because of the relationship and history between the United States and the Philippines especially you know because of some African Americans in their history as well So I think maybe thats why', 'all right now were going to read some comments from the video i see a lot of paragraphs here so im probably going to get mad but its okay filipinos in the philippines dont define blackness under the same context as westerners do if a blackskinned person went to the philippines they would be adored for the blackness of their skin as a black person i can tell you right now that that is just not true theres a reason why to look a certain way it makes you higher class or exactly its because its further away from blackness exactly exactly why is that associated with that you cant separate the association with the reality of the actual color right now we have to address why being darker skinned is not higher glass right this is beautiful im not asian but i can relate my aunties used to tell me that if i get too dark no proper latino would want me it still affects me even when i know its not true i still worry about being too dark despite being a mediumskinned black person its beyond crazy how this intersects cultures all of the people on this video have amazing skin and are beautiful i totally relate to this after i experienced colorism in the philippines when i was in high school i was captain of my dance team and i almost quit because i didnt want to be outside to like be darker like it made me so insecure i had a childhood friend who was like there was like three of us but she was the the fairer one and she got a lot of comments about how pretty she was growing up and i was like so much lucky whats kind of like why someone talking about this one person theres something different about us that i dont really understand because from the same country were from the same tribe what is the difference between the two of us that she is the beautiful one random but weve ever ended up being the same person when we were in secondary school that i dated him first and she dated him later on who made me very selfconscious for a while i dont know if were ready for this conversation but if we talk about antiblackness within the philippines we need to talk about antiindigeneity as well the two are tied together id really like for us to push from the idea that our colorism is solely rooted in classism like the chinese its rooted in antiindigeneity slavery in the trafficking of our people i hate it when i talk about online whenever i make a youtube video or i talk about colorism in filipino communities online someone is always like oh its because in asia if you were like lighter skinned than you were you know the noble class if youre darker skinned you were like working out in the fields and im like listen philippines is a cluster of islands in the south east pacific so being brown is normal like its so its okay to be brown you know what im saying east asia was not colonized by europeans the way that a lot of southeast asia was particularly the philippines i mean they were under spanish rule for years and then right after that they were under american rule and then there was you know japanese occupation between that but it was literally rooted by a caste system that was put in place by the spanish its based on classism but the class system was based on race it was based on skin color i think a lot of people dont realize that the one they implemented in the americas enslaved africans were at the bottom of this hierarchy in the philippines the negritos the indigenous black asians were put at the bottom of this hierarchy so i really like that this person brought this up because there really is a difference colorism exists all around the world but i think in the philippines specifically its definitely rooted in colonialism', 'So personally I love the Tatians regime I wish we have a president like the Tatians in Nigeria Oh we killed any criminal Do you know what my government does Now a group of Muslim people Im just hearing this which is so that you can know that things are happening in the world Now some groups of people we go to a certain barangay We call this barangay here in the Philippines Im just making it so that you can understand like a community where people live a group of Muslim people they we go there they we kill everybody in that community And you have to take notes that these people has never offended them before and but they are trying to prove a what a point to the government They are trying to prove a point that they are powerful This people we go to a certain barangay or community and kill everybody in that community Both old young even babies you would see the way they were being caught Like on some of them are sleeping on their bed some of them Like Im just remembering one of these things Im like crying I am just remembering one of the things that I once watched right And it is so heartbreaking So heartbreaking Thats why I am so scared to go back to my country I dont want to go back I do not want to have anything to do in Nigeria And my siblings that are there I want to get them my mom my dad I want to get them out of Nigeria I dont want to have any business to do in Nigeria Now some of these people they are still sleeping on their bed They are hypnosis people People who do not know anything People who are not part of the problem of Nigeria They were still sleeping on their bed And this group of people went there They killed everybody while they were on their sleep With young with old you would With young with old you would see the way the caught last was being caught on their bed And you would see the slashes Some of them were still sleeping They would kill everybody And when they are being caught by the government do you know what the government causes The government will tell you that they are rehabilitating them into the society The government will tell you that this people have repented and that they are rehabilitating them into the community The government will take care of these people close them feed them do everything for them Things that they normally would not do for the citizens They would do it for these criminals and bring them even empower them and bring them back into society And these people later on they will be caught by the leaders of their caught groups and be brought back again And these people will still comment the case Somebody who killed somebody It is okay for them to act for repentance It is between them and God What it should be killed is that That is why they are lost and ordered in the country to make sure that the country is running well to make sure that the country is safe Okay if you feel like the government should not kill that criminal why should that criminal in the first place kill a person I am supposed to take the life of anybody But I know that this is what some of the Filipinos want So Filipinos dont want kills on criminals They want them to be to be sent to jail and be brought back into the society But you dont know that One they keep on doing that The Filipinos becomes dangerous to leave Torres will not come here because it will become dangerous for us Because that is what is happening in my own country They keep on forgiving the wicked people because they are Muslims And this will keep on committing crime They keep on doing it over and over and over again That is why Nigeria is not safe I think a month ago there is this doctor who was planning to travel She already had a flight ticket to the UK to go and work as a doctor She is a doctor in Nigeria She is a very young girl So she took a train because she was traveling from a part of Nigeria to another part of Nigeria because she is traveling to UK that week This same terrorist the bomb thats rain the shots at people and she was one of those victims who lost a life in that train Just because of the field system in our country Our future is gone Our vision our ambition everything Its over If we have a president like Duterte in my country it would not be like this Yes criminals should be killed so that everybody can know that they have to abide by the laws and order of the country If you kill somebody be killed instantly If you do drugs be killed just be killed']"

another remove the skin yeah yeah because it has a duck maybe Duck in it I eat this all at once yeah almost choking on a baby duck when I thought eating wings was messy its hard to describe something that is unlike anything else youve ever eaten in your entire life hardboiled egg but much more firm and so much more flavor I had heard that maybe it had some chicken flavor or a poultry flavor in there honestly I dont get any of that if anything maybe some hints of beef but of course I get a lot of salt and vinegar because we put so much of that on top the first time in the millionaire because youre trying it too yes wow okay can I have the salt right here honey can I have a napkin yeah no its okay no oh my Lord Brooklyn Ray you are awesome look its not like real dots like where you just bite into it you bite into it so proud of these kids for trying something so incredibly new but Luke did not originate in the Philippines they observed uh travelers from China eating it and then they have their own take on it you can do this yeah more vinegar this has turned into a really incredible experience for the whole family and it was unexpected it was impromptu there was no way we could have mapped this whole thing out and were so grateful to you June for taking us to these last places and showing us around and really giving us an eyeopening experience we have more travel to do so please keep watching us we love your support we love you thank you thank you thank you were gonna head back to the hotel', 'I hope I hope I hope Its off the balloon We go See Can you see the huge bucket of eggs Oh my gosh You guys I see the bucket of eggs I didnt realize it was gonna be like a bucket of eggs Are you all ready to see this No So these are the three things that you generally see being sold by balloon vendors You have the balloon itself boiled quail eggs and boiled peanuts Now you No you already had quail eggs Now you might be wondering why do some of them have markings and some of them dont Now the ones without markings they are what we call pannoi They are unfertilized Meaning when you open it up it looks just like a boiled egg We dont want that We want the one with a surprise inside All right So scientifically to hatch a duck egg it takes roughly days if Im not mistaken We cook it right around Just at the middle ground So yeah not too scary Most of it will be egg yolk Itll just look like egg yolk All right See me eat it first Now what you do is you find a nice warm one Okay not too warm because itll be too hot You cant hold it Now generally youre supposed to just feel and find which one is the lighter side Meaning thats the one with an air pocket But if you dont If you cant feel it you can put it by the light and you can find that air pocket Can you see that over there Oh yeah All right Okay so you get that You can smack it on your head or on here Im not the hardheaded guy so well have to use this See And then And then you have a small film there So that is the balut What you do first is you get a pinch of salt You get a pinch of salt Okay there you go And then most people will put vinegar I dont like vinegar in it I just like it plain like with salt And then bottom soup Like a doxoo It tastes like chicken broth Hear that Okay Next you open it up again just so you show up more of the balut itself Now I think youre brave enough so I can tell you the truth of it As Im peeling it you can see this is mostly egg yolk Thats a baby duck It stuck in between Right And then more salt Because I just like it with more salt And then just take a bite More ducky Yeah thats part of the duck And then whats left is just a little bit more egg yolk So waste not one not so lets have the egg yolk And then the egg white thats left Its very hard If youve ever tried chewing an aneryser before thats what it feels like So I dont suggest you eating the egg white inside Theres a bit of soup left so bon appetit Okay I made my decision Im not going to have a bite Im turning me Im turning me No Let me choose a nice one for you Yes yes Wow I cant believe were doing it Tell me about it Right You did it though It tastes like chicken soup But I feel like I feel weird about it Wow I guess youre eating a baby ducky Yeah I can taste the baby ducky and the chicken soup Finish up the soup Now Im going to take a bite and try to get him to take a bite No I cant do it No No I cant do it Oh Im not doing it No you have to do it Are you sure Its okay Yeah okay Okay take it on Next time Youre so excited Its kind of fun Uhoh Okay so now I eat the aneryser Yep And the egg yolk For mostly the egg yolk Right Mmm So you got the baby ducky hat This is about a day old baby ducky today Yeah its so interesting Yeah baby ducky Baby ducky right there right Mmm Cut the juice all over me How delicious Yeah That was so good guys Good job for doing the juice at least Now the thing is trying the juice trying the soup right Thats how Filipino kids learn to eat balut Your dad would have balut and then youd be too scared Thats the day he explains to you what it is So for the soup a couple of times its just a soup And then maybe after the seventh sixth time your braid event enough to try the actual ducky So yeah so good When youre more than a coffee give it a try So yeah Ill give you a pass Ill give you a pass']"

King Philip II of Spain And it was a Spanish colony for over years Today the Philippines is an archipelago of islands The first people in the Philippines were hunter and gatherers But between BC and BC people learn to farm They grew rice and domesticated animals From the th AD century Filipinos traded with China and by the th century AD Arab merchants reached the Philippines and introduced Islam Then in Erden and Magellan sailed across the Pacific He landed in the Philippines and claimed them for Spain Magellan baptized a chief called Hamabun and helped to make him a puppet ruler on behalf of the Spanish crown Magellan demanded that other chiefs submit to Hamabun but one chief named Lapalapo refused Magellan led a force to crush him But the Spanish soldiers were scattered and Magellan was killed The Spaniards did not gain a football in the Philippines until When Miguel Lopez de la Gaspe led an expedition which built a fort in Cebu Later in the Spaniards landed in LaZone Here they built the city of Intermuros later called Manoa which became the capital of the Philippines Years passed until the British captured Manoa They held it for two years but they handed it back in Under the terms of the Treaty of Paris signed in the Philippines in the th century In there was a rebellion in Caviti but it was quickly crushed However nationalist feelings continued to grow up by a wider name was a result In Jose Rizal founded a movement called Liga Filipina which called for reform rather than revolution As a result Rizal was arrested and exiled to the beaten in Mindanao Meanwhile Andris Benefacio formed a more extreme organization called the Catipunan In August they began a revolution Rizal was accused of supporting the revolution although he did not and he was executed on December Yet his execution merely inflamed Filipina opinion and the revolution grew Then in came the war between the USA and Spain On April the Americans defeated the Spanish fleet in Manila Bay Meanwhile Filipina revolutionaries surrounded Manila Their leader Emilia Aguinaldo declared their Philippines independent on June th However as part of the peace treaty Spain ceded the Philippines to the USA The Americans planned to take over The war between American forces in Manila and Filipinos began on February The FilipinoAmerican war lasted until when Aguinaldo was captured American ruined the Philippines was brutal They called their policy the Nevillean assimilation They wanted to Americanize the Filipinos but they never quite succeeded In the Philippines were made a Commonwealth nation Manuel Cezon became president America promised that the Philippines would become completely independent in However in December Japan attacked the US fleet at Pearl Harbor On December Japanese troops invaded the Philippines They captured Manila on January All of the Philippines were in Japanese hands But American troops returned to the Philippines in October They recaptured Manila in February The

and strongest species of eagles on the entire planet On top of its impressive size the Philippine Eagle has an impressive long arched beak and distinctively majestic long crown feathers Move aside bald eagle Heres a bird that managed to keep its hair and it looks truly regal In keeping with its reputation for strength and superiority the Philippine Eagle also eats lemurs snakes and bats Wow The best thing about the Philippine Eagles is its success story Not too long ago there were only a few of these birds left They were on the verge of extinction But thanks to the Philippine Eagle Center their numbers have sprung back from the brain and theyve been saved from extinction for now Hey thanks for watching Want to suggest a video Let Even the bald eagle was on the brink of extinction for a long time Yeah Youll have to do a video comparing the bald eagle to the Apparently theres an actual video art Or yeah people suggested it We just havent gotten around to it Yeah well have to check that out I didnt know the Moose Gears had tusks Or yeah whatever you want to call those little things Because you got to think its probably the thickness of a fingernail Yeah theyre so tiny as they are I bet you they hurt though Oh yeah Thats cute I mean its such a fat body Thats so fat With these tiny little legs Yeah No that was a good video though I I love animal videos Yeah I could watch

also observed when a third juvenile eagle which is their offspring from the most recent breeding season They are solitary hunters which use their keen sense of sight to locate our boreal prey in thick rainpours That is a gorgeous bird Happy Eagles can potentially pervert for up to hours in search of prey They are incredibly skilled in flight They can fly up to hours Happy Eagles can potentially perch for up to hours in search of prey They are incredibly skilled in flight and are adept at maneuvering through their dense forest habitat They are diurnal and hunt during the day Evolution in the Philippine islands without other predators made the Eagles the dominant hunting in the Philippine forests There it actually looks It looks very cutly there So they both have that like and Im sure it has to do with time here it is before they welter anything like that Either that bird is held in captivity and its fed very well The chest looks like a pillow Yeah it does Its real pretty bird Both of them are amazing Dont give me wrong If I say anything about one or the other I promise you I think theyre both awesome Whether or not who he says wins or not these are both amazing birds I think the narrators phenomenal for this video He might not be saying things properly all the time but hes like the way that he says things Its just like got you going Yeah The Eagles the dominant hunter in the Philippine forests Each breeding pair requires a large home range of to square miles to successfully raise a chick and thus the species is extremely vulnerable to the regularly occurring deforestation The species flight is fast and agile resembling the smaller hawks more than similar large birds of prey Additionally they have been known to attack inanimate objects for practice as well as attempt to hang upside down to work on their balance Thats interesting They practice on inanimate objects pretending its prey and they hang upside down to help balance Yeah That is intelligent Yeah Oh yeah As the parents are not nearby when this occurs it has been suggested that they do not play a role in teaching the juvenile to hunt Life expectancy for a wild eagle is estimated to be anywhere from to years Wow It helps to be the apex predator Yeah Yeah', 'The Pian Eagle also known as the Monkey Eating Eagle is the most amazing and one of the largest extent species of Eagles in the world It is just behind the American Harpy Eagle It is also known as Harriban which means King of the Birds because it has the mane like a lion which makes him or her unique from all other birds Description Males and females of Harpia Harpia possess an identical plumage They have grey orsate black feathers on their back while the abdomen is white in colour The head is pale grey and a black band on its chest separates it from the white abdomen Both males and females have a double crest on the back of their head The females of this species can be easily distinguished as they grow twice as large as the males In the wild at all female Harpy Eagles can weigh up to a whopping to pounds whereas the weight of males range from between to pounds on average A Harpy Eagle can live as long as to years in the wild What about Apple Besides the single heaviest The Eagle is also one of the largest Eagles on Earth growing up to to inches in length with a wingspan of up to feet making Harpy Eagles second to only Philippine Eagles in terms of length The Philippine Eagles nape adorned with long brown feathers that form a shaggy crest These feathers give it the appearance of possessing a lions mane which in turn resembles the mythical Gryphon The Eagle has a dark face and the cruelly Dont get me wrong I think it looks cool as can be especially like this right here But the whole lion mane thing I saw it Its a stretch for me No when I when it showed that like I if I look at the outer side and not at the face I can see the line But I got to see the thats the thing I got to look at the face But if Im looking at the top if Im looking at this the socalled mane he looks like my hair when I wake up in the morning I see a lion So I agree with the statement In my opinion if Im not looking at the actual beak of the bird and Im looking at the beak what that point its a bird with a mane With a fro But there it looks amazing I think it looks there it just looks really angry I think it looks cool like that I dont like the mane thing The heavy legs are yellow with large powerful dark claws and the prominent large high arched deep beak is a bluish gray The average female is about feet long and weighs about pounds So about the adult male is about to smaller and averages at about feet and pounds The Philippine eagle is the worlds life So it weighs much less but its got it weighs almost half but its got twice no its got a larger wingspan Yeah which obviously doesnt translate to length The species has a wingspan of approximately pounds Thats insane The wings of this eagle are shorter than large eagles of open country such as the Marshall Eagle wedgetailed eagle and stellar sea eagle But if we look at the broad sea have a greater surface area than any other eagle']"

Aussie woman looks at me and asks me why I hadnt learned my lesson yet Why on earth would I try again Why dont I just look for a local lady I asked her a straight question and to her credit she answered honestly I said OK YOU tell me if you know of any local woman whom you could introduce me to who would be prepared to get to know me with a view to marriageforlife and would make a great wife and mother to my two sons She knew a lot of people yet after thinking for a bit she shook her head Plenty of lovely ladies around in Australia but most of them are married and will stay married Of the

looking for Yet in the Philippines Its not so unusual Yes I recently had a bit of a rip into the effect of modern westernstyle values on the younger Filipino population and I stand by this But its

different experience to what I normally do on trips and so it was a pretty good little break for otherwise a very very long trip that I had And theres a bonus on your way back to see we make sure you stop at Kakar because they have one of the best lectures Kakar is actually the birthplace of what we know as a lecture and there youre going to have the freshest lecture on there and I kid you know they have the deepest and the most yummy flavor there If its spicy it was spicy If it had flavor it had really deep flavors and while youre eating you can even see the fresh lachon getting cooled and coming out on a spit which I think is crazy Theres other foods that you can pick and choose from there as well and it is just such a wonderful break You literally like in this busy marketplace and youre having lachon its very authentic its really hot but the food is amazing One of the most authentic Filipinos experience that I was able to have and it was something that I could never ever ever forget so make sure you stop by Kakar and grab yourself some lachon before you come back to your hotel in Cebu guys So overall when youre in Cebu I think the best thing to do is to grab yourself a driver whos going to get you around all of these places in one course We were able to do this within just literally three days and it was super simple to just have a driver We had us to take us around everywhere and they were like in a sedent For three of us was traveling together thats totally enough to get yourself around It is lots of lots of fun they accommodate you every single step of the way

its coconut milk shit And drop it all over the water Ill be in the mess Can I not drink it like this Maybe this is the way to eat it Probably not Its so different A lot of countries they have shaved ice And they also put some toppings But this one is really not comparable to all of them And way way better I will ask maybe what this is Maybe this is the Uber gem I can just put this on my bread And

the gut In the gut For the tuna gut For the tuna gut Okay Next time Ill come here For the pork tuna gut', 'so one thing that I forgot to mention earlier that while this is the easiest way to stay here since there are basically no requirements you will stay in this temporary visitor status so basically you are just a tourist and you have no rights to do work here or to start a business its just for leisure purposes If you want to stay here permanently and have more rights then you will need to apply for a permanent visa and there are many different options I could basically make a whole video Im just about the different types of longterm visas I will also have link included about this in the description box but the most common types of permanent visas how most foreigners are staying here are either by marriage or theres always a quota visa which is limited to a certain amount of national from each country every year or by retirement where everyone can apply who are years or older and deposit a certain amount of money to a local bank you can also get investors visa for doing business or work visas if you have a work permit on arranged work with some kind of local company and you can also get a citizenship but thats a little bit more of a longterm thing because you have to be staying here for years and on some kind of property or business here or have a permanent job and while getting these visas will grant you a permanent citizenship in the Philippines getting them is not really easy just like in other countries getting these types of visas you will need to go through a whole list of requirements including final show proof and the registered local address plus of course other things each will depend on the specific type of visa you are trying to apply to this is why its really good that foreigners are allowed to stay here in the Philippines just by extending their tourist visa because by doing this you can just come here see if you really want to live here find a way of earning for yourself and decide what types of visa you will want to apply to later on and the next thing that I will talk about is also going to be related to this continue this video I came to my favorite walking location to have a beautiful background for the things that I want to say and its also a really good place while doing this for Pixar to walk because shes enjoying it so much']"

was here too young to understand what happened during those times But I think that what my relatives and friends and the people who were witnessed to that unfaithful occasion well they just more than justified the fact and I think Its justified for me to feel the same way because I know that my people suffered very much under that rule You still is prejudiced against the Japanese as you work Well five years ago that prejudice of mine was well slightly fading away But when Japans Stabberly refused to pay reparations to us Well the prejudice began to brew again But now I found out from close contact with Ureko and other Japanese that Japanese and Freddy to Pay reparations yet because as Ureko said Some of them and most of them even have to suffer the cold in the classrooms because they cant afford to heat the schools Ureko youve got any prejudices Well I dont have many prejudiced for Philippines Okay many Japanese people hate Korea because The president of Korea made the line his own line on the public see between Korea and Japan And if the Japanese officials go over the line They were they are Code by Korean people and they can go go home for a while and we are trying to be a

shocked by her accent because to me it sounds just like a cockney accent with an England and And I hope Im not conceded on anything better I cant copy accent in England You know most English people would shudder a little bit from the here But she very frankly told me that shes shuddered when she heard my accent I got feedback for that too Why did she say she did Oh I think she imagined that she said she really had to forget my accent in order to like me Because its it was too formal I gather most Americans think about that about English as well Right now I need your turn Sometimes I find the

cream And now you should bring cows too because you made it a bit sweat so much Every time I go back to Japan I feel like more cold So I think its little bit I cannot stand for the Japanese weather so be careful I really like summer season When I in the Philippines I feel summer season all day I dont like cold weather so much so when I go back to Japan I feel like I dont want to go back to Japan One time you got the Philippines weather you cannot go back to Japan if you really like summer season This is second reason you should not Okay here in Spain you dont have any winter and we dont have a winter because we dont have any snow I dont have any snow where we live We do not have any snow It gets cold but the cold gets into your bones okay so its not like wet or anything its just like the humidity its so cold and then in summer its so hot We get to degrees and it really I know in Philippines its really really really really hot every time but here were hot constantly all the time so I know what shes saying I love winter like autumn but we do not get autumn here so thats really really I dont like that because I like autumn and when I go to England because I I generally go to England Germany they have the s and I appreciate more the s since dont get me wrong I like summer but its too hot Ive had years of summer constantly and it drives me crazy because its always hot but people dont have that they want more summer and the people that have so much summer want a bit of different you know different seasons so second one its not that bad its not that bad its just really hot and

noise in the professional sports industry At a first glance anyone could easily assume that this guys only talents are watching anime and playing video games This chubby Filipino dude is a living proof Because he looks like a geek or something I see him and I dont immediately assume he watches anime Especially your difference Youre unique That muscles alone dont win fights but real talent and skill Meet Nathaniel Bustamante AKA Salt Papi He was born and raised in Candelaria Quezon At age he moved to the UK with his family for better opportunities in life He loved boxing ever since he was a kid because of Manny Pacquiao He used to engage in street fights for fun in some of his vlogs which are actually entertaining to watch but he never really trained seriously He worked as a nurse in a mental health institution He struck gold when his fake run challenge on Tiktok went viral His popularity skyrocketed and he didnt stop there because he became even more popular when he started uploading videos of himself pouring salt in the most ridiculous ways you could ever imagine This is a Christian channel please This is when he earned his infamous nickname He made his boxing debut in March of when he was given the opportunity to match up against the English YouTuber Halal Ham Days before the fight Salt Papis opponent couldnt stop talking smack Oh my god that was so racist I think he intentionally wanted to be valiantly offensive offensive because he clearly knows hes Filipino and hes gonna send him back to China He just wanted to trigger him Tonight he made Halal regret everything he said The internet took notice because it was three full rounds of humiliation And hes got livered emphatically What an entertaining performance But at this point Salt Papi was only seen as some chubby guy who beat another chubby guy so he got matched up against a Twitch streamer who was more fit and more arrogant than the first one Im not coming in here to like have fun Im coming in here to murder you bro and thats what Im gonna do bro Is there an element of surprise that youre worried about with Andy We havent seen a lot from him Ive lost kg for this fight I feel more conditioned Im gonna take him out in the first round Oh yeah Really First round Alright Salt Papi in the black How about Salt Papi to South Pole A la Manny Pacquiao from the Philippines Salt Papi on some of the best rounds In the first round Oh the fake round The fake round Salt Papi making a statement with that one Hes so black He stayed true to his word The internet then blew up as Salt Papi violated every ounce of Andy Warskis ego The matchmakers then wanted to see how Salt Papi reacts when he gets tested like really tested So they matched him up against an American MMA fighter Josh Bruckner Oh wow so they are just giving him more difficult Yeah the challenge This is a challenge for him But theyre not doing this to any other person So I personally feel offended Yeah but they just want to see how good is this guy already Is this really lock You know Was this lock or is this guy really good at boxing It was looking like our guy didnt have a chance because not only does this guy have a total of professional fights but he was also bigger at and stronger judging by his muscles Come on just take a look at the difference But come fight night This is where Josh should be excelling Hes the longer fighter Should be touching Papi What the I need to see this in slow motion In slow motion please Way long I cannot see well It was with the other one So since the guy was attacking here he was like focusing on his punch and he didnt realize that a punch was coming to his face Already yeah Because he attacked with the left You dont expect the person to attack with the left but with the right So hes imitating Manny Pacquiao They are comparing him with Manny Pacquiao because Manny Pacquiao doesnt move with the left hand Ah oh wow Thats amazing Well Pacquiao is really his hero Yeah This was the fight when Salt Papi gained the respect of everybody Even the pros Salt Papi Won Salt Papi won Technically he was and he seems like he understands boxing at a higher level so I would say Salt Papi Also well deserved He is so entertaining so good so sexy He just seems like he gets everything and hes understanding it and I think hes going to get better This win catapulted him into the top pound for pound influencer boxing rankings along with big names such as ASI and Jake Paul Heck some of them are even scared of him now Now well Im just training against all philox fighters now so

Ranger recruits are seven weeks into their brutal training regime have already dropped out Those who failed to graduate has So what do you say week week seven dropped out So they started with So I dont know how much they lost on the first day I can imagine they lost probably half of that easily And so really since week since the weeks went on it doesnt look like they lost a whole lot Maybe guys or whatnot One thing in common They easily give up The batter has been one yet They already doubt themselves Once you doubt yourself the affinity will let me finish the course But exit I start decline Is it going on or prepping Nakwa The recruits will test their heads for heights today Theyre going to learn to repel on this foot tower Its crazy how much things theyve adopted from the US And granted Im sure the US has adopted things from the Philippines as well Even how he enters that door brings back memories for me Rangers especially in jungle warpure who they are bailed on mountains gross rivers using expedite methods or anything thats available within them Recruits will have to complete four crucial forms of repelling The seat hip repel the lizard repel the rundown repel and the heli repel And then how much some break Is that part Okay Oh the recruits one and one fifty five are up first They need the seat hip repel Used for mountain evacuations Recruit one fifty five is one of the youngest in the course The last one can be the one I can do The first one can be the one I can do The first one can be the one I can do From that tower to that tower Maybe its a good one Go Were ready to go Set the propeller Start Ready for the move The first exercise is cleared They performed well even recruit one fifty five Im about to say for that being something hes scared of and scared of heights He was still smirk at the top and he still did a phenomenal job repelling down that tower for sure Thats kind of really what its all about Yes Rangers are going to need to repel down mountains But its also putting fears and putting things in front of them that theyre scared of doing and showing them that they can still overcome that I think thats a good thing I think thats a good thing I think thats the best thing Ive ever done For the next few hours each of them gets a turn number four of three times over pounds We didnt have to worry about the rest of the day Once we didnt have to worry about the rest of the day Well see you next time Its a very fast ride on the road Its a bit more difficult to ride on the road Its a bit difficult to ride on the road Its a bit more difficult to ride on the road Next we must conquer the slide for life A meter flying fox If were going to get a ride well have to go to the island Its a seven second expressway to safety or injury If youre going to ride on the road youll have to ride on the road If youre not able to ride on the road youll have to ride on the road The road is very difficult Not carrying a bike here wont show Were going to ride on the road because were going to ride on the road If youre not able to ride on the road youll have to ride on the road Next up is amphibious training Summer cruts are weak swimmers This phase will aim to weed out those that cant make the grade Recruits will be thrown into this foot deep river blind folded and in full combat gear weighing kilograms The aim is to first disorient them then see if they can calmly recover and reach the surface You imagine if youre not a strong swimmer they had kilograms to you theyd blindfold you and then theyd throw you in a foot river with a rope attached to you I can imagine if you cant swim theyre not a good swimmer thatd be terrifying', 'The recruits may have conquered their fear of the tower but things are about to get tougher All their weeks of training will be put to the test And this time if they make the same mistakes they could pay the ultimate price In the Philippines an elite force was formed to counter the nations communist and Islamist insurgencies They are the Marine Force recon battalion who are ready to take action at any moment on land sea and air Quick reaction falls The day they have all been training for has arrived It is jump week Today it is fly or fail The recruits will have to exit from an aircraft at feet and land safely a total of five times in order to earn their silver wings If you are not convinced you will be able to get two seconds from the government Yes sir But that is just a monitor They will be jumping out of a bell UH helicopter This aircraft is used to drop troops into remote areas for an assault taking the enemy by surprise The drop zone looks like any area of scrub land But if you are coming at it from feet it is a minefield of potential hazards It is a minefield Despite five weeks of training their first jump from the aircraft is exposing all of their mistakes What is the best jump I hope you will get a nice stomachache and you will be able to get better I hope you will get better I hope you will get better I hope you will be able to get better I hope you will get better You are going to get better You are going to jump You are going to jump True to being a Marine they have to be ready for anything even landing on unexpected terrain What happened last night Do you want to leave We are putting out the supplies for discussed I will give you subscribe this mission It is good for us to take pictures compared to the trade wave So like Andrea was speaking we paid back money with INTH Despite the unconventional landing were crewed passes and moves on to his next jump But for one recruit this is his last jump for a long time His right leg is broken and it will be another two years before its strong enough for him to jump again The rest of the airborne class is getting the hang of it But there is a problem Training has been stopped We didnt have to do the entire schedule of the aircraft We had to do the same for the rest of the day The rest of the day the rest of the day the rest of the day the rest of the day the rest of the day the rest of the day the rest of the day The aircraft has been called away to an operation in Isabella Northern Philippines The conflict this time coming from the countrys year struggle with communist insurgents Its not easy to make the most of the time to get out of the plane Its a very serious situation its a very basic training of the dumpers and then wait for tomorrow With just a jump away from receiving the coveted silver wings all the recruits can do is wait nervously Nobody knows if theyll have the chance to pass the course or if this conflict means all their hard work will be for nothing I guess theyll get it done and pass out It is the final week of the airborne course After days of waiting the recruits finally have a chance to complete the five jumps to earn their wings Okay next is the thing its the first jumper jumper jumper Oh pass out this time Its not easy There are four jumps the jumpers and the three jumps are per day Just as the first team jump strong winds halt the training This weather is the most dangerous time for jumping and one recruit is missing Were going to get the two of us together Were going to be able to get the wings back The wind has caught recruit one Its a small injury but with a strong wind it could have been much easier Were going to get the wings back Were going to get the wings back This is a big blow The wind has caught recruit one Its a small injury but with a strong wind it could have been much worse Finally a break in the weather Recruits and the rest of their group are on their final jump The last two jumps are over I think we have a lot of jumps We have qualified airworts Were going to get the wings back Were going to get the wings back I have just arrived Im going to get the wings back Im going to get the wings back Look at that Were going to get the wings back Its a big blow Theyre going to get the wings back Its a small injury but with a strong wind it could have been much worse Were going to get the wings back Were going to get the wings back The wings are going to be open This is the moment theyve all been working towards Theyre fifth and final jump The one that will finally earn them their silver wings That looks insane They just couldnt all land it correctly and passed the course Their feast Im sorry Im sorry No No No And Sarapu for the time being I was just kidding The moment you jump but the moment you jump Im really scared Sarapu is really scared so I cant go Sarapu get out of here After six weeks of intense physical and mental training they have now earned the right to be called Airborne Right up from the sea Airborne Airborne This is a ritual Welcome to Airborne Family So basically you get your pins stuck into your chest If you dont have it you can do it Im sorry Im sorry Im sorry Sihun Airborne This is the first time youve seen this a very interesting video This is the Philippines Red blood Lets go Tripai Airborne Airborne Airborne Thank you very much Im really looking forward to the real fight I hope you will be able to get your pins on the map Yeah I really enjoyed this video Slightly

you enjoyed this video consider subscribing Leave a comment I will try and reply if its within the first couple of days And also if you enjoyed this video give it a like It really helps the channel Thanks very much guys and Ill see you in the next video Take care', 'For the men and women hoping to join the prestigious ranks of the force recon theyre now entering phase two of their airborne course Here they must face the dreaded tower of hell where they will be tested on exiting and malfunction drills while speeding down a zip line over meters Its the first time they will find out if they really have what it takes to be airborne One small step into thin air takes a huge amount of courage If Vertigo kicks in they will fail the course The instruction is there The riser is there The riser is there The back is there The feeling is there We are excited This is the last phase of training Before the final jump Its spring up and going to one to four Grab your reserve spin your head and get together Check your malfunction Go go go go Go go go The instructors are looking for confidence when exiting the aircraft because hesitation could lead to an uncontrollable spin and possible death This is the moment of truth for candidate one Its normal to have a ride but its still a long ride Its like youre going to be a fighter Youre going to be a fighter Go go go Nice Go go There are many different types of machines Posing tower a lot of energy a lot of energy a lot of energy most common in the first day because we were the week exit And the grading of reserve So its not that hard to perform Because they are the ones who are going to do this one week to be able to do the jump week Alongside proper techniques the instructors have come up with their own special remedy to help spur on the nervous recruits What is it We are going to do this in the evening to get the rope We are going to have a very good time We are going to have a very good time Its a very good time candidate six is one of the lucky first to try We are going to put a lipstick to put it on the camera One one we are going to have a ride The girls are sure Go Is it anything Not up no no lets go Lets go At the end of the zip line a rope stops the recruits from hitting the trees Next up is female recruit one of the seven women trying to make the grade But shes in trouble Pitch it in there Pitch it in there Damn conditions are making it difficult to stop Ooh Hello why We are going to have a ride We are going to have a ride We are going to have a ride We are going to have a ride We are going to have a ride We are going to have a ride We are going to have a ride These men of the Force Recon are the first amongst equals Of the Marines today only have earned the right to wear this badge of honor But they only get there that they successfully pass some of the toughest training in the Philippine Armed Forces When forward observers need to be sent far behind enemy lines the Force Recon battalion send their eight men teams But they dont go alone Theyre joined by a deadly team of Marine Scout Snipers Nice They are the top priority units in the Philippine Armed Forces They are the ones who have the right to wear these The Marine Scout Snipers are masters of camouflage and marksmanship Nice Living up to their motto one shot one kill One kill To pass the final stage of sniper training they must put their own lives on the line This is the confidence firing test A mistake in this live fire exercise doesnt just mean failing the course It could mean instant death for their calm radon arms Oh my God This is worse than the Philippine Scout Its designed to replicate the psychological pressure of a real operation Oh my God I know the way to do it I know the way to do it Thats it of sniper trainees fail this sharpshooting course Either by not making the grade or backing out on this final confidence test The members of the airborne class are in week four the towering phase This stage is key in perfecting the proper exiting procedure from an aircraft Each day the challenge of carrying more gear has been added This is a quick release Its a very good one Its a very good release Its a good release because its a good one Its a good one Today the jump has to be made wearing full combat gear all kilograms and carrying a weapon Its a good one Its a good one Its a good one Bring up your hands Elbow clip Head back in All certain All certain All certain Its a good one The example of the rifle or the pack the same as the one on the ground The proper damage of the reserve The one that we mentioned earlier the one that will be the elbow sticking out the reserve you need to reserve The reserve you need to reserve in the village Thats it Its a good release Its a good release The reserve you need to reserve Traveling at over kilometers an hour there is it much time to think Everything has to be done by instinct or there wont be enough time to pull your reserve and save your life The reserve you need to reserve The reserve you need to reserve The reserve you need to reserve The reserve you need to reserve The reserve you need to reserve The reserve you need to reserve The reserve you need to reserve The reserve you need to reserve The reserve you need to reserve The reserve you need to reserve The reserve you need to reserve The reserve you need to reserve The reserve

the jump and the airborne class is putting in some last minute practice Let Wait for me Im going to go to the ocean and go Check in the pain and pick up a roll Hanto Hanto Hanto Hanto Hanto Hanto Im far positional Im so very big at the phone As they contemplate the final hours before their last test the recruits share some lighter moments Its keen strengthening the ties of brotherhood amongst Marines This is the training of the Marisa Pakeira But they are still training after the training So we are in the sea and we are in the forest So I dont know what to do I dont know what to do I dont know what to do Im just not Im just not Im just not Depending on these bombs is how the elite teams overcome enemy forces It is a matter of life and death Because behind enemy lines the only thing they can depend on is each other']"

motorbike for two days while we are here in cebu so the negotiated rate was pesos a day and pesos for delivery so theyre going to bring it from their shop over to the coffee shop where we are at it seems like its a better place to do that than manila because when we were there the traffic was kind of crazy and even for Note he was like im not sure about renting a bike so cebu is the place to do it Cebu seems to be a little more relaxed and calm so im confident i have confidence in you too where are you from im from thailand wow thats why you look like a filipino yeah yeah wow thats good that

it from mr jackie yeah yeah hi welcome philippines just to ensure we protect ourselves Note is just taking a video around the bike to make sure the scratches that are already there we document them but jackie has been really helpful he was telling us that parking usually is like pesos and you pay the enforcers on the street and also you cant just park anywhere so theyre like designated parking spots so this is all really useful information because we probably would just have parked anywhere because in thailand thats what you do so were glad that he told us that']"

Filipina expects this My belief NEVER do this NEVER suck up and NEVER apologise for something you dont even understand This is just reinforcing and in fact rewarding some very negative and destructive behavior Tampo is not the behavior of an adult who is committed to her marriage Its spoiltchild behavior and shouldnt be tolerated let alone rewarded And unless you did something where you really should have known better about ie unless you cheated on her or acted like a complete pig then you deserved for this to have been handled in a mature waynot this way So yes thinking about it if shes having tampo because you did something bad then sure Do all the malambing you can And more importantly apologise sincerely and try not to do it again But not because you failed your mindreading class at school', 'So I thought I would talk about the huge differences As I said in one last video of this the differences in culture are so deeply ingrained that they are beyond just reading or listening or watching a video about you need to be here and you need to be steeped into the culture itself you need to be impacted by the culture this is the thing in other words its one thing for me to tell you that I couldnt I couldnt get when I first came when I first came to the hall I tried to go out our first aid kit didnt have any band aids so what could be what could be more basic a building block for first aid I mean we even used the idea of the band aid for doing the first vehicle solution action for any problem or you know its just putting a band aid over it isnt its not really a problem I went out I went to all of the drug stores and none of them had a band now its one thing for me to tell you that and for you to go oh gosh youre not doing it but its another thing do I actually be walking from one one place to another and talking to someone who is looking at you as if youre asked for a quick course in brain surgery its just asking for a band aid a lot of that is my fault if I dont speak my language or not but um then Ill think second here which I believe I can explain it but you cant understand it well if you when you want to understand something this is you think about something you dont know Im approaching the brow of the hill and it was is coming the other way on my side of the road thats why I proposed just that it pulled in in time thankfully as you know the road Im still here thats one of the things that you need to experience it is to say oh my god what customers are without their supercars and theyre on the wrong side of the road coming toward me because they intend to do a left turn over to my right these these are things that rocks now is done here and you can come over then you can say listen listen listen for the views and I know how to do this and its easier youll like it no theyre working they do are there on the thing themselves one of the decks that is the least understandable is the traffic coming from the right the right way imagine the national highway and were driving along that this case k and a half and someone who is entering the national highway on a motorcycle with two or three people on it and they come straight out into the road without looking quick right turn so that they join you you can use your foreign western project and say look that cant be right because if he doesnt look then he could actually be run down no kidding thats the truth so well now that weve sorted that out all we have to do is put him in the bed but he never would have he stopped doing that all day thats the way that its done so knowing that its done that way you the bus you have to change why would he change and do something which is not so safe not so sensible not so logical because that is the way that its done in this country well we know how to do it better you know how to do it different everything is different here', 'How are we doing babe Oh can I have a time in Shagal Okay I was like what then How are we That is like whole different area Thats why I was like what are you on this day me Pretty good Im going to win Im not too sure about that Look at this move then Boom Okay playing games Alright back to the topic at hand Ive got to say that the people in the Philippines are just the most smiling behind people that I havent met during my travels Right from the getgo when I came here during COVID there was a lot of restrictions But yet the individual people are always super family to us Yeah Really proud to help us out in any way they could What do you say Yeah and as I said when my mom was here which she was like falling people always tried to help And thats what were going to be feeling all the time Relic people actually wants to help Like genuinely want to help Its not a question about money Its not a question about favors and refares Its all about just a genuine like friendliness I agree And I think I said this on this channel already I remember my first encounter with somebody who wanted to guide me the way And Im like does this guy want to scam us Does he want money And I literally just refused to receive any help Because Im like no no no You know as a tourist coming to a Southeast Asian country like oh is this person going to like I dont know what is happening here No youre not used to that friendliness And I must say although having that first entry to Southeast Asia through Thailand I thought that Thai people are very very friendly But I do have to say Filipino people are just next level They invited to their home Although they just saw you on the street they would drink beer with you cook for you Very great posts Ill put you out wherever they can Always have a smile on their face even like during craziest traffic on the outside in Manila you will not see any sort of road rage You know they would just kind of look to the right look to the left and if people make eye contact with you theyre just smiling And thats what I love on a daytoday basis about the life in the Philippines I love that Yes Yes Thank you Yeah And I think this is also how were solving for the notpining good food in the Philippines We find the right places This is a great vegan place in Shagana Oh thats plenty in Shagana And we always love the food here And this time its Tempura Tufo and Tufo Chinese style Very again Yeah that dog wants a bite Is there some for me please Yes Aww That

'judo', 'fighting']","['FMA or the Filipino martial arts is more than just a selfprotection system but more of a gift to bridge communities of protection around the globe Because I feel like all martial arts is not about defense for fighting I think its all about discipline like the main focus The indigenous style of fighting collectively known as Filipino martial arts or FMA was originally used to defend tribes from attacks by other clans or to set a local dispute It focused on the use of bladed weapons and was taught to every member of a family both men and women So it is mainly one thing This is before the Philippines was colonized by Spain in under whom the practice was banned But Filipinos continued to secretly train by using sticks instead of blades and hiding the forms and moves in other artistic expressions You would see that FMA movements could be seen in certain cultural dances in the country taught to very young children You would see that there is music there is costumes the maglalatik but So its a lot like the what is that Brazilian martial arts where they it looks like theyre break dancing all the time I cant even think of the name but thats kind of like what that is Its all about fluid and motion and movement And not everybody can do that because theyre bouncing around and basically break dancing but still putting a lot of power into their kicks and punches and movements and stuff Yeah So thats kind of cool Thats kind of how they adopted it because they had to you know for all intents and purposes they wanted to keep it but they had to learn how to be able to hide it Right You know thats so thats cool is what that is In coconut shells our position in the bodies that would symbolize strike points and slash points for attack You would see paired fandangos using the lights wherein evasive tactics and these arms would be seen The very popular tini kling that we have is veiding and putting in the footwork strategies on the beat of a bamboo could be seen and this is very much Filipino and very akin to the culture', 'Hey its Jake Mace with JakeMacecom here with Paul from KaliCentercom Pauls been telling me that Kali guys train for practical selfdefense for the street So he had two moves that he thinks are done very commonly in street fighting And how to use Kali to defend against them Then Ill show you two from Kung Fu Paul Its the first attack if Im the attacker All right so really common we got the haymaker so as the haymaker comes in in Kali Everythings a target so were gonna break the hand using the elbow Were gonna come out break the elbow using the hack of the form Then well just go ahead and follow up finishing up with a knee Well that series of Movement there is no way Its so penetrative on the efficient movement She showed us the slow movement for the instruction but the actual speed is gonna be much faster I believe So youre hitting my fist with the elbow and hovering with your other hand Thats it Cool All right and then were gonna scoop that around and Hack right on to your elbow to break the elbow and then give him a knee So a little bit more Oh Good Yeah I want to see so smooth and efficient movement the enemy cant make the counter attack in this such a fast flow On a bit more flow Yeah I cant look One more time get I can feel the power of Kali Whats the next attack the round kick coming right into the thigh for me the attacker This is a very high percentage move because low kicks can land very easily And we know how devastating those kicks can be youve ever been kicked by somebody skillful and kicking in the leg takes you out The way that we cover this is when hes that kicks coming in and we use the knee destruction I see the points of the body Right to destroy their tools I dont want to be interesting I didnt recognize I didnt realize this Its so easy protection Yeah that that kick movement is really famous movement in Kung Fu style Many Kung Fu must try that kick for that in the first movement to you know check You know the enemys ability but if the enemy performs such a protection a Kung Fu guys legs could be damaged Right so whoa so efficient protection kick even no even a training it sucks even with shingards on and I could tell its gonna hurt Why dont want to keep it I could tell the hundred and five little Be scary to jump out like and tell this is gonna break my leg And this is still about not the hard way Thats it This also happens a lot in a tie boxing a lot Sometimes the kicks will catch the knee and youll just youll see when they step back with their shin Youll see the leg just fold because the shin is just cracking and you have a quick fall up to this Yeah so the first part were gonna go a quick one Boom scoop kick to the groin and were step in and take them down from here Boom break it Get the groin and then step in and see this is a kidding method As kicking the balls um its not really a beautiful A movement but you know to kill people Its really a reasonable movement They come down So they pull those two moves very practical I like him from calling', 'Eskreema versus Iado which martial art is better If you are familiar with martial arts then you would have heard about Eskreema and Iado These are two commonly known martial arts within the martial arts circle In this video well be exploring their history their primary objectives and conclude by giving our opinion on which of these two martial arts we believe is better Whats through to the end to find out what we think Im really impressed with the people who think about this situation this video Fantastic idea All right with that done lets get down to business Also known as Arnes or Kali Eskreema is the national martial art of the Philippines It is a martial art that is focused on the use of weapons and incorporates a range of them including sticks knives blades Oh that is Bruce Lee right Hes doing Kali as well So he took it into one of his martial arts Really Oh now Im really impressed with Kali more Wow I didnt know that He did weapons and other improvised weapons Despite its emphasis on weapons Eskreema involves open hand combat techniques as well I know this must have The origin of Eskreema can be traced back to a period of intense conflicts between several preHispanic Filipino tribes or kingdoms Some theories link the origin of Eskreema to India These theories insist that the martial art arrived at the Philippine islands thanks to travelers who came through Indonesia and Malaysia having picked up the ancient Indian martial art salam bomb I didnt know that So so Kali has been affected by many countries martial arts Indonesia India I know some of my subscribers insist that you know Kali is from Indonesia or some of his colleagues from Malaysia India I know Now I know what they are meaning On their way to the Philippines the more predominant narrative however is that Eskreema was practiced among the native Filipino people many of whom were commoners who lived in poverty The martial art was not known to be practiced amongst many of the societys elite and noble people Early records written by the first Spanish explorers to visit the Philippine islands indicate that a weaponbased martial art was widely practiced amongst the natives before their arrival Although direct links between this ancient martial art and modern Eskreema have not been well established many believe that the link exists Early Spanish records report that the first Spanish settlers fought native tribesmen armed with sticks and knives two prominent weapons of choice in the modern day Eskreema While the Philippines was eventually conquered by the Spanish it is unclear how much of an influence the Spanish rule had on Eskreema as a martial art but most historians agree that there was a considerable influence as is reflected in the name Eskreema After the Spanish colonized the Philippines a decree was made that prohibited civilians from carrying fullsized swords like the crease or the campalan This however did not stop practitioners of Eskreema as they found a way to keep the art alive by resorting to sticks made of retan in place of swords They also used small knives as weapons and wielded them like swords in combat So I guess Karambeads comes from this era as well Modern Eskreema combines the native fighting techniques of the Philippines with old Spanish fencing techniques and over time a degree of systematization has established this martial art as unique to the Philippines There is a culture of blade carrying in the Philippines implying that people in the Philippines are more So Cali taking many good things from the strong martial arts from every country and getting stronger and stronger and the God one of the strongest martial arts in the world now Wow that makes sense thats so strong Likely to carry a knife than a gun Although many of the people in the Philippines carry knives for their daytoday activities especially farmers and food vendors these knives which can be so easily concealed can also double as devastating combat weapons This culture is a reflection of the martial art style of the Philippines Students learning Eskreema are taught to fight with weapons from the onset and are only allowed to advance to empty hand training after they have mastered stick and knife techniques Many Eskreema systems begin by training students with two weapons which could be a pair of sticks or a combination of a stick and a wooden knife This method of combat trains the students to be ambidextrous as they are taught never to move both hands in the same direction Another feature of Eskreema called the live hand involves the use of a free hand to control trap or disarm the opponents weapon The free hand is also used to block attacks from the opponent or to execute simultaneous motions of the arm such as a technique called the bicep destruction The most notable weapons used in Eskreema are a range of sticks edged weapons including a variety of blades and other flexible weapons such as a sarong ikud latigo and tabak toyak all of which are different kinds of ropes Now to the Japanese martial art Iado Iado is a martial art that relies heavily on the use of the Japanese long sword called the katana The martial art focuses on the mastering of sword drawing techniques that are performed with smooth and efficient motion to devastating effect While Iado can be an aggressive martial art practitioners are trained to develop an imposing presence and a mental pressure that they use to dissuade an opponent as much as they can Mental is also really important for you Iado Until the only option left is to resort to the katana Nevertheless a key feature of this martial art is to train practitioners to be extremely alert and able to draw out their swords quickly to respond to sudden attacks In line with this Iado has four major components The first is the smooth and controlled movement involved in drawing your sword from its scabard This is followed by striking or cutting the opponent to inflict damage after which the blood on the blade is carefully removed and the sword is placed into its scabard All these ought to be done in smooth sweeping motions New students usually practice Iado using a wooden sword also known as a bokeh for safety reasons You didnt know that Otherwise they could use a blunt edge sword called Iato More experienced practitioners are however allowed to use a sharp edge sword and train it Wow Despite the history of Iado the hundreds of styles of swordmanship involved in this martial art subscribe to noncombative aims and purposes In many ways see this is what Im said some right X Yeah actually its filmed So if you guys have a chance you should watch it differently You can see the how strongly the Iado is As Iado is a reflection of the morals of the classical Japanese warrior and this martial art is ultimately seen as a means to develop a person in spiritual harmony who also possesses high intellect resolute will and sensitivity Thats so impossible movement though Thats so film I dont know what Im saying It is for this reason that Iado is often performed and practiced as a solo art Practitioners execute their style and form against one or more imaginary opponents and an activity known as Kata The nonfighting aspect of Iado means that its primary emphasis is on the precise controlled fluid motion executed by the practitioner Cool']"

I heard the last time life is fantastic yeah I cant see what the bad thing about it I mean a bad relationship in the UK yeah theyre good theyre different for sure here if they love you they love you okay unconditionally lets see theres past experiences like yeah I think I love you but um yeah maybe not so unconditionally yeah thats why theres so many people coming over I think to Asia like this whole like passport Bros movement and all that Asia on the whole Id say theyre probably all loving kind caring people but Philippines especially and theyve got the language yeah so theres no language about it but if you look at it I mean I know if youre good look at Germany UK anywhere a lot of the nurses and doctors are from the Philippines yeah definitely because they are carrying theyre caring risks yeah so even in Canada a lot of Filipino nurses and theyre not teachers and everything okay now a little bit about her family are you close with your wifes family yeah yeah my mother died a few years back married she was a I actually knew the family before I met my life okay so it was a crazy I lived in a province for a couple years before I met my wife but I used to play football with some

you have a family before I met my wife okay Im just kind of kind of strange and otherwise nothing was the barangay captain and it kind of well respected within that community so yeah basically mines a good story okay Ive heard some bad stories out there but yeah mines a good one now I hear some nightmare stories about family expectations is that true like does your family expect you to pay for them as well no um yes and no I I have never I guess I was lucky because real life he set the standards before I got involved in that family sort of thing but theyve never asked for anything but theyre all establishing their own right so remember in those lto the traffic department um so yeah theyre successful in their own right so Ive never been asked okay I do know other people that yeah you know itll cost you ten thousand just to you know again thats thats good for some people not for not for others yeah definitely a parttime relationship you go back to the voice of your own country yeah you know

actually not as easy as it used to be but that would be another another video and it would require a little bit more research on my part and I dont have it right now So were going to go with what I know from just from today Now when Beth and I got married we did a few trips on trying to get documents settled notarized authorized I had an old Volkswagen which the documentation was incomplete on Well that was back before President Deterty came in and started saying if youre planning on being corrupt you better watch out because Im going to get you and so people were more corrupt and we were advised we went up to we took the ferry up to Manila and then from Manila we took a bus up to Magalacat which is where the Volkswagen was My ancient Volkswagen What I did was I made the mistake of not having a CR which is a certificate of registration and it has to be the original So yet to have certain documentation and and Philippine this Philippinos can be quite difficult on this They will shunt you off in another direction is what happens So we had trouble there because we didnt have proper proper documentation and Beth went today to get her passport Now you would think that that was very simple wouldnt you I mean if you try together a passport in in other countries it really is fairly straightforward as long as you have the most simple documentation Now why is it not simple in the Philippines Now my experience is its not simple in the Philippines because not everything here is done by computer Now anybody who uses a computer and that must be most people in the world right now Anybody who knows will know that its very easy to correct a mistake but if youre typing allfashioned remember that people used to type letters Well theyre still doing that here apparently And so in some offices theyre theyre typing stuff out Now what this lays them open to is typos and a typo is not simply a matter of sending the cursor back deleting and putting the right letter in Its not as easy as that if youre as old as me or remember that you use that white paper You stick it in behind the type where its going to strike straight on the same letter again it whites it out and then you write the right one in Well its a lot easier nowadays but there are still places where thats how things are being done When we bought our bike our motorcycle we went and signed up for that It was typed out on an old clanking thing where you put your finger down and press it down and you need a strong finger']"

his girlfriend Jessica It wasnt until we arrived that we understood the true devastation of the typhoon and how close of a call some of my family had Hello how are you We are coping My relative Rebecca picked me up from the airport As our trip went on she began to reveal her breathtaking typhoon experience to us This arena didnt they use it as a Yes an evacuation center and But then it flooded right Yes the water was up to that brim Everything by this side was destroyed Luke Look at the water damage all the way up to beyond the roof Thats what nobody expected was the storm surge Yes because before Yolanda struck the weather was like this it was fine Three weeks prior to the typhoon Gil was having a shortness of breath Yeah yeah So we decided not to move because Tacloban is near hospitals and if the storm came we could leave if and there was no ride available we could just walk to the hospital This used to be a big beautiful house but now its roofless This is from my work I didnt use it because I was reserving it for something some kind of a souvenir from my work We started running to the second floor Our things were all floating Oh yeah Yeah They were running after us This is the place where I saved some stuff because the water started to subside when it was already here So you put it in there Yeah Just to keep it dry Because of the strength of the water we ran up there This is where we saved ourselves Here this portion here We were about people here Wow Yeah And the rain was so hard And you know that this building was shaking When the water was up and the rain was so hard the building was shaking I thought this building would be destroyed And I was looking at this I said if the building will be destroyed we will hold on to this And then what did the ocean look like Everywhere was water Everything was destroyed And the people there who did not evacuate they all died My gosh How long were you up here About three hours Wow About three hours Until the water subsided And we thought it would never subside Wow We thought it will just keep on coming up And you know my neighbors they evacuated when the water was already up here And so they had to climb the gate and they had to negotiate the grills And those grills were designed to keep burglars away and they were something like you know it was a little sharp Those were the grills that I was telling you They sustained certain wounds in their skin and in their body But as long as theyre alive thats what matters you know Yeah then the water subsided at about and it subsided so fast but the wind it was still strong The wind was still strong and we could not go down until two oclock in the afternoon because you know you will be blown by the wind Youll be blown by the wind And it was slippery all over There was a store on the other side of the street and she had rice they had soft drinks and they started doing the so they will survive We didnt have anything We were having breakfast then when the storm was already starting to grow So what did you do for the next few days At about pm about pm we started walking towards DNG towards my parents house and it took us about three hours Oh and they have food and everything there We left three here and then on the street we saw some bananas somebody was selling some bananas And so I bought it for pesos a bunch And I bought three I bought it for Oh my goodness these are pictures of Oh my goodness childhood pictures So these things you carried up just to save Yeah but you know the water destroyed them It was such a mess', 'Its really good and Im happy to see you again in my channel Im Sylvia and Im your host Before we even start this video Id like to tell you that my heart goes to all of those whove been severely affected by this environmental disaster which is Typhoon Rye Okay my heart also goes to the environment because this typhoon doesnt just ruin cities and homes but it also ruins the environment you know like forests and such Now having said that last week I reacted to a news video about this horrible typhoon A subscriber saw that video and contacted me and suggested that I react to another video called typhoon Odette right Hits Shiaragau Dina Gat Southern Late Table Hall and Sibu Bagyeon Okay but I thought that I wasnt just going to react to the video I thought that we should do something different here So I did some research and I tried to look up some organizations that can help with you know the destruction that this typhoon did in the Philippines And I found six I will put the links in the description and I will pin it in the comments So we got Palapino Workers Center UNICEF Center of Disaster Philanthropy Global Giving Local Lab and Kids for Kids okay I leave it at your discretion if youd like to help okay But personally I will give however much I can but for those of you who want to help but cant what were going to do is your job basically is just going to have to share this video as much as you can because the amount that it will garner in hours I will give that money as well to one of these organizations all right So the more its shared the more its viewed and the more basically money it will garner So yeah thats what I will be doing with the amount of money that the video will garner in hours Now you know everything but before we start consider following me on Instagram at Music Game News and if you have a preferred choice of these organizations that I should give the money to let me know in the comment section below because Im not familiar with all these organizations The only one that I know is UNICEF but UNICEF I dont know if it actually has anything to do with the Philippines but you know like Palapino Workers Center it has Filipino in it Global Giving Local Lab I think all the other ones are actual Filipino organizations so those sound more legit to me like I want to give to a Filipino organization So if you can help me out with that Id be grateful If I dont have any suggestions then I will just have to donate to any of these organizations']"

'miguel san', 'businessman', 'led san', 'miguel corporation', 'san miguel']","['and were very crucial years for Ramon Ang Because it saw a global financial recession and continued growth through mergers and acquisitions from San Miguel Corporation We all remember that time Because we know thats San Miguel Brewery Secondly they had also gone on to acquire the Bank of Commerce which led the corporation to enter the banking industry Despite being in the middle of a global recession San Miguel Corporation continued to acquire major companies and strived hard to see a continued change in business dynamics In a shocking event would however unfold Ramon Ang which was now years old is looking to retire In an interview with the Wall Street Journal Ramon Ang said that Ive always planned to stop working and enjoy my time when Im The Wall Street Journal is for you Ramon Ang for his role in National Foods in which they use some of those proceeds to acquire stakes in Pitchron Corporation and Manila Electric Corporation Unfortunately two years have passed by and Ramon Ang does not seem to have retired He would go on to experience the biggest breakthrough of his career In he led the company to stage big investments They had announced a billion dollar merger and acquisition spray and so after bought Philippine Airlines they had also Thats insane Thats insane and through its conglomerate status led them to enter the infrastructure business But that was not the big breakthrough of Mr Ang After he led the company into growth he went on to acquire a stake for himself Yes at that point Ramon Ang was just acting as somewhat of a leader of the San Miguel Corporation He was not the owner of the company Neither was he even a major shareholder But by he swooped in and bought of San Miguel which was million shares priced at about pesos each for a total of about million pesos And as time showed neither his retirement nor his small would stay the same He would go on to Imagine having that money to just buy As a topranked shareholder For that Wow He holds about of San Miguel as of the time of this writing One could now understand just how Ramon Ang went from being a normal businessman in the Philippines to taking San Miguel Corporation in his hands', 'Some of the most notable feeds about Ramon Ang are not specifically about his daytoday operations But rather how he helped the corporation target its goals to enable expansion by acquisitions and new facilities He took a small stake in Phil Webb but in San Miguel Corporations view He was there when the company had eyeed local and international expansion in Ang and San Miguel announced a two billion pesos bottling facility plant for one of its alcoholic beverages known as Junibrasi He named Bra around Batangas It was also reported by Financial Times London that San Miguel has been looking to Asia for its next rapid revenue growth The news magazine in an interview with Mr Clonco stated that he was hoping that San Miguel would increase its presence around Southeast Asia including China and Taiwan to allow What a second I thought that San Miguel was already really close Despite the Philippine economy being sluggish By San Miguel had announced a production facility in Malaysia that would target the local country and also Singapore The Johor Baru facility as stated by Mr Ang would enable San Miguel to lower its cost of business And that plan was to acquire a hectare property in a greenfield project A year prior however in Guren Beverages company a Japanese conglomerate had acquired a stake in San Miguel Which was reported to be good for the country and for the economy Finally one of the last few major acquisitions done in was when San Miguel acquired a Malaysian packaging firm Which Mr Ang has cited that they had confidence in Malaysia for its probusiness policies By San Miguel Corporation was now rocking the entire Philippines market Their sales revenue totalled billion pesos in And billion by And is now looking to target billion pesos How are they going to do it Well Ang had led San Miguel in the acquisition of a major Australian company Which it bought for a whopping billion US National Foods their acquired company was a leading company in the entire food and beverages industry But Ang has stated that he was a very expensive acquisition Which led them to consider selling at least of the company to minimize cash outlay But surprisingly they did not sell of the company But rather of the company took care of the Japanese shareholder of San Miguel for a price tag of over billion In just two short years Lets go profit San Miguel profit more than a billion dollars Even when they held the company as a subsidiary it was already making profits for the parent company National Foods contributed billion pesos or million Australian dollars with million pesos in operating income from billion And an official million in operating income by', 'Yes San Miguel Corporation we know that he is one million corporate leaders out there But what we need to understand is how how did he get to where he is Thats what Im asking myself as well We need to understand the letter he had gone into and the actions he had taken led San Miguel Corporation to where it is today We can trace where Mr Ang first started where he first appeared on the board of directors for San Miguel in when he was at the age of many had assumed that he was merely the chairmans glorified executive assistant Who was at the time known as bending coancho who recently took over Andre Sorianos chair Nothing was known about Mr Ang he had no business affiliation stated in the companys annual report and was all but a close friend of Coancho son yet upon an interesting Coancho he had praised Ang for Impressively turning around his cement manufacturing firm and was described by Coancho as a successful businessman Upon appointment as the And was noted by San Miguel executives as the one who had already been running San Miguels daytoday operations and to whom the companys president was reporting I mean imagine running a business bad big and being the chief operating officer Its just its crazy to me Ive been a chief operating officer but in my own company Nothing like corporate company and that was already just for so Kudos to you His stage as the already elected vice chairman Ang was not just like some business men out there He was already very wealthy an old source in by the far Eastern economic review of Hong Kong estimated that he was worth at least not bad at all and much of his wealth came directly from his heavy equipment business Importation and property a year later as the dawn of the st century Ramon Ang is seen to be strategizing the future of San Miguel Corporation On January it was reported that he was finding investors for a possible billion pesos for a climate plan somewhere in Roxas Boulevard one of his potential investors was the famed Hong Kong billionaire Lee Kaxin but that very project would stumble upon challenges leading to a supreme court battle by San Miguel would yet again come into rocky roads the government was still against the entire chairmanship of Mr Kohanko and there were fears that if the government took the stake in the company He and Ang would step down Fortunately I didnt know that the government has stake in San Miguel Corporation That is very new to me at least but that explains a lot happen by Ramon Ang would be named the official president of San Miguel But as some have noted he was already running the daytoday Corporation and the title was nothing but a formalization in the same year Ramon Ang was seen taking up a big stake in Phil Webb Which was equivalent to about of the company Phil Webb was a big company mostly operating in the casino industry']"

a little piece of your life Or you can have a YouTube channel which is what I have right now And you can have people listen to you or not Actually I might be talking to a blank monitor here for all I know But this is what changed when the internet came along Because now somebody I think it was someone like Stephen King who only had to go into a publisher and he would receive an advance of many thousands of dollars on his next book before hed completed more than a synopsis or a chapter So he decided that he was going to go straight into the internet and he had an editor that he worked with They produced the book and he went into the internet and he did his thing And he sold his book for just a few dollars Now that must have seemed like insanity because anybody who purchased a Stephen King book had probably been quite used to paying for it And here he could buy a book for Kendall and he would be able to read the same book on his computer for two or three or maybe five dollars not much at all Now was Stephen King only making a little No actually he was making a lot more because even a top writer from a book might actually only be earning maybe two dollars I dont know three dollars Or sometimes one dollar But they sell a million and that works out at a tidy figure But now its changed and any writer can publish online and sell for a dollar They can sell for And if you have people on your computer who are trying to get you to look at a book and theyve got it and theyre giving it away for free statistically if a writer with an ebook gives away a book it will widen its scope it will widen its audience and people who havent bought it will step up and buy it where they might not have done if the book had never been given away Its a funny thing to happen But now so now its possible for an unknown writer to earn two dollars on a book whereas he probably couldnt even have gotten it read Ive got friends who are incredibly talented and have their manuscripts that theyve tried to get published by the normal the traditional way in book form so that somebody takes home something that looks like this And their manuscript comes back unopened With a note actually scratched on it saying were not accepting manuscripts unless weve asked for them which is so is it any wonder that the publishing companies companies overall have received quite a bloody nose about this', 'Thats forward a little bit So this woman has a couple of boyfriend through high school and even in college And what happens is she gets hurt You know she gets brokenhearted You know it happens to the best of everybody She gets hurt She gets brokenhearted So all of a sudden you know she kind of puts that masculine mask back on again right Because a masculine person cant get hurt The masculine energy is strong right So we dont want to be hurt So they put that back on What hurts Oh man it does Then they see their friends getting married and doing this and doing that So then they say hey you know what I kind of want that family thing You know I dont need a man but I kind of want that family thing I want that husband I want whatever anybody else has on Facebook Okay So she then puts that feminine mask on again to attract that man and then eventually husband But meanwhile what the husband doesnt know is this She is writing a book and its not men are from Mars women are from Venus No no no no The title of her book is women are from Venus I know my man is from Mars but once were married it wont take long for me to make sure that he permanently relocates to Venus and never goes back To Mars To Mars Did you show me how this works Its pretty basic really You just put your arms through here and then your head through here and bring it up So once this man has been married for a while maybe they have kids maybe they dont Hes kind of been in Venus for a while right I didnt realize I had to tell you every time I want to take a dumb life So now these two people are married right After she wrote that book and then shes followed that book to a blueprint Like her mission was keep him in Venus Shes done a pretty darn good job of that right Make sure to call me right when you get to the hotel not like that conference in Phoenix Do wait two hours for you to call me Yeah I was the keynote speaker I was late to the podium Still Yeah youre totally right Im sorry Everybodys heard this term somewhere out there in the world Happy wife Happy life I think the same person that wrote the book I just talked about wrote that I do begin I miss you Because one day while residing in Venus because thats what makes his wife happy he just doesnt feel like himself So he says you know what I need to go back to Mars for a little bit You know its just maybe a day or maybe a week I just need I need to go back to Mars I need to be there But as he makes this suggestion to go back to Mars the wife at this time then says you know let me remind you of something I dont need you I want this marriage I want what we have but I dont need you If you think you need to go to Mars then you by all means go to Mars But let me tell you something When you come back there will be no sex Youll be sleeping on the couch Thats if Im even here when you get back So then the man has a choice to make Its like holy cow If I go to Mars Im going to lose everything that I love If I go to Mars but if I dont go to Mars Im going to lose myself Is he all there Like mentally I think so Its just an odd guy Its kind of weird I mean should we be worried No No No No Tracy didnt mention that We shouldnt let him gamble or drink too much Jesus hes like a remnant Its an obstruction to shit So this man is in a pickle You know he has to choose between two things If he goes to Mars hes going to lose everything he loves Everything hes known However if he doesnt go to Mars hes going to lose everything he is Hes going to lose his soul And a man with no soul My eyes will be dead']"

'southeast asian', 'solar']","['Ok first of all this is a lot of information To the jest its like a lot of numbers a lot of facts So Im going to take a few notes off to rewatch it again And just get a quick picture of whats happening When its happening And when to make the decisions for myself You know I might be interested in investing in Solar Power in the Philippines Im just saying you know Right now we can however say that as this is a project connected to a private corporation It is therefore aimed to make a profit On the note of being a private entity We can also suggest that unlike other mega projects in the Philippines At the very least this will have zero Or hopefully little to do with politicians But the most important question raised for the partnership As these two major conglomerates is Where are they actually going to get billion dollars for million dollars Capital expenditure alone billion dollars after all is a massive amount of money Even Enrique Reison A Filipino billionaire who stands as the second richest man in the Philippines Is worth around billion dollars according to Forbes Does this suggest that he is going to finance all of these by himself Well it is not stated who is going to actually finance the project What is stated however is that it is almost a project Between solar Philippines and prime infrastructures Which can suggest that the cost may also be divided between the two Solar Philippines however may also seem to be cash ready The company itself recently listed its stock on the public stock exchange around late Which helped the company raise about billion pesos A further stock rates offering raised around late was also followed Which helped the company raise yet another billion pesos And finally as of the latest quarterly report The company has about billion pesos in total assets billion pesos of which are current assets Plus it is also possible that the project can be taken out as alone But anyway as we are unsure where the total money is actually going to be taken from Or probably another fundraising scheme sometime in the future Do still let us know what you think about this project And even if you know where they are going to take the money from Thanks for watching If you know let us know in the comments down below Look it is super insightful video', 'Going back to the gigalot project that is stated to become the worlds largest This small project Yes we mentioned it as small because it is just one part of the mega plan of solar Philippines You see Solar Philippines has a bold target to construct over gigawatts of power projects This is therefore almost thrice more than the socalled upcoming worlds largest solar park A huge feat that solar Philippines estimates will cost approximately million dollars of nonland capital expenditure All in all would amount to how much was paying for it About billion pesos or more than billion dollars per year The cost baseline as projected by the company is about pesos per kilowatt hour Which is far less than the current household price of electricity as reported by globalpetralpricescom At pesos per kilowatt hour The entity established to undertake the project is known as Tera Solar Philippines A partnership between solar Philippines and Prime Infrastructure Capital A company held by the Filipino billionaire Enrique Cave Razon Who is also famous for his other companies such as International Container Terminal Services One of the worlds largest global port management companies and Gloomberry Resort Corporation The owner of big entertainment buildings Come over here Both the Philippines and South Korea These two companies have then established Tera Solar Philippines With a ownership stake going to Solar Philippines and a stake to Prime Infrastructures The Hector Projects nonland capital expenditure Is estimated to be billion and is slated to generate around billion pesos Or more than half a billion dollars in annual sales every year The projects timeline is slated for commercial operation by And immediate start considering that it is just a few years away Thats very soon Details of this project however are still unfound Tera Solar is expecting between to gigawatts of power And to gigawatts of batteries Therefore as the company enters into the stage of development The output could vary between the projections And a possible change from the initial projections The only question that we would arguably raise Is the exceedingly initial cost of the project While we can justify whether this is the right or even the best option for the Philippines', 'Around a Filipino renewable energy company that goes by the name of solar Philippines Immediately went on from being a noname brand to becoming one of the most celebrated Filipino companies ever This is because the company had reported that it secured over a hectare land bank area an area it acquired is situated around Noiva Esiha What makes this so important however is not because they simply acquired a massive amount of land It is because the company reported that this hectare land bank will be used to build gigawatts of solar power and a further gigawatts of hours of battery storage a Feet that most people would probably never understand what even is a gigawatts Yeah right Its very mega project that sits in the Philippines when finished will become the worlds largest solar park ever Yes well the country located in the eastern parts of Asia a country that is still in a Developing phase is aiming to build the worlds largest solar park this And thats the same that should come as a shock to most people In the worlds largest solar park its not being built in the most developed country but rather in the Philippines It will surpass the current largest solar park which is located in India and is known as the Badla solar park Which occupies an area of about hectares but only has a current capacity of just around Gigawatts yet India is a much bigger area and population whereas compared to the Philippines would only be a tiny portion of it But here comes the archipelago country on its path to building a solar park farm that had far more capacity than Badla Solar Park and a capacity that would overshadow any other solar farms around the world For a further comparison the largest solar park in the United States is known as the Copper Mountain Solar Facility Which only has Gigawatts of power or megawatts or even one of Chinas largest solar parks ever Known as the gird desert solar park which has a capacity of

hiding We were told that there was basically a man in government who was an antiSemite And who was very antagonistic towards the Jews Okay quick break So just a quick throwback to my childhood I knew this was going to happen So one day my mom told us that we have to leave the house and she basically just packed pictures of my childhood all necessary documents And she told me that we have to leave And we had to separate from my dad And I had no idea what was going on So being a child when this all happens is really tough I had no idea what was happening We take the train home and very often there were kids waiting for us older kids as we came out of the train station And they started running after us eight kids and throwing stones at us and calling us dirty Jews So I became a very fast runner In a group of Nazis came to the door with a German shepherd and wanted to see about the Jewish books And my dad had quite a library The dog frightened me Territ was a big police dog And they took the books There were a fair number amount of Jews living in that apartment And how they took all these books to the backyard of the apartment building And there was a whole pile that was built and basically burned all those books Intense Quick break So for us it wasnt books For us it was our house So the house where I grew up was burnt down and there was no way back So my mom and I made our way to the how does it train station And I think this part will also be in this video So Im going to save it for that part But yeah its tough when memories get burnt They took my German citizenship away from my mother my father and myself So now we were stateless My dad was arrested and was arrested in the Breslau Town Hall My mother told me that told my brother and I that my dad was away on a trip on a business trip But really never divulged that he had been arrested And but cried bitterly We couldnt understand why she was crying My father was told by the Nazis that he had to sell get rid of all his houses He could only take marks out With the implementation of the Nuremberg laws and depriving all German Jews of their German citizenship this that enabled then the government to confiscate businesses to confiscate homes to appropriate all their assets It was not a physical extermination but it was a social annihilation because it annihilated their place in the social fabric of German society and treated them as nongratis as foreign enemies living amongst society Okay so I think we learned about this since its cool In Austria you actually learn about the worldwide and all the Nazi history which is really important And the part where she said that that got taken away or arrested I had the same experience My dad was actually hiding from the so just the background story Im from Bosnia and we had civil war which it was the former Yugoslavia and then the Serbs started attacking Bosnia and yeah And yeah my dad was hiding actually from the Serbs so he can survive We had to separate because we couldnt go as a family together and then he got captured in one of the socalled concentration camps And he never talked about that Never And it was really something that I wasnt aware of So yeah Thats better a similar story of who mom My fathers family left Germany in so it was late and in fact my fathers uncle Walter with him he was very close was actually taken by the Nazis

four years she was still so happy monsery yeah its true though we celebrate monsery but the third of november yeah its our i would say the day we really met because thats when we actually have a good conversation yeah we talked until morning thats right yeah we really started eating it off once we really started chatting uh whats that next question', 'All right however having said that lets break up a bit about what you were saying because you were saying that your classmates you know were like but shocked Because you could have gone for a younger a little bit okay And of course you know I was more concerned about your family because I had to win a family over because even a family were against it in a sense Not her parents I mean I think when I arrived there Im not too sure how much her parents actually really realized how serious this was because Im let her father was just having me on because when I said can I marry your daughter You said what Why Why would you want You know why Since she too young you know like he was a bit look to me like he was called down I thought he knew I thought he was expecting this because this had been spoken about in planned But just from his reaction he wasnt it looked anyway Unless he was just playing along I dont know So but on the whole the parents because you must remember in the Philippines a person whos under I think the age of has to be signed away by the parents in order to marry somebody So its not like the West way at you can go into a court and get married You dont need the permission of your parents In the Philippines you do I think up to the age of So I needed their backing They were good at doing that But obviously they also have to ask the other part of the family And this is maybe for another block were going to discuss When youre talking about winning over a Filipino youre going to win over and her family And thats quite intense so tell me explain to me your family Were they all happy when I pitched up there and wanted to marry you First of all you talk to my parents They were not happy They feel insecure at this level Because Im married Im going to marry the old man Wow But later on they accept Jonathan to be my husband And also after marriage we get happiness forever So my parents they dont worry about that because Im married that Good man And you really care for me OK', 'There guys we have a pretty background and a peaceful environment to give you a little story time because we get so many questions a lot of you are of course curious about our story our relationship And we talked about it a little bit here and there but we never gave you like the full story So of course the main thing that so many of you guys are asking is how we met in the first place We met online and then at first we were in a long distance relationship for over Yeah for like how long One Yeah around a year A year or like when the naha pier something like that Yeah During those times I was still going to university and even though we were already in a relationship of course I wanted to finish school first so that was a little bit of a setback We were younger Yeah we were so young So we were just video calling like a lot like what at the time Yeah everyday Yes everyday First we were like thinking how to have our first meeting Of course we were discussing if Jonathan would visit me in Hungary or I would visit him in the Philippines But it was very hard to get a visa to Hungary I started fixing my papers but they are asking things that like proof that we know each other like pick to that we dont have so Like basically for a couple who never met in person before its impossible If you are from Philippines or other nearby countries you wont get a shengen visa saying that youre visiting someone that you never met there just not going to give it to you Especially if youre travelling alone They will be suspicious why are you going there Its not for tourists Yeah We soon found out that Jonathan visiting me in Hungary is not an option That time we started saving money so we could meet up Yes Then after we just decided its easier for you because you dont even need a visa to go to Yeah for me it was very easy to come to the Philippines and also I really wanted to go abroad Basically I just really wanted to experience life abroad so I was actually very excited to go to the Philippines Right after I finished university I was already so fly to the Philippines And that time unfortunately taking videos was not really a thing so we dont have a video of our first meeting but we have pictures Yeah thats all Yeah we have a picture in Manila and we were so young and cute Not anymore We are still young and cute So yeah that was our first meeting and then basically when I came here we already started our life together because because prior to this we were already in a relationship for one and a half years like I said and it was like just so normal Even though it was our first time meeting we already knew each other so much We already know each other well before we met Yes some people are like not a believer in long distance relationship but thats not our experience We made it for repined ways like video Repined ways commercial I hope that I can also serve you like as a positive encouragement because I know so many others are in like long distance relationship and figuring out a way how to meet and its definitely possible because its worth pretty well for us So if you are in a long distance relationship then just commit to it and maybe save up money by a ticket and just do it Just do it Just do it night Bye guys Please be the one nighting sponsor Repined ways and just do it Just do it Smart tips from Susie and Jonathan youre welcome']"

and eight rays Each of them standing for one province of the country The yellow stars stand for the three largest island groups Luzon Visayas and Mindinau What makes the flag really unique is that it can be reversed to declare a state of war This happened during the Filipino Revolutionary War of to and during World War II in to Seven Boxing directly affects crime rates in the country Filipinos love boxing and are crazy about their most famous box of manipacking Whenever hes in that country his glued to its TV sets According to the Philippine National Police PNP crime rates in the country dropped significantly when hes in the ring During his round fight against American boxer Floyd Mayweather Jewel from the s Not a single crime was committed in the home and nila metropolitan area It was basically the same during other major fights with the participation of Like I thought they were going to fight in the street because Yeah after you watch Tokyo Reveyor just you want to fight that kind of like What you would do But he was good thing So I was relieved It was basically the same during other major fights with the participation of the peoples champ ManiPakia ManiPakia', 'Number three the position of the Philippine flag conveys a message of peace or war Elements of the Philippine flag symbolize traits and qualities Filipinos possess or strive to achieve Combine this with a proper way the flag is American way As to what the state of the country is Canging horizontally if the blue stripe is on top the country is in state of peace if the red stripe is on top However the country is in a state of war Really Stripe is on the left side of the observers point of view than the nation is at peace But if the red stripe is on the left side then the bullpen is never more I would neither Religious festivals very serious isnt that the same concept as if we its like distress like if the US flag is upside down It means that were in distress or something I dont know thats the first Ive heard of Philippine flag yeah I mean its not disrespectful oddly enough It means that I believe it means that like we are either at war or were in distress Yeah or theres theres something going on Its bad Yeah but its not like a its not like a anti American thing so like right However you dont work change the color locations like Like that like Id be like some looks off about that Well technically theyre not change Its just really theyre just flipping upside down Thats what Im saying Well yeah yeah right and out my stupid brain would be like Thats backwards some is different Even if its our flag Id be like pretty sure the stars go on the other side Yeah so Previously having been under Spanish rule for over years the Philippines is predominantly Christian Majority of which is Roman Catholic and were traditionally taught to honor God and other holy figures during glitches festivals Some of these festivals however tend to be a bit extreme depending on ones willing this to show his or her devotion Such as the feast of a black Nazarene during January and the passion play or reenactment of Jesus crucifixion during holy week Number five so we actually had this discussion a minute ago We had a comment because I was telling it and one of our last videos I had said that I never truly learned about Islam and all those in a lot of other religions um and some of the comments were like how do you not learn about these in school And it was a fill and I mean I dont know how Close Yalls laws are to ours like we dont teach religion in our public schools and Made in reason yeah the main reason is because we have Cultures and religions from all over the world and the United States hasnt believed in Now I will admit that they are actually like you know the the Constitution was designed behind Kind of behind religion Yeah it was but I mean the way The United States public school system looks at it as is if we teach Christianity since its technically with the most of fun yet If we if we teach that in schools then were leaving out all of the Other religions and thats not fair and and its not right because and So now were leaving out Muslim that we teach Islam then were leaving out Buddhist and and Hindi and all these other religions and theres actually like over religions practiced in the US so we dont Were not allowed to teach it I mean you can go to a private Christian High school middle school and all those kind of things and theyre theyre allowed to because theyre not taking money from the federal government right now Things like in our pledge therefore a while I dont think its there anymore It was under God You know but that was added during the Cold War for whatever reason before that it wasnt under God right But yes our constitution was written by people that believed that that you know they were religious I believe they were Christians however they also had slaves and all these other things so Now I think were trying to become more aware of our situation but generally speaking religion is kept out of any public schools For the main reason of keeping up with these religions Even public universities unless youre taking a specific class to learn about Because you do have religious universities like bail or university or Texas Christian University or TCU Southern Methodist University but if you go to like university of Texas its kind of not the same right so Just a little information', 'Hey everybody welcome back to fun with flags today Were gonna be taking a look at the flag of the Philippines now the Philippines have been populated for a long time But as we know flags are something quite recent in the large picture of history in ancient times native population inhabited the Philippines but they didnt have any flag It looks like for them We can find who flag would be the symbols through which they represented themselves or through which they were depicted by historians Like this ancient painting just changed the nose I will see you which seems to contain some symbols dating back to around found in Bhutuan But all of this changed in when Portuguese explorer Magellan arrived in the Philippines and claimed the islands for Spain So technically the first official flag of the Philippines would in fact be the Spanish colonial flag Which evolved a little throughout time I have a video on the Spanish flag on my channel So if youre interested So that was the original uh That was the original symbol Yeah But theyre basically saying the original flag would have been technically the Spanish flag right yeah Check that out during Spanish occupation There was also a British flag flying over the Philippines the flag of the East India trading company Which flew during the Brief British occupation of Manila from to However despite Spanish colonialism there were still a few natives in control of some regions At least for some periods of time and there were also attempts of revolt So there are a few examples of native flags in this time like the red penance used by the kingdom of Tondo The plain yellow flag of the Sultanate of Magin danau the flag of the Silang revolt the Sulu Sultanate the Basi revolt and some provincial insides Their second official flag was also a foreign one after being ruled by the Spanish the islands were seated by Spain To the United States of America because of their defeat in the SpanishAmerican war which ended in In return the US paid a sum of million dollars to Spain During this time there was an attempt by locals to create a free Philippine Republic and this movement counted with a support of many Its crazy how little that is yeah I mean it was in the s So Im sure its a lot more back then oh it But for an entire country to pay that its like I mean I think the same thing happened for buying like The what did they call it the this When they bought out parts of the United States they paid like next to nothing in the grand scheme of thing He said million yeah yeah I mean in the s I would imagine thats probably like a billion dollars I would think more I have no idea Im just guessing I dont know Im not a good person I guess it does actually Its a lot yeah but for a country its probably not and the US wasnt like What it is today Yeah it wasnt super rich you know I mean just from the start to here theyve been through quite a few flags Yeah yeah and saying about yeah groups and factions inside of Philippines Which had their own flags the majority of which were read with some white symbols in the center like the flag of the Magdalor Katipunan faction the flag of the Tagalog Republic the Sultanate of Sulu which was still around and occupied Only a bit of territory in the Philippines Zamboanga Republic or thats for the Republic of the Yaknavatu This last one was the first official flag of the Philippine Republic and was used during the Philippine Revolution But there was also the main independence flag if you will the flag of the first Philippine Republic Which resembles todays flag it was flown the first time in a skirmish against Spanish troops The Filipino forces were led by General Aguinaldo who had been in exile in Hong Kong and had brought this Revolutionary flag with him to represent the independence movement It contains a mythical son with a face similar to the son of May in other former Spanish colonies The triangle of Freemasonry and the eight ways representing the eight rebellious provinces against the Spanish The three stars represent the three main islands The flag carries the text in Spanish saying expeditionary forces of northern Luzon and on the back It says freedom justice and equality but the problem here was that the US werent very happy with the idea of a free Philippines so when they received the islands from the Spanish they imposed direct administration All the way until using their own national flag to represent the islands Finally in the Philippines got their own official flag using the previous design by the general Emilio Aguinaldo But with a few changes the tones of the red and blue were to match the ones on the American flag And the suns face was removed and the Spanish text was also not present However these specifications werent made official So a lot of variants of the flag flew all over the Philippines In these specifications were finally codified the shade of the colors the fact that the white triangle Should be equilateral and at the rays of the sun should be somewhat simplified So if Im not mistaken this is the same flag we have right now right for the Philippines So its it stayed the same for quite some time right And this was the flag in use until the s but then came World War II During the war the Philippines were put right in the center of the Pacific theater of war Being a puppet or an ally if you will of the west they were put in their wrecked conflict with the Japanese And targeted by the empire in their expansion towards Southeast Asia So from to port of the Philippines flew the Japanese flag due to foreign occupation The government in exile however continued to fly the Philippine national flag In the second Philippine Republic was inaugurated using that same flag After the war the US granted the Philippines their independence And throughout the rest of the th century the country altered the flag a little Mostly in the colors department eventually reverting back to the original colors of Aguinaldos design previous to American administration So in the current flag was made official and permanent as the flag of the Republic of the Philippines As for the meaning of the flag According to the proclamation of independence the white triangle Signifies the emblem of the Katipunan the secret society that opposed Spanish rule of the punas Commemorate the flag of the United States as a manifestation of gratitude for American aid against the Spanish during the Philippine revolution The three stars represent the three main islands Luzon Mindanao and Panay also Vizias and the Sun represents the gigantic steps made by the Suns of the country Along the path of progress and civilization Thats cool While the eight rains represent the eight provinces which originally rebelled against Spanish rule But the Sun is also likely to be the remain of the Sun of May which was somewhat influenced by Spanish rule or by ancient native populations The origin of these symbols is also quite interesting although obviously up for the bay There is an official explanation on the Philippines government website which states it was like this Having some influence from southern America flags from the US flag Masonry and even some local port flags in the Philippines Theres also a theory for which I could find no real confirmation that the flags design was originally inspired by that of the Cuban flag Thats cool that they have like this huge breakdown of the flag on their government website Yeah yeah']"

like and love about him is hes very again sincere loyal gentleman and honest and he means his words and of course guapo oh and yeah um i think from all the you know what woman wants is he have it and i always feel lucky every day and yeah im gonna blush are you are you but thats true though because every every woman dreams about a humble man a gentleman a responsible man anything and you are percent yeah thats why she feels that way i know i have qualities that are lacking thats what i said thats what i said there is no such perfect ingredients when it comes to a person and when it comes to a relationship so the other part where its not included in the ingredients is you have to what you call that in english you have to compromise yeah sure thats what makes the relationship work yeah you have to accept the good qualities and the negative qualities that the person carries at the end of the day i feel like the good qualities is what initially attracts us to the person and i think that the good qualities overshadow the bad negative qualities and we have really good like good connection when it comes to talking about anything and thats very important in a relationship connection the chemistry the chemistry yeah']"

proud hey my gay little heart to know and see how prideful the community of lilon is for the lgbt community there are a lot of allies here a lot of people in the community just parading down the street and you can just tell that the locals are very supportive as they stand on the side of the road just cheering on and watching us go as we sweat our way like its hot we got our workout in this morning and it was awesome guys it was again it might not be the biggest of the greatest to other people but it matters and it was fun and its beautiful and again at the end of the day it doesnt matter if theres two people three people or five thousand people like having recognition and support of who you are and just seeing somebody else like you or an ally its important and if it is and i wouldnt change a thing about it makes us happy it truly truly makes us happy to see how how a community this small compared to a bigger city still shows the love and support for our community and power to everyone who put the time and energy into their floats like their clothes are awesome and theyre resourceful and they still look good as heck like it just proves like you should be creative and anythings possible so we made it to the sports complex where theyre going to open up with the ceremony and theyre going to do the judging for the floats and lets just tell you let me tell you i have my favorite i have two favorites three favorites were gonna see if we can like make our way to the judging panel or something oh my hands shaking were not but its fun lets see whats about guys', 'Im straight but I I love gay people its the same story as like Im not racist I have you know you know POC friends like okay hi Im drama and Im gay hi Im Elena and Im a lesbian and we are reacting through how Filipinos feel about lgbtq plus folk the Philippines actually has a deep lgbtq history the types of people in Mindanao believe in people who exist in between male and female genders trans women not only existed but held high positions of spiritual power because this was threatening to the Spaniards machismo beliefs bakla arose as a term that claimed switching between genders was temporary and not normal the word bakla is such a its such a bad word and its not it shouldnt be you know especially after hearing about this yes and like honestly I am I sound so evil because like growing up in the Philippines every time like I would just be this like flamboyant guy and every time I would just like interact with the young kids in the Philippines they would just be like they did not get to know me like beyond that and that is the story of why I think all children are horrible so youre generalized which I shouldnt do but yeah its horrible that these kids grow up and one of the first few things that they learn is to like make fun of yeah queer people had I had been presented with this information if I was in like high school or maybe even Elementary School who knows like life would have been so much easier like to know that these people held leadership positions yeah precolonial Philippines like that blows my mind', 'all right guys that concludes our first pride in the philippines it took us by surprise to say the least i mean we have very we didnt have the highest expectations while we were here knowing that its a small town but they showed out and just to see it in a smaller scale really shows like the improvement thats happening within communities for supporting the lgbt community and that just makes me happy i think the best takeaway from it all is that weve been to pride events before in chicago and they are mass evil like they do everything but you dont i think with the lilo on the smaller festival is that you get to actually see what its all about i dont know if that makes sense but my point is you got to see the actual community members that are involved face to face you got to learn about why theyre doing it how its of the community the people that are actually fighting for these programs in the community it was just a more intimate thing and we had the best time we had the best time i felt very like a proud parent the entire time even though i had nothing to do with it whatsoever but and were going to take that parent very literal because there was a dance later in the evening and by we left the magella like we were so tired im like were dads here everybody else is so young and like we just look like dads yeah yeah were not cool and a really quick shout out to carmen who is the president of the prop yes roses means rose right yes okay yes thank you so much for inviting us to your community to come see what the youth put together to show their pride for the for the proc it was so resourceful and we love what youre doing and we hope every other community can like follow you soon and bring that to their communities as well at the end of the day we couldnt be any more proud for the filipino community here in lilola for their support in our community and im encouraging everyone out there to show their support not just the month of june but yearround because hey were gay yearround not just in the month of june it shut off jose would not even exist after or before june no im kidding but like thank you and to anyone thats out there that sees us whether youre gay straight whatever ally thank you if you

there that will like be your friend that has a love for you be you at the end of the day and if people dont accept you thats fine because theres so many people that will do it and this little

from the reviewers And of course to hope that the world will be a part of the worlds most important background to elicit sympathy from the reviewers And of course to hope that long enough to continue watching Two using strong feelings like sadness in things like music pictures and stories is common They do this to make people feel very emotional Number three invasion of privacy Some creators dont pay attention to the privacy and dignity of the people they show in poverty They might invade personal moments or use vulnerable situations for their own benefit I dont blame them entirely for making poverty porn Because again theyre just doing what helps their business Theyre essentially a businessman If it brings in viewers thats what they aim for As for the Filipino audience I dont blame them much either since they might not know any better But if you keep watching after learning how poverty porn affects poor Filipinos then you are part of the problem If you defend poverty porn youre also playing a role in exploiting your fellow Filipinos And its not just about exploitation youre also contributing to the gradual decline of the country Why Because poverty porn does not address the root cause of poverty in the Philippines And the stereotypes about the Philippines will continue And for foreigners who aspire to create poverty porn content we hope this video helps to understand why poverty porn is harmful And hopefully they vary from creating poverty porn content', 'With online dating theres not as many girls online in CDO as there are in the bigger cities such as Sabu or Manila which is understandable Wherever you set your location youre still going to get your fair share of scammers prostitutes ladyboys and timewasters On arriving in CDO Id immediately connected with Sol on Pina Love She was said she was looking for a serious relationship She was kilograms and quite chubby not the sort of girl I would normally go for But she had an incredible rack which I was drawn towards She sent me her WhatsApp number and I texted her on my first night She asked what hotel I was staying in and what room was I in which I thought was pretty straightforward for a girl looking for a serious relationship in CDO Sold of Din Uptown CDO which is five kilometers away She sent some photographs of herself and her sister outside a condo there where she suggested I checked into Said she didnt have the fair to come into the city So I said Id meet her in Uptown CDO the following day After eating that night I returned to my hotel room Sol messaged then video called me She had braces on her teeth and didnt look great but she lowered her phone to show her prized possessions She was drinking outside her home with her friends and after the call ended asked if she could bring them along tomorrow which I wasnt too keen on so I didnt respond The following morning at am Sol sent a good morning We exchanged texts for the next couple of hours and then she texted saying honey can I borrow some money later Ill buy it rice and some school payment if its okay with you This relationship was only going one way Unfortunately Sols incredible rack was never unveiled as I blocked her In CDO I also connected on Pina Love with Angel Sophie She had included her WhatsApp number in her profile so I messaged her Later that afternoon she responded saying she wanted to see me on video call She looked a lot more full of face than in her photos Girls are quite good at hiding the truth in photos I ended the call saying I needed to get out of the sunshine and walked into the Limket Cay Mall nearby Angel wanted to see more photos of me and tell her my real age I told her Id already sent her four photos so she sent me six more of her She was had never had a foreigner boyfriend She asked to meet me I told her I was heading to Devowsoon Can I come with you She said Jesus we hadnt even met yet She spent the next half hour trying to get my attention Maybe you can call me again so we can talk about you and me She said I didnt respond Not job', 'Now its worth responding to apologists of poverty porn content They make some claims and so Im going to challenge them They usually make the following claims to justify why poverty porn is a good thing One they say that poverty porn content creators help the poor Now if you think about it this is an absurd statement Because if their goal was genuinely to assist the poor they would do so privately without exploiting someone elses suffering or be used in pain Assistance or health involves doing positive things or others without expecting anything in return without expecting any personal gain But this doesnt apply to the socalled charity vloggers The term help is often misused by defenders of poverty porn content who attempt to justify its merits meaning they want to defend poverty porn at all costs Why Because it makes them feel better So they come up with excuses They use positive words like health charity assistance and so on Their motivation is not generally for the benefit of an individual penis but rather for their own satisfaction Because again watching poverty porn content makes them feel better as much as it makes you feel better to use the word help its not appropriate The word exploit is more appropriate Did you know that real charity groups highly share their charitable acts They never publish the act of them helping poor people because they genuinely want to help the less fortunate and truly understand their struggles Number two YouTubers need to make money Another claim that poverty porn apologists make is that YouTubers need to make money to give money Think about how absurd this argument is They admit that YouTubers share poverty porn to make money indicating that their main aim is profit And then they back those who exploit poor Filipinos because they find it challenging to admit that poverty porn is damaging Its like saying its okay for drug dealers to sell drugs just because they need to make money While we all need to make money to survive in this system is it necessary to exploit other human beings for our own benefit Number three charity organizations do it too Charity organizations as the name suggests depend on donations from big companies to do quote unquote good things Right from the beginning their main goal is to help poor people I like many YouTubers who make poverty videos charity organizations like Mr Beast and Raffi Tolpo dont go out actively seeking poor people just to film and get views Their goal is to collect donations to assist more people and every penny goes to charitable clauses Their plan for their business was clear on the start This is very different from most YouTubers who make poverty porn videos Their first plan wasnt to do good things but to make money They only started helping poor people when they realized that making poverty porn videos was successful Number four its a winwin situation They argue that both the ones exploiting and those being exploited gain something from poverty porn For the exploiters its a victory because their videos keep making money for many years to come As for the impartish Filipinos who are exploited they receive a thousand pesos but in the process they lose their dignity And again because Filipinos internalize their emotions they dont express them It would be difficult for you to understand or to know if your actions hurt them Aside from losing their dignity they are more likely to face social exclusion especially if their family members in the province are unaware of their situation When apologists make the claim that its a winwin situation its like saying that the American and Spanish takeover of the Philippines was good because even though the Philippines was mistreated Filipinos became more like Americans took Spanish names and became Christians This way of thinking ignores the four centuries of suffering in the Philippines Similarly if you keep defending poverty porn the more you overlook the issue of poverty in the Philippines the more you ignore it']"

but we really want to save some face here We dont want it to look like we lost to the Filipino revolutionaries And Im not kidding The Spanish commander literally said that he would quote be willing to surrender to white people but not to the Filipinos So the US commanders like okay theres no opportunity to do that We said we were such a demeaning thing to say and Im not even surprised because of what I saw and detail in Ovela I know its still just a telenovela but its based on stories of a Filipino hero So Im thinking that some of what he depicted in his books is actually inspired by probably true events and things that happened in the Philippines So yeah In that TV show Maria Clara Ibarra you can see how the Spaniards think about Filipinos Like theres nothing Were deliberate the Filipinos but we havent promised anything yet So we would much rather it looked like the US defeated Spain instead of helped the Filipinos defeat Spain Much better for our brand said the United States So together the United States and Spanish militaries organized a fake battle a fake battle in which the US would fight the Spanish in Manila and the Spanish would intentionally lose And the climax of this whole theatrical battle according to the plan was that at the end the US would storm towards the inner walled city of Manila The last drop of the Spanish are No no no no Dont tell me that the credit of booting Spain from the Philippine like the entire credit goes to the US instead Please tell me thats not the case Oh plan They were not with the Filipino fighters The ones that had been doing all the actual fighting against the Spanish joined them as they stormed towards the walled city to deal the final blows to the Spanish Empire And this would mean that the Filipinos technically didnt gain their independence Thats the US who conquered the Spanish Empire Thats ridiculous And then the Filipinos Oh can you give us million for our troubles and the US was like yes sure', 'Anyway and now because of Teddy Roosevelt who we literally named the teddy bear after Side note were at war not in the Caribbean only but also in the Pacific The US arrives to the Philippines and sees that

go down and save all those starving people in Venezuela We got to overthrow that government It doesnt end its the same thing over and over Spanish see the US arrived to the Philippines and theyre like great Were done So the Spanish military commanders ask to meet with the US military commanders They meet in secret and spains like listen I know were losing But we really want to save some face here

the actual fighting against the Spanish Join them as they stormed towards the walled city to deal the final blows The Spanish Empire and this would mean that the Filipinos technically didnt gain their independence It was actually the US who conquered the Spanish and then the Spanish are like oh can you give us million dollars for our troubles And the US was like yes sure So now the US wins the war and they', 'But soon its not just Cuba The US really meaning Teddy Roosevelt who again is just an assistant secretary of the Navy Hes like not a big decision maker He somehow maneuvers the situation to say like lets liberate next door Puerto Rico And while were at it lets go into the Pacific and liberate Guam and the Philippines from Spain as well Teddy didnt even ask his boss to do this He literally sent off a cable to the Navy commander in Asia that was like George Dewey go attack the Philippines where Spain is That is what your mandate is And George Deweys like okay Im being told to go to war with Spain and the Philippines Teddy was sort of of the mind like better to ask forgiveness than permission I mean I get that but come on not pull it off Anyway and now because of Teddy Roosevelt who we literally named the Teddy bear after as I note were at war not in the Caribbean only but also in the Pacific The US arrives to the Philippines and sees that the locals had already been fighting against the Spanish for like years The Spanish were weak and were totally declining Oh they launched original language at the time already So its like the top of the ninth inning or like the fourth quarter of the Spanish in the Philippines And the US shows up and its like let us liberate you And the Philippines were like well weve sort of already been fighting this bloody war for years against the Spanish So yeah I guess United States if you want to come help us deal the final blow to Spain like sweet So George I say yeah this is kind of what I was learned about Philippines history when I was in high school students when I was in high school What I was learned was you know like the US invaded into the Philippines for the liberty liberty for them At the time Spain called nice Philippines as a D US trying to release Philippines Philippines you know this is from the you know Spains colonization That was the main purpose But there is a behind purpose obviously So is this video going to tell us about that Lets see Do we this Navy commander and his fleet show up to Manila Meanwhile back in the US people are like wait werent we just supposed to invade Cuba What are we doing in the Philippines now And the US governments like because the Philippines is a perfect hub for commercial opportunities in Asia And we think that if we dont take it Japan or Germany might take

religion and then theres one more thats bigger than I forgot which one it was is there another Yeah there was like two before Muslim so I dont understand I As a country that kind of runs off of the same concept as the United States I dont think anything on the flag should be religious driven Yeah you know I mean Im sure Something on our flag is religious driven But no I mean if you ask anybody they dont know right because I couldnt I mean I can tell you with the stars Stanfords the individual states I can tell you with the bar Stanford stands for the first colonies But as far as like the color representation Im not sure right I think the red is supposed to represent like bravery and the white purity I cant remember what blue stands for but There could be some religion behind Some of the design or the coloration Thats not something that I know about yeah I will say the Muslim inspired flag that was the third flag down that had the crescent instead of the triangle right looked really cool Right but I think that would be pretty hard to execute seeing as though the the end of the flag is a circle That would that would look kind of odd flying but That that was a lot of information There was quite a few flags that have made their way through the country um And theres still a few flags being represented now like the presidents flag the navy flag things like that right yeah So I thought it was really cool If yall have another video that you want us to watch regarding the flag or anything about You know Things like this like that represent the country not necessarily

our members program and with that being said my name is miles And my name is fed thanks for watching guys peace out', 'When I was in high school the one class that I learned the most from wasnt math it wasnt science it wasnt English It was kind of a elective class that I took because I heard they dont have any homework called Peer group counseling Its a really different class Basically It was led by the high school English teacher who just went by the name Phyllis I dont even know what her last name was Every other teacher was Mr or Mrs soandso But with her it was just Phyllis And she was just a really amazing teacher One of the few teachers in my whole life that I look back on and Im just so grateful that came into my life So this class that I went to so I didnt have to take homework is the class that I learned the most from out of probably years at school and college too frankly In this class called Peer group counseling was basically just set up Students would come in and they would sit in this big circle and we would look at each other and there was a few rules in this class like whatever was said in the classroom had to stay in the classroom People had to listen to others before they would speak And people had to really show empathy is what it was But it didnt start off that way When the class started I walked in there and like kind of a typical teenager I looked around the room to see who was in class with me And I saw an exgirlfriend I saw a couple of close friends I saw some people that I didnt like at all I didnt necessarily know them but I knew that I didnt like them In so much of life but probably especially during school I think our impressions of people are who they are from a distance We dont really take the time to get to know people especially I think when were younger So in this class I had all of these impressions of people from the very beginning Some good some bad some indifferent And as that class went on it really started to change my perception of those in the class The way the class was structured is that there would be a particular topic for the day and Phyllis would raise the topic It might be something about homelife It might be something about school It might be about I cant even remember to be honest now But however the class would start off the teacher would basically raise the topic and then whoever wanted to speak could speak Whoever didnt want to speak didnt have to speak And during that time at first everybody started off very reserved and shy and not wanting to share But as the weeks went on as the months went on during the semester everybody got to know each other more closely than almost anyone that I got to know going through school Hold on foods arriving Awesome thank you sir Water', 'I got here in February nd to be precise And at first it was just Another chilled treat right We just hear in the Philippines Im going to stay here for a while And then I decided to go to school And while in school The first major problem I had Here was actually Algebra Thinking about it I had this math teacher that only speaks hilly guy no Yeah We literally I had no idea what he was saying in class But I needed to pass that subject Yeah There was this day he gave us a A homework I didnt know he gave us a homework So Im like I got there I got to school the next day And they were like oh we have this assignment I was like when Like the teacher said it When how I didnt understand when he said it Because I dont understand hilly guy no I would see her like only four months So anyway to make up for it the teacher decided to give us a pop quiz I didnt know we were going to get a pop quiz I didnt know what he was saying I just saw students tearing our shit up paper Reading activity buddy Yeah I was like okay yeah let me join them It was questions I got zero of a Wow amazing That was a great score And then I said to myself I was like I cant feel I never feel And the funny thing is it is that in all of the exams Ive ever written Ive never felt So why should I start failing Yeah This is not how I plan to stop my first year right So every other subject Im in the line of nine right Why am I struggling with So the fourth of the three is that you low grade the end of the Philippines And you know its a high school in Nigeria but here it is Yeah in Nigeria is an eight And do you know what it takes to get in Nigeria Your brain has to be like warning Notice what you get at in Nigeria is what somebody whos getting a magnum come out of there here Okay So a whole different bracket Anyway so I survived that subject because I had to start teaching myself I started Im not good with math Ive never been really good with math Im good with other subjects If its something I can visualize I can do it I dont know how to visualize math People go to X plus this Why would two X plus Y Doesnt make sense Anyway I had to start forcing myself to learn algebra And I passed I got a I was like ooh thats great You dont know how much relief that is for me that I survived that class But the next semester I had a triangle I had a triangle Now this lady the new teacher speaks English Then I realized Im not stupid I actually knew math I just didnt have somebody to speak a language I understood And I got a good grade for a triangle I got a So I could do it the whole time But the teacher that was a language problem Theres still a language problem right now But its not as bad as before Now if you speak English I pick the words I know what youre saying I just cant see back It took a while to break that barrier that problem']"

it cost us a thousand pounds just for this company to do it but knowing what I know now I could actually quite do it simple in myself but if you let the experts do it they are updating all the time on different legislations and changes in the rules so in many ways its advisable to use those because them guys will not submit an application form unless it is correct because your visa will cost you just your visa alone over a thousand pounds now if your application is wrong and its submitted you still to pay your money and if its rejected you lose your money so these company visa specialists they dont allow any submissions until everything is correct in place basically so its worth spending the extra money with them guys and theyll guarantee it will be okay for you so thats what we did and obviously we have to supply all the information they just give us a list of what they want we give them all that they fill out the form they put it in the right places because the form must be pages long it is massive that was all done you do have to pay a NHS fee which I think saving my memory is correct was about pounds which anyone asked to pay coming into the UK theyve got to contribute that to the NHS so you are not using government funds basically which is fair it is right which I completely agree with', 'Its nice AC Ill tell you that much Um because here in the Philippines at the

boyfriend was Swedish And so we met on Tinder And the most romantic way The most romantic way right So he was in Sweden at the time I was in the Philippines and we matched And you know as young dumb people would like would be when back then when he was like after months we were talking he was like oh Ill come visit you And at the time I was like oh thats so sweet thanks So he came we lived together for two or three months I just wanted to I forgot it now But that was back in Iliilo So it was a very toxic relationship on both sides I was just a quick child You know what I mean It was very fucking toxic I mean like I think I get on both sides Because I think there was a point where I was like okay I think I made a big mistake Because I didnt even know this person I was like I dont know Thats like me talk that was my age when I was talking about the high school relationship Yeah thats a age where you know that okay this is time to grow the fuck up Because like so we were dating and then I think thats when I realized when he was living with me and I was like okay And I knew deep inside that I made a mistake of allowing people to you know agreeing for him to come here And then I was trying to like you know when like you know girls theyre like over their relationship They do like stupid things so that the guy just breaks up with them because I was too scared to break up with him And then when I was working on it I was like all right lets just fucking break up and he didnt want to And thats when the whole like toxicity like thing like happened to be like being like verbally like mean to each other There wasnt any physical abuse but still mentally emotionally it was like a shit show And then there were so many other things that happened but just like to sort of summarize everything I was a really bad time in my life So it was a very big like difference from dating the Filipino to dating the Swedish guy', 'Thats class people are saying what the fuck why are they harmonizing Other countries dont sing graduation songs What Yeah we dont I dont know In the UK we definitely fucking dont They probably even wear a strange But I guess its just more to do with kids being with rather than anything In America you obviously get sold the whole idea of prom quite big Prom is like you go with your date This is perhaps when you reveal that youve crushed on the girl or the guy or whatever Yes its a big commercial deal Its a big deal yeah But America does everything like that Thats very illustrative Now in the UK its like the watered down version of that And its actually no its kind of like you went to a Year prom which is your last year of high school It was quite good But its kind of weird though I must say because its like you are going to somebodys birthday party Its very Thank you dress up You dress up really nice for but its like a birthday party Its not Theres nothing special You dont have a meal or anything like that Okay so even Venezuela back home You do you do You do Yeah you get that you do But without your parents thats so weird Yeah your parents are not around for this issue Theyre still not allowed to go to the prom party And there is no ceremony And here in the UK theres no ceremony of you graduating Because like your GCSE results you sort of get them in this envelope And you go pick them up in the school and then off you go Thats it Theres no ceremony Theres no you past Thats crazy Yeah what you do what you do you can memorize sports really well So like obviously like you know I had to go to the ceremonies a lot every year Because sportspers and whatever Arts as well its like fairly well recognized Like oh the act of the year Thats very cool And then theres like from King from Queen I get it But no one really gives a damn Hes not a big deal', 'So many of you guys are so like nice and giving us a lot of positive comments and like just super nice There will be of course always a few like negative assumptions and like just haters in general its impossible to avoid that when you are online but most of you guys are so sweet Yeah I like reading the comments Theres a lot of nice comments You can count the negative comments in your fingers Yes So back to the timeline we got a little bit of truck Yeah we went to Hungary after fixing this extremely difficult to get visa and then yeah it was just a lot of fun You could meet my parents Yes And your dogs And my dogs And we also spent time like at my home place just hanging out with my family and then we also travelled a little bit around Hungary but you have a lot more to say We should do that again sometime Yes definitely So how long were you been living here before you went back to Hungary I think like more than four years around the after weve been living here together I went back to Hungary which was just supposed to be temporary because no one knew that lockdowns are going to be a thing So we were like Im just gonna go to Hungary a little bit and then like anytime I can come back But its not a big deal like literally just after two weeks if I feel like that I want to come back already the night were just by a plane ticket and come back but I think it was two years It was another chapter in our relationship in long distance relationship but we already did it before so Thats why you stopped lagging also when you were in Hungary It was not the best part of my life It was just difficult to be separated and yeah that was the time when I realised that I really dont want to live in Hungary We were always like discussing like well stay here forever or maybe well try life in Hungary but me being stuck in Hungary and doing the typical Hungarian life there Thats what made me realise that I definitely do not want to live in Hungary Like just thats just not the type of lifestyle that would suit us and yeah I just wanted to come back to the Philippines desperately also for Jonathan and also for the country So basically this is the timeline of our story and our relationship and when I came back to the Philippines in March this year thats when I started this YouTube channel so after that you can just follow everything that happened in our life including our wedding So yeah this is our story and yeah we really just want to thank you all the support and all the subscribers and just really write nice comments We really really appreciate

some difficulties in the beginning all right looks like the job yet oh here we go the egg is in free balance right now she gives us a thumbs up were ready to go so shes coming into the jungle area dont step on the lava whatever you do very good stance very good stance I dont understand why we put fins on these people Oh first touch oh we have a touch of the plant what does this mean I think that means that she will lose some points yeah but it does not look like a disqualification at this point she still has a very positive stance oh that is incredible I mean just the stamina and condition that these athletes are showing on this event todays phenomenon or the egg looks a little bit shaky but cheese mastering through it and shes approaching the very first obstacle we have the untidy nurse that is in her way Wow oh that was look at the shell of the egg I dont know how she is keeping a straight face in this situation all right okay Wow the egg is safe the egg is safe good balance very good balance then yeah oh she stepped on her own fin that is bad how is she oh she did that very well and he or she comes to the first safe zone you know I wonder what goes through the minds of these athletes and these situations like will she win will she bring the egg over will she receive the bragging rights hmm okay she is approaching the creepy zone shes taking it very slowly she got down on the yoga mat very easily well she looks very stressed Im surprised shes hit shes taking a very low stance at the section more like military technique I agree I think she made it I

actually looking at my documents and many has been training for this egg event for five years now yes she has only dropped four eggs that is astonishing all right I think we all start with the tenders contestant number two McCoy lets see how McCoy does yeah okay we have here McCoy hes shaking it off hes praying hes praying see oh he seems very confident at this point you know putting aside all the stamina and training and professionalism in this event you really have to say that McCoy looks terrible with a cap okay he is in position and hes proceeding to a deep jungle staying away from the lava very good very good the egg looks surprisingly stable hes very very focused here we go yes comes the size its just really tough so theres a slight point deduction on this one look at that perfect form on those fins oh my god I have never seen a performance like this in my life before but he is approaching the very first obstacle I find it interesting his egg holding technique is completely different to an alias hes holding the egg vomit forward oh he passed through the obstacle with no problem not even the slightest shake on the egg which is really surprising I heard that he was doing a lot of stretching and yoga to balance during this quarantine so this technique might helped might help him to win yes looking a little bit sloppy on the getting down but the egg is stable and thats all that concept this point all right as you can see he has a far higher stance than Nelia had at this point but he is not looking too confident I will say he looks at the egg with a hot version that Im afraid that egg might hatch all right wiping the sweat of his face is coming close to the egg this is actually looking quite good the egg has started to slide oh my god he is devastated devastation devasting oh my god Wow lets show us I mean these events just arent games this is serious this is serious serious business we actually have lost two eggs the positive thing is the athletes will get a kick of protein at the end of this event so you know you always have to see the positive side but it looks I like this event was a tie yes I agree', 'before we head to the next discipline well be back right after this short commercial break and without further ado we are going to jump right into our next big event the next discipline here on the quarantine games which is a new addition to the sports world actually Im quite impressed with the techniques that go into the sport the sport is Unicorn floaty bat so the goal of this activity is to throw a floating dart into a floating unicorn there are two runs that are done rapidfire and one around blindfolded lets tune right into our first contestant okay our first contender McCoy is ready to place his first shot I will say he is looking pretty fly for a white guy how happy is it lucky oh is it skillful I dont know so hes retrieving the dart for the second goal looking very conky very very confident at this point okay its taking a very low stance I wonder if this event is too easy now we went through the rapidfire rounds and both throws were a hundred percent hits but now comes the blindfold challenge the challenge that most components in this discipline fail at lets check in hes looking very concentrated placing the iPhone over his face but seeming to fail miserably at it how can we adjusting okay you know the blind falls all right oh yes at this point he seems very happy about it but lets see how Nia does with this one all right Melia is in position shes checking her Spanish aiming nicely lets get a wider shot of this perfect all right so here comes her first fro oh who wouldnt be at this point trouble Ive heard that she is not very good at throwing things so I believe she must be really overly happy about this first attempt here we see the athlete aesthetically retrieving dart from the unicorn getting back into position heres a one fun fact for that unicorns name is Charlie as we found out he has been in the quarantine for quite some time with them were getting a great view off the doddfrank right now will she hit over the Seamus yes point it so now the question is she passed the rapidfire rounds but how will she do in the blindfold challenge she seems very nervous about it shes trying to calm herself down Im reading right here that she received her bandana from mr Miyagi oh wow she likes to wax on and wax off what shes putting on the blindfold the wrong way wrong ah here we go thats better managing still not managing but it looks like she has it a lot of pressure on here a lot of pressure alright Josie shes aiming well she hit or what she knows their realization oh my god she is she cant believe that you cant believe answer that must be really tough all the years of training karate for nothing that is very disappointing and all we see right now is a sad lonely dot outside of the unicorn okay right now I believe we have the opportunity for a quick interview with the winner of this round me choir lets head on over there right now']"

Doors I initially booked it for a couple nights to test out the WiFi and its been good enough for me to work and have video calls online upload YouTube videos So I ended up extending for several weeks here at Red Doors because its a quiet place It is outside of town so youre not going to hear the live music from the downtown area but its still a short motorcycle ride scooter ride five minutes to the main nightlife area but its quiet It has good WiFi it has a pool Its a great place if you want the best of both worlds and you want to be able to sleep I even went to a small island called Seaky Horror and was surprised that the WiFi was much better than I thought it was in certain places All of that being said I know there are tiny islands where the WiFi is not existent There are islands in the Philippines There are going to be places where the WiFi is not great but theyre definitely small towns and even small islands where the WiFi is doable and you can hold video calls and work from there So thats actually in the positives list but just have realistic expectations Youre on islands WiFi is never great on tiny islands Keep that all in mind keep a backup SIM card with data on it In Seaky Horror if you go to Seaky Horror San Juan Hostel had the better WiFi and Hiroya had the better WiFi And on top of that if you have a genius discount on bookingcom for me this entire month

may we speak to the owner And she said well what would that be about We explain well were artists and we have examples of our work And wed like to talk to her about possibly exhibiting in your gallery

could also see the woman that we assumed as she was actually talking to her now and doing this and saying well its like that So were watching this and were watching the face of the woman that we is

dangerous Too flus His legend was saying that he was like a man Hes so young That is so stupid That is so stupid I mean I appreciate the admiration for Efren but come on Efren Batare is He was born and raised in Bampanga Hes the fifth child among nine siblings It was quite a big bag made to keep off loads See this is why I wanted Casual to make a video about Efren because Ive reacted to Efren videos where I just saw his skills Him playing pool and beating people Being real good at his craft But I did not know the story His story Im hoping that Casual will teach us a little bit more about Efrens past What age five His dad brought him along to Manila to have a better income to support them If it was a shy kid growing up and struggled to interact with kids his age so instead of playing outside he worked as a spotter and a janitor at his uncles billiards hog He made it his home as he played billiards all day and slipped on the pool table every night This is when he started gambling at the very young age He was so young that he was too short to reach the pool table so he would stack some coke cases just to make some of his shots What He got the nickname Batta to distinguish him from an older Efren Im sorry but just this information makes me want to watch a biopic movie about Efren Seriously it would be such a great movie in my opinion Also played pool in their home As Efren continued playing he kept rapidly improving until he beat every player in their home So at age his uncle started bringing him along to bigger money matches The movie was very popular at the time so gambling at different pool halls was a thing Efren was beating everybody There was a time when he went to Clark Airbase to literally farm dollars from American soldiers And because of this his name had become a terror in pool halls and he started running out of opponents So his income from gambling started to run dry Oh my god Thats right He went right back into playing billiards In Efren started planning a trip to the US to play against American pool players But an American sports writer apparently have been taking notice of him while he was beating everybody This writer went back to the US and informed their best pool players that a new threat is emerging His name is Efren Reyes Because of this the Americans were able to scout him and found out about his reputation So this ruined Efrens plan to hustle American players for money For those who are confused hustling is kind of similar to smurfing in video games Its like a mythic player playing in the Grandmaster Rank in Mobile Legends to farm easy wins In Efrens case he wanted to farm wins which translate into dollars to support his family In order to counter that obstacle he decided to take on an alias Cesar Morales Why did you say that Morales Billiard Hall after Billiard Hall He left the trail of destruction leaving a opponent demoralized Its not going what he did Like I swear His story almost sounds like a backstory of an opianemasonse whos like a joke But when an action transforms into some kind of forbidden folklore beast Anyway his hustling days continued in the s until he discovered the big money tournaments He entered under his alias and went on to win his first ever tournament as Cesar Morales How was he though But when he was asked to sign one of those autographs he accidentally exposed his identity because he subconsciously wrote his real name Because of this his hustling days were over so he focused on playing and dominating tournaments under his real name And weve heard the nickname the magician because of his aggressive style of play and shot selections that know what even the greatest pool players dared to attempt especially in high pressure situations Ive been Ive been watching the movie Im attempting those shots is one thing Youve got to have balls I have to do that I enjoy playing pool a lot or Billiard That looked like a looking shot but Like this one Effron was just a bystander and some younger professional players playing pool were taking too long in planning their next shot so they handed over the Q stick to Effron They had no idea that Effron already saw the shot from a mile away He did it with his bag on his back and a hanky on his hand Here are more examples Incredible Incredible Incredible He is He is our son Oh my god Yo the math Oh stop it Oh stop it Oh stop it Oh stop it Oh stop it Oh stop it Oh stop it Oh stop it Oh stop it Oh stop it Oh my god Aside from these amazing shots Effron is also the author of the greatest shot in pool history He was playing against one of the greatest pool players at the time Earl Strickland The match was very close as they were tied at brags each in a race to match Whoever wins the rack becomes the champion Strickland did the break to pocket the two balls They attempted to pull off a safety play hiding the one ball behind the seven and eight ball but emailed to do so So Effron took advantage He then handled business as usual Oh because he had these shots go to the end But not until the five ball became the object ball Little bit Just a little bit I said What neednt you have to do that You see what Im talking about No thats right Now why did he do that He got himself with the trouble because the six ball was slightly blocking it But instead of doing a safety play no the five balls No the five balls No the five balls No the five balls No the five balls Oh my goodness Stricklands all my effort ball An impressive shot for sure But this wasnt the greatest shot I was talking about The shot has gotten him into an even bigger trouble Oh yeah And this is the object ball All three other balls are blocking every option Effron had So attempting a safety play let alone hitting the object ball was virtually impossible But despite the predicament Effron ever proceeded to leave his mark by pulling off the greatest shot And the greatest shot ever made in the history of billions The iconic the shot No the sensation when you pull a shot like that must be incredible Effron didnt even have the chance to finish the rack because his legendary shot obliterated all the hope that was left in Stricklands body as he proceeded And then he went to the red there shortly after that What do you have to do What a finish This got Effron His third straight championship win in the Sands Regency Open So liifying his case as one of the greatest pool players to have ever lived I wonder if its a lucrative sport He remained humble while some opponents would flex on him Im breaking the balls very well So thats good for me Ive been playing pool years I feel like Im playing perfect I feel good I feel very comfortable Just looks like a oneman shot You know thats why this game is the toughest game on the planet It usually just responds with humility Well Ive been here recently You know I dont know if Im playing good or if Im playing bad I need luck to play And then it was easy to keep this opponent a high quality billiard seminar Yeah you like this so far Its pretty good over that section And after embarrassing them It usually just say this iconic line Wow thats very humble Goat pretty simple touch To have won the WPA World Championships in two different pool disciplines namely ball and ball A fourtime SANS Regency Champion a time Derby City Classic Champion and a twotime World Champion with a Spartaner Jago Bustamante To this day he has earned the respect to not just his countrymen See its so freaking worthy of a movie because he basically came from nothing to this to greatness the goat Yo gotta make a movie about this man']"

things day this is inevitable but you have to make most of your life while youre still here youre living it and try to think the things that you love all since they became in the Roman Catholic Church is a way for people to honor their dead and today in each country where Roman Catholicism is established there are two days dedicated to celebrating deceased family members November the st known as All Saints Day and November II All Souls day and originally November the st was a somber they meant for church attendance and participating in prayer for loved ones but here is a bit different Filipino culture is very family oriented and all seen today it seems a holiday tradition together with loved ones who are still living and honor and remember those who have passed on todays scene is a time to celebrate loved ones and remember them as if they were feasting and celebrating alongside their living family members and just like that we have made it to the exit somehow yeah oh this goes on and on and on and on and on yeah I think its the whole wall of the cemetery surrounding it yes hello whats up']"

pack the camera away under the stairs With the film remaining in the camera for a couple of years until exposures were taken Then it sent it off in a prepaid envelope to Kodak to develop A week later a box of transparencies would drop through the letterbox And the old man would get out the slide projector turn off the lights and project my puny frame on the screen It probably bought for tuttons He was a terrible photographer my old man Everything was out of focus Even after he procured an autofocus camera Anyway I became a photographer That was showing So nowadays people take selfies a minute and clog up the internet with their posturing All this self adoration is harmful to these young folk you know There should be a public warning sign on every street corner Take in selfies can seriously damage your health Before the invention of smartphones people who werent blessed with good looks used to know their place I used the person taking the photo off Nowadays even twotoned Tess from

married and they at first as most people they were very intimate enjoyed a good married life is the impression I get And the one Im later went started to become a little distant on this Now I should also fill in a very important detail in this story which is quite complex and that is that the girl wife had a disabled brother Now at the time of writing the disabled brother is now living with them and hes Our correspondent our author of the letter is but the year old has the mind of a year old if that So its a very tough situation Now why is he living with them Well when they started to get married it was evident that this disabled man was being taken care of by the mother The father had already passed There were other siblings but not anyone that the mother could trust to take care of the disabled man So on it almost came as a condition for getting married He was asked to promise that when the mother died he would take care of the disabled man the brother would come to live with them and they would take care of him And he made that promise and he has since said I am bound by this prompt promise even though the mother is long gone and things have changed a lot', 'When I was married at the time And they said that they could take the wedding rings because the wedding rings were actually part of the When I heard that I couldnt believe it But that was like a real eye opener when I heard they could take the wedding rings away So for me at all Im coincident with literally losing everything And the woman the woman judge I think she looked at me and was actually sorry Because during the conversation you know so what about your wife Ro My wife left And the house is worth the house is in foreclosure And what about income I dont have any You know so literally I went through a lost soul It was a terrible time at that time Lost all my work Lost marriage Lost house And I was living in a warehouse Yeah So What year was it was That was like that for me Oh God what year was it Its a while now Because I came here in It must have been around Really Yeah I think everyone had a horrible year that year Yes when the real estate market just I was a horrible lot I lost my job my wife my house Right So that time probably you were probably reading as I was you were reading about whether you could be forced to pay for your house if they couldnt provide you notes Oh yeah yeah yeah And remember that The man was living in that time And he actually got a colossal size house Two million a two million dollar house Yeah And they took him to court for not paying his mortgage And he said to the judge I am more than willing to pay my mortgage But I just want to know that if Im paying money to someone do they own the house Yeah yeah And he got away with it I dont know whether he got away with paying for the house because eventually that was like a test case And they quickly realized that the ship was going to have to file it', 'But the actual catch to all of this I You know because obviously you feel bad when somebody asks you for stuff and you cant give it to Because can you imagine if I gave it that guy a car and I gave him a motorbike and I gave this one out You know you we would have nothing All right so you cant do it Its just plain and some point You know we kind of forward that But you still feel bad and it kind of affects our relationship How weve on their side Theres none of that and this came to the fore I want to just tell you a little story Its back when I was not deep in the jungles in in Africa and There was a person that was hurt now He was Basically working on a on a government building And I was there and I was actually providing the materials For that building just as part of a You know community helping our donation and this guy was was building on this roof Yeah and While he was nailing the last sheet on the roof Yeah He actually fell through the roof Okay and by some miracle he he actually just missed some very sharp corners and whatever But the fact is he did come through the roof and he landed on the ground Now You know we were all shocked and we helped him out and he came back to work the next day and he carried on working So we thought okay we were very lucky you know hes okay But then like three days later I get this message that hes paralyzed Hes totally paralyzed And the family are basically holding me accountable because I donated materials So I got hold of the police and I said well we need to go and investigate this you know because you know I think I want to resolve community coming looking on my So I got hold of like the toppiece guys and they came with me and I drove them out in my vehicle It was like ks on the dirt road And eventually that dirt road turned out to be a very bad road and eventually it became a thick sand road And the car just couldnt go any further Yeah So anyway so we decided we get were gonna have to walk the last three or four kilometers Were gonna have to walk and was so hot But I was walking with these policemen To find this village with this guy was paralyzed so that we could get him to the hospital and we could do a proper Prognosis of what the problem was And really to sue that relationships within the community Yeah But on the way I was thinking my head you know because I was hoping to drive my truck all the way there and pick him up and drive out but obviously We stuck and now we got three kilometers to walk And while we walk here Im just saying to the guy we need to somehow organize transport Because how are we going to lift this paralyzed person And just by Spiluck The bush came this donkey car Actually was an ox wagon Yeah I had an ox actually had two oxen and it had a nice back And I thought oh great what we do we just come and deal this Ox wagon Yeah And we go and pick up this guy We blame in the back of this thing and we take him back to the car we can get him to the hospital Yeah Anyway what happened was the policeman said okay he theyll speak to the guy Yeah They spoke to this guy and they were like talking talking talking talking I just thought they were going to come at you and say lets go yeah Were taking your car Were taking your car After about minutes they came back to me and they said okay listen yeah weve sorted it out And they continue to walk and I said whoa whoa Yeah Are we not commandeering this This Ox cart We need it Yeah They said no no no no no no dont worry about it Weve spoken to the person And weve explained everything that this persons paralyzed and he needs our help But this person said no they dont want to help him They know him and they dont want to help him And so I said so is that it Cant we just commandeer it take it They said no no no no we cant do that he said no And that that is when the penny dropped I mean not even a policeman but you know the topcharged guy Can get a little peasant guy To you know go against his saying no yeah And he was willing to just continue on and look for another make another plan yeah Now thats when I realized this is how these people work Okay and Ive been viewing it wrong you know all along Ive been feeling bad when I said no yeah But actually Thats not a problem if a guy says no Even if in a serious situation where somebody is dying and you know hes getting paralyzed No no and you cant take my stuff yeah and they move on and this policeman didnt think anything of it As it turned out Im amazed what just finished the story as it turned out we walked the other three kilometers We didnt see anybody else And when we got there we found the guy and he was like sitting When he saw us hed like ran away and then when we got to the cut He was like lying on the bed like halfdying And so We looked around and there was nothing except a wheelbarrow So the policeman said put him in the wheelbarrow yeah and Get his brother to push the wheelbarrow now And thats what happened the British latest guy so you was like lying Like I did in this wheelbarrow and his brother was pushing this wheelbarrow and me and the other two please spend the walking back I promise you he hadnt even gone like meters in this wheelbarrow and all of a sudden by some miracle this guy could walk He was walking and he was fine and he was okay and nothings no problem Dont worry Hes okay Because he knew he was not going to be able to sit in that wheelbarrow for three or four kilometers And he also didnt want to go kilometers to the hospital and get caught up with all of that and So nothing ever came of that because you know by some miracle he was but the point Im getting to is When black people or when Filipinos asked for something Its just asking They just hoping yeah you know They dont even have their relationship with you to ask They dont even really believe that youre going to give it to them They just asking because theres a chance Theres a small chance In fact similar to that place in Africa Theres a guy that whenever I go there he always asks before one dollar Yeah and youll say okay Im only asking for this one dollar In today and I wont ask again and you know you caught me because I did give him the dollar the first time But then like minutes later he sees me again Another dollar and I said Im just giving you a dollar you say you know that said Yeah but thats hell always just ask is just in their makeup Theyll

'invaded', 'rebellion conspired', 'democracy', 'president hurricane']","['So yeah Philippines in addition to Puerto Rico and Guam remained unincorporated territories Puerto Rico why dont you say kind of just ignore what Im saying Thats the Cuba Im an important enough strategic enough to be considered to become states like Hawaii or Alaska So they sort of faded from American consciousness Like this is why we never heard about this in school Like it didnt make it into the history books in any salient way And how far the Philippines had faded from peoples mind became very clear in December of during World War II The US had owned the Philippines for like years when a fleet of Japanese bombers flew across the Pacific and bombed an American naval base in Hawaii And they took their bombing out from every place in every three years And they took their planes But what we dont really remember is on that day Japan bombed Guam and the Philippines to American territories as well as several other American and British territories That I do Yesterday December a date which will live in infamy Heres the draft of this speech This is the original draft that Eddie Orson had the day marking up before he gave it Zoom in a little bit and youll see on this draft that it mentioned the Philippines originally But after youre across it out he crossed out the mention of Manila Yes the Philippines was on some map somewhere Yes we technically owned it But the people really didnt want to hear about it because these people werent Americans Thats crazy The Supreme Court had decided that They werent going to become states anytime soon So why mention them After that day Japan actually fell on invaded the Philippines They didnt do that to Hawaii but they did to the Philippines until the end of the war At which point the Philippines were finally granted independence And I know it sounds horrible that they left them out But I think the whole narrative of them going because we had stayed out of the war up until then That was actually the reasoning that we got into the war because the president at the time said he wasnt going to join the war unless provoked to do so And so now you have this narrative to because again you have to sell it on the people because the people will fight against you of the country So in our situation its the US We just got bombed Or yeah But if you would have said the Philippines just got bombed Its just like why do we care about that Were only worried because now theyre kind of looking at And this is just speculation Im guessing here Im reaching that these people dont care or want to spend money protecting another country when our country just got hit Right So Im not saying that it was justified Im just saying that I kind of understand why it was done this way because priority number one is or was And its not that it was okay Im just saying this is the way that Im perceiving it That they were selling war for the United States Bringing up other countries would probably like regress it a little bit So thats just my guess is that they were It was just trying to subvert to the American people Which it was all right I mean thats basically the same concept as Pearl Harbor was at the time the most like impactful war crime in Americas history at that moment up until that moment And then was the same concept Had we mentioned like lets say they went after like Puerto Rico or something like that or another US territory We wouldnt have mentioned that Were able to probably ignored that to be perfectly honest Or maybe not I mean times have changed We might be like we got to go protect our brothers and sisters in one of our territories or periods brothers and sisters And we got to fight for us Because I mean there was attempts of the same not necessarily planes but like bombings and stuff like that in the UK and stuff like that So I mean its a crazy thing And I think its just them trying to sell war Just like what he was saying earlier It was an attempt to sell war Thats why they omitted other countries Right Not saying its okay Just saying thats my assumption Fast forward to today And this we own you but youre not really Americans President established by the Supreme Court still applies to four million people who live in unincorporated territories Or lets just call it a spade of spade Lets call them what they are These are colonial possessions The people who live here dont experience the full rule of law They dont get trial by jury They dont have full representation in our democracy And they dont get to vote for the president This is why when Hurricane hits Puerto Rico the government response is not nearly what it should be The way Trump talked about that was so awful The other country is not a part of us The mirror is exactly how the Supreme Court talked about behind corporate territories Theyre for revenue not to compete with American farmers We conquered these places but we didnt want to bring the people fully into the American project We left them out And there they remain today I do think that we had tried a couple times on a couple places to make them a state mainly the Latin American countries but they were I mean thats the thing Just like the Filipinos theyre such a proud people that if they feel like theyre getting like you know the handout or whatever theyll fight and say we dont need your help Right theyre very independent Yeah and they should be However like I would have loved to see some of these countries become statehood if they were willing to Or if they wanted it Im not Im not proforcing it because what other Oh yeah now theyre talking about Washington DC becoming a state Yeah So it can have representation because DC I dont think can represent itself in elections and stuff like that Right', 'Oh okay So this is where things really heat up Its now Spain loses the war obviously And the US now owns Puerto Rico Guam and they claim the Philippines The whole Philippines The whole Philippines But the whole Philippines who have been fighting for their freedom for years are like no no no no no You just walked in here on our rebellion and conspired with the Spanish to make it look like you were liberating us No this is our country We dont need another colonized Yeah that is And this is where things really heat up The Filipinos start fighting again for their independence in this time against the United States It is a pretty horrible bloody war one that I never learned about in school It includes massacres of men women and children by the United States and hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths But the US eventually won And they established a government in the Philippines Back in the US the appetite for expansion continued to go down and people sort of just forgot about the Philippines They forgot that there was a war there One newspaper summed it up by saying Americans didnt know if the Philippines were islands or canned fruit But the fact that the US went to war and now owned the Philippines in addition to Puerto Rico and Guam So this baked a very important question one that hadnt been asked before Which is is all of this land America Are these people Americans This was a huge question And the answer to that question affects how we see these territories still today Okay so a few years after these wars theres a guy in New York City whos importing oranges from one of these territories Puerto Rico And hes paying tariffs on these imports because you know thats what you do when youre importing oranges from another country Wait a minute another country This guy was like didnt we conquer Puerto Rico and Guam and the Philippines Isnt that America The constitution says that you cant put tariffs on stuff coming from other parts of the US Like New Jersey cant put tariffs on like avocados from California So he sued and his case and a bunch of others like it made it to the Supreme Court So now the Supreme Court must decide is this land where we just won a war Is this America Are these Americans If they are do they get all the same rights as other Americans Do they get to vote Do they get to participate in the US economy without tariffs Like any other state does And honestly this isnt a question about oranges and tariffs The real question at stake here is is America the land of the free where all are created equal Or are we an empire No different than any other empire that scoops up colonial possessions in war and rules the people who are usually black and brown as subjects not fully a part of the country That was the question that was at stake And in this series of cases in the early s the Supreme Court decided that America was the latter Is the latter They created a new category of land called unincorporated territories where the people dont have any representation in the democracy But where Congress could create laws on their own particularly laws dealing with revenue which would not be allowed by the Constitution for states within the Union So in great revenues So thats totally unconstitutional for other parts of our country In other words unincorporated territories are land we control and exploit for revenue but whose people dont get to vote and dont get the right to try to like their own Were ridiculous So yeah ridiculous So how long', 'Okay so this is where things really heat up Its now Spain loses the war obviously And the US now owns Puerto Rico Guam and they claim the Philippines But the local Filipinos who have been fighting for their freedom for years are like no no no no no You just walked in here on our rebellion and conspired with the Spanish to make it look like you were liberating us No this is our country We dont need another colonizer Oh they know They know about this is a staged That battle was staged Well this is troublesome The Philippines just get involved in the conspiracy between America and Spain right This is shameful right The Filipinos start fighting again for their independence in this time against the United States It is a pretty horrible bloody war one that I never learned about in school It includes massacres of men women and children by the United States and hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths The US eventually won and they established a government in the Philippines Back in the US the appetite for expansion continued to go down and people sort of just forgot about the Philippines They forgot that there was a war there One newspaper summed it up by saying Americans didnt know if the Philippines were islands or canned fruit The fact remained that the US went to war and now owned the Philippines in addition to Puerto Rico and Guam So this baked a very important question one that hadnt been asked before Which is is all of this land America Are these people Americans This was a huge question And the answer to that question affects how we see these territories still today Oh really Interesting Okay so a few years after these wars theres a guy in New York City whos importing oranges from one of these territories Puerto Rico And hes paying tariffs on these imports because you know thats what you do when youre importing oranges from another country Wait a minute another country This guy was like didnt we conquer Puerto Rico and Guam and the Philippines Isnt that America The constitution says that you cant put tariffs

of land called unincorporated territories Where the people dont have any representation in the democracy But where Congress can create laws on their own particularly laws dealing with revenue which would not be allowed by the Constitution for states within the Union Oh my god this is rubbish This is rubbish rule How can you declare the liberty having such a rubbish rule Dont you guys think so We can create revenue laws stuff thats totally unconstitutional for other parts of our country In other words unincorporated territories are land we control and exploit for revenue but whose people dont get to vote and dont get the right to trial by jury So yeah the Philippines in addition to Puerto Rico and Guam remained unincorporated territories a place that the US could kind of just ignore without a lot of consequence They werent important enough for strategic enough to be considered to become states like Hawaii or Alaska Well theyre only saying things that suit themselves right This is insane']"

old story of a rich man and a fisherman that I love Im not gonna share the whole story with you but the gist of it goes like this There was a rich man that during the middle of the work week was walking down along the ocean near a pier to try to think about how to make more money and how to close his latest deal and in the distance there was a fisherman that was just casting his fishing line out into the ocean trying to catch some fish for that days dinner And as he got closer to him the rich man asked the fisherman what are you doing out here its a work day how come youre fishing instead of working And the fisherman said why would I wanna do that And the rich man said well if youre out there working and making more money you could buy a bigger house and then the fisherman said and why would I wanna do that And the rich man said well then you could buy a nicer car with even more money And the fisherman said and why would I wanna do that And then again the rich man said well if youre out there and youre putting in hours or hours or hours then you can make even more and more and maybe one day youre gonna be able to buy a yacht And the fisherman again said and why would I wanna do that And a bit exasperated by this point in the conversation the rich man says well if you work your whole life many hours and work very hard then one day even if it was in the middle of a work week youll be able to be sitting out here in the ocean relaxing and enjoying the sun on your back and not having a care in your life And then the fisherman said and what do you think Im doing right now You know I think so many of us work so hard to try to find contentment and peace at some future time in life and in my journeys here in the Philippines I really had to rethink what does it mean to live a content life If you are more interested in what that looks like in your own life follow along I have more to share with you in this episode', 'So its kind of nice back here Its kind of like a get a little getaway and a little private forest We planted all these coconuts here These dwarf coconuts Theyre still pretty small looking and its kind of weird looking I mean look at this one Like what One foot of stump Then it goes right into the ferns after one foot Its very strange So whats this tree here huh That we plant Mangosteen Mangosteen this one Yes Okay thats Mangosteen And these are lasunni trees here These two that were here before when we bought the property before we developed it And heres one of the original coconut trees that was here This one here And then this is a new one that we planted a dwarf coconut along with these dwarf coconuts here What other fruit trees did you grow back here Avocado jackfruit actually These two here are avocado Avocado is a dwarf avocado Its never become big and big like five years already Huh And this other one is a jump form which is the desave Where The other one That one This little one Or this big one The big one Okay Thats jackfruit a small one Its hard to tell when theyre young what they are until they start giving you fruit But these are all probably three four years old You know these coconuts are five How old is Mangosteen Four Four years Four years Whats this one huh Thats a mango Thats four or five years old This one Yes Thats a dwarf Thats a mango Okay apple Apple mango Its a mango still Its an apple mango And one time it produced three pieces of fruits And born and I very attractive with it Then we decided to get it instead of let that produce many And we just I hope knows like a spell If you have this right away then never produce again Its right on the Dont talk to me about spells Crazy These people on the province believe in spells and shit all the time', 'Also another way you can save money on your food is to grow your own We started but what we didnt do and what we should have done is we should have planted more trees when we were first here Yes that is advantage because by the time you are living here you already have best your fruits Absolutely Every day I go in the garden and I stare at the coconut trees Why wont you grow Why wont you give us coconuts Why would you give a kid But it is almost like that You look at the window That mango tree has got fewer leaves I think its a half inch taller today If I just wait until it is better fruit you keep watching the calendar Another month has gone by new fruit Another month new fruit Another month new fruit But we already have been in some guyabana Absolutely They were planted five years ago were they What do you call it the English style fruit Sao Sao Sao Sao Sao Sao fruit Sao Its a lemon thats Sao Svew So youre fighting for a lemon thinking its an orange Youre face goods like this Your lips go No Its going to show Sao Svew I got it Wait how are you going to say that Sao Sao Go ahead Vanu But what you want to say is these are planted before you arrived I think it was they were put in And last year we got fruit Yeah the This year now all of our guyabana has had given us fruit which is such an amazing feeling Yeah As if we put them in plug If we put them in the ground today were waiting for years to get any fruit For five years it depends Yeah Well if you only What you got at the Markwood Markwood If you mark what youve been cut a year or two off cant you Yeah Three years probably will give you fruits already But its still a long time to wait If its something you know you definitely want Plan your garden first Put your trees in Vegetables not so much youre lonely looking to three four months for vegetables to come through But certainly your trees If you have a lot of land designed a garden and the house at the same time dont neglect the garden Thats what we did It was a bit of a mistake Weve now got the garden how we want it But had we done this years ago we could have mature trees now We could have coconuts we could have mangoes And well be happy But We still have Were still happy because we still have some fruit and vegetables They grow quite easily here We got a lot to learn We really do Were not experts but its part of the fun']"

and see the family and see that they have a bad refrigerator and theyre cooking outside and think oh my God I got to buy them a refrigerator I have to buy them a stove I have to you know they dont have enough protein You know so you want to go buy them some more chicken and some beef and they got nowhere to put it so you think and maybe I should buy them a freezer So you cant change their life and dont try to The only thing that will happen when you flood them with money to help them make their life better is itll be easier for them to ask in the future They wont look to solve their own problem Theyll just say hey my sisters boyfriend is rich Even though youre not they think youre rich And if we need some lets go ask him He bought the refrigerator and he bought a freezer Maybe hell

three years online or one year online Five months online youve got to slow down You have to slow down and make sure everything is just right and relaxed', 'since we started traveling together many of you have been asking us how we save money in our travels for example how to find cheap deals or get better price in Flight bookings whether its International domestic or hotels if you ask me the same question when I first started traveling Ill tell you I opened all the tabs on the browser and opened every single Airline website and compare the prices between different airlines which is super time consuming and inefficient which brings us to todays video sponsor kayak we always try to look for cheap deals when possible and kayak has some great deals for example we actually booked our trip to Hong Kong through kayak it was pesos for return Which is less than dollars apart from the website Kaya also has an app so I use that app more actually so Im gonna go to the kayak app Im gonna screen record this so you can see this and so then if youve got a particular destination in mind so if you want to go to Hong Kong then you can just type it in here somebody Hong Kong and you choose a period of time you want to travel to so July to August that sounds good and then go to kayak so because kayak is a meta search engine so well show you the whole list of flight details that you can choose from but if youre like me and usually want to go with the flow and you want to be spontaneous about your travels you can also use kayaks explore feature if youve got a geography you can probably go around the map and just see all destinations that you want to go so like if you want to see how much is going to I know Europe maybe then you can see the exact price here or if youre not good at geography then you can go to the list and you can just scroll through all the destinations and know the exact price in the period of time that you choose to travel so another thing I really like about a kayak app is the trips feature the reason why is because very often when I arrive in airports sometimes I have to pick up my phone scroll through all the emails and find the booking confirmation show it to the airport staff but you dont have to do that so you can actually go to trips feature here so in upcoming trip were actually going to Melbourne Australia so stay tuned for our Australian series here you can see the Melbourne trip and then if you press on it you can see all your flight details and booking confirmation so its a lot easier rather than scrolling through all the emails if youre planning your next trip somewhere and want to save money then check out kayak to find great travel deals now lets see really Boracay is so famous and why youre so famous', 'So woman doesnt work out Leaves the sourcase in their mouth for whatever reason Theres going to be you know the humidity the food There is just a sort of reasons the post office The things just are not the same Youre going to have to get used to a slower pace of life waiting in line learning patience The post office is hit or miss If you are getting a package from a Amazon delivered from the United States youre getting a postal package Lazada and Shoppy in some cases youre going to need to actually physically be there Its not the convenient United States where you show up and you have packages on your doorstep or you know its locked in your locker while youre on vacation for three weeks Not how it works here So the convenience is a bad experience with the woman the weather brownouts Brownouts happen and they could happen often depending on where youre living I know Nodumigeti is notorious for them Ive experienced them here in Barakai You will not experience them in BGC which is essentially America and the Philippines But yeah theres just things like that that some people maybe if youre an older guy or your convenience guy theres just certain things that are going to be maybe not negotiable for some people But you know of the time life is much better but you will need to learn to be patient Do not argue with staff at places Do not call the manager If you go to return something and you lost your receipt or something its a wrap Youre not getting a refund Its the simplest thing in the world The customer service is not geared towards pleasing you This is their country and they operate that they want to Your input is not needed Theyre not looking for you to explain to them how things work This is not your home So you dont need to tell them well America goes like this Theyre going to tell you well theyre saying America I remember you say stuff like that and people go oh well you know when I moved to Nevada from California I said well in California you register your car like this and they said this aint California Same thing in the Philippines You dont really need to tell them about how it goes in America because this is not America as much as it might seem like it And its heavily Western influenced It aint America So if youre looking for America stay in America']"

lowkey reminds me of like the old parts of Hong Kong in Kowloon it looks something like this many different street vendors like Street Markets and youve got shopping malls that looks something like this as well and youve got buildings like obviously you know were coming to the Philippines I didnt expect it to be a really high expectation but hey yo but but yeah the infrastructures here are relatively old like the ones in Hong Kong some areas so I guess this kind of reminds me of Home in a way kind of reminds me of home but uh yeah I always like exploring new areas especially in Asia

jeepney thats the thing about traveling I like seeing new things and learning about new knowledge different culture in the new country but now were still walking on the streets and to be honest I expect I thought there would be a lot more Street Markets because I really want to go Street Market and see different things but so far weve only seen one stream I think were missing something I think

should never get lost in the jungle If you get lost you wont be able to accomplish your mission You will jump or die as your team The stakes will be high in three months time These recruits face real enemies They must prove they can lead the way Each recruit is given a unique navigation route comprising of any five of these targets This chart contains a set of colors with different corresponding letters They have to find their way point to point but no one brews the same for any of these recruits So it might sound very easy when you watch in a video over right But from some of them they used to teach land nav Land nav is already difficult for recruits to grasp but these guys are doing land navigation through a jungle And then every single persons route is different So therefore you cant just look for the brush thats turned over and find out hey the last guy walked through here So for them to finish this thats impressive They have four hours to complete the test and the course could see them covering over kilometers If a recruit returns late or does not complete his answer sheet correctly he will fail Were recruiting as reach three of his five targets in under two hours Its degrees in the distance is meters from here Its my fourth target So for those of you that are not familiar with land navigation so he said hes going degrees He already plotted his point So hell plot when he comes to this plot hell already have his next plot measured out He said degrees in the compass and hes got to go meters So in order he already has his pace count So each time he walks every other step he knows hey paces Im meters Every time he does paces hell either have some beads or whatever method he uses and hell go like that and hell move a bead over Thats meters And then when he has beads moved over he knows that hes meters and he needs to start looking out for his next target Now under his last destination So hes going to take under the wing The directions to this one are straight forward Mmhmm This one is much better radius I guess', 'Tomorrow the recruits will face their toughest challenge yet recruits remain in the fight to become an elite scout ranger Okay Today is the beginning of Hell Week A culmination of everything theyve learned put to the test For the next six days there will be no rest for them We push the students to the edge testing their stamina psychological toughness As a day goes by the test will get tougher If they fail one part the recruits will be recycled to the next class or returned to their mother unit First up is land navigation Land navigation is very important As a scout ranger a scout ranger should never get lost in the jungle Very sure If you get lost you wont be able to accomplish your mission You will jump or dash your team The stakes Yeah again land navigation is one of those things that no one really pays too much attention about when they talk about all the high speed people But if youre like a recon element or especially like a ranger where youre pretty much in the desert or the jungle doing your thing on your own then yeah youre going to need to be pretty proficient at land navigation because if you get lost youre sort of a SOL So be high in three months time when these recruits face real enemies They must prove they can lead the way Each recruit is given a unique navigation route comprising of any five of these targets The chart contains a set of colors with different corresponding letters They have to find their way point to point but no one route is the same for any of these recruits They have four hours to complete the test and the course could see them covering over kilometers If a recruit returns late or does not complete his answer sheet correctly he will fail Recruit has reached three of his five targets in under two hours Its degrees and the distance is meters from here Its my fourth target Now onto his last destination Oh yeah Its a pretty good place to stay in the Mingutis But the directions to this one are just straight forward Yeah without terrain it could be pretty hard to find your point sometimes Now normally when youre doing land navigation what you can do is go to something near your point whether it be like a big hill or the bend in a road you can just use that to run over there super quick and then shoot a direction like a hundred meters away as opposed to being like a thousand meters away and just trying to go in a straight line the entire time But with this sort of terrain it probably makes it a lot harder He is lost And hes not the only one Time is ticking down If they dont give back in the next hour they will fail and theyre a long way from home Recruits are battling to become elite Philippine scout rangers Its hell week And theyre in the middle of their navigation exam Time is running out for Recruit while some have already made it to the finish line But the mistakes are numerous I dont think I can do the basic things I dont have a reference I dont have a plan to do anything One has run into bad luck Recruit claims he has been the victim of theft A cow has eaten his test paper I bet thats a first for the instructors The instructors dont believe him Its a nervous weight as they check out his story They cant verify his story but they will give him the benefit of the doubt Recruit has given another chance at the test But failed this time and he will be out of the course Back in the field Recruit gets some help With just minutes to go his fifth and final station is done Recruit heads back to the training school to meet his comrades Sometimes the points will have the degree on the point itself So if you go to the wrong point you can at least find out where you are on the map So I dont know if this course had that but when the points do have that it is very helpful Because you can just read Justin and shoot a new asmit or go to a new direction Recruit returns from his second consecutive test just in the nick of time Its the moment of truth But its not good news Hes failed As a recycled recruit it is certain that his journey to be a scout ranger is over At the end of the navigation day recruits have failed African cow man That cow ruined a crew', 'Next the recruits begin the hellaborn training phase The fun stuff Scout rangers can deploy quickly into conflict areas by air landing into hostile territory A helicopter is a big target These men need to get out as quickly and safely as possible to avoid the helicopter getting hit Balian Im talking about the Tommalon and then the secure landing zone The secure landing zone is the personal during movement loading and unloading of the personage This takes here can cost lives even in training The training is very important The scout ranger is not only the one who needs to be trained First recruits gear up for the quick deployment method If the terrain is clear the helicopter can fly fast and low while the troops disperse That looks like so much fun Of course when you start getting further and further into the training its not going to be so much about smoking you because theyre trying to actually teach you and then still stuff in you But man I would be psyched for this This looks like a lot of fun Its a risky foot jump and one mistake could result in broken bones Thats cool Oh that looks like it hurt Next they have an even tougher challenge I gotta say repelling from helicopters is not that hard Its actually a lot of fun The thing you need to get over with is walking backwards on the helicopter and backing out of the helicopter Thats the biggest thing that psyched me out originally but its a lot of fun Recruits practice the skill at the tower earlier in training But now they take it to new heights They need to complete nervewracking drops from and finally feet above the ground with nothing to stop them but their hands So feet not too bad also not too bad but when you start getting to then youre like geez this is actually going to take a while to repel down But setting up like being the one who actually learned to set up the helicopter repelling rigs especially for the Huey itself its very easy to set up the repelsus and for the Huey So these guys should be pretty confident just because theres not a whole lot they can go wrong with repelling As long as youre not slipping your brake handouts then you should be fine Just the thing you need to get over with is not gripping too much with your with your guide hand Because if you grip with this hand while youre actually going down youre going to start burning your hand a lot especially when you get to feet when you get to like feet this hands going to be smoking if youre really gripping hard if youre really nervous So I might see that people might start burning in their hands So you need to be careful You need to be careful with your hands and be careful with your hands One step further at feet the winds become harder to battle The thing is located near the mountainous areas so tendencies for the wind to blow from all directions making it harder for the pilots to control the aircraft Thats fine Next its time for the big one One mistake during this foot drop could prove fatal Yeah Recruit experiences trouble is unable to control his descent Quickly an instructor its the break I did a very similar thing when I was repelling Sometimes you just go down a lot quicker than you expect and your break isnt as effective Its kind of scary because you think youre just going to shatter your knees But you do have people with the training

left her bag with the aunt as she went swimming now Its only family together here at the beach folks So thats why this is a bit of a weird story So she finishes her swimming okay She finishes her swimming and returns to the beach and the phone is gone okay The phone is gone the she put the phone in a bag okay And the the bag was next to the aunt okay It was sort of the aunts bag okay The aunt didnt realize her bag was missing until they began to pack up to go Coinciding with the year old finishing her swim and coming out you know with her cousins to everyone whos leaving So they called them in from swimming so immediately the first culprit the first culprit of the stolen phone is the ex girlfriend of the guy Because the ex girlfriend also needed a phone and the guy bought a phone for the year old not the ex girlfriend So the ex girlfriend was kind of pissed so she became the culprit I mean talk about selfish this girl has a new boyfriend He should buy her a phone not the ex boyfriend but shes so selfish She expected a phone from the ex boyfriend anyway lets carry on her folks So the ex girlfriend is a culprit and the next culprit was the aunt okay And Ill tell you why a week after the stolen phone incident okay The aunt who was looking after the girls phone she bought a new phone for her boyfriend okay So word was getting around like where did she suddenly get enough money to buy a phone for her livein boyfriend As the livein boyfriend was a freaking fisherman who had no real salary the aunt just worked sort of freelance as a beautician doing manicures pedicures so she had no real income so suddenly she buys a phone for her livein boyfriend her excuse because she was questioned was that she borrowed the money to buy the phone and a lot of these Provinces people they do have easy access to loans and they like them because the monthly payback amount is Pretty low so anyway the year old told the foreign boyfriend that it couldnt be the aunt because she had always taken care of her More than the others you know like it was basically a mother daughter relationship between the two so it couldnt have been the aunt I mean she would not do her that way the aunt saw the year old as a daughter So it could not have been her could not have been the aunt who stole the phone besides that I mean the phone she got for her boyfriend was not the phone that the guy bought for the year old the phone was a different brand so the year old is telling to the foreign guy via messenger that you know It couldnt be her because it was a different brand the phone and the year old is trying to deflect the blame to the exgirlfriend She doesnt want the foreign guy to blame the aunt she wants to foreign guy to blame his exgirlfriend She took it as you know she did express her anger towards the phone being bought for the year old in the first place So the foreign guy says to the year old you know it must be the end Its got to be the end because what she must have done was she you know She wasnt stupid enough to just give her livein partner the phone she just stole instead You know she sold the phone that she just stole at the marketplace and bought him another phone And I mean for no other reason than the timing you got to think about the time it was one week after the year olds phone was stolen Okay now the fisherman the liban boyfriend here he had never had a phone in his years You know and then a week after the year old phone gets stolen the guy gets a new phone I mean come on line things up here folks the year old though was kind of angry at the guy You know the guy the foreign guy for not blaming the exgirlfriend not putting the blame where she thought it ought to be like She said you must still love your exgirlfriend and the guy is telling her to get into reality like it has to be the aunt', 'The exgirlfriends not there But she moved away Anyway he greets them you know the two kids theyre shocked as they suddenly you know out of the blue you know that he arrived I mean there was no forewarning I mean he did not message them that he was coming because you know it was no way to message them This is the province His ex is exgirlfriend which you know was the love of his life in the past was not there Okay Its you know at the time you know now shes living with her boyfriend in a different area But there is a certain dynamic to this story here folks the girls family wants her to dump her boyfriend the father of her baby who is a loser with no job and they want her to get back with this foreign guy here Okay so theres a bit of a and this is getting this story is going to be a little more complicated as we go on here folks So the guy is hes sitting down this foreign dude you know hes sitting down you know on some wooden bench you know how it is in the province you know they just make benches out of wood Anyway you know its there with the extended family and you know he went down to the sorry story story You got a few of these big beers red horses right Because they dont have anything else They only have red horse in the province Anyway so the families there the extended family slowly more and more people come as you know word gets around that this foreigner is back you know after three years I mean everyone loves the foreigner right Anyway theyre in front of the exgirlfriends house and and so theyre talking but theres something happening behind the foreigners back that he doesnt realize']"
