Whatsup people welcome to a new episode here 
in the Philippines and we're currently here  
in Manila and as you can see the title today 
we heading to Tagaytay and we just came from a  
bike and you see the sky today it's super cloudy 
and just now actually rained a little bit yeah  
yeah I like the day weather actually no no we 
prepare a sunny day in Tagaytay with us it's going  
to be a little bit colder than Manila actually 
yeah so uh all right let's head in so some  
Security checks I'm gonna put on a camera from now

a motorbike here 155 pesos to EDSA oh wait no this  
one answer these are preex some shopping that's 
t-shirt actually looks like the one you bought me

is so different when we drive I saw so many new  
buildings it's like it's kind of remind me to 
Russia it's like no not a lot of markets something  
new new area but looks so good right so it's still 
developing you think um let's see I think we need  
to ask people because I don't know where to go to 
tagayte which exit it is yeah I think we need to  
go and ask someone yeah no idea what to do sorry 
sorry excuse me just learning where how do I go  
to Target okay two okay thank you all right so uh 
it's K2 I think last time we were here in Phoenix  
and we were so confused as we went to go back 
to BGC and uh some very local oh last time we  
got raised a bag remember we were here yeah 
FedEx and then some friends local I point us  
to the right direction and otherwise it's quite 
confusing this is a rather Big Bus Terminal here
so there were big backpacks yeah it's 
okay we decided to Don't Take This  
Time luggage yeah otherwise it's so inconvenient
number three gate number two number three oh 
there looks like this uh well now announcement's  
everywhere and he had to have got an arcade in 
the middle of the bus terminal that's awesome  
it's like if you're so bored you wait for like 
one or two hours and just come here and play It's  
like a uh play at an arcade all right let's see 
gate one two four it's over there I see and good  
thing here I've got lots of a breakfast place 
as well m-e DIY I didn't see this before it's  
like a mini sock yeah but why would people come 
all the way here to shopping it's like oh today  
I need to buy a screwdriver so I'm gonna come 
up maybe they come from another city like so  
far away from Manila and they come here like wow 
I want a shopping right now right okay just go  
to SMR they've got everything there uh gate two 
gate one here this is to where Hala Pala Lankan
J2 is over there it seems that today because 
now it's early in the morning on a Monday  
morning that's why traffic is crazy just saying 
coming here luckily my driver I thought my driver  
was fast for a little even faster I think oh 
my brother so she is so cool what's my job I  
was like but he's very skilled so I like it 
all right so we're finally here at day two  
it doesn't seem like there are a lot of people 
around here today so maybe we will have empty  
bus maybe oh but looks like we need to wait 
for here for a little bit where you going  
when you buy tickets yeah oh this way okay 
all right friendly locals showing us around
I don't actually don't know how to 
pronounce it properly is it takes
oh that one okay all right this is our 
bus let's see how many people want to pass  
oh it's very noisy yeah we'll go 
I don't know win and start looks  
like empty have you heard about 
the Philippines time don't know
there's one person here
you think you want to sit here yeah all right 
looks like around a company bus to be honest  
and you put your luggage on top so it's 
very nice there is no one on the bus awkward
oops but there's still no one on 
the bus are you hungry foreign
but there is a market out there I'm a bit tempted 
because right now there's not a lot of people  
around maybe they won't go now in 10 minutes you 
want to go and buy food baby no one here anyway  
yeah all right then okay okay I will be back 
in now five minutes maybe all right let's go

out because uh I don't want to miss the bus  
Edgar Watson's pharmacies here I don't know if 
they've got some supermarkets here let's see
uh where can I find food like five foot like 
banana biscuit like 7-Eleven just over there  
five minutes five minutes living oh five minutes 
okay all right good side all right all right

whoops all right let's stop  
it so five minutes they say so I've 
got five minutes so I'll run around  
okay yeah five minutes gotta be quick but there's 
no one on a bus just now anyway five minutes
um see I'm walking like I'm terrible 
fast right now hopefully I can find  
some food I wish Dunkin Donuts yeah but 
I think Elena would like it uh what else
speeding someone give me a speeding fine
there's a bow there is a some Bakery I believe  
what else is here I need to 
find something Elena likes
they have a hard dark here I 
don't think Elena will like that  
it's not a lot not a lot like banana like 
fresh fruits kind of thing so I think for  
maybe we just buy a donut or something maybe just 
one I'm not really Keen but I'm worried that Elena  
will get hungry like so I'm just gonna grow a 
donut here let's see what flavors they've got
all kinds of flavor here

I like the one with custard maybe that's 
the one we've got oh Strawberry Fields yeah

wants it we can share it or something oh 
five minutes so I guess that's just it
25 right about 50. all right so I've got 
a donut here hopefully we uh don't miss  
the bus maybe I should head out for me here 
and then just turn right maybe it's easier so

hey there you go whoa I love the weather here 
it's so cozy and here we've got some seedlings  
here facing the pool too bad like this is kind 
of like blocking the view otherwise without the  
tree is the thing will look really nice with the 
views and everything but anyways it doesn't look  
very hot to be honest it doesn't look like it's 
heated but again until we go in we don't know  
whoa whoa I love this oh I love this 
bathroom oh they've got a bathtub here too  
whoa we don't have puffed up in our apartment 
yeah so and they've got a shower area here as

we were settling in the room Just Dance someone 
knock on the door and they gave us welcoming drink
smells good um
sweet very sweet how is it sour no so 
strange really like mix everything okay  
I have strong pineapple taste it tastes like 
pineapple juice but I feel like there's a bit  
of soda in it I don't know why I can't really 
taste the calamasi but it's like a app I put a  
pineapple juice refreshing yeah quite refreshing 
yeah me too uh we haven't decided where we're  
gonna eat at the moment but uh anyway let's head 
out to find some food okay so after a couple  
minutes walk we are finally here in this area so 
we actually have a mission to come into this place  
so we walk for around like 15 minutes just then 
and we almost here at this place called Cecilia  
Cafe and here I believe according to 
lots of online reviews it has one of  
the best Buko pie so that's what we're here 
for wow there we are busy traffic everywhere
oh It's haunting lots of our guests everywhere 
these are main course hello hello I don't know  
why they're screaming but uh yeah no I

um Cecilia as a Google Maps maybe like two 
minutes walk two more minutes walk yeah  
but you know it's okay so we're gonna 
have to allow very soon we're going
there's now a lot of our walking power

usually commute with deep knees or if you have 
a car you drive Syria Maybe yeah Coffee House

oh it's very hot day today very sunny  
so yeah this looks good looks very modern oh who

be honest or like taking a like a tricycle just  
then oh they'd have lots of um is it this place
