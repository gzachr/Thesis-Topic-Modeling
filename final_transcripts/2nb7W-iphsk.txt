 But you're Friday. The freshest. A B S. So this is basically I feel. The Christmas Abba you get on the TV network. It is. With all these popular and stars and stuff but this has been requested so often and we've seen fellow creators check it out and stuff and they were like you have to check it. It is great. And the funny thing is you know we used to do this when we were children and I'm sure if you've been following the podcast and stuff some of the stories like you know how it is sometimes and how long this was probably done remotely I'd imagine because of the whole restrictions that I don't know. Because based on our conversations with other Filipina creators that work on TV they have set how TV broadcasters have been following closely the regulations, the safety regulations for the situation and so they probably they could have filmed it in studio. So just following. I doubt it because sometimes those crowds are so big you know because it's like they're everyone. But okay maybe they don't have any of the big crowds in this one. Maybe they just have remote you know like separate studios and like separate takes. A shame because I hope they do have the people because it's one of the that's the fun aspect of that recording of the year. It's true is that the big panoramic take of the whole staff that works in the in the program. No I'm prox to all these TV networks for not stopping doing this type of stuff because you know they had a great excuse to not do it and it's prox to all of them you know it's definitely helped a lot of singers right now in the industry and stuff and because gigs have stopped concerts have stopped so. Yeah. It's pretty amazing though I love that stuff. Iqao and Liwanag at Li Gaye. Okay. It has Regina. Darren Spanto. Sarah. Sarah Hironimo. I missed a bunch. I think I see Zona as well. I don't know if the boys are there. Oh his voice though. Oh it's on a green screen. Oh he's having some. See but that's on the studio. Wonderful. I love her. I love her. I wish all right for some of that good. Holy welcome. I've made my mind up so I'm going to send a man. I'm going to gather these videos for more than a minute. Oh please don't. I don't know. I can't read it for the cringe. I think it'll be funny to maybe do a video about it. Let us know if you'd like a better. I don't want to blow in the wrong horn. It was regional TV. It wasn't anything. It's not blowing anyone's horn because it's funny to watch. I'm going to send them emails and stuff. I'm going to try and get this stuff. I think this was maybe from which year? 2017. 2017. I think the last one we did was like 2008. Yeah so and YouTube actually wasn't that large. It wasn't that big. It wasn't that big. It wasn't that big. So people TV channels didn't really thought of posting this stuff. No not at all. And we tried hard to find it but I think I'm going to have to go to the TV channel and just send them emails and stuff. Yeah okay. Find that. Oh my gosh. I'm like this big. Oh I can just imagine they hear on the outfit choices. This is amazing. I wish I was about that. Tank. I mean this is also ABS for fuck's sake. Well also no let's think of oh no why just the cannot. And this Regime Velasquez is there and it's like the huge stars. This is fantastic. This is such a great level of production. It's fantastic. I love her I love her. Oh my god. Beautiful. It is from rebel places from from their houses and stuff. Oh she's born. Her voice is gorgeous. Oh my god. She's gorgeous. Oh she's born. Her voice is gorgeous. I love that. I love that. Oh. Oh yeah.

I mean calm. I mean calm. I mean calm. I mean calm. I mean calm. I mean calm. I mean calm. I mean calm. She lived from her house where she chilled. Who is she? She's gorgeous. Well she's very pretty. I mean nice color. Oh nice color. She's so cool. One of those things. Oh it's like. Oh let's go. Turn up. Turn up. Her hair looks fantastic. She looks good with pink hair. She looks so great. I love this new fresh more reset. It's so nice. We're discussing. Can I? No. Why not? Because now. Wait. You're in love to spoil. Yeah. Fuck it. No. What's the point of you spoiling? And why would they tune in? Ah. Fuck it. Fuck it. She's also very pretty. Nice. Oh yeah. That's it. That's what I mean. That's what I mean. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. She's what. Oh yeah. I want the way. Oh hell yeah. It's amazing. That guy. Oh he's freaking awesome. I like her. Is this moana de la torre? She has such a shot. Yeah. Her shot literally literally winning. Thanks, though. Yeah. Her shot literally literally winning. Thanks, though. Thanks, though. Yeah. Yeah. So cut. Yeah. Come on. It's so cool! So no, no big shot. No big shot. Yeah, no shot together. No. What's obviously, you know? That is amazing. You know what? It must have been so hard to get everybody to record their own bit of the song. I don't know how to do that. They probably recorded it from their own houses and stuff. Or like their own studios and stuff like that. And the project, I have. Putting everything together and also the editors of this video who put everybody together and stuff. And the CBN and so on. Fantastic. What was I say? It lets you know though. It lets you know, like watching stuff for days. How many consigners we yet to find out. Oh yeah, definitely. There have been a lot of things. Basically, it's just the tip of the iceberg. I agree with that. I just want to check if Moira de la Torre was in there. Tony Gonzaga. John. Lessa Longa. What example? Yeah, Lea was the one in the... In her house. Yeah, in the Gopa School. Yeah, I don't think it was Moira de la Torre. But, uh. Janine Verden. What was the girl? Who was the girl with the blue-ish shot? What a shot, that is. She had like a whole Hollywood camera set up in her living room. Very, very, very pretty. Yeah. But the whole setup was awesome. Beautiful, beautiful stuff. This puts you in the right mood. I think this is the type of things people need right now in the world though. This type of mood. Setting you all for like reminding you that you are the light in the world. Everybody can be that bit of joy for everybody else. You know? The round you will also be happy. So I think it's all about that. What a great message. I love it. It's lovely. Is this like a big Filipino hit? Or is this... I hope it is. Or if they just make this for this. I think they made it for like the purposes of like the commercial breaks. You know how they do back home. They probably do the same. But I mean like you know how back home. They would do a remake of a popular song that everyone knew. I see what you're saying and then take that as the bass and the radio and version. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Let us know if this is... It was just a solo single. Or was this actually classic. Again, let us know what you thought about it and what we should check out next.
