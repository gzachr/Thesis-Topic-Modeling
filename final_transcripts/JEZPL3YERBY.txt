 The vibe is in the house. The bun. The bun. Thank you. You're welcome. Hello, hello. Go fix it. Come on in my friends, my ambrantag. It's a day of adventure. Not really. Adventure for us that we have no water again. You can hear a squidging noise and that's actually my feet, I think. My shoes. But you can see there's work going on today. And yesterday at the end of the road where all the water lines are. Which I cook here is a deep excavation here. Anyway, what's happening? It looks like the water guys or the council or the government or both. I do this something about the water problem here. Cookies gone to find out himself. Be careful, cookie. In yakka cookie. You can see this one here I believe is our water line. I believe this one here or one of these two is our water line. Goes along there and along the back. It comes across. And it looks like this is full of water. You can see here. There you are. You can see even more up here. Look at this. Water is just flooding out. The weather is lying that is. I don't think that's ours but you never know. When they're back, draining myself, I have a chat to them. That's exactly what's going on. There are a few comments from a few of you guys including you Paul. Thank you very much. She said about moving. I'll meet it into our property so we don't get charged. 20 water leakage. Luckily we don't as our line. Goes from our house to the main road. But sometimes you have the meter at the end of the main road. Our season, our property. So we're not getting charged for any wasted water. It's not good for the environment now of course. Never good to waste water. And obviously some points on pays. It's a bit of a nuisance for us. We do have a water pump and a water tank which works really well. But we don't like to use them always because of the electricity costs obviously. And we have such a good natural pressure here. Water pressure. It's a shame to have to use the pump all the time. It means our water pump has to come on. Has to work. And it's a shame really. It works really well. Never had a problem getting water upstairs. Even to the shower upstairs. You can just say you don't want the light. It's like my energy is on the ground. You come to a place where an image of a vice and you refuse it. No. So we're here in a cell. There's a guy with the vice bucket. So he's got the vice bucket. I'm going to have to buy some. If you choose the option, I'll come with the combo away. So you do get an image of a vice. But I think the proportion might be big enough anyway. We see how pretty I feel. It's the Jollybee Homeboy Jollybee. The way we're sitting, can I have a look? Really? I think I'm going to start with the Jollybee Population. The sweet mug in the salad is more like Nando's. Yeah, it's good. It's good. You can have next similar thing. Nando should be choosing the level of spice and this one playing up to 3C. But Nando's is really good. And this is very similar. Now the chicken is cooked. It's grilled. It's really tasty. It's a typical number. The spring hello halloween is just for you. I know, I think. And here we are. Let's see our food. So we have our filaments. filaments is a journey. And the rice is my daddy. Thank you. You're welcome. So we're going for the hot-hub. I think I have a kind of monsy. I would do. There are a par, a rice, a kind of mung bean. I don't have a mung bean for follow. Wait, I can't just... That's too smooth. So sweet, sweet and monsy. Do they chicken? That's pretty good. What about the hello halloween? Here's mix mix. There's a different things mix up with the ice cream. This is one of the reasons Loppie will come to it. It's like this hanging in the soil. It's like a hello halloween. Who will be ice cream? The rat is in the house. He must have fallen through the season somewhere. Or bittersway through. But it's in our bedroom I think. I'm always in rooms. This is a little like a little dirty situation. Yeah, you're home. You see it? Where is it? It's in your box, though. It's in the shower. It's in your shower. It's in your shower? It's in the shower. I don't know. Can we call it tome? I can't believe it. I can't believe it. The fluff is in the shower. What is it? It's just a fluff. We need to put that in and see if we go into it. You might just go into it from your shop. Mr. Fluffy! Is it recording? It's recording. The bun. Don't do the case. It's looking at her. You're not hungry now. That's my sister, you look like you're gonna come to the rat. This is the one I was in the roof. I had a big bang earlier. Is this one? You know, oh, it's a present. I'll close the door. Get the room. You can have the room in case you need to. Please! Use the room to go in there. No! I'm sorry. So, is it better to sleep? Where was it? In my bedroom. I'm going to be some more there. I'm going to be some more. I'm going to be some more. So, the rat. I see some on the floor over here. Is that a poo? Is it a rat poo? It's sort of rat. It's been in our ceiling. And it came out of the hatch. The last hatch. It might not be the only rat. There's a trouble. You get many. But we heard a big bang earlier. And that's what it was. It was coming through the loft hatch. So, uh... Who needs a cat? Just James sister-in-law. Must have. She might be an honorary cat. Who needs a cat, eh? Who needs a cat? Who's sister-in-law? I can scream in the fall. Let's loose. Woo! We're going to take the rat somewhere far away from the house to give another chance at life. We're not going to kill it, obviously. We have a special guest in the boot with the car. We have the rat. Mr. Fluffy, I call him. It's actually a female. She's bad news. Rat's normally traveling in pairs. There's almost no female. She's a female. She's a male. So, we're going to go up and see what's up there. But for now, I'm operation. We home the rat. Hello, I am Jane. You also have teetokris in the back to help us with the rat. Then, both of us are going to have a walk. We're going to have a walk. We're going to have a walk. We're going to have a walk. We're going to have a walk. We're going to have a walk. That is a very special guest with the rat. Since both of me and Adi are cowards. Oh god. I'm going to stop here, just over here. So where do you want to let it go? This side or the other side? Maybe here maybe? I think here would be better. Yeah, okay. Hopefully, it doesn't run into the car. If it's the one that's be going in the car, I might remember the smell. Run! You want to pack? There are no other ones. There he is. There he is. Where are you by? Where are you at? Where are you Mr. Fluffy? Oh my God. Alright, just make sure it doesn't come back to the car. It's just... Oh, there's really some guys. And that's gone. New life for the rat. So, outside all violent games, our water pipes here have been cut and it goes along there in the corner. They found some water there where their machines have dug it out. And what they're doing is actually burying this big blue pipe for the council. And one of our builders who actually installed the water here, he knows where the pipes go, so he's going to have a look now. He has my attack, he's going to go in there yet. Come fix it. The boat is popping up, water. Yeah, our lines go underneath the road. Our's and our neighbor. But yeah, our line is in the corner, there's a big puddle of water. It's clear that it's been pulled out by the machine or cut or something. Yeah, yesterday morning, our water pressure dropped from about 90 to zero, literally within a second. So, we're back home now. The water's fixed, everything's all good again. Water pressure is back up to its usual level. But these are some of the problems you do have in the Philippines when it comes to water. We might have said this before, but it's quite consistent. Our line has been buried, it's quite deep now, it's well protected. Hopefully, hopefully this will be the end of it now. So it's been a bit of an adventure, we've had water problems, we've had the vat. All the final living in the Philippines. We weren't exchanged just for anything. So happy to be here, so blessed, so grateful. And this will make a good bedtime story one day. Maybe to the grandchildren, to Isabella's children. You never know. We're going to have a barbecue tonight, we're going to use the blowpipe that Jane made. And it's all fun. We're part of the final living in the Philippines. Thank you very much for watching.
