 Okay, we have decided to... Oh my god! Oh my god! Good morning guys and welcome to another video. This time from Anilla and we're gonna stay here for actually a whole week and we have a lot of cool things planned for this week. Yeah, we're really excited about this. For example, we have like a meeting grid on Sunday, which is in I think already two days. Woo! Excited for it? A little nervous? Yeah, we still look at the power to meet all of you and here other than this, we actually decided to go to some more Ceren Manila. Because we had so many good things about it. Today's plan is actually to go to the Mala Vesha. Which according to all of you guys, or at least a lot of you guys, is one of the biggest ones here in Philippines. And almost in Asia actually. Almost in Asia, yeah. Not the biggest one in Asia, but at least among the top five I think. Yeah. We always get into this discussion. They're never in World, but... There's always so many discussions on our comment sections about which Mala's the biggest. So we're gonna have a look at least. Yeah. Probably it's pretty big. We're gonna have a lot more for Wai and Al. So I'm actually quite excited. We already went and see what the two Mars. And there are actually a lot of fun. There are so many things to do. Like you can play basketball, we've got ice skating there. So I'm really, really excited to see how Mala Vesha is doing. Check out those videos at least. Oh yeah. Do we have any see them already? Yeah. Check it out. Or maybe here. I don't know. You'll see. Somewhere. But yeah, we're not actually only going to check it out. Because we really need some new clothes. Yeah. I'm still looking forward. I'm honestly running around in the same clothes. Love for almost six months. Basically this is restarted. And this is a little embarrassing. So we're looking forward to get at least a tiny bit. You close. I can't afford much. But I don't think that we get some. So we are gonna go shopping. Yeah. I and that's gonna be fun. It is. And we actually, yeah. Maybe. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Hi. Guys, let's go and see you there. Guys, we reached the entrance of the Mall of Asia. And they started raining a little bit. So we're actually super happy that we're gonna spend some time inside now. It's kind of perfect. So it's closer to being inside when it's raining outside. Alright, let's head inside and see what we can find. The first impression is already really, really good. I think so many good styles here. It's amazing. And we haven't had breakfast yet. That's the first thing on the agenda. We're gonna go find some food. Yeah. We found the perfect solution for our problem. Look how good we got. How good it is. This is perfect. I love this ball already. We found a trusted friend from the SMC side mall. Fred talk. This big one is amazing. It's so good. You already found something you like? Yeah, I want this. It looks really good. So I got the rice and shine with a little egg because it is morning. It is early. So yeah, egg is always good. What did you get, Julia? I actually don't sure what I got, but something with the oven. I saw that it's actually called a coffee bowl. Really? Yeah. Oh my god, I hope I like it. But it is really soft. It looks good, man. Okay, I'm gonna try. I'm gonna try the coffee bowl. Actually think. It's like a coffee cream. Like where the almonds are in the piano. Oh, you're okay. On top. Ah. I'm not sure if anything comes inside later, but that's good. Nice. I'm generally a really, really big fan of bread talk. I think it tastes so amazing, basically everything. What I don't like is the use of plastic bags. Of course, it would be better in general to use paper bags. But there are so excited about this plastic bag. For every piece you get, you get one plastic bag, and then you get one plastic bag for everything around. But okay. So my rice and chai was a little cold, so, so far, the winner is definitely bread talk in S&C side. Because you know, not a day care. It's just bread talk anyway, so. But we're gonna go actually and look for some other food for breakfast because we're not quite filled up, but we want to try some different stuff now. I think. What do we want? I don't know. If any guys are excited, we're gonna be so much good. Exactly. Alright, let's go. Yep. We've got another bakery, so we're gonna have a little bit more food and it smells amazing. What are you gonna have? I don't know. Everything. Something. I don't know. I'm trying to hug this side. We just got some normal looking small baguette rolls. At least it's like proper bread. I'm not like super sweet, like always. It's actually like fairly crispy. So at least this is gonna be filling. So this is nice. We're all fed up, but it's time to go shopping now. Check this out. We're all fed up. We're all fed up. It's time to go shopping now. Check this out. We're all fed up. We're all fed up. We're all fed up. It's time to go shopping now. Check this out. These are the Philippines called weather picks. And we have really tiny shorts, mini skirts, and a jacket. Okay, fair enough. This is ridiculous. Samsung is having a party down there. Maybe join later. This Samsung party. It's alright. Always a good start to go to. It's quite heavy loads. So Yulia is gonna leave us now. Just to go downstairs. Bye bye Yulia. Maybe I think the camera. You're welcome. You're welcome. Bye bye. Alright, let's see how efficient the guys can actually shop. Let's do this. See any trousers. Maybe a cap. Not sure. What do you think? Maybe not for now. Alright, that was pretty efficient. Let's see what Yulia is doing. Thank you. One thing that I find really interesting. The most important thing is that the camera is not working. I'm not sure. What do you think? Maybe not for now. Alright, that was pretty efficient. Let's see what Yulia is doing. Thank you. One thing that I find really interesting. Thank you. Thank you. One thing that I find really interesting is actually that although the price levels in the Philippines are generally quite low compared to the European countries. In the malls, a lot of the clothing stores actually have prices that are pretty similar to the ones we find in Europe. So for example in the age of them. They clothes basically cost the same here as they cost back home. And the Filipino malls continues to be a mixture between a shopping mall and a amusement park. Check this out. Look what we found but the hair here is a cinema. There you can see it and there you can see which movies are coming. So nice that the cinema and the malls you don't even need to change the place. You can just immediately go. Okay, wait, wait, wait. There are no other movies. What is coming up? Oh, you want to go? It's a Jurassic World. It's a Jurassic World. To be honest, we actually continued to go to Jurassic World. Do you want to go? Yeah, I'm a Brit. I don't think we've watched that movie in a cinema in like a year or something. It's so long, yeah. So, quite nice. I think here is the go. Open your thing and nothing's over there. You can buy the tickets. Let's go check how much they cost. Oh! So, yeah, we're going to go and check out Price's Love because I'm actually really, really cute. Oh, and there's a lottery. Okay, I'm not going to play a lottery, no? It's quite cool actually. Definitely not being the only one to cinema. And that's the first with the only similar trousers that I just bought. It makes me really happy. Oh, you see it? You see it? Oh, I'm not actually left. But I'm always feeling happy with the people that have the same clothes and that I just bought. Because then I get the feeling that those clothes are beautiful. And I get a lot of people want to wear this. Hmm, really? Oh, there is the cinema actually. Oh, my God, that was wrong. I think here is the cinema. Way bigger than I thought. Look at this. Cinema. Cinema. And here is the entrance. This looks amazing. I really, really want to go. I hope it's not too expensive. Did you find Price's? Yeah, it's 290 pesos per person. How much is this? I find 5 dollars. Really? It's pretty good. In our way tickets prices will be minimum 15 dollars. Okay, guys. I'm going to see a cinema. Do you want to go? Yeah, sure. Just a bit. Maybe later. Let's have a look at the overview. So maybe we actually go tonight, brother. I mean, if you go at 330, it's in 12. Okay, so we have a gunner just because when we go, we're in between 330 and tonight. But we're definitely going to go. It's crazy. It looks amazing. Yeah, he and Sazis Aisha, we're actually always like, rather explore. We're new cities, but we actually have a V here in Manila. And we're already here to cinema. What does that just go? Especially if it's a really one with a new Jessica. Okay, we have to start it. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. No, this is my dream. This is your dream. This is my dream. This is amazing. And here. Wow. I've to admit, I'm kind of drawn to the thing one. In any case, it's really cool. I can't actually wait to have kids on my own. So I can just pretend that I go and play with them. And then I can finally go. I have to excuse proficiently just to enter this jumping. What is a jumping house? What's the movie? I don't know how it's called, but. It's sad that it's socially unacceptable for us to go in there. I know. It's like, if you would have a kid with you, then it's okay. You know, you can just go, but. Now it seems weird if we go. But okay. We have decided to leave this cinema behind for now, because we actually want to finish our exploration first. And we really, really want to go to the entertainment more than here. Sounds kind of good, doesn't it? So yeah, we want to check this out first. Then we're going to enter the hotel and see us a little. Then we're going to eat properly a little. And then we're going to head to the cinema. So it's definitely cinema for us today. So we went outside now to try to find entertainment more, or it's called kind of. And outside it actually seems like there are a lot of food stores here where you can go. And look at this view. You can actually see the sea, the ocean. It's more beautiful than I thought. Yeah, actually don't think that the camera can capture it. So maybe I can't see it. Look what we found. This part is becoming more and more like a problem used in the first place. But all the things seem to be for kids. This is so sad. Oh, I found another cool thing. Look at those things. I think you can rent them. There's a problem here. I'm not even sure I fit it. Not anymore. I put a little bit of weight here in the Philippines. The back of me is a way too good. So I actually just wanted to show you here the sea. We really, really nice for the view. But look what I found. There is a big one for big people. So we decided to actually have some food before we go to the cinema. Yeah, you had to ride even more food. It seems like we just jumped from one food list to another. But you actually have some like this thing. Kind of, but it has been a few hours actually. It's been in more food. And Buddha was quite hungry. But here actually so, so many food places. It's crazy. So many restaurants. But we just had time to check the food cart. So we decided we tried to check on the food cart here. Are you excited? We said food. I'm excited for the food cart. I'm actually quite full. But okay. Look what they have. They apparently have ice skating here as well. We already went ice skating in Siu actually in the mall. What's the lot of fun? It's really embarrassing. But what's the lot of fun? You can check out the video here. We're here. And I'm going to put some time to the camera. Yeah. So I don't think that we're going to go ice skating today. But... What's the coolest stuff you're looking for? What is it? It's actually what it is. Ah, it's for kids. I saw another stuff like a... Labyrinth playground. So you can climb through things. Being a kid in Manila has to be amazing. I want this thing, but as my parents every weekend to go to the mall. That's so much stuff here for kids. They have a tiny town. Looks really pretty cool. Ah, then you can have your go. And flower shop. A post office. Oh my god. I would have loved this as a kid. Kids in the Philippines. Really, really lucky. I understand that there was so heavy all the time. Okay, now I lost video. Big is so hungry. He's just running to the next food court. But don't even know where it is. Or realizing that he lost his feet. I see him. Yeah, yeah, he is. Fixing me up. We don't want the air to stick out. They always do though. Can you always do this? What is this? They have a bar paradise here. This is so cool. Oh, but I also saw here inside the Labyrinth. And they're like slides. This kid's Labyrinth is so cool. I love those Labyrinthes kids, but I think I was just one to one. Because we don't have such thing in the mall already. So they actually do have an ice skating area here as well. And it looks like a lot of fun. But what I like better in SMCBosybside is that you can actually properly watch the people ice skating. Even if you don't pay attention to go ice skating yourself. It's of course way more fun for the people that pass by. And let's be honest, for the people that ice skate, it's actually way better than that many people watching. So I think I would have liked better to go ice skating here than in SMCBosybside. Because it was embarrassing. So if you're spending a whole day here and yeah, it's a lot of walking around. You might get really tired. If you'd eventually just break down because of exhaustion. Don't worry. Don't worry. Because they have a medical clinic in here. It's so cool. I really wonder when they don't have. They have everything. Absolutely everything. I dare you do like right in the comments and find one thing they don't have here. They dare you. It's like she's so nice. It's like at home and you want something here. Please have to drive to the whole city. And here you can basically find everything at one place. Cyber city, entertainment, ice skating, food, medical care, pharmacies, whatever you want. It's honestly amazing. I like it. But we're getting hungry. We are starting to find food, tea place. I'm sure what I'm saying is good. I didn't get so much food but we were looking for food called. So we decided to go to Jolibi. We're not planning this. So this is an easy way out as well. Chicken, spaghetti, coke, fries, good times. I also won. I also won. Yeah, hey. They even have a bowling center here. But we decided to action not go bowling now because it's a cinema time. I hope it's in English. Oh, yeah, surely. I would think so. Oh my god, it would play in English. I just started to talk about it. Oh my god, it's nice. It's in English. It's in English. Or maybe sometimes at least. All right, it's success. We got two tickets for the Jurassic World at 3.30. What time is it now? 4.30. 4.30. So we have 45 minutes. We actually, it's like first come first serve in terms of the seat. Couldn't select yourself. Shreens. At 3.30, we're going to be ready and we're running to the hall to get the best seats. Yeah, that's only 15 minutes. We can wait that long. Oh my god, they're already waiting in line there. Maybe she'll hurry. Well, okay, maybe we'll be back with the first ones. Oh, man. Oh my god. Look at this. Look at this. It's huge. It's huge. What are guests and keep your children from becoming and really inside this cinema? Only when necessary. Please leave them outside until they calm down. That was good value for money. There was a lot of fun for two hours. So, we haven't seen since we've been to the movies. Actually, it's pretty nice. Yeah, it is. It is really cozy. Kind of. It's cozy. Jurassic World. I will recommend that movie, guys. So, if you haven't checked it out, go see it. You just feel like bringing your girlfriend, bringing a friend, bringing a family. Go to the cinema. It's actually nice. Really, really nice. Just a little corner side. So, I've let up my... I don't know, I'm so wrong. It's so wrong. It's so wrong. Hi, guys. But it's time for us to go back to reality. And... Yeah, I think we got to move on from the mall. So, if you liked the video, give us a thumbs up. And subscribe to our channel. And, yeah, the journey has been a little bit like for us. What up, guys. Welcome back. Welcome back. It's a new... Hey, guys. Are you still in the middle? Hey, guys. Get ready. This time from Manila. Can't you remember? Yeah. Hello and good morning. This time from Manila. Okay, see you. Bye.
