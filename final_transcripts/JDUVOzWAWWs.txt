 So just like that, we had a bit of rain, some thunderstorms, had to abandon half of the cinema's to our garden. But we have some sweet potato to cook, our own sweet potato we're going to cook tonight. So we come today to our Ommock Market to buy our usual wiki shop and to give you an idea of the prices here compared to the supermarkets. So we're going to go first and get some vegetables and fruit showing. Yeah, we're going to our food. So we're going to go try usual, our soup key. So soup key. So soup key. Not our soup key. TƒÅ. Or soup key. The best soup key. But our soup key. So our regular here in Ommock Market, for fruit, for our food to be, anyway. I think Ommock is doing some fun. Mango. Our food, the apples. Our food, the apples. Yeah, I want to get some of maybe five mandarin. They got mango. Mango. So it's going to be five mandarin. Before our food, we'll get pieces. Yeah. And because you're so kids, we have 100 per 11 pieces to fill. There's lots there. I've got water melon this week. Water melon. Big pineapple too. Lemon, mandarin. More cotton. Mango. And mango. So this is Ommock Market. For a lot of schools here. For a lot of fellows. And I can shop around. Quite a good berry. It's a six year regular, six year soup key. And you get a good deal. You know, a good honest bite. Shall we have a banana? She's in Luna. Yeah. So she's a... So she's a... So our soup key is on the evil, almost. In Luna. We've got some green mango here. We've got some lucky chambananas, the apples. Today's a hundred dollar mango. Oh my god, mango for 100. Going to get the mango. So there's lots of rice here. Lots of salads, lots of options. Every bite is coming on. Where it's from. How well it is. Prices do go. And you're going to get some mango. So this is the one market. There's lots of buildings there. In sections. So now we've stopped at the side of the road. This is an agro-vict place. They sell lots of chicken feet, big feed. But also dog food. We find that a dog food here is good quality. And it's actually cheaper than it is in the soup markets. This is Kogon, the normal city. There's lots of agro-vict places here. But we get dog food here as well. The boys like it. They like those crunches. Jaina and myself go shopping once a week. We tend to go to the market. Then the soup market for what we can't get out of the market. Places do vary. We buy wheat, given in the soup markets. And we'll show you some of the places in the soup market we go to. There are a few here in all markets. We have a lot of food here.

My turn. My turn. Good afternoon. My turn. My turn. My turn. My turn. It's good afternoon. My turn. My turn. My turn. My turn. I know you're having your hair cut too. It'd be over soon. Do I just do this? It's not going to kill him. Is that a real party, though? There's somewhere in Luna, there's a broken line, so we have a brain out here. How are these things to do happen? Just means we get to use our dirty kitchen, even more. Spend some time outside. To be honest, we've spent quite a lot of time outside at the moment, having weather change. We didn't always notice when... Dark skies, dark clouds. That's in light clouds and we have this amazing patch of blue sky in the middle of it all. The rainbow pass. Stormable pass. So now we're going to try our first commotive, my garden. Nice, very nice. It's a purpley colour this one, but it's very white inside. Very soft when it's cooked. You have to grow more of this. It's good for your health. It tastes great. Lots of fiber. It's very nice. It makes a change from mice. It's so hard. Ah, this one is a different colour, she'll wash. That's why I have to let this more. How is it? It's really nice. It's a bit sweet, but not so sweet. It's just white. It's like a white English potato. But it's just nice.
