 But you're Friday. The freshest. Ah! Okay, so we watched the Philippine Madrigal singers like... The singing is Madrigal? Madrigal? Madrigal singers? They're... What do you call it? The nickname is Mads. Oh, wow, cool. Because there was a bit Mad, not gonna lie. They're pretty crazy. Pretty crazy vocalist. But we watched them singing in Spanish a few weeks back. And this is the most requested after Spanish. Yeah, they were singing in Spanish. They sang it in Chile in like a... Oh yeah, you're right. Sorry apologies. But yeah, this is the circle of life, which is a crazy song and it's arrangement itself. You're actually sung this actually? Yes. But the solo version and not the choral score. Faster overhearing, like a choral arrangement. Yeah, it's amazing. We'll even rep pigress on the slate. What about the extremely composed... What about the frieroid engine? Oh, it's pretty big. Wow, the Titanic part. Martha's next song. Recognize how we slate it. The tone war jed cw the no this wasn't pretty What? What? No. Do you imagine the first people to replicate some of an elk? No. I reckon they could. If I was going to put my bet on anyone, it tried search up on YouTube. Ah! The sound of an elk, right? And then try and replicate it. I mean, I do apologize for your neighbors or anyone close to you because their eardrums will never be the same. However, if you are able to do a do-same-it-video, but if I was going to add the exact amount of... You're going to be like a crazy person. Because I'm not going to believe it. Okay, so, F-Rat. So if anyone's going to be able to replicate some of an elk, it's probably going to replicate some of an elephant snake. Probably a baboon. Like a pig. What's the name of that animal that sings a wing my way? No, I'm not a wing my way. How come it's a tata? A bull. A bull, you know, wild bull. A mere cat. A mere cat. Makeup.com. Perfect plug. There were no sponsor by any way right now. It's also a gold compact. Oh, gold different. Compare as a website to find out which insurance is best for you. I used to learn nobody's Spanish the same way. I'm going to do a bucket hat.com. Go bucket. Figure out which bucket is best for your head. Never buy a bucket. Two big or two small for your head. Sort it out. I'd go bucket.com. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Look, mate. Dorses and animals that I haven't even found in my life. But I know they're roots. I'm bad for you. I'm bad for you. You can never wait for me. I'm bad for you. I'm bad for you. I'm bad for you. I'm bad for you. I'm bad for you. Oh, shit. What in the... Tura Fula, I'm actually in the set of Lion King. It's so weird. There is more. There is more. Oh, that guy sings amazing. What vocal technique do you utilize? I don't know. I don't know anything anymore. How about a text book? What does a text book say? That you're born with it. Or you aren't asked. Sort of just genetics or thing. A lot of genetics come to play when people do it. With male voices, how deep, how far? That definitely goes down to genetics. And natural predisposition. Any exercise or anything like that? You can sing very deep. Yeah, definitely. You can work a lot on your lower range. And try making it a go lower without making it darker. Which is quite a task. Because you would have to combine a bit of your natural twang. Or if you don't have any twang in your speech quality to find that twang. To bring it back down to the lowest and the most resonant of your range. It's actually quite a different, difficult technique. But I can hear... Just be telling me about how big your atoms speech? No. Your atoms speech. No. I think it's natural predisposition. Some men are born after the heat puberty. They're a larynx drop further down than the average men. And then you can obviously take advantage of that as a singer for sure. But obviously exercising the flexibility of the larynx after that has happened can... It stays there. Like... Again, you can exercise your larynx to go higher. I have the feeling that this vocalist in particular can do... There's a guy in there. I think is this guy over here. Can I see your mouse? Yeah, they can see my mouse. This guy over here. I think this is the main vocalist. But the chorus work of creating the atmosphere and replicating the animal sounds. I think this is very magical. I don't know where it is. I have no idea. But there's certainly some figures. It's some pretty freaking crazy display of vocal capabilities for sure. They really tell it to respawn at you too. I saw where it is. Yeah, to the movies of pre-fringed nuts. Oh, my God! Jesus! Papabú is getting fucked up! Oh, I don't know what that means. Oh, my God! Jesus! Papabú is getting fucked up! Oh, my God! Jesus! Papabú is getting fucked up! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Jesus! Oh, my God! Jesus! Oh, my God! Jesus! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh my God! WHAT? delivers delivers delivers delivers What? Where's your credit card? Where's mine? Yeah, we have my mortgage. What? Dude, what the fuck? That's crazy. My brain doesn't really comprehend. You know, it was an interesting thing to do. It's a funer. So, throughout millennia, right? When we were interacting with animals, we must have had the necessity to learn how to replicate their sounds. Right, because we needed to hunt, to survive. Not... I wouldn't be here. You need a wood you. It's an important conversation. So, I wonder what happened. You know, why can I... Why are they able to do that? You know, like, is the human... Are the humans... What is it? Larynx? Really that... Obviously, they are, as evidence. But, that able to replicate any sound. Not any, right? But, most sounds that we see in nature. Most likely... Is that how we came to sing it? I think so. Did we see animals do it first? Yeah, I think... Yeah, I know music history. And I know a little bit. But... Yes. Give me the answer. Whoa! Yeah, no, I think it is. It came... Music came from... A little help you hear, but I don't want to ruin your topic. Because this Fitch Friday mentioned us. Okay, so you can get it down in the link in the description below. The music came from trying to replicate... It looks so funny. Anyways, yeah, no one else would like to see it. No, no, no, apologies, I didn't mean it, all right? Music came from... Please, don't beat me off camera. Oh my god! Am I, you know, am I start after this? It was beautiful and so... No, no, no, no. What if the child is still being screwed? Go for it! No, no, no, no, no, no!
