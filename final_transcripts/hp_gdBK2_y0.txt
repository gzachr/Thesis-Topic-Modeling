so today's video I'm here with Alex from uh Alex 
has a channel on YouTube it's called living abroad  
and he's here in Cebu like me and when I came to 
Cebu I saw some of his videos and I reached out  
to him and we've met up once before so we're gonna 
kind of do like his style on his channel he kind  
of Dos interviews and interviews uh foreigners 
and Filipinas and Filipinos and just kind of  
gets everybody's point of view on everything right 
that's right exactly so I have a variety of just  
Street interviews with random people and also I 
do one-on-one interviews with certain like you  
know individuals as well I've been here for how 
long now just over five months now so I've been  
here for over five months yeah right on and then 
out so what would you say is the your favorite  
thing about Philippines so far you know I think at 
this point it might be cliche or if you guys have  
seen my other videos I must have mentioned like 
a hundred times but it's definitely the people  
here I love the Filipino people everybody's 
always like happy and smiling it doesn't seem  
like they have an agenda when they try to help me 
and people are just really really super friendly  
and helpful right so I lost my wallet a couple 
times and returned it with nothing missing like  
oh they returned they returned it with everything 
intact you know and I try to give them a reward  
they just keep saying no but I insisted so I have 
to like force it upon them uh when I got uh it's  
like lost in a different like City when I can't 
remember where I was they helped me they put me  
the back of the bike they drove me to my place my 
old stuff the people super friendly here so yeah  
I know so what would you say We'll flip that real 
quick what's one of your least favorite things so  
far so this is probably uh yeah it's the heat 
man like you know it is hot it's very hot you  
know he's got a tissue I got a napkin of course 
it's a great thing in some ways obviously if I'm  
coming from Canada I want to enjoy the weather 
but aside from that um maybe lack of I don't know  
man honestly okay another thing is like the roads 
some of them are they're really like thin and it  
takes a long time to get somewhere bumpy and like 
a lot of swerves it took like six hours to get to  
uh Dumaguete for example it's only 167 kilometers 
so six hours yeah because you take a four hour bus  
ride then a ferry then get off the bus again so I 
mean it's not the Philippines fault they're still  
developing country and so hopefully in time that's 
going to improve so yeah yeah the roads are kind  
of rough here I'm not gonna lie for sure so you've 
been uh here for five months you rented a condo  
right yeah I rented a condo I got lucky because 
I joined like this is a tip for you guys if you  
want to come to the Philippines you want to find 
a good deal go on to these Facebook groups right  
there's a lot of them so join the ones that have 
the most like you know obviously uh people in it  
so I got to a group and I just set the message 
saying I'm looking for a one bedroom or a studio  
air conditioning pool gym and people just kept 
me sending me the offers right and I kind of  
negotiated got myself a condo that way yeah you're 
paying how much for your economy I'm paying about  
20 000 pesos right so about 400 less than 400 USD 
and um it's got everything gym full everything  
I need yeah it's nice too yeah and it's a great 
place right across it Park which a lot of younger  
people it's like a University campus everybody's 
just walking around everybody speaks English a lot  
of younger people so I love it there yeah right 
now so what would you say obviously you've been  
have you been dating here in the Philippines yeah 
I've been seeing some girls you know since I've  
been here for like five months and honestly if 
you guys are single even if you're not single I'm  
gonna say whatever if you want to meet I'm not 
promoting adultery but my point is if you want  
to meet women here it's probably one of the most 
easiest countries that we meet women I'll tell you  
why as number one English right you think it's 
the easiest so far for me from all the country  
I've been to is the easiest because of a couple 
things because the people are so friendly they're  
really open to talking to you right so when you 
talk to them they're open to talking to you and  
obviously when you break the ice everything is 
just much easier and they speak English which  
is fantastic and I think culturally they're open 
to foreigners here you know they love foreigners  
they're really influenced by the West so yeah I 
think it's really easy to meet people here yeah  
no that's for sure they are so you what would you 
say real quick then what would you say the second  
is like would you say is Thailand the second I 
would say Thailand yeah as well Thailand's another  
country where a lot of westerners go for women or 
just like you know seeing the beautiful country  
and over there they're a little bit shy about 
their English but they're really friendly as well  
like the Thai girls are lovely they're caring and 
yeah definitely yeah for sure so um do you plan  
on getting married I mean not right now I'll be 
honest but if I at some point in the future just  
because I know myself and I don't want to commit 
to something half-assed if I was in the mirrors I  
don't think I could commit 100 not just with like 
yeah not just with women or whatever but like my  
lifestyle I don't know what I'm doing where I'm 
going yeah and I think marriage requires a little  
bit more stability than what I have going on in 
my life right now what was one of your favorite  
videos so far that you've done that's a great 
question man you know my favorite type of videos  
is anything to do with people or some new thing 
I've never experienced so for me I just one day  
randomly walk into like a barangay a neighborhood 
because a bunch of kids were playing basketball so  
I'm like all right I just walked in there with 
my GoPro on and I wasn't sure how they're gonna  
receive me yeah so like in my neighborhood when 
I was growing up some random person walked around  
the court you get like your ass kicked and get off 
the court right but these guys are all like really  
friendly and happy and welcoming and I gave them 
a challenge I'm like okay let's do a one-on-one  
game with your best basketball player if I win 
you have to give me 10 subscribers if you win  
really so it was pretty fun so we had a couple 
games they're super friendly we had a lot of fun  
they're playing bare feet so I took my shoes off 
I got blisters it was a really fun video yeah wow  
yeah they do that here dude they wear barefoot 
sandals I mean they have like they'll be in the  
construction sites for sandals I mean it's it's 
pretty intense sometimes for sure so what's one of  
your favorite places in Cebu that's another great 
question in Cebu itself I'll be honest one of my  
favorite places is Sugo Mercado which is a night 
market yeah an I.T Park yeah this is sweet it's  
nice because you get a like a really chill Vibe 
you can go there every night I go there whenever  
it's open Wednesday to Sunday and you can get 
yourself a different variety of like Filipino food  
foreign food any kind of food you want and you can 
just basically have a picnic there so if you're  
going with a friend or by yourself that's one of 
my favorite places in Cebu itself yeah I just went  
there the other night actually bro and that place 
is weird it just had this good vibe about it it  
was nice and it was like it seems like there's 
a lot of growth there you know and like these  
people it's like a lot of younger people there and 
there's just like a lot of the economy is really  
building here yeah for sure so what about like on 
the city like what's your favorite city in Cebu  
you say or one of the places you visited on the 
island yeah for me I think Mala Pasco was one of  
my favorite oh you went there I went to Mile High 
School and I was like kind of Blown Away with how  
amazing the beaches were that was huge it's called 
North Beach I think like like massive Beach white  
sand and nobody was on there except for myself and 
uh palm and I it was just her and I and we like  
basically went swimming snorkeling everything and 
it was not a soul around and Mal Pasco has a place  
where you can go uh diving with thresher sharks 
so I think that those yeah they got those there  
so scuba diving is huge and they had like a big 
expat Community there so I met with a nice Italian  
guy some Spanish guys they have a nice Italian 
restaurant it was really cool so I love malpascua  
that's cool yeah they got it's like world-class 
diving there right for sure yeah I think it's one  
of the only places where you could see thresher 
sharks when you go diving they're saying it's  
crazy so do you have any tips maybe to some some 
Corners that are going to come here on vacation  
let's just say vacation let's say they're coming 
on vacation you got a couple pointers maybe that  
stand out sure yeah for me number one I always 
carry like a cloth or some sort of napkin yeah  
even if you're coming from a warm place of your 
country over here the humid humidity is a little  
bit you know different so cure cloth and I say 
just to come with an open mind because things are  
not going to run the way they run in your country 
yeah so there's gonna be things going to be out of  
order out of service you may go to a place where 
it's supposed to be something happening but it's  
not happening don't watch the Google timeline 
it may not yeah in reality but so if you come  
here with like a closed mind and just expecting 
everything to be smooth and comfy they're going  
to have a very disappointing trip so keep an open 
mind adapt it's not a big deal if you're out of  
like Coca-Cola just settle for sprite you know 
yeah and they're not going to care they're not  
gonna care at all for sure and you're gonna look 
like a fool honestly and they're as far as their  
culture and you're gonna look spoiled right like 
yeah man you're on vacation you can't be so you  
know serious yeah for sure and let me say real 
quick too because yesterday I was actually going  
to go to seeking [ __ ] and um so I drove down to 
the bus terminal where the bus yard is and it was  
it took me like an hour total I got there the bus 
was full even if it wasn't full I would have had  
to make a reservation and then go to the to the 
bus station and then pay so it was it was like  
an hour and a half ordeal if it was in a car it 
would have been a couple hours so that's just a  
perfect example of yeah you just kind of got to 
be patient and some things may not make sense to  
you but it makes sense to them like if you're 
paying with a credit card for example not only  
are they scan and they give you a receipt then 
they write down the number like individual into  
the system then they make it like there's a four 
or five different steps yeah so if you're gonna  
get caught up in those little things you're gonna 
you know not enjoy your time so let go of those  
like negative you know thoughts for sure yeah 100 
so what about someone who's thinking about moving  
here but you got to get a couple pointers for them 
for me it would be to maybe spend a few weeks or  
whatever in different areas right see which one 
actually suits you in your lifestyle and because  
when you come here you may be overwhelmed with 
the the kindness of people if you're getting to  
a relationship don't just jump into one you know 
kind of like shop around with everything don't  
commit to something I wouldn't say just getting a 
year-long lease negotiating that like for myself  
I did it month to month like even if you have to 
pay a little bit more it's going to be definitely  
worth it in the long run so stay away from long 
leases and all that or commitment to a place for a  
long time to shop around a bit with relationships 
with your housing with anything you do here yeah  
just explore a bit before committing to something 
yeah yeah and I mean I I got to say this too I  
will say I used I would recommend people try 
to come as long as they can initially for sure  
because it's you know it's all Rosy and cool for 
the first month or two and then after a while you  
kind of realize you'll find out whether or not 
you want to live here yeah seriously it's not  
for everybody to be honest like there's certain 
things you may not be able to handle like like  
so you might see poverty and if that's too much 
for you if you're too emotional person you know  
some people are asking for money or some really 
really underdeveloped areas so you know that may  
be something you cannot handle for example if you 
are used to having everything done on time it's  
not going to be a place for you things are going 
to take a lot longer here and you know just to get  
things like that so it may not be for you but like 
you said said come here for a long time so you can  
get the best idea yeah yeah so so let's let's turn 
around a little bit now so what's what's one of  
your favorite things about Filipino girls here I 
think Filipino girls um I think they're a little  
bit the way I see it they're just caring people 
like they treat you like a man as a partner they  
don't like sometimes Western women it's always 
like competition and an argument relationship  
there's always like two strong-headed people 
for myself I'm like I'm really like honestly  
aggressive but I'm really like what's opinionated 
that's the thing so that Western girls are like  
honest yeah and over here sometimes they let you 
you know get out of your system I feel like the  
people you know kind of interact if I get upset 
about something then I calm down in five minutes  
then we're back to normal so over here people 
I just think they're a little bit more I don't  
know what it is but this I think they they have 
gender roles a little bit more like old school  
times which suits My Lifestyle because I'm really 
like I don't know I'm not a guy that has patience  
sometimes I get angry quick I'll be honest so for 
me girls here are gonna put up with that a little  
bit more I think than the West so so what would 
you say what's a couple of pointers you'd give to  
guys that are coming here to to date let's just 
say serious dating like yeah for serious dating  
of course there's gonna be some red flag bags 
and watch out for those that could be anything  
from someone this is going to be obvious and not 
everybody does this but if someone asks you for  
money almost immediately that's the red flag to 
me it sounds obvious but you know you might be  
into the girl maybe okay I'll give her a little 
bit money now a little bit later so and also just  
like I mentioned earlier see a few girls like 
don't just settle for the first one that's nice  
to you right because you know yeah after a week 
or so maybe they change a little bit or they want  
something so I say online dating is great right 
now you know be very honest with these girls don't  
sell them lies don't mislead them and you'll be 
surprised how many people are actually interested  
in you if you're honest with them yeah 100 yeah 
and I will say real quick too that if a lot of  
girls are obviously looking for serious I would 
say low star and if if you're if you're genuinely  
looking for a serious relationship I would put 
that in the Forefront because it's really going  
to make you a lot more appealing and girls there's 
a lot of foreigners that come and just mess around  
so if a girl thinks you're serious you'll 
probably get better quality in that sense I  
think for sure definitely and that's the other 
thing right it's a quality over quantity yeah  
there's a lot of women out there you might get 
a lot of messages inbox but you know just be be  
a little bit careful and they can vet them a 
little bit before committing to anything yeah  
so unfortunately at the end there the camera died 
but Alex is a cool dude go check out his channel  
living abroad he has tons of great interviews he 
does a really good job of interviewing foreigners  
uh Filipinos and kind of gets everybody's opinions 
on dating on Lifestyle on you know cost of living  
and and it does the whole gamut so hope you 
enjoyed that video it was a little bit different  
of a video I went to the beach today I'm looking 
super burned right now I gotta figure something  
out about this but I hope you enjoyed this video 
thank you for watching and we'll see you next time
