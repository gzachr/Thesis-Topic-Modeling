I go for a day. people might be confused. there's two Sean. my other nickname is angel baby. angel baby. angel baby. that's because of TikTok. the fans really made TikToks about me. they used the angel baby. they really just they conjured up and just picked on it. and that's it. I am from the Philippines, many in Manila. and I am going to Korea for an in 2008. you're going to Korea for an in 2008? I think the strength of my personality is that I am always trying to look for positive vibes. you know, I don't want to be down or I don't want the environment that I'm in. down. I try my best to try to live enough the vibes. and try to make everyone laugh and just try to make everything seem like. I think there's a lot of people here. and my face, I think the eyes too. the eyes, most people say that I look Chinese or Korean. I think that's the way I look. I think I'm Korean. I thought I was Korean. I thought I was Japanese. I can't just say. I'm really trying to be a Korean. Oh. Thank you. Take a key wish. I really try to, I'm just a really smiley guy. I don't, I tend to have like a resting. RBF, what you call it, are resting be-faced. but you know, try to smile more so that I can look more approachable and not look like a minister's side. The first Korean word I learned is Adnyongaseyo and Gakseongda. I've been trying to learn a lot of new words. like Miyeon-ne. and also Jiyeon-ne. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. Let's go. Let's go. Yeah, yeah. I know. It's faster. Put, I forgot that. The meaning of my uniform number is, well, I try, it's my uniform number is 77. Because I couldn't pay any income. I wanted to pay for 10. Because that's my number. The Philippines, but I think it's got 77. You know, my idol is Lupa. I know. And it starts to fun number 77. It just looks like 11. But the first fool that I ate in Korea is something else. It's much better. I always eat something in the Philippines. And it's just different. It's a different B-stion. Korea is much more different. The meat is just more savory and much better quality. It's really delicious. And it's just very good. What I like as much as I like basketball is, I'm going to have to say, I like playing the new games. Especially in quarantine, I'm going to have to be a bit shy. I always play each and every day. Because I couldn't do anything else. And I'm going to have to say, also, I like spending time with my friends as well. So sadly, they're a thousand miles away. They're like games. I don't know if Jimin is from BTS, but they love Jimin. So I think my sisters would have a better answer than me at this. But I saw it. My favorite Korean pop star ever since I was a child. I think it's a very bright song. I really don't know what to say. There are so many people. I'm a favorite K-Jama. I don't watch K-Jama, but I watch a lot of Korean movies. I saw that there was an old boy. I like the dark dark ones. It's just a Korean movie. It's just different from other kind of American movies. A Filipino movie is different. Korean movies are just way more intense. And they have such great stories, honestly. What I want to do on my day off is probably go around Suwon. I also want to go to Seoul. I'm in Suwon. I'm in a lot of trouble. I want to do it. I can do it. I can do it. I want to go to the top. I want to go to the top. I want to go to the top. It's a good loving guy. I can see a lot of Filipino movies. It's a crazy one. It's great. It's great loving guy. My goal for this season is hopefully to help the team win more games. Hopefully, get a championship. I just want to help out my teammates however I can. It's a great player under the coaches. This will be a great team. All the supporters of KT and the supporters of me, I just want to say thank you so much for your support. I couldn't be here without you guys. I just feel all you support and all your love all the way here from Korea. Also to my Kabbalah Bians in the Philippines. I hope to see you guys soon. It's really cold out here so I missed the hot weather. That's right. I heard it's going to be a bit warmer here. We don't have winter, but we don't have that cold weather. Thank you all so much for your support. Good job, I love you. I'm a good boy. I thought you were a Korean. It's so fun to be in a good mood. I'm listening to it, right? It's so fun. It's so cute. I heard that you guys have a lot of fun. It's true. It's really fun to meet you guys. But now I have a big fried egg with my whole body. My body suddenly became slack aging. My body hasn't effects until now. I thought I was in a really soft, different situation. I thought the story would be different. I was upset and I didn't mean to have to write a story. I also think it's a出来. It's a punk, right? It's just a person. Wow. Wow. 다른 선수보다 팔 투기 훨씬 더 그신 것 같아. 다르게 보인다. 너무 좋아. 이거는 필리핀에서 했던 그런 것보다. 너무 잘하는 선수보다 한 곡 가지고 와가지고. 몸성도 막 동작도 너무 잘하는 선수보다. 경기할 때 다른 선수보다. 표정이 완전 달라. 인트리할 때 되게 순... 되게 오래. 체육대회를 구경하면 가행이네. 역시 운동하는 남자 최고. 퇴근길 영상. 바빠도 이렇게 퇴근하니까 갑자기 손해졌어. 팔 투기 가르지나 이거 손해지는 것 같아. 사랑해요. 아 팬 휴대폰으로 사진 찍어줬어. 괜찮겠어. 최고다. 굉장히 좋았어. 그냥 얼굴 봤을 때 되게 친근한 느낌 느꼈었는데 또 경기하는 모습 보니까 완전 다른 매력이 있는 것 같아. 맞아요. 이게 경기 보기 아무래도 이렇게 날씨에 들어간 팔투기 드러나니까 팔투기 있고 보이고 안 보이고 느낌이 다른 것 같아요. 그냥 인터뷰의 버스네들한. 네. 너와들한 살감 많이 끄덤. 네. 퇴근길이랑은 또 다른. 한국 여자들의 이상형이라고 할 수 있지 않을까. 구독 좋아요. 댓글과 알림설정까지 안녕!
