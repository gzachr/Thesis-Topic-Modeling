 Fedger City! Privacy going up jump, Covered a ill-carry few 450k grams of diedÙ‚ motorcyclewang the We came up to immigration yesterday, but Because they have this thing where if you're not there by two o'clock, which I don't know, it just recently changed. If you're not there about two o'clock, and you don't have your paperwork in, you have to come back the next day. So, yeah, it can take three hours, which I think it could be the same time, but hey, I'm not going to judge anybody's process. One thing though, they just stop charging the express fee, which I think was a thousand. So, yeah, that's kind of cool. You'll be all right if you're there before two, so just make sure you're there before two o'clock, and you got your paperwork in, so you don't have to come back the next day. Luckily me, I live five train stops here, and I live from here on LLT. So, it's not that bad. Train is only, it was actually 16 pesos, okay? Yeah. Train is only 16 pesos to get here. So, that's not bad. 16 here, 16 back, much faster than a gymni. A gymni is 16, too. No 12. A gymni, a gymni is 12 to get here, but it's continuing stops to train. You get here in 20 minutes from where I live, so. Why do you need to deal with face-to-face? Oh, yeah, you got to deal with the face-to-face. As you know, I mean, in case you old you before, but you want to, that's how you got to stand with a whole bunch of men on a train face-to-face, because it's so packed. But what I do is I usually push my way through, because nobody got time for that. Because in the middle there's a lot of space. That's not a lot of distance from space. No, there's a lot compared to, it's like people are scared of moving on a train. But, uh... They're not scared they're just lazy moving in the middle. Yeah, they don't want to move in the middle, so. You better push away from them. You better be because they're going out soon, like, maybe two stops on this, or they decided that. Yeah, that's usually not the case though, because I've seen people standing by the door for, like, probably ten rides before us. But, uh... Yeah, we almost there. We almost set a migration. It's about a three-minute walk from where we are. So, like I said before, um, make sure... You just take that walk. You know, get the seat of the area, okay? Yeah, huh? Because it's not far. Yeah. Yeah. Just go down in central station. It's central station. You'll be all right. Because I used to come by Carrietta, and that's a walk. But from over here, it's not bad. We're here now.
