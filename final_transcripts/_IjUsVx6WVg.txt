 If I fall, you have to cut it. You have to cut it. That's the rule. I'm going to do it. Everybody's staring at me and I don't know why. You just added another foot to yourself. I know. I'm tolerant of you now by far. Hello, hello, and apparently, Merry Christmas. 40 days till Christmas. You know, in the Philippines, they celebrate Christmas as early as September. That is absolutely crazy to a Canadian's where we celebrate. But thanksgiving. Right, we could do Thanksgiving. Then we do Halloween. And then finally, right after Halloween, people think it's okay to put out your Christmas decorations and start celebrating Christmas. So it's unusual for us and pretty darn cool because who doesn't love Christmas? I got to love Christmas. Yeah. And so, yeah, we're down here at the SM Mall right now. And they've got all the Christmas decorations. There's a huge Christmas tree here. I'm excited to go look at it. I love the aesthetic of Christmas. So come with us on our little adventure to our very first Christmas in the Philippines. Here we go. Let's go. All right. It's going to look much better when it's all lit up later tonight. But we wanted to get in here early, do a few things while we're here. But you can see the Christmas decorations are out good. I hear somebody live singing. Let's see if it's Christmas. Love that. It's a little bit of some green. It's taking me a little closer. It's a little bit of green. It's into that boy. That's amazing. I didn't even...it doesn't sound like it's live. It sounds like it's something pre-reported. Definitely. It's really nice. I need you. I need you. I need you. It's wonderful. Not only is Christmas a big deal in the Philippines, but malls are a big deal in the Philippines. Nice place to go, where it's air conditioned. So it makes sense. So you're going to find the most Christmas stuff here at the mall. So we've been five thousand pesos a month for our internet already. We get a hundred megabytes upload or downloads, sorry. But upload is the most important for us. And we are averaging about 60, 65 megabytes megabits per second. So we're looking for that same sort of thing. Our house already has Globe, Fiber in it. So now we're just going to go and ask them what the best they can offer. And let's find out. Is the price going to be better than it is in Boracay? No, no. We're going to find out. We have an art contest. How cute is that? Still better than me. Yeah, well, you might be able to enter. You never know. Oh, it's persons with disabilities. Drawing contest. That's fantastic. Yeah, we're going to find out. And you're out here. I would tell you. So of course we have Michael's playground right here. If you ask for what he will do some tricks for you. That's his bed. When he says something bad to me, that's where he sleeps. Wow. When he needs exercise, of course we have some hoops and a ramp. Two ramps. People are always saying, how do you guys stay in shape? Yeah, I just let him out there, give him like half an hour. Pretend there's a squirrel. And it goes crazy. It's crazy. It's beautiful. It's beautiful. Oh, no, no, no. I make her clean up my poop, though. Hey, who wins there? It's too big. Oh, we're so crazy sometimes. Yes, what? Yes, what? We're coming up to the piece of the rest all. You're so extra. I am a little too extra, right? Yeah, we're coming up to a massive, massive, Christmas tree they have here. It looks pretty good. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, for Christmas. Huh, I've got to return that little gift of a diamond. Wow, look at that angel. You guys might not wait. Look at all of this. Wow. Literally, the angels are taller. I feel like they're taller than me. If I were to go stand there, I think they're angel. They're literally taller. They're statues. I don't doubt it. It's like the, what are the weeping angels? Oh. Creepy, a little creepy, isn't it? They don't look like they're weeping. Oh, there's people waving at us. Hello, we're going to come around. We're going to go down. All right, let's go. Imagine what this is going to look like when it is dark up. Oh, it's going to be pretty, I think. So, I believe these guys are vloggers, by the way. Hello, hello, oh my goodness, oh my goodness. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Yes, they're afraid of falling in love. Apparently, I shouldn't say hello. Nice to meet you. I'm Kennedy. Maybe you want to meet you. I'm from the stars.

Where were you doing DJ? Oh, just. Are you sure you're wearing? I'm wearing a foot in here, I think. I'm looking. I'm looking. Estonia. No, it's not. Slovenia. Sorry, Slovenia. Sorry about that. That's my bad. That's my bad. I honestly, everybody is actually. I am my bad at it. She's my translator. Doesn't matter what part of the world we're in, she gets it right away. That's so cool. So now you're living here, married to a Filipino. How do you like life here? It's okay. It's okay. Okay, from now on. How's the weather compared to Slovenia? Yeah, it's warm. Yes. Yes, it's much nicer. No winter here. No winter. No, it's like every day is a beautiful day. You can go in a range, you can go outside. I don't mind the rain. Yeah, it's nice here. Yeah, it's nice. It's very nice. We just found out that you actually rent roller skates here and you're roller skated around. So it's like a skating rink without the ice. Ah, that is so cool and such a good idea. Hello. Hello, that's so cool. You can rent roller skates here. I'm taking it your first time. Just a guess. Just a guess. All right, I found it. Rent a skate. So looking, they even have pink ones. Bianca is excited about that. And they got little meat pads and elbow pads. They give you everything. Let's see, oh, here's price right here. 30 minutes, only 100 pesos. Comes with gear. What's the price there? Yeah, what's the 70's bring your own skate? Okay. That is so cool. Ah, you don't sell socks though. You do? You guys should rent. She doesn't have any excuse anymore. My wife said, oh, but I don't have any socks. I'm like, I'm going to go find out. They have socks. That's make her skate. Hi. She's doing great. Oh, I have to go find the pink one. Okay. Comes with super star. Wow, you guys have best out it. Yes, yes. Yes, yes. That's a nice one. So lights have finally come on. And it's looking nice already. It's interesting, all these lights on and still a blue sky. All right, they got copyright music. So I'm going to talk out here. Look at this whole Christmas setup. I'm going to go and give it a little tour. Somebody wants these bunny ears. Here, welcome. Let's see if you even noticed this. I'm just going to walk up and just say hi. And we'll see what they say. Nobody notices me right now. So it's fine. Right? Nobody's seeing anything. They don't even notice. Let's see if you notice. Oh, what's the matter? What's the matter? What? What am I doing? I'm just going to walk up and just say hi. We'll see what they say. Nobody notices me right now. So it's fine. Right? Nobody's seeing anything. They don't even notice. Let's see if you notice. Oh, I got it. What's the matter? I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. Everybody's staring at me and I don't know why. You just added another foot to yourself. I know. I'm tolerant of you now by far. Okay? It's from the top of your ear. It's all for us. You're looking at it. Yeah, you like that? Is it like, if you hit if you wear a curvy... Wait, are you wearing a backwards? I don't know. Yeah, because I think it's mostly on the outside. Yeah. Oh. Is that better? Yeah. All right, you're welcome, everybody. You're welcome. They can't see you. There you go. All right, screenshot, blackmail, I get it. Except for I'm literally reporting myself to her. All right, no, take your ears. Jokes over. Jokes along. I'm just joking. Joke them along. No, it's not. They don't understand. It's an inside joke. It just because it sounds like I'm saying I'm joking along. And so... What is joke? Nah, I'm not long. No, no. No, no. No, no. All right, you look a little bit better on you. I gotta tell you, a little bit better. Let's switch 100 pesos, get you these days. Why does your camera way better than mine? Because it's a more expensive. Look how pretty that is though. What? Smart little advertising put on the side of that. All right, it's not something up here. Not very Christmasy, but you know, whatever. Still pretty cool. Check them out. Look at that. You got Pikachu over here. So an eyeglasses. Gotta make a dollar, you know? Whatever it takes for a Pikachu has been out of work for a while. Hello. Okay, well, we're gonna go find out because we just thought of something. Are they gonna have like size 12 shoes when it comes to this? I have a feeling they're not gonna have my feet. What's the biggest size? It's for size 41. 41. Oh yeah. Try to try the black. We got this. Oh, okay, cool, cool, cool. 41 though. What is it pulling shoes? Oh wait. No. All right, so it's gonna be her. And we're gonna film Herger doing it. Because she's definitely... Yeah, what's up with you big foot? I know, what the heck? You're the second largest. Oh my goodness. I can't even have pink at the top. With her, it's not all of us. It depends. So you can't have pink, you can only have white. Oh, are you gonna cry? Oh, I'm not crying. You're wearing a lot of pink, honestly. I just might ask. You just might be up top. No. We're gonna buy the disposable. So it's the one for you. All right. Please. You're gonna love it. I might pass, I might point my head and die. And what was just put these on your helmet? Yeah, I was gonna just let you know which one's me. Exactly. I don't want to get mixed up. Oh, bye. Whoa, be careful. Careful, gangster. Like a short shot. Like a short shot? You need some. Yeah. Put the filler. Hello. That's with the Filipino gangsters. Where are you? I'm gonna hang out. Yeah, come on over here though. You can, uh, you're gonna get, but you're gonna put the... Oh, I'm gonna put the... Hello, hello. No, no. Is she the writer? Is she the deal writer? Oh, that's easy deal writer, right there. You deal writer. Have a good chat. Awesome. Hello, that's not dark. You say hello. Uh, uh, uh, okay, shout, shout out to her. Is she the writer? Is she the deal writer? Shout out to easy deal writer. Yes, exact. Easy deal writer all the way. Thank you. Alright, brother. Awesome. Nice to meet you, buddy. Alright, look at all this. You are set up. Are you scared? I think my head is bigger than this. You're looking good. You're looking good. I like this look on you, to be honest. Thank you, thank you. It goes well with the pearl necklace. Where are these? Why did you do it for my knees? My elbows are fine. Yeah? Yes. That's what you needed. Oh, oh. Too big. Too big. Actually, there's whole thing. Let me see what I can do. Alright, now you're good. Now you're good. I'm sweating. I'm literally sweating. Where are you wearing a big giant sweater? I'm sweating because I'm baby. Alright, alright, alright. Final word. If I fall, you have to cut it. You have to cut it. Oh, I don't know how to use this. Alright, I'm going to help her up, though. You hang on to me, and I keep you from sliding. You get to hang on to a railing. There you go. Yeah, once you get a push, you're better. Yeah, don't forget your toe. Always use one toe, not both. Yeah, there you go. And it'll help you race yourself. I wish. Woo! What do you wish? I wish they were in the straight line. You know what I mean? Like roller skates? Yeah. Or blades? I don't know. Yeah, it's a little easier, isn't it? Well, I want you to get used to skating. It's easier to have. Oh, I'm just kidding. Yeah, it's getting used to the toe. We're pushing off user toe. I'm going to skate. You got this. Woo! Woo! There you go. There you go. Almost. All right, my bunny. You're doing good. You're doing good. Very casual. Casual. I said it, please. I don't even know what I'm doing. I don't know what I'm doing. You're getting there. You're getting there. I bet you're a couple of times around. You'll have it. Who's hard work? I'm already splint. It's... You're working hard. What can I say? You're hard the year. So the year's split. I can't put them backwards. Hang on, don't move. Now you're looking good. You're looking great. Like a true bunny. Woo! What? I'm pretty... I don't know how to move. You know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. I wish I'd like... With skates. I know how to push off. I know how to stop. Yeah. I can... Like if you turn sideways, you do a little icy. Woo! She's getting all the attention. She's never done it before. Skating on ice skates is a thin line. Skating on roller blades is a thin line. For roller blades like this, like the four roller skates I guess is not the same thing. You don't have the same push off, the same way of pushing yourself forward. And I've done it before, but I feel like... I don't remember how to tell her how to do it. And since size 41 is the largest size, I can't come in and help her. Oh, oh, she's getting it. She's getting it. There we go! Happy Easter. Wait, wait, it's Christmas. Why are you an Easter bunny? I cheat, I cheat. Yeah, there's so many Christmas decorations all over. It's so sorry, guys. I'm super sweaty right now. Yeah, well, you did great. You did great. But yes, it is really nice. You could actually see the holiday season kind of actually appearing in front of your eyes. And all the decorations are really cute. Go and buy them. Check this out. So, SM is running this. If you buy one, they will doonate another one to a child in need for 250 pesos. All right. Who works this side? Do you work this side? Nope. Are you working here? Yeah? Yeah, I just don't know who works here. Everybody's looking at me funny. Because I have a camera. All right, so which one are you going to buy? You got pink? You got orange? You got a blue bear? We're on the street. Oh. How about world's best dad for you? Or no way. Cool is brother. I think you're the coolest brother. Thank you. Thank you. Look at his little hat. You did say homie, great. That was cute. I don't think that one counts. No, they're less than 250. All right. I'm done for this one, mom. Do you want to be the world's sweetest sister? Wait, what are the other ones? Greatest mom? Yeah. Oh, yes. And then I'm going to give it to our cats. Wow. Hi. Hello. Can we get one of these? So, these are the ones you have to pick for them for the donation, right? Nice. And they'll go to a child in need. When does it go? Christmas Day? Yes. Okay. I'll put our channel though. All right. You just put our channel. Wait, wait, wait. Let me do this one. Wow. I almost put your dad. Wow. That's a problem. Okay. Perfect. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. All right guys. So they do that the SM cares. And then over at the mega world one. Yeah. They had where you buy a box for three interpaces. And they're the box we filled with toys for children in need as well. Wow. That is not like this where you buy one and children get one. Yeah. There you just get 300. Yeah. But it's really cool. And then after that they have a countdown of how many they're trying to buy for the kids. Wow. And then they have a shelf where you put the box and you stack them up to show, you know, signify how many people donated. So there are things that all the different malls they do with their own different little twists to it. I'm going to do one everywhere. Yeah. We're just going to do one everywhere, exactly. All right. Well, that was fun. We got Felice Navidad, by the way, playing right now to send us off for the evening. Yes. We enjoyed our little Christmas time, you know. Yeah. We met the awesome people. We did.
