It tastes so unhealthy.
If you have this snack in Korea, you should try it.
You should try it, you should try it.
Hi everyone, this is Jessica.
And welcome back to the series Korean Ate.
So for today's episode, I'm going to let different Koreans try the classic Filipino snacks.
There are a variety of Filipino snacks out there.
You know, starting from my favorite ding dong, pillows, and cracklings to Chicharonimangwan.
I let different Korean college students try.
So I'm excited to figure out what their reactions will be.
So let's go ahead and check it out.
Okay guys, so we're back with the guest.
Could you please really briefly introduce yourself?
So today, we're going to try some Filipino snacks.
Have you tried them before?
No, I haven't.
I've tried a lot of foreign snacks, but I'm not sure if they're from the Philippines.
I'm not sure if they're from the Philippines.
But I've seen a lot of Filipino snacks in Korea.
Like Keto.
There were a lot of people who didn't know about it.
I thought Copico was from the Philippines, because it's so famous in the Philippines.
But it turns out that it's from Indonesia.
So there might have been some of the snacks that you've tried in the Philippines.
The snacks that we're going to try today are not the snacks that are on the market these days.
In Korea, they're like Matdongsan, Kkokalkon, and classic snacks.
We're going to try some of the classic snacks.
If there's anything you know, please let me know.
I know this one.
This one?
Yes.
This one is also sold in Malaysia.
And there are a lot of Jack and Jill brands in Malaysia.
Biatos!
That's the Philippines?
Biatos in Indonesia!
I know all the Korean high school students.
There's a small snack shop in Korea.
You can buy snacks there for about 600 won.
Really?
Then you can buy snacks under the desk during class.
Okay, then I'll start with the most common one.
Biatos.
Please open it.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Mmm.
It's so good.
I mean, I had this when I was in high school as well.
In Indonesia?
Yeah, in Indonesia.
But it wasn't like the go-to chip.
But it was really good though.
It's just one of those classic that you don't hate or you don't love.
It's a taste that you eat a lot.
Right, right.
It's my type.
It feels like the five potatoes have spread out.
Oh, five potatoes!
The cheese flavor is just like a normal cheese snack.
But the barbecue flavor is more stimulating.
Right, right, right.
High school students really like it.
This is a five out of five.
Four.
I give it a five.
I like it.
I give it a four.
The next exotic one is Nova.
Nova is also a steady seller flavor in the Philippines.
You know what it looks like, right?
Sun Chip.
Right, Sun Chip.
This is also a cheddar cheese flavor.
It's good.
The one that they sell with almonds and anchovies...
Is it the one with anchovies?
You're talking about anchovies, right?
It tastes like anchovies.
I don't think it tastes like cheese that much.
Oh, you're right.
But it really doesn't taste like cheese.
It doesn't taste like cheese.
It feels super healthy.
It's made of grains, so it's a snack that you can enjoy without feeling guilty.
It's so good.
So how would you rate Nova?
Two.
I would give it a four.
Two.
For the health, I will give it a three.
For the health, that's the only...
Let's go with the most cheesy one over here.
Cheese ring.
It's got a neon color.
Bright color.
It tastes like cheese balls.
Oh, cheese balls?
I'm pretty sure this is not a real cheese.
This kind of cheese flavor is like...
Artificial cheese flavor?
Yes.
It was supposed to be this hard.
It's a little hard.
Wait, it tastes...
It tastes good.
This cheese is good, but the texture of the chips feels like it has a lot of air.
That's right.
So how would you rate our cheese ring?
Five.
Cheese ring.
I think I'll just give it a three.
Because it's not as soft as I thought it was going to be.
Three.
The last cheese flavor.
Clover.
The cheese color is almost like a neon pen.
Try it.
Let's see how it tastes.
How is it?
It's like a cheese tail.
A complete cheese.
It tastes so unhealthy.
I think it's a little worse than this.
Oh, is this more cheesy than this?
Yeah, way more cheese.
I think it tastes like donuts.
Donuts?
The seasonings are almost the same.
The texture makes it more exotic.
The powder is fine, but it feels like it's made to be soggy on purpose.
Wait a minute.
Did you make it soggy?
Did you make it soggy?
Guys, there's some problem with clover.
It's usually very dry.
Oh, really?
How would you rate clover?
Two.
I think it's a five.
It's delicious.
I'll give it a two.
Too bad, guys.
Because this is not the actual texture of clover.
I think something happened in the process of being exported.
This is also a classic snack.
Sweet corn.
Let's smell it.
Wow, it looks so delicious.
Corn?
I'll give it a two.
How is it?
It smells like corn soup.
It's sweet and salty.
It's like a national snack.
Have you tried it a lot in Korea?
Yes, I think I've tried it a lot in Korea.
This one is not exotic at all.
There's one ice cream that tastes the same like this.
Corn?
Shaved ice cream?
Right?
It tastes like chakani.
Chakani.
It tastes like chakani.
How would you rate sweet corn?
I'll give it a four.
I'll give it a three.
I think I'll give it a two.
This is my favorite of these.
It's vinegar flavor.
You have to smell it first.
What is it?
Wait a minute.
I'm crying.
It's so strong.
You put a lid on it.
It's not bad.
I'm still mad.
You should try it.
I'm so hurt.
I told him I'm still recovering.
It's dancing in my tongue.
I think I know what it tastes like.
I think I'm used to it.
I think it's okay.
Why?
The texture is like shrimp.
It's a little harder shrimp.
My first impression is a little scary,
but it's like a warm friend.
I don't think I can finish a whole bag.
I like this the most, but I can't finish this at once.
Because my tongue hurts.
How would you rate this?
The smell is like a negative 50.
But the taste, I think it's pretty okay.
Maybe a three, maybe a four.
I'll give it a four.
Three.
I'll give it a five.
When this topic comes to Korea,
I think I'll try it again.
What was your favorite?
Actually, this is my favorite.
But barbecue flavor, I like that the most.
I like this.
Piatos.
Clover.
You like the clover.
It really tastes like those American cheese balls.
I like this.
Same, same, same.
So guys, we've tried different classic Filipino snacks today.
I hope you guys enjoyed it.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
