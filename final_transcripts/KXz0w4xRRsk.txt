 Oh these people came out to see me. Thanks guys, I hope my first time in Philippines. Appreciate it. Thank you. Hello again. Thank you. Hello again. Thank you. Just where I started, it's ending. It's a bit more stolen, man. Can't wait. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. See you later. All right guys. Welcome back to another video and the time has come. We are leaving Indonesia. Unfortunately, it's been an amazing six weeks. But honestly, probably the best six weeks of my life. But we are leaving and we are going to the Philippines. Philippines. I can't believe it. We're so excited. So we just arrived at the airport. Jakarta Airport. It's 1am, it's 5pm. So we're not sleeping tonight. But yeah, get ready for the adventure. We're starting the vlog in Jakarta and we're ending in Manila Philippines. Let's go. It is a ghost town. That's what you get when you come at 1am. But let's hope there's no queues there. Bay days. All right, so can I check and please? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. This is okay, Han Lagi. No, I get it. Han Lagi. We are all checked in ready to go. You're probably thinking this guy loves his late night flights. Every flight I take is late at night. No, they're the cheapest. That's the only time I can fly. I'm broke. But now for real, the late night, one of the cheapest flights one. So I've got no other choice. So we made it through immigration, nice and smoothly. And we got the tickets. I forgot to mention, we stopped in Malaysia. And then from Malaysia, we go to Manila Philippines. So that's why it's so long, man. I think it's like a three hour layover. So that's the second time I'm stopping in Malaysia. When I was coming to Indonesia, I also stopped there. Maybe it's a sign. I need to go there soon. But yeah, just like again, out the or get number four. And you're just waiting, man, go like an hour or two. And yeah, just the way you're getting now. Tynas is slowly creeping in, man. Can you see it? But yeah, it's all part of the journey. Let's get some snacks feeling a bit hungry, threading to see these prices though. So we'll be here to Smith, just like we'll pack up. And see you soon. $10,000 of here. You need to pack it back. It's OK. Thank you, ma'am. OK, see you. We got some porgyoles. Original Congo, along with some Oreos. And the price was actually decent. And local shop to eat, about $10,000. And here's $17,000. So not bad. Everything else, like, triple the price from Crazy. And we got a little souvenir, Jakarta. This is $4,000 for the mother. And just something to remember Jakarta by, but I'm going to miss it. There's honesty at so much. That's such a good time here. Like, it's been six weeks here. And I hardly touched the surface of Indonesia. It's too so much to see. It's definitely going to come back in Shalom. And yes, I'm going to eat the full packet. That's traveling breakfast for you at 3 a.m. And I'm fast forward a couple of hours. We made it to Malaysia. We didn't film much on the plane because I was sleeping. And I knocked off. I'm so tired now. I'm basically my eyes probably red. We actually made it to Malaysia. It's an hour ahead here. Well, at the same time to Manila, but our head from Jakarta. So it's about 7 hours. The flight's 10. So I got three hours, man. Three hours to try and get some rest maybe. But I need to transfer first. And yeah, so tired. So this is the need for the next two hours or so. It was crazy. I was just in this area. And I was going to Indonesia, man. I feel like just yesterday, man. Six weeks went so quick. Now we're back here. All right, so it's time to go to Manila. Had a couple of hours left, you know? This is great. So now, fresh day to sleep again on the plane. I We are going to have a wonderful evening for our visa. We are going to the next day for the services. We are going to the next day for the services. We are going to the next day for the services. Our strictness for Hibiscus is a thank you. Thank you. So we have made it to the mille. It was about our village. Well, it was a really bad one. It was raining. We couldn't run. We had to fly around like a good hour. So far, we have not been able to land that hour too. We are already here. Of course, we have got a pretty smooth day considering the Philippines will be really strict. But now we just need to get some money and all the usual stuff. And yeah, we can go and head out. This looks like everything. All these people came out to see me. Thanks guys.
