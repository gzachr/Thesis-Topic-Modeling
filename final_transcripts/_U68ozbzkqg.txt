 Now that is epic! Guys, we are back in BGC for Christmas. We have never made a BGC at night video before. Here we are. We are doing a BGC at night. We are going to barbecue chicken again because it was tasty last time. I haven't had it in a while. Sounded kind of good. I think we got this last time. Crispy. I will try it again quick. That is crispy. Is it hot? There is a little tingle in there but not a ton of tingle. Pretty good. We did not get the Tio Boki this time because that absolutely murdered us. It just seemed like a terrible, terrible idea. We can order it if you want. Let's go for it. Oh, look at that. They smell amazing. They smell like mozzarella sticks. They kind of look like the same breading. It smells like mozzarella sticks from space aliens. They know what space aliens is. Leave a comment down below. They are big getting on it. I am not very oniony. It is like a lot of breading. It is not bad. It is seasoned well. I just wish the onion was a little thicker. Those fries. Look and let McDonald's ask. You would expect them to be hot and crispy, right? Yeah. Oh, I am hearing some crunch. Only like the tip as a crunch. Or the middle is just mush. The dang tip. And they are not even salty. It is a little disappointing. What do you mean they got green stuff on them right there? Green doesn't always mean good. The chicken is delicious. The onion rings are pretty good. The fries. The fries I am going to give them a three. The chicken I am going to give it eight. The onion rings I am going to give them a seven five. That is pretty epic. Korean chicken. Add. No. Cheezy more. Cheezy ling. Is it called or something like that? Cheezer. Cheezer. Cheezer. Cheezer. Cheezer. Cheezer. Cheezing. Cheezing. Cheezing. Cheezing. Cheezing. For some reason if you get the platter, you can't get boneless. I don't know what what changes there, but it just does. That happens a lot. Like things like that where usually they're just like yes, it's an extra fee. They just say no, you can't do that. Yeah. So I don't get that. Interesting, but we'll see how this is. Oh, very crispy sounding. I'm using the new method, the spoon fork and knife together. That probably is more effective, I would say. It's a flatter surface to push. Oh yeah. And then you also get the stabbing capability of the fork at the same time. Oh yeah. Mmm. Whoa. I honestly didn't have like, I didn't know what to expect from it. Well, that's so good actually. Because you got that like MSG like the sweeter cheese on the outside. It fits really well. And then of course the breading is so salty. Mmm. Pretty salty. And I just got unlimited mozzarella sticks. There's not mozzarella sticks fried, I wish. But I would give that an 8.2. Very nice. Could you say it's very cheese-lingy? I get it. I actually don't get it. What's the joke? It has cheese on it. Huh? They have a Mona Lisa here? Are we in France or the Philippines? The bitchie? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. BBQ chicken took so dang long to get the food that we have to leave the table right now. And go watch the fireworks and then we're going to come back. There's a cat that's sitting there and he's just, he's keeping our food safe. I trust him. We have a bond now. I gave him some chicken. So what side is it? This side or this side? Everyone's lined up right there already. And they're basing the way to the right, right? Yeah, it's got to be over here. So we're going to get this fireworks show. See this and then we will go back and finish our food and then walk around this area and see what this is all like. How Christmassy is BGC at night? All right. Hopefully this isn't just people waiting for the 3D billboard. There's more than there was before for the 3D billboard. But it's not like a cat. I know, I know. And occasionally I'm like a foract on a food band advertising. As if everyone in this country had heard of food band already. If you see the food band to pop up, you get hungry and you're like, oh, I want some food too. That's true. Oh, here we go. What the heck? We're directly under that. I hope we get some shrapnel on us. Now that's epic. Why would you watch the real thing when you could watch the reflection? I know that's where I heard it's not. I'm the reflection now. Like, oh. I'm the reflection now. Like, oh. I'm the reflection now. I'm the reflection now. I'm the reflection now. Like, oh. You can't do the bat. What? You can't do the bat. The bat? The bat, the bat, man. Well, it's called sparkles in the sky. I definitely see some sparkles different from what we can do. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Maybe I got it. Maybe. Now that's epic. Sparkles. Now we have to get back and eat our dang food. Our food's getting cold. The kitten has eaten a doll. Oh! We probably jumped up on the table. That little rascal. And after this, we're going to dance on stage with the Lexus people. That'll burn off in calories, so then we're going to eat at the alley after that. Chicken, chicken, chicken, chicken. That was sparkly. I wonder what other colors we're going to see. We're in BGC on Friday night. Friday night lights. Club time. Roadhog. Now she threw the snow on a one-horse open sleigh over his vehicle. Something all the way. I don't know, jingle bells. I was laughing. I was laughing. Hi. More like crying all the way. Look at this place. The only reason we went into this mall last time was trying to find that restaurant we just went to. Because it said it was like in this area. And we were so confused how to get there. But there's an aspect of a right outside. We're new and improved smarter than ever now. And we just know what we're doing, obviously. So we're going to walk around BGC Christmas. We just finished our meal. And this mall is just Christmas-out. It's a very small mall. Yeah, it's really small. And this lobby area alone has so much. I imagine. Yeah, I mean, there's more stuff on these next floors as well. BGC is like the fancy area in Manila. And definitely the all-out Christmas area. Because seriously, there's so many dang lights. It's all out when it comes to most things. BGC is. So we're just going to walk up and down high street. I know there's a big Christmas tree here somewhere too, isn't there? I don't remember last year there was. It would do that countdown. It would be a little loud when it happened. It would do like a little light show. So maybe we'll find that Christmas tree. And we'll just show you what it's looking like out here. Just your little BGC update. The book is to... Because we've gone here like five times in our lives. And it's surprising. You ever got a vlogger there here basically all the time? Us? Nah. But first, something we never tried in the Philippines. What are you doing? I'm shaking my sack. Where's your... Where's your shack? Oh, it's called Shake Shack. That was Shake Fack. This is awkward. I've been getting a different service here I guess. Was this in Makati? They have a special shake here in Ube Shake, which is a Manila exclusive. And then they also have a Christmas hot cocoa shake. What's the L.E.R.? Ding dong. I got some hot cocoa. Wow. Ding dong. Dante's? Dante? The... The... The Family Feud Philippines host? Oh, Ding dong. I did not know his last name was Dante. I thought his first name was Ding and his last name was Don. Oh, that's pretty sick. Mr. Dong? Yeah. Shake Shack. You know, being a Minnesota kid, he used to go outside in the winter for like a few hours. Dig a snow fort. So it was basically just a tunnel along the side of my road where the snow pile would blow up all the snow. We just built like a tunnel system underneath there. And then we'd come in and we'd be freezing and my cheeks would be so red and they'd hurt. Then sit by that... Sit by the fire and have a nice hot cocoa. I was very confused. I thought you were going to make it talk about Shake Shack. I was like, I didn't know where it was going, but yeah, hot cocoa makes sense. Well, this is a cold hot cocoa. How can something be frozen and hot? That's an ocky moron. Let's find out. I believe it said it's a frozen hot chocolate with marshmallows, cocoa powder on top, and whipped cream. Which should be amazing. I don't know. Shake Shack's usually pretty thick. This is not looking too thick. The whipped cream on top is... Wait, this is the best angle for a... Drinking action? Very festive. Oh, sorry. Those are right in the mic. It's not really loud. Whoa. It really tastes like hot chocolate, but it's really strong. Oh, it's really strong. It doesn't taste like hot chocolate. It tastes like cocoa powder. Just straight up. Let me get a marshmallow. That's both important. That's epic. That's bringing back the memes. Wow. Thanks for the memories. Even the memories so good. Well, anyway, the vanilla exclusive shake is the ube shake. Whoa. It's purple. What the heck? Why didn't they fill it up all the way? I don't know. It's weird. Let's try. This one's thicker. Good. It's amazing. It sounds like it would be amazing. It's amazing. I really like the manam ube shakes. But this is like that. It's thick custard in there. It's so good. It's really, really ube. The ice cream is perfect. That's so good. This is 240, which is a lot for a shake, especially one this year. But it's so good. When you're craving it, you just gotta drop it. You just gotta drop the pesto. You know what I'm saying? Drop the pesto's dropping all these pesto's. Take, Shaq. Let's go get pesto. Wow. I'm really feeling the Christmas vibes right now. Dude. It looks like it's three dimensions. Like normally a billboard. It's flat. But this one? Look at that. Three feet. Have we ever seen that in any other country? Like the same cat that goes on there all the time? Never? Not according to YouTube. And only what matters in our lives is our vlog. That is true. We have not been anywhere other than what's been posted on our channel. It's true. We don't have a life outside of vlog. We were just in Indonesia. We definitely weren't there a while ago. No, no. Some people are in America. Oh, you guys came to wait. And in one day. That's best, dude. It's Santa Claus. It's the beginning of giving our... He's gonna announce our giveaway around the screen right here. We actually bought the advertisement. All right, here we go. And... Oh, shoot, we got a cross. We got a cross. Shoot. Sorry, you're gonna have to wait for Walmart Claus later in the video. Guys, BGC is kind of weird. Look at this thing. Come on, sutra. Oh! We need to keep walking. Just keep walking. Just keep walking. India, they definitely need to go with Thomas Sutra. I mean... I hope I ever got to sneak through some Instagram pics. See? You see it? Have you seen our Instagram? I mean, our pictures are pretty much the best pictures ever. I just will never understand. When you're in this place and there's like lights and fountains and all this everywhere, then you just take a picture by a black wall. Because... It's the most important part of a picture is yourself. Ah! So you're saying that girl just had a massive ego? No. Look at us right now. We're filming ourselves. Do we have a massive ego? Some... We haven't had that comment a few times. They're like, why are you filming yourself? Show what you're doing. But this B is interesting. It'd be like a Gabe Traveler video. Gabe, we love you. Wow, a Dalmatian. Big boy. Now do a Corella Deville laugh right now. I'm trying to do the one from the DVD, the... The Tigger DVD. Oh, what does she say? Goodbye! Oh, get actually. I wanted to laugh really loud, but I feel like this one disrupts. Yeah, we're like... We're a bit too close. Well, festivities. That worker has a Christmas hat on. Holy nuts. Now that's festive. I thought we were going to get more festive. There's just a lot of lights. Yeah. What's the trees? Maybe. It's down the other way. Let's find out. All right, let's go interview Santa Claus over there. I'm like, hey, when did you come from the North Pole? Isn't this climate bad for you? Yeah, you know. It's probably sweating a lot, especially, you know. A bit of a larger guy. I'm not saying it's bad or anything. Not here to shame anyone. Not him. Santa Claus. Well, that is Santa Claus. But what would be your first question to Santa Claus over there if you could interview him? I'd probably ask him what the quadratic formula is. You never hear about Santa Claus when he was a kid. Or when he's even like... Did he go to college? Does he know the quadratic formula? I need it. These are the questions we need, though. Is he and did he get schooling? My first question would be, when did you become Filipino? That's a good one, I guess. I thought there was a fat boy. Let me call the busatian. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Oh? Oh. I broke up the communication device. Wait, wait, wait. Ah. Ah. Doc Claus. Doc to me. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. So Ron lives. His army of your kind will look at this form the land of his return. I just watched Lord of the Rings. My precious. Ah. Thank you for not smoking. What about being smoking hot? Oh. Oh. Christmas. Oh, it's making my teeth get very yellow. I told you we were in Lord of the Rings. You remember when the Nasgula released and then the... And then the dual-eyed fracker. Oh. Boy, look in fracker comes and kills us all. Ah. Ah. Nuts. Fract, dude, we were in a friggin' dog. Nuts. There's a big Christmas tree right here. It's so bright. Oh, you can go inside of it. Wow, our lighting just got a lot better. Wow, it's bright in here. Oh. There's pointy. Oh no. Ow. Ow. Ah, they heard. They're like small pieces of wood. They heard. And they're like really pokey. That's not good. Chipped wood. No. Hey. Do you want to go to the distillery? There's a Christmas tree made out of a liquor over there. Now that's what I call. Is that a bit of a contradiction? Ah. A religious holiday in alcohol. No, because they drink wine at communion. And stuff. Oh, true. Maybe all of those whiskeys or whatever the heck though? Yeah, it's literally whiskey. Just, it's the blood of Christ. That is. It's the brown, like whiskey blood. So basically what you're saying is Christmas has lost its beating and it's very commercialized. No. Are you saying a whiskey company making a Christmas tree out of whiskey and trying to sell whiskey to you? Isn't commercialized? Are you saying KFC being the most popular food to eat in Japan on Christmas? Not commercialized? No, because KFC, the kernel is my god. The kernel, it'll make sense now. The kernel was the one who was born on December 25th. The kernel. Jesus. It's all white. They're the same person. Oh, okay. I mean, I like that this high street area. Yeah. They lit it up. Earlier, I was thinking BGC is really just kind of a like a Philippines mall, but it's just outside. Yep. It's the most extravagant mall. It's literally, I mean, it's all the same restaurants, all the same stores that you can find in one of the nice, fancy Philippines malls. You'll find it here in BGC just outside on the street. But can you find this in a mall? No, you can't. A dripping rock. All right, I'm going under. All right, go for it. Jump into the hole with all of our camera equipment inside my pocket. I'm down. Oh my gosh. Let's see. Let's see. No, it's the Coca-Cola kindness village. Oh, thank you, Coca-Cola. We weren't talking about commercialization of Christmas earlier, but you have a Santa Claus posted. I want to commercialize these floofers boys right here. Who have you? Make them our new mascot and not duck. We watched one of our old videos from Georgia when we first got duck. We looked at a clip of it and duck was so clean and so new and so fresh. Now it's just yuck. It's a dirty boy. Well, Coca-Cola. Thank you, Coke. You're a pretty good drink. But I think I prefer Pepsi. Is Pepsi good in the Philippines or not? Weirdly enough, I only drink, I never drink zero products, but I always drink the Pepsi zero or whatever the heck it's called. But I don't like the normal Pepsi here, but I like it in every other country. I like it here. But the normal Coke here, I like it better. Hi. What's up? What? Our vlog? The tri-fait is our vlog. Tri-fait, yeah. Jame's eyes. Jame's eyes. Uh-oh. Jame's eyes. Uh-oh. Thank you. What are the odds? Do you think they'll be able to search up our name after we told them tri-fait? People say you guys need business cars and they're like, no, well, we're not like, no, we're like, ah, how do we do that though? And we probably would have gotten over 100 subs at this point. We are. We never start anything. We have too many things. Well, that was the Coca-Cola kindness. I really thought they were going to have a different inspirational quote for each button, but it's the same thing. What does that mean? The world needs more. Does the world need more Santos? He seems like he's doing a good enough job already. I mean, we saw Filipino Santos over there. That's true. That is true. Maybe every country just needs a Santos. Are we going to be assaulted by a gang now that that kid just washed some gang signs? We are not affiliated with any messages sent in this video. Italianies. Listen, you got some okay food. But we may have gotten food poisoning. Yeah. I'm pretty sure it was Italianies. On two separate occasions. Yeah. Try Nova location. Italianies. We expect you to compensate us now. Please send us an email to our business email below. The first time we had it, it was so good and we didn't have any issues. Second and third time. Nah. Nah. Nah. Over there, we just completed BGC High Street. And now we're going to go down here to BGC Low Street. Let's go. Guys, where are we? We belong. Because people call us children. All right, don't worry guys. Santos is coming right now to show you what present he's bringing you today. When did he turn into a polar, not a polar bear, a teddy bear, a grizzly bear? Let's see if he can morph into the real Santa already. Oh. Oh, St. Nicholas. St. Nicholas. St. Nicholas. Nicholas? Nicholas, I can't help it. Hey, that's right. I need my help. St. Nicholas. St. Nicholas is my name. L.P. That's my name. I'm feeling extra jolly today. And we're going to be giving away some more gifts. Aww, gifts, you say. Wow. After going to BGC, we just feel like we need to give. We saw some beautiful jolly fireworks. Hello, jolly. I am Russian Santa Claus. I want a vodka. Oh. Give me the vodka. Alright, guys, we're doing the old comment picker. Oh, you know, I'll do it in Russian. I'll do it in Russian accent. Today, we are doing a comment picker. Nicholas, you cannot die. Hey, that's right. Let's see who's first. Oh, I was just a French. Oh, L.P. fun. The second four vloggers I've watched, we said, Marguille, Cynthia's their favorite city in the Philippines so far. First, who said it was a global adventure. Oh, fantastic. Oh, accents are soon to be spied down. I don't know what mine is now. I have become something of New York, New York Russian. You know, L.P. fun. Let's go on to the next. Hopefully, that can find your chicken from Jolly. Let's continue. What do we have today? Hunk. Two, one, seven, six. Botanical ginsengut, gizogal ginsengut. A vanyankos. Giz. Wasn't this on though? Why are you talking about the botanical card? Maybe they were telling us to go to the botanical garden. They didn't see our last video. Seems like a lot of people didn't see some of our videos because some people are still like, you guys are back in the Philippines. I've even posted videos for like a month and a half. YouTube recommendations is in a weird spot. We know it gets all funky. Every time we leave a country, I go to a new country, I get to really funky with, but we've kind of like, no, how it works a bit now, but it still really changes every time we leave and come back. It's a slightly different. We lost a lot of views when we left Indonesia and came back to the Philippines. Yeah. And people in the Philippines have recognized us recently. And they're like, I thought you guys were in Indonesia. It's interesting. I think because we got a lot of views in Indonesia and we got a lot of subs from Indonesia, a kind of messed up Philippines recommendations. So a lot of people don't know our back yet. I don't think we're back in black. Man, man, we don't even need to do. We're being for being for being for being for being. So Christmas series. See you tomorrow. More epic stuff. Ben and you and then you and then you and then you.
