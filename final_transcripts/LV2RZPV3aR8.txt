Hello Natties! Today we are going to eat pares for the first time!
Solo en luna TV
We have come to a restaurant called Pares Retiro in Tomas Morato Avenue
Here in Quezon City
So they said that, locals say that they are very famous because of their pares
And we are going to try it now
Yeah I do not say that, I didn't know
And we are going to try it today
What do you want to eat today?
I would like to try, this is exotic and this is something that I have never seen anywhere
Bon Marro
But this place is famous for pares, we cannot ignore
Yeah, yeah, I'm saying
Let's just eat pares and the bon marro, what do you think?
And the chiseng
I will ignore it for now, I will come back for the chiseng
Okay
Other day
Seasoning the food
So a small, medium or large?
You go with the one large
And I stand for spicy
So you want this one?
Okay, medium, medium, medium, medium is spicy
Medium is spicy
There you go
And are we ordering the lumpia still?
If you want
And the lumpia in water still
Pares
The premium, not the classic
Okay, we reached the station
This water is perfect
They have worth water here
If you want, but if you want
There's halo-halo
You can try this
Halo-halo
Saba con hielo
I really want to try halo-halo
What is saba con hielo?
That's planting
No, that's
What you call this? Banana
Planting
What's planting?
A different type of banana
That is not the same one that you eat alone
No, yeah, that's the one
The one that's the big one
That's planting
Turr칩n de leche
You see, this is
What I really like
Are we going to try the halo-halo?
Yes, we have to try
Okay, so we have a lot of
Things to try today
With all the food that we ordered
The total price
Was 900
Pesos
217
And if you were in my country
You will be paying for this
3000
So this is
A blessing
This is new
For us
We are not used to getting
Cheap food
And quality too
Another surprising thing
About the Philippines
Is not only the cheap food
But also they give you free water
In the restaurant
With your order
Who does that?
Not Dominican Republic
You have to buy
The bottles of water
If you want to drink water
In a restaurant
So this is
Patis, what do you call patis?
Fish sauce
Fish sauce
This is the famous fish sauce
That we had to get when we were
Doing cinigang
They didn't get anywhere in our country
Because we don't have that
But we will put a chili later on
And then this one
We will put the chili as well
When we request
For more spiciness
And flavor
What is this one made of?
This one is just a simple
Soy sauce
And then with the calamansi on it
So this was the one
Who smelled like calamansi
Yes
I thought this was the calamansi
Sauce because of the color
No, this has never been used
This soy sauce
Then we will put a little
Pepper
Later on
Now it's just us waiting for the food
To arrive
It's arriving
It's arriving
It's sizzling
So cool
No, it's not
This is the pares
That if you want to try
Or you need to try
Wow
And that's the medium?
It's so big
What size is the big one?
Large
Like put your hands
How big is the big one?
Comparison
More than like this one
What animal do you kill
To get the combo?
The cow
Is it a cow?
Thank you too
Wow
This is silo
Yes
Because they are going to melt
It's melting
Silo
Then can we get
Plates
And my glass
Two plates
And spoon and fork
Yes
We don't have both
I will take the plate
Thank you
So this is the chili
And then we will put the chili there
I don't know
Do you want me to wipe it?
No
I can wipe it
I'm used to it
I didn't know you didn't trust it
But I used to
If you don't trust it
We cannot trust it either
I'm used to it
Also for the people who are watching
I don't know
Filipinos eat with fork and spoon
Instead of fork and knife
Fork and knife
In your country you usually eat
Fork and knife
Here it's you
You use the spoon for soups
Only for soups
Excuse me
Thank you
So what do I try first? Depare
I need to try depare
At least they don't give you too much rice
At least they don't give you
Too much rice
It really looks like
Res guisada
Yes
It's getting fresh
It's really good
So if you put a little
Don't put too much
It's too spicy
You said too spicy
If I put too much
Not that much
Not that much
What is she talking about?
Not that much
Did I pronounce it well?
Exactly
That's okay
Or did I put too much?
I think it's too much
Is it gonna kill me?
No it's not
Just try it
Ah it's true
They don't eat with this
Okay I'm going to try it
First without
The spice
So I can see
The original flavor
It's an interesting taste
This doesn't taste like anything
I have ever tried in my life
It's edible
It's edible
It's good
It's good
Like it looks like
Carne de res guisada
And then I was expecting that it was gonna taste
Like carne de res guisada
It's sweeter
Yeah it's sweeter but it also has an Asian
Something
Like an Asian touch
Soy sauce
Do they have soy sauce in the reparation?
Yes
And the calamansi
We don't have calamansi
That's why we use soy sauce
I feel like
All the salty food
From the Philippines
They are sweet also
Like you cook
Sweet food
I don't know how to explain it
But you have tried sinigang right?
Sinigang is
It's sour
Sour
It tastes even better
I know
I'm tasting the best version
From the beginning
I put the sauce
I'm tasting the best version
I want to try it
Oh
Sol and I
Have to try the bone marrow now
What do I do like?
Usually we put the bone marrow
Into the pares
So you scoop on it
I think that's what we're gonna do
Scoop on it
This is really happening
I don't really eat this
That's pure fats
Am I gonna gain weight because this is pure fats?
If you're not eating it everyday
You're not hot
A little
Okay
I'm happy that we did
What do you do?
It tastes like pure fats
They ask you how you are
You just have to say that you're fine
When you're not really fine
But like
It's so greasy that I
I don't like it
My turn
Oh my god yeah
I just feel like you're eating oil
Exactly
Right now I took a scoop of oil
And I like it
And we don't have more rice
I'm definitely not buying bone marrow
Again
In my life
But it was interesting
Because like I saw it
And I was like well this is something I have never
Tried in my life
I should do that
I should try that
And if I did
In this sauce
I can
I have permission
He has permission
Thank you
Do you like jalape침o?
Yes
Okay
Thank you
You can order now

What we do in CC

Video game
She's teaching us a lot too
Yes
We have so much to learn
About life here
Music

Essentially, it's the same thing.
And yes, I still like it.
Actually, this one tastes better.
Huh?
Mmm.
Really?
It has more flavor.
I don't know.
Do you like the other one?
One of them.
Because the pork in the other one was crispy.
Mmm.
And that gives it like a texture.
Because it was like chicharron.
It was like that.
Yeah.
It gave it a nice taste, texture.
This is good.
I feel like it's really good.
Very easy.
Let's see how the texture is.
I can't believe they ate everything.
How's Maryam feeling?
Hungry.
She should try the jalape침o.
Finally gonna eat the jalape침o, guys.
It's really melty.
Oy.
I thought it was ube ice cream.
Yes.
It was.
And past the scar.
This is really pepper.
Is this pepper?
Oh no, that's langka.
What is langka?
I'm worried.
It's like fruits.
Fruit.
Yeah, it's like fruits.
That's langka.
Give me one of the spoons.
Ah.
I didn't see it because
it was not featured in the camera or something like that.
So what does the halo halo have?
What is this?
That's ube.
Oy.
That's ube and this is?
That's ube ice cream.
So there's ube and ube ice cream.
You just have to mix it.

It's something crispy.

And then there's also buko.
What is this?

You can taste it.
Buko is kakona.
Kakona, yes.
Well, we mixed it and it looks weird now.
Yeah, it looks weird.
Because it melted.
Thank you.
It tastes like.
Like?
These frozen yogurt places
that you put a lot of toppings.
Sweet pro.
Uh-huh, there she goes.
But less sweet.
And it has like crispy rice.
Thank you.
Ah, I think there's a little chicken.
I will try one with toppings.
There are a lot of fruits, a lot of things
that we have never seen in our lives before.
The milk is very powerful based on the milk and the fruit.
I don't think it's a bad thing.
So what's your rating from 1 to 10?
Let me try this fruit.
It's good.
It's good.
It's good.
It's good.
It's good.
It's good.
It's good.
It's good.
It's good.
So weird.
Weird, weird, weird.
Wait, what are you thinking about?
It's for you.
I want to taste it.
But I don't want to taste it at all.
I don't want to taste it.
I want a taste of it.
There's more.
No, that's the only one.
No, that's small.
That's different.
That's ube.
Blanc.
Blanc.
Not bad.
Right?
Eat it all.
Not a fan?
I don't know what it tastes like.
Because you have never tasted this.
It tastes like nothing.
What?
I don't know.
Oh, it has an after taste.
Do you like the taste of it?
I haven't tried this either, so I don't know what to think.
It tastes a little bit like that.
I have no idea what it tastes like.
How do you describe that taste?
On my lips.
I don't know how to say it in Spanish.
It's cashew.
I don't know.
I don't feel like I like it.
Like I thought I was going to like it.
I am very contrariado.
How does it taste like?
I don't know if it is because it got melted.
But it is too watery.
I thought it was going to be more like ice cream.
But everything is watery.
It just tastes like milk.
With a lot of things on it.
Which you don't like.
When you are drinking milk, you don't like
the things coming out.
I don't know.
Maybe you are just not used to it.
Yeah.
Because sometimes it is weird.
How about balut?
Have you tried balut?
No.
And I want to.
Do you want to try balut?
Not because I am already full.
Yeah, you should try it next time.
I like the ube ice cream.
I prefer the tajo.
Is that from your country?
No, from your country.
What is tajo?
It is tajo.
It is tajo.
What is tajo?
Tajo.
It is like tofu.
Yeah, the tofu.
With the arnival.
With the arnival and then
with the barrel.
I don't know what that is.
That is sago.
It is delicious compared to this.
This tastes like water
with milk and
ingredients.
Me too because
I thought it was going to taste like
more ice cream.
We had to change our coffee name.
It is going to be Bayo Tajo.
I think this is it for the vlog today.
