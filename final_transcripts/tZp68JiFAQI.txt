Are you going to wait for your board? I'm going to the beach. by 2013... Are you going to wait over here? You can take another one. It's mine. It's all rich guys and we are waiting at the hospital like one hour and thirty minutes before we'll hit the one. That's mine. I think this is mine. This is mine. Okay, so this is my order. I ordered both beef. I'm going to take a look at the back. I'm going to take a look at the back. We know what I'm doing here. We just finished eating at the pubway. We are here at McDonald's because we'll see the one at McDonald's. He doesn't like the pubway. He wants to eat chicken and rice. Do you want to eat chicken and rice? Okay, he wants to eat chicken and rice. So, hi guys. We just want to talk about the food. We're going to eat the beef for the clinic. We need to start with that. Okay, so, I think the one's going to explain everything. It's a bad word. In case you don't know who's word is, that is this woman's son, only child. He has some of those problems, which is polyps. He has polyps. He was born with that. He's got a lot of problems. He's got a lot of problems. He's got a lot of problems. He's got a lot of problems. He's got a lot of problems. He's got a lot of problems. He's got a lot of problems. He's got a lot of problems. He's got a lot of problems. He's got a lot of problems. He's got a lot of problems. Who's that? He's got a lot of problems. He's got a lot of problems. I don't know what he's going to say. I don't know if he gave you that. No, he just... Oh, I don't know. So anyways, he's just this. He has to use two drops each in Australia. But he said once a day, but we tell him twice a day. You know, it's supposed to be only for a month or two months. But I think we'll continue because we see that this thing has helped him. He still has those blockages sometimes, not all the time like before. Like before he was quite bad. So I think this is working. So we're going to stick to it. Let's see what happens. Otherwise, the last resort to this thing is clip surgery. Clip it. Yeah. So, like the mama said, we'll see. We will see what happens. Otherwise, when he grows up, then we'll think about surgery. Right now, because his body, his frame is not that strong. I don't want any side effects or anything. So that's why I said no. Medicine, keep trying medicine. Hopefully it will work for him. So we're going to try this medicine for two months, at least as the doctor said. And yeah, and if it's not in work, then... He cut his nose. That's the last option, guys, that... Well, she's going to have a sore. You're going to cut it. So yeah, and then... Why don't we just, you know, before when he has no smell? Yeah, he still has no smell. Yeah. He has no sense of smell. Not at all. He cannot smell at all. Good or bad, he cannot. Yeah. He cannot smell, so that's why. Even his breath, you know, he's breathing sometimes to his mouth. That's why his lips always dry. So yeah, we've been suffering this for, I think, three years. Him? No, more. He was born with it, so of course. Well, he was born with it, but then before it's not that bad. It's only this few years, like, three years, like, you know, he always coming out, like, a lot, coming out from his nose. And sometimes he cannot, you know, like, he doesn't feel that he's something coming out from his nose. So that's why, you know, it's like, especially when he goes to school last two years ago, the classmate is always complained to the teacher that, well, it is, you know, trying to... He's done. There's them, but we already did a signal, so he does know that something coming out from his nose, so he's not it's fault. But, yeah, we just, you know, explain to the teacher that he has some problem from his nose. So yeah, we'll let you know, guys, what happened? What happened is, you know, it took out, it took a moment. It took a moment. But nose. So yeah, so thank you. That's it for today's vlog, and thank you so much for watching and see you another one. Bye. Bye. Bye. I wish I could remove you from my mind. And now you say, oh, I can't miss her, you see? You're here to stay. I tried to reach. I didn't mean to never wait. You're not around anywhere. I tried to be. But I feel you. And now you say, oh, I can't miss her. A few moments later. So my sister is studying very hard. She's studying 6 o'clock in the morning. She's answering her assignment. So you wake up 6 o'clock, yeah? We call it young because her name is young, young, nickname, young. So Jaya also, she's an online class. Show, kill it. So they are in the same grade 12. And of course, well, she's also very busy watching his favorite movie. He's very... He's very... Yeah, he's very serious. He's been watching this for how many days already. I like when you look for a kind of one. You guys nobody has only one choice. So they're gone now. Now open the window. And buy them. And buy them.
