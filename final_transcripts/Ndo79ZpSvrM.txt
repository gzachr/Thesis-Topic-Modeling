 Mabu! Hi! Lovely broskies and babeskies! Today, we are at... Intramuros! Muro, baby! The broskies is getting cultural today with intramuros. This is the most historical, ancient place in the whole of Manila. And we really felt that we should get cultured today, baby! Stop number one on our Manila historical quest. This beautiful church. Have a look at this place. This guy is trying to sell us a hat. Okay, so I've just been reading this cathedral has had some very bad luck. In 1581 it was built in 1582. It was... You can do it, Riki. You can do it. It was damaged by typhoon. And one year later, in 1583, it was destroyed by fire. What bad luck can you have? Alright guys, our first destination for the big cultural broskie day is Fort Santiago. We are inside a ready-to-game. We are stuck in with our kids. And cultural! We are stuck in with our tickets. We just got tickets that we are stuck in with. So sweet. Intramuros Santiago style. Intriguos Santiago, intramuros. Where we at? Rafa! Such a troubled child. This kid only knows the way of the road. That is actually really cool street art. What is it? I think it might be the face of a man. Really cool, I like the colors. It's a picture. I like the pictures. I'm starting to see the main gate of Fort Santiago. We are in the Fort Santiago. It looks like a little paradise. It's really cool. It's actually really, really nice. Dude, it has like all the really ancient ruins and like a lot of grass and trees. It's like an ancient garden. Yeah, like an ancient little paradise. It's in the center of the city. But it's away from all the noise. It's extremely quiet. You can just come here when you want to get away from everything. Oh, you're right. You are crazy. What do you mean you know that? Jazz found a new friend, guys. It doesn't like me anymore. You guys still like me, right? Don't tell him, he'll tell a bit. But you're a bit of friend that he's ever been. Guys, what did he say? Jazz, come with me, bro. How am I a good idea? I'm taking Jazz to a very special place. I did a cool place. Yeah, it's cool, isn't it, bro? Alright, guys. I seem to have lost jazz. Don't know where you went. So let's do this. What was the one broski show? Come on, let's go. So we're going to check out this amazing view from all the way up here. It's the Pussy Grimoire, guys. This is actually a really cool view. I like this. Look at all the old ships. What an incredible view, guys. That is so awesome. We saw those kids jumping in from the boats into the water. Absolutely. Thank you, bro. I was so cute, bro. Yeah, did a kobanga. And we saw some really, really cool Manela boats. Like, surrounded by tires and stuff. That's really cool, guys. You guys know how to make a cool back. Nobody in the world knows how Fort Santiago came about. Some people think that it might have been aliens that placed us here as a way of communicating with modern-day men. And that one day they will return to test whether we have gotten their message and were able to answer their questions. But that's just our theory. What is your theory? All right, Ruski. I think that was the answer to the question the aliens left us. And I think it was a pretty sweet answer. I think we gave a very good answer and I think we might have just saved the world. All right, guys. We're just out of Fort Santiago. And now we are going to the Japanese torture chamber. Hello, Jini. How's it going? Good? Very good. Very good. It's a very, very nice Lamborghini. You can start to realize that we're entering the really old part now. So much old colonial architecture and it's just a whole rich area, man. It's cool. It's very cozy, you know. The European coziness. It makes me feel right at home. Right, we found a nice little sitting spot in ancient Europe in Manila. Hi, sir. Hello. Welcome to Interimoros. That's Jerry. Jerry is taking care of us today. Yes, sir. We have also a hello, hello inside the banana, dark food, food, and all the type of ice cream. I think I should try a hello, hello, hello. What's best, hello? Hello, hello. Is it going to be a two? I think this is the perfect idea for us to try a hello, hello baby. It's incredible. Okay, that looks... wow. Incredible. All right, we have some purple stuff. Oh my god. It's a very, very strange flavor. I have no idea what that is. Yes. There's other green thing. Wow. That looks strange. Again, I have no idea what that is. What do you guys put in these hallowed hallowed? It's some mystery. Red thing. Again, don't know what the flavor is. Don't know what that thing is. Oh, look at that. It's a fruit, I think. Banana. Yeah. Banana. Yeah. It was just really nice. Yeah. Super refreshing, yeah. It's like ice cream with shaved ice and like some jelly things and all sorts of other great stuff. Getting a hello, hello. Is getting like a delicious mystery box in a glass. I'm very curious after jazz experience, so let's dig in. I tell you it's really familiar, it's really nice. It's so colorful, man. It's like you're eating a rainbow. I need to try this purple stuff because I've seen this in all the pictures and I'm like, what the hell is that purple stuff? I think I know what the purple stuff is, man. I think it is taro. That you have taro milky. What do you think? That is very strange. It's shallow, I guess. Philippines, this just shows me how incredibly creative you guys are. Who comes up in this? This is like the most creative drink I've ever seen. It's very strange. I didn't expect it to be like this, but I'm a fan. It's a very interesting flavor. For Europeans, this is like a really strange mix of stuff. Here's the green tea. Cheers guys. Bye bye. Hello, hello. We are now setting course for the Japanese torture chamber. Guys, we've been in prison, in Manila. We almost got captured ourselves. But we escaped and now we are on our way to the Japanese garden or fort or torture chamber. Whatever it is, it's got to be pretty dank-ish. Pretty dank-ish, all the fences, man. Guys, we have arrived in the gardens of Eden of Manila. This is real paradise. This is the silence, tranquility, balance of the life forces. It's beautiful. All the ingredients of paradise have perfectly been poured into these gardens. And now the two broski's walking up. We have to choose which way and which path we must take. Who knows where we should go. I do not know, Anita does count. But do you know? Alright, this way. This is really a little paradise. This is the place to be. Manila. Let's go. And the breeze. And this beautiful little paradise. You have the green and the old ruins. In the background you have the modern cityscape of Manila. And the two complement each other perfectly creating a little work of art for the eye to the whole. What a beautiful, beautiful day it was. In intra muros. Epic adventures, lots of exploring.
