We listed that a few days ago We can also link it at the end of this video as well Part two very in the description. Yeah But this is by casual Chuck shot out to casual Chuck He creates insane content on Filipinos SB19 and a bunch of other stuff So go check his channel out give him a like and subscribe With that being said, let's jump in What is it about Filipino talents that make them stand up? Here's the thing Philippines in particular We've seen it with Korea with K-pop and I guarantee you in the next five years There's gonna be some superstars come from Asia and that's what's gonna happen True, thank you. Thank you. It's true. It's just a fact. It means a lot Filipinos are known for their talent They're also known to be one of the most competitive people in the world So Pinot myself I grew up watching different amateur beauty pageants sports singing and dancing competitions Let me tell you that those battles they can get pretty intense and because of that Competitors pushing themselves really hard sometimes hard enough that they reach not just a national level talent Okay, I got it. But also stand out as one of the best in the world Aspen 19 fits those criteria I can easily say that all of them are talented But you can't deny that some of them have got different talents like stale's vocals And can't see even he was impressed But they also have extremely skilled members and Justin Josh and Pablo who equally contributes through the creative side of things Exceptional dancing and inventive songwriting Skills that they didn't acquire on the get go but to rigorous years of training They practice dance routines 1000 times before they even performed them in public and in their humble beginnings They didn't even mind performing for nobody since no one knew them back then They even got criticized in their own whole country But that didn't stop them from becoming the now full of people The reason was like their own country kind of didn't like them and wasn't supporting them and so but now I think they've kind of captured some of their flip the script Now they've captured some of their people and audience over there but at the beginning it was it was not a lot of people were rude to them The nurse they started making waves maybe coming the first Pinoy pop group that broke a record in the Billboard charts SB19's Bazinga spends a record breaking seventh week Single surpasses the six-week run of BTS's butter They were also the first Filipino artists to have performed in a major US TV Network and proceeded to have the nationwide concert tour in that country At this point there's no denying the fact that SB19 has already established their place in the Pinoy music industry By not just expanding its reach but also boosting Philippines for risk it's quite evident by looking at these amazing Trilovs I mean look at us now. I mean I know now that everybody's been so cool on our channel from the Philippines And I mean everybody's been pretty cool to us in almost every single country Cosic Stan Russia Philippines Korea Japan everybody's been very nice However, the Philippines has really grown on us for the last couple of months really welcoming You know been talking about you know come over here and visit you come check it out.

They even made an appearance in Hollywood in a popular dance movie franchise called Step Up Yeah In 2021, 80% of the Philippines and the yearly YouTube fanfests together with S-queen 19 and also have done multiple collaborations with them What I really like about these types of performers are their songs, visuals and dance breaks But did you know that another Pinoy artist had already been utilizing dance breaks in the early 2000s? Oh Enter Billy Crawford In my opinion this dude has got to be one of the most underrated Filipino artists ever Barely does anyone get the credit he deserves anymore Most people only see him as some goofy guy with a few dance moves But little did they know that one of his greatest achievements was being able to perform with the king of pop himself Michael Jackson You It's so unreal thinking that they actually practice together and even had some cool interactions In the floor, they put their arcades in the floor because they have schools that they can play I was in school and I was going to do a dance show So I was like, I'm going to make it to my own I was like, wait, wait, wait, I'm going to make it to my own Uh, excuse me, I'm going to make it to my own Because if you're going to make it to my own, you're going to make it to my own No, um, hi, my name is Michael and I just want to tell you that there are better games on that side I'm like, I'm just like normal I just need to be able to do it Fun or off This experience inspired Billy to pursue a career in show business He started releasing songs I've heard Billy Crawlpress before Even landed an interesting role in Hollywood in one of those exorcist movies Don't ever touch me with that again, please And did you know that Billy actually sent the iconic Pokemon theme song in its first movie? No way Oh my god, dude That's him You remember listening to that back in the day?
