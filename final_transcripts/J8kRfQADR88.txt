 Okay, wait, for all Filipinos, I have you to go to the question. Please help me. Okay, so if you want to say, you are my friend, you can say, kai bikan kita. And if you want to say, you are my wife, you would say, asawa kita. Pero, if you want to say, you are my love, you cannot say mahal kita, you would say, ikaw ang mahal ko. So... Vakit! You are my friend, is kai bikan kita. You are my wife, is asawa kita. But if you say mahal kita, that does not mean you are my love, it means I love you. So... Vakit, I don't understand. Someone please explain in the comments.
