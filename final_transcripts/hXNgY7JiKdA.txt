 Time to go camping and check on the caramans the after two months. You can start gays. I can look at power lines and coconut trees and... What? That out. Yes, that out. Which are usually weird but he did it. We are. It's been exactly... It's been exactly two months since we did the planting. So when he's got there, inventory how many have actually died and then use the ones from the nursery to replant. Bye bye Lily. See you tomorrow. Bye bye. We've got a quick pit stop in Tagham first because there's a couple of things to fix. Amigo. On time no secret. No one. I'm going to go. Oh, it's time to go. I'm going to go to the forest. What are you doing? I'm going to go to the forest. Oh, I'm going to go there. I'm going to go to the forest. Okay. A big parking one and spare man. I'm feeling like a two-wheel. I'm like, expiring at an old man. Oh, model nice and ligged. So that one there actually, it was a few days ago but I was up in the bouquet. Came around a corner on the concrete. The other side was murdy. I didn't realise they put the metal plates up on the concrete. I thought I was able to fit and then in the end one of them was stuck out in it's slice of the wheel. It's a pain in the backside but it says a lot about this tyre. It didn't burst. Side wall damage can be critical but this one kind of went halfway through the top layer. Still, I could keep burning on it but it's not good practice really. And it's credit to these tyres that it burst. I was able to get it back to that bow and actually I was able to get it here. I did a little fix on it. Stuffed some rubber in it. Actually the vulcanising guy said, yeah, it's a light but can't go bent. I'm hungry. Yeah, we need to get food. So you don't turn that one. Like that. But these guys can always work it out. But we're not done here yet. We're also attaching this light bar which I haven't actually had installed yet. Simply because the wiring was missing in the first time. This one of course, I'm going to have to cover it up because when we go on the public roads... Ah well. How you doing? These ones are developed in Australia. They're a stranger nighthawk. Lots of random words I'm throwing at you. But you can really control the intensity of this. You control the direction. You can diffuse it. There's a lot of options for these. That's what's great. They're good for any kind of real difficult off-road situation. Like what I was saying with the RFC last week is they're great for recovery as well. A lot of recoveries are at night. There we go, Zah! I've seen a day in Australia. I thought it's good. I'm actually full up enough and I'm actually ready to do something. Thank you! Mac and Ago San. This is the farm where we planted 2500 karamansi trees two months ago. The question is, how are they doing now? So you came here how long ago? Less than a month? March 16, 17. You can check it on my... Three, four weeks ago and they cut the grass right? So they cut the grass and removed the bananas and the battle we have is with nature and a very strong wet season in that this grass is coming back. Some of these have died. I'm not on the shore on the total percentage, but I think we're looking around 10% mortality. The others seem to be settling. Some of them I'll show you a few of them. Some of them look like they've died but they actually come back. Others not so much. Most of the mortality I can see though is concentrated in this area which was the second day where we didn't really get the good seedlings. They were quite small. Let's take a look at this one. This one looks like it's died but it's come back. So the old branches are really died all off and they come back. They have just died, died. Some of them were. But a lot of them are coming back. You can see again this one here coming back with new leaves. That one, for example, taking over by weed spite. Some of them will. This is of course within a midnight so there's never 100%. But mostly, mostly this other life. And now it's that time in between seasons now. So we're coming into when it's going to be drier which is actually great to these because the roots won't rot. This part mentally is one of the most difficult because of course they're rooting. A lot of the growth right now is happening under the ground so you can't see it. And it's very difficult to see. Oh, there's not much progress. It looks like that. Because right now they're just rejuvenating themselves. Adapt into their new environment. This is the struggle we have against weeds but it's going to get easier the next few months because it'll be dry. It'll still rain a bit. But not massively. This grass won't be a huge problem. We're going to come back here a little bit later. So I want to have a look at the nursery now. I feel there's been some mortality in the nursery as well. So I really want to have a look. And yeah, I'm starting to replace some of the dead ones. I want to get those in the ground just as much as possible. Let's have a look. We need much more dead in the nursery. The conditions there are much more suitable. The water drains more easily. These ones here I need to get the planted really. But let's go back to the farm because we're going to sleep there tonight. Hey, get out of here. What's that? I'm going to miss it. That's why you're going to open this up every few months. I'm going to wash this tomorrow. I'm going to use this bit. Actually, there's a little pocket for my thingies up here. My thingies, my slippers, that one. And it still smells fresh. I'm going to use it for two months. It still smells very fresh. This flinders rooftop tent is not just waterproof, but it's got good air flow too. You can actually just be open overnight. It clippin' very, very nicely. I can open the roof. The roof is on fire. Let's open the roof. Let's open up the roof. You can stargaze. I can look at power lines and coconut trees and sky. It's awesome. Amiz Mosquito net always coming handy. That's easy. This is my first time to climb here, guys. Guys is bowel on my channel. Oh, sorry. I'm this scary. It carries me. Oh, yeah. Hi. Do you like it? Good for the fear of ours. It could. It could fit nearly as well. Lily would say, are you? You love it up there. Yeah, too, but I don't have some goods here to sell. What are you doing? I did too. Side line. Side line. No. Oh, if you want some light or... USB music. We have the booked sound. We don't need music. Well, too much. That art, isn't it? I don't know where I put the cable somewhere. Where I'm on earth that is. But you can charge it off the car. All I need and there's a perfect space for it just underneath here. I need a cable because I need a stove. And if I had a one of those giant power banks. However, I don't have that. And this is the way to live life. And a coffee. I don't drink coffee. Hi, dude. Music Hi. Oh, morning. It was cold. I had to close everything up. Morning, guys. How well, guys. Morning. I was just sleepy. Medigable. You know what, you know what? Having an instant meal in the past couple of days. But this one is quite a bit better. This one's soft, no? No. This one is always asleep and it's big. It's a different environment. Mmm. Mmm. That's why. And it's much more quiet. It's so quiet. You can just hear the birds. Yeah. The birds. Ah. Hi. It's very cold here. Oh. Especially in the light. Oh, no need for electric fan. No need for an oven. Yeah. I'm so, I know. Yeah. Here, gone. That was nice. And I bet the viewer here's nice, but I'm too lazy to open the window, so. Music Nice view. I opened it up. Music All the way now. I should have been sensible and like bought something to heat water with and all that kind of stuff. I didn't. So, let's find a cabin there. That old camping. Time to return to my old suki. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Go on in. Go on in it. Huh? In it. Go on in. Try to hang out. Oh. Good bye for now. Agustin. And just like that leaving the simple life camping behind a simple life, where did that come from? Simple. We're going back to Davao already because it's just a quick trip. Check up on stuff. Sort stuff out and then the people who needed to speak to weren't there. So, that's life. It's my birthday tomorrow. I'm getting old. I'm going to be on the car end door. Be on the car end door. Be on the car end door. What's that 30? More than that. 30 is the end of the car end door. 31. But yeah, okay. So, my car end is ending as well. Yeah. My car end door. I'm old. My car end door. I'm old. I'm expired. I'm expired too. Good. I'm expired too. Good. I'm expired too. Good. Come on. Have a good one. Back to Davao to celebrate each of my expiration date. There we go to Davao. Did you have some problems? That was. Bannos. Hey. Hey. Hey. I'm only a half-bomb. I'm only a half-bomb. I'm only a half-bomb. Hello. Hello. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Thank you. Hey. What am I doing? I'm disjointed. Last couple of vlogs have been random. Disjointed bits of life that have somehow come together into some sort of possible. Thing don't know what's going on. Tomorrow I'm actually heading back up to Manila and continuing where I left off in Luzon and then the Messiah. So that's going to be exciting. That's good. I promise to clean it. I haven't yet. Because I can't open this up because there's a big wire here. Telecoms. Hi. Can you fix this for me? Please. I'm going to fix this for you. I'm going to fix this for you. I'm going to fix this for you. I'm going to fix this for you. I'm going to fix this for you. I'm going to fix this for you. I'm going to fix this for you. Please. Hi. I telecoms. Hey, I'll be... This stuff's awesome. Actually, suspension's great. Actually, this package is really... As I've said before, it's really, really good. Got it. If you're down in Mind and I've tagged them rigs. They're awesome. If you're up in Manila, gears are the guys who do this. They're fantastic. I've said it a few times before. But they really are fantastic. So... If you want good performance, something for off-roading, something for camping and enjoying. They know how to do it. Make the most of these vehicles, you know? Using for something good. Always use things for good. And enjoy life because it's way, way, way too short because I'm expiring already. See you next time.
