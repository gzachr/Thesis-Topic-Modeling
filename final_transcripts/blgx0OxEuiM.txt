 Today we're headed to the Philippines. Let's do it. Let's do it. All right, let's go. Yeah, let's do it. Um, now we're checking out different malls. Yes. In the Philippines. Different shopping malls. Yeah. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's get right into it. Wait, before we get into it, I should probably pull the video up. Oh, there it is. There we go. All right, let's get it right now. Okay. I love we've heard that the Philippines has some of the largest malls in the world. And just down the road. Did you know that? I don't know. I don't know. And the 11th largest mall in the world. In the world. There's over six shops here. Over 200 restaurants to eat all of Asia. Oh my gosh. We have to go check it out because I think this is going to be the biggest shopping center we've ever been in. So it seems like this shopping complex is like made up of all these things. Oh, that's sweet. Between them are these little outdoor alleyways which are same for our favorite spots. And there is so much food. Like everywhere you look, this is another food vendor. So we're looking online and we know that this mall on average a day gets over 200,000 people visiting it. I refused to go to my lunch. What? What? Shopping center of Christmas time. This place is just so many visitors. 200,000 people a day? That's huge. Dang. Oh my gosh. Look at that. That's pretty cool. Oh, that looks good. Wow. So just come down to a restaurant right near the border with seafood island. And here they say something that's very Filipino. They call it a brutal fight. And back in the day during the Philippines, the whole they would do with the Filipinos is the military with the Rostigdana geese at one beach table and they'll be these big binarmalees and the middle table and then all the food and then our whole share kind of like show them their camaraderie and then working together. That's pretty cool. Yeah. It's like a certain food culture. Oh, that's cool. That's a cool history too. Yeah. Garlic rice, garlic, benghis belly, grilled squid, sauteed mussels, skin oil, squid, and grilled beef. What's a benghis belly? Steamed crab and salad egg menga, gambus, laying mixed seafood, binocled, and crispy julang. Wow. Which means when you realize you've probably ordered too much food. Well, these are for three to four people because they didn't eat the food. That's quite the platter. That's for two. But we need to try a food. They need to do a bootle for two. So it's for two. Dig in. This is so cool. It's like, it's so good. Garlic rice. This interactive meal. I wish we had something like this in Australia. Yeah. So good, by the way. Wow. Is that shrimp? Looks like it. So this here, it's pretty much Filipino style ceviche. Wow, it sounds like it's busy there doesn't it? Yeah. It's so fresh though. I hear some music back there. Something we've been really excited to try is the benghis belly. It's like a Filipino specialty fish. Oh, that's so good. Steve, it's like a sharp grilled fish. Yeah. Um, that's probably a good fish. I need to say this. It's barbecue. It's a fish. I thought there's an arena here and they currently playing Disney on ice. An arena in the mall? It's weird to go. Wow. Oh my gosh. It's in the mall. That's in the mall. Oh my gosh, guys. That was so good. That was only five dollars and it was like a full on two hours. My box. Like they would react to my dollars. Yeah, five dollars. On the ice. And that's my, is that you know what they're ice skating now? Found out there. Have an ice skating ring here in the mall. What? Optimus order. That's sweet. Wow. In the mall. That's so far. And we're basically just in your life right now. You could just go to the mall and do everything. Yeah. I saw an iMac's theater. Was there? Yeah. They got all those restaurants. They have an arena. They have a place you can skate. That looks so fun. Yeah, it's awesome. Plus all the shopping too. Yeah, true. Wow, it's right on the water. That's nice. In the front of the shopping center, there's this giant theme park. And I think it's all over the place. Yeah, there's like everything there. Please watch the sunset. That's so cool. That's so nice. We just missed the sun. It's just gone beyond the horizon. But still, this isn't what I was expecting to be doing to see our first sunset here at the Philippines. Wow. So you're a whole house that we're carnival. Yeah. Yeah, that name, where it's like, you say you're flying, but you're not really. I asked you how you were in the mall. You're flying. You just can't get into it because they would never understand. Oh my god. I hate this bit. For the top. This is the best bit. This shows you guys just how big it is. You got building one, two, three, four, five. Pretty sure that building number six, because you can see all the time. That's like all parking. The arena is just over there. And there's a bunch of heryels around as well. Wow. Oh wait, the arena was over there. I thought it was inside them all. So it's like, it's like right next to it. Next room? You have to just throw it. It's like all, it's like all the mall. It's like a district. Wow, they look so nice. Yeah. Look at that. I decided we want to check out what the prices are like here in the middle of. So we're going to a store that is basically like every country we go to. Patient. I'm going to check the prices for you guys. Are they basically like Australian prices? So not cheaper, but still. There's a lot of shops to choose from. Three level. Chocolate milk tea with pearls. Usually I get like the ice tea bubble tea with tea bubble tea. That's so good. The time is end of the day and a melting day. The steam has never had a milk tea. Bubble tea. I love bubble tea. You don't like it, it's not too hot. I don't like it. It's a little snack. I like the honey-dew milk tea. That's my favorite. That's your go-to. Alrighty guys, we've left them all and come back to our room to freshen up. If you were interested, we're saying that the Kimberly Hotel Manila is a pretty good location. There's a nice, that was so quick. That's so quick. I was really curious about that. Yeah, we could watch more on that for sure. Yeah, like what stores are in there? Yeah. What? Just more of the attractions? Yeah, we should watch more videos on that. We should. That was really cool. Yeah. Should we pull it, pull something up? Sure, what can we find? Let's see, Mollavasia maybe. Or just big shopping malls. In the Philippines. Oh, Mollavasia. What do you think of this? Yeah, it looks like a lot of these are vlogs. I wonder if we could find like just like a information about it. Just like the Mollavasia? Hmm. I don't know. It's a mall tour. Yeah, these are a lot of like vlogs. Yeah. It looks huge. Yeah, it does. Yeah, I wonder if there's a video out there just like a fax or something. Yeah, let us know in the comments. Let us know in the comments. And so I'm below what would be the next best video to check out? Yeah, definitely. That was really cool. That was cool. Yeah, that was huge. I mean, I lost my pride. Did you get a nice or $5? Yeah, wait. The prices for Disney and Ice here are like through the roof. Yeah, through the roof. And that view was nice too. They had like a whole carnival outside. Yeah, the sunset on the top of the road. The upper cars, everything. Great, the mall. Yeah, how fun. Ice skating at the mall. I wonder how like is that open all year round? I'm guessing. Oh, well, I don't know. That's the majority of the weather in the Philippines I wonder. Is it like primarily hot all the time? I honestly don't know. I honestly don't know. Oh, let us know.
