So, this is the second time. So, red hair is the second time. It's different to grab a black person hair. Anyways, guys. So, we got to go up. Because Don Don has customers. And his colleague here. Hi. Very part of the new Dota Tracicos. It's so different. Maybe try cars. So different from the ones in Manila. And the shops here. All right, guys. So, that was a typical Filipino hair caught right there. And yeah. It was so interesting to see how Filipinos caught a Bob Africans hair or black people hair. Because it's different hair. Actually, it's different hair. So, after I take shower, then I'm going to fix my hair. Yeah. So, yeah. It was interesting, man. I like it. So, there's a police station here. I just saw the name of it. Two raised police station. Yeah. You have to sit. And here is where you get motorcycles. So, if you want to run a motorcycle or you have a police station right here, there are a lot of motorcycle rentals here. And you will see this market right here. You can also just buy anything from this market. Especially if you want to buy a souvenir, you can buy it right here. All right, let's see. It's so full. 150 pesos. That was the hair caught. And my girlfriend said it was the first time seeing that. I was an experienced. Seeing my hair paid for Filipinos. I wouldn't expect that. Okay. What did you expect? Well, Filipinos don't use the blade. They don't use the blade in Finland. How do you use it? Or the machine? But either in Africa, we use the blade in a room. A very small room. And the blade. And the guys will do like this. They will do like this. And they also use the blade. So, if your hair is very long, most of them use the blade. They are so creative. They are so talented. And they also use the blade to ship the blade. The V-later. We call it the V in Africa. Yeah. So, I'm used to that already. But Filipinos, most times they use machines. But there are places in Africa that use machines. A lot of places just feed by the shop. Like the real locals want. The real local by the shop. They use the blade. They use the barbell like I want the blade. And it will use the blade. For us, it's much easier. I think it's accurate. The blade is accurate when you want the blade to ship the hair. It's accurate. And the machine. Yeah. For us, that's how we kill. So, most times we love people to use the blade. I try to start. But yeah, anyways guys, that's how we come to the end of today's video. So, that was a 150 pesos later. I'm going to convert it to dollars. That would be about $3. If the rate is 50. Alright, so, that would be about $3. I can be sure I'm going to convert it to the current rate. And tell you how much in US. And you're going to see that on the thumbnail. Alright, let's listen to the man once again. It's your both success. And thanks for watching this video. Till this fight, I love you guys. And the next one from El Nido. We've got rocks coming from El Nido. So, hope to see you in the next one.
