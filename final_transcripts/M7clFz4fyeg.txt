 The Filipino Bamboo Cannon, the Long Taka, a day of explosion. So if you were like, oh, another Philippines reaction, what are we gonna get today? A Bamboo Cannon! Yes, obviously. I mean, it's a logical thing. You know, we just reacted to some universities were getting a knowledge on that. Some certain islands, you know, a guide in Manila. Then the cannon. Dude, it's crazy to me. It's like in America, like everybody has gone. So in the Philippines, everyone just has a Bamboo Cannon. I mean, yeah, that's... I didn't know. Do you guys have your equivalent of the second amendment? But it's you're allowed to bear Bamboo. It's the first amendment there as well. Filipinos have the right to bear Bamboo in any capacity they want. And little did their constitution know that it would be turned into a cannon. But it's still okay because it's in the constitution. Exactly. Philippines. Another reaction, hopefully you enjoy. If you do subscribe, like the video. We got tons of stuff on the channel. We got tons of stuff on our other channels too, our main channel, where we react to SB19 and other Filipino musical artists. And our vlog channel, where we've been trying, we're about to be trying some Filipino Boads in Dubai. And we actually just booked our tickets. We're flying out to the Philippines. I don't know when this video was posted, but we're up in like a month and a half probably. And we're gonna be building our own Long Taka. So, you gotta subscribe to that vlog channel so you can see the Dubai stuff and the Philippines stuff. If you DM us on Instagram, we can shoot the Long Taka at your house. Yes, give us your address. Let's do it. Here we go. I think that's a second video in a row we asked for people's address. Hopefully people are not gonna comment anything. That would be great for you. Oh my god! That would be good. What's going on here? What the heck is going on here? Okay. All right. That's a piece of bamboo. If you didn't know it yet, we're gonna make a land taco, which is a ginormous Filipino-style bamboo bazooka thing. It's a bazooka thing. The heck this random Canadian guy gets... Who's gonna build cannons with us? Wait, are you sure he's Canadian? Oh, true. It is pretty hard. It may just look like a Hawaiian now, but it's gonna be a bazooka. So is this. Top big knife. That's actually... Kauaian's actually okay to chop with the bolo, works. Never heard of a bolo or a connion or whatever the phrase. He said those two words and I'm like, oh yeah. So literally after we chop down the kauaian, all my friend cookies gonna do now is gonna make a little hole in one end. It's gonna be like a... What are they gonna shoot out of it? No way, yeah. Coconut. So it's really thin in the middle. Oh, this is interesting, no? So you can see every single section of bamboo has kind of a casing in between. So we're gonna need a giant metal pole, we're just gonna slam all the way down to where we're gonna make the hole. So, see you. No, they should do. Because they should use another cannon to make the hole into that. Oh, yeah, they shoot the cannon into that cannon. Yeah, and then we'll just... But then we come to the dilemma, what came first? The chicken or the egg sort of thing where it's like, what came... What cannon came first? It's true. How would you make the first cannon? The cannon or the cannonball? Who knows? Now, see this goes east section. So you just hammering down east section. It's like gutting the pumpkin. But it's a bamboo and you're gonna turn it into... We can make a pumpkin cannon. We could try. Come in, we could do it for Fourth of July. How'd we sick? Probably make like a pumpkin bomb. Maybe not a cannon. Yeah, there it is. What was like bamboo? Yeah. Oh, cookie. They got us though. Rolling or socks, they got us though. You have to take all the moisture out of the Hawaiian before we can use it as a bazooka. That's John Hawaiian. So you think we're going to put it on there? Yeah. Can it? Nice. How are we going to put it on there? In the rap? Yeah. It's already seen some. So you got to reinforce the end. Because if we don't reinforce it, the kudos explode on us. Oh. How did this occur? I don't know more faces to make videos. I'm not sure. How did this occur? I don't know more faces to make videos. These guys are like... This guy just comes up and we're like, Hey guys, can you make me a cannon please? Just so energetic and happy all the time. I'm a Canadian. They just love that. We're basically Canadian. Kind of, yeah. We're right next to it. We can drive right up to Canada if we wanted to. And we're gonna be like, hey, I was like, oh, I'm going up here. Hey, you betcha. Up here in Canadian. I'm going to head back. There's some goods. Haha. All right, we did it. This is called Calboro. And it's calcium carbide. And this is what we're going to use to make this giant kind of cannon thing go. I don't know exactly how to do it. So cookie, let's do it. What do we do it? Let me do this. This one? Okay, so we're going to put one of these inside. Just drop it in. Yeah. Didn't watch. We take a bit of water. We put one of the stones in. One of the Calboro. We're going to put a bit of water in here. Honey, that's it. You can see it's foaming up and smoking. Hey, it'll be the water first. Like it. See, hold on, hold on. Not yet. You know what? That's it. Really? What the? Whoa. I got it for it. Oh my god. That would be good if it's saying. What the heck are you guys even hearing? Yeah. Oh, man. I want to shot a tube up for that. What the heck? That's crazy. That is crazy. Yeah, that's crazy. They just probably murdered. I'm not going to steer out there. There's no. No. No. We need to boycott this video now. They did. That was so loud. I could barely even hear right now. See that? That's a lot of smoke. Fire in the hall. The heck? Can you still go again? Woo! That was like, here's like an auto. What the heck? Oh my god. You're so energetic. Oh, nothing in a big muddle fly. So, yes. And if you put like a rock in it, you just watch the rock. Because nothing's coming out, because they're shooting it at the trees, and nothing's moving in the trees. That was not true. It's a natural freaking Philippines. It was a Zooka baby. Yeah. All right. Let's have one Lataka. No, we've three. We're friends in the front. Let's do it. Oh, oh, yeah. Oh. Get in this. Yeah. You did it. I'm going to turn one. Woo! Turn one. Lucky. Oh! Oh my god. Look at this. Look at this. What? What? It's good. It freaking split. Come on. I'm going to try it on you. Look at it. Oh man. Look at that. We can explode it. This is like five-year-old bamboo. It's exploded on the side. That's power. Sorry for the interruption and the lawn mower. I think we should build a lot of cotton and shoot it after lawn mower. Oh, we should. Oh. Oh. That's it. This is what I want to do in the Philippines. I want to meet people and have fun interactions. But we're so like, we first of all dump there 1000 situations where that happens. And it's like a ball. We're be like, oh, let's just go to the restaurant and eat and go back to the apartment. We're pissed, get boys. We were in Georgia for two and a half months and we didn't go anywhere ever. We just went to restaurants and hiking by ourselves. We're awkward. Sorry. If the person that one of the people that met us in Dubai is walking us, it was a very awkward encounter. I'm sure you know who you are. Yeah. And you have a prime example of awkwardness. So never really do anything like, thanks for watching everybody. If you guys want to make a long talk with us, DM us on Instagram. Yeah. And we'll be like, oh, that's such a great idea. And then we're like, eeeeh, and do awkward. And then everything. No, we'll do it. I'll do it. Don't blow us up. Thanks for watching everybody. Hopefully you enjoyed it. If you did, subscribe. Like the video, more Filipinos stuff. Come in on this channel soon. On a vlog channel soon. Two months away. And we'll see you in the next one. Bye.
