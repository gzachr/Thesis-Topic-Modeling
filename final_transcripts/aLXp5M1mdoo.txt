So this is, I think it's like me, maybe some vegetables inside. There were two types that we only got this one. Mmm. Mmm. It's like, you bet. I do it. Dude, that's good. Mmm. That's so good. Let me see. So some meat? That's it carrots. Pretty small. Mmm. I wonder if the spring rolls are generally smaller? Mmm. What about, I like it. Mmm. Mmm. Yeah, I'd kill a couple more. Yeah, I'm almost done. Oh. Yeah. No, no, I'm good. I'm good. Oh, this. Mmm. Mmm. All right. Mmm. I'm like, that's really good. Super high for this one. Mmm. Just because the way it looks, it's like, look at that. Look. Looks so good. All right. Let me see. Ooh. Listen to that. Mmm. It's so crispy. Mmm. So crispy. Mmm. So juicy, so like fatty. Mmm. Look at this. Fish and duck. Ooh, look. All right. Mmm. I wonder if this is the dip for it. There's something like this. It looks spicy. Just because there's like, I think there's chili pepper in there. Mmm. Good. Don't try. Ooh, this smells spicy. Let's try a little bit. Watch or not supposed to dip it in this. Mmm. How many taste tape? Not even by itself, it's good. Mmm. It's good enough. No need anything. Mmm. Let's try everything. Mmm. Did I take extra skin? I wonder if there's bones. Mmm. Do it so good. Mmm. It's just melt. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm, yeah, rice. Here. Here's a sisseg. Grab you some. There you go. Mix this with rice. Ooh, I see some pepper in there. Oops. Chop some. Good, this is good. Yeah. Mix that. Mmm. Spicy. It's not bad. That thing hit me. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Come back. I love meat, so this is awesome. I like fried stuff. Crispy stuff. Mmm. Pop a beer. It's apparently like... Oh, it's gonna... So apparently you're supposed to eat this with beer. Try it. Mmm, that was good. I wanna try the tofu. Should we just grab it? So there's pork. And then there is... I think chicken. There's only two here. You take this one. It's a big meat. I'll take the little one. Ooh, look at that. Mmm. Everything is delicious. Mmm. You have that before, though, right? Mmm. No, doble. I haven't had any of this. Oh, no way. I've had doble once, but I haven't tried any of these yet. Mmm. Look at that. Mmm. So it's your favorite so far. Honestly, they're all really good. I really like this. Mmm. Makes with rice. I can't decide. This is good. This is good. Everything is good. This is too crispy. Look at that. That's why it's called the crispy pata. So I haven't been watching... Stranger things. I have not been watching it. But I started watching these Chinese dramas. It's like eSports teams. Okay. Like all male eSports teams. And then they go into these gaming championships. Please. And then there's one female that joins. And she's the first female ever. But it's just fun because I play games myself. Yeah. So when they talk about the roles and what they do, it just sounds so familiar. Do you watch anything recently? I watch, never have I ever. So there's three seasons. And they just came up with the third season. What is it about? Basically about a girl. She's not popular. She's kind of nerdy and stuff. And she dates the most popular guy in high school. Okay. And it's just like a couple of their dramas and stuff. Oh really? Yeah. Like every day high school stuff. It was fun until I was a little nervous. Wait, so why was that work? I was popular and she's dating the most popular guy. What just happened like that? I was just like one of those dramas like the CEO notices you. It's like, oh. Yeah, I guess. I don't want to come in and draw much. Yeah. You finished the first two season already? Yeah. What's wrong, man? You binge it? No, I watched the first season when it came out. And the second season. I just finished the third season now. It's like a... It's actually pretty good. It's pretty funny. I feel like this is like... I wonder if this is a dessert. Or it's just like... It's a dessert, right? Of course. I think so. No, or it's like more of just like a drink. Mm-hmm. No, I mean. Not really. It's so good. No, it's like a... Is that a drink or is like... Is that a dessert? It has ice cream inside. It's like... It seems like the same as like a bubble tea, maybe. Mm-hmm. But again, I'm not sure. Where? I'll get more of this. Got me grab you some? Yeah. There you go. So it's good. Yeah. Thanks. Oh my god, I see a freaking massive... Pepper. What a boy that. That's for Dennis. I don't handle spice much better than you do. No, you do it way better than me. Like, you had that times... What is it? Times two spicy... Korean noodles. And you actually ate the whole bowl. I would have died literally. I was dying though. Well, just to eat it. Mm-hmm. There's no way I would have been able to down that. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Is it a bowl? Mm-hmm. I'm thinking about like how this compares to our... Rolls-Pork. Mm-hmm. I feel like this is um... This feels much juicier. Like much fatter and juicier. Every once we have, they're not as... The fat, like the layers of the lotha-inner I think. Which one's your favorite? I think this. Like crispy. Mm-hmm. What is it? Balls. And then I'm gonna try all the other ones after two. It was just like half of what was recommended, right? It was a huge list, I think. So we went through the comments. And then we tallied up like... What were the most requested? Or did that as the first batch? And then we'll have a second batch of all the other stuff too. But like honestly most of them were highly recommended. Yeah. But we just don't want to get too much, because we're not gonna be able to finish in one sitting. And we didn't know how much it actually came with it, right? So it's like... There's actually good. Like not overly stuffed, but... Yeah, it's our first time ever. Like I've never actually ordered portions. Right, so I just don't want to get too much. Yeah. Oh, this is good. I feel like we need more rice. Mm-hmm. So I feel like these pair up so well with rice. Speaking of like games, that game drama I was talking about, have you been playing games recently? Mm-hmm. So this guy is super good. Because you don't play with me anymore. This guy is super good at called duty. He can see things like... From miles away, and he'll do a call, and I'm like, whoa. Where is it? We get used to it, right? Like you see little movements, and you're just like, oh, there's some there. Like the color is a little bit different. No, you can see, you see far. Like you do a call, and I have to look for it. But you're super good at league. Mm-hmm. I mean, just a very average player. I'm not good at all. You could've won pro. My ass up. I'm gonna throw my ass. I'm gonna throw it. Good orable. I'm horrible. Don't say stuff like that. You're gonna be broken back. Oh, let me look him up. Oh, this guy's garbage. Oh, he's just joking. By doing Joe Lito. I know a lot of people say it's like childish. But I love it. Mm-hmm. I'm not like a first percent shooter anymore. It's so hard for me. I'm like, I can't see clearly. Yeah, let's do it. Especially when you're playing. And then you're like shooting the guy and I got jumping around pumping you. I came in, I came in, I catch up though. Where are you? It's hard. Yeah, it's all about reaction time. Like, you start when you're young, you know? I did that. I forgot about it though. You honestly lose it. I feel like you lose it. Yeah. So if you guys, any of you play called duty, you can leave a comment. And you can play a Doos and Trio's and stuff. Get some dubs. Yeah. I haven't played for a while, so I might be trash now. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Last one on my side. Mm. I like that they're small. You just pop it. They have the other lumpy of vegetable. So I found the pictures. Like when you select a Shanghai to order, it automatically gives you 15 pieces. Okay, okay. But the larger, I feel like the vegetables are larger because it tells you by individuals. So obviously it's going to be more vegetables inside. Yeah. Let's see. I want to try one with more meat. Oh, look at this. Oh, my God. Mm-hmm. You can't handle the sauce. Well, I feel like it's like a little bit spicy. Mm-hmm. I should've asked them. Mm-hmm. Like which one is for white? Mm-hmm. Because I'm not familiar with it. Mm. These two, they kind of look the same, right? Mm-hmm. These are the same, right? These two, they're same? Mm-hmm. Oh. I think it's just like a, put it on whatever you want, kind of thing. Let us know in the comments. Mm. Mm. What should I have? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm. Man, I have to go. Mm. I have to go MMA after this. Mm. Kind of be so fool. No, you don't, you're heavy. What energy do you have to fight, sir? No, no, no, puke. Can I take a break? No. And then don't fight right away. Okay. I'm going to take a break. Give me a second. Let me warm up. I was looking at randomly, sometimes you're just browsing Google and then you just randomly think of something and you just start searching. I was like, oh, let me look at Moitai and stuff. Oh yeah. Just for fun, just for fun. And I googled it and I was like, oh, you know what would be cool to like learn something. And I had gone to like the programs and like what they do, I'm like, no, forget it. Once you come to my gym. I was like, oh, I'm going to go to a two four piece of love. You don't need that. No, it's always good to know something. Yeah. Where's your like places far? No, it's near SBC. Well, it's not far. Yeah. But I teach everything. I teach kickboxing and Jujutsu. Oh, okay. Yeah. There's something stuck in my shoulder. I'm like, jelly, yeah. And my coach was, you know how there's UFC? Mm-hmm. It looks like MMA, right? So it's everything. Yeah. And then there's glory, which is just kickboxing. Mm-hmm. And he was the world champion for glory. Yeah. But I'm sure he's not always there. He's always there. Oh, he's done like he won the world champion. So he's like, I should. I mean, just end it right there. No, and then during that fight, he got concussion. Oh, no. So then he couldn't fight after that. So does he, like when he's at the gym, does he actually spar with you guys? Or is he too good? No, no, he'll kill us all. Yeah. No, but does he still do it or? Yeah, he still does it. Well, competitively, but like it'll always be something that he does, I think. So what happens when like a completely new person goes in as you're, so let's say like I were just signing up and I was like, I want to learn. Like how much do you know? Like zero. Put me with the kid. No, so there's, there's like a beginner class, which is like guys and girls. And then I think there's a woman, don't call me on it. Mm-hmm. Actually, I don't think there's a woman's only. But there's like a beginner. And then once you learn the basics of that. Yeah. They'll put you in a test and then they'll put you in intermediate. Oh, really? Yeah. And then if you want to like train harder and stuff, you could go to advance and like keep moving up. Mm-hmm. And like compete. I think I'm too old to compete now. Like if I was younger, I would do it. But nah. Hold, like do they usually stop at? What age? Like 30 maybe? Yeah. I'm just a dude. If I for another like, I'll just be the first, the oldest person to fight. I'm kicking some 20 year old ass. Yeah, but if you're down, let me know. Yeah. Oh, I see it's so hard to just get a routine. Like I'm struggling to even like stick to a workout. Maybe you're bored of it. It's always good to switch it up, right? No, you know how people say make it a lifestyle. So it's been a lifestyle. Like I always do it. Yeah. But then it's just so hard. I don't know if you guys feel me, but after a long day, even more in time, like more mornings even harder. But like after a long day, you're just like, oh my god, I still have one more thing to do. It's like another hour of. Oh, I don't think the wrong thing. That's okay. You can start. I didn't see it in an hour. Yeah, but you can do whatever you want. I thought it'd take good. Free salad. Free stuff. So good. This is like, if you love fried food, you got to get these. It's really good. And generally, when you have fried stuff, it's always like fried chicken, okay? Because the first time I have this much like fried pork. Trying to hunt for like a fattier piece of this. Oh, look at that. How's your beer? Delicious. I can see how the beer goes all the way to the city. It's like a little bit spicy. It's like the beer went with this. It's really all of them. I don't know. For me, it's like I need something to drink. It's a little bit spicy and stuff. Obviously, this, it's like, that's all good. I'm actually getting full. I'm actually getting full. I'll finish it by this. Oh. What else was on the list? So they had the pantset. It's like the stir-fried noodles. But there's two types. So there's a Paula Bok. And there's like a... I can't really remember. But one is more seafood. I think one's not with seafood. And there was garlic shrimp, I think. There's a lot. I can't remember. There's tons of stuff. But they all sound good. I want to have some more of this. But I don't have any more rice. No, I don't want your rice. OK, take some more of the finishes. That's too much. It's not so full. It's just go down so smooth. I'm so smooth. Go on. So if I were to go and learn, they'll put me with a, they won't put me with a cube with it. No, they won't put you with a cube. Like beginner class, what does that look like? I go to the beginner and I go to intermediate. What do you do there? Like, like, what does the class look like? Like a walk in and they're like, everybody just stand there and do this. Okay, so you walk in and then you sign up. You sign up for like a week for free or something like that. Oh, really? Yeah, maybe it's one trial. And after one week, like a good bye-bye. Go get changed and then you go in the room. You stretch a little bit. And then once you instruct your comes, you'll come like five minutes earlier. Once it comes, everyone warm up because like some people just sit around, right? And like not do anything. Because like they're like, oh, like I don't wanna do anything. Because I don't wanna, I'm a beginner and they don't wanna. Yeah, I don't wanna show them. Yeah, like suckers, I mean. Yeah, like drawing the attention to themselves, right? It's really good. Cause like the, yeah. And then, so you warm up and then it's like, okay, like sometimes you'll partner up. Look, I just like teach you basic stuff. Like how to block punches, how to block kicks, how to throw punches, how to throw kicks, how to combo, how to like, parry and then come back with a attack yourself. That's so cool. Yeah, it's good. And it's just good for your confidence as well, right? Yeah. Just walking around. Don't call for it. Yeah, I know, but like, you could be even more confident. Ah, I know. I know. I know there's still a lot of walks in here. So funny. I'm super full. I think it's cause I had the beer though. Did you chew the beer? The beer's on. The beer time, what is we're trying to do? It's a, sorry, a dough ball. No, I know it's a dough ball. But it's chicken. Oh, it's a pork. It's like huge piece. Wait, that was chicken. That's huge. No, it's chicken. See, even you say it was huge. Give me the massive piece. Let me kill it. Let me kill it. I need this. I think there's probably a bone. Yeah, I'd be best. Mm-hmm. Hey, look, why are you watching? It's the watchman. I watch you when I get full. Good thing we are all the more. Yeah. This is like the perfect amount. I'm not too full. Oh my good. I think if I went, I'll get two things for myself. Yeah. I'm not, I'm not like one is not enough. And two is just okay. Yeah. Maybe not two of these. These are pretty big. These are massive. Yeah. And you need rice for sure. So rice for noodle. So rice for noodle and then like two of these sides. That's sides, but like, it's delicious. Well, jelly and stuff that it couldn't get. Mm. I'm glad we tried this. Mm-hmm. That would definitely have it again. For sure. Especially this. So good. You chew your ice, right? You're not supposed to. I'm like, don't you chew it. You know what's funny? Not your ice, though. You know what's funny? So their ice, like it stays icy. Like most drinks just melt. Like this ice is just there. Like it's not going here. I think they're really fast to do. Mm. What do you want me? Okay. It hurts by such a way. Oh, I have two cares. No, because there's so much. Like, I'm the type of person. There's stuff in here. So I'm the type of person that would bite their ice cream. Mm. Like bite their popsicle. Really? No. I feel bad. People were like, well, they're going to hate me for it. But like I can't just lick the thing. I feel like I'm not getting enough flavor and texture. I just want to like just give me a bite. Maybe a little popsicle. Popsicle you're happy. I don't know. I can't lick it. I can't. By the time you get to the end, by the time you finish it, there's going to be no ice cream. Like you're not going to finish anything. It's just melting. But yeah, no, I see what you mean. It's all right. Bye, boy. And I think what I think we're good. Well, at least I'm good. I'm just like extremely full. What are you doing? What are you doing? Spoon. Yes. Uses. Oh, no. It's a greasy spoon. Just lick it. Sit down. Hold it. Hold it. Oh, that's crazy. Oh, that's icy. It's damn good. Yeah, that's good. The ice is really, really cold. That sounds stupid because like ice is supposed to be cold. But the ice is really, it's like some different ice. That's the ones I've had. Yeah, I don't know how you do it. Ice just touching my teeth. Oh. I thought it would be super sweet, but it's not at all. It's perfect. Because two, three is not good, right? But then you need some flavors. I think just a white mixture. I think. Sorry, I remember I was doing the comments. I remember someone was mentioning that if you don't mix the hollow, hollow, then you can taste there's certain parts of it. That's really sweet. And then the other parts are like no flavor. But I think it's because we mixed it well. That's why you're getting like a proper balance. So. No. And the ice is getting my way. Yeah, exactly. If it's doing too fast it just comes out. Oh, I'm good. I'm done. I saved this. For sure. I'm saving it. Thank you guys for watching. I think we'll probably do a part two eventually. Well, we have to. Yeah. There's just too many foods to try. Yeah. But we're probably going to do some stuff in between. But thank you so much for the suggestions. It was amazing. Yeah. We'll see you guys later. Take care. Bye. It was so good.
