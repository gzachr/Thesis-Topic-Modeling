 Nate vs Ghost 2021 So what type of food is this? It's like traditional. I heard this is like the best traditional around like... Yeah? Yeah. Well I've never had Filipino food. Me and my girlfriend are going to try it today. I had to order a little bit of everything. I didn't know what's good. Absolutely good. Okay, well that's good in you. I just kind of went down the list. I just said a little bit of that. It's just my idea. And then the next one is coming from... Oh I'm sure we will, yeah. Well guys I think that's as traditional as it gets. Now let's go eat. One is good in Pablo Squad. And welcome back to our channel. So today is a really exciting video as you can see. We got traditional Filipino... So Filipino. I just want to say a disclaimer before we start this video. We really don't know what we're talking about when it comes to this food and the names of the food. It's Filipino. I know it's... That's how you... Okay, so the closest Filipino place was 40 minutes away. They didn't deliver so we had to drive 40 minutes to pick up basically the whole menu. Yeah we did. And then 40 minutes back. Yeah, so it was worth it. But I heard Filipino food is so good. And we are going to be trying it for the first time in this video and sharing our thoughts on us being... Literally the most basic Americans you can get. I just honestly I feel like it's fun trying different Filipino foods. It's kind of like different. You know, we get to kind of see what they eat and what like... Oh, what is that? Salza. Oh. Something salsa. That looks fire. Anyways we've gone. Yeah, it's going to be really exciting. And I... We were looking at the menu. Oh my gosh. It even smells amazing. It was so hard not to just go in and eat on the way home. But I knew we needed to get our taste testing done here. So before we do anything else, we did get a dessert. And the name of this dessert is called Halo Halo. She said it means like everything, everything, something like that. Sorry if we get it wrong. But Halo Halo basically means they put everything in this one little... This is what it looks like. Container. There's like, flan ice cream. Looks like some candy. I don't know the bottom part. I'm gonna put a little bit. Like the white one. The color of a maggots. I don't know what it is. It does. Look like maggots. Doesn't it? But... We got to eat one. We got to try it. Just open the lid up. It's gonna come off. It's literally taller than the lid. Oh. Okay, this could be dangerous guys. It might just... Oh, we start leaking. It's okay. It's going for a good cause. They kind of melted a little bit in the car. It did melt. But it's okay. Once again, we were 40 minutes away. So we did what we could. So we remember when I actually tried this in the car and it was so freaking good. It tastes like rice crispy treats. It tastes like the rice crispy treats cereal. Okay. I figured it was literally about like five and over now. So what are you doing right now? I think that's ice cream, right? I think that purple sauce is flan. What's flan? Flan is like a big, Hispanic dessert too. When I was in Spanish class back in the day, we had some flan. I think that's what that is. It's pretty good. It's different. It's different. It's different, but it's good. Yeah, it's weird. Let me take the ice cream then. I'm gonna try this. The ice cream is really good. This is ice. Oh, there's shaped ice in there too. Oh, yeah. I remember they put shaped ice in there. That's fire. Let me try the shaped ice. I'm trying the shaped ice yet. One. Bill's going in town. It's like a milkshake. You guys were starving, so we... Let me get some... I would rate this. This one about a six-odd... Wait, wait, wait. You gotta try the bottom though. The bottom is a good part. Hold on. We gotta... No, the bottom freaks me out. We gotta go all the way down here. Oh, I'm gonna hit the bottom. Oh, what is this? No, the bottom freaks me out. Look, it literally just like... I feel like a whole bunch of candy and stuff. So that thing right there looks like a mag. Yeah, it does. It freaks me out. In real life. I'll let you taste, test it. It's a bean. Oh, it's a bean? It's like a white bean. Oh. Oh, that's weird. Hold on. Let me try this thing. Try that green thing. It looks like a gummy. It's okay. It tastes like bean. They have beans in the mouth. I'll give this one... I'll just cut it apart. I don't like the gummy. This is super unique. I'm gonna say... A six out of ten. This is like a... Yeah, solid sticks. Because the top part is amazing. It's not bad. Us being used to our American like steak and shake, like shakes and stuff. Going to that, it's definitely a lot different. But I still really like it. It's not bad. Alright, so the first thing we're gonna do, I think we should... Now we're gonna do this for the food. This is the big one first. Yeah, we'll wait for these. We're doing... I think we should wait. Really? That's due big one last. Oh, it's a sissis. This is the one stuff. Oh, sissis. Sissis. Come on, let me look at it. Sissis. Sissis. It has an egg on it. What else does it have? Some... Want me? Pork or something? We'll get you the exact word. Oh my god, dude. This one looks so good. This looks so good. Alright, I got it on top. Oh my god, yeah. I'm gonna put a fry egg. Wait, what's up with some... Wait, what's up with some... ...a fry egg on it? Well, I'm sorry. Oh, guys, as you could tell, we're starving. And this food literally smells amazing. It smells amazing. It passes the smell test. Like, the other thing that you guys know how to make some good smell in food. We might be getting this, like I said, a little punctuation wrong or the... Penalency. We're just bad. I haven't been in school in years. Like, I need to get a napkin, dude. I need to get some napkins. I'm going in. Let's try it. How is it? Is it good? It looks good. Oh my god. Mmm. Alright, my turn. Going in. Get some egg in there. What do you kind of mean is this? Mmm. Oh my god. It's so good. How long? You're going to be literally in heaven. Oh, just our cream on it. Is that our girl? I don't know. Maybe it's their treasure song. Oh, that's so good. Right? Oh, hold up. This changes the game. Hold on. What is this? Can you look it up on the menu? Look at how good that looks. I'm telling you, it literally tastes better than it looks. It's sweet. Mmm. Mmm. That's a ton of time. This is a ton of time. Oh my god. I think this is like cheese or something on it. We start off good. Because guys, this tastes amazing. What's this called again? Sissy. S-I-S-I-G. Sissy. Sissy. Tine out of town. Mmm. Oh my god. If this is just the start of the food. I can't even imagine the rest. We heard so many good reviews about Filipino food and it's just like people just rave over it. But we don't have any like her dish in them. And if you guys like this, comment down below. And if you guys want to try Asian, Indian food, anything, anything culture food, that us Americans don't eat. I want to get into this because this one looks good. Oh. This one looks so excited. Why is it like an egg roll? It's lumpia. It's lumpia. It's lumpia. I'm actually really excited when I saw this on the website. I'm like, I have to try it out. It comes with a sweet sauce. This looks like the sauce from Panda Express that you get for your crab ring. I think it's an egg roll. You know what I mean? It does, but it's probably so much more than that. It's a texture of it too. It's not going to be hard. It looks like a taki. Like what do you, is it? This is not a taki. Takeda or whatever you call it. Oh my god. Is it good? Mmm. Mmm. Oh my god. Fire. It's like an egg roll. This is amazing. What is it called there? Um, lumpia. Lumpia? Lumpia or lumpia? This is 10 out of 10. Wow. So far we got, that's from me 10 out of 10. What do you rate it? 10 out of 10. I would eat the crab out of this. Oh my god. This is like the like philipino like taki. It is. You know what I mean? Like where you have like the stuffed beef in it? Whatever this is. Wow. The noodles go crazy. All right, this is good. Wow. Actually, so good. I'm eating that later. This is your all gone. Oh, this is all gone. This is all gone by tonight. We're gonna literally be so full. Let's try this one. We're saving the big one for last, because this one looks so good. Look guys. What's this? Oh my god. This one has like chicken right there. I think this is the barbecue chicken. This is the chicken, that's the beef I think. The pork? Pork, yeah, yeah. So they had barbecue chicken and no, barbecue pork? Barbecue chicken, barbecue pork. Yeah, they had pork and chicken. We just ordered one of both, because like why not? We wanted to try as much as we could. And also, sorry if you guys are hungry right now. I know this is not carrying your appetite, but. I love watching people eat. You better look up Philippine Food, because I already saw on the menu. This looks so good. And guess how much this was? This was $2. And $7. This stuff is so not expensive for how good the product is. Just think for $10, you can get four of these. That'll be a whole dinner. At a normal restaurant, it's like, probably 20 bucks for this. Oh yeah. Mm-hmm. It's just a quality. Oh my God. They had, I was looking when I was picking this up. She had like her mom back there. I thought I could be the way to eat it, but. Her like vintage Filipino mom back there cooking up on the grill. Oh my gosh. I know she can make it good. Oh yeah, that's right. This one's probably better than I wanted to. It was like a rib. I like the pork better. This tastes like a rib. What? I'm going to switch to gal. I like this flavor. Mm. All right. So it's just good. But this one's more flavor to me. The pork. The pork has more flavor than the chicken. They needed to put more sauce on this. Yeah. I'm going to rate this in eight out of time. I'm going to rate that one at nine out of time. This one just needs more sauce than it'd be 10 out of time. 100% the chicken is so. It's like sauce. Oh this is like so easy. 100% the quality in the food though is A1. I don't know where they get their livestock. And it's up on your stomach. What is that? They must ship this in from Philippine. This is 275 each. Yeah, I know. So literally $10 would put you four of these almost $11. Oh my god. God, we're eating good. Like this is amazing. And do I know what the good part is? This is filling food. Like this right here, even though it doesn't seem like a lot. Oh that's a lot. That would fill me up. Like I want to eat that together. Oh my god. Absolutely guys, I already from the start. This is amazing. I think even I'm gonna start getting it in the car and smelling it. That was just barbecue pork and this is chicken. Oh, cute chicken. Barbecue chicken. So that's what we just ate. So I definitely think the pork is a, I'm afraid it's 10. I feel like all this stuff is so good because I could eat it everyday. Oh what is this? I was so confused right. One on the website and I saw these. Pudo. What? Pudo. It might be honestly. Pudo guys. This is the last planet. So I don't know what this might be a dessert. It looks like, you know what it looks like? It looks like a cupcake with no frosting on it. No, no, no. Like those egg whites, egg whites. The dessert? It smells like dough. Like straight up dough. It smells like pizza dough before you make it in the oven. Ooh. I thought it was like a cupcake. I want to be. Oh hold up. This might be really good actually. You're going in front like that. I'm gonna take a bite. Mmm, mine's got cornbread. It does. This is identical to American cornbread. Oh my god. I think cornbread's made it a mess. Honestly, I was kind of like looking at it. I was like ill commenting at whites. I'm not being a person. What's the thing in the middle though? It looks like dried up butter. I actually ate it. It's a good thing. It doesn't have flavor. Oh really? This is fire. Oh. This is basically like a cupcake without frosting on it or cornbread without corn in it. Yeah. I would rate this like an Aida attack. It's like a dessert but it's like nativine dessert. See even though it doesn't really have a lot of flavor, the flavor that it does have is like really good. Probably like just from the oils I've used. There's literally like no other flavor except what you see right here. Wow. So are you ready? I can see why people get addicted. You're ready to eat. It's just like the bread of the Philippines. I mean. What'd you rate that? You seem like you like it. I'm going nine point five. Okay. Nine point five. Oh wow, when I put that, you're picking it. You're putting that. This is better than the water. Do you want a water? Because I'm used to a lot of like sugar on a dessert or whatever you call it. And that it doesn't have like, I feel like it needs to be a little sweeter to get to that 10. But nine point five is still really, really, really generous because that it's max. It's really good. You guys. This I would definitely recommend. And at the end of this video, we're going to be telling you our favorite out of all these. I can't even pick. Honestly. I'm between this two. It's probably more of an appetizer but we're, we got the finale right here. And this is just a mixture of appetizers. This is the pancake. Pans it, pancake. Pean. Pean, C-I-T. Pancake. So it looks like it's got like noodles in. Oh my gosh, you guys. I'm going to do a reveal for you guys. Look at this, ready? Ha. That looks so good. Woo-hoo-hoo. Hey, we have shrimp on this chicken on it. There's green beans, carrot, like some noodles. I don't even know what this is. What is this? It looks like. It looks like brown sugar. Yeah, it looks like brown sugar or crushed, like cookie. Yeah, bright crumbs. Yeah, bright crumbs. That's what it looks like. Oh my gosh. So they have like these mini noodles, but also. Look this down there. I'm also going to have these big noodles. I'm going to eat. We love it. I'm going to smack on this. I want to see how this is. Let's make the lime, the lime all over. Yeah, you got to get lime everywhere. Look at these cute little lines. This is how you know that they are traditional. These lines, they grew on their own. That's why they're so tiny. That's why they're also yellow. If they bought a lime from the store, they would be like this big, because they're like genetically mutated. But I bet you they grew these out of their own farm, or they know someone that has a farm that naturally grows. I feel like this is going to be your favorite. Like looking at it, it probably wouldn't be my favorite. No, this looks fine. But it looks good. I can't be. I can't be. Like call me a tiger, Blake. Should we get everything in that one? I'll do the shrimp. You do the chicken, OK? Make sure to get like the vegetables in there too. Ready? Cheers. OK. Mm. Do you like it? No, I need more. Hold on. That is fire. I'm not even going to cap. That is so good. This is 10 out of 10 for me. I will, Sire. I'm ready to get everything in 10 out of 10. I'll try it, but this is- This is definitely not 10. Time. What? Come on. Maybe we need to try with this stuff. I don't know what this is. You just put this by the hood and the bike. Whoever's watching this video, if you know what this stuff is, let us know, because it didn't come with like a description on what is inside here. But I'm guessing you just kind of throw it over and- I'm definitely going from. Is that what you do? I feel like you might need it. Need it with it. Yeah. Try with the- Try with the breadcrumbs. We're just going to call them breadcrumbs for now. It's pretty good, right? As with a little crunch. OK, so- You don't like it? No, I do. I think it's an A-I type. That's fine. I think it's awesome. I'm just like- I'm going to choose that first. I'm- I definitely like the- Oh, wow. This is- The sissy? This one? Yeah. Out of these two. I don't know if it's a starving or what? I'm telling you right now, the food in America. I feel like cannot compare to food in other countries. Because like America is the one of the most like unnatural, processed food like country. I feel like in the world. So the fact that like the people that I bought this from, I bet you they grow all of this naturally. And they don't use any preservatives or like growth hormones in America. We might be wrong about that, but- I might be wrong. Yeah. This could just be a knockoff. There might be people that come to me like, yo, that's not it. But like from what she told me, like she knew what she was talking about. Yeah. Okay, so I think my all-time favorite are these. The- Oh, is it so good? The lumpia. The lumpia will be- I thought you ate all that wrong. Like save me one. Yeah, these are fire. Look at- Do you have a problem? These are probably my favorite appetizer. So I'm guessing this is an appetizer. This is my favorite appetizer. It's hard to pick between these two, but this- This is so cute. This would fill me up. This is so cute. I would order this if I wasn't feeling as hungry, but like, I don't know. I would go- You like that one better? This is so good, but this has more flavor, low-key. Yeah, that one does. But this one just smacks like way different. It has like five different noodles in it. I don't even know what my favorite one. I would say like, I don't know. They're all so good. I probably wouldn't order this unless I was like walking around like a fair. You know what I mean? I'd like to work, but then one. I'm like walking around a fair. Like this is perfect if you're like at six flags, you know? Mm-hmm. And you just want like a walk and a walk and eat snack. I'm sorry, my favorite is this one. Lung via. That's what I'm supposed to say. I would say so many people when they would eat these eat them on camera, and I'm like, I gotta try this from the bottom. Is that an appetizer, though? You said your favorite meal was this? Yeah, I would say the- Sisyphe. It's funny. I'm already full, and we're already- We still have- We barely even made a dent. Like everything that we've been eating, we took like three bites out of. So I think all around, Philippine, you know, from what I taste on the food side, 10 out of 10. Oh, 100%. The ice cream was amazing. I'm a little like- I think I would buy you guys. About the beans. There were beans in the bottom. Yeah, I don't think- I would ask for none of that stuff on the bottom. The ice cream was fire, though. I can probably tell that the ice cream was like amazing. But all around- 10 out of 10. 10 out of 10. I would never even have guessed. We've never had Philippine like traditional Filipino food up until now. I was my first time. Maybe we have in the past, and we never knew we were eating it. But like- One place in Chicago, Illinois is going to have traditional Filipino food. It probably do. I mean, there are probably some like little places that have it. They definitely do. But we've never like went out with- Yeah, we never try any like different kinds of food. Look for it. Yeah. Which I want to keep doing videos like this, because I feel like it's fun. Like I get to taste test. And a lot of you guys who are Filipino love to see us Americans try food like this. So- So- Comment down below what we should try next. And I also want you guys to comment down below where you are from. Okay, what country you are from, or if you're in the US- And if you're Filipino- Comment what state. Yeah. I just want to see- If you are Filipino, comment down below. What is your favorite Filipino meal? Like your favorite- Tell us if we did it right. Like, did we order the right stuff? The woman there said that we did a good job ordering just off the phone, like looking at the menu. But like, is there anything that we should have tried? Or is there anything here that's like- Yeah, that- That should be awesome. Because everything here was amazing. It was amazing. Little in my favorite. But guys, I hope you enjoyed this video and- Throw it in the towel. I'm full. We're gonna keep eating it. It's fun because we're on a diet too. Yeah, I know this is all bad. It's so good. It's so good. It was worth it. Like, obviously now we can say we tried Filipino food. Oh, no, we did it. It's fun. Woo! Alright guys, we'll see you in the next video. We'll be right back. Peace, love you guys.
