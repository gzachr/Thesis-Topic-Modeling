 Music It's good morning my friends, my amputantag. As you can see, I need a haircut. Now, Jane normally cuts my hair here in the Philippines, but for today, for this time, she's going to take me somewhere. So, we come back to Jane's sister. It's going to have a look at the carolot. This is new. Jane's sister and brother-in-law are made of nice birdbass. She's chicken instead of anything used to birdbass, but... ...music eyes, if you want. I'm going to give them the one chick has on the right. Oh no, that's nice. It changes her every day. Every time we go, it's different. It's nice. I love the garden here. There's so much growing, so much they can grow. It's changed every day. Which I feel the big dog are going to get you a big dog after that. Little ones. What? Where? Behind the big dogs. They come watch out. These chicks, these ducks. They're quite vicious when you're after their little ones. We get too close. We're going to have a look now, so we've got any more car ready. We have a few bags, a few tools. Not really dressed to do this today, but we're going to do it anyway Sunday. Always good to guard on Sunday. Always remember I'm mum and dad going to have a lot of them on a Sunday. I'm picking some fruits and vegetables they grown. Oh, it's much better if we can go in now before they used to be... No way in unless you really squeeze through. Check from spider web. If you need a carry of getting the back ground Sunday, always. So there's some tarot growing. So we feel like the middle fits with plants and fruits and vegetables. So unlike all mocquery we live, there's no breeze here. It's very humid, very hot and humid. I love it. You can grow very easily, but it makes work in here very difficult. I really high, yeah, we need to cut them short. There's loads up there, green ones, and there's lots of bottom ones there. I know, I know. Yeah, that's what we need to cut this. And that one there? There's probably like 20 in this tree, but they're so high up. Some of them are okay still. This is a bad thing for a lot of people. What are you doing there? Karaman says huge ones in this tree, but it's hard to get to them because they're quite high. Here, there's some... this one look big. Big. Oh, oh yeah. You probably can lift that one. Look. It's on the side. No, no, no. No, it's on my... David, almost. We heard you don't see it. These. I love this men of fresh Karaman, see? So as you can see the road here by James' sister's house, it's been concreted. Makes a big difference, doesn't it? Clean's up this area, makes it much easier to drive along and the water flows off easily into the end channel. And it's much better for all the houses here to drive up and down. It's easier to walk on. It's really good. So what type of bananas are these? It has a lot of bananas. They're very different, aren't they? They're very fat looking. Short and fat. I do not have a banana here. Tambok bananas. Very Tambok bananas. The mother's looking for worms for their chicks. They should find one. The genes taking one... They're taking their bananas. Taking their... Unknown bananas away. So what are these bananas? It's red banana. But really, if you know what these bananas are, drop us a comment. We've never seen them before. They're just called bananas. They won't actually go orange. Then bananas don't go orange, do they? Stupid Adam. Where's my brain? They won't go yellow, I mean. They will possibly go a bit greener. But they might stay the same colour. They'll have a incredibly nice smell. So we have to try these bananas when they're ripe. Looking forward to it. The generosity of Filipinos. They share amongst the family. It's really nice. So these bananas given to us by a gene sister. They're almost ripe. Gonna try them later. So we're gonna go now. We're going to Omaha City. I can get my hair cut. Finally. It's a bit long for me. Especially when you live somewhere warm. You want it a bit shorter. But easier to manage. And also, we're gonna be going away for a few days. So I'm gonna go get a haircut in Omaha City. And it's as well as gonna have something done with her hair. I don't know what they're gonna do, but we'll find out. Maybe they'll shave it all off. She's really... Put on her body. Gwilia. Gwilia, the human Gwilia. Who's that mean? I don't Gwilia. I miss Universe. I miss Universe. I wish. Gwilia World. Miss Gwilia. True. So anyway, seriously, Cream's spoke to Jane last night. She was doing the dishes. She heard her. Hello. And it wasn't me. It was Cream. Cream spoke. He said hello. He's got a funny voice. He's got very British accent. Yars. Past the sugar, please, Cookie. She said hello. Made you jump before the white one. I'm like, what do you talk to me? So in Omaha City. I don't know what Jane's taking me. There's me somewhere to get a haircut. It's going to be a new experience. As Jane's been on to cut my hair for the last two years. Leave or not. Get home in England. I'm here in the Philippines. Jane's cut my hair always. She's going to let somebody else loose on my beloved hair. Why I have left of it anyway. So we're part of the middle. It's quite busy here. A coldly locked house, eh? We go get some coldly locks instead. So Jane's come before to get her haircut. They've got a sliced mango, is it about that? It's a red shop here. Iron is about a baker. They've busy it. My fourth lock. Lock people leave them work. And I need to pay attention. I'm not going to see what I want on these fights. So where's your going to take me? This it? It's for women. Men. Here cut men, 70 pesos. It's a classic welfare. It's a country. I'm the only one who can do it. How do you like yours? I'm the only one who can do it. Can I clean up? I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I'm just a kid. You can't clean up your clothes. Oh, I can't. I can't. Come on. I'm going to have a car. And it smells like an ice cream. That's fine. This is about a new haircut. You are kind of... Is it about a... It's just like a tiger. And it's my new haircut. And my new mask. I've got a super deep take off. And the old one got a slip while my hair was going cut. My fault. There it is. It's a bit like a tiger here. I have it again for the last time I had. And the fog. I'm literally... So we're going to get some free on the way home. Before we go home, we're going to pop in one of our favourites. Mining in the style. Good morning, my amputantag. Is your day to day up ahead? Can start the day though. Doing something we've waited a very long time to do. I haven't done my hair yet. Had it cut yesterday. You can find a way to style it. It always looks better in the hairdressers. But here, if you can see, I'll wire a look at that. It's falling on the floor. We've got a couple of pliers ready. And one already dang. You can find a way in. If I can get through the jungle. It's very, very much like a jungle this garden. I'm going to have to try to... Try to tidy this up a little bit. Okay, maybe we'll try this. No, I'm going to get in up. Well, I was. This is one of those mazes. It's like one of those giant mazes, our garden. I have to try to pull through here. These flowers are a bit much, here we are. There we are. Ah, the pyre tree. Ah. So these small, these, they're native to very sweet. And they're ready. He may be just over ripe. Oh, God, that's... Hold on that one. Yeah, I'll regularly worm. Anyway, we've got some papayas. Gonna try these a bit later. Our first papayas for my tree. So we're off on a little mini holiday, a little mini vacation. Just a few days, we're leaving late to you though for the first time in... Oh, over a year since we've been here. But after summer. Looking forward, we've got a hotel booked. It's gonna be a swim point of beach. So, start to our holiday. It's a usual sometimes vacation, swinging. So, it's getting a bit of food on the way. And what better than choking? There we are. Beautiful dry food, too. Yeah. Swim and palo at the moment. Just stop in it, choking, dry food. Next stop, a tackle of hand. And then onto summer. Gonna get a bit of food. Making quite good progress, quite a time. It's like the UK. I bet it's very much like the UK. Look at this. Rain. Now they speak a different language here, don't they? They speak Wauai. So it's a bit hard to communicate sometimes. Jane doesn't know Wauai, but the trouble is, the rain is very loud on the roof of the car. That's my... is that mine? No, I don't know what that is. Is that the chicken? Yeah, they give us extra? There's given it anything. This must be the... That's gonna be... Yeah, the poor one. Oh, wow, it's got a... On this booty. Oh, wow, that was nice. It smells very sweet and sour. I'm trying to, I'm home. So you can put this in there. Yeah. I... I hit eating in the car, but... It's raining. That's the sweet and sour chicken. It's a chicken. There's no... No booty on that one? Okay. You didn't have booty? No, okay, just put that on top of the mine. Maybe I didn't have booty. Let's begin in our mini vacation to Samar. What is this? We're missing something. Oh, that's why I've started the one. Are you sure? Yeah, thank you. What's in these bags? That's like a thrown truck. A whole truck, who's... That's not a team. That's the car. Okay, do it, team. Or a home. Come on, we can get it. So we are approaching or living in the club. We're approaching these on Wannikobrads. Yeah. Wannikobrads. Oh my gosh. It's about as first time in this bridge, we live in Lity. The first time we live in 12 months. I'm a die. Jesus, name you city. I'm a die. I'm a die. I'm a die. I'm a die. I'm a die. I'm a die.
