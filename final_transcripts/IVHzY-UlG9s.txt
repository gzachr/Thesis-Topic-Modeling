 Merry Christmas! Hey. Good morning. Bella loves a bath. Yay! Okay, good morning. Let's finish the floor of the bathroom today. So while we come back from Christmas, we're ready to be tired. I hope. Okay, so. I need to modify this board. That's okay. So we get some measurement again in the bathroom and... Let's do that. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. What are you doing? I got you. You want to kill yourself? Oh, James is going to cut the grass. Yay! Soba your arms. Isn't that great? Hello, hello. She was like a sub-busy. Even when mommy and daddy busy. I'm going to cut the grass. I'm going to cut the grass. I'm going to cut the grass. I'm going to cut the grass. I'm going to cut the grass. I'm going to cut the grass. I'm going to cut the grass. I'm going to cut the grass. I'm going to cut the grass. I'm going to cut the grass. I'm going to cut the grass. I'm going to cut the grass. Okay. Hello. Hello. Hello. She's panty like daddy. Yeah. It's not panty, my love. Yay. Yes. I'll move a little bit here. I need a screwdriver. Okay. Okay. She wants to open it. She wants to open it. She wants to open it. She wants to open it. Now we're going to put... We're going to paint first and then we put a screw. How about here? Yeah. Something's going to be there. Of course. That's okay. The water come out. Exactly. No problem. What are you doing? I'm already cut. What's up in my love? Oh, careful. I need to buy those screws tomorrow. I'm not going to have enough to screw everything. No, let's screw it. Yeah. Hello. You get one drill. Okay. She get it. Oh, yeah. That's what I'm looking for. Thank you, my love. Oh, that's daddy's screw. It's not enough already, so. Okay. Okay, everything up position. I just spent all the screw holes uncomfortable. Just prevent whatever humidity go to the screws, I guess. And to the bowl itself from underneath or from over. Anyway, so. I don't have enough screw, but I'm going to put a few there. But I don't really want to seal all around if I haven't got to screw on. Because you know what's going to happen if it's not sitting down properly. Because I really would like to put epoxy all around. Maybe the best way. What do you think? Or maybe some silicone underneath and I will put the epoxy on top. That's it. I'm going to put the air around the screws I need to buy some tomorrow. So at least I think I can give one cup of paint. And that's it for today. Let's do that. Okay, this is what I'm going to use to seal all around the floor. And I'm going to use anti-fungus, anti-pactorial, anti-recenting that, anti-everything. The Tommy or City Hour is the best. So let's put that in. Okay. Yeah, the cup is so big that I need to put epoxy. I want for any epoxy until all the screws are on position. Because that's you know things will probably move a bit. I don't want that to happen. So I need to get all my screws tomorrow. And I will epoxy all around. I will see that in the next video. Tomorrow is shopping day. And that's Christmas. So we'll see how we go. I'm laughing because I just saw Ella with a texture. Putting some more next to mine. Okay, so there's just a few screws to hold the balls on position. So I just need more screws. Once I put them on, we seal all around with epoxy and then another coat of paint. Careful, my assistant's coming now. Yeah, my God. She wants to help me always. I'm having time smell now. So many flies. So many flies. Yeah, that'd be good because plenty. Okay, what are you doing? Oh, you're brushing your teeth, mommy. She brushing your teeth, okay? No! Okay, lunch time. That was a nice surprise from J.M. It's beautiful. That's it. Okay, the bathroom is finishing to your Monday. Tomorrow shopping after tomorrow Christmas. If we're going to finish cleaning up the garden around because it's really messy. Okay, I'm going to clean up the garden. Okay, I'm going to clean up the garden. Okay, I'm going to clean up the garden. Okay, and this table is going to go back to what it was. Oh, my wife looks so hard. She just brought this. Good girl. Okay, nice and clean. Put my meal back here. Yummy's there, we're jam. Okay, good clean up. It's good. Okay, that's it for this video. Until the next video. Take care. God bless you all. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
