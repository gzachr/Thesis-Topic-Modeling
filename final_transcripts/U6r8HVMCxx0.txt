Yeah, oh, that's what I meant not the name but the voice Yeah, I will link this this channel down in the description if you guys want to go check them out because the last video that we did from him It was pretty good if I remember correctly country made up of many islands and many peoples It was named after King Philippe the second of Spain when the Spanish conquered it in the mid 16th century And despite the islands winning their independence twice It never changed its name in the way that many newly independent countries do which raises the question Why did the Philippines keep its Spanish name? So first context at the time of the Spanish conquest the Philippines was in no way united It was made up of many small independent states ruled by distinct peoples who spoke different languages The islands were then mostly united under Spanish rule familiar and they collectively soon became known as the Philippine islands Spain ruled the Philippines from this time all the way to 1898 Which was when a short war broke out with the United States and to put it mildly Spain didn't do very well in the conflict This was good news for Filipina rebels would just been defeated by the Spanish just before the war's outbreak Off they had declared the creation of the Philippine Republic and so with the Spanish defeated by the American I think that this would be the beginning of an independent Philippines, which could choose its own name But fun fact no industry of Paris the Americans were given control over the Philippines Which they could have for link wish whenever they wanted the problem was that they didn't want to do that Instead they came to a compromise with the rebels you shut up and will keep the land Shockingly this led to war but the Americans were much better around to prepare for the Spanish war And thus after a brutal conflict the Philippines were pacified So did the Americans want to change the name? Well no because there was no reason to they had won the Philippines and they intended to keep the Philippines The same went for when the Japanese occupied the islands during the Second World War US sovereignty of the islands was declared over by the Filipino leaders and a new 100% Totally independent Republic of the Philippines was declared the Americans soon undid this but after the war was over US leaders soon realized that there was only two options for the Philippines Independence or full-stated the opted for option number one for several reasons the first was that fighting a war against him Could you imagine giving a country that far away from the US all statehood? Right that would be odd. Yeah, like hey you need to come to Michigan where the corporate locations at See you tomorrow. Yeah, like we know you work for Apple, but We need you in California. We need you in California tomorrow That would be terrible. I don't mean like hey, we would love you all as a state obvious 100% and I'm sure y'all would rather not be a state but Yeah, hypothetically if y'all were it would be miserable because it's so far away. Yeah, I mean that would be I think it's like like 18 hours or something Do you guys but if we conquer the You could take over everybody We don't want to do that. We love different cultures and Italy at least as personally. I Don't I don't want to be just one culture. I mean If we're talking about the best culture now I'm just kidding imperialistic expansion and then keeping your run willing colony seemed a bit hypocritical Second the Philippines has largely been economically ruined by the war and the US didn't want to pay for all of that and so all the best And third the people who lived there wanted to be independent by 1946 most Americans were done with being shot at and so as an Independent country with full control over its destiny surely there was some who wanted to abandon the name given to it by its former overlords And there were the first name proposed was the Tagalog nation Which was a big no-no because the Tagalog speaking people were not a majority in the country the second proposed name was Resalia named the philippina revolutionary Jose The problem with this was that resale was a controversial character since he actually wanted the Philippines to remain a Spanish colony just with extra freedoms and thus No, there was one last potential change of name which was considered in the early 1960s But there was a catch another country was also considering the same name and thus began the most boring race in human history The first annual legislative spring to get a majority in parliament to name your country Malaysia Spoiler alert Malaysia one and after this sparring the very reason to change the name the Philippines just sort of stuck It was a case of trying to find a name that everybody could agree on which they couldn't and so the one that equally offended everyone remained I hope you enjoyed this episode and the one that equally offended everyone I kind of enjoyed this though like I mean it was very entertaining You know what would have been nice if and taken or leave it y'all might not want this but it would have been cool to have like a Territory like let it still be a territory Mm-hmm as opposed to stay hood where you don't like vote towards the US presidential elections or any of the stuff right, but you have your own obviously just like Other territories that we have But the benefit is if you have major issues like natural disasters and stuff you get the funding from the government to have you out So yeah I mean there are jerks that have ran the country that are like oh well there would only several hundred people that died Try to compare it to like stuff right on the mainland. Yeah, no, it's yeah Just depends on who's running the country at the time. Yeah, and if they're for the people Exactly Let us know down in the description. Would you the comments are yes down in the comments. You have no control of the description if It was an option to become a state of the United States would you want to or if it was an option to become a Territory of the United States would you want to and it's okay if you don't I think the majority of the comments would say no Oh, yeah, absolutely because obviously I mean in From a from a government Financial aid standpoint it would be a benefit but from just like a personal like a pride standpoint I'd want to be a free country. Oh, absolutely and I respect that and I get that But some people might have a different thought process. Yeah, somebody might just be like I wish this was better right or something like that and that one thing might be able to be better because of a territory or a state Yeah, I mean Take it. I mean and it might not be that's the thing.
