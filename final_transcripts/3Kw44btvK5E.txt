l√§ma Let's go swimming today, you Ryan. Let's go swimming. You wanna go swimming today? Track tour. Track tour. Track tour. Good morning everyone. We're preparing breakfast here. I cook eggs. We have toasted bread. And we have a perfect avocado. So perfect avocado. We're gonna save the seed so we can grow. We can plant it in our lab. It's good. What's that? Coffee. This is so perfect. We love avocado so much, either as dessert or in sandwich. Before meeting the meat tree, I honestly didn't know that you can eat avocado with bread. Put it like a spread. Because here in the Philippines, we eat avocado as dessert. We usually add condensed milk to it, chilled it in fridge or add ice. And it is served as a dessert. It's very yummy. They actually do the same thing in Vietnam. So I guess it's an Asian thing. Come on. Come on. Come on, let's say it's a signi track. Come on, signi. Signi. I'm gonna go swimming.

Good morning, everyone! Today's another beautiful day of our life here in the Philippines. My husband woke up earlier than me today. He immediately brewed coffee. My husband loves coffee so much and cannot function well without coffee in a day. Sometimes, he can finish around 4 to 5 cups of coffee per day. But now he is trying to limit it to 2 cups a day. I'm so hungry. I'm so hungry. I'm hungry. I'm hungry. I told him it's not good to drink too much. As for me, well, I'm not much of a coffee drinker. But when I drink coffee, I add milk and a little bit of sugar to it because I cannot bear the bitter taste. I prefer tea to coffee, but we sell them by tea here in the Philippines because good quality tea or too pricey here. Lipton is affordable, but I hate lipton tea. In Russia, there are teas cheap because it's a common drink there. But in the Philippines, people like to drink the instant three in one coffee. And I don't like it. I also fried some banana. I love eating fried banana as breakfast or snack. Our neighbor kids came to our place to play today. Jason, your chicks friend invited them so they can play together. And you're like a boss. Your chick likes to play ball with them. I also decided to join. Two. What's your baby? What is it? Where is the baby? Oh, baby is gone. Is this the baby here? Are you not going to play ball with me? Pissable! I'll see you on the next one. One, you got one, two, three. Where is the baby? You're chicken's gun. Is this your chicken? And since it's gloomy and we have a bit of chili weather here, I decided to cook a noodle soup which we call loomie in the Philippines. This is the Visiant style loomie. The meat tree loves this noodle soup. The baby is going to play ball with him. Earlier, I bought watermelon in the market. My son loves watermelon and he was full of joy when he saw it. What is it, baby? It's a big boss. It's a big boss. It's a big boss. You're welcome. We love you too. It's a big boss. It's a big boss. We ordered some stuffs online and it arrived today. I surprised the meat tree this sundae because his old one got broken. I also ordered this cute polo shirt for your chicken. You will see him wear this in the next vlog. Beautiful. I bought some stuff I need as well. Bye bye. Monkey, where is the monkey? He's so monkey again. He always see monkey from this forest. There are some monkey here because of these vines. So many vines here, like four monkeys. And every time he sees vines, he always say monkey. It's four in the afternoon here in the Philippines. We are going to the river. We're gonna swim. We're gonna bath there for at least 30 minutes before it gets dark. It's so beautiful here. This is a real jungle. Wow, this tree is so tall and huge. He hit his face there. Really amazing here. The water is so fresh Water is so fresh. I know it's a gem. It's a bit cold but it's cold but it feels so good on the skin. Go Gem. I'm so done! More work? Yeah, alright. I'm so happy! The meat really likes staying in the current of water. He said it's massaging his bag really well. Here, here. Step. One. Two. Three. Two. Three. Two. Three. Two. Three. Two. Three. Two. Three. Two. Three. Three. It's getting dark soon so we are heading back home. The sun is already setting down. There are already so many insects here. I don't know what are these insects. It's trying to get in my eyes. That's hurry up. So many insects. I found wild chilies on the way home so I took some because I love adding them to some sauce or food. I like spicy food. My husband before he met me is not a fan of spicy food but after being married to me he starts to bear spicy food as well. So this is our dinner for today. Fish in vinegar with tomatoes and many other spices. It's called in Hunan in my language. A very common dish in our province. That's all for today's video. Everyone, thank you for sticking with me till the end. I appreciate you so much. Don't forget to write your comments and please subscribe to our channel. Have a wonderful day and till next time.
