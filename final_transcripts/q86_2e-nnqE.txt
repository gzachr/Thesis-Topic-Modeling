 Hey everybody we're getting some corn. What do I eat? Two corn for the good devores. Oh look at that. Oh it's nice and orange. Look at that. Delicious. Thank you. Corn, a choir. Corn, we are so healthy today. It's so yellow. First off the streets of Manila was 25 for this. They're not a bad price. No cheese and MSG in butter added. No salty either right? No. It's pretty much a straight corn. The kernels themselves are sweet. Oh yeah they didn't come right off. Yeah you're down like that clean. Or doesn't have the same flavor as the chamelegon one. It doesn't have like this like saltiness, butteriness inside of it. It's just kind of corn. But it tastes pretty good. It's super fresh and super just comes right off the cob. And all in my teeth. Corn is always good.
