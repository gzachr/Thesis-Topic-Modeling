 How was Maligayang in the channel? Usually I get straight to business but not today you need a little bit of context. So why did I choose to react to this video? It's because the content creator of this video that we're about to react to that goes by the name of Jared Hartman and who is a fellow Canadian DM me on Instagram and asked me if I'd be interested to react to one of his videos because he saw how much I enjoy reacting to Filipino content. And then he explained the concept of his videos and I thought that that was extremely interesting. Okay, so what is this video? So basically he is obviously a foreigner at Canadian, he's white. So he apparently speaks extremely good Tagalog. Alright, so what he does is he speaks Tagalog to Filipinos on Omigal. So you know how I did a lot of reactions to Filipinos who sing to strangers on Omigal like Jens and Gino and Jong Madali Day. Well it's kind of the same thing except he doesn't sing but speaks Tagalog to Filipinos. So I'm guessing he's gonna really surprise them. So the title of this video is White Guy speaks Tagalog on Omigal. It's that simple. And I really want to see the level of his Tagalog because yeah, it's going to be surprising to see a white dude, you know, a foreigner speak fluent Tagalog. Well, I hope his Tagalog is fluent. Alright, before we start, make sure to follow me on Instagram at Music Games because that is where you can DM your suggestions and without further ado, let's get right into it. I love the Tagalog. Yeah, you're Tagalog. Tagalog, come on. Are you fully Tagalog or Facebook? Oh, I'm going. I'm going. Good. How are you? Good. Oh, I'm going. I'm going. Good. How are you? Alright. Okay, so that's him. There you go. Very Canadian looking dude, you know? Where you guys from? Little things. Good looking Canadian dude. Manila. Manila. Hmm. But there's no accent Tagalog. What? Boah! Oh boy. Oh boy. My goodness. You know what's impressive here? It's the speed. Like, you know, I'm able to read Tagalog but I'm slow at it because, yo, man, Tagalog is not an easy language to, to, like your brain has a hard time assimilating it, especially if you grew up speaking English. I did not grow up speaking English. I already speak three languages before Tagalog, right? It's an Arabic, French, English and I'm trying with Tagalog. But this is impressive. And you would be able to tell me if he has an accent. He sounds like a pure Filipino to me. For now. I've never been wearing a Tagalog. I've been wearing it from. Tagakana d'aco. Hey! How can you speak Tagalog? I've been using the language for a while now. I've been using Tagakana for a while now. But I'm using Tagakana. What? Oh my God. I mean, it's true. There are a lot of Filipinos in Canada but not where I'm from. I don't know where he's from in Canada because I'm from Montreal. We speak French mostly. So of course, there won't be a lot of Filipinos here because Filipinos speak English and Tagalog. So they are more attracted to Toronto or Vancouver. So I'm guessing maybe he's from one of those two places. But still, a Tagalog dis-fluent. I don't know if he must have taken some classes or something. How long have you been learning to speak Tagalog? I don't know how much he knows. Okay, I'll take a look at it. Okay. Wow. Okay. I'll take a look. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. But I just want to know what Tagalog means. I think it's the most important thing to know. Wow. Seriously. It's the most important thing to know. Of course. How do you speak Filipino? Not really. Oh, I want to know what Tagakana means. Dude, I haven't been to the Philippines yet. Let's go together. I think we're going to have a great time. But it's expensive. It is expensive. Really expensive. It's one of those things. More than that. Depending of when you buy them, if you buy them in advance, like months in advance, you might be able to purchase them for, like, as low as $1,300, Canadian dollars. But if you wait until the last minute, whoo! It can get up to like $2,500 or something. Just for the tickets. I don't know. My girlfriend now. Oh, no. Is she Filipino, though? 96. And you're 26, you know? I don't know. What if you're going to use that English? The numbers? Well, mix. Because you're going to pick them. Oh, okay. So you're going to use that British? Yes, I know. Sorry. Sorry, I'm not going to use that. Because I was here when I was young. So. You're going to be a kid. Ah! So that's why they said that he speaks better Tagalog than them, because, you know, they grew up in the UK. They probably did not get the chance to practice Tagalog as much as, you know, original Filipinos in the Philippines. When I was seven, yeah. Seven. So, more Tagalog than the long time. Long time. Here, yeah. More than the Filipinos. Okay. So, where are you from? Tagayukedino. A lot. A lot. A lot. Okay. That's a lot. Ah, but I have a good family. Wow. I'm a little bit of a food. Ah, of course. I'm a little bit of a lumpia. A lumpia. I love it. I love it. Oh, yeah, that's what I'm going to have. I love it. Ah, I love it. Ah, so. How are you doing? Good, man. How are you? So, wait. I have a question. Is there a way to choose a country that you want to call via Omigl? You know, can you select like a region or a country or something like that? Doing good too. Are you doing? I like your flag in the back. Thank you. Thank you. You from the Philippines? Yep. Cool. What part of the Philippines is it from? I was from NCR. The... What's the name of the place? Like Montenlupa, Mandela area. Okay. Cool. Maruno Cabang Magtagalog. No, man. Are you a polythacal? No, please, man. Awesome. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. But I know I'm a polythacal. What's the name of the place? I love it. You know, I would explain a lot if he has a Filipino girlfriend. It would make it easier for him to practice the language if he's with a polypina. I'm from NCR. Oh my God. I'm a polythacal. Okay, I'm not that good at singing, but I'm just good. Oh, you're great too. I'm good. I'm good. You're not good at singing. Oh, I was. Why did you choose Jollybee? I chose Jollybee. I have a lot of things to do in my city. Ah, so where is he from? I can go to the Filipino food. Lumpia. Okay, okay, that's good. What's your name? What's your name? Jollybee, why is it called Jolly Spaghetti? Spaghetti. You know, why? Ah, yeah. So the people that tell me about Jollybee always mention the spaghetti, because Jollybee is essentially some type of like McDonald's, right? Like Filipino McDonald's, but they also serve spaghetti and apparently those spaghetti are delicious. So, yeah. What's your name? I'm a double. What's your name? Chicken. Oh, well, chicken. Oh, well, chicken. Oh, yeah. I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. You're good. What's your name? I'm Indian. I'm not. I'm not a punta, right? Oh, punta? What's your name? I'm a punta, right? I want to go to the Philippines. What's your name? I'm a US. I'm a US. What's your name? I'm a US. Okay, okay. I'm a Tagalogian, don't you? I'm a US. Yeah, five years, sir. Five years, no. Okay. You're going to the Philippines, right? Deepa. Deepa. It's expensive, dude. Tagalog. I'm so bra. So bra. So bra. But you don't have to go to the family, right? No, man. So, what's your name? I'm a US. Okay, my ocean. Dude, it's so impressive. I mean, the pronunciation, you know? Because maybe it's a cliche or whatever, but, you know, North Americans are known to not make a lot of efforts to try to speak other languages. And even when they do, for example, Americans when they try to speak French, they're accent. He's just horrendous, you know? But this guy is impressive. I mean, even his okay, he doesn't say okay. He says it like Filipino. He says okay, okay. You know, it comes from the throat like us, you know, Arab-Arab people, right? Like we have the cuck cuck. Yeah. So, you're going to the Philippines. You're going to eat chicken babies. Chicken babies. So, are you sure? What? Oh, you're right. You know what I mean? No, seriously, you're really good. Yeah, so, you're really good. Like, really, really good. I'm so high. I'm not that good. I'm just good. I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't. But I'm really good at eating. But, do you know how to like, text in the garlic? Yeah. The more you know that it's in English, the more you know the spelling in the garlic in English is more. Yeah, the reaction is more like, the salad is more delicious. Oh boy. It's hard to know how to spell in English. Dude, try in French or Arabic. It's, it's painful. It's actually painful. Like, English compared to other languages like French and Arabic is very, very easy. And that's one of the reasons I think why English is like the language of the world, right? Most people speak language. Like, it's the first language in the world. That's the first language. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. I don't have any words. If you speak in English, if you vlog, you'll shock me a lot. Because I'm speaking English. I'm just a vlogger. But I don't have any words to say. I'm stuck in the bush. I'm stuck. I'm stuck. I'm stuck. I'm stuck. I'm stuck. I'm stuck. But what do you think about your parents? Yes. Everybody's there. Yeah, I'm very happy. I'm very happy with my parents. I'm very happy. He's not saying where he's from, which city? Spanish, German. Are you learning English and they speak English? Okay. They start with... I'm stuck in the bush. Damn, that's impressive. So, you're stuck. You're stuck. Three of them. Three of them. I'm stuck in English. Of course. This is my first time. I'm stuck. I haven't seen it. You're stuck. I'm stuck. Where are you guys? Good. You're good. I'm stuck. I'm stuck. You're stuck. I'm stuck. I'm stuck. The intonation. Are you proud? I'm stuck. Wow. You're so good. You're so good. You're not good. You're so good. You're so good. I'm stuck. I'm stuck. I'm stuck. You're not good. Wow. I'm stuck. Hey. There's... There's something. Oh, you two. Okay. There you go. I got my answer. I don't know how long he was with this girlfriend. But it helps a lot to have a Filipino girlfriend. I mean, it just makes sense. I'm not that good at this. Okay. You're so good. Wow. I'm not that good at this. You're so good. You're so good. You're so good. I'm stuck. I'm stuck. Even if he were. He's a Filipino. He's a... He's a... He's a... Okay. I'm not that good. He's just a little bit. He's just a little bit. He's just a little bit. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Mine is... Naya. That's my mother. Naya. I mean... No, that's not true. Is it dialect in the Philippines? I mean... They have so many guys. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. Thank you. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. Oh my god. I think he just word me. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. Thank you, Ate. What's the name of this? I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. But the language in the language is so good. Oh my god. It's so... It's so freaking... Yeah, she's going to say it. You know, she's also still very impressed by how fluent he can speak Tagalog. It comes so naturally to him. He's probably very skilled with languages. You know, some people just have that thing. You know, they just can learn languages more easily than others. You know, and I think he's one of those people, man. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. But I'm so happy that I can speak Tagalog in English. So, it's more impressive for me to speak Tagalog in English. Pish! For languages that's even more impressive. Right? For the title of the year, right? For the title of the year, in the title of the English Tagalog, in the language, in the language, in the language. Yeah, but there's dialect. The language you're speaking is more international. Correct dialects can be, you know. I'm sure. And I'm not saying that when you travel. Yeah. I'm just kidding. Okay, there we go. That was awesome. And seriously, guys, if you guys enjoyed this video, then why not react to a couple more of his videos in the future. And by the way, go check out his channel at Simple. It's his name, Jared Hartman. It's two ends at the end, and I will link it in the title. And also put like a link in the description box. Because I think it's worth it. And it's so surprising to me that he hasn't been to the Philippines yet. I mean, dude, you speak the language so fluently. And you seem to know a lot about the Philippines. I mean, it just makes sense to go there. I mean, I know it's expensive. Trust me. I've been trying to go to the Philippines. You know, I put money aside. And when I was, you know, able to go, the pandemic hit. So that, that ruined everything. And now I'm trying to go again. But I just received the news from my brother who was supposed to go with me. That he changed his mind. So I'm still trying to figure it out. But man, I cannot wait to go. And we would also love to know where you're from in Canada, you know, Toronto, Vancouver. I don't know. Probably not from Montreal though. So there you have it. This was awesome. Maybe one day. I'll be as fluent as he is, you know, it's a possibility. You never know what could happen in the future, you know. You never know. Uh-huh. Yeah. So, I'm Imar Amings, Salam al-Matpou.
