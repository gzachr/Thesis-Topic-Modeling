 Hi guys welcome back to a part two. Yes. If you haven't seen part one check it out before you get into the rest of this video maybe or not. Maybe not but just come back to part two and just sing to a part two. Doesn't really matter. This is singing. Singing Filipino songs into Galaguan Amigo. It's basically this couple from the US we did part one. They don't speak to Galag. They... I don't know if they've been to Philippines but they're just listening to and reading the lyrics of the Galaguan song. So they learn these songs then they go on Amigo and they play them for people who are Filipino or in the Philippines and kind of like see their reaction. Yeah. It's strangely entertaining. They don't know what they're singing because they don't know the language but they're listening to the song enough to be able to know the accent and how to make it sound like they're singing in the song. And from their previous reactions people watching they're quite good. So we're gonna check out a little bit more today. If you've got any requests that you'd like us to react to anything at all send us a link to our Instagrams it'll be on the screen now or you can send us a name with a little video or screen show or however as you want to send it and feel free to do that and also if you're new around here please hit the subscribe button.
