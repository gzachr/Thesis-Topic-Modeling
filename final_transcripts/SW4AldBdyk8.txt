 Oh, it's a toasty one today. It's gonna get worse and march and march to me. Oh god. Hey everybody, today we have an interesting video for you today. We're meeting up with Filipino boo, another vlogger that lives in Arcanno here. We can check out his channel. We don't actually know where we're meeting, but he's set in front of a condo. I unfortunately ran out of data on my thing right now, so I have no contact with him. So the first part of this journey is gonna be finding him. The quest for Filipino boo, where is this man hiding? Wouldn't you find him? You should run up to him and tickle him. I'll just walk out through him and be like, I'll be a great star. How's it going? How's it going? How's it going? Yeah, it's good. Here go pros nicer than ours. Yeah, we have the old one. What's that? Eight. Eight? Yeah. Are you taking a video now? Yep. We bought tickets to Korea now. Oh really? Yeah. How many weeks? Five? Five?

Yeah. I'm not getting my, like, the process is so weird. I'm not getting any cards. I don't have anything. I don't have anything. We're seeing this. Perfect. Yeah, I went made it through the door. First obstacle completed. It's very happy. Yes. The sun is so hot. It's nice, cool. Yeah. I apparently is going to get hotter. I've been in the next year. At home where we're from, there's a blizzard right now. There's so much snow this high. You're cold? Yeah. It's cold. It's like a negative 15. Oh, my God. A lot of parking in America, you need minutes to go to the door. So what do you eat these over here? I can't even think of the restaurants we always went to. I guess we tried so many different ones for videos. We never really went back to the same one over and over. We always just get food canned if we get the same one. Yeah. How about our food? Your food is good. I like you. The. Yeah, that's the only thing we've had. We've had people pop before in, like, other countries. Never Korea. You never have the flavor, my dear. No. You know, it's not so much more flavor. It's better than I think. Yes. Hi. I watched you guys all the time. Oh, really? Yeah. You can't take a photo with you guys. Yeah, sure. I don't know how to do something, you guys. Oh, appreciate it. Yeah, that's great. Nice to meet you. Shake, shake. Coming soon. Shake, shake. Oh, man. It'll be very interesting. I'm going to get a photo with you guys. Yeah, sure. I don't know how to do something. Oh, appreciate it. Yeah, that's great. Nice to meet you. Shake, shake. It'll be very interesting to see the prices on that. It'll be like three or four hundred. It'll be more than three decades of history. Yeah, it probably will. I'm going to get a stick. Okay. Can you wear sunglasses? No, we don't actually. Okay. Sun-Mays to school. It is really strong sometimes. We went to Target Tire recently. And we were looking at the lake. And we were just so bright. And we're going to see a thing. Did I do a work? Yeah. They have some of these in the US. One hundred, and you can get a camera. Wow. Can I go back and back on? Is that where you held this Scooby Snacks? Oh. Right here? Go back and watch that epic video. Oh, it just goes for it. Oh, thank you. Oh, it's sick. He's much more confident than us. We would never have done that. We just finished it back here. Just like, crunched up in a wall. We'd be like, what do we do? Okay. I just try to get a piece. Go ahead. Okay. We've never gotten any. It's crazy how many things we haven't got. So is this based on a weight? Yeah, it's a lot. It's more than one hundred. Yeah. Okay. Okay. First person view. Oh, you can take it. Two hundred, and one hundred. Okay. Oh, it smells like yogurt for sure. No beans. For active beans. I'm sorry beans, but no. I like it. Strawberry. Obviously, you got to get a strawberry. Is this fruit salad? Look at that. Oh, yeah. Avoid the, uh, what's your necollot in here? So, why is it like this? We have to have some pie. How's it going? This is the sitting at the meat. You're going fruity. Are you going fruity? Oh, I went to try fruity. I'm going fruity. I like strawberries. That's strawberries a lot of time. I've got something. Ah, the main. Mangas, you know. Mensum, and ram. I find it quite fruity. Huh? So, did I entice you there? How they got these syrup? I have two. Ah, syrup. It's going to be very sweet. It's super sweet, I bet. One of the main goes so it's me up quick. I have mango syrup. I have mango syrup. I have mango syrup. I have mango syrup. I have mango syrup. I have mango syrup. Yeah. I want to tell me when to stop mango syrup. That's good. I think it's some cereal flakes just for fun. Oh, cool. I don't know if that you. It doesn't say what type of cereal, but it's something. It looks like it would be like a crouton or like a chip. I don't have enough fruit. I think more fruit. Load back up on the crouton. It'd be more than 500. It should stop. The 500 is 100. I think I'm bragging fallout. Oh. I don't like that little tip. I can't. I want to hear it go on now. 75. 75 Ogees. That's a lot. That is. In the US, these things are like six bucks. Yeah. When we win after a P.F. change, how much was that for your family? Yeah, it was probably over 30 bucks. He's loaded up after. That's skill. I think it's worth it. I think it's worth it. I think it's worth it. I think it's worth it. I think it's worth it. I think it's worth it. I think it's worth it. I think it's worth it. Wow. It's just loaded. That's great. You can check the weight. Keep checking. It's worth it. It's worth it. Ah. 500, yeah. I'll tell you again. It's 480 grams. Dang. And now it's 1 hundred. It's over. It's over. That's where we did. Thank you. That's where we did. Thank you. We kind of messed it up a bit. We overcooked it. Everyone was very angry at us. This is sweet. It's a nice, fruity, sweetest. Oh my. Those are very sweet. You're doing a lot of fruit in there. I didn't. You just used to buy fruit basically. Frozen fruits. Everything on one bite. Sweet and cold. It is very cold. It's good. I like that. I put so much of gram. That makes as well with the fruit. It's good for house. Yeah. It's so nice. Very tasty and good value. Oh yeah. Wow. We're learning so much from Filipino food. You've been here for almost a year, right? Yeah. That's the food from Filipino food. Really tasty or bangus? Bangus. Bangus. Bangus. Bangus. All the times we've made videos in S.M. North. We have never seen this place. This is a cool vertical. This is fancy. No, I haven't tried it before. But yeah, we could try. How about this one? I mean, I didn't try that. I haven't. I know. It's surprising a lot of things we haven't tried. It's an eggplant. We've all lollies. They have lollies. Interesting. Oh. Okay. So we got sinegain. Sinegain, that's definitely how you pronounce it. Yeah. Sinegain. We've never tried that before. And we also got taro leaves, which I'm a little... Yeah. I don't know what that means. To see how our opinion is on it. I have taro flavored stuff before, but never leaves. Isn't that the purple? Yeah. Which I... The lighter purple? We have that in Malaysia, the taro pie. Yeah. Okay. What do we have here? Waterfront. That would be good. Hi, I'm Farrell. I'm thinking of waterfront. Sea salt, Korean grill, puppies, souffle pancakes. This is the one that he said. His is better, so don't get it. Okay. Good to know. Oh, here's these things. Remember those? The pancake things. Oh. We have a freaking way up. It looks pretty tasty. I got the one at Popeyes. It was good. It was weird. It was like the inside was so like doughy. At Popeyes, they just call it a pancake. It's not a soup. It's a big thing. Oh, we got that one. That one's an Uber big. Oh, they do the extra load on top for making it here with a shape. Ah. The answer is that. This is way bigger than I thought. And we've literally been right there. How have we not... How have we not come over here? You're like walking on the weird places after biking, I remember too. Yeah. The three souts. Oh, he's got a nice thing for his battery. We lost our charger. So we just plug it into the GoPro. It takes a long time. It does. I'm alone. Oh. That's some buttery prawns. The prawns have arrived. Those look like they're going to hit you in the gut. Clear. That is very true. He's only expensive for the portion here. So maybe there will be a very high pool. They might be. Oh, that's an idiot. Wow. Look at that. All right. Butter prawn. Oh, gosh. This looks buttery. Oh my gosh. This looks buttery. This looks like buttery. Oh my gosh. This looks buttery. This looks like buttery. Oh my gosh. This looks hot. It looks like a good one. Very hot. Very hot. Your face has turned the shade of your shirt. Oh my gosh. My eyes are here. My eyes are here. I got a thing. Oh, buttery. Very good, though. Good. Oh, my tongue hurts. Very good, though. Good. Oh. My tongue hurts. Okay. Wow. That's tasty. I like a little bit of spice on the back end. Good. Do you feel your stomach bubbling already from all that butter? I haven't swallowed yet, wait. Instantaneous. That looks very interesting. It just leaves, right? Yeah. And with the pork, I think. Oh, really? Yeah. It's scoop. Yeah, scoop. And with the rice. Okay. And with the rice. It's a true world. Oh. Okay. That's interesting. That's good. It looks like it would be pungent. Is it pungent? Not really. It's like a basil. It's kind of similar to like a basil flavor. So it's like having like a basil rice I feel like. That's interesting. That's pretty tasty. Hey. Is that what you're asking for? I'm sorry, but I learned. Yes. Yeah. Oh, my gosh. My tongue is still. I think I burnt my tongue. Yeah, I'm going to be able to taste the vinegar. No. That looks like a flavorful broth. So you get a pepper with it? Or the pepper's hot? Is it spicy? Yeah, it's the pepper. Of course it's spicy. I can take it. Oh, you can take it. No. I probably can. It's a chili. I'm not letting that go. I'll open these before I try it. Oh, my gosh. Oh, gosh. Probably not holding. Oh, crack it up. It started immediately. Uh-huh. What the hell? It's the same one. I'm the one in Georgia, yeah. Whoa. That is interesting. I haven't got hit with a pepper. Oh, that's a good one. That's a good one. I can't. I'm going to be able to taste it. It's a good one. I'm going to be able to taste it. That's a good one. That's a good one. I think it's another interesting one. I haven't got hit with a pepper yet. Really. That is really, it's like fragrant. It's like a very like... A very leaky taste. It is, like a basil. Yeah, it's a really good one. And it's probably quite buttery as I'm assuming with a good flavor as well. It's tasty though. It is tasty. It's one of my favorite here. Yeah, it's good. That's good. I've never had anything like that. There's so many hidden foods in here. You don't hear about many of them. I mean like we get recommended a lot of them but there is so many more. That was the Chone Seasig, all the big ones that we got right away. Yeah. A lot of them we haven't touched. Okay, I guess I'll try some of this. I don't know. One shinigang. First time. Yeah. Mix with the rice. Yeah. I was so pure right. Just the gong. Okay, okay. I think you put in here you should be eating the rice. Yeah. How do you eat? I did it with the rice. I'll just put rice in my mouth first. Oh, Korean style. That's how Korea, they... The rice first then... Then we... Yeah. My mouth is gonna be really full. What is it? It's not a bone in here, right? Maybe bones. Pantile. It's okay, it can't spit it out. I'm really bad with bones. We always like boneless stuff. What? I thought it was... I don't know what it was. I don't know if it was a fish. Yeah. I don't know if it was... It's not as sour as I thought it would be. That's actually pretty good. The very... It's more like salty broth than I expected it to be. So the dobo we had in Dubai was so sour. Yeah, I expected this to be like... It's good. Nice. Sinegain. Sinegain. Yeah, let me get some of this broth quick. Mmm. Well, there's a lot of different flavors in there. You can definitely taste some peppers in there, even some spicy peppers. I mean, like what is... We got a leaf here that I don't know what it is. I don't know what the heck this is. Some vegetable thing. Eggplant. Eggplant. Yeah. Oh, eggplant. And then tomato. Yeah. I mean, all those flavors mixed in very well. Wow, that is tasty. It's an unfortunate that there's some bones in here. Very American and western. I like the bones I feel. Yeah, definitely. We both just... How... How are we known for food videos, but we're still so bad at it. It's a very strong broth. I can see myself getting a super thirsty very soon. Yes. Super salty. That's good. I like it. That would be like the flavor profile on a meal like this. Tuts, tuts, tuts. I'd be pretty crazy. I don't know if you can just try one of these. I guess so. I don't know. It was really bragging a lot. My gosh, it's so buttery. My gosh, there's a lot of stuff on there. It's a flavor explosion on there. There's a lot. Yeah. Oh. That's interesting though. It's fuller, but... It actually has a peppery taste too, but it's not spicy. Can I try one of those? Yeah, sure. I'm not within the ice cream, it's something like this. It's good. It's okay. It's just like proud. It's like everywhere. Yeah. The only thing we can't do, we don't know the ingredients ever in things, so we just say the flavors. Mmm. Good shami. Yeah. A lot of sauce on there. You good? Yeah, it's very good. It's just butter, butter. Lots of butter, lots of butter. It's a bit spicy. Oh, yeah, tiny bit. It's okay with you. Yeah, it's good. Yeah, that's perfect about it. It's here finally, it's maybe your finally made apple. Okay, okay. Perfect. Hopefully, hopefully. Yeah. This was really good though. I really like that. Why is your favorite here? You saw Ryan? Yeah. Oh, there's dinner games good though, too. But that one is like, yeah, the hidden one, that's cool. Yeah, it surprised me. Never heard of that. Oh, we didn't make our own sauce to you. You don't have to make it? People always tell us to make it, but we don't like vinegar, so. And we don't like mixing sour things in, and we're not great with spice. I don't eat to something like this. The only time we ever eat it is we do it a challenge. It's a good little meal. Very tasty. We tried Cinegang. Cinegang. Cinegang. We've been together for like three hours. Which, still not that table. There's another cinema. My director's club. Oh. Do you watch Asman? No. We were going to go watch Abbott's car. Oh, you can watch. No. The line was too long. It was sold out. It's so interesting that we didn't know this stuff was over here. Toilet Kingdom though. Oh, Mike, this is what we've been looking for. Like a music. It's like hipster jazz. I've got a little bit of fun here. Oh, what is today? Is there any Friday or Saturday? Wow. What is it? It is busy today. Do you sometimes feel there in Brussels? I've swam a few times. The last time I went I was so cold I just gave up. It's very busy. I'm just waiting for a shake check to open. It's nowhere near the Christmas update. No. What do you guys call it? A vlog. Yeah. Oh, thank you. No, he just asked which way we were recording. He wasn't doing Algae Man's time, right? Did you tap? Just curious. right? Here's your tap. Just curious, sir. I don't know. Nice taking out. Yeah, so let's do one. See you later. Bye. I hit this way now. Yeah, he goes that way. Good bye. Good bye. See you later.
