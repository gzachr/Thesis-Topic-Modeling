 Ya, so where are we gonna go lovely? In rice fields. Okay, so because you're going to eat, the Tovio gonna eat. What? The three of us. We're gonna eat Kohol. Come and walk faster because it's already dark soon. Yeah, so we're gonna pick up some shell from the rice field. Oh, fish out. Don't forget to look at it. I see shell, can you? I feel. Yeah. Come on, come here. Come on, come here. Oh. So, you're gonna eat? Yeah, I'm gonna eat. Did you eat? Did you eat? Yeah. You're gonna eat. You're gonna eat? I'm gonna eat too. You're gonna eat too. You're gonna eat too. Yeah, so it's planting time on the rice field. It's really different. When you're in the mountain area, you know, because only can hear it's the sounds of the dog. You know, and where down there, although it's still, we're still in the province, you know, but we're in the side of the big, uh, brown-dye roads. So, motorcycle, trucks, cars, you know, neighbors. So, I still prepared here, although we tried to sell our land here, which is 19,000 square meter. I'm 200, which is 3.8m. You know, and that's, uh, including all those trees there. I'm gonna trace. So, we're hoping we could able to. So, we could finish the house there down at the same time, bring down the builder house. The house goes to the highway. But I want to leave the rice field and not selling it.
