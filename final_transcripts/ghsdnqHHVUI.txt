 Hello everybody, so we are back. And of course as I mentioned in one of my earlier videos that the requests have been piling up. This one in particular I've gotten it some days ago, but as you know the workload is a bit, you know, much. So I'm just getting around to do it. Anyway, this song is love of my life, which was officially done or originally done by Freddie Mercury from Queen. You know what? Let's get into the video. Wow, he's got so or two. Wow. Wow. And this seemed to be a normal day in the Philippines. This is how good they are at singing. Oh, come on, come on. Oh, come on. Oh, come on. Oh, come on. You can really sing. No, it actually takes a lot to sound like Freddie Mercury. This guy is doing a fantastic job at sounding so much like him. He's really doing it. Wow. And this seemed to be like a regular day out karaoke or just a function at dinner. Wow. Wow. Well, you see what? In the Philippines, you don't have to leave the Philippines to find a talent that can provide you with the same voice or the same thing that you expect from international artists. You can find them locally in the Philippines doing just as great. Wow. This was fantastic. This was really beautiful. This voice is really cool. What's his name? Who is this guy? I'm not sure if these names that he's written in the description is his name or it's just the event title. I don't have not sure. So guys, let me know in the comments section who this guy really is. What's his name? Is he a professional singer of a band? You know, because we need to know more about him. This was fantastic. This was really great work done here by this gentleman, a Filipino, I suppose. Thank you guys for requesting this amazing video. I'm really sorry I didn't react to this before. Now, but it's never too late. Thank you guys and keep, keep requesting and recommending these videos because I really, really enjoyed this one. Wow. Oh yeah.
