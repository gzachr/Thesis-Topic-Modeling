 So this video was taken in April 2022, which was my first visit to the Philippines ever. While editing this video, I crave for burlalo so much now. Oh my goodness. I still have some old clips that I haven't uploaded. They're gonna be uploaded anyways eventually. So I hope you guys enjoy them from this video. I'll start to call you Sylvie Annis. Because you'll see it at the end. Watch it till the end! Wow! Wow! This is it? So burlalo is very famous in Tagay Thai. So I'm gonna have burlalo here. And this is... Oh, super deep! We give you the best part of burlalo. Bon Maro? Yeah, it's called Bon Maro. And what? Bon... Bon Maro? Bulalo in Tagay Thai. The beef is like so deep. Very deep. Hmm? Wanna try that? Super bon. Super bon. So big. So sweet though. No? What? I can't... Are you... When they saw you deep in the whole thing, they were like, oh no. Oh, you're so cute. Oh, so strong. Wow. How do you even stop it? From here or here? Like this? Yeah. This... This is from one, yeah. Does it come out? Oh, what's that? Oh, it's different than the real mes. More power, more pink pink. I don't know the idea of the... What is this? I don't know. I'm trying to find the battery. It's very cool. It's their way of cooking. Oh, very deep. Oh, very deep. Oh, I didn't expect it. This is why you eat burlalo here. Yeah, burlalo is already salty right here. I don't even need any sauce. Oh, no, no. Yeah. I want veggies. I'm gonna take the whole thing. Yeah. To convert lemonade. Peans. Oh, wow. It's a very fresh. Very fresh. Mmm, that's fun. It's like a very good burlalo. Wow, it's so good. It's really strong flavor. Very strong. And very deep. Nobody. Bye. No, no. It's a little juice. Up is... Very good. It's very good. Wow. It's not too sweet. It's not too sweet. I think it's paper baguette. Baguette beans. Baguette beans. Not really. This is baguette beans. Baguette beans. Baguette beans. It's from our hometown. Wow. The beef is so soft. I think this is the best food that I have in the world. Really? Yes. I'm waiting to go to Fambaga. I'm gonna try that in the morning. I think I saw it. It's a different year. I know. I think I saw it. It's a different year. I know. I know. I know. It's so warm. The best part of the baguette beans. A lot of fat. Until now. I was trying bulabo and I was so into it. So I didn't even try it. I'm gonna try it now. I don't know if it's just sticky. It's sticky. It's sticky. It's sticky. It's sticky. Wow. Is this a carrot? It's different. Really different. This is more like a toy. I'm thinking. John. John. It's like John. Because of the screen on the screen on the bed. I love that. I cleared it. I think I like this part more. Correct. And the bulabo. This one. The first step is really good. But then I tried it right now. It's so oily. Okay, after bulabo, I came to a Patala Bhungsa. Because I want a lot of people to try Filipino delicacies. So I came here. It's called Cecilia's Bucupai. I'm basically about a lot of Barcelona's loobong. What I think I'm going to finish it here. With my friends today here. It's called Tervanas. Tervanas. And this one. Pangilina. Pangilina is the name. Pastelia, Plema, delicacy. And this is something that I'm actually really looking for. This actually really looks like one of the kimbabs or sandwiches. Mokbang in a car. I bought it to share with my friends here. Wow. This one is like all packaged inside. Oh, it's good. I was thinking I have to eat the whole thing. Oh, there you go. Okay, thank you. Nation. Free course snack during the day. This is dessert after a good meal at Dinkies Moolalo. This is perfect. Oh, it's powder. It's kind of messy if this one. Wow. Wow. It tastes good, right? It's like dog. Just dog. Oh, it's gone. The outer part is like very powdery. So it reminds me of Tapsar dog. It reminds me of my school days. Hmm, so good. Wow, I was so worried that I have to eat the whole thing like a sandwich. Welcome to the restaurant. Yeah, go set up. You know this is the elementary, actually. Ah, the elementary used to say, yeah, go set up. Start from the 853 Diti. Let's try this one. This is the name of it. Maka ponno with milk. It's less sweet. And the other one with sugar. But I can still feel the sugar. You can actually chew the sugar. Yeah, I don't have any good. My bus riding. Bus riding days. Before there was no express bus like straight to Manila. There's always stop over. Someone will go up to the bus and selling maka ponno. The segment. Say, Pane. Pane. Highly recommended by the two. We should have fish. Pane. Pane. It's really nice to eat that one. It's so fun. I'm very excited. I'm trying to make it. They were not so excited. Yeah, the best one. Peanut. Oh, something. It looks like a cookie. Yeah. Oh, it's so much softer than I expected. I was expecting a cookie. But it's more like cheese. Not really. Crazy. Break easily. I'm really going to be a little bit. It smells so good. It smells like cheese. Oh. So different than what I expected. Wow. It's crunchy, but it's inside it's cream. Yeah, it's cream. I don't know how to describe this. Then outside this crush peanut. Mmm. Wow. Next layer is a meringue. And the last layer is a cream. It's the butter cream. Not this layer. If you're going to do Korean, you can mix the cream inside the macaron and then you have to make it look like a cookie. It's good. It's so good. It's so good. It's so good. This is actually really good. Right. This is deeper and sweeter. It's buttery. It's so good. Wow, it's really amazing. It's so good. It's sweet and sweet. It's cream. It's like a cake. It's like a cake. Mmm. It's good. Shut up. The outer part is like honey. But inside of it is cream. It's really sweet. You can't make it one-two-three. Yeah. And it makes you fat. The taste. The taste is like really fattening. Okay guys, so we are leaving takai-tai and it was such a great opportunity to have burlalu and takai-tai. Yeah. Eh? Sissilia? Sissilia? Sivana? Sissilia? Silvia? Tatucas? Silvia. Silvia. Silvia. Silvia. Silvia. Silvia is in the next... Silvia. Bye.
