Es mi número 1, así que mucho. Así que tengo número 1 y número 9. ¿Mana nangal? OK, esto es... Esto es el cariño que tiene que ver. ¿Cómo es esto? ¿Cómo es esto? Mana nangal es una que puede ser después de separar el mismo de la mitad de la espalda. Es su bebé y fríces de un móder rompido. Es su bebé por mis pasos de los pasos de los dos, por un poco de la luz de la luz. Oh, mi cúrnes. These are like Dominican witches. Dominican witches, they jump to the roof of their house, but they transform into chicken. Don't ask me. I didn't like this. They transform into chicken and they go to the pregnant ladies' houses to eat the babies inside of the home. Yes, that's basically what they do. But Mana nangal, it looks scarier. It looks like a bat because of the wings that I'm seeing. But it's a lady. Oh, my God. What is this? What is this creature? Who comes up with these scary things? Oh, my God. Look at the tone. The sharp end of the tone touches the mother's navel to suck the blood of the fierce and or unborn child. This creature's name was derived from the feeling of wear tangal, which means to separate because of the Mana nangals. A ability to separate itself from the lower side. Oh. Mana nangal can also be a sorceress that beats its villages and barriers. Oh, you guys are barriers too. To feed the self-segment, their shoes and isolated place where she will leave her lower torso while she hangs at night when she separates from the lower torso, she then gains her ability to fly. OK. But when it's the price itself from the lower torso, then it gains the ability to fly and go on. OK. Got it. Don't like it's deadly to Mana nangals when she is in her monstrous form. Should her two halves still be separated with the coming of them, and she will be this role. OK. So if she's caught under the sunlight, like in a separate state, it will die. According to legend, to destroy the Mana nangal, one should search for the lower torso that she is behind during her mighty hunts. Salt, ash, or garlic should then be placed on the spouse flesh, preventing the monster from combining again, and leaving a vulnerable to sunlight. Oh, right. At least we can fight it. I think this is scary, but it's not scary as the tick-ballang. So I'm going to put it in second place. So let's go with number four. The caprae. Caprae or caprae. The caprae is a demon tree. OK. But with more human characteristics, they are giants with glowing red eyes, sharp teeth, very long fingernails, huge, strong, like legs, brown hair, and usually have a beard. They are as tall as 7 to 9 feet. OK. So this giant half human half tree, so far it doesn't do anything scary. Another characteristic of this monster is that they love to smoke a big, ganja pipe that never burns out. And it's believed that the smell of it would attract human attention. I don't even know if I'm pronouncing all of these Philippine on names correctly. So please help me out in the comment section. They like to wear indigenous northern Philippine clothes called Bajag and a belt that can make him invisible. Unlike most of the Philippine monsters, they are not evil. Finally. Oh my goodness. OK. They are not evil, good. Or they don't give people or feel as they just enjoy to scare children that like to stay late at night. OK. Service to society that good. Also love to indulge in human biases like gambling, drinking, and smoking. Some men say that he always carry a beautiful white stone. And if you manage to obtain it, he will grant you wishes. Another interesting thing is that if you reconfriens with him, you will be able to see it. And if you see it on it, the rest of the people will see it as well. This one is interesting. Grantsy wishes. A smoke and drink and gamble with you. It's a beautiful tree. You can sit on it. I think it's not scary. Obviously it's a giant feet tall. It's scary to see such a huge creature. But compared to the others, guys, this is nothing I'm going to put in number 10. OK, because during this art's career, then this one. Let's see that number 10. Mamba Barang. The Mamba Barang is the Filipino version of a sorcerer. The name is derived from the word Barang. The verb Barangong or we, he, we tang, means to place a hex occurs in Filipino is a super. They are ordinary human beings with black money, who torture and later kill their victims by infecting their bodies with insects. What? They use a strand of hair from their shoes and victim, and tie it to the box of worms which they will use as a medium. When they prick the box, the victim immediately experiences the intended. OK, so this is like budu with box instead of dolls. The Mamba Barang keeps his beetles in a bottle or in a section of bamboo, carefully feeding them ginger rolls. So she takes care of them. When the practitioner decides to employ his dark art, he performs a prayer ritual where he whispers instructions and identifies the victim to the meal. So yeah, very scary. Not scarier than one and two, in my opinion. So I'm going to put it in number three. Next one is the Bakunawa. Bakunawa is a dragon in Filipino mythology that is often represented as a gigantic sea servant. It is believed to be the cause of eclipses. It is believed that he or she was just turned into a dragon as punishment. Oh wow. Bakunawa was a beautiful divata, a fairy in the sea. Some say that she was a naga and was the most powerful. One night, she saw the seven moon and was captivated by their beauty and launched to possess them. It appears as a giant sea serpent with a mouth, the size of a lake and red tongue. Whiskers, gills, small wires at its size and two sets of wings. Tom is one is large and ash gray, while the other is small and is found further down his body. Tells about the Bakunawa say that it is the cause of eclipses. The Bakunawa remains that their beauty would rise from the ocean and swallow the moon's whole anger in fatale and causing them to be mortal enemies. All right, so it's definitely scary because it affects nature but it doesn't affect human itself. So I'm going to put it in number nine. So I'm going to move the duand at number eight. I mean, it's not as friendly as Capra who plays with you and smoke with you and gumbles and everything and it's like your pal and grants you wishes. But it doesn't affect human race as much. OK, we have four more creatures to go. Oh my god, the Tina Yacht, I actually hear, no hair. I read of this. They attract female people thinking that they are actually babies but then they transform into monsters and they kill people something like this. This is very fine. They and Ag are babies who die before receiving bad kids and rights. After death, they go to a place known as Limbo, which is a chamber of hell, which embatties that people fall into and are transformed into evil spirits. This fantastic return into the moral realm in the form of goblins to eat living victims. Yes, they eat people. The Tina Yacht can also be the offspring of a woman and a demon. It can also be an aborted fetus which comes back to take revenge on his mother. Most Tina Yacht are said to live in the forest. If they see a human, they transform into what looks like a normal baby. That is what I was saying. When the person notices the Tina Yacht and comes near to take a look at it, the Tina Yacht changes back into a stru form and eats the prey. So Tina Yacht's definitely scary but not as scary as tick balanza. Let's put the Tina Yacht in number four, definitely. Three more to go. Santelmo. Demangalio or Santilmo appears in the form of a ball of fire. The term Santelmo is the shortened form of the Tagalog words a poignis and elmo. Santelmo spy. OK. For other countries, it is like a whiz. An atmospheric ghost light seen by travelers at night, especially over bugs, swams or marshes. So this is not a monster. It's like a ball of light. Santelmo's fire has ranged from a ghostly dancing plane to natural fireworks. The flame is heatless and non-consuming, occasionally accompanied by a hissing sound. OK. So it doesn't burn. It's just like fire or lights in the sky. It was scientifically explained as electric fields, which have diverged from the lines. However, the sightings were reported since the Spanish era. So this actually exists. And it's been proven scientifically. Wow. So since these are just ball of fire that are not even bad or lights or something, I don't think it's harmful. Grappin' in number eight. Yeah. Number eight, Santelmo. OK. To more creatures to go, we have Mancuculam. Sorceres who cast evil spells to humans. How many sorcerers creatures do you guys have? I mean, please, no more sorcerers. No more witches. This bewitcher is also called manga gawe. And the Mancuculam uses dark magic, or maybe. The difference between a man babaran and a mancuculam is that the man babaran uses magical insects to bring harm to his victim. Yeah, we saw that. So this doesn't use insects. They use dark magic. Culam is a form of folk magic practice in the Philippines. It puts emphasis on the innate power of the self and a secret knowledge of magic, a badger, or low magic. Heirs, fire, herbs, spices, candles, oils, and kitchenware and utensils are often used for rituals, charms, spells, and potions of diseases, the kind of witch who will make a potion as we say in the Dominican Republic in Enzalmo, that is going to either help you in life or help you with to curse somebody else, I guess. Primarily, primary methods employed by a mancuculam are candle lightning ritual, scrying or towers, recitation of spell and concluding potion. So these are looking more likely. American version of witches. Modern popular culture also depicts the mancuculam as using either photographs or decruvalling of a buddhudo. So this makes buddhudo, like with actual buddhudo, now it box like the other ones. So I guess in that is still a witch. He's still scaring, not as scary as Mamba Barando. So I'm going to place that in number five, mancuculam, number five. The last one was difficult. Oh my goodness, yes. Aswan. Aswan's are shape-chifters. They are human-like by day, but transform into different monstrous form to harass and eat awake humans at night or day, especially pregnant women who are about to give birth, oh, sweet baby. So this is like a combination of the Mananangal. I think it was the Mananangal who ate babies with a tongue and everything. Oh my God, I was just thinking about it. But it's shape-chifters. They also eat people. Aswan's can change from a human to an animal form, usually as a big black bird with a long tongue to take as a half-barried monster, Mananangal. As a bat, a cat, a pig, or a black dog. So yeah, definitely this is a combination between thick balheng and Mananangal. And this is even scarier. Aswan's appear at night, rarely during the day, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't. To pray upon on wary travelers or sleeping people, it is said that they have a peculiar liking for the taste of human liver. Also have a peculiar liking for the fetus of pregnant women and are said to find their quarry by the scent of the mother, wish to the aswan smells like ripe jackfruit. Often finding the house of the pregnant mother, they take a light on the roof from where it stretches its tongue until it is as thin as a thread and uses it to enter the womb and feast on the fetus. Oh my god, just looking at it. I can't. Oh my god. So this is definitely number one. This is the scarier ever. I mean, thick balheng also is really scary, but as since this aswan type is a combination, I think it's even scarier. So the top 10 creatures in waters are going to be. Okay, so after watching this scary video, let's light up a little bit the mood with washing the wrap from Mikey Bustos. Let's see how he portrays the mythical creatures and also giving a wrap explanation on everything. So let's have a laugh. So you want to know more about the Philippines mythology, huh? Yes. And this one, why do you have a British accent? What are these third eyes? Okay. We'll explain everything. I'm going to show you a little bit. I mean, this is like a movie trailer. So you guys need to have a third eye to see this creature. Click and we know in the comments. Other than that. If you go back here, you're probably a part of us. The story is from your Nana. How we put our curse on you. If you don't give us a highlight, we're in many curlers plus white and green, but unless you have a third eye, then we are never seen. We are magical and powerful. Mistake, you can still laugh out of us. And we tell people what perhaps in my heart, how much I love you. Oh, this is the culprit. Wait. I'll leave her now. The culprit. The spirit that I spoke to you is really close. I'm talking to you, but I'm not sure at the bottom of my cheeks is what you do. I'm a big boy. Oh my goodness. Okay, this is the new one. We didn't see this in the compilation. In the night, while you're on the lighter drive, you see me please stop. Or you see me spread eyes. No. What? What's that? I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Oh, Serena. We say Serena, we say C. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. But they still, I'm not being a thing. I'm not making sex up with the intervention like I'm being a wreck. It's beautiful. I pull you deep down to your part of my life. I'm a ordinary girl. By night, I'm a half body man. Oh my gosh, I'm an adult. They were looking at me. I'm going to be a fucking out. Okay. I'm going to be an adult. No, don't worry. The characters in this video are critical and are not true. Except for the wedding, they are real. Okay. Don't fucking out. Very nice.
