 Ladies and gentlemen, it is getting bright. So I just hit the bed to sleep. I started singing like, you know, through the clothes and I'm like, what is going on? And it is getting bright. And this is 4, 4, 5 to 9. You can see that my screen is about 4, 5 to 9. And it is getting bright already. So for the fact about the Philippines, it gets bright before 5am. And well, this is June. I don't know, but as a June is getting bright before 5am. Well, thank God my hotel room has very thick curtains. Again, they get me because I sleep like day time. I'm in morning sleep, but actually so. All right, I'm going to go to bed now. I wonder what time we come to actually hit the road. All right, you later. Hello from Manila, the Philippines.

It started raining while we're having our super amazing street food at that corner. So, everywhere I went, it's a day was in Makati. So, we just explored Makati today for, you know, just to see how Manila looks like. And then tomorrow we are going to go into other parts of Manila, you know. It's going to be quite an adventure. So, my first impression of the Philippines is truly amazing. Like, I want to talk about the Filipinos, right? They are super nice. Like, always smiling. I mean, you can't talk well, you know, my first day here, actually. Everybody I spoke to, we're all smiling. That's one thing I noticed. This smile a lot while talking to you. And even when people are just passing you by the streets, they are smiling at you. They are greeting you. And then, you know, when I see people out greet them, Kamusta and I say, okay, like, everyone does that. And like, everyone is so happy. I had an amazing first day in the Philippines overall. It was an amazing first day. So, because while we're taking a walk, it almost started to rain. So, we had to rush into the nearest restaurant. And it was in McDonald's. So, we had lunch at McDonald's. And then, while walking back to our hotel room, we had the street food. So, tomorrow, I really want us to have like a Filipino food, right? And we couldn't really get that because of the weather, because we went out late. So, tomorrow, we're going to start our day earlier. So, I really want to eat Filipino food. Like, I really want to have that. So, we're going to explore that tomorrow. So, if you want to be seeing more of our adventures in the Philippines, then do subscribe to the channel.
