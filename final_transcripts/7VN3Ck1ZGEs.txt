 ... Good morning everybody, it's a gorgeous morning. Another video. We had so much rain, it's not funny. At last we are not connected to the power grid. As you see on the last video, which is good. We have to pay extra because we're connected with the neighbors. So that's good. And the best thing is that my 13-A visa has been approved. I was great news. And also my car could be finished today or tomorrow. On the van. And my laptop took it for repair. So it's a beautiful morning. Show her face. She loves that song. Okay, let's have breakfast. No avocado yet. So just spread tuna, egg, garlic, and turmeric tea. And of course fruit. Sunny day, but very windy day. Sorry about the noise. Just got to fix that window and that's it. We can't take this all gone. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. Okay, when I was panning, I just found out this horrible thing. I'm sure there's water guys over there. Okay, so I had to be rough, but I would clean up later when everything is dry. But it's important that the water doesn't go in between the timber. And I look a bit rough, but okay, so that's it for now. Anyway, after it's all dry, I will sand it and flatten it or whatever you make it look nice. And a bit of a pat on top. Okay. So, I could take this scaffolding off now. And start doing the hand rails for the veranda. There's another thing worry me. This cardboard timber work. I don't like it. But that's all the timber we had. It's not a boy's fault. That's just the timber we had. So, I'm going to buy some metal stud and replace all those timber. I just keep the timber the top for the roof, but all in between is going to have to be in metal studs. Like I remember, I build all my walls like this. So, that's what I'm going to do. As you show, show you something on the screen. This is what I'm going to use. But I need a card to carry those things. So, I can't do anything. But anyway, I'm not going to worry too much for now. And we had a sunny weather this morning. And now everything is getting all the cars very windy. Thunderstorm coming. The story of the day is in mid-and-hour. So, we'll see you in the morning. I can't do my chores today. I'm going to run, win. That's an interesting story. What was it going to do? It's terrible. That's funny. Yeah, better cross the road. I guess, in the morning, hopefully we've got a blue sky. We're expecting the car today, but as a show-up tomorrow, otherwise. Wow. Good morning. This is from the bedroom. I don't think I'm going outside. Even in the granda. It's raining so much. It's crazy. I'm having a lot for this. So much water coming down here. This morning, I was supposed to take this scaffolding off. Wow, who wants to go there? Nobody. What's up, a crazy girl? Look at this. But it's good to go low. The water going around the house here. And the... It's flooding up there all the time. This road, this road here. I don't think it'll be years. It's crazy. So, supposed to work in the granda, but. I need to go buy food stuff. But I'm not going anywhere with this weather. That'll chicken there. Am I missing any egg yet? Have you laid any egg yet? This is crazy. I really wanted to clear this mess, but. How we're going to do? We need to go outside. We need to bring a lot of things to the side. We're ready to make a few more of those. Handrails. Then we think it's to put some bamboo or an icon on the top to stop the water coming to the granda. Maybe we can do some work on the bathroom, but I can't because I need to buy a few things. There's a lot of things we should be down in the house, but I'm stuck. I need a towel to buy things. I don't have a towel yet. I'm supposed to come yesterday, but I haven't shown up. Hello, baby. I can't let's have breakfast. Good to cut. Push, yeah. Good job. Very good. What's the time for you? I'm going to finish it. Another side. You cut. Okay. You cut. Wow. Okay, I just finished doing the ceiling of the sink all around. This time with the right one. And I should be fine now. I did a big clip up and then redo everything again from scratch. I had job, but I had to be done. This is what I use. Anti-bacterial. Draw a purple silicone sealant. I hope it will last. Okay, we got our card back at last. Almost a month. We do this. You know what? We do this every day. Bansing is not going to rust for long while. Still I have to do a little bit of a clean up here. I guess. It's okay. Okay, we accept it. Alright. That's going to be on YouTube. It's the man who did the job. It's a mechanic. So if you want to spend your car and your in depolote, give me a call. Good morning. Now we got a religion today. Hold on. That's a flag of Monday. Wow. So now we're ready. Nobody on the road. We got our power outage. No electricity. We're going to go to the car yesterday. A sunny... I want to go somewhere today. Wow. I just see the whole road done there. It's crowded. I just saw two. It's like two. Let's see here. There's no beach in that. There's no really little problem for the road. I'm good. Oh, no. It's covered out. I'm going to go to the car. I'm going to go to the car. I'm going to go to the car. I'm going to go to the car. I'm going to go to the car. I'm going to go to the car. I'm going to go to the car. She loves me. Everything is happening on the car. She reacts. She's 10 months. I'm going to go to the car. I'm going to go to the car. I'm going to go to the car. I'm going to go to the car. I'm going to go to the car. I'm going to go to the car. I'm going to go to the car. I'm going to go to the car. There's no bar coming up. This is amazing. I still got this. This is very similar to what I get. This time of the day with a smart plus. I probably get 2 or 3. This is pretty good. I'm going to go to the car. I'm going to connect the external channels. See how we go. Let's try the external until I see what happens. Look at this guys. I think I can still fine tune the external antenna. Look at the upload. This is good news. I'm happy. Anyway, we'll see what we do on live stream on Sunday. I think I've done well to get this thing. 1378. I never reached that. Maybe different from the day. I may have a mate very rare with a smart brawl. But this one here, I just throw away and see there's only four bars. I could do a little bit of fine tune on the external antenna. This is good news. Wow. We're going to go shopping. We'll come back and try to adjust the antenna a little bit. Looking really good. Let's close everything. And start YouTube again. See how quick. This is very good. This is excellent. Okay, let's go shopping. My two beautiful girls are waiting there. I haven't been shopping for a long time. Almost a month. Because the car was being respite. Alright, let's go. Let's go shopping. Let's go shopping. Let's go shopping. Let's go shopping. Let's go shopping. Okay, the laptop fix here. Like those young boys. That's about time I really needed. That's another good thing. He's just doing some updates. He's doing some screenshots of death. Screen we call it. So I have to reformat everything. Install everything. At least I'll have a laptop. And I do a last trim of the laptop. Much better. It's got a camera. I've been doing everything. Okay, we finished our grocery. There's those three boxes. Seven more. Five thousand pesos. Mostly grocery. Hello, Prety. What have you been hiding? But nothing expensive for the baby. Like baby milk and diapers. Because if we had to add that up, it would be another five thousand. And then city had way about more of those. I think you recognize them. And see if we can finish the edges of the lounge. Especially between the floor and the wall. And I got to make something here as well. Between the floor and the wall. Just put two pieces there. Seal everything. The only thing I've been bought is the plastic. John here to provide water to go in. But I never see any water to go in. The mama but I still have to buy that. I'll have you just simply put a piece of that. But I don't know if the door's gonna go over. So I will see. Okay, we got a beautiful sunset here. 6 pm from the Veranda. Just from the front of our house. Thank you for watching this video. Until the next video. Take care. Go bless you all. Bye bye. Bye.
