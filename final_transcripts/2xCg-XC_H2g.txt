Now guys, we plan to go to this nameless forest just a walking distance from my step-mong's house. Only the local people know this place and it's not that famous in tourist but I heard now recently that there's a lot of tourists visiting the forest. And so we brought the local kids with us since they know the way. And I just called it nameless because it doesn't have a name yet. So if you're planning to visit Samo Island, you might explore this forest and I guarantee you it's going to be quite an adventure. I'm so proud of you. I'm so proud of you. I'm so proud of you. What?
