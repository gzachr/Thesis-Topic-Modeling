 Myong-bunta-kanin-yong-tanan. Welcome back to WeWonder. I'm Kuyakote. I'm Dakota. We're going to react to Jolly Bee videos. This isn't only what I do on this channel, but so many of you guys watched the last one. So many of you guys seemed to really like it and recommended these videos to us, so we're like, shoot, dude. We gotta keep going. We gotta keep watching. Every video we're watching today was recommended by you guys to watch. If you guys haven't seen the last video that we did, you might wanna go watch it, unless you already know all the Jolly Bee videos. Two of these that we're watching today are sequels, the videos that we watched before. Are you hype, bro? I'm very hype. I'm excited. I'm excited. I'm hyped to be sad. You're hyped to be sad. I'm hyped to get those feels. Yeah, people told us that we kinda misunderstood it. They're not necessarily meant to make a sad, even though they all seem to be sad. They're meant to just make you feel, I guess? Like feel something? So if you feel nothing, you don't have a soul. If you feel nothing, don't go to Jolly Bee. Go to Matt though. Matt though. So we're gonna start with... Perfect payers? Yeah, we're gonna start with this video here. Jolly Bee Perfect Payers. So this one in the last one was where you thought the two were gonna get married in the last second. She split off with the other one. Yeah, so she was married. So that one was called Val. Val. So if you guys have seen Val, this is the sequel to that one. All right. So yeah, with like what Dakota was saying, if you haven't seen it, you don't wanna go watch it, basically. The whole video showed like this guy was gonna get with this girl. They're really good friends. They've been together for so long. And then she's walking down at the wedding. He's standing there and then she looks right at him and then goes past him and marries another guy. And we were like, eff this girl. So maybe this is gonna give us some more context. Maybe they got some creepy. Yeah, maybe that guy's a serial killer. It's true. We're gonna find out. Maybe she had no idea who he was. Yeah. What? He was a stalker? Yeah. Oh my God. CARENE Well, yeah, what did she do before? I lost everything I looked at. Tall ahead of me? I used an example. Now, just tell me, you studied beautiful girls. Who knows? I'm gonna call aè¯¶. Your very best friend of mine. So, please kidnap me. Just teach me how long it is now. Okay. I kaum you want? Isn't it from the first? Yeah, because she I remember that from... Okay, yeah, yeah. Oh, no, that was a different... So it happened to her? What? Oh, so she wanted him and then he saw her. Whoa. Okay. At that moment, Alamkung, I wasn't the one you wanted to spend the rest of your life with. Oh my gosh. If you haven't noticed, I've thrown a lot of English. She's a lot of English. She is. No. But I'm still your friend. So, the whole group had a best friend that was a girl. He's not the girl. He's not the girl. No, he's the one that doesn't get married. Okay. I need to re-watch that one again. They will be there whenever you need me. Okay, here we're getting more pressure. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, man. This is just a whole complicated meal. It's always be just your friend. Oh my god. They got this button. No, he's, yeah, dummy. Here we were on this guy's side last time. Yeah. And he was friends only. He heard a whole time. Uh-huh. You know better. It's like you can't, they can't see what they have right in front of them. Are they dipping their french fries in honey? I'm not sure if that's honey. I don't think it is. What is it? Tell me please. Cause I want to try that. I think it's a gravy. Is that her? I think so, yeah. She come in like, I'm on that glow up boy. Hey, it's you. Is this she taking? Yeah. Now the woman sits down. Is that her? Or is she doing it again? Yeah, okay. Sana, you go then. Oh. That went over my head for a second. I hope you are. Oh. Whoa, boy. All right. She's like, okay, so you don't get the one you want. So you come to number two. That's all I am to you. Oh yeah. It's all coming together. That's right. Everything in did you in a good way. That was good, dude. Yeah, that was good. I didn't necessarily get emotional, but the fact that that is a sequel to the other one. I guess this was the next year. I don't know. Maybe that one got repopped. What is this? That's rice. That's a rice? Yeah, yeah. Huh. Yeah, it's rice. I mean, this is the chicken. Okay. The chicken looks delicious. That's truly gravy. I'm sure it was. Yeah, it's got to be. Who's dipping their french fries in gravy? Admittedly it doesn't sound like... Philippines. Philippines, I know. Admittedly it doesn't sound like a bad idea. I mean, I'd rather put the gravy on this rice thing, I'll be honest. Maybe they do that, too. I don't know. I've done it here in America. Thank you guys so much for suggesting me, because that was really good. I'm sitting here watching, then I'm literally thinking like, this is a whole universe. Uh-huh. Is there another sequel? Is this like the Marvel Cinematic Universe? Yeah, like who did she friend zone? Uh-huh. That's what I wanted to know, though. How deep does this go? Is there a third one where it's like... Yeah, and now, but she's ending up with him, so this third dude's really alone. So he's the murderer? Yeah, that's the murderer. Uh-huh. Poirangal? Maybe that means tribute. Probably. Parangal. Parangal? Parangal. That's how it didn't shite over here. Parangal. Parangal. We're gonna watch Parangal. So this one is the sequel to date, which is the one where the dad was like dying. Yes. Remember? And he was like telling him the kid what to do. So yeah, yeah. The whole thing builds up. This kid's like setting up this perfect date situation, and you hear a guy's voice telling him what to do, like how to set it up. And it's for his mom. And then the end was the twist of the dad's like in the hospital dying. Or is dad already? I heard some comments they might have been done already, and that it was like pre-planned. Could have been? I don't know. They're not clear on that, but maybe we're gonna find out now. Always a true story. So the sequel's a true too. That means the other one, there really was all that going on in real life. You think this is the kid? Yeah. For sure. The kid is the one who's been doing this for a long time. He's the one who's been doing this for a long time. The kid is the one who's been doing this for a long time. That's why we're all here. The kid is the one who's just like me. He's just like me. He's just like me. I know he's just like me. I know he's not making a difference for you. Mom, you know what dad is doing? You know, my dad is just like you. He's just like me. Because he's just like me. Joanne, I know what you're doing for him. I know he's just like me. But he's just like me. I'm just like him. Bro, you better go hug your mom right now. Right now. She's busy bro. After this. Thanks for everything mom. I'll treat you to some jolly bee. What about something a little nicer? There's nothing better than jolly bee. It's not? No, I don't know. For all the mothers who are willing to do everything for their children. That was, I don't think nearly as jarring to the heart as the original. Right. But again, it's really interesting just to see a sequel to it, a follow up. Yeah. See where it went? I agree. Yeah, it was really good. Yeah, it does make you, I do need a good tell my mom. Mom, you're probably watching this. My mom lives. Thanks for everything mom. My mom probably won't watch this. She never watches anything with me. Ouch. So, Dakota, I want you to try and read the Tagalog. Do your best. Okay, so bottom up. I'm going to read the Tagalog. Do your best. Okay, so parasa mya nane. Mya? Yeah. For the MGA? Yeah. Okay. Mya nane ha handa gaweem an lahat parasa anak. I don't think it was that bad. I mean, as a white dude who doesn't speak Tagalog. Did I get that one right? That was the only one over there. That he went was definitely wrong. Oh, what is it? Manga? Manga? Manga? Okay. I thought about doing that, but it's usually when it's like that in a lot of languages. It's like mya. All the comments are about to roast me. It's not my- What are you talking about? It's this. Let me try. Let me try. Let me know how I do in the comments, guys. Parasa manga nane nane ha dang gaweem an lahat parasa anak. Anak. Anak. I feel like I did not do much better. I'm about to say this. Other than that one, it's sort of the exact same. Oh, and I said nane. And you said nane. I said nane. I'm pretty sure. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, guys. We have one more video we're going to do today for you guys. So here's what's up. A lot of people commented that we should watch the video called Choice. I mean, like a lot of people commented that. Yeah, they do. Dakota requested specifically last time that he wanted something with pets. So- That's what get me. You want to get me. Yeah, I'm going to get it. So my choice is to watch the pet one. You want to come back and see me watch Choice. Us watch Choice. You got to come back for the next reaction. We promise on everything. We're going to do Choice in the next one. Promise. It's already guaranteed. Let us know some other ones to react to too. But this one is actually not from Jolly Bee. We're switching things up. Flipping the script. So this is from Globe. People who watch this channel, they know that generally this is a cat-focused channel. But I just want to be clear, dogs are loved here too. So this is totally- Especially by me. This is from Globe. So I was telling Dakota that Globe is a cell phone service provider and Internet provider in the Philippines. It's actually the one that I use. I have a Globe SIM card in the back of my phone. It's in the case. Oh, oh no. Hi, buddy. It's hungry. Oh, I'm not going to make it for this one. We're just getting started, bro. Oh, boy. I don't know if there's even subtitles on there. Arphid needs it. I'm not sure. And it's a lot of things in the world. It's just a little basic doggy talk. Get your ass back here. Oh, sorry. Oh, it's so full. I want to hug it. I'm really, really. He's a good boy. I can get up, dude. I got a poop. Let me out. I tell my dogs to go away when they do that. I'm sleeping. Oh. So precious. Oh, he is. I'm fine. Oh, I taught one of my dogs that. You say give me paw. And then say give me the other paw. No. No. That's been passed down my family for generations 49 years old. Oh. Oh. And it's Christmas. It's a Philippines, a no-sno for Christmas. So it's not Christmas. Don't challenge Filipino Christmas. No. Oh, no. Oh. No. No. Oh. It's a nice house. It's a nice house. Yeah. Oh. It's a Christmas miracle for them. Yeah, for them. Yeah, that's right. Oh. I'm going through. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, come on. Oh, come on. Oh. Oh, come let us adore him indeed. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. You got me. That was good. You got me. That one is really heartwarming. I told you. Wow. You threw a pet in my face. You're going to get me. Dude, Globe is really good indeed. What the heck? Yeah. It's really emotional commercials. But, man, who would have thought? That was not sad. I mean, it was sad, but it was really heartwarming. I mean, wow. Maybe sad for a second. Yeah. I honestly, when they called him up, I was like, bro, they're going to give him the dog for christmas. I was like, wow, that's too much. But nothing. Dude, like no, this is our dog. You can just, how about you just come over sometime. Clearly, you have no family or something. You're clearly alone. Life is dead. Oh, my God. I don't know how much for recommending on these. Especially that dog one was really good. So those who found that one, I mean, that was awesome. Oh, guys, go ahead and recommend other videos for us to watch. We are 100% watching choice. We need like two more. So clearly, they don't have to be jollybeat. Give us anything that you think. Doesn't necessarily have to be emotional. It can be. Yeah, it doesn't even need to be sad. Funny, shocking, interesting in some way. Something that you think an American would find, like, would have a reaction to you. Yeah. So I mean, I've seen a lot of things because I've been in the Philippines. But the code is, you know, very little about the Philippines. I mean, you didn't even know what jollybeat was last time. No, I didn't. And you didn't know what globe was. I think I heard you mentioned jollybeat. Yeah. Like from your first trip to the Philippines, but no plans yet. But I'm already throwing around the idea of possibly going up to Chicago with some friends, including Dakota, to have them try jollybeat for the first time. It's like three hours away. So. Yeah. It's just like so crazy to go. We're driving over six hours just to have some jollybeat. Hey. But I mean, yeah, yo, yo, yo, I mean, I've had jollybeat, but I would love to have them. Hey, you traveled over 14 hours. I wasn't just for jollybeat though. Yeah. Yeah, hey, he's, I'm going to come down to the Philippines. I just want to have some jollybeat and I'm going to head back real quick, all right? Yeah, I'm just. I'm good. Plain mayor, plain bag, quit 24 hour trip. Yeah, yeah, nothing special. I'll be back tomorrow. All right, guys, thank you so much for watching. Don't forget to share, like, comment, and subscribe. And we will be back with more of these. Don't worry if you're into like my vlog content and that stuff too, because those things are still coming, just working a lot right now. Well, blah, blah, blah, blah. Anyway, yeah. Thank you guys for watching and we will see you soon. Peace out.
