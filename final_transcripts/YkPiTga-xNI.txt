 What is that? Didn't it go on? Chocolate stew? Wait, chocolate stew, I love chocolate! It's port blood. Wait. I'm eating the board of fangs! Um... is this plastic necessary? Yes, it keeps the car fresh. Okay. Was that the plastic? Oh no, that was a fart. Oh, I need to replace the plastic now. Dream on! Breathe, sing with me! Come on! Mmm, dinner is served! There's hot dogs in that spaghetti. It's Filipino spaghetti! Okay. This is so good! It's way better than Italian pasta. Oh yes, of course. Oh my god, breathe, did you see that? What? The three-pointer! I was like Jordan Clarkson! Who? You don't know Jordan Clark! You mean the singer? He's Filipino! Let's get one player! Oh, that's Kelly Clarkson. Since you're the gun! Oh, time to get up. Mmm. Better than coffee. Maybe I should go to a car shop for this one. Oh no, don't worry. I got the Filipino hookup. Um, is it you? Oh no, not this time. My Tito knows the guy. This pizza is so good. Mmm. Just a thing rice. Ew! Why would you do that? So good. Oh my goodness! That is so good! Babe, what time is it? Why is that guy your wallpaper? That guy is legendary boxer and senator Manipek Yao. And most importantly, he is a singer. Oh no. That is the last time you're... Babe, get ready to be serenaded. Let me guess. House of the Rising Sun. You know it. There is a house in New Orleans. What guy looking at you? Oh, but no one's looking at me. Hey, you see this? You're a muscle. Huh? You know Manipek Yao? That's my brother. Not Manipek Yao, your brother. Yes, he is. Mmm. Seriously, who do you love more? Oh, don't make me choose, please. You already chose. Okay. You know, I am so thirsty. Oh, okay. No worries. Oh, thank you. You're welcome. Can't let my girlfriend go thirsty.
