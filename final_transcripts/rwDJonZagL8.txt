Tada! It's Wana!
My lady, what's up with that?
Free!
I have studied English in the Philippines, Cebu and Babio for 2 months
And I have experiences of Filipino school life
But I'm so curious, in Japan, there are so many Filipino students
How is their life?
Are you interested in their life as well?
I think Japanese people...
Japanese have so many...
So maybe they think it's like so stressful to speak
These students, every day they learn
It might be, I don't know
Recently I found the video

And she took a video, it's like a vlog style
So today we're gonna watch Filipino student life in Japan
