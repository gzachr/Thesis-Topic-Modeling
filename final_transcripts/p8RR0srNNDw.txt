Let's do it Hey everybody welcome back to fun with flags today We're gonna be taking a look at the flag of the Philippines now the Philippines have been populated for a long time But as we know flags are something quite recent in the large picture of history in ancient times native population inhabited the Philippines, but they didn't have any flag. It looks like for them We can find who flag would be the symbols through which they represented themselves or through which they were depicted by historians Like this ancient painting just changed the nose I will see you which seems to contain some symbols dating back to around 2002 found in Bhutuan But all of this changed in 1521 when Portuguese explorer Magellan arrived in the Philippines and claimed the islands for Spain So technically the first official flag of the Philippines would in fact be the Spanish colonial flag Which evolved a little throughout time. I have a video on the Spanish flag on my channel So if you're interested. So that was the original uh That was the original symbol Yeah But they're basically saying the original flag would have been technically the Spanish flag right yeah Check that out during Spanish occupation There was also a British flag flying over the Philippines the flag of the East India trading company Which flew during the Brief British occupation of Manila from 1762 to 1764 However, despite Spanish colonialism, there were still a few natives in control of some regions At least for some periods of time and there were also attempts of revolt So there are a few examples of native flags in this time like the red penance used by the kingdom of Tondo The plain yellow flag of the Sultanate of Magin danau the flag of the Silang revolt the Sulu Sultanate the Basi revolt and some provincial insides Their second official flag was also a foreign one after being ruled by the Spanish the islands were seated by Spain To the United States of America because of their defeat in the Spanish-American war which ended in 1898 In return the US paid a sum of 20 million dollars to Spain During this time there was an attempt by locals to create a free Philippine Republic and this movement counted with a support of many It's crazy how little that is yeah, I mean it was in the 1800s. So I'm sure it's a lot more back then oh it But for an entire country to pay that it's like I mean I think the same thing happened for buying like The what did they call it the this When they bought out parts of the United States, they paid like next to nothing in the grand scheme of thing He said 20 million yeah, yeah, I mean in the 1800s. I would imagine that's probably like a billion dollars I would think more I have no idea I'm just guessing I don't know. I'm not a good person. I guess it does actually It's a lot yeah, but for a country it's probably not and the US wasn't like What it is today. Yeah, it wasn't super rich, you know I mean just from the start to here they've been through quite a few flags Yeah, yeah, and saying about yeah groups and factions inside of Philippines Which had their own flags the majority of which were read with some white symbols in the center like the flag of the Magdalor Katipunan faction the flag of the Tagalog Republic the Sultanate of Sulu which was still around and occupied Only a bit of territory in the Philippines Zamboanga Republic or that's for the Republic of the Yaknavatu This last one was the first official flag of the Philippine Republic and was used during the Philippine Revolution But there was also the main independence flag if you will the flag of the first Philippine Republic Which resembles today's flag it was flown the first time in a skirmish against Spanish troops The Filipino forces were led by General Aguinaldo who had been in exile in Hong Kong and had brought this Revolutionary flag with him to represent the independence movement It contains a mythical son with a face similar to the son of May in other former Spanish colonies The triangle of Freemasonry and the eight ways representing the eight rebellious provinces against the Spanish The three stars represent the three main islands The flag carries the text in Spanish saying expeditionary forces of northern Luzon and on the back It says freedom justice and equality but the problem here was that the US weren't very happy with the idea of a free Philippines so when they received the islands from the Spanish they imposed direct administration All the way until 1919 using their own national flag to represent the islands Finally in 1919 the Philippines got their own official flag using the previous design by the general Emilio Aguinaldo But with a few changes the tones of the red and blue were to match the ones on the American flag And the sun's face was removed and the Spanish text was also not present However these specifications weren't made official So a lot of variants of the flag flew all over the Philippines In 1936 these specifications were finally codified the shade of the colors the fact that the white triangle Should be equilateral and at the rays of the sun should be somewhat simplified So if I'm not mistaken this is the same flag we have right now right for the Philippines So it's it stayed the same for quite some time right And this was the flag in use until the 1940s but then came World War II During the war the Philippines were put right in the center of the Pacific theater of war Being a puppet or an ally if you will of the west they were put in their wrecked conflict with the Japanese And targeted by the empire in their expansion towards Southeast Asia So from 1942 to 1943 port of the Philippines flew the Japanese flag due to foreign occupation The government in exile however continued to fly the Philippine national flag In 1943 the second Philippine Republic was inaugurated using that same flag After the war the US granted the Philippines their independence And throughout the rest of the 20th century the country altered the flag a little Mostly in the colors department eventually reverting back to the original colors of Aguinaldo's design previous to American administration So in 1998 the current flag was made official and permanent as the flag of the Republic of the Philippines As for the meaning of the flag According to the proclamation of independence the white triangle Signifies the emblem of the Katipunan the secret society that opposed Spanish rule of the punas Commemorate the flag of the United States as a manifestation of gratitude for American aid against the Spanish during the Philippine revolution The three stars represent the three main islands Luzon, Mindanao and Panay also Vizias and the Sun represents the gigantic steps made by the Suns of the country Along the path of progress and civilization That's cool While the eight rains represent the eight provinces which originally rebelled against Spanish rule But the Sun is also likely to be the remain of the Sun of May which was somewhat influenced by Spanish rule or by ancient native populations The origin of these symbols is also quite interesting although obviously up for the bay There is an official explanation on the Philippines government website which states it was like this Having some influence from southern America flags from the US flag Masonry and even some local port flags in the Philippines There's also a theory for which I could find no real confirmation that the flags design was originally inspired by that of the Cuban flag That's cool that they have like this huge breakdown of the flag on their government website. Yeah, yeah Recently an argument has been made by the province of Zambalus that they were all support of the original revolts And therefore the Sun on the flag should be modified to accommodate a ninth ray and the Kazon province has done the same Another defender for the addition of a ninth ray or the mortal people The Muslim natives of the islands which claim that it could be added in their representation So if all wishes are accommodated the flag could end up with not nine but eleven rays Other proposals ask for the addition of a fourth star to represent north borneo at territory claimed by the Philippines But currently under Malaysian rule and this addition would mean the changing of the triangle into a rectangle And some even say that a crescent moon should be added to the flag Perhaps to represent the Muslim population in the country So who knows maybe the Philippine flag could eventually look like one of these Like any other country there are also administration flags public office flags Military flags and regional flags each with their own significance and meaning and references to the country's history and culture So that is the flag of the Philippines to red and blue lines with a white triangle three golden stars and a golden sun with eight He did the whole thing. Thanks for watching the video if you notice and a mistake or have yeah, that's really cool so I don't because isn't the Muslim The religion isn't that the third biggest one there? Yeah, I think Christianity is is the main religion and then the most Populous religion and then there's one more that's bigger than I forgot which one it was is there another Yeah, there was like two before Muslim so I don't understand I As a country that kind of runs off of the same concept as the United States I don't think anything on the flag should be religious driven. Yeah, you know, I mean, I'm sure Something on our flag is religious driven But no, I mean if you ask anybody they don't know right because I couldn't I mean I can tell you with the stars Stanford's the individual states I can tell you with the bar Stanford stands for the first 16 colonies But as far as like the color representation, I'm not 100% sure right I think the red is supposed to represent like bravery and the white purity I can't remember what blue stands for but There could be some religion behind Some of the design or the coloration That's not something that I know about yeah, I will say the Muslim inspired flag that was the third flag down that had the crescent instead of the triangle right looked really cool Right, but I think that would be pretty hard to execute seeing as though the the end of the flag is a circle That would that would look kind of odd flying but That that was a lot of information. There was quite a few flags that have made their way through the country um And there's still a few flags being represented now like the president's flag the navy flag things like that right yeah So I thought it was really cool If y'all have another video that you want us to watch regarding the flag or anything about You know Things like this like that represent the country not necessarily has to be the flag Mm-hmm like we looked at the eagle right we looked at the flag now if there's anything else that represents the country that you feel needs to be Seen by us at least or anybody else that watches our videos let us know down in the comments or you can check it out in our description I'd actually be interested in doing a video similar to what we did with Malaysia on Philippine's wildlife Yeah, if you guys have a wildlife video like Like animals specific to the Philippines that we can check out throw that in the comments or throw it in our discord Yes, please do so and if y'all want to see our future videos Please hit the subscribe button and hit the bell notification so you'll know when the next video drops And if you want to sport us directly hit the join button and join our members program and with that being said my name is miles And my name is fed thanks for watching guys peace out
