the comments I don't go on Instagram and Eleise
doesn't go on YouTube do what we're gonna
do she's gonna pick out a couple of comments
that she had on Instagram for me to read out
I'm gonna pick out a few for her to read out now so we're
gonna do that now also just mentioned wait

Canal mall and they're just doing the opening
of the Christmas lights and the Christmas
tree so there's a concert there's an event
going on that we've been invited to so stick
around for that and you'll be able to see
that we've just heard them practice and they
sound unbelievable
Straight into these comments Hey Lawrence
Every single country we go to they try to adopt
me as one of their own whether it's the Philippines
whether it's India whether it's Thailand they
all think I'm from their country now I agree
I'm racially ambiguous I could be from anywhere
I could be from Morocco from the Philippines
I could be from South America I could be from
the West Indies the list goes on so for once
and for all I'll be doing a DNA test to see
exactly where I'm from and to do this I'm
going to go to the professionals one of the
leading Global DNA testing services now this
is my Heritage they're going to be sponsoring
this video so thank you very much but at least
we can draw a line under this and see exactly
where I'm from now as you all know if you've
seen our videos my dad is from Sierra Leone
my mum is from England so I should be 50 Sierra
Leone 50 English I received the testing kit
about two weeks ago really nicely packaged
opened it up so simple to use took about two
minutes just to cheek swab you put it in a
little container and then you ship it back
to them and then you wait for your results
now I'm told this will give me a percentage
breakdown of exactly where I'm from  the results are finally
and I just received an email from them why
am I so nervous right here we go Lawrence
ready to explore your ethnicity this is really
cool uh let's go whoa 29.2 Irish Scottish
and Welsh 24.4 Nigerian 14.9 West
African ah here we go 11.5 Sierra leonean
is that all? 20% six more ethnicities hold on
hold on hold on where's English but 20% six
or more ethnicities this has blown my mind all
my life I thought I was English okay so it
gives you a full breakdown here when you click
on ethnicities right here we go Irish Welsh
Scottish 29.2 Scandinavian 7.1 percent
Greek and South Italian five percent Baltic
1.5% everywhere we went in India they thought

Zane and I hope you're all right actually

off oh no no no no no no
that was a bit harsh that was a bit hard and
if you go back and watch our videos I don't
think we portrayed India I mean we loved India
and I think India up to this day is our best
Trip Away on all fronts we think Indian people
are the friendliest people we've met on our
travels we had nothing but amazing times they
treated us with the utmost respect I think
we treated them with the utmost respect so
I don't know what oh no no no no no it's talking
about to be quite honest but thank you for
your comments and your opinion and we did
go home and we're now in the Philippines ananya
3609 you might have went to a roadside place
to save money you beggar
oh Savage so these are from Instagram we were
trying to save money though I'll be honest
I assure you 99.9 of the percent of the comments have been
amazing so much support so much motivation
so much inspiration also everyone who uh comments
in the comment section teaches us things about
the place that we're visiting that we didn't
know so Janta Mantra the Taj like loads of
stories were put in the comment section that
we had no idea about that just made the memory
of it so much better so thank you very much
for commenting even the negative ones on a
lighter note we're gonna go and watch this
Christmas show and the lights be put on so
stick around and hopefully no one tells us
to go home thank you very much India we love
you even though some of you don't love us
so it's six o'clock we're back at the canal
look at how beautiful it looks lit up not
me the Christmas tree look at how beautiful lit up the
show's about to start there's going to be
snow there's going to be singing it's going
We've just come to this place this place is
not only our first chicken Abodo it's supposed
to be the best chicken Abodo in Manila
Hey baby it is so busy hopefully we can get a
table
Nyh Nyh can you say Abodo I've just been
corrected it's not Abodo it's Adobo
chicken Adobo dyslexics don't do well in the
Asian Community Mango shakes 
How'd you find it delicious I could have done with
more sugar though we just spent like
you 10 minutes try to ask for no sugar anyway
she was like extra sugar and we were like
no no sugar after all this he came to the
table and Lawrence said extra sugar yeah and
the man was like
so if you come to the Philippines or pretty
much every Asian country I think they like
being really really sweet and they put sugar
and syrup in stuff so I always ask for stuff
with no sugar and then it just tastes like
a fruit and it's really nice
thank you very much wow [Music] um
it's very soft
absolutely incredible what's the Abodo taste Adobo taste like?
like a weak Curry goat if you've had Curry go
it's like weak curry goat but a bit saltier 
very good wow you're gonna love it I feel
like this is pressure trying to get a chicken
exactly right that's exactly what it tastes like it's not
a strong flavor as I expected actually that's
really nice yeah okay so we're currently discussing
how to get to all the islands for the because
a lot of them are quite a  pain to get to you
have to go on a boat for quite a while so
we're gonna see what orders go to the places
and see where we can get flights basically because
the flights are much easier for us with Nyh that's the research being done
this place is supposed to be the bomb I don't
know how much I love the bubble tea so this
is the Taiwanese mobile team that you can
get here so I went for the passion fruit because
it's got coconut jelly and fibroids so tasters
toasters [Music]
I said no sugar so it's not too sweet but
it's really nice and like Tangy it's got natural
butter
right let's go and find some barbecue and
then we'll take you to the hotel so Philippines
what I've noticed is one they've got loads
of wraps so we've got per share absolutely
five two not very good on tailoring Foods

they're like no yeah and so and if you want
breakfast you're like can I add that but could
I have this on the side no yeah yeah yeah

you know what this is a shock after being
on the island so Terrier a lot of people
sorry I feel like I've got social anxiety
after being on the islands
I actually feel like there was this many people
in the whole island I like this oh this okay
[Music] thing is when you come to the market
there's um tourists yes
when you come to the market as tourists literally
you get charged like a lot more than it should
be for everything obviously but I've got no
idea how much good prices always steps up
and he does it for me I'm like oh No 5 000
pesos that sounds all right not realizing
actually how much it is
only 200 pesos
what's the biggest size you have um
can you say thank you to the man
what would you want to put on this one this
one
yeah
yeah
when we're in adult you'll be able to see
it it is so hot you know what the difference
is we worked out it's that on the islands
you get the breeze in here you don't get the
breeze so it's just very close and humid Lawrence

Philippines he's about two foot above everybody

thank you [Music]
thank you
[Music]
thank you
guys you've been asking for that [Music] oh
okay
[Music] literally they're our tourists no
the Mark is for the Filipinos unlike markets
in Thailand that are just predominantly for
the uh for the tourists this is definitely
not like yeah yeah we've got little pizzas
there was so much stuff here it is in their
head
I'm trying to get Lawrence to try some fun
stuff but he is not not in the mood today
he's feeling a bit queasy and he wants a good
old-fashioned carbonara don't you Lawrence
Croc stand it's like this place was just made
for it I feel like I can be adventurous with
stuff that's not me [Music] but Lawrence could
be adventurers who stabbed us meet but I them
not even anything that's got any sort of bristle
on it oh yeah phone repair oh this is what
we need
um how much do you charge for screen repair
let's go on it's 109th life it looks like
it should have died last year we need to get
it
[Music] the market has also continued all
the way through this shopping center
we were saying some of us they've got so much
like fake stuff here literally no one must
wear anything real everything else you can
get everything trainers props anything watches
so we need to be quiet and Solitude of our
fish home we're going back
you ready to go home now you want some candy
[Music]
[Applause] ladies [Music] I don't think somebody
wants us to visit today
let's just popped to the intramurals we are
on our way to Cebu airport but we had a couple
of hours to kill so we thought we'd come and
check this out and it's absolutely stunning
just so you know Lawrence is being extra annoying
today just so you know I'm feeling a bit under
the weather if I get no sympathy no I'm just
an annoying hobby I'm sure you'll figure that
out no you're not you'll love me really you're
really annoying sometimes okay so where are
we where are we okay give me the damn camera
we're gonna have an argument today hopefully
I'll get it off camera I'd be like that man
oh yeah the guys who ride the uh horses and
the in horse and carriage they got in a fight
and they were whipping each other with their
with their whole swims [Music]
what is this so that was entertaining anyway
we're at Fort Santiago so this is intramuros
which was built 400 years ago by the Spaniards
thank you my history knowledge is as about
as far as that wow look at this so all this
damage was from World War II so they've left
the ruins as is this place is absolutely stunning
now is in a bad mood me and I have got a bad
chest it's not c19 oh we have got a bad chest
and we're flying to Cebu today uh at 7 30.
so that'll probably be our next video but
before then we're gonna have a look around
here we're gonna have a look around this area
apparently it's very Charming let's be fair
it actually looks really cool really cool
lovely Gardens do you have anything uh worthwhile
to add oh look at this kind of there's a cannon
that's what I'll add
more tick tockers please if you've watched
this comment and tell Lawrence that he needs
to learn some Tick Tock dances it didn't really
make my life so this is the ruins of the American
Barracks that we're here it's pretty easy
to forget when you're in Manila about all
the history that's here because like there's
so much of it is like malls and modern stuff
and places to eat and it's easy to forget
that actually there is so much history in
the Philippines Mr Lawrence will be happy
about because we all know he is history geek
number one it's going in so Jose Rizal who
you'll see uh maybe you've visited the risel
park when you've been here he was actually
in prison here before he was executed and
there are honor rolls here of people that
died during World War II when they were imprisoned
here so the fort was actually known for many
things obviously the history of the place
runs deep it was used heavily in the second
world war it was used as a dungeon and a prison
camp and many people died it was actually
captured by the Japanese Imperial Army that
used it as a prison they actually called it
the Manila Massacre many many prisoners were
killed off here it's got a weird um energy
about it it's very cool and very calming and
it is quite Eerie as well I'm not sure if
this is appropriate for camera or not but
hello
um so you know perfect on girls normally they're
over 12.
noted over 60.
you know you're telling me about the black
person nod yeah Lawrence was telling me do
you know what the black knot is and they just
go just a little acknowledgment a white person
just passed me and this is what we did to
each other I can't even do the straight face
yeah
it's really creepy smell like that's what
we do it's the it's the white group smell
a lot less cold yeah just thought I'd let
you know
no um dungeons
you'd be sociable you're gonna run down be
careful
[Music]
[Music]
high fives high five
that's the challenge [Music]
Golf Course I did want to play golf yeah you
look really in a place of Labor Family First
and all that
[Music]
around me
I want to get one of those so bad
we've got our flight at 7 30.
it's now three o'clock so we need to make
a move because we left our uh our bags or
suitcases at the hotel so we're gonna pick
them up go straight to the airport and then
we're on our way to Cebu City I'm absolutely
pausing for it I don't think we're gonna get
a grab from here low cost and we are about
to be like we're about to be late for our
flight do you want to go in there look grab
a snack get a snack then okay [Music] oh this
looks nice
if you can see how hot it is it's got nine
eyes picked out whatever it is no this is
just walked up I've just lost him for about
10 minutes
do that so daddy where are you I mean we are
like anything we needed a taxi but still we're
about to get uh to Robinsons to then get a
taxi
because um they're going to be late for the
year potentially going to miss the fly because
she wanted to buy crisps is that a joke
we've just been looking for you guys going
daddy where are you
best hooked up driver yeah
we could just go to this place up there and
left [Music] we will like [Music] with the
first taxi yeah so now we've got to get to
the hotel pick up the bags and get another
taxi let's get to the airport how far is the
airport already
you're joking
try anything yeah
[Music] I don't think somebody wants us to
visit today [Music]
way to the airport
toss it I actually can't deal with this I
cannot
I've learned a couple of words if you could
just let me know if they're accurate
Filipino films no fun okay
I just purchased always time from here I'm
absolutely myself because we're getting on
a very small plane over Ireland only flying
at about 2 000 feet so
what does that mean
s the Kappa that's a greeting what's your
next Filipino the next one would be um
anime
welcome
I'm gonna be Swimming by the time
so we've just started vlogging on a GoPro
which is why we might sometimes not be in
the frame well they're a bit oblong but basically
I feel like he's really it's not flattered
at the moment and it makes your nose like
this like very large anyway I don't know if
you've heard of this man the train guy but
this is what I think we look like hello
play golf and he's literally hacking up a
laugh he can't use one knee of his neck house
I don't know why you're being a Tiger Woods
anyway we're very relaxed the two people who
are about to miss our plane we made it they're
just queuing up outside the airport look who
made the goddamn fly oh yeah [ __ ] myself
oh yeah that's true like half of these we're
going to speak to you about tips and tricks
when you get into Summer Leaves they cancel
quite a few flights so we'll talk to you about
them over uh tequila
foreign
[Music]
[Music] foreign Kenny Rogers Roasters obviously
we've got some tips tip number one check your
baggage allowances online yes if they don't
come with bags no you just have your carry-on
if you do it online it's I think it looks
like 5 10 12 pounds for an extra carry-on
we've got 32 kilos but if you come here and
you do it at the airport it's 60 pounds which
is I mean ridiculous so make sure you do it
online yeah also if you do it on the Cebu
website they do automatically put like an
insurance thing on yeah so unche that if you
don't do this probably only a couple of quiz
but send me a few pennies so we're gonna two
tip number two leave in plenty of time because
when you get to the airport there's quite
a lot of queues outside of the airport and
obviously depends on if it's going to be a
busy flight you've walked you to get in the
airport to get them security and then you've
got yeah there's another airport there's an
extra security at the door of the airport
yeah and it can take quite a long time tip
number three leave extra time if you are coming
from Manila especially from the other side
of Miller Manila the traffic is why today
was crazy if it's in Russia or things like
it could be a nightmare like literally not
moving so I'm aim to give yourself four hours
and if you're an hour late you're still going
to make it fine number four yes did I was
doing some research and I looked at AirAsia
and half the fights were either late or canceled
so I don't know what's going over there but
if you've got Hotel Books going forward it
can really cause problems so Cebu Pacific
were there's probably like 20 15 to 20 were
late or canceled and that was the best I saw
on there so that's why I got with it just
it's about it's about 10 pounds more a flight
for us [Music] um apparently a lot yeah apparently
a lot of the planes were [Music]
so time of flight matters and because there's
a lot of cancellations and delays and stuff
the lights that are less likely to be delayed
are they're all canceled should I say I'll
answer a little bit later in the evening so
we've gone for a half past seven flights
everybody 's as far we've got this crab lies
black if you're a traveling family then the
toddler is still Max Priceless an hour and
15 minutes for check-in and we've got no gate
to go to
because now the anxiety moves from me having
many beers and feeling lovely about life and
situations she gets anxiety because of the
less than four hours before checking sorry
Lawrence likes to be the last person to stroll
on the plane everybody's waiting for you know
those people that people clap for that would
be him if I wasn't it
but I'd have a smile on my face if she weren't
here does anyone want a husband it's free
take him he's not free it's a lot of work
[Music] I'm an investment I've made Lawrence
go and check the board again we've got a gate
funny story we got out to go to a gate and
you have to go back through security so now
we're like really thinking we're gonna miss
them like a lot of us really need to win I
told him he can't go because we've got to
go straight to the caves we made it we're
on the queue as long as it's going for a Wii
I might just get on the plate tonight
[Music] we sat in the wrong road we're swapping
what's happening we basically sat in 18 rather
than eight so we had to swap through the whole
Road
thank you sorry [Music] my bad so we're gonna
land we're gonna stay in Cebu City because
it's very close um for like nighttime flights
we'll just stay there have a look around there
and then we're going to go down to mobile
is that delicious then we're going to go down
to mobile
[Music]
Holy Night
we're ready
[Music] [Applause] you're literally having
a time of your life with this bad guy
so the seventh tip is our driver said if you
arrive at about 7pm which is like Rush Hour
sort of time a bit later than rush hour he
said it takes three hours to do a 40 minute
Journey from the airport to Cebu City so pick
your times wisely so either late in the evening
past nine o'clock or early in the morning
food we're gonna go to bed and we'll see you
tomorrow in Cebu City
