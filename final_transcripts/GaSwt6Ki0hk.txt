It's quite safe because we live around the university and students mostly students live around the university, so it's quite safe. How about you? Yeah, I'd say my twight safe. It's quite safe. So, our students have been studying here. Have you ever experienced any events? I personally didn't face any threatening situations, but then we have been want to not roam around during the nights outside. So, mostly we take care of our safety first. So, mostly we take precautions. But, are there any Indian students? Maybe in France or in Buradal, how many people can come to us? They don't live nights. Late nights, maybe, the deaths which happen everywhere. But, late nights, it's common, so it's our responsibility to be cautious. Yeah. So, the latest time you stayed outside nights? Uh, around 9. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9. We can go out by 5. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we have. I have gone. And, I see Dagupan is more lively at early mornings because it's a market and everybody are, you know, the livelihood of people. I think mornings are very beautiful in Dagupan. So, you presently come to India? Yeah, it's very pretty because the sun is rising and it looks very pretty. So, I prefer going out early in the morning. All of us are in this village. Yeah. Give me a break. I would give it 7. Yeah, 7. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Can you guys briefly introduce yourself? How long you've been here? Your country? So, I'm from India. We are from here from since last January. It's been around 11 months. We are here and it is going well. How about you? My name is Chiral and I'm currently pursuing BS bio. We are here since January 2023. I came to Philippines at Feb. It's been quite long. And it's good. So, how saved do you feel Philippine is for foreign students? It's saved but not all the time. Are some of our friends facing difficulties here? How about you? How save is the Philippines for you? I feel like in the daylight time it's safe. But at the night you should not travel alone here. You should travel with your friends because we heard the incident of our seniors being harassed. Someone was shot also. Yeah, same here. So, you just mentioned that an Indian student was shot. Can you share the experience? For us that we were not here at the time when the incident occurred. We actually heard from our seniors. So, what our senior told. So, we'll tell that. Our senior told that he and his friend what traveling together in a what street we don't know. So, some guy came from there. I see they tried to snatch from the girl. The boy tried to defend the girl. From the people who were trying to snatch the things from him. So, the guy, Filipino guy I guess, he shot him. He shot him. Yeah. Did he die? I'm not sure about that. I'm not sure about that. I'm not sure about that. It wasn't very injured. Yes. And also you should not travel alone at the night time because we heard the snatching of phone also in our room. Two three phones. Two three phones. On a point of gun they still have phone. They're dorm in the school outside. No, outside. You know, we live in the carina. Oh wow. You know, definitely as human we have different experience. Not everybody that we have like good experience or the time but this is like a lesson to foreign students that you should not go out at night. Especially at night or late night. Or you should not travel alone also. You should travel with your friends. We can travel in a group. Yeah, in a group you can travel anytime. Oh, it's safe. Well, have you had any personal encounter with things like that? No, I have not. So, we're from a senior experience. I will try to avoid traveling at night. Okay.
