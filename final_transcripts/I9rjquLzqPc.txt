 The Philippines homeless some of the most beautiful islands in the world and some of the most amazing food and culture you'll ever experience. It's also home to the most friendly, humble, Filipino people that live day by day with smile on their faces regardless of the challenges they may face. As a Filipino American, they grew up in the USA. I wanted to humble myself and experience what life is like living like a Filipino in poverty. The goal is one month living in the Philippines province on a 200-pacel with day budget, which is $4 USD. I must live like a Filipino in experience every day just like my ancestors who still live and still live into this day. So join me on this new journey of becoming a true Filipino. Pyramid. What is up guys? Welcome back to day 21 of a foreigner camping in the Philippines. So guys, as you guys can see in the background, it's not the best day out. It was raining earlier. It just looks like a gloomy, depressing day. So now for our plan today, what do you want to do? Because it's not really the best options. I think we're just going to try some Filipino snacks today guys. You want to try some chips? I'm candy? Something like that. So basically, we just want to try a variety of Filipino snacks. We're going to take you guys to the sorry, sorry store, see the options, see how much the prices are. And basically, we're just going to have a relaxing day in the 10 eating snacks. So we're going to rate them one through 10 and we're going to get a variety. What's your favorite Filipino snack? I would say Mardi's. Mardi's? I don't know what that is, but it sounds like candy. It sounds like a candy, is that candy? No, that's a chips. Mardi's? Oh, smarties. I'm getting it confused with smarties. Smarties and croquelies. Do you know what smarties are from the US? Yeah, it's like M&M. Kinda, it's not really M&M, it's like a sugar. It's like a sugar 10. I thought she meant smarties. Mardi's you're saying. Mardi's is a chip.

What can you do chucky now, Dad? It's a big one. It's a big one. Let's get it. It's a big one. The famous chucky. So guys, everything is all organized. Everything is all good. And here are the snacks. And I'm so excited to try because, guys, this looks amazing. Before we get started, guys, let's do a quick prayer. I just want you guys to know. Our channel is not going to be about inhaling all these foods. Like, we don't want to spread gluttony. That's a sin. You don't want to stay away from gluttony. We just want to try it. And then the rest, we're either going to give to family or, you know, maybe pets or something. So, guys, let's do a quick prayer. And then let's try this food. So thank you Lord for this day. Thank you Lord for everything you've done. Thank you for all the blessings we receive. And thank you guys for... Thank you, Lord, for allowing us to have a platform to spread your name. And, Lord, we thank you for this opportunity on YouTube. And, Lord, we hope you bless the person watching this. And we hope that he can find you as well, just like you found us and showed us your love. So thank you, Lord. We love you, Lord. And the name of Jesus, we pray. Amen. But I haven't had this in probably how many years. I don't know. 15 years. Sorry, so we have a time. I want to make this. Oh, yeah, we have a tang. We have an ice in here. So, guys, I'm so excited. This chucky I've been waiting for for so long. I used to drink this as a kid, but I don't know if it tastes different. I think it's a tried that now because it's not golden anymore. Yeah, we might start with the chucky. So, let's make this tang, no? So, you just open it like this. We'll flavor it. Orange. Orange. Orange, is it just orange or like orange cucumber or something? No, it's just orange. Okay. So, just regular orange tang. Oh, that's a lot. No, don't put a lot. You don't need the overdose on sugar. Because, guys, if you guys keep eating snacks like this, you're going to get a chocolate neck. You don't want a chocolate neck. You already have a chocolate neck. This is called diabetes, guys. You don't want an overdose on this stuff. It's also salty, though. So, you don't want this. Shake it up, nah? So, it looks amazing. Guys, I have an eight today, so this is really, we have food though. I do have some food. It's just some tuna eggs and rice, so. Is this good or isn't? Yeah, that's good. So, I'm just going to try this now. I'm not going to indulge in it because, you know, we don't want to practice gluttony. It tastes good. It's cold now. It still needs more powder than sugar. Should I put our four? Only sugar. It's already sweet, but it's just sweet. I'll be the judge. I don't like too sweet. It's too good already. Oh my gosh. No one has really good. You don't need so much sugar. It's already sweet. It's already salty. It's already salty. It's already salty. It's already salty. So, let's try the chucky. Yeah, you try it. You pick a snack and you let me know. You rank them. I'll shake it first. So, it comes with a straw on the back. And then just put the whole here. There. Chucky, did you use to drink this like every day back in the, there was a kid? Chucky's so good. Yeah. You've got a small distance. So, it's just small. That's small, but it's expensive. It's like, um, even pesto. Oh my gosh. No. It's good. If you guys never tried Nestle Chucky, this is the best chocolate milk you'll ever have. And I'm not just saying that. It is number one. It's got this distinct taste. It's so good. I don't want to keep drinking that because just trying everything. So, now pick your favorite snack out of here or not your favorite. But just give me a good snack. So, go with the piafos. So, the martis of course. It's cleaners. Let's start with the piafos first. So, this is a potato chibrate. Yeah, potato chibrate. So, in the USA we have lays, we have Doritos, we have Cheetos. Explain, is this like the number one chibrate or like? Not really. What type of chip would that be? It's like lace. Let's show them. So, that's the Filipino lace? Yeah, but it's like super small. It's like this. Whoa. It's like very small. Whoa. It doesn't really taste potato-y. It's like, I think they bake these, not? I don't know. I don't know how they make this. I don't think they bake this. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't think they fry it. I think it's like baked. Because you guys can see it's not really deep fried. It's more like baked. Is it baked? I'm not sure how they make this. It's still good. Let's rate that now. I'm going to scale it to 1, 2, 10. This is cheese flavored by the way. It's permits on 8. 8? Wow. I mean. It's really good though. It's very good. I always did this before. I'm going to eat chibras. Chibras. I like bread and chips. But back then when I was younger, I was really cheap. All the time. I have American taste buds so I can't go too high. Because my favorite chips are the layers, the high quality brand. It's already started with a potato. Let's try this. A wishy potato. It's sour cream. Garlic? No, sour. It's sour cream, garlic, and flavor. It just adds to garlic. I don't know. I just saw it. You see? It's not like sour. It's not like vinegar. Vinegar. Yeah, it's not sour. So this is how it looks like. It's very good. It's really good. It looks like piatas, but it's not. Again, guys, I think they're baking these. They're not frying them. It's all good. It tastes like sour cream. That one's better. This one? Yeah, that one's better than that one. I give that a nine. That's good. For me, 8.5. Let me try one more. It's like a garlic though. It's not sour cream. It's kind of sour a little bit. That one's really good. Nine. That's really happy. That's just add... I want to try this one. This one? What is the same brand, huh? Oh, we she... Yeah, we she is like a popular brand in the Philippines, but it's from... Japan? Because the we she is Japanese. So it's what's take the price. We'll see how it looks like. It's still good, aren't we? Neither. Later. Is there any later? I don't know. Maybe not. So... See how it looks like. It looks like fries, but it's not. It doesn't smell like no. What flavor is this? Butter? This has... Bake, not fried. I told you they're baking everything. They're not fried. Oh yeah. Even the potato chips are in bake. Or they're all baked. Whoa. That one's good. That one's really good. You cannot compare it to a fries, but it has that good taste. That one's the best one we tried so far. Like, we've been eating it all day. We're eating it all day. What? So yeah, guys. I'm going to try this one. I'm going to try this one. I'm going to try this one. What? So yeah, guys. This one, the potato fries. This is the best one we had. Not 100%. Well, how would you rate this? This one, I've rated the other one at nine. But I got to rate this one at 9.5. 9.5? Yeah. It's really high. That's very high. But that one's... I got to stop rating them so high, not. Yeah. I don't know why. I always rate them low. Yeah. For me, this is an eight. I would help. Did you rate this? I don't know why. It's an eight for me. I'll rate your cooking at 10. No one? That's just simple dish. It's just tuna and tomato. Let's try this one. Richie. Crunchy snack milk flavor. See that? Is it in the packaging? Yeah. Kind of looks bland, but it's got a color. So you open it up. No, give me a tank, please. It's so spicy. Oh yeah, but a spicy flavor. Oh my gosh. We didn't rate the tank, huh? I'll hold your eight. 8.5. This one smells like milky. Milky? Yeah. I don't know why. I don't know why. I don't know why. I don't know why. Milk flavor. I don't know. I feel like... I'm smelling like a glue or something. Glue? Oh, that does smell like glue. No, bro. No. It smells bad. It doesn't even taste like, it tastes like sugary. It's like, this is a sugar. I'll give that a 1. I would never eat that. I'll never eat that again. I don't know. It's got a weird smell. I'll say it's not that bad. It's just, I don't want that. I'll give this a bite. I'll let you eat it. Sure. No, let's get into a dessert. I've been eyeing this one though. Topso. Chocolate. It's thops. It's like a cupcake with a... I got high expectations for this. Why? Because it's like the packaging makes it look so good. So good. Tada. So that's what it looks like. What do you see? Look at that. This is star. Oh, it's true. Mmm, smells so good now. I got high expectations. Hopefully... It smells like chocolate. Yeah. It's so good. Because the packaging looks so good. I guess it's got the filling inside. You want to try it first? You take the first bite now. Let me see. Does it got the cream like it says? Yeah. What? It's fairly... Maybe you didn't take a big enough bite. Let's try. It just does your show because... Where the cream at, bro? It's not bad though. It's already mixing. I guess. How do you eat this? That's actually good. Yeah. It's not dry. I thought it was going to be dry. You want to go and ask your bite? No. It's too sweet for me. I like it. It's got like marshmallow flavor. It's kind of crunchy because of the candy. It's got a crunch. That one? I'll give it a eight. For me it's a seven. Seven? Okay. What else? What else we got now? What else? I'm sorry, eating sweets. Let's face this jelly. So we have... So these are sweet as sweet? Yeah, but they're not too sweet. So we have the pineapple flavor, strawberry flavor, and the grape flavor. Back in the USA, we had these. I like from the Asian store. You buy these in the Asian store in the US? I started the grapes. You try the grape? I'll try the lemon. No, we'll share. Just try to have. What was like a juice? Yeah, there's a juice. You have to... Oh my gosh, I'm wet. Don't drink it at all. Oh, sorry. Mmm. This one's pineapple. Yeah, it's old, dude. It's a pineapple. It's in a sped. Mmm. Alright. Mmm. I don't like pineapple. I like the grape better. It's got a real super grape taste. What's that one? Watermelon? Strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. It tastes like medicine. For? Oh no. The cough medicine? Not cough medicine. It's like the sweet. Not cough medicine. It's like the syrup medicine. Nah. The best is the grape. Yeah, the best is the grape. I'll finish this. What? Jelly shot. Jelly shot. I'll rate those. This too is horrible. I probably wouldn't eat that again, like ever in my life. Because there's no point. What's the point I eat in jelly? It helps you with your digestion. You're a doctor. I don't know. When I was younger, I used to have like bad stomach and my mom would always say eat jelly and then it's going to make your bubble softer. Mmm. It helps with the meat. Alright, then the far of four or five? Four or five. I rate this as a six. Six. I know. For the grape jelly. Alright. It's not really what I'm trying to eat. Let's save the fruit and less because it's spicy. Yeah, but this one's fried. You can tell it's like a fried. Not baked. Yeah, later. Alright, come on. What else we got? Let's see here. We got Moby. Moby, let me see. Nutri snacks. Moby. Caramel pops. What is this? No holes, no hard kernels. Melted in your mouth. Alright, you got high-scatation. If you don't melt in the mouth, there's going to be a big problem. This is how it looks like inside. Like this. What is it, popcorn? Popcorn? Does it melt in your mouth? It does. It's like soft. It gets soft. Ah, does it really melt in your mouth? Yeah, it does. Although when you put a lot of saliva in it's going to melt in your mouth. Yeah, but you have to chew it. I thought you just pop it in and it melts. Ah, it's good though, tastes good. It's like generic popcorn though. It's like full of air. Ah, actually, to be honest, they're tasting better now. It's good. The more you eat it, the better it tastes. I'll give it the eight. Solid eight. I'll give it the eight. Solid eight, solid eight. Come on, huh? Now take a bite out of this. I don't want. Why is this guy's good? It's going to ruin all the experience of me eating this. Why? This is that so fishy. It's talking about you. I don't even know if you're rating this right because you're eating fish and then you're eating this chips. Like, I don't understand why. It's because I haven't eaten. Yeah, it doesn't make sense. Right. Let's try the chip. I eat this one. It's cream. Oh, it's the generic of Oreo. You can't be Oreo. Oreo is always going to hit. This hits, dude. What do you mean? All right. So, what is it? There's like a house in the biscuit. I'm going to really judge this hard now because if you're going to try to copy Oreo, you better be good. We don't have milk. Oh, do we have chocolate milk? No, ma. Take a shot. All right. I'm going to really rate this in my whole no. Got the cream inside. Mm. It's definitely, it doesn't taste like Oreo. It's got its own flavor. I know. But do you know the ice cream to cook the cream? This is what they put in there. Wow, solid. I'll just go for Oreo, though. It's really not. Oreo is kind of too sweet for me. It's solid. I'll give it to 7.5. I'll give this 8.5. Yeah. Don't rely on history things. I make good ratings. Let's try the bingo now. You're going for seconds. So this is the same, but it's not the same brand, right? Mm-hmm. It's like a whole different brand. This brand is jock and chill. What is this bingo? I don't know. I think it's just bingo brand. So this one's orange, orange and chocolate. Not really a fan of orange and chocolate, but we'll see. They gave me a drink. Ooh. This smells just like the tang. It smells super orangey. It's got the orange filling. But they're kind of lacking on the filling. Should I try it? Should I try it first now? Sure. Whoa. That's one of my favorite biscuits. That's actually way better than I thought. That one? It's way better than cream. Yeah, that one's way better than cream. Because I always eat this. That's why I know it. Mm. That's actually up there with Oreos. Mm. It smells good. Let me smell the tang. Let me see the tang. This is smell like ban. What are you talking about? It's got the same orange flavor. Just a weirdo. It's smell the tang. The filling itself is good. That's got a really like perfect combination. I've got a good biscuit. I've got a good feeling inside. That bingo biscuit is way better than the other biscuit. Mm. The cream. Yeah, the cream. So I give this a rate as a nine. I agree. What is it? Stico. Stico. I think it's like just a wafer with chocolate. You know, when I was a kid, me and my friends would always like... Pretend you're smoking here or something? Not really. But we're trying to eat the shallot only in the... So guys were... So yeah, guys, the camera actually died. So we had to charge it. But we're back with three more snacks. Yeah, the last ones. So now, which one do you want to go with? I think the last one. We were doing the stico, but the camera died. The cuts. Yeah, I don't know if they got the full review. So let's try it. It's like a... Wait for it to happen. It's solid. I'm not mad at that. I like the other different flavors. They have different types of flavors. I like that one a lot actually. My favorite one is the Tote fruity that is a crazy flavor. Tote fruity tastes like fruit candies. That was my favorite one. I like that. I would definitely eat that. Probably with ice cream, never be the best. Yeah, ice cream or shake. Yeah, I'll give that a eight. For me, it's a side. Let's get into these vinegar. Let's save that for the... Never mind. I don't like that one. That's my favorite. This one? Yeah. This one is my favorite. Mardy. What is Mardy's now? It's kind of soft. Can I smell it? Is this chicharon? Yeah, it's chicharon. Ooh, this one. Good. It's not like french fries. Mmm. I... Let's taste it or what? Let's taste it or what? Yeah, it's a We Should Bride. Mmm. I know that's going to be good. Every We Should Bride is good. That's soft, so good. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. That's so good. This one is my favorite. This needs vinegar. Yeah, you can dip this in a vinegar. This one. Mmm. Bro, this is the best that we had, no? But this one is a... It's plain salted and it's called vegetarian chicharon. Old fashioned style. Gilt free. My gilt free. I don't know. We vegetarian. Yes, it's vegetarian chicharon. So, is that me and no pork? Maybe it's me, veggies. What do you think? Perfect to the crisp. Mmm. They have different types of flavor of this. They have the vinegar flavor, the spicy flavor of... What's your favorite flavor? This one is plain salted. May we favorite ones to be here? Vinegar. Who is this plain salted? Mmm. I think plain salted is like perfect. We're going back. We about to eat the whole bag now. Let's get into these. The best for last? We got potato chips, spicy barbecue flavor. I knew it. I hate barbecue flavor. Wow. I just don't like the flavor. I like this, um, the cheese, but the barbecue. Let me smell. This one's... You're gonna give me an off. Taste. This is Jack and Jill, no? Jack and Jill. So Jack and Jill is like... Oh, she. Yeah, it's like a brine too. But is Jack and Jill Filipino? Or is it Japanese? Oh no. I think the Jack and Jill is American. This one smells good. Let's try it now. Oh, these are the deep fried ones. Mmm. Mmm. I got it really tomato-y taste. Yeah. These are good, not that spicy. Oh, now she's changing her mind. How does it gonna be a bit spicy?
