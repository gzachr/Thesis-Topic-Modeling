 Okay, hello everybody and welcome to the content. Junkies, this is VD. This is Scott. Okay, I was looking for a certain one I reacted to and I couldn't find it. But I found this one and it has crazy talented Filipino kids. She's gone battle and the kid I was looking for is in this. Oh. So I believe it's the same song, so we're going to see that. But it's the four minutes. It's a 14 minutes long. 14 minutes. Yeah, so this is going to be a long one guys. So we're going to jump. Watch it. Yeah, we're jumping straight in. Okay, we're pausing time to time, but I hope you enjoy it. This is going to be a big epic one. Are you ready? Okay, here we go. It's like one and a half, two. Okay, round one. That's just like a sneaky pig. Nice.有了? He's got a vibrato. What? I'm going to copy that. Oh, this is so cool. I'm going to copy that now. Oh, there it is. Oh, there it is. Oh, there it is. Oh, there it is. Let's play! I'm going to copy that now. I'm going to copy that now. I mean, how old do you think he is? Two? He can't be no more than two. I teach two-year-olds. But can't talk. Amazing. Yeah, I've got like, well, I've got one and a half year old now, Ian. And his life is just running around destroying things. That's what he does. What? How does a kid's life age? And every tone is correct. Yeah. And every song is of... Like, Amy's getting it. This is the fourth talent. It's crazy. Okay, it's the first. Number two is the one that I did before. It has 100 odd fays in on my channel. So here you go. It's good that the dog bark in this one. Here you go. I can't walk. I can't walk. I can't walk. I can't walk. I can't walk. I can't walk.

WHAT 이!! what other~~ it's crazy then I'm always amazed at the power of the game, how can you generate that power of age? I mean I was really powerful when I was young but when I say young I was 11 when I was singing when my power really came out. These kids, I mean that baby, he's a baby, it's a baby. Oh god, I wonder if our baby would be a dissapear like that. Oh, hopefully, because I can't know anything. You can dance though. That wasn't a cue to dance, I love that. So I say you can dance, you start dancing. There we go. What does baby, what does it mean? What does it mean? What does it mean? It's nice for Brian over there. Rhyme 2 vs. 2 and chorus. Let's hear the baby again. Put the love only on youawning it's... I think he's the better one. I feel like the only thing that he's maybe, the doesn't sound right, is like he can pronounce the words just as much because he's very very young. But the notes that he's hitting there are better than the other two and they're still amazing but he's a baby. That's crazy. I don't think I've ever seen anything like this. No. Again, this is random. We randomly come across this. I was not expected it. I think he's the better one. I think it's time to promote. We've got to promote. We've got to promote. Okay.
