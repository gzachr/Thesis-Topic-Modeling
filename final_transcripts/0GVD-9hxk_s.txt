Very good morning, people. Very good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. You had a good sleep? Yes. You only wanted a bit hot. Your room was hot, eh? Yes. You had a good air conditioning. And you don't need air conditioning, as long as you have a good fan, right? Some ventilation, but that room is a bit damp here. Only this one. And then hot sun. And I hear somebody shouting. They have a problem here. The bathrooms actually we cannot use. There is hardly any water. Some of you know. Right. So one bathroom we cannot use at all? Yes.

No. Well, how do you feel today when you woke up? You feel like you're in a Philippines or you're still in Indonesia? We are like, I was in a Philippines because in Indonesia, it's called the one you wake up and you're in the mountains. Yes. And then you really feel like you're in a Philippines because you can hear music already, even for the whole day in the morning. Really morning. Actually, we woke up swinging dancing. That was a dream. That I'm not going to run. We're already in the streets. Do you think I'm some guy? Yeah. But you can hear it now. Can you hear it? It's a bit... And yesterday it felt weird because we were early in the morning and then we got here. So that felt weird that we were... Actually, the travel really felt... Actually, it was quite long travel because it was two or three hours. It's in flight hours and months, but somehow it was just very exciting. Yeah, because it's two different flights. It's a different... It's also a midnight night. Yeah, two different Philippines. It's not like a connecting flight. It's like two flights. So it's like two different flights. And then we get all the other flights. Love it. We're going through immigration for just being up our lives. Yeah, by the time we get to sleep, we're in two or three hours. Of course, they are...

To me, it's just when your mom and right now, it's right? Maybe when your father was still alive. And because we always... Most of the time, we ate bread for breakfast. Yeah.
