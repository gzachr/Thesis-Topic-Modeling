 guys. Here in over two years. Last time I saw her was 2020, all of February. Got back home to Los Angeles, March 3rd, something like that. And then the world shut down two weeks later. So all of our plans canceled until now. This is crazy. Los Angeles to Tokyo, Tokyo to Manila. And then I've just been walking back and forth, just waiting. The crazy thing is talking to somebody on a screen every day. And now I get to see you're in three dimensions. Baby girl, where you at? And she was supposed to be the one waiting out here for me. I thought I was going to take forever when I landed going through one hell pass, going through costumes, going through immigration. But I got out in two minutes. That never happens. I'm so nervous. Goodness. Goodness. I waited over two years. You think I could wait two minutes? I can not wait. Here she comes. I want you all the way to Los Angeles. And it does cost forever. And I'm here. And I'm here. I want you all the way to Los Angeles. And I'm here. And I'm here. And I'm here. Oh. Oh, look at the lights. Oh. Hey, look at you. Missing my baby girl. There's my baby girl. No. Wow. My goodness. Hey. Oh. I love you. Oh, you miss me? How long has it been, huh? Two years and forever. Two years and forever. My baby girl. My goodness. My goodness. Oh, my gosh. You should go, you must. Oh, you should be talking, huh? I'm okay. I'm all right. I feel so safe. I feel so safe. I feel so safe now. I feel the safest I've been in over two years. I'm going to go. Charge. Charge. There's no charge. There is no charge. There's no joke, baby girl. This is real. This is real. This is real. We're here. Finally, my goodness. So you're simply mine. In the making. My goodness. COVID, go away. We're done with you. We're done with this commercial. Let's get back to the regular schedule program, huh? My goodness. I feel so safe. I feel so safe. I feel so safe. I feel so safe. I feel so safe. I feel so safe. I feel so safe. I feel so safe. I feel so safe. I feel so safe. I feel so safe. I feel so safe. I feel so safe. I feel so safe. I feel so safe.
