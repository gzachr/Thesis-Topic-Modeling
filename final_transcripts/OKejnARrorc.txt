 Vitya Friday. The freshest. The Filipino Rockstar came to absolutely murder a couple of days ago in the Indies restaurant. Keep sending us this video on Facebook. This video is so famous. I've seen the first couple of seconds and it seems like he's sort of getting people from the crowd. This is wild. A lot of others are pianists though. Yeah, he must be doing a gig or something. Right? It's live stream. It's really cool. It's pretty packed that place. Yeah, he's, you see Mother Truckers begin to walk in. Oh my God, look, there's actual people. It gives him mics. That is bad. And I don't think they perform as I don't think they're in the restaurant. Like 18. Only in the Philippines. This is why we love the Philippines. They don't even know each other. I show them right. I think he's on the white beat. Oh boy. They say my amor. He said poor. He said poor. My amor in Spanish. My love. My love. My love. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. Dude, they don't even know each other. What is this? Oh boy. You know, this is the recipe for the saster anywhere else. All right? Make the way up. Okay, okay, okay. It's the one up and up and up and up and up and up. Come on, come on, come on. Come on. Look at everybody's just chilling. Dude, I would be tight. So weird. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh, he's awesome. Dude, he's a geo. He is so good. He is so good. He is so good. He is too good. He is too good. He is too good. He reminds me of Brian Adams. He does. He is. He is. He is. He is. Oh, yes. He is. Bro, I want to go before he gets you. That would have been great. You must have done it. Ah, that's what friends are for. He goes viral with the song and he makes it re-viral again. Oh boy. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh, they are refused to believe that these guys are just random. Oh my god. I know how he is trolling mid phrases. Go back. Look at his. Oh, I'm feeling it. Bro, only you can bloody fill a pain. No, bro. No, bro. No, bro. She is like a random mom. She is like a random mom. That's what friends are for. She is like a ripped jeans. Well, they ripped, actually. The haste. That's what friends are for. Girls. That is so dope. Oh, okay, okay, okay, okay. He is delimuel, Jan, especially. Yeah, it is, it is a little easy. This is the song. This is the song. Well, I did say this. Okay, this is the song that literally goes viral because he is singing it with his friends. You remember the video that everybody sent us that everybody was losing their minds over? Yes, yes, yes, that video. But what in the Waka moly? Again, when you see it, when you see this kind of stuff being done with a friend group because it's like this is what they do. This is what they do when they're like drunk and having a good time. Whenever they get together, they sing. Back home musicians used to do that, normal people, but musicians used to do that, right? Where they would hang out and break into song and stuff and whatever. Normal, do you think, yeah, okay? I saw someone in the comments of that video where we reviewed it. They were saying, oh, no, this is obviously fake. It's obviously like a put on. Put together. And I'm like, you haven't seen enough videos of this bloody lamp. You don't have no idea, Doug. Well, what about this? Explain this to me. You're pretty tight. And when I'm not feeling like it's not me, I'm just like, whoa. You're so... You're so... You're so... You're so... You're so... You're so... You're so... You're so... You're so... You're so... You're so... Dude, I... I love this certain. I'm like, not only do I want to be there. I want to have mates like that. You know what I mean? I think people are strangers. They don't know each other. They just like, they literally just bond. They don't stay. Nah, they just became friends. Limuel, the friendship god. The best of all the aliens is so incredible. That's what best of all. He's got a girl. This guy is a beast. Right? This guy is dangerous. I refuse to believe he's not an artist. I love that he just strolls. He's an entrance who has a really freaking iconic. I just can't deal with that. I thought he was giving him his purse. Hey, have my money. You're my credit cards, you're a god. Adapt, overcome. Attitude. That is so crazy. That is wild. Two million. That's a rock. Well, Janice, you won in the gig in scene, bro. You are the king, bro. You're the best gig I've ever seen in my life. Correct. Like in bars, the best I've ever seen. There's nothing better. I have never seen anything better. Nah, bro. And that's ridiculous. Because again, there is a set bar. The bar is set high in the Philippines because people can sing. Because people know what to expect from this show. Like, they can do them. Like, they can achieve the shows in the comfort of their houses. The level of the shows. But to have somebody that is that confident and that, you know, flexible, vocally speaking, on stage, but also bring people out and let them do what they do best. It's like, whoa. I got to tell you, man, like, not to sound like a ticket, but like, we've done bar tours here in London, right? Or in Balesca, some very long ones. Yeah. And then we've done, like last year we did a decently long one together. And we did about a season, yeah. Yeah. And this would never happen. Believe me, that's it. It was never. They can't. No. They can't, like, British people when they go to pub, right? Any, any, any, drink, worldwide. Yeah, any race, anything. Wherever you're from, it doesn't matter. It's not as you're in a British, not English pub, right? Yeah. It's like, you leave your singing ability out of the window. It's like, it's like a requirement. Yeah. You cannot sing. Restaurant bars. We've done it all in that season. Like, no, no, this is never going to happen. I'm telling you, this doesn't happen. At this scene level, it doesn't happen. Obviously, Lamuel has played in big, big, big arenas. And he already has a name, right? Yeah, he's a big artist. But they, you know, they stand it at the performance. He's only required by the standard of the venue. You know, there's only like a hundred people watching. It's like, you don't have to put on a show that's worth 15,000 people. That's right. So, so the crowd, you wouldn't presume that they're going to have this sort of amazing singing ability. But in a common, the common denominator in the Philippines is that if you are going to choose, if you were to choose a random person in the streets, and these streets, you had like streets in London, New York, Colombia, you know, like Bogota, and then you have in Buenos Aires, in Argentina, and then you had the Philippines in Manila, and then you had Korea, and Busan, let's just say that. Out of all the randomness that you would put, if the sample size was big enough, the people who people would write higher, would always be out of the randomness industry of the Philippines. I would agree. No fuck, there's no f***ing way. No way. There's a whole show about this, Cole Stringing Superstar. Yeah, exactly. Anyways.
