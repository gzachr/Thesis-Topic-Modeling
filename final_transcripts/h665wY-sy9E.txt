 Yep. Okay, good morning. Another day, another dollar. But we start on a bad morning because we couldn't do my last drink this morning due to burnout. And there's not even internet on the phone which I could have maybe tried something because I think it's expanded to depologue itself. So everything is there. Sorry about that. Just have apologies. And next time, I hope. But anyway, we see if we can do some work here because with that power, I need to cut a bit of timber to work on the porch. But there's always something we could do maybe manually. Anyway, I just have breakfast. That's the Philippine province. Well, that's a healthy breakfast. And Bella seems to like it. Broccoli. Okay. I know she put it back. Broccoli is good, but maybe. Broccoli is very good. It's been eating. I know you prefer a nice cream, but not too special, but it's good for your health. Sorry. Okay. Okay. Okay. This one's done too. So we put the gate on this one here. This one seems to be a bit more study rigid. Okay. Looking good. Okay. Time for lunch. It's a... It's beautiful salad. It's beautiful salad improvised by J.M. Looks beautiful and healthy. That's it. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. A lot of good vegetables there for dinner. Early dinner, but I'm still not hungry. But Bella loves it. She loves vegetables. Am I loved? You love vegetables? Yeah. And my... look at this. Oh, beautiful. I'm back at. I can't for a beer, but I don't see I can't get up anymore. So tired. So that's it for today. Yeah. Bye bye for today. Bye bye. Yeah. Anything you have to grab. Say bye bye my love. Bye bye. Okay. Good morning. As of then, of the dollar. All the parts they're ready to be screwed in. Opposition. But we'll do that after we come back from a bit of a shopping. We to buy a cup of things. And then we'll attack that. So let's go. Yeah. Beautiful today. Sunny, but we need water. So yeah. We'll run eventually. Mind and I is not the kind of place where you'll be dried day after day, after day. Always ran sometimes. Okay, we're back home. She just got one fungus. It's not really a man's here. It's a fungus. So they treat her. We've got some medication and shampoo. The whole thing costs 4,000 places. They are. That's what I'm up and when you're on. It's. So anyway, man thinks that she'll get better. When they shave the fur, they found more stuff underneath. So it wasn't nice rather ugly. But anyway, she'll be okay now. Let's go home. It's so hot. She's in the back of the curse. Probably sleeping there. I've got to have lunch. So I'm getting hungry. Okay, back to the skate. So this is how it's going to sort of a shop. So I need to scroll that in on position. So let's do that. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Have a quick lunch and I'll start my volunteer work tomorrow morning. Are you okay? no colonis this, around 30 Jimmy. Australian. I won't bother you. Okay, I'll see it for tonight.
