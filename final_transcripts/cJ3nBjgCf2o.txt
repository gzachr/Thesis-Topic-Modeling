 Hey guys welcome back to our videos so today we're actually trying a famous Filipino fast food restaurant, Jollybee. Yeah we've seen it everywhere in Philippines and we just haven't tried it so literally while we're in the airport last year in Philippines we will try it. You guys so Filipino people have been raiding about it so it's always so so busy as well it's like the McDonald's yeah of England, that kind of like that. So yeah I hope you enjoy watching us give our reviews. What your favorite thing is you'll see we get a few different things off the menu but yeah not everything because some stuff is out stock but yeah we are in Jollybee and I've got a bunch of these those stuff off the menu so come with me it's our first time in here so I'm looking do you know how's been served what have we got? There's a couple of things not available on the Jollybee menu but why have we got three act of ice? I'm not quite sure I just said yeah whatever I don't think they understood oh they kind of small yeah yeah this is our first time in Jollybee in the Philippines um so a massive thing here so we thought we'd come and try it so we've got loads of foods. We're going to try the pasta that's one of the main things everybody says to try amazingly not all the food on the table so we've got the chicken burger we've got a yum yum burger we've got these mango apple no mango peat mango pie we've got the traditional Jollybee pasta a chicken I'm guessing that's rice and some chips and then we've got some coke as well of course it's a chip right let's get into it and we'll tell you what we think so this is the traditional yum burger made's gonna try I think it's yeah I think it is just a cheeseburger yeah was it taste like good? No kind of like McDonald's or not yeah but they like that what'd you rate at eight out of ten? Tell us your opinion T sorry this is not what you're gonna choose next I'm gonna go to this spaghetti apparently it's really sweet everything so it's like little bit so true or from let's try some of this and see what we think yeah people always spoken to you said that it's like really sweet yeah so let's say smells nice right off show yeah it literally nice it just feels like when you're young and you have like kids pasta you know the little sauce gets like yeah it's nice actually I was expecting it to be that but it's actually okay I was expecting it to be like really sweet just kind of this is like kids feet I guess and I was young guys like sweeter smarter yeah I don't know what you mean with the little front furtors all the like like little what you call it the beans on toast stuff but they're like shapeness yeah I'm just gonna try the pasta because that is their traditional journey being pasta there's hardly any guy come on girl do you know what I mean do you think it's like that I know what you mean what you thinking you look confused I am confused she's confused sweet taste but I kind of do you know it's nice but I don't think I would it's not a fan guys really amazing not a fan what would you rate it I'd rate what would you rate it I'd rate it like seven out of ten really what would you rate it I'll find it like a five oh maybe it's not loving the pasta guys you know we can get like beans on toast with the sausages yeah that's what I was trying to say right guys comment down below if you have tried jolly bee especially some of our fellow peanut followers um comment down below and tell us what your favorite thing is from jolly bee we're gonna skip straight into putting even though we want to try something I think we're interested in this it is yeah peach mango colors that are home in the dollars you have to buy right it looks crispy it's small I like I like how it's small yeah that's cute because sometimes they can never eat a full do you like you like that is super sweet what's it oh I really I like that that's really nice out of ten eight point five eight point five out of ten not bad yeah me is gonna go for the burger it's humongous oh that's what we got it is it so this is the what's this called I forgot this yeah chicken sandwich chicken chicken yeah chicken yeah chicken sausages and then this is chicken sandwich okay give it a whole wow give it a good bite the concentration face gets me that's nice is it yeah the buns are quite sweet and this got like a it's like kFC yeah no I tell you it's like you know I need to make chicken with the de reuter colors oh yeah when you roll it in do it's a fun to pack up the instant I'm not actually sure what this is it's very hot I'm guessing it's rice it's more packaged up it's really hot yeah yeah that's cool it's nice and uh I can't wait whoa so I'm guessing you I don't know maybe put this on the rice or chicken I wasn't like grovy not sure this is oh that's what as well oh what man what night man devoid to near my house you got it okay yeah it's grovy right yeah it's like chicken oh yeah chicken grovy okay this chicken from set I'm gonna go in for straight up bite oh that looked nice nice no no nice but I wasn't expecting that what does it taste like I don't know the batter has a weird flavor like not what it's heading is it nice there it's nice try try it with some gravy just not not what I was expecting I don't know the flavor but long it doesn't taste greasy I'm gonna try the gravy I'll have to look for it yeah mmm nice gravy yeah that goes nice with a chicken gravy yeah that's like KFC when you're chips in gravy what are you about to do I'm gonna dip this in cheeseburger in the gravy is that gross uh I'm not I think so yeah it's good I don't know what that is now may oh overall guys we are actually enjoying the jolly bee I'd say I still prefer McDonald's wouldn't you may say the same oh you think that's better than McDonald's cheeseburger I've seen this cheeseburger if you've got a brain cheeseburger actually try at home okay most of this is amazing most rate in the burger but in the McDonald's I'd say pretty much all of it's very nice but I don't know I still would go McDonald's over jolly bee yeah but it's nice to try and also I like that they do pasta like instead of just burgers and chips and chicken they need to try one of these as we've got three so okay go whatever you like sweet things like mango and the real mango flavor kind of it's not that mangoy surprisingly yeah I think you're gonna like it crispy surprising surprisingly nice right I know what you mean I think the butter makes it taste like number five yeah true the inside is actually too Tiggins crunchy in the hungry more draight up I actually grew that up my I rated it 8.5 agree yeah yeah yeah I actually know that made's going for the chicken okay maize going for the chicken I thought it was yeah I didn't I don't know I just didn't expect it to taste like that see what you think just says that chicken no not the chicken the the butter the chicken's nice the actual butter what do you think hello anybody there sorry I'm thinking I know what you mean it's got it's not like I don't know it's different it's different but with a bit of gravy on maize love in the gravy guys we haven't tried any of the rice but obviously we all know what rice tastes like good yeah okay maize that again with the gravy she's obsessed guys okay right she's going for a carb meal bit of rice shredding the rice up gone right nice give me give me kfc guys okay we did get a lot of food she should try out so we have not managed to finish it all maize can you say what you rated jollyby yeah also I am going to eat some more of this we just halfway through we couldn't finish that all the burger all the pie because we had three pies we did finish this though um what yeah what you rated overall what you rated at 10 I think I probably rated seven seven yes it's 0.5 seven okay nice what was your favorite thing of the cheeseburger okay least favorite and the gravy and the gravy is the pasta I'm not I don't really like sweet savory kind of stuff so that's awesome oh you're gonna get heated on for that by like the pasta what was your favorite thing on the on the menu today for and out of ten or what would you rate jollyby out of ten what would you rate I did I said 6.5 to seven I would give it like seven five okay for jolly actually really enjoying that spaghetti so overall we both raised their bar seven how much all of this came to so you get a rough idea how much we spent on all this food because as we did actually get quite a few things because we wanted to try um off the menu different things okay that's not bad actually how much we got off because it's two drinks yeah because if we got um I'm three apple pies I'm three yeah three puddings because we normally we don't really get like I don't know spaghetti and just one burger so we got all the other stuff to try um the menu that's pretty good for that in McDonald's you'd never get it for that price yeah guys but jollyby has set us right up to go and get this full hour plane we're actually really early but so we were gonna have to sit out there for all time but now we can go in and hopefully there's I think there's a duty free this is this get it also can somebody tell us what I we never thought about putting my bags on tonis okay it's taken us five months five whole months of aching bags carrying these bags are you just putting them on your foot literally and it's so fun so fun let's like pushing a pram because our bags are our babies I'm so cringy um look at me she's off so guys we might as well close the video out here as it was just basically us reviewing and
