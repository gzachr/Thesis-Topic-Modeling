And since I have never done this before, you know, it takes a little bit of practice but... I think you're doing great. There's no better practice than just starting. Yeah! Just do it! They all used to have a lot of stuff. Something wrong. They just started a bicycle service. Yes! Makes some extra cash. So, you had to stop to buy some gas. Because we're running out of fuel. How is it for you, Martin? No, that's fun. It is fun. It's a challenge. During these times, we don't get challenged ourselves that often anymore. So just having the ability to drive something like this. Is that a little challenge, back? Okay! A few inches later. Well, guys, I'm a bit saddened. The tire blew up. Oh my god. Wow! That was unfortunate. Well, now I have to walk all the way to the other town. Which will take me probably 15 minutes. And see if there's a vulcanizing shop that can help us.

Borgers first time to drive a tricycle disaster. Oh! Sometimes you just have to laugh it out like the mishaps that happens to your life. There's always something though.

Guys, after one month of waiting, this actually got last and general Santos because they thought it's general Santos instead of general lunar. I don't remember the last time I did an unboxing video. I don't think I've ever done an unboxing video. Actually, it's mostly on my Instagram stories. Thank you so much, Olai, for sending Reese. This is what my mom sent us from Manila. I wouldn't say that I bring a lot of clothes whenever I travel. Just I bring whatever I need. A lot of face masks. Thank you, mom and loving. I think Reese are 50 pieces of face masks. A bunch of alcohol. Well, finally, because we're almost running out of alcohol. Three, uh, balls. And it's all different brands. Thank you, mom and loving it. If you're watching this, I haven't used any facial wash for the past three months. And I'm slowly breaking up. Luckily, I've been drinking a lot of water. One of my favorites, if you guys know this, comment below. Now, I've been wearing the same shorts. I think a lot of you noticed it. It's one of my favorite shorts from Zara. And that's the Peeley Butter. Peeley, peanut butter. I'm assuming that's from people. Oh my gosh, this is my favorite face mask. The SK2, it's quite pricey. I think this costs 20 to 25 US dollars. I also have some Dr. Jorke. And I think, but you know, I have six new face masks. Huh. I can't wait to do a skincare. It took 16 days to reach. I'll be seeing that one. Also got some picnic because it's my favorite snack. I've got three picnics by the way. This is my favorite, the ketchup price, keyboard. I bought some facial, you know, the block M8, there's Joe. And that's it. That is the whole. Now I need to freshen up because Martin and I will be attending a birthday dinner in general. Luna. So I need to be fresh, you know, I'm saying. And I can use my skincare. Woo hoo. Whoa. Boba Boba did it. You're the best. We feel like we're kids on Christmas Day. Oh, is this for you? I think he's great. Nice. I got new clothes. We've been having the same clothes for like three months. My work station. Yes. I don't have to have neck problems with it. We have some, yeah, surgical masks. Surgical masks. Yeah. After all. Mm-hmm. But this for me is... Bumblebee Tuna Salad. I think my mom... My mom thinks that you're going to like this. So it's a tuna salad for you. Thank you so much, mama. Love it. Wow. Your mama loving it also. No, I'm a mama. Love it. That's bad. My workout. My shorts. You have a lot of shorts, honey. Thanks, mama. Is that yours? What's that? Shh. I'm wearing makeup today. Who is she? What happened to Ava? I used a facial wash after three months of only using water to wash my face. I know it's disgusting, but I just didn't want to use other products for my face because my face is very sensitive and it might have a different reaction. To the product, the new product that I'll be using. Some girls like to buy clothes, shoes, designer bags, makeup. It's just that for me, skincare products is one of the things that I really spend money on, except for traveling. Anyway, I won't be vlogging. I'm so sorry. I want to relax and chill with my friends. And I'll catch you guys tomorrow. I'm going to be a little bit more careful. I'm going to be a little bit more careful. I'm going to be a little bit more careful. I'm going to be a little bit more careful. I'm going to be a little bit more careful. I'm going to be a little bit more careful. I'm going to be a little bit more careful. I'm going to be a little bit more careful. I'm going to be a little bit more careful. I'm going to be a little bit more careful. I'm going to be a little bit more careful. I'm going to be a little bit more careful. I'm going to be a little bit more careful. I'm going to be a little bit more careful. I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
