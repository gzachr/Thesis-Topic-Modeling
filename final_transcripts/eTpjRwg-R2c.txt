 Is there um is there multiple choice? I'm bald. Why does it taste a little cheesy? This? It's not? There's no boi! It's not? Riva's kind of scaring me up. If apple is, it's a taste. Is it an organ? Recording. Okay. 3, 2, 1. Hi everyone, my name is Elfahardo and this is my sister. Ava. I know, she's a little shy. But today we're going to be trying Filipino street foods. I'm not really sure if we're familiar with every single one. I'm for a fact, not familiar with every single one. I don't think she is either. But I really wanted to have her here because we both really like Filipino culture, both our parents are from the Philippines. And I feel like this video will help us connect with our roots. So we're going to try and do it one by one. Try to see how it tastes if we would try it again. And I'm excited. Are you excited? Yes, I'm excited. This one looks like this is like the colorful. Yeah. And then this is like, this one scares me. Yeah, this one definitely had like sauce on it. Yeah. So first glance, it looks like cheese. It looks like it's cheesy. Cheesy? I'm going to try to guess what it is. Okay. Is there um, is there multiple choice? Like, I really can't. Um, from the looks of it. Does it look like cheese inside? Like a fish ball? That one looks like a fish ball. Maybe this one's like a different version. Looks like it's fried. Let's get rid of it. Yeah. Hmm. And ball. And ball. And you. I thought I was going to eat that right? No. No, you're going to eat it. That's called Google earthquake. Oh. Yeah, I didn't eat it with um, but I just told everybody. Oh. I've heard of it. They have it. They have it in the States, but like, unless it's really cooked, that day they won't have it. I've heard of this. It's good. I have not. I like eggs. And I think for athletes as well, like, you can eat an egg before practice, after practice. Why? I don't know. But my dad says that it's good for you. Yeah, I like that. But yeah, sometimes I don't like eggs. Sometimes I do. So it's like 50-50. Wait, when you think about when it's egg, I feel like it's like that. But when you eat it, it's good. Like, you know, when you're eating scrambled eggs, it's really good. And then when you think about it, it's like, wow, I eat this all the time. That's not good. Next. Oh my gosh. Looks like fat, flat bread. I like smiling at my face. It's a doughy. There's an aftertaste. That's good. I like, oh. I feel like I watched a video about this. Like, they fry it one by one, and then they, they like somehow, try with this. This thing is a little sour. Shower. Why does it taste a little cheesy? Everything tastes like cheese. I don't know what it is. No, I don't know what it is. It tastes cheesy though. Not good. So that one is fishball. This? My fishball? There's no ball. That's so sweet. What? Disc. This is fishball? Fishball. Does it taste like fish, too? I said it tastes like cheese. Okay, let's try this one. So this might be called pancake or something. It's deep like a ball. No, I actually think this is a fishball. Is this fish? Fishball to point out. Why does it look so busy? It doesn't seem like it. I feel like I've had this. Is this squid ball? Yeah. We got it! It's my one. I feel like we have this at home. I feel like maybe it tastes like a little bit. That would be the disappointment if one of us didn't get that. But I think we eat this with hot pot. Like, you can do squid balls, like, then you dump it in, and then it doesn't take that too long to heat up and stuff. And then, yeah, I like this. This is a 10 out of 10. I always eat squid balls. That's why I know. I'm loyal. This is squid balls. That is scary, wee. Do you want to start with the scary one for a moment? This is squid. This has to be squid, right? This one looks like regular barbecue. This has to be squid. I like how it's charred. When you're walking in the streets of the Philippines, and you can smell it, the romance stuff, I would definitely want one of these. My dad would definitely want one of these. We can all mention our dad. He's a big foodie too. What's in this one? It's still a big regard, but it has nice nice smell. Wait, I can't dip my... I actually don't think that we've had squid like this. Wait, good though. Should I eat a whole? This is squid. This is a squid. So your guess is it's squid. Right, it's squid, right? He's like it. I don't know. I think it's squid. No, it's squid. Oh no, no! Ew. I don't know. I kept on saying squid this way. Maybe it's not something under the sea. Okay, then what? Yes, it's not. It's not? Yeah, it's not. Wait, that's kind of scaring me not going to answer. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Yeah, I think it's a little too chewy to be squid. Squid is like, it's hard to be madty. Yeah, this kind of tasted a little fatty. Pink. How many legs? There's a half. Yes. Four, two, three. Four. Is this an ear? What's it like to say? Look at the two. This one kind of looks like an ear. The apple it is. It's a face here. No! It's so good. No, it's good. It's squid. Squid, don't touch. This has to be squid, right? This has to be squid. I knew it. I knew it. That looks like an ear. I just ate it. I just ate all the thingy. No, I don't think I can eat it. No, this is dangerous. This is dangerous on this one. I want to go back to the fishies. What's your rating? Where are they? I think it went downhill. Before, I mean before, I was like, before I thought it was squid. I was like, I liked this. If someone were to say, I would still eat it, but specifically pig ears, I don't know. It was still good though. I'll give it like an egg. I probably give it an egg before knowing it's big ears. I think I'm been traumatized. I don't think I'd eat it if someone told me what it was. But it was good. I think it's good. It's great that you didn't tell us. Yeah. Because you'd be like, that's a good thing. I would not have eaten it. Okay, next. Yeah, wait. It is. It looks like heart. First glance. Oh no, wait. Okay, it looks like heart to me. It looks like something long because the way that they put it, like a snake is like, it's not like these. It's not like these words, like separate, but here it's all together. And then I don't know. It's like, it was squished down. And definitely this is like, the organ. This is definitely coricune. I'm not gonna think about it. I'm just gonna eat it because I want to try every single one. Wait, never mind. It doesn't look like a heart to me anymore. Looks like a stink. Go. A car. No, no. I think I'm gonna have to pass with one stick for a reason. There's one stick. The texture. Is it what's getting me? There's one stick for a reason. I'd have to add that. I'm doing this little piece. Anything? Is it an organ? I'm guessing it's a heart. No. Okay, that is a heart. A chicken heart. I'll give this to be a heart. No way. It's not a heart, right? Um, it actually is different for the organ. Okay. Okay. Different organ. It's called balloon balloon and the gal. So this like um, chicken is very. Oh. It's like at the end of this summer. On a day. Yeah. Yeah. Because those guys say you can't be a small intestine. This was like a small intestine. I remember dad eating stuff like this. I would give it like a four just because I feel like the texture was a little chewier than I would like it. I don't know what a gizzard is. Actually, my piece was in that bed. I give it a five. It was not that bad. I think you're giving it a little rating. I would give it a five out of ten. Oh man, I just- This is regular buckwheat. You look a little now. Yeah, but would you think about it? This all looks like fat. It does look like barbecue. It always has first. There's really fat like at the- In the little bottom. The end and then like the- It's in the bottom and then it's in the little pieces. Yeah, but it's like- It's all fat. Yeah. Like you know when you- It's like that because I always go for the fat. I mean I know that. I always eat the middle first and then I save the fat for last and then I like it. And then mom's like, that's not good for you. Don't do that reaction. I haven't even eaten it. Go eat it. I feel like it's gonna bite at me. I like the char outside because it on the inside is very chewy. It's crunchy. No, what animal in organ is this? Don't talk to that. I don't feel good about this. Why? About like what it may be? Because I think it tastes good. My most crunchy. I mean- My most crunchy. Without knowing what it is, I think I would give this like- I can eat it out of ten. I think it's pretty good. I think I have to give it like a four. I think I got like a weird piece. My nose like really crunchy. Do you have any guesses as to what it is? Four legs. It can't be a chicken. This is too big for a chicken. Cow. Okay, that's cow-cow-peasol. Um, it could be an instant chicken. It's ass. No! What? What? Can you say that? It's chicken ass. I told you I did not feel good about- I'm gonna be gone. I'm gonna be gone. I would not try that again. Okay, last one. I feel like I've been tricked. This looks like an intestine. This looks like a mini intestine. Oh man, I don't want to eat this. I'm a little scared. I usually- Oh! I've- Oh no. Only- Looks like little wormies. It's probably good if a lot of our population likes it, right? I'm gonna eat it. Looks like it's snake. It looks actually really good. It's very very good. It's a little aftertaste. No, I'm gonna go get a seven. This one's not that bad. I think it would be easier maybe eating it blindfolded because I also like die-checked it. My part was great. And I always see the- Small intestine. It looks exactly like this. I've never done a chicken butt, so I didn't- Oh, please don't say that again. You saw right? Yeah, that's the least possible. Oh come, J.C. offered me this the other day. Literally. Did you want some? This was good though. I would give this a seven out of 10. Probably give it a six out of 10. My biggest set of got was like very charcoly, but I feel like it was not that bad. I think the gizzard was the one I rated the lowest because I think it was um- I think this was the chewy one. I don't even think I rated any of these lower than like half, but I think this was my least favorite. Gizzard. Uh, I think my favorite one was the squid balls, because I was familiar with the taste anyway. Medium was like- Actually, I think this was pretty good. The chickens butt. Oh my god. It just tastes like when you have regular barbecue and it's like the fat part of the barbecue. I was gonna say this one was my least favorite. Really? Mine was like, I don't know. There was like this weird texture in mine. I think this one was my least favorite tasting. Oh, this one? The chicken's butt. And then I think my favorite one, this fish one. I think the safest is probably the egg. I like this one. Kind of tastes like cheese. I like that side. I think this one is pretty good. This one is the size like this fish. I'm sorry, but- Then the four-legged animals. They're still really good though. Like, I don't think we would have tried it if we knew exactly what it was at first, but I'm glad that we tried it without knowing what it was. Same thing for my friends. Like, if my friends were here, I wouldn't tell them what it is because I want their genuine reaction and how they actually liked it. Yeah, these I could easily recommend to my friends. These I would recommend to, but I wouldn't tell them what it- I wouldn't tell them yet. I wouldn't tell them yet. Let me just probably get this. How is the experience? It was good. I liked it. It was really good. I feel like if we're like, when we're walking in the streets and stuff, we'll be like, put them on the look and shaking gizzard back like- In a way, I think it did connect us deeper to our roots. I mean, I think generally, we're kind of scared to try a lot of new things. Like, we came into this thinking that we'd have a bubble or something. I don't know if I'm gonna do it. I feel like if you just keep an open mind and try new things, I ended up liking most of them. I think I liked most of them. Not what they were.
