 But you're Friday. The freshest. Alright, so this has been sent through so much on TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, literally everywhere. And I'm not familiar with the names, I'm not familiar with the faces, but you guys have really big recommendations. So, I think it's quite popular singer, not to show limo, Janice. You know Janice? Or I'm not, or Janice. And friends. I'm not too sure, but from the Facebook one that I saw, like his page has quite a bit of followers and he's got the blue verification thing. They do look like they're having the time of their lives. So let's just address that. But it has been sent a metric load of times to us. That's right. I thought we'll do a solo review of it because why not go on? Oh, look at that. We love a good para luman. No, para in human. Sainuman. Sainuman, sainuman. Sainuman. Sainuman. Sainuman. Sainuman.

What the fuck was what's going on? What the fuck is going on? It's just like level up after level up. Let me just call my friends and let's pretend that this is something that happens naturally. We will fail. Okay. What is this? What is this insane? Their vocal qualities are so perfect for this style. Who are they? Who are they? I smell fame. I smell you too good. You do not have made any money singing though. I smell fame. It's amazing. Their vocal qualities are so good. They are having a time of their lives. Also, I love the encouraging environment in which they are for each other. It's like, yeah, you go dog. Kill it. You know you can. This is so great. Also, the style of music just fits their vocal qualities so well. That's what I mean. Because it is a thing, right? Someone can emulate someone else. That's cool. Someone can sing a song really, really well. But what the difference between levels is you have found your sound and your final style that you're really good at. They all have a style and they all have a sound. That type of sound means artists. They are not your singers. No, no, no. At least they have spent a lot of hours putting their reps in. I'm telling you. I think they are artists. Some of them. At least one of them. I listen. They all hang around each other and shit. But they have a style. What the fuck? Yes, it was. Just I smell balox. Is this in just normal people? This isn't just the Philippines. What do you mean? Listen, I also think. I also think that. It's also the Philippines. I don't fucking know. I also think that male vocals from 80s rock rock era is on beaten. Like they they really did something. They really did figure something out in the 80s and the rock. Don't continue.
