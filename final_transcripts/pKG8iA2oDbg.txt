my neighborhood here in Cebu City and

Filipino Tagalog I'm not really sure to
be honest but of course there's
differences in dialogue I think most
people Manila speak a Filipino and a lot
of people in Cebu speak bisaya so let's
see if I can find someone like speak
both or just learn any other language
and along the way I'm going to highlight
some of the friendliest people probably

of course he's from Mindanao living in
Cebu now so maybe uh he was a little shy
but English after but I'm like listen
buddy you spoke and I understood so
forget about grammar you're not in
school right so the fact that he's so
friendly I think is all that matters so
yeah let's go see if we can find some
other people and I'm gonna try to retain
some of this information that I'm
getting about the language so yeah not
bad though right so a good way to learn
who needs to pay for online classes just
get out there and talk to people
oh

okay is it let me yeah okay is it fried
banana
yeah it looks like it's really saucy
oh with sugar oh like this banana sweet
already how much sweetness do you need
it's a lot right what's your name
 and yourself Connie are you
girls working around here yes okay cool
cool over there oh I see so are you from
Cebu yeah okay are you from Cebu yes
very good well thank you for your time I
appreciate it oh let me love me let me
got it let me thank you bye see you
and perhaps we could end the video here
right so today I learned how to say
hello uh good afternoon it's delicious
and how to get a coffee but I don't
really know if I remember any of it but
it doesn't matter right the idea is to
get out there and at least attempt it
and try and of course with a lot more
effort I could actually start to learn
to speak and no the good thing is here
people are so friendly and you can learn
anything you want by just being friendly
and approaching people and of course in
a much more organized way I'll be much
more successful and don't forget guys a
lot of these people here speak multiple
languages not only English and Bisaya
they speak Tagalog Filipino and probably
their own dialogue back in their home
city right so it's not easy so whoever
that's living in these Western countries
thinking oh you know
um whatever people can't speak English
properly they don't know the half of it
so they don't understand what it takes
to learn a second language it's not easy
at all so big UPS to everybody here that
speaks multiple languages and that's it
for me guys the whole idea was to get
out there and at least try to immerse
myself within my local community I live
here I come here every day I walk by
here and if these people are the people
that I'm seeing why not try to be at
least part of the community so that's it
for this one leave your comments down
below I know that my Bisaya is horrible
but let me know how I did at least with
a pronunciation and all these things all
right all right so I'm I'm open I mean
what's the word I'm looking for hey look
who it is 
nice to meet you nice to meet you so
we've got a collaboration coming up and
he's just joining my live not a live
stream my I was just finishing my video
you ready to go very nice all right
let's do it guys so check the channel
for future interview coming up
excuse me do you guys want to help me
with my Vlog I just have a question

video I just wanted to teach me how to
say good afternoon in visaya right
