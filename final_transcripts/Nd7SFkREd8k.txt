 How was it? I'm Mavoo, I'm Mugandangabi and Maligayang, Vagba Balek, Akinchano, Arobusio Vela, I am your host Vela and I have chosen this video specifically because today I want to laugh with you people alright? So let me read you the title of this video. Pinoy, funny moment, compilation 2021, Bawal, Tumawa, Pinoy, Puro, Kaloko Han, wins vlog number 3. Alright, but before we start, consider following me on Instagram at MusicGameNews because that is where you can DM me your suggestions. Alright, without further ado, let's get to it. What just happened there? Oh my god, is that what's his name? Not Vegeta, but the other guy. What's his name? Oh I forgot his name. On a stove, dude, that is genius. Oh my god. Goku, Sangoku. That is perfect. I mean yes, you're going to burn your toy, okay? You're collectible. But it looks exactly like the anime, like the manga, right? That is genius. Wow. I am familiar with this guy, man, his laughter is just so contagious. Okay, so they were teaching him how to drive, huh? Oh no, no, no, no. Oh my god, this is the PCR test, right? Dude, I've done the PCR test, but they never went that deep into my nose. Oh my god, this person is tickling his brain. She put like this much into his nose. Oh my god. Oh my god. He looks high, he looks high now. Oh poor dude. That was insane. Oh my god, this guy is sleep. What did he put in his mouth? Is it harmonica? Oh my god. Oh my god. Okay, okay, because this person snores, so if you put a harmonica in their mouth, they will, you know, evidently play the sound of the harmonica, right? Because all you need is a little bit of a breath. Oh wow. Okay, so this is the anthem of Naruto Shippu then. Oh my god, I didn't recognize it. This is so stupid. Oh my goodness. Are you serious? Dude, my gag reflex is just too strong. I would never be able to do this. Holy moly. Holy smoke dude. Oh my god. Holy moly. Oh god. Okay, these are very annoying. The Lion King low budget. Oh my god. They are so stupid. Oh man, that moment made me cry so much when I was a kid. Oh my god, that is so sad. I knew it. I knew it. Help me. Hermano brother. I actually watched it the first time in French, the Lion King then in English and that one is in Spanish. I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. I don't get it. We need English subtitles. Where is she crying? Is this supposed to be funny? Is he crying? Shampignon in French. What's in English? Oh no, it's onions. I didn't get it. I didn't get it. We need to get it. We need to get it. I wish there was a Filipino sitting beside me to explain to me these things. I wish there was a Filipino sitting beside me to explain to me these videos because I don't get it. Is this a prayer? Is this the guy wearing a mask laughing or crying? He's laughing. He's laughing. I don't know what to do. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. What? Oh no. They opened it right. It's going to fall completely on the food. That's not cool. That's not cool. Are we done? I was expecting to laugh a little bit more. Unfortunately, there were a couple of videos that I did not understand whatsoever because it was in Tagalog and that was unfortunate. But the first videos were funny. I'm telling you, man, sometimes I need a translator. But it is what it is. I just needed a video that was funny today. I didn't feel like reacting to something too serious. Thank you guys for joining me. See you in the next one. Peace.
