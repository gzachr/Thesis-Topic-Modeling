 There comes a question in everyone's life. Is rice rice? I haven't hit that moment in time. I'm not ready for that question. It's when you're sitting there alone in the dark room with a bowl of rice, and you're looking at it, spinning it around in the bowl, and you're like, what is this? And then you hear a voice from the darkness of your room. Rice is rice. And then it hits you, epiphany, and you realize Joe Koi told you. Rice is rice. Yeah. Welcome to this great intro reaction video. Rice is rice. Recommended on our last Filipino reaction video, a lot of people were talking about it in the comments. So we decided to check it out. Yeah. Well, the specific one you want us to choose is just his most popular one. Yeah. Let us know. So from what we understand, this is his half Filipino. I believe so, yeah. And he's American. I think? I don't know. Or maybe Canadian. I don't know. Some of the things I don't know when you think about him. But it's comedian. He's a comedian. And you guys like him. So let's check him out. Why not? And hopefully you guys enjoy it. If you do subscribe, like the video or Filipino stuff coming soon. We're going to go to Jeollabee this week. We're probably going to be able to go in there in the next two days. So they have the good stuff there. I don't think there's that all the stuff that you guys can go on and see. Hello, hello, whoo-beeh. Hello, hello, and a food. Food. I'm excited to eat some food. That's for for I can sure. But while we're still checking out, Filipino Christmas videos is being closer to Christmas as well. Because we kind of stick with the holiday. We need to get some Christmas. I mean, it's already started for you guys. We need to add constantly a Christmas. We need Christmas hats. Let's do this. Rice is rice. Or is it? Here we go. I'm half white, half Filipino. That's hard. Here we go. Which means my dad was in the military. That's really sh**. A lot of soldiers were fighting for this country. My dad was dating. I'm his purple heart. My dad would say, Boraline racist sh** to me when I was a kid. Boraline racist sh**. But I knew he was joking. It's my dad. Just sitting at the dinner table was like, no, I married your mom, right? Why? Because I love Chinese food. She's Filipino, Dad. Whatever. Rice is rice. Rice is rice. Oh, my God. Rice is rice. That's so racist. I'm not knocking with my mom had to do to get to America. She's f**king, that's her hustle. That was her hustle. God bless you, mom. You hooked up with a soldier and had a kid in America. God bless you, mom. She did what she had to do. She could have hooked up with a Filipino and had a kid in the Philippines. You know how much a comedian makes in the Philippines? A chicken and flip-flops. My mom was a sh**. My mom and dad divorced when I was like 10, 11 years old. My mom had to raise us on her own. She did that sh** on her own. Top is sh**. Sometimes a little too tough. Like it was borderline illegal. It sucked. She never took this as a doctor. My mom never took this as a doctor. My mom raised us like we were still in the Philippines. She tried to cure everything at home. Like a real Filipino woman. You have it. You have to die to go to the hospital. Shit. My mom cured everything with big vapor. She went all the way. Big vapor. I hate that stuff. I should have died nine times when I was a kid. That's abuse. There's one time I thought I had pneumonia from mom. I think I have pneumonia. I'll put extra pics on your body. Just grab it everywhere, Josie. Grab it on the bottom of the foot. And then put a sock on the foot. And then the pneumonia will come out of the foot. I just smothered and fucking bitch. I should have called a cop. One time I was so sick. I swear to God, two-storey I go, mom, I don't feel good. I can't sleep. I can't sleep. My mom took a finger and stuck it in bitch. And rubbed it on top of my eye. Oh, top of my eye. That shit burns up out of my mouth. I can't open my eyes. My mom was, what can you sleep? Wow. Good night, Josie. You give her shit. Me. She never hit us. I'm gonna never hit us. She just scared us a lot. She loved the curse. And she used to flex like that. She did it shit. She dropped that to America. Anyone that does this shit, hey, my mom's fucking shit. She did it to all of us. You know how embarrassing that is? To get pumped by a four foot eight eight. It's a fucking mouth. Get out of the goddamn foot, not there. Get out of the foot, not there. I'm gonna get out of the fucking foot. I'm gonna get out of the fucking foot. I'm gonna get out of the fucking foot. I used to cry. I used to cry until my mother and I were like, I have kids. I'm never gonna do it. You do to me to make kids. And my mom looked at me. I said, I should put her hand on my shoulder. And she was just that promise me, okay? Never have kids. Ooh. Ooh. Wow. Okay. The Filipino mother. Vicks vapor rug. Vicks vapor rug. The whole rug on your face. Maybe she's the mom invented that rapid around you. She's really down the stairs. Vapor rubber rug. Yes, exactly. But apparently that's the Filipino that has showed up again. Interesting. I hated that stuff as a kid. I just felt it like super minty thing. Yes, it's super strong. Yeah, and you put it on your chest. Yes, okay. And you breathe it in. I don't know why you're supposed to clear your sciences. I hated it. I hated it. And it smells super strong. I mean, you put a little bit on your chest and it's that strong. I can't imagine. Your whole body. Your, your, your had a Filipino mom that has had bought a giant tub of it. And then every time you got sick, you just jumped inside. I was a murky one of the baths, though. Oh. All right. I got to pack some vicks before we go to the Philippines. Yeah, apparently. You can just, you can just gift it to people too. They'll try to love it. They'll care. We can do it. We can meet some people from the channel. Bring your vicks. Vicks. Here's your vicks. And then just like surprise random people with vicks and see what their reaction is. They'd probably be afraid of it. And then their mother would come and say, oh, thank you very much. Grab a glove, slap it on their chin. Yeah, this is for you. Slap the other place. Yeah. That was pretty funny. Yeah. It was very, I mean, obviously it's more relatable for like people who have Filipino parents, but it's still to us outside of it. I just hear it. Such weird stories is funny. Yeah, and we understand some of them more than like non-Villainaud person would. We know some stuff about you. We know the inside. Yeah. We get the inside joke stuff. We're one of you. Yeah. Anyways, hope you guys enjoyed more coming soon. Jolly Taste Test coming soon as well. Yeah, yeah. So hopefully you guys enjoyed that. So see you then. Bye-bye.
