 What's up, Philippines! Welcome to another reaction video on our channel. I'm Mike. Kennamnally. We're two travel, food and lifestyle vloggers based the beautiful city of Makati, a metronominal at the Philippines. I start all the videos the same. I know. We're also quarantine vloggers. Yeah. Lately. Yes. Quarantoggers. Quarantoggers. Anyway, Nilly, what are we reacting to today? We are reacting to a video that compares Bangkok versus Manila. People don't like comparison videos. Comparison is the thief of joy. But anyway. I'm curious to see. It came highly recommended. So we definitely want to check it out without reacting to videos that you guys sent to us here in the comments. I'm also on Instagram making it happen vlog and more importantly Nilly's like underline. Because she always solves all the messages looking for the best videos to react to. And Nilly is on her way to hit 100k on Instagram. So definitely head on over, give her a follow. Take the talking of 100k. Talking about the K. Thank you so much for following Mike. He reached 100k and he owes you a Filipino song. Yes. But unfortunately I was in hospital. I had surgery so I couldn't prepare. But it's on my list. We haven't forgotten, buddy. Just wanted to mention it. All right. Are you ready? Jump right in. I think I need glasses for this. Is it with text? I don't know. I don't know. Well, shall we start? Yeah. Good vibes. Good beats. Oh. Oh, wait a second. This is... Oh, no, that's not. In the knee, just... And tie. And then up, cut the... In the air. Yeah. Try to wrap your... Terrible at this. Okay, so we've got a kind of an intro. With the whole time. All right. We've been to Bangkok many times. Many, many times. And that's very close to Manila. Yeah. Of the actual ones. We know that. That's music, though. With the beat drops. Nice, nice hyperlapse. Very good visuals. I thought this was more information, but good visuals. Yeah. Maybe it's just about the aesthetics. Maybe. Yeah. That's very... That's intense. That's very... That's intense. Oh, upstep. I wasn't ready for upstep today. I haven't eaten today yet. Great, I mean, amazing hyperlapse. Come on. Get out of here. That's awesome. We're just like, is this a mix of... Oh, okay, nice. Okay. Okay. 429 billion GBP in 2019. Yeah. Lots of hyperlapse. Yeah. Here comes another beat drop. It's gonna happen. What information we're gonna get when the beat drops? No information. It's a city by night. Yeah. Quite impressive. I know how much work goes into making nice hyperlapses. There's a lot of patience. The beat drops very often in the sun. Yeah. I'm kind of hypnotized. Like the fifth beat drop. Wow. Intense. But nice impression of Bangkok. Very cool. A few things on this side. And here comes Manila now. So it's probably like hyperlapses of Manila and some information of Manila. Oh yeah, we've been dangerous on Circle. Yeah. Top.8 million. Manila went. You did a nice hyperlapse there. Did do a nice hyperlapse there. Video will pop up right here. Oh, not a new face. Hmm, so these are like more drone shots? That's a result park right? No. Maybe yeah. Here we go with the hyperlapses. I think we've got past here. We were there like a few weeks ago. Sick. Wow. Yeah, that's where the coffee shop is. And the past. Capitoli or the museum? Hmm, see there? Be there. Be there. Oh, now we're transitioning to nighttime. GDP, 357, a little bit less than Bangkok. Beautiful shot. Yeah. Just felt like, how many? How many does it? Is it the channel? I don't know. Nice shots of the train. And he's a lot of angles of Manila that you usually don't see. I have seen so it's really cool. We see them. Now it goes to like night. We barely fly the drone in Manila. Yeah. It's not so easy to find spots to take off and be in the North-Basine. Oh, looks great. I... Hmm. Look at that. Wow. And the paint's represent. It comes another beat drop. Oh, that is... Did you see it? Impressive buildings. Oh, my cup, see! These yellow lights aren't always there, right? That's just during Christmas. I think they are... They are the whole year. But maybe they turned it off for... quarantine bill. Electricity bill, isn't it? Yeah, Morocco is expensive, man. We will continue next time. Am they in the bay? Miss Marais? Yeah, I know, it's really nice. Konkã€œ Papa! That's a cool shot I think that's in between. Did you see in Makati? Chinatown. Big Nando. Cool. Wow, very impressive. Yeah. Love that. Well, we. A little bit less facts than I expected. Yes, that was a lot more, a thousand percent more hyperlaps than I expected. It was a nice, made, nicely made video. Good impression. The only thing that was missing was a little bit the happenings on the streets. That's something that is for me more interesting. I think the greatest thing about the Philippines and the people that live in it. So I like to see the smiling faces. And I also missed some food in the shots, but I can't have it all. You can't have it all. Yeah, anyway, guys, thank you for submitting this video. Any other recommendations videos we need to check out. Please let us know in the comments down below.
