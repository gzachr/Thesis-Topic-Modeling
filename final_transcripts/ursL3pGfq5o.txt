 Hello good morning here in Capari Townsour. I have found you another little gem on my way out to do a a talk as I walk. This is about a 60 or 70 year old home here on the highway and the man who is running it and living here is a green finger. He loves to know all of the different plants sometimes he sells but it is such a idyllic location. If they ever did knock it down and build something else one would hope they leave the tree up. I'm not sure whether that's a mango tree or not. I think it might be a mango tree but it's a very pretty sight. Anyway I just thought you might like to see it. Behind the property is another member of the family of built just down the little gravel driveway just down the side here but as you can see doggy guarding the house. It's a little bit derelict but there are some parts of it that are being still used but it's a beautiful old house. Imagine all the history of that place. Anyway we will go back to our wonder around the neighborhood here. At the moment we're on the highway and as you can imagine it's Christmas time and the traffic is fairly busy today. These are some of the plants that the guy in the old house actually is propagating. They're boogamvillians. That there is a store that was once and is no longer the dispute over the land has become the issue so it never really came too much but you'll see a lot of that here in the Philippines. But back to my thought for the day. Right well my thought for the day is my thought for the day and that is where do I get all of the information and ideas from. Well believe it or not they come out of my head. I never know quite what I'm going to be addressing or what I'll be talking about until I actually do it. I find that it's a lot easier to get your head in the right space when you're coming up with an idea to talk about each day. Now the differences here in the Philippines we do operate on a completely different clock in a way because when they talk about Philippine time let's have a wander down here. We'll see what's down there. This little right of way will come away from the highway as well but we'll wander down here and have a look. Of course all of these little properties along here may well be little bad little what I would call batches almost little homes for people to make a living out of or even to live. Hello good morning and as you can see it's just a shared driveway access to all of the different homes along from the highway. So what you have to remember is that when you drive down these areas or you walk down them look sometimes it's quite rural but behind all of these homes often it is just farmland and the people who live around here had just built back from the highway over the years but many parts of it are connected to where the farmers do their crops. So it's always interesting to have a wander around these little areas. Don't be scared to go in there if somebody doesn't like it you just apologize and just walk away. There's not like they're going to get really really pissed with you because this is just a public access for people to get to their homes it's like a shared driveway so you're not really trespassing. If they have gates that's telling you where their property ends and where it starts so there's no intrusion so to speak. But as I say before there's Filipino time you often find that somebody will say there's a party starting at two o'clock in the afternoon and so everybody gets ready now in the west we would say well let's make sure we're there by a sort of quarter to two. Make sure we're there quarter an hour early and of course over here it's probably better to wait an hour after you think it's going to start because you never know for sure when you're going to be welcomed at the house and who wants to be the first one there I don't think anybody wants to be the first one to arrive at the party so always remember that you put aside maybe an extra hour from when they say and you guys have arranged a date I think you always make sure if she says to a clock you make sure you're early so she can't turn around and say to you you were late because they will be offended if you're late but we can't be offended by them being on the Filipino time the other thing of course to remember is with Christmas almost upon us there is a hive of activity with all of the different organizations sending out their goods the last minute purchases arriving from Shopee TikTok and Lazada at the gate and you guys foreigners must remember this is a time of giving and sharing and I can assure you you will be asked to do a lot of that and it will come in the form oh dad there's someone at the gate can you go out and see what it is of course they know it's a parcel that's arrived for themselves or maybe maybe their mother not for me because I know when my one's arriving so of course what do you do you go out how much sir it's for seven sir oh it's for seven sir and what happens then 500 600 100 20 whatever the amount is it's yourself that is being generous the Christmas because you will always be told of course pay it now dad I will pay you later of course later means it's a gift it doesn't mean it's later meaning they will pay you later because the pay you later is not necessarily what they see it as now of course being Christmas we have to take it on the chin and I can hear some of you saying oh I wouldn't do that I'd send them away and tell them to come back when they've got the money available well there's another way around that of course when it comes to food getting the money for the food the last minute food you can always turn around to them and say darling remember when I bought all that stuff from Lazada and the member you were going to pay me what was it now it's about three thousand oh well I was going to use that money to buy the food today what do you do then of course is she will go out and buy the food which means like we used to often say in Australia Germans especially I don't know why they picked on Germans they used to say they go around with hedgehogs in their pocket the reason being is their money is in put in the pocket first and then they put inside their pocket the hedgehog and the reason being is that who wants to put your hand in the pocket and get a spike from the hedgehog so meaning that they're a little bit tight I think well Filipinas are just the same we're now approaching the entry to Dala Pauan I think I did do a video along here once before so those that didn't get to watch it can see what it is this is on the other side of the highway running parallel with the river with the Nagillion River which is only a few meters away to my right and something I will comment on here at this point also as you'll see these electric vehicles a lot of these are popping up everywhere now and one of the reasons that they are so popular is that you don't need a driver's license you don't need insurance you don't need crash helmets and even the kids can drive them and they are just everywhere everywhere you go you see these electric vehicles all shapes and sizes how are you today good oh okay I better let the car go by how somebody had a prank there I see oh that's the bureau that's the jail car going along what they call a bureau of something rather I can't remember exactly but it's basically the prison authorities you often see them going around maybe they're going to the barangay for some kinds of gathering for Christmas but the guy who's driving the car that I let pass the black one it looks like he's had a bit of a ding is now you see look here another one of these electric vehicles now these vehicles they're around about 60,000 pesos sometimes a little bit less but they're just battery operated and they've got all the the wheels there was the wheels and what do they call it something in something in whistles all the bells and whistles that's I think that's the expression and that's what they go around in charge them up and they're great for going around the neighborhood or just into town chicken boys find chickens in the houses around here picking up all the bugs biting over them with their lizards and when you've got nothing better to do it's always quite nice to have a walk in your neighborhood and we're better than places that you've maybe not been around for a long time because you'll see different things different visions you'll find somebody doing a renovation somebody's pulled down an old house and they've added it got the washing out a bit of an overcast day today but everybody's busy doing cleaning another lovely home there there are some very nice homes here in Della Pallan but there's certainly a mixture of older style younger style and what I call pickled pickled he how's it that house down the end of the driveway was for sale not that long ago maybe a year or so ago the one that you see it with a car park and there was another one not a long here just up the road and I'll point it out I think for the piece of land which was rather large it was going to be demolished and therefore it was really being sold for land value only I'm just wondering if it's this one here oh we're at the we're near the barangay and what you can hear in the background is the kids but having a some kind of festival hello hello guys oh god some sort of event going on I hope that's not copyright music that's the sound like it oh it's the kids singing hello hello what's your name? uh what's your name? Mickey Mouse what's your name? Don't you duck? oh it's my name oh right yeah yeah yeah yeah it's good see how friendly the kids are they just come up to you and want to try out their ingots on you and they're so proud that they're able to get hello hello Merry Christmas you have your happy day what what's the event? it's a program Christmas program it's a Christmas march of double leaf hour all right good thank you sir bye bye but you see there's a good example you know nobody's aggressive here you know they're not trying to rip you off of course you've got scammers everywhere but when you're just walking around your neighborhood you're familiar to them more than they're familiar to you because when you are living in an area like I have for the last eight years people sort of get to notice you we sort of stick out a little bit and therefore but they're always very keen to say hello and wish you good well and especially now it's Christmas time you see we'll down the long driveways to homes there's some beautiful trees around these areas they make very good building blocks if they were for sale and I'm sure some of them are but here we would I would say that we're at certain times there could be a high risk of flooding here because we're right alongside the river and the river itself is actually can be known to flood dalle paon oh now this is the house I was talking about one of my subscribers asked about this particular property this one was about two million pesos but it's not the house that was the value it's the land and as you can see it's it's quite a big piece it's very wide it's probably I'd say 20 maybe 10 maybe 20 meters wide 18 meters wide and it goes right down right the way down to almost where those chickens are down the side so it's a good location and I suppose if you made I suppose you'd call it on a basement maybe a washing area underneath and parking at the car you could put a two-story building on there and not have to worry about if there was a flash flood come through the area which is not always see now there's an old home it's been built on concrete when I say old it's probably 50 years old maybe it's got an old original home on top so what probably happened it was probably built concrete underneath and they've left the old part up on top and sadly of course it's become a little bit derelict on the top but people still live in the lower portion now and that's what often happens it's down to money it's down to availability of funds that make everything happen here or not happen you never know what's going to how a house is going to look you can build a home here and some people have got the money to maintain it keep it washed keep it clean and some people don't see now there's another older home if you or go up and have a look it looks like they've got dogs so they've got somebody looking up but that's an old love the home a lumber home with three barking dogs so let the owners know there's someone around and here's a waiting shed you often see waiting shits around the areas the neighbourhood and that's what they're there for says an audience here an audience preserving curfew hours for miners from 10 pm at night till 4am and within the territorial jurisdiction jurisdiction of Nageemian low union parents guardians are responsible for the actions of their minor children pursuant to provisions of the family code of filipines there you are neighborhood watch in process and I think if I look over this I'll call it the sea wall but it's the river wall that's the river and the flood bank and the flood plain and if I go up on all of these have steps going up and going down and that's the flood plain and quite often the river when it's really really heavy rain sometimes even reaches the bottom of this wall but there have been historical reasons for it to flood that's why this wall was put in place and there's the big bridge in the distance going into Nageemian proper you can see it's very overcast today up towards Bargeau which is hidden in the mountains there behind us in front of us I should say and the buildings you see in the distance are all associated with various authorities and of course epic more itself so if you like the vision of the area around Nageemian don't forget to give us a thumbs up and don't forget to subscribe and share the notification button and
