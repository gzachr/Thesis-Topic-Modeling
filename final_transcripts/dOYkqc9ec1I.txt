 One thing that I like about visiting the Philippines is when the Filipinos are singing the traditional Filipino music in the restaurant that sounds very nice but what I don't like about the music in the restaurant is that the amplifier is turned up very loud which does not make sense because acoustic guitar amplifier is supposed to be balanced with the level of the singer not super loud because acoustic guitars are not meant to be super loud and also when you're trying to eat it's hard to think about what you're eating if you're just thinking about how loud the acoustic guitar is maybe electric guitar makes more sense to be super loud but acoustic guitar you need to turn the amplifier down and this is everywhere I went not just one or two places they all got that acoustic guitar amplifier away to loud and also keeps singing the Filipino traditional music because that's very nice
