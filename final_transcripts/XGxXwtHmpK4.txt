 But you're Friday. The freshest. B- More Q-Shay for you, Alpharbe. This is Ulan on The Wish Bus. Ulan, yeah this is one of the most popular performances. Yes, apparently this is a really popular song and I'm really excited. I think they were awesome the first time I heard it. So, hey, hey, let's go. It's Q-Shay. Q-Shay. What a nickname! I wonder where you come from. Someone explain it in the comments below. I'll tell you why. I mean, I freaking adore this because you guys have not even seen that. You first play. It's fine, it's fine. They name it Smudge. They name it Sedentary. They miss my reaction to it. What a vibe, I freaking love it. Oh, it's on there wrong. I'm gonna put this on. That was the same day, I think. Oh yeah, the same day. Oh, my God. You're my persona, my child. Oh, yeah! Love that! Oh, I'm cool, I'm cool. Oh, how cool are they? But, I don't know. Oh, I'm cool. Ulan is rain. Nice. I think that's what it means. Ulan. I think that's what it means. Ulan, if you want M, then you have this in the movie. Oh. Sure dude. Wow, tough part of Ulan. Ulan is just... Ulan? Ulan. Oh my God. I don't know, don't laugh at that. How are you mate? Good yeah? Mother just the right thing, it's just saying. I really freaking love this stuff. Wait, wait, wait, give me a second. Right? I got it right. Yes! But then they recorded it the same day, they recorded the other thing. Stayed. Yeah, they remind me a lot of, like, for some reason, like, creed. They do. I would love to see our, uh, two bands ever collaborate. Together. Has that ever happened? In the Philippines, uh, what is the price? Not in the Philippines, it's just worldwide. Because I want them on creed. Is creed still going on? I don't think so. No, no, I don't think so. Oh, I haven't planned, I haven't planned. Right, I'm gonna make a time with sheen. Right? Just for Q and Shay. Go back in time. Meet the guy from creed. Make a song. Make a song. Go back to the future. Which is the present. Okay. Because they're future. They're present. They're present. No. But they're past. Is they're present? Is they're present. Our past. Which makes it, and the future, the present, and the past. They're still present. So what's your model? What are you getting? Uh, yes. I was just gonna say a really, like, musically, they're so clever. I adore that alternative rock sound. We, I don't know somehow why we've lost it. Like, in the new days, like, in the new era, we've lost that. And it's so refreshing to hear it again. Like, from a life perspective, and a life setting as well, it's so cool. It hits a very special spot for me, that genre, because I grew up listening to that. So listening to it from the Filipino take on the genre, it's so refreshing, because it feels even more homely. Because the language is so similar to Spanish. And... In the bands, it sounds the people. It's very similar to them. Yeah, it's very, and yet it maintains that Western, uh, the American rock alternative field to it. It's such a cool hybrid. I love it. Because someone said in the comments that arrangement of stay was faster than the original. Ah! And then that's what I say. My phone's running out of batteries, so I could be completely tripping it. It could be a completely different song, because we listen to so much music. But I think I am correct. Ah, okay. So they are kind of like, yeah, kind of like just arranging a bit differently to how they played it on the radio for the first time, how the record came out. Oh, I adore that. See, there's so many advantages to having a band, yeah, to have an abandoned gifted play. Now everything is about, it must sound how it was in the studio. Hence why you're hearing so many bands, and some of your favorite artists use click tracks. Yes. So that way, they can replicate the sound of the studio, because they have minimal variables that can go differently. Yes. I love setting, but here, I love it. Yeah, I like the tailored, made type of version of it. And thanks Wish for the subtitles. Oh yes, thanks Wish for the subtitles. So many people are, and I know they know this now, there's so many people from all over the world watching that, you know, watching their videos, and they may not understand it. And he adds a lot of value when you do not be able to hear it. Absolutely. And he helps me figure out certain words. They're so lame. They're crazy. Yeah. Love it. How are they so good? Oh, he's... His vocal work is so narrow, he's so nice. Oh, he's so nice. Hey, go, lad. Oh, I love that arrangement. That's so much rap, I'm a coastie glad that. Yeah, that's another thing, but we got a highlight here, that is, they're using clothes, like coasting guitars. That is so hard. That's how good a yo-yo guitar. That good? Oh, he's so nice. Oh, he's so nice. Also, the harmony work is brilliant, it's so good. I'm on a mixed playing so much, man. I can't wait to get back into my gigs, dude. I can't wait to get a gig, yeah. I can't wait to get back into my gigs. Call for progression. Yeah, we're gonna face. Oh, that's fantastic. Good choice, giving out a coasting. What? What an arrangement. People scale work, man. Oh, yeah. You chose to give it a acoustic, a lot, a lot. Because it makes it more humane. Unless, yeah, less heavy, you know, more light or acoustic. Oh, it's such a great, great, freaking performance. Two acoustic guitars, giving that bass and break to like go off and go crazy. Switch up that they changed it rhythmically and then broke it back. Oh, it's so cool, it's so dynamic. Yeah, it makes me miss playing. Don't like that, that kid, but they have that rolling kid. They have their wish. Yeah, I think you should. Yeah, I've seen enough of it. I've seen enough of it to win it now. Yeah, it's so great to adore that stuff. Q-Shay killing it, dude. Yeah, I just want to drop a text to feel the drummers and find out what they feel. Okay. Yeah. Good. Anyways, yeah.
