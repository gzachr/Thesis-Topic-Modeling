 Well hello there guys today we are going to see what McDonald's is like in the Philippines. So let's go. Now I do not know much about McDonald's in the Philippines but I think that there are some pretty interesting menu items here. So I'm very excited to give it a shot. If you don't know McDonald's all around the world are different. They have different menu items for different places and I'm assuming we can get some spaghetti here but we'll have to see. Okay so I am currently staying in Salcido which is a part of Makati and look at this massive McDonald's. Now it is like right at lunch time so I'm assuming that it's going to be nuts here and I'm indeed correct. Wow hello. Let's see what we can find here at the McDonald's. Alright so let's touch the start and let's see what is on the menu here. We'll go dinin' and I'll pay cash. I don't have my card with me. So alright let's see what they have here. So they have chicken that is something that you cannot find at McDonald's in the States. So let's try the original chicken McDo. Okay I guess we're going to do the spicy McDo with spaghetti. Let's just do the spicy McDo here and let's add the order. Okay so we got chicken we got spaghetti. Let's see what the pasta and rice bowls are. Well let's take a look. We're already getting spaghetti but okay. Let's take a look at the rice bowls. Mushroom pepper steak. Yeah we got to get that. One piece mushroom pepper steak. Add the order. Okay so see what the new products are here. Mcnugget meals now. Alright let's take a look at the chicken. So we already got a chicken McDo. We have oh McCrispy Chicken Fale. Interesting. What is this? A la king. Alright let's add that to the menu here. Let's add that to the order. I have no idea what that means. Alright let's take a look if they have any interesting burgers here. Okay you have a cheesy McDo. Yeah I think we got to go with that. Okay. Look. Shake shake rice. Alright let's give that a shot. And then do they have any like. It's a chain of strength. Wow interesting guys. So many things. I'm just looking to see if they have any special drinks that you can only get in the Philippines here. I don't think so. Okay let's get a Coke Zero. Oh let's just get a regular Coke Zero. Alright. Add to order. What do you think guys? I mean alright what else do we have here? So pasta and rice. Burgers. Chicken. I feel like there's got to be something else here. Hey trees. Look at this guys. You can get a cheesecake here. Up here. Caramel cinnamon bun. Feeling like that might be really nice. Let's add that to the order. Alright look baby's shake fries. We already got one of those. Alright let's take a look if there are any other burgers I missed here. I think everything else is just like a classic McDonald's thing. We have a rice bowl. We have pasta. Okay let's take a look at the desserts again. Pretty standard. And alright done. I think that's going to be our order here. So let's take a look what we have. Spicy chicken Mcdoe with the McSpaghetti. A mushroom pepper steak. Crispy chicken filet. Cheesy Mcdoe with small fries. And caramel cinnamon bun. So total is 525 pesos. Okay let's enter the number here. Okay so now we got to pay at the calendar here. Hello. Hi there. Morning. Hi mom. We are the spicy chicken spaghetti. I want this one. Can you please say it? I love you. It's a tasty burger. This is called zero. Yeah. It's a tasty crisis and then caramel cinnamon. Okay you got all this. This is my part. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. Guys that came at the wrong time. Look at this. It is so busy here. Look at this. And somewhere my order is up there. 242 actually is not even on the screen yet. So it's going to be quite a while. Alright guys well the order is here and I'm hoping my gopour doesn't overheat but because I'm right in the sun. The only place without music but anyway take a look at this. I also they're bringing out my caramel bun here but let's take a look at the overview. Oh thank you so much. My guy at Mount Sinabon. Oh thank you. There it is. There's the caramel cinnamon but yeah let's take a look what we have. So crispy chicken fullet with some type of sauce and plain rice. Okay. Okay cool. We have the McChicken Spaghetti here. Over here we have... Oh gosh I don't even remember. Oh beef steak. It's like mushroom steak. The fries. I've been told you have to shake with in this bag here. So they're seasoning in the bag and then here's the burger McDo. So let's get into it and let's give this a shot. I'm very excited. Alright guys well I think the first thing we try here is this mushroom steak. So take a look at this. It's like some sort of steak here with mushroom on top. I'm assuming it's like a creamy gravy. Wow. It's actually quite good. Wow. I can't exactly remember what the meat is but the sauce is really good. It's like a pepper sauce sort of mushroom taste great. Rice is good. Wow. I'm surprised. It's really good. Interesting. I was not expecting that. Alright. From here. Let's give this... Now I love fried chicken and you know I'm on this quest to find good fried chicken. So let's take a look at this spicy McChicken here or is it the McDo? I forget exactly what it's called and this spaghetti. Now I don't have high hopes for this spaghetti. I'll be real with you. I am interested to see though is it better than jollybee? So this spaghetti seems to have like some sort of meat in it sort of like a hot dog. Oh man. No. No no no no. Oh. That spaghetti is not good. Jollybee's spaghetti is better. Wow. Oh. It is so bad. Look. Do not get the spaghetti in McDonald's. Wow. Disgusting. I need a look. Just giving you my raw take here. I need to take a sip of this coke. Oh my god. I don't know why they serve that. It's disgusting. Alright. Here's the spicy chicken. I think it's alright? Yeah. Oh my god. Let's give this gravy a shot here. Yeah. It's juicy. It's not as hot as it should be like heat wise. When you call it cold. And it's a little cold actually. The chicken is actually a little cold. Yeah. It's not very good. It's really not good. Some of you have seen my other McDonald's video where I was insanely impressed by the fried chicken at McDonald's Thailand. I'm sure some of you have seen my Jolly B video. Jolly B's fried chicken is much better than this. If you're in the Philippines, just skip the McDonald's fried chicken. Definitely don't get this spaghetti. Now what's interesting is this pepper steak. The first item I tried here is pepper steak. So far is the best item I've tried out of I think three. It's actually really good. I'm going to eat the whole thing. Mushroom pepper steak. Yeah. It's actually quite good. If you like that. Yeah. Alright, so this is a next one is a McChicken Filet. Here is some type of sauce on it that I'm really interested to try. I wasn't expecting this but they give you a ball of rice as well as sticky rice. But let's give this McChicken Filet here a shot. I'm curious to see what the sauce is. There's a special name for the sauce. I can't remember what it's called. Guys, it literally tastes like coconut. It's like a coconut sauce or something. What? Oh. Yeah. Chicken Filet, ala king. Ala king is what it's called. So there's some sort of like ala king sauce on here. Okay. Hoothily, I cannot describe you with the sauce taste like other than... I'm pretty certain there's coconut in there. Surprisingly, this chicken filet is better than the fried chicken. I'm just curious. Let's take a look at what this rice ball looks like. Let's just open up this rice ball. Nice. And you can just kind of eat it. Like that. The rice is good. I'm McDonald's. You know? I'm genuinely really not sure what to think about this chicken filet ala king. I don't know what the sauce is. It's sweet. It's like a sweet white sauce. Now, another thing I have high hopes for is the cheesy burger McDo. I guarantee it's just kind of like a normal... I don't know. Is it like a normal McDonald's burger? Hmm. No. Look. That is not normal burger meat. Wow. There's some special like thousand island dressing on there. You see it? Right there. And you know the burger? It seems different. Wow. I'd get this again. This is good. Wow. It's the dressing that thousand island dressing is like a burger sauce or something like that. Yeah. That's good. Alright. Figure out how to do this. Now, I've seen this online, but make shaker fries. So I'm assuming you do. You open this up. Give this cheese packet. I'm gonna give the normal fry a wrap. Got birds near me. Alright. Let's go ahead and let's throw this fries in here. And to open up these cheese. Sorry. I was interrupted by birds. That's alright. Hey, what's up my food? Alright. Let's just pile this cheese in. Now, I don't know if you can see in there. Can you see in there? Ah. These fries are all cheesy. Good. I actually think normal McDonald's fries are better. But they're good nonetheless. Yeah. I actually think just getting normal McDonald's fries is better than the cheesy ones. Traditionally. Okay. Final item here, guys. Here it is. This bun, cinnamon bun, cinnamon roll. I thought it looked a little different on the menu. Alright. Let's just try to give this shot here. Oh, man. It is so good. Oh. Oh, yeah. Oh, man. I could eat this whole thing. That could be my favorite item. Hard to say. They serve it to you at the cafe. Okay. Recap. Skip the spaghetti. Unfortunately, I'm disappointed to say this. Skip the spicy chicken, McDo. It's not good. The pepper mushroom steak was actually surprisingly really good. The mushroom sauce was really good. The crispy chicken filet, ala king. You might want to give that a shot. That actually wasn't bad. The sauce is really unique. It's almost like it has a coconut sauce on it. The burger McDo I would get again. That might be the best item here. Burger McDo is very good. Cheesy burger McDo. It has like a burger sauce on it. Sort of like thousand islands. I finished this entire cinnamon roll. So that should tell you everything you need to know. I would absolutely get this cinnamon roll again. The fries just go with normal fries. I don't know. The cheesy fries aren't that great. And am I skipping something? I think that's about it. Yeah, I think that's like everything I tried here. So overall, I don't think McDonald's Philippines is my favorite McDonald's in the world to be truthful. But it has very unique items. And if you're here traveling and you're curious, you should absolutely check it out. So thank you so much for being here. And I'll most certainly be talking to you again soon. Peace.
