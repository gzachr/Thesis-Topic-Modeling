 This is so cool! Hi everyone, Konjou, it's Ryu from Japan. And today, I got a request to a reaction video to both five trailers. So I'm really excited to check this. So please enjoy this reaction from my Japanese perspective. Please enjoy. Clay. Wow. Looks so realistic. The space. Oh my gosh. Wow. Oh my god, this looks so good. Like, like first, it came, it's from Japan actually. And the first animation was, um, was aired in Japan in the 1970s. And I have seen them before. But like, I'm amazed right now. This is so cool. I like this music, too. Both of these, both five, let's both end. This looks so good. Wow. Soon. Oh my god, this looks so good. Like, I just heard that it's gonna be back, or per se, it's in the Philippines, and it's gonna be on, um, GMA. And I'm like really curious to see, like, the official version of it. So this is a trailer, but I'm really curious to check this out. And like, I really want to see this. You know, I'm really happy at Japanese, that like, a lot of like, Japanese animation is, um, becoming popular worldwide. And it's been, um, watched from people in the Philippines, and people from all over the world. It's really, I, I don't really like this graphic. It looks like it's such a good show. So I'm really excited to check this out. Yeah. So if you guys have more videos, if you want me to check, please leave me in the comments section below. All right. And so that was my reaction.
