 Good morning everyone and how is everybody doing? You guys remember if you come to Manila, no meter no ride. Don't get in a taxi with no meter or they don't want to turn on the meter, they want to give you a set price. Remember that, no meter no ride, download, grab. Just get to grab. Simple, easy. Anyways guys, I'm going to place today. I've been wanting to come here since 2012 when I first got here. But never made it here. Just never made it. Every time I come in, come out and been down to Manila, just never made it here. So today, I've made it here. And I'm excited. Actually, we're going to go get breakfast first. Let's see where I'm going to eat. So guys, there's going to be a fun day. Alright guys, so there, here is where we're at. Like I said, I've been wanting to come here ever since I've been coming to the Philippines. Never made it down here. First time down here. This is suspense killing you. Drum roll please. Here we are, here we are. We're at the Venice Grand Canal Mall. Always wanted to come here. I figured you know what? This is a mall weekend. And this is one of the places I wanted to come. We're just going to stroll around here and show you this. I mean, this is to me as... Where else do you find malls like this? Before I go any further, I wanted to show you this. Denny's. I have a Denny's down here. Look, I just stayed breakfast there. It was good. It was good. It's great as you enter into the mall. Kind of give you an idea. Denny's Denny's Grand Slam. Mine and the brand. I had the Grand Slam breakfast. What of course had a Filipino breakfast? I put a little short out. But here it is that you walk in. Once again, this is a... It's free of charge. It doesn't cost you a penny to come in here. Let me just need. I don't know where it looked. Oh, look, filming these people. Hey. Oh. What is it? It just reduced when all these malls were left behind. I don't know what they are. That's it. Wean? I don't know what they call this. Guys, tell me what they call this. Let me know. This is what makes this place unique. Check it out. What do you call them? Dondalair Boats or whatever? They down there, boat full of people just chilling and cruising around. It's just... To me, this is just neat. Never, never, ever seen mall like this. In my 56 years of life on the Earth. So, you know, this is your ultimate selfie station here.

I have not seen one of these in the Philippines since I've been here until right now, until today. You guys ready? Somebody told me there was one down here. But I finally found it. You ready? Here we go. Pop eyes. Love that chicken from Pop eyes, right? There's a Pop eyes here. Love that. Love that. Who is the Louisiana kitchen? New Orleans Pop Eyes. Funny biscuits. I just ate. I could go crazy here eating a whole, eating a place from back home. But yes, there is eight Pop Eyes at this mall. All right, guys, so here's another one I just seen. Now I have seen this here in the Philippines in the past. I'm trying to think of where I've seen it. Maybe over at a peace on the city of the mall over there. But I did notice one here and I'm like, all right, here we go. Not a big fan of this place, but it is here. Here you go, Taco Bell. I got a Taco Bell here at the mall. They said, I'm not a big fan of Taco Bell. I'll take it or leave it. But I got a Taco Bell. Now, put it somewhere out here. She's out here somewhere. I get to find her. Not bumping to her eventually. I really have no clue where it is. Here's a gallon of layers. Down here's your little boats. Oh, my herder. Where is she at? Oh, there she is. Right, right there. Oh, my lord. You got lost. What happened? Ah. Maybe last one of these ducks. I got to work on that. You got to paddle your own duck boat. Duck boat. Guys, check them out. We're going to make them come to life. You ready? Yeah. Let's help them come to life. Alan come to life. Pretty well. I'm down below. Down below. Look at these people down here. Hey, turn the music off. Not everybody wants to hear your music. Can I see these earlier? There's a different crew. It could be a different crew. Hey, you can make them come to life. That's pretty cool. I'll come to life for you. Wow, how can I miss this selfie station? I must have walked around this thing. It is on the second floor. That's really pretty. Isn't that cool looking, guys? Definitely a selfie on both ends. And here's what. Then as you actually, you got more of these dudes. More of these guys here right now. Don't dance for you. But they don't talk. No talk. No tongue. Come on. There you go. There's the character. Minions. He's entertaining. You speak? No. You lost your tongue? Wala tongue? Wala tongue gone, man. How do you not lie up right? Look at behind them too. These little things that make this mall this unique. All right, here's the gondola ride ticket booth. 400 pesos per person. 400 pesos per person. And then swambo, it's the rent that is 250 per person. Well, I think we may be just scrapping the gondola ride. It's 400 per person, minimum of four people. So if I pay for me and look and two invisible people, well, that is 1600 pesos. And 8,600 pesos. Nice. That's for sure. Now I'm at the outside port. Here, now it's like port area here. There's your pigeons. See food out in there in the corner. I can say this is probably really pretty. All lit up at night. Really neat. Now pigeons I have seen here in the Philippines. On a rare, I mean rare, when I mean rare, one time. I've seen a couple of seagulls. Look for some, what a little bag of feed. It's just like what do I do? They tell me they're handing, they all jumped up on her. That's funny. So you can, dude, it's got a little setup going on here. Look on them for 20 pesos for a little thing of feeding. There you go. Okay, there you go. It's Brian's story. Wow, you have different color. Why is this always like black? Is it thick, right? Not really. Are you sure? It's thick. Oh my hand. Yeah. Oh my God, they're so cool. That's my first time, oh, dude. Thank you guys. Wow. You gotta be fast soon, huh? Oh, you? Oh, yeah. Oh, you still want more? You still want more? Hang on, hang on. You want more? Oh my God, you're, oops. Oops, oops. Wow. The little nails are sharp. Yeah, it is. All right, guys. Okay, bye. Bye. Bye. Go. Bye. We've got them all here. We got them all here.

I didn't cover maybe, I may be covered one through about half of this place. It's just, it's mall upon, mall upon store upon. There's a nice little shot right here, the little gondaleer. Like I said, 400 pesos per person, minimum of four people. It's like, no, I want to go out with just me and wood. Get out there and get on this thing and enjoy it. It's like, no, I'm not cheap, Charlie. I'm not all vacation. I'm just enjoying my time down here. It's 800, so five pay for both of us. Or five pay for four seats at 1600 pesos. That's a little over $30, you know what? That's a meal. I'm not going to buy it. Neat, neat though. They need to get a two person boat for the couples that come down and want to be romantic, right? It's a little month, it's better half of it. It's really, really hot, buddy, buddy hot. You can see the bottom, too. There's no fish in here. Alright, look, I think, you know what? I think I'm just gonna wind this, wrap this one up. Just gonna wrap this one up. It's been a fun day. Fun morning. I don't know what time it is. But like, look, and I were mulled out. The mulled out, but this was definitely one of the balls I did want to check out. In the Philippines, always been on the list of balls to check out. Like I said, came down here in 2012 and didn't check out this mall. Always wanted to. So, here we are. We're doing a mall. A mall, what do you call it? A mall rally. Down here this weekend. Alright guys, I hope you enjoyed our little getaway. We sure had a good time. Thanks for all you guys that subscribed. Thanks for all you guys to leave the comments below.
