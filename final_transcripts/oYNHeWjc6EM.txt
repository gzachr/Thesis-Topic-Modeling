 Future Friday. Differently. Have you been naughty or have you been nice? Well, regardless. I'm about to cleanse you, yeah? But about to cleanse you because the Philippines, Madrigal thinkers, a back ladies and gentlemen, wonder of a bloat. They're back. They're back. I have no idea where that was going. I was like, I'm to be a carpio. The quiet master. Huh? Yeah. I got a carpio. The quiet master. Yeah, he's great. He's great. We've been sent this video. Or sacrum convivium. Is it like a... Ah, it's horrible. I love better. And much better and actually not even close to that. And I think everyone just left now because I sang. I promise this is going to be good. Well, we don't know. I know they're good, but... Traditional text. Gian Polo. Well, I told you, I promised you this was going to be good. Look at that. I swear, listening to them must be equivalent to going to church. Oh, yeah. My granny always asks us, like, she drops the text, have you been to church lately? And I'm like, eh, no, but I've heard this. And she's like, wow, wonderful. Yeah. It's so good. Madrigal singers and grandmother approved. Yeah. Lola approved. Lola approved. That's right. Oh, that was really difficult. What an intro. I'm so happy they exist. I'm happy you are in heaven. I'm happy you are in heaven. I'm so happy you are in heaven. Oh, there are tenors. Oh, and the bass is this the melody. Oh, that's the song is this the song. Oh, that's the song. Oh, that's the song. Oh, that's the song. Oh, that's the song. Oh, wow. Dude, I would adore for them to, like, do the sound score. God. I don't know why they have to do, like, the music score of, like, moving the Philippines or all over the world. Like, imagine in tune, like, they're doing tune. I was going to say, you know, you know, like, in a battle scene when... You know, like, it would be funny. It would be so cool. It would be so cool. It would be so cool. It would be so cool. You know, you have to admit that movie is very strange. It's very strange. My desert. My erotic. It is a kind of... Yeah, it is Han Zimmer. So it is always awesome. Han Zimmer, please, please, look at these guys, man. I don't know Han Zimmer. We don't know anybody. I think that would be probably like me. I think it seems a bit too, like, you know, music. He's about to be a pain in the ass, isn't it? Because he's like, too, too smart. I think he's, I think he's like Jacob Collier. Like, one of those people that are so genius in their own ways that all of the other things just kind of like, huh, don't bother them at all, you know? Or perhaps. Or perhaps. Or perhaps you sort of say something to him, right? It's like, oh, see, chord major. And then he goes, no. See, chord major on a discant on the seventh. Plus two. You're like, what? Why not Pythagoras theorem? You're like, what? I'm just smart. I'm just, I'm not. I just proceed to Milton, his presence. Yeah, listen, I do, I do have to say though, it would be epic to like have like one of like this Latin songs. Like, it's a lesson. Yeah, it's a lesson. Like one of look those, you know, medieval movies or like, you know, the Viking, the last kingdom. And then you have one of like those epic battles, everything is done. And they're all that you have left is despair and brokenness. And then you have this like absolutely epicness, soft, high lifting spirit, choir. And like, what? Or, or, or, like, you know, do you remember their devil? For Netflix. Netflix. Yes. I get so excited, right? Because I love this guy. This is so cool. And there's not that much music that can elicit that sort of emotions out of you. And if you think, wow, this, we are such a spectacle in this microcosmers. And this universe, it just keeps flowing and time is ever going. And your life is somewhat insignificant. But there is so much power out there and you can do things. You can touch people. They ask you how you doing it. You look so fine. I mean, you listen to the magical singers. And then I don't know. I feel like my brain. I feel like, what do you call this thing? Your third eye. Third eye. That's it. It just been opened. I can see. You're awake in deresionality. Yeah, I can see. Okay. The truth now. And the truth is that they run back. You remember, you remember Daredevil, that Netflix thing? Yes. Because he was joined by a war with Catholicism, yes. Yeah, with religion. They would be great. They would be great. Now I must say, mate, if Marvel comes to you now and they say, oh, we'll love to do that. Because we're doing Daredevil again. Now get off you suck. No, yeah, because Marvel's garbage now. They're partaking. Imagine that credit. I charged them. I was like, what? I was like, what? I was like, what? I was like, what? Imagine that credit. I charged them big time. Big time, Anna Koffee. Come on. Let's sing, let's go. Let's sing, let's go. Shall we go? Wow. Oh my God. So, Brenna's breath, girls. He's still going. That's so crazy, dude. Oh my God. Oh my God. What a beautiful accident.
