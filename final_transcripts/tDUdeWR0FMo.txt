 Hi everyone and welcome once again to my channel it's your boy Louis and today we have a very exciting video because I am gonna be trying for the very first time some of the Filipinos snacks that are very very popular here in the Philippines. But if you have been watching my channel for the past few weeks you know that I am currently in the Philippines and because I have been on a strict diet I didn't really get to try as many snacks as I wanted. So today I asked one of my friends to go and get me a few snacks from the store. I don't know what he got me so I'm just gonna be trying them on camera and giving you my opinion. I should be my friend is right here so he's gonna be handing me some of this snacks as we go. So if you enjoyed this video please go ahead and leave a like on this video. Don't forget to subscribe as well and be part of the conversation in the comments section down below. Let me know what do you think about my comments about this snacks and what should I try next. Alright so I will see you right after the intro. Okay so we are ready to start Richard. Take it away give me the first snack that we're gonna be trying which is going to be okay piatos. This is sour cream and onion flavor potato chips so this is like very typical. I think that in America probably the closest thing I imagine might be like lace. I have never tried the sour cream one though because it's kind of like it's usually not my cup of tea. Let's be open to eating give it a try. The most common one. Okay by the way you guys if you're wondering why we have this small version this is because we're trying a bunch but also as I said I'm still gonna die it so I cannot eat everything. Richard is gonna eat some and then we're gonna probably get to like some friends or something but I'm just gonna be trying that. Okay so this is the sour cream and onion. Okay let's give it a try. The crunch is real. Wait long. Oh wow wait line actually it's not what I expected. I don't know maybe because sour cream when I think of that I mean I'm Latino so in Latin America overall sour cream is very popular with our dishes but in Cuba we don't eat very similar to them so we don't eat sour cream at all. So when I think of sour cream is very like I don't know it has more of like a sour I mean sour taste but this is more like onion and yeah salty. Mmm and the crunch. Oh my god please take it away before I eat it all. By the way I have my water here so that the flavors don't get mixed. Don't be judging okay I have the yogurt bottle. Sustainability you have to reuse and reduce single use of plastic so I'm just gonna pour myself some water and then I think we can move on to the next one. Just going to be. Exactly a prawn crackers. Okay so this is oh you see wait long we actually didn't show the previous one can I just I'll show it to the camera just but the people who are not familiar so this is the first one we tried. This is called piatos. Okay so piatos alright and this one is always sheet which is prawn crackers. This one I have no idea what to expect. Oh this has shrimp. Yeah. That has to eat. That's one of the comments. Oh shit. That is like the number one typical. Okay so I can already see the chili so this is gonna be spicy for sure and it has a big shrimp in front which I don't eat shrimp I don't eat seafood fish at all but we're gonna do it for the sake of the shrimp. Okay so we'll see probably I will not like it because of this shrimp but actually it's not that I don't like shrimp it's just it's kind of like it's a preference I don't want I prefer not to have oh my god I can't see that. Oh wow. Alright here we go this is. This is very prawny. It smells like shrimp. Oh Jesus. Okay Lord be with me. The prawns. How is it? It's actually good. Wait no I'm analyzing this. It's actually good. Wait. Oh the shrimp just hit me up. Okay this one is actually it's okay. The thing is it tastes a lot like the chili so it's just like the spice and I love spicy food. The shrimp is not really very overwhelming but there comes a time when you can feel it in the back. So if you don't like seafood or shrimp and such this might not be for you but it's actually good. I just wouldn't think you know oh you know what I feel like coming today some oishi maybe not but it's alright it's alright how much do I rate this out of five actually out of ten. Let's do the first one so for this one I'm gonna give it actually a nine out of ten it was really really good. This one I'm gonna go for a six out of ten just because it's just okay for me. So that's the second one. Let's go next one. The favorite one. Yes. Of everyone. It's related with the street food here. Wait long I need to have my lip balm to look magang down the way. Okay let's go. There's one. One chicken skin. One. Oh my god. You really have like chicken skin as next. Yeah. It's like real chicken skin or? No. Okay but this is the one one chicken skin. But there's like spices on it. Okay so it's a crackling chip with chicken skin flavor so it's not like chicken skin is just it's like a chip okay okay. Sige. Oh for you. Lord I'm looking at the calories in this. I need to hit the chicken right after this video. But anyways let's go for it. I love chicken skin actually so. First of all let's just go for the smell. Wait wait. Okay. I think it doesn't really smell that. Jimang one. No it doesn't smell like chicken skin actually that's what I was thinking. So the smell is not there. Let's take a look at the flavor. This has the chicken meat vibe. What the? What? Yo. You cannot tell me this is not chicken skin. You cannot tell me. Whoa. Wait even if you look at the cracker it's so like thin it looks like weightlamp. Focus on me camera camera. Anyways you can see it here is super thin and when you eat it. It just tastes and feels like chicken skin. Maybe a healthier version because there's not as much fat. Yeah. Never mind the calories. Lord Jesus. Here's like the old time eating. Wait how much do I rate this out of 10? I'll give it at 8.5. Yeah. Just because I'm just taking some points because it doesn't smell like chicken skin but it tastes like chicken skin. They cool to better in that sense. Let's one. Okay it's another potato kit actually. This one is like the let's say original. Original because it's literally a potato being cut. Okay so this is like a common type of potato shit. This is called it's just potato chips classic. It's actually from Dika. Bika. Oh Dika. If you're a pageant fan more precisely. Miss Universe Philippines fan you know what Dika stands for. Hello. Alright so the taste is like almost the same right next to you with the lace. Okay. Same. Thanks very flavor as lace. Well this one says it's barbecue flavored. So lace is usually just like oil and salt. So let's see what potato chips have to offer. This is coming from Jack and Jill. Let's open it here. Let's open open open open. It doesn't smell like much. It's just kind of normal for potato chips. And this is what it looks like. Here we go. Wait. I'm not sure if it's just me but I don't feel any flavor at all. It's like it's very mutual. Some restaurants would actually put that on the side of the stand. Oh yeah. Just as a snack. Yeah. And it took a couple of really so much. I mean it's not really family ever. It's okay but here's the thing right. As I said before I'm gonna die it so I'm already not eating a lot of snacks. And even when I'm not gonna die it. I'm not the person who is going to have like snacks cravings. I'm not gonna be like, oh you know what I feel like eating today? Some snacks. So if by any chance I feel like actually eating snacks. I wouldn't go for something like this because it's just so neutral. Like I want to, if I'm actually gonna eat snacks, I want the flavor. I want the experience. I want the smell and the cracking and all of it. The crunchiness and this is giving me. She's not that girl. She's not that girl. So potato chips. I want to give it a five out of 10 just because you gave me. Nothing new. You give me a bit of more healthier version. Healthier version. I like healthier. Come on. Come through with the health. Not really bread but really tasty. And has a lot of cheese and onion flavor as well. Okay. So, okay. So this is going to be the bread pan. Same brand as Oishi. Okay. So this is savory toasted bread. Cheese and onion flavor. Yeah. It's pretty much the same with the piatos. Same. And no added MSG. So, I mean I love cheese and I love onions. So far, no complaints. Let me look at the calories. Lord, I'm mercy. The calories are next level but it's okay. You said this is like healthier. So what is healthier about this? No, I'm this way. No, I'm this way. No, I'm this way. Whoa. Okay. See again. Let's give it a try. Yeah. So this is butter. Mmm. I'm not sure I can open this. Mmm. Let me try to open it. Wait a minute. I'm getting some help over here. Just be my normal self. Diva like. Challet. Okay. Whoa. You open it all the way. Okay. So this is bread pan. Cheese and onion flavor. Let's go for it. Skiber a try. It's so cute. It's like mini baguettes cut in like pieces. It's so tiny. Just look at it next to my face. Mmm. Chocolate. Mmm. Chocolate. Mmm. Chocolate. Mmm. It's actually different than this one. It's a lot of chocolate. Mmm. Wait. Mmm. Wait. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Wow. It's so good. Mmm. I really like it because the texture already compared to most of the snacks is different. I mean, this is literally bread. But it's like a really toasted dry bread. I don't know if you guys can see it or the camera. The camera wasn't want to focus. She just wants to focus on me. Focus on me. Focus. Challet. Anyways, the bread is really toasted. It's very crunchy. But it's thick. You know, it's not like the thin layers of the potato chips. Now, I will say this. As a fan of cheese and onion, I would really like it for the flavor to be stronger. It's like, okay, like there's a hit in the background, you know, of the cheese and the onion. But it's not as strong as I would like it. So I think that maybe out of 10, I'm going to give it an eight. Eight. Eight. Mmm. I will. Okay. There is the all-time favorite. I'm pretty sure every of Challet's comment, thinking of people would always have this. Okay. So this is like a Filipino favorite for the kids. All-time. Mmm. Is this super crun. Super crun. She's flavor is the best. Okay. For the... Okay. So I see some corn. So this is like corn chips. Yeah. I'm guessing that it's almost the same with the redeeming. Okay. Super crun. Oh, well, it even says all-time favorite here. So just think as you had it out. Okay. So let's get into it. Let's give it a try. Every time I try to open these things from the back, I'm just like... What I get to see is the calories, so it's reminding me you should not be doing this. Oh my god. Just try what I get. Wait a minute. Mmm. We'll try it. Mmm. Mmm. Okay. Here we go. Officially. Oh no, you open it from the bottom. Yeah. Like anyways, you saw the package. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. That's good. This smells like cheese. This is the intensity of cheese that I like. And this is what it looks like. You know, orange. Just like I like my cheese. Radioactive and full of chemicals. To maximize the flavor. Oh. It's neat. Mmm. Mmm. Wait. Just listen to the crunch of this. Listen guys. Listen. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. I like it. The cheese flavor reminds me a lot of like Cheetos in America. I like it because it's very much like the same powdery feeling on top of the chip. But the flavor of the chip itself is very different from everything else because this is clearly not potato chips. This is made out of corn. Mmm. So. So so good. Oh. Like I want to keep on eating. But actually, why this is a classic. It's just so like crunchy, flavorful. And kids usually love anything cheese to make itself. Very good. I swear everyone has a memory of that. Mmm. Okay, so how much do I rate this out of 10? Mmm. I think that's 10 out of 10. I'm gonna give it a nine. Okay. There's something. It's delicious. I mean, it's delicious, but it's quite simple. It's corn and cheese. You know, it's very straight to the point. But I'm not mad at it because it does what it's supposed to do. But you know, I would like a little bit more. Anyways, so if I have one, two, three, four, five, six snacks that we already tried, how many do we have left? We still have two. Two more? We have dessert actually. We have dessert. dessert? Okay. So we have two more to try. Oh, actually, three. Three more. Okay, three more. All right. Next one is? Almost the same with the point chips. This is like the old ten favorite, but older ones, like typical mom or a doll, a doll of yours with. No, no. Okay. So this is? Nagaya. Nagaya? Nagaya? Original cracker nuts. Oh, so this is nuts. Yeah, it has nuts. Okay. Focus camera. Okay. So we are going from pretty much chips. Wait, my camera is not focusing. Just like the typical flu time that they call. So we are going from potato chips to corn chips and now nuts. Well, I'm known for liking a good nut. Just kidding. Just kidding. Taro plung. Okay. All right. So this is? I mean, it smells like nuts. Yeah, but it's really salty actually. It's really salty actually, but it's salty. You can see it's like really big nuts though. It's not like your average. That's what you do not look at any of your... Vinegar. Yeah. Wow. Is there actually like really, really big? If you guys look at the size of it, I don't know. It's because of the coating. Probably. Ah, it has a coating. Yeah, that's the coating. Okay. The crunchy thing that it gives it. But what do they put for the coating? It's just like flour. It's seasoning. It's just like butter flavor. Okay. All right. Butter. So here we go. Yeah. I'm curious. Oh, wow. Mmm. You know what this reminds me of? This reminds me of Cuba. We would always have this... Okay. Like peanut is probably our most common snack in Cuba. Like you can just buy it from everywhere. People go in the streets and they sell it. But we have this sort of peanut that they call it with like sugar. So it tastes like really sweet but still like very peanut influence. If you know what I'm saying, it's giving me this. It's not exactly the same flavor. Oh. Because I think there's butter in here. But you know the crunchiness and just feel like there's something on top of the peanut. Mmm. So good. Mmm. Wow. I love this. It's also good. Can I give it a... 8.9? Wow. Yeah. Wait. I want to have some more. Give it a try. It's too hot. No. Here you go. Let's go. That's what it's saying. It's actually difficult once also but the old time here. Everyone. Okay. One chicharon. One chicharon. Oh. Wow. That's actually really good. Chicharon. Mmm. I mean who doesn't know? It's a good chicharon. It's like a vegan type of chicharon. Vegan? Yeah. How come vegan? Because it's not really made out of pork. What is it made out of? It's like a star. Is it the same thing as the previous one where it's like the chicken? Yeah. Okay. So it's like a chip with chicharon flavor. Oh. Okay. Well, I'm going to say it. Before I get into this, my expectation is really high. Because Cubans are a little chon. That's like our traditional meal. Okay. That's like an event. So chicharon for us is like a holy thing. You don't mess with chicharon. Sacred. Sacred. Yes. And what I noticed is like pretty much everywhere in the world. I first saw this in Canada. They have this version of the chicharon which is like very crunchy and very like airy in a way. For us, chicharon is supposed to be like the skin of the pig. Deep fried, thick, hard and with meat. That's how chicharon. But everywhere in the world it seems like it's a different type of one. Yeah. Anyways. Let's get into this one. What's the hurry for us this? Jiman. Manhuang. Manhuang. Manhuang. Manhuang, chicharon. Let's go. Let's go. Don't let me down now. Manhuang, chicharon. Don't disappoint me. Okay. Here we go. Same as the one before. It has no smell. It doesn't smell like chicharon at all. That's a favorite. It looks like a normal chicharon. Same as the previous one. I mean, actually same brand and everything. Is it same brand? Yeah. It's the same brand. Wow. How do they get this flavor? It's so accurate. Uh-oh. All right. Mmm. Oh my god. You know what's crazy about it? If you're eating the version of the chicharon that I was telling you about the juicy and thick and full of fat and meat. When you chew on it, you have like all of the fat coming out of the skin. And you can feel that. But this is a chip. But you know chips, when you're eating them and they kind of like melt in your mouth. So it gives you the same vibe. So although it's not like real skin, I feel like I'm actually chewing on a chicharon. Yeah. Mmm. Oh my god. Okay. I'm going to say out of all of these snacks, there is really not a lot in this package. As then, I only took like two or three bites and it's already like almost empty. I think I need to stop with this one. Oh my god. Mmm. Now let's move on. Mmm. What do you mean, enjoy the moment? Mmm. My food weren't hard. It's all happy. Mmm. Okay. Last one. Let's move on our brownies. Brown super delights. Brownies brown super delights. Super delights. This is like typical Filipino. They would put that in and dessert and eat it. Mmm. You can be playful with that. There's a lot of things in it. Wow. Well, it does look amazing. So super delights. Brownies. These are traditional Filipino brownies. Come on camera focus on me. For every... Yeah. These are like... Alright, traditional Filipino brownies for everyday use. Real chocolate chips. I wonder if the rest is also real. Alright. Let's take a look at the calories. Okay. I'm just ignorant. I'm just pretend like it's not there. Oh. So we have our... Mmm. Let's melt just hit me. It's very cheap. It smells like brownies, but it doesn't smell like... Freshly cooked brownies. You feel like there's chocolate, but it's been there for a while. It's been there for a while. Okay. Let's give it a chance. This is what it looks like. It's really just like a square. What kind of like a rectangle should I say? Very powdery and quite soft. Some would actually put that in the oven and microwave it for a while. That's a fascinating thing. It tastes... Mmm. Chewy. Wow. I can really feel how... If you put this in the microwave or the oven... Some would pair it up with ice cream. And the ice cream or even milk. Yeah. Mmm. This will be so good. Give me strength. Mmm. Nothing else. Wait, no. This is... What I like is... It's not extremely chewy. Some brownies can be. When it sticks to the top of your mouth or it gets in your feet. You cannot remove it. This is not that. It's very light. But at the same time, you still feel the chocolate. You still feel... I can really feel the different ingredients coming together to make this. But yes, I think that if you put this in the oven, if you put it in the microwave, even it will definitely elevate the experience for you. Yes. One last one. Oh my god. The next thing you know you have to burn like 5,000 dollars. I'm going to the gym after this. I'm going to the gym after this. So, wait a minute. Oh. I just realized I didn't rate the previous knock. So, this one is as clearly a 9.5 out of 10 for me. So, love it. This... I'm going to give it a 8.5 out of 10. If you put it in the microwave, it goes automatically to a 9. Alright. Do we have anything else? That's it. That's it. Maybe some things are very easy. David Ulaans. David Ulaans. I think we should actually go to like a car in the rear and try like freshly made dishes. I know actually someone who can just go for it. Let's do that. Anyways, let me pick maybe three favorites. I will say definitely this. Most definitely this. Chicharon. Home run. I can 100% see why this is one of the favorites. This is the super crunch. So, so good. In the third one. I think I'm going to go with the chicken skin. So, out of my three favorites, two of them come from monk one. Is that how you say? Yeah, monk one. Man one. Chicharon. And chicken skin. So, you guys let me know in the comments which one is your favorite? What do you like the most? And what should I try next? Thank you for watching.
