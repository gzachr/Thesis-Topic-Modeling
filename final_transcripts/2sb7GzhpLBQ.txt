 My biggest frustration here as a foreign chef, it's not the quality of the cuisine. Philippine cuisine is amazing. Everybody is saying it is amazing. What is not amazing about Philippine cuisine, especially here in the Philippines, is how bad the quality of actual ingredients is. And what I'm talking about is everything is from a factory. Getting fresh vegetables is next to impossible in this country. Like you go into the supermarket and my god, unsaid, nong nonga vegetable selection, everything is all rotting, low quality. And on the streets, it's just as bad. Like you go out for a street food and everything is put on carbs. Cubs on carbs on carbs.
