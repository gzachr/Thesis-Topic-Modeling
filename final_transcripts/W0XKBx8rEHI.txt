 And punta naman tayo sa dessert guys ay anong tainagletchiflan. Okay, ladies. So, those are letchiflan. And I think that's a thing that we adapted on Spain long time ago. Phanag mistaken. We're gonna try this letchiflan. Kind of scared to be honest, because I don't like flanag. I love flanag. It doesn't like flanag. Come on, it doesn't like flanag. Oh my, and she scared that chocolate flanag. She scared the flanag. But she does not scare them. Take this for me. It's not my favorite. But I think if I like flanag, I would really like it. I just don't like flanag. You don't like pork blood, yeah. I like pork blood. It's a no for me, but if you're a flan connoisseur, you should love this. Because it's good for flanag. Yeah. This just looks like flanag. Like flanag. You're not going to do it. It's very creamy. Very sweet. It's thicker than like the Mexican fondue mischew. It's like almost like a custard, but obviously not frozen. That's like a nine. Hey, so I'm a flan lover. Like flan fanatic. It's literally so iconic. So you got high standards. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. Got high standards. So, ready? Oh. Yeah, that looks good. Wow. It's definitely a llama creamier than a miso, but I really like it like this. What do you think? What do you think miso fondue can add? It doesn't taste like flanag. It tastes like flanag. It tastes like flanag. It's a miso fondue. No, it's really good. It is thicker than what. Maybe she put a hint of lemon in there. I feel like it tastes like a citrus. Yeah, it's a citrus. I'm not going to lie. Maybe more. I'm more concerned with the pork blood. So it's like the mixture is a little. It's a little odd, but the flan itself is really good. Just questioning my heart. I mean, yeah, maybe it would be better with the fork, but yeah. Yeah. Should I get a cream fork? Yeah, let's cover with pork blood. That's why it's actually good. Nine and ten. Good. We'll go. I think I've had something like this before. Lichy flan. Yeah. Yeah, it's basically the same thing. Yeah, exact same thing. It's pretty good. It's really thick. Yeah, it's thick, but it's almost like creamy too. Yeah, that's a mix of milk, egg, sugar, and it's steamed. So it's the same thing. Yeah. Like sous vide or just steam. Water. Yeah, hot water. Like above hot water. Oh yeah. Wait, what's the like the liquid? It's the sugar, like nothing sugar. What do you say to the Filipino? I didn't know if I was going to like the consistency, but it's really not that bad. I have, but I still not like flan. It's really consistency, but it tastes actually like this. And I think this, I like this consistency more than the, what was the one with the coconut on top? Cochinta? Yeah. You like that better? I like this one more. Yeah. Yeah. But I think I, I wouldn't rate this 10 out of 10, but I would rate this like an 8 out of 10. Okay. It's still good. Okay. You know, it's like a bit, so I know the 10. Yeah, that's good. We also have the chocolate flan, which is chocolate cake on top, and then I want that bottom. No way. The flan at the top, chocolate cake at the bottom. So it's too late? Yeah, so they're flan. I think my sister don't like it for it, but I think they make the flan for it. They do it separately, and they leave it like, like, yeah, it's stuck. Well, I know what that is. You know what that is? I want to try that so bad. It's not the, um, one of the, it's the egg. It's the bad guys. Guys, he will talk to me in the one, huh, Do know Gur kalay named
