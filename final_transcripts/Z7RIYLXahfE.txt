 reacting to your comments on your cheap hair in the Philippines. Ta-a. I dig Kev's style. Are you sure you should be reading this? Well, you could read it. Tisha and Flip Flops. Don't actually wear Flip Flops. Sometimes you'll see his butt cracks. Cool guy, Kev reminds me of my brother-in-law. Yeah, Kev's overall style is really generically quite the same. It's been the same for years. If we weren't in a hot country, it would be jeans, Tisha, and like some sort of slip-on shoe. And now it shorts and a Tisha and a semi-sandle slip-on shoe. Yes, Kev's Birkenstock's not Flip Flops. And the butt crack? Well, that's just for you guys.
