 I welcome the bar and I have been thinking we're bar one when we're at the stress sequence because our track is not working and we need to go to Taliban and the quickest way is to have a transportation and thanks the one who tried and we've been there's a lot of people here. We have a super garbage. It's not used to that side. Yeah. What? You don't know? Oh, it's a rubber. Okay. Okay. It's not going to work. I can't decide on the changes of people from the bar. Oh. You can go to the right. You can check over. Oh. Okay. We're going to walk. That's good. Well, we're going to walk. That's good. Well, there's him playing with that and we'll walk. That's what. That's what I got it. Yeah. That's a good idea. That's a good idea. You're right. I can ride a regular bike. It feels like the bike is floating to one side. Maybe I think it's just a track. Can you drive? Yeah. Can you ride or drive? Uh-huh. It couldn't be any worse than what you just did. That's my take on it. Hold on. I did 25 feet. So I'm working it out. I'm working it out. 25 feet. We could be there in three days. Oh. Three days to go. One, two. Three days. One, two. Three days. Three days. One, two, three. One, two. Three days. Three days. Three days. Yeah, and the app there because there's no... On the phone. Yeah. We hasn't done too many miles in this. Yeah. I mean, this is brand new. Yeah. So let's go just on the top there. He's got it. He's got it. He's gone. He feels like it. Does he know that he's supposed to take us? Yeah. He says just on the top when... Oh, on the top. Because there's a climbing mountain. He feels like the bike has been set up leaning outwards. Yeah, because we need to go to Tali-Bona as I said. And we need... No, we need... It's easy if there's a transportation. Because there is going to buy something that will bring the panic. I'm going to buy a video. I'm going to buy a video now. No, just half of it. If I know that you don't know how to drive, I'm ridding the camera. I'm ridding the camera. Yeah. If you know how to drive, we will not be on that area. You know? You know, right? You don't have to drive, right? That's right.
