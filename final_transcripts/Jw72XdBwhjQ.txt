What do you guys rate? 10 out of 10. This is a 10. This is a 10. I'm looking, I'm hoping for something that's. Is it really? Yeah, I'm hoping for something that's genuinely bad. I'm hoping for something that's like, yo guys, listen, listen. This is not anything. But everything. Oh my god, yo Christina. Oh wait, let me go on one. Yeah. Dude. I know, it makes this. Mariah. You know what I'm saying? Oh my, dude. Okay. Next. We got ribbed. Cracklings in old-fashioned salt and vinegar. I love salt and vinegar, chief. And coffee. Yeah, thank you. Look at this, man. So, okay. Not the sodium. Time to implode internally. This plain store and okay. There's nothing special about it, except now. Look at the way it looks.

Is it my bad smell, couple? Oh my god, the apricot is so good. Bro, what the hell, bro? What do I feel like I'm eating like the Doritos of another culture type thing? Like for us, this is like, this is like childhood. I feel like we're eating childhood from another country. Like, what have we missed out on? Right? A lot of pros, well, basically that we eat is like processed stuff. I know, but I'm saying like, think about it like this. For us, it was like Doritos and Cheetos, right? So these are the Doritos and Cheetos of the Philippines type stuff. You know what I mean? I'm guessing because this is insane. Bro, let me see how you're doing. Bro, that's too good. I'm a extra person. I love the textures of all of these. So light and airy. Like you don't feel like nasty eating them. Um, that one, it's like you chew into it and it's like it just, it's like air. It's like a like a nice like soft like, dude. Dude, how? How do y'all do this? What does that food have in it? For real, bro, actually, the beautiful part is I feel like a lot of people who like, enjoyed like salt and vinegar for example from Lays. This is not as strong. In a good way. It's like perfect. Ooh, it gives a nut. Do you feel a little spicy? Some reason? I feel tiny bit of spice for some reason. Right? But it's like, it's like a perfect like the best spice you could dream of. For real. I wish I was over exaggerating. I wish I was like overdo it. But dude, this is just way too good. All right. Next, potato chips, V-cut spicy barbecue flavor made from 100% real potatoes. Guys, let's smell it up. Oh, that one was easy. Ooh. Ooh. Fish ass. That one, that one smells too good, buddy. I mean, you know what smells like turtle food, like turtle food. Like, oh, turtle food. Like fish food. Yes. It smells like fish food a lot. Yeah, turtle food, bro. All right. Everybody take your piece. Don't eat it. Yes, that's how I'm down. Okay, your feet. Yeah, take one, take one. 100. Are you ready? Spaghetti-os. I'm gonna need another chip for a quick to add to it. Analyze. Well, um, kind of spicy the back of the throat, right? Okay, more savory than salty. It's like bitter. Like a bitter taste. It just tastes spicy to me. To me honest. It's the awkward taste. It's like a very awkward. Like, is it something that you eat? It's fresh tomato paste out of a can, like tomato paste. What are y'all ready? Oh, it's like a five, six. Eight? Yeah. I give it like a six. It's not bad, but it is like like, the other ones are so flavorful. And when you go down to this one, just very like, but we're just happy. I would eat this if all the other ones weren't here before it. Like, that's the only time. Okay, now, we're gonna try Chippy. This is highly requested. Just along with Cheech, I don't think God. That was incredible because a lot of recommendations for that one. Now Chippy, flavored barbecue corn chips. Just looking at it. It's spicy, I think. Another Frito Laze one. Laze. The ones that no one grabbed. Yeah. Is this a smell, too? Smell, smell. Smell got a like doggy. Oh, it kind of smelled like the other one now. Come on, God. No. Just, I think it's the corn smell. Yeah, maybe it's just corn chip, like, I don't know. All right, everyone, grab a little handful because it's kind of like a tort. It's literally like, um, Frito. Yeah, Frito. What is it called? Chippy. It's called Chippy. No, Laze. But you know they put frittos in that bag and just like, Chippy. You know Chippy. He's literally your Frito. What up? Whoa. No. Oh, it is. Hmm. Frito. It has like a good, it has a good seasoning. Two of like, when you first eat it, then after taste is 100% like Fritos. 1000%. 1000% like Fritos. But, when you first eat it, look, you guys can try it again. When you first start, the seasoning, I like it a lot actually. I think it's the seasoning I've never tried with the Fritos in World. And a good way. Their stuff is like, you wear season, but less artificial tasting. Yeah. I'm like, more natural tasting. It is good. I like it. Dude, I like that. What would you guys rate it? I have an eight. Five million. What would you rate it? Wow. It tastes like Frito. So what would you rate it? Just give you a rating. 11? Yeah. Oh, you love Fritos. Okay. Me. Eight. I'll give it an eight. Next. This one was highly recommended too. Seen this one too. Boy? Baman Kornik. Chili cheese flavor. It's really small back too. Taste your and crunchier and there's like cheese. No. The colors of their brand kind of look like Pongchang. Yeah. I can make this photo. Oh. I'm gonna get a nice tool. Why did you do it? Got your bag. Wait, I didn't taste it. I didn't taste it. What a god. I'm posing my nose. I can't smell. But just follow. Pause. Oh. So we try. Oh, I'm very cold. Wow. Very corny. Oh my. Mmm. I got literally to go. What is this thing? Right now. We have something on this too. What is it? But there are sometimes they're really hard. Like um, they are like exactly like this. I don't remember the popps or some of that. The radish. I don't know but I've had some of this here. I like these a lot. Yeah bro. Guys. This is crazy. This is probably the kind of broth. Mmm. Mmm. This is like what the students should have been. It tastes like what the freedom should have been. Honestly? 1080. What do you guys give it?oyak. You will have seven. Seven really? Get out. Now. Last but not least. Oh, you see! Ron crackers spicy flavor. I have never tried something like this in my entire life. Just looking at it. Ron, so it's like shrimp flavor with spicy. I'm excited. Let's take a whiff. Is that true? Yeah. I'm good. Oh, there it goes. Nobody has any good... I'm allergic. I'm sorry. That's why I saved it for a lot. This is a game. Let's start having a thing, guys. You don't know if he's actually allergic. Woo! You gotta find out. And not in the night. Oh my god. Gotta stank. God, Lord help me. You're gonna watch them see, okay? Yo, smell. It smells so mushy. It smells like the fish food. I remember that was like these... This is the smell of exactly the turtle snacks that I would give my like turtles. It was like little... It was like gray little poopies. And it was like... Stank. Because it's prawn. It's like fish. Take. Just do it, bro. I'm gonna stay. Ooh, when you get closer, after it's out the bag, it smells good. It smells like spicy. And that's it. When it's out the bag... That was too much. It's okay. Ready, set, and go. Mmm. Yeah, but you're okay, yeah. Mmm. Very fishy. Ooh, I don't know. I'll help you by the hour. Ooh. I kinda like it. It's like a really tangy spice. Tuna. It tastes like seafood. It's like very tuna. It tastes like... It tastes the tuna. It's just a spicy. It's like a tuna after taste. I like it. It's like a fish thing that people can watch on. It's like green. Oh, you mean in the sardines? Yeah, sardines. Sardines. Sardines. Now, that one I would probably give a four out of ten. I think like eight. There's dinner and eight. I like them. Okay, don't do that. Five. Five? I give it a five. I don't enjoy it. Okay, that's up four. It's not like... This is not for me. That ain't for me either. I mean, eight. Besides all that, it was absolutely incredible. 90% of these were good. And first of all, that little Filipino store that I did go to has so many more snacks there and things and ingredients to make. Hello, hello, like you guys have been wanting and also other foods. She was showing me around, basically telling me, oh, some of these you can make. I was like, oh, well, for this video, I want to make sure that it's just like, you know, snacks, things that are easy. Part two, we could get into the gist of it depending on how you guys like the video, etc. Now, yeah, we could do candy and also I'm asked to try Indian foods as well. And I was telling her that too and she was like, oh, they're very spicy. And I'm like, hey, I remember saying my girlfriend loves spicy. She's like, oh, that's good.
