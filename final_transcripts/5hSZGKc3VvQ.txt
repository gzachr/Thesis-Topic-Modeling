Okay, I see us. Okay. Oh, where did that come from? The intro of the song just saw so smooth. I need just, I did not expect that. You don't expect that one, no, when you just listen to this song, did you, I don't know if this is the style of rap, he does, it's my first time listening to him, but did you actually expect him to stall you off like a means從 D Okay,��요.

When you produce a song like this, how the F? I know your hate is probably watching now. When you produce a song like this, how are you going to fall, flow? How are you going to fall, bro? Let them watch. How are you going to fall? Wait a minute, what are you saying right there? Well, I got them bruised a lot. Anything is change. What are you saying right there? You are almost a loser in the battle when you are enveloped in fear Basically, you know what envelope is right? You know what envelope you close something it Basically, you are always going to be a loser in whatever battle you are facing So whatever, you are facing, you are always going to fail if you have fear If you are living in fear with something you are always not going to reach your potential of where you could possibly go because fear is holding you back You know what I am trying to say?

It's crazy. Yeah, I'm going to the end. So, I'm going to the end of the song. The song is going to be a little bit more difficult. Oh, come on! There are people who are going to sing. Oh, come on! Always label your stupid when you start chatting your shit. That's the thing. They always say you're crazy and you're stupid when you start speaking facts. That's it. The song is going to be a little bit more difficult. It's going to be a little bit more difficult when you start chatting your shit. I'm going to the end of the song. That's it. I'm going to the end of the song. It's going to be a little bit more difficult when you start chatting your shit. That's the thing. There are people who are going to sing. That's the thing.
