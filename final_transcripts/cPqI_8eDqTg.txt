 Three popular Filipino street foods you must try when you move here. Number one is Tahoe, which is this delicious snack that's usually enjoyed in the morning time. It consists of soft silky tofu and a sweet syrup made from caramelized brown sugar and saggo pearls. The Tahoe man usually walks around the neighborhood yelling, and it is so delicious. Next up is pork seasick, which is known for its bold and savory flavors. Seasick is made from chopped and finely minced pork, typically pork belly or pork head, and we're going to turn that cracked egg that came in the middle. And honestly, first bite in, my mind could not comprehend how delicious this was. Let's not forget beef pate. This delicious combination of beef stew and garlic fried rice is ultimate comfort food.
