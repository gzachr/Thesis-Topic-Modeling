 the Good morning! Another video! It's a miracle we got a sound, Shawn! It's decided today, so Jan decided to do at least the baby stuff. And a couple of my stuff too! It's Sunday and we just finished the livestream. Still a bit of a pen with the antenna. We'll work on that until we get it right. I can't spend that much money with the Starlink. I don't want to make this guy richer. It's too expensive. So anyway Let's see what we're going to do today. It depends on the boss. But I think it's going to be the Veranda. So it's Veranda to them? Or the tank? Veranda! Okay! I guess it was the Veranda so the baby can walk around and safely and we have to look after her. So I should have on a crib to walk around. Let's do that. I thought you were crawling a minute ago or you stand up now and watch your your cartoons. What's up now? You want to go down? Oh yes, I just finished the dishes. Well Jan is washing a few baby stuff. She's still there. Oh no, she's coming. Good morning guys. Second morning to Bella. Hey you! Oh mommy's going to kill you. Come here. Bella has no broken sister but she played with the doggy. Let's go boss. I give the pun one pun. Do you want? Give one pun. Okay I'm clearing things as much as possible. This Veranda so I can work and make those run hand rails. So I need to make another three. I may install this one first. So I give you an idea in the right way or what I'm doing. But first let's clear around. A little rubbish around. Okay being good as getting washed. Smell? Good actually it's a good boy. Good god dog. When people get close to the entrance he barks. He let us know. Very good. But this one here. She's hiding under the house because she doesn't want to bath. Hey you. Come on girl. We saw you. I know you hiding. Okay we used to have a scaffolding here. It's been removed but I didn't realize that this window hasn't been planted properly. So before I do anything on the Veranda, of course I want to finish that window because after that we need to go over the hand rails and all that. So I'm going to put a scaffolding just one piece of timber. I know. I'm not going to call the boy just for that job. And finish planting that window before he runs. If he runs I come back here under Veranda. Working around anyway. So let's do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. Oh this looks very delicious. This chicken yum yum and a lot of vegetable excellent. And a little Portuguese wine to finish off. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that.
