 Hey guys welcome back to another video today we're going to be trying popular Filipino snacks so we have a few drinks here and we have a bunch of chips so let's try it let's go let's try the drink yeah let's try a drink first do we just randomly pick one yeah oh snap so the first one we're going to be having is cola zesto cola okay let's go wait are you going to pour for me yeah I'll pour thank you we're gonna start with a little bit yeah start with a little because we have a bunch so okay so this is supposed to be like the same I taste a small difference it tastes more very small difference but it tastes it kind of tastes like not as sweet yeah I mean it's still sweet but it's I'm sorry to describe oh yeah I think I taste like lemon or something in it I taste something refreshing I don't think a lemon or lime or something I don't know why just it tastes like Coke yeah but almost like a lighter version like a cleaner lighter version yeah it gets harder to describe yeah it's good okay it's good you know you want to see it in the drink if it has anything in there we're fine sugar caramel color no nothing out of the ordinary interesting but it tastes good I like it yeah it's good I can't just like Coke right wait so is that like is that their Coca Cola I don't know you were I'm not sure I was asking yeah I picked it because it looks good or maybe it's just made there I'm not sure yeah I like this one yeah so we grabbed all this from a Filipino supermarket so if there's anything that's not Filipino hopefully hopefully it isn't but yeah hopefully everything that we got today is Filipino yeah do you want to try another drink or you want to try let's go with snack okay do you want me to randomly pick one yeah it's on the same bag right yeah it's all in the same bag there's a couple that we have tried oh I had this what is it teacher-owned yeah and then I don't know me man me man drawing but yeah so this is what we're gonna be trying first I think so I had this for sure and there's two variations I've never had it he's never had it so it's gonna be cool yeah do you want me to just pour some on the board yeah you're gonna like this one yeah what is it oh I don't know here you take it so like the reason I've had this because one day I was craving snacks and I just randomly walked down aisle and I saw this I was like oh looks pretty cool let me try it out right and then I had it I was like whoa the first bite is gonna it's gonna be very good so this is green peas is it green peas is it good dude the first bite is gonna shock you hmm it's flavorful like I'm telling you when I had this I was like oh my god what does it taste like kind of tastes like fritos it's actually really good fritos hmm I have reached like five oh I can eat like five oh yeah yeah hmm that's really good so good I don't I don't think I've had anything I taste like that hmm that's unique this is my coke okay all right another snap because we only have how many more do we have we only have five drinks total yeah so we have one we have four more so we'll just space them all between you know all the snacks that we're keeping on the side we'll go back to it after yeah finish it we'll probably pick like our top three years of yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah good so next one is clover it's just just a chip so this is a unique corn snack hmm so what flavor is it cheese cheese here so we've never had this yeah I don't know like it also has a pops on the bottom yeah oh ready oh oh you're on the downside you're reminding me of something but I don't know what not too cheesy as you know kind of there's more like real cheese taste rather than the cheetos it's like so artificial it's so funny I'm trying to like figure out how to describe the flavor by the so unique I don't know yeah mm-hmm I'm actually pretty surprised like this is um it's not like it's not heavy yeah very clean I think I like the the cheater all more than this yeah because I want so flavorful which will be like chit-chorong yeah I like both but chit-chorong is my go-to now one more and then we'll go do a drink sure oh what's this ding dong ding dong real garlic so this is a garlic flavor mix nuts oh I don't want it I'm scared of anything what's perforated oh yeah no I don't but I usually like the open it like to open it from the middle oh this one I don't want to roll it everywhere oh it's a lot better oh my god there you go ah okay good I got it all right so probably can't just put out oh no it's I love mixed nuts hmm I think I've had this one I was a kid mm-hmm yeah remember remember the peas so things like I don't really taste garlic I don't really do you do mm-hmm really yep it's good so chit-chorong for me though mm-hmm I think so far out of the like all of them are good obviously but out of the three this is my least yeah yeah your least favorite but still good what I snap on it yeah that's very nostalgic for me like I yeah actually remember yeah oh comes all right drink drink yeah mm-hmm so this is the pure papo juice so it's just fine papo juice I wonder if it's gonna taste like jolly we use my apple juice for for you this time there's no fizz right thank you okay what was the seafood city yeah right yeah dude everything was so cheap there like it was crazy yeah the price was good yeah super clean yeah I don't know if any of you are in Toronto but super clean um stop is good like everything was full like shelter at full the produce department look amazing bakery yeah yeah like the bakery stuff oh we gotta try that one day yeah cheers right pineapple juice he's exactly what yours yeah is it like jolly bees no no is it yeah maybe a little less sweet mm-hmm yeah but let us know if you guys like this then we'll do yeah like a big good one or like a dessert one yeah just trying different stuff yeah it's fun for us too yeah I love trying new stuff which drink if you have to pick one it's so different yeah I think the coke coke is good yeah coke coke I wonder if there's a diet version of it I don't think I saw yeah yeah all right it's not next it's gonna be hard to get that sweet look this reminds me of uh what's it she what's that chips we have wringles wringles yeah yeah I love wringles roll a colster I still eat them I still eat them I buy those uh party mix snacks as if from home to eat up the yeah yeah there's a lot of them inside so ready oh we always try to run away from me mm-hmm the flavors are less very subtle very light which is nice if you like that mm-hmm mm-hmm what flavor though just cheese right like nacho cheese or something cheddar cheese cheddar cheese is even lighter than clover mm-hmm here take this like what's your go-to chip let me come here just regularly do you just leave this for me okay I like my party mix mm-hmm I like Doritos spicy Doritos the roulette I don't know if you had that no but basically it's Doritos spicy Doritos but it's like randomly spicy so no yeah so like only a couple of chips are hot really so as you're eating you're like oh it's light it's like you eat once like grab this spicy yeah it's like a roulette one that's pretty good yeah uh another one yeah my go-to is probably ruffles all dressed or honestly that's so popular and lace ketchup yeah I have this so this is the prawn crackers I definitely had this so I think so we've had obviously different brands um but I have I have had this specific brand but it's a spicier version oh okay okay yeah but not this one mm-hmm so you have the spicy variant of this yeah yeah I feel like someone just tested it like you can't open oh what's good whoa okay hold on hold on hold on so the ones I've had mm-hmm not this brand but the ones that I eat usually the original the flavor like the flavor is completely different not like initially this is strong like it's really good a seasoning is like or whatever they use is good godly they actually shocked me that's good ah dude like it's really good what did they add on it like like you don't think it's different from the ones we have like the flavor is crazy initially it's a little more yeah yeah it's no this is good I like this the one I used to have it's a little more airy I think yeah I think I like this one more yeah yeah mm-hmm not good so I'm at the top for sure I will rank that second well what we've had well we'll revisit it yeah we'll revisit yeah okay so one more chip yeah nice equally looking just so that I don't hold on I have to stuff back just grab that it's okay mangoes I love these mangoes yeah so funny thing is I don't eat this ever what I've never had dry man those every time you offer me always like really I want it so you know you always offer me when you open those those green ones uh the green bags yeah oh I just pulled out like here are they that good they're they are so good all right ready yeah pretty sweet yeah I don't know if it's uh because all the chips I had the result is not good it's so good and like I've Walmart and stuff like a pack of this is maybe five bucks at the uh how much is it at the store we want to it's like a dollar 50 no way yeah they had a pineapple one of this with 69 cents crazy cheap you yeah I really taste as long mango flavor though I taste sugar no but not really a strong mango flavor for me oh good I like fresh mangoes I love mangoes as a fruit but my dry ones are okay break it but I'm gonna dry try drink try drink yeah oh almost not going off ooh pamello fruit soda so this is made with real fruit juice I see no taste I'll taste it to you guys so this is fizzy right I like so it looks good so now this is gonna taste like pineapple and pork okay let me smell it first smells like um so I always drink these carbonated water so I've one with the like a pamelloe grapefruit flavor smells like that hmm that's really good that's really good I mean pamello sometimes it's like it's kind of bitter yeah yeah this is really good I can see you mixing this with sprite hmm let's say so good yeah hmm I think you're gonna mix that with alcohol yeah yeah possibly well I like that I think that's my favorite so far from the drinks I think so too that was really good yeah thanks I feel something hard oh I've had this when I was a kid too stickle yeah it's like wafers yeah I had where's the here we are I've had the um one flavor I don't know if it's strawberry I don't think I've strawberry before so usually for me I avoid strawberry oh really yeah this is artificial tasting it yeah exactly so let's see how this is I love artificial strawberry really yeah it's like the meditator you just like to give her fun okay oh how come there is a oh I think so it's so it's easy to yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so there's one in a wrapper right okay yeah two in a wrapper because there's so filled in there yeah didn't want you to break it so you just yeah you won't be able to get it out unless you that's pretty smart okay I'm not waiting for you okay that's good that's good I think I've had the ube flavor too that's really good hmm let me just help you take this off and I was a kid I used to like pretend this was like a cigarette yeah no you're kid there's no fake cigarette candies it's like a little pop one yeah yeah yeah I think so good when should start you can stop I hate these because it's so good so addictive hmm no more okay okay okay no thanks but you don't like strawberry no so I avoided because it's artificial tasting also it's kind of like I just feel like it's very basic but this is pretty good I don't mind this no I feel it take the makeup that's really good chippy this looks familiar kind of like the other panels like cheaper home no actually no what's the other thing like freedom yeah freedom yeah looks exactly like we did yeah yeah by the colors different corn chips right hmm hmm kind of taste like it hmm what's all this snack I don't remember any any of the names what's that snack that you put on your finger ring those no no no no no no no the oh bugles bugles so it kind of tastes like that hmm also the fritos hmm right mm-hmm hmm it's funny you know all the names of all the snacks that's how much you eat well you give me that those movies try trick me to eat hmm not bad but not my favorite yeah not not in my top three but it's still really good I actually have to put that strawberry stick into my stickles in my top three yeah on the drink sure as you got two more drinks four seasons this is just the a mixed fruit um oranges apple mango and what is this the fruit is that I don't know it's like guava or something yeah there's guava oh smart okay so apparently you have to shake it it says oh yeah we didn't shake the pan produce oh all right ready let's go oh cool interesting kind of looks like that other drink the pamelloan yeah so all's good so smells like that grapefruit or pamello hmm hmm it's not nearly as sweet as I thought it would be mm-hmm yeah which is good it's refreshing yeah actually that's better than the pineapple than just the pineapple I don't know if it's better but I think it's just because the pineapple is so it's so normal right so but yeah I like this one that's actually really good all right how do you want me to have can I secretly look yeah open up oh you want to hold on that's a lot okay ready hmm I already saw this one so okay said monster cheese curls yeah cheese cheese curls challenge challenge a lot of their smart if you go their sizes are like you manageable no they're not huge well this is huge yeah but then like this you know what I love about this compared to this like oh yeah yeah American American snacks are like huge yeah but you're not supposed to be eating dying what city yeah but we do anyways yeah I know totally do all right here I love how they fillers with a cloth oh yeah yeah like it's oh yeah that's one that trips a half is like half empty yeah all right so it doesn't get destroyed sure I'm shaping hmm super light subtle cheese taste yeah do you know the um the cheetos yeah but the fluffy ones yeah no the one in a blue package but they're like kind of like whiteish yellowish but they're like super scary are they spirals or something it's not spiral it's like weird it's kind of like a branch almost oh no it's the taste like this what yeah I just like my regular cheetos yeah you love cheetos hmm this is nice though I like this small small bites yeah okay good if that had like a spicy version yeah all right one more wow oh what is this chocolate chocolate now it's chopped up yeah peanut peanut milk chocolate I like peanuts that's some drinks yeah which one do you want give me that vanilla one actually thirsty you want some no can I have the yeah I just take it oh and you're really back yeah oh that's so sick that's really I thought it was long I thought it'd be like your kick hat well there's a lot hey like look oh crap all right like chocolate I like sweets but I don't eat a lot of sweets hmm oh my god oops hmm is this soft whoa it just disappeared do that's good that's really good dude it's like nothing I've ever had before kind of tastes like it's like a piece of chocolate that just disappears into the dinner yeah I think they literally mix like the peanut and chocolate together hmm I thought it'd be like glass sets almost except in like a bar form dude it feels like it's so good it feels like they tried it all and it just pressed it together dude it's so good yeah this oh what's that what I thought was oh nevermind I was this it's like my my god is that that's kind of surprise dude this is good super good I think that's the only thing we've been saying like it's everything is good delicious yeah I'm not very descriptive descriptive with my word you know if we like something we just eat it hmm hmm 24 pieces it says 24 pieces like eight pieces yeah no way more than that hmm all right hmm could I look at the mixture of value 70s were packed the hump no but the what 70 calories per one oh no way what's this eight grams right that's a lot oh we've been to that since I know I want to see how much sugar that has oh is that sweet oh well that's one oh my god where nine that's one nine grams yeah nine grams the sugar for one we'll get sugar high all right so I'm two more two more and one drink oh something spicy so this is the boy the the corner what is it is it corn what is it real garlic chips wait there you go because this oh it's gonna go okay hold on we should just remind me of the or not yeah yeah yeah what's the corn yeah it's fried corn so fluffy oh gosh there's a little piece of garlic there I'd hate to go like for this one that's good hmm hmm these are these are better than normal corners because you actually chew through them some corners yeah so hard yeah that piece of garlic there these are dangerous man that's probably it's not garlic no these are dangerous man you can just keep eating them yeah you could take these with you wow you got to

pretty strong yeah it not tastes like one of those Asian drinks that I had before it tastes like black licorice which I it tastes like you know I don't know if you guys heard before but it's like a hay song but it's a root beer it's like the Taiwanese root beer hmm but it's in TNT yeah this when you put it up to your nose like this it's like black licorice but then when you drink it it's
