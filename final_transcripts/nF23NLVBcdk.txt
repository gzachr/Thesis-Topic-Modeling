 The morning, 11 October, 2022, 9.47 am. We just got off the we're here, obviously, the land. We just got off the phone with the guy, the gentleman that was digging our well force. And they're not coming back until he said maybe Friday because they say there's a typhoon coming so they need to harvest their rice. So what I told Lady Jazz just now is I have a number to another guy because I'm done with people just put me off. They didn't even call us and tell us. We got the call and they say hey, where are you guys at? So anyway, we're going to try another individual to see if he's available this week. If he can come before Friday, if he is, we'll just go with him and we'll finish out. And just go from there. We're trying to move things along here. And I don't have time for people who put us off and then don't even call us and let us know. You know, life goes on. I go forward with it without you. So we're here at the house, for minutes back today, the rebar is not yet. We're going to find out what's going on with that. The plumbers here, that's why we wanted the guy to have the well dug so the plumbers can do what he needs to do. So, but the gentleman is coming over to talk to the plummer about some other stuff. So we'll see. The story continues, adventure is upon us every day and every way. What can happen will happen always. What will happen? Yes, always happen. So we're going to deal with it and go forward. Lady Jazz has got her a bite to eat, some rice. What'd you call it yesterday? Woodwood. Woodwood. And stuff. Woodwood with the baby. So, okay. We're going to go get an update and I'll add on to this. Thank you. The pairing, huh? Get ready to put it up. The metal pairing, getting ready to measure it and ready to put it up here and put the gypsum board in after that, I guess. Got the tiles replaced. Get back to the door. That's going to be covered with the toilet. They'll probably move that up a little bit. They'll be the toilet. Go over here. You know what? Jage uses in here. Hello, James. Are you following the Seheat yet? Seheat? Oh, okay. It's for the floor. Let's get ready to bring this in and make a short the floor. So we can lay down the prepping it for the tile work. We got one coat of skim coat on. We've got the boards in, the nice switches up. This is the front bedroom. So I believe I've told you earlier that we're not going to use this for a car port. It's going to be just an extended porch area. So the lady that's here can ask the view there. That's Koehya Jimmy, the well guy coming. So we'll see. Well, the lady J has top crown. Let me pause it here. Up here, he's got the floor tiles in. He's got the rough texture on it. See, so there's no slippage. Got the wall tiles in place. Probably the next thing will be the metal fearing up here in the gypsum board. And one light, yeah. Going to the light switch. So it's looking good actually. I like this tile wall tile. I don't know why we did buy the other floor tiles with the same rough texture. I kind of like that, but it's okay. It's not going to be much slippage. It's not going to be much water in the floor. At least in the master bedroom. All the shower is going to be water. It's going to be contained in the jacuzzi. Okay, I'm just going to tag his own to another video. It's just enough. Just tedious stuff takes a while to get what they're doing. So it's not going to look like a major super, super progress. There is progress, but it's just not like a lot of things I've seen. Oh, I said that and then look over there. Got the jacuzzi here, set here. Got one of the toilets sitting here. And there's one. And there's one. And they'll do it here. Right here. So Arthur, the plumber is working. That's good. They're moving quick. They just got here today. Little changes here. Yeah, this is going to have something here. We've got enough room. Then here room here. Which is good. It's sink there. Boom. And the shower thing is going to go here. We're going to mount it up for the shower. And then we're going to be styling their profile. Yes. Hello again. We're back in the truck as you can see. We just, we're done with another quick house check update. Former Jesse's back. We bar is not back yet. He's got a access to so maybe a couple days when he comes back to work. But the team, but the rest of the team is here. And they're making progress as you can see from the previous video. Not major, but just minor stuff and every little bit, everything they're doing is just closer and closer to be in reaching the end. What I have here is the plumber Arthur. He's here. So he gave us a big long list of fittings and stuff. And stuff that he needs to finish his job here. He's planning on being here for three days total. And to get all this stuff done. Koya Jimmy, the well guy. He was here and he was talking with Arthur. And they talked about what needs to be done once the world's done and the piping and getting everything connected. We've got to make another run down the will con. We've got to pick up a hot water heater for the master bedroom. It's going to be minor on the outside. So Arthur the plumber can do this thing with that as well. Downstairs, we're just going to have one of those telephone hot showers that you just turn the water on there because if they even use it, but it's there if they want to use it, they're used to, you know, Philippines, everybody's used to the cold showers except this one. She's always taking my hot water. So anyway, we got a good sized tank. It's about half of a U.S. water tank, hot water tank size. But I don't think she's going to use it all this time. We've got to have a talk. We've got to have a talk. Anyway, so we're getting ready to hit the road. And like I said, make a trip to Wilcon in the hardware store and get these fittings. Hopefully the fittings aren't that much. And we'll go from there. Okay, guys, if there's any other changes or additions, we'll tag it on. Ciao. We're at 499 subscribers. We've won away from 500. I don't want to celebrate too prematurely because some days we lose three. Some days we gain five or six or one or zero. Guys, don't be like that. Okay, please. If you subscribe, please don't unsubscribe. It hurts. No, no. It hurts when you leave us. It's a force. Okay, guys. Alright. Ciao. Hello guys. We're here in Wilcon now. Sitting creepy. The lady speaks. Yeah, we're made it down here to Wilcon and we're trying to buy a water heater. For the upstairs, master bathroom. And we're going to a couple of out of stocks. One display only. No discount. Display, no discount. So they're just sitting here waiting and they're going to go get... I draw and play on it and know what you call it. Hang on a second. That thing. They're going to get in there and rise up. Grab one of them boxes. We're going to get this one over here. That's all we need. But that's the one that's out of stock. Because the guy went all the way up. There's two boxes. We were excited. If any picked them up, there's nothing inside. All the one of them. They're just sitting there. So we came back down and we decided. It's a 25 gallons. It's just 20. We only need it for the jacuzzi and the shower right here in the master bath. So we said, okay, we'll take this one. And so that's what we're waiting on now. We did look at some stuff down there from the US. And of course it's more pricier than these white ones here. But the one we were going to get was that smaller one. But it was only six gallons. I'm like, nope. That's not enough. I don't think. Yeah, maybe Lady Jazz for about five minutes. And then it's going to do back to codes. Anyway, we're here at Wilcon. We went to Blue Hardware and FYY Hardware in San Antonio. And we picked up everything but two items on that long list. On the yellow page I showed you earlier in this video. So on the way back, we're going to stop by Northwest Hardware, which is next to McDonald's. And hopefully we'll get the last two items. The Arthur De Flummer needs. And then we'll go forward. So this bad boy is going to be... They're going to put it upstairs on the outside. So they're probably going to have to build some kind of platform board to sit on. And then we're going to have to build a little shed house around it. Shed SHED house around it to protect it from the weather. We're going to have to drill a hole in the wall because obviously it's got to be plugged in. Unless Coriord oil, the electrician decides to run an electrical outlet outside. One of those all weather ones there and then we'll just run it somewhere. But that's to be determined. We'll check that out later. Right now, okay. They snuck a fast one on me. They went and got the big boy. And they're going up there. There he is. Yeah, he got it. He's over there. Yeah. He went and got the big boy. So now he's coming down with it. Yeah, that's the force that's there. Okay, cool. Alright folks. Thanks for joining us. Ciao. Yeah, you get it already so we can check. Check, check and recheck. Yup. How you like it? I like it. You can't send any. I don't know. Check and recheck. We're not going to kill him. We're going to kill him. That's the big boy. That's the big boy. Oh my god. Excuse me. Well, there's 100 liters, right? 20 gallons. 20 gallons. Yeah, it's a little stiff. I think that's enough. Uh-huh. I'm going to say. He's teasing the guys. He has them that's healthy. Of course, it's healthy. He's teasing the guys. He's teasing the guys. He's teasing the guys. He's teasing the guys. That's the fittings, right? Then this is the... ...the one that I'm going to use. Okay. This is the one that I'm going to use. So, I know the plan. Oh, no more Mac though for two weeks because you bought that one. Huh? No more Mac though. Okay. Okay. Okay. No more Mac though. No more Mac though. Okay. Okay. I gave a chair that... ...we sit there earlier. What is that? The... ...clean? What do you call bed at? I don't know. What's the reason why? I don't know. Really? You're going to take a selfie in the mirror? No, it's not a selfie. It's a video. And too small. I'm going to put it on the floor. Good afternoon. 3pm exactly on the dot. We're here in Subik. We're at Northwest Hardware Depot Core. At 209 National Highway. Subik, some of us. This is it. It's a black building here. Lady Jazz is over there because we got stuff in the back. I have to keep an eye on here in the truck. And she's been there about five to ten minutes. So that's... ...could be a good sign. Means they're getting the stuff. I think it's only like two items she said. Could be four. Could be five. I don't know. Sometimes the count is like the Filipino down. It's just way different. Secret. Secret. I'm in trouble. She's going to review this. I don't know what I think. I believe. I didn't see her go anywhere else. So we're just sitting here. And once we get this, we're going to go back to the property. And I'll see if there's anything that's made your progress. It's been done that I can put on the video. Okay guys. All right. The way of Fertinand is working fast. So earlier in the day, look at that. We're calling the flash. Just see over here. Okay. I thought he was going to put the whole floor in and then do that. No. He's doing that first. That's cool. Well, the Jess is doing the metal curing. There's measurements. Actually started putting something in over there. I'm going to wall there. That's good. I have somebody doing something back here. By all of you. Doing a skim coat. I might have done enough to screw this in there. And just there. I'm going to do that for a moment. You know, when I get on the video, I just my mind goes blank. I can't remember what I'm talking about. Here we go. We've got the gypsum board all the way up. About a purring. And the gypsum board's up here. That's good. Next, I guess we'll do the polymer ortho becoming in here. We talked to a former Jesse about putting a separation between the shower and the rest of the bathroom. We want to do about maybe six inches high. A little mini knowledge. A little water. A little shower curtain. A little water over there where it belongs. This is the other item. There wasn't two items. There was a bunch items that I guess left them achieved. I think a total of what we spent for a polymer ortho. The materials today was 13,000 pieces. This is... Oh, you can do the one. 58.5. I can do it. See if I can sleep by real quick. Excuse me. I can't wait to step again. Right here. You can get over here. You don't have the bottom here. You're younger and younger. Okay, all right. See the guys are here with the windows frames. Here. Oh, wow. It's going up. The doors are going up. Wow. We're going to expect them to chill tomorrow, but this is great. The rain has dried over here. The fog is... ...and it's going to fall over there. The rain... ...and the noise it goes with the... Oh, got the bathroom door going too. Okay. Oh, yeah. See? Oh, what? Oh, what? Oh, it's going to fall over there. Oh, there he is. Oh, there he is. Oh, I got the stuff there. All right. Let's do it. Okay. Okay, I'm at the outside CR. They started to... ...they got the toilet down. Looks like... ...with the... ...posset. I hope they're just waiting to do this. I hope there's an issue with that. Here. They started to get the faucet there. Looks like... ...and the... ...and the... ...and the... ...and the... Right now he's in the master CR. Working on the shower. So, I hope there's an issue with this. We'll see. Right now, Lady Jazz. She seems to think that we ordered white doors, white aluminum doors for the bathrooms. I don't know. I kind of left that up to her. I'm not sure I don't remember. And they're installing brown ones, but we'll see. And the wood panel finishing is on the screen doors. So, we'll see. And then she says she ordered the mirrors on the bathroom doors. So, we'll see. I don't know. We've gone through so many changes. I personally don't recollect. So, I told her I said I'm leaving that up to you. You can call Christina at the... ...at the... ...aluminum glass aluminum store. And you guys can talk about it. Seriously, honestly, I don't recall. The carabou over there. You can be going... ...and this style here right now, because as you can hear, it's noisy inside. So, this will probably be the last of the video today. And there's something exciting pops up. All right, folks. Thank you. Okay. Well, we completed our to-do list. And now we need something else. Hopefully, well, it's almost four o'clock. So, hopefully, maybe we can just get it tomorrow. We'll find out. First, my... Bayal J said W-clips. It's got to be something to do with the metal purring. And we'll see. He's going to go get some more clarification. I'll get Lady Jazz over here to explain. And we'll see. Every time we come here, there's something. Haha. Something new to procure it. All right, folks. It's a no-cap, I didn't even plan to do it. Okay, here it is. The W-clip. I guess we need like 50 pieces of this. Do you need it? Nayon or Bukas? Okay. I see no. Good-bye, Abbey. Okay. It's not hot. Man, it is humid. Back in the truck, yeah. So, we got 50 of those W-clips for the metal purring. I think it came out to like 438 basins. Or rather, J jumped in the tricycle and went to the hardware store. And we went inside. We were doing this the last clip before this one you're viewing. So, we brought that back. And the brown bathroom doors is fine. We kind of both don't remember. We've been to so many stores, so many orders and stuff. Because it matches the windows, the sliding doors and the window frames. So, that's fine. We'll see about downstairs if she puts in a white bathroom door downstairs. And I'll jump to her. We're also going to not put the mirrors on the bathroom door. We thought about it. But we're going to put it actually. One head to foot mirror in the harrow walk-in closet. Had a later date now right now. But at some point, so you know, ladies like to check out what they're wearing. You know, front and back, sideways, full-files. Talk to the bottom. Well, it's just those stuff on. And backwards and upside down, inside out. And you know, we'll go to the ladies to hate. But, um, so, also more on the outside CR. We have all the fittings, but they don't fit. There's not much more fittings, don't fit. So, the plumber hunter, hunter to plumber, he's making less of other things that we need. Also, the faucets we bought for the master bedroom, the nice gold ones, and later jazz liked. There are two shorts. We bought the bowl sinks. And even the rectangular sinks that we liked before, they're basically too wide for the counter. There are two tall. So we have to go back tomorrow. See if we can do an exchange or not. One package is open, one is not. And then get some with the higher, with the actual, the faucets of higher. Get the bowl right into the sink. So, you know, more to do. Got a love, build, and home, anywhere. Um, I think that's about it. Uh, just, this is every day. Something new or something doesn't work right. Something doesn't fit, you know, it's just this light. And the home build process. So, especially when we're doing all the procurements and everything. Like, we are now and everything. So, we've got it in there. It's fun, but it's tiring for her. Not really for me. My own illustrations is the communications gap. And sure, it takes a while to get to it. Oh, this is what you mean. So, we'll work it through that though. It's kind of perfectly understandable when there's a language barrier, culture barrier. We'll put out in here in the language barrier. So, we'll get through it. We'll work it our way and then just get into it. Okay. I think this is going to be the last one. Ciao. Please like, subscribe, share, and comment. It helps us out. It helps us grow. We appreciate it. Appreciate you guys tuning in, watching. And follow another adventure. Ciao.
