So yeah, this dude is love of my life. Beautiful song by Freddie Mercury cover. Looks very raw, filmed with a phone. I caught the first few seconds. I have kind of heard a little bit of it. And so let's see what it's all about. I'm trying to make my reactions a little bit faster so I can get more done. And so I will be talking over the video.

Again, I know I actually do a lot of videos about Filipino music, but I generally think there's some amazing vocalists out there from the Philippines because I have a lot of time that I've spent with Filipino people and enjoyed the music, enjoyed the love that they have the music and for performing. So yeah, that's why I'm always doing Filipino music. But yeah, wow, what a voice. Yeah, if you know any more from this guy, please send it to me and I'd like to see it. So I'm going to say goodbye.
