 Peace! Okay, I jammed it a good cleaner up on the room and move things around and make it look nicer. So, for those who haven't seen before, this is our room and this is my working station. Okay. Okay. Can you stop and put this one? Okay, today we got to the hospital. I'm going to get a small surgery, remove the ulcer, behind my left ear and then if you follow those walls, you can do some work on the house. I'll show you the time. Okay. Okay, after a quick lunch we're here at the hospital. I jammed feeling some paperwork. There be with us. I had to buy this before coming here. I had a special antibacterial cream or something and some wire to stitches, I guess. I'm not sure. 2000 pesos for that. 2000 pesos for that. I can't go in unless the girl tell you to go in. Hello baby. Hello baby. Hello. Daddy here don't worry. Small world. That's my friend. He just here, my friend from Facebook. He was talking to French in French to me and he was wondering why I didn't recognize him with a mask. I have to do a swipe test. I have to do a swipe test. I have to do a swipe test. I have to do a swipe test. I had it. I'm glad it's done. Thank you. Hey, you go sleep. Can you film this? I'm going to get done. I'm going to get done. It's only a lot of surgery so it should be fine. Keep smiling. I have to talk to her. I'm going to say your remover. I can show my life too. That's what I'll do. I'm going to get done. I'm going to get done. I'm very full of sleep. I'm waiting for me. I'm going to get done. I'm going to get done. I think I need a cup of the rest. I'm going to get done. I'm going to get done. I'm going to get done. I'm going to get done. I'm going to get done. I'm going to get done. Can I get done? Yes. I'm going to get done. I'm going to get done. I'm going to get done.

I'm going to get done. I'm going to get done. I think a lot of people have said that the porch is probably the best area to relax. I think it is. You want to grab the tail. I feel okay. I just wanted to tell you how much all this costs. I analyzed that sample that they remove. We bought a medical kit for 2000 pesos. The other one was a special anti-viral liquid that they put on a syringe and injected in the wound. Probably to kill whatever battery was left there. The surgeon charged me 7000 pesos and the hospital charged me 943 pesos. Total 943 pesos. I put the equivalent on a US dollar on the screen. I'm the rich but I think it's cheap. If I'm an American or a Western world, if I have to do this in Australia, there will be already a 5 or 600 dollar from a credit card before entering the hospital. I want to see the money back or only half of it. I don't know how much it will cost. I know it's only a minor thing but probably a thousand dollars. I think it will be probably at least 5 times more. I want to show you how much it will cost to analyze the whole thing they remove from here. It looks a little bit of bacon. Anyway, it's in the fridge. Anyway, we'll bring that on Tuesday. Monday I have a rest here at stay home. Probably take this off and be very careful with it. No dust, no dirt. But then Tuesday we go do a little shopping so we have to bring that thing to the hospital to be analyzed. Let's try that beautiful delicious thing that jam is done. How we call this? Taron. Taron? Wow, this is completely different to Spain. I'm going to give a bite and I'm going to tell you if it's delicious or if it's yak. It will be flavor. Oh, ok, let's have a look. Still very hot. Very nice. Smell nice, I put vanilla. Was the vanilla? You forgot? I put. Yes, it smells nice. I like it. Yes, it smells nice. I like it. Yes, it smells nice. Yes. Very nice. I cracked my own like. That's why I picked her. All right guys. It's a twisty now. Chica. You love it? Hello you. What have you been? She's still got those things on the skin. Skin is red everywhere. What can we do? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. She's heavy. She's heavy. Yeah, she's getting very heavy actually. She hit well. Oh, she got a big thing here. No, no, no, no. Leave it. Yeah. I'm eating. Yeah, I think the poach is the best place to relax. Oh, it's coming off. It's coming off. Maybe I have to add some more. Very epoxy. Sorry. You want me to hold it for tonight? Tomorrow is going to go. You know, it's better to take care of it, better then whatever, and leave it in the fresh air. Then cover it. See if I give you a bit of a sun on top of it, it's probably better. No. Oh yeah. Anyway. Chica. Chica. Chica, Chica, miss you.
