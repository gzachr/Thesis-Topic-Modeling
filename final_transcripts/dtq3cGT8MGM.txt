 This is so gorgeous. Give it a skin. Give it a skin. Reps the lotion on the skin or get the hose again. Yo, what is good? My BGA Coru, or whatever. Welcome back to my channel. So you guys, this has been a highly requested and anticipated video of whatever. Today we are going to be eating Jolly Bees, y'all are Jolly Bees. Y'all we got this restaurant, I think in 2020, like end of 2019 I believe, and I have not hit it up until today. So let's go ahead and get started because I am stu-waw-vin. If you want to know more about me, now I know what I am doing. If you want to know more about me, now I know what I am doing. I believe, Father, please bless this food. The hands I prepared it, provide for those that are going without. Heal, protect, and provide for my BGA Coru, and your precious name I pray. Amen. Alright, you guys. So let's go ahead and start taking some bites. And I'll tell you along the way what we got here. Oh, okay, so this is their spaghetti. I've been hearing like a 50-50 from people, some people say it's disgusting, other people say it's delicious. But everyone agrees that it is sweet. I've never had sweet spaghetti, so you guys, you don't even understand. Like let me take a couple bites and I'll talk to you later now. Right now I don't want to talk to nobody. Don't even look at me. Now I'm just kidding. I'm that hungry. Mmmmm. Okay. Jolly P. Oh man. I'll see you. Okay. Hold on. Hold on, honey. Hold on, honey. We're not coming for another bite. Mmmmm. Mmmmm. Mmmmm. Mmmmm. Mmmmm. Mmmmm. Mmmmm. Mmmmm. Mmmmm. Mmmmm. Mmmmm. It has chunks of hot dog in it. And it's a little sweet. Not how I pictured. I pictured it like a sweet sloppy Joe from elementary school. Yeah. This is not that. That is good. Right here I ended up getting something called their beef or their burger patties. It has like gravy and mushrooms, a side of mashed potatoes and gravy. And then there are double rice. So someone was telling me put a little bit of the gravy on top of the double rice. And let's try it. Oh my god. Mmmmm. And right here I have my extra hot crystals hot sauce. Yo. Oh my gosh. Why do I know this is going to be heavenly? Why do I know this? And this is my first time eating it. Oh. Oh man. What? Oh. Mmm. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh look at this. I'm trying to speed up. Mmm. Oh man. This reminds me of a Southbury steak. With the mushrooms, the gravy, the mashed potatoes and the beef. I'm telling you this is Southbury steak. Mmm. Oh man that rice Joe. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Another bite. I love rice. Mmm. I'm working my way to the best part. Alright. Now this right here is called Palak, Palakak. Palakok. Palakak. Palakak. Palakak. Palakak. Palakak. Palakak. Palakak. You guys have a famous pronouncing it. I apologize. But yeah, this is like a race noodle with, I don't know what kind of toppings, egg and shrimp. So let's see. What are my Filipino's at? What are my Filipino's at? Come through. Let me know what's this called Palakak. Palakak. Oh man. I know this is going to be fire. I don't know why people talk so bad about Jolly B. I had a little poll months ago. Like six months ago. And everybody was like, like a lot of people are like, you should eat Jolly B. And a lot of other people are like, no, don't eat Jolly B. It's disgusting. That's not real Filipino food. Da da da da. Honey. I wouldn't know what Filipino food is anyway, but this is bomb. Let's see. The chow-ass over here. Oh my god. Oh man. Oh. Right here. This is life. What? What? Oh. Right here. Oh. Right here. Come over here. Y'all got to try this. Look at that. Look at that. Just look at it. Just look at it. Just look at it. Just look at it. Just look at it. Right. Oh my god. Wow. Wow. Dowd. Wow. Wow. You've been a bit greedy for years.Ã¬nh incr Oh my god. It's like garlic. I can't describe my favorite garlic salty. I never had nothing like this before. Now before we get to that chicken, they have a new spicy chicken sandwich and a regular chicken sandwich. Let's try this. All right. That is juicy. All of the professional opinions in a what? Oh man, I'm so good. Wow. Can't stop McDonald's. Wow. Oh, that's spicy. Yo. This McDonald's ain't got nothing on this. Or Popeyes. Sorry. Yo. And this sandwich is a little cold and it's that good. It's a little hot. This is jolly beer. You're not going to believe. 50 minutes away from my house. So I drove 50 minutes there. 50 minutes back. Y'all do not know the type of torture that I was feeling. Smelling this food as angry as I am the whole ride home and no nibble. Wow. I'm not craving. Wow. And of course, I didn't know BGA mug bang. What I was on bank, bang on my shirt. Literally my shirt is covered in gravy. Sugar with a gravy. And that's okay. This is all worth it. Let me know. Have you tried jolly beer? Let me know in the comments below. And do y'all even got one in your state? All right. So I'm going to make sure of spicy chicken and regular chicken. Go ahead and label all other spicy pieces with this. Yes, I did heat this all up. Yes, I did put these in the air fryer. Y'all, I just want to bite into this without any gravy first. To get the like full crunch effect. I love. There's nothing better in the world that I love than a good, crunchy piece of chicken. That's why I love churches. All right. Here we go. People say this chicken is the best. The best. Wow. I love it. Wow. That is good. That is really good. I don't know why I thought it was going to be salty. Like KFC. That is outstanding chicken. Now I see what the whole house and fuss is about. Let's do this. Right here. This for all the gravy lovers. Look at that. I'm going to make sure that I don't have to eat this. I'm going to make sure that I don't have to eat this. I'm going to make sure that I don't have to eat this. I'm going to make sure that I don't have to eat this. I'm going to make sure that I don't have to eat this. Look at that. Look at that. There we go. We have a little house house. You know me and my house house. Wow. Unbelievable. That's how hungry you know I am when I just bid into the whole bone. The whole bone. Oh my, my shirt. Wow. Yeah, that's how you know I am a hungry dog. This is a double rice. This is a double rice. Reminds me of Latin food. Like, arroko gandules, arroko na dee twelas. Very Latin. Wow. Alright, let's try regular pizza chicken. Not spicy. Oh, this one right here. Come here, baby. You can come sit with me right here. Sit down, my love. Sit down. You got a penner. Yes. That's your soul gorgeous. Give it a skin. Repsel ocean on the skin or get the hose again. Y'all, I love chicken skin. Don't come for me. Repsel ocean on the skin. On the skin. I will finish it eight again. No, I gotta go down. Reps the batter on the skin. Or it's gonna get eaten again. Y'all probably like this dude that lost his mind. I sure did. I sure did. I did. Hi, my name's Luanne and I sure did. I lost my mind. Good, golly, good, Molly. We're just here eating a little bit of an bruise of salad. We're some fried chicken. Don't you know. Mm-hmm. Mm. Wow. Right now all those references are everything that I just said and did. Only my late night IG peeps are gonna understand what's going on. Everyone else is gonna be like, you know, last has my. That too. That too. Uh-huh. It's chicken so juicy. This is good chicken. Mm. All right. Now for desserts. Desserts. We got peach mingle beans. I'm gonna have to go to the next one. Now for desserts. Desserts. We got peach mingle pie. I never heard of such a thing. I never heard of peach mingle being a combination. I never heard of what I heard peach cobbler. Never mingle pie. Or peach mingle pie. Oh, good thing I ordered too. Well, I don't know if they're gonna be good. I'm just saying good thing I ordered too. Just a case they're good. I'm gonna be pissed I only ordered too. You all ready? Look at that. You know what this looks like to me? Like one of those, I don't know if it's hostess. Who on the list is like empanadas? They had like chocolate pudding, cherry. The cherry one was my favorite. That's nostalgia for me. Like, that's my childhood girl. I was a little diabetes, little dabbers. Yup, I used to tear up the low debbers, low diabetes. I don't know who's the maker but anyway, this would just remind me of the shape. I'm kind of juice. What? What? Yo, that's like a Puerto Rican empanada with a Mexican filling. No, this is like a cross between a Puerto Rican empanada and pasteles. You know how they have that flaky crust on the outside? And then the inside reminds me of a peach empanada from Mexico. Wow, I really feel like there's quite a little bit of like lacking influence in this food in a way. Like, I don't know. I could be wrong but. Mmm. Mmm. Oh my god. Filipino food. Ba. I'm sorry. I just made some McDonald's pies look like trash. Wow. Unbelievable. Mmm. Mmm. Yes, ma'am. I thought it was a tap. I don't really get mango. I get peach. Like peach cobbler. Mmm. Alright. Let a little hint of mango right there. Mmm. Wow. Mmm. Those are addicted. Mmm. Wow. Y'all. I give Jolly B 9 out of 10. 9 out of 10. A hard 9 out of 10. I'm not going to lie. I was coming in here with what everyone else has told me about Jolly B. And I was ready to give anywhere like a three from like a three or a four out of 10. I was coming with like already a premeditated like bias opinion on this because of all the negative things I heard. And this is actually scrum dittily. Scrunches. Delicious. I highly recommend it. Mmm. It was good. It just reminded me of like a little bit of a sweeter marinara sauce or like spaghetti sauce but not sweet like candy. Just like a sweet tomato-y. Like you know it's good. It wasn't sugary. Like I was like everybody explained like oh my god it's sweet spaghetti. Like sweet tomato sauce and sugar. What chopped up hot dogs. Disgusting. No, it was actually the hot dogs. It's chopped up in little bits and pieces. It's kind of reminiscent to like round beef in and away. So the spaghetti. Good. The spaghetti on itself I'll give it a seven out of ten. It wasn't bad but it wasn't like top. The whatever palaka, palo, palalak. Palakak. I don't know how to pronounce it. But anyway those noodles with the egg and the shrimp I give that a nine out of ten. That sucker was good. This right here the Southbury State, what was the beef patties, match potatoes and gravy and the rice. As a whole I give it eight out of ten. The rice ten out of ten on its own ten out of ten. Gravy ten out of ten. Chicken nine out of ten. As churches is still my favorite. No one can ever compare to the competitive churches. But this is high. Nine out of ten. Because Popeyes and KFC are beneath that. So, yep. These right here ten out of ten. This right here ten out of ten. Ten out of ten. Ten out of ten. Ten out of ten. Overall ten out of ten. Overall ten out of ten. What? What? What? What? Ten out of ten. Ten out of ten. Ten out of ten. Ten out of ten. Ten out of ten. Girl, I'm at the club. Ten out of ten. Don't fool me. Ten out of ten. Pop, pop, pop. Pop, pop. Pop, pop. Ten out of ten. Yep. Girl right now I was at a disco lights flashing at a club with a drink in the middle of the dance floor popping. And popping and lacking girl. I'm at a breath because I really imagined that I was dancing at a club. Any hoot. Any hoot. Y'all pray for me. So yeah, thank you guys so much for all of your love and support. I appreciate you guys.
