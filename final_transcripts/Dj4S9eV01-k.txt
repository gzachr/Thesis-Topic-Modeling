 I'm not gonna lie, I did not expect this. Oh, I just found this. Are you actually like, I had no clue that Matt met new. I just sit in there, I looked over and what are you trying to make? A test. A test of... A nest? You trying to think about building a nest at NEPA? Oh, let's go get it. I'm tired. I was exercising earlier. That's really amazing. This is my first time, but I've seen this. How did you come up with this just online? I saw this when I was young, but this is my first time. This is amazing. Amitabha. Well, we have to go on a mission tomorrow morning. I'm sure Matt Matt is gonna be doing something unique. So when we come back, we're gonna check up on this. Been the meantime. See you on the road. There will not be any of my last today. Sunglasses are back. I got a new pair. We're on the same road where I lost them the last time. I wore them for the first time. Got these sunglasses. Thank you, Savaisa Alan. We are having an early morning start. We're heading up and over to the bunter end today. And basically, while looking at this. We're wearing pants. Pants on the loose. Pants on the loose. Pants on the loose because some things we got to do. In the meantime, up and over the mountain road. We're going to eat. This is the province of Dava, Doro. The combo seller is a municipality. On the corner you can find Patrick's. Let's go. Let's go on. Let's go on. Let's go on. Let's go on. Let's go on. Let's go on. Let's go on. Let's go on. Let's go on. Oh, nice. Oh, Ampalae, it looked the best. And Sito. Oh, my gosh. Okay, Patrick's rules. They're coming back. It's super good here, but I'm going to go help you. Ready, Ampalae? Let's go. Let's go. And let's take. Oh. What are you thinking? Pretty much scramble eggs as well. Look at the dough. Look at the dough. Look at the dough. Look at the dough. Scrambled egg lante. Scrambled egg lante. White and dry. Yes. White and dry. White and dry. That's a bit sharp, because it needs to be dirtier. Oh! Look at the camera. It's going to be a bit late. Is it a bit late? Oh my god no way! Dude, you got to take a 50, 50, 50, 50. Sequenta, sequenta. So a couple things, okay, number one. If you get so bow, get it out of a couple with a 50 piece of billon. I think it's an extra special. Especially when it has my ease, like this. Number two, if you come to Carinduars, you can always ask them if they can cook it log. If they have it log, they usually will. That's something I like to do especially in breakfast time. I'm waiting for the eight log. Kumerskopolalo. I got some ampolaya. Life is good. We're going to head over to the Bunteran, which is the capital of Davido, oil. Because we're going to go on an LTO mission. I'll tell you more about that in a bit. Let's first see. The record guys asked to receive, hey, taking Instagram stories on the highway. Copy. What's up? Kumers, are you got the key? Yeah. You have your key? Then you have it though? Fight. All right. Welcome to the Bunteran. What's up? Kumers, are you got the key? Yeah. You have your key? Then you have it though? Fight. All right. Welcome to the LTO in the Bunteran. I need to renew my driver's license. If you didn't know on the Philippines, even if you were foreign national, you can get a driver's license as soon as you get an i-card. Even way back when I was on a tourist visa, like 2014, I think I got my first actual driver's license in the Philippines since then. I just renew it. It's been five years since my last one. So, going in to the Bunteran LTO. But remember this, you have to go online first to something called LTO Portal and make like a user name. So, that's what I did the other night. And now hopefully, I don't know, see how this happens, how this works. All right. So, it turns out to renew now there's new rules. I have to go through an educational course. So, that's what I'm going to go do. I'll see you in a bit. OK, now go. I'm going to go to my course. I'm going to go to my course. Good morning. Can you give me a license? I'm going to go to my course. Oh, my God. Thank you. This is why I wore pants and shoes because it's a dress code. I can't show you my license, but this is my old Filipino license here that's going to expire next month. So, rock and roll. You want to go to my course? Yeah. I'm going to go to my course. I'm going to go to my course. I'm going to go to my course. Guys, keys. Go! You must have been able to see this. It's a bit like this. It's a bit like a dress code. It's like a dress code. OK. One note, a copy. One note. And a means of the rules by the nation's rights and values. And the rules. Rinda, I lost. OK, so here's what happened. Basically, I've been sitting here learning from. Jira, cool. And actually, really interesting, all the finds and everything. Finding out about them, like what you have to pay and whatnot. Jira, cool. Yes. I've got to go and get a medical. They do like a break after a little while. And you go get your medical. And then we come back learning a bit more after a new exam. So, anyways, we're going to rock on. Thank you, Kuyya. I'll see you in the medical place. How are you doing? What's going on? I like your pyong, jealous. I like my jis. Oh, I guess. All right, so I'm walking about, I don't know, 400 meters down the road. I've got to get a medical. I'm going to get a medical. I'm going to get a medical. I'm going to get a medical. I'm going to get a medical. I'm going to get a medical. I'm going to get a medical. I'm going to get a medical. I'm going to get a medical. I'm going to get a medical. I'm going to get a medical. I'm going to get a medical. I'm going to get a medical. I'm going to get a medical. I'm going to get a medical. I'm going to get a medical. I'm going to get a medical. I'm going to get a medical. I'm going to get a medical. I'm going to get a medical. I'm going to get a medical.

I'm going to get a medical. I'm going to get a medical. I'm going to get a medical. Before when I read my license, you didn't actually have to do a educational course. Like a refresher. But that is something you have to do now. And it's going to take you definitely a few hours. But it is what it is. And I am just soaking up some of the interesting laws and finds and things. So that's the positive spin. I'm learning a little bit about that. But of course I'm pretty comfortable in comping with my driving capabilities and learning from Canada before. But hey, respect the system. Do the system and just have some fun along the way chatting with the locals. All right, medical. Am I fine Kumar because I'm going to get lunch break I think. So you ready? Since I forgot to have bread. Dindo. Dindo. Good night. Hello sir. What's your name? I got to go back to one of the classes. Wait a minute a bit more. Just a minute. You're going to give me a ride. That's it. Is she going to one of the other? I'll go back for the image of the mission. Do you have any other missions? I'll just walk. So there are anyways. You do missions now? All right. See you later bro. So it's been many hours already. Kumar is about to finally get his admission done on the renewal for the Red Rocket. In the meantime, I'm going to get a medical. I just got out of the medical stuff and doing a whole bunch of other forms. It takes some time to do this stuff guys. But I actually, you know, just appreciate so many people around. I've just been recognizing me and having a little chit chat and taking photos and stuff. And actually, it's making the time go by quicker. So that's cool. I've spent 700 pesos on the course that I'm doing. I've been doing a lot of things. I've been doing a lot of things. I've been doing a lot of things. I've been doing a lot of things. 700 pesos on the course that I'm doing right now. I'm going back to and 400 pesos in the medical. It's about 1,100. I've got a driver's license for a new one so far. Red choice goes in a bunch around. Still wearing shoes and pants on a hot day. Let's go learn a bit more right to test. Okay, come on, what's it? Pick a sedan? Pick up. It should be. Alright, I'm going to rate a test. I figured it might come in a pass. You know what guys? If you're going to renew your license and do the course and go to LTO, you have a chance. The bunter end is good. It's relaxed. People were cool. That was EAL driving school. That's a guy in a big truck yelling at me. That's a guy in a white truck yelling at me. I'm going to go to the LTO now and finish everything and let you know how much it costs. We'll see if Kumar is down to the truck. Power on. It took the whole day. But I got it. I got my license. We're going to a place to eat that we haven't been for a while. That we really like. Yes! I actually don't know what the 90 stands were. We got one. That's the owner. That's the owner. This is one of the places we'd love to stop in the Bunchan, just off the main road near Guy Sano. It's called Karandiri in 90. But it's like an outdoor kind of open air or Karandiriya. And they have a lot of cool plants here. This one, Kumar, you call it Fiddle? Fiddle or Fiddle? Fiddle. Fiddle? Since Fiddle. Look at all these. All of the different plants. We're actually thinking about what plants to put in my house and get to you. If you have any suggestions for plants inside, even just on the outside, let me know. The meantime, they have two unique things here. Number one. Fried Talong. Look at that, ma'am. I've never actually, it looks like a squid. Fiddle? Fried Talong. And they also have Cadjust Baboy Lanka right here. Bam. Elongo, no? Cadjust Baboy Lanka. Cadjust Baboy Lanka is Elongo, do you know? Elongo. That's an Elongo soup. I first had it in Eluillo. Look at these hanks. Look at this. I love the meat of Jackfruit Cooked. It's one of my all-time favorite stuff in the Philippines. It literally looks and feels like meat, but it's vegetarian. But... This is not vegetarian. This is the Baboy, the pork in the soup. Really nice. I didn't mention it's kind of all-in-all. It costs just under 2,000 pesos to do the driving school, of course. The medical certificate and then the real license. So you're roughly looking at that kind of range. It takes a whole day. But I've done. Palo-halo is coming. Look at this, ma'am. Tell Long. Look at the head. Fried Talong. Hmm, very good. It's a favorite ice cream, but... I think it's ruby and marapona. Hmm. Is it, I think so, no? Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. It's a favorite ice cream, but... I think it's ruby and marapona. Hmm. Is it, I think so, no? Hmm. They make a really good halobah out of here. That's why Kumar got one as well. I think it's Ube Macapuno ice cream on top, I'm not sure, but... It's just nice refreshing. The vibes here are refreshing. In fact, if I quickly walk over here... ...again, outdoor car and deer, yeah? The garden. Yeah, the garden. Check this out. Have a nice little garden here. And literally a year ago, I sat under this tree... ...and ate guavas. This is a guava tree. Guava, do you know? Yeah, there they are. It's... Saiyong, I can't... ...why I didn't steal that summer ass, but... ...anyway, I'm getting my brains to like, whoa, because I did a bunch of studying and paperwork and all sorts of things, but from the Buntraan, hello, hello. El Tio mission. Let's carry on down the road somewhere, back towards Katio. ... Victory. Sin look. Ah, a blast. If you didn't know, sin look is to sniff. There's a difference in Messiah. That's sin look. This is... ...sim hurt. Sim hurt. Sim hurt is smell. Sim look. Sniff. Did you see that? Sack to? Ten o'odh? Ten o'odh. Ten o'odh. Ten o'odh. Right, start. Ten o'odh. Ten o'odh. Ten o'odh. Ten o'odh. Ten o'odh. Ten o'odh. Ten o'odh. Ten o'odh.
