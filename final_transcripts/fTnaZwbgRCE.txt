We've had a lot of new subscribers on the channel over the last few days which is insane so if you're new welcome to the channel, thanks so much, hope you stick around, hope you enjoy the videos. Today is Sunday and in BGC that only means one thing. Supercar Sunday. But today we have a twist, we have been lucky enough using this old gorilla pod again, I haven't used this for ages. We've been lucky enough today to be invited by one of our friend Daph who is associated with this restaurant that we're going to try. He invited us for lunch today, he invited us to have a look at some cars, eat some nice food, it's Filipino food, so we're excited about that. We were out for some drink test days, I feel like Filipino food is always good after drinking. I don't know why because you can just eat loads of rice, eat some nice meat hopefully, a good sight for that, just waiting for Lucy. It's actually a restaurant coincidentally that we've been wanting to try out for a while, it's lock of ore or lock of ore, or lock of ore, comment below, help me out with the pronunciation. Just waiting for Lucy, Lucy, are you ready? Yeah. Alright, it's a restaurant we've wanted to try out for a long time. We've looked at their menu, they've got a few locations I think around but they're definitely one in BGC. We've looked at their menu a few times and we've very nearly ordered food from them, the menu looks great. We've got Filipino food, the dishes are going to be some great flavours today, we're going to show you guys the food, show you guys some cars, we're going to hopefully drink some more coffee because I'm a little bit tired this morning. So welcome to the vlog, let's get going. And how strange is that guys? Just as I was moaning about the gorilla pod, this arrives, new tripod for this camera. Don't get me wrong, we like the gorilla pod, the gorilla pod is what built our YouTube channel. We use this camera and this tripod that it's currently on for years but fancy to change. So this is the big brother of this, another tripod we use. But this one, I think it should have like, yeah, look at that, so easy to use, extendable legs and it takes a lot more weight so should be able to take the weight of this camera. Okay, new tripod, way lighter, way lighter setup, that is a good result. Okay, let's go. Good morning. Good morning. How are you? I'm good, I'm a little tired. Lucy drank a lot of wine last night, a lot. You can actually hear it in my voice and this is our breakfast today, so I'm super excited, I'm super hungry. Oh, can you hear the cars? I can. It's a nice day today, put by the tech, I'll do it today for once. Please guys, Pusel has dotted around fairly humid in the air, but again, it's a very Sunday-y, as we always say. Sunday? Sunday feel like Sunday. Wow. We thought something nice was that to come around the corner with that noise. Tens out, it's a leaf blower. That's it. That's a super car, the first super car we've seen is a leaf blower. There you go. We already got a few cars here, RS5, let's cross over here quickly, Nissan BMW, nice Z4 here. It's amazing, as the main smell that you can smell walking down this street on a Sunday is gasoline petrol. True. We're going to get you a smell, that one's swimming. Wow, it's busy man. Hopefully we're going to be there. Maybe. And this is like officially reopened. Oh look at this Aston. Let me show you this quickly guys. Look at that beauty. Even with like a lesson, paint work. Yeah. David Dobrik just bought one of those. Oh that's the same one. I think. Yeah, I think you're right. Hopefully you might see a guy called Adrian as well, who has a YouTube channel, a car YouTube channel which we've been speaking with chatting to a little bit, he said he might be down here today. So, making some new friends today? Yeah. Eating some good food, seeing some nice cars. That is a good Sunday. Lunch. You late. Beautiful Porsche over there. BMW M2. GTR. All right. Yeah, Audi, all right. Ferrari. This is Dars. Bambo, so he has arrived. Thank you. How are you doing? Good to meet you guys. I'm giving some of these masks, cars and coffee, which is the group that Darf runs. We don't know, but we have a lot of coffee. We need a car and a coffee to be in the group. Because it's breakfast for us, we're going to order off the breakfast menu I think. We may be looking at the lunch menu as well, maybe try a few different things, but as you guys know from other videos, we love Filipino breakfast. It looks amazing. It looks like a fancy Filipino breakfast. It does look really, really nice. It's a nice setting here in BGC as well. You can look out, set outdoors, really nice. You can already see it. Wait, let me just roll it down. There you go. You can see all the palm trees. And it's big like... I don't know what this is. A big structure behind us, which is always lit up at night, so it's very cool. It was explaining that the name, Lock of War, is actually a fusion. So it's locker for local and like carnival meat. So local meat, local produce, quality produce, we're excited to try. Tada! Oh, there we go. Thank you very much. Nice little menu here. We asked to see the menu. Great. Thank you. Can you make it a bit bigger? Yeah, I can't see you. Can you make it bigger? Cool, so shall we order a breakfast and then after you think so? Yeah, definitely. He does sizzling, sinigang, it's famous here. And I think, yeah, that's on board. One of those, please. Is that? In the mayo? A second, yeah, yeah. Yes, you get one of those, please. And then, do you want to go for this? You can drop these mayonnaise, nice. They recommended the tritzelog, which is like a tritzel breakfast. It's like a tritzel patty. I always try that on that menu as well. Yeah, so you try that. And one tritzelog. Charlie's on. Yes, please. On your ice. On your ice. So omelette, tritzelog, tritzelog, tritzelog, egg, rice. Right. Oh, do you have coffee? Yeah, by the way, it's already green tea. Green tea? Yeah, I have green tea. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. That's top side of it. That's hilarious. That's good service. Thank you. Nice. Enchanted river. Yeah, we're talking about traveling and it's making us sad because we can't travel. But we have a nice green tea. Yeah, they do green tea here. Too hot. I'm not going to drink here. No, don't drink here. Thank you. Nice. It looks like street food, you know. Yeah, we've got, we've got, we've got, we've got, we've got some street food here. Been a while since we had street food. We used to go to the market. So much. It's nice, Chris. We've got some sauces. It's just like a chili sauce. I'm just going to go in. You guys will probably tell me that all the sauces are wrong. Mmm. Delicious. Delicious. It's like fish and chips. Really? You'll love it. It's like fish and chips. I'm going to try the other sauces. That's like a sweet chili. What's this one? Mmm. Mmm. I want to say, it's like a sweet onion sauce. No. You're all so really like that. Stop waiting at me for a bite. I'm pointing. Let's try one of these. And the final sauce. And that looks more like a soy sauce, maybe. Oh, well, spicy. Really? Mmm. That is already good. Tuck in. Please put that stick down. Haha. Alright, so we've been treated here to absolute feast. We've got the tritzelok, which is like tritzepati omelette rice. We've got the garlic prawns, which I'm super excited about. Mike actually told us to try these. It's insane, but it's Japanese mayonnaise. And then there's a sizzling, sizzling gan. Which I've never had a sizzling. I've never had a sizzling. The presentation is just like so nice. It's so nice. You're going to try some that straight away? Yeah. Come on, come on. Now, synagogue is your favourite. Hmm. synagogue. Yeah. It's synagogue. It's synagogue. That's a special video. Nice. These guys have been helping us out with what to order. Yeah. And also trying to do British Tagalog accents as well. Which has been interesting. Yeah. Do you want to do it on the vlog? Yeah, sure. British accent. That's right, yeah. That's your Italian accent. That's your Italian accent. That's right, yeah. That's your Italian accent. All right, guys. Thank you for coming. And then trying the local war. And because they knew, Mr. Rapp and Pican Dito. All right. Love it. Very good. Sounds like British to me. Wow. So good, say. I said it being like a runny seat, but a whole tree seat. Look at that. It's probably like a big gravy consistency. See that? I'm flamed or so good. Okay, guys, I'm really curious about the... Oh! I think it is. It's still a little replay of that. That's how they like that TikTok. Oh! Oh! Oh! Hey, I tried to use this cutlery, but of course with the safety procedures. It's all covered in... Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Hey, I tried to use this cutlery, but of course with the safety procedures. It's all covered in... ...cellophane. So, then put the camera down and we'll try to get... Okay, do I go the British way with a knife and fork or the Filipino way? It's beautiful. Because this is like... They said that a lot of foreigners do come to this restaurant. So they're like a people to foreigners with the food, the menu. But they want to introduce foreigners to Filipino food. Which I think is awesome. I'm really curious. So I'm going to take some of the... Oh! Wow. It's so patty. Oh, it smells insane, guys. It's smelly, and it's well-cooked. It's got some of the... Oh, wow, it really is. Oh, there's Japanese mayo on this as well. Oh, you know it. So that's going to add an extra layer of flavour. The colors are just crazy. Alright, let's try. Oh! You didn't see that, did you? Again, it's tap and it's put. It must be here. Delicious. That tastes naughty. The mayo gives it a kind of creamy texture throughout the whole bite. So it tastes... We're a little bit hung over today, as we said in the other start. So that is the perfect breakfast. The rice, the tritzo patty is amazing, full of flavour. Mmm. We're just going in with the mayonnaise shrimps. Yes, is it garlic as well, did you say? I think so, yeah. I'm trying to peel a prawn with a spoon and fork. I think I've done it. Nice. So nice, so garlicky. I think garlic and shrimp are the perfect match. It just reminds me of boat trips, shrimp and garlic. Do you know what I mean? Like with the fish, the shrimp, the rice. Island vibes. Yeah, raw, I miss it. Just quickly guys, look at the size of this prawn. Look at it, it's heavy on the spoon. Don't drop it. That's look good. So we've been in a bit of a dessert zone in the last few days. Do you think? A little bit. Wow, that's a big one. We have the doughnuts. We had the doughnuts the Mike and Nelly gave us. We then are having more things that look like donuts. Okay, tuck in, it looks amazing. Daff, what is this one? Toron con leche. Ooh, okay, cool. Great combination. It's a great combination. Yeah, yeah. It's Toron de Spanana. Yeah, okay, cool. Thank you. I made Toron once. Yeah, she made sure. Yeah. All right. Should we call this on top? Is that Tepló? Oh, yeah. Go on then. You ready? No. Ooh, that's all of it. We'll put some sexy music on this one. Wow. I've lost my spoon. That's what that's for. That's what that's for. Wow, this looks crazy. Look at that. We've got the egg tie inside, like, lecci-san. Oh, it's water. It's water. Yeah. Wow. You see how it goes? Yeah, that's good. Wow, let's try this hard. It's so hot. It's so hot. Wow, so good. You know what? It's not, I thought, them two combined. It'd be super sweet, but it's not too sweet. It's, um, pastry is really good. It's nice and warm. Love it. Pretty a whole one. Yeah. Maybe not. Incredibly satisfied. Very full. Kind of the perfect Sunday morning here with... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Kind of the perfect Sunday morning here with... Just finished up eating or incredible before, incredible satisfied. Highly recommend you guys coming here if you can. If you can, you can order online. They've got five different restaurants you can try them out. We're also now lucky enough. That's going to take us for a spin. In the Lambo, I'm very excited. Oh, take it. You can't beat that. Yeah. I'm beating on this nightfall. You're small and too around.
