So for you, how do you feel having your boyfriend in the Philippines? I'm so so happy that he's finally here. So I think he gets to experience your... Yeah, but there's a lot of shock cultures still there's not everything that's okay. For example, the heat. When he came out of the airport, he never experienced like the humidity.

What was your first impression of the Philippines? The traffic, obviously. That's what everyone says probably. Yeah, it was the traffic, it was really busy. I only stay around here, so I didn't get into the city, like deep into the city. So I cannot tell you know how it is down there. But as far as this area, it's busy. It's nice, so... Passai, yeah.

Apart from Sabu? Not nowhere else. It's Manila. You should try to visit a lot of places. Passes nice here. And my last question is, which track Philippines in one word? To me, now is the basketball. So I describe it as a basketball country, and it is a basketball country. So I'm really happy to be here, like take part in this event. And just because I'm here at the moment during the World Championship, it's all about the basketball to me, Philippines. But obviously, a lot of people with this, really everything. But as far as, as far as, it's like now, it's the basketball. On the scale of one to ten, what will you rate the country right now? Oh, oh. Oh, it's hard to get it. I'm rated.

And, my hotel is also in the Philippines. And we're in the native here. The top of the roads. Okay, the floor. The last floor. So what floor is the right? The top. And we're trying to show you with the roof over here. We're going to find the food ready for next. And then we're going to go to the Philippines. So you're here with your family? Yes. My sister's family. Well, what's your impression about the Philippines? Yes. And it's a great country. It's a country that... That's... It is beautiful. Yes. No, there are a lot of people in the Philippines. There are a lot of people in the Philippines. There are a lot of parking lots. Lots of cars. To the sea, but... And we started to... So what are the cultural shows you experience? We are from Greece, right? And this is Philippines. Is there any difference? It's not the Philippines. It's the Philippines. The Philippines. The Philippines. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. If you want to... Great Philippines on the scale of 110. What could you do with the Philippines? And... And you would... Wow! 9.5. Someone's been living there. So you live in tomorrow, right? So what are you going to do? What are you going to tell your friends? When you get back to this? Around the Philippines. I will tell them to do the later... The animal to prevent the growth. I will tell them about the vast two games that we will have. Did you contribute a look? And today I feel... You will win today. Okay, good luck to you and you. All right. Is that happy you on my channel? It's really great. As a young person that traveled from his country to the Philippines. And he has a lot of things to say. The nature, the art, the explore, Boracay, different islands. That's a lot. Kutos to experience. Sacka new corn into the channel. This is a lot because we allowed in song to explore Philippines. Just in 10 days, the travel around the world is a lot of money spent. Just why it's so to be happy and I'm grateful for that. What do you have to say about the greatest periods? The greatest periods. Or as you know, the most important kids. It's 9.5. I hope you come back again. Of course. This is really great. So many islands. So we have time to go to the next vlog. It's a lot. Yeah, yeah. And also it's great. Yeah, yeah. Thank you so much. Thank you. Yeah, bye. My name is Dani. So I'm here with... Matthew, having a show. From the beta tailgate. Okay, so you've been here for... In the Philippines for a while. I've been here for 10 days. I'll be here another 5 days. Really? Yeah. Has been here. I've been here for 10 days. It's been fantastic. I've gotten to see some of the world's greatest basketball and basketball world cup. I've gotten to talk to a lot of locals. I've been out of Filipino. And I've even gotten to interview some NBA legends that I've been listening to. What did you post your show? You know, I think... It's been surprising to see how nice the Philippines are. Like, you know what you hear? You hear the English stories, but they're genuinely like over... Over-Sipamedic from my experience. You know, I'm used to Americans not giving a shit about anyone. And these people here, you know, just walking on the street, whether I'm a foreigner, might be because of that. But everyone wants to say hello. Everyone is just very, very complimentary. And it's been really nice. But you know, people are basically pretty too for country. What can you see about that? Yeah. You know, like every country, there's both best-to-goat worlds. You know, you can definitely go to the richer areas. But it's driving through the Philippines through the streets. You can go to see a lot of poverty. And you know, it's tough to really accept your lies coming from America. You know, I've never had to worry about my fat water. I've never had to worry about what I'm going to eat for my next meal. And it's a sad truth around the world that a lot of countries do suffer of poverty. And you know, I can't do anything about it, definitely. And all I can really do is understand around a few of the empathy and, you know, try to, you know, be sympathetic to my neighbor. So even though I'm fortunate to see you in the Philippines, you do that. I'm not expecting to live here for any longer. I love to come back. I love my Filipino friends. And I definitely want to continue to show love through Latin Filipinas. But if you're going to describe Philippines in one world, what do you expect from it? Passionate. They love love love basketball. They love human connection. Everyone wants to talk. And I think passion is the three words of the story. My last question is, did you try to get to the Philippines? Yes, I tried Lichon Kowali, Beef Kappa, and I didn't get to try the egg that, but what's called balot, balot. I didn't get to try balot. It looks a little scary to me, but I was told that I have to do it. But maybe you will see it. Okay. Nice to have you. I know. It's also a YouTuber, right? Yes. I got my YouTube, but be the tailgate. I got my personal Instagram, Matthew, Evan Shaw, much love. Thank you. So guys, this brings me to the end of my video. I was able to talk to few foreigners, and they share their experience with me. They all said good things about the Philippines. They will come back again. So this brings me to the end. And I will catch you guys in my next one. Bye for now.
