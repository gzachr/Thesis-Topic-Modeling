 Hello everyone, I'm about to pick up someone very very special that we have never met before. No joke, joke long. We actually met her like a couple of days ago. Oh my God, you are blonde! Just for wandering, so it was very quick. And now we actually gonna go to the night market here in Makati in Manila to the Asia Bazaar. And then we're gonna eat some amazing. The beautiful food. Let's go and pick her up. Mano! Welcome! Thank you so much! That's so cute. How are you? So Mano changed her clothes because she just came from Baguio, was very cold there but now it's hot. It's so hot. I know people in country. So now we're gonna give Mano something exciting to try something from Germany this time. Will it she started this video like drinking Filipino rum? Mano! Tagay! And now we continue. But it's like that's been like two days ago, right? It's been a few days ago. So it's not the same day. So this is Yagamayas, something German. It used to be used for medicine. But it's a little bit. It's gonna just keep using this. But it's a very very famous German experience. We love to drink vegan Germany. And also here the Filipino song. Tagay! Tagay! Come by! It's so cool! Tagay! Wow! Wow! So warm! Guys, look at that full moon of the day. Oh my god, it's so beautiful. You can't even see it in the phone that much.
