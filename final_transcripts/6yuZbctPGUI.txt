So the idea is that today, in our room, we're gonna do a couple video videos. A couple video blog of exercises you guys can do in your living room. Yeah. I know Ava doesn't like a couple of working out, but I thought, hey. If we and Ava do it into a fun thing, so it doesn't feel like a workout, then it could be something. So I've found 10 to 12 different exercises that we're gonna film and show to our followers on my YouTube channel. So if you haven't yet subscribed to Martin, head on over. Link is right here. It's important to keep your love exercise. Okay, okay. See you guys. So let's go. Let's go. Thank you. Okay, wait. What? Before, we were going to exercise. What do you mean?
