 Imagine running a business that big and being the chief operating officer. It's just it's crazy to me estimated that he was worth at least $210,000 Not bad at all They had announced a $10 billion merger and acquisition spray and so after bought Philippine Airlines they had also That's insane. That's insane Another day, another reaction video What's up Philippines? Welcome back to another video And I'm reacting to and today I am talking about Economics, you know, I tried to switch it up a little bit here on what the Philippines just because I love to learn and I hope you do too So today I am learning about the Philippines most ambitious billionaires and I already know who that might be But I'm very curious to see because believe it or not in the Philippines there are a lot of billionaires Like a lot. It's just like so crazy like people who go to cities that are low Yeah, it's just crazy. It's something very very crazy to me coming from a small little country like Austria where we don't have You know those like big things Billionaires at least they're not here anymore. So it's just straight into probably Ramon C. Ang better known as the president and chief executive officer of San Miguel San Miguel It's regarded as one of Asia's best corporate leaders under his watch He has seen and governed much of San Miguel corporations growth since he became the vice chairman of the company back in 1999 Wow the chief operating officer in 2002 much a stressful job And however is his time in San Miguel Corporation as the CEO and president of the company He was known as the Infrastructure man or the philanthropic guy who led San Miguel Corporation to build several important Infrastructure projects in the Philippines and help the country during COVID-19 more over okay San Miguel is everywhere they have so many little companies underneath that like whole corporate structure is just Crazy their own some Miguel beer their own roads their own foods. It's just like they own everything It's just wow San Miguel Corporation as a competitive business has also grown tremendously both locally and even internationally In 2015, he had a net revenue of about 672 billion pesos and a gross profit of 132 billion pesos as a Billion Well trailing months the company now has over 1.4 trillion pesos in net revenues About 218 billion pesos. Yes San Miguel Corporation we know that he is one million corporate leaders out there But what we need to understand is how how did he get to where he is? That's what I'm asking myself as well We need to understand the letter he had gone into and the actions he had taken led San Miguel Corporation to where it is today We can trace where Mr. Ang first started where he first appeared on the board of directors for San Miguel in 1999 when he was at the age of 43 many had assumed that he was merely the chairman's glorified executive assistant Who was at the time known as bending co-ancho who recently took over Andre Soriano's chair? Nothing was known about Mr. Ang he had no business affiliation stated in the company's annual report and was all but a close friend of Co-ancho son yet upon an interesting Co-ancho he had praised Ang for Impressively turning around his cement manufacturing firm and was described by Co-ancho as a successful businessman Upon appointment as the And was noted by San Miguel executives as the one who had already been running San Miguel's day-to-day operations and to whom the company's president was reporting I mean imagine running a business bad big and being the chief operating officer. It's just it's crazy to me I've been a chief operating officer, but in my own company Nothing like corporate company and that was already just for so Kudos to you. His stage as the already elected vice chairman Ang was not just like some business men out there He was already very wealthy an old source in 1999 by the far Eastern economic review of Hong Kong estimated that he was worth at least 203 not bad at all and much of his wealth came directly from his heavy equipment business Importation and property a year later as the dawn of the 21st century Ramon Ang is seen to be strategizing the future of San Miguel Corporation On January 11, 2000 it was reported that he was finding investors for a possible 30 billion pesos for a climate plan somewhere in Roxas Boulevard one of his potential investors was the famed Hong Kong billionaire Lee Ka-xin but that very project would stumble upon challenges leading to a supreme court battle by 2001 San Miguel would yet again come into rocky roads the government was still against the entire chairmanship of Mr. Kohanko and there were fears that if the government took the 27% stake in the company He and Ang would step down Fortunately, I didn't know that the government has 27% stake in San Miguel Corporation. That is very new to me at least, but that explains a lot happen by 2002 Ramon Ang would be named the official president of San Miguel But as some have noted he was already running the day-to-day Corporation and the title was nothing but a formalization in the same year Ramon Ang was seen taking up a big stake in Phil Webb Which was equivalent to about 10% of the company Phil Webb was a big company mostly operating in the casino industry Some of the most notable feeds about Ramon Ang are not specifically about his day-to-day operations But rather how he helped the corporation target its goals to enable expansion by acquisitions and new facilities He took a small stake in Phil Webb, but in San Miguel Corporation's view He was there when the company had eyeed local and international expansion in 2003 Ang and San Miguel announced a two billion pesos bottling facility plant for one of its alcoholic beverages known as Junibrasi He named Bra around Batangas It was also reported by Financial Times London that San Miguel has been looking to Asia for its next rapid revenue growth The news magazine in an interview with Mr. Clonco stated that he was hoping that San Miguel would increase its presence around Southeast Asia including China and Taiwan to allow What a second! I thought that San Miguel was already really close Despite the Philippine economy being sluggish By 2004 San Miguel had announced a production facility in Malaysia that would target the local country and also Singapore The Johor Baru facility, as stated by Mr. Ang, would enable San Miguel to lower its cost of business And that plan was to acquire a 20 hectare property in a greenfield project A year prior however in 2003, Guren Beverage's company, a Japanese conglomerate, had acquired a 15% stake in San Miguel Which was reported to be good for the country and for the economy Finally, one of the last few major acquisitions done in 2004 was when San Miguel acquired a Malaysian packaging firm Which Mr. Ang has cited that they had confidence in Malaysia for its pro-business policies By 2005 San Miguel Corporation was now rocking the entire Philippines market Their sales revenue totalled 148 billion pesos in 2003 And 174 billion by 2004 And is now looking to target 300 billion pesos How are they going to do it? Well, Ang had led San Miguel in the acquisition of a major Australian company Which it bought for a whopping $1.8 billion US National Foods, their acquired company, was a leading company in the entire food and beverages industry But Ang has stated that he was a very expensive acquisition Which led them to consider selling at least 49% of the company to minimize cash outlay But surprisingly, they did not sell 49% of the company But rather 100% of the company took care of the Japanese shareholder of San Miguel for a price tag of over $3.1 billion In just two short years Let's go profit San Miguel profit more than a billion dollars Even when they held the company as a subsidiary, it was already making profits for the parent company National Foods contributed $11 billion pesos or $280 million Australian dollars with $880 million pesos in operating income from $2.7 billion And an official $170 million in operating income by 2006 2007 and 2008 were very crucial years for Ramon Ang Because it saw a global financial recession and continued growth through mergers and acquisitions from San Miguel Corporation We all remember that time Because we know that's San Miguel Brewery Secondly, they had also gone on to acquire the Bank of Commerce which led the corporation to enter the banking industry Despite being in the middle of a global recession, San Miguel Corporation continued to acquire major companies and strived hard to see a continued change in business dynamics In 2009, a shocking event would, however, unfold Ramon Ang, which was now 53 years old, is looking to retire In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Ramon Ang said that, I've always planned to stop working and enjoy my time when I'm 55 The Wall Street Journal is for you Ramon Ang, for his role in National Foods, in which they use some of those proceeds to acquire stakes in Pitchron Corporation and Manila Electric Corporation Unfortunately, two years have passed by and Ramon Ang does not seem to have retired He would go on to experience the biggest breakthrough of his career In 2011, he led the company to stage big investments They had announced a 10 billion dollar merger and acquisition spray and so after bought Philippine Airlines, they had also... That's insane That's insane ...and through its conglomerate status, led them to enter the infrastructure business But that was not the big breakthrough of Mr. Ang After he led the company into growth, he went on to acquire a stake for himself Yes, at that point, Ramon Ang was just acting as somewhat of a leader of the San Miguel Corporation He was not the owner of the company Neither was he even a major shareholder But by 2012, he swooped in and bought 11% of San Miguel which was 493 million shares priced at about 75 pesos each for a total of about 37 million pesos And as time showed, neither his retirement nor his small 11% would stay the same He would go on to... Imagine having that money to just buy 11% As a top-ranked shareholder For that Wow He holds about 61.78% of San Miguel as of the time of this writing One could now understand just how Ramon Ang went from being a normal businessman in the Philippines to taking San Miguel Corporation in his hands But anyway, do let us know what you think Thanks for watching Super interesting video, I must say And although he is this very great businessman He is very down to earth I've met him during an event And he was very lovely, very down to earth She can't with everybody He spoke to everybody You know, it's just very good to see somebody in that position And with that success story And like, he has just having major impact on the life In the Philippines and the Philippines in general To just be so approachable So that's why I think why people love him so much And I admire him So yeah, that was it for today I hope you learned something new like I did It's a little bit clearer in my head now why certain things are the way they are But yeah If you enjoyed this video, give it a thumbs up If you're new to this channel, of course subscribe for more Next time I hope we'll do some fun video again Leave me some recommendations in the comment section down below And I'll see you guys next time here on What's up Philippines Bye
