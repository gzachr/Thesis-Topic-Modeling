 Hey guys, it's Shinsumeth, okay, today we are going to do this video. Japanese song for Tokyo Olympic. Wow! While some of my subscribers recommended for me to react to this video, thanks for that. But what the hell is this video? We are recommending. This is Tokyo Bon Orderi. Bon Orderi is a Japanese traditional dancing. People dance when it's summer festival, wearing kimono, a yukata. You know, it's like a kimono, but it's a clothes which you wear in summer, so it's different. Well, it's just boring stuff to Japanese, especially in younger generations, we don't really give a shit. But what the hell, it's 100 million views. So why? It's so special. While as a Japanese, I got to check this out, right? So let's get into it.

When you say Wakari masita, I say Hitachi to yo takawa. Wakari masita, I don't speak Japanese. So it doesn't make a sense, right? Just- just lighting up the world, you know, right? I see. Just, uh, for in a say, the word, uh, which Japanese might know, might understand. So that is Hitachi and Toyotorai, but it doesn't make a sense. We don't usually say Hitachi to yota in, you know, dairy conversation, so that's so weird. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see.

There are many Japan things, Japan stuff in it. Like kimono, samurai, sumo, and even Joshikose, you know, it's meaning high school girls. And many Japanese words as well, which makes Japanese really confused when they speak English. For me as well, sometimes I said Japanese words. Like when I was living London, I said like, can I have a fried potato please? Then the shop clerk said like, okay, French fry? Now I still remember that I was so embarrassing. I was so embarrassed. I still remember that. Anyway, that was nice one. Japan, Japanese culture, so fantastic. Then you think so? So you guys spreading this video to the world please. Okay, that's it for today.
