 Hi, both friends! We're K-Bot TV! Today, we're here to take our penalty video from the Korean reactions when Filipinos speak Korean so well video. Yeah, so Dan and I are the only ones who failed the challenge in that video. If you guys don't know, please search it up. And so we're here to draw lots from the choices, the penalty choices. However, there are a lot of comments, but then there weren't many suggestions about what kind of penalty we should take. So all we have here are only six suggestions. Yeah, and there were also many people who want to join and participate our contents like phone call videos. So for those who want to join and participate our contents, please check our community page on our YouTube channel. Yeah, and so next we'll tell you guys the list of what kind of suggestions there were. The first one is, do a cosplay, a girl cosplay, any main character. That'll be funny. The second one can't say no challenge, can say no. Third one, eating 10 pieces of chili, that's the hot chili. Oh my god. Spicy. The fourth one is eating ballad. Eating ballad. Oh no, no, no, please no, please no. Not ballad, I hate ballad. I'm gonna score. Fifth one is eating raw eggs. Raw eggs? Eating a raw egg. Better than ballad. And here we have the last one. Do a dance cover of twice as cheer up or what is love. Ah, that's the best. Thank you. I just hope that you don't do the ballad challenge. Okay, so we're gonna write down the choices so that we can draw lots now. Okay guys, we're back. We're done writing all the list. And so now it's our turn to draw lots. But it's not gonna be us.
