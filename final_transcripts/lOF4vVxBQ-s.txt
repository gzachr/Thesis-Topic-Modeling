 I'm in the Philippines and I have no money. We're going to be seeing if we can find food, transport and so much of sleep tonight with the kindness of the people in the Philippines.

I'm thinking I'm going to try and be smart with my money and not blow it all at once because we've got to find hopefully a hotel to stay up. So, let's be smart. Let's be careful. And get some free food. And they drink. Ooh. Oh, that's delicious. I sure about my mom. Oh, you remember me? Yes. I'm doing a different video this time. I'm doing a video, John, where I spend 24 hours in Manila with no money. So, I'm asking if you would be able to give me anything for free. Yeah, I can give you anything. You can? Oh, my God. You're amazing. You are my wish come true. But my choice is not here. You choose. You choose. Whatever you want. I mean, it all looks delicious. Where is Ali? Ali. Ali is somewhere else.

Oh, I'm going to thank you so much. I'll take this for free, but I'm giving that to the staff. Okay. Thank you so much, man. No problem, no problem. And I'm going to enjoy it. Okay. It's fun. Sorry? You need to explore? Uh, yes, please. Here we go. Oh, baby. Oh, baby. Guys, I have to say this is going too easy. This is going too well. Something's got to go wrong. I mean, I've still got nowhere to sleep tonight, but I've got something to eat. I've been given too much. I've got enough money. Like, it's been amazing. So, guys, I was really thinking this morning, this is not going to be possible. Like, I'm just like, it was really tired. It didn't want to come out, but I'm so glad I did. It just shows how kind the people here are in the Philippines. All right. Oh, my God. Oh. Okay. M bakery. Mixer up. You guys got to go there. Okay. Good afternoon. How are you? The Britain New Hotel. I want to ask a question. How much is it for one night? So, are we for now 8,000 for our Deluxe Fiend? 8,000. Yes. Wow. 16,000 for our three group. 16,000. I have a budget of 400. Can we? Can we?

Thank you very much. Ah, well. That's the idea out of the window. It's time to venture out of BGC and see what else we can find here in Manila. I've heard there is a slum directly next to BGC which is going to be very interesting to show you the contrast. So we're going to try and get maybe a free lift there. Let's see. We've got a guy coming. Oh, he's seeing me. Hello brother. Hello brother. Can you go to Minipark? Minipark. Okay. It's okay. What's your name? I'm Minipark. Jason. Dickson. Okay. Nice to meet you brother. All right. It's actually not very far. I walked past the way but... And he worked for Joyride. People are going to think that I booked him but I did. Okay. All right. Wow, literally here is a slum right next to the skyscrapers. I can walk. I can walk. Yeah, yeah. Thank you brother. That's for you. No, no, no. No, no, no. Are you keep? Oh. Because you are giving me free rides and you are working very hard. No problem. I take the helmet. Maybe I need the helmet in here. No problem. Have a good day boss. Nice to meet you. Zero. All right. Mmm. Master up. Haha. I have no money. Oh, I do have money. Yes, so obviously, again, I'm giving people money but that's outside of the challenge. I mean, it's just the game at the end of the day and these people are giving me free things and so I feel like they are working hard and giving me free things. They deserve it. So, yeah. Once in a while I will pause the game. But this is literally like five minutes or you guys saw the skyscrapers were just behind me. In fact, you can see them. The skyscrapers right there. Hi. Hello.

But I wonder if there's a hotel here. Who do you? Who do you? It looks like we got the security force giving us an improvised talk. Whoa. Be careful, guys. We're going into depths. They even got like a sewage system here. They've got pipes running water. Hello. Hello. How are you? Are you selling anything? Hello. What are you selling? Chicken. Chicken and Dova.
