How are you, Proud?
In today's video episode series,
we will discuss
the continued popularity of Filipino food
not only in the Philippines
but all over the world.
In this video,
we will discuss
the ultimate dish
which is delicious,
Sisig!
Not statistically, but I mean,
I think it's the most
likely to convince people
abroad who have had no
exposure to Filipino food
to maybe look further
and investigate further beyond
Sisig. I think that's the one that's going to hook them.
Filipino cuisine itself
is not fusion, but it is
a melting pot of cultures. I mean, you have
the indigenous people, you have the
Spanish that conquered later on,
there's Islamic influence, there's Southeast Asian
influences. I like the notion of
this rich cuisine with all
of its component and constituent
ingredients. Proud.
Denavan had such an amazing appetizer.
Maybe the best dish of the entire competition.
I'd love to incorporate
my heritage, the
Filipino cooking and food
and... What are you doing here? This is the Deadpool
chimichanga truck, and it says
please, one chimichanga per guest.
I disagree with that. I think
they can have as many as they damn well please.
For a food truck. Now I hear these guys
are doing a cross between Filipino
and Latin American cuisine. You never
know where they're going to be, so you gotta check them out on their
website, and I found them. This is
Senior Sisig.
What's up, KaProud? Today's
video episode, we're going to talk about
the ultimate Filipino comfort
food that's not just for drinking.
It's also good for preparing
and delicious food for eating.
But now, it's not just the taste of
Filipinos that's getting stuck in our
favorite Sisig.
It's also popular in other countries and
in cooking show competitions.
Before we continue,
thank you so much for
subscribing to our channel
to be updated on our
KaProud Filipino video moments.
I like Sisig
very very much. That's perfect beer
drinking food. Love it. There's a lot of
Sisig restaurants here but
this one is the best. This is really really good.
One of the Filipino
food that really stands out
in the taste of the famous American celebrity
chef Anthony Bourdain is
Sisig. This is one of the
feature foods in his Parts Unknown
documentary series when it
went to the Philippines.
And there are a lot of cooking
or food show segments that featured
in our ultimate comfort food
Sisig.
Let's watch some of the reactions
of the fans of their
taste of Sisig, KaProud.
How is it?
It's so good.
It's so flavorful.
And you can taste like that sourness
that Nicole was speaking of as well.
And it's still sizzling hot
because it just came out of the pan.
It's always delicious.
To use it as a platform
to
you know,
you know,
you know,
you know,
as a platform to
you know,
give our country
some identity which is
fantastic.
Denovan had such an amazing
appetizer. Maybe the best
dish of the entire competition.
Then came
Aleng Lusing, a Filipino
barbecue owner from Pampanga.
Good?
Yeah?
Very good.
Wow.
I don't know what they are but
they taste amazing.
Isn't the skin so crunchy?
Mmm.
Mmm.
Do you hear that?
Mmm.
One of the reasons Sisig
in America is the food truck
of Senor Sisig.
Deadpool is the only one who visits
their food truck, guys.
Wow.
That pork has got so much flavor.
Mmm.
Salty spicy goodness.
I've had a lot of $4 tacos.
Not one with that much meat in it.
This is something that people could talk about
it gets the word of mouth going.
Yeah, Senor Sisig, they're a great food truck
but also they have these hidden menu items
so it makes us feel good to give them
something special as well.
Senor Sisig is very famous
guys.
My name is Evan Quidera and I'm the general
manager of Senor Sisig.
My name is Gil Piyumo, I'm the chef of
Senor Sisig.
Senor Sisig has found its first
ever brick and mortar home after
10 years of serving out of food
trucks.
Mabuhay po kayo, Senor Sisig.
...basis.
By providing these meals,
we are able to give our employees work
and feed those in need at the same time.
It's a win-win.
At mula nga noong December
2003 ay taon-taon
ng pinagdiriwang ang Sisig Festival
kung saan nagsimula ang Sisig sa
Angeles, Pampanga.
Ibinibida dito ang ibat-ibang
kutahin ng Sisig at paggalingan sa
pagluto ng ating ultimate favorite.
Hindi na nga lamang sa Pilipinas
may Sisig Festival dahil
nito lamang 2021 ay
pinagdiwang ang kauna-unahang Sisig
Festival sa Estados Unidos sa
pangunguna ng ating mga proud kababayan.
Tunay ngang naka atua
na makita ang patuloy na pagsikat
at pagkakaroon ng identity
ng ating mga Filipino food pagdating
sa ibang bansa.
Salamat sa ating mga kababayan na buong kusong
pinalalaganap at ibinabahagi
ang ating napakayamang kultura lalo
na pagdating sa kusina.
Anong Filipino food ba
ang hindi pa napapansin at sa
tingin mo ay dapat mabigyan ng
pagkakataon at ipatikim sa mga
malayaga at makilala na din ito
katulad ng adobo, sinigang at sisig.
Comment at pag-usapan natin yung mga
ka-proud.
Maraming salamat sa panunood.
Like muna din para masaya tayong
lahat ka-proud. Kita-kita uli tayo
sa susunod na video episode
ng Proud Filipino Moments.
Hanggang sa muli!
