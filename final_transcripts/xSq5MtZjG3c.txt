 Good morning, another day another dollar. Let's see what we are going to do today. So, I don't go away. We are in pancake this morning. We don't know bread. That's it. Pec cake with those. Bit of a spread. Avocado. Chuna. That's it. Okay, we did it again. Broke down so we can't have to fix. Okay, gone, gone, gone to get this fran mechanic. We can't do much. We need to drop the tank. Yeah, big drama here. Yeah, big drama here. We have to drop the tank. No, so... The Havaxes. Otherwise... I'm going to get this. Be really so... Like this. You like? No. No like? No. So what do you need? The... Just a symbol. This. Get the bamboo and sho other. And then sho other. And then foxy. Ah, two here. You hold together. Yeah, you okay? Small bamboo. Sure. Yeah, small bamboo and then foxy. I know some of you told me by a new car, but I don't have the money now. I got to spend most of my pension in the house to finish all the house. So hopefully, the next year, I might be with a new one. So this is going to last until very soon. So... Teamwork. The tank has to come down. Ah. Ciao. Yeah. Bye, this. Where? I'm going to the shop. I'm going to the shop. I'm going to the shop. I'm going to the shop. So what's the broken thing? I want to. Yeah. Yeah. Like this. Okay, back home to do some work. Well, the thing is dry out there. We'll go back later in the afternoon to install everything should be fine. We had a bit of a run last night. No much, but... Enough to show us where things are leaking, which is good. So we're going to fix those leakage. And also a bit of a panting they forgot. So anyway. Left over the concrete. Going on this that I think is good. And this one here. So I don't know how that's going to last, because there's no metal by inside, I think. But that's okay. I'm happy maybe we can do a couple here as well. I don't want to spend the money now on those steps, but we should have something a little bit reliable like this. They will have to level up this one, cut those things and level up. Here's my little princess. She was playing with Mimi. Hello, gorgeous. Okay, well, forget about finishing the wardrobe. Somebody's working here now. It's nice. Okay, we're finalizing the base of the upper tank. This should be flat level. Almost lunch, so I'm sure I'm cooking something nice here. Again. Fish with the magic sauce. Okay, we'll do the thing probably after lunch, because he may be running at his lunch time soon. Hello. Hello, my love. You play with the pets. Hello. Hello, Lily. Hello, Mimi. Mimi. Come here. Mimi. Meow. Meow, meow, meow. Oh, fudgey. Meow. Oh, you love it here, eh? Daddy will carry you like this so many times in the future. Don't worry. I'm your host. Or your camel. She's happy girl. Okay, let's have lunch now. Let's go. I'm hungry. It's the joke. It's a little bit old, or a little bit old. Nice salad. We got pancake from this morning. I love it. And two types of fish. Is this the bangles? Yeah. And red tails. Let's see. I'm going to have it in the meantime. She emitted gonggong. It was there before. Cheeky. Well, this was really beautiful. It's so well. Too good now. I don't feel like working. I feel like sleeping. I hope the run comes in soon. Sounds very hot, no? Beware, dude. I see it, my friend. How you do for level? Oh, you got something there? Okay. I see it, my friend. You've got a three o'clock. Three o'clock? Okay. I don't want to go too hot. Three o'clock? Beware. Three o'clock. Three o'clock. We'll go and put the tank back. Yep. But you put something after go... Strait? Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure you will. Okay. This is finished. Let it dry. We can put the upper tank there. That's the small one we have done since. Pretty good. Okay. I put two bottom shelving, which kind of support as well. I made a few more shelvings, but I need to make more. To finish this wardrobe, which I've class had a bit of a chance to do a little bit on it. But now we go. The things to do. Our usual afternoon snack. Very cold drink. With some snacks. What's up? Are you going to share as well? Great. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, living for the whole day. She look at the drink. That's the latest artwork from J.M. Family makes this house at home. Very nice. Yett. I think it's enough epoxy there. Yeah. That's good. That's okay. Oh, this is fixed once and for all. We like it. Where we broke down. We had assistance not far. Feeling the middle of somewhere. Are we planning to go to Davos? Better get this fixed properly. You can see there's a ton of epoxy. I don't think it's going to come off this time. Anyway. What are you doing? I'm going to show you. I'm going to show you. Bella really like gong-gong. She's always after him every time he comes in. Do you have any other baby? You don't have any other baby? No. No, it's actually my love. The epoxy wasn't dry enough. So I decided to bring this back home here. We'll fix it. Maybe wait a couple days or three. Even if you need to be. Once it's fully dry, we put it back. It could be Saturday. We are Thursday. OK. Nothing else we can do. So see you tomorrow. Oh, very good. Good morning. What a good Tuesday. Still not much rain, I'm forwardly. Still a lot of work to do. Just a bit of a problem with the gators. They haven't completed the gators the way I asked them. So not to show you're going to do about it, whether we're going to do it with self. We've got the tools and everything, but we've got no cars. So we can't bring it back up there and get him modified. So we'll see with this. Oh, this plenty more work to do, guys. So just hang around. For those who are interested in our CCTV camera that we bought, highly recommended. And also our blue-ity power station, highly recommended as well. This is really get us out of trouble. It's not expensive. And it's only 600 watts. You can buy higher if you want to, but that's enough to run your modern. And then if you want to run a power tool or something like that, no problem whatsoever. And they're really great for traveling. So that's all on the pin comment below. Thank you for helping. Thank you for your support. Well, that really nice this morning. So it's the best time to do some conquering. So I just asked him to do some acceptable steps. I think that should do. I don't want to spend too much money on that now. I need to be careful. Bella always hang on top of that door. And she's not light anymore. Maybe 10, 15 kilos. I don't know. So the door is coming off. So I'm going to put something there to hold the door in position as when we close it. I'll do that. OK. Concrete. Based for the app attack is just about completed. Any of the meantime, he's done some steps here. Very nice. Not completed yet. He has to do the up-rise area. I don't know how we call it. The rise, I guess. But I like it's very original. And it's probably more original than that. I like it. For now, we'll do very windy. Is that from the garden? That's beautiful. You can make it earrings, maybe. It's good. Yep. Let's put our lunch to there. OK. We need to finish those pieces of gatta. It's not full gatta. He hasn't been done. And it's been delivered. I didn't realize. Now, I'm not going to fix it. Then I need to have, of course, a land to be functional. Then I need to make a hole and put one of those. I had to spray one here, actually, from last time. And they had to put those holder in between brackets. They refuse to do it. And they already pay the full amount. This is a one company. I will show the details. My wife, Frank, I try to send a text message to him in the answers. So my wife, Frank, he's been very rude and hung up on her. And now he's the answer to any of my text message, because it's got all the money. It doesn't care. It doesn't care. So guys, if you have to do some, if you have to do any roofing, don't go there, am I? Because the guy is rude and he's dishonest. OK. We need to finish those pieces of gatta. It's not full gatta. He hasn't been done. And it's been delivered. I didn't realize. Now I'm not going to fix it. Then I need to have, of course, a man to be functional. Then I need to make a hole and put one of those. I had to spray one here, actually, from last time. And they had to put those holder in between brackets. They refused to do it. And they already put a full amount. This is a one company. I will show the details. My wife, Frank, I try to send a text message to him in the answers. So my wife, Frank, he's been very rude and hung up on her. And now he's the answer to any of my text message, because it's got all the money. It doesn't care. It doesn't care. So guys, if you have to do some, if you have to do any roofing, don't go there, man. Thank you. Osmos. Almost lunch. How we go? Oh, that beautiful salad. I love it. And you've got, carry chicken, I think. Chicken a dobo. Chicken a dobo. Chicken a dobo. Yum, yum, yum, yum. OK. Wow. Full of sleep. Nice and cool here. So sweet. And while we make in the gutter, Jean-Pis is doing that for our house. You hold the... Maybe too close to the hole. Yeah, a little bit, a little bit. Yeah. It's a world first. We do our own gutter. Very good. All right, this is looking good. Get in there. Maybe I finish on Monday, it's OK. We finish working on the gutter. So what we decided to do is to put a little bit more epoxy around the thing, just to make it stronger. And I will do the job tomorrow morning. We'll do today. It's too tired. So a little bit of epoxy there and I will have a beer. We will catch it guys. Very, very, very hot. We have to do the same thing with the other one. The amount of water that we put in is important. I don't know if it's going to be good. Open the book, B and write. I will put a bit more here too. Write. Yeah, around here. Make it stronger. That's the weakest point. How do you like your new house? Very nice. I'm a person in the morning. He's not going home. Like before, looks so good. Come on. Yeah. Look at this. 14 months. My God. She even can hold it pen properly. That's it. It's the end of the day. Just relax here with a side video. OK, that's it for this video. Hope you enjoyed it. Until the next video. Take care. God bless. Bye bye.
