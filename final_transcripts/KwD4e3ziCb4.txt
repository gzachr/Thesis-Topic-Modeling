 Let's get the ass caught. Welcome back to the vlog today. We are trying Filipino food for the very first time and I am so excited. I have a couple of Filipino friends and they always rape about how good they're food is. Which is crazy because like three of her best friends are Filipino like she just said and she's never had this food before like they never take you like they just don't care. They just don't love me I guess. But listen we're starting off this video on a sad note because what happened? So we got appetizer, entree and desserts and we had also ordered a drink to kind of try a little bit of everything. We got the Kalamansi juice but they forgot to give it to us at the restaurant. They really ordered it and everything I was so excited. Guess we don't get to try today. That is fun because we got a ton of other things that smell amazing. We haven't opened anything so it's going to be our first time looking at everything with you guys. So where should we start with that? We got to start with the appetizer. So we are going to start with the lumpia. This is like a classic Filipino appetizer. They're just like egg rolls kind of look like egg rolls. So this is veggie lumpia. The restaurant didn't have like any chicken or pork or anything. So we're starting to veggie lumpia with some I'm assuming sweet and sour sauce. You're going right in without me. Oh. Oh. Oh, this is fire. Oh my god. Hold on. These are kind of like an egg roll. I feel like I've had something very similar to this but I love crispy but soft it is. This is so good. On fact, we're starving. So everything is going to taste perfect. 10 times better. I got to go in for seconds. Oh my god. We literally ate all of them. We should have got two orders of this. I might rate this a perfect 10. Honestly, same. The rest of this food is as good as that. We're going to the Philippines. Literally. Now I'm going to be mad for living 24 years of my life and not trying this food. Next up, we got the chicken adobo. Alright, let's dig in. So this chicken adobo. Oh my. This looks fire. Oh my god. It's like it like rips apart so easily. Nice and tight. I tell you no, it's good. Hold on. Oh my god. Bro, this thing tears so easily. Oh my god. This is so good. I'm not even exaggerating. This is so good. My mom makes a chicken very similar to this. Has my mom been making me Filipino chicken this whole time? Yep. Okay. And I didn't know. Usually when we do food reviews, I only want to take a couple bites to stay space for the other stuff. I'm not even joking, guys. I want to finish this plate of food. Like this is fire. This. 10. Yes. Damn. Moving on. To an even bigger box. We got. So this is the Bami noodles. We got a little lemon in here. Look at these noodles, guys. They're like clear. I don't even know how to explain it. Oh my god. No, like for real. The Latinos are so lucky. It's like what? This page, like a healthy version of the cup of noodles. Wow. No, this is actually so good. This is really good. I'm kind of picky. Like I'm being honest. I'm kind of picky, but this is all hidden in the spot. Well, I'm all hidden. Oh my goodness. You're slurping that, babe. I got to figure it out. The texture of these is so different than any other noodle I've ever had. And it looks like it's mixed with two different kinds of noodles. Yeah. Because I see like a bigger one. We got like the regular chow mein. Takshtail noodle and then clear ones. Mmm. So it looks like we got green beans, carrots, red onions, chicken. What else is in here? Lettuce. Bro. Fire. And it kind of has like lemon ease. Yeah, yeah. I was going to say that too. This is fire. Bro, no, like this is actually so good. Holy. I think we should have ordered more food. Now I want to go back and try the whole menu. We're only getting a little taste. I just remembered. We were supposed to be doing like a little Q&A while eating. But we were so hungry and the food was so good. And we got so into the food that we both completely forgot. Like this is just fully us eating and enjoying this delicious food. We've obviously done food reviews in the past. In like most of the time the food is good, but it's not like, oh my god, I'm going to go back for this. And I'm going to go out of my way to go get this. Yep. But I think this spot is going to be a new spot for us. Yeah. And we had to drive 20 minutes for it. Like I would not even mind driving for that. Oh my god. No, like actually though. Oh my god. Okay, we got it. We got to move on to the next one. We got one. And then this is my favorite so far. Really? Okay. I give this one. I give this one a nine. It's not the perfect 10 like the chicken and rice were for me and the lucha. I give this a 10. Damn babe. I think we need to plan a trip to the Philippines. Oh, team box number three. We got Lechon Kowali. Check this out guys. Oh my god. This is going to hit the spot because I'm Cuban. We love Lechon and Cuba. I'm so down. We got to dig into this. Oh, yep. Oh my god. It does literally a two-chop. I'm like, so use these. Wait, you got to try with the sauce, though. Oh my god. Sauce going in. Interesting. I never really smoked that before. Hey, Loki tastes like teriyaki. Not teriyaki. Um, katsu sauce. Oh, oh, this is like their take on chicken katsu. This is a Filipino chicken katsu. Yeah. It's good. Right? Doesn't it taste like katsu sauce a little bit? Oh my god. Like a small hint of it. I have no words right now. I have no words. I want to cry because I've gone so long without trying this amazing food. Are you kidding me? And they got the money I want you to under? Damn. What you're reading? Damn. Oh. Ten? I give this a ten. That sauce was fired. The crispiness and still softness of the lechon. That's fire. Chef's kiss. I think I'm going to give it like an eight and a half. Just this for me. It's a little heavy. Like this is like fried. He doesn't like that almost. Yeah, it's very oily. Me though. But it's good though. None the less. Okay. Now for the first dessert, we're going to try cassava cake. And if I'm not mistaken, I'm pretty sure cassava is kind of like a potato. And in my country, we call it yuka. But we don't use it for desserts. We use it with like garlic and stuff as a side dish. So I'm excited to try this. Alright, let's try this bad boy. Oh, it's thick. Oh, it's really almost. It's really almost. Oh, I like this consistency already. Mmm. Interesting. It's coconut. It's coconut. Mmm. Mmm. And it's warmed up. Is it supposed to be warm? Oh. Yeah. Mmm. Yo, I kind of like this. It's good. It's actually really good. Mmm. I love the coconut taste and the texture. I don't even know how to explain the texture. It's like hard and soft, like creamy. Yeah. We even miss it not for real. Mmm hmm. I'm surprised you like it this much because it's not the sweetest thing in the world. It's like that perfect sweetness. Mmm hmm. That's what I was thinking too. But you guys know Andrea, if it doesn't have a bag of sugar in it. Okay, we got one more. We got halohalo. So this has a whole bunch of stuff in it. I got to look up the description because it's literally got like 10 ingredients. The halohalo is shaved ice, jackfruit, coconut meat, a combination of selected sweet and banana, sweet potato, beans, purple jam, foreign and ube ice cream on top. Hold that, Brad. I know. All that sounded good, but beans, Brad. How does beans are dessert? Let's start with the ube ice cream because I actually have tried ube before and so have you. We had ube pancakes in Hawaii and they were so good. It did melt a little bit on the car ride home because it is like 85 out. Ready, ready? Oh. Mmm. Ube, oh my goodness. Oh my god, that's so good. That's fire. And look at how pretty this color is. Like just the color already makes me so happy. Alright, I got a slice of flan. And then we have some shaved ice. I see the beans and I'm scared. Wait, I see the beans. Yeah, I don't know about that. There's beans. I don't know about that, Bob. I'm gonna get a little bit of ice cream with my bean. I don't like beans. This is like jelly, huh? Oh, wait, try that. Mmm. Was it good? I think it is jelly. I don't know what this is. Green bean. I have no idea what you're reading. I'm gonna keep it real with you guys. That was not my favorite. Yeah. Just, if I could just have the ube ice cream and not everything else, it would be a 10. The ube ice cream itself was a 10. Everything else? No for me. I'm gonna give it like a 5. Really a 5? Yeah, a 5. I'm being harsh on that one. I would give it like a 7. A 7? Okay. Alright guys, that was everything for today. Yeah, and we're still gonna go back and finish all that food because all my god, it was so good. I think my personal favorite was probably the chicken of the wolf. Oof, that was fire. Thank you. Probably the noodles. The noodles, okay. I know you're gonna go grab a spoon of this. I'm gonna go slip those up. What would that be said? Thank you guys for watching. Shout out to all the Filipinos out there. And we'll catch you guys in the next one.
