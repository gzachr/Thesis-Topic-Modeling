 Kumasaki on waha. Hello everyone how are you? I'm a color washing clothes Deeds of Philippines. Everyone in America and everyone else throughout the world This is how you wash clothes in the Philippines. So the Philippines believe that by washing clothes by hand like this it gets some cleaner rather than using the traditional modern washing machine. So here I am washing my jeans and some of the wife stuff and this is how you do it. It's really a no surprise rather labor intensive and wash it out and later I'll put it out in the sun. Now when my Nana which is a mother of mother-in-law she comes over here. She has this long brown stick and she actually whips and thinks the color. That's like the agitator but I'm not gonna use that. I'm just gonna simply wash and scrub them just like this and that's how I'm gonna get cleaned. There you go. And so far this is what I've got. Alright so I'm gonna rain these out. Got the other one's finished. These segalo word for a man washing clothes is lap and battle. That's just how they bring them out. Just like this. After you have the obvious done, you're simply hanging out the sun. Most people do the dryers and the thoppings are not like dryers in America. They do not do the heat. Only dries them basically like this when you're ringing out. You're still gonna come out there and I'm gonna dry them the thoppings. Hey Joe remember do subscribe.
