 Nyo, I can really play this with my record. Sorry, I can't do this. It's not the thing. It's the thing. It's the thing. No! No! No! No! Start! It should give our old buffer. If you don't want to serve, it's a game that's just a bit too common. It's a bit common. It's a bit common. The real Christmas begins with games, right? So we're gonna be playing games. Alright guys, so now we're here to play the highlight. The Christmas games, our favorite, Filipino Christmas games. My favorite game is, and we're gonna have to play this last. I don't know if you're okay with it. Oh yeah. I'm pretty sure okay with it, and I'm okay with that. I don't know if you're okay with it. No, I'm not. Hey, I have this feeling there'll be like something on my face. This is something like that. Yeah, yeah. Hold your right. About my English teacher while I go, right? So she always really added like different twists in the existing Filipino games. Okay. To make it even more fun. But while we're gonna play, I think it's the simple version so basically it's like, Hanapera. There's a flower. There are coins covered in flower. And we have to like, blow it until we see where the coin is. How to blow it? Yeah, you blow it. As fast as you can, and the person who said, how many coins there are wins. Yeah, so it's a very, very simple game. But yeah, you're gonna be like flower attack. So that's my favorite game. What about you guys? For me, I mean, it's not really set as a Christmas game, but it's like, it's like, because you can miss Christmas without a car, okay, right? Right, right, right. There's a song. You have to continue to lyrics. Like, yeah, yeah. Okay, finish the lyrics. Okay, so mine is called Papi-Bean. Honestly, I had to Google this because this has been my all-time favorite Pinoy game. Regardless of the occasion, whether that be birthday parties or Christmas parties, just because I always had an advantage because I was big. Since you were a kid? Yeah. I thought you were a kid. No, I just saw. Yeah, yeah, yeah. When you say big, it doesn't always have to be like, you know, I was just, you know, called, okay? Okay, so we're gonna play our favorite games. Oh, okay.
