 I am a 61 year old man, American, retired police officer, although I still do work part-time doing some police details. I've lost eight years to adult children and that's about it for me. I'm for the eight years old. I will get the good doctor's medical clinic and I'm single. I'm mother-of-two. I had a friend of mine that went to the one on one of the socials in China and he came back with some really good information and my only problem was I didn't want to go to a place where they would be translators. So I told him if you'd go to the Philippines, we could go together and try to meet some girls in the Philippines that speak English. I find them nice and humble. I do like the culture. I like the way the gals look over there. I've not had a lot of luck dating American girls so I figured it was time to try before in country and the Philippines was at the top of my list. We met at the social on a Friday night in January of 2019 and meeting all the girls at that social the way it was so well-run that I met everyone. Well then I just hit it off from the very beginning. I almost didn't go to the second social the next night because I knew Wellmo was going to probably be up for me. And before that week was over I had proposed to Wellmo, gone out, bought a ring, presented everyone the ring and for almost four months since then we've talked every day, texted every day and done video chats. I would recommend it and I actually had already recommended it to two of my friends and they said they're going to investigate it and I told them you don't ask me any questions you want and I'll talk to them about the good things that happened to me. I know we haven't known each other all that long but this is an experience I really want to go through with you. I love you and will you marry me? Yes. Hello. Yeah, it's getting cold.
