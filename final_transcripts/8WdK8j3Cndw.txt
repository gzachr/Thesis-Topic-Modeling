Yes We did it a long time ago. Yeah, it's been quite a while Before we even really started talking about the Philippines Yeah, we jumped into it because He's a big fanatic for scary movies and stuff like that. So yeah, so this is really Intriguing to me especially with these being urban legends So they're good or could not be some truth behind yeah, that's exciting So if you guys are ready and if you're ready, I'm ready. I'm ready And let us know if these urban legends are True or if you know about them or if you have other ones that They don't say basically yeah, and if there's any videos on specific urban legends That are just specific about one urban legend If that makes any sense Welcome back everyone. I told you guys to let me know which of these urban legend videos You really like and we will go back and do more on that country part two part three We got flooded with people asking for this exact video I dropped what I was doing and started working it right away. Luckily the Philippines has more scary stories And I'll ever be able to use but let's do 10 more really creepy ones anyway My name is Danny Burke and this is the top 10 scary Filipino urban legends part two starting off number 10 now We have Bearing Anne City This is a mythical city that set the line between the real Filipino areas of Gandhara to Ragnan and Pag Sanghan Here's the thing it's said to be completely invisible according to local folklore the entire population of Bearing Anne City is comprised of supernatural beings there are shape shifters who take human form and sometimes invite outsiders like us to visit their city If you're invited be aware that time does not move the same in this city seconds become minutes minutes become hours Some who say they've been That sounds dope that that does but it could also be scary In that I'm terrified they've been missing for weeks when almost no time has passed the toll for them The most common reports of the city come from sailors who claim to have seen a dazzling city of lights on Moonless nights for a few minutes They describe it as beautiful with high rise buildings and advanced technology One story said that a Japanese company saw bright tracks of land in the area from a satellite image Now they thought it was gold and began setting up sightland nearby town But mysterious accidents and mishaps forced them to shut down the operation in visible city Do you guys think that's the perfect cover or a little bit far fetch movie on some a nine now Let us know what you guys think about bearing em see what does that make me think of there's a movie What is it where he Is in like the bookshelf and his daughter Inception no it make I don't know it makes me think about which obviously it's completely different But where he said that they go into the city and they feel like they've only been gone for a few minutes And it's been weeks at the manifest TV show I'm watching oh Okay, we're gonna talk about the Ang canto some people say these are actually the supernatural beings who inhabit the invisible city We just talked about either way they're believed to live throughout the whole of the Philippines The encanto are mythical environmental spirits that are said to have the ability to appear in human form They're often associated with the spirit of people's ancestors physically They're meant to look like elves sirens and other sort of dark magical beings They are similar to humans the age they have males and females They can suffer from illness and even die some appear to be fair in complexion with blue eyes and golden hair They live in natural homes such as large rocks or trees But can't make these appear like magical palaces to humans. They're enchanting creatures But everyone who hears the stories knows to avoid them They can cause fevers and skin diseases or lead travelers into the forest to kidnap them next to anima right now If they kidnap them are they just taking them to the cool city Right How the siren up these creatures are the Filipino version of Mum and they are said to be the sirens with scales covering their entire bodies and colors ranging from brown to green and gill slits But they're in various places Is this where sirens came from? I don't know. I just know that they're they're very alluring and then they're like scary Yeah, I bet yeah, no, I think siren like I think the siren methodologies really cool. Yeah I agree is dope so that they can breathe in the water I mean, I would put bodies of eight was a whole full of a mountain Capering down to the tail of a fish with scale encrusted legs and webbed feet various legends to pick them with powerful green tentacles Finns web tans claws and other appendages They're also said to have very sharp teeth which make them formidable predators the scary part is They are hostile to all humans who they drown in the depths of the sea and then devour as food also many stories involved And called in shipwrecks just to eat the sailors on board their bloodthirsty nature cover with their extreme intelligence makes some a terrifying Predator kind of reminds me of another You had me at the moment next to band number seven now. We have this it kind of reminds me of a species. We're all kind of familiar with The he was talking about females. Yeah cheap knee right this is a story shared by a filipino girl about her friend one day her friend went home late after finishing off a school Product she took the local jeepney bus because it was late a jeepney is a popular means of public transport in the Philippines on the journey She kept noticing the driver was looking at her in his rearview mirror She got worried but he began to take turns in the road that he was not meant to however She was even more scared of being left in the middle of nowhere and so decided to not say anything eventually though He touched your back onto the correct route and they arrived safely at her destination He turned to her and said I'm sorry if I scared you or start with you It was not my intention. Could you do me a favor and burn all your clothes when you get home He continued saying the reason why I kept glancing was because your head was not attached to your body when I looked at you through my rearview mirror That is why I changed my route a while ago hoping we could get away from this bad energy And that's why I want you to burn your clothes when you get home because I think it is still with you The girl was obviously shocked by this and ran home quickly burning her clothes in a fire a few days later She heard on the news of the driver had died a day after the incident It was then that she realized the warning in the mirror was not for her but for him next up at number six now We have the as well as these eyes. Okay. I'm not gonna lie so far out of all these videos that we've done We've done Texas we've done Malaysia. We've done the Philippines part one the support to this is the best story Yeah, that was actually really good that needs to be a movie. Yeah, that was But had me kind of crawling. Yeah, that was pretty. I don't know the way to the background looks on this though I think this one's gonna be creepy as well Yeah, I like that last one that last one had some really good twists and turns to it so Shape shifters who live among their human neighbors without us ever knowing they've been described as a Ghoulish combination of a vampire and a werewolf there seems to be no single coherence solid description of what these creatures look like some say it's essentially a werewolf and appearance Others say it's closer to a vampire the only common themes that the ass-wang are always shape shifters They live normal lives among the like and then at night they change Yes, why more into various creatures to hunt their prey, which is usually young children or unborn fetuses Which they suck out and devour directly from the mother's wounds very gross I know but it's part of the story when it comes to these hideous creatures moving us into five now We have the Tiana this is wait wasn't the like in the actual werewolf. Yeah, and then he had like and was the hybrid Yeah, no, no, there's a werewolf. He had likeins and yeah Yeah, yeah, but it's a what was the combination of the two? I can't remember did they just call them hybrids? I can't I think there was a name for it. Wow You know what we're talking about especially for watchers. Yeah, I love those movies. Yeah, those movies were great It's otherwise known as the demon child and it's another mythical creature in Philippine mythology They are said to be babies who die before being baptized after death It goes to a place called limbo, which is neither heaven nor quite hell They are transformed into evil spirits the phantasm returns to our world as these demonic goblin like creatures looking to eat their human victims He'll also be an offspring of a demon and a human most tnx I said to live in the forest where they do see a human they were transformed into what's like a normal baby Just lying on the ground naturally most people will try and aid a helpless baby in the forest when they get close though That's when a demon child changes back to its true form and kills the helpless human Next to number four now we have a son I'd pun it Aid a baby in the forest. I'm not in the forest in the first place But if you're hiking in the forest and you see it is to ran a baby. Yeah, you'd be a baby freaking out But you'd go help it. I would probably but I'd be like okay What happened to your mom and dad? Yeah, once it's like where is this giant monster that ate them? Yeah You know, it's like there's a number of things that I'd be freaking out about I'd be like yeah But no, I definitely would go and try to help LA University This place is known as a place of learning around the country But locals know it has a lot of dark stories within its walls the main building is said to be haunted by soldiers who died bloody deaths in world war two But chapel in this building was used by refugee families many of whom were massacre by Japanese soldiers I swear it's a set to live in these rooms. It's very um What's the word I'm looking for um Western now like almost southern style like a Southern Like a plantation plantation home is what it kind of looks like I really like that. Okay, let's go back. So G families many of whom were massacre by Japanese soldiers I swear it's a set to live in these rooms. They called home for a while in modern times students have reported strange Happenings in the chapel one of them involved an accounting student visiting the chapel to pray before a big exam as he sattled into one of the Puse she had footsteps coming towards her which suddenly stopped then she felt a pair of hands of her face And when she opened her eyes there before her was a man in a torn and bloodied soldiers uniform He had a banner in his chest and was gurgling for help through the pool of blood in his mouth When telling the story to her friends she assured them she knew it was a ghost But she had never seen anything so real in front of her and just so terrifying Moving on to number three now we have the jettish blackout on the 7th 1999 in the city of Luzon most of the lights went out the city was plunged into darkness Authorities said a large number of jellyfish have been sucked into the seawater intake of a major power plant near Manila Clogging up the mechanism reports We had to spread that it wasn't just normal jellyfish that caused a blockage It was giant mutant ones they've been sucked up from the bowels of the ocean. Could you imagine Seeing one of those Like in person. Yeah, yeah, I can imagine that would be creepy I can imagine a lot of and then you touch it and then you die I got a pretty big imagination And as soon as the blockage was cleared it would begin terrorizing the cities of water. Yeah, that'd be terrifying I'm pretty serious below people some say that's where they remain However, okay, this was a actual horrible story but I Think the small ones are the more dangerous ones like I don't mean that like a snake, you know where the venom and stuff but I think like the most like deadly What are those called jellyfish? Thank you. I think the most deadly ones are like they're really small I forget what they're called I literally was watching something on take talk about them and How they will like just because there's so many it's all about the quantity But I could be completely wrong. I don't know. I've just fallen what I learned on tiktok The place to learn the place to learn today multiplying in numbers In appropriate things The doors of the Philippines the mythical creatures set to live in small hills around the country the mountains are small That's exactly the same thing come out a specific times six a.m. 12 p.m. 6 p.m. 12 a.m. And so we're all who did your Want to know this hideous teeth long white hair and very angry eyes They are said to bring you fortune or bad luck most people would rather avoid them altogether One story of them came a guy who was burning old coconuts on a farm. It was around 6 p.m. He saw something shiny around the bushes it blinked furiously as he approached the bushes Something crawled out of it towards him standing there was a duende He offered him a gold ring and told him to keep it even though he didn't want to He remembered his mumma told him that if he ever sees anything out of the ordinary when Interact me one of these creatures just leave it big then the creature snapped his fingers and disappeared Some people say if you take something something they will always be for something in there and it will be a whole lot of trouble for you to get it And finding the number one now we have the capri he is also known as the smoking monster his legendary creature It's said to be as big as a two-story building and hairy all over it lies dormant in an old large tree in the forest Generally speaking they are friendly creatures But I'm going to a point you see the capri love to smoke tobacco They almost always have some sort of cigar burning away when travelers go to the mountains or the woods They should be wary of the capri if he sees a beautiful woman walking past his tree He will blow smoke out until it becomes an intoxicating cloud around her at that point She will lose consciousness and he will kidnap her if he tries to fight or if someone tries to save her The capri will get violent Likewise the way to make a capri very angry is to destroy his home or indeed any tree in that forest When loggers mow down a hole forest and smoke is seen spiraling up from the ashes They say the cloud of the capri is looking for its next victim Well there we go That might make a decent movie It's very rapey kind of stuff Yeah Like knock her out, take her home It's like Mmm Were these all bar stories back in the day? Yeah No, I think that last one could be a decent movie though Yeah, I can see that It could be a terrible movie as well Oh yeah, it depends on how much their budget is Yeah And who's writing it for that matter Yeah guys, let us know if there's any other urban legends that you want us to react to If there's any Urban legends that are like so lengthy that they could make one video Yeah As opposed to listening to multiple And less in depth And not necessarily urban legends but really scary stories That would be better Yeah, I mean which I think most scary stories start out as Urban legends Some form of urban legends It's kind of like a Texas chainsaw massacre Right That's 100% urban Yeah It wasn't in Texas It was in like Wisconsin Yeah, it was somewhat weird But yet You can drive down I-35 And the house that they used is there Yeah And you're like Okay This is real as the Texas Steakhouse Right Which is based out of I want to say Cleveland or something like that But their first location was in Indiana So it made no sense Yeah guys, so let us know in the comments Throw them down there Also in the description There's a link to our discord Go to the discord Throw them in our video suggestion box And chat with everybody and have some fun in there too I agree And with that being said My name's Miles My name is Fez Thanks for watching guys Peace out
