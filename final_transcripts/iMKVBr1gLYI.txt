Thanks to Gavin Mack for helping me film it. And thanks to you guys at home for watching. Don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you in the next one. Look, I wish I could say I wasn't expecting that, but I 100% was expecting that. Yeah. Because I know whenever we walk around in Makati or whatever Manila, wherever we are, you always bound to find somebody that is just randomly singing. And it's so, so nice. Yeah. People are just so skilled. I don't know. It's a genetics or the people learn to sing in school already. I don't know what it is, but for the Peanuts, pretty much all Filipinos can sing. Comparing Filipinos to Austrians, I think it's valid if I say Filipinos are very, very talented. Yeah. I've not met many people in Austrians who can sing. No, it would never happen that somebody just randomly sings on the streets in Austrians. No, that's not happening. I really love the courage that Graham has to walk up to people to ask them to sing. And also, huge, huge shout out to those who are just willing to share some good vibes with his community. And, um, sing for us. That's so nice. Yeah. Oh, really? I love this video. Yeah. Guys, check out his channel. It's linked down below. I think we'll feature a few of his videos. Yeah, exactly. I really love this episode. And just seeing people having fun singing. Well done, you guys. Check out a few of his videos. And if you see one that you especially like, send it to us on Instagram, making it up. And vlog. Nelly's live underline. And the line tell us.
