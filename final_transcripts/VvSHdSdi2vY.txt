 Alright, welcome back to Manila and welcome to Marraquina. We have come here to meet with a local Filipino food blogger and she is going to show us around some of her favourite restaurants in this area. Starting with Lola Helen Pancherteria, let's go and check it out. Hello, this is Kate. Hello, how are you doing? I think it's going to be easy to say, let me say something to Arora. I'm Kia Puri Mama Peeche, I do food blogs, travel food around the world, specifically in the Philippines and Singapore for now. I'm here touring this beautiful family here in Marraquina city. This is the shoe capital of the Philippines by the way. It's around seventy percent of the shoes in the entire country. It comes from here. We're going to show you the first shoe that was made in the Philippines. It was in the house that I'm going to show you lately. Oh really? Let's go. Alright, let's eat. Alright, so, what are we talking about now? This is a stir fried Filipino noodles. It's mixed yellow and burnt jelly noodles with crispy pork. We call it unsweetened liqueur. It's a very good combination of sweet and sour cream. Alright, so, what are we talking about now? This is a stir fried Filipino noodles. It's mixed yellow and burnt jelly noodles with crispy pork. We call it unsweetened liqueur. So, there's a liqueur in the pan, which is the crispy pork. It's so good. You have to try it as this and then later you have to squeeze some calamansi. Okay. It's going to be very good. Our culture is not very spicy, so it's always on the side. Nice. I'm just going to take a big old one for everything I guess. And put it like the mass. Ah. You want to see my daddy? Yeah. I'm going to get the big one. I can actually really taste the pork. Are you hungry? How is it? It's a pizza. You just witnessed something that hasn't happened in about 20 years right now, which is in a new table. It's almost eating pork now. Welcome to the Philippines. Maybe in the Philippines. You'll see pork everywhere. Alright, so it's on to the next spot. We should be going to a total of five different places at least. Oh no, the balloon! So I have a feeling that these take away bags. I'm going to have probably five of them by the end of today. Yeah, I'm excited to try some proper Filipino food. So having a rice cake, they call it the bibinka namalagkit sticky rice cake. Oh, this is what it looks like. I feel like it has sweet and shakow. Really? Yeah, I think so. They have a smaller portion for this. Alright. Let's take a sec. Maybe? So it's twice after I remember the name. What's the name? Bibinka, bibinka, malinket. Malinket. I like it. What did you like? I like it. It's more like this. What? It's more like this. Oh, that's sweet. I like it. I prefer it to a mango sticky rice. Like in Thailand, you know, it's all mango sticky rice. Not a fan of that because it's really coconut. Whereas this one has like more of a caramel. You want some more? No, it's fine. Alright, I'll mine them. I'll mine them. I'll mine them. What we are right now is actually Marikina public market. You have everything from the food stores where you can eat all local cuisine, to the sweet stores, to stores that sell dog food and clothes. Basically everything. It actually reminds me a lot of San Jose central market. And it's very, very similar to this. I have a similar feel. Lots of energy and different smells and things to see. So, that's really cool. I love coming places like this. Alright, so we're in a very famous place right now here in Marikina. This building behind me, apparently, according to Key, so if it's wrong, it's her fault. This building behind me is where the first shoe was made here in the Philippines. So it's a very historic building. And what is it now? Museum? It's a museum now. Okay, so now it's a museum. So, come and check it out if you're into shoes. It's not a shoe. No, no, sky. The dog. Sorry, I don't know if it's a shoe. He doesn't know who's lying. He doesn't know who's a shoe. He doesn't know who's a shoe. He's not about that life. I see the sky. She's here. This one. There he is. Alright, next stop, we are in a place called Gotto Garaje, which apparently is famous for the porridge dishes. But they also do a lot of Filipino breakfasts and various different things. No sign outside, no nothing. You would walk past this place and not even realize it. Yeah. Which is why it's so amazing exploring with somebody that knows the area. The chaos behind me is unbelievable. I don't know if you can hear me right now. Hi. Hi. This is chaotic. With kids, it's so intense. Are you ready for some Filipino porridge? I think we're actually going to try a lot more things here. We're really going to have a Sunday today. Sunday and Holy Week. So yeah, we're going to sit here and try a lot of pizza. And I have a big tablecloth. Nice. We can pick from beef, first before, like wheat pork and a pasta Filipino hotdog. You only find this in a burrito. Okay, so then we'll get a hot soup. I appreciate that there's pictures with everything. It makes it easy for us to pick. Definitely. Let's say for example, hello, hello, is more of a dessert, right? Yes, it is. Would you have it at, you would have it after your food or you order everything together. Okay. So, and then I guess it is the same with the banana as well. That's a dessert. Yeah, the tree of this. One, two, and three. Those are the results. So, so we're going to get goto. Yeah. Goto and... Not what bar. Talk about bar boy. That's the tofu and this before. Can you say that? Good. Can you say that line? Talk about bar boy. Love it. Okay. And then what's up with it? Like a deep fried. Only a lemon and a lot of it in your bowl. And Linga is on point at times. Okay. I actually love the fact that we can order a bunch of things. Let's go. And then beans sprouts. All right. I think you should spread it. Like a spring roll kind of thing. Let's get one of those as well. And then what else do you recommend? This is a pineapple. It's also a pineapple. It's a famous Filipino snack. Filipino spaghetti. What's Filipino about this? If it has sausage, it's a Filipino. All right. Now, Linga is going to take us to know what each of these dishes are. Yeah. So this one is... a pineapple. A pineapple. A pineapple? Yes. Okay. Okay. Goto. Goto. Hello. Hello. Banana coniello. Banana coniello. Tockwad ba boy. Chocolate ba boy. Hat silo. Hat silo. It's nice to have you. You doubt it. How's the food? Turn on the heat. Yeah. What can you taste right now? Egg. Egg, okay? All right. Talk to me about the flavors. Mmm. Good. Nice. Good, okay? Wow. Oh my gosh. Wow. You guys are hungry. All right. So this is Yudu's Lushre and Pace. Let's go. It's very colorful. It's a must. Calamans are lime. The lime. Most noodles in the Philippines need calamansi. Okay. And now all of the eggs. Shoulder. Alive. Nice. Oops. Sorry egg. And then... We want some of this. This guy. It's going to be messy. How's that tomato? You don't have much tomato you want. Maybe so too. Mmm. Yeah. Look at calamans. It's good. We have a new respect for lime. Cheers. Cheers. We just lost our batteries. Do you think? That's inside some maggi. You'll be pleased to know there is no onion in there. It's not maggi. It's soy sauce. Just put it in here a little bit. It's not. Eating the five rolls. It's salty. It's a little bit of lettuce. It's a chaos. But the spring rolls delicious. Okay. I'm calling it a spring roll. Let's mix it. You're in the Philippines. Everything goes with vinegar. Oh. All right. I can grab it. Okay. Good warm maggi on top. Is that because I put the maggi on top please. Yeah. It's... Yeah it works. Oh this one is egg. Oh it's good. Oh it's good. Oh it's good. Oh it's good. Okay. That's good. So we're on to Halo Halo. We actually had a comment on one of our videos the other day that said like why haven't you tried Halo Halo yet. So this is for you. Who? Who? Who? And Halo Halo means mix mix apparently. You have to mix it in. Oh really? Then the ice you have to like crush it up. Am I supposed to make a mess with it as well? Malia super nervous right now. Yeah me too. All right and then I just take a spoonful and get in there like this. Yeah. Yeah. It's rather than half to me. Flavors, textures. It's like a rollercoaster of emotions right now. Oh yeah. I know. So much going on. Let's review it together. What is this? Wow. I don't know how to feel. I don't know how to feel like this before. And then I'm supposed to eat the ice or not. Eat the ice yeah. Crush it up. The ice is intense. So it here is beans. Yeah I'm hoping that. No no no. Oh yeah. There's beans. Yeah. I've never had anything like it in my life. It's nice but it's really confusing. It's my broken into my mouth so I'm like. We like beans on our breakfast and this all right. We never seen beans inside a milkshake looking dessert. I have 100% appreciated and like I love dessert all over the world. And I'm the first to try them. I like it. It's good. Try that. It's very sweet. What do you think? It should be the honest one. We don't know. We don't know. It's good and bad. It's her honest review. And the things we have very different are our own desserts. They're very different. I like it. Let's move on. This. That also a bit more the ice. We can just really quickly try it. You can just think about it. Are you supposed to drink the juice? Can I try it? I'm so confused right now. All right there, my dear. I like it. You're trying, my dear. This is really good. Mommy. And then tell the camera what you think. It's good. It's good. It's better than the other one. Better than the other one. Okay. We haven't actually did it. You didn't like it. So she doesn't like how to halve but she does like what's this one again? Banana connois. Banana connois. It's sweet, huh? Yeah, it's like a sweet tea. Yeah, that's what that's all I mean. It's perhaps this is very confusing because it's like mixing different things in one bowl which is so unusual and the ice was well once again. I really appreciate it. And I love trying it. I personally prefer this one. Stop. Stop. Go ahead. It is because I like it very sweet. Let's take it over there. Suddenly they're interested in the food. I wonder why. On to the... Barboi. Barboi. My eyes are like... So now this one is the Takwook Barboi. It's a mix of crispy pork and tofu. So you can eat this. You can eat ham with this. And your favorite. So I think we're just the... It's a dish to go with this. It goes with this. Okay, fantastic. So I meant to eat them together. That makes a lot of sense. Okay. Alright. I'm into it. I like it. I really like that. Yeah? It actually looks really nice. It's really good. I approve of this one. Yeah. Yeah. And you just put it straight on top? Yes. Yeah, I'm put a little bit of chili oil. A bit of chili oil. That's crispy garlic. Okay. So we call it Chomai. Chomai. Yeah. And you just put it straight on top? Yes. Yeah, I'm put a little bit of chili oil. A bit of chili oil. Yeah, crispy garlic. Okay. So we call it Chomai. Chomai. That's homemade. I can't. I'm hoping that you like it.

I think I'm going to buy you from... From the UK. And then I drizzle this on top. Yeah. It's all crispy, it's behind us. All right. So there it is. Chomai. Of course. It's funny all the way through here. But I have to tilt my... Okay. I'll come down here. Okay. All right. Chomai cheers. Cheers. Cheers. How is that? So hot. Did I put you much chili beer?
