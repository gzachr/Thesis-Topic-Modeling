 Magandog, Gabi, and Kamustikah from Manila Philippines. So this is country number two for me and couldn't be more excited and grateful to be here. Just getting off the flight here from Bangkok. It is 9pm later than I usually like to fly. But cannot wait to see what the Philippines has in store for me. So come with me on this journey as I take you around on my first day and my first night here in the Philippines specifically Manila. Just had to do the e-health code. It was pretty easy. You just fill out this e-health form before you get to Manila. And then you scan a QR code with two seconds. Now just getting to immigration. And in less than 10 minutes I am through immigration. So yes, we are officially in the Philippines. Kamustikah, Manandog, Gabi, I just watched that. But I'll figure out the word and Salamat to you. So, all right, so let's do this. Here you go. Vogue? Vogue, yes, hello. You too. Where you going today? Where am I going? Going to Benando. Yes. Manila only. Yes. What's your content? I do travel content. For food. You're familiar. Yeah, zine travel. Zine! Can we take picture with you? Of course. Wait, do you guys know? Yes, no, but you many times. No way. I think I found you, Randall. Later. Okay, okay, later. Zine, what food please? Zine, ZIN. Z-A-F-O-L-E-N-E. Z-A-N-E. Z-N-E. Zanin. Yes, travel. Travel. New subscriber? I will. All right. Not this one. There it is. Yes. I already subscribed. Thank you. Salamad. All right. Got some new subscribers here, guys. Look at me up with the data card. Jain, look. Look at the board. The board is good. Yeah, I like Bangkok. Yeah, it was nice. So do you guys recommend I take a grab from here? Yeah, much better. Much better. Will they come here? Yeah. All right, well, be 15. Be 15. Okay. Don't just meet the taxi to expand. Okay. I like the traffic. Thank you. So I've got unlimited data here for 15. For one month? Yes. With goals. Yes, with calls. For 1500 pesos, which is roughly 20-35. 30 dollars? Yeah. So I will take that. All right. Very friendly. It's a card people. I just got my business. About $27, including the SIM card. For unlimited data for 30 days. Now I have to get myself a grab here. Day 15. I've got to say, if you are coming to Manila, you're going to be a grab. It's very easy. You'll be here in two minutes. Much faster than when I had to get a taxi from Suwanabame airport in Bangkok. So, yeah, definitely like that so far. The Kanzang Gabi. How are you? I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. What's your name? Zhen. Zhen, yes. Zhen. Zhen. Zhen, yes. Zhen. Zhen. So, about a 40-minute grab ride cost me $7.87, and I believe the Rhmada is right around the corner here, which is where I am staying. Maybe this is it. Hello, Ramada. Yes. Thank you. Salamad. Salamad, thank you. So, here we are. The Ramada. Just about to get checked in here. Hello, how are you? Checking in? Yes. So, I'll check in here. At the Ramada. So, interestingly enough, both the grab driver and the front desk guy here at the Ramada. It told me to be very careful. Here, walking at night. So, I was thinking about going out. I still might. I'm not very hungry, but I'm not tired. And I would like to continue doing this vlog. Mostly pickpockets. I don't think I'll have any other issues. But, let's take a look at this room here. This room costs me roughly $60 per night here. And I've noticed that a lot of other YouTubers use the Ramada. So, that is how I found out about this hotel. I will say there's a bit of a strange smell in here. But, regardless, this is interesting. So, I'm in Benondo, which is the oldest Chinatown in the world. Which is what I just learned. Literally, I knew it was a Chinatown, but I did not know if the oldest Chinatown in the world. So, anyway, here is the bathroom. Nice and big. Shower. Mirror. At the hotel again here. Of course, you got the classic bomb done. And, of course, you need a phone next to the toilet. So, nice place to work. Bed feels comfortable, but normal for Asia. In that it is a bit hard. And, you can't see, because it's dark. Not really much of a view. But, this is what we have. Welcome to the Philippines. Now, I think we are indeed going to go out. Although, I'm not hungry. I am very thirsty. So, I think we're going to go try to find ourselves some water to drink. Definitely not alcohol right now, because I'm not feeling it. I'm going to find some water to drink here. Now, before I left Bangkok, I'm talking kind of quiet, because I'm in the lobby of my hotel. So, where is the first one? Before I left Bangkok, I exchanged my remaining Thai bot for Filipino paces, which was about... I think this comes out to about $160. At the airport, I did not do an ATM pool. So, I will do an ATM pool in the morning. I do not want to do that tonight, given the repeated warnings that I received thus far in an hour into my trip. So, let's see what's around the corner here. And film some stuff. Hello sir. Hello sir. Salamad, thank you. Hello, pal. Thank you. Oh, right. And here we are. Chinatown. The world's oldest. Chinatown. So, I noticed there's another 7-11. I think about five minutes down the street. Let's just go check it out. Because... Now a lot of things are open right now. And... I'm not very tired. I'm not hungry anyway. But I would like to... get something to drink, because I'm dehydrated from that flight. I genuinely have no idea how to get across this train here. Wow. There's the first Jeep. Jeep knee I've seen. So, Jeep knees are a pretty unique thing to Manila from my understand. But that was a Jeep knee that you just heard. I think we will ride one of those during my time here in Manila. But... No idea how I get over to this 7-11. Maybe over here. Yeah, I'm interested in being up when I asked my grab driver what he would recommend I do. He said casinos. So, we're just making our way over here. So... Very interesting. That was the main recommendation. Take a look at this. Got a little night straight here. I have no idea if I should be over here or not. It is approaching 11. I normally not out this late. But... We are tonight. So... This is kind of cool. Kind of lit area here. Sure it's even better during the day. Alright. I'm going to go over to this crosswalk. Cross that way. So... Very good old McDonald's. And of course, down there you have Jolly B. You know if you can see that. And some restaurant called Chao King. There's no idea. Alright, well I think we're going to try to make our way here. And... Get over this way. Okay. Now from here. Getting all turned around. So... Now this video might continue in the morning. We shall see. But... Welcome. And... We have a lot more options here. For... Water. Take a look at the local beer here. I don't even know what the beer is. And... I don't think that is going to be... I think it's in the go. I don't know. But I... Myself. Tonight. And looking for some type of water. Mineral water. Yeah. This looks like the one for me. Alright, so... 7-11 bag. We do not have plastic here. But I'm going to make my way back to the... Hello! So a lot. I'm going to make my way back to the Ramata. And... It might take you along the way. Where am I not? We're approaching... Still approaching 11 p.m. here. So... I gotta say, people here in Philippines are extremely friendly. And... I've known that about the Philippines in doing some research. But it's definitely... Definitely living up to the hype. Magandug, Tagali, and Kamushtaka. Ah, here once again from Manila. So it is the next day here. And I still consider this to be my first day in Manila. Because it hasn't even been 24 hours yet. So let's go out and see what is going on here. It is around 12-15. So I had a very late start this morning. I had to catch up on some sleep and do some work. But... Yeah, let's go out and get some food. See what's out there. Guys, listen. I don't know if you can hear the bells. Ah, they're just stopping. They were going for... Quates some time. So this is the view that I could not see last night of Bonondo. And... Yeah. Really nice bells. I got a gym here in the second floor. Definitely needing to get that. I just realized having a coffee today. Not good, folks. Hello. Musica, how are you? Good. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Let's see what we have here. Super friendly people working here. So you can see a shot of... It's not even sounding that afternoon now. And... Way different than when I was here last night. But what I need to do is I need to get an ATM. I need to find an ATM. I do have enough cash for food, so maybe we'll do that. But this looks really popular spot here. I also like to get some soup dumplings as well. So what is this place? So that place looks extremely popular. We might come back and take that up at some point. But do I see any ATM over there? I do. So let us make our way here. And... Yeah, so now... I do recommend... Anytime... Use an ATM that you pool. That way it's not a card scammer. Because that could be people with a fake. I'm going to turn off the camera for the... I also recommend that when you put your card in... You do not put your card details upwards. In other words, make sure that you can... That you cannot see your debit card number. Make sure you always... When you take out your card, you... Keep it hidden because there's always a CCTV. And you have no idea if... Somebody is viewing you from the CCTV. Many people will have their card details taken or stolen from the CCTV. So I would recommend that when you've an ATM, especially abroad, that you be very careful about what details you show around an ATM. Alright, I'm on the hunt for two things. Number one is coffee because I'm at that point in my consumption where I need coffee. And number two is soup dumplings. So let's get on this. Somehow... You got this quickly spots. Coffee jelly. I don't know that I'm feeling coffee jelly right now. Potato corner looks good. Let's see what else we have here. Hello. And this looks really cool today. Yesterday I wasn't really sure what was going on or what to think of this area. But... This... What's happening? River. So actually I turned around to... I am thinking that there might be a coffee spot over here. Rice and noodle house. That looks quite good. I've got five days here in Bonondo. And we're going to be doing a lot of... I'm going to be doing a lot of exploring here. That was the nicest person I've ever seen with a massive shotgun in a house. And we're going to be doing a lot of exploring here in Chinatown and around. So make sure that you stay... Stay subscribed here. And I got to say... So far people here are just so friendly. So I knew that before. I came here but you got to experience it yourself. Looks like there's some type of like planter and festival going on. Hello. Here as well. Now I have read that Manila potentially has the worst traffic in the world. So we'll see if that is something to watch out for. You know what? I walked right back past the cafe. So there's a cafe in Guadalajara. And we can get that at the top. So let's get ourselves a coffee at Guadalajara. Okay, do I wait? I'll be waiting for Anandos oldest fast food. And it looks like there's some pretty real dumplings there. So maybe we do. But there's also another place here called Big Bowl Noodle. Which sounds like I could also get down with that. Let's see. What is down here? Hello. It's like we've got like some sort of market here. Fresh vegetables. Fresh vegetables. Nice food here. Sweet food. Fruits. Everything looks really good. And a bookstore here. That's a well. Excuse me. I'm reading here. Just seeing what you see about. Hello. Books, card items. It's like here is like a stationary and stuff. But let's take a look at what's up here. Wow. Get all of these books. I think I'm the only one here. Hamlet. Study guide. Okay. Always interested in a good bookstore. But I've delayed my eating window by way too much. So that's how to go eat. So I've looked a lot up to 100 times. But I think my original goal was to get some soup dumplings. I'm just going to wait in line. I'm not going to fall over. It's approaching 2 p.m. So I might take some time. But I think we will wait. Here. Oh man. I should have just came earlier. But we will wait. I would have just decided earlier. I would have had a better spot than you. But it is what it is. See, it's so popular. And this place is called Chuan-Di. Banando is the oldest fast food. We've got some street ice cream here. You guys look into business. Tempted. I don't know why I'm doing this to myself. I'm waiting here for like 30 minutes. I'm hungry. Stimpty. It's really tempting. I can't. There's the menu. I don't know if you can see this. It's kind of blowing in the beans. But definitely get a good coffee. I'm going to have a good time. Definitely get a good... Thank you. You too. I've got a helper here. Definitely going to get some pork soup dumplings. What are you guys going to get? I don't know yet. You don't know yet? Yeah. Looks all good. The pork dumplings I think are the best. Xiaolong Bao. Xiaolong Bao. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Salamack. Salamack. Thank you. Okay, great. Thank you. Alright, we're finally in after about 40 minutes. Hello. The soup dumplings, pork soup dumplings, pork Xiaolong Bao. One order. And then what is the difference between pork assado and the lexan? This one is combined with assado and lexan. This is lexan, lexan, lexan, lexan. So it's just like this doesn't have sauce? With sauce. Is this spicy? Which one is spicy? Sweet sauce. That's spicy. Is this one? Oh, I'm not this sweet. Okay, okay. What would you recommend? This one's ours. Okay, let's go. Let's go with that one. And then I'll do a mango shake. Yes, everything. Okay, I'll do one of those. One order. Yes, please. And I think that's all for right now. Okay, thank you. Everything for 30 minutes there. Okay. Alright, Salamack. Thank you. Alright. So we're here at the bar. And you can see it's packed. So I got myself soup dumplings. Lexan, which is a big Filipino food you have to try. And a mango shake. And I might get some more food after it. Because I'm not consumed any calories today. So I'm very hungry. I waited 40 minutes for this. So. Lexan, I believe. First time trying Lexan, we'll see. I think he's cutting it up there. It feels very authentic experience. Okay, I think experience here. Lots going on. I want to try everything. But saving some room for later, I think. Maybe not. We'll see. Alright, so here's the Lexan. Here's the Lexan. Thank you. Okay, Asada. Thank you. Game of sauce. And boy, does this look good? I'm going to have to dig in. Not a lot of room, because I'm right where they're cooking here. But we'll go in. I'm so hungry. So. Sauce smells good. Lexan is like a fatty pork. What I understand. It's a Filipino food that you have to try. So. Here it is. Thank you, sir. Here it is. Let's go in with the sauce for the first one. Oh, yeah. Oh, man. It's got a real good. This is so fatty, juicy. The skin is crunchy. The pork skin on the outside is crunchy. As you can see here. Well, it's good. Alright, let's dip it in the sauce here. And, oh, man, look at this sauce. Wow. Oh, yeah. You guys do it with the sauce. So, I think, pickled vegetables here. Yeah. Which I have come to love pickled vegetables. Oh, this is good. I mean, here's the soup dumplings. They're very good. They told me they're extremely hot. So, I think we're going to keep going at this lexan here. Which we've got to try. And the asada sauce is so good. It's a sweet, spicy sort of tangy. Not very spicy, but more of a sweet tangy. So, here are the soup dumplings. They actually told me to soup dumplings with the spoon. Oh, yeah. It's up to beyond it. So, I've never had well-ventic Chinese soup dumplings where Xiao Bin bow, wow, I believe it's worth their buck. Try the sauce. It's good. Oh, yeah. Even better with the sauce. The sauce is sort of like, there's like a brown sugar in this sauce. Yeah. Still eating this work. Man, this is worth the wait. It's trying here with the spoon. Get them in this sauce here. Mmm. Mmm. It's so good. And last but not least, soup dumplings. The chone has been finished. The chone. Definitely full. Definitely happy. And we're just waiting on a mega smoothie. And I'm not sure I should have ordered. It's not so full. And here we are. Got the mega smoothie. Actually, I came in time for dessert. Here's 500. You can keep. You can keep. Yeah. What is this? So we got the smoothie to go. Thank you. Salamad, thank you. Smoothie to go. Definitely feeling full. And I'm playing a lay chan. Soup dumplings. The smoothie cost me 485 pesos. I'm 500. So I'm still trying to figure out the math here. I think that's $110. Yes, it is $9.00 and the eating sense is what that meal cost me. If I didn't tip, it'd probably be like $9. Oh my god, I have the most intense case of brain freeze from this mango shake. Oh, it's good though. It's kind of wandering here, enjoying the sights and sounds. Let me tell you folks, this is a new type of chaos. But different than Bangkok, just say so many people here. So friendly. So friendly, really enjoying my first 24 hours here. So guys, first and foremost, I'm just walking around here. Hello. It's a Tonyo. This is just everywhere I go. It's amazing. I'm walking around here and there's just so many little open-air markets here. Kind of just not sure where I am. And that's okay. Another thing I've noticed, there's like the mountain dew. You know the soda? Seems to be very popular. Oh, here's a casino. We might have to go in there and I doubt that the levy film. But we might need to go in there. All right, we're just going to go for it here. Wow. Hey, hello sir. Wow, this is a new dopamine online. So much going on. Hello there. What I mean by that is just the sights, the sounds, the energy. I mean, those are... And I just seem to be walking, finding my way on these cool little walking streets here. Ooh, look at this. We've got crystals and gems. Look. Look at this. I wonder if I'm allowed to film here. But I've gone in trouble for that before. Fortunately, GoPro's overheating here. It's freaking scorcher here. And I had a really good conversation with somebody that didn't get recorded. But he told me right now is the time that you say Magon Don, hapon. So hello. This is a really cool street. So many things going on here. So here's what I was talking about. This Filipino mountain view. Different bottle looks different. Haven't had a mountain view in ages. I don't really drink so much. They didn't want to be filmed, which is fine. It was 20 pesos. There's only one left, which means it was for me. So let me get this open here. I'm not in the mood for all the day, so Mountain Dew will. Have to supply a school. Oh my god. Wow, is that good? Look at how green it is. I think it's the bottle, honestly. Hmm. Cool. Wow, is that good? Only 78 calories, which is strange, because normally Mountain Dew is a lot more, but I think this is a smaller bottle. Hmm. Oh my god. 20 pesos, which is, I don't know, not even 50 cents. You know, at first I was questioning whether or not I made the right choice and going to Pinondo first. I'm not questioning that anymore. Very glad I decided to choose Pinondo. I choose Pinondo as my first place, because my god is it crazy. Mind you, is it Thursday? It's Thursday here? Can't imagine what it's like on the weekends. And I think around the corner we've got this casino. So let's see if they let me film in there. If they do, we're going to roll the dice a little bit, ladies and gentlemen. Backer rats. Ooh, it looks cool. I doubt that they'll let me film. But let's see. Here it is. Pinondo is satellite. So let me see if they let me film. All right. Can I film? So that casino is pretty locked down. I could not get any footage in there. That's okay. You're curious. It's been 1200 pesos, I believe it's $12. Maybe a little bit less, a little bit more, around $10. Didn't win. It's okay. The scenes are not set up to be in your favor. I'm seeing this supermarket here. See what they have. This is interesting. We continue our trend of drinking soda, probably not. But is that not the most interesting dope bottle you ever had? There you've ever seen. Maybe we have to get one. All right. So here's this unique stand of coat. Let's give this shot. I also got... We'll just find a place to drink this. I also got... One of my favorite drinks I discovered in Bangkok, which is called Kokari Sweat. Also sugary, but more of an electrolyte drink. Let's see if coat tastes different here. Like you would expect. But in a really cool can. It costs me 179 pesos for this bottle of coke. It's a little interesting can of coke and... Kokari Sweat. Which is almost probably about $2 or so. A really cool milk tea spot. I have to come back here. Hello. All right. So it wraps up my first day here in Manila. Amazing first day. I have a lot to say. And I think a lot more to do here. In the city and in the neighborhood of the Philippines. It's so much to be here. And I'm going to certainly be talking to you again soon. Peace.
