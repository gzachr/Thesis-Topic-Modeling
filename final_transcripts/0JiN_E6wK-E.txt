 I feel horribly guilty about eating a burger last night. Like I smashed down the burger. What I want me to be in this one. Yeah yeah. So I've punished myself, I've given myself an absolutely soul destroying, soul destroying gym work. I'm not going to work. I'm trying not to lift. But we have got the cooler road trip coming up this afternoon. Scott says now we'll wake to him up and we'll get started. Good morning everyone at day number two here in the Philippines. We are almost ready to go. Almost. The other car is here. Good morning. Nice. I have my banana bag, my blankie. You ready to go? I have my banana bag, my blankie. You ready to go? I have my banana bag, my blankie. You ready to go? Stay at number two in the Philippines. Here we are packing all our stuff to drive all the way south. Again, not all the way south. A bit south of Manila and have a no-till road trip with all of these beautiful people. Oh yeah. Nice. Faking time. Very nice. In the Philippines we are going to eat because we haven't had breakfast yet and we are super, super hungry. And here we are. We're walking over to the Philippines. We're here. We're walking over to the restaurant that Nelly and Mike wants us to really see. So, what excited to eat? Oh my god. Look at all these donuts. Oh my god. This place looks great. And this is our table. Even the gimbal has a seat. Oh yeah. Bread and butter. This is so hungry. Oh my god. Thank you. Sir, would you have a little of my pasta in the middle? Of course. That's kind of essential, right? I think you're a lot better. A lot better. A lot better. Guys packing the last final essentials. Don't you love it when the traffic is not in your line? No, no, there's another boat. The late last boat 11 p.m. No. And Nelly? Is it a different port? Yeah, Alabama. Only. I have to go to Canada. I have to go to the beach. It's 6 p.m. Okay. Calapan is later. I'm going to have to have a spare time. Prebiktop. Calapan? Yeah, go left, go left. Turn left. Okay. Prebiktop. That's fine, thank you Nora. Hello. Calapan. Calapan. Calapan. We're with car, yes. Yeah, we are. Thank you. Makeup. What is the train leaving? Car inspection time. Makeup. Makeup. Make one. It's a boy. Hey, is it crazy? Yeah. Yeah, that's crazy. That's crazy. Yeah, I'm going to have to have a spare time. Yeah. Wooo! I'm going to have to have a spare time. What's the spare time? I'm going to have to have a spare time. Yeah, it's crazy, I'm going to have to have a spare time. All right, we're going to go to ferry. Go to the warriors. Warriors. Jesse. Yeah. Yeah. So right now we have just a half car up. We have had underneath the ferry. Not underneath it, but inside the ferry. And we've got our vapors to the hip stairs for the one and a half hour ferry. Hopefully one and a half hours only. Alright, so this is the ferry of the Christmas Eve. Yeah. Alright, it's Christmas. They say Christmas comes early in the Philippines and now we're right. Yes. And this is the beautiful, lovely happy New York's here. And which, some burger. And cheese. But mostly pin-up curry. Okay, the ferry has just left. It's about 10% full. There's nobody else on it. Really, I've got nice and a car. There's the port. It's going to take us about one and a half hours to get there. Two hours. We've just been looking out some online. We've been using Airbnb. And we're just trying to book our stuff now before the ferry left. I'm not sure if the girls did it in time, but we're going to go inside and check now. They did. I'm going to go to that ice-claw fridge over there and buy an air-riching professional beer myself. I'm going to go to the use selling out. Yes. I want. And that's real life. Oh, on the laptops. We're vloggers. We're filming Christmas trees. I'm going to go to my vlogging friends. Here's the crew. Just wrapped everything up. We're in. So guys, we had a little bit of sleep in this morning. We had the curvy of the late night last night with our friends. Then we got a day because we were gathering today. And now we have lunch and go to the ward. We kept working. We kept packing. We got on the road, got in the car, and then we took off to go to the shore. We were always to get here to the up-to-going ferry. We just spent one and a half hours on. And now we have a minute to do a different flight for that properly. Right here. We've got one more hour to drive. Anyway, we'll be there at Airbnb for tonight. Hey, Pierre. Oh, such a shot. Good morning, Jutt. We don't have enough cameras. So, are you feeling eating, Mitch? Well, we saw some green doing that here. I might try it, but there's always a 7-11 at the end of an all-plan. Hopefully we find it 7-11. So there's always a 7-11. We need you to end up not having food. Okay, we're looking at this option. 2-1. Oh my god. So much. Chicken. Night number one, Nelly chose this Airbnb. And we're gonna cannot wait to sleep. Oh, look at that. That's Pierre's bed. It's gonna be comfy, I'm sure. Can you take the bed? Yeah, it's gonna be a good, good, good, good, good, sweet. The look sweet. The whole thing. It's true you have the biggest room. I guess we're running here to pay our fee. The drop-in winding. The drop-in winding.
