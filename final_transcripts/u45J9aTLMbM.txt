So no first to British people because I live here. I live there for 15 years. But this is like British makeup. Oh, she looks like her. You know her. No, I don't know. Okay. I think she's mixed.

I think Philippines might have the same. Basically with Latinos. You can't really tell who's Latino. Especially Brazilian. We have so much of a mix in our country. It's very very difficult for you to like point out by that guy's Brazilian. Everyone just looks different. It's insane. Oh, man. Yes, she's half Filipino. I know Vanessa. She's so famous. Oh, my God. She's pop. I did not know this. Oh, my God. Okay. That I got wrong. Oh, man. I think the second to celebrate I broke my perfect street. She's full. She has to be. I think she's full too. You can just tell. But also most Filipinos are not full. At least the ones here in Canada. They're always a mix. I'm gonna hold her like that's all my got thing. She's very very pretty. Holy crap around the Grande vibes. Yeah, she's very pretty. She looks full Filipino. She's full Filipino. She looks gorgeous. I think she's full Filipino. Oh, my God. Her hair is gorgeous.

She does have like a hip hop vibe. He's dating a Rwanda. The makeup. I say not. I feel it's time for an optical mirror. The Nicki Minaj vibe is so strong. I first started. I think. Okay. We're both now. How about you? I'm going to go to the park. Yeah. I do not know. Yeah, my best friend. She a real bad guy. Yeah, she is African American. Oh, yeah. She's part Filipino. And I've got the American. I hate the female. She was going to see. She's a part. These people you don't even know you don't even realize. And they got the Filipino in there. Look at them shy. Look at them go. There's also kind of points out like there are a lot of celebrities that I know or like people do know who are Filipino or have some Filipino in them. And you just don't know. Sweetie, like I listen to every day. No way. Yeah. You are killing this thing. So everything out of ages. I actually did not know she was still okay. I just guessed it. I'm not alone. No man, but after my whole world just changed. I think she's not. I'm not saying she's not. You definitely know that in love out of. I am not that old guys. I got a feeling that I'm about to actually part Filipino because she wouldn't be in here otherwise. She was American mixed with something but I don't know what that's something. I don't think she is. Oh, I know her. I think she's not Filipino. I don't know. I think she's mixed. Tell me the photo. No, no, no, no, I'm not falling for these tricks. They know way. No. She is from Nickelodeon or Disney. My name is Jennifer. I think this is the channel. Like what's going on? She's wrong. I stopped watching Disney at the end of the 1942. I know she was on like camera. I see. No, I just don't care. Actually, I'm going to go apart. Yeah. She's not. I should have believed it myself. She's just an American. I'm less being. I thought you were American. Yes, I knew it. She's not. You know what I knew it. She's the famous. I'm six and you're two three. Okay, three. What two? Okay, so you're six and I'm three. Okay. Okay, I'm in love with you. Oh my god. I'll scare the next part. I was going to be like, like she's full of Filipino people. I knew this. I'll share the quality of my own. Tell me about it. What is it? I think it wasn't a strike. I mean, the picture on the right kind of thing was up. Smash five. It's just a pit. Smash five. Did you think I was going to cry? You're going to know we're stopping here. You're going to be like, you're dead. I don't know. Don't know. I Wasn't Lisa. She's so cute. So pretty. Okay. I see Phil. You know, she's four parts. The first thing that came out on the right kind of her ears. Why? They're beautiful. I think she's like part part part. That's all I want to know. You go fast. I think she is Paul. I would say she's full. She's meets. You know her? I don't know. Maybe she's Japanese. I feel like she's mixed. I'm going to say Paul. I realize I'm a big fan of the parts because Paul is a good middle ground. Wow. Wow. You know she feels like she's been pretty. Oh, she's been pretty. Oh, she's been pretty. Oh, Lisa. Lisa watching. Please. Wow. I think she's definitely like a model or actress. She looks pretty. She's beautiful. She's beautiful. I want to say she's part. I think she's part two. Part. Yeah. American. Oh, she's super Filipino. Oh, her mom is everything. That's crazy. French Canadian. French Canadian. Bonjour, Misa. Misa. She's a lot of blood in her. She's a lot of things, guys. Oh, she's mixed. Half American, half Filipino. Okay. Oh my god. She's gorgeous. She's dropped it. Gorgeous. Lisa. And look at that. She's a part. Why can't I say it? Gorgeous. The Filipino gene. Maybe shining through. This part. She's a bunch of stuff on her mother's side. Her father. She's still Filipino. Here. White skin is definitely more privileged. But like, Canada is so diverse. It is. All these different nationalities. Like, so being missed isn't really special. It's not rare. Yeah, there's like mixed people everywhere here. So like, it's not that like, oh my god, you're mixed. But like, your Asians? Cheeeeeeees. You just like, Asian. So, Asians are sweet. And North America, like, it's not completely special. Yeah. But like, definitely in the Asian culture. There's more concept pose if you're in Korea though. There's like a lot of hardships that they would go through. Especially if you're not mixed with white, it's pretty hard. In our country, it's pretty natural. I don't know any Brazilian that's full. You could ever come from European descent. Native American descent. Japanese or Asian descent. Brazil has the most Japanese migration. There's like areas in Brazil known for having like a Japanese community. All friends. I love you. Italian. Japanese. All German. African as well. I think that the Philippines has kind of the same principle. You guys have a lot of ethnicities. And it's kind of like, normal thing, right? So that's something I love to see as well. In Greece, usually people don't care. A lot of people are mixed. Like, with Turkey, Italy, like, I've been in a lot of countries. But like, mixed race, I think people would be like, really excited to meet someone half-cree, half-African-American, half-Asian. People would really be excited to meet people that are mixed. In Ukraine, I feel like there'd be kind of more like, taking a bath. But nobody would have any like bad feelings. That's definitely like a pro, like, to be mixed. People would be like, really surprised. I'm really interested in you. How about Korea? I think it's really like a few. I can still see someone like, you know, TV. But, you know, I think it's hard, I think. To meet or just have a chance. It's hard to meet mixed race babies. Yes. In my generation, I have never seen two mixed friends in a baby. But mixed babies in Korea are really rising. I've seen a lot of mixed babies in this generation. So I think we will be seeing more. I think this day is getting more common. I think so. In England, being mixed, especially with white, is favorite. It's all to do with colorism. A lot of the times when you're mixed with white or a lighter skin, people see more as the standard beauty because the whole idea that beauty comes from whiteness. Even in Ghana, colorism is a big thing. People try and bleach their skin in order to appear more lighter. The more quote-unquote mix look, here being mixed with anything is a blessing. And I feel like a lot of the times, people who are mixed have issues when they have to feel like, oh, am I one or the other when you're literally both and your mixed identity is so valid and so important and you are literally a beautiful blend of whatever you are. For Korea, we're still out of the phase where still get that foreign demand. So you see people that fall Korean in like public places. Yeah, I mean, might be like a little culture or difference. And so people tend to distance themselves a little bit. We're not full on racism, but we're like, I don't speak English. So we kind of like, all the way to the end of our free time thing here. Just the appearance wise, if they're not Korean, it's more of, okay, you're kind of new in this area. You kind of get that look, but it's not a bad word. It's just getting dramatically bad. Especially the past three, five years. Oh yeah, for sure. Now, America. I haven't really felt any foreigner feel here because it's a little diverse. Personally, for like America, I can't find any cond of you being mixed. Yeah, personally in high school. I dated a mixed group. Oh, I'm pressure then because of that is really positive. Definitely see how they're more pros and cons. I personally find them really attractive. Yes, I think they're really attractive. Like we saw exactly.
