 with you Friday. The freshest. Welcome to the Baleska Radio Variety Channel. Welcome, welcome. Well, because we check out the Filipino music industry and it seems everyone in the Philippines is a bloody artist. Apparently so. We are now reviewing music from Brighton Brooms. Brooms. Brooms. No, there's no brooming here. Her name is Almira Lat. I'm not sure if she's an artist, but she... Bloody did record a track and everyone's telling us you have to do a review of this. It's actually really good. I think that this has been so freaking requested. Yeah, I'm always a bit like an arms length with this stuff because I feel like there's so intimate, there's like really intimate moments. And we're all here. Also, we're all here. We're all here. A few months ago, I asked Criaboo. Okay. Also known to you as Lelita Go. Go Lolito. So right, a song from my wife. She's gorgeous. Look at that dress. I sent him a few lines that I wrote myself and he fashioned it into a piece of poetry before he finally set his original music to it. Yeah, no, this is really brilliant. I would also like to acknowledge Mr. Ian in me go for his beautiful and magical arrangement. She is your main role. Dude, this is like brother. Like, we're not even closely related to any of these people. Well, this will be no weddings at wild road. They're like a whole arrangement. So one of our older sisters just got married, right? In Italy and so on. We only have one older sister. Not one of them, by the way, just saying. Did I say one? Did you say one of them? They were like, you have to do the whole thing, you know, the party, the DJ, can dress and all that stuff. No way even remotely in her universe, in her possibilities of possibilities. Did she ever think I need to make a song, send it to an arranger, you know, get it produced, get it mixed, get it mastered, write lyrics and then sing it in the night of the day of the war. No, it's not even the night of the wedding. She's walking down the aisle while singing the song. So put it into perspective. I know this is normal. She's mixing and mastering the track. Look at that. Come on. So a million thanks to you guys for this collaborative effort. Thank you also for keeping quiet about the project. She's damn. I know Josh was not surprised anymore that I'm the one who will sing for my bridal walk. But my surprise is here's the original song entitled He Knows. Oh, just an opera. This song to him. And to the man I prayed for who is now to officially become my other half. Damn, bro. I would be whoop it. The one. She is the one. She's a keeper, bro. But again, look, even keeping the project secret, that's like working with labels. That's like working with publicists. This is at an NDA because this is worth NDA. Hey, you want to do what you said? What is happening? Oh, damn. Oh, I'm the video. What the fuck? There's like a whole movie. Shit. Damn, yo. Ah, fuck it. We're reviewing an artist. That's what we're doing. Right now we're reviewing an artist. Stop, guys. Bobo de Sietos in your... What? That is beautiful. That is stunning. Wow, that sweetness. The tender emotion there. Yeah, it's still worthy. My eyebrows are twitching. A yo bro, what a song, bro. What? Is this how Spotify? Wow. The lyrics though. That's gorgeous. This is like, out of the track, this is me. I know. I know. But yeah, we will let this away a bit. Yeah, all right. All right, let me talk to you directly, miss. What's her name? Almira. All right, Almira. Get the shit registered, bro. Is this on Spotify? If I get some streams, girl, what are you talking about? Get in touch. We'll put you in touch with some of the labels. Like, you can fucking do this. You can't even leave. You can do this shit. What are you talking about? The fuck is this? No, honestly, honestly, this could become the it song for everybody else in their wedding. Stop covering Celine Dion. What is this? Come on, everybody get it. I'm getting it. I'm getting it. I'm unreal. This chick is the next level, bro. Why was that? I just walked down the freaking aisle. Yes. Yes. Yes. Hey, yo, bro. Come on, man. Glad. Hey, yo, bro. Come on, man. Glad. Glad. When the roads would take it wrong, he knows that we can still live them back. And he's everything that I've ever seen. What is this? What's up, man? This chorus bangs hard. And also, everyone in these weddings wearing drip-a-browns. Also, the location. God's God's freaking place. Damn. Can I just say something? Like, uh... Maybe she doesn't need to get in touch with the big label. Maybe she's already fucking sorted, bro. I just think, though, I think from a musical perspective, this is so good. How is this a new song? I mean, like, this needs to be like a staple... Product. ...walking down the aisle song. Actually, this could be everybody's first dance song. Forget, forget that this is like, I mean, incredible. And it's very ironic, as always. It plays to the meme. It's in the Philippines. It had to happen. If it's going to happen anywhere else, it had to happen here. Philippines. Because one thing is like, you know, sometimes it seems... Brides do sing to their brooms, their grooms. But... But it happens more often than not in places like the Philippines. But this is what I must emphasize. To get to this level, that can only happen in a place where a fucking special shit happens 24-7. I present to you, you know, like a Filipino culture. However, however, I would argue that this girl, Al-Miralat, the bride, that literally has to be her artist name. I would argue that she is genuinely, genuinely better than some of the artists that we know of, not publicly with reviewed, because we don't review bad artists. That's something that... That's like, Baleska's... What do you call it? My moto. Morel code, I guess. If we share... probably we did record it, and I had a blast grilling them, but it is never gonna be out. Petition to release them. No, no. Navitation will never see the latter day either. But... The dictatorship! She is arguably better than some of the artists we have reviewed in the last three years. Genuinely, that is... Composition, songwriting, arrangement... Emotional delivery, beautiful melody carrying, like the idea of having something so sweet and tender, with the best melody composition to accommodate to the situation, it's not just only really well arranged, but incredibly beautifully performed, even though this is an overlaying of the original track. Yeah, it's not the live audio, which I think... It's fine. No, it's fair, because... She's emotional, this is like the bridal. Yeah, I mean, I still would like to see the live audio, but it's not just emotion, is that... It's like near a beach ride, there's like people walking around in the background, it would have sounded like garbage. It sounds like contamination is crap. Yeah, it would have sounded bad. Yeah. She's some kid crying as I'm sure. You ever been to a wedding room? But that's real, she could sit. Oh, back! That's freaking... It is freaking sweet! That's someone who sings for real. Oh, his whip to bro. If you didn't know, she was the one who know you too. She wrote a song to God to talk about you. And sounds like an absolute princess. What's a banger bro? What's an absolute banger? And the cuss of this... I give you my... I'm... Proud. I'm the girls. The girls are me. Thank you, Lord. Woooow! Proud. I'm the girls. The girls are me. Thank you, Lord. The little... Oh! Down! This is... The purple trim. Grinch by Gene and Ego. John. Gene, yeah. Gene? John? Take two films. Man, oh, man, oh, man, oh, everybody. Stop, that was absolutely stunning. Damn, dude. Yeah, she's for real. Damn, what a song. This is the performance of a lifetime. So, so quite nice that it's like essentially a worship song as well? It is. Bye! Redispebute this thing, bro. Lolito, where are you on, man? Take two films. Damn! No, I'm sorry. Excuse me, but I would love... I suddenly want to get married. I suddenly want to do that mic wedding. Someone watching right now is like, Yes, I've been singing her 25 messages. I thank you up on it. Listen, this is so great. The idea of having a letter sent to God, basically. It's like a freaking letter to God saying, He knows what's happening because he put you and me together. And the freaking composition and how he was delivered and the videography. Everything's so gorgeous. She sounds like a Disney princess.
