 My good dancers are from there. But he's just smiling. One of my friends, my am burntag, one our way, Mimila, quick stop in a land, a land at Jollibee, get a bit of breakfast. I was a little kind of time to stop really. I just don't need a face master order in the Jollibee. You got your mask? Been in. Just like we went to Samar on our last little vacation. Start a day with some vein. We're going to have a bit of a Jollibee. Let's get out of there going. We're going to start a day with a Jollibee breakfast. We never tried their breakfast before. I'm drinking coffee for the chain, I'll chocolate for me, and a breakfast bun. I forgot what's in this actually. Bacon, bacon cheese. I can eat this by a flight. A flight is in about two hours time, flying out in the taxi to the van. We're going to Mimila. It's quite a quick flight, one hour and a half. Jollibee for breakfast. Never done Jollibee for breakfast before. It's just a little muffin. Look like McDonald's sort of thing. You're getting in UK. Bacon egg and cheese. Somewhere. Oh yeah, there we are. Need a coffee. Early start today. I'm still sleepy and tired. So wake up a bit. Give this a bit of a try. It's nice, very nice. It's a lot like the McDonald's, but for some UK's to get. A muffin I've been. This is Jollibee's own version of it. I'm not sure who was first, but this is very nice. Yes. I'm going to ask my sister. Sir, we're going to park today. We're going to Mimila. Okay, let's go. We're going to the toilet. We're going to the toilet. Okay, thank you. So we're parked here. Yeah, Port here. It's nice Christmas music going on. First of December. I will find out. It's over there, isn't it? There's anyone hangover really, one building. You still need to wear masks in airports. So we brought some masks from the market. 20 pesos for 10. We're going to the toilet. We're going to the toilet. We're going to the toilet. So we brought some masks from the market. 20 pesos for 10. Okay. So we'll give you one half. Yeah, please. We've got a new check in luggage. Just two carry on bags. Raise the up. It's a black line up or down. I'm going to wear this upside down, I'm sure. I'll give it up. That's why we're doing not. Back of my nose is on my chin. I'm seeing. So you can stay there long today, 340 odd pesos for two days. Not too bad. Quite reasonable really if you want to take a trip somewhere else, drive to Takleban and get a flight somewhere. So we just gone through security. Then I'll check in. We're here now. We're going to be departing from gate 3. Our first time. It's your first time in Takleban Airport. So yeah, it's good to run in a truck. That's a problem. Usually stable. Normally go via Saboon. This is my first time in this airport. It's a 20 minute before we can board our plane. There's a Dunkin' Donuts there. We're going to be 17 hour on board. I'm not way there. A little bit late. We're going to be forwarding now. Same plane that just came back in from Manila. Same plane goes back out again. Very quickly. Very little in a way of turning around time. There we go. That's a lot of plane. That's raining. No, it's only like a second. It could be seven or seven seconds. No! That's a lot of plane. It's a lot of plane. It's a lot of plane. It's a lot of plane. It's a lot of plane. It's a lot of plane. It's a lot of plane. It's a lot of plane. It's a lot of plane. It's a lot of plane. It's a lot of plane. It's a lot of plane. It's a lot of plane. It's a lot of plane. Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Just hope I can fly tomorrow, walking to New York, flyyy? If you think I can come, Okay, I'm coming. As such, we eat food. It's half to eat. You remember? That's the order you went for. We're going to swap in future. That's the order. Yes, i think i'm going to swap. Thank you. That's a lot. So we're going to have our voices. Chili chicken, nuts. See what it is. What's the what it is? We are. Oh no, they are. Happy you. Happy you're the one. That's like a dried fish. So a dried fish. A few nuts. Is that egg? Egg yes. So cute. So cute. It's really cute. You're little, eh? No. That's good, isn't it? It's like a chicken. It's so. I don't know. Chicken in the sun. Voice and a roasted corned potato. Yeah, it's like a chava. A chava. A chava. How is it? It's okay. Nice. Spicy. I have been trying to spicy it. I'll do it. It's very spicy. It's going to be okay with that. It's a hell of a thing. It's a hell of a thing. It's a good idea. So we're in time. We're here in Manila. We know, you know, I have four first time. I've been here before. I've not had a long time. Yeah, everything decorated for Christmas. How they season. It's all very festive here. Going in the cold way straight to our hotel. So we now need to find a taxi to take us to our hotel. So we're going to get a meet and taxi. This is a strange being in a big city again. Hello for you. Here we are. I'm having a big dinner. Yeah. We are on the way to our destination. We're finally here in Manila. I don't know what you think. We haven't really explored yet. It's just me and it's like we're back in England. I might show a lot of where we were. We're in England and London. It's very developed isn't it? It's not all like England. Okay, so let's go. We do a little bit of a tour of our room when we're back. It's tidy. Oh dear. How are we going to find out? I don't know if it's not. We're going to the queue. What was it? I need to. Okay, really? Let's go. We're here in Manila. We're in the Bay Leaf Hotel. Which is very close to the centre. I think I really don't know my way around Manila yet. Do you? Yes, I'm it. We're going to get something to eat. We've just checked in. We've had a long busy day already so far. We're going to go get something to eat. We're going up, aren't we? To the penthouse. Not. I can just go. I'll say, this one's coming up anyway. Number five. More more floor. Six is going down. Uh, hi. Is that him? Yeah. You might go down to the floor though. We're just going to get out of here. I think I broke it. So we are. You got to need to swipe the card first. Swipe. Oh, I think so. No, just swipe the blue. There we are. Nine. Peep, peep. And that's the result we're going down. Well, what's that here, and what things? The pizza video. I'd like some number three. Level three they got a, uh, a good pizza place. A good pizza, is it bad? Yeah. So much because it's part of going on, but peep. And I sure we need to wear masks. What's that here? Sweet and savory. Grand floor. Oh, good luck. So, where are we? In the penthouse. It said it was on the roof. It's not an open roof at least. You're getting a bit wet otherwise. It seems like a minute. Yeah, not the best day. It's not the best day at all. It looks, I don't know, it looks a lot like London. With the buildings and the lights. So here's the menu. Quite a good choice. There's more than two pages at the seams. Oh yeah. Oh, they look nice. Drinks. So you've always included the hotel. James conferred mango juice. I've gone for a top-corder light. Which is a mixture of coconut juice and peach. For the baked pagina, which is a very good thing. Yeah, with peanut paste. So, it's a third time that I've had a great salad. It comes with rice, the meal. So, I'm going to try our food. Really hungry. It's been a very long day. I was there. It's quite nice. It's really good thing there. You can taste the moist, and you can taste the sweetness of the mango. It's like a sauce with it. It's not really like you see that. It's like a different sauce. Yeah, we are doing a lot of fast. Very heavy. Very powerful. It's really good. It's about the own. The middle is a bit thick for me. It's very nice. I was at the crunchy. The sweet crunchy is not dry. It's not dry at all. It's very fancy, but it's in time. It's crispy too. So, this. Thank you.
