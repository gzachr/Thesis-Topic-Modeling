 Mmm. Oh, oh my God. Wow. Look at that. Oh, this one. Hello everybody and welcome. Today is a special day. You know why? Because today I try Jolly B for the first time in my life right here in the Philippines. So let's go. Now you can find a Jolly B just about on every corner here in the Philippines. Everywhere I've gone, Manila, Cebu, Mobile, even Boracay. I've always seen at least one, but in most cases multiple Jolly B's. And this is really an amazing feat by Jolly B as a company because there are more Jolly B's in Philippines than McDonald's, which is really hard to do. In fact, there are over 1,150 Jolly B locations just in the Philippines. And worldwide I believe there's over 1,500. So yeah, really excited about this. I've been holding out. I've been waiting. And interestingly enough, today is Easter Sunday. So I'm on my way here in IT Park. Cebu's IT Park to go to a 24 hour Jolly B. This Jolly B is supposedly open 24 hours 24 or 7. So hopefully I can get something there. Now from what I understand, Jolly B has some pretty incredible fried chicken. And if you've been watching my channel for a long time, you know that I love fried chicken. So we're going to put Jolly B to the test today. Not only am I going to get their famous chicken joy, which they describe as crispy, delicious, but I'm also going to try a bunch of stuff. Hot dogs, pies, even a young burger. So let's go and do this. I'm so excited. And here we are coming up to Jolly B. It looks like it might be packed already. But maybe not. Let's see. So this is the one I've selected here. And oh man, am I hungry. I've not eaten all day. So here we are. Ah yes, and I also need to get myself some Jolly spaghetti, of course. So, and here's the iconic Jolly B mascot. So we're going to go in here and see what we can find. Hello. How are you? Good. Happy Easter. May I have a six piece chicken joy? Six pieces. Can I have half normal and half spicy? Yes, it. Okay, can I have a classic hot dog? One on a burger. Yes, just one? And then... No fries and drinks, that's the best. I'll have fries with it and a drink. Yeah, I'll have fries and a drink. Do you have any special Jolly B drinks? No, I don't. Like... So the nice thing about pineapple. Pineapple. I'll do pineapple. And then I'll also do the yum burger with spaghetti. And then let me see here. Do you have what pies do you have? Pich mango pie, so I'll do a mango pie and a mollo pie. All right, I'll do a mango and a mollo pie. One ballon and one fish mango pie. Yes. And I think that's it. All for the ghost. For here. For here. Yes. Six pieces chicken. One Jolly has a regular price and pineapple. One is a premium sea pineapple. And one ballon and one fish mango pie. Yes. That is all. Who's the total? So. Eight forty-one. Okay, thank you. All right, so number six. And let me see if I can find a spot here. All right, so total was eight forty-one. It's about fifteen dollars total. So I got a massive order. It makes sense. All right, our order is here. So let's go in and grab it. Probably not going to be able to do this with in one go. Hello. Hi, sir. Hi. Okay, all right, I'll be back. Yeah, but I got another. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. All right, guys, well here we are. Let me show you the aerial shot here of my order. So we've got Young Burger, prize, spaghetti, hot dog. Right here. I'll open that up. More prize. Two pies. Two things of pineapple and six pieces of chicken. So will I eat all of this? No, probably not. Definitely not. But I wanted to try everything. So let's dig in here. I am starving. I'm so hungry. So let me just make sure my camera is good. And okay. So first thing we got to try. Actually, I'm going to take a sip of this pineapple juice here. Hmm? It's not bad. It's a little watery. But yeah, not bad. All right, let's give the normal fried chicken a shot here. This is what I'm most excited for. This is Jolly V's signature item, the chicken joy. Hmm. It's really hot. Like, heat wise, it just came out of the fryer. You can see here, it's very juicy. And it is very good. Like I said, I love fried chicken. Ow, it's very hot. That is real fried chicken. Hmm. Hmm. It's good. Hmm. Now, the fried chicken here also comes with some sort of like gravy, I believe, or some sort of sauce here that I believe is for the chicken. Let's give this a shot. Ooh, that is good. Hold on a second. Let me give this fried chicken a shot with the gravy. Ooh, man, that sauce is good. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Wow. I love it. Hmm. It is so good with the gravy. I can see why it is very popular. Let's try the spicy. I'm sitting outside to my napkins or flying away. Let me give the spicy chicken here a proper try. It's definitely as a kick to it. So, here's the spicy. Hmm. The speech I think is a little dry, but... You let me know, is this a controversy you'll take? I actually think the spicy is better than the normal. All right, now let's try dunking the spicy in some of the gravy. Hmm. Everything is better with the gravy. Now, here's what's interesting. I actually think the normal tastes better with the gravy, but the spicy chicken tastes better straight up. The spicy chicken tastes better. All right, I'm... Oh, yeah. It's got a kick to it. It kind of creeps up on you. I'm going to give this pineapple juice another shot here. Hmm. Definitely what I need. All right. Now, next, let's try these fries. Wow. The fries taste like Burger King fries. Oh, they're pretty good. Hmm. Hmm. Get the fries. Yum. All right, next up. Now, I don't eat a lot of hot dogs because I know how hot dogs are made. And once you know how hot dogs are made, probably won't eat as many. But here is the Jolly B hot dog. It's got cheese on it, catch up, some other sort of sauce. I don't think it's mayo. Hmm. It's not mayo. It's sort of like a relish. Or maybe more cheese sauce. Yeah. Oh. It's fine. Yeah. I would say skip the hot dog. I'll be real with you. I would say skip the hot dog. It's not great. All right. Actually, the fries and the chicken are where it's at. Hmm. Those fries are legitimately good. All right. Next thing. Here. We try this spaghetti. So it looks like there's meat. I'm going to get a little bit of everything. There's meat. There's a sweet sauce, I believe. Cheese. Hmm. Yeah, I mean, listen, it's fast food spaghetti. So I mean, you have to keep your expectations and check. I would not come to Jolly B for the spaghetti and the hot dogs. I know many people do. I think, and we're not done with my review yet here. But I think the outcome is going to be that you should come to Jolly B. For the chicken and the fries. But let's see what other items we have here. And here is the young burger. So let's give the young burger a shot. So it's got a burger and a yum sauce, which is, I guess, some type of sauce from Jolly B. We can take one more bite here. Okay. So the burger itself is not really good. It's like McDonald's burger. Really. The yum sauce is very nice. It's sweet. Actually, let me give it a shot here with one of these fries. You can see it. It's like a burger sauce. It's sweet. It's good. The bun is like a McDonald's bun. Yeah. It's really not bad. I would say if you really want to try the young burger, I do not think you'll be disappointed with the young burger. The pineapple juice, unfortunately, is watery. The fries and the fried chicken are my number one and number two items. Cool bar. I would truly skip the hot dog. The spaghetti, if you're like, you know what, I got to try fast food spaghetti, then, you know, get it. But it's not the best. I'm very real, dude. It's not the best. But this fried chicken on the other hand, now that is a different story. This is impressive. Yeah. Definitely. Yeah, it's so good. It's not too dry. And it's definitely juicy enough. The gravy is one of the main attractions here of this meal, for a short. The gravy is so good. Yeah. Get the gravy. It comes with the chicken, but definitely try the gravy. So again, I think the spicy chicken is better straight up, no gravy. But I think the original chicken is better than the spicy if you add the gravy. That's really good. I would definitely say it's crispy, delicious. That is for sure. I will say those since I'm giving my honest review. Some of the pieces of that chicken are a little dry. The fries, I am pleasantly surprised. I would not expect these fries to be good. Let's take a look here at this peach mango pie. Let's give this a shot. And then, what we're going to do is we're going to try this. Buku other pie as well, which I'm actually more excited for. Even though I know that the pineapple pie is the traditional one. Or actually, they say on both sides. Buku pineapple. So we're playing roulette here. We're on the dice. I have no idea which one this is. Mmm. Pineapple pie. Wow, that's really good. It's so sweet. The inside is warm. The outer edge here is crispy. The dough is crispy. Mmm. Mmm. This is really good. If you've ever had a pie from McDonald's, I would say this is even better. Better one. Let's give the other one, which is like, I believe, like a mellow. Oh, look. It's got some purple on the outside here. Which, to me, is typically uve. Mmm. Oh. Oh, my God. Wow. Look at that. Oh. This one. Mmm. Get this. I absolutely get this. I may need to hold him. Oh, my God. Wow. Oh, yeah. That might be my favorite jelly be item. Probably the sweet tooth. So, I actually might be my favorite. Alright, so food recap here. Get the chicken joy. Come to Jolly V and get the chicken joy. Get the fries. The fries are surprisingly good. Get either pie, whatever pie they have, it will be good, especially the huku pie, or the, it was like the chaco mellow is what I got. I would skip the spaghetti. I would definitely skip the hot dog. The hot dog was the worst item here. I probably wouldn't get the pineapple drink again. It was watery. And the younger girl. I'm right in the middle. I'm right in the middle in the younger girl. I think it's not a bad burger. It's not, it's not Jolly V's best item. But the yum sauce really brings it together. And the yum sauce is actually surprisingly good. So overall, that is my thoughts. Is Jolly V going to be the best cuisine you get in the Philippines? No, it's fast food. Le Chon, which is a check out my video on that, is much better. Pork Sizzig. Hello, hello. There are so many amazing items here to eat in the Philippines. And those will probably be better, but I have to try Jolly V. And if you come to the Philippines, you have to try Jolly V. Because it is iconic to this region. So I'm glad I tried it. The food overall is pretty good for fast food. Alright, so this is what I managed to finish. Both fries. Again, really good. A couple of pieces of chicken here. And I did not eat the hot dog. Both pies. Thank you so much for being here. I hope you enjoyed this video. And I almost certainly will be talking to you again soon. Peace.
