 I'll try to flip it. Go on. Oh my goodness, again of your night base. Oh, that was good. Ah, it's pretty nice in the morning. We're about today, the car's getting looked at. Alright, in here. I'm going to get some chives for scramble. I'd like to put some chives on scramble, and get some chives here. Smells so nice. This is the chives. I guess I get so many chives. I'm going to put some chives on scramble. I'm going to put some chives on scramble. When you're living in the Philippines, it's always nice to start your day outside. It's a fresh air. Listen to the birds, the crickets. Or whatever that noise is. I think it's grasshoppers not crickets. It's a peaceful and quiet air in the province. That's why we love living in the province. You get a bit of noise in the back, I understand some building going on. You get the bikes going past every now and then. Dogs barking, chickens, all the usual signs from the Philippines. But you get used to it, you adapt, you adjust. They don't bother you. In the beginning, you might be a bit off-put by the odd chicken here and there. The odd rooster crowing, the odd dog barking. But it's life in the Philippines. You embrace it, you enjoy it. It doesn't get you down. When you're away from the province, you actually miss these signs. You miss the roosters, the dogs, the crickets, the birds, especially the birds. In England, we had trees by our houses until they cut them down to develop more houses behind. And the biggest thing I missed was the bird signs in the morning. The bird called the bird songs. Something about the birds, they welcome you, they wake you. The roosters wake you. I should say about the birds. They greet you, they call us. It's really nice. I like the little hum, the hum of the grasshoppers or the crickets here. Especially at night when they come out. Really miss it when you're away from it. Living in the province, you. It's like home, because it is home. We're back today, the car's getting looked at. And we're going to get a trite, can't we? Back to the city. So we're going to get a fine of trite. Right, so they sunny day to day, very point day. Alright, in here. Thank you. What's that? Something important for Minila? Yes. That's the guys in the carriage who fit. Seems like the egg fish in a fan belt motor. Or something. And put an egg in it. Yeah. What's that? Something important for Minila? Yes. That's the guys in the carriage who fit. Seems like the egg fish in a fan belt motor. Or something important for an egg. It's not worth any more. It's going to be replaced, along with the egg fish and the egg tops up. I'm going to make some breakfast for everyone. I'm going to make some pancake and some scrambled egg. Good chance. I'm going to make some pancakes. These are the chives I like to put on the scrambled egg. I'm going to get out. I'm going to mix some hot chocolate. It's not hot water. And then you're just putting it in. And then you're just putting it in. And then you're just putting it in. I'm going to start the onion and cow from our cow. This is what we need. I'm going to mix some hot chocolate. It's not hot water. And then you're just putting it in the fan. And then the cooker. It's a quarter in. It's a quarter in. Yeah, it's a quarter in. And then we just boil it slowly. And then add a melt. This pancake has a mature of hot. So you saw them in milk quite often, didn't you? You know, they go on and on and on. A lot of people, including Jane, is about, even myself, sometimes, they're lactose intolerant. If you win, it doesn't have to be too low. As milk isn't really meant for humans to consume. Not really. Our bodies aren't designed that way. We don't have the enzymes to produce it. The lactose to break it down into a lot of people do find themselves lactose intolerant. It's something in their life. That's why I want milk. Things like that, very popular. Very, very popular. But they're expensive here. They all want to put it from Australia. I think it's better to make our own. So we're going to make a lot of homemade produce, especially almond milk, soy milk, very easy to do. You can't really find them here. They're so important from Australia. I would do find from experience in the shops that the supply is. It's up in down, prices fluctuate. They're going up at the moment. They've been going up for all year. Since last year, even, when we were riding the Philippines, we could get on with not for 150 pesos. Now it's about 180 pesos. Quite a big increase. Whereas the wholesale price of almonds has remained the same. So this is the patrotholite. Yeah, it is melted. And this is just... This is 100% pure cacao, nothing added. Yeah, absolutely. It smells nice. It smells nice. It could start for the day hot chocolate. In the province, it's quite a treat for breakfast, isn't it? Mango, sticky rice. So the gas calc is actually a condiment price. Three months ago, we bought one for 1,500. The other day, we ran out in middle of the night. Well, middle of the evening, cooking dinner as usual. And it was 900 pesos for gas calc. I put it on the meter. It's actually more gas in it than last time as well. So gas, wholesale gas, I'm not sure if it's come down everywhere in the Philippines, but certainly where we are, it's come down in price. It always helps, doesn't it, when prices of things come down? Gas canister lasts about three months. Now, doesn't it? Three months, 900 pesos, 300 pesos a month. Really reasonable. It's not a thin pancakes, more than a American style pancake this. Cooking and making it at the same time. I don't know if you think this is good. It was nice in the morning. We probably actually used this time, though. Okay? We've learned our lesson. Next time, we'll make a bamboo rower. You'll bust me down, please. Every year, we resolve to make a plan. Where we're going to visit. We're going to also go locally, see some local tourist attractions and businesses and places we've never gone to before. Drops a comment that there's anywhere you want us to go and see. Obviously, we can't go everywhere, but drop us a comment. Give us some ideas. A slip? I'll try to flip it. Go on. Oh my goodness, again, I'm in my face. I'll do this. I hope you're on the ceiling, but... Just like stick on the ceiling and come back on your face. Okay. Mmm, that was good. Ah, it's really nice in the morning. Purely calm. Some people have coffee and we do have coffee, but as an alternative, cacao, very similar to coffee in some sense. You want some more chocolate? Mmm. Yeah. She didn't finish the... Too excited. Too excited to get ready to go out of here, I think. Yeah. Imagine each one of these became a tree. I've not seen it before. It grew really quickly. They all know. Oh yeah. That one, that's the stuff. It's one of these, yeah. Yeah, it's the one of these seeds. We'll just throw it on it. It's just... It grew on there's some more everywhere. It grew everywhere. I can see it. That's the blue one. It's not blue one. That's the blue one. No, no. I can't tell my neck, I've figured it's a little bit funny. It's like a sondafina. Oh, I see it. It's not blue one. White. White blue. The blue. The blue. The yellow one. I love that little bird. That is coming. But in England especially when they have the trees behind us, the bird song in the morning was incredible. They got the trees down, the birds disappeared. And you really miss it because when you wake up and you hear the birds sing in it, it really puts you in a good mood. Even though it's a moose to say it down, you get used to it, isn't it? This? Oh. This is too. I don't wonder. You're gonna bury them or just leave them there. No, just leave it. Honestly, they will just grow. They just find that way in. Yeah, and then we'll just have a pong can here. See? Like this bamboo, bamboo, right? We really need to get this somewhere, don't we? This is great for five footer of gold on the wall. We're gonna move that in the front. Yeah, by the wall. Yeah. Oh, good for you. Yeah. Yeah, but it's not hanging straight, so we're gonna need to get a bigger bracket. That's it. Just push gently in it. Water will come out. It has it. Just lets the air out. Just do it a little bit gently. That's it. No more? A little bit. Until the water comes out. That's it. Okay. Until the air noise stops. That's it. That's it. Sometimes you get an air bubble which affects the water pressure. Yeah. It definitely works to help little particles come out. Tap upstairs. The showers are all really clean with this. Very cheap, very inexpensive to do. Do it yourself. It's gonna use a lot of experience. About the bracket. Racket's not quite wide enough. As the wall we had before was smaller. We changed it to a better, before-and-unit. We need to change the bracket. 7-11. 50% off. I'm buying the high-estore. Fourth to the 7-50% off. So we're gonna go 7-11. 7-11. We're 300 items. 50% off. July 7th to July 11th. Of course. What is this gonna be? 7-11. No 4-11. But I saw it somewhere. So it's somewhere. Maybe you're just buying.
