He's saying, that's who you tonight, but I might be some euphemism using that Right, I enjoy the song, but these lyrics, bro Hopefully, he's just being respectful, you know, whatever Hopefully, he's not being like, definitely not me You want to ask me something who'll give me and not to drink We've all been there, you're looking into someone and you're like What do you want from me? He's pretty self-exmantering, he just sees this person and he's like I want to dance with you Basically, the power of dance is going to bring the love That is basically what I've got He's the pioneer of Filipino trap genre As he started the mainstream trap movement in the country Okay, okay, that's so cool Did you think I would notice he's staying into my eyes? Why were you staring as if you're planning something? Yeah, I literally guess that this was the kind of like the stuff he would say I don't know, you could kind of tell Especially because of the name of the song And like the English chorus, I think Why were you staring as if you're planning something? Do it, don't be scared I promise you won't get tired So baby, can I dance with you tonight? There was no love interest Yeah, I'm kind of confused I didn't think that it was about love Because like, I didn't see a love interest I thought it was just about like, I think I'm gonna end up with your hope Yeah, I don't know, I wasn't expecting it to be about love I don't know if this is about love I said baby, I could have missed it And I held up How? How is this? I know, but do you find it romantic? If he would come in, I would be like How do they do? Oh, oh Don't know how I feel about these lyrics After reading the lyrics, I like to song a little less The vibes are immaculate though Yeah, the cinematography and the lighting is really good I just wasn't expecting that to be like the meaning of the song Don't be afraid of the darkness Don't be afraid of the darkness Okay, a little bit of a deep entrance It is necessary It's true, but an interesting There is a new city I don't know how I think She's opening the doors Maybe that's what it's called right, right rabbit Because you know how Alice goes She's so beautiful after me And she also has like, English in ready for my own I give myself a wish To forge my own person, her dream She said what needed to be said Oh, that's from the sub... I love that sub... Okay, that visual was so clean I like this music video It's like, ooh, ooh, ooh Right now I'm seeing paperhead bags Kind of freaked out This is such an exclusive scene She used me Ariana Grande bags Dude, look The purple look, the aesthetics right now And her voice It's so artsy It's so creative I've never seen the Polish music video like this Same I love the cinematography, like the set design of this place No, I'm obsessed with this song, it's amazing Oh my god, this is... Wow, I want money, but spend the least video Someone gave the people in wardrobe a raise because her outfit, that dress is fire Yeah, it was like lady Gaga, but fashion sense is... Like, everything ties together really well Like, her outfits and the design of this set, like, all like, complementary Oh, I think it's like a Alice in Wonderland 5 Tell me what you're doing I'm just guessing it's about, like, beauty There's some sort of, like, societal message behind it I love this song The meaning behind it and I feel, like, is, like, amazing It's so powerful I want to know what that is distracting from her head I think it's not the music video I wouldn't listen to this song, like, till the end Oh, she got on her, she didn't know reality Like, set the visuals Oh, the... Okay, Fed, I open it Okay, whoever did this animation is so... You'll see that in like, absolutely, you don't see that in American music I ain't telling everyone, though, I love this song, it's so good So this is all, like, you don't know what it's real And it's like, she's in the Wonderland film at this I'm giving myself a mission He's hot, okay I knew it I give myself permission to love myself Yes I give permission to look for myself It's truly worth it Oh my god, this is not gonna be easy I give myself permission to trust my vision No, no, no, no Is this poetry, philosophy, music, acting, drama? This is like, everything I want, no, I love this And it's so powerful, the meaning behind it is absolutely amazing I've sang down Oh, I can not read English Just a polished tip Lost in the ocean, paralyzed the fear of these faint frozen Can't see beyond my emotion Thanks for having me So chasing bad habits Tell me what is real, follow the white rabbit All the white rabbit, like, a decent wonderland And she's lost And she doesn't wake up I wouldn't sink to this song But as I said, I would watch the music video and this song together again This one I like a lot Because I'm a big fan of deep stuff This might be my favorite one actually Yeah, I really like that That's not very one as well Maybe they know me better than myself Wooo Jennifer I'm a sucker for deep lyrics It reminds me of the flow of poetry, you know what I mean? The way it's written as well To me, it feels like she's stuck in this place She's trying to find a way out And this place seems to be her head About being too deep, I don't know The music video showed like Eyes and her getting vision Stuff like that Yeah, like you're thinking She's beginning to open up Yeah, and the third eye at the end as well She opened her further Tell me what is real, stop chasing bad habits Tell me what is real, follow the white rabbit Who is she talking to? I feel like Either she's talking to herself or she's talking to us I said the white rabbit thing I said in Alice in Wonderland She chasing the white rabbit And in the beginning of the music video She was opening all of those doors But even my own reflection keeps judging me Oh, this is about like conflicting emotions Honestly, the second one These are such a good message, you know I like that one There's a popular Filipino actress And singer who recently released her song I could kind of tell she was an actor Because the videography was absolutely amazing And the way she performed in that song was a one It was immaculate The lyrics to this song was one of the things I loved most They were so deep, they were amazing The words are so powerful It's a reference to Alice in Wonderland The white rabbit, right? That's what I'm thinking Because they're like follow the white rabbit down the floor And then it kind of opens her to a world of imagination So I'm guessing that's what she's referencing Tell me what is real, stop chasing bad habits Tell me what is real, follow the white rabbit I'm not being trudous I love that line I love the white rabbit And also like the vibes of the music video It was very mystical And I feel like that kind of matches the same vibe that Alice in Wonderland kind of has It really is in their self-journey Music wise, me Naree is the musician, she's a vocal performance major So like, I feel like she's more experienced And like speaking on that kind of term, but like because I'm a visual artist Whenever I watch videos, I always pay attention to like this cinematography The lighting and the costume design a lot more Especially because like I love working in like the fashion industry That aspect of this video It was so good So well done Like her concept of like what she was talking about, I feel like Tizen with the... For sure Yeah felt like this one had the most artistic freedom Which is why I enjoyed this video I was not expecting that Oh! This is giving me beauty Oh, they got a grip Alright, so what's going through Tom? Yo, what's with the Philippines and grip bro? What's going on? This gives me cake with vibes Yeah, I think This is so like people buy the group style Oh, yeah, okay They're so good looking What the heck? Dude, they're so pretty They are really pretty That transition was so... Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I think we need to rewind that I need to see that again Oh, look at their outfit, yeah! I like that each of them have different outfits They look so good They look so good They're serving me color They have a more cuter face Yeah, yeah But then their dance is like Like me Oh, so sky I didn't expect this Yeah, same, I was like I expect it one guy Yeah, like a rapper This reminds me a lot of K-pop music I'm not a big K-pop fan But I like some K-pop music Like all the K-pop music I like that they don't use strong make-up I'm like the K-pop idols They just look natural I think I'm already so good guys Ooh, there's a lot more badass And they're like She's like, don't touch me You just like Rob the bunk This kind of also gives me like old big bang vibes So I'm like, dude, yeah I wonder if this is fake and pretty good Somebody sign me off for a dance lesson Because I feel very embarrassed right now Oh, they're treating it They're chasing it after the light Oh my god, he's chasing the light I don't like what they're running No, I know why this is called the light Like, I don't know if it's a sad lyrics Or not, it feels crying but the beat is like so Oh, I was so Oh, they were all sad And then they all came together after chasing the light Oh, the light is within them They're holding it Oh, they're all fighting their own life Maybe it's like they're like passionate or they're calling or something Right, right, right, right They're like it's like your life They're only so tall I was about to say that but I'm like I'm like, she's saying it I want to know who's the most famous in this group I love the job This is so catchy Yeah The bass and the background is really making a lot of the song The voices are so nice Their voices fit well together This is so cute The way the music develops is just so nice But you know what kid yet? It's a mess with Walter Follow the bright bright light Oh my god, another looking at the light Oh my god That's such a cute message But I also don't know what was happening All the time because it was so much happening That was good That was really good That was really catchy Where have I been all this time?

Oh my gosh This is so good So good Their song entitled The Light was written by the members Together with District for Broad Songs for D-O-T-7 A lot of 7, you know D-O-T-7 No, I'm so sad I'm sorry, I'm not a kid, I'm better, okay? I'm an 8th grader I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm not 8th grader I don't know They gotta make sure I work hard enough so I can be the change I like the lyrics, it's really relatable I like the music video didn't show the sadness I mean a bit and then the beat of the music Was like really energetic That's true though Man, the world is, they've learned about a lot of negativity Man, it is And you know, you being the light, that's what he's trying to say You know, he's trying to find the light within He's trying to be the person that changes the world Yeah But I think it's like, he's trying to say that Like, you are gonna follow the light, you know what I'm saying It's just like a typical, you know, feel good, like, poppy song, you know They reminded me of like, K-pop groups The way they were dancing and stuff Hold on, don't let go in the face of large challenges, fight for what you believe Oh my god, the second one and the third one White rabbit and the light has such good messages Their song entitled The Light was written by members together with the distraction We wrote songs for G-O-T-7, G-O-T-7, G-O-T-7, no one says that G-O-T-7, N-T-T, oh my gosh, I've had an N-T-T, obviously I'm not a K-pop fan, but I have friends who love K-pop N-T-T is definitely a group that I hear a lot about Just hold on, don't let go in the face of large challenges, fight for what you believe in Like, it's just such a powerful song, I loved it I was written by the members together with this track who wrote songs for G-O-T-7 and G-O-T-7 But I think this one will be really popular with like the girls I imagine, in the Philippines itself they're really big They're really big with a tango, but they're really big So look, you know, in South Korean coaches That makes sense! Yes, helping the investors singing and dancing Their song entitled The Light was written by the members together with distract Who wrote songs for G-O-T-7 G-O-T-7, G-O-T-7, G-O-T-7 G-O-T-7, G-O-T-7 So got seven, that makes sense I like get like got seven vibes from them Got sevens of K-pop girls First, I got a major, I work hard enough So I could be the change, be the change You want to see in the world, let's go It's your dream I feel like it represents the good in the world There's not much hate, jealousy, crime, and violence And we don't need anymore So don't hold on, like follow the light And I feel like light is always simple of good That's true So I feel like they're saying like be the change you want to see in the world That is true, like change is only possible if you want it The minute we all decide that change isn't worth fighting for, like it's not possible Yeah, it's not gonna happen But this song inspires you to be that change Yeah, this is my first time actually reacting to Filipino music And honestly, it was just dope, I love all types of music If I had to pick a favorite, I think white rabbit was my favorite The aesthetic, everything, singing, I loved it 10 out of 10 The third one, BGY-O, had a nice message in it Sometimes I was a bit confused, I'm not gonna lie A lot of the time something was happening And I wanted to say about something else that was happening But something else was happening was confusion But it was fine Dance with me was just grubby, like that is the issue just like a song you play at a party That was just some good music, I enjoyed it I think it's pretty clear, like I'm about to add all of these songs to my playlist I think it's an absolutely amazing genre I love the fact that a lot of the songs are really meaningful The music is actually good And the song just always gets better and better And then you've got the amazing dancing and the vibes This music is just amazing The Philippines never fails to surprise in a good way And I'm so happy that I got to listen to these songs today And they're just absolutely amazing I like that second being in the most Oh yeah, that was really cool I think I like the melody the most from this one And then I like the dance from the first one the most Yeah, that's true I like that too I want to learn that But the visuals from the second video Yeah But they're all really good, like they're all making me think like why I find a very interesting one And I really want to add that song in my playlist Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it was really nice Okay, which one did you like the most? I think the second one The second? Yeah Because I loved the music video so much And I really liked her voice when it was like a high voice I think I liked the first one the most Because the song, the dance, the guys Everything was 10 of a 10 And I was actually vibing with the song Second one, she was really pretty like Jill And the last one just gave me some cape vibes But the guys I prefer the guy in the first video Oh, yeah In the last video there was a guy looking in the mirror And I was like Stop saying things for the tattoo Yeah So what are your thoughts on the piano music? I didn't expect actually to like it that much as I liked it And I didn't expect such a creativity in music videos All of them are Yeah I think there's more versatility in the music than like K-pop Well, I'm trying to compare it to K-pop Because I feel like I know K-pop a little bit better But like I feel like K-pop is very focused on the visual aspect of the music video And it seemed like a trend that I saw in all three of them Is that they like really cared about like this cinematography and like that And stuff like that In terms of the music though, I would agree that there's like a lot of range between the three Like they're all different genres I think it's also because they like purposely chose three different genres Just to like show the different kinds of vibes that you can get Something that I also really liked was I feel like there's songs Well, like some of the first ones that I do have like good meaning Yeah, the first one was like This dance, like it's drunk And then the second one It's like where am I? Like yeah, like I need to find myself And then the third one's like the your own light The your own light The your own light I do want to do that Honestly, I really liked it I didn't know what I was like Yeah, I didn't know what I like to expect but I really enjoyed it I'm a very big fan of the second girl I think she's like, it makes sense that she's also an actress She's so pretty She's so beautiful God, we're not talking about the other one We're just standing over her I'm always so straight
