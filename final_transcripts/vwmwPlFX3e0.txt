 but you're Friday. The freshest. Okay, so then going back to the Philippines, this is Tini Kling. Tini Kling. Yeah, Tini Kling, yeah. Tini Kling. And I think they dance with like bamboo sticks. I feel like that. They hit each other with it. No, no, they dance. I didn't say they hit each other with it. It's a Kapoeira, you know? They dance as well. But someone loses a tooth every night. Oh my god. I don't know. Maybe this is like... I don't know. That's how they should sew our problems. It's a tingling bat. Oh, let's watch this. How similar is that in terms of rhythmicality, yeah? And costumes as well, kind of similar to what we were. Oh, somebody smiles. That's wonderful. Oh, I see. It's just like a legal game, actually. Yeah, it's like double jumping. Yeah. Is that tap dance? No. Nothing like tap dance. I love that they were birthfued it. I like that. Smiling. So happy. Happy people. It's like a mandolin playing in the background. Oh my god. Oh, nice. Oh, that's cool. Yeah, this is awesome. Kinda sounds like... Sounds a bit like. Come on. Kinda sounds like... Sounds a bit like. Am I tripping or do I hear sort of like Mexican... What is that? What is that genre? Pancheras. I did. Don't you hear it? Is it just me tripping? I was gonna say it kind of sounds like bad like Venezuelan ball. It's a bit... Ball. Ball, that's it. Yeah, that's what it sounds like. It's a balls of balls. Balls of balls. Because balls, you know, sort of like... A balls, but... Bags. A, L, L, L. With... With a Z. With a Z. With a Z. With a Z. With a Z. With a Z. With a Z. I'm sure. Hey Siri. This is what people invent. What is balls? I want to understand. Again, why would you ask Siri if you have me? Well, he's felt it wrong. Thank you, Siri. There, there's... It's such a big goal. It's not really on useful. Balls is this a... I'm not even sure if it runs like that in English. But it's a dance you do in parties when a young lady is turning into... Well, they call it... They call it waltz. Yeah, it's... Turn it into... She's turning 15, right? Waltz. Yeah, but... Waltz. Waltz. Are you sure? Maybe. Dance, just put waltz dance. I have a key here as a variation of the word waltz. Uh-huh. It's like a German variation of it. It's very specific in Venezuela. I see. So it's waltz. It's like a waltz. It's waltz. It's spelled w. Put it up in the screen, mate. So it's spelled like this. W-A-L-T. Z. Z. Right. But there's a very full, chloric version of this... W-A-L-S. W-L-A-T. W-A-L-S. To change. W-A-L-S. In Venezuela, that sounds pretty similar to this rhythmically speaking and even melodically speaking to similar, not the same, but pretty close. But there is the emphasis on the two by two. Yeah, they dance to it. And you have to dance with your partners. Tiem por la voz, tiem por paada. That's what you dance when you turn fifteen in Venezuela. That was the move back home to pick up a chick. You had to dance with her on Herkin Sianiera's. Absolutely. Okay, carry on. This is awesome. Oh cool! How cool is that? It must be hard to learn though. The lady on the far left is very impressive. They're all very cool. Duh, duh, duh. Change. Nice. They're so happy. They're so happy. They're there. Something's wrong. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Are they? It must be super fun to learn it though. Oh nice. How cool! I feel like this is something they do in schools as well. Probably. Maybe something they teach you in school too. They're artistic. Heh. Wonder if they're happy. Wonder if they're happy. I don't know. Bambu's thick so pretty and all that heavy. What the heck? How do they manage to carry on the tempo? Because doing stuff like this rhythmically, you naturally tend to speed up. They kind of do. They catch it very well. Look at how it's such a good time. How do you have it? Oh, I spanked back. That's so hard. Nice. How cool! That's so complicated though. Oh boy. You can take it. You can take it. You can take it. I like the car. I like the car. I like the car. I like the car. I like the car. I like just that. Yeah. You don't want to be the guy that makes you smile. Because your ankles are going to pay for it. Yeah. Nice. How cool! Yeah. Yeah. How cool! Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That is so cool, dude. That is so funny. Yeah. That is so funny. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I'm good. Oh baby, not shit. That is so cool, dude. Learning this must be super hard. Back to the beginning. Oh no. Oh they are in full. Oh, fuck. Oh my god. This is fun. I want to see a rehearsal of this. Someone's told, I'm gonna go. Oh, Brahmin, no, just kidding. Dude, dude, dude. Dude, dude, dude. Dude, dude, dude. He had my duello filmed. That boy and boy. Oh god, you guys. I wanna learn. Oh god. Oh my god. I'm telling you, in practice, someone's toes are gonna go. I don't think it's toes. I think it's more like ankles. It's like ankle level. No, I reckon what happens is a lot. You just gonna make it and then bam. And your pink, what do you call it? Pinkies. No, you call it toes. You just call them toes. Your small toe. Yeah, your pinky toe, I guess. The tad. I was dancing when I was learning. That's just how messed up toes, man. Don't look at my toes. My toes are not nice because of dancing. But, you know, my pinkies, they used to get really swollen because I would hit them so much when I was dancing, especially like tap shoes or flying shoes and stuff. They look like a German sauce. So, I always used to refer as my, to my toes as my Vietnamese sausages. My little cocktail sausages. Because they were always swollen or I had, you know, my fat toe. That's the equivalent. I've lost that nail like three times. I guess that's the equivalent for dancers of like cauliflower either. Yes, definitely. Dances toes are. Yeah, our feet are pretty. Usually dancers are very pretty. You look it, but. Not our feet. Not the feet. Yeah, no. From Steve, anyone's wearing tape or anything? Mm-hmm. She is, yeah. Oh, is that the light? Oh no. Oh no, she is wearing tape. Oh, is the light? How cool! This is so fun. Oh, but you're los. Oh, I like your placo. Oh, are you joking? Oh, boy. Oh, my god. What the fuck are they doing this? Look at their chanting stuff. Oh, no. It's sped up as well, holy crap. Oh, my god, a sick. How do you know what you're doing? Bravo! Oh, no. I thought I got to do it again, but someone else. That was insane. That was so cool. That's so dope. Yeah, it's like a game. Double jump has a lot to learn from this. Bravo! That's the... Bravo! How fun! Dude, did you see that shit? They were... That was so much fun. They were like, you know what? Let's speed up and let's become blindfolded. What the fuck? I know. How the hell? Now, I'd love someone and I'm sure someone's going to explain. Like, what is the meaning behind this? How did this come about? You get taught in school, like, you know, in Venezuela, you get taught horrible. Whether you like it or not. Yeah, what is sort of the story behind this? Or is this like specific to an area only? Or is that that's the whole country dance this? Or how does it work? How does the story behind it... We could learn this stuff through the power of Google. But I have said this before. I find Spekja, I don't know if it's just me. But I find it way more rewarding and just more human to... Because first of all, this is very nuts. The fact that so many of you are watching just to begin with and stuff like that is nuts. So, but I find it more connecting and I find more value when I read the comments. And then most of you are actually awesome at it where you actually leave links and articles and things like that. So don't be afraid to, you know... Drop the information. Yeah, or I'd someone said the other day, like, it broke my heart. It's like, oh, I know you're probably not going to read this because it's so long. I said, no, I am. We do. And then we have conversations about it later. So it's hard to reply to everyone but do comment because we actually read everything. We do read them. Yeah, we do read every comment. It was really interesting though. I feel like when you guys leave the information, I feel like we're actually in the moment together. You know, we're sharing the same emotions. We're having a conversation. And I feel like that's way more valuable, you know. And if we don't... It takes the inhumanity part of it and puts it back in. And if we don't catch the comments, either our parents or friends or people like that, they do catch everything and they talk about it with us. That's right. That was awesome. Let us know a bit more about the background story in the folklore, how this is come about. This was fantastic. It doesn't run my double jump action. You can add a lot of choreography to it. Like predetermined steps and stuff when you're double jumping. Yeah. I don't know, I feel like this got pretty intricate as he carried on. I've never seen anyone double jump without looking at what the hell they do. You gotta look, you know, because you gotta look. You have to look here as well. I know that was pretty nuts. That was such a martial arts moment. No, I'm where you are. Like such a... Like feel the beat. Yeah, so what the f**k? That's nuts. Like how do you know when they crossed each other and stuff? Like how did they know that we're crossing? Did they feel each other's breathing or something? That's so crazy.
