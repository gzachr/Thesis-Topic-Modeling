There are over 42,000 but angai in the Philippines, which means on average, there is one per every 2.5,000 Filipinos. so you'll find barangai halls, which can, but don't always look like this, all over the place. hmm? hey, what's that? why are you talking about that? the people living in a bar... so what? this government is empowered to enforce all odds and ordinances from pollution control and the protection of the environment to eradicating drug and child abuse. whether or not this happens in a barangai is a different story. what's different than Japan or Canada is that these very local governmental units exist within bigger governmental units, like municipalities and cities. in this barangai, they do have some managing waste and there are waste bins around. although, while everything is supposed to be separated, it's in fact a jumbled mess. and I don't know what happens to everything that's collected from this point on. if anything like a true match has this happened there, just because something that can't be recycled in the local stream nearby, it's clearly not free of trash. and the waters, grey from pollution... oh, wait a minute. beyond the issue of water, I can't believe this is so far. and in the rainy season, sassar-based lighting... I think I can use the lighting. I think this is a chance. it's partly due to garbage collection issues. waste management is supposed to be managed at the barangai level, but not all barangais have the same system in place, even if they're supposed to. for example, here, in business and rent. why do they have to manage it? I can't do it. I have to remove all the garbage. I can't do it. what should I do? oh my, we're all black. over here, which looks like it has many informal settlements. it's more half-pazer. we're simply waste lying around everywhere. because of pollen trees and accessibility issues I don't know if they're all black. what's the prize? it's not a surprise. it's a real bird. it's a real bird. oh, I agree. what's the prize? at the entrance there were some. what? but inside, it was where the more prize wants to be kept. there were roosters everywhere. what's going on? they were hanging out there. they were in someone's yard. and outside of a nice condominium unit. this belt's so sad that I just had to wait around and see that maybe just maybe oh back to the sanitary. there are basically three levels of burial in the elevator. one is in the ground or just above ground. for the wealthiest, there are lost limbs. with some of them even having toilets inside. for the poorest, there's apartment tombs. what's this? it's a place where the public cemetery was... it's a place where the same types of tombs the contrast between them was dark. that'd be like here. they put a tarp right over that little area that's where they're going to live. they're day to day live. like get ready to school. how high? and what do you know? looking at articles? it is indeed a thing. it's a lot of people are living here. so these apartments here. they are in society. they are basically because of overcrowding. they don't allow the people to walk. and the building is broken out. and this joint. they may get left in the right bag. the family does have a bit of money thinking of a really smaller bone box which is not much bigger than a large shoe box. the thing about these apartments is that there's no way to get out unless you climb. so to pay respect to a loved one, you need to literally climb on top of the grays of others. as with many things during my trip this visit is a bit of a trouble but it was simply a place we happened to scroll by and it was like the mall. I was so nervous. I was so nervous. probably the number one answer I had to get this security first. I had to get this security first. I was like, I can't see the house. I can't see it. I can see the building. it's so heavy and heavy. it's like a huge building. I'm going to go back to my room to clean up my room. I think it will be helpful to get this security first. I think that's the most important thing for me to do. I think you'll be curious about the most expensive apartment for people living in Gangnam. I think it's a big deal. I think it's a big deal. But what do you think? It's just a shoe box that we put in the kitchen. It really is. It's really big too and it's really compact. The length of the room is so much. If I look underneath the roof. But we can still look good on me. I think I should put some BIMiles in the back. 구독 좋아요 댓글 알림 설정까지 안녕
