Hey guys, just a quick reminder to tune in this Sunday at 12 p.m. UK time on Feature Friday Plus, where we'll be joined by the amazing K-pop group. Very, very. Okay, that's all. Goodbye. So, Baku Bubley. Yeah, he's out here. Look at the guy playing the sax. He's loving guys. Dude, I couldn't believe that Michael Bubley was not British. Oh, yeah, he's Canadian. Did I just blow your mind? Why did you think he was British? Adam, that guy must be 90 by the Queen. No, no, no, no, no. He has to be 90 by the Queen. Adoptive Brit. Yeah, bro. He has to be a sir. Sir, Michael Bubley. Every Christmas is Michael Bubley's Christmas. It is, but I don't think that's as close of to Britain. No, it is. No, no, no. He's so famous in Britain. Yeah, he is, indeed. He lives here as well. He does? He doesn't live in Britain. But anyways, this guy's unreal. I just thought I'll say that because every time I listen to Michael Bubley nowadays, how is he known as a sir? Anyway, it's not. But look at the sex player. He's loving life. How freaking sickling is that? I'll comment here as says. I've never had that family experience. But who has? I mean, who the hell plays a saxophone to begin with, dog? Who freaking just randomly puts a box out, you know, that Michael Bubley flawlessly with a saxoplayer? That just happens to be your dad or grandfather. Like what the hell, bro? That's fantastic. I guess also in the Philippines, I have this question. If you sing, you basically don't have a choice. What do you mean? You are the entertainment. Well, so is everybody else though. That's what happens. Yeah, we'll say like you're in there. Everybody just takes turns. No, I think if you go up, if you're a kid and you're sort of singing, right? All the people around you encourage you to sing, they give you money sort of thing. They're like, yeah, he's 50 pesos or something. Sing, mate. And you're like five years old. Yes. Fast. People have to know what reference is. You have to put it. Okay. Good, better. Fuck. You're going to hold one like that. You're just running faster than the woman. Yes. What? So I think that's over. You get encouraged since you're really young. People give you money and stuff. And then like he's like, you know, go buy yourself a suite. 50 pesos or something. 50 pesos or something. It's 50 pesos or something. I want you to say that's not a lot of money. Is that too much for a tooth fairy? That's mental, mate. You think that's what I love. I don't know. It sounds like a lot. Or is it like in Venezuela? Sorry. Does it like in Venezuela? That's... Ma, look, it works. Or is it like in Venezuela where he like thousands is like equivalent of one dollar? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, just depends on the currency. Yeah, that's what I mean. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know either. Okay. Next video. What? What? You know. A comment here says, can you take me there? I want to see them live. Ha ha ha ha ha. I agree. Yes, somebody said they will invite us. I'm waiting. Ha ha ha ha. Ha ha ha. What? That's what they do to hang out. Are you insane?

They have the bees and stuff. They should have a baby. Bam! Mama daughter. Just chilling. You're doing this thing. You got a karaoke machine. In case you're watching from another part of the world. The karaoke machine was invented in the Philippines. It was a collaborative effort between the Philippines. And Japan. Ha bon. You said Japan. Tagalog. Ha bon. I don't know. Yes.

It's crazy though, because it's gone so viral. That's gone so viral. That has millions of views overnight. Crazy. It's pretty good created to make it. I want that to go even more viral. So then it becomes like a game that people play, even though it's obviously for Clurric, Filipino dance. But that's just, it's like, skip, it's like, double rope. I had double rope. Yeah, it's like double rope. It sort of feels like that. I want to try. There's so many things I want to try. Like from the Philippines, because it's so fucking great. I want to do the whole line of it singing. The karaoke really. Yeah, that's right. I want to do tinigling. Tinigling. Tinigling. Tinigling. Okay. I want to do what else? I want to try the food obviously. I want to try and speak Tagalog fluently for 24 hours. I can only communicate Tagalog English. The story where is that you know? Yeah, yeah.

I think for the things I would go to the Philippines for. I don't even need to speak. I see. I just have to sing. I just have to remember some of the lyrics. You know, Parasad Isad. Isad. You know, you sort of just go there and then they'll be like, what the fuck? You know, but I'll be like, okay. Uh-huh. Mahal. Uh-huh. How do you say hungry? That's a good question.

You know? And then I'll be like, uh-uh. I think you're a little helpless. Ah-ha-ha. Uh-huh. I think we're all fucked. Anyways, come on. What is it? That's Raji. Yeah. It's Bo-boy. Joe, J-Roy, Michael. Yeah, that's, that's, that's, that's, John. Yeah. Who's singing to? I don't know. Who? That's Bo-Cole. I was singing to the count. I freaking love this guy. He's insane. Hello, Raji boy. VL codenue punjoow He's just, I'm a forensic- all the more 14 a the League Three I think they're going there This asshole a rte xilles noч Oh Shit Oh So let me put this into perspective, right? This is the place where like artists sing to other artists and they just cuz I don't know I guess it's so close and stuff, but you don't get the shit in any other industry so rare where you sort of Find that where where because it's such a culture of singing That that's just the thing to do you're hanging out You know backstage or post whatever. I think I don't know if you had to do with sort of tharrows Waiting or something I think you might have been something to do related to that I think it perhaps is like one of like the rehearsal dinners when you all get together stuff Ridiculous it's outrageous. It's outrageous. This is what I love about the Philippines that even the top artists do this because they just love The crap because you didn't know that's but a kill Bugoi Michael and the Barrow and then the guy that was standing up singing He is from a Magnus Haven yes a van called Magnus Havens emis Lagie or a G Graduate graduate I think my just fine John Bragg which is the guy with it with the glass of wine His is an ultimate vibe I think the god recording on the side of Darryl. That's his wife. Yeah, but yeah These are all like great great singers so do check out all this stuff, but anyways next one Oh Oh Right Good That's a mask So you can go on actually never petty listen listen listen listen Let's talk about the freaking vocal technique called display that that was that was ridiculous amount of great Vocal technique Cheryl Pors of vocal coach help me mention man but a feature Maybe he wants someone to break down his but we're going don't do him the five. Okay. I'll break down the vocals That is insane. We're talking about some fantastic anchoring from underneath in the latissima store size We're talking about yes, that's right The shower move and then you also have the Inks. Oh, that's right. Yeah, they're really cool. Wonderful And then you have the ridiculous flexibility of the larynx it's so naturally set so high So it's accessing like incredible ranges like the what I love the most is that his technique is so settled that you're The anchoring behind and in the neck in the back allows for the larynx to do whatever the hell They this singer chooses to do so from from the from the graze as high snows to the deep as low as notes Dude you can access everything from that really freedom free flowing It's taking all the and the tension away from the larynx and the neck and then just redistributing it to the rest of your body It's actually quite hard, but If you see the posture is actually really well distributed the feeder on the ground Even though they're touching their talk underneath it. Yeah, even though they're talked underneath it and and that might just be playing to comfort But you're having a really ridiculously straight back and the fantastic world you can see the fantastic neck anchoring Look at this muscles being super engaged and how like nice and lifted the back of the head is you see really nicely Engaged shoulders as well. So a lot of the tension that Naturally would be put into the larynx and like the tilt of the head to try to get to those notes of Strain yourself into getting into those notes is actually being redistributed and is being Modulated in a way that is so safe for the larynx. This is a very safe singer But in the way that like his practice is a Perfect definition of what you can do. I'd love to know How he learned but Essentially the best advice because a lot of people now that is so watching this videos and a lot of people are watching this on a series So yeah a lot of people's do send messages like you know, I want to sing like them How can I sing and stuff like that and it's like Sing the best. Yeah, just try to do what the best do start by singing Yeah, if this is really truly something you want to take somewhat seriously or you want to improve just sing Literally, but look the best investment any of these families I've ever made Into the development into our development of a skill set It may not be a career may not make the millionaires, but it's certainly a skill set then learning to master a skill That's worth a lot. That's truly worth a lot learning how to battle the plateaus after your skills the plateaus Battling the learning curve in such a friendly environment and so non-pressure or judgmental and that mentality can be applied to any skill So if you learn how to sing to a decent standard you can then apply the same sort of mentality and approach to mastering a skill into any other thing playing football tennis Even your normal daycareers applying yourself in college or whatever it is a skill that you can It's a life skill something that you can reapply in everything else also you develop this like Criteria you develop a critical eye because you are constantly practicing so you can see the differences between yourself and Your path self so you develop a really sharp eye and and that can be applied into any other aspect in life And you can go and become a review or things you can become work for people labels and stuff like there's so much stuff Benefits of just learning how to sing I have to say if I was gonna put a slogan on the Philippines I would say the land that sings no Sing and become a better person Wow, you know because that's the thing Yeah, because I think everyone's so friendly and lovely and you know and sort of Encouraging comes from the culture of singing. I think that's where it all comes from genuinely like that I think that's because there's no judgment in that sort of aspect of things and that translates into social dynamics Fun definitely come home. Come to my house. It's hang out. Let's sing and that's like oh my god But I'm so shy. I'm introverted and all that stuff. Yeah, but it's just fun And then you learn how to put yourself out on the spot last time. I'm what a skill that is then you become maybe better a public speaking and So I think there's a lot man. There's so much. This sharing normal stop saying that hashtag stop saying that I don't know if hashtags are nothing anymore, but it's not a normal thing the Philippines. That is fucking outstanding Anyways, close with your slogan. Go ahead. Become a singer. This is the Philippines. This is the Philippines
