And the Filipino women are the most beautiful women in the Pagiging Hospital. The newly elected president, Manuel Cazan, it was not a question of whether his country would help, but why other nations did not? When you saw how the doors were basically closed to all of us, except the Philippines, and how the Filipino people are a very warm people. They're a very friendly people. The first thing is that the Filipino women are very friendly. No M&M and they are very friendly. So, they can be very friendly in the culture and the Filipino women are friendly. It's so great to be here with you. I'm very happy that you're here with me. I'm glad to be here with you. I'm here to visit you. I'm very happy. I'm here with you. I'm very happy. When I'm here, I feel like I want to go to Filipino. I want to go to Filipino. I always love to see you. That's very much the way I remember things when I was a child. That culture has faded a lot from American now. I miss that. The difference here is that the Caledon Manor, the human compassion is different. I would say that here, you're in Filipino because there are exceptions. We're not in a paradigm. We're in a paradigm of kindness, a culture of friendship, a culture of humility. You are always open to receive people, to understand different opinions, to be real tolerant. Other countries, the culture is different. It's a culture of indifference and kindness. That's true. So, I could say that some of the unique countries in the world and normally you represent, you express, this Caledon Manor through these smiles. We had Filipinos offer us a ride for free, a meal for free, and even a home for free. This is seriously amazing.
