I didn't really know because I didn't take it to the teacher. So what did you do in the devotion? We studied learning about religious in each group. And And each group And each group And the eldest And the eldest person in the group talked about something. Oh, so who is the eldest in your group? At the Darah. At the Darah. Okay, what did she talk about? Actually, she talked about touching her from the second heart. That's nice. My scripture was The Christian chapter 1 verse 28. And it talks about your nutrition and religiousness. Hey, good job. Okay, so after your devotion, you also did your what happened? Did you did your paces? Yeah, I did my paces.

How was your math? My math? I got a hundred percent. I'll do my English. 100 percent where? In my checkups and everything. Oh, so checkups are like quizzes? Yes. That's nice. Good job. Before you start, I heard that you do something before you do your work. Yeah, we set our goals. Oh, what's that? We set our goals for what, like, for an example. If you're doing English, you have to do from them. You start from the page you're going to do until the page you're going to do. And if you're done, you might, the subtest, you might do a paste test. And if you get a hundred percent them, the next day they will tell you about your congratulations. Congratulations, slaves. Have you ever had one? I have five of them now. Oh, you had five of them? What were the subjects? My friend, English, but from week seven, all the way to week nine. Wow, good job. That's nice. Okay, congratulations, slaves. And then do you get any reward if you get a perfect score in your... You have to eat your honor, or leave. Oh, if you're honor, okay. Good job. And then decide what goals for you to set. Do you decide it? Or somebody else? If you set it until, like, for example, page seven, two and two, page seven, two and two. Then the next day, from page, you set your goals from twenty-three. All the way to page thirty, twenty. And if the teacher comes and says, if you need more gold, if you need more pages, she'll tell you so you can have a green dot. Wow, green dot and a green dot. What do you get for green dot? Green dot means that you've finished your goals. Good job. That's nice. Also about the bow. You have to obey that bow and then when it rains, the first rain is for the portion time. The second rain is for break time. Third rain is for large time. And the bow's wing is for coming back to the class. If you finish your subject, you go out to the privilege. And when the bow's rings at the first time, you have to come back. At the fifth time, you have to stop doing your work and start having and start praying and finish the day and set your goals. Good job. And now you're done with school today, correct? Yes.
