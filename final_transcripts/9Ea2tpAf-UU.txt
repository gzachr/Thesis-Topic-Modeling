 What? Pasley in Adobo? Another day, a little reaction video. Welcome to... What's up, Philippines! It is another day with Nelly. Welcome back to the channel. Today I am reacting to one of my favorite characters on the internet, on YouTube. And that is Uncle Roger. And Uncle Roger has a very special video today with... Ah, Filipino dish! So I'm very, very curious to see it and how he will react to it. So today I am reacting to Uncle Roger hate food network Adobo. And I love how I just went like bad English because that's how... Like the whole character comes up from Uncle Roger. So I'm super, super fun. Are you ready for some fun? Are you ready to smile today? If yes, hit that subscribe button and hit the notification bell for the next videos coming because there's lots, lots more coming. So without further ado, let's just jump right into it. So parsley. What? What? What? Parsley into Filipino Adobo. Today we really are going to do Jeffy Sakerin making Filipino Adobo. This dish has many variations. Everybody make it a different way. So it's hard to fuck up. But this nephew Jeffy, he wearing suit, make Asian suit. That's a beautiful suit. Uncle Roger don't have good feeling about this. Making a traditional dish of Filipino Adobo. Oh, yeah. I can smell the spice, there's some chicken thigh in a bag. Who the people sitting down, they just getting ignored. This is very important. Some low sodium soy sauce. Low sodium soy sauce. Oh, I would agree to it. Why? Low sodium soy sauce. It's soy sauce with less flavor. Who want that? I don't be pussy, biorecular soy sauce. Big man like you, scared a little bit of sodium. I always find the low sodium. Always very inexpensive white vinegar. Vinegar, correct? Maybe put more Filipino people. Love vinegar. Top silverware. Some brown sugar. Sugar, good. Black pepper, a good amount of black pepper. Okay, usually we use pepper. Carbonero. What? What? What? He put it in there? Filipino's done, it's spicy. Carbonero. Hiya. Carbonero don't even grow in Philippine. What you're doing suit nephew. Usually Filipino food not even spicy. No need to put chili in there. But if you want to put chili, use Filipino chili. Carbonero. Oh, yeah. That's the weirdest reaction to chili. Oh, the replay. Carbonero. Oh, yeah. Oh, the magic. Okay, and we're going to mix this together. Massage it. You went for it with that Carbonero, by the way. Massage it and put it in the, and the, not again overnight. It really gets better, okay? Marinating, okay. And we're going to strain the manorate. We're going to reserve the marinade. We're going to keep this. It's a lot of flavor. Okay, good. Then we're going to take a beautiful Dutch oven that we're going to sear its skin side down and get a really good color. Searing okay, but that optional. And who making a dobo in this fancy like you say saucepan, hi, yeah. You know how expensive this shit is? 270 pounds. It's too fancy. Wow. Just spending money on saucepan. Spending money on expensive soup. But the ingredient for a dobo wrong. We're going to spend money on Filipino cookbook in Stain Hyde. You can see the color that's happening here. It just looks fantastic. Okay. It's just so much flavor. So when they get nicely crushed, we're going to take them out. Look nice. Put them on a dish. Look at all that. Look at that crust in the bottom of the pan. You want to keep that skin out. And you need it nice. It's beautiful about that skin. It creates like a flavor protector. And it's unsolator for more than a year. So to this, this fat you keep here. Really nobody cares about those two people. They keep talking and he keeps ignoring. Why did they? At least they're getting paid by food network to be ignored. Must be nice. When Uncle Roger is still married to ex-wife Auntie Helen, I get ignored for free. This good life, this one. Okay. A flavor protector. And unsolator for more than a year. So to this, this fat you keep here. Some onion. No, traditional dobo. No onion. This is a garlic. Some garlic. Garlic, correct. A little salt and pepper. But wait too much because we have... Wait, wait. That it? Or the garlic you use? You just use... What the tool is? So let's... When Uncle Roger making a dobo, I use like 10 or 20 whole cloves of garlic. Just smush the whole cloves and trope in pot. That few suit guy. Use the right amount. Not the right amount. Oh, I... Some garlic. That's a chunk of garlic. Garlic is like money. It never enough. Just put your size back in there. Don't tease us with your face. That is true. That is true. The tool slice of garlic. This guy treating garlic like truffle. And we're going to stir that just to pick up the flavor. It doesn't have to get very brown because this is going to simmer for about 30 minutes. See that? It's not really... It's cooked. I just gather all that stuff. And we're going to do another gathering by deglazing with the marinade. Deglazing. What? What deglazing mean? Ethically quick to hot pan, which allow all the caramelized bits stuck to the bottom to release. Oh. So deglazing just mean using liquid to clean the pan. Just say that no need to show off with your technical term. Life too short for this look called them blue cooking school bullshit. Deglazing. That's this guy also say he deglazing his toilet instead of washing. Like that. So, I'm going to do another gathering by deglazing with the marinade. Okay. Very important in Filipino cooking with the dobo is bay leaves. Bay leaf correct? No, two to little. But you really need the flavor. And just clean all the fashion water. Water good. But I think that too much. It's going to be so watery later. Uh. You start. Okay, you're going to put that chicken skin side up back in. Yeah. Cook in the sauce correct? And we're going to cook this a dobo. Going to be so bland. Oh, it's great. It's great. Enough garlic, two watery, not enough bay leaf. It's so simple and you can make this and basically start to finish about four to five minutes. But after you get this. Oh, okay. What? What? So cl- cl- cl- cl- for what? The watery as she dobo is the opposite of woman. It can definitely be too wet. Sorry, children. This crowd so easily impressed Uncle Roger need to get these people to come to my comedy show. I have rice. Good answer. White rice with no seasoning. Very important because they have warm white rice with no seasoning. Rice with no seasoning. It just called rice. That's what we call plain rice in Asia. Placed rice. Nobody say rice with no seasoning. Hi, when you're eating bread, do you also say, oh, I eat bread with no spread? No, we just say we eat bread. That's all. All the seasoning you need here, right? I want to see you react. Rice look okay. Hey, the habanero is in there. So a little bit of beautiful sauce on top. That looks pretty darn good. It looks okay. Looks okay. It's a parsley. A parsley. There's no parsley. Did he say parsley? There's no parsley. A parsley. A parsley into Filipino adobo. Uncle Roger, so upset. I put my leg down from chat. Parsley don't belong in Asian. So you're not looking pasta. Parsley in adobo. What the fuck? What the fuck? A few suit guys. What kind of Asian food got parsley in it? I think this damn few suit guys want to put cilantro or spring onion. But he cannot find. So he go, oh, this parsley, also small green leaf type of thing. Put that shit in there. Nobody noticed. Hiya. So parsley, I was always served for me with lemon. What? No, but they eat adobo. There's no lemon in adobo. Uncle Roger, I eat adobo. So many times now, never one time with lemon. What does it always serve with lemon? When you eat in adobo, Jamie Oliver Restaurant is it? This here. Thank you. Oh, slips right through. I can smell it. Oh, look at that. Too watery. Hiya, nephew suit guy. It all going okay. Until you add the parsley. And now it all fucked up. Uncle Roger said, it's an nephew. Uncle Roger recently tore Indonesia. I don't think so. Okay, that was a tough one. Wow. Okay, guys, just let me know what you think about this recipe. I think it could be improved, of course. But I've been there. I've done that. I had some cooking videos in Miami when I used to live in the US and wanted to recreate some dishes from the Philippines. And let's just say, didn't turn out exactly the way how it was supposed to be. So it is fun to watch. But don't shower him with criticism. It's it's own interpretation of Filipino food.
