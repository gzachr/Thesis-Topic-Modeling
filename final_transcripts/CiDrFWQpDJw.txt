Okay, first what do you expect? No idea. Okay, I'm going to be very real here. Very real. I think that these women will look equally beautiful without makeup. Possibly yes. Possibly yes. Because Filipinos, Filipinas are very beautiful. And I have so many friends who are not wearing any makeup whatsoever and they are stunning beauties. Yeah, and so many Filipinos and Filipinos for that might have such good skin. So jealous of that. I have terrible skin. Alright, stop making videos. Did you join me? I'm going to show you guys how I remove my makeup. First step, get a wipe. Oh, Mimi! I think Mimi. Alright. Love the dramatic music. So here we see the makeup going off. Here we go. Nice, it will make your makeup off like your eye makeup. I would soak that a couple days for a few seconds. I just hope you don't have to make up. Love the humor. I hope we're doing it anyway. Who is she? I'm not gay. Coswise. We're never so gentle. The only person I knew here was Rizzy and Katriona Gray. My makeup remover is also horrible. Oh, everybody. Lip makeup, lipstick remover. Those are the two of you. Oh, while we're watching this, let us know your favorite Filipinos celebrity in the comments down below. So one of the things I learned from Shastaydo is not really hard to get rid of. Yeah, fully agree. I was bad to get the lipstick on. Blowing that out, we eatin' like some hot dogs and you just try and get it on. I make a wife to remove it because it may feel like a conamas. Nalilina is on Facebook with that. So she has a very natural look. My eyes are on. Okay. Bronson? And then make sure. No, pata asoji has a double-bubble box. Like sunkist looks. You can't special. You can't get on with that. You have to take care of it. Then I'll have to. Always guys. Always. Always. Always. Always guys. Always take care of your skin. It's so important. See? Beautiful skin. Oh wait, the contact is not good. She's so pretty. Why is she wearing makeup? You do agree that she's really pretty. Yes, you guys are absolutely. There is no reason for her to... I think that's all. I think I'll learn to use my eyes. I think I'll learn to use my eyes. And it's a fun fact. We know so many Filipinos. I think that's all. I think that's all. I think that's all. I think I'll learn to use my eyes. And it's a fun fact. We know so many Filipinos who actually put in contact lenses. And every time I see somebody wearing contact lenses and like... No, no, no. Whoa, that looks so cool. That looks so cool. Everything that we wear is mascara. It's like... It's like a natural look. It's like a natural look. It's like a natural look. It's like a natural look. It's like a natural look. It's like a natural look. Oh my god, it must be so much work too. I have my eyes here. You know, put on makeup and take it off. Put on. Put on. It is. That's why I barely do so much. I just have to get up in the mornings. I like... This. It's good to go. I'm such an open, but I ask. This is pure coconut oil. Nice. I used to do that in Miami. Now I just used soap to wash my face. And everything is gone. Well, good. Okay. But you just... Anything else. But you eat you. Oh, it must be hard to get lipstick on. I don't like it. It's all I can tell you where I was. Should I try it? Should I try? No, no. Okay. Cover it down below. And we should do... Very pretty. Very pretty. It's very pretty. Very pretty. Very pretty. Very pretty. Very pretty. I love that she's using coconut oil to get rid of her makeup. It's... Coconut oil is so versatile. I know. I use it for everything. I'll buy it when I get the brands. I'll use it for my makeup. Try to not make up. I don't have to say anything about makeup whatsoever. Actually, I'm okay with that. Because I don't have a lot of skin. I don't have to say anything about makeup. I don't have to say anything about makeup. So, I'm going to buy a new one. I love how everybody is... Like... Wiping off the makeup like this. Like in the ads. Like in the ads. Like what she said right now. Keep the look. The thing about erasing your makeup with coconut oil is it's actually very good for your skin. And for your hair as well. And for your food. My tips since my nails are long. I just try to not touch it. She looks a little bit like a fashion. Just like from the summer. I know you can't say anything about it. I'm like, say something. I don't know the fashion. I wanted to show like a before and after at the end of the video. That would be really cool. Oh, I think lashes. So, what? I occasionally go to a beauty studio to give my lashes some. Last one month. And then I just wait up with like beautiful lashes. And I don't have to do anything more to have us. That's really good. I'm going to do a little bit of makeup with a remover on a cotton bag. I find that it's really abrasive. What's going on here on the side? Maybe she just had like her extreme makeup. I'm just getting whatever is left in my coconut oil jar here. Coconut oil is my favorite. I like this smell of it. Thing that warming it up in my fingers. This is going to look a little bit messy because it looks scarier. I hope she doesn't have like skin condition. I think it's something really bad. No, it's really good. In a proper way. I don't believe that the makeup is going to be so good. So I just need to put on a new technique. What? I'm just telling you that I'm a little bit ugly. So I'm just going to put on a makeup. I'm going to stick it on and then I'll just leave it on. So I'll just put it on. Wait. Very high energy. That's so cute. What's that? I don't know. I don't know. I'm just doing it on my own. I'm just telling you. I'm just telling you. That's it. So I just put on a new technique. I'm just telling you. It's good. I know how to put on a makeup. So I can put on a jawline at some point. It's so satisfying. It's so satisfying. I'm moving makeup. I limit myself to using two max. So I usually fold them and put it in less waste. I put it on the oven side. Every time I go from work with heavy makeup. Let us know in the comments below what all these celebrities actually do. They're singers, actors, TV show hosts, YouTubers, and all that. And I was able to remove all of them. It's a YouTuber. It's interesting actually. We saw her in Singapore. I saw her in Singapore. I saw her in Singapore. I saw her in Singapore. I saw her in Singapore. I saw her in Singapore. I saw her in Singapore. It's something that I really like about these nurses. They know how to do their brows. I'm obsessed with brows. It's a good idea! Guys, if you are here, and this is your first video, we do different videos as well. This is just by coincidence, makeup video. As we said before, you guys send us videos. We react to it. We don't see these videos before we actually start reacting to them. And as you guys see, Mike is the first to come to the beach. Yeah! We should do a makeup challenge where you put on makeup on my face. Yes, that, I can do it. I put a little bit of time, but Mike, she constantly tries to put makeup on my face. Every year to Halloween, she makes me look like a scary panda. Where was the costume you made up? I was like, I was going to make up for the final film. I want to see like a before and after, like, the reason I would do that. Yeah, maybe with the old one. Hopefully. Seems like a video that we'll do that. Yeah. Yeah, for the region, though. I feel like I'm an idiot. I'm not good at this. And honestly, this is a little weird for me because things that I don't want to make up. So right now, I'm not wearing any mascara. I don't know why I'm wearing this. I love it. Because I always don't use facial wash after. It's a bit of feeling. You'll be surprised, but I'm wearing somewhat of a foundation today. I'm not even joking. I have like a sunscreen that has like a little bit of color inside. It's not really cool as a makeup. It's just better for the skin, especially for your skin and the sun. But it kind of makes my face less shiny. Yeah. See, I can say something. I have something to say about this topic. Yeah. Chardonnay. Oh, yeah, that's it. Don't. That's how I take off my makeup. Oh my god, they're all so pretty. Yeah. I'm not probably even more pretty without makeup than like with makeup. Yeah, that was proof. That was proof that they don't actually need it. Exactly. But I, like for me as a woman, as a girl, it just wants to be like nice, like baby, like pretty. I get it that girls want to put on like some lipstick and mascara and just, you know. Yeah. I'm glad Nelly doesn't wear a lot of makeup. I just prefer to go to the natural. Wow. Guys, if you enjoyed this video, be sure to take a bit of thumbs up if you knew around here. Subscribe.
