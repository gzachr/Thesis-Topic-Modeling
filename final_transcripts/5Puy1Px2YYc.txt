 My cream. This is a fuse at E. Hello boy. Good to be home. Good to see you again. Oh, good boy aren't you? It's good to be home but back. It's good to be home back from a niller back in the province. Got a few jobs to do. What have we been gone? Our guy of bano is ready. Our guy of bano trees has produced quite a lot of food surprisingly. There wasn't as many when we left for my niller as a few in the middle and up there you might see a really really big one. It's starting to go yellow and the four ones, the bricks, the spikes. Wherever you want to call them, it's starting to go in on themself. This one is ready to harvest. It looks absolutely gigantic. Absolutely love guy of bano, my favourite food. Gonna need to get the ladder and get this. Me and ladders don't go together very well but I'm gonna get it because I love guy of bano. Guy of bano is what they call the miracle fruit of the tropics. It has a lot of anti-cancer, anti-inflammation properties. How am I gonna get out there? Oh my word, it's just walking attempt my weight. It's like a tightrope. This might not be a good idea. Really need like a long stick. I don't have not got on the floor, let's put these down. I wasn't my spike myself. Things I do for food. I think this wall is just going to come trembling down in with me on it. Put them a little bit of weight in my niller. Oh okay, so I'm here. I'm here guy of bano, don't fall now. Don't fall too adam. This is definitely where it's a little bit soft, it's perfect. I don't think I'm going to get it. I don't think I'm just twist. A few more twists. A few twists and it's soft. I can feel the rain. Mmm. And it comes the end, this is lifted up. Oh my word. I'm attacked. This is a lot of minute looks. You go just climb the beanstalk there. A long line. Got more twists, let me have it. Success. I don't drop it down there Adam. Mmm. Haha. Tada. Jamie, I believe I did fall. I'll break the guy of bano. I'll break the wall. But these ants are going to fill today on me. My nibbun tag must have my friends. We're going to back off Christmas tree and we're going to decorate our house of Christmas, our second Christmas here together in the Philippines. Now this year we're going to do something a little bit different around the house, bought some extra decorations and we've got an idea in mind. Some people have decorated as early as September here in the Philippines. We've had it out through December, we've done quite well. So we've got our decorations from last year here. We've got our trees from last year, we had our artificial trees. It's going to last for many many years. As long as no rats, no homers, got in the box. Oh dear. I hope not. You never know what's hiding in there. I don't do. And these are extras we've got this year. So this is a lot of Christmas decorations already. It's up to you tomorrow. You've already got a tree from last year. But we're going to have a bit of decorations here. One of these available. We're trying to eat this. It's not candy. These are for this in our door. Oh yeah. Light up. I shall. Everyone doesn't light up. That's different light. But it's quite nice. Yeah. Come on. This looks good. You get excited for Christmas. It's nice. That's quite cool, isn't it? We don't have a chimney. We don't have a chimney in the Philippines. We can still have a stock in. 200 and 69 pesos each. It's quite cute. It's just for decoration. I thought it was going down to people. Oh yeah. It's not too bad. It's like a reef for the door, right? A reef. Oh is it? Or like for the people? No, it's like for the door, a reef. So where do we take a candle then? It's not a candle. What's in the whole world? It's not a candle. It's a... It impales on them. What they don't have here is the calendar. I think calendars. Advent calendar. Oh yeah. For the door. A reef, yeah. Yeah. That's an activity set there. I think that's good to get actually. I like the old stuff. I like it. That's what I saw. Yeah, that was it. That was it. 599. It was like this. Yeah. It's very old-fashioned looking wooden and I like the little hollows. Yeah, it's nice. It's very Christmas. I still don't feel the spirit, you know. So maybe we need to put the trick up to make that... We met feeling to life. Feeling. Sometimes in England, like because it is cold and is dark and works difficult and stressful, sometimes you look forward to it, months and events. But because our life here is pretty laid back in pretty stress-free. We live life, how we want to live. You don't really look forward to things so much, do you? I'm also because we forgot what day is here. Ah, true as well. I'm like, oh no, is it almost Christmas? Days, weeks and even months goodbye without us realizing we're just living life that we really want to. So we've ever dreamed of doing. So we've never been to a place like this. We've never been to a place like this. We've never been to a place like this. We've never been to a place like this. We've never been to a place like this. We've never been to a place like this. We've never been to a place like this. We've never been to a place like this. We've never been to a place like this. We've never been to a place like this. We've never been to a place like this. We've never been to a place like this. We've never been to a place like this. We've never been to a place like this. Next scene we're driving. hope you enjoyed connecting me and hold my chain, bye now! Interrupting Oh, Enter this bit, I'm going to put it into D. It's a bit deep. Just gently. It's up. Took the holes. Yeah. There we are. It's got a simple look to it. This is the one we bought from Robinson's department store. 100 pesos. Not bad for the money. Not bad at all. This is so... It's so healthy. You can do it. Difficult. Oh, this app. This app is really, really fascinating with this decoration. She starts eating our drinks. Alright, leave that alone. Wait. Let alone. Me. Seriously me. It's gently. It's gently. It's gently. It's gently. It's just trying to help. Good girl me. What a man. You're trying to help me? Oh no, she's finding another way to get it. I think we're going to have to go to that here. Yeah. Sort of like... Oh. We need to find a bit more. Ah, she made it. So we finished decorating our stairs for now. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. This is our reef we put up. And this was the top of the guy by our tree we cut down. We kept it. What I have here is a solar powered light. Solar powered LED. A string light. Multicolored. This I bought from Shoffee. It was approximately 100 pesos. So we're going to do the screen. You ain't got any ideas? Okay, so... I need to trim it a little bit. Make it look a little bit more sensible. Not so wide. Otherwise it's going to take up the whole porch area here. And it's nothing to put in the base. So we've got some spare gravel outside the house. I'm going to fill it up with that to start with. Ah, my God. Ah, there we are. Whew. Having fun is some hard work. So this is very fragile. This is very fragile. Wicks got easily. What I'm going to need to do is to try to avoid breaking this anymore. Try to place this in here. And then use the stones to sort them all the way. There we are. My green. This is a few to eat. Multi-peer. This is a decoration for the outside area. You're going to be the gambit, okay? Your check for the Grinch. May might be the Grinch. I'm going to use Trientic Ant Christmas tree. I have the joy of a kitten in Christmas. I think that these guys get to experience it. Many of us Christmas cooking cream at one bench here. It's been one of those years. It's also cooking. For us, it seems like every day. If I have 22 come to an end, it feels like they share the concert quickly for us. I don't know about you guys. But for us, it's just so fun. One minute grid. It's all in March. People may. I would December almost into the year. Probably weeks left. So we put this one into the ground here. You should get enough sun in the afternoon at least. To charge it. Doesn't need much sun. Ah, and then we have it. We'll see how this looks. Let's look a bit darker. I'm going to put it in the middle. I'm going to put it in the middle. I'm going to put it in the middle. I'm going to put it in the middle.
