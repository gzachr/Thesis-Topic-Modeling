 Cheers to all my Filipino brothers and sisters to you guys. Ah! Oh my gosh! I'm here! Oh my gosh! What? Oh! Oh my gosh! Yo, what's good, my BGA crew or whatever? Welcome back to my channel. So today you guys, I am doing a part two to try and Filipino cuisine for the first time. I am so excited because this delicious meal or feast, I should say, is provided by Gasa Filipina on 30th Avenue in Thunderbird Road. If you guys would love to pay them a visit to get any of these amazing dishes or the dishes from my previous video, go ahead and click on the description box below and I will put the redress, phone number and all the information there. Alright you guys, let's go ahead and get started because I am what-what-what-what-what-what-what-win! Hahaha! Jesus Christ, please forgive me for this food, the hands that they prepared. They told me that they didn't have it. They helped me and they called my DJ Crew in your holy name. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Spirit of your Holy Spirit. Alright you guys, so I'm going to go as I get into this, I'm going to let you know what I have and what's what. So right here, first off, let me just tell you, this is the Pandasai. And shout out to all of you guys that were telling me like, hey, you're supposed to put the Pandasai behind the Pandasai. So let's go ahead and try that. So many people mentioned that. So this is dedicated to you guys. So I got the Pandasai and the pan-said bejone gisado. Let's see. Mmm! Oh my God! Mmm! Wow! Oh! Excuse me. I'm getting too excited here. Wow! This is amazing. Thank you to you guys that recommended this. Mmm! Mmm! He learned. I also... Wanted to tell you guys that I heard from the restaurant that the turnout of the amount of people that went to the restaurant after I posted my first video was amazing. So all of my Filipino peeps and not just my Filipino peeps, but everyone that went to try out Casa Filipina. Thank you guys so much. As most of you guys already know. A lot of smaller businesses, mom and pop shops. I've been really affected by what's going on in the world. Mmm! The fact that you guys went in child support and love to these people was amazing. So thank you guys for that. Alright. So right here, I'm not sure if I'm ready to try this just yet. This is... Denuguan. Denuguan. Which is blood sausage stew. And then right here we have sissig. Yeah, sissig. Which is chopped up pig parts. Which is like the ear and maybe a little bit of the snout. My mom fell in love with the sissig. So I'm not sure if I'm ready to try that one just yet. We'll get into it in just a minute. But let's try the best steak. This is the best steak. Tagalong I believe it is. So let's try this. I do love me some steak. Look at how good that looks. Ah. Ah! Ah! Ah! What? Oh, what? Wow! Wow! Oh my gosh! You guys! That meat is so tender. I don't need that. That gravy on it reminds me of the chicken adopo gravy. Oh my gosh! Oh! Hmm! Oh! Oh! Man! Wow! Look at that big old piece of onion. Oh! Hmm! Wow! Unbelievable! Hmm! I highly recommend that. I highly recommend it. Our Hispanic community will love it because it's... Very, very light hour. You guys. I really feel like Filipino food is so underrated. Like, I don't know why more people don't go to Filipino restaurants. Go to Filipino restaurants. I'll be honest with you. I had no idea before I did this video. And Jollybeer and all that. I had no idea we even had Filipino restaurants here in Arizona. Until I started researching. You know, this is one of the most underrated cuisines ever. And it is so packed with flavor. Look at that. They use the most tender parts of the steak with steak. And look at that. What goes better with steak than gravy and onions and potatoes? Tando. Let me show you. Let me show you how tender this is. Look. Follow the part. Barely even pulling it. Wow. Yep. Mmm. Oh man. And you guys. I'm not going to believe this. They have the big piece of cheesecake. But they have these mini cheesecakes. And they're coming up box of nine. Oh my gosh. Look at how beautiful. Oh my god. There's only one left over a cheesecake. What am I going to do with my life? There's only one left. You guys have got to get them. Absolutely amazing. Like I said, their Obey cheesecake was absolutely the best thing I have ever had. The best cheesecake I have ever had in my whole life. All right, guys. Let's move on. Now let's try these skiers. I believe this is beef. And it comes with this lemon. So it's squeezed a little bit of the lemon juice on there. And then it comes with the sauce. Okay. So let's try that. Oh my gosh. Wow. Again. What the most tender meat. Oh my goodness. Wow. It's sweet. You get that, that a little hint of that, that bitterness from the char. From being grilled. From where that sugar has caramelized. Oh my goodness. Look at that. Super, super tender. I actually think this is pork. This is not beef. These are pork steers. Oh wow. That is heavenly. Here I have it. All right, guys. So next I want to try. This is the Sistine Gang. I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly. The Sistine Gang is like a stew, like or like a soup. Sorry. It has chunks of pork and other vegetables. Oh, that looks like tendon. I'm assuming that's tendon. Or is that a vegetable? No, it's a vegetable. Never mind. No kind of vegetable this is. No clue. Oh. Oh man, that broth. Oh. Well, I didn't put no lemon in here and it tastes lemon-y. No. This is something I want when I'm hungover or I'm not feeling too good. Oh. Wow. Look at the big chunks of pork that they put in here. Mel and your mouth tender. Oh wow. You guys. This is amazing. To drink, we have a cherry vanilla Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. All right. You guys, I'm just going to have to jump right in. So as I mentioned before, no, no disrespect. It's very, very different for me. Very different and unique. I'm not going to lie. I'm a little bit scared. Let's go ahead and move this to make room for this. I'm excited to try it, but I'm scared at the same time. So this is blood sausage stew. I was, you guys, I know a lot of you ask for crispy pata, but loot and all kinds of other dishes. Unfortunately, right now, do certain circumstances with everything going on in the world. You guys have to realize a lot of options or dishes and a lot of small, you know, family own restaurants are going to be a little more limited. And the crispy pata and those type of things are a little bit harder to come by right now. But rest assured, I will make another video in the future with all the other dishes I have yet to try. But I thought it would spice it up and be a little adventurous today trying something that I've never had before. Morecia. Morecia. Oh, mom said this is called morecia and Spanish. This is blood sausage. Now, camera, it looks brown. You guys are promising it's black in person. All right. Very yummy. Hey. What? What? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. My mouth is salivating so much. What? Oh, my gosh. Hold on. Whatever that meat is, is super tender. The stew has a little bit of a tart flavor to it, but savory. Oh, my gosh. I did not think I was going to like this, you guys. Oh, my goodness. I could so see myself dipping like some bread in here, some pundaside. Mmm. Oh, my God. You guys, my mom's over there. My mom got to taste all of this before I did. As I was serving myself, she served herself some and she was like, oh, my gosh. This is so good. Mmm. Wow. That is phenomenal. All right. It's so flavorful. Right there moving on. This is the sissig. This is bits of pork pieces, including the ear. My mom thought it was tongue, but it's actually pork ear. This is what I want to do. Okay. Got to do the right angle. Look at that. Get it. Drip. Drip, baby drip. Oh, look at that, you guys. Look at that. Look at that. Oh, my goodness. Oh, wow. Okay. Now let's get into it. Mmm. Ooh, you know what I love? Right off the back, that crunchy onion. Mmm. And the bell pepper. Or jalapeno. Oh, yeah, that's jalapeno. You guys. On top. So obviously it's soft chunk support, a little bit of the cartilage pieces up in there, which adds like good texture. And then on top of that, they garnish it with fresh onion and jalapeno. Who would have thought that this all would combine so well? Oh, wow. And then the egg. And then the spicy. That little crunch from the cartilage is very reminiscent to when you're eating chicken wings. And you bite into that little cartilage, gelatinous little piece. I like that. Wow. So good. All right. Let's go ahead and move on to right here. This is chicken in a side. Look at that. Let me squeeze some lemon on it. It also comes with lemon. But let's just take a moment to admire how beautifully grilled this piece of chicken is. I'm sorry. I have never been able to grill a piece of chicken. This beautifully. Look at that. Isn't that gorgeous? Oh, my gosh. All right, you guys. So I think I'm just going to go caveman style and bite into this sucker. It just, it is that good. What? Oh. Oh. My gosh. Oh. Wow. If that is not the best seasoned chicken I have ever had, seasoned grilled chicken, I don't know what else is. That is out of this world. Good. It is seasoned so perfectly. I wonder what it's marinated in your eye can tell that this chicken. Have you been marinating it? Oh, my gosh. If you do not go out to Casa Filipina. You're out of your mind. Exactly. You are out of your mind. Wow. I really love these two. I think these would be so fun for the kids to eat. Or if you're in the mood of this gaming, very like tropical, very island, tropical vibes. It's sweet. It has that little char on it from the grill. I absolutely love things that are like that. Whenever there's something that's sweet and I feel like it's been charred or grilled and it gets that little caramelization. Almost just a little hint of bitterness but just the bitterness compliments the sweet so well. Oh, I love it. Absolutely stunning. This chicken right here. And it comes with the sauce too. This is award-winning chicken. Wow. Oh, my God. Oh, that sauce. Oh, that is the bomb. Oh, the sauce. You guys. It's like brinning. And it's sweet. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I can't stop eating it. Wow. This food is absolutely, absolutely phenomenal. Super underrated. If you have not tried Filipino food, what are you waiting for? I know some people are quick to try Japanese, Vietnamese, Chinese, Thai. You guys have definitely got to try Filipino. If you're so quick to try other cultures, excuse me. I highly recommend you guys try Filipino cuisine. It is absolutely the bomb. Oh, my gosh, guys. This has put me in such a good mood. I'm so happy right now. Filipino food. I just want to take the time to say real quick that Filipino people as a culture, as a whole, are so loving, kind, and warm. And I really see in the comment section how they come through. And the fact that so many people told me, like, we would love for you to come to the Philippines. We are a type of people that love feeding everybody. We would love to host you and feed you all of our food, home cooked. And I'm truly honored. I hope that one day soon I will be able to travel to the Philippines and meet all of you and break bread and try some of your homemade food straight from the source. I cannot wait. But for the meantime, this is authentic Filipino food here cooked by Casa Filipina. And it is so enjoyable. I feel like I'm eating with you guys in the Philippines. I feel like I'm in the Philippines. You guys, this is so amazing. So now I'm going to get into dessert, you guys. I didn't get any other desserts other than this because this is the star of the show. This one is the star of the show. This is the same cheesecake I had the other day, only in a smaller size. Let's just take the time to admire this beauty. Look at that color. Oh my gosh. Should I take it all in one bite you guys? Oh my gosh, I know this is going to be heavenly. It smells so good. Cheers to all my Filipino brothers and sisters to you guys. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. I've never had anything that's good in my whole life. Oh my gosh, mom. You got to come try one of these. Mom, you just tripled up on insulin. Come here. Oh my gosh. You have got to try this mom. Just one bite because it's sweet. Yes. Save me the other bite you don't have. Let me know your honest opinion. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. I haven't tried this. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. Wow. Mama's first time, oh hold on. She's trying to get you all. Come here. Give us your real verdict. She just put it in her mouth. Oh my god, this is so good. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my poor mama. This is so good. Oh my, wait. Yes, you can. Oh my god. My mama just said, oh my god. Oh my god. You guys have to go get that. Oh my god. Come on. I want those cheese there to be a secret. If we send them all to go and get the cheesecakes, they're not going to leave any for us. You guys, it's so funny. My mama's so cute by the way. It's so funny because I went out and went in today. The owner was like, oh my gosh. The turnout, the amount of people we had come because of your video was crazy. Hmm. She said, out of all the desserts, they completely sold out of the cheesecake. Completely sold out of the cheesecake last week after my video. She said the whole day, people were coming in and out. We need the cheesecake. The ube cheesecake. We need the ube cheesecake. We need the ube cheesecake. Oh my gosh. You guys, I'm not over at the refrigerator. It is amazing. Let me just show you. I'm trying to find any excuse. To break into a new one. I'm trying to find any excuse to eat another cheesecake. But the excuses I'm going to show you guys the texture. It is so whipped and light and airy. It's unbelievable. Let me just show you. Look at that. Oh no. Okay. I hear mine. Got it. Look at this. Just one swipe. Look at that. Super light. Super creamy. Whipped. And that graham cracker crust on the bottom is so complimentary to the cheesecake. Absolutely amazing. It's so creamy. Very airy. I kind of over explaining very airy and whipped and light. Almost like you're biting into a cloud or cool whip. It has like that very light, cool, wippy texture. The best cheesecake in town. If you have not had it, let me tell you. Just because it's ube, because you guys know that ube is like a purple potato or like a purple yam. I promise you guys it is not gritty. This is not gritty. It is very silky and smooth. And it does not taste like potatoes or yams. It doesn't have that like potato we taste or that heaviness from a potato at all. It has that beautiful cheesy cheesecake flavor. I can't believe I ate two and a half. Maybe three. I don't know. I probably ate the paper on the other one. Because I literally want to turn off the camera. I'm gonna sit here and I'm going. Hey. I'm doing a line out on the camera. That's how good it is. I probably ate the paper. Anyway, you guys. This was absolutely stunning. I want to say a big thank you. Oh, oh. You guys. They did give me the hollow hollow. And unfortunately I didn't want it to melt on the way home. So I did eat it inside the restaurant. I will go ahead and rent the clip now. So you guys can go ahead and see what the hollow hollow is like. It's very similar or close to a Mexican respado. So you guys take a look. So you got to break up that jicacoblan and the ube, or preferably American, all the way down to where all the rest of the food is. You got coconut strips, and on the beans, got a banto, ube hallaya, and then you got two different kinds of milk. The last milk that was put in there is evaporating up. And then there is a secret milk that was put in there. Once you start seeing like purples in the middle, that means almost ready. Oh my gosh, you guys. So I was just giving the hollow, hollow, halo, halo. I'm not sure how you pronounce it. But oh my gosh, this is the best thing I have ever had. I decided to eat this here in the restaurant. As I know it would not make it home. It's super hot here in Arizona. By the time I would get home, it would be melted and liquefied. So beautiful. But if you follow me on Instagram, at Big Eye Appetite, go look at my post, and you'll be able to see what it looks like before it got mixed. Alright, let's eat this. Look at all these goodies. There's so much fruit in. Flan, condensed milk, coconut. Mmm, this is like, like, ice cream and a snow cone had a baby. There's monk beans in here, I think he said. Mmm, absolutely delicious. Oh my, oh my gosh, oh my gosh. I'm like freaking out. Mmm, this is the best thing I have ever had. There's a condensed milk in here. Mmm, let me show you. Oh no, maybe you can't see. Look at all these goodies. Look at that. Mmm. Wow. The best thing I have ever had. Unbelievable. 10 out of 10. 10 out of 10. 10 out of 10. 10 out of 10. Oh my gosh, this is awesome. Oh my gosh, you guys, it was so good. The owner, as you've seen, came and helped mix it up for me. And everybody was just so amazing. They put Lecheta, you know, condensed milk into it. And other items, as he mentioned, just absolutely delicious. So thank you so much to Casa Filipina for providing this amazing feast for my show today.
