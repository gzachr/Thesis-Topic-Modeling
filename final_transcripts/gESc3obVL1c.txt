 Vitya Friday. Differently. This is quite a fun video. You guys have sent us this sort of copulation of singles from the Filipino Music Industry, collaborating with singles from other industries, and mainly sort of the US it seems. So many sort of collaborations that we had not known about. So let's give it a watch and share our thoughts. Oh yes, yes, yes. Kyla? Yeah, they just released a new song actually a few months ago. I didn't know they did it live though. I knew with Jean and no KC and a bunch of them with Brian, but I didn't know Kyla did it live. Kyla also. I don't know when. But they're really great. But here is a joke. Brian is a joke and Kyla is insane. I freaking love this. This was so iconic because I just think about it from from cases perspective, right? Like freaking modeling yourself to this. Doing what you do because you have like, you know, a figure that you look up to and then suddenly being on stage with that part, huh? Jock. Did it once again? No, more settles or something with that, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, this was great. She was just close. What? She had heard her back pretty bad. And she's still freaking murder that concert. Yeah. Damn. That's some inspiration right there. That is the crazy inspiration. Yeah, damn. Jesus. She still did it. Wow. That's crazy. She did it in a wheelchair, bro. And here I am complaining about my life. No, you're not complaining. Fuck. I love this clip. I love how they go and viral at the moment again with, yeah, with Filipino, how Filipino kids battle or something. Oh, oh, my God. I saw that video. And then Brazilian people are going crazy about this Brazilian, this video from a Brazilian show of kids sort of like battling vocally wise. They got nothing on Filipino TV. I don't know if they got nothing, but it's like Filipino music industry and the Filipino TV industry is that's basically that's basically it's singing. What you see, that's why you see the similarities between Latin American culture and Filipino culture is so freaking similar. It's basically this moment. I hope they keep in touch, man. Oh, yes. This one was happy though. She. Right? Bro, can we shake that out? Please, can somebody just request it? Literally, only one person, we're doing it. Oh, David Cook. Yeah. Wasn't that American?

It was it was pick for me pick MTV era was between 2003 and 2006 those three years yeah Wow, I'm sorry. He really just all went to go then came then came teen mom and that's when you knew things were going on Donald Trump reality show. Oh my god. No, but that was the You might do could you believe that would be a one? That's right. That wasn't it's like Something came the president of the United States of America. I think that was where I'm at reality shows I thought I thought we lived in a simulation. I think we did it's so bizarre. I'd never thought well I guess you had a what is that? What's the name? That's prime minister in Britain There has been people who are really famous that then became politicians, right? Boys George. It's right money back out in the Philippines. He ran for president. Did he? Yeah, wow didn't he? Maybe we shouldn't think you know, I know nothing about politics I'm sure Senegra was like the LA senator or something Like can you tell we know nothing about Psycho Regime Alaska for president, you know miss this The look of those women Yeah I SOUND без no Sally congratulations i'm happy how are you? one of those faces and voices that I think they don't really aim. Oh yeah, that's true, it's like you. His face as well, he's got a facial structure where I think it's like wine. So it might get better as the year is progressed, like he becomes more refined, the white hair he was made for that look. Yeah, yeah, maybe he doesn't think so. Maybe he would like... He prevented. But let's go back, he's kind of f**king the moment when she sneezes. Yeah, it's kind of like people that can pull muscles because of sneezes. So maybe it's good, I prevented you from pain. The way Celine de Udstands. I don't have a power range, I do. Which he is though. Bro, I would cry. Oh yeah, this was also a coming. She was being a back vocalist for her concert. That's not matterful. She's gonna be a mama. And she's touring. With a baby in her. And sinking ladies. What is this thing about pregnant women? You know, you know, bearing a baby is already hard enough. And then you want to tour it. You want to do a supermod. Creating a human is like already a big task. I mean, you're throwing up nine times out of him. Maybe she wants to experience what it's like to be touring, as well as being a mother at the same time. Like, face is also an experience of a lifetime. Like, that's essentially what life is about, right? It's like experiences and things like that. So if you do have a baby and maybe you want to sort of have that memory, just do a small tour with your baby. Just think about those vocal genetics that are going into that baby. That's the simulation. Music. It is their choice anyways. Do what they want. Unreal. Magnificent. There we are in the music. Magnificent. Magnificent. Listen, I shadowed to a maker of this video. What a good compilation of things. Channel name is the gangbusters. Oh, with the music. Very nice. Very nice. I like the fact that we got to discover moments that I've never seen in my life.
