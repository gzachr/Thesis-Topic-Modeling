 but Born of all, all in your friends Love is all the maddy downside Wrestied outside Don't need to leave so soon Don't you think you want someone to talk to I've been trying hard to get the talk to you Oh yeah You're dead And the other time I'm the girl What you see Is something that you know Is something that you know Is something that you know Is something that you know Is something that you know Hello guys Today I will talk about Christmas party Yesterday I attended a Christmas party So I'm going to tell you A story about it Actually it was my first time participating in Christmas party In the hope So I had some expectations To attend a party Which person had to bring their own food So we took gimbap and kimchi with us As the party time approached I was surprised that the party was the real bigger than I expected There was a lot of food And the house owner even invited a band for a party There was a variety of food But This was my first time The singing Rachel And as a rest Chicken, beef, Bean soup, pasta, donuts, pizza And dance But the food was bad And there was a lot of beer And wine So it's right like our career And it was interesting When the band first started singing And as time passed The noise was too loud for me And I become very tired The party started At 6 o'clock And lasted until 10 o'clock maybe The foreigner run me Rooked and me very curiously And asked me a various question My neck hurt from answering their question right Why did you come to the Philippines And what are you doing here Right this question Surprisingly, there was a Japanese band in the backseat with us And I definitely felt Right the countries were so close together That their ideas And ways of thinking were very similar So I felt a sense of Cruisiness for the first time In a long time Then my sister Concrete Then she tired And exiled it So I had no choice Or to go to her house Yeah Well Audition week during the party Almost proved me To the front of party Ground And asked me to dance So I danced Is tantally So yeah I was so embarrassed because I didn't know how to dance Yeah, however I think it was a good experience Because it gave me a chance to communicate with foreigners Who were close to me for a long time And I think the baby party culture is really nowhere to Korea Usually Koreans just eat cake And home with their friends or family But in the Philippines They have a party here today And a party there tomorrow So I don't think there will be any time to be bored in December Anyway, after most of the Christmas parties will remain I'm tired So I briefly talked about my favorite Christmas party And my family also reserved a cake For our own Christmas party So I might be able to film On the video Then write Christmas party Yeah, so I see you again in the next video Thanks for watching Thank you
