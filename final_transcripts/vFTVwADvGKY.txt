Oh, it's not wearing your mask. Maybe even wearing it. Who would have found it if it wasn't aware Lee's tornado Developers? Lemon grass wire and these are the dragon fruit there. They're grown through traditionally like that, a piece of wood with a tile on top, aren't they? Yeah. That's very common to see dragon fruit like this. Because they go up like that. Because of the shape and obviously they're quite heavy aren't they as well when they grow. They lost support. So you can see some houses over there as well. What a fantastic view. What a stunning stunning view. You see all of Kananga, you can see Allmok, you can see the Bay. And if you go to the other side you can see far far in the distance. You can see Palompa, Klingaman Island and Sabu. This is a really, really stunning view. Undiscovered place in Lati. It's an interstoprened September. An interstoprened Fitoris I should say, September 2022. And it is an eco farm. They have a lot of dragon fruit here. It's not far to get to from Kananga proper. And probably about a 15 minute drive from Kananga proper is really, really easy accessible even in a car, such as ours which isn't an off road or isn't a four-wheel drive. So this is very, very easy to access. And there's even more guests here now. You can see the distance. This will be very, very popular. And you can see all around. You can really just appreciate all of this part of Lati. Great, great view. Just think for Adam. Think of Tumbling down. There's a river down here somewhere you can hear the water. This is beautiful.

It's delicious. We still got some camote leaves at home which we found in our peanut. That's going to be coming up. A bit later in this vlog or in another vlog, but we harvested up peanuts at home. Give us an idea of what we can do with some of our old camote leaves. Now we're going to stay for food, are we? Yes. It's going to be one of these places where a lot of people come for selfies and photos. Great three top tuners here. Everyone's looking for the next big place you can come to take photos, aren't they? Yes. Instagram famous, that's why it would be. With the nice view, why not? The dragon fruit farm is a bit full of the road. This is the eco park and the restaurant. Wait a minute. That's a food soon in a minute. Wait for the sun to come down a bit. Yeah. Absolutely. It's going to be amazing. This is the popular Philippines, wine, coconut wine. Super. Tuba. Tuba in this day, I don't know if you know it. Tuba itself? Probably. Probably good too. But yes, Adam will try it later when we get home because we're driving at the moment. So when we get home you can try. Absolutely. It's like one year old now. It's nice, isn't it? It's clear. It's clear. You know, you know the story of Kananga, Adam. The story? Yeah, there were two different kinds of story of how Kananga got its name. How is it? Yeah. One is the pop tales, which is talking about a beautiful lady named Anga. And she said, a good taste tuba like this. And every patron of Anga, when they are asked where they're going, they will say Kananga. Kananga. Meaning Anga's place. It's very good. Very good. I'll go to Anga's place. And they will say in our vernacular Kananga. Kananga. Kan means two. Two, I think. And then the place is at the name of the place or a person, Anga. So story goes Kananga. And the other one is the same topic name is there was beautiful scent of flowers called Ilangila. And we have here Ilangila. And you know the scientific name of Ilangila is Kananga Odurata. It depicts likewise story of Kananga. So Kananga has more Ilangila and trees. And it sends early in the morning and 6 o'clock and likewise 6 o'clock in the afternoon. And smells good. So we have here. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Thank you. And yeah, you need to taste this one. Well, it's definitely. Thank you. So we'll try this. We'll get home this. Too bad. Can I? You want to eat? I have this one. It's fantastic. You want me eat? Yeah. And there's this fantastic sunset. So we've had some food out there now.

And we're going to come back here many, many, many times. And later, you may hear there's not much to do. But there's so much beauty like places like this. Always worth coming to, always worth trying something new. When you're in the Philippines, you can follow the tourist trail or you can go off with beaten tracks, so to speak. If you do that, you'll find places like this. So the sun's starting to get down on us. Here are the crickets behind. Really quite a beautiful place here. So in Leite, definitely worth coming here, if you're in Kananga or Mock, bye bye or wherever. Anyway, really in Leite, it's definitely worth a trip. You won't see many places like this. Really high, got a great view. And it's just beautiful all around us, especially at night, the lights are going to come on any minute now. Really, really beautiful place. It's good to support local business. Yeah. One of those places where you're not going to find by driving, you're not going to come across it back and you're going to need to find a place like this.
