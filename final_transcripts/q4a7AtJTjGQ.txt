 Good morning guys and welcome back to Dimmigette. I've got breakfast for our hotel so in 7-11 I'm having the cheese sandwiches they're very very nice I haven't had one for ages it's a bit hot at the minute but we're still thinking what to do today we're in two minds for them to get a bike we're not too sure because there are some places you want to see up in Valencia but apparently you need a motorbike not a scooter I suppose that's what you call them and I am well I've never ridden a motorbike I'm not ridden a motorbike so we're not sure we might just rent one and cruise around to see some of the spots in the city because we know the boardwalks are going to be really nice so I don't know we're going to eat this we're not sure if we're going to get a bike actually a hotel is charging like 650 for a bike when you use a pair of 300 and some of the places that we want to see are apparently way too steep so it might just be an explorer in the city centre today we are just outside the city centre we're pretty about at my walk so we're going to get a trike and without luggage it should be 10 pesos per person which is really really good can you believe how good a price the tricycle is to be fair it's really close we probably could have walked but it would have taken us a lot longer the boardwalk is lovely it's up there it's lined with like palm trees palm trees and a cagey trees here it's just a big open space I'm wondering what they have here I reckon they would have like some kind of event here don't you yeah well the festival's going on at the moment yeah the festival's going on we've got to see that as well I think that's not for two weeks so we're lucky we've arrived at like the best time we're actually excited about that the our tricycle driver yesterday hopefully your tire is fixed and repaired he told us about the festival it's actually the festival of festivals called Brooklyn Santa goes on for two weeks in October and we're lucky enough to be here now in October and in the evening I think there's lots of shows going on lots of lights lots of fireworks lots of red horse lots of tandem by so I hope for the evening we can check that out it's really nice along the board they've got like loads of bars and restaurants actually overloading and so we've popped into infinity to get like a really nice cooler because it's so hot there's no breeze today it's very humid and the sun is shining so I've gone for two regular and that copied me I did actually it's got to be the first time I do view again yeah speaks for itself then that was so needed I'm actually now moving on to a bit of Molly's one was a bit a bit a bit sore throat I think I love air con throat but we're still not sure whether we are going to run the pedal not but we like to see it self-social out they say it's the city of gentle people am I right Molly yeah city gentle people everyone so friendly here obviously for the parents are friendly they seem extra friendly here in the mid-day we don't get the pedal thing we're just going to do that I see it's always going to walk around itself and just find all the monuments the cathedral obviously we've seen the boardwalk just around this lovely little town it's such a university town so quiet so chill we've made it to the public market it's huge it goes in for miles like if you can see behind me it's crazy there's literally so much in here and now heading into another alleyway we've got food clothes you've got everything in here it's like it's huge got like little sashis a coffee tins and got your cartleri for dick it's very very local great thing so we popped in into the Lee Plaza and we managed to get three t-shirts because they have loads of t-shirts that were from 49 pesos to 199 pesos which was unreal so we treated ourselves to three t-shirts we just popped into the supermarket as well because we got some doggy trees and we're going to go and give them and hopefully the dog takes it from us it's now just fined in some straight dogs normally we see loads now we can't seem to find any but it is really keen around this we can't find any thattle I'm sure we'll find some though and the whole pack of dentists there so we need to find five or six dogs so we can get them all away oh my god he doesn't even want it he doesn't want it go on you can have it he didn't take it we gave it to him but he didn't take it he didn't trust us he's like he's there and his little creeps next to him so hopefully as it let's get up we got there in the end he finally took it he didn't trust us at all he said we didn't trust us but we were watching from behind the car and he was creeping so close and it's just so sweet it's nice because you know he's going to take that so I can enjoy it take it off and share it with his mates but we now got we're on the hunt for some more we're actually going to check out is that a basketball tournament in town so we're going to try and find out and on the way to the basketball tournament any dogs if you're in the area comment below because we have dentists put it down yeah the second one just didn't want to take it they're just so so timid when it comes to you they're like they're not used to people wanting to feed them like that where it's hopefully we'll have it later he did sleep next to it in the end but we're now next to like the all these buildings are really empty you can't find where the basketball is going on with water for ages of our loads of people the map says it's just round the corner but I have no clue where we are they're all like it's all abandoned I don't know it looks like it's abandoned I can hold university maybe but it looks as if there's a sport centre here so hopefully we're not too late and the the match is still going on so we've made it to Matt Sias sports complex and probably not an ounce of that correctly and it was a lot more walk because our maps said that we could cut right but we didn't cut that right so we ended up going all the way around and cutting in and all we're here at the basketball tournament which isn't on which isn't on it's just locals playing I quite like that though I did expect it to be big celebration yeah but I feel like there's stuff going on the whole day every day at different places so therefore you know maybe not everyone goes and sees everything and also people might be at work either at school it's during the day but I mean this stadium is a lot bigger than we thought it would definitely hold a few thousand but obviously there's no tournament going on I'm sweating so I think we're gonna head back to the room because we want to get out tonight and see the celebrations properly and hopefully find a few more stray dogs because obviously we're being good some errands today and we're back in the room oh my god the food at Alimas Cafe which is next all to our hotel is unreal we popped there after we'd been for a city wonder walking around the city and the heat makes you so tired so we literally come back eight and slumped but now we're up we're ready we're getting showered Matt's getting showered I'm showered and getting ready because tonight we're going to go and check out Bugglerson festival and our hotel said it's really good we've had loads of recommendations for you guys and as we said earlier we are very lucky to be here when it's on so we're going to go and have a look at that it's really nice do make it eat is known as the city of gentle people and I think the dogs are slightly too gentle they didn't want to take the treats from us um one out of three took the treat from us um and actually as we were on our way back from the cafe to the hotel I did actually give another dog a treat and they sort of dance around it they kind of don't really know whether to take it or not I think you have to build trust with them so I'm hoping that our treats have gone to one of those little doggies that need it and it's made their day without we have made it to Bugglerson 2019 entrance is right here it looks huge it's actually on for two weeks like we said there's so much going on I don't know how to take it all in I just need a sandwich like to get me going this is like the entrance here it's free entry it's free for everyone you can hear all the noises there's so many people so many stalls the elicit is that our first Filipino festival in the Philippines this is crazy so every stall that we've seen so far has been part of a municipality I don't know whether it's a whole of Negroes or Intel but you've got manduad municipality with its own stall you've got bindoy over here with its own municipality stall I don't know if they're trying to promote that part of the island it's really cool but they've got these like manmade structures like you've seen the waterfall you've seen like the bamboo heart it's crazy I mean shock I thought it was just gonna be quite small but it's actually massive there it's just so much here I love this little fountain here I'm still on the hunt for my beer but I found a huge Sammig pilsen bottle they've got like the main stage over here all the tents with food like farmers is actually a bad on a 10 30 tonight if we make it that late I've got busy day tomorrow it's incredible and we were so lucky we didn't know that it was on we just stumbled across it like we didn't plan to be here for the festival itself we were just lucky to be here at the right time I think we found our perfect place look at the side a lot I'm literally down look at the size it's almost as big as me when you went down there that is huge huge spotless Sammig so obviously in the right place you've got restaurants and bars restaurants and bars we just got a pick one to get our beer and this is incredible we've got like some cool little thing engraved which you would have just seen the last little bit of a little key ring it's amazing he engraved it right there right there you can have whatever you want it but I do really wish that this this Sammig pilsen was real so surprise surprise we have our Sammig go light and we did actually have three but we drank one already because we are fast drinkers is we are actually going to get a bit how I think is don't know how many drinks you can fit in it but the music is very loud at the moment so I can't film too much because it's a copyright but the main stage is on at 10 30 and we're going to go yeah
