Happy Tuesday afternoon.
It's drizzling.
I'm in downtown Tanawan.
Going to walk around and meet peachy Filipinos, friendly Filipinos for training.
There's a light drizzle.
Rainy day walk in downtown Tanawan.
Gonna walk the tubes, which means walk the streets.
I don't even know where I'm going.
I decided to walk the other way.
I think there's a market down here.
I'm gonna look around at the market.

I'm gonna go in the market.
