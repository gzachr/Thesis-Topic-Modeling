 Good morning, what a beautiful morning. Hello brother. Okay, two people probably go faster, I hope. So that's why we're done last night, very good. Let's piss off that bike out of the way. This is Gongong brother. Hello. That's my little baby, my big baby is gone. I'm going to get my breakfast. Where are you going? Where are you going? Here's my girl. Hello. Hello. I got two people, hopefully we'll be finished today. Here we start again. Lily, it's so naughty. Lily, it's so naughty. Are you sure? Open your mouth. The housemaid's gone, do some washing at the river. It's not far from here, it's time for a new walk. Anyway, today is all about panting and installing. Not much else. I will get all the pipes pant as well. And the gutter will have a touch up. I haven't planned to put anything on the sides, but we'll have a look later. They're lab brushing their teeth. She loves the past, yeah, very testing. That's it. Come on, my love, you've got to brush your teeth. Usually she brushes, no problem. Maybe it's sore because she... She got so gum. No one anymore? She just wants to eat the pant. She loves that past test, that's all. Nice, huh? So, what are you going to do? Oh no, you know touch my stuff, she can throw it away to this. I'm trying to set up a new spy camera, but how can I do that? No, baby! What are you doing, little chickie? So, can I set up my camera? Yeah. Big cigarettes. Again? Yeah. It's good for me. It's good. Oh, big run, huh? Yeah. You know, he ran fast. He ran a lot for long enough, unfortunately. So... Do you want a hug? Anyway, we've got some rules now towards, so it's okay. Blaga! Let's get some coke for the boys and us. What? Let me go up. It's not going to be the same. Open your mouth. Open your mouth. You lost too, having a good time. It's funny. It's beautiful. It goes along together. Yeah, a lot of painting going on. Phoenix. And then we finish. It's finishing the last part. Wind. Wind, huh? Wind, huh? Wind, huh? Wind, huh? Wind, huh? I like the PVC pipe in green. Fucking good. Three more to go and it's done. I just came back from deep bulog. I had to rush and get the proper screw. Because around here nothing. Short, thin, skinny, I don't like it. I'd rather have power and bring the right stuff. More running coming, which is good. I got a lot of water collection here. I'm having a lot of orders. You can order. She's going to be rich than me. I order some meat with... Flainty, everywhere. Luck is the same color. So the wardrobe is still there. I'm fish. I can't. Soon. Okay, it's all done. It's actually big. I'm in dinner before going to bed. Okay, well the roof is done now. I need to put some fascia on the sides and the back. I don't work out yet what I'm going to do. You may like to give some ideas, but we'll see. We'll see. We need to put something. Bella is doing shopping as well. Yep. And... Wait. Anyway. Okay, this is all the fittings. All those pipes. All together. Because they're only 90 meters each. We need 400 meters or something. I don't want you to pay for the pump. That's probably going to be the most expensive. I don't know. We look here. I think we need at least one horsepower. I think we need at least one horsepower. I'm going to put it in the middle of the roof. Oh, I'm going to put it in the middle of the roof. I'm going to put it in the middle of the roof. And I need a lighter. We've done everything in the floor. We're about to hit the road for the mountain pump house. We've been told it doesn't run up in. It's on the wrong door. It's tank. Oh, super cool. The car was going to go off. We're just going to stop for a little bit so we can reach the car. I have to think about getting some kind of roof from there to the house. There's somebody moved up in. It's not the right position. Yeah, they both coming with us. I don't know where Mimi is. Probably hiding. Oh, yeah, here she is. Okay, let's go. Oh, there she is. I think she can be there. Lucky. Oh, bamboo. I think she's going to be there. Yeah, keep filming. Looks like we had a small typhoon before. I mean, not a big one. I told her because here we don't have a big typhoon as such. There's been a very strong wind with a run. We've done a U-turn because the weather is not good. We've been told it's raining the mountain up there. There's no way we're going to make it. It's really bad. It's not safe so let's go home. Oh, there's a lot of wind. Oh, there's a lot of wind. Oh, there's a lot of wind. Oh, there's a lot of wind. Oh, there's a lot of wind. Oh, there's a lot of wind. Yeah, good morning. Thank you for everybody. Coming to our last stream. We just finished it and guess what? Somebody rang. Robert rang. So he'll be here next month. A lot of you have been wondering and asking. So he's coming back next month. As good to hear. Okay, that's it for this video. Thank you for watching this video and to the next video. Take care. God bless you all. Bye bye. Bye bye.
