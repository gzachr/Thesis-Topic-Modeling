 Three communication tips, whether you're visiting or living the Philippines, it'll make your life easier. Stay around. I'm going to give you a bonus tip at the end. First tip I'm going to give you is lip-percing. Lip-percing is a form of communication that's used for two things. One, for pointing and two, for getting someone's attention. For example, a point you get a cake you want to buy. Double-perce lips. I'll know exactly what you want. Or to get a waiter's attention, go over in their direction. Not your head. Now, I'll get their attention. The second communication tip, raised eyebrow. It can be one or two eyebrow. Let me explain. Hey, babe. Want to have chicken and rice? Philippine has got to have their rice. The third communication tip is asking an either or question. Let me explain. Doesn't matter what your question is. Do you prefer chicken or fish? Do you prefer yak-food or bellow? Nine times out of ten. The answer will be yes. A bonus communication tip, asking a question three times. Follow these easy steps. Ask your question one time. No reply. Ask your question the second time. No reply. Don't worry. Ask it a third time. You'll get a reply. Perseverance is off. And if you haven't subscribed, please subscribe. Pumping. They care.
