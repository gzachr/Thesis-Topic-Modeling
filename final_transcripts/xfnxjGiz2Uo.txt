So, Waluchita, it's Walucha. She said... She's not feeling well. Seven days away. She's kind of losing her voice and stuff. She did do another festival last week. And it was outside. It was really cold. She performed about 40 songs. And that was not ideal. But it was a good crowd, it was like 1,000 people. Yeah. And you know, like, Walucha doesn't really rest. Because, you know, we do so many videos and we're working on new channels as well. So I'm kind of pushing the shit out of us, well, probably when she should be resting. She shouldn't be talking, yeah. And we have to do a podcast today and then we have some interviews to do as well. So, pop, pop, pop, the journey, I guess. It's just normal. It's been a while since we've sort of worked at this level and sort of this intensity and the... ...stab responsibilities and stuff. So, it is pop, pop, the journey. And you need it some drama, yeah. For those YouTube likes. Goodbye. It is Friday day of rehearsals, September 30th. It's gonna be great. I'm actually quite excited. The rehearsals today are gonna be super dope, I think. We're the last people to rehearse. So it's gonna be like a long day, but I'm so ready. You have no idea how ready. Walucha gets new. I do. Not even for the performing bit. But I'm mainly for the... The talking. Like talking to people. Again, it's weird, bro. Nice, relaxes. Relax, totally chilled. Yeah, good times. Bye. Hello, hello everybody. This is rehearsal footage in the site.

Jimmy, completely honest, I'm losing my voice. Like, I've been having a really tough, couple of weeks with no voice. You do that, you guys will see the blocks and stuff. But Mali wasn't speaking. Like, my point is... Yeah, I'm actually feeling it right now, but I hope we did a sound too bad. That partnership of Ogiyal Kasir, I know, Jane. It's like, I don't know, aliens came together and they put it... God, put them together, it's actually unfair, you know. We actually reviewed on the channel. I think the first singing contest that she won in the Philippines in the 80s. It was... I think I know what you're saying. Is this someone where you've ended in Japan? I think so. Yes, yes. Here's the girl. You see her, you listen to her now. And then you listen to her then and you're like, how she's maintained that youth. She's in a better now, it's okay. Tell me about it. Her hostess won't be a bit crazy with her. You don't want to believe it. No, it's funny. The rehearsals are very late back. No way! It doesn't even go well. But there was this one rehearsal. Just recently, like, I think a week ago, yeah, they were rehearsing and... I just caught my wife, she was in tears. Because it was too much power, you know? Wow. I do. I think she can make you sad. There's a memory of me when I'm talking about that. But I think it's like a person in a mirror. So I thought I'd make a man. But in a pino, there's a pain in the throat. I'm glad I'm this one. Oh! That's easy standing in out there. I have to say it's one of the most surreal things to watch. She is who I am. She is my teacher. I work in society. People who work in society. I love you.
