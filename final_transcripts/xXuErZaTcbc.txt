 Ba, do you guys know where we can find some cold spots around here? Like some uh... At the end of the English. Like the like hidden tourist spots or like some really cool, low-key things to do around here. I know it's the best like... Like as I get a little bit of a heart attack, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, Mamutag mo nga ba? Mamutag sa anyotanan? Karong ed lawa mo bohaton ang English on the prank. So I'm gonna approach some people and speak English to them. And then after a little bit, we're gonna speak Bisaya to see their reactions. Pero ba ko tamang prang sa ilaha? Gusto ko magpa salamat sa atong sponsor Karong ed law. So today's video is sponsored by Surfshop VPN. If you don't know what a VPN is, it's a virtual private network. Meaning it's your online security for when you're cruising the internet. So if you ever use public wifi like if you're at a hotel, a restaurant, a cafe, then you're gonna wanna use a VPN. When you're on public wifi, anyone can spy on what you're doing. You don't have to be doing anything sneaky, but that means they can see credit card details, your login passwords, whatever. So you've got no one to use a VPN like Surfshop. Another reason we love using a VPN is to get cheaper flights. So travel hack for you. If you put in your country, say as the Philippines, rather than the US or Australia, then you're probably gonna find cheaper flights. You could also use this for hotels and maybe even car rentals. Another really common reason to use a VPN is if you want a Netflix and chill. So for me, I love watching my shows from Australia. And when I'm traveling, I don't always have access to them. But when I use a VPN, I can set my location as Australia and watch all my favorite shows. Alright, so that being said, we have a QR code here in the corner. So go ahead and give that a scan or you can hit the link in the description for 85% off. And you get three months for free, so there really is no reason not to try it out. Plus they have a 30 day money back guarantee, so there's no risk involved. You can try it out if it's not everything that you expected it to be. You can get a refund.
