You know the best like
Like
English only prank
So i'm going to approach some people and speak english to them and then after a little bit
We're going to speak bisaya to see their reactions
So today's video is sponsored by surfshark vpn if you don't know what a vpn is
It's a virtual private network meaning it's your online security for when you're cruising the internet
So if you ever use public wi-fi like if you're at a hotel a restaurant a cafe
Then you're going to want to use a vpn when you're on public wi-fi anyone can spy on what you're doing
You don't have to be doing anything sneaky, but that means they can see credit card details your login passwords, whatever
So you're gonna want to use a vpn like surf shark
Another reason we love using a vpn is to get cheaper flights
So travel hack for you if you put in your country say as the philippines rather than the us or australia
Then you're probably going to find cheaper flights
You can also use this for hotels and maybe even car rentals
Another really common reason to use a vpn is if you want a netflix and chill
So for me, I love watching my shows from australia
And when i'm traveling, I don't always have access to them
But when I use a vpn I can set my location as australia and watch all my favorite shows
All right
So that being said we have a qr code here in the corner
So go ahead and give that a scan or you can hit the link in the description for 85% off
And you get three months for free. So there really is no reason not to try it out
Plus they have a 30-day money back guarantee. So there's no risk involved. You can try it out
If it's not everything that you expected it to be you can get a refund again
Thank you surf shark vpn for sponsoring this video and let's go prank some people
