 Hello everybody, welcome. Hello, hello. This is going to be our very first reaction video to Filipino singers. We have been asked, oh countless times to react to Filipino singers. We didn't think much of it until we got to the Philippines. Yeah, exactly. You know what happens at 7 a.m. when we step outside the door? Filipino singing. Filipino singing. You can hear karaoke pretty much anywhere anytime of the day, all day. And that is why I'm sure why there's so many amazing singers here in the Filipinos. You start very young, you learn how to sing, you're not afraid to sing, and you get up there and you belt it out. So today we're going to react to this absolutely popular YouTube video done by Lumuel Lyons official.
