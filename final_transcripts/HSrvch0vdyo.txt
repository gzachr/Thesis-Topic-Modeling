 You're gonna love it! Yeah! Look at that! Look at the ball! Woo! Who's that? Are you touching his gun? I just... Oh my gosh! Oh! Oh! Hello! Hello there! I would have romantic ride! Wait! Who's that? Who's that? What's better than two enchanted ladies? A whole enchanted kingdom! You're like by three enchanted ladies. Yeah, that's true. That would be true. We are heading to the amazing enchanted kingdom. There is star city here. Wait, it's very close. I know. But Pauline said no, no. We're gonna go to the really big amusement park here. It's just outside of Manila in Laguna. So... Flash Island to Laguna. Oh, we've already been to Laguna. Alright, we're going back to Laguna. Oh, look at that. Look at that. It's a small world. Yeah, it's kind of big here. But yeah, yeah. Really excited. Going to have a party. Going to have some fun. Because... Amazing, Pauline. This is her idea. So of course it's gonna be fun. And because, if it's since it's my birthday month, I get in for free. The shuttle's not free, but I get in for free. It's a free cool. I think it's cool. Now, we are on the shuttle bus to the magic. Look at that. There's very few people on it right now, but they're still 20 minutes. We're in 30 minutes until it leaves. So we'll see how full it gets. We're in the back, so... Yeah, back in the bus. That's where the cool kids go. The cool kids go to the back of the bus. Yeah, it's the loudest. Yeah, that's right. This is where we cause all the problems. It's very cold in this bus. It's like off the people behind you as well. Oh. There's no one behind you. You can't see anything out there. It's so cold in this bus. Like crazy cold. So... I'm sweating. Oh, I thought I almost did wear this, so I'm gonna have a little... Yeah, at least you're dressed for this cold. It's a perfect legs. My legs are the legs. My legs are there. I see legs. I got legs. Herrial legs. Yeah, so I got the herrial legs. Why don't we get to do? They have a medical pass there. They have a medical pass there. They have a medical pass there. Oh, right. There we are. I think this is gonna fog up. We arrived. It took about 45 minutes, so it's not too bad. Bus ride was nice and clean and fast. Little cold, I guess I said. But we made it. We made it here. The girls are excited. Hello. And you've got your wizard. Yeah. Oh, you want a picture with the wizard too? I think we got it. It looks until six. That's cool. I winÈÅ∏ it. More pictures. More pictures. More pictures. Can't get away from all these pictures that this girl does all the time. Go check our Instagram out. That's where she puts them all apparently. Maybe. Some of them. Well, it looks pretty nice here. Super clean. Everybody looks very happy to be here. That's loud. One's a year back, man. How many are 12 years ago? One's a year, 12 years ago? One's a year. How many are 12 years ago? Up until 12. When did you last come? You were 12? Oh! Well, hopefully things have changed since you've been here. You're up here? More rides. Alright, alright. I'd give you an idea. It's about 400 pesos. It's a couple hundred more pesos if you want express pass. So you don't have to wait in the lines. And you can't get a good rest cut if you have your birthday. You get free entry if you're to your birthday month. We could just get in and then upgrade her pass. But no, it's not allowed. So unfortunately, we still had to buy hers. Oh, I'm wrong. It's 1800 pesos for the express pass. It's 400 pesos for the reggaard. It's quite a bit more, actually. Yeah. Oh, wow. Didn't even realize it was that much more. So the rides aren't on yet. It opens at 11. So they let you in. If you're going to wait until 11 o'clock and then they all start running. That's apparently their new roller coaster that they just got the twin spin. And there's someone called a rocket ship that's apparently pretty good too. You're like, what's for dessert? I was like, I could stand on this. Me. Ooh! You're the dessert. You're going to fix your shirt, too? No. How's the ice cream? Good. There's sprinkles. Mango vanilla. Whisk sprinkles. Don't forget sprinkles. Okay, we're cultured. Why did you talk about that? I got no sprinkles. Because I'm not a girl. Loser, huh? First ride of the day. It's one of the new rides here. Called twin spin. Twin spin. Ride is done. We weren't allowed to film, but that's okay. Because I was a hot mess. It was fun. It was a lot of fun. And apparently the girl they sat beside me was screaming swear words the whole time. I never knew that word before. It starts with a G. Three or four. Yeah. Get in there. Get in there. Wait, wait, wait. Who's that? Are you touching his gun? Oh, what? I just polish it. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh no. Take your children away quickly. Quickly. Take them away. So most of the rides so far, other than the one we went on, I don't open till three or four. So keep that in mind. Three o'clock. Oh, here we go. There's hours of all the different rides. I'm not new. Yeah, summer noon. Okay. Summer after lunch. Okay. So yeah, different hours for different rides. I don't know if it's a staffing thing. But we'll just keep going. Keep going on rides. Were you a swinger? And it was nice because it was like cooling off. Yeah, it was a nice breeze. It is humid but not sunny. Yeah, and like the fun is trying to poke out. It's trying to poke out. But it's not there completely. But there's no wind. Not even a breeze. There's a shadow. Take a picture. Take a video. Yeah, very nice. Look at that. Five and ten cents. Five and nine. Oh, that's very loud. I don't think it's five cents or five pesos. Most of the things still remain closed. I don't know if they have a different time they open. Or if it's just not busy enough yet to reopen everything. Yeah. The movie theater here opens at 12. Oh, that's cute. There's a little Emporium over there. Okay, there's the bigger roller coaster right there. It's a space shuttle. The Swan ride is open. Terrifying, I know. Oh, massive. That's a screamer. That's one you screamer. My wife's a little strange. In that she loves spam. Even in Canada, she was all about the spam. It's not weird. Okay, I hope you guys roast him for thinking I'm weird. In Canada, it's unusual. But look at this. Look at this. A spam station. Yeah. You can get your spam cycle. In case you want a spam cycle. They are sold out, by the way. Sold out of the spam. A spam prize. Spam. Who's to be with egg? Spam hash brown. Spam dynamites sold out. Sorry. Just imagine what the taste of a spam cycle will be. When you can have some. Yeah, frozen spam. There's many things I will eat. Frozen spam on a stick. There's a lot of them. There's a lot of them. Wow, they're popular though. Look at that. They're popular. It's like romantic. There's waving at the bottom. Oh, hello everybody. Hello. What a big group. Are you all family? One family? Wow. I have a feeling this place gets really busy around three o'clock. Apparently. Maybe because of the sun, he's usually baking at this time. That's probably exactly what it is. Oh, paintball wars. Yeah, 200 pesos for 30 rounds. Yeah, I gotta tell you. You can fire 30 rounds at about four seconds. Wow, look. Well, look. Maybe they're paintball guys are one shot at a time. Look at this. It's open. It's open. We can take the air race. Who's going to be the winner though? Oh, he's here. All right, girls. Your moment to shine. I wonder how much money falls when people are upside down like that. Oh, this is the best place to work, I bet you. So there you go. A wallet went flying and the guy who works here caught it. So obviously he's giving it back. Yeah, it happens. Money goes flying. Woo! The girls are walking like they're drunk. That's what happens when you get turned upside down. You think you got drunk or something the way you're walking? I just cut this upside down and it was like, oh, I feel like you're going to get out from here. Yeah, I was down here and a wallet came flying and landed right by me. Yeah, the worker coming grabbed it. Yeah, I felt my mask was like lifting off and I'm like, oh, I'm going to go straight into the middle of me. Yeah, that was a good one. That was a good one. Nice. Okay, so you're saying this is the top ride here. Okay, okay. Space shuttle. All right, you're going to get up there with NASA, man. Whoa, whoa, whoa. He is a gentleman. He helped you up. Very nice. All right, we'll see how you feel about him after the ride. Yeah, I'm okay. I held her hand. Oh, my gosh. My legs are shaking so much. I think this one's for the win, then. I want to go again. Whoa. You're like crying, that's why. It's therapy. Crying therapy. Oh, that was fun. That was fun. The backwards. That experience was insane. It was a good feeling. Inusual feeling. I like the backwards part. But I think because we were lower. I'm going forward. I literally, my stomach just left me. It left my entire soul. My soul is gone. I'm fine. You're so list. You know, it goes really well with that ice cream we had. More ice cream. We're kind of binging on the ice cream. Because it's so hot. It was humid. I thought it was cooler. But the three makes sense. It's hot. It's hot. It's hot. You could draw it. Exactly. Yeah, this is a test for my arm. So. Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! It's a hand. Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! This place is a lot bigger than it seemed from the outside. There's quite a few rides here. They're having a lot of fun over there on the boat. Yeah, yeah. Really, really cool place. Still hasn't filled up here. But at the front, there's a heck of a lot more people coming in. And the afternoon gets a little better on weather wise. My voice. You got lost your voice there. You were screaming. I was, I was having a good time. That was a screamer. And it was a competition. Yeah, it was like, okay, well they can't scream louder than us. We have to scream louder. They clearly won. Because they had a couple people on their side. They did. We finally found the rides that are more your... S.O.S. This is a child ride. There it is. There's your roller coaster. I can probably handle that. I might only cry a little bit. You probably still cry. There's a truthy train over here. Goes in a circle. Perhaps the balloon ride would be more your life. Really cute. They're all adults who are sitting in there. Come on. There's no kids in there. Tell me that doesn't look good, eh? Look at that. Ooh. Yeah, look at the prices. 79 pesos. 99 pesos. Pauline and I were saying that it looks like that we are taking our child on a balloon ride. Yay! She's older than Pauline, of course. That's what makes it really funny. It's even better. It is. This is the express line. Yeah, the express line. It's not even a line. No, you just kind of stand at the exit. And they'll let you in. Honestly, I think we're the only ones that bought the express pass in the whole park. Yeah. Yeah, we have like totally no lines. It's pretty crazy. No one else seems to be in our line. Well, for the price difference, it makes sense. Like from 400 to 1800, clearly. Yeah, it would have to be very busy before anybody like other than us would be willing to pay for it. Okay. Your first hot air balloon. Oh, the breeze is nice. Oh, my goodness. It's like air balloon today. Let's do it again. It actually goes at a good speed, too. All right, all right. The magical green is too cold. That was a good one, especially to cool down because it's praise water and it blows wind. Even though it's already air conditioning. Yeah, it was really good. It was a fun little thing. Yeah, I was a cute animation. You even close your eyes. Oh, yeah, I did. Oh. Yeah, cool. Here we go. Who's hungry? Who wants to eat? I don't. We got some SIG SIG and some more SIG SIG. Fourth of log. Welcome to the vlog, y'all. I got the SIG SIG, I got the hookah, I knew it. What this is. Just eat it. Yeah. What the? Oh, look at you. You belong. I belong. Come on. Get in there. Come on, Bernie Rebel. What was that? My grandmother. Is that your tear ductile? Yeah. Hey, just a bit of a live and well. What? It's for kids only. This is ages of, okay? This is ages of, okay? This is how you look at this slide. Just pretend somebody's kid is yours and then just go up with it. Oh, I just have to go get my child. I'm just a child. You might have a couple questions. You might have a couple questions. It's a train, darling. Oh, there's no light bulb in it. There's no steering wheel. Do you think trains can go lecture right or do they follow this track? But how do you pick? Oh, it's... Wow. You thought you steer a train with a steering wheel? It's a little bit. I thought there might be a little steering involved. I'm sure once upon a time there was a train that steered. Oh, somewhere. Somehow. Oh, my God, it's full of adults. Wow. Wow, you guys are afraid of the other one? And apparently there's no shame if you're an adult. You want to go on this one? It's fine. We're all here for the same reason. Oh, I'm so happy. Oh, all righties. That was fast. Oh. Woo, woo, woo. Oh, we're gonna kick that one. I'm gonna kick it one. I'm gonna kick it one. I'm gonna kick it one. Okay, just go over. Oh. Wow, wow, wow, wow. Wow, wow, wow, wow. This is great. Oh, this is amazing. Woo! Come here, come here, come here, come here. Go hide. Oh, yeah, come here. Oh, wow, you escaped it. Oh, I'm scared. Oh, I'm scared. Oh, I'm scared. Woo! So we got all wet and we're like all worried about being all wet. And guess what? It started raining. Yeah. We're already wet. It's just out of the way. And then it started raining and it was like, oh, we don't mind anymore. It's still. The sun is still trying to poke out. It is dry. It's not going to last long. No, I don't see any dark clouds. No, it's really good. It's been really good today. Right. And it doesn't look like this is going to be any lightning. No, yeah, it's a blessing. Yeah, because that's normally when dry clothes. Yeah. It's like there's fun here. It's like there's fun here. Hello. Hello there. Why would a romantic ride wait? Who's that? There's that. It's not just walk. All right. This one you're not supposed to get is wet. But we only said that so Pauline would ride it. Because I'm the unlucky one. Yeah, the one for you. You're the one for me. You're the one for me. At least I know I'm not going to go anywhere. Because you are thinking, hey, hey, hey. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm not a bad guy. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. That wasn't as bad as my. Wait, my camera. Oh, yeah. The weather is bad as well. No other good ones still to come. But I still wet. Right. Oh, we're back to back to, woo! Alright, up we go! Oh! Please, look at the leg! That's hard! Oh, this is going to be so good! We're going to be lovely, huh? I know! It's kind of a shock situation! You can just wake up and go down the square. We're down the screaming. Here we go! Oh, yeah, I'm scared at all. Oh, oh, oh, yeah! Woo! Oh! Oh, yes, we didn't get wet at all! I got wet! Not at all! If we get to stand up, we're going to get wet. There's our... There's our... We're going to get wet! We're going to get wet! Woo! Hey! Hey, we are now about halfway through the day. I tried everything, I'm pretty sure. Everything we're going to try anyway. It's very, very wet, which is okay because it's super hot. We don't mind being wet. And the water rides really do help in the middle of the afternoon. You really want to save those for the hottest time of the day. And then, later on, when the sun starts going down and it's starting to get beautiful, and they have the fireworks here. Yeah, then you do the carousel and all that stuff. What do you call that? Ferris wheel, not a carousel. Well, the carousel look pretty at night too, when it's all lit up. But yeah, the Ferris wheel, when it's all lit up, it'll look really nice around here. Really picturesque. Yeah, it's all lit up! Yeah, it's all lit up! Oh yeah. We're going to see something like that, 40 movie. And apparently it's all about the best spots to be found in the Philippines. And it's based on the Agula which is the national eagle in the Philippines. It's big, it's a big bird. It is a big bird. It looks like scary bird. I wouldn't want to be that bird. Anyway, so yeah, and then all of a sudden a bunch of people from the environmental health and safety came along. So we're the only ones not wearing blue it feels like. It's kind of cool. We won't get lost. We'll be able to find each other really easily. It was awesome. It makes you really want to see all of the Philippines right away. It looks so gorgeous. There's so many places I've never even knew existed. So you got to check this out. You're going to love it. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! I love that. Look at the bulls. Woo! Wow! That was amazing. Wasn't it great? It was a bit like a wild animal. It was a bit like a wild animal. It was amazing. It was awesome. That was cool. I loved that. That was amazing. Wasn't it great? It was amazing. It was the best. I loved it. It was really fun. Alright. Back to hanging out. Back to hanging out. The sun is setting and it's absolutely beautiful now. This is the perfect time to come. Nice and cool. Sun's not beating in your eyes. And there's a lot of people out. Everybody's having a great time. I love this place. Really nice. We went on our own adventure and we ended up with a coconut halohalo. It's going in. It's overflowing. It's crazy. And then we walked in and we were putting the chain up. And we almost got chained in. Yeah. I don't know. Are we the show? Yes. You are the show. So this is the head and the hook up. Yeah. We got a little seat going. Alright. Let's see. Okay. We're on our way to the sacred fire rituals of one of these mysterious trials. The Dangerous Amazon Jungle. The Dangerous Amazon Jungle. The Dangerous Amazon Jungle. The Dangerous Amazon Jungle.
