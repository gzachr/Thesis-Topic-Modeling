I mean It's look I've never heard of drinking etiquette ever so this tells me That that y'all there's a science to this the right way in the wrong way to do it right I'm interested that speaks volumes I'm ready to learn come on Philippines The tangaro also called the gunna and one of the distinctive Caraties of the drinking culture in the Philippines assumes an important role now prior to the commencement of the festivities A small portion of the intoxicating liquid is poured into the cap and subsequently emptied onto the ground This ceremonial offering to the spirits is considered essential for a safe and devil three Session the tangaro pours the drink every time measuring the liquor by eye The participants are not given individual glasses This is an accordance with the tradition of baguette which means a show of trust Come raddery and in these days a united willingness to enter in a COVID Russian roulette as drinkers share a common glass Past in a round robin sequence. It is frowned upon Yeah, okay so far so good. I like that he judges about I Depends on how you feel You look like you can take another one you're gonna fill a cup up. Okay, so why I just want cup.

So when they take in about a 12 pack You know what I'm saying they're going for more It's crazy like how liquor can just sit different than water in your body. I actually like what You have the conversation with the wrong person so come on people the comments section Okay, okay, okay, okay, yeah, the real conversation I don't want I want to forget the two of the day so far so we did the walking day and then we did Drunken master in the 10-year-old We didn't do the thing.
