 Arbor one, hi Joe here again. Today I'm going to show you how as a foreigner to cook rice without an electric rice cooker You can do it by hand, and it's really easy to do, so let's get started Okay, so first they come in these bags right here. It's kind of a clear plastic bag. It's called a lava This is one kilo, break it up and you just put it right in here just like that No big deal. The next thing you're going to want to do is is rinse it off several times. I do it four times In tap water when you do this Just rinse it around like that and keep pouring this out Just like so until the rice is clear. So I'm going to do this three more times and then get back to you Okay, I've arrested four times now. I'm going to start pouring in the mineral water And the reason I'm doing it like this is because this particular tub is almost empty I want to measure this water with with my thumb meets my finger right here. So if you confuse let me show you I know they're going to need more. I know I've done this many times. All right, so put my hand in I check the rice so there you go See how that water meets my hand right there? All right, so that's enough Okay, so turn the gas on in the Philippines. Everyone uses gas mostly and We have an oven a western style oven Most Filipinos use a smaller range. Okay, and It's now just a matter of putting it on there and I put a lid on it I'm going to cock it off to the side a little bit my wife really gets irritated with that But if you don't it's going to overflow This takes about 20 minutes to cook and that's it You just got to keep watching it turn the flame down if it starts to burn and in 20 minutes is done You don't need an electric rush to go all right, so if this is hey Joe do subscribe
