 Good morning, Jules. Good morning Lee. How was the trip to? It was good, don't you? Really good. Look at that bike. We just talked about bikes. Yeah. That's Lee's new bike. Yeah. That's one. Everyone's one now. Yeah. Well, that's mine here. I got the scooter. That's what I'm talking about. This is what's more than that though. I look at this one. Harley. We had a bit of a sleepover. Boy sleepover party last night. Good morning. How was your sleep? It was good man. Thanks for letting us crash here, bro. No worries. The boy slept in the, uh, did you do the culture or the mattress? I'm trying to tell you what I was saying. I'm trying to get some crazy things. I shouldn't bend. I'm just sleeping under the floor on the head. Just as the floor. Oh. Breakfast. Ooh. Thank you. Check this bike out. That's crazy. So that's Charlie's bike. Lee's thing Alex. Juice. But the best bike, of course. Is Anna. Right, Charlie? My bike is the best. Yeah, I'm going to lead the way. I'll just have to be careful to not draw too fast. So this is definitely one of the nicest things about this place of four. There's only like third day in here. And we have almost a full house of friends all the way from Sebu. I put the host them and now we're going to go on a small road trip on this southern side of Necros, or Yattal, through Darwin, through Samboquita, all the way to a place called Tampobopay, and then to Cookus Nest, where we're going to have a lunch and maybe dip in the water. All right, first stop. Hydrostation, and then we go to epic cafe Tampobopay. Scooters for the win. Still hazy, guys. I don't know if you see in this guy. It's really hazy, so it's not dark blue. It's going to milky blue. I don't know what's going on. Remember last year there was like a fire in Borneo and the wind direction went straight over Visayas. It kind of looks like. They're going the other way. Are you really low? Are you really low? Check it. This gas station is called Shane Gas Station. I think it's like a local one. Never heard of this branch. Looks like the bar is open today. I think it's every Wednesday. I love the bar. How was it ride bro? Oh shit, it was a nice ride isn't it? Yeah, it was good. It was a little bit different than symbol. Yeah, definitely a bit of outer. That is right, the main load here. It's not the main load in Chibur. That's the quality. Basically it is. It's great. This is a saddle really. It's like this road is come down. It's like the main load, yeah? It's not better. All right, we come to the place called A B Cafe. Actually, I'm a tour guide today. I know this area looks like the back of my head. I've actually never been to a B Cafe. So I guess we're going to grab the repost. This is Tambobobay, we'll show you in a second. Can't pass you entry. Ew. Whoa. This is awesome. Bambu Cafe here on the left. But an awesome view here. We're taking off our old sailboat. That's the dream guys. That's the dream. It's got to win that lottery ticket. Keep buying those lottery tickets. The dream one has never tasted so good. Man, all of this is less. I've heard stories about some of the boat owners here that came into Philippines or were in Philippines before the pandemic started and they basically haven't left. So if you're sailing around the world right now, it's very hard to go to certain countries. A lot of them have just stayed here. I also asked the people here how much it costs to dock your boat and it's only 500 pesos a month if you have an anchor. I don't know how much it is for the moring line, but anchoraging super cheap. If you do it in simple city and the marine knot, I think it's like 80 bucks a day or 4,000 pesos. But there you get at least electricity and water connection. But here's nothing. It's just like an awesome shelter for the boat. And you can just see how many there are here. Really cool. I hope one day they bid like a marine knot so they can fix some boats, do some maintenance. That would be pretty cool. Out there in the distance is my dream boat, the lagoon. There. Okay, awesome quick stop over here. Some coffee and now we're going to drive to Antulong where a cookus nest is and have our lunch maybe dip in the ocean. Alright, take it the corner to Antulong. We're going to find a cookus nest. There you go. Hey, oh. What next, sir? Yeah, but is there a vision? No. How many are you? Just five. Five? Yeah. So you need a reservation? Shut up, we're probably. We can be quick, just eat and... Alright guys, if you come here make sure you do a reservation. We've got denied entry. So that's a popular idea. It's the turn to one. Yeah. So we're going to check out the Antulong research that has ever been there. Alright, made it to Antulong Beach Resort. Hello. Name. I'm very ready for the next visit. Alright. Hi, I'm Daniel. It's my boy, not 36. Ah, this place is massive. Low to rooms. The cliff side is over there. I'll show you guys that in a second. Very nice. It's about 40, 50-minute drive from Darwin. And we dove in this area before. It's a really nice dive site. So different from Darwin and some paguita because it's all corals here. Is this a restaurant? Restaurant? Ah. Breakfast. Thank you. Hello. Is this the restaurant? So in there, can I check the view? Check out this view. That's nice view. Look at those massive fishing boats. They still got super hazy diggers. Normally you would see a sea kewer, even sometimes minden now. We don't even see Antw Island. Apparently. Where's the Alphomanse people? They barely see it. Yeah, so we're not going to eat here. There's like 300 paces entrance fee. And it's not consumable. So the boys want to go somewhere else, which is understandable. I hope you know I said it was consumable. Very strange. So behind four lunch continues. This is the funny thing. Me and Arni were talking about they got these big bikes, the Harley's, the racers, but our scooters are always faster. Don't know. There must be way behind. They don't need for fast bikes at the Philippines. Just get yourself a scooter. It's all they need. Alright boys, third time is the charm. Made it to one of our favorite places. The beach cafe, Malatabae, awesome dive here. Maybe we'll just have a snorkeling. See if I can see anything in the shallow, but man, we're starving. Third restaurant is ready. It's lunch time baby. It tastes good. It's delicious. There we go. Oh what is that? Fuller. You got it right? Awesome food. Who ordered the king of love? Me and juice. Take a bike guys. Tell me taste test. I'll see you with king of love. Try juice. Go. Cheers. Let me go. What do you mean? Hope is spicy. Wow, it's spicy here. They're good. That's really good. Nice. Spicy. You got one as well. No, this is one in your two. This is one in there. Oh that's nice. It's really spicy. That was good. Alex! How was the dive? Good, very nice. I see the... Please cut two. Oh really? Yeah. Where? Same spot we were diving. And that reef, what is the small reef here? Okay. I'm going to go to the beach. I'm going to go to the beach. I'm going to go to the beach. I'm going to go to the beach. I'm going to go to the beach. I'm going to go to the beach. I'm going to go to the beach. I'm going to go to the beach. I'm going to go to the beach.
