 Hi! How's it brother? How's it going? Let's come to the winter! How's it going? Welcome to Philippines! Thank you! How much for this? This one sir? I'll be on the local video. Yeah, can I get one? I need. You want butter and salt? Yes please. Are you from sir? Oh you are. Yeah, welcome. You're welcome. Thank you very much. Yeah, we are. Thank you. Thank you. Nice to meet you. The first time we've ever had grilled corn in the Philippines. We've had other variations but grilled is the first time here in Baguio. I got butter and salt on it. Oh look at that. It's like caramelized. Look at that. It's caramelized on there. And these two sticks because it's so dang big. Here we go. Whoa. Whoa it doesn't even taste like corn but it's grilled. It kind of tastes like popcorn to me. That's really yummy.
