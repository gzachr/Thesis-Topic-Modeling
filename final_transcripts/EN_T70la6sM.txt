You guys Cody here Hours later trying to upload this video That you're watching now And we actually had a problem We reacted next to the breeze Good experiment commercial And YouTube for some reasons having a problem with it And they are blocking the video We cannot get it to work Major copyright problems Because of the song that's played in it Not sure how other people are getting it posted But for some reason we can't get it posted To be honest We thought it was all right But we kind of thought it drug a little bit So sorry that we're only doing two videos in this one But we didn't expect this to happen This hadn't happened on any of our other videos So very sorry about that But the only other thing we said is that we will be back for more reactions In the future Let us know what else you want to see Next time we kind of want to move away from commercials At least for one reaction And react to other Filipino-type things So let us know what else you would want to see And what else you would want to see And what else you would want to see And what else you would want to see And what else you would want to see And what else you would want to see And what else you would want to see And what else you would want to see And what else you would want to see And what else you would want to see And what else you would want to see And what else you would want to see And what else you would want to see And what else you would want to see And what else you would want to see And what else you would want to see To shoot and to shoot and to shoot and to shoot And what else you would want to see And what else you would wanna see And what else you would want to see To shoot and to shoot and to shoot Number one week And what else you would want to see And what else you would want Marc was already pissed And what else you would want to see And what else I would want to see And what else you would want to see
