 Look at these guys. It's like a jeepney but it's not. Hello guys. Look at this. Come on. Don't leave your saliva in it. Wow. Mabooha everyone. We are in what seems like a modern European city. It's absolutely gorgeous. Some of the best architecture you can imagine. Beautiful shops, very, very nice shops I gotta say. And beautiful streets and sidewalks. We were absolutely shocked. It's so modern here. And we are in Ilo Ilo. We're not in BGC, not in Makadi or something I got. This is unbelievable. Who knew this was down here on the southern part of West of Versailles? I had no idea. And we are absolutely shocked by this when we got here. So we're gonna give you a little tour of it today so you can see what we can see. I highly recommend you come to see it for yourself though. All right, let's go. I'm gonna show you what it looks like at night. Because it's absolutely stunning. Once all the sun goes down. The lights all come out and wow. Twinkling, shining, absolutely beautiful. This is the place I was looking at. It's beautiful. I'm going to look at the sun. I'm going to look at the sun. The sun goes down. The lights all come out and wow. Twinkling, shining, absolutely beautiful. This is the place to go once the sun comes down. Also, this young lady is going to do some in IRL Twitch streaming while we're doing this walk. And so she'll be able to. We're gonna see how it works. Yeah, we're gonna see how it works. And so in the future, maybe there'll be other times where you can join us and you can be chatting with her in real time while we walk around to different, to some of these different places. And then if you have any questions about them, we can answer them in real time. Really cool. Look at this. Toys for the big boys. The Elo Radio Control Sports Club. That's so cool. Look at the helicopters. Ooh. So, black hawk or a patty. Wow, that's pretty cool. And this is called the Marketplace. It's quite big. It goes all the way around the corner here. Of course, she will always address this. There's some traditional ones there that she would look fantastic. You got some live music going on here. That's great echo here. Oh, you want to talk to Michael, mine, you'll pay whatever, whatever. Still a little unfinished up here. Some parts of here are under still under construction. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Still a little unfinished up here. Parts of here are under still under construction. And I feel bad for the island tea people because they opened up up here, but there's nothing up here right now. As you can see, everything else has not been fulfilled. But, yeah, I guess at night, this is going to be pretty. So we'll have to come and see. There's a big cat here with a lot of lights on it. So I'm assuming that's what that is. It probably all lights up. But yeah, they have a little rooftop garden here. None of the shops, like I said, are open yet. A lot of them show different levels of construction or just available for lease, but nobody's in them. And I believe they have a church up here. They do. They do. St. Joseph Chapel. And there are masks on Saturdays. No, just Sunday Mass. It looks like, yeah, Sunday Mass 11 to 12. Those mountains in the distance are where we crossed over yesterday by motorbike, while we went around them because of the bad weather. And you can see how the clouds all sit up into them there. So they get all kinds of different rain patterns that we're just not getting down here. Although it does look like we'll get rains very, very soon. But it is very pretty. There is a lot of open spaces out here, but I have a feeling mega world who owns this whole area. Probably owns all that land too. So it's probably future expansion, new condos, all those things that they want to do. But yeah, so there's a little glimpse over the wall, type of thing, where it's not part of the mega world project. She's still over there. Streaming away, having a good time. There must be big plans for the third floor because they got all these walls here. And not much of it's available. But I noticed here that they have it opened up over there. So there's plans to expand and get much bigger. I'm feeling this was all planned out and started building before the pandemic. Sounds like some live guys music going on. There you go. There you go. So as you can see, it's just a full on wall. It has everything you would imagine at any wall. All the big brands are here. Anything you want to get, you're going to be able to get it here. And it's still under construction. So much more to come. Look at these guys. It's like a jeepney, but it's not. Hello guys. What are they called then if they're not jeepneys? Vanneys? Like a pickup truck extended? I don't know. What would you call that? Not even sure. Okay. So as you can see here, a lot of big companies here. You got big hotels. There is a lot of similarities between what you see in projects like BGZ. And it makes sense. It's a corporate owned area. It's not really a big area. It's not really a public property. It's a private property. And therefore they can keep it cleaner. You can see the guy is painting right now. And he's redoing the street painting, which is really nice. Hey, hey guys. No, no, no. But yeah, it's really, really pretty here. A little more traffic than we normally see. Usually there's a lot more people on foot. And I don't see that. There are no electric scooters that I don't see on the sidewalk. So that part hasn't come here yet. But it is. It is very, very pretty. Very, very clean. Look at this. It's actually really, really, really modern. I love it. And that's how you moonwalk. So right here is the Elo-Gelo Convention Center. It's actually really pretty. I bet if the fountains were running, it would be even prettier. I wonder if even the flags aren't up or anything. If it just hasn't reopened. Or maybe it's just because it's a weekend. I'm not sure. But if the fountains were running and everything, I bet that would be really pretty. Now look at that. Elo, Elo is hiring here. Free HMO for yourself and your family from day one. So there you go. If you're looking for a good job that includes health care for you and your whole family, right out of the gate, they are hiring. Really big construction projects going on in many different areas here too. So it's expanding and it's expanding very quickly. Really wide sidewalks here too. Look at that. She's out there streaming right now. Look at all the distance she has. A lot of room for a lot of people. And I do like how they separate the streets. So they have this curb here. And so, not guys going the wrong way on a road. But whatever. Hey, hey, hey. So was that guy? So yeah, if you, this way, the main traffic isn't stalled by all the people stopping and trying to turn into different buildings and parking lots, I kind of think if you want to go for this section of buildings, you have to go into these lanes and the main traffic can keep flowing. So it's good. It's really smart. Different towers, different things. These are the thin tech towers. And we are in... I don't know what kind of towers. I forget. Sorry. We're in our own set of towers. And then all the towers on that side of the street are all named the same. So you have one thin tech place, two thin tech place, three thin tech place. Same with where we are. All right. So it keeps going. And you can see there's construction in the distance here. There's lots here. There is some condos already built. You can see back here. But for the most part, this is a massive construction project to extend the whole mega world section that's already there. And these are called techno place. So one techno place, two techno place, three techno place. So I guess it'll be really easy to get around in this city. Shouldn't say city. It's not a community built within the city. Where we are, it's one Madison place, two Madison place, three Madison place. And maybe even goes further than that. And that's how they're doing it on our buildings. What's up filming the filmer? Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Say hello. Say hello to the vlog chat. What kind of vlogception is this? Vlogging a livestream. Live streaming the vlog? Um, I'm just going to see. Oh, look at this. Oh, look at this. Oh, look at this. Look at this. This is amazing. Hey, so all this street food here is really well priced 69 pesos, 99 pesos for hamburger, spam and egg. That's my girl's favorite. 49 pesos. You got to pay for that spam. I don't know. But yeah, so like all kinds of great foods here. All in one spot. Just bang, bang, bang. One after another. That is so great. Oh yeah, so she sees a bunny over here and she's like, oh, that's where I need to go right down. It's called Tokyo, Tokyo convenience store and it has a bunny. But it's just a convenience store. Smart advertising. There we go. It's genical. I know you guys. Look at this. Wow. I gotta tell you, when I walked by it, I thought it said candy museum. And so I'm like, oh, I want to see this and then I show her and she's like, oh, brandy museum. That's more her style for sure. She loves her brandy. What can I say? You cockroaches fit. Nobody, I've never heard of that. She just found out the cockroaches bite this morning when a giant cockroach was in her room. And she was like, wait, what? All right, we stopped here at a Philippines cuisine place called Odoy. And it is beautiful. You can see it from my balcony and every day I'm looking out while we're only one day. Yesterday and today, going, I have to eat there. It looks fantastic. So here we are at Odoy. How do you say it? Odoy. So bad. Can we put it on? Yeah, that's beautiful. Look at this. Oh. It's so good. It's a little bit thick and it's good to have the whole. It looks like a chicken. Wow. It looks delicious. There's any guys. And look at this. For those who like it spicy, we got a lot of spice. It's all good ingredients. All the way across. Fresh, fresh, cut vegetables. How long have you been in business? Three years. So three years now you've been in business. Wow. It looks like you've been here for a very long time. You guys have owned it and everything. Like the recipes really well. You can see that everybody knows what they're doing. That's it. Well, I'm excited. We got the beef curry curry, both of us. And so we're really excited to try it out. All right. So we got our beef curry. There. Thank you. All right. You get the big bones. Is that the big bone there? The crazy thing is I'm not that hungry. But at least it's just like one... Did somebody made your breakfast? Yeah. I also had ice cream. So, apparently I'm not like the smartest person. Okay. So what? I'm really happy. I'm really happy to decide over it. I'm so happy. Hey, do you get it on board? Oh, you don't eat with it through your hands? Nice. Good one now. Good one. And I can't... Don't leave your saliva in me. Wow. We just got all of the things. Wow. All right. Here we go. Beef curry curry. All right. Here we go. Beef curry curry. Carrot curry. Carrot curry. Never had it before. Ready? You got a vegetable. Not even beef. Wait, where's the beef? Where's the beef? Where's the beef? Okay. Beef is here. Not it? All right, cheers. Oh, it's good. It's good. Super tender. Really delicious. Lots of flavors. I love this sauce. Actually, it's really, really good. It's like a sweet... Sweet potato sauce. Yeah? Mmm. Even the vegetable taste is okay. Love chewy. And like, what is it? No, green beans. What? Wait, what is this? I don't know. All right. This is green beans. I know this is bok choy. I think it's a green beans, right? She didn't see when I went to film it. But all fresh and green. You can tell right away. Oh yeah. Oh yeah, I couldn't have not. Because I was trying to see if it was. Oh wow. That's really good. That was in a truck with me too. I see you're not. But you know, not at all. That's really, really good. We love beef carcass? Carcass. Carcass. Carcass. Can I have a car? Carcass. No, I forget what I said. And I called it. And now we're doubting what we were told. It's delicious. So, we like that. No rice giving me anxiety. I'm hungry. We want rice. Listen guys. We rice all the time. How big does it go? I'm done. I'm done. I'm done. And it even looks 10 times better in the evening. Get ready. We're going to go for a little tour right now. With all the beautiful lights. Check this out. I'm done. I'm using an easy piece of cake. Oh, oh. New slash. And candy. So yeah, look how they lighted up how pretty it looked. How elegant. What a beautiful area to come to. I'm from the... I'm from the... I'm from the... I'm from the... One of our viewers told us, by the way, that yellow yellow kind of translates to early Spanish to mean shape of a nose. And it's because the way this area is, they Spanish thought it was like a shape of a nose. I thought they were trying to like bully the people who are here. Yeah, no, no. It's a hot name because they learned noses. No, it's because they thought it was, yeah, in the shape of a nose. So there you go. Very interesting fun fact. And we aren't to say elo. Because just elo alone, and Vesayan means something apparently something different. And they said you don't want to say it. So, elo, elo city. There it is. Let's look around. But they're not. They might get wet. Yeah, yeah. These mountains start shooting up all of a sudden. Randomly everyone gets so keen. So you can see here, everybody's taking lovely pictures. We have this beautiful statue of general, Tielfil, Tielfilo del Gado. The great hero of Panai Island. I'll see how beautiful it is. Wow, 1858. 1858 and passed away in 1918. There's this really historic building here as well. It's really well lit. And here it is. Here it is. Pass the pass. The golden arches of the... The golden arches of fast food glory. It's a McDonald. Also known for being the hero of children. Everywhere. Everywhere, yes. The mascot of all children. Oh, that's funny. Alright, let's go and check out over here. You guys know us? Yeah! There we go.

If you are looking for a place to move to, you're like, I'm not sure where. This is a good place because it's not too overpopulated. And all the modern communities are here. So, huh? Good night.
