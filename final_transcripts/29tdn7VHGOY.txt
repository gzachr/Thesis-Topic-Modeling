 Welcome back to D&J React with music sparks conversation every day in today's conversation we have another casual Chuck special this one's Filipinos who made Pinot's proud part three we did part two already right it was at part one we did two and one yeah we've done both of them have we yeah absolutely 100% okay yeah so this is number three so we'll link the other ones at the end of this video but with that being said it's not wasted any time let's jump in let's go think like I'm an in you'll be alright well Reyes what can you say this mine was like Einstein you know he had the greatest ability to think and see his shot to no one else could see the zigzag shot yeah amazing do you believe he was going to make that shot I thought he was uh I'm sure he was just trying to hit it and he made it but the way he kicked it he had another way he kicked it the ball and I I stood to this day I understand why he kicked that way he could have kicked the other way but he kicked the way he could win yes yes he did a head scratcher but a genius let's take a really good look uh two slits but the most dangerous awesome shot his legend was so famous that some aspiring pool players had all their teeth removed just to replicate his success what oh makes him more arrogant than him my guess it worked meet the magician effor and batarees he was born and raised in bampanga he's the fifth child among nine siblings it was quite a big family to keep a float so at age five he's dad brought him along to manila to have a better income to support them effor it was a shy kid growing up and struggled to interact with kids his age so instead of playing outside he worked as a spotter and a janitor at his uncle's billiards hall called about the thirteenth he made it his home as he played billiards all day and slipped at the pool table every night this is when he started gambling at the very young age he was so young that he was too short to reach the pool table so he would stack some cold cases just to make some of his shots this was when he got the nickname batat to distinguish him from an older effor and who also played pool in their hall as effor and continued playing he kept rapidly improving until he beat every player in their home so at age 21 his uncle started bringing him along to bigger money matches the hustler booby was very popular at the time so gambling at different pool halls was a thing effor and was beating everybody there was a time when he went to cloud airbase to literally farm dollars from american soldiers and because of this his name had become a terror in pool halls and he started running out of opponents so his income from gambling started to run dry he had no choice but to work for a local comic print in press which paid him only 90 pesos or two dollars a month he wasn't satisfied with how much he was making so he just less than a year he went right back into playing billiards in 1975 effor and started planning a trip to the US to play against american pool players but an american sports writer apparently had been taking notice of him while he was beating everybody this writer went back to the US and informed their best pool players that a new threat is emerging his name is effor and raised because of this the americans were able to scout him and found out about his reputation so this ruined effor and spland to hustle american players for money for those who are confused hustling is kind of similar to smurfing it's like a mythic player playing in the grand master rank in mobile legends to farm easy wins in anfranc case he wanted to farm wins which translate into dollars to support it you know it's funny about the whole hustle culture of this is my uncle your brother and Chad used to be a poll shark back in the day and he was telling me some stories when i was in san diego that he used to go to tampa and florida and hustle people and like he wasn't good at all on like the first two or three rounds and be like alright let's go double or nothing double or nothing that's how we paid our rent yeah and you just he kept going he kept going and then you know at the end the last round it'd be like three four hundred bucks on the table like blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah all the time yeah look alright guys they're gonna go we did it a lot of times you know i would go together and we'd have one of his friends and i mean i could play decent nowhere near like my brother or his friend his friend actually did the ESPN tour and played there did really well but yeah man we would go and i would go and just kind of like challenge guys and i would lose my money lose my money and i'd be like oh bro my rent man this somebody helped me out and my brother would come up and he'd be like hey let me play for man let me just try to get his money back we got pay rent and he would get on the table and he would lose a little bit here and there you know and win some back lose something and all of a sudden he would just be like just all the way around the table take it and we'd be like all right thanks guys that's awesome dude that lasted until we had one guy we took a thousand dollars from them got out to the parking lot and he met us out there with a gun and it was like all right gave him the money back we didn't worry problems he took it left but yeah i was like i'm done with that shit man yeah i'm not getting shot at this sketchy yeah it was pretty bad it's family in order to counter that obstacle he decided to take on an alias sesar morales this allowed him to play everybody in the US and beat everyone of them billion hole after billion hole he left the trail of destruction leaving his opponent demoralized not knowing what hit them like iceware his story almost sounds like a backstory of an opiate and a sensei who looks like a joke but when an action transfers it to some kind of a forbidden folklore beast anyway it's mostly days continued in the 80s until he discovered a big money tournaments he entered under his alias and went on to win his first ever tournament as sesar morales this gained him it's that fans but when he was asked to sign one of those autographs he accidentally exposed his identity because he subconsciously wrote his real name and because of this his hustling days were over so he focused on playing and dominating tournaments under his real name he quickly earned the nickname the magician because of his aggressive style of play and shot selections that no one even the greatest pool players dared to attempt especially in high pressure situations I've been out of the box you know really those shots is one thing but making them consistently just puts the man in the league of his own watch the night now just like this one everyone was just a vice-ender of some younger professional players playing pool were taking too long in planning their next shot so they had an over the acoustic to effort they had no idea that effort already saw the shot from a mile away he did it with his bag on his back and a hanky on his hand here are more examples that's what I'm looking up oh you don't know what everybody like what how do you do you kiddie bro that was like three corners he popped off though aside from these amazing shots effort is also the author of the greatest shot in pool history he was playing against one of the greatest pool players at the time Earl Strickland the match was very close as they were tied at 12 rags each in a race of 13 match whoever wins the rack becomes the champion Strickland did the break to pocket the two ball then attempted to pull off a safety play hiding the one ball behind a seven and eight ball but he failed to do so so effort to advantage he then handled business as usual oh it's just a little bit I said what the eatin' they have to do to them you see what I talk about the match right now how did he do that he got himself with the trouble because the six ball was slightly blocking it but instead of doing a safety play effrended this was the eight was the eight oh my god how does it even like my headball an impressive shot for sure but this wasn't the greatest shot it was talking about because this shot has gotten him into an even bigger trouble this is the cue ball and this is the object ball all three other balls are blocking every auction after enhanced on accepting a safety play let alone hitting the object ball was virtually impossible but despite the predicament it's every over-seed to leave his mark by pulling off the dead shot and the history of billions the iconic the shot now he's not no way oh do you know this belief including his opponent effrend is even had the chance to finish the rack because his legendary shot obliterated all the hope that was left in straight was body as he proceeded to shred their short leave after that what a finish this got us red his third straight championship winner the sadst regency open so libedifying his case as one of the greatest pool players to have ever lived what I like the most about effrend is despite all his success he remained humble while some opponents with blacks on him and breaking the balls very well so that's that's good for me I haven't played pool 40 years I feel like I'm playing perfect I feel good I feel very comfortable just looks like a one-man show you know then that's why this game is the toughest game on the planet it usually just respond with humility well I don't know if I play English or I'm playing bad as a high-dick not get to play and then for these two kids disappointed a high quality dulyard seminar yeah you're on the cellar that's pretty good over here in the section and after embarrassing them did you usually just say this iconic line I get laughing too if they are like this I wish before maybe I don't ever tell you show how to not money for me effrend's career is definitely full of legendary moments but it would take me hours to show them all for now let me just do the honors of flexing his unmatched achievements the magician effrend bat the ray is it's a winner of over 100 international titles he's also the first player ever to have won the wpa world championships in two different pool disciplines namely eight ball and nine ball a four-time sats regency champion a 13-time Derby City classic champion and a two-time world champion sparkler jungle was the man there to this day he has earned the respect of not just his countryman I don't have any friends I don't have a friend in the world I have a friend in my dish Andreas but also for the world he's so good they really get it cool cool yeah some of the best pool players of all time to see on my wall out there I have two photos of sign photos of Filipino pool players effrendrares and Francisco Busca magic top 10 effrends probably number one ever most people agree with that the best player on the player that I really always like this effrendrares I looked up to effrends effrendrares he's on the sky I grew up watching when I was young you know he's probably the best of the little things probably live in like an idol from in basketball there is that Jay it billiards there is that friend it bowling there is by uncle boney legend is a six-time bowling world champion and gilis world record holder not to mention a global bowling hall of fame he's considered by many as a sports good greatest of all time rafa elpa anglipo muceno was born and raised in kesson city his dad was a bowling coach but he first fell in love with his part of bowl and he was even doing great competitively on one faithful rainy day young pa anglipo got to bring his umbrella so he had to take shelter and that shelter turned out to be a bowling alley from that on he did nothing else but school and bowling with the help of his dad's coaching by ang's potential was unleashed as he became a Filipino bowling prodigy and became the national champion only at age 17 two years later he would join the 1976 bowling world cup and upset everybody as he claimed the championship at 19 years old making him a record holder in the gandas book of world records as the youngest world champion ever wow this is pretty cool i think he's double and why does he have the same character as six is Elvis Presley and that's right that's a little like Elvis yeah most people thought it was a fluke until by ang came back four years later to bag another world cup win he was 23 year old angnapple muceno he was a striped play bowling world cup champion angnapple muceno from the Philippines he became famous for his accurate strikes despite having an awkward south ball bowling arms wing let's just have a look at never muceno when he clears here that looks as though he's off-balling but of course it's an illusion or a bus player he wouldn't be three times a work of winnow watch hey it works warm it works it works yep step off the suck and loss the cases the man literally proved that looks can be deceiving time for winning shop coming up right now it's on its way i love it it's on its way then he was looking for a missile of a man who says i'm number one and those fans who made it all the way here from the Philippines know that they are looking at the world champion for the third time in his career angnapple muceno comes through on the wire and steals it in the tent of kraboski through the title away angnapple muceno would then go on to continue dominating the sport for a total of four decades as he would win a total of six four four years and hold the total of four world records making him the undisputed gold in the sport he carried our flag since day one making his entire nation proud he looks like he has like a cyclist to buy yeah like a bicycle the world cup title are you going to come back for number five i don't know why the fans are not the dog because i have to give credit to you're very moved obviously and and so are we congratulations he's so so comfortable this day he's still active in the sport as the only Asian coach to have the usbc gold level certification continues to hone the skills of the younger generation but the angst generation is just one of a kind because another phenom was also wrecking havoc in the different department the world of speed leia di i de vega was born and raised in becauille de la ca in her childhood she rarely became the aide with playing tag with friends because she was just too fast this got the attention of the schools of letting coaches so she got invited to try to compete in the sport of track and field leia's dad was a cop so he was very strict with her so she kept her training and secret until her dad started noticing her getting tired more often which led to him finding out about it her tata then gave her a condition that he would only allow her to compete if he coaches her himself leia agreed so not long after she started dominating the sport by winning her first two gold medals in the 1981 C games in both the 200 and 400 meter dash this got her qualified to compete in the 1982 Asian Games this is where the big names compete including the favorite to win the event in just well known speed powerhouse pt ushah and wow the doctor has a nice ride right but where 180 year old leia was unfazed by the pressure at first leia seems to be falling behind in the first place right before ushah but on the 15 meter mark leia shifted gears when pedal to the metal pull out the opposite and getting her first nightroh he's throwing ushah in the process yeah just smoke yeah if she was short as some of the other girls so you would think the other girls having a longer legs would have the advantage i've seen some short girls in the Olympics and they're dude i mean obviously their legs are going like like compared to the longer straight girls that are taller but it's it's insane how far that these sports have come and like i know these are short distance racists but like the long distance like the one mile or two mile run dude there's guys that are running a mile in three minutes and 40 seconds and like two miles and like seven minutes and some change two miles and seven minutes that's fast man you're moving bro that's like an average pace of like three thirty three forty each mile you're cruising probably that would be like my top speed sprinting for two miles straight it's probably those kineans man they're so good and they always win the races they're so fast that's ridiculously that's like a 20 something mile per hour pace yeah you're cruising man so was it going down there on a fight because coming next year in the asia championships she would win the gold against Lydia officially forming arrival ring between the two fastest women in asia their fans went back and forth but who really was the fastest but all the debate would be put to an end in the 1986 asian games so this win solidified Lydia de Vegas title as asia's fastest woman she would then go on to continue her reign until the early 90s a massive total of 15 gold medals of course different competitions to this day and the night of speed behind her beautiful smile will always be remembered as an inspiration for many inspiring young athletes and one of those young athletes is this kid check this out if you enjoy anime like back stories then look no further than Carlos and Riel you love he was born and raised in malade metro manila their house was closed to resolve memorial sports complex so he grew up watching for the pino gymnasts training and competing there so it was only natural for her to take the same path he trained every day at a very young age and it paid off as he won most of his competitions in minor leagues he kept training until he became a teenager despite the countries inferior facilities and minimal athlete support that's until he met the Japanese gymnastic coach when he hero kubimia he was sent to the Philippines by the Japan gymnastics association to train overseas athletes with good potential when coach kubimia's first visit he immediately noticed that this advantages of Carlos training conditions i don't think i have the music on the list it kind of runs hearing this from a coach but i cannot disagree because it does happen maybe it's the reason why this diving team flopped in the 2015 c games that's not good we're all with it everything got started with diverton that's going to leave the mark here he's standing on his back he likes standing on his back following up in a similar passion by y'all and seeing the rotation on his dive to a young knee first so much that's the attitude on to the video sheesh there were no literal slash brothers anyway coach bimia didn't want Carlos potential to be wasted so he offered him to train in japan Carlos grabbed the opportunity but he never realized how hard it would become for him he left his family in the Philippines and started living together with coach kubimia in a small apartment while studying high school at take your university this is a school where mostly elite student athletes go Carlos was only on his second gear he struggled in school because he suddenly had to learn to both read and write in japanese for accelerating his improvement Carlos coach required him to write entries in his diary on a daily basis he started during the daytime and spent the rest of his free time training with his coach our young carlose obviously got culture shocked so he started showing some size of demotivation he would make mistakes he normally wouldn't and fooled down more often than usual coach kubimia's very strict training approach wasn't healthy either focus on going to work again you doing like this then the going to big injury if you don't do that there i'm not thinking again without thinking the don't just training Carlos' diary entries never talked about his feelings so coach kubimia had no clue about what to do with him anymore it was so bad that there was a point when Carlos told him that he wanted to quit there might be both of us for nine years wrong so big or not fucking good knowledge the coach was at his wit's end so he decided to pull off one more trick to motivate Carlos he brought him to an all-Japan national gymnastics competition coach kubimia was one of the judges there and one of the competitors is Japan's Olympic gold medalist Kenzo Shirai this guy is considered as one of the greatest young gymnasts of today no i noticed about Asians compared to a lot of other cultures is they don't just want to do good they want to get on all of it they want to excel and dominate they want to dominate they want to be the best of the best like they don't want to just like yeah it'd be cool to like have this like little bit of wins and stuff like no they want they want a whole thing yeah that's how they're always going to be above and beyond yeah that's how they that's how they're raised and stuff you can kind of see it in their education system the way they perform the way they you know just go about their everyday lives yeah always above and beyond yeah old stew get his world records as the youngest gym has to ever win a gold medal on the world stage at 17 and the only human being who are pulled off a salto backward stretch with quadruple twist or known today as the Shirai the name the trick after yes it was named after him along with five other great moves he invented himself wow that was an absolute genius rightfully earned the nickname Mr. Twister and I'm not even surprised about magic you know somebody that makes up their own stuff like that you're not you might have just realized that he still had a long long way to go but in that day's diary entry he never talked about quitting instead he wrote about his admiration for Kenzo's talent he started writing about his feelings which was kind of unusual for him the next day he showed up early at the gym and wrote his own training plan without being told by his coach he seemed to have found a new source of motivation later that year Carlos competed in the 2018 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Doha Qatar and guess what one of his opponents was Mr. Twister himself Kenzo Shirai imagine going against your eyes of course lived up to his nickname the raining world champion on the operators from Japan Kenzo Shirai oh wow I don't know I'd be so dizzy I don't even see like half of what he just did it was so fast oh my gosh he twists so quickly how are you competing against that dude like how do you do you want to do that? oh my god you're twisting some assault deep breath still focus on the task I heard three and a half twists all I buy the ball twisting front so difficult a triple twist of finishing such a terrifying way to establish immense pressure they can only imagine what Carlos was feeling at the moment because he's the next one to perform oh my god I'm so happy for this youngster Carlo you glow from Philippines just 18 years of age it's first year as a senior no pressure small gymnast but he packs a punch yeah I don't have said that because Carlos only stands it for 11 while Kenzo is known for his twist our little shines with his power and elevation oh dude holy crap so fast you just take a look at that height dude is literally a living trampoline oh what are you doing? all right you got some game oh just told to get together there on the combination oh three and a half that was lovely tidying the air fast in the twist now the arms coming out to show control ball twisting front double twisting awareness we glance at the school board how much time has he got he's got this 10 second that's not going to be land so precise haha telling this young man is the school coming in 14.16 moves into the silver medal position Carlos effort apparently wasn't enough and his silver medal would then become bronze because Russia's art or the Laloian would beat Kenzo's core just running him in the process well look how jack the Russians I do my god that's a good job little juice of juice my friends lovely control deal oh my god there's lovely style in his name it two and a half twist double twist in front blocking the feet together for a well I'd be so freaking dizzy Carlos Goldsmith will finish wasn't perfect for sure but it still made him the first Filipino and Saudis Asian gymnast to have everyone a medal on a world stage he kept competing and training after the event until it was time for another shot the following year the 2019 world artistic gymnastics championships in Stuttgart, Germany Kenzo Shari didn't make it to the competition because of an alcohol engineering but the guy who beat them Arthur the Laloian was there but surprisingly he was a non-factor in the competition as he only finished four oh very lost his form slightly the guy who became a problem though was Israel's art and the golpeat powerful some blood oh the hearts of the hearts we've done from the one and a half twist she don't see many of those let it go hop in hop in hop in hop in hop in hop in he showcased a balance of power a technique which gave him his core that is high enough to warrant an early celebration from the crowd and his team because he was even higher than this core of last year's rating champion but you guys may have already heard of this saying never count a Filipino out now then what of this gentleman Carlos Hulo of the Philippines the bronze medalist on this apparatus taking his turn Carlos Hulo braces himself before flying the back the goal he needs to apply everything he has learned up to this point still just 19 years away to look at the flight oh he's gone he's a cool twisty double straight absolutely beautiful this is the ration oh he's duped by far kicking out and twisting so quickly he looks at the Philippines he's looking good so far he's looking good so far rising to the occasion so fast in the truth just a double twist that and so quickly and a triple twist the finish off we're good you're spinning how do you know where the hell you're at he's about to pass out and when the score gets revealed it's Hulo for 15.3 for Paul yeah he's coming to the lane damn are you already my history you're a good boy that's how we're doing right there he has like the perfect body type for that too yeah what a moment hey what a moment for the Philippines and just like that Harlow Hulo won the first ever gold medal for the Philippines artistic world's gymnastics oh it's crazy that's pretty awesome in honor to the winner the national anthem of Philippines yeah, China is it? oh look who's there oh and also man oh he's the boy guy too they all showed up how cool is that they're all so connected yeah yeah that's bad I love that shot over oh she passed away oh damn what a ride yeah imagine if Carlos really quit back then she was not on this what have happened in 58 this is why he's always very grateful to his coach so what did we learn from their stories for me it's their unrelenting guts and determination they did not win just because they are Filipinos they won because they put into work they went through loss pain and insurmountable obstacles they had the choice to make those things become their reason for their failure but instead they made it become their reason for their success and that's what makes them Filipino so what about you are you here to just listen to Filipino success stories or decide to become the story about to be that story that pumped me up dude that brought me back to like my competition day back in the day man damn dude I know you killed it too man I got to get back on or get the stem cells in my lower back so I can start competing again because my back gets screwed up right now no way I could do what I used to do right now and you can always make a comeback you should tell me on yeah for sure that was really cool man I was cool to see like how far all those people came you know started from like almost nothing and then just worked out the gold medals world records I mean they're they're nothing it's like really nothing that's a crazy part like they're out in the middle you know in the Philippines and there's like not a lot of food everybody else is kind of in the same struggle as you and to make it out of that yeah bro that's like a very very minuscule percentage of people that get out of that and hitting beginner's book of world records hitting all kinds of other world records and gold medals in the Olympics like that's impressive man I think um the the gymnast guy he was uh he was the most impressive I think because he went over to Japan and like had to learn their language it's like complete culture it's got to be rough and moved away from his parents too at a really young age which is like probably devastating for him yeah and Mr. Famoy yeah but um yeah that dude's impressive man yeah it was really cool to watch man good stuff guys uh casual chuck made this guys go give him a follow
