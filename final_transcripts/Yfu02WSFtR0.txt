 Future Friday. The Freshest. Hello! Okay, this has been so requested and I think it's going to just based on the thumbnail of the video, this is going to be a bunch of kids playing a 4. A 4. Small ukulele. A 4. A fritational instrument from Venezuela, that looks like a ukulele. Now which one came first? Who knows? Apple, my money, ukulele. I probably think a ukulele is a better version of a 4. A 4, that's right. 4. 4. 4. 4 playing right now. Let's give it a watch. This is one day by like 100 million kids. Keep going and send to us so it must be good. I love this cultural moment though. My god! What? It was a... It was such fun of him. And they're timing! I'm not bad. Now they're mum's. It's so great! If you look at an individual kid throughout the whole video, watch a video a thousand times. Definitely. I'm looking at him, the guy is the kid. I'm looking at the little girl struggling here the third day. Jeez, I'm in a hard time. This is great! What's the name of the film? They're all different. They're all different. They're all different. They do have a boy cover this song and he did it with a freaking great cover. That's not bad though. There was a so fun! How did you find comfort sitting like this? How the hell is that comfortable? He has funky ukulele. Yeah, she has colors and stuff. I know the boys because I had to do this for school, not to play the ukulele. But we had to learn this song from Mother's Day. Who is it? No, Alejandro Sans. We sang Amiga Mia. That's a really weird song to sing from Mother's Day. It was a math teacher, right there. She's very artistic. She chose mathematics. So, what do you mean? Amiga Mia. I had a hard crush on her daughter when I was younger. She's the one that led the choir thing. I thought she was so good looking when I was younger. She taught us to put us like this. We had to learn this Spanish song and sing it to our mothers on Mother's Day. I remember they lied to me. It was a piss-take. It was just so funny. I had to sing Juane. Yeah, I don't remember what Juane sang, but I had to sing a Juane song. Oh! That's so good! That's so good! I heard the same song. We're playing a piano. Yeah, yeah, little one. This is so great! My god! I like the menstrual screen. Like an open day. They're in tune, dude. They're awesome! They're kidding out of tempo-wise. And I just imagine from there on, that there's 100 kids who can pick up the ukulele and just... For the rest of their lives. Wow! Well done! Look at that. If you look at everything, I knew they were kidding. I love this little money. He's money, is it? This money. That's so good! That's so good! That's so good! I'm a big fan. Oh, great! Oh, my god! Oh, there's an... Wow! Oh, can we just have a freaking moment for that director? That teacher's doing the best work ever. Oh, I wish he went to school like this. This is great! They fact that none of them are rushing. And they're just all in tempo. Oh, keep in tempo. So well. Get back! The world! What's the bag now? Oh, the teacher. The teacher's the best! That's great! That's freaking awesome! That's great! That's great! And he just looks so good! Yeah. I'm very impressed. Me too! I'm freaking baffled with what you mean. I'm still very impressed on how he legs. Oh, no! No! No! Oh, second! I'm gonna be the two who ever line! Go on show tonight! I'm forever! Oh, there's a thorough wall! I'm gonna be the one who ever made me! ten назад i'm called all crazy imagine i have 상 Oh Yeah, they're getting getting go for it They got pipes on them Nice Today's a heart Feed continues How are we? Yay! We're done! We're done! Imagine having to teach them this, though, that's quite the task. Wait, it's also such a valuable lesson for the little ones. That is awesome! Not only because then this is like a little party trick they can pull out whenever. But it's also like you need a certain amount of focus and discipline throughout the whole song. Yes, and you're also inculcating the concept of unification. Unison, yeah. Unison work, and that's so difficult. And again, it props to the teachers involved in these activities. Because once they take the monotony out of school they bring something fresh and cool to the school life. Oh, school becomes the coolest thing ever. Yes, and then to the fact that they manage to make it a performance worthy situation, absolutely phenomenal. Oh, this is fun! I think that's what this type of activities, behaviors, and the teachers themselves need to be really well rewarded and encouraged publicly. Because teachers like those... I work the lifetime. Yeah, we all know of that one teacher that marked you in your childhood positively. And we also know of the ones that marked us negatively. Yes. So it's like the ones that marked someone else positively. Those are the ones that have to be priced publicly and reinforced because they literally can make a little one like that. Absolutely for in love with music. Yes, yes. Or you can make a little one learn that, oh, it was the coolest thing to work as a group. That's right, it's true. And learning teamwork. Or maybe I was actually the leader. And I want to be a composer like our teacher. Yes, yes, yes. So your teaching is such valuable lessons.
