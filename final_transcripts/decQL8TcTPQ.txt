 Future Friday. The freshest. So I asked you guys yesterday, like, what are some like carols and stuff like that? And by the way, you asked as well what I've Christmas like and what I've probably seen in my sweater. You've probably seen a video right now. And Bali is actually still to this day. They're a fucking announcement for one of the states. I'm gonna like this, a lot of you are the cities because one will be kids of course, we'll inform them in the little voice that you probably hear. That's her. Yeah. And the impression that they're probably some pictures of our videos. They always do the same fucking announcement every year, they're ever changing. Yeah, it's kind of fine. Yeah, but Aguinados or like Tag, or like in Spanish, there's like carols. You sent me this, which was a carol, but in Tagalog, that is very famous. So I thought we'll give it a watch. My behind a meag. Yeah. The thing is for kids, but I wanted to see it because you guys were like, this is low key fire. So let's give it a watch. Oh. That has such a Latin feel. Fuck you. Next level. Fuck you. Next level. And I'm in the back. I smoke a lot. I'm pretty big. Check. Check. Check. Check. Check. Check. Check. Check. Check. Check. Check. Check. Check. Check. Check. Check. There's this guy let him turn him around and award him something. You know? I can learn talk,lighs telling. Oh my god. Look, what actually happened to me. Have you read deep personal. That's cool. Of course, so like someone who's said, this THE oneAKIL mejores? like love me to see that you do the same in the Philippines how nice here have some money child now I'll go first I love that getting your feel yeah I love that oh, I love that I love that I love that I love that I love that I love that I love that actually, I love that the reason we're here I think it's conjugated as it is I think it's conjugated as it is so I love that This is funny though. It's fun, it's actually made for Tejas. You think it's quite good? Basko Lucky. Who's the voice? I am like the voice is great. And I presume it just fucking repeats yourself. It goes on forever, yeah? What's he saying? Namasko is a popular Tagalog song for Filipinos. Wait, give me a second. I'm gonna make it popular in Latin America. Ansan, he bang bang parito. I love that word. Okay, well yeah. That is fucking mangan. Now the funny thing, take it out. The funny thing is, you guys were like, well that's not it. That's not the only thing we're listening to here in the Philippines. Because I feel you guys that watch from the Philippines, sent it over. Pascona Sinta Co. Which is Gary Balensiano. Oh Gary Balensiano. Mr. Gary, let's go, yeah. Okay. Pascona Sinta Co. Oh wow. This is it. This is number 90. Oh that's fucking fun. I love that. Tell me you're listening to Disney. Of course, apparently we pronounce Disney wrong. It's not Disney, it like in Spanish is Disney. Disney. Yeah, Disney. No, it's not. Disney, yeah. That's it, it's in English. It's Disney. Apparently, yeah. It's Disney. In Spanish. Disney. In Spanish in Disney. But. No, in Spanish, in Disney. In English, in Disney. And in English, it's Disney. Because it's an A, isn't it? Disney. Yeah. How fucking good. That is so weird. Anyways, it's Disney. It's Disney. Disney. Fuck you know, so Gary. It's the Michael Bublé. Of the Philippines. I thought it was José Marichambo. José Marichambo is the Marichambo's and make Michael Bublé's songs. It's not like a cozy feels, you mean? Now José Maricham makes good music, but he makes more like a Christmas-y. Mm-hmm. Well, I guess he is the Michael Bublé or of the Philippines. I think so. Like the first, literally when we set up the Christmas tree, the first thing we played was obviously Venezuelan stuff. Cosmata. And then, cos of me, we play Michael Bublé. That's true. Turns out Michael Bublé is not even fucking British. It is correct, that's... It is Canadian. It's actually the first biggest betrayal. I don't even British myself, but you know what I mean. But like, it's weird. It's like, how the fuck? How are you not? Yeah. He must have been giving like... No, you know why you confused it? He has to be knighted. Sir... Sir Michael Bublé, that sounds correct. Okay. We have Sir Andy Murray from Vaxate. Yeah, he did win Wimbledon and all that shit. Michael Bublé is in the hearts of a British person. I think that's the most sold album every Christmas. Yeah, it is. It's in here. So I want that who has the most presuming the Philippines is from the same language channel. It's also from the channel, I think. Without that. Definitely, I think... You know what's funny, when I'm looking at the lyrics, I'm looking at it like I love his English. Not that I understand it, but... Oh yeah, I meant to be reading the English ones. And that's it? Well, it's a Christmas thing, it probably repeats itself. Yeah, it definitely will repeat itself. No, it's time... What a moment. Don't sound like a great moment for the family. Keanu actually covered this song, so I would recommend you go watch this. She covered it like a couple of years ago. We obviously are big fans of Keanu. Look. But then there's also another one that you guys were like asking. I don't know, I don't know what this video is. It's just astronix, Christmas and Filipins. And what you like to see, Baby Daren, Baby Juan Carlos, and Baby Lica, and Baby Darlín, because in the 2014 version of the Christmas ID thing that we always watch every year, they did a kids version because the kids' Philippines, I think, was... The voice, the voice. The voice Philippines kids edition Philippines. Well, it's kicking butt. Kids was kicking ass. So they did this... Let's have a look. I presume it's actually quite a good song. I'm sorry, you're... We got one, Carlos. We got one, Carlos. We got one, Carlos. To be fair, he actually hasn't changed that much. He's just now like six feet seven, yeah. Okay, moment though. The first girl was in real. I think we were slightly... I can't recognize. Yeah, I can't recognize. I think that was Lila and Lila. You know Lila when they were babies. Crazy girl, they sound so good. I like that. I like that. I want to wear that everywhere. I'm going to get it tattooed in my ass. So that my enemy's and those who love me will see him. I'm glad I'm here. I don't know why... Why would you see my house? I don't know any of that. Maybe my chest. Okay. I like that. Flash everybody. It's so funny, right? Because to me, that it sounds so cool. I'm pretty sure that someone speaks together. Wow, dude, you're stupid as fuck. That's really what they think anyway. Continue. I think that's... Like it was so small when she was in the voice. Like she was... If you look at Lika now, she looks more like... Do you ever go? I don't think so. Again, sometimes I'm so confident in this thing. I have absolutely no clue. Again, I'm always apprehensive when it comes to children's songs, especially for television stuff, because... They never so great. We were there. And it's kids. It's an effort. It's not a number one hit song. Maybe this was because of the whole idea that children... 32 million would say it was. Yeah, but obviously musically, you know, and lyrically, how deep can it go? It's a very children's song. It also hits a Christmas song, I feel like with this. But that beginning... Strong, right? Fuck, she's great. Oh, okay. Oh, actually, kind of like it. Can I just say, whatever I said before, I'd take it back. Yeah. I was shit. We were talking shit. I mean, will it be Christmas? This is freaking banging for you, you know. For kids, he's so real. Well, it's kind of like unfair to be honest. What the hell? Why did they sound so good? Also, it's like... Do we have any Christmas songs of us recorded? No. I mean, we probably have plenty, right? We have over a few albums. But... No, but I mean, Christmas ideas kind of thing. Like Christmas albums. You're all to find them though. I don't know where they would be. I'm not trying to find it like in the next hour, so I might like and put it in the video. So you see what those sound like. They're not fun. They're not very deep in my subconscious. But that's basically all I wanted to do. Just check out a bit of a fun video. Obviously, let us know if you like us to... Thank you, Angbaba. Let us know if you like us to review the songs fully. We are going to check out a few more Christmas ideas like properly. It's just this one. It wasn't requested. I just wanted to give it a check, because it was just for the little ones. It wasn't requested. It was super popular as well though. It shows how popular that show was in that year. So let us know what you guys would like us to check out next. And just to be able to film a video. I guess experimenting and learning new things about the Philippines when it comes to Christmas. So goodbye. Goodbye.
