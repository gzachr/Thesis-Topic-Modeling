 The So, good afternoon from a beautifully warm day in the Philippines. It's a little bit overcast but it's not been too bad. It's been raining this past couple of days. So it's the day of the big reveal, isn't it, babe? Are you excited to see our beautiful house? Mel is so happy. I can't tell you. She's saying, you will amaze guys if you're so our house. Yeah. That's the sh**tsh**ty house before, right? No. I don't think you can say sh**ty, baby. But there you go. It's a sh**t. Right, well, we've had a lot of comments calling it an s-hole. It's a slum area. Which it is a slum area? Yes. It is a slum area. My baby asked me a question earlier on saying, would no foreigners live here? And it's like, well, yeah, if the house was like this, the foreigner would live in it. I mean, it wouldn't be too happy about the areas because let's be honest, if we could afford to live somewhere really nice, would be somewhere really nice. We don't have much choice. So if we've got a living here, we want it comfortable, don't we? Yeah. Are you comfortable now? I'm very comfortable now. Are you really? Yes. I'm very happy. Let's be in that. Let's help them. No, no. Make them squirg. I'm very excited. Make them squirg. Come on, let's show you what the house looks like now. It's a house. Yeah, it's comfortable, isn't it, baby? And these are two of my neighbours. She always hides when I bring the camera. And I keep saying, if you're so beautiful, why do you hide? This is my thews babysitter. And this is what we've got. This is what is good about living here. Now you can see the outside, we've done it. Sorry, I never finished that up. We've got all family rounds. And the old tape Matthew, they're all knocking on the door. Can we have Matthew? Can we have Matthew? So you can see the change at the front. We've painted all the front. Now, for a very good friend of ours, I want to try and explain, which, when you send a message to somebody, there's always some misunderstanding or whatever. Hi Bill. Hi Bill. Thank you very much. And then we're talking about this. Yeah. Right, now our very good friend wanted us to get rid of this. Now believe me, if I could... It's not forever's day, but it's the only... It's not forever. Forever. It's only just for now. Just for now, huh? Right. So... This is a health aspect. Thank you for considering both sides. Thank you Bill for your concern, yeah. Our friend Bill is being a really good friend for quite a long time. His concern has been unbelievable and we're really appreciating that I'm not sure whether we actually got that over to Bill or not. But he sent me a message and said, look, he's worked in health and safety and this that and the other for years, which I've done a bit myself. And this is a total health hazard. And we really, really wish we could get rid of it. But we've got a problem because the person that owns them will make a big stink if we try to force... It pursues him and force him to get rid of it now. So it's going to be a lengthy process of trying to get him to move them, right? So that's the reason. If I push Mal to do it, they know who's pushing Mal because the no Mal and the no Mal wouldn't normally do it. So they'll know it's me and that's going to cause trouble for me. And yeah. So that's why we can't do it Bill. I'd love to be able to carry all your suggestions out. But we've had a problem, we've had lots of problems while we've been upgrading the house, aren't we? From this particular person, right? He's caused a lot of trouble. But should we let stay here a long time? I know, we don't want it to. Once it's gone, we can paint it and make this side look a bit better. So the big reveal, right? So from Islam to a very, very comfortable abode. Are you ready? Yes. Are you ready for the house? No, close my eyes. I'm sorry. Do you want to see the big reveal? They think they think they think they're big. Do you want to see the new house? Now, but how's it going? Be positive. Yeah. How long? So there you go. This is it. This is the new house. It looks house now. Yeah. And you can see, you can remember from many months ago when I was building my desk top. It's all done. It's all finished. Edward was keeping me, computer desk, a mitchet. He's had it for months on the email. I'm ready for us getting the computer. Did you tell guys about this house? Did you tell guys? I don't know. Do we tell the guys? What do you think? Yeah, about this house. What do you think? It's lunar, right? Yeah. You can see, if you go through the old videos, there's about five videos, guys. All the new viewers that don't have seen the before enough, you have to go through our last five videos. When you edit this video, just put the picture of the old house before I mean. We haven't got a picture of the old house, are we? I have. You have. All right. So there might be a picture in there if I can sort it out. So you remember, I mean you have... No, no, no, no. There's been so much done. I've put a smoke alarm up there as you can see. There's one, two, three, four. Four new sockets in because all the wires were running along the roof coming down the walls as you can remember. Shall we only compute that also? Well, I don't think the interest in seeing you compute the baby, but there you go. What's it going to say? They're all travel sockets. It's all been rewired, all been painted. Now these is what we get into the upstairs with if we need to go upstairs. Now the upstairs is only for storage. We sleep on here at the minute. We'd like a sofa bed, but that will come a little bit later on. We're quite happy sleeping on there. I love sleeping on there. It's comfortable for me and we're back fine. When I slept, sorry. When I slept on that mattress at the other house, my back every morning used to kill. Now hopefully we're going to get a little dining table for there to eat on there. I'm trying to think the things I won't forget. It's fun to know why. Oh yeah, that's Mel's picture. It wasn't her picture. It was my picture actually. But the one that I've got there is the one we wanted. When we got to the checkout, there's a crack in the frame. So I take it back and that was a rush job. But I think it fits okay. So that smells a little telephoned when we're at the other house so you could watch it on our own, which we have no use for now. So I've sold me push by with what else are we sold? We've sold a few things, aren't we? So we can get this dining table like I said, it's not... Yes, we need a dining table. You know why? Why? Because you're covering the sound up. You're using your computer table when you eat. Well, I'm eating, yeah. So apart from little bits of decorations and stuff and making it a little bit, you know, more homely over time, it's mainly all finished now. Especially on Christmas, right? Yeah. I promised her a Christmas tree and some decorations, some Christmas lights. So she's looking forward to it. Some of my family relatives, they are my family's parents. Well, it's all beautiful and I'm with them. Yeah. So I don't want anybody commenting and messages about the headline because it's true and Mal agreed with it and she's not offended by it and knows her family. So if they're not, then nobody else should be because I'm trying to stay off, you know, head off comments like, you know, will her family be offended by your headline? Is that, you know, they know they're not the fine with it because it's the truth. It is a slum area. So, you know, don't forget guys, now we've finished the house. It's rent free. So this house now is costing us nothing. So would you live here even where it is free of charge? I mean, I'm quite happy for you to comment on that, you know, say no, we still wouldn't whatever. Yeah, that's fine. So let's go into the kitchen. Yeah. So this is the kitchen area. You can remember how it used to be. Now, this curtain is going to be replaced with the same as that. It's going to match. So it's grey, whitey, grey, so it'll match. We've got the extract to find out there. Thanks to our friend Bill. And we really need to say that this wouldn't have been anywhere, anywhere near finished. If it hadn't been for the help of Bill. Thank you, Bill, for being incredible kindness to us. Very, very much Bill. We'll never forget it. We'll, you know, it's been unbelievable. Thanks very, very much. So that's it guys. All my new subscribers and new viewers, if you want to go back through the last five videos, you'll see the start of the house and how bad it was. Everybody was advising us to move out. All those who advised us to move out, I'd like to hear from you now. We've got a dehumidifier. That was Bill's suggestion. Again, thanks Bill. It needs switching on, of course. So, me, me computer is absolutely amazing. It's a gaming editing beast. It's brilliant. Now, I would have shown you, but I think a lot of people are big bored for that. They don't want to see the computer. But I'm really happy with that. It's working absolutely 100% brilliant. So that's our new home guys. Yes. I just want to say thank you for all the congratulations to us. Yeah, yeah. Thanks for all your kind comments on the last video. Yeah, we'll finally find out. She did it very craftily, going to get the scan on her own. I didn't go with her. She said to me, congratulations. I said, what are you on about? She says, congratulations. It's a girl. Of course, because I'm thinking, well, she couldn't have gone her own without me, but she did. Is it your plan? Is it your plan? I would have found out now. She thought it would surprise me and it would be good, but I wanted a girl. I'm planning this for Grace Room, but I'm very excited about what I did. So, again, we want to thank you for all the kind comments you've sent. All our long-term subscribers, you know who you are because it's great to hear from you every time you leave a comment. And most of all, we want to thank our patrons. Again, with our patrons, I don't know what we do. You've been so kind, our long-term patrons, you brilliant. Thanks so much for all your support. So, until the next video, which might be what? So, the next video, guys, is the one that I need to please for the day. Yeah. So, basically, I've had to go back on it again. I was on it, but the stress of being here sent me off it. It's effective, right? No one that you make for you, right? It's very effective. The juicing that I'm on, the regime that I'm on, one, and I'm talking from a personal perspective. Now, I'm not giving advice, medical or otherwise. I'm only telling you what I do. So, I'm not advising you, and I'm not asking for advice. What I do works for me. And not only does it drop my weight like really quickly within two to three weeks. It also brings my blood pressure down to normal. Now, that's, again, you've got to be careful with this blood pressure thing. I'm not suggesting people come on it and, you know, try it and stop taking the blood pressure tablets and this, that and the other. I'm simply telling you what works for me. So, that's going to be the next video. So, until then, guys. You're ready for the things, right? What? Ready for the taste of the one that I make. Be ready for the taste. It's not the taste, right? No, or we'll tell them not on the video, babe. Otherwise, we've got no video to make. Right, so over to you, mum. Please hit the like button and please subscribe and share our videos. So, until the next video, guys, bye.
