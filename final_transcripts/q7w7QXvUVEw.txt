 feature Friday. The Freshest. Filipe in a girl by Billy Crawford and James Reed with Marcus Davis. Super requested bro. So the request. First time. First time we've checked out um. Oh hello. Good morning. So you know it's earlier. We just we haven't checked out Marcus Davis before. We have checked out Billy Crawford before and James Reed so let's give you a go. Let's have a look. Oh sorry. Start from the beginning bro. Filipe in a girl. Filipe in a girl. I'm imagining it's about a Filipe in a girl. Oh you think so? You got my heart and you added the first baby head. Oh. What's that? Oh nice. Oh I like his hair cut. Starlish. Oh she's right. Pretty motor sound. Oh hello. That is good. Wow we so old school. Sounded like it. It's like it is. It's really usher 2000. I feel like Tepa is going to bust in it. Yeah literally. What a baby. Also these girls are gorgeous though. I feel like genuinely being a girl. Hence why they've chosen those models. I don't like this song so much. I don't know. I can't recognize any of them. I just got to say it's really nice freaking high class bar style lifestyle. I really like that in the music video. Plus the dresses are lush. The song is so nice though as well. Love that. Just go to Philippine Girl models. I think that is her. It is. You might be looking at it in the credits. Bro maybe they're actual. Yeah and I've been loose today. I've got to see her. And Amber Davis. Colleen. Yeah so I think that's why they're doing so. Oh I see. Philippine Girl because they all have a Filipino girlfriend. What a cool video. No I understand the theme behind her. I like it. It's like high style high class. Love it. It's really already 2000 sounds. Yeah man. Mixed a little bit with like beat production of today. But I like it. That heavy bass. I thought I would still consider it. It is like 2006. Longer points. I literally feel like T-Pane would be another part of the project. Or like yeah Asha could bust in here. Do some moves. Literally it's so old school and I'm so into it. I wonder what made him choose that type of sound. Oh maybe because they just shine at that. Obviously also because in Philippine this is a sound that is so in. So? Yeah definitely. Let's go on. People love old school R&B. Like so much. Yeah but I think I thought it was more like the old old school R&B. Like the 90s. Yeah 80s 90s and. Oh I see. Yeah but let's go. This is good though. I'm the time with you. And I've got you's what you do. Girl yeah. There ain't nothing in this world. Nothing in this world. Oh you're loving the girls. Oh what a nice video. There ain't nothing in this world. Nothing in this world. It ain't that bad. It ain't that bad. Yeah it's nice. What a freaking vibe. What a freaking vibe. I don't like Chris Brown just tempted to see the top of the song. I'm smiling. I freaking love James dude. Thanks. Nice nice. I'm wider and more like Michael E. I love James dude. Okay,はい. I'm sure this was like an anthem when he came out. He has to be. And I'm facing him. He's a bassist, he ever used to help. What a cool vibe! The most of it is so fun to film. I thought I'd see what I can decide it night. It does, isn't it? I like this. And the scene of you, all of the three eyes. I love the lens flare. Thank you so much for watching Philippine and girl. From one of these videos, from your favorite artist. Wow, subscribe. Literally have the whole legion. It's a Viva Records. Yeah, Viva Records. I am telling you, bro. This is hat. So I imagine that's a label that's really cool. Yes. When did this come out? 2019. Oh, okay, okay. Man, I'm pretty sure they must have played everywhere. And this probably became like the anthem of the era. How's over trendy sound. It does, and it's so catchy. I was singing along the first time around. You know, nothing in the world. It's just so old, old, school that feels. It does. It's so nice. I like that type of army. I think maybe because we grew up with that sound. I think it just hits familiar for me, you know? Well, let us know what you thought about it. And what was kind of the vibe when this first came out. And let us know what else we should check out next. Yeah, cool.
