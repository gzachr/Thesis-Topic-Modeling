 So guys welcome back to another street food video by pair of souls. We're here in wonderful Baha'u Philippines. We're at Coastal Town of Gindleman. The population of about 35,000 people here. It's almost five o'clock. So that's a good thing. It means there's a lot of street food here. Everyone's going to be coming to get a snack before heading home. I just found a good spot here. We're going to see what they've got. I've got a hundred pesos in my pocket. That's what I have to spend around two dollars and fifty cents Canadian. So yeah, we're going to see what they got guys. Base. Okay, so this one's a vinegar. That's a spicy one? No, that's a regular. That's a spicy. Spicy, this is sauce. That's a sauce. Okay, I'll have that spicy, please. Spicy. No sauce? No sauce. No. Only vinegar. Just a bit of vinegar. Yeah. I got to watch my stomach. Awesome. Thank you so much. All right. So here we go. I got this is a famous street food in the Philippines called Quick, Quick. It's basically a quail egg and they put like this batter on it and I think it's like a food coloring to make it turn orange. But that was great. So I'm going to try that and then it's also a tempura. I got on top here. He's cooking it right now. I'll show you guys. This is a tempura. That's a tempura and that was the quick way. Yes. This is the is a. Yes, yes, very good. That one. Very nice. So there you go. As you see, it's attached to his motorbike. So he's mobile with this. He can go wherever he wants. Here it's pretty good. He's got his umbrella. It's so hot. He's got his umbrella. He can go anywhere. If it's busy in a certain area, he can move his stall. So I'm going to go try to find a place to sit so I can try this. I'll try to find a place here up there. Nice. Perfect. All right. Hey, what's that? All right. I'm going to sit up here. Very nice spot. I'm going to sit right here. I got my tempura and quail egg. All right. I've got my, that's a tempura. Unlike you saw him do. He put like a vinegar on it. And also like, it looks like chopped onion. Very good guys. Nice and spicy. That's the quick, quick. So that's a pretty much like a miniature hard-boiled eggs. If you've seen quail eggs, we have those back home. Here they're very popular. And like I said, they're deep fried with this batter. That was great. I was about 25 pesos. Like I said, I have 100 pesos to spend. So I was about one, one fourth of my budget so far. We'll see you guys at the next spot. All right, guys. We're at spot number two. I saw this guy before a same little thing. His is not a touchable motorcycle. His is a touchable bike. He's got a bunch of stuff here. Okay, long. Jai? Jai. Okay. I got to see Chris, bro. Nice to meet you. What's on the, is this chicken or pork chicken? Okay. All right, so a little different than the other place. You guys remember the other chicken street food I did? They had like kind of like a little restaurant setup. His is a mobile. So he's ready to go wherever he wants. He's got a whole bunch of different sauces here. You can choose anyone. Super cool. Dip away. No double dipping. There you go. Okay, I will get one of the chicken please. Take, take, take, be like that. 20. Okay. So this one also guys. This one's 20 pesos. There we go. There we go, bro. All right. So he's asking me what kind of sauce I want. Which one's the best one? The hot sauce. The hot sauce? Sure. I'll try the hot sauce. Nice, bro. All right. I'm going to enjoy. Thank you very much. I'm going to have a sit here. Behind the guy you see they're cooking in the back here. It's pretty cool. Again, I'm not sure if they're here all day these guys, but usually the busy times are in the late afternoon when people are finishing work. So I think it's like 4 p.m. So it's going to get busy here soon. All right, it's very hard to film in the market guys because of all the music that's playing. So I don't want to get a copyright strike. So I have to have to get out of there quickly. I'm going to walk around here, see what they've got. Need something to drink. Actually, if I could find something to drink, I would be perfect. So we're going to do that. So bro, what's your name? My name is Abbi. Abbi, my name is Chris. Yes, nice to meet you. Yes, I love these vehicles here. Yes, yes, yes, original. Yeah, I'm looking for something to drink. I'm so thirsty. I don't know if they have maybe a restaurant there. They have also there? Okay, I'll check. Nice to get in, Bobby. Take care. We're about to bake shop to get something to drink, but I'd like to find maybe something a little different. So I think here they got like Coca-Cola, stuff like that. Looking for something a bit more you know traditional. See what we got. The bros. Everyone's in a good mood. It's great. It's never boring. Everyone wants to see high. I got to walk on the side of the road, not in the middle of the road. Just because I'm filming does not give me the right to obstruct the roads. Do you want one of those? I can buy you one of those. No? No money, but I can buy you one of those if you want. No? No, no, no, I'm asking do you want one of those? Okay, so here we are. We've got another spot here. That was after my chicken. I don't know what these are, but I'm going to try it out. A little bowl. A little bowl. A little bowl. Okay, so that's like it's like a potato. And take me along for a piece. Ten pesos. Okay, for a stick. Okay, so it's ten pesos per stick. I'm going to buy one for the lady here. She's asking me for money instead of giving money because you don't know if they're going to use it for alcohol or whatever. So I'm going to buy them something and eat if she still wants it. It's okay. All right, so we're going to buy her a cassava ball. She has a baby. We'll get her some food, guys. No bag for me to eat. Okay. I know bag. It's okay. I will unbox it. Okay. I'm trying to not use as much bags as possible. Oh, okay. Okay, welcome. All right, I got my cassava ball here. We're going to try this. Thank you. Sava balls. I'm guessing it's coconut. What is it? Coconut around or coconut? Okay, so it's cassava balls with coconuts. Looks like it's dipped in coconut. These were at ten pesos each. I got two. One for the lady, one for me. Not bad. Good. Starchy. Sweet because of the coconut. Not bad. Looks like she's doing something else here. Looks like a sort of pancake with chocolate syrup. That's the way to, I'm way too full for them. I'm going to have proms finishing this up. Oh, man. So I met sushi five pesos. I need to spend 35. All right, well, I told you guys at first I had a hundred pesos to spend on street food. So I didn't think that was fair to start going to buy a beer or something to drink. So, hello, guys. They can't wait for me to go buy some food. So I have to spend it on food. I think I have 45 pesos left. So that's why I'm going to try to spend here. It looks like they have a little different variety and have some nice, looks like Manse juice, Kalamanse juice. Nice, nice selection here. Nice sauce. Well, we have to get names. We always have to get names. So in the saya, I ask you, when are you going to eat? I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. Indai. No, but you're real name. My real name, Glenda. Glenda, okay. Okay. I'll see Chris. Glenda. It's a meaty. Nice. Nimpah. Okay. Nice to meet you. I'll see Chris. I did not say it. Then we got some customers. I will first try the Kalamanse juice. This is 10 pesos. So thirsty. Very nice. Kalamanse is at like a miniature line. They're all over the Philippines. People have the trees in their backyards. Frontyards. It's great. It's sweetened a little. And they've got ice, of course. So a nice cold drink. All right, I'm going to put that down. I have a gut. This here. So this is called e-cell. So this is that chicken intestine, but it's not just done after that. They also bread it and deep fry it. And you have your choice of sauce over here. You can choose which one. Very good. I think I'm just going to pour it in my cup. I think that's the easiest way. So that's what I'm going to do here. Try not to make a mess. I'll put it over here. Pour my sauce in there. I'll try this one. What it is. Just a little. Don't want those added calories, right guys? Street food. Nice. Yeah, it's the e-cell. So good. Have you if you check out any of our other street food videos? Now you see me eating this one, but it's not breaded. It's just the intestine on the barbecue grill with a sauce. It's one of my favorite Filipino barbecue's here. So good. Awesome. I'm sorry. I still have five pesos left. I couldn't spend that last five. That was my 100-paiso. Street food here in Gendelman, in Baha'u, in the Philippines. Hope you guys love the video. Take care, guys. Peace.
