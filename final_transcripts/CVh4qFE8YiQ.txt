 Mabuhai. Hello everybody. Today begins our nine-day journey around the mainland. We're kind of low on plans because we wanted it that way. We wanted to explore. Although today we do have a plan. We're going to the Malampati cold springs because well it's a destination that we everybody says we must go to and it's just on the other side about an hour and a half motorbike right away. We haven't been able to find anybody online or asking on Facebook and the tour groups and stuff where we can rent a motorcycle and cataclyne. So that part we're still got to figure out when we get there. I'm sure we'll figure it out. It'll be fine. There's no worry. No, nothing ever messes up. That's what adventures all about though. Just figuring it out as you go. So we're just walking over here to the port because it's two minutes from our house. Jumping on the boat and here we go. Off to Malampati. It is. Oh my gosh. It's really hot, beautiful day. So the cold springs are going to feel fantastic. Normally it's completely under here. Yeah it's busy as heck now. But the kitchen is doing good. First kitchen. Hello! We're heading to the mainland for nine days. We're just going to ride a motorcycle around. Nice and busy again. Yeah, happy to be here. That's the best. Okay guys. See you later. Okay, local. Here we go. We're locals. There we go. That was so quick. It was five seconds to show and pay 50 pesos for your ticket. And then you got to fill in your ticket. There's some information so they have everything. That's it. And then jump on a boat and head over. A lot better than the tourist line. That's for sure. They pay a lot more. They got to have a QR code. A whole bunch of business. Get the Mac Mac. Okay. Right. One number. One number. Twenty two. Okay. Okay. Cataclan. Okay. Cataclan. Sure was with the motorbike pencils are. I think we got to go probably just out to this port area. And then start asking around. Easy as what. All right. Well, we decided we wanted to make sure they're reputable place. So we were renting the bike. And so we just asked the police here. And they're like, yeah, let me talk to people around here. They found us somebody that said, yeah, no problem. And they'll bring it to us. So we get to sit here with the police and look like we're arrested. Yeah, we're sitting. We're sitting behind the police desk. Right now. Right now. We've been like detained. But no. And in fact, they're helping us make sure we get a motorbike. So everything is great. So far. Yeah. We're going to have to walk around town trying to find somebody. It's going to go up any mountain. It's easy. Yes. Okay. Quick update. No go on the motorbike. That bike showed up. And the guy said, yeah, I want 4,000 pesos per night. So $80 per day for a motorbike. And you got to keep in mind that the cost here for to buy a motorcycle. Not that one, but any of the other ones here. It's going to be used. $25,000 pesos. So we'd be able to buy that used one and a half times for the same amount. They want to rent it for nine days. But brand new about 55 to 70,000. So yeah, we would almost bought a brand new one in nine days. So we're looking still, messaging everybody we know. And also they are being me. We're staying out to see maybe down their way. And then we get to the cab there. But things aren't going so well, but that's part of travel. And we're just going to figure it out one way or another. Somehow, some way we always do. Yeah. All right. All right. So let's get away from this port. This is a temporary port. Not temporary, but it's only used a few months of the year. And we're going to go near the main one. That's about 15 minutes away from here. And then we'll go from there and see what we can find around that area. All right. We found a few places that tell motorbikes all in this area. So we'll see if one wants to rent. So far, one said no. But maybe this guy. It's too bad we live on the island because you could just buy a motorbike for what everybody wants us to rent. The motorbike for. But not too easy if you live on Boracay. You have to have special permission and a special permit that they don't really give out. Yeah. So that's where we're at. Hi guys. Everyone's really friendly. Everybody's saying hello, but unfortunately everybody's like, no, we don't know anybody. No, maybe go check out the other jetty port. That's about all we're getting so far. She's crying. Oh, she found a chicken. She found a chicken. So we're chicken. What? Oh yeah. You see it. It's yours. I'm your ski person. I'm your ski person. All right. Here we are. Welcome to Cataclan right there. Technically we weren't exactly in Cataclan. That's right. Oh! Hello guys. All right. Keep moving. We even have a pink one, but no rentals. Only two by. Buddy told us, yeah, go down to the jetty port a little bit further down. You said you'll find somebody. Just keep asking everybody. There's so many motorbikes. Okay. Somebody's got a red one. Right? Right? For a reasonable price. Like, I will pay 5,000, which is high. That's usually what you'll pay on the island per month. So nine days here on the mainland? Come on. We got to make this work. It's been a couple hours. We know a lot yet. I'm standing, dying, but I know a lot. Main NSL, follow howl. So why not? We have a bunch of people down there that we told them what we're doing. And we're looking for a bike. And we need to be right. Okay. Let me see what I can find. And so you're just going to run around and look around for us. So we'll see. I'll go to the back. Bye guys. Bye. Salamad. Okay. All right. We got somebody here. We made a deal with it. So we're very excited. We can finally get going. It's going to take us to go see it. And we're good to go. He only has one helmet though. So, nine air and 50 pesos. New helmet. We'll own it. So we'll keep it. And yeah, we'll have it at least. But one day we'll get another one. Only need to buy one right. And the helmet silver. So that's nice. So I'm going to get too hot. Yeah. It's really pretty around here, isn't it? Oh, come on over. There we go. And the good thing, my friend. You're worried about damage. But we have a camera. So we'll film now before and after. We'll take a picture. Oh, cool tank. Yes, it is. We'll bring it back full. It's a special premium. Okay. Yeah, you take care of your bike nicely. Yeah. Take the start there, sir. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Okay, Bob. Unfortunately, we don't know what it is, but either Halo, Halo or Heatstroke. Unfortunately, she's not doing good. And we've only been driving for eight minutes, maybe five minutes, five minutes. So now we're not sure what's going to happen. We'll see if she gets better in a little bit. And because we have an hour of bike ride. And we'll go from there. Unforeseen things happen in travel. But she's not feeling well at all. We have some cute goats. Yes, you. And some cows. Well, here's the update. This is a nice spring fed resort. Sort of thing, but without a hotel room or anything. We asked, so what happened is she just can't handle it. She's like, no way. I can't. I can't. I need, I need like to go lay down somewhere. So we started flagging down the e-tricks. Well, we got the guy who ran to just the bike who was also an e-trick driver. We're not e-tricks. Sorry, regular trick. We got him coming back and he was carrying a passenger. And he's like, what's going on? And we told him. And he said, OK, and I said, well, listen. And there was this place called Turban Cove Resort that was nearby. Where we could rent a room. We're just going to have to cancel our plans and eat the money that we've paid for tonight's stay at the other place. And get somewhere else. And. All right. Well. I can't remember where we left off, but that's OK. So this is the place here where it's all fresh water springs brought in. Oh, I can see this. They got all the cow of baths here. Whole stacks of them. Oh, my goodness. Wow. There's so many. Look how pretty this is. Hello. She's laying down right now, by the way. Hopefully, hopefully she'll start filling better because we got to figure out where we're going to stay tonight and all that good stuff and how far she can make it. She doesn't seem to make it more than five minutes in any vehicle. So, yeah, they got so many of these cow of baths. Wow. That's a lot of people that can fit in one area. It's a very quaint place. Very relaxing. And they're preparing, like, as if a lot of people are coming. So, interesting. Right now we're the only people here. All very jungle. Cool. Let's get fire going. They're dead. Okay. All right. We're here. It's 1750 pesos. And this is the room. So, you got your CR. And you got your room. This is more for if you're about to catch a flight. Yeah. Not if you're dying. Yes. Yeah. This is where people catch planes. You can hear the planes flying over and eat because it's right across from the airport. But hey. Well, hey. Look at that. It's right on the beach. You can get your final beach dip. Yeah. And our home somewhere over there. And we have a big neck. I've been necked off. You are one kilometer from home. How do you feel about that? And we paid 1700. Yeah, plus. Plus renting the motorbike for the day. Plus, plus the 360 pesos. Our trip is going so well so far. We can tell we're pro travelers. Like if you need any advice, we clearly got everything figured out. But that's what. Like everything. All that matters is that you're okay. I'm doing good. I'm okay. For anybody who is worried or was worried that throughout the video, I'm doing okay. Okay, I'm doing okay so far. I'm better now. Definitely. And since I ate the same Halo Halo. I have a feeling or Halo Halo I should say. I've been feeling you at heatstroke. Yeah, because I was like, I even though I finished yours. So I had mine plus a little bit of yours. I'm saying I'm just saying. But heatstroke mixed with a bunch of milk products and stuff. Yeah, that was the only thing I ate as well. And it's very deserted. So, you know, not a good combo. I'm zero out of, well actually two out of ten wouldn't recommend. But when you throw a Halo Halo, it's purple. So, you're welcome for that imagery. Wow. So kind. So, they don't have a lot of shade right now. So we're just sitting over here. Probably a little back to get the stuff ready. And there's the motorbike. Okay. And of course, super close to the airport. Right there. That's our room. That's the blade. They know me do well. What that is. That's kind of expensive. All right, where did the beef broccoli? As you can see. Mainly beef. Yeah, there's just broccoli there. There's no more broccoli. Oh, there's no one there. So, a little shy on the broccoli. But look at the beef. You got a lot of beef. Where's the beef? In your mouth soon. Soon, very soon. No rice with it or anything. I thought maybe rice, but would you get again? Alfredo and shrimp. Carbonara and something. Something. Okay. It's crazy. How many tractor trailers are there? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. It's crazy. How many tractor trailers come out of these ships? And these ships carry a ton of people. You can get like a state room in them. And you can travel distances like 24 hours long. Somewhat like a cruise ship. But even after that, then all of these tractor trailers come rolling out of them. And it seems to be never ending. Incredible how much they can stick in them. Well, she couldn't last very long. And she had to go back up to the room. She's really dehydrated. You should imagine throwing up a lot. She'll be fine by tomorrow, but no one would ever ever guess that in our day one of the tour of Acklin that we would still be one kilometer from our house. I might be exaggerating. It might be 1.5 kilometers. I don't know. But really beautiful here. The sunset is gorgeous. It's just a little disappointing, but it is what it is. But tomorrow we'll head down. We're going to skip over where we're going to stop the first time. And just keep on heading down. And let's see if the adventure takes us tomorrow. Hopefully much further. I've seen a lot of change. Been through a lot of pain. Some things are not the same. As they were a year ago. But I'll be okay. I move on each and every day. The past is where it stays. Way back a year ago. I've changed for the better this time. I thought I...
