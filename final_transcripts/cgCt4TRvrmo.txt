Just over there that is one of the most dangerous
hoods in the Philippines!
It's a place called Tondo!
A huge contrast to where we stand there right
now.
And this man behind me, fought against those
same struggles and the same dangers that unfortunately
still plagues many of the people of modern
day Tondo.
This man of course is José Rizal!
So even the locals will warn you not to go
to tondo apparently it's one of those places
where people get pickpocketed people get robbed
heck people even get stopped over there but
how bad can it really be I've been to San
Francisco before a real Zombieland and I managed
to survive it so I think we should head on
over there and find out what this place is
really like Tara or not let's go uh
[Music] 300.
um
150 oh no no um finish at 50 Cent 200.
200 it's good

stuck took be there soon so let's see why

on top of it as well put my camera on and
uh yeah we've got about 35 people watching
me eat this thing pretty normal [Music] you
like this one the same as well yeah it's very
good
I promise you I'm not even lying about this
I literally woke up about a few hours ago
and I was about four o'clock in the evening
and I literally had nothing so this is actually
my breakfast [Music] I'm from London you know
um

been upgraded
not friendly [Laughter] okay I'm not messing
with no dogs but I had no good luck with dogs
in Sri Lanka and India and Philippines I'm
messing with no dogs but cats cats over
so obviously as you see I think this is one
of those places where their reputation is
actually much worse than the reality I think
back in the 1980s this place was much worse
rifle poverty rifle criminal activity with
people selling Shabu which is a drug that
was famous in the Philippines but honestly
so far I've been pretty good I had a few odd
looks here and there but I think it's because
you know I'm a foreigner I got camera in my
hand and I'm just pointing in everyone's faces
rather than any real malicious intent but
anyway let's keep going and let's see how
we get on
[Music]
what's up
okay okay
I have no idea what's going on I'm guessing
some sort of betting game
a bunch of 20s over there
oh so we literally [Music] this is insane
this is
so if you get hungry you eat yeah
who's winning who's winning numbers
what's this one what's this one so you play
with this one but not this one foreign
[Music]
[Music]
so I 
saw this game about a year ago and I honestly
have no idea I've never seen it before it's
like uh it's kind of like air hockey but only
with four holes rather than six let's see
this Champion getting it in whoa champion

we started good then camera shot all of a
sudden as I was saying to you I was nervous
for no reason man obviously I'm at a foreign

feel inside rather than what the reality actually
shows up but look at this street this street

as we thought it's uh the reputation is horrible
for Thunder honestly if you just type tondo
I think like the third or fourth result straight
away they'll be people telling me or like
chip advisor on those uh Korra forums literally
don't go tongdo it's one of those places that
you shouldn't go there as a foreigner even
at the local you shouldn't be going there
but as I showed you so far to be honest with
you I haven't seen anyone be negative towards
me maybe even um even the dangerous looking
people they've been pretty nice and hospitable
to me as well and everyone gave me free food
so as fun as that tour was back in Toronto
with those kids I think we have to get out
there very very quickly believe me I'm not
trying to end up with Nordstrom whatsoever
so I'm now taking a tuk-tuk all the way to
an area called Panda Garden Apparently that
is the real dangerous area so let's go over
there and let's see what we find okay kuya
okay okay okay good let's go sorry now
okay there you go okay it was actually oh
so it's actually much further than we both
thought I think there was a little bit of
a miscommunication so he wanted 300 or 250
actually but I ended up just giving them 500.
so let's go over there so apparently this
place is the real piece of work this is apparently
much worse at tondo uh I mean if the owl says
anything to go by I think we might be on the
right track quite literally we've got train
tracks over here oh look at this [Music] oh
look at that you got people literally all
over the train tracks over there I think is
it okay to cross no problem wow okay look
at this we've got people just playing basketball

than uh coming here to the Philippines man
honestly I've been away for about six months
not vlogging and this is exactly why I needed
man so I'm really glad I came here ah there
you go if you still don't think this place
is safe we've got the police saving us over
here hello oh these are coming up
[Laughter] oh gosh traffic Filipino traffic
okay
okay we're not no please yeah all right guys
I 
guess the video is not over that uh toxic
Java kicked me out uh he didn't want to go
binondo in the end for whatever reason I don't
know if the price was too little for him or
maybe just signed out for the day but he told
us to go ahead and get another Tuk Tuk so
let's see if you can find another one over
there I can see one over there but I don't
know what he's selling or maybe he is just
waiting for a customer [Music] hello kuya
you can take me to bonando
McConnell
200 1 Chinatown yeah been on the church
250 okay let's do it I don't want to stand
here negotiating for 50 pesos for literally
the whole day
oh I guess uh I guess I'll be driving the
tuk-tuk myself
where did he go where did he go
are you come back yeah binondo Church
okay
[Music]
what a crazy day that was today huh so obviously
we started out who is our park we want to
talk though and then we ended up all the way
it's like I've done and if he was to ask me
how would I rate the day generally I would
say a pretty positive one every single person
I met in there made me feel welcome made me
feel safe gave me free food free drinks and
told me uh just you go wherever I want to
do whatever I want but if he was asking yourself
if you should be coming here yourself honestly
kind of depends on you if you are a good traveler
if you don't mind all the noise the pollution
and the crazy crazy kids I would say you should
go over there an officer and I'll be back
so I hope you enjoyed this video and I will
see you in the next one
