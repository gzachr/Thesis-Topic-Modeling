All you looking at. I was looking at TV up like, what was on the screen? No biggie. We are today reacting to a 1 2 3 Japan video, Manna. Japanese. Try Filipino beer and alcohol for the first time. This is going to be interesting for us. We've had some experiences with alcohol ourselves in Philippines. I reckon we've probably tried most of these, but let's see if there's some different ones. It could be fun. It's Manna. Hi, I missed our hand time. Mr. Hentai. It is shy. One day to read Japan and miss our hands. A shame. Okay. Okay, I'm free to drink your alcohol. I've never seen a drink before. I mean that. Usually I don't drink alcohol, but today it's a special day because you can hear. I'm really drinking alcohol, right? I have a drink. It's like a drink. I've been drinking alcohol before and I'm so excited. I've been drinking alcohol for 15 years. Yeah. And it's nighttime. So today we're going to drink a little bit of alcohol. It's from the 7 a.m. In this video please subscribe our channel and I'm going to watch one of the ones that we're going to watch. Let's go. We have a 1 2 3 4 5 and I'll also drink a little bit of alcohol. Oh, now it's okay. I'm just eating but I'm hungry. One more. It's so snacks on my favorite money. So let's drink alcohol and eat with 3 pills next. Recently we cannot go to the 3 pills right now because virus. It's so sad but we can feel like 3 pills no start, right? So let's go. So first one, how about this one? The first one, going in deep. So strong. What is it? It's beer. Yes beer. Eight. Eight. Same person. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Filipina. Red horse is strong. I put it here this one. This one is Japanese alcohol. The percentage of alcohol is only 3. And I have a chance to drink alcohol. I always pick up this one because this one is already 3% alcohol and it's not strong. But this one is 8 so like 3 times. She likes to know percentage of it is stronger I think. About 5% A little bit. So like a strong beer. Wow, it's so awesome. So hot. Lime. Coffee cup. I'll just smear. Beer of course. Interesting pouring method. Yeah, making cringe. It smells so sane. Yeah. It's like they just take a shot. It's like it is on the side. Scary. Yeah. Wow, he likes that. He's not drunk. Yeah, he's not drunk after one red horse. And that is not hard to do actually to get drunk off one red horse. I feel like one now. Because so many Japanese girls don't like Japanese beer. She's saying it's not strong. She's saying it feels more watery and mild. Which I think is the 5th start. She likes that I'm going to like even more than 8% Is it good? Always. Always beer. So we should give the squad to them. One, two, three, four. Yay. The taste is so quite tasty. So even in girls can drink and this one is 8% So even drink little bit. We can make high-tem shot. And it's like an imported party. We should prepare this one. It's more fun I think. We love it. Next one is which one do you want to eat? This is hilarious. What are they going for? Last, relaxing chill beer. That's not really strong for a light isn't it? I didn't know that. Thank you. Oh. Thank you. Thank you. Cheers. Light. Wow. Water? I feel like the top water. After drinking red horse yeah. Water. It's so water. So water. We're drinking. It's not going to be this one. It's like we have that. Oh natural flavour. It's funny. Oh. Natural pizza. Oh my god. It's a natural hip-hop. It's like cheesy. It's a mastery. Oh no. Oh Chris, it's now. It's a good combination. It's a good combination. Pretty peanut snacks are like western style. I mean like salty, strong flavour. So it makes us like... I'm going to look for them in 7 or 11. Next time I go there. Good combination. No. It's good. I highly recommend it. This one if people cannot drink alcohol, you can try this one first. I mean this one. This is not medical advice. Okay. One, two, three, four. Oh. Oh he likes the stronger beer. Beer. New taste. Not enough for you. Yes. I think our style is opposite. So if you are really like drink alcohol, you can follow him. And if you don't drink alcohol so much, you can follow me. Next one is original one. This is one of my favourite beers in Philippines. It's classic. I feel like I've had an ice cold Hellpilsen on the beach. So many times. Oh a sandy, old beer. It's such a nice feeling. Oh strong. Actually I don't know the percentage. I like it a lot. Japanese beer. Yeah, it's it. It's very nice. What? It's a snack. I think all of us like after walking, my dad would say like Oh my god. I can feel like I know she means like some beers. Yeah, yeah. Why do we have this small store? Yeah. How many are there? That's strong as well. I don't know. I'm not surprised. Do Japanese one, right? It's strong for me. This is a great video. I want to do something else. We could do this you know. But we've already had all the beer. And I know this case is a light of beer but for me it's strong. It's strong. It's strong. It's strong. It's strong. I'm sure my dad really like this one because my dad really like Japanese beer. If he drink this one he must say like five stars. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Time for my husband's father's. I love this. I'm really. I'm so curious how what video we know. Please comment down below. Okay.
