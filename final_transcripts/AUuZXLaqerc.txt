Now this one is the pot is a tin so I need to get the grinder and just chop it off. Okay Gong-Gong my neighbor who give us those plants I just call him and give him some bakery stuff and he was happy. And somebody supervising us. Hello? She's happy. Okay some more plants they need to buy big pots as well. You don't seem to find big pots so I have to go to deep log near the Sanaco I think they got. As for those one anything is red it's growing well anything green looks like it's coming down. Anyway we'll see. We'll see that few days time. Okay Jeremy I'm saying that they're going to grow new leaves those green ones. So that'll be good. I guess in a year time things will be sort of a little more and pleasant and nice I guess I hope. We still have a lot of work to do there. Okay that one rub is done thanks God. That was a big job. Next put my desk there. Oh planty water coming off has been running so it's good. The iPad is out of batteries so we put the TV for the little one. She enjoy keep her quiet busy it's good for us they give us time to do things around the house. Okay breakfast time now I'm gonna make breakfast. Breakfast egg tuna spread I have garlic always two to three gloves of garlic every morning. Let's eat. Not too much because. You like coffee? No. No. Yeah no I shouldn't. Now there we finish in the shade. Spread it like a gravel inside. Good. Yeah that'll do. It's on your shed. Now I can rent it. All right. Okay we're gonna move this desk. Let's shut down. Let's go for it. Okay now we can start with a car port concrete floor. Plenty water, plenty of rental last night. Okay back to moving my desk. What's up? What's up? I want the other two connect or disconnect the... What's up? Okay I'm gonna leave this. Okay that's it down. I just need a decent office chair but because when I have his broken that's okay. Somebody fall asleep. And she gorgeous. My wife making a beautiful lunch. I'm sure. Very healthy. Okay jam has done a delicious pancit. Yum. I'm hungry now. Very healthy. I suppose to put an egg. I can put egg here. You want? Right egg. Enough for me. I cannot fry something. I need to get changed. Okay another healthy lunch. This is good. Yeah. But someone has to have rice. Get the meat. Okay. I'm not. Okay let's hit. Good job chair. Hello baby. You already had your bottle. That's good. That's the best time I have a lunch. We slow down everything but I still got the work and the back working so... Let's hit. Okay we started. I'm going to hit. Okay we got more sand in. Just now. That little green truck. That little green truck. Okay. Okay so this is our shed organized. A lot of stuff came here. Still more. Still more. That's pretty good. This is what you saw maybe before the veranda. Emcee. This was all in the veranda actually. So all good now. It's all locked up. Okay. Most cement for the carpets and rebar. Is there a big enough? Okay the second is a lot of water. We don't have that on our thing. It's only for personal use. So they're going to go to the river and fill up as many containers as possible. And it's free. Yeah he can... Justin can drive. He's got a driver license. It's no problem. And the road to the river is all bitumen. I didn't know so I will have to go and show you. Okay so that's how far we went. It's a bit slow. But that's the way it is. I mean you know life is very cheap. Although I paid them well. They get good money. They're happy. There's other people who came here for work, former workers. But I can't hide too many. I can't afford. I'm trying to use part of my pencher as well to finish all this. So that's the best I can do. So anyway I'm happy. It's two people job. Okay normally maybe four or five people will finish in two or three days. But I only got two so I'm going to take a week. That's okay. The garden's going well. Okay. Let's go back in the house because we got no power. So I couldn't buy any water next to the Surry store there because the pump's not working. So the boys went to the river. That's okay. Robert Elvia here. Tataki tuna. Tataki tuna. Tataki tuna guys. Don't buy Robert is delicious. Oh my god. Thank you Robert. What I will do with that too. Thank you Elvia. Thank you mommy for bringing the glasses on the plate. And she loves it. She loves it yeah. Yeah everybody loves it. That's not greasy. That's super. Yummy. No it's not going to open a restaurant. We already spoke about. We didn't come here to work out us again. Okay let's share with me with Jason and Junior. Those spaghetti are absolutely beautiful. Give plenty. I'm sure they'll love it. Yeah or else you're going to eat or... I'm sure the family will share as well. It's okay. It's plenty there. Let's go. Here. She loves Elvia. That's what makes a nice picture. It looks like she understands. Here my baby. Tataki. Mommy. Don't be jealous mommy. Thank you. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye. Bye bye. Here we have beautiful lunch. Beautiful Japanese Takati and spaghetti. And a lot of wine so may go for a nap now. Yeah a little bit slow but it's pretty day. That's all happening today. It's very very hot so... Excuse me a bit slow. It's ticking hot. Break with a shovel. Break with a shovel. Easy quick. Yeah. Oh this water come from the river. It's a good idea. The Russia is one, two, three. One cement, two sand, three gravel. That's a good quality premium cement. I'm going to put it on the ground. I'm going to put it on the ground. I'm going to put it on the ground. The sun is very sharp so big around the coming for sure I know. I'm getting back into the house. It's too hot. I can't just fill up what I've just left out in the container in the tank and get some of water from the river before they go home. It's going to run anyway. Look at the weather there. A lot of black clouds. That's it for today. See how we go. Big rain coming. That's good. We've got a lot of plants that need to be watered so we don't have to do that. That's it for today. See you in the morning. Good morning. We had a very, very bad tropical storm last night. We couldn't sleep. Huge thunderstorm. The house was shaking. It never had water like this in the veranda but we had this time. We need to put some curtain or some soap all around. But it was really bad. I'm pretty sure there would have been off-flodded down there. I never see so much rain. Oh, surprise. There's still here. I've been to so many chand-holstery clubs. All the tanks are full, I guess. One big team. We think it's been taken down by the storm last night. We just dug out this piece of finisher from Bella's room. I tried to organize it better here. It was prepared to install the sink but it's no power. That's okay. I can't do lighter when the power is come back. This whole area is like a pantry. I put things and bags of spaghetti and all those things. Here are the plates, folks, whatever. Still a bit shy for them cooking. Maybe in the future I will put the macro every bit higher. I won't put over the fridge. A lot of people do that but it's too high for JN. Anyway, slowly, slowly. Six taking shape. Okay, there's no power. After this big tropical storm last night, apparently there's no power for today. So today's Saturday. So the boys wanted to go home because there's no power. I can't do anything. They need to cut three bars and things. So that's it. They're going home. As far as we're concerned, we're going to the beach. This is nobody's work. Today, Saturday. We're going to the beach. Are we? I'm ready. I got my swimsuit. Daddy, do you like it? Let's go. Miss Jam ready? Let's go. Come on. Come on, it's coming. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. She loved it. How did you like the beach, baby? Did you enjoy the beach? Did you like it? Yeah. I think you like it. It's good. You weren't scared. Am I love it? Yeah. You weren't scared of the waves. Amazing, huh? And salty water. Sea water is very good for the skin. For your little pimple and things like that. Yeah. And now you're going to be able to sleep nicely, deeply. Maybe we hope so. Okay, maybe here on Joddo Beach as well. Yeah, I guess we'll come back and give us power for 20 minutes and the power is off again. So today's Saturday I think tomorrow, no live stream. This is going to be out for two days due to that big storm last night. Thank you for watching this video. I hope you enjoyed this video into the next video. Take care. Good play, Saul. Bye. You
