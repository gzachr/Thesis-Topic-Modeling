 It's time to double check. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. First thing, whenever you leave a hotel, make sure to double check a hotel because you might forget something. So, right now I'm double checking everywhere here, even in the bathroom. I need to double check. Yeah, let's go. Let's hear the echo. I'm going to be a good boy. Let's turn off the echo. Yeah, good boy. All right. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Welcome ladies. Bring you there here in V&C. Okay. Please, I hope I don't forget anything. Good morning. How are you? Too nice. Do you need a bigger call, first? Are you going to make a call? All right. So, here's the key. Get the key first. Yeah, 1,100. Okay, I'm coming. All right ladies and gentlemen, so I was saying right here and one travel hack I have for you guys. So, this is a travel hack for you guys. Always make sure to stay on low key, but you need to check, like you need to do a lot of research to find beautiful places for cheap prices. So, I was staying right here at first I stayed in this room down here, which is a single bear, and I was paying 500 pesos per night. And then later I transferred to another room there number 4 is a double bear, and I was paying 6,700 pesos per night. And which is cheap for a vacation, and as a person who loves to travel, and you want to travel more, I won't go to a place where I'm going to pay 5000 pesos for one air and what not. So 5,000 pesos can be used for a week or two for my accommodation, food and everything. And that's how you be able to travel more and share stories around the world. But if you want to show off bro you won't go anywhere. So we started from right here and the time is coming where we're gonna be in Vlas. We're gonna be sponsor in Vlas. Alright so let's pay him and hello my friend from Vegan City say hi shout out to the people from Vegan City. How are you? Do you speak Tagalog or Ilocano? Ilocano. How do you say hi in Ilocano? Hi.

Let's go and grab a tricycle. But before we go back to Manila I'm going to take you to the historical city or the historical place in Viga City.

The one thing I love about this city is that there are tricycles everywhere. It's easy to move from one place to another. Unlike Baguio City. Baguio you have to wait for 45 minutes. One hour. Oh, see these houses here? Yeah. Yeah. Very old, the Spanish houses. And I'm going to tell you something later about the houses here. Very interesting. Very interesting. I'm going to tell you.

Oh, the woohoo this. I give you a very good morning. Good morning. Good morning. So look at this McDonald here guys. It's like a church or the design of the McDonald's is even different from the ones in Manila. Even the Jolabee. And I feel all of them like have a green to carry the same color. I don't know it's cream but I think this is the color vegan right here. So right now we are standing before this church. Yeah, look at this huge church. I'm not sure if some of you guys know this church but if you went to vegan or you've been watching vegan vegan, you know this church. Yeah. And we're going to tour around this city. But look here on the floor. So the floor here is not an ordinary floor like the like Manila. So I'm not sure what they actually use is like bricks. They use the bricks to make the floor. Oh wow. All right guys. So I'm going to put my wallet and let's get to business. Yeah, let's get to business. Business is where I'm going to talk to you guys properly and oh just a moment. Oh my god. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh my back. And I close him. Oh, oh, oh. God bless my book. All right. All right guys. Welcome back. So we have all national books store right before us here.

And as you can see right now people are all developing the place for Christmas. There is a place right before they are kind of constructing or very big Christmas tree but we're not going there. So this is Jollibee and this is Shocking. This is McDonald's so you have all of them here. So let's go walk in vegan city and talk to some locals right there. All right. Before we go into main city. So this is vegan city guys for those of you who don't know. I'm in the Philippines right now and I'm in I'm in vegan city. So vegan city is located in Ilocos and it is actually the capital city of Ilocos. So vegan is time a friend. Hello. Vegan city is the capital city of Ilocos but not just the capital city. This is of very historical city because we are a lot of people already know that the Spanish or the Spaniards used to occupy power the Philippines before and doing the because the Philippines was colonized by Spanish people. So if you see a very old buildings here they will always look like you know that Spanish design of building and look at this tower right here. There's one of them that the F-quake actually hit the last time but this is not it but I think this was also affected and then let me tell you something very fast. I'm not sure if I was just afraid but last night in my hotel room not last time but this morning around 3 a.m. it was like shaky. The building was shaking. The building was shaking and the bear was I feel the bear moving like moving a lot of times and even the teens in the room. I'm not sure if that was F-quake. I'm not sure if that was an F-quake or it was just maybe I was just afraid. I'm not sure what actually what actually was going on. I'm really happy. I want to go this way. Sorry guys. Sorry let's go this way. And this is going to be a rough look so I'm not cutting anything. All right so I know this should be a way here to go in here. Oh look at this huge church right here so we are passing by this church. Oh my jacket. So let's go find our way here. So as I was saying I'm going to ask the look us if there was an F-quake last night because the place was really shaky and oh what I did do we hear. Good morning my friend. How are you? What's this? Can I ask? Fizz mask? What fist mask? Fizz mask. It's too big for fist mask. So you're going to have an even here later? What time? 9 a.m. What's the even? No even? More, more even. I'm not sure what you say. This is walking around. So I think they're going to have an even here later. I'm not sure what it is and I'm not sure if I'm going to be around 9 a.m. Yeah I'll be around 9 a.m. to see. So look at this tower right there. And take a look at this way right here. All right so let's go back to the history of Vegan City. Oh Vegan. All right so as I was saying this city was actually established in the 1500s and since the 1500s the people of Vegan have agreed to preserve the buildings here like the style of buildings here. So they even have restrictions if you want to build a house here and which I'm going to show you in a bit. I'm about to show you. Hi my friend. How are you? You're good? All right. From Vegan City? Oh nice. So see these buildings here. They are now like the ordinary ones in Manela or around the Philippines. So when I came here I had a few of big intermerrors because this place looks exactly like intermerrors and I think the only difference the the flow. I'm not sure if I saw this in intermerrors but yeah it could be there too because they are the same Spanish people. So look at these buildings here and the people of Vegan have preserved these buildings to be a way of you know of like the start the start of houses here in Vegan City. So that's why my tour guide told me so if you want to build a house if you are trying to build a house here you have a reservation you cannot build skyscrapers here like in Manela to build a very high skyscrapers and that's for another reason because this place is actually oh actually an earthquake zone so a lot of earthquake take place here and that's the wish we were we were in last last time I think somewhere here. I think some art okay here all right see this city here. You have a lot of statues here of Catholic priests and different people governors so look at this statue right here I'm not sure which one is this. So let's enter the old city here and look at these buildings here oh my god wow so this one this building actually it's not a very old building this is very new but it looks new or it has been renovated but if you see the start of this building here look at the start of the building here it's not like the ones in Manela so it's really different and it has this punish feel right here but take a look at these ones here these are very old buildings here look at them yeah look at them here so these are very old buildings here and here I think the people see a lot of souvenirs here hello good morning how are you.
