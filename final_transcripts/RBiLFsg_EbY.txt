Many people say I'm not glad Japanese This is supposed to be an interview But at the same time, I will be sharing in a part of my own view about the Philippines also So is this your first time in the Philippines? No, it's my second time Really? I have been to CIA before, five years ago Because I really like CIA, so I come back Five years ago I'm trying to calculate how old you are, the USC at Sinagia Yeah, at Sinagia, just 16 years old at the time And then you came back five years later Yes Oh, interesting When you came to the Philippines five years ago Were you the only one? With your parents? With my brother And you have an older brother Yeah, older brother Also came to CIA? Yeah, also studying Wow, that's good to know So what was your first impression about the Philippines when you came here five years ago? I think the most fun is when I need to pass the road, I just need to rest my hand And all cars were stopped Really? Yeah, in the Philippines You just tell them Yeah, stop And all cars were stopped Because I heard Because in Taiwan we need to follow the policy We need to wait for the Although the traffic Yeah So I think this one is my most Really, that's interesting Most of the people I have interviewed Always complaining about the Philippines traffic They always say that they are scared of crossing But you telling me now that you will just tell them Stop and they will stop It's kind of surprising to me But actually There are some places in the Philippines Where you need to obey the traffic lights So Yeah Not everywhere you just tell them Yeah, stop Please stop So When you came to the Philippines the first time What did you think about the Philippines? The first time? Yeah Because at that time I just 16 years old And I think my English is not good So I'm afraid of talking to the people at that time But I want to experience a lot of things in Philippines So I just do my best and make a lot of friends Yeah I think Philippines is very friendly Yeah, very nice You want to try If you talk to them They are very happy And they want to share a lot of things with you Yeah, so the year when you're Filipino friends I don't have a father When I was in a shopping mall or just walking the street A lot of people were saying I know how to say I'm not Korean I guess it Yeah, in the Philippines if you're black You're from America If you're black like my skin color They think I am from America And then if you're white, they think you are from either America Also or Korea That's the only thing They don't know any other country If I'm going on my streets Everybody will tell me Oh man Are you from America? Are you from the USA? I will not tell them No, I will say yes I'm from the USA I'm from Korea What has changed from five years ago to five years later What has changed is you have seen in the Philippines?
