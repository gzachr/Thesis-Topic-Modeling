 What is this one? This one is a jelly cream dessert. Really creamy. One try. How much? 30 pesos each. How many? I just want. Only one. No, no, no, no. The hands are getting full. We're in the baguette on the night market tonight and I got the agar, agar, uh, creamy strawberry drink, creamy jello, whatever. Let's do this. Oh, no. It's like strawberry or super sweet. Kind of like a strawberry milk and a strawberry jello mixed together. It's pretty dink. It's really sweet but it's really tasty. I would drink this if I didn't just have a taro milk tea that was larger than this too. And we have another sweet thing so that's fantastic. It's really dink good? I like it.
