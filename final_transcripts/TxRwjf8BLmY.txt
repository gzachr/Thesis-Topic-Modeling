Really one of my favorites. I think me, you're gonna like this because it's salt and vin. I think we're not gonna say that last four four letters. I bet you'd be the same dude. S and V sounds like ice-pice. Have we given a lot of people in the comments lately telling me that I sound like ice-pice? I'm like, here. That's a liar. I'll give you here. I'll give you guys my best ice-pice. You thought I was filling you? I don't know. I don't know. Anyway, okay. Boy, she. I don't know. Boy, she sounds Japanese. It is Japanese. It means, okay. It's not, it's Filipino. Sorry. Oh. Ah! Oh. Alright, smell. Really good. Mmm. Did you get the rice cracker? You're like glad to. I've never had this kind of texture with the salt and vin flavor. But it shows a little stronger, but this is gasoline. My turn. Oh, friends, do you guys some more? Ooh. Alright, my turn. Nice. Well, nine. Nine. Mom. Alright, I'll let you try to say that. Three tries. Boy! Boy! Boy! Boy? Boang! Boy! Boy! Boy! Boy! Boy! Boang Cornic. Correct. The way to pronounce this is Boy Ba Wang. This is the spicy flavor. Ooh. This is just the regular flavor. Hot crime. Let's do this one first. If you imagine, they're pretty much like corn nuts. Eight. Nuts. Oh, damn. That's halagar like you. Oh. Wow. I like garlic. That's alright. Yeah, for smelling so strong. No, okay. Yeah, no, it's not strong. Okay, I love corn nuts, so I love nuts. Here you go. These are really good. They're kind of smoky. Like smokey. What do you add? I think it's like a very neutral snack. It's not like too crazy. I'm gonna say six. Yeah, I think like six is better. I'll go just like kind of half because I like the texture. Mm-hmm. I think they're good like they're adding gamer from you. Oh, yeah. Hot ones aren't even hot. I'm gonna go with these with their little six too. They're six to seven. They're the same. No, no, five. Come on, boy, buy one. Be better. I'm gonna go with the five here because they're not spicy. Yeah. They're like a little spicy. Yeah. Alright, my turn. Garlic vinegar. Hey, watch your mouth. Sorry, garlic vinegar. Well, these are tippy's. By Jack and Jill went up the hill to Bengiwama. I guess they're like the Afridos equivalent. If you see anything of these, these are like corn. I think they're corn, right? Corn chips? Yeah. Interesting. Is it? No, I don't think I've had these. I'm still pretty plain. It's like not crazy, but it's like not bad. I know when you eat like fritos. Maybe I just like want some. I don't have like a rich flavor almost. I kind of want more. Yeah, one more. I think it was stronger. The flavor is not very pretty good so far. Maybe if you shake it. Do you want me to shake it too? Can you want to try? Oh my God. You're not like crazy. Six and a half. I'm like a wild. My home. Here we have Pandey Ube. Ube is, uh, if you guys don't know. Ube is so gaff. I'll say it in your, it's tudo. But pretty much it's like a sweet roll with Ube, like, uh, kind of filling in it. There's a place by my house, like, personally, where I think it's the best. How sweet. So is it like a bakery? Yeah. You get it from? Yeah. Okay. But you know, it's just a little small roll with, uh, Ube inside. It's perfectly yams, if you will. And this was like, my mom used to buy this for me so much. Is it like a kid? I want to go. Mmm. Mmm. I don't know if the filling was going to be dry or too. This isn't the best of it though. It's probably really good when you heat it up. That's what I was saying, kid too. Actually, I don't know. I like anything cold a little. You know, you ever been... Yeah, the way more filling to me. What the f***? Well, I think I was going to be my only complaint is that. There's not a lot of it in there. Mmm. And here's not a bunch of them. That's me right now. What do you think? Oh, it's good. Mmm, I already know what I'm gonna put my phone. What? I'm biased, so I love those. I think it's the best, but I like the... It's all paid for me. I'm only seven and a half. But it's, you can't see the Cheuchara. No, they're different flavors. All right, Cheuchara. Yeah, Cheuchara on. All three of them? We can do all three, because we all three. Okay, what flavor do you have? Uh, it's garlic flavor. Garlic flavor, this one is vin flavor. Now, is this regular? One, two, one, two, one. We're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're. This is probably the most unhealthy snack they do. Oh, it's supposed to be so bad for me. Mmm. Okay. This is the strongest vin flavor I've tasted so far. Really? Mmm. Oh, I like the garlic one too. I like the garlic one a lot. Ooh. So the thing about these ones, the salt ones. Some pieces are like really strong. And some of them are like misses. You want like more, uh, distribution of flavor. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I feel like I can almost see it though. Like the darker ones are probably the ones that are more flavor. Like the other flavor? Six and a half out of ten. Garlic. Eat out of ten. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Hey, I'm doing ratings. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Garlic, eat out of ten. Vin, eat in a half out of ten. What are you guys' ratings? Six. Yeah, six. Eight, nine. In a half, nine. You guys naturally, like, oh. Oh, I'm so sorry. Okay, more chippies, but we got barbecue and chili and cheese. Oh. Dude, why did they eat so hard to open teeth? Please, please. We just a big stomach. All in the adding. Okay, what's cool is that they don't even color it like barbecue. It's just like the flavor. I don't like that. Underwhelming. Yeah. It's a little better. Really? I don't like the flavor on that. I don't like either. I'm getting both flourished. I don't know what I'm gonna find. The two of three and the two of four. Let's try these. Golden sweet corn chips. Okay. Smell it. Ooh, smells like a corn kick. Yeah, corn, corn, corn, corn, corn, corn. Corn, corn, corn, corn, corn. Any other spots? Yeah. Very just like, hmm. That's so strong. Mmm, it's incredible. It's weird. It grows on me. I think I could like this, actually. I do like this. We'll take one more. I really like this six. Well, like, you know what's weird? I give it a seven because it's interesting. This does remind me of pops a little bit. Love my world. It goes like this. Mmm. You know? That one goes with six. Yeah, the ones that are coated. Okay, that's what I was about to say. I had a couple juicy ones. Mmm, what else? It was dusty. Oh. I'm gonna cut it off, some of them sweet again. I'm gonna go with this one. Yad, yad, there's a little cream. Oh, my God, that one, we gotta cut it off. I'm gonna keep it. I'm gonna keep it. Quick back story. Yeah, this looks like duck root. Have you ever had this before? Oh, this is a few, I'm not sure about it. Bro, this is my childhood. Yeah. All right, so pretty much it's a cracker. And then it has fun animals on it. Look, it says, Horace, my neighbor. Why the fuck is this saying that? Elephant, longest nose. What did you say? I don't know. I don't know. Okay, then you get a little chuck of duck. Mmm. Yeah, mine's made of a kid, bro. But if you have, you have to do. Mmm. Ooh, the chocolate is like thicker. I don't like the vanilla one more. I don't know if I'm saying it right. Is it Yanian or Yanian or Yanian? Yananian. Yananian. This is just like a six snap. Like just look at it. Like if you open your lunch box and you get, you see this? I think this is lit. It's kind of like those, you know the Oreo dunk things? Mm-hmm. But like not as sweet. Vanilla, eight out of 10, chocolate, seven out of 10. Drembo. Yeah, look all across the board. Don't have it. This is lit. Be cut, I guess be cut is, say it's like ruffles in the Philippines. So we got onion and garlic, cheese, barb, I see barb, we see. The garlic is a big thing, huh? A garlic is like a pretty big, like in Filipino everything. So I would say yes. Ooh, it's pretty good. It's in your big small man. Putting our spices of big strong. They're kind of thinner than ruffles. Isn't it interesting? This tastes very Filipino. I don't feel like my garlic. Yeah. I have to choose two. I have a very strong one. What the hub into this thing? These are very strong, man. The garlic is very garlicy. It's like the boy-boy wing. I like it though. My favorite, I'll write this from three to one. Three, two, one. Yeah. All right, great. One, two, three. Yeah. These pics, oh, dang, we're going there. When you hear like Filipino, like foods, or like things that you buy the store or snacks, this is a staple that is in every single Filipino household. It usually comes in a tin like this, but you have to open it with a spoon. I just couldn't find it as to go with this. But it's literally the hardest thing ever. You have to get a fuck spoon to open it. Sounds very full. But they're just regular, f***ing crackers. It's weird because I like them, but I can see if you guys have done it. Wow. These are fancy. But the cool thing about them that I like is that they're triangulated kind of. It has a preparation. So it's cool because you can just go like this. Boom. It's puffer, right? It's puffer, right? Cheers. These are crackers. And some saltines. No, the salt. That's good. Sometimes my lunch box, wow, I just get a crack at ease. Not by a salt, but like, it's supposed to be like a snack. Six and a half. I actually kind of like these. It's weird. I don't know how to explain it, but like these I can literally just smack them with salt. Wait, no, they're so really good. For crackers, right? Like, just for playing crackers? Wait, so I'm gonna revive seven and a half. I like these a lot. No, bro, just for regular crackers, I feel like they're very good. So these are like a different kind of strip chips. Like, you know, these ones are more kind of like, ready. These are kind of more like, like fluffy. Onion and garlic. Barbecue. Original. Boom. Woo, woo, woo. Whoa. I like the texture on. Mm. I like the texture. Once again, onion and garlic taste is not that strong. Either it's too garlicy or not enough. Why can't Filipinos find the balance? Just getting, I like onion and garlic. Oh, right? It's kind of weird. Okay, I think, oh, good. Seven and a half. Both of those. That maybe is hard. I'm like really focusing the time, different taste, you know? Yeah. I think I'm a good onion garlic and the barbecue, both eight. I'll get the least. I'll get them both eights. And then the regular one, like a six and a half. That's exactly what I was gonna say. You wanna try the stico? Yeah, let's see the stico mode. I also, as a kid, love eating these. Why is there two with a plastic around it? That's for, to travel safely across the tough waters. So this one is chocolate wafer? Yeah, why are there two just like, perhaps? Maybe there's the best ones. Smoked weed everyday. One of me and my cousin were kids. We would like, you know, we would like, eat them like their cigarettes. Smoked weed everyday. I like the chocolate one more. I'm gonna do it with my own. I'm gonna do your extra cheese. Okay, wanna get flavor. This is a little light. I don't need the most of anything crazy. I don't know if the chocolate has actually, like, filling inside of it. Yeah. Not my, okay, one more is like, like, it's just like that, don't know. Seven. I'm gonna, six. Maybe, we're just gonna go six and a half, six. I think I'm gonna go six and a half, five. Maybe with milk, it could be, it's okay, it's potential. My turn. This is pretty much like, bro, it's called bro, us. And they're lady finger biscuits. And it's like, you can just always expect this to be at your grandma's house. Okay, wait, let's see if this is the same, like, is just type, where's though? Cause when you see these, is there any probability that the inside is not actually bro, us, but it's like, so in kid. So in kid. Okay, so the reason why I wanted to get this one, cause you know how I said it was a metal tin. So it's like a, it looks like this. And then there's like a circle, like a circular thing in the middle. And then you would open it. There's a sewing table. Like, I always feel like, and this is like a food, it's like, when you eat it, like, while there's food in it, you're like, ah, like whatever, right? And then when you're like, well, I'm really craving this. And then you open it and it's not that, you just crave it even more. And it's a sewing table. Yeah. Damn, that is huge. So I think you're supposed to keep this with like coffee. Let's go. And one thing where I know it's not like good, but I like to get it. I don't know what it is. I like to eat this. I was a little more. Dude, there's just one party of a mom's house. I was sipping, I was doing karaoke. I swear, I was so hungry. And I don't know why, but I just, I do like smack that guy. Oh my God. Dude, how? I know. But we just have to try because like, literally in every Filipino household, there's definitely a boss. Like in the comments, they would be like, why did you not get this if you didn't have it? Yeah, there's gonna be someone from the Philippines like, oh, why didn't you get, bro us? Yeah. My friends had to. Mr. Ice Spice White, you get boss. He's their month. Or he's not playing with me. He's the month. He's the month. Oh my God. All right, picnic. Piss. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. I'm talking to you. I feel like he's the only one who's really talking to me. Picknik. Picknik. These kinds of like in Japan, I know these are fired. Dude. You know what's weird? I just like, don't like them, but I do. No, you don't. Exactly, you're talking about them. They're like, they look like enough. Yeah, I'm so to see that. There's a little mini in the enough fire. But I can eat the fourth. Dude, I don't like playing les. I don't like it, but if it was just there, I would eat all of them. You know what I mean? I exactly like to play les. No, I would not eat a whole back of plain les. I don't want to. Psychopath. No, I just just don't. Yeah, she's crazy. Six out of 10. I'm going. You got to respect it. Not banging, but you will eat all of it. Yeah. Give an opportunity. Yeah. Six. Honestly, things are like four or five. I need some flame of flame in my life. I'm going to make up the new egg. Make up the new egg. Whoa. Oh, wow. Oh, really? Wow. Whoa. Oh, dude, these are going to smack about. Yeah, that are going to be like, eh. Yeah. Oh, cheesy. Joe. Woo, cheers. Whoa. Whoa. Why is that like a sweet thing at the end? Yeah, what the heck? Why is that cheese like steel? Maybe it is. I like these ones, but the cheese girls, not the cheese rings. What about picnic? You know what you're saying? I think you would like. What? The way? What? The way? The way. The way. The way. The way, bro. How am I getting it off for just because it's weird? Yeah, it's weird. It's weird. It's weird too. It's weird too. I don't like it. All right. I can't eat more than one of those. I think you guys will like these. These are actually very flavorful. And I think spicy cheese. I'm done. I like my... This one is Arabang Mani. Arabang Mani. You probably said it better. My cousin loves these, bro. Look, there's three of these on his desk right now. Oh my god. They got baseball games and new Philippines. No, no, no. There's play baseball. They did. These would be great. I've done many pack-out fights. No. No, generally peanuts are like good for you. These peanuts are not good for you. But it tastes good. It's not just great. Look at these. Seven. Seven and a half for me. Six and a half. So, oyster prawn crackers. Dang, this just smells strong. Honestly, bro, I feel like these are two like shrimp-y chips. You really need them. Seven and a half. Seven. You've both pretty good. I like that. Original. Yeah. I need two. We'll go eight. Six and a half. It's like, when I see spicy, I want something to be like spicy. I'm just going to go seven to a row. You can start on that. You can get into this one. Not a bag in these yesterday. Eight and a half already though these. Can you finish them overnight? These ones are the best. Uh-huh. These gotta be like nine. Nine. Nine, automatic nine, phase ones. Cause they don't really even taste like shrimp. Dried mangoes? Or 10 out of 10? I will. These are 10 out of 10. The whole Costco big pack. Probably. And you know I've beat it because I've not said anything about it. And I didn't happen to beat it. Well, I've probably been in these the most out of anything. I think this of the fill piece, like this is the greatest thing to come out of the fill piece. I agree. Other than mani pack out. See, and they never last more than like one or two cities. I eat these so fast. You know the real Costco bag? I don't go. It's not a whole thing. Yep. I couldn't find it cause it's like a special place. But my mom gets me this but then there's a layer of chocolate coated on it, bro. Oh, I've seen no such thing though. It's my favorite thing. Everything is so good. Yes. These are the ones, man. And these are the ones. Yeah, if you'll beat people. Good job. I'm making me a pack, y'all. This is a putum pakwan. Putum pakwan. So what does that say? Can I say putum pakwan? Can I say putum pakwan? Right. Boy! Putum pakwan! They're like sunflower seeds but watermelon seeds. It's like you eat them like sunflower seeds. You eat them like, yeah, we do love them. I don't really know how to eat like sunflower seeds. I would just be honest. Really? No, I don't. Really? So like what I would do as a kid, like they just taste so good salted. I would just suck on them in the spin-off. I could smell the meat. We'll look for. Mmm. I would just get some flowers. There's a little bit more snap to them. Oh yeah. I'm trying to eat it like that. You can't really like to throw a bunch of them off. Yeah, you can. Alright, what are these? Salvinata. The what? Banana chips. Oh, banana chips. Six and a half. Mmm. Oh, you. Mmm. Mmm. Y'all look crazy about banana chips, you go. Really? I love banana chips. Look at my eight. Where are you giving these? Mmm. Alright. Next up, pandan cake. Alright, pandan cake. So pandan is a buku pandan. It's like a dessert. It's green. Ooh, these look so fluffy. They're like a sponge cake. Mmm. Mmm. I like one of the nice hot coffee. It's like some milk, bro. But all my younger younger younger's are not. I like these. I like them all. I like eight too. I'm going eight and a half. Here. Can we start with these? Probably my mom's favorite thing ever. And because of that, I love these as well. Oh. Oh, weird. It's like, so I just know they're not like great, but I don't like them. Oh, I'm just not a huge chocolate guy. So, I'm a smart. What are these types of? I don't know. But like, I don't know what it is, bro. I love it. Hershey kisses. Yeah, they don't taste like crispy. Yeah, they do. Yeah, they do. I don't like Hershey kisses, bro. I don't like Hershey kisses. Oh, but it gives out a seven. Eat the flat tops. I'm just not a chocolate guy. I get a very chocolatey, very chocolatey. Mom, I'm going to give it a 10. I'll try these. I don't know what you'll think, but I personally think they taste kind of still. It's very preservative, I think. You see what I mean? I respect it. I'm just not out of the phone. I'm going to give it a three. I'm going to go two. This is like your kid. Oh, I know this is going to be fun. Full of tini's. Can I buy them? Mm. Oh, it's not as perfect in chocolate. I think it's going to be like cooler for some reason. I kind of like woppers. Yeah. Kind of whatever. Not the biggest mall guy. Me neither, my four and a half. My dad would like these, okay? It's a very acquired taste. These ones. Chocolate nut. The peanut milk chocolate. How much chocolate stuff, damn. I don't like these at all. I'm just a disclaimer right now. No, no, no. No, no. I'm getting too jockey. No. No. No. I just just like a little nibble in them. That's a good one. One, two. I don't know which one of these are going to be the best. But full of it all is like a shortcake. It's so dry. Why is this also dry? I'm very talking. Oh, not bad. Yeah, I think I'm going to answer mine on that one. No, no, no. I actually just remember. I don't like homegrown. I need that flavor. Well, the desserts are so dry. I would say Filipino like package like snack desserts are not good, but Filipino dessert dessert is good. Maybe we'll do another video. I'm just regular Filipino dessert. The panon cake looks good though. Yeah. I love very dry. That's why if you get Filipino desserts, it's all you need. It's all you need. All right, Michelle. Thank you guys so much for watching.
