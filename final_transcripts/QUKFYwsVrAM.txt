 It's been 20 days and I covered my entire traveling luggage around 11AM at 25pm. Yeah, it's been a long time and I want to visit home. I wanna say hi to you in A year. I usually have auntie reun ornament with me on my birthday. There's some blue sky there. That's getting bigger. And blue, yeah. So there's another little one there. Oh, it's a big one. Oh, there's one there as well. So here we have a spare bed for some carrots and cauliflower. So I'm going to put in here some carrots and some cauliflower, which I love. And they're hard to get in the Philippines. They're quite expensive. So I've not seen too much in a way cauliflower, puffing the supermarkets. Also very expensive. So we're going to grow our own as I do love veg. I'm missing some of the English favorites. So we went out today to Mikkozikopark with Isabella. We're going to go to a new restaurant tonight. Well, it's fairly new for us anyway. It's all you can eat. It's called Flanero Kitchen. I think I've been out of that right. It's just over the road. It's not far from where we are. They're open on Saturdays and Sundays, five o'clock to eight o'clock. It's all you can eat. It's cookie. It comes cookie. The cookie. My god, it's my way. It's cookie. It's all cookie. Oh, cookie. James and Jim are getting us going back into our Filipino fitness. We all need it. Speaking of which, it's Filipino fans. Oh, we're joking. She's going to be fat this afternoon tonight or you can eat. Or you can eat. It's not you. You're going to be missing even fatter in this. Oh, dear. Mr. Fattness, I smell it. You're wearing it in the Fattness. Oh, dear. What's this you're doing? Like a game which you didn't know. Let's see his developer games. No, I'm not going to stop. It's building. Building a body. No! It's like some type. It's building a bird. That's the rocket. Rocket. It's like something's been shot. Oh, dear. That's what Isabella does when she's not going to be fit in a new bathroom tap. Here's an example. A couple of pipes, water pipes. These aren't ours. These are the neighbors. They come from along there. Along the main road. And these pipes here. They serve the houses down there. As you can see, they're quite flimsy. They're not buried. And quite easy to break. So all in all, not a great design for water here in the Philippines. The pipes. Yeah, the pipes say split quite easily. And when they split mud comes in, you can ruin your whole water system, ruin your taps. You have to be careful. We're going to get a filter. But now I'm going to replace one of our bathroom taps. So excuse us slightly messy bathroom. We need to clean it later. Here's our bathroom tap. And that one sweet. As you can see. We do get water, right? We do get water out of that. There's no one near as strong as it used to be. It's built up. All the mud in the debris built up. I took it off yesterday to give it a clean. Fortunately the tap, I think, has had it. So we're going to need to replace it. We see our normal pressure. This is our shower. And it's got a very, very strong pressure. We like the pump. You can see we have pretty decent water pressure here. Almost always we don't need the pump to come on. But we have it just in case it drops below 20. And it's very effective. I'm not qualified planner, but I try. So we're going to replace this tap. The first thing I want to do is turn off the water. We have angle valves on all of our taps. Our toilets, our showers. So it's very easy to isolate the water on every single outlet. But I have to turn the water off to the whole house. It saves a bit of time. So what I'm going to do is start by unscrewing the bottom. The water is going to come out that's fine. I'm then on to slid with that. I should buy the bucket here, mate. But this we've got a drainage here in the bathroom. It's not so bad. Here we are. Okay, so we have... 1.5 inch by 1.5 inch pipe. If you look it it's not the cleanest. Going to replace it with a new one, but a shorter one. So hopefully as there's not so many bends in it, it'd be more straight. The water should. Got a bit easier. Oh there we go. So we have our tap. Now we keep this. We'll try to take it apart and clean it. We might not be able to. So we keep it just as a spare just in case. We're going to sit with a very similar but a newer model. Let's hope this is better. The tap's on. The canter's on. Give this a go. Things cost. Okay, so we're going to turn it on and go valve. So there's no leaking from it on and go valve, that's good. There's no leaking from the tap. That's also really good. So let's turn this tap on. I hope it's the best. Ah, voila, look at that. Ah, water. I'm a bit sweaty but the job's been done. I've changed the tap in the bathroom. Jane had a little bit of a nap while I was doing it. Let's see what her reaction is. Jane, are you working with darling? What have you done? I've been filling with our plumbing. You like it? Yeah, what have you done? Oh wow, it looks a bit rough. It was good, it's not. The old one was it. No. It must have always been quality, even from day one. Yeah. You never got past happy pasting. You never got past the pluckhole, did it? That was about as good as it got. Yeah. Ah, that's in the darling. This was the only tap in the whole house that we've ever had a problem with. With water pressure. When it drops, it barely works. And now it's just at the best. Well done. You did it. I did it. Thank you. Thank you. So even though in the Philippines, it's much cheaper than in the West. If we called out a plumber, it would have cost around 500 pesos. For that small job, now the job only took me 10 to 15 minutes from start to finish. So part of the joy of having a house is DIY and maintenance. And if you can do it yourself, why not? We saved ourselves some money. Got a good result. Ah, so living in the Philippines, don't be scared. You can do these sort of jobs yourself, even if you have no training, no qualifications. Just watch what the others do, watch what the workers do. Apply it yourself. Six months ago, before we moved into a house, I went and dreamed of doing a job like this. Now, living here, my confidence is much more. I'm much more knowledgeable, much more skilled. And I feel like I'm a lot more capable than I was. So we're ready to go. Why are we driving when it's just at the road? Ashtrain. Because it's coming down below Ashtrain. I think so. So, on our way now to Flamilla Kitchen. Oh, you can eat. Oh, she can eat. Oh, we can eat. So we're here at Flamilla Kitchen. We're sitting outside and we're going to have all you can eat tonight. All you can eat fish, but it's fun. Yeah. All you can eat. Babs, bones, earwax. That crab is going to go up your nose. I'm going to have to go up your nose. I'm going to have to go up your nose. I'm going to have to go up your nose. I'm going to have to go up your nose. I'm going to have to go up your nose. I'm going to have to go up your nose. I'm going to have to go up your nose.
