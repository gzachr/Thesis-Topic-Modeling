Vegan butter cookies. Yeah and we're going to have a picnic on the beach. Sounds fun doesn't it? Yeah. Let's do it. If this is the first video of as you've ever seen welcome. We are British family that moved to the Philippines about three and a half years ago. This is our home where we live by the beach Shaggat Island in the northeast part of Mindanao.

Okay and now we're doing cooking. Yeah. Let's do this. It is extremely hot in the car isn't it story? Yes. It feels like being in the desert but now there's my hair just blowing in the wind. Yeah it's got the air conditioning on but we need to start driving to really cool it down. It's a short drive only about six minutes and hopefully they'll have what we're looking for. What we looking for? Not the good vanilla just vanilla extract. It's a beautiful beautiful day today and very sunny extremely sunny as you can see. Oh my gosh.

There's a happy clouds. It's a white yeah these are the happy clouds but the grey ones are the sad clouds. Anyway it said it's going to be partly cloudy here but in vanilla it's actually a little bit cloudy just in vanilla and I've forgot what it said and how they described it feels a little bit too. How hot can it be on a motorbike? It's getting a breeze isn't it. This way story this way this way we're going to the gas station looks like they're fitting yeah it's the new solar lights. All right this is from the rain yeah they've dug the holes so they can put big lamppost up here so might the streets. Yeah and they're going to put the lamppost up the concrete. Yeah they're going to bolt it onto that. It's going to be strong. They've been putting loads of those holes around the city of Carried Adam even near our house. Yeah they have. And they have kind of like these just big dents in the ground and they have like things that stop you from falling as a whole as you can't see it. So for the first time we knew about them was when we were riding our bus call. Yeah one of our bike roads. Yeah one of our bike rides we saw them and we were like why did they get in and then and then you said that that mommy saw them the day before those bike rides. It's going to be lamppost isn't it?

Can you see my heel just flopping off that? You're growing fast now aren't you? Yeah that's like a baby one isn't it? And this would fit me. It's just bit like Devon. But Devon your cousin Devon?

Oh it's incomplete. I'm going to just wait so we make sure you've got the right money there. Hello. Hello Ma. Thank you. We should complete the story. I actually need some onions. Yes. We've got lots of changes to spare. We've got lots of money there. It's got so much spring in it. It's got so much spring in it. It's a little bit math there. Yeah. How's it you count up in fives? I counted like five times fifteen twenty twenty five thirty and then we counted once. That's a one and then that's a two. I speak to you through all the answers. Good job. Anybody there?

Yeah, let's go back to mum and make some biscuits and have a picture. I mean a picnic on the beach. Let's do that. We're home. Oh you've got someone behind you. Hello Intruder. Hello Intruder. You're sweet doggy. You're going to be massive soon aren't you? You're going to make friends? I'm only first saw them in a case of time. I'm like about where his tummy begins. Yeah they were ever small before weren't they? They grow fast. They're number come cute and happy they are. In about six months they'll be almost full size. Yeah and by the way when Joah and Kohwa are here. We're in a shine. Yeah we're in a shine. That's a normal name but I call that one over there. Kohwa and Joah which is like this brownish dog with some shades. Brown shades in it. Yeah. When Joah is there. Noons is there. Shine comes over. Kohwa comes over and that seems like the puppy pack. Yeah there's always a puppy pack fight isn't there? A puppy. I'm trying to make some vegan butter non butter cookies. Let's do it. I love to make. Hello you beast. Can't you sniff the dogs? I saw Joah. Oh I have a little slim thing. Little beast. All right baking time. Yes. So we're making butterless butter cookies. It sounds weird so butterless butter cookies. Butterless butter cookies. And I also we don't have a piping bag. I'm thinking of something from a zip lock. So I don't know if it will work. We'll find out when we get to that stage. How are you going to make it into a zip lock? Yeah I can see that. I cut a kind of a starish shape into the end. I put some tape around it so it's a bit stronger and we'll see if it works. So let's cut these cookies together. Yeah, so we're gonna put all the ingredients in here afterwards and then close it and then we're just gonna go Swishy, daisy, daisy and then all of the cookies will fall out. So we're all day in story without a set out the ingredients. It's super simple, only four ingredients. White beans or butter beans, almond flour, dates and then this is a vanilla that you've just bought. Those aren't butter beans, there's white beans. Yeah, I know. Yeah, that's what I said, white beans or butter beans. And you might need a helper, like a princess. Leopold is helping us. So all you do is put this half a cup of almond flour, half a cup of dates and one teaspoon of vanilla. You drain the beans and you put it all into a food processor or a blender. Alright, it's all mixed. Time for the parfits. Yes, it's okay for not to make it bigger. So the dough looks like this. Once it's all been blended, it took a while to blend. We've got there in the end, all the dates are blended nicely. If you can't see the difference, it's a tiny hole. Push down and then stop squeezing and then there. There you go. It looks like a tower. Alright, hang on, you're squeezing with the one hand. You're squeezed from the top. Squeeze with this hand. Squeeze, squeeze and then stop and then stop. Okay. Try again. Okay, hold on. Okay. Our piping attempts are done. Some of them look much better than others. But we're going to put them in the oven now for 20 minutes. Oh, that's for the shots. Yeah, not long at all. Cookies are in the oven. See you in 20 minutes. Yes. Bye bye, cookies. Are they going to come to Poppy? Poppy, for goodness sake. She always does that. You're too fast to poppy, you scare them off. I know you just want to play, but take it easy girl. Look, wait for them to come to you. Poppy, it's so strong. You just need to tone it down, Poppy. Tone it down. Take it easy. I know, it's just such a beast. Doggy's cannot handle her. Let them come to you, Poppy. They're coming. You just stay there and they'll come to you. Stay, stay, stay. Let's just say this is the place where the beach is going them off. It's his gear. He's really strong. She doesn't experience it. She doesn't see it. Dog's can't handle it. I want to do it. Now you can go. Come on, come on. The cookies have been cooling and I think they're ready. Sasha is going to bring them down. And story has been requesting a picnic on the beach. The sun is setting nicely on that side of the house. So we've got full shade at the moment. It's lovely, lovely and cool. You would never even know there was a storm here a few days ago. Threatening to turn into a tired food. Now that beautiful, herodistic chargaard has returned. You've managed to bring the cookies as well. They're in the bag. She's setting up a blanket down there. Nice up here. We've been watching these waves turn teal with they break at the top. This one, as they break, you see the teal color up there. Nice. Amazing. Hold on. Sit. Sit. What's up? You think it's a privilege dog. She got first taste. First taste of the butter cookies story, even for you. You set up the picnic. No, sit. They put your face in it. Good girl. Nice sit. What they turned out like, they definitely have the right look. They have the right look. They taste good, but they are not hard at all. They're not like a cookie, like a crispy crunchy cookie. Yeah, they're not like a biscuit. No. I expected them to be a bit more biscuit-y. They're very soft, girl. Yeah. Is she a lot of fat like them? Look, they're so about it. Look at it in his mouth. Oh, it's just pretty good. Sit. Puppy. Who's coming, Puppy? Is it that kid trying to sneak up on us? Ready for us to do your fact of the day? Yeah. Okay, go for it. We do it like this.
