 Hello good morning, welcome back to my vlog. Yeah, today I will just take you along in my basic life, the end of the Philippines. Yeah, but first I will wash some clothes because I haven't done so. The weather wasn't so good so I just skipped that. I will only wash half of it. So I did also the dishes. I will hang the oven and second is inside. This is the other one and the man has some towels all the way. Yeah, and then I will cook breakfast with you. And I will harvest the talong I will make for breakfast. Both with raw, maybe. Oh, we are elsewhere, here. It's a very productive plant at the moment. And another one. So it's 5 o'clock even more. I will leave those two because sometimes I get so fast, so squishy. Oh, squishy, the right word. So I harvest all this. I only saw 5 but it was 7. It's very productive at the moment. A few days ago I already harvest a tree. So we have this 5. And then we are going to do those three for breakfast. And these are the leaves for tomorrow, maybe. Yeah, that's how this works further. I will do that. I will do that. I will do that. I will do that. I will do that. I will do that. Hello. So hard to change my clothes. Otherwise I will get burned. My neck is still in the sun. But I'm almost done. The walls on the top here were so dirty because the water was so low. I cleaned it. Now I cleaned it and it was really much dirt on it. So some of you asked what our water system is. Welcome to our water system. Over there is the pipe where the water folds down. I will show you soon. I will do further here first and clean this up. And we collect rainwater. And that's pretty much it. There will be installed water system from the government in the future. They wanted to do the street first and then after that they wanted to do the water system. But yeah, I don't know what is the update at the moment. Yeah. And that's it. In Times World is raining every three days or every day. It is a very good source of water. But yeah, when it was March April we had to go down often to the river. I linked this video here. I also made the last time we went there this year. I made a video about it. But this was really the last time because the weeds were also growing so high. When we were there the last time we were really afraid of the snakes. But we had to go down because we hadn't had water anymore. Yeah, before that video my husband and helper always went down or the helper with another worker for my indoors. And yeah, they went all the time down but the weeds were so high like in the last video. Everyone was also telling us, be careful with the snakes. And it was really we were running uphill because we were so afraid the snake would come. We were really done after we went up. Yeah. So, yeah, that's it. It was our water tap. It can take a lot of water so it is really okay this time for us five. Yeah. That's it if you have any questions. Please tell them below. I forgot something to say. Yeah, now I will do this further here. So, I'm done now with my house chores. This is done. I totally forgot to wash the towels. But, doesn't matter how I can do that. Next time we will have water again because we have only this of water and I filled up the washing machines. Yeah, washing machines. Yeah. And we need that for now for the toilet and so on. Yeah. And now I will drink water. I'm not that hungry anymore. I was hungry half an hour ago but I wanted to do everything first. And then, yeah, quite time and cook. Yeah, so I will drink water first and then I will get back to you later. Bye bye. This is what I cooked. It's just the eggplants with some okra and beans. Oops, sorry, with beans and what's happening. And yeah, garlic onion tomatoes. Yeah, and some tomatoes paste and some seasoning. Yeah, better. But don't do it in the tube or in the oven. I have big cup. Oh! Hopefully it will not rain. Yeah. Because my laundry is turned outside. Yeah. It is so loud. Simply, um, road is finished. Hey, my husband is back. Look. Look. Look. Yeah, the papa is back. Papa! Papa! Kids are almost there. Oh, they are out of the window. They are all so happy when he is back. So I will come you. What to be brought. Slumber. Yeah, what is that? I have a lot of stuff. Ah! It is already in the head. I have a lot of stuff. You have a pineapple. I have a lot of stuff. Oh! So nice. That was fun. So nice. She's sweet. Mmm. My favorite. I told you last time. Ah, meh! Kakao! Meh! Meh! Meh! It is a great class. We have a little mango flower tomorrow. There are some chicken laboos. So, let's go. Let's go. My daughter wants to go to the bathroom. Let's go. And up. Come here to the base. Oh my goodness. That's the one you want to go to. That is for my sister. That's for you. That is for you. That is for you. They are for the mango float. They are for a little mini cake. You can also have mango float. Mango float. And mango float. I want ice cream. I want a mango float. So good. Yeah, and I want ice cream. So, ice cream. Oh no! I am back. So, I arrested about two or three hours. Oh, I know. I didn't work out. I hung down some clothes already. Here is the laundry. Still. And over there also some t-shirts. Yeah. So, I did a laundry. I did a laundry. I did a workout. It was my... Do you know that? Do you do... Yourself. And my husband is cooking chicken gizzard. I never ate this. What do I do? I don't know if you definitely know. Adore. Yeah. Let's try it. My husband also likes to eat liver. A Thai look. Yeah. Also, Adore style. But, yeah. I don't like it. I never like liver. It wasn't Germany. Back when I was a kid. And my mother made liver. I don't know. I didn't like it. One time I ate liver. At my grandma. And I was so hungry that I just ate it. And then I asked, is it liver? Because it looked like liver. And then I said, yeah, I finally like liver. And then my mother made liver. And I didn't like it anymore. Sometimes even when I look at my husband, but I just don't like the taste. I don't know. So let's see if I like the chicken gizzard. Oh, life tasting. I've already eaten it. Have you tried it? I don't know if you've tried it yet. Let's try it. Let's try it. Let's try it. I can't eat it like this. Oh man. Oh man. It already tasted like liver. Oh man. It's full of teeth. No, I don't feel like it. I have to really count. Or I have to count. I don't know. Stake or the sourm. Yes, but it's very soft. It's different. No. It's not that sweet. It was too chewy for me. I mean, I barely bite into it. Bit into it. But no, it was so like rubber. Like... Huh? Maybe I should rock it at a... ...and I'll skim. Maybe later. Yeah, yeah. Keep your eye out. So I'm cooking my dinner now. Because, yeah, this is gizzard. No, this is not only. I don't know. I... I know I barely bit into it. Let's try another one. I try another one. But it is, I don't know. It has a... It has a weird consistency. I feel it with a fork. But, okay. I will try another time. I will just take a bite. Oh! Oh, I'm full now. Hmm? How is lekhanami? Hmm? Is it okay? Hmm. Sorry. No. It's a consistency. The texture is very good. No. It's a consistency. The taste is not bad. But, the consistency, maybe it has to cook longer here. No, I mean, you know. The taste isn't bad. But... No. I can't stand the consistency. It's so... Do you know what I mean? So, I will cook now tuna seasoning with tomato and onion. Oh! I don't know. I got it. Yeah, that would be by dinner. I will put a bit of tomato paste into it. I just remembered that I wanted to make a okra egg omelet. Hmm. Maybe I will do that also. Tomorrow is my daughter's birthday. Maybe I will show you the food tomorrow. Maybe I will show you the preparations. But, I don't know. Because... I don't want to film so much when it's her birthday. Or any child's birthday. It's about them. And yeah. So, I will cook. And then, thank you for watching. And let's have a good time together in the next video. Bye bye. I'm gonna stay with you tonight.
