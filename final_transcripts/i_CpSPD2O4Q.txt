 Hello guys and welcome to a new video. Today I want to dedicate a video to the topic of how foreigners can move to the Philippines and live here because I get regular questions and private messages about this topic so I thought the best thing I can do is to collect everything I know in one video for you. Also I've been meaning to make an update about this topic because I made a video about four years ago and that's not fully relevant anymore since of course many things have changed plus also I gained more experience since that. So there are three main topics that I will want to go through in this video. The first one is how to get here in general and the different types of visas. The second one is how a foreigner can make a living here in the Philippines and the third one is a more personal one is why I think you should move here to the Philippines or to just give an idea if the life here is for you or not. I chose this day to film this video because I'm going to be going to extend my visa today but it's still early morning so I will just grab a coffee and then we can already talk about the first point. So the first thing of course that we need to talk about is how can someone get here to the Philippines in the first place and luckily it's really easy because most countries are visa free to enter the Philippines and can stay here without a visa for up to 30 days. So you won't need any kind of application, you can just show up and you will be able to stay in the country for 30 days. The only two things that you are going to need is of course a valid passport and a resort or an on-party cat and yes you still need this ticket even if you are planning to stay longer than this 30 day visa free period. So it's pretty easy and straightforward to enter. The only thing at the moment now is that there are extra requirements because of COVID but I don't really want to get into details with that because it's literally changing every week or even every day and I want to have this video to stay relevant for the future too so I will just leave a link in the description box where you can follow up the latest COVID news and requirements. So once you are already in the country luckily it's really easy to extend your stay and get a tourist visa which is a temporary visa. For that you are only going to need a simple application form and photocopy of your passport which I need to get because I don't have a photocopy at the moment so I will go there and then tell you more about this extension there. Really, luckily there are several shops at every corner in the Philippines so it's really easy to get the requirements and basically this is it you will just need to go to the nearest immigration office and like this the first time you arrive to the Philippines you can extend for one month and then later on you can extend for two months or at some offices for six months. This is the easiest way to stay in the Philippines because basically you can be doing this for up to three years so without any requirements you can stay in the Philippines for three years and even after that after you just leave and come back you can start it all over again. So where this is the easiest it's not the cheapest way because the visa fee is different every time you are extending depending on what stage you are at getting your visa it's always somewhere between two thousand pesos to even up to eight thousand pesos but if you can afford that then you get a really easy way to stay in the Philippines without anything special basically. To Palaiyan City to the Noeva Estia immigration office this is where I'm extending lately but there are many offices and I will leave a link to you also in the description box where you can check all of them to pick the clothes as to your location so one thing that I forgot to mention earlier that while this is the easiest way to stay here since there are basically no requirements you will stay in this temporary visitor status so basically you are just a tourist and you have no rights to do work here or to start a business it's just for leisure purposes. If you want to stay here permanently and have more rights then you will need to apply for a permanent visa and there are many different options. I could basically make a whole video I'm just about the different types of long-term visas I will also have link included about this in the description box but the most common types of permanent visas how most foreigners are staying here are either by marriage or there's always a quota visa which is limited to a certain amount of national from each country every year or by retirement where everyone can apply who are 35 years or older and deposit a certain amount of money to a local bank you can also get investors visa for doing business or work visas if you have a work permit on arranged work with some kind of local company and you can also get a citizenship but that's a little bit more of a long-term thing because you have to be staying here for 10 years and on some kind of property or business here or have a permanent job and while getting these visas will grant you a permanent citizenship in the Philippines getting them is not really easy just like in other countries getting these types of visas you will need to go through a whole list of requirements including final show proof and the registered local address plus of course other things each will depend on the specific type of visa you are trying to apply to this is why it's really good that foreigners are allowed to stay here in the Philippines just by extending their tourist visa because by doing this you can just come here see if you really want to live here find a way of earning for yourself and decide what types of visa you will want to apply to later on and the next thing that I will talk about is also going to be related to this continue this video I came to my favorite walking location to have a beautiful background for the things that I want to say and it's also a really good place while doing this for Pixar to walk because she's enjoying it so much so the next topic is the different ways how foreigners have a chance to make a living while staying in the Philippines so of course there's work and jobs but I have to say that there's a reason while the most commonly used visa for foreigners here is the retirement visa and by the biggest on group of expats here are more like the older generation luckily lately partially thanks to COVID it's starting to change a little bit because of the digital on nomad lifestyle there are more younger foreigners who are moving to the Philippines so that's great news but in general it still didn't really change how it's not easy to get a job here as a foreigner adjust regular local companies I often get questions from foreigners who have local partners here and they are asking that will they be able to find a job once they move here to their partners and the answer is that not really there's a really small chance for that it's simply because I think it's the same in many other countries actually here in the Philippines the role is that local companies are not allowed to hire foreigners for jobs that local people could also do in order to hire a foreigner basically they would have to go through a whole long and difficult process which would include providing proof by they need that foreign person to do the job and why can't all of it instead and unfortunately of course most companies won't be able to go through that so yes I would say that it's almost impossible to get hired for a regular job at a local company you can be lucky if your profession is something that is really high in demand and not much locales who are doing the same job I know that there are some very specific IT areas and it can also be if you speak some special languages that most people here in the Philippines don't speak then you can get hired with this special proof of need for a foreigner type of thing but it's a really small amount of people of course who would be able to do this if you still want to work here your best chance is to pre-arrange a job while you are still in your home country there are different kinds of websites that are exactly looking for foreigners for different areas different kinds of jobs especially if that company is not local but based somewhere in the US or somewhere in Europe and they just happen to have a branch in the Philippines that's your best chance but I would definitely recommend finding a job before coming to the Philippines and applying online that will be a shorting and then it will also help with your work permit and you won't have to worry about your visa anymore so yeah if you are planning to get a job then look around first before moving to the Philippines and of course thanks to COVID there's now a new option well it's kind of always been a thing but since COVID it became a lot more popular to live the digital and nomad life with that basically it's not really Philippines related you could live anywhere in the world but luckily a lot of companies realized lately that they don't really need their people to work in a specific office and they are fined with their employees working anywhere in the world I think this is definitely the way to how more younger foreigners are able to move here and I believe that it's one of the best options you have if you want to work while living in the Philippines and this is of course just the work size of things if you feel like that none of these are for you then there's also the opportunity to open your own business here in the Philippines of course doing that requires a capital and there's a whole loads of requirements but it's still easier to do it here than in some western countries definitely easier than it is in my home country in Hungary there are some difficulties because a foreigner can't fully own a business without a partnership of a local person but in the past few years there were some good changes regarding that now even foreigners are allowed to own online businesses 100% on their names so that's making things easier and again thanks to COVID online business are thriving lately so there are many more options than there were like a few years ago but I would say that this is one of your best options if you want to live long term in the Philippines I'm back home guys something happened at that location why I couldn't continue filming there I will make a hoes separate vlog about that but for now back to the topic of this video I was saying that if you got the capital and a good idea for a business then the Philippines is definitely the country for you of course there are rules here too and regulations but the hoes system is more relaxed and the requirements here are definitely easier to complete than it would be in many best-torn countries I also know that there are foreigners living here who get into like real estate but foreigners can only buy like condo type apartments here in the Philippines by themselves if you want to buy like a different types of house or land then only leasing is an option or the same way like with business you have to have a local Filipino citizen who partner up with you and it will have to be on both of your names it can just be 100% yours and the third topic that I wanted to include in this video is more like the personal side of things if you are already considering moving to the Philippines and you can decide if you should do it or not my personal advice would definitely be a big yes and this is why I can of course only speak from personal experience but based on that living in the Philippines will teach you so much and it would be such a shame to miss out on that living here you will meet great people and you will meet with an entirely different like point of view on life the attitude of people regarding everyday things and life in general is just so different from what I'm used to back in Hungary and it's a really like positive experience for me and I've been learning a lot from people here in the Philippines so I would definitely recommend it for everyone else deciding to move here to participate and try to experience that I have a little help for here who is very interested in me filming this video and other deciding factor is that if you want to live somewhere abroad it's not as easy as it sounds like because moving to a foreign country is a huge difference and adjusting might not be easy but the Philippines is a really good country for this and I'm so thankful that the Philippines was my first country where I moved abroad because the people are just so welcoming and I've never ever felt like that I was not one that here people are always nice and curious and helpful with me and it's something that is more important than maybe you would originally think because the whole experience adjusting to a completely different culture is not easy so here in the Philippines is a huge help that locals are so helpful and welcoming to foreigners but still we are already different of course and you will need to be able to decide for yourself if you will be able to adjust to the local lifestyle or no because I could say so many more positive things but at the end the fact that the life here is so different than it is in western countries of course won't change and you will need to be able to decide if you are able to adjust to that or no you will need to know and measure if you are a type of person who is able to easily adjust to new things you will kind of have to be able to have this go with the flow attitude in many situations you have to be okay with it that life here is more slow and relaxed which for me is a big positive factor but for other type of personalities it might be something that is negative and of course in general if you have a more difficult time adapting to new things then maybe life here is not that much for you but personally if you are already deciding then I would definitely give it a go and try at the end of the day the best way to decide will be of course by coming here and spending some time here and then deciding after this is why this visa extension option is great for foreigners but I think I mentioned everything that I wanted to talk about if you have further questions then please write it in the comment section and then we can discuss it further but yet this is all for today thank you thank you so much for watching I hope you like this video if you did then please subscribe next time I will be back with a vlog and yes this is all thank you and
