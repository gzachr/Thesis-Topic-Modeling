 We are the midnight! Yay! We did it finally! I'm so curious about this town. We look like all the town. Oh, look at this! You have a couch. I think they have smart TV so we've been working Netflix here and we have a living in the view. Love it! Love it! Oh, I'm going to text my Airbnb host, like straight away that we love it. It's really pretty. There's a swimming pool there. The eye is afraid of heights. I'm really, oh, I freak out these things. You notice, I'm just breathed feeling that if I'm sleeping, that I can go sleepwalking and that I can fall off. That's what is going on in my mind. It's so weird. But for now, we're not going to chill here. We're going to go explore with Manila. We ended up taking a grab because we're still figuring out how the public transport work is not easy to crack down the secret code but we will try our best. And now we're sitting in a really lovely taxi. Look at this! Here we are in the beauty. So here we are and wow, this area here in Nakati, Nakati City and all the malls and it's closed for a minute. It's so big and luxury and we haven't been inside yet but I think most people are so impressive. First impression of Manila, 10 out of 10. So now here we are in the journey. The first thing we try in the Philippines and let's see if we can do this. If you don't know, we are vegetarian so we cannot find anything which is a vegetarian in the menu. So I don't give up yet. I don't give up. I think we end up with something sweet but it looks really delicious. Everything. It reminds me of my KFC days. KFC, you know, I've never had KFC, I've never had the chicken, crispy thing, never. You missed out. Yeah. We found something to order. And one show called Melo by... Can we get the order of it to Robos? We found something which is serious. No, there's more coming but I asked her can it come with the robots and she said yeah, it's possible so no. Super exciting. We're waiting for the robots. We have got this and this would help the robot to locate us. Yeah, you put it there. What is the name of the robot? Jolly Bought. Jolly Bought. Jolly Bought. I think it will surprise me if it is Jolly Bought. But for people who don't know Jolly Bought is a Filipino, fast food chain and it's huge. I think there are 1500 locations around the world. And here in the Philippines we are just here. We just arrived and we see it on every corner, every corner and it always affects me people. So I think this is promising. Woo! Woo! Did that try? Yeah. It smells really good. What is it by that? It's turkey. It's chocolate and marshmallow. No, really no joking. It's really, really good. Maybe she'll take one more. Yeah. Woo! The marshmallow goes down there. It's so amazing food. And you're me out here. It's so amazing. Enjoy our meal. I'm so happy. Woo! Here's the meal. You take your tray. Okay. You have to give this back? Yeah, I will give this all to that. To that. Oh! Thank you. Bye! Bye! It's so exciting. It's so good. And look what we have. We got some fries. Here's the sauce, people. Okay, you fry it with that sauce. Is it maybe some of the free... I did see that. Oh. Oh. It's good. I'm not trying to brag, but this is one of the best, but it's a fries we have had. I have had, personally. No. I'm wondering how the chicken would be. I think we just cannot stop thinking about the chicken. Let us know in the comments. Are we missing out? The pandemic can still maybe go on then. Yeah, we did. We didn't leave. We didn't leave. We didn't. It was a big, big success, even as a vegetarian. We will come back. So what you see in my bag, the famous jibmy, that is how we wanted to move around. But it's really hard to figure out from where to where they go. So until now we just used grab it. We really want to use these ones as well. All the places, whatever we are seeing so far, looks super modern, super nice and clean. And of course, we haven't told you yet, but the Filipino people are one of the most friendliest people we have ever met. And the good part is everybody just speaks really good English. I don't know if it's just in the big cities, but we are so surprised and then it's so easy to communicate with locals. That is so cool. Because we couldn't eat anything in Jollybee except for fries and a few other things, now we go to a vegan restaurant. Yes, we found it in Manila. The shake is so big, meers trying to hide behind it. Oh, if you don't know me yet, I love sweet things. And they have a vegan milkshake here. Vegan oil milkshake. It's like when we're just... Oh, nice. But we also want a normal food, so we're not just dessert. A few of us have a guess. This is nice. I'm ready to go. Look at this. It looks so nice. It's almost a Jollybee burger. Is it going to eat it? Oh, really nice. Two seconds later, the food was very nice and now we go for supermarket. First time going to supermarket in Philippines and let's see what all things we can find. It's super market looks amazing. Look at all the fruits behind me. It's a bit sad that everything is packed and plastic, but I think it's because they want to extend the... You know how long we can keep it. Wow, I'm excited. It's so cool to go in foreign supermarkets. I really love it. I've never seen such a creatively decorated vegetarian food section in my life. Oh, yeah. I almost find your own. Really? Wow. I think we found the local stock. local, up a sheep. He is bigger. Look how they affect the beans. Crazy. You guys would have no idea what we just found in Manila supermarket. Crazy. Vegan eats. It's crazy. You know when we started traveling, we thought that the Philippines would be the most difficult with vegetarian food. We are just one day here and we already found so much vegan and vegetarian food. Amazing. So we move here? Yeah. I love it. It's my one of my favorite drinks until now. So the toughest part of Miras Day, which of let's you choose for tonight? Yeah. I love tropicals. I love tropicals. And it's really hard to find dark triplets, but here they have all dark triplets, 74%. We are moving to the Philippines now. I think we need more. Let's go. More Miras. Let's go. How are you going to take those? How much do you think Miras is going to be? We have a lot. Normally I'm counting, but I lost track. I don't know, maybe 50 euros? The translation even is a bit stupid. 40 euros for sure. I think I would, I think 50 euros. Yeah, maybe. Let's see. So this is our second day in Manila. Yesterday our plan was to go after groceries to some really cool hotel here in Manila. But we a little bit underestimated how long it takes to go from A to B. So we decided to do that today. But we just did something else here in Isra Moulos and you will see that in a different video. But now we're still going to this beautiful hotel. And we are calling a scooter taxi. What is the name of that, Miras? Maxim, we figured out just when we came to Manila. Maximab, if you're new here, because the taxi can be really expensive. And Maxim, it's a little bit reasonable. And they are pretty safe. Miras is the person who would not ride with anybody on scooter. Except me. I felt super safe, otherwise I wouldn't search for another one now. But I don't understand. Interimable skate, yeah. So what happened to our scooter ride? It was just impossible to find. And we found a grab and it goes to one hour to get here. And I just woke up. I should might see. I had a little bone in my car. But we are here at all the first impressions I can see. Oh, that's very beautiful. I'm in pink heaven. Look at this. What is it? What does it look like? It looks like a jewelry. Yeah. First place, Miras thought of going to a pastry shop. It looks nice. Oh, but I have to see what they have. It looks a bit like this knee-land. I was thinking, like, oh, girlie, the princess. Princess Rose. I think later you'll try a macaron. I think we have Jipney made of my carones. And chocolate. Oh, I want to eat it. I really need you to go take some pastry here. So keep watching. What we're deciding to take. We've been in crazy hotels around the world, but this one is the most crazy. I have no idea it's like this. No. Oh, you're level three. Welcome to the ballroom. Because of dancing and turkey. There's a little ticket. There's actually a ball. There are people with really nice, god-addresses. So if you're a little bit underdressed now. But you're on our way to a swimming pool. It almost looks like we are entering the hotel lobby. And we are almost going to our room. Yeah, like we just walked. We just attempted resting. No, but even people who are not staying here, they are really welcome. They just all go to the third floor. It's pretty cool going in here. Mira is actually checking how much it would cost us to book a night. Mama's convince to stay here. You know, should I tell you a secret? Yeah. We actually booked a one night in this hotel. And then we canceled it. Yeah, and it was really not that expensive. Because I booked really four-handed fonts. But then we thought that our plans were changing. But it didn't change. So we could have stayed here. I think now it would be insane expensive. And this is the reason why I wanted to go here on the first day. I felt like I would not stay here anymore, but I still want to see it. And then maybe we even enjoyed it. Or now I guess the instant work. You're enjoying the full service. Maybe we can also get some free breakfast later. Yeah, we can. You imagine it. Oh. As you can tell, it is just straight out of your dream. It looks like a big cruise ship parked behind us. I think it is a full-armed cruise ship. Yeah, it could be. Oh, it's huge. And that side it just goes forever. Oh, even if you're not staying here, we would really recommend to come here for a tour. It is just impressive. And it's like compared to European prices. It's really not that expensive. You get kind of okay hotels in peak season for this price. What you get here. Yeah, like in Europe. Yeah, in Europe. I think I will read it so much. We can still do it. Next time. Next time. Should we go to the VIP car park? VIP car park. We don't have a car and we are not VIP. And I think YouTube is really big here because everyone who meet, everyone who we meet, they're always asking, are you a vlogger? Have you got a silver play button? Have you got this? So if you haven't subscribed, subscribe. And yeah, it's like first time it's happening to us that every time people are just asking, are you a vlogger? What's your channel name? Let me subscribe to you. And this is right. It's so cool. People are not shy here and it is so amazing because you can have proper conversation. Yeah, exactly. And it's so, yeah. So let me turn orange. We are in a red light district now. Red light district of this hotel. Red light district of this hotel. Car park. Go back. Go back. Go back. I don't know where we ended up but it's like a full on boulevard. It feels like a boulevard, you know. This is long straight. We don't even know if this is the part of the hotel. I think we are still in the hotel. So confused. But it's so impressive. Like, oh, it's insane. Yeah, we are. It's the best sighting thing in Manila, Brody. Exactly. You are being Manila or are you in a Disney line? We are in Japan. It is. It arrives in Japan and see all the cherry blossoms arrives. It seems like in Japan. Oh, it's in? It's so cool. Yeah. You are everything here? Maybe. You afraid me? At least in early birth, they present? Yeah. I already get something else from Addy. I got something. And look at all. Woo, so excited. I'm trying. Well. I'm going to get something else from Addy. I got something. And look at all. Woo, so excited. I'm trying. Yeah. Hmm? I'm trying. Hmm. Hmm. I'm trying. Hmm.
