 In today's video we try Filipino foods and some things take an unexpected turn. Watch the whole thing. We're finally here. I'll be right back with it. It's time guys. All right. Let's please. Let me move your hair for you guys. We're at the park and we're going to eat the food now. I'm excited to hollow hollows down there. Everything else is here. You guys will see. Let's get over to the bench. All right. All right. It's time. Got hollow hollow here. Now I know what you're all thinking. Gabe, you looked kind of sad right there. Well, this is where it gets interesting. You see, I was hearing something in the background and before this footage started, there was two homeless men who came by our table talking. They sounded a bit weird. But we let it be. In this footage we'll about to see some things get serious. Yeah, I'm out there. I'm in part of this. After that, I left and have no idea what's happened after. Hopefully, it was all just talk. All right, guys. We just got home and I mean, that was an experience. But I'm ready now to finally try some foods. There's so many here and obviously you've already seen. But I'm just going to grab and I'm going to be honest with you. First thing, I'm going to try right here. Just to get a closer look for you. Just take a look at that. I mean, come on now. And I'm pretty sure this is called Bunsit Gundon, which you guys told me, please, please get. And I guess what I did. And I'm excited. Also, you guys said the lemons. Make sure to squeeze. I'll onto it. Am I excited? Yes. Let's please. I'm going to show you guys two of me squeezing the lemon on there. Look at that. Look. Oh. I see your job chattering. All right. Put some here. Wait. I literally just thought I was going to be like normal, low-main. But there's a flavor in here that is. Yo. What have you done? Knucks. You have created addicts. Wait, one more bite, man. One more. Just, you know, that is like a 10. There's definitely chicken broth in there or something. Has the texture of the spicy noodles without a spice. You know the thickness of those noodles. All righty. Now, next up, I'm still thinking about the noodles. Oh, wow. Look at the pork rolls, guys. Yeah, these are called lump young, shing, uh, shing, high pork rolls. And oh, what a paper. I love me some crunchy things. Oh, what does that sauce to his orange? It looks like sweet sweet sweet sour sauce, maybe. Oh, yo, uh, one of them told me that they love like vinegar. Oh, so it's probably, it smells like strong vinegar. All right, you ready? I'm scared. Wait a minute. Oh. I think I'm going to have to go. Maybe I'm going to dance a little. Has little sweetness to it too. What is that sauce? Ginger. Oh, this thing is actually incredible. I can't. Bro! I expected it to be kind of similar to things I've tried in my culture as well, but no, it's something like anything I've really tried genuinely. I thought there would be similarities, but these are actually like, just a different sauce adds on to it so much. Like, have you tried anything like this before? No. Wow. That was a lot. That was incredible. On this one? Yeah. That might even be better than the noodles for me. All right, so next up, guys, now this one is a basic one. It's okay. This is garlic rice and, uh, garlic smells like popcorn a little too. Look at that. Her closer view to for you. Oh, my. All right, let's eat. And she loves rice a lot, especially me. Mm. Okay. Yeah, this is good. Here's the thing. Here's the thing, guys. Brazilians love rice. We already have stuff like this. I mean, she, um, when she eats our rice, she like, uh, she loves it first of all, because my grandma loves to put garlic in it. It's just a known thing. So this isn't too like crazy for me, because I've tried this before. Like full on garlic rice, but it does have a little difference to it. Way more garlicy. And that's because, um, these type of foods you guys have told me that it's a very vinegar, very, uh, garlicy. And I love that first of all. You love, you love like sour, and you love garlic. You love spice. Wow. Dude, you can mix this in the rest of the other food. The chicken, uh, a dobo. That's what you're supposed to mix it with. I'm eating it with that. Um, all right. We're gonna put this right here, actually. Next is these right here. It's openness. I'm scared. It's like, feel to the brim. Let's open it there right here. Oh, my. Baby, you don't eat those. You don't eat those, by the way. Oh, my God. This is your style. It smells like soy sauce. Something. Um, just take a look at that, y'all. Yo. Get off. So I'm gonna put this, I'm gonna eat one by itself and then eat it with the rice. You don't like it? I do. What is this? Skin. Give me. Give me. She doesn't like skin off chicken. I do. Yo. Sour? Ooh, the skin was even more soury. Of course. I think it's soaking in it. Oh my God. Wow. All right. Ooh, there's a little spice. No. Ooh, I brought the giant. My family is well. No. All right. Now, we're gonna do this. Blast. All right. So, just grab yourself a piece like this. So mine is like this. Oh yeah. Mm-hmm. Yup. Mm-hmm. Oh wow. The garlic rice and the uh the other words, it's chicken adobo. I'm sorry if I didn't pronounce it right. But it's also said to be adobong monok. Hopefully I pronounce that right. Hopefully I pronounce that right. But oh my goodness. So far, everything's been really a 10 out of 10. Like, this chicken as well is something I've never tasted. But for some reason, its style reminds me of my grandma in the way that she cooks. And I'm sure you can agree with that. But it's not, it's not her, but I'm saying it's like the style. But this I've never tasted something like this before the sauce. But the style of it? The style of it though is like my grandma. And I love it. Everything has been 10 out of 10. And now, guys. Letcha flan. Take a lucky look. Matter of fact, let me open it. What am I doing? Yeah, go ahead and dump that chicken in the garlic rice. Because we're going to eat all of it right after this. Leche flan. Here's a better view for y'all. Oh, it looks like a giant caterpillar. Half of his body. All right. Oh my. Chicken. Now it's time to try this. I love flan. By the way, it's one of my favorite things. One of my most favorite desserts of all time. She doesn't really like Leche flan. She doesn't like. I liked it on the hot floor. Yeah, she doesn't like cheesecake, she doesn't like stuff like that. She's at all doesn't like cheesecake. Doesn't like flan. I love all of them. But the idea is, one of my favorite desserts. It's not that I don't like him. It's OK, it's not that I don't like him. It's just, I'm not I haven't eaten in enough to know. So I've just been like... Hmm. I'm not sure if I'm gonna eat you. Alright. I already know I'm gonna like it. It's flan. Ready? Yeah. Mmm. That's really good. What? Almost a taste of brigadeiro. Yeah, it has um... I know it has heavy or condensed milk in there. Oh my. Like caramel. That's what that is up top. The caramel is just sugary. Hey. I want that on top. Oh man. I'm a texture person. You don't like a texture? I like the taste. I love it. Very vanilla. It's okay. More for me though. It has to be one of my favorites. And also... Hello, hello. It was incredible. I'm gonna basically show y'all me eating hello, hello. In the car. It's just gonna be after this because I felt like it makes more sense. It's better than me just eating it than randomly getting my home. So I'm gonna show you the clip of me eating it in the car. Yeah, guys, a lot happened. Obviously, I don't know if you guys get here in the video, but... Some homeless dudes were arguing. Talk about each other. I hate to make this video like this. But what we're gonna do is we're gonna record the rest of this video at home. But we're gonna eat the hollow hollow right now. We're about to just try that. And then the rest of the food will try at home. But I don't know. I'm sorry, guys. This is so bad. But let's try. It's hollow, hollow. Alright, so the hollow hollow comes in here like this. And... Giant. First of all. So maybe we can open it right here. That's... What? Oh my goodness. Wow. I'm gonna grab a little bit of the flan and look at the jelly beans. I don't know what they are. Oh my God. Who thought that the red beans would be good? Wait. What is in it? It's like corn. Shave dyes. Mmm. That be all God. The jelly. Mmm. Jelly beans. I'm pretty sure. Because I'm just gonna let me know exactly. But it's a fruit or something. I genuinely have never tasted anything like this in my life, guys. I don't even know how to explain it. The different textures. It's like so many things are happening at the same time. I'm crunching. I'm sugging. I'm doing everything about... We're gonna finish this up. Bam. Climbing me eating it in the car was after I, uh... You know, left the two crazy people at the park that were, you know, about to get violent. Yeah. And we tried it in the car after. Because we were scared it was gonna melt by the time I got home. Like I said, it was like an hour away. And I didn't want it to melt when I got here. And it was already melting anyways. But yeah, hollow hollow was pretty good. Uh, she liked it too. But she's like she said a texture person. So she kind of felt iffy about it afterwards. Because she kept eating and we both were eating it on the way home after we tried it for the video. And I loved it. I just kept loving it. But her being a texture person, she started feeling way too many textures. And didn't really like it. That's cool. The one thing that did surprise me though is the corn. Oh yeah, and the bean in it too. The corn was really good and the bean, yeah, sweet. I thought it wasn't gonna, like, go good together, but actually added to it and made it really good. Yeah, that was incredible. Genuinely, I'm sure there's like lots of more foods that you guys would love for me to try. And just let me know it also. Thank you. Thank you so, so, so much for watching. I really do appreciate it. Hey, if you liked it, leave a like. If you loved it, subscribe. If you want more, let me know down in the comments below. And yeah, till next time, guys. Peace.
