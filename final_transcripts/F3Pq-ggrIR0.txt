I was just kidding. I was just kidding. No. It's not. But it is. I didn't know that she was... I didn't know that she was... I didn't know that she was... Pushing. What's her name? What movie is this? It's Hawkeye The Series. Okay, don't worry. Seriously? Can you crank the neck by Nick Fury? Probably the coolest thing that ever happened to me anyway. And it's pretty cool. I think he can relate to this movie with us even a scene where he... where Pita is at his thinking of family's love house. What's up? The proud. Today's video episode, when we were talking about our friends, they were in the middle of the Marvel world. Before we start, subscribe to the channel to be updated with our proud Filipino moments video. Okay, this video is... No, no! Filipino. It's Jacob Buffalo. Okay, here we go. We have the name. We will start with the best friendless fighter of the Sydney Lines. Jacob Buffalo was born on October 1996 in Hawaii. He was born in the early days. He was so young. I was born in the early days. This might sound like a really American. But I really love Filipino culture. Where is this? Over there? Over there. I always know it was like a beautiful country. I just think I just never had the opportunity to come back. That's it. This was the connection between Jacob and us today. We are the Filipino Filipinos of Hollywood. Let's go to dinner. TIE, Ned, want to tie? No, he's got a thing. The thing to do after... Okay. Hey, we're on surprise. What is the difference between the two of us and Jacob? We were able to see him on the TV and he was very interested in the show. After the work, three months, after the work, he was put on the Hollywood show. And then one of the... I had to make it in Hollywood, that's just... I was just passing by in the school of arts and acting in New York. So I was able to do it for two years. Jacob's Filipino was not the only one who was able to do it. He's eating joyfully. He's eating food. Rice is life. Oh, Christmas. We are the wastefimry. Ooh, a synagogue. Good choice. Love it. It tastes like a... No, put it or something else, isn't it? Let me get you a real bite. Okay. Right? You're gonna have like a whole... You're gonna have like a flame with it. Everything. So, Pami saw, right? This is Pami saw with Kessah Di Vola, They only really sell during Christmas. Amazing. That's like the cheese thing, right? Yeah. Wow. That cheese is like really strong. Really? Yeah. I feel like I'm gonna need like a breathman after that. The name of Pande Sal, next level is the name of our fan. This is the name of the self-defense of MJ, in Spider-Man, No Way Home. And he's not a fan of his. But, he's not a fan of Spider-Man. We're gonna have to pay attention to this superhero. You're right. If you're not a fan of his, then you're gonna have to be a fan of his. Yeah. And you're right. I want to show you how he's doing. He's just a fan of his. He's not a fan of his. If you could clean up the webs, you can just shut it. Oh, sorry, though. Yes, of course. Oh, no. I'm not. Right, no. Not that son of a bitch is easy to say. But, go to Heaven. I'm sorry. You want to light up everything up? What. When he makeup, Reload of Ã‰siki Lee, on this next level are getting his skin skin eran.. Right. How Hillarywheat advised him. Elisdramatic. Her skin was like this all the time... about 10 times. Look out,lyn. Look out, are gay women covering payings. Sadder, 35 times. But, almost 90 times, she's stillmt a girlfriend of 08. She's a freely skinny woman, Wassera Giovanni Dito, and Sabili Pinas Cuconello I don't even know all of what it consisted of because it was just I got everything I could get my hands on. But unfortunately, don't speak any too loud. Mm-hmm, at home. Not yet. That's right. I'm never too late. Salamah. She was also a resident of the new house in Hollywood because she didn't see her own Filipino. She was not in the air in their blood. She was very proud. To this day, going to the Philippines, one of the most memorable experiences I've ever had in my career. So I would love to go back and yeah, if there's ever a part, I would love to put it. I can't help, I can't, I can't, I can't. I'm just trying to put it in my pocket. She was also a part of the crowd-filippine who represented us in Marble. We were also there to see the camera and we were also there in Marble Comics. In the movie, Mati Uli Bati was the director of the film of Marble Movie, Iron Man 1 and Iron Man 2. I heard about him. He was also the actor of the actor Robert Downey Jr. It was a time when things weren't so good in the Philippines. Walking to school with some friends, we saw that body and it was very traumatic. The comic book became my outlet to see the world being saved by heroes. I was also there in Anfrey, Francisco. The visual artist was a new concept for my group and the female warrior costume concept of Black Panther. He was the first to show his talent in the movie. I was very very happy. In the Philippines, we have a lot of people fighting against colonialism. The first thing that came to my mind from my inspiration was the Igarot's Laifu Gau. Remember the Igarot having the little sash that comes down in how that's used? We met Ifugawa as well, right? That's so interesting that the Ifugawa are inspiration for those uniforms and then also part of an endgame was formed in the Philippines. Maraming Salamat, Sapanu No Oda, Sigura, Dovi, Nekasabskri, Ganapara, Update, and Gasa Shunod, nothing proud. I think this guy missed a few others. This is somebody from the Guardians of the Galaxy. Yeah, John, John Partista I think is half Filipino, half Filipino, the big guy from the Galaxy. And this is a few more. Yeah, I think so. I have to look deeper into this because there are some missing points. If you know some, let us know in the comments down below. I think we reacted to one, that was a different movie, that was not Marvel, right? No, that was not Marvel. Anyway, if you know who the other Filipino actors are in the Marvel Universe, please let us know in the comments down below. If you enjoyed today's video, give it a thumbs up and we'll see you next time. Moro. Yes. What's up, Philippines? Bye.
