 Good morning guys and welcome back to another video so as you can probably see and here I am still extremely ill Matt is in the corner there he's also extremely ill we've both got pan and headaches probably food poisoning and it's still with us today which meant that we couldn't actually go on our bus to Baguio City we're going to have to reorganize that for hopefully tomorrow we do actually have to check out of our Airbnb apartment today luckily we've been given an extension so I'm currently just packing everything up now we need neither of us have any energy but we are moving into a new apartment in the same building hopefully we can get a little bit better I've just got these to pack away now and it's almost spotless just a few things that we've got to put away and we are all packed up ready to go down to the lobby so I think we got a two hour wait until our next Airbnb host meets us and then we can check in but it has been a lovely stay at the night's bridge residence to check back into the night's bridge residence any final words Molly can I go back to bed I'm going back to bed see I've been a fantastic stay apart from the food poisoning off we go and we are in the lobby you can have some more mountain jubilee's one has been a 7-11 got mountain jubilee still feeling really really rough we checking in like two hours I think to our next department luckily obviously it's in the same building we just need to get the bed there was no way we could have got to bust a baguio this evening hopefully we better tomorrow if not the next day and then we can head up now welcome to our crib number two right what have we got oh it's nice it's always zoomed in a bit I've got a nice little table I like that cooking facilities look good shiny look shiny gold wallpaper I like the mirrors everywhere it's a little square things really cool same we look really bad today bigger TV nice bed little workspace here oh the balcony view is really good shame the pool is not in use I think all we're really going to be using is the bed though yeah to be honest I think this vlog is going to be a lot of us laying in bed watching Netflix ground of 7-11 getting power aides Lucas aides whatever gives me a bit of energy so we can recover and hopefully get this bust tomorrow but I still really don't know and we are back up we have slept nearly all the day is now let me check 10 past eight if you can see that we got injured like two so I've been sleeping on and off for about six hours we may as opposed to vlog I do not know how again it wasn't the best quality of vlog we know but we want to show you what we're actually doing we're on the like pretend and fake it this is literally what we're doing we're not well so we're sleeping but I think I'm going to put a little poll on Instagram in a minute try and make this a little bit more exciting we're going to try and answer a few of your questions before we go back to bed and hopefully head to baggyo tomorrow hi guys I'm back from the dead as I suppose you could say I still look like death I still feel like it as well but I'm finally managed to sit up just about that did go to 7-11 for me got a bit in the room now I mean more time apparently it's full of that that is making me feel really better but I put a poll on our Instagram whilst I was laying in bed feeling sorry for myself sorry it's just not the table and I'm sorry I don't think we love that it's my time and so we've got some questions and we're going to answer your questions this is about as exciting as it gets today but like like I said we want it to be a daily vlog of what we actually do this is like yeah we don't want it just to be like I'm not everything's amazing if we feel ill yeah you know we're going to be ill if we're loving life you're going to know we're loving like you keep not I'm sorry we're very true people so at the end of the day if we're sitting in bed doing nothing we're going to show you we're sitting in bed doing nothing but the first question it's going to be like quick answers I think I don't even know how long the vlog is so far there hasn't been much that we've filmed so much to extend this a little bit we'll see so the first question is is it because of the 7-11 cystic that made you sick and we did I don't think we ate enough of that to make us ill yeah two is good but I think it's the hot dog from 7-7-7-7 possibly a hot dog from 7-11 I also cooked that was from Ipswich I don't think it was the 7-11 person the cystic it could be the hot dog I think it could also be the salami that I cooked because it didn't have a salabide or used by day it could be that but we don't know it could be the weather it could be anything I don't care I just want to feel better we just want to feel better what it was we just want to feel better and second question is from Ray underscore Raykin I hope I'm saying all these names right and any plans on staying in the Philippines as your home base well we're sort of taking it as it comes aren't we we're staying till like just we're flying home for Christmas and then we have said and planned that we want to come in January and maybe get an apartment in Manila for a year but that sort of depends how I don't know how this experience goes again this time and how things are at home so there's a good chance it will be here in January for a year so I guess then you could potentially call it your home I don't know we've got to see we everything sort of like he said every day we're taking as it comes and we'll plan as a one we need to plan won't we this one's a really good question actually and it's from lorden dot clear and what is something you dislike about the Philippines that's quite hard because there aren't many things that have really gone wrong in the Philippines as such um can I say 7 11 cc don't get 7 11 cc I can't even hear it can't even hear it can't even hear it no you know what I'll be honest um I suppose like when you go to certain provinces and things like that or anywhere in general it's a lot in Southeast Asia it's like stray dogs like we said we'd like to be able to try and help the stray dogs but like how would we do that like I don't know how you go about it I think it's something that needs to be done over such a long period of time across across southeast Asia it's not saying us to and it's not even initially in the Philippines because you can even see now around like where we stand century city there's a lot of signs up now saying how people are coming out and helping the cats feeding the cats at certain times given the the cats vaccinations so this is obviously happening with the dogs as well so the Philippines have got a plan in action which is really good to see so it's not even really a bad point because it's actually been dealt with it would be more like on the islands and the provinces where I suppose they they are proper stray dogs and there isn't that that helped therefore then only because we miss our little doggy so much that's a map to a dog honestly in January right now don't underscore h20s has you guys ever visited Australia or is it in your plans now yes we visited Australia when we went traveling a few months ago earlier this year we were in Australia and we might have put one video up one video but we sort of like fell behind and it because it was more traveling we didn't focus on getting the videos up but we have been we went to Sydney and the gold coast but yeah we do plan to go again at some point don't we yeah Australia's lovely it's like a hotter better England yeah hotter better England I think that's the best thing that you can say someone says have you been to Davao city that's bad ood 218 I don't know if I said that right Davao Davao Davao Davao Davao Davao Davao just say we got told to like break it up yeah or Davao I don't know but yeah we do plan to go to at some point we're not sure whether it be in this period of time or not to answer your question no we haven't been but we haven't been the plan is to go at some point we've got big plans this time yeah there's so many places and we're open to places that's why we haven't booked things specifically because like you guys know best you can tell us where to go and then we'll just go there within reason yeah last one one one last one I think we got to how long how long has been filming this bit oh yeah five and I don't know how much you filmed earlier we can get one out two more and so the last question is from G Hadley is there any chance that you will stay for good there in the Philippines similar to one of the other questions about making it our home base and I'm a bit of a home bird so whether I could stay anywhere in the world for good is difficult for me with my little doggy's as well and my mom and dad I don't know I would I like it I like being away but I think we could find like something in between maybe doing like it's hard because obviously you need to have a job at home and work when you come away um but the ideal maybe do like somewhere in the UK somewhere in the Philippines yeah hold all year round but I don't maybe for a few years like that and then we'd see like we could potentially if we do a year here and it goes well then why wouldn't we do another year so it's sort of like we see there's things going we've made no plans we've not even really even thought about it I don't think it's good to have too many plans because anything can happen like that's why even up to going to Baguio I'd book the hotel but had a free cancellation like if I'd already paid for that we would have had to go and had to sit on a bus rough or lose all your money so don't plan too far ahead when traveling because you never know what's going to happen you might be in a place and not like it or be in a place and you really want to like you really like it I'm gonna stay longer that's one thing we learned last time when we were away was that we had everything books pretty much in advance and we had to do it regardless if we were in somewhere we didn't like we noticed some of the places we were in way too long some of the places we weren't in long at all so we're doing that differently this time but yeah that's all the questions I think yeah yeah thank you for your questions I hope that answers some of them quite well we apologize for the boring video in advance they're not normally like this if you're new to the channel please hit that subscribe we'll be traveling soon as soon as our belly is a better yeah so fingers cross we go tomorrow hopefully if not we will do something exciting tomorrow night we'll make sure we go out just something we've got lined up in my life we'll stay for more day but we'll be heading off very very soon so if you're new to the channel hit that subscribe drop us a like and keep on doubling I'm gonna go to my cousin it won't be a hundred I don't know
