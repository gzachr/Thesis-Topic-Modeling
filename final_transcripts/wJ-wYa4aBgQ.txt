 What do you do with that? Ah! So it's a craze-gum line for prime. A drink called prime, who needs it? When you've got this. I'm not sure whose caves these are, but he's going to find it in the province. It's a lot of things like this, a lot of nature. It's a nice day, not a drop of rain. There's a lot of water out here though. That's someone's pipes leaking. No, it's not ours. We don't think. Our pressure is slightly lower than usual, but it doesn't seem to be any of our pipes that are split. The stuff we do is come with me. Here you go. Nice to see you alone. I've been to Christmas, gone to the mall, put it a bit shopping. It's new year tomorrow. We're going to go to the market, but it's so busy. It's been a year tomorrow. New year's eve tomorrow. Very busy in the mall and the market. There are busy things, but they have a thing on the map. It's a busy new one. Everyone is busy, so I'm shopping. Dream fans are something fresh. Got my sugar. Everyone's looking for their 12 round fruit for tomorrow. So you got your fruit for the summer version. So four seasons, 89 paid so. So you can refresh in. It's your mine? Choe pow. Choe pow from Maillon. Maillon's big shop. And the regular cheeseburger. It's never good to shop on an empty stomach. It's tender by stuff you didn't really want. It looks nice at the time. Always best to eat for your shop. This isn't the best, isn't the healthiest, but it's a nice snack. Next year, it's really much healthier. It's much better diet. Much bigger improvement to everything. She says, Devao in the shoe powder. What you pay for is, it's gone out, hasn't it? It used to be 30 last year. Then anything that's been found. That's extra. Oh dear. Alright, it's my powder. It's for Dixie now. James Bion from Asuki. One of our Suki's. We're in the wrong goal, you know, then the road. Just buy him some fruit for tomorrow. It's very traditional to have 12 round fruit. A different variety is all displayed. To bring good luck and prosperity for the upcoming year. Darling, can you give me your 15 pieces? Or 50, I will buy some banana. Cue. Camote, Cue. No, not Camote. Banana. Sapau. Sapau, Cue. Sagin. I was sagin, yeah, of course. Salamat Paul. Salamat, Salamat Paul. Salamat Paul. It's my wife. Hey. Malangaban. Malangaban. I'm trying to read what it says. A clan, grand reunion and sports fest 2022. I'm going to Luna. Don't like the look of these clouds coming over. They're dark. They strange the weather here. One minute. You have a day that looks quite nice. And the next minute. Not so good. Better change it quickly. Get cookie. Get your good boy. New year soon. These beds we've made. Nothing's grown just yet. There's a few things coming through. But we're going to redo them. It's the soil mix. It just wasn't very good quality in these bags. Either cookie's done that or a homer or that. So what we're going to need to do is we think the design a little bit. It's something to stop the soil to escape in. Stop the creatures and the critters. Getting in there. That like cookie dude. This one here though. This is kale. Gene used to have kale quite often. And this is kale. So very glad that this is growing. This seems quite easy to grow. That is not kale. That would become vice if we left that. A typical average day here in the province in the Philippines. New Year's Eve tomorrow. We're getting ready for it now. Got a few things. We're going to prepare as usual. Be looking forward to it. You got the attack? What can you do with that? Never make a filipina angry part too. No she's got an attack. She's got a machete. It's winning hard. It's New Year's day of us well. We're going to fall off. Oh my god. So these are coconuts from the mountain the other day. Your aunt Aden Chu from her coconut farm? Yeah. She gave me a slight thing. They're coconuts. We only took five. The young coconut is already fresh to be cleaned. It's not that bad. The young coconut is fresh to be cleaned. It's not that bad. That's not that bad. The young coconut is fresh to be cleaned. For the fresh to be cleaned and then extracted for a buko salad. What was that? How far you can eat your hand? Is there a son to get there? Careful you must sit yourself in the head with it. Where are you Daly? There we are. It's very difficult job at jeans doing a luscious skill. What you have is sharper attack or a bit of both. The guys that sell it at the side of the road, the Bucco, they're very skilled, they do it day in day out for many, many years. They make it look so easy. There's so many skills here in the Philippines that it takes a lot of practice to become good at them. You can watch someone do it. For example, a pillion applying apple, do you ever try to peel a plant apple the correct way? It takes me a long time. I don't get it right anyway. But the people in the market, how quickly they do it, how fashionally they do it, it's a skill, it's a real skill. Let's try this coconut water. It's very sweet. That's really sweet. It's very sweet. It's very nice isn't it? Very, very sweet. Very refreshing if you put it in a fridge for a little bit. It's cool, that. It's a little bit. Oh my God. Alex. You're being the gym today? Yeah. I can't move. Oh my God. It's all good. So it's a craze gum I'm for. Prime, a drink called prime, who needs it? You've got this. That's really refreshing. This is the real thing. So you need a buco in the Philippines. You don't need a store, you need a desk. Good boy. Well my first time to see you do this. Together, yes. But when you were a little girl you did this all the time. Just applying the coconut trees didn't you? You said climbing barefoot, coconut tree? I only climbed the coconut tree when there was a big dog chasing me. Right, this big dog. So that tool there we got from, shoppy, I think it was 29 pesos or even 19 pesos. Very inexpensive here isn't it some stuff? This is about a still off school for another few days at least. And then new term starts in the Philippines school, when's early. Usually the end of May here in private schools. And then she'll be off to college, can you believe? College already. Wow. Where does time go? My family will be coming over next year. Christmas is really nice but very difficult but I've seen them. Second Christmas I like seeing my family. I had a Skype call with them, it's quite emotional in the end. As you realise people are getting older, not just us but them especially. And it's difficult being away from them, seeing them age. When you're not seeing them every day and you see them every now and then on Skype. It really brings home just how people age, people get older and older. Time goes by so quickly, really make the most of every moment. Well ready for New Year's day. James prepared the food. We've got our glucose salad which we started outside with garden. We have our wine fruits, we have our ribs. We have our sticky rice. This is about I look for to a new year. This is the suman la ptick that all we've given it to us. There are still so many in the fridge. Happy New Year. 2020 is here. Happy New Year.
