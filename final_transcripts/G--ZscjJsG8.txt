 Hi everyone, it's Riyak from Japan and today I'm gonna be checking out this video Go the Japanese soldier who then surrender until 1974 Play is brought to you by Skillshare Hero or nota the Japanese soldier who didn't surrender until 1974 Hero was a Japanese intelligence officer in the Imperial Japanese Army who refused to surrender until Stay famous after that were to it ended in the Pacific theater There were many Japanese holdouts holding Zenryu Nipponhei or remaining Japanese soldiers They were motivated to continue on after the surrender of Japan in August 1945 because of their dogmatic militaristic indoctrination or simply because they were unaware of the surrender Hmm, Hido or nota was trained at the Nakano school as an intelligence officer where he was taught Garello warfare and intelligence gathering Onoda was sent to Lubang Island near Luzon in the Philippines in late 1944 Where he would soon meet up with a group of other Japanese soldiers that year before was the war was over Meji Yoshimi Tena Gucci had given him orders to live off the land and forbade him to die by his own hand He would further reassure officer Onoda by saying it may take three years. It may take five But whatever happens will come back for you until then so long as you have one soldier you are to continue to lead them Higher ranked officers in the group made Onoda unable to carry out his mission to sabotage the enemy air strip and pier at the harbor This in turn made the US conquest of the island which was achieved in February 1945 easy Once US forces were on the island the large groups split up into smaller groups of three to four men and escaped into the jungle And were either picked off by the US troops or surrendered until it was just Hiro Onoda and three others under his command which were left active Private Yuiichi Akatsu Corporal Shuiichi Shimada and private first class Kinshi Kuzuka all of which had set up pace in the mountains After Japan had formally surrendered in September 1945 Onoda and his group came across a number of leaflets the first leaflet left behind by locals was discovered quite soon Reading the war ended on August 15 come down from the mountain However, they concluded that it was an allied propaganda trick After this conclusion the group continued to raid local forces outing Japanese and other resources General Tomoyuki Yamashita of the 14th area army also dropped leaflets from the air with a surrender order But again the group decided that they were a trick With a lack of knowledge of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki It may have seemed more unlikely that Japan was willing to surrender In 1949 Yuiichi Akatsu escaped from the group. So nobody actually came to escape them off causing the remaining three to be cautious to disloyalty In 1952 the search mission was expanded with letters and pictures from the group's families dropped from an aircraft But again, maybe they can find a trick by the three soldiers Every piece of evidence the group came across increased their paranoia and hostilities While they were dressed in their imperial Japanese uniforms the people they came across were in civilian clothing Which they interpreted as allied soldiers in disguise with the strategy of luring them out As a result they didn't think twice when firing on the locals Corporal Shouichi Shimada was shot in the leg but recovered with the help of Onoda in 1953 But on May 7 1954 he was killed by a search party when he fired upon his potential rescuers who returned fire on a beach at Guntan Now just two remained Onoda and Kuzuka would continue the mission to sabotage, gather intelligence on and attack the enemy which no longer existed But on October 19 1972 during a skirmish Kuzuka was shot and killed by the police when he was burning a farmer's rice collection Lieutenant Onoda was now alone On February 20 1974 a determined Japanese explorer called Norio Suzuki found Onoda Onoda still refused to surrender However Suzuki had the idea to locate his original commanding officer Meijii Yoshimi Tenoguchi In March 1974 his former commanding officer Meijii Yoshimi Tenoguchi traveled to the Philippines to fulfill his promise to return and end his orders in person Onoda still wearing his tattered army uniform from decades ago Soluted the Japanese flag and handed over his samurai sword his functioning Arasaka Type 99 rifle several rounds of ammunition hand grenades and his family dagger The Philippine government under President Ferdinand Marcos granted him a pardon taking into consideration that although he had killed 30 innocent people during his campaign on the island He thought the war was still carrying on When he returned to Japan Onoda was very popular But he found it hard to adjust to the new post-war Japan and the decay of its traditional values He published an autobiography and in 1975 left Japan for Brazil where he raised cattle and later opened a series of training schools In his last years hero Onoda said in an interview Every Japanese soldier was prepared for death But as an intelligence officer I was ordered to conduct guerrilla warfare and not to die I became an officer and I received an order if I could not carry it out. I would feel shame. I am very competitive All right, so that was um World War II Japanese soldier who didn't surrender until 1974 um So onoda he Didn't know that Japan the war was over until 1974 that's um that's like 29 years after the war was over And he didn't know that till for 29 years and He I really wish that he knew it earlier so he could live that 29 years differently and I wonder if maybe like if Honey Gucci if could came earlier to pick him up Maybe onoda could live like different life, you know, it's 29 years. That's very very long time And I really I feel if Japanese Japan could do something better something or some other way to actually pick him up This life would be better. That's what I feel Yes, so yeah, that's my reaction to this video All right, let me know what you guys feel about this in the comment section below. All right, thanks for watching today
