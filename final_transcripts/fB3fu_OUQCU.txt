 The Philippines, home is some of the most beautiful islands in the world. And some of the most amazing food and culture you'll ever experience. It's also home to the most friendly, humble, Filipino people that live day by day with smile on their faces, regardless of the challenges they may face. As a Filipino American, they grew up in the USA. I wanted to humble myself and experience what life is like living like a Filipino in poverty. The goal is one month living in the Philippines province on a 200-pacel with day budget, which is $4 USD. I must live like a Filipino in experience every day just like my ancestors who still live and still living to this day. So join me on this new journey of becoming a true Filipino. I'm not. Guys, before this vlog starts, I just want you guys to know everything in this vlog went bad. I literally got stopped by the police, a typhoon destroyed my tent, and everything you can possibly imagine went bad in this vlog. So be aware when you watch this video. I hope you guys have a good day, and thank you guys for watching. What is up guys? Welcome back to day 9 of my Philippines adventure. So guys, today in the Philippines, it is very rainy out. As you guys can see, this looks like typhoon weather. No, hopefully our tent is okay. Yeah, I forgot the windows, they went down. Oh, tell the bugs. Oh, come on. Alright guys, so we forgot to close the windows and hopefully we come home to a tent that's not destroyed. But guys, so now tell them what we're going to do today. Why are we here? So we're going to buy some maranita chicken or something. So yeah guys, oh my gosh, look at this. But guys, today we are going to be grilling. Actually, we can't grill now. Because I cook a grill in the art grilling. Okay, so guys, oh my god. Now it's a full-out rainstorm. So we're going to go to the grocery store and we'll show you guys what we're going to buy. Oh my god, let's go. Going up. There's a lot of people here. There's a lot of people here. There's a lot of people here. Oh my god, this is a full typhoon. We have to get a load so you can tell the bugs. Is it typhoon season? Yeah, almost. It's almost typhoon season? You have to rely on typhoon season. Wow, oh my god. This is insane.

But let's go. We're going to go underground. Okay. Oh wow. So is it? They got a whole grocery store underground. That's pretty cool. Oh my gosh. Look at this. Yeah. Yeah. All right, guys. So unfortunately they did not have it. We wanted it. But so right now we're kind of just stuck. We're lost. We don't know what we're going to do. So let's just figure it out. No, no. We'll just buy a beer from the street. Yeah, let's just find some food or something. It's kind of like we just we didn't expect it to rain. So at this point we don't have a plan.

That's a good idea. Let's go inside and... Can we go around? Yeah, but it's going to be a win. It's okay. We're here for the challenge now. So, yeah, guys, nothing's going. Expect it as we plan.
