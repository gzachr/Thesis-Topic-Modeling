 The normal city at the school is the fellows and they've got an assessment. It's like an interview really to see if she's going to be accepted for private school here. We're not going to give you the name of the school at this point but it is quite a good school. It's a very well-known school and let's hope she does well. I think it's cost for her. Oh no. Oh, probably we're challenging at a moment. We've got her puddle. No. Can you uh... No, I just have a look at this one. And the side? Yeah, the one that is. Is it not? Oh. No. No. You sure? Yeah. So is that? You got the entrance there then? Yeah. So I don't need to cross this puddle. You have to be sure? Yeah. So what's down there, sorry, nothing? Nothing. No, no. No. Oh. We live a bit early. Don't want to be too late. Can't be doing Philippine and sorry when it's important like this. She's got a great chance to get to a great school. I have a great education and we're going to support her in the matter of what. We hope that she really, really succeeds. But whatever she wants to do in life, we're going to support her. We're here for her. And if you're looking to move to another country, you always need to consider your children. Man, what you're going to say? Let me know first. It's going to be okay. Here we are, ready? The entrance of our big town. You know what? Yeah. You have your interview for your school in here. In homo city. Big school. I love homo city. So we're just waiting for the teacher now to come and join us. Come and call us so it is better than going to have her interview and assessment. And then we'll find out she's going to be accepted. As we said, there's plenty of options. Private schools, public schools. No schools are bad. But rather she went to a private school. Might be the easier for her to adapt. And it's going to be a lot of international students here. Lockers from different families all around the world. So if you're looking to move to the Philippines, there's always going to be plenty of choices for your children. They never fear. They don't know the language, they don't know to galore or pursue. There's a matter too much. They can learn a lot of schools here, still speak English as well. So the process for the school is you have a transcript. You have this as well as transcript there from her old school in the UK. So we've got a transcript of a record of an achievement up to date. And they're going to talk to her about her education level at the moment. And there might be an assessment. Might be an interview. And they're going to figure out. I'm going to work out if they feel she'd be a good fit for the school here. But part of the process is you need to obtain your records in the school before you leave your origin country in our case at UK. So when you come here you've got all the records you need. And you can pass them on. They can have a look. And they can see if it should be a good fit. And also what grade she's like to start at. You're going to be in a grade 9. Still going to grade 9. But if some of the here isn't up to the same level of ability for that grade, they would start them in an earlier grade. So we're back at the house. It is about for the first time. It's over three years. It's the first time at the house. The first time to meet the clean green. Oh, cooking corn. I don't know what to do. Let's go. What's the button? I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. What's the button? Go to the bathroom. I don't know. I want to cheer. Go to the bathroom. Fine. Hello. Let me go. Let me go. Hello, Mr. King. The green. No, no. Cooky. Cooky. Cooky. Cream. Cream. The boy. The boy. The boy. The boy. Okay. The boy. The boy. The boy. The boy. The boy. The boy.

I can't find a tree. This is what I've been missing in my life. I'm now at two Robinson's Mild and we've hopped into Jolly V. It's a bell that's called Chikkin Spaghetti. Jane's gone to Spaghetti with a burger steak on the side. And the shoe's all over a cheeseburger and a bite. So it's really busy here at the moment. We're going to go out to the worst shop in the Mild and what's the institutes do. And we're going to go see the people at the shop, have an advantage, maybe have a bit of a chance of them. So we're here in Papa Benieu in Ormok Tipein and Robinson's Mild and we are looking around the middle of the corner. They're very nice. Lots of stuff here. It's a bit sweet. It makes you feel it. It's good. Ever since she retired from our home, we've had a lot of fun. You want one? Yeah, that's one. Yeah? She won't want darling. She won't want to take you down. This one. So that one's your mom's way of going. You want this more one? I don't know. Me too. Me too. I want this one. I want this one. Thank you. You like it? Yeah. Yeah, you like it. Yeah. You like it. Okay. Yeah, this is nice for both the people who come to us. It's really good, aren't they? It's not good. I think you should look nice. It's not good for all the people. I also have one on this one. I have no minima on this one. You like this one? Okay. It's all handmade. It's really good, yeah. Support the look out. All the look, absolutely. Yeah. You like to support the look out. So you can invite us to a baller at a bag. It's been handmade by the owner's mother. It's really nice. It's really good designs. And it's good to support the local community and the local sellers. I think you really like this. Of course. Of course, yeah. Of course. Oh yeah, for change. For change. That's what one's probably more like style. I think it's more like style. I think it's more like style. Yeah. Okay. So we're back from the school now. And we need to get back on Thursday for Isabella to have a proper assessment and interview. We also need to obtain digital copies of her transcripts from previous schools. When you move from any country to the Philippines, they are looking for you complete school records, which will be from grade one up to current grade. So in the UK, that's junior school, kindergarten, all the way up to current school. So you might think these reports are relevant, but the Philippines need complete transcripts of all years. Ever. So just a little tip. If you're going to move to the Philippines and enroll your child in a school, make sure you retain or obtain copies of the complete school in transcripts, like from the very first grade or first year. So we're going to get those. We're going about to school on Thursday and Isabella, I then have an assessment and an exam. We're then decided this is the right school for her. We want to make sure she has the best education possible. By doing so, we're going to check out three or four different schools and then make a decision. It's not about the cost of the school search, it's about the quality of education that Isabella can receive. You want the very best for her if possible. You can go to a private school or a public school, they're both really good. We're going to check out all the options for Isabella and we're going to share those with you. So we'll have an update soon on Isabella's school search.
