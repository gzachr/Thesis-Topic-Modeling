 real boys fixing everything in proper Hello beautiful people, good morning Jindabra. How are you guys doing? It is a windy morning in the countryside today guys. Wake up a bit late, now we are preparing breakfast. It's currently 10 a.m. This is considered a brunch now. I'm going to be making eggs because Robbie is making toast. And actually this is the reason why I got this sandwich maker because he loves this toast. It's the first time. That's, I have this one. It's good. Okay, sunny side up, well done, no. No, medium. Hi, today we are going to be looking at the house because there is a lot of work to do. Robbie said. Isn't it? Yes. Wow. You want to sleep today? Okay, you can sleep. I'm going to sleep. Wow. You want to sleep today? Okay, you can sleep. I think he still adjusting with the countryside guys. He didn't have a good sleep last night because it was hot. Was it hot? It was loud. Oh yeah, it was loud. Hello guys, bon appetit. Let's eat. Ham and cheese sandwich and sunny side up egg. Well, fried eggs. I don't think I could finish these two actually. So we got the cheese in Metro yesterday and it's Virginia premium. Thank you. I'm not sure if it's going to be good. It looks like it's not going to. Let's see. Thank you. Thank you, Lord. It's very, very hot. So you put tomatoes and onion, cheese and ham. Cheese. Hmm. This is like 7-11 in Thailand. No, I think we have better cheese. I mean, better ham. So we get in our stance then. Oh my gosh. What's going on? Can you hear this? It's good. It's not good. It's good. So strong. You can imagine how it just turned on the phone and that. It's all good. And we're not even up high. It's like we're in the middle. Because if you see, we're like surrounded with all the mountains. Okay. All right, guys. We're all be going to take a look at mine. We're in Da Shka. Let's see what's going on. It's that one over there. What? That one. This one here. Okay. I hope you're trying to figure it out, guys. I think it's the camera itself. So maybe I need to get the camera with the cable. Then we're going to replace the rear dash cam. Because even if Robbie looks at the wire, it's still okay. The connection. But here, the rear camera is not showing on the screen. That's why. Not sure what's going on. I thought the reset will reset all of the footage as well. It did not. So it was not reset. Oh, weird. Oh my goodness. I can just also change everything to a new camera. I don't know what's going on. This happens after the Toyota service, guys. So I don't know what did they do. They messed it up or what? Maybe losing the, I don't know, really. Because I think it was still working fine. Look at this. This is the cable for the rear dash cam. Do you guys think this foil has an energy or not? There are four cables in total, little ones. So not sure. Oh, I will be. You can do it, Robbie. See, there's lots of spare wires over here. Because it's pretty long going to the rear dash cam to the power in the LCD. But yeah, it's still not working, guys. Okay, guys. We're here in the back of the house. We're checking out the water system situation. I think I have shared it to you that I already have water connected to the house, right? So I don't need to like, ask someone to turn on the water from there so that I can fill up the water tank. So now this is how it looks. So this is the main water. This is actually coming from Leia. So Leia is the owner of the water. So this is this? The print. Yeah, from Vietnam, it's their family's water. Yeah. And then this one here connects to Mom's house and then this one here going up is connecting to my house. And it goes to the water tank over there. And then sis has her own, which is near to the meter. Honey, careful. It's very light. This one, okay. Is it shut? Yeah. So we're trying to figure out how can we get more pressure inside the toilet because my shower cannot function. Yeah, this is the situation. Yeah? Yeah. Were you done here? Yeah. Then he said we can put a pump over here. But then this is going to get rained on. This area, no? Like sideways. You can cover it with something, no? Yeah. I want them to have. Yeah. So actually my uncle said he said if we can get a bigger hose, then we can get a bigger hose. This one, then it's going to get more water inside the toilet. It's like a needle. Huh? Needle. Like little ones? Yeah, like this one. Why? Ah, that's very small though. I don't have needles like that. Maybe for the, I'm not sure. Guys, Roby is fixing everything in the house. Oh my gosh. Okay, by the way, Roby wasn't able to fix the camera, but then again he was able to fix the, the boot. Okay, so Roby has been with me for what? Almost three years now. Three years in the next two months and I was not able to figure out what the fudge I can actually open the boot with the remote only. Oh my gosh, MJ. How could I not even? So actually I need to press and hold and it's going to open the boot. Before I have to like bend in the driver's seat and do it manually. But this time I don't need to do that. Imagine yesterday we were in Metro. He has to wait for me to open it manually, but then I could just do it in the remote. Oh my gosh. This is it when you don't know about cars. Okay. Well at least it's working now. I'm happy. Thank you. Jin, koye. I'm not the koye. Hello. Hello. Hello everybody. It's already 2.40 pm and I'm about to prepare our lunch. Today is just going to be a day in a life here and the countryside guys because in the next few days we will be starting to be busy for Christmas. So tomorrow Saturday, yeah, today's Friday. We're going to go to the city and grab all of the, what's this? The stuff that we will be giving away for the neighborhood and we will prepare some food of course for the Christmas party which is happening on Sunday the 24 and yeah, we're going to have to be busy tomorrow because we have to pack and wait, I'm going to get the oil. We have to pack everything. Maybe we'll give away like 5 kilos of rice. Let's see how many people will be joining the party. I think there's going to be a lot this time guys because the neighborhood is growing. Robys dancing in front of me that time laughing. Oh by the way, we were watching. What's the title? The flight or flight? The flight. Flight? Okay last night we were watching the terminal and it was good. Tom Hanks actually and then this time the flight by dancing watching too. Andy! Oh I flipped the camera to you. The diesel Washington is actually good. We have not finished it yet because I'm going to prepare lunch first. I'm getting hungry. Let's fry it everyone. I just marinated the pork chop actually. Hopefully this will be good. And then I'm going to make some sauce. Onion and vinegar. Mom this morning gave us some pancetta beehun so we'll have that as well. Sizzling. It's sizzling. To what a time. Hello everybody. We're going to have lunch. Oh this is such a late lunch. You know? 3 p.m. Okay we have here pancetta beehun from Mommy this morning. We have left over chicken and tofu from last night. No no no. Like this. I think I put too much water. You know? I think you have to wait like 5 minutes but I'm hungry already. And then we have pork chop and I made here some sauce. So it's just vinegar. Onion and tomatoes. Okay Bon appetit. Smudge n' go. Smudge n' go. Okay Lord. Let's eat. Let's see if this is good. Robby has the knife. Okay. I only. Oh I burnt it. Because you were talking to me. You want a knife? No I'm used to this one. We use the spoon as a knife. Soty. It's supposed to be too here. It's okay the part. It's not nice. It will always stay very nice to the whole. Just be honest okay. You put the sauce to the rice. The sauce is for this pork chop. Well you can also do it in the rice. Robby is gonna give food to Papa guys. There he is. I don't think it's gonna be for them. Let's see. Look at him.
