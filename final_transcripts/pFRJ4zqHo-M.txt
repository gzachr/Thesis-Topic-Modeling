Maka pre-misha, my brother, when he, I think had first a knock, he always used to bring the to-browseris. Is it? Is it why do I need to care? If I can put it here. See, we're thinking smart. But even my mom said that it's like a grand mom. We're thinking smart. What do you think? I don't think I can do it. Oh, oh, it's a grandmas. What's a grandmas? I don't think I can do it.

That's why we will go by their wheelkins, the water. Because we wanted to buy also through online. But it's so... It's so hard to find it. I don't know why. It's so hard to find it. You can buy one of the same galon, it's a 700 liters. But the pipe galon is the same. Oh, yeah. It's not the same. We didn't find galon's dispenser. That's why we decided to go to the market place. By our water. And since it's gonna be more big to carry that, we have our... We have our... Go, go, go. It's so hard to find it. Go, go, go. It's so hard to meet the people.

If you want to do a bus, in the Philippines, that is not VTC. It's like a survival. If you are a foreigner, oh my God, good luck. You don't know where it's to cross, where it's to go. You will think like, I will cross. They will stop. You will... I it crossing. They will not stop. That's why I don't want to go alone. And I thought you'd learn how to cross. There is one technique. It's the power of Kamae. But not always working. Sometimes I'm scared. And if you're scared and crossing, you will get hit. Because you will be like, oh no, cross or no. And they will not know. And they will just hit you. You will die. You better don't blame a bus. You're scaring foreigners. And if you don't know, you will be scared. They will stop. Oh my God. What? I'm not a bus. Yeah, I'm not a bus. I'm not a bus. Oh, I'm not a bus. I'm not a bus. Oh. I don't want to go. I don't want to go. What I do to you is that you're not a bus. You're not a bus. You're not a bus.

Can you tell me why I will go to the garden today? 일� لم הי'n benchmark? Yeah. Because at any kind of time, if I were here to be mini-analyst, I would also share our expenses That will be enough for me when, and I have nothing to do over here. You want to buy something more. This match reallyinks one's life. I kinda want to buy something more, instead of having something more in your life. What doesn tuple make you darker? When the guests are getting late sometimes, can you buy something for the public? Do you know how Saday, I said you to store and I give you a list of what to buy and you don't come back with pa salubong. You're not a callistain. You're not a callistain. You're not a callistain.

It's just that it's really like that. Old people really carry like that. You can see them everywhere. We have lots of Matanda people in the 20s. Because young people are very different. So Matanda is the only one who can see it. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I'm so happy. But I'm not going to be able to do it. Oh, right. It's for you. That's right. I'm so happy.
