 Damn! I had it by do that! So I don't know if you all know what it's a stands for. Eternity spent driving north. Everybody stop! I believe it's not a bad thing that we watched it in Tagalog. Yes. Welcome you beautiful faces out there. Two. What's up Philippines! Welcome to another reaction video and me drinking my cup of coffee here on our channel. You guys do it like it's on the comments down below. You're having a great day. That's physical, that's your say. I'm Mike. I'm Nelly. We're two travel vloggers that are based in the Philippines here in Makati City. Our channel is making it happen. Vloghead on over the HC, some travel food and lifestyle vlogs from the Philippines and around the world. But here on what's up Philippines, we try to entertain you by reacting to recommendations. You guys send us over on Instagram as making it happen vlog and Nelly's life. Yes. Underline, underline also in here. Nelly, what are we reacting to today? So today we are reacting to a very interesting topic, Mike Chosev. Just want to say that. Something worth expressways in the Philippines. Yeah, it's a... I haven't watched it. I saw that heightlet seemed very intriguing to me so I wanted to check it out and see most stunning, longest, shortest, most expensive cheapest expressways in the Philippines. Okay, we have traveled quite a lot by car. So we have maybe we've seen a few of those. I'm sure we've seen 9% of them. And after mention, we were quite surprised with the streets in the Philippines. Yes. So good. Road to the solar. Yeah, but let's just get into this video and maybe we can talk about that. You know, a little bit more detailed way during the video. Okay. Let's go. So we didn't have traffic, right? You can go and get your head off. Or you can do whatever you want to. You can go to the motorist. Did you know it's integral? I must have been. I did not watch the video. Okay, let's make a challenge. We've just said that we've been traveling around the country. That's right. We're going to the Madaling. But we're going to see the rest of the world. And, is that... We know what traffic is like. But when you're going to travel and you're going to travel to the Philippines, you know, the Philippines is the most expensive expressway. It's an expressway. It's an expensive expressway. It's a bit expensive. But when you're going to travel, you can go... It's an expensive construction. Wow. Sign up a great video. You don't understand the language, but you still understand what it's about. Yeah. Getting the context. Thanks to the English. I love riding on expressways. And, you know, the most important thing is that you're going to have a lot of fun. And, you know, when you're going to travel, you're going to have a lot of fun. Yeah. Hey, what's up? I'm Jeff TV. Welcome to our new vlog and our new video. We're going to visit the Philippines. This is where the Philippines is. This is where the Philippines is. This is where the Philippines is. This is where the Philippines is. This is where the Philippines is. This is where the Philippines is. This is where the Philippines is. This is where the Philippines is. This is where the Philippines is. This is where the Philippines is. This is where the Philippines is. This is where the Philippines is. This is where the Philippines is. This is where the Philippines is. Yeah, I fully agree. So, if you're more interested in the Philippines and you're driving around a lot, traffic really can be an issue. And, the expressways have been a huge support in kind of reducing the traffic. Let us know if that's what he said. People are going to be like, Damn! I'm going to have to do that all the time. They'll be like, No. No. Oh. I'm going to visit Tahin and the Philippines. The Expressway that they're going to express. They're going to be going to be going to the Philippines. But, before that, make sure to subscribe to this channel so you can not miss out on new videos on TV. Wow! Wow, it's not. We're going to go to the Philippines. There are the Expressways that they're going to do. And because they're going to be going to the Philippines. This is the area where the Expressway is located. Yes, we're going to be going to the Philippines. Free of all time. Free of all time. So, we... We're going to be coming to the Expressway to learn what we went to with Ralph. Yes. We went on that Expressway when we were heading up to Vegan with Roger Lucy. And we went up that Expressway. No, there was up all the way up to Zagato. And we went out that Expressway with the motorbikes on our way to Vegan Road. Yes. Really stunning, stunning roads, so good. And also, I find that quite interesting. It's about 12.5 km from the beginning of this road to the relax city. And we're going to go to the Pus Naman, the Pong Gacinal. You really got to watch your speed on those Expressways. Because they're such wide roads that makes you forget, you know, you're not like looking at the speed the whole time. It's so much being built there, especially around the engine that's sitting. If you're going to be flexing, the subi-clark, the Expressway, you'll be able to make a lot of effort. You can't just do it. In the middle of the Megicham, the Expressway, the Pina Camaha Bang Expressway, it's called the Pilipinas. It's a piece of cake, it's a piece of cake, and it's called the Pus Naman. It's a relax city. Okay, the only time when we spent a bit of, when we experienced a little bit of traffic on this Expressway was during Christmas time and the C-games. So that was kind of a busy time. Otherwise smooth. But also, top tip is to get yourself a RFID. Yes. Because that's a so much time, because usually the traffic is always around the toll booths. And if you use the E-tall, you can use the scoop-bright faster. Love it, love the E-tall. So, the Nord-Luzon Expressway, or in Lex, La Kilela, in our Pagalan, the Nord-Lai version road, and the Nord Expressway. Yeah. So, I think the North Expressway, for us, is always, and like it always takes so long for us to get there, because you had to go down Edson for all the traffic. But now, I believe that the next Skyway section opens up, which means you get there so much faster. Love the Skyway. Yeah. Love it. Open it will open soon. It has opened. Yeah, it has opened. The newest section has opened. Didn't know that. So they say like the travel time to Kesson City is only 50 to 20 minutes. Okay, we'll try that. So, I don't think you, if you will know what, it's a stands for. I don't know. All right, let's start. I'll go ahead and see you. I'm sorry. Okay. Okay. Okay, I'm sorry. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, okay. Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. It's the FAMILIO? No, that is incorrect. It's eternity spent driving north. EZA, eternity spent driving north. Let us know if you agree with that by giving this video a thumbs up. It's a Epifanio De Los Santos. Express where I put my avenue if I finally did a San San seventeen year demonwood. That's right Also driving once you got to pause again, that's such a nice road driving as soon as you I can leave Manila on the North Luzon Expressway and the scenery on the sides of the road is completely different. I always say it feels a little bit like the Garden Route in South Africa. Yeah, it looks really nice. Let's bring on the street as well. Yeah, not an area. And because there is no road in the north and southern part of the Metro Manila, I will go to South Luzon Expressway or S-Lex. We go the S-Lex so often. Because we like to go to Patangas. We can tell that we are in South Super Highway. The main road is the road that the Metro Manila and the Provincia of the Barzón. Oh, the sun is shining. So it's nice to draw under the prospects of theelet road into an area that goes into the sea full of beautiful mountains. I begin to consider myself onあれexc at the Start all-way station and first I'll draw the access dates showing me the trail for some of the progress on 20 station lines. My name is... besides, I used to draw under thezeug for 4.5 kilo miles and behead my right foot with choosing CAD São Paulo First both the Homie'sups and three flags, and the first picture, Contanga and Blackoya What's up,HAFES? Luckily, as I'm still recording, the people on Long Heavenly Express who often used this to see me Expressway, with the Philippines, to where it was compelling and smashividade, and to the city of Kilomet blessed it had become. We've been there as well. We've been to all these places, We drive too much. We have to go to the expressway or the road to the car. Fun fact, we have driven inside the Philippines just since we had our car, 8,000 kilometers. And that's not including everything the whole, the two making it juicy on the road, road trips up the north is not including that. We are like another free, now there was like almost, wasn't it like 5,000 kilometers or something? It was a lot. It was a lot. But 8,000 kilometers driving through the Philippines. Good job! Let us know if you like to do road trips and where you like to go because we definitely want to travel somewhere once everything eases up a little bit. About 4 newcomers lived here in Cabana, the three-way road where they were all here. I will go broke when the ana made their own guide especially because when they finally managed to use the crises on the roads they escaped to the Eiffel tower on the metro to their houses that seawards go over in mid-일�ande. This is the Metrumani L'Escaiway. It's called the Metrumani L'Escaiway. That is something when you come here as a tourist. Always say you want to go by a skyway. It's just a little toll fee, but you're so much faster and you will avoid a lot of traffic going to your hotel. Yeah, so true. It saves you a lot of time. But always listen to the drivers, the grab drivers, because if you're going to terminal 4, it doesn't make sense to use the skyway, but if you're going to terminal 3, 2 and 1, they have to leave the station. The Metrumani L'Escaiway is a long road that is the most traffic in the Philippines. It's a long road that is used for the weather, for the weather, for the weather and for the weather. Even in this difficult road, the drivers extend their fingers in this way. We visit Ly interests. The area is now very quiet, in the Speaker. It varies from your personal experience. L'Escaiway is virtue RIT. We are going to spend 3 hours on that Just before Christmas, we almost missed our flight back home for Christmas Oh my god, what an adventure guys! Christmas traffic is crazy, crazy and although we left We are ahead of time, we were stuck in traffic for 3 hours For a route that is usually 20 minutes And we were like sweating and then Close to tears Close to tears, super emotional and then I just left the car It was at some point and us for help and we made it A policeman drove you to the terminal so you could get us checked And we literally couldn't even take our luggage from the car We literally... Yeah, we saw the Christmas presents here We literally had all the Christmas presents for our family at home Because we couldn't bring them with on the plane because we had to leave them in the car Yeah Also another fun fact in the Philippines When you go somewhere, you will always be stuck in traffic And that's why we also say like, yeah, we are on Filipino time If we are right-flate What? So here is the night here, in Ann Le xu And us deposits from the wood factory From this new traffic to minutos Hence we moved this way a lot too And what I have noticed Your favorite participants who atleast named enle Xiaomi 북mouth Enle x The segment 8 The NXDORHATAN link The XEGMAN 9 And the NXHARBOR link The XEGMAN 10 That was collected in the 9th line of the NX Support of Manila I'm not quite sure, this area doesn't... I'm not familiar Maybe Maybe it just looks different from the real shots But it's the Hava area, it's with the Hava area RAPIC You have to I have to I have to say something Something that I've seen is basically the fact that Streets get built here in one day It's so crazy, we had a little construction going on in front of our building Because there was a flooding or something In the morning, everything was ripped apart In the afternoon, everything was done And this is not happening in Austria In Austria people start working Exactly when the traffic gets worse That's when they start working And at lunchtime, it's like everybody stop Work is done for the day Yeah, it takes so much longer to repair streets or build streets And it's just a clatter A clatter? Yeah The construction place in the hometown that we lived in It's a little section of road The history goes back to the early 1800s When the first discovered that kind of thing Now, we're not alone We're still in the same place We're still in the same place And the old house that we're still working on is the biggest building in the world Party party Well, this video must have been so much work Yeah The old house is called Expressway The old house is called Expressway You trust him Never heard of Expressway In the afternoon, it's about 12 kilometers When the city of Calzada is open It's the city of Cordova It looks like a nice view from the Expressway Right? It's really nice It's very good and Expressway is Your team has been groups in season 1 from 단ang那個 Island We're going to come to Cicilex It's in the Philippines with probably 3.7 billion pesos. It's so interesting when you're driving down the... I'm driving down the expressway and the Clark area. It looks like you're driving through a road from the future. The North Luzon East Expressway is a coconut in Kazoon City and New Asia. The particular area is the San Lionardo, Santa Rosa and Lavera. It's a place where the sun and the sun and the sun are shining. The project is a deep WH or Department of Public Works and Highways. The company is a group limited. It's a place where the sun and the sun are shining. In the year of 2022, the city of Kalsada is a place where we can enjoy the night and enjoy the night of the Luzon. In the year of 2022, the city of Kalsada is a center of Metro Manila. The city is a direct connect to the North and South Luzon Expressway. This is the Metro Manila Skyway Stage 3, a partial operational area and an Anlec segment 10.2. It's so good to see the course sections coming together now. The owner of the expressway is a nearby station of the Rizal province, Tajik, or the Kazoon City. I think it will also ease up the traffic situation. This is the Metro Manila Expressway made possible for the regular people ahead and hear about today's complex. About the Kazoon City. Ever considering today's temperatures our station for experiment is decided to provide a reason to deal with the series. It will be widely compound. We're going SX to the road for it. It's cool, right? Yeah. Thank you for the animation. Well, that is good for the pool. In the middle of the US, the EXTENCY computer game is called SX. It's called the SX. It's called the SX.

Because it's interesting for me to just have this realization and I want to share with you guys. I want to hear it. Okay. So if you want to hear it, maybe you want to hear it as well. First of all, I did not think that I have to say something about expressways or say a lot. But in fact, I do because we did so many road trips during our travels. That's why I thought this video would be interesting because we are almost at home on the expressways already. Second thing. I believe it's not a bad thing that we watched it in Tagalog. Yes. Because we need to be forced to learn. Learn. So maybe you can do this every night. I do like we're picking up like a little bit of the context by watching and listening. Seeing things that we know and understand, like seeing the visuals and then hearing the... That's how I learned German. I learned German by watching TV only. How I learned klingon. What? So.
