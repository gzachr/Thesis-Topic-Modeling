It's 8, 8, 8, yes. So, here's a fun little story that I'd like to intertwine. So, when we were in Davao with George and Lucy, we actually went to try crocodile lechon at the crocodile farm. Yes, you heard me correctly, crocodile lechon. Linked right here. And we wanted to have a few drinks, because what we usually do is, for the whole month of January, both George and Lucy and we never drink alcohol. Yeah, we call it dry January. Yeah, dry Jan. Yeah, dry Jan. And this was the end of dry Jan, so we decided to, you know, have a drink together and we went to this crocodile farm and said, can we have some beer? And we're like, yeah, we've got a Red Horse bucket promo where you get six Red Horse. And we're like, yeah, sure, why not? Sure, let's do that. Yes, after a few buckets, we all were pretty bucketed. And the evening ended up with George standing on a stage in front of a ton of people playing his guitar. Yeah, it was actually really cool because we went to a crocodile farm. It was lechon, wait for it. Very dairy. Also, I remember somebody jumping into a pool. I don't know. And it was like really crazy. I have no idea. It escalated. And then the next day, the big surprise came. The headache. Yeah. It was not pleasant at all. Since then, we kind of tried to avoid Red Horse. Yeah. The reason why the Colored Red Horse is you saw her know of the next day. It feels like a Red Horse run over your head. I usually in Japan, we have like, I prepare this one. This one is Japanese alcohol. It's like a percentage of alcohol is only big. And if I have a chance to drink alcohol, I always pick up this one because this one is already 3% alcohol. And it's not strong. But this one is 8%. So like three times. Three times. And Japan's view is about 1%. A little bit. So cute. So cute. Wow. Okay, let's write. Hey. Oh, it's so cute. So cute. Oh, it's so cute. There we go. First beer. It smells like saying. Oh, he likes it. So cute. It's scary. I thought Japanese beer is more like Miga-e. Yes, yes, yes. Miga-e is. But this one is a bit of a like Muta taste. Might be the taste. So even if garg, garg can drink this one. Because so many Japanese girls don't like Japanese beer because it's so bitter. I don't think so. Yeah, I know. Like a water. It's okay. That means that means 8. It's good. Oh, she. So we should give the score to them. One, two, three, four, five. That's good. That's good. Taste is so bright. It's so bright. It's a little bit. We can like high taste show. And it's like Mimbo-te-fati. It should be prepared this way. It's more fun, I think. We love it. Okay, yes. Red Horse is a beer here in the Philippines that accelerates the drunkenness. Yes. We don't drink Red Horse beer in this household. It's not that bitter. Some beer actually right now. What we drinking is for the Pinot Beer but it's craft beer from the Philippines which is amazing. Yeah, my gloves are Filipino crafts. So, so freaking good. And our craft beer actually has 12%. What? Yes. Whoo! Okay, anyways, when we are traveling we usually drink sandmig. Yes. That is true. Alright. I've been here for so long. Which one do you want to eat? Right? Okay. How many passengers? 3.6. Very light. I love the design of sandmig. Yeah. Cheers! Come by! Wow! Wow! What? I think I'm talking about rice water. Rice water. So, rice water. So, rice water. We prepared this one. We could choose one. It is a rice. Wow! It is very hot. Wow! It is a rice. Wow! Wow! It is a rice. Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! It is a rice. Wow! It is like salty, sour, and the gravy. It makes us like a... We want to drink alcohol. Convennator. Yes. No! Who is she? I highly recommend it. If people cannot drink alcohol, you can try this one first. You can like a step by step. Yeah. This is the first one. One, two, three, four. Oh, right! I love you. You are the only one who can drink this. So, this will be... It will be now for you. Yeah. I think our style of alcohol is... Right. So, if you are really like drink alcohol, you can follow him. You don't drink alcohol so much. You can follow him. Yeah. Okay. Sunbeek Light does taste so much lighter. It has also less calories. So, if you are dieting, go for the lighter one. But I personally also think it's a little bit watery. Yeah. It tastes very, very light. Yeah. So well balanced. So well balanced. But, yeah, we come from Austria, so, you know, we love the beer and we love wine. And we kind of really are into the different tastes. So, yeah, I think I agree with him. Yeah. Okay. It's original one. Here we go. Nice. I like the bottle. Oh. Ah, strong. Oh, I think it's nice. Really, like Japanese beer. Yeah, it's excited. So, you're going to have a one. What? Yes. I think he will give it five or five. Oh. Yeah. I think it's my dad always, like, after walking. My dad always say like, Oh. Yeah, say, say, say. I can feel like, I can feel like, What? Ah. I'm so excited. Yeah. You're like, to be that the smell so strong. Yeah. How many alcohols? I like a pasta page and a smell. Also, same to Japanese one, right? Yeah. It's so strong for me. No. I think it's so strong, man. Okay. How many? Four. One, two, three. Three, four. Three, five. I know this place is like, I thought he's going to give five. It's so strong. It's so strong. It's so strong. Oh, it's so strong. I'm sure my dad really like this one. Oh, I just tried to make it up. If he drink this one, he must say like five stars. Yeah. Time, man, it's powerful. It's awesome. I love this. I'm so excited. Please comment down below. Okay. Sunmi, how would you explain the taste? Oh, it's, I said it before. It's like perfectly balanced. It has nice bitterness. It has a lot of spicy. It has those flavours. So, the way it was in German, it's a hot thick. Hot thick, white tick. White tick, white tick, yeah. So, it means that the bitterness comes out quite strongly. And Sunmiq actually tastes like, or similar like the, the, like, normal beer that we drink in Austria. Yeah, yeah. Sunmiq is just a perfect beer. Like, if you need a refreshment, after you've gone hiking or something, it's perfect. It's a crowd-pleaser. Yeah, get those electrolytes filled up again. Okay, what is this? Oh. Oh, yeah. It's so good. It's not the same like in the botanite. It's so expensive beer. Oh. I said more strong. Oh, nice. As becoming smelling, this one is more strong. Yes. So, I think this, this, this. It's just premium. So, I think most stronger. I think we'll try it. I thought we'll try it. Yeah. Hmm. Oh, so right. Hmm. I thought, I thought the bottle of health and that is the same beer. And I was wondering why is that one more expensive at last? The bottle one. Oh, I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Oh, it's a little bit. It's strong. Really light. Red calls it strong at least. Well, they're talking about the flavor. Not alcohol. Yeah, alcohol. Yeah. It's fine. Okay. Okay. One, two, three. Okay. I really like it like this. So, yeah, it's good. But I cannot recognize the... What is premium about this beer? Yeah, actually, I have two. What is that? No. It's the alcohol. It's a bit bright. It's general. It's like a sign. Yeah, it's a bit full. The stuff say, you can drink alcohol this one with a... Junhane. Or like juice. Something like that. Today, I don't have coffee to drink it. I can make it in the special, alcohol. Is it okay? Thank you. I have my favorite snacks. This one, the texture is so good. They have so many kind of flavor, but this one is... The chung-chung.
