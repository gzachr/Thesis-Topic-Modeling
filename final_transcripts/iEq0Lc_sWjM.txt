 But you're Friday. The freshest. You know, this hasn't stopped because we reviewed a bit of this in the sort of TikTok relations with it. But you guys have just kept tagging us on it. And actually, like, if you look at the comments, it's like, well, Eska, another free concert inside this and check this out, ballet and all these other things. Oh, exciting! So, we're over this. So, obviously, it was brought to our attention. I didn't know it was this long. Me neither. I thought it was like, because I think it was the ones that we watched. We're like little snippets. Yeah. But we're going to review the whole thing. Because it keeps getting requested. So, let's give it a watch. Plus, I like the girl. I'm a cowboy. Hell yeah. Hold on, hold on. I want to turn these up. I love that. I love that. Now here's the song. Look at it. I love it. I see that. Look they're just having food literally living their best lives. Oh my god, what the hell? Well they turned that place up. And it's just them. There's literally nobody else in the room. Bow on. Oh, brah, sorry. Get close to the mic, bro. Bro, that bass laughing. And they harmonize as they can. I know. Sorry now, come on. I want to go to the mall. You know she brings so many things in here. The hell is he holding? He's holding nothing you did your cat with. Say back up, fuck up. Boy, he's getting other items. He can't even get the room to always do. Wow, he really had me in that first half. I was like, he ain't going to be any good. And apologize to you. Sounds like a heart-killist. You know that tune? That's what he sounds like. I can go to this. Jesus Christ. Have my money. Also, they're wearing gloves. Maybe they don't want to get their hands dirty. I've never seen that in a restaurant. No, you can't. So when you don't want to dirty your hands and you're eating wings and stuff, they give you gloves. Especially if it's spicy. If it's spicy coating, so you get gloves. I don't know. Well, you take the gloves off and then you like... Ah, right. Because it will be a shame if you go out there. And it's so spicy. Actually, for them, you'll be like, Oh! This was so good. I've seen this. He was so shy about it. Like, she likes it. The audacity. He might actually play the piano. He will. He will. He will. God bless you, buddy. God bless that man. That t-shirt shouldn't say dead ways. They should say blessed airways. Blessed airways. The airways. The larynx. It's basically the same thing. Yeah. Why'd you have to ruin my joke, bro? Bro, it's just so weird. Oh, the harmony is so good. I love you, man. I can love you so long. How much you've caused to live without you. You've been the girl I've been supposed to kill you. Hey, what are you doing? Don't let me need you. Oh. Oh. He is going. He is going. Introducing my singer. What the fuck does he think he is? Like, what the fuck? That's unreal. I bet he has a studio and he's actually like the pianist. He strikes me as that individual. When you go to a studio, the producers or the sound engineers. They're quite pitched. What would you call competence, I guess. But him. Maybe he should go. Then he just proves to you when you're in the studio. He makes you feel insecure. He just proves to you. I could take your job. And producing myself. You're here. You're here at my mercy. Yeah, literally. That guy is dangerous. I don't like this guy. This guy, this guy here in the top right corner. He is dangerous. He will take all of our jobs. And do it all himself. He's great. So this is normal. They didn't get kicked off. You know what's amazing. Try to do it at a KFC. No. Get kicked off like this. The police will be there. Like, if you make your interrupted. Well, obviously, we wouldn't sound like that. But that video, for example, is a good example of all the elements that I needed for a great singing video in the Philippines. Let me show you. Let me explain. Example numero uno. Food, right? Yes. Example numero dos, plenty of phones and battery banks. Oh, very important. Example numero tres. This is very popular in the Philippines. You see how holding it. The iPad. Right, right, right. And then numero dos. No, sorry, numero four. Number four. On conspicuous workers who pretend this is very normal. Yet, this isn't normal. You're in the presses of unicorns. OK. And then the last. The last. OK. I'm going to pretend like I know where I'm going with this. I have no idea. The joke fell short, right? But I just kind of committed all the way through it. So in that case, I think we're just going to sort of call it like that. Yeah. I've worked great video. Then I'll tell you.
