Con let the pain let the pain Contain you. You know it can never sustain you. Con complain. Con complain. Con complain. Con complain. Con complain. Hi guys I'm Matthew. I'm Daniel. And I'm Shancel. This is a playroom studio. We are all musicians and we are reacting to the videos that you guys suggest to us. Yes we are. Today we're lucky to have Shancel with us. We met at Music College and then we found out we were cousins. Seriously. Yes, that's what we did. And that's what we were looking like. It was really strange because when we were young we looked like, even now we looked like. But when we used to go to us, we related and we've like, we used to pretend yeah brothers, sisters and then we turned out. We actually like it. So that's that story. We can probably go into detail on that. Maybe on another day. If you're interested. If you're interested in stuff. But today we're going to be reacting to someone that Shancel have never heard of before. Yeah, we were revisiting our hits basically at the playroom studio and reintroducing them to somebody who's never seen them. Like Daniel says, this is Michael Pan Gillinan performing Rainbow. Pan Gillinan. Pan Gillinan. Yeah, he and Anne. And where is he from? This is in a Philippines again. Okay, I look forward to it. Yeah, so this is a South Border song. Okay. Don't know if I know. Drive on the wish bus again. So as we were saying before, the wish bus are always like a beacon of talent and quality. Okay. You know it's going to be a certain level. Not leg jewel tolerance. Yeah, yeah. So let's get into it and see what we think. I wonder if that is catch-and-see, so it's English. I can't remember now. In a while. I don't know if I'm going to be able to say it like that. No, that's a good stick. No, that's a good stick. Wish. One of seven five. Eight away. Hey, we can now, we can now, we can never know what lies. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We can reach it never tell it all. Very smooth. Yeah. That's what you do. That warmth is on. Yeah. I feel like it's voice. That's what that's the beauty of his voice as well though. The warmth and smoothness there is quite easy to blend with. Yeah, yeah. And that's like the key when I'm teaching people and they want to sing with other people. I say you can't keep softening up of it. Yeah. And softening of it. And also the guitar is quite interesting. It seems to have some sort of like drum pad on it, like the way it's tapping it. But yeah, like something we found looking at loads of different Philippine artists. It's like R&B is still so big in the Philippines. Oh, yeah. It's like, like I said before, with Houston, Mariah, they've been very much. No. In the UK. Yeah. I've never been to a new band called Flak. What's in the R&B song? A couple of bucks. But I used to think I've got a couple of bucks. It's a bit like R&B. It's like a different song. Yeah. It's like to the left. Oh, I love that. I'm waiting for a Philippine artist to cover that as they will. It's like my talent. Why are you not saying that? What is your breakthrough? I like how it's... I like how it's... It's very well arranged. It's so... It's very well organized. It's a whole band. Oh yeah, that's fast. She went under the very... Very dull last time we watched this. I'll do what 90's. She is down as well. But baby, this is my... I'm usually shit-thirming, I am always... I have a quality to everyone. I feel that fixedness. I don't want to be the last music. I feel that I'm always... I feel like I'm being... I feel like I'm being... I feel like I'm being... Very chill, alright. Very nice. She's incredible. She's incredible. She is, she really is. Oh, I love her. Hello. What's that? She's always well. Oh yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh, that guitar. Oh, I love her. I think he's losing in a bit. I think he's losing in a bit. I feel like he wasn't doing well. Such a broken place. Like they just say for the softness. But they left him hanging out there for a while. But around in that part of your falsetto. It can be quite fragile because it's too lazy. It's still close to your normal voice. It's still close to your normal voice. It's still close to your normal voice. Oh, I can't stand it anymore. So come with us. We will see you butterfly. Let's go, let's go. Now we're served to stay for you. You, you, you. Yeah, that's a shame for me. I'm running out of breath. I'm running out of breath. It's still close to your normal voice. I can't stand it anymore. Oh yeah. And the background. I'm gonna have to watch my reaction. Yeah, the fact I forgot her. But there's no way we didn't say so about that. That was nice. You know what? Everbrasser doesn't want this. You want it to be pretty honest, right? Yeah. Right. Don't give us no idea. I'm afraid I hate a mean, obviously. She stood out for me. Yeah, she stood out for me. I would agree what you said. I wonder if it's because you were here that made I was known to her multiple times. I don't know why. But yeah, really, really good. Awesome. Amazing. Beautiful performance. So nice to see it again. They do all come from one another. And I just feel the guy in the middle. For me, with his full setto. He kind of, it wasn't blended enough for me. Yeah, I think you can hear maybe a little bit of breathiness and a bit of a wet, fried jar. Coming up. Coming through. There could be anything. Overall though, we were jamming there for a solid that six minutes. It's not a long video. It's not very nice along. I like it. I like it. Awesome. I really like that. I think Michael Pangolin and the video that we watched of him, he does like to collaborate quite a lot. There's a lot of people. He was in some band called Mudikale, obviously not. Yeah. Awesome. Yeah, so really, really good. I hope that you guys have enjoyed our re-reaction to this video. We've shown it to you. Thank you for watching this video. I apologize. I did say I'm coming in. I'm really brutally honest. But I'm so glad. We could do no more. Exactly. Thanks for watching. Subscribe and we'll see you guys again in a bit. See you guys soon. Bye.
