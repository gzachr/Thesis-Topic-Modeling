 Good afternoon world from Shargau Airport looks like they're doing some construction here. I'm currently waiting for the Philippines Air flight to arrive. My brother and his family are coming to Shargau for the first time ever. I've managed to find a parking space which is rare. The car is looking like an absolute mess. I didn't have time to clean it but I don't think he will care. If this is the first video of ours you've ever seen welcome. We are British family that got locked down on Shargau Island three years ago and we just decided this was the place for us to live. It's an absolutely amazing island in the Philippines. We really love it. It is famous for its surfing because it is right near to the Philippines deep which is one of the biggest trenches in the world which creates amazing waves for surfing. So even though we don't surf we still think Shargau is a fantastic place and I'm really excited to share this home of ours with my brother. His wife and stories to little cousins who are all coming together in a few moments. Here they come. I can see Leoni. Yeah they saw me. I can see Leoni and Devon and Coocam and Auntie Cheryl. They are on Shargau soil. I wish I had a closer lens now. Oh Leoni. Thank you for wearing such kind of clothes today. I would never have seen you otherwise. Wow. I'm so good to see you. I love you. I love you. You are my goodness. I look too much like a Shargau. It is not a person. It is not a person. It is not a person. It is not a person. Are you guys ready to go to the beach house? Yes. Let's do it. Private transfer. I did not have time. Sorry. What's happening? We got the silver lens. Is this super lens so excited? It is already in the car. Oh, popping. Devon. Hi. Hello. Hello. This is my little, this is my best exit for me. Look at the poppies. She is going bad. She must have seen everybody. This is where I was in the car. You made it. Wow. You are going to be my best exit. You okay? Yes. I am not that hard. Poppies, is there anyone else? Yes. Oh, kids. Give that poppies a cuddle. So what did you bring you? A special place. She has the right letters. This is it. Iconic moments. The family is here. How are you, Shargau? I thought you were taking the top of the wall. I didn't know we were coming. Devon has been so excited to see you. Yeah, even when I got to the airport. What lovely cuddles. The family is here. Look at this silly dog. Poppy, we are not going anywhere. We are so excited. Poppy smells Phoenix. Oh, look at her. She is driving to the car park. She is so doggy. Poppy, you silly beast. We are not going out. The family is just arrived. It is just ignoring us. Who is this? This is a cacam. Oh, look, it is small. The kids are in the store. This is kind of strange, really. This has been the lockdown home for so long. And now the cousins are in her room with her. Back to normal world. It has been at home for a long time, isn't it? Yeah, it is. What do you think about all these poppy? What do you think? We are just showing the family around the grounds and to their new home for the next few days. So they are going to be staying in the big house. Which we have never shown in the vlogs before. And actually, I have never actually been in there until yesterday. So even though we have lived here for like two and a half years, I have never actually been in here properly. I have a proper little house tour. And show you your rooms. Do you recognise any of the scenes from the vlogs? I do remember people sitting here. People used to use this as the outdoor kitchen. I remember that. I am just showing the kids the window. What in real life do you mean? Any house. What should we do in house tour? This is going to be your home. Yeah, it is massive, isn't it? This is just the downstairs section. So you can choose your rooms. Yeah. There is a TV down here. This is like the living room area. Quite a big space. And then, I think this is the downstairs bathroom over here. Just get some light signs, getting dark. They have got a hot shower and a pressure pump in here. Yes, you have to do those. It is important. It is quite rare actually to have a hot shower and pressure on the island. So you are lucky. This is the downstairs bedroom. There we go. Very much like ours. This is the downstairs bedroom. There are four bedrooms in the house. So you can choose where you want to sleep. So my mom hasn't been in here either. Or maybe we will keep our downstairs. These are things. Yeah, and also she has got her own bathroom that way too. All the rooms are air conditioned. And then, it is head up the stairs. This is kind of like a pantry zone, like a storage area. Which also has a view of the sea. Straight out there. This is all your eggs. Yes. And then upstairs we go. I am going to see the bedrooms. And then they are really steep aren't they? I don't know if you can gauge how steep that is. It feels like, I don't know if that means anything to you. See my elbow doing that? But they do feel steep like a ladder. Lovely pool up here. This is the landing. And then, ooh, it is lovely and cool in here. This is my bedroom. This is my bedroom. The one with a lovely view. Look at that view. Wow. Yeah, this is the best bedroom I want this bedroom. It is a nice room. It is a nice room. It is a nice room. It is a nice room. It is a nice room. It is a nice room. Oh yeah, it is going outside right? This is probably the biggest bedroom. Oh, so nice pool. Oh no, there is a little man. This is actually like a beach view. And also, Oh yeah, it is so nice. I like it. It is cool. Yes, it is. It is so nice. Then he has got the, what is the other one pool? The styling internet. Oh yeah. Is that just resting there? Yeah. Now it has been bolted in rock solid with super balls. And did he choose the position? Just by using the app. It tells you where they have got obstructions or not. It is really cool. So that was pretty cool. We have never actually toured the big house before. And it is going to be nice to test it out as a whole home. Usually, I tell Mary Jane, rents out the rooms as individual rooms on Airbnb. But now she is thinking about listing it as a full house booker who has basically suggested it. We think that place like this is beautiful, every looking, all of this amazing scenery. This is Uncle Kerm's first time down to the beach. What a view. What a view. How is it from the bedroom? And it looks awesome, but to walk onto it. How does it feel to be here? Just a good start though. This is so cool. This is what I wanted to see. His plane together. The story is right at the top. Showing Devon the ropes there. Look at Poppy. He is going to speak to Poppy. The story is doing her island girl duties. Showing people the ropes. How does it feel? Nice. It is nice, isn't it? Yeah. It feels normal weirdly. I was just about to say that as well. It feels normal. It feels like it is a real thing. It feels like it is a real thing. It feels like it is a real thing. It feels like it is a real thing. It feels normal to have everybody here now. There was a time when this felt like a locked box. Yeah, that is it. Yeah. A locked down home is now open. Exactly. Now we have tourists, family, guests. All sharing this space with us. Poppy has been taking her time to get to know everybody. Slowly, but she has been really good. She loves meeting people actually. Normally when we go on our walks, Poppy will just dart off and run into the distance. But now she seems to be nosing around. Look at you. I know Devon jumps off, didn't he? Yeah. You were right up at the top, weren't you? Yeah, again. Yeah. I don't think I've seen you go that high before. You did. Not that high, not. You did. Is Devon alright? That was a big jump, Devon. Well. Here we go. Leonie's first time touching the sea of the Philippines. How does that feel? I feel. Yeah. I absolutely love your dress, Leonie. Story loves wearing colorful dresses like that too. Yeah, we're going to get right on. It is now the following morning. Put the camera down to just enjoy time and family and have dinner. And then forgot to pick it up again. Everyone is fast asleep. We did have a plan to go out early this morning and walk to the rock falls, but the tide and the weather are not right for it. Hoppies out for her morning walk. It's still early. It's only eight o'clock. Sun has risen fully into an overcast sky. And the tide is still not out properly, is it? Not enough to be able to walk around to the falls. Yes. Maybe in about an hour. Yes. We could have some coffee. We could have in a lazy start. And then we'll walk around to the rock falls with the family. Yeah, I think that would be nice. Yeah. Even if it's not bright sun, it's still going to be good. Yes. So we're going to do the shout out for today. And today's shout out was going to Jay. And me. Thank you. Thank you.
