 Shusah, nakabay sa'n kaya? Oh, wak! Mupa liit ko. Oh, kong sa i-mupa liit ko? Isakakilo po? Doha. Ayyo! Ayyo! Ayyo! Mula! Hey, Pronis. Welcome back to a new vlog of us. Today I'm alone because you guys saw, I don't know, our latest vlog we had problems last night with our boat. So, Chami, she had appointment at 7 a.m. for her first nail client. And she had just two hours sleep. So, luckily the other two people, they transferred the appointment on other days. So, Ma Sawa has no time to sleep but it's good because she was really struggling. That's the reason why I decided not that I will cook today. But I need to have some vegetables and I want to buy them at the market. My plan is now that I will go to the Makaru. And I will try to practice my design. I live here now since September 2022. So, that is one year and two months. Three months. And I think now it's time to show you guys what I learned. Because if you guys remember the very... The second vlog we have ever made or I have ever made here. It was also my first V-Sion practice. And it went not so good you can see it now. I am here in the Philippines. So, I will try to order this to buy this with my V-Sion skills. Is that? Is that? Is that? I think they will know. I think they will know. Showing my baby that I was successful. Yeah. So now I want to try to make it better this time. I need to say before I start, please have mercy with me. I do not go in school. I don't learn with apps or any exercises. Like, I don't take lessons with teachers. I just learn this sign on the streets. I learned from listening my sour. And when she is talking with other people. And I just try to listen carefully. And then I try to copy what other people say. So, we are going to see now how it works. And, yeah, I'm curious. Okay, Chrome is now at the fish board.
