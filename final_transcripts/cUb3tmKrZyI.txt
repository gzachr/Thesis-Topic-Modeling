 I think when I turned around here's under big bike. We're just across from IT Park. IT Park is just here. So we've come from IT Park across the pedestrian crossing where it's under big bike. Going there. It's beside the... what the front hotel. What a front hotel. We can't look at the smaller motorcycles first. Then they have service areas, smaller motorcycles. And now if I hear it's the bigger motorcycles, the big bikes. So we go in here first. You hold it. Jump hiring if you want to jump. They're looking for people. Hi. It's OK to video. Hi awesome. Hi. Is it OK to video? Yeah, slam it. Here this is Honda motorcycle. Very dacol. It's a Tinder hand deri. But they have Dacan. Merriming motorcycle. This is a smaller. This one is a little larger. 150. I look magenda. In do it. Like plenty of juice from. It's 150 L. There's a 150 L. That's fairly new. 150 CC, a little task. But go anywhere. It has not been tired. Upside down forks. Dispriced front and back. Atobangen and solid cut. So, disc brake. There can be. Yeah, another 150. But plenty scooters under click. In orange. Here your favorite XRM. This is a Filipino favorite motorcycle to ride. XRM 1-5. They have. If you're right here, they have plenty of parts. Plenty of parts and people know how to fix XRM. And now only small 1-5. But you can put your bag in the front. If you truffle around, people put luggage here. Overseas may be only one person. But in the Philippines, maybe two or. Two or loud, but sometimes you see more. This is like a TMS. It's more agricultural. I'll say agricultural, but very popular. C-cup. The drum brake front and back. Sometimes I like to have a look in the motorcycle shop. Here the wave 110 under wave. Plenty. You have ponder bait. Motorcycle. Tenan. Now you can have a 150. Click. Ponder click. This is a 150 CC. So we go into the. This is the XR150L. This is a popular motorcycle in the Philippines too. It's like a. Overseas I call it like agricultural for fan use. But it's fully able to be road registered. It has plastic. It's got normal shock absorbers front. This bright 150 CC. So it has good power. And the price is for this is quite okay. But these are popular in the barring eye because you have good grand clearance. And sometimes people will put another Honda sprocket on the front or back depending if you want more low dam power or you want it to go faster. And this is. You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You I I know Honda sell a I think it's like a 600 the next size up from the 500 they sell a 600 which is a very retro design. Here's your Africa twins. So I know these two are slightly different. I probably can tell you the whole difference. But again, this is a popular all-around motorcycle. A little task, like a little maybe high. But I think one has just probably a bit more expensive. Like they look almost the same, different color scheme. I think one has more traction control and things like that. Maybe a little bit higher ground clearance or higher to ride off the ground. I don't know what this one is. Not sitting looks like another 500xCPU 500x. I'm not sure why they have two here. Maybe this is the same model as the other one. I can't rate the... so I'll ask the question. What is the 100xCPU 500x? The one with 90 inch front wheel. That one has windshield. Oh, so they're both 2018 model. But you can get 2019 model. Thank you all. This is a 2018. They're waiting on delivery for 2019 model. So the main difference I think is the size of the front wheel. And they redid the engine. So the engine on the 2019 has a little bit more power. They change the power band. And I think the front light was slightly different. That's about five differences between the two models. But they're very popular motorbikes. It's a very popular year. But they're the motorbikes on offer. But I know there's one or two other versions of big bikes that they do have available in the Philippines. So this under big bikes in next to IT Park. You probably call it IT Park in the civil city. The style of motorcycles I like. Like the CRF 250 because they go anywhere. But they're little, the six are little high. So some people will lower it. I like the XR150. I like that style of motorcycle. But you'll have to be careful, very careful riding motorcycles in the Philippines. Maybe that's something for a different video. And the XRM is like a... In the Philippines, that's like a Honda Classic XRM. Anyway, that's our surf. Honda big motorcycle IT Park. Enjoy. I'm thinking... Enough.
