 Hey welcome to Farron here in the Philippines. Well it's time for another adrenaline rush as I open our grocery. You know you've never done me any home but I still have to do it. Okay now this I'm thinking the prices have gone up and usually I'm sure you you remember because videos like this are usually burned into your memory and usually I get change a few hundred change out of two thousand two thousand pesos so just think of the numbers rather than the values because that's what we're dealing with here no point in translating anything into pounds, pounds stirling or or dollars US or whatever or whatever what we get is what we get and that's the whole thing. Now this game this came in this in this because they couldn't get everything into the box so maybe maybe I did go a little bit over okay this time but anyway here's the here's our list and it came out to two thousand two hundred seventy five so that was the damage and I did my usual what what I've been doing is every time that I go in now and shop for groceries I've been getting a little bit extra so I get extra canned food I know that we won't use it and I'm building up a little stock not not going in on panic buying which is what I'd like to do but Beth Beth can't see the sense in it I would go in and I would buy an entire an entire box like this of canned food of the various types here a subsistence level or yeah no the poor man's meal for the family can be a lot of rice on everybody's plate and believe it or not as little as that so that's a small can of sardines in tomato sauce and maybe one or two of these would actually feed a family of four or five you know nobody would get a terrific amount but they get a touch and a taste of the fish and welcome to reality in the Philippines when times are hard and times are hard right now there's no doubt there's no question about it and I can see that there are other people who are buying in in the event that maybe things are going to get scarce and the thing is things do get scarce because we get used to hearing that phrase out of stock now if you've been following our videos on what we do on what we're doing at the police station to try and give those guys a better kitchen and dining area and changing rooms and that whole what was just like a slum that was out the back of the police station and the the astray help on that and we were they'd been working hard with us on our projects so we were very happy to come in and step in and pay back so what we've got let me let me get back to this in hand and as I always say look they do such a great job of packing okay right so I just said some of this stuff I already unpacked right so I always get noodles we've got lots of noodles that we haven't that we haven't eaten and possibly may not get around to eating sometimes in the evening when Beth and I are working late we might feel like having a snack and I'll put an egg into a couple of these and we'll mash an egg up into it and and that will be our snack or in your afternoon when we get home and we've already had lunch and we're getting home at say 5.30 or 6.00 and that going to eat for a couple of hours so this sometimes is convenient this and or maybe this so I got some brownies this time so on this occasion I have I have gone out and got some some little treats so I got a Hershey's cream chocolate with whole almonds this won't be an American Hershey bar it will be a Philippine Hershey bar actually I'm just looking now and it's three so I got I paid for three and I really like a bar well a piece of chocolate at the moment so that's that's what we did there I got this is something that I've changed at Nanise because they never seem they don't think that these are a shelf so if I don't if I don't change them they don't get changed so I got a few of those last year at least I got some salt powder so there's a rest of the that's the rest of the noodles now for some reason I think I used to get I used to get craft cheese now they're out of stock they don't have it sometimes I think they go down there and they get what they can they get what's available and this is what was available this was one dollar each so 50 pesos each so I got three and that was obviously 150 now the last time I showed you that this is how we buy this is not coffee but this is how we buy coffee and I've got coffee in there the same so rather than buying things in large box they don't do that and that way someone can go in and they can just buy they can buy one one of these if they want to so it's what I call a one egg economy it's possible here to go to a soury soury store and buy one egg believe me so this is some an energy drink chocolate favoured it's with milk it has oats has an oats cereal milk mix with milk I think probably I shouldn't have so much milk but I don't want it to keep drinking a lot of coffee so this is it this I get for birth one pack of these is not enough for birth and she ends up either either using two of these or at least one and a half that's bad okay I go and usually these are in good shape and must have a huge turn over these because I haven't seen any of those that haven't been fresh that have been in good shape when we get them so there I got a couple of drinks this is apple green tea so these are not hugely expensive okay so if you buy these outside I think they're 50 cents or something not not very much and I got a couple of those now this is a good example of I like to get the cranberry juice at my age getting up at night is a fact of life and cranberry juice helps that if if you're my age and you don't know that then you've learned something of value you go out and buy a grand cranberry juice and it is supposed to be good for the kidneys so I got that instead this is actually a hundred percent great juice so there aren't a stock on the cranberry juice what can I do so I got that instead now what we started to do was well I started to have I got a can of a whole corn and and this is just ready to eat corn you don't have to cook it you don't have to do anything and when you're in the Philippines you get used to eating food cold it's the way of life so these are easy pot can and you get a can and now I would well before before Beth realized that this wasn't a bad idea I used to eat the whole can and picking out now unfortunately I have to share it with Beth so I got I think I got how many of these I think I got about six of those because we eat them at night as a kind of a snack when we're working this I get for Beth because she likes it and I'll put this in the fridge now I noticed I didn't get any eggs because for some reason we go on and off things and we haven't been eating many eggs just lately whereas a lot of the time I get up in the morning and I'll have three eggs and I can of pork and beans and we've already gone to the expose on the pork and beans fraud this is a gigantic fraud being perpetrated on the nation the it's full of beans admittedly but the piece of pork is about that big so I don't know how they get away with it and I got I've just got a ton of these now this was quite expensive I think this was I think this this is a tuned flakes and and when they they were showing doors look at that the labels on upside down in America you probably get that cheaper because of that I think that was a dollar and I think that was a dollar two so I got those because they can go these kind of things the the sweet corn the pork and beans will go with the noodles but I you know I would I came up as a single parent raising the kid in my forward and we we had pork and beans and we had eggs and we had we had noodles and we had noodles with with some sweet corn in it and and then egg and that was that was a meal so this this is all this is all canned stuff now so another I knew that I got and you I got what did I get one two three four five I got six of those because I know I don't really know now this this was a bit of a luxury it's orange marmalade and this was nearly two dollars so we're looking at it doesn't have a price on it right now but very little change out of a hundred pesos but that will last a long time actually have some others this is mango jam and we have that on toast times we can get brown bread but it's not really they call it wheat and wheat and bread and it's it's hardly the rich chunky um whole meal bread that you can get in America it just doesn't exist course in in the UK you'd be talking about getting a hoavis and cutting it yourself so sardines I got a ton of sardines because how many I didn't even count them but you can see you can see there's a there's quite a few but they'll go into the store we'll never get rid of those by the time we go again for groceries and there's our boxes empty that was everything so that's pretty well everything I didn't show you one thing I did get another another naughty this is it's chocolate it's a chocolate cake this will not last very long because we're not very disciplined and it has chocolate in it I'll admit to being without control so that's our that's our groceries but as I've explained before well this is not really our groceries because we we really go into Taliban every day it just works out that way and we go in there every day um if I don't if I don't mention to Beth food she won't even think about it so if you're thinking that we get up and we have a lovely breakfast cooked by Namin or cooked by Beth and we sit there and look out over the hills and eat our eggs and bacon and you'd be wrong we don't do that we we get up and make coffee once we went through a spell where as I said we had uh poached eggs and poached eggs was something that Beth enjoyed she hasn't she hadn't had poached eggs before believe it or not so we went through that and she she enjoyed that she is one fussy eater so if it's not if it's not chicken and chips and if it's not fish I mean those little stinky fish um it's hard to get her enthusiastic so if I would make one egg and beat it into a cup with a little butter she might try to finish all of it one egg okay so that was something that I tried to do I tried to interest her in the kind of cooking she might have to endure if she went to America or went to the UK neither neither is a possibility or an intention even not a plan or a wish I am living where I want to live so this is where we are right now as I say if I didn't talk about if I didn't talk about food we wouldn't have any and very often we're we're rolling into Vidas though our little favorite restaurant and the time is sometimes three or four in the afternoon and that's when we're having breakfast and lunch and then we wanted anything then until dinner and because of the way that things are set up with Nana and her helper who is her I'm not quite never quite sure whether it's her cousin or the daughter of her cousin or yeah I don't stream my brain when it comes to trying to understand that particular part of the Philippine culture but everybody is related to everybody it seems and so why would I bother trying to understand but but Vekvek is part of the family. Baitbet works with Nana and she comes in sort of mid-morning and she she really is the housekeeper Nana we don't ask to do too much Nana we leave the main duty for Nana is stressing about the dogs because she what is whether they've got fish or some other luxury which even I don't get offered for me they've given up on my menu and I have chicken in a broth with rice I don't offer me stinky fish and the soup that they make with mongay which is a very very small leaf green leaf about as big as my thumbnail and I see that eaten a lot in in a watery kind of soup and they eat that a lot they pick it from the garden it grows on very very slender long long growing six and seven feet trunk that's that's the tree and then at the top it suddenly goes like that and and has all of these leaves well you just reach you bend it over like desperate burn in the old comics that I used to have pluck off some up and then let it go back up and it will replenish itself so that's all in the in the garden. We eat at Videshto we eat here if we're hungry and that's why we need groceries here I eat apples all the time I I use my big knife my psycho and I peel I peel the apples I met it makes them taste much nicer and so that and occasionally some egg I'll cook I have the tree for the eggs is fall in there that's why I didn't get any so my conclusion is that things are going up and I think that they're going up a lot so I don't know how people are managing out there but I think I think that times are getting tough okay well thanks for looking in and for being with me I hope by now as I've tried to talk you down that heart rate is coming down after all this excitement and perhaps you'll be back to normal by the time I get more groceries thanks for looking in bye for now
