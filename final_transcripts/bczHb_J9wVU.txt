You're everything organized and nice, nice clean and stuff. People were quite warm, very warm people. Yeah. Happily. But some kind of part of Manila, let's say, is not so clean how it seems to.

So on a scale from 1 to 10, I know you guys just have arrived. How would you rate your staying in the Philippines? Right now, 8. 8. Okay. 7. 7. Okay. Probably after the island, you're going to change your opinion as well. Definitely. Yeah, I'm enjoying staying here at the beginning. So I look forward for our trip. Short trip. Yeah. Oh, okay. Thank you so much and enjoy your staying in the Philippines. Okay. What's your name and where you from? Jason from Australia. And so far, what is your first impression of the country? And it's just, yeah, beautiful. It's, I was actually just thinking about it as I was getting on the scooters here. And it's just the people so awesome. It's like, you look at little things like scooters that kind of cutting around and going in front. Mm-hmm. In a lot of, in Australia and the US where I've lived as well, it's, people would get very annoyed at you. Here, it's just like, ah, nah. If you want it more, go get it. And it's just all friendly. So it's just, that's the people. It's just friendly. Okay. From the first time that you came here, to the second time that you just returned here, what did you see that have changed in these coming two times that we have been here? Definitely some of the islands that just kind of busy are, there's a lot of tourists picked up again. But yeah, apart from that, everything's a little bit the same from what I can see anyway. From my external perspective, it's just, yeah, people still awesome. There's still lots to do and yeah, things are good. Besides Manila, do you get to go to any islands in the Philippines? Yeah, so I just came back from El Nido today. So yeah, I was over there for a few days in Palawan as well. And I'll be heading to Subu on the 11th. Okay. From our view as the one that I'm watching us right now, can you tell us, how was your experience in Subu, right? I, in El Nido. I knew the story. How was your experience in El Nido? El Nido was great. I shout out to our post-hostsale, stay to that place. And it's just, yeah, the staff, they were absolutely fantastic. The tours, the island hopping tours were amazing. But yeah, like again, that staff, like I left this morning just before checking open, like before the staff were there, but the nighttime security guard, he's like, oh, do you need to go to airport? Oh, do you want to ride? I'm finishing shift in 10 minutes. I'll give you a ride. It's like, wow. It's just people like that. Those interactions, it's just amazing. Okay. And have you eaten in the Filipino food? Yes, yeah, yeah. Why so people who aren't? This is traditional that chicken, what I keep forgetting the names.

I think we're going to be the Germans today. Are you planning to go to any island in the Philippines, besides Manila? So, let's see. My plan is to go to Japan. I've never been to Japan. My dream is to go to Japan. So, after the finals, I'm going to fly the Almandei. But I also heard that there's some good islands nearby. So, if you can, if you can, I would advise you to check. I live in the Philippines, and I have been to most of the islands. If you like Paris, go to Bora-Kai. Bora-Kai? That's Bora-Kai. I don't know if you trust me. But if you just like that island life, walking out, shirtless, you go to Shargau, driving motorbike, shirtless, serving, I want to go after the Pratubola Cup first, then go to Japan. Okay, man. It's a word from. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. Okay, brother. Thank you so much. And enjoy your stay in the Philippines. Any message I'm into the Philippines watching us right now? Salamat. Salamat. Okay. Salamat, thank you. Yeah, Salamat. Okay. You can say Salamat, or if you want to be really like more kind, you can say Salamat Paul. Yeah, brother. Thank you so much, man. Take care, man. Then check the final. Okay, we got the final. For sure. We get the hockey championship right now. Uh-huh. But the Abu Tabaultas, we got a third position of the world. And now again, we're going to get the medals. So I'm really excited. Let's go. Okay, brother. Thank you so much. Enjoy your stay brother. Thank you so much, man. What's your name? Milosh. Where are you from and for how long you've been in the Philippines? I'm from Serbia and I'm here like for 10 days. 14 days. What is your first impression of the country? I would say it's kind of, it has like a lot of American things in Philippines. I would say there is like a lot of American influence in any Philippines. Yeah. Have you visited any places like any island in San Manilo? Yeah, I was in Burakai. And it was really nice. I think the weather was not so great. It was really nice over there. Oh, okay. And on a scale from one to ten, how would you rate your staying in Burakai? Nine. Nine. Yeah, I would say nine. That was amazing. Amazing, amazing for me. Okay. So, and what is your first impression of the people as well? The people here in the Philippines? People are really nice. They are polite. Especially in Burakai because it's a tourist place. They are welcoming and they want to help you. And it was really great experience. Oh, okay. Any message? I mean to the Filipinos watching us right now. Yeah, I would say, guys, you are really great. I wish you all the best. And I felt here really great. I like I'm at home. Shout out to you. Thank you so much, brother. Enjoy the game, Ben. Thank you so much. What's your name and where you from? I'm from LeVuena. Between you. How long have you been in the Philippines? This tournament, you mean? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, we've been since the very beginning. Since the very beginning. Yeah. Okay. And what is your first impression of the country? Well, you know, it's different. Different places. Some of them are really tidy and nice. Some of them are not. But overall impression is very good. People understand basketball. And that's good. You don't have too many places in the world where people understand basketball. So that's the main thing, I guess. Yeah. And a really big, big fan of the basketball. Yeah. I mean, as we have seen the stadium, or the arena, it's always full, but not always full. Yeah. I mean, whenever the Philippines is playing. No, no, no. I think that the main mistake for that was the price, you know, the prices. You know, they are definitely too high for this region, you know. And that's why people mostly buy category five, which is up, you know. And the lower sections are almost full. So they just did the tricks that, you know, when they see that it's not enough spectators, they are just asking them to get to the lower spaces. Yeah. Have you eaten any Filipino food? I mean, during this time that you have been here? Yeah. Yeah. And on a scale from one to ten, how would you rate it? It depends, you know. Some of them are really good. Some of them is really good. Some of them is just not for me, you know. Okay. And are you planning to go to any island beside Manila? So far, no. But we will see, you know. We still have time. Oh, you still have time. Yeah. Thank you so much. And appreciate for your time. Enjoy staying in the Philippines, brother. Thank you so much, man. Thank you. Thank you so much, man. Victor. And which team you support in today? Oh, Serbia. Serbia. Oh, okay. Away from Brazil. Oh, Brazil. To follow Portuguese. Follow Portuguese. Oh, I don't know. Go. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, what is the first impression of the Philippines? I love the people. The energy, how they are, like, they are very humble. So, the first time I came here was 2016. So, since then, I've been traveling the world. And since, like, traveling Asia. And that's the first place I've found love. Oh, okay. So, I found love in the people here. Oh. The people. What about the food? I'm not into the Philippine food, but I still eat in some local food. Even street food, I like. What is your favorite one? In Sableu, and... Sinigam. Sinigam. Here, for me, it's one of the best places to visit. If you'll bring your family, you'll be the best place to travel. Because it's very safe. The people are adorable. The beach is, like, you see it, more than 1,000 islands. So, you can't go to many different places in the same country. Like, you're not going to find out of the Philippines. So, here in the Philippines, you're going to find nice islands, nice cities, nice history. A lot of good stuff. Okay. And, guapo, like, many words that are similar to the Portuguese. Yeah, so, for me, it's very easy to understand them because they speak Tagalog with English. So, I can get what they're talking about. So, like, for years, I think it's enough to learn something without studying. Without studying? If I study, I will learn. What's your name and where you from? Askol, I'm from Latvia, Riga. How long have you been in the Philippines? Oh, in the Philippines, I arrived just this morning, but I'm since beginning. Came in from Jakarta this morning. Is it your first time in the Philippines? Yes. What is your first impression of the country? It's quite similar to Jakarta, actually. Maybe not that chaotic, maybe less traffic jams. Not that there was not much time yet to get used to it, but yeah. And, are you planning to go to any island here in Manila? I mean, sorry, in the Philippines? No, plans yet because I'm planning to go home on Saturday or Sunday. So, all depends on the outcome of today's game because we are hoping, of course, for the win. If we win, some short trip could be planned. Thank you so much. Good luck on the game as well. I hope to see you guys on the final. And enjoy your same developments. I appreciate it, man.

You should come here, you come to Manila and see a different kind of life. Live here is Yfain, Yfain is in Australia. Okay. Yeah, especially from the mind here also. Okay.
