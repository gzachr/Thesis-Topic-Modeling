 Oh! It's a coke. Oh, good bye! Hi everyone, this is Jessica and welcome back to the second episode of Korean At The Series here on Sunless Club. For today's episode, I'm going to let different Koreans try the one and only Filipino chicken with rice combination. I know, for many Filipinos, the chicken joy you see in Dallabee, you know, the one you eat with rice and the gravy sauce as sabbaw. It's very common, but for Koreans, it's very, very, very uncommon. That's why it's going to be very exotic and new for many people, just like how it was for me in the very beginning. So yeah, let's go ahead and see what they have to say about it. Okay, so I'm back with Korean guests right here. Hello, I'm Ho-Jun. Nice to meet you. Hi, I'm Subia. Can you please come in? Hello, I'm Lee Jae-Wook. Nice to meet you. And I'm going to see Bo-Gyung. So today, we're going to try another Filipino fast food chicken. So chicken with rice, just fried chicken, and the white rice, gravy sauce, and the sauce that makes the meat go well together. Mix it. Yes, one meal. Yes. Korean capsicum or McDonald's, you know, chicken, right? But you don't have to eat it. So when you're in a Filipino, you eat rice with a test-free. It's like a rice. It's like a basic option. It's like a rice-cooked chicken. It's like a rice-cooked chicken. It's like a seasoned chicken. It's like a seasoned chicken. It's a crispy chicken and rice. Yes, crispy chicken. It's like a crispy chicken. I got a little bit more. I think I'm going to use to dry, and it's already plain, and you're going to eat another plain thing together. So that's why I can't use it. So we're going to try it right away. Okay. Yeah. Why? Good. Oh. Oh, I'm coming. Thank you. It's like a different thing. Good thing. For me too. For me, this is so good. I think it's just like my home. This is so Filipino. And it looks amazing for me. So we're going to eat it. I'll cut it. It's not so common in Korea. I first saw the gravy sauce in the States. It's different from the States. The US is a bit new to the US. Right. It's a bit more spicy. The gravy sauce in the States. The gravy sauce in the Philippines. So different. This is the Philippines gravy sauce. It's like a hot chicken. It's like a hot chicken. I'll try the sauce. Hmm. How is it? It's good. I think it's a bit of a broth. It's good. It's like a hot chicken. It's like a hot chicken. It's like a hot chicken. Oh. Usually, in the common market, there's a lot of people who just eat this. They just go to the store and just do this. They do this and they have to mix rice and sauce. It's like soup. Oh. It's like a hot chicken. I'm going to now take out the chicken. Is there a chicken? There is. There's no chicken or chicken in the Philippines. Really? No. No chicken. So, I'm going to mix rice and sauce. Oh. It's like a visual. It's like a visual. You can mix it. This is a classic. Classic. Why? Okay. See you guys. Let's go. It's good even though it's fresh. Really? It's not like a seafood. It's good even though it's fresh. It's good. I thought it was really different. It's better than the fresh. It's better even though it's not like a seafood. It's better. It's better. Honestly, if there was no sauce, I think it would be better if the two of us didn't. It's not good to eat with the chicken. But the sauce should be different. I think we should just clean it up. How do you like it? I like it. It's okay. It's a little less. Oh. It's too much. It's too much. But there's a lot of stuff that you can use. I think you can eat well. I really like the feeling. Oh, really? So I think it's okay. Oh. Chicken is good, but the sauce is a little bit more than I thought. It's good. It's good. Oh. But the sauce is really long. It's usually a little spicy. It's a little bit hot. I think it has pepper in it. Yeah, I've had a lot of pepper. Uh, that's a little bit of color. It's not that bad. Oh, pepper tastes. Actually, it tastes really good. Oh. Sauce, that is fine. Oh, that's fine. Then I don't really eat chicken with chicken in the Philippines. I don't understand. A lot clearer. K-eups has different layers better than Yamlock's... chicken is really salty and specially seasoned with potato flakes chicken is expensive It's like a small whisk, and it's like a snack. This is a little more. You can do it with one hand. So, it's really good. It's okay. The reason why the gravy station is different is, it's like a real hamburger. It's so good. It's really good. It's good because the sauce is salty. Right, the sauce is also good. It's okay when you eat first. It's a first bite. It's a little bit like a fairy. Is it coke? Wow, this is probably because of the chicken. It's a little bit salty. I feel a lot. I feel a lot. It's really salty. It's a little salty and spicy. I feel like I'm all the same. What's the sauce? I feel all the chicken, but the sauce is also good. Oh, it's a meaty person. Wait, wait. Is this rice with rice? I don't see why it's oil. It's very, very good. It's very light and light. Oh, it's greasy. It's because of the hot. But if you eat rice with rice, it would be great if there's a set of chicken and meat. And it's actually good to eat kimchi. Oh, right. This is really good with kimchi. You want to eat it? Yes. Then, please slice it. It's a little spicy and salty. If you want to eat something greasy, try it once. I like it this way, but I really like Yangnyeom chicken, like the red spice one. So I think it's good to eat it with that sauce. I'm too Korean. Oh, yeah. But it's actually a really good combination. So I'm like really surprised. A combination that you never expected would be good. Yeah. I think I'll try it when I go on a trip. But if you have a coke or a coke, of course, try it. Oh, okay. Because it's Korean food, so I want to try it once in a while. I'm sure it's going to be good. I wanted to go well with the gravy sauce. But it's not greasy, so it's more like a puffer. It's like a coke and a coke. It's really good. It's really good. So I love and try the Pinoy way of eating chicken with rice. It's so saiyah how we did not have the authentic Pinoy chicken from the KFC in the Philippines because it tastes really, really, really different. Because this is actually like one of my favorite, favorite, favorite, Filipino food. So I'm happy that they enjoyed it. And it really brings me back. Here we go. Yeah, my high school memory. And I understand why Jessica keeps saying like rice, rice, rice, rice. I'm happy I saw her in the sky. Finally, I could understand. They say that they are willing to visit the Philippines next time to actually try the authentic one. I really wish they did as well with the gravy sub-bow and everything. So yeah, we'll be reading for the day as well. Yay! She's sitting up next to me.
