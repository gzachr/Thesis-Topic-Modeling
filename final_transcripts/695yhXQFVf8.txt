you're talking to someone you know my way when they see me they smile like you the way you the job you're friends with you like interactions with you and as they ask me you think that you don't have problems they easily move on like even do the passing shrewd calamities that passage things challenges of life whenever they see it for you know whenever they see you they smile like you they smile like you think that it doesn't have a problem can they do for the year in lots of smiles which means the move more beautiful at the point is you think those they are very respectful once they know that you are older than them they cannot call you by your name they will always call attach that accent open your name if you want to go to their restaurant the way this thing could say if there is an award that should be given to the best country that those that serve best in terms of details and interests or anything that has to do it serving the public things to get the award because these people they serve well they know how to attend to people well they are so new yeah they are going to come from them this is my first gift from the top of bankers you go to the bank for your own money
