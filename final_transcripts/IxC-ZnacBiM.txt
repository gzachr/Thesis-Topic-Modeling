 So the owner is not here. So a lot of the auntie. And she's the one preparing the food I guess. She went to Clark and took all the ingredients with her. And not much of a whole tonight. It's a wiggling. Wiggling? It's alive. Wizzling? Oh. It's all the sign for ice. So that's stopping its ice here at the mini-mark. I got some water. Cokes here in the ice chest. I don't have much ice. Ice cream. Okay, back on the road. Okay, we made it to our next destination. Park in the shade. Getting ready to go in and check in. I was going to show you guys where we are. You got a sign over here. I can show you. Now, we booked a room through a goda at Matt-to-Anne White Coral's Beach Resort. And the directions took us here. So we got the Google Maps brought us here to Coral View Beach Resort. So I guess they've recently changed the name to Coral View. Or maybe they've recently changed the name to White Coral Beach Resort. So we're going to go find out, but pretty sure we're in the right place. We'll find out as soon as we get to reception and try to check in. So that's what we're headed now. Try to check in. Try to go in. Try to go in. Okay, so we are in the wrong place, which was our first idea as we were in the wrong place. But I think these resorts are so close together. We probably need to be over there on the other side of this fence. Because the Google Maps brought us here and told us we had arrived. But she said they haven't recently changed their name, so we're in the wrong place. Okay, we're in the right place now. And Coral Beach Resort. I'm going to go check in. Maybe I can share the room before you guys make a mess. Small room. I think small. You can get your hair, can you stand on? Small bathroom, but they got a nice shower. Okay, we get our bags in here. Get our bathing suits on again, pretty soon. Turn on the air conditioner. Check out this property. See what they got. Somebody left some suitcases out here. Never brought our suitcases in. Our room is the first one. I put 8 to 7 foot. But this part here is very shallow. I'm going in. We're just going on back here. A lot of people back here. Some kind of event going on back here. Looks like they're going to be busy tonight. Man, there is a lot of people here for something. Oh, Christmas party maybe. They've all got bags. Some sort of Christmas party. So here is the beach area. And it looks very nice. I want to buy earrings worth the summer. Only they're following you. Maybe that's him. I hate to offend him if it's a guest. Maybe they're going. For sure the teachers will shut up in one giant bus. I do, I don't know, they're teachers. They might be, they might not be. There's a lot of them. Let me get a little close review of the beach here. So this is Batta and White Corals beach. And I notice there's a lot of resorts down through here. On our white Ian, many resort entrances here. Show you guys a view from the beach. So the first place that we went to, Coral View, looks pretty nice also. And then the price of this one I think was about 70 or 65. Something like that for tonight. Don't see this other pool area. Big place, very big. I think they have three swimming areas. This is what I saw on there. Information. Nice dining area right here. Nice place to sit. Here's the other pool. Let's go check it out. Let's go to the top. Let's see what we can see. Oh, these are rooms up here. Hey, come on. Oh, that's just more rooms up there. Never mind Liam. Never mind Liam. That's rooms. Who is bar? Maybe they only have two swimming pools. I thought there's three. That's the edge of their property there. We're going to walk down here by the beach. And then we're going to go get something to eat for dinner. We'll get a little bit of a sunset here. We're having some kind of Christmas program. Of course, some teachers. Very little. There's a lot of Christmas programs. Of course, some teachers. Very loud out here right now. Yeah, I took over the old place. So, the seal tells me that this is their Christmas party or something. A little bit crazy around here right now. Oh, please, listen to me. I'm going to go this way. Teachers Christmas party at the resort. I'm so excited. I told Cecil if we had maroon t-shirts, we could have ate free. Maybe they had a big buffet for all the teachers. We could have just blended right in. But we didn't have any maroon t-shirts. They all had matching shirts on earlier. We're kind of games now, I guess. Maybe for prizes. Really nice beach out here when the tide comes up. Just about the right size here for the trees to give some shade during the day. Cecil wants a souvenir. Liam, come on, we're going to go this way. More refrigerator magnets. See what she will choose. She willery, all kinds of stuff. We're going to have maroon t-shirts. We're going to have maroon t-shirts. We're going to have maroon t-shirts. Nice, honey. Oh, that's nice. It's a corbio. What's this? It's a plant that has a lot of water. We're going to have maroon t-shirts. This is the one. This is the one. This is the one. Black one. Are you guys with the teachers group? Are you from Baga? Oh, Belanga, okay. We're also from Belanga. Teachers from Belanga. What's the name of the food? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what's in the food. I don't know what's in the food. I don't know what's in the food. Okay, let's go eat. Let's go eat. Show you some of the rooms here by the entrance. Nice little area. We're headed to the parking lot. Show you the sign of the restaurant here. It's about two minutes drive down the road. Very close. We're entering there. I think we're entering there. They have ice here also. And then they got this little store. They got Lays Potato Chios. And Pringles. Hello. Okay, come on. Are you guys want to sit maybe under the lights here? You want to sit over here under the lights? This one or no? Okay. I thought about ordering this spaghetti, but it says her advance order. See how to order this spaghetti in advance? You're going to call the head and let them know you're coming. So I didn't get this spaghetti fried chicken. So the owner is not here. So a lot of the... Not the auntie. And she's the one preparing the food I guess. She went to Clark. And took all the ingredients with her. And not much of a whole tonight. Yeah, so we got fried chickens for me and the boys and then... Cecil will order something back at the hotel. She likes the selection there better because it's not much available here tonight. We'll go back and eat. We'll go outside and enjoy the Christmas party while we eat our food. So Cecil notice the signs are selling a Gino's ice cream. Famous ice cream maker in Belonga. Very good homemade ice cream. Not busy yet. It's kind of early still on a weeknight but it is dinner time. Come on, lay the frog along. Let's go back and eat. Okay, so what did you get? Yours is beef calder, right? And then we all got the fried chicken. We already ate and now we're all on our cell phones. Show the pool area here tonight. Looks pretty nice. See, there's a balcony up there above that other area there. So not many people here other than the teachers but I think they're all in their rooms now. I think they leave them over there. But if they're wanting to put them away, we'll request. I think that's all the ones they had over there. That's all the ones they used for the teachers. We can still sit over here. Jetsky, yes, it's much better over here. Yeah, sit. Here I am, too. So a pretty large place, they're going to accommodate a lot of people. They had a pretty big group here today. Did you catch it? No, I don't know what it is. Fronsett is a sea urchin but I don't think it is, maybe. Yeah, maybe. Someone can tell us in the comments if that's a sea urchin. I guess that's what it is. Sure looks like it to me. I don't know. What is that? What is that? We're not from here, so we're not sure. What does it look like? Seal should know. She don't know. She don't go to the beach before. Go up or sleep. It says it's a wizzling. Wizzling? It's alive. Wizzling? Wizzling? Maybe the dogs will eat it. Maybe the dogs will go check it out. It's a big one. It's a big one. It's a big one. It's a big one. Hardworking gas here, rearranged in furniture. Make me nervous now. The seals that hope the blue go will not fall on you. Sitting underneath the coconut tree. You guys ready to go now? Time to go home. I'm going home. I'm going home. I'm going home. The balance is 1,000. You see me? Yes, you got your plants all paid for. They're going to deliver them. We're right across the... I don't know exactly where we are, but Mount Samat is right there. You can see it in the distance. It's along the side of the highway here at the nursery. The seals getting here. The new bush is planted. Trying to fill in this front. Railing area. Indeed, no. They want to plant that there and the corner there.
