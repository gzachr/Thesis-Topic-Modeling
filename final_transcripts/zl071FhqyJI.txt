 Good morning guys! Good morning! Welcome to another day, juice! Oh, alright. Sorry, yeah. Before we start today's video, we just wanted to tell you about a company that is sponsoring today's video called Travel Smarter. Yes, Travel Smarter is a way to save money on travel. It's a way to get better hotel, better accommodation, better trips for less money. It's $9.97 a month, but for that you get access to a ton of huge savings. You can find like five star hotels for the price of a three star hotel or maybe a three star hotel for the price of a costum. You can save a ton of money. The thing with Travel Smarter, they don't make profit, they don't make any extra money. Unlike some other booking companies where they add a commission or a booking fee, that kind of thing, Travel Smarter don't do that.

We said this in the vlog the other day and we got a load of you guys commenting where you were heading to next. Comment below where your next adventure is going to be, where your next trip is, somewhere wherever you're going, comment below and let us know. Do you know where my next trip is? Where's your next trip, George? Coffee. And here we have it as well as an amazing breakfast here at Tappa. The way it's happening. Oh, look at this. Ah, so today it's going to involve a lot of driving. We're going to get on the scooters now. We're headed to some brand new places today. We came to the whole in November last year and we did the Chocolate Hills, Tazias, the manmade forest, or the spots that people kind of tell you to visit. So today we wanted to do something that's a little bit different, some stuff we haven't done before. I'm just going to involve a lot of driving, which I'm very happy about because last time we said that actually the drive is almost as good as the things you see. I remember the drive through the whole last time. It's absolutely incredible. So I think today we're going to try and see some waterfalls, some hills which aren't the Chocolate Hills and just see where the day takes us basically. We always like to do things that are a little bit less touristy. We've had some recommendations from some of you guys on Instagram and from some people who live here as well. We're always looking for the local experience. Are you ready? I'm just seeing if it's the way we can actually drive into these hills or not. Oh, good. Maybe this is where Neil said that you need a manual motorbike. Remember he said that about? Oh, no, really. Okay. We can try. Alright, let's go. Always the first thing we do before we go anywhere, get the off-lotion on. I know my ski toe bites today, please. Oh yeah, number two, sun cream. Number one sun cream for me, because I burn more. I burn a lot and I get bitten a lot. Yeah, true. I'm lucky. These guys are with us again today. You excited for some behold adventures? Yeah. It's nice to see some of the less touristy types of mountains. Yeah. Him on Tagen Hill. Yeah. We just said in their book comment below how you pronounce it. We've got no idea. It's really hard to pronounce. It's the only thing I'm not liking about this bike. I love it. It's fast. It's big. It's comfortable. But there's no way to put anything. There's no... Do you like pockets and sections and things and sunglasses and all kinds of things? I like compartments. Okay, look, there is this to give it a fair chance, but it's hard to open and it falls down. And you can't really... You can't get... You can't put stuff in there. You can't put your phone in there. Other than that, there's nothing. But it is nice and comfy. And I do... I know you joke about it, but I do quite like being a part of it. I'm a bit higher up on the back because it's like the seat goes like this for George and then it goes more for me and I'm like, I care. It's quite nice for me and I can like look around. Alright, hop on then. Stop that. Oh, okay. So, ready for your first ever Friday? So we're trying to find these hills. We've just come onto this dirt park and it looks like it's going to get pretty steep. I mean, I think I might have a pretty big paper load and James got a small bike at the moment. The last of the years, we just try and just see what happens in the smell. James, hey, a lot of paper last night. I'm just... Here we go. This is so nice though. Wow. So cool. It seems to be coming like a part of this village. It's really nice to have here. This resembles a road. Just about. It's cool. Oh, we're at Lotion James. We've kind of left this place. Right, where are they? Ah, there they are. This is nice. Hello. We've literally just been climbing for a couple of minutes and we've just come to this incredible view. Nice, isn't it? Insane. How's the bike doing? I don't know what's to come yet. Wow, that's amazing. Let's keep going. I think the views are going to get better from there. This is incredible. This is incredible. I've tried a look at the view, but I'm also trying to drive. Yeah, maybe drive for a few seconds. The hills are incredible. It's the same. There's a massive rain cloud coming over from the left. But I think it's going to be good. This looks... It's like Botanhas. It literally looks like... Yeah, like Botanhas a little bit. Hello. Everything's so green. We're like trying to speak with it. It's like... Wow. Wow. Look at this. Guys, this is incredible. We were thinking of going to Chocolate Hills today, which is like a very touristy spot here. But this is like your own personal version of it. You've got basically a 360 view from this point here. There's no one else here. There's no other tourists. It's ridiculous. It's so beautiful. There's just palm trees and coconut trees for marbs all the way down to the sea just there. You can see this road. And then this side, you've got these incredible hills, just like rolling and rolling with trees all on them. I'm so glad we came here. So cool. If you're kind of a whole, definitely come here if you want more of a less touristy but incredible, incredible view plan. I think we're testing you here a bit, James. Sorry about that. That's what we're talking about. Yeah, that's all right. It was all right. I was more worried about going over a sharp rock. Yeah, true. But that is... You made it. Yeah, yeah. Chocolate Philippines adventure. Yeah, that's it. This is why I love just getting a scooter and just going off exploring. Yeah. You only need a scooter. Yeah. What do you need? I'll go for it. I'll go for it. It's literally what we need. I feel like Kool-ass. Yeah. Wow. So cool. We come up here because there's a little hut behind us and unlike us, we've pre-seen the rain. We're actually finding cover before it's too late, which is very rough. We're going to fly the drone. We're going to hold up until these clouds pass, which hopefully they do. But look over there and look at that rain over these hills. That is definitely raining over there. But it's an even nicer viewpoint here. Look at them hills. It's crazy. Wow. That's exactly what the tennis is, isn't it? Yeah, so nice. Someone's had a bit of a session up here. What a spot for it. Empty run bottles. This is exactly what we wanted from today. A little bit less touristy, a bit off the beaten track, very much off the beaten track, actually. Yeah. The scooters were slightly struggling. But this is so, so cool. There's no other tourists here. There's no one here at all. We've got this place completely to ourselves. We knew the whole had way more to offer than we saw last time, which is why we came back. So cool to be seeing over these guys as well. Right. There's rain. Right. Get under the shelter. Quick. You know. Let's go. Oh, look. It's so tiny. So cute. So you've stopped up for some lunch now here. And this is the little river cruise you can do here. And it's so cool. The water is such a nice colour. I think it's coming out okay. And there's all these trees and stuff around it. And we're going to try and sit here and have some lunch. Yeah. Good drive. Oh, I'm really nice driving. Very hungry. Me too. Hot as well. Oh, you've got the whole helmet, hair sweat going on there. It's quite bad. Oh, god. Oh, god. I'm so excited. Please. Thank you. Wow, these look good. Oh, metal straws, nice. Thanks so much. Thank you. Fat best spot for lunch here on the river. Delicious mango. Look at this. I'm brother. We can use this later if it rains again. Keep these. Oh, nice. We asked for no sugar. It doesn't need it. Delicious. So a guy in that restaurant was telling Auntie that it's actually a fresh water lagoon there. And he's given us some instructions. We tried to find it. It was like cross a bridge. They cross that, cross that. We're now driving through the simple village. But it's going to be so nice calling off. It's a fresh water lagoon. If we could find it. Ice cold water, I know. I don't know where we're going to go in this video. We're just kind of driving and hoping that it's the pier. This is seems to be like a completely off the beach in Tratt. Doesn't that? There's not really anyone here. Nice. I'm in the tunnel. This is crazy. We've actually been driving this for us. We turned around. We think we're going the wrong way. Now we've come up a really random dirt track. Yeah. And we're just trying to find it. But even if we don't, to be honest, this is quite a fun adventure. Yeah, definitely. So lucky on Google Maps. We've been trying to see if we can actually see all these satellite views looking like patches of blue and then level the brain. Trying to see if there's any locals here that might get us to help us. Just say any idea is where there's like natural, fresh water lagoon there. Because it's really hot. And if we can call off, it'll be very nice. Let's go here. Hello. Hello. Hello. We're looking for the lagoon. What? We're looking for the fresh water lagoon. It's like for swimming, like a lagoon. Don't know the name. Someone just suggested it. It's close by to a swimming pool. There's swimming pool around here. Hi. Look top. Look top. Oh, yeah. Is that a swimming pool? Yeah. This way and left. This way and left. Yeah. Thank you. First left. First left. OK. We'll try. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. So we just arrived. This seems like a sujeque local spot. Already met some very friendly people here. Hello. Are you guys from Bajol? Yeah. I'm from Bajol. Nice. Very nice. Cool. Great place. Thank you. You're a bit bigger. I mean that. I'm not that bad. OK. Close your closer. Close your. How are you? I'm not good. I'm not good. No, it's coming. Hey. Nice meeting you. How are you there? I'm 100slandern chicks. Hi. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Nice to meet you. Oh, yeah. I'm jealous. Yeah, I'll be on for the beach. I just heard you. It's a good look. And it's a local kind of spring. So this is good. This is kind of what we was hoping to find and found it. Water's cold apparently, so you ready for that? Yes. Very ready for that. I'm boiling. Guys, this is not good. Walking through the mud. But oh, it's so slippery. And I'm not weighing the right shoes for this. Oh, it's all squelching in between my toes. But we've made it to the springs at the lagoon. Apparently it's ice cold water. But it looks really nice, nice water. Oh, it's literally, where we're swimming, literally where the river cruise goes through. That's pretty much. Wow. Oh, nice. This is so nice. What are you guys doing here? Wow. We're going to hop in now. Apparently it's not too cold. It's just right, apparently, refreshing temperature. These guys are reliably informed to me. They're enjoying their chicken bones and rice. Oh, you want it? They're locals here. And yeah, it's so nice to just find a local spot and sit down and enjoy the rain stops, which is also a bonus. And there's a roaps for you over there, which you should definitely do. No crocodiles, right? No crocodile. No. It's a nice. That's nice. Tough to say. That's quite cold, but it's nice. It's very refreshing. There we go. Cold? Nice. Whoo. Whoo. That is how you get in. Your turn, Nick. Yeah. Not you, Doc. And that's good. There we go. I'm so glad to see it. It's a lot colder than the waterfall yet again, kind of. He's not cold down. OK. This is what we're talking about, guys. Honestly, the local spot. That we wouldn't really have known about it unless some guy at the restaurant told us this was here. And it's honestly, we were talking to those guys up there who were eating their lunch. Sorry if there's some water on their hands, even if I wipe it, my hands got water on it. We were talking to the locals up there and they've actually travelled just to come here today. They travel like a couple of hours. They're from the whole but they've travelled across the island just to come to this spot. So feeling super grateful and lucky to have been told about this and discover it. This is such a night. I don't know, yeah. It's something so real and raw about it. In the fact we've just hopped on a scooter and just cruised here. Yeah. Unbelievable. Oh no. You can't do that anywhere else. What's your name? Absolutely unreal ride back guys. We're back at the hotel now. That was such a nice ride back. We went past some rice terraces on the way back through the palm trees, the sun starting to set. We're going to hopefully catch sunset in time. I've just got back to the hotel. Grabbed a quick coffee downstairs. Really nice stuff here, by the way. The Belian Hotel. Again, not working with them but they have just upgraded our room. So we're leaving this like small room that we're in. We're going to head to the executive room. What I don't know what that is but I'm sure we'll show you. Also, just picked up one of these. The whole natural 70% dark single origin from farm to bar dark chocolate bar. Insane. Why didn't no one tell me that the whole makes chocolate? Chocolate Hill. Oh yeah, true. I don't know if anyone knows this brand but and I don't know. Let me know if you can buy this anywhere else or if you can just get it in the hall. If it's just here, I'm going to have to stock up. I hope it doesn't melt on the plane. Quick freshen up now. We're going to head out for sunset. Get some dinner. We're going to try a new restaurant tonight I think and tag Billoran. Such a good day. Okay, I need shower. So the place we're going is called Family Beach and it's literally 5 minute drive from where we're staying. We're on the left there. One of you might believe in he watches the vlog. He's sent us a message. We're sure to send it on his story. Saying where's the message box? What's the word? Sunset in there here. No, he's a little bit further and yeah, he just sent us a message and said it looks better to be a good one tonight. We're very excited for this because obviously last night just almost here. Yeah, just that. Just a slip of her. Just wear that guy's. Because then obviously last night we tried to see the sunset but we're in the front of the island. So hopefully for night one. We're waiting for the plane. There's a little drive down here. Yeah, that's right. Perfect. Oh, cool. Nice. So tired. So another recommendation from someone who watched the video. So thanks so much guys. We're just chilling here. Couple of locals met some more new friends today. It's been a been a great day for meeting people. Just chatting, hanging out, enjoying nature. We quite have here found ourselves a little spot. Ask them if we'd sit down. They're like, yeah, of course. That was just really quiet and peaceful here. Really, really nice. What's your name? Lijin. Ah, nice to meet you. Being joined by some little cans down here. We made some new friends. See that again. You like the camera? So the screen. There you go. See yourself. Yeah. Great to show man. Great to show man. Nice. We like that song. Can you sing again? So good. I'm in dream. I'm in dream. I'm in a world. I'm in a world you seem in my back. I'm in a world I could live like I used to see. I'm like, I used to see. I used to see. Very good. Amazing. Just come back to the hotel and the Baleon have sorted us out. This is a proper upgrade. So far. Sorry Lijin, I'm doing the room tour. We have a mirror, a massive bed. This is crazy. This balcony with a view over the port. And a balcony. We are so excited guys. The room we had it before is so small. And there's no natural light. No window. That's why we didn't vlog in there. Oh, look at this. Yes, please. Wow. Unreal. You guys. Look at this view. Isn't that incredible? That's the pool where everything happens. Wow, and the color of the water and the sky here. Wow, this is cool. This is really cool. And there's a massage spot just there which you might check out later. Dream right now. We've got to go pack and unpack again. Oh nice. Wow. Thank you. Look at that. Thanks so much. We've come to a place called Smokehouse, Taekwila and City. What a smoke. Look at that. That's so cool. Thank you. Very talented. I'm going to go. We've got these insane nattoes here. Really, it looks like an emoji doesn't it? So good. Smoke into a ride.
