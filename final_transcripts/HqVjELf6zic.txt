So, hey guys, welcome to Dorcas channel, Akopalisi Simran, then we're gonna make a challenge,
so Dorcas will tell you what's the challenge.
Okay guys, hi guys, what's up guys and welcome back to my YouTube channel, it's your favourite
girl again as always, Dorcas, and thank you so much for tuning in, if you're a new subscriber,
and if you're a returning subscriber, you're most definitely welcome back.
So guys, today we are going to be doing a challenge, as you can see, you guys probably
have seen all these faces before on my channel, everybody, so we are going to introduce ourselves
with our nationality, so Simran, what's your name and your nationality?
My nationality is Sikhism, I'm Indian.
Me, Dorcas Wakanda, I'm Nigerian, nice to meet you Bishal.
So I'm Bishal and I'm from Nepal, you guys know me, I guess, you can call me Barga,
I'm from India.
India, so guys, we are going to be doing the who can speak Bisaya most challenge.
Who can be fluent, no?
Like who can, I think who can interpret.
So basically, Simran, yeah, she's not going to be participating with us because she's
all mighty, she knows every Bisaya word, she knows everything, so we are not including
Simran.
So the challenge is going to be between I, Bishal, and Barga, and Simran is going to
be asking us questions, so basically we have to know, we have to interpret what she's
saying in English, we have to know what she's saying, and if you can also reply, and in
Bisaya, we don't have any prize, nothing, but still, we want to know who is going to
be able to speak Bisaya most among the three of us.
So guys, without talking too much, without further ado, let's get started.
First question is,
That's too long!
I heard that first time.
Just listen it properly.
What's the tell in English?
What exactly the sentence was?
It's so easy!
It's not turn by turn, the first person who can.
The first you?
No, the first person, we are not going to waste turn by turn, the first person who can.
Like first finger, who came first.
With a buzzer.
Repeat the question again.
What is your language?

That's the first time I heard tabangan.
I trust you are good in Bisaya.
Do you know what is tabangan?
You don't know?
I know the place named Tabunok.
