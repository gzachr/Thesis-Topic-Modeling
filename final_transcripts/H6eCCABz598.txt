I want to say thank you, guys, because you invite me here in your studio. It's so good. Thank you so much. We appreciate it. And just before we start, can you briefly talk about yourself to the audience? Can you just give a highlight about yourself? Okay. So, I will... Yeah, no, yeah. This is your comedy. Yeah. Hello. I'm Dalagang Kuryana. I'm San Tajong. And I live here almost 20 years. Almost 20 years? Yeah, starting elementary school. Wow. So, you speak Tagalog fluently? Yeah. I think I'm more comfortable in Taglish. Really? I'm very English. Wow. I wish we were in that position. Yeah. Yeah. So, you have been here for 20 years. Sorry, no, man. Sorry, no, man. I'm not a Tagalog. Contila, I'm a basic Nalan. I'm a Tagalog. Okay, Tagalog. Let's go Tagalog. No, I'm not a Tagalog. It's finished. Yeah. Few words. Conti... Only Conti words. I can't teach you guys. Oh, okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So, maybe along the podcast, you can throw some Tagalog words in so that maybe we can also translate them into the people there. Oh, Tagalog? Yeah, maybe later, yeah. Okay. Yeah, maybe later. So, you have been in the Philippines for 20 years? Yes. Wow. So, you did your high school here? I started the middle elementary school. Elementary school. Wow. And what is like studying? Okay, you were kid, you were young. You probably didn't know that much about like being a foreigner or being into international country. But how was it? How was it going to elementary school? I'm speaking. It's so hard because when I was here, there's just a few Koreans. Okay. And even me, because I started in Pasay, Chungwa, that is a Chinese school in Pasay. And we are just around like five or below 10 students, yeah. Among more Filipino. More Filipino and Chinoy. Chinese, yeah. Half Filipino. So, we are having a hard time because we cannot speak English Tagalog and also Chinese. We're just good at Korean. Oh, okay. That's quite hard for us. So, just a little bit. Oh, okay. So, you graduated here? I mean, you did college here as well. Yes, Benel. I graduated in Benel. Okay. So, but how was that? How was like doing college here? Like literally, Philippines is your home. I don't know how often you go to Korea, but like literally, I mean, this is your home. 20 years already. Yeah, 20 years. Yeah. I think this is my first year in my life. I think it's a lot of things. I think it's a lot of things. I think it's a lot of things. I think it's a lot of things. Yeah. I think this is my first home for me because I don't have home. I'm in Korea. In Korea, yeah. So, it's just like you feel, oh, okay. And what do you, I mean, what did you take in college, if you don't mind? It's really quite different from the show business. Okay. I did export management. Export management. Oh, okay. And how did you get into the show business? Exactly. How did you get into it? Actually, my dream when I was a child, I want to become a singer. A singer? Yes. So you can sing. I want to. I'm really do. So you're video singing. You can sing. Yeah. That's my start that in YouTube. So later she will be singing, guys. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. You wanted to be a singer. Yeah. You should have bought Jaguitaria. No, you can't play guitar. Yeah, he can. Oh, yeah. For God. Yeah. So you wanted to be a singer. We really have a reason for another podcast. No, we already have. So whenever you release a music, please. I will be back. The doors are open. You can just come and definitely go and talk about more about the music too. Oh, okay. Our kasa sukasa. Yeah. You'll bring the guitar. The guitar and he will be. Yeah. He will be playing. So yeah, you're saying you wanted to be a singer? Yes. That's why I want to become a singer and artist in Korea. But yeah, unfortunately, we can hear. So. So. Oh, no. I'm in Jeonju. Jeonju. I'm in Korea. Okay. Yeah. Korea. Did I pronounce correct? Seoul. Seoul. Seoul. Yeah. Okay. I pronounce in English too. Yeah. And why, I mean, okay. So what happened during the process, the two? My mom has a friend who has a business here before. And she said that Philippine has more chip tuition fee. And you can learn also English at the same time. Because during the time, the Korea doesn't have any much English education things. Oh, okay. Yeah, that's why we came here. But I didn't really, I didn't notice that. Or I will continue my study here in Philippine because I really want to go in Korea for my college. Because I want to get my music course in Korea. Oh, yeah. But unfortunately, or. Yeah, I think, yeah, I'm one of lucky persons because I started here after elementary, high school, and college. And I had a lot of Filipino friends and also my Korean friends. So, yeah, I'm pretty good to live here. Yeah. I think it's a normal movement. I suppose I stay here for six months already nine years. I'm here for like nine years soon. Nine years? Yeah. I'm not going to graduate in them. Oh, really? Yeah. I study here. Where? I mean, Batangas. Oh, Batangas. I study here in Batangas. Oh, you came here in BGC. And now we are here in BGC. Just like, first I came here to study. After graduating and stuff, I was like, you know what? I don't want to go back home. Oh. So, what can I do here? So, I found a job. So, working now. And then I'm just decided to say in the Philippines. That's good friends. Yeah. So, that's it. It's like at the foreigners as well. They were just going to come in the Philippines for a week. Yes. And then when you know this whole life, one month has passed already. You get it. Wow. Same. Same as you. So, it's like your plan first was, okay, I mean, the plan from your parents here. Yeah. My plan is just graduate until the high school. Okay. After that, I want to try the Korean college because there is a lot of big campus. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I want to feel it. But, yeah, my mom said, Sandra just graduated and I went to school in Philippines. So, your mom and your dad did like, different career? I'm the one who want to go back to Korea. Korean. But my mom wants to stay here to learn more. Okay. So, is the Korean child, how did you adjust the Filipino culture? I think until now, I'm keep like... I just think. Yeah, because there's a lot of different culture and different persons, even I live here more than 20 years. I have a lot of challenge also myself as a foreigner. Because, yeah, like every year we have a change and developing the world's economy. It's totally different too. So, I'm keep like challenging myself as a foreigner here in the Philippines. But, thankfully, because a while ago, like we talked about, Filipinos are really hospitable. Yeah, they are really hospitable. So, that's why they are really friendly. They teach me a lot. Yeah. Yeah. So, I have a good time here. Okay. So, since you were mentioned, you still adjust yourself. Yes. So, living in the Philippines as a child, you left Korean when you were too young. Yes. Did you encounter a counter shock when you went back to Korea? Every year. Actually, every year I have a counter shock in Korea. Yes. Because the bus subway is totally different from the Philippines. Wow. Yes. Because the transportation here, more on-graph, or taxi, or FX, Jeepney. But in Korea, we don't have Jeepney. Okay. That is one of the simple culture shock for foreigners. When you come back to your country, there's a culture shock. Oh. Same thing happened to us. I think because in Korea, technology is quite fast. That's fast, fast, yeah. It's really advanced. So, every time I go back to Korea, they are not having a wallet. They don't have cash. Really? Because their card is already on the phone. Yes, on the phone. So, they are just a spam. Yeah. It's really quite good, but it's so hard to me because I'm always preparing my cash. But, okay, yeah. You don't have change? Yeah, yeah. It was like, in here, it's either you have cash or sometimes now, fortunately, you have G cash. Yes. But like, some of us, I don't even have G cash. I wish I had, I should open a G cash. I think. It's really good. But my Korean friends, when they came here in Manila, they are shocked because even the convenience store, they are not accepting credit cards. Credit card, yeah, yeah, yeah. Because the Korean just like bringing credit cards or just, yeah, they installed the card in the phone. Yeah. They don't have any cash or G cash. Yeah. Because no G cash is in here, it's Korea. Yeah. It makes life much easier. For sure. Yeah. But I think it's like, if you lose your phone, you will lose a lot of things. You lose your life. You lose your life. You lose your life. Wow. So yeah, and let's get back still when you were like, younger, adjusting. Like, do you feel more foreign in Korea or in the Philippines? I have a good question. Oh. Now. Yeah. Like, in a, wow. Now, I think, yeah, my Korean friends telling me that I'm like, like, Philippina. Uh-huh. Yeah, because I don't know, like, when I'm in Korea, I don't know how to get in the Philippines. I don't know how to get in the venue or place that they're saying. So hard to write a somewhere. You're not familiar with the location. Yeah, I'm not familiar in the transportation too. I don't know where to go. To go, yeah. Even there is a signage or whatever in the position. But it's hard to find, for me, look for them. So yeah, they're saying that in Korea. Ah, in Seoul, it's a Korean thing. It's like they're saying that I'm not look like Korean anymore. So, and so let me ask you this. What is something a habit that you have, which you have, I mean, gave that to go from the Philippines, that you Korean friends that don't have it? This is one thing after pandemic. Yeah. I keep using alcohol. Okay. Okay. But Korea, yeah, they are not like having an alcohol or an alcohol spray. They're just washing their hands. They're handing them. Yeah, but for me, like, always. Yeah, it's always. Okay. And it's weird for them. Actually, when the pandemic ended, I was also like that. You see alcohol all the time. Like, wherever they're somewhere, I'm like, but I think it's a time goodbye. I just stopped. Yeah, it's a habit. Yeah. Yeah. It was like one year of us putting on a date. Yeah, yeah. Like, I mean, during the pandemic, in a second, you said that before when you came here, it's because your parents had a connection or something. Yes. So why Philippines? Why exactly? We choose Philippines because we have the connections or we heard about the country. Oh, actually, that time, I don't have any idea about Philippine. I didn't know that there is a Tagalog mother, a love, a shred of Philippine because I heard they can speak English. Yeah. All over the southern Asia, I heard Philippine are really good at English because in other countries, they are more focusing to their mother language. That's right. So that is one of the points that, because I want to learn English and chip tuition fee compared in Korea. Yeah, that's why I think my mom picked here. And it's good because her friend is already like stable, having a stay good life. Yeah, good life here in the Philippines. Yeah. And how long did you take for you to learn Tagalog? Me? I think like one year. Yeah, because I had a six months full tutor. We have ten years with those two. We have ten years, no Tagalog. They will say, you're not going to say Tagalog. But need to because you have a score, great. If you did not get the 75, you can't accelerate. But things like you were a kid as well. I think as a kid, we kind of learned faster. We don't have an issue. We don't have to worry about paying the bills. You know, we don't have problems in life at all. You have a point. You know, like us now, we came here super with 100 and one problems already. And it's like, you learned Tagalog today, tomorrow if they ask you, oh, I forgot already. Sorry, sorry no man. Sorry no man. But I think that's not an excuse. We still got to learn Tagalog. And nothing we kind of get much better too. Of course. But they need to understand. The foreigner, they don't speak the language. That doesn't mean we don't love the country. Yeah. I mean, I get questions, oh, you're here for almost ten years. You don't speak the language yet. I said, Philippines are so smart. Yes. I don't have to because the guys speak very good English. You guys are hospital. And I can't say that enough. They make an effort to communicate with you. You don't have that kind of thing in another country, right? That's what I mean. I think we made a video. What is like traveling in the Philippines with a zero Tagalog. And many foreigners have said, you don't need to speak Tagalog. As long as you speak English, you're good. Yeah. You're good. Everybody needs to speak English. It makes the country in the world. That's for sure. That's for sure. And sorry. Yeah, you go. No. Yeah, I mean, Philippines, they love Japanese. They love Korean. Yeah. They love it. How is that for you? I mean, you like it? You were shy. What is this? Now I realize because about the K-Waves. Yes. Yes. That you're talking about K-POP, K-Drama, K-Movie. Do you like those things, by the way? Yes. It's a big thing. Yeah, she's the star that I have seen here. During I joined in I Love OPM. Because I started my show base from there. OPM? Yeah. In ABSABN, there is a singing competition with the foreigners only. Only. And we are just singing the OPM songs. And I realized there, Philippines really love Korean. Because we have a lot of Korean contestants. Not only me. There's from Korea, also like Band J-Morning or Johan. One of the singers here in the Philippines too. And I saw a lot of Filipino fans are really cheering for the Korean. If they are saying Korean, kaa-te. And you guys see, but they are really friendly so far. So I think that K-Wave is really big power to us. K-Wave is the same as K-POP? K-Wave is total. The culture in general. Because it's big here. I have seen you in some events with some artists. I wanted to ask you. From all these artists, who is the most famous artist that you got on your phone number? Like that you have on your phone. The most famous artist. Super star that you have. Phone? Yeah. Contact. Because you are not sharing the contact. I don't know. Who is the most famous artist singing at the moment? In my phone. Yeah, that you have met. That I met. Yeah. I think BTS. BTS? Yeah. Or BLACKPINK. You have met them already? Yeah, because I was a translator for their concert and events. When they came here. Last year, right? This year. Yeah, yeah. Yes, March. But BTS is like before pandemic. And I mean, how did they contact you? How did you get in touch with these people? Local promoter or agency are contacting for the translators and other agencies. That, ah, Kessandra, can you help me to look for the Koreans? Translator or host? Korean to Tagalog. Korean to English. To English or Tagalog or Tagalog English to Korean. Because some of the Filipinos can speak fluent English. Yeah. So you met BLACKPINK? Yeah. You like BLACKPINK? I don't love, I love them. Really? I love them. How are they in person? They're nice. Yeah, they're nice. And they're so beautiful and so pretty. Yeah. I think the time I'm going to say that I'm going to, I'll be fainting. Please give me water. Give me water. It's real, it's real. I used to do reaction music before. I used to react to the music. Man, as she said, it's super pretty, super beautiful. Yes. And it's the same with BTS, right? So it's like, the super duper famous video in one day, it goes like 100 million views. Yes. And how did you feel meeting these people as a content creator? Did you feel wow, I'm really going too far? But I need to be patient myself because I'm working there as a translator not for the content creator. So I need to fade out my... Like to be professional. Yeah, I need to face of myself as a content creator. Yeah, I'm just in for translating. You did not ask for picture? We can't. You can't. Not alone. Yes, not alone. Some of them, if we are getting close or the manager giving us permission to take a picture, we can, but not all of the artists. Wow. So that's why there's a lot of Filipino fans asking me that, do you have any selfie with them? But not all. It's very like restricted. Yes, so strict. So they're stand-able, it's professional. And to reduce the accident or issue, so that is one of the points. Because I've been in this position, they will think that you are a fan and the fans will try to get there. Yeah, because sometimes it happens in other countries and also here. So we want to avoid the accident or any issue. That's why. And you want to keep doing your work as a translator. As a translator, yeah. Not easy. Thank you, Rio. Thank you. Thank you so much. We have a coffee here. Wow. Wow. Our sponsor. Oh, sponsor. So this is... Oh, it's not all. This is Rio, guys. So this is what it's for me. Let me see what I got. Oh, sorry. Just gonna open like that. Wait. I think this is yours. Oh, thank you. That's mine. Okay. Oh, yeah. This is your surprise. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. Cheers. How does she see she is in Korea? Done. Done. Done. Done. Done. Mmm. I love water. I love too. You love too? Yes. Okay. And how often you go to Korea? Every year, you know, not really. Once a year? I see. Yeah. One or twenty. Like, when is the best period that you would advise us to go to Korea? Oh. I recommend for spring and fall. Oh. Yes. Because in spring, there is this blossom, like flowers. Like you cannot see here in the Philippines, right? Yeah. So I want to share with my Filipino friends too. And for autumn or fall. Because the leaves are changing color to red. Okay. Okay. And also you can see it here in the Philippines. So I want to record. Recall it. Recall it. Okay. So at least now we know when we should go there. Yes. You have winter there, right? It's snowing and everything. December to February. It's very cold. Very cold. Negative 16. Negative 16. And how do you adjust your body to develop in all weather? That's why I'm not going to Korea during winter. Oh, okay. Very smart. Yeah. Let me ask you this. You said that you wanted to be a singer. But it happened maybe still time. It's never too late. And how did you get into content? How did you get like to your content? Like, oh, okay. I'll be doing single. But at the same time, I'll be having this event. And then you mentioned about the radio session. And how did you get into that? All my first, actually, a while ago, I said that I want to become a singer only. I just want to release my album, release my music. That's my goal. You write as well? Yeah. I'm practicing. Okay. But one of the producer from Korea told me that Sandra, if you want to become an artist here in the Philippines, you should study or practice more about hosting or acting because in a lot of Filipino artists, they are really good at multitasking. Like Sarah, Heronimo, can do acting, singing at the same time. And also, Regene is doing hosts and also doing acting too. Well, first time, it was really awkward for me because I just want to keep going to singing Korea only. But thankfully, there is an audition program in T-Radio channel. And I started there, Radio DJ, and also there. Like, I'm friend of Dasuri. Yeah. So Dasuri is like, keep pushing me. I tried to shoot for the live vlog because for the covering the songs, it's just copyright issues. So try other things that you can do because you can speak fluent Tagalog. So it's really some, like, you can use it. I'm using like, in Tagalog or English, or Korean. Pardon? You're music in Tagalog or Korean? That is my unique concept because I'm translating the Korean to Tagalog and Tagalog song to Korean lyrics. So I just translate the songs. That's why I have a lot of opportunity because of that, I joined in ASAP with Yankei, La and Jonah. One of the legendary people. Yes. I sang together in ASAP. And after that covering, I had an opportunity also to have like translating Ben and Ben live in Korean version. I'm the one who translate the Korean song. And they sang in YouTube channel so you can look for it. What they sing is what you translate in Korean. That's one of my skills and I want to become too. Because there's a lot of Filipino songs that are really good but the Korean doesn't know about the meaning because it's in Tagalog. So I want to translate it so my Korean friends know it has a really beautiful lyrics. That's awesome. So when you translate, you don't translate literally. You don't make a version of it. Because the lyrics are made of song, but because of the culture difference, I changed some vibe there. But mostly I'm stick to the lyrics. That's why it's famous. That's why it's successful. Surprise. I didn't know you have all this talent. I think this is what I was telling in the beginning. It's kind of really important for us to have a person like you in here to kind of inspire other people as well. You get it like speaking English, speak Tagalog, speak Korean, and you're still chasing your dreams. And so eventually in the future we're going to have an album. Oh yeah, that's my dream for the next year. Next year. You will come back here. We will make a list of these Korean songs. Let's hear it please. When you put your album there, or even if you release a single, just let us know. You can come. We're going to talk more about the music. And any planning to release a music anytime soon? Sure. Up me. Yeah. I'm not sure, but maybe hopefully next year. Do you guys in studio already? No, not yet. Yeah, I'm working just writing myself. You have a studio already? Oh, guys, if you studio wants to promote Sandra? Yeah, yeah, guys. If you have a studio, you're looking for smart artists, intelligent, talented. Okay. She will do it. It means you have someone, multi-tasking. No, someone will speak a lot of bilingual. Multi-lingual. Multi-lingual. Yeah. So imagine if she put a hit in Tagalog. And then in Korea, and then in English, your studio is gone. Amazing. On the top. So all the info, you can check Sandra's info on the description below for sure. And you guys will be amazed to have her on a team. You guys make me pressure. No, come on. Come on. Like, you have mentioned all these big names that have been with you already. That you have worked with. Your accomplishment, where she has just to support. And I was like, from all the people, okay, besides BTS and BLACKPINK, like here in the Philippines, from all the people that you have mentioned, who did you have them, I mean the most to work with. Oh. Oh. Don't say all of them. All of them. But it's quite hard to choose. But for me, because some artists, I already met three times four times. Yeah. Because thankfully, because they have a lot of events here. Oh, yeah. So I'm getting closer to them. So for me, Pagan Bin. Huh? Yeah. She's Korean art actress. He's in Philippines. Extra-ordinary Uyong-U. I never heard of her. Yeah, that's K-Drama. Oh, yeah. I've heard her for twice here in the Philippines for the fan meeting. But she's so kind. And she's so angel. Because mostly, like artists can't remember the translator's name. Oh, really? Yeah, because they are just... Yeah, you should say it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We are just translator and we have a busy day. And also mostly, like we are working with the manager, not for the artists. So, yeah, some of them don't know about our name, but Pagan Bin. She remembers. Yes, my name. Oh, good question. Yeah, he called me Sandra. So I was really impressed. Like, oh, you memorized the name of the translator. Not only me, the other translator too. And for the actor, I think, yeah, there is a lot, but... Huangi-nyeok and Park Kyung-sik, yeah, two of them. They are also Korean actor, but I met them also for twice already. And they are so kind. They are based also in the Philippines. Here in the Philippines. And how is the Korean community then? Like here in the Philippines. How is the Korean community? Like, do you guys come together to celebrate maybe an event? Oh, yeah. I think we have a small industry here in the Philippines for Korean community, but not all. Because for students, there is a student community. Yeah, for the business, there is a business community. Because we have an association too. Like Korean business association. We have a different part. We have a love bomb or like glueson bisaya minda now. And you mentioned that even the actress, she called your name Sandra. So even for Koreans, you use your English name. Yes. And you can't really embrace that. Yeah, I don't know why, because I'm more comfortable in my Sandra. Actually, my mom wants to change my name. Yeah. You are legal name in Korea. But I don't want to, because my Korean name is In-son, but my father gave me. That's why I cannot change it. Change it. But when you go to Korea, they call you In-son. In-son. Yeah. In-son. Yes. In-son is a kind person. Oh. Yes. So I cannot. So you cannot be mad then. You got to be kind all the time. Oh my God. So, and I think at the beginning, you mentioned about Filipino, I mean, hospitality and stuff like that. How did you get, I mean, did you get that in two as well? Since you have lived here for, I mean, for, I mean, 20 years. Oh, yes. Yes. But, yeah, I can't tell not all, but all mostly, because I see if they are inviting me to their home or house, their party. Yeah, Filipinos are really good at party, right? But even they don't, they don't know about me. They prepare a lot of foods. Sandra, ka inaka inaka. Their pancreas. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And spaghetti is a lot. And they said, doesn't it just bring your friend? Come over, yeah? Come with your friends. It's okay. Yeah, more the merrier. Yes. That's why, like, first time to realize, why they are not like having a string. And see, yeah, yes. Kind of behavior. Or word. And what about the Filipino food? Okay. You have, you guys Korean food is well known a lot of other word. Where are you? Okay. Like, it's your place. When you guys eat or what do you guys mostly eat? Is it Korean food or Filipino food? Oh. I think Korean food. Korean food, yeah. Yeah. We always go to Korean restaurants. Yeah, we always go to Korean hot. Oh, I should visit my restaurant. You have a restaurant? Yeah. My Tita has a restaurant in Malate. What's the name? Miga. Let's go there. That's why I... You see, we see that's not a problem for us. We always go to... What is this? Haru? Haru. We always go to Haru. Oh. Yeah. It's like, I love the food. We love the food. But we definitely go to your restaurant. You invite us to see a movie. Okay, we go. We invite us to... But the investors you eat? We will come. Definitely. Definitely. We have 30 minutes before. That's exactly right. We love food. Please. Yeah, we're going to go there. We're going to go there for sure. We're going to go there. So, what's the number of foods you love the most then? I know you eat a lot of Korean food. Oh, I love peanut butter. Have you tried it? It's the pizza one. Yeah, the pizza one. Is the pizza one? Yeah, I really love it. Ampala, yeah, with... I can't eat that. Oh, really? I can't eat it. I don't like bitter food also. Oh. How do you like that? I really love Ampala, yeah. The bitter... Yes. The green one. Yeah. It's really bitter. Yeah. Yes, but it's really good to help. Yes, it's really good. Yes. Everything is bitter. It needs healthy. Yes. I love the peanut... I tried... I tried... I love Bhagon. That's why... I love mango. The three-faced... Yeah. Mango with... Oh, okay. I love that too.

But there is a lot of herbal ingredients. Oh, I like the color, yeah. But not bitter. I don't eat it. Yeah, not bitter. But there is a jinseng inside. Jinseng. Jinseng? Oh... What's that? Jinseng? Yeah, the jinseng. It's kind of Korean food. It's a root. Yeah. Oh, okay. Oh, it's nice. It tastes like ginger, actually. Yeah, you're right, Korea. Yeah. But it's stronger than ginger. I hope you should try it. It's very nice. It's very nice. Yeah, because our cuisine is more like Portuguese... Like, Spanish cuisine. I don't know if you have tried... Like, Spanish food should try it. Please recommend it. There's a lot of beans. Beans. Beans with love. Red meat. Oh, later, please recommend it for the Spanish food. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Right, so, yeah. So it's like... It's totally different. Because when we talk about Korean food... Mm-hmm. Like me... If you talk about Korean food, I'm just going to think about the meat. Yeah. You get it. It's like, oh. Let's go eat some Korean food. No, but the noodles from Korean food. Oh, the noodles too. Yeah, yeah. I love the noodles from... Yeah, I love the noodles. And I love the... You know, like... The egg. You know the egg, the poor one, that bad? Ah, steam egg. Oh, steam egg. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Karan-chim. How do you call it? Karan-chim or Dal-gel-chim. Oh, okay. Yeah, and I love it. So, say, do you have any question? Yes. Well, you have many. How authentic are the Korean restaurants here? Oh! Oh! It's hard. It's hard. It's hard. It's hard. Yeah. I know because before, there's a Brazilian restaurant here. And they asked me how authentic it is. What that means? I said, well, we have different styles. So, even though this one is not authentic, 100%, but I do have some places that cook the same style. But same. Yeah, you can create too. Yeah. There is some not authentic, but there are. Because they are using Korean ingredients and Filipino veggie. Oh! Yeah, because we can bring every ingredient. Everything from Korea. Yes, it's quite expensive. And even here, the vegetables and meat are getting higher and higher. That's why, but it keeps Korean owners or managers. They want to keep the taste. Because, you know, the Filipino customers nowadays, they are really brilliant. And they have a lot of ideas. Because they saw a lot of YouTube channel. And also, they are traveling to Korea. They know the taste. The true taste. That's why there is some authentic food. But some are not. I know. Yeah. I kind of like this kind of fusion. For example, we are in the Philippines. So, we should not expect something... Be authentic. Because it's their taste. That's the same happened with Chowarma. Because I live in Middle East before. And I ate the authentic Chowarma. When you get here, it's different. But because it's made for the Filipino. So, it's like even though they bring the food in here, they kind of just a bit to the Filipino. And that's okay. That's how to put the food. It's like a whole piece. Exactly. And that's awesome. That's awesome. Yeah, of course, otherwise nobody will buy it. Exactly. And I think it's a business. It's a business. Like if you want to open a business, you got to think on the market. Yeah, that's true. What do people really want in a whole how? How to sell yourself, literally? Yeah. For Korean food, I think we are just reducing more sweet and oily one. Yeah. Yeah, we are... Yeah, of course, you guys eat a lot of veggies. Yeah, veggies, steam, fermented. Yeah, yeah. I love that. Yeah, kimchi. Kimchi is fermented. I like kimchi, but it's so spicy. I want to eat, but I like the taste, but it's so spicy. Oh, really? Yeah. You want to ask me if I like kimchi? Oh. He loves it. No. No? No. Why? Why do you have a different answer? So it's like this, right? So, as an Africa, we don't really have fermented food. So, for me, it's like... Oops. I'm getting worse. I'm getting worse. I'm getting worse. I'm getting worse. I'm getting worse. I'm getting worse. Yeah, last question. Let's go before. Okay. Okay, so I mean, as I was saying, so we don't really have fermented food. And it's totally a different paladar, like the different taste for me. Whenever I eat something fermented, something sour, it's not something that I wouldn't eat. I would eat, but not like every day. I like because my mom used to make that vegetable. I forgot the name of the cabbage. What is the name of the cabbage? It's a different kind of cabbage. And I remind of my mom. She used to cook that kind of cabbage. So that's why I like the kimchi. Oh, the kimchi? Yeah. What is the name of the cabbage? The cabbage. The kimchi is made of cabbage. Yeah, cabbage, pet you. Yeah, that's the name. Oh, okay. And just before we go, right, I mean to your Filipino audience, that, what message would you give to them? And please let us know how you feel about the podcast. Oh. And can you sing before we leave? Yes. Yeah, please. Please. Oh. This mic is good. It's good. The mic is good. Yeah, the mic is good. The mic is good. Oh, my God. I even need to get that. I don't know what to say, but I love this song. Oh, my God. Don't be shy. It's your time to shine. I'll sing other song. Yeah, yeah, for sure. What is that song about? Back that thing that you were singing? What is it about? This is telling that I'm the one who has like one side love. Yeah. My heart is like for yours. It belongs to you. No. Uh, beating? Like beating for you? Yes. Oh, it's like. I hope he's also beating for me. Yes. Okay. Okay, good. So definitely next year we're going to have an album. Let's pray on that. And I think it's just like that vase I'm going to give it to you. Just push yourself. Oh. Okay, because I know you might find some issues on the road and salad up, but it's like, if you believe on yourself, do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. What's like? I'm really. Oh, don't try. Just before we finish. Because it's like, if you don't believe on yourself, no, no one else would believe. If you don't do it for yourself, no one else will do it. And don't wait for the right time.
