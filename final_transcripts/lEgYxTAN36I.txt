 Alright, we'll get out of here. Oh, you're so happy. Look at him smiling at us. I want to get new food, but I don't have any food. Welcome, Jesse Polo. We got dropped off in the middle of the fracking door. Bye, buddhist. Bye, buddhist. We typed in mystical cave on grab. But sadly, we are an hours walk away from the actual location. They're a regular earthquake here. This is the first we've got to see of going into the mountains. We went much further than we anticipated into the mountains. That's where it took us way past the mystical cave. We're just at this point trying to solve it, getting a little bit of value out of our grabway that we took too far.

Wow, it's a little neighborhood down here. You're father, Doc. It's your father.
