 guess where we are and guess where we're going. We are finally here in BGC. We're going to do our first depression of this place. Yes. You've been asking and asking and asking and it's about the month later. So let's check it out. But first we got to go this makes me look hungry so let's get some food. Oh wow, I can already see like this is so different from where we stayed before. We stayed in that area called Kesson. Yeah. It was a lot more narrow streets. Yeah more people more people. But it was nice and clean there too. Well this one is another level. This one is incredible. You can just see all these skyscrapers all the way around us. Yeah big big towers around there. Yeah looks really cool. And it looks really new and modern as well. Yeah but we have to try also food. Yes. So see you at the restaurant. We're back at our favorite restaurant there who probably guessed it from outside. Yeah. Yellowtail and we have the garden pit sire and figured since you are slow the taste test let's do one this time too and I got some red pepper sauce. Oh yeah. We like this spicy nuts. Mm-hmm. Best pit sime feel I've been so far. Oh and actually made us come back for it. Oh yeah it's a good last time. Ah not be needing so maybe better. We also got some orange juice. Yes. No I have apple juice. So cheers to rats. The environment also really cool. Looks like a gas station. All right let's eat up again. Checking out this is cool. Yes and we are back and finally full. Oh finally. Now we have some energy for a storing BGT. Is this a what? Starbucks drive trip? What? That's cool. I've never seen that before. Yeah that's new. Or I mean maybe a burger and burrito. Ah there is our yellow cat as well. Ah. Ah. A bunch of nice restaurants here. Yes. We like it. We're starting here at a place called Crossroads and we're going to walk up towards a really cool mall. Yeah. So like a Japanese mall or something. Japanese pancake. This is a Japanese pancake. Japanese pancake. Oh good times. Shout out to Thailand video in Chiang Mai. Yeah wow look at these buildings that's incredible. Ah they're so tall. I really like this one here. This one. Because it's no this one because it's so white and I feel often like these skyscrapers our time when they're white they're starting to get a bit worn. Yeah. They have to don't paint them enough. Yeah I see what you mean. It's really nice. I like this one the most. Oh big ones. I'm crazy. Yeah. Yeah really nice to all sweet all the glasses as well. Yeah we don't have much of this in war. I think. No. Have we passed here? Or is it? Yeah we can pass. Oh. Oh. There we should say football. Mo. Till here. I didn't know that actually played football. Oh so what an importantness come. Whoa. That's cool. That's awesome. 500 years. Yeah. Let's keep grinding the YouTube channel. Yeah but it seems like this is the nicest place in Philippines or at least that we have checked out so far. Yeah. Yeah. Really clean really nice and even a big football thing. Yeah I didn't know a Filipino's place too much football. No. I thought that played basketball. That was their thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You remember when you played basketball with them? Oh. And we were going to throw it over the net or into the net. Yeah. When we walked in the Amazon. What's the cause of the market? It was in the divorcee market. It was in the backstreet. It was really cool. A lot of friendly Filipinos there. Yeah. It was a little bit of pressure. Yeah. I have not been throwing a vast of proveniors. I was just kidding. I could have done it the fifth time. Nah, nah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well I've looked at this chair. That's crazy. Oh. That's cool. I think in 500 years when we got that car I want to have one of these chairs as well. Yeah but I feel like your computer chair will be like this in 500 years. Yeah. Because this looks like the old ritten or something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe this was what we had for computer chairs 500 years ago. Oh. Oh. Imagine sitting in that big couch with a chandelier over and working. Oh. It's a tough thing away. It's awesome. What is there so much of this? Is this normal for like this area to buy chairs like this? No. No. You'll get this. Ah, we're up there by the way. Oh. Okay. Well it's the one for you. It would be very cool. I wonder how much they cost. Imagine us just buying a chair. We rented a new apartment by the way. I don't know if we showed you. No, I don't think so. No. But yeah. But maybe we find one of those chairs each and we put them on our backs. Yeah. We carry them up to CGC. The problem is that then we can't afford flight home. Probably. Maybe need to sell a libero. Yeah. Get in there with that. But can we go? I don't know. What do you see? After all the camera at the same time, watching the traffic. I'm a little bit scared to run when the police are there. Ah, yeah that's cool. I think we have to cut up on a little bit now because it's very noisy. Okay, so just cross the road here. And like I mentioned in that other video, we have been living in Makati where the road is a bit more chaotic, not much. We live in Kosovo where it was most chaotic. Yeah, that's true. But when we were in BGC the first time, we were just dropping by so we haven't explored it yet. No, we wanted to see this memorial park. We've pretty much just saw a few minutes. Yeah, if we want to see that we have a video about this. The first impression. But it seems so we'll make a proper first impression when we decided to walk the other direction. Yeah. So today. But the first thing I noticed was how organized the traffic is here. And like we just came from India. We were used to just walking across the road with all the cars and then the cars will calculate your speed. But here we have to wait like, yeah, pull all the traffic through this. I want to know how. Very weird. So that's something I don't like with the well-known areas. Yeah, I don't think it's was like this where we've stayed before either. You can just walk when you're you're able to, yes. But of course the traffic flows much more smoothly. Yeah. So. But now I think we actually are going to J-Walk. Yeah. Oh, look at my arm. Very nice. Yeah, it worked. How much do you think you have to pay to buy a condo in this area? I start to say, maybe 50 million pesos. Don't feel like that. No, that's too much. 20 million? Yeah, we think. Yeah. Maybe you can tell us. Yeah. I think so. I think this looks very nice. This is actually this area in general. I think is more built up in the area that we live in the cold bargain in Norway like our local city. Yeah. Oslo, that's the capital in Norway. I don't think even that is close to this. Oh, this is pretty extreme, I would say. It's a bit like Dubai, I think. They also have this huge skyscrapers and New York. A new version of New York. Yeah. I think the closest thing for me that I've seen compared to this would probably be the nice report of Bangkok. Oh, yeah. If you were to say something from my experience at least. Yeah. Maybe. Hello. Hello. Don't don't don't don't. Yeah, but they look crazy. Actually, I'm going to show you around the camera. It's totally insane. But what I find a weirdest about this place is that if you just take a taxi like 15 minutes, the entire place looks completely different. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just this area and then they're in like year, 3000 or something like that. But something also I mentioned in the other video is that after we came to BGC and I started, I've got neck problems. Yeah, because you're always walking like this here. It's not because you're looking at me all the time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm telling Rick's. Ooh. I'm so fancy. Yeah, there's a level of this upper class store in the walker. Green match. I thought I was walking up front. But you also were at the unique look. Oh, yeah. Yeah. What my T-shirt? I lost like half my T-shirts when we were flying from was it India? Yeah, I had some car online India. I forgot the pen and background. Yeah. Yeah. We had the weight overload in our backpack. Yeah, we tried to be like tricky and take the clothes out of our bag. Yeah. And then we're going to go back to the bathroom and pick them up on pretty much checked into the flight. Yeah. But everything there was so much stuff because we needed to like sign up for something. Yeah. And to the Philippines we were always vaccines and stuff. So we just got a left arm eye and we forgot half our clothes in the bathroom. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You tried to get back that security was closed for something. Yeah, I think they kind of and they understood our plan. Yeah. So just I am not there. What you're talking about? I'm not sure if you must. Yeah, I just left. Oh, and here is that mall we're going to. No, are we here? Oh, but this is called Mitsukoshi. Mitsukoshi mall. Yeah. Really cool. Yeah. And if you want to check out the video we see this small you can check out this video. Yeah, we have checked it out. Yeah, they're going back here afterwards, but I want to go exploring a little bit more first. Oh, that's cute. They're having a building under construction. I saw some video of some other first people that went to this mall and when I think the mall was brand new then and the pavement it was so steep so all the cars couldn't drive off the ramp. But I think they've changed it to give it a little bit more slope now because I think this was a much a lot more sharp like a few years ago or something. Yeah, probably many complaints. Like nobody can enter. No customers. We need this big motor to go to this mall. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It looks like we're getting into the outer area of BGC here. Yeah, lots of construction there. I guess this place just keeps being built up and built up and built up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're going to say it's one of the mall popular. I'm going to say it's from what I understand. Yeah. Okay. Not sure. I don't know how if it's many locals live or if it's businessmen and how it is. I think it's a little mix of everything. Yeah. It's called global city so I would imagine. Yeah, that's true. Everything. I wonder if they're going to expand this until they hold manilla. You think in like a hundred year perspective or something? Do we dare to corks? No. No. I'm just over it. I'm not paying. Okay. Yeah. Did you make it? Oh yeah. This guy stopped from me. All right. I was so confused. I'm not walking. I stopped thinking. That's the old appreciation. Oh dude. Oh this is the JPMorgan Chase Uncle. What? Yeah. I have this here too. You never heard about it but it's so. You haven't? No, it's really nice though. It's a big banking company. I think it's a big American. Oh you knew it. Hello. You destroyed my sketch. Wow. Uptown Park. Oh this is cool. This has to be a back. It's not. I don't know. I think it's the opposite of the street like a park. Oh look like it. Oh that's interesting. You have like this white house like the American white house and then you have this newer version with the glass at the top. Mm. Very cool. Oh that's nice. This area is super cool. Uptown Parade. So we're uptown. I guess this whole area is uptown. Yeah. School. School service. Oh yeah. It's school buses. We're yellow ones. Cool. This area is so crazy. What shocks me the most is again just a contrast from one area of the city to the next. Oh this area is. Oh I'm mind blown. I've never seen anything like it and especially when you get from those other places like Couson and such and then you jump straight into this and it's a bit overwhelming. The way I understand it is that Philippines. It's like a bunch of city like a Couson, Macarte, a bunch of others and it just grew together right? Yeah yeah. That's some guys that vloggers. That's us. Like and subscribe. Yeah what was it called Metro Manila? That's like all of them. I have no clue. It was something maybe you can tell us in the comments. Yeah. But anyway I guess I figured that's how everything is a little bit different from one area to the other. Yeah yeah yeah and also of course this is like a big city I think compared to every other we've been. How many people live there actually? How many was it like a 20 million? Was it that much like in a whole area? Maybe it was something like that. I'm not sure. It was over 10 I'm pretty sure. And it was interesting jumping from Macarte where it was a bit more calm and then Couson, chaos but people so friendly and then to this BGC buildings is just so crazy. People are really nice here too. Yeah yeah we have not met too many people here. No actually we only talked to the woman who sold us pizza. She was nice. Yeah we really liked her. You need good pizza after. Brandy's doughnut. Brandy's. Well that's good. Brandy's. I think those tri-fit guys I talked about this one. Is it good? I don't know. I think it's maybe we have to try it. Oh like I watched the doughnut at the roof out there. Maybe a giant could come and hit it. Yeah. Super cool. What is this? Mega world. What a place. We have to go. That's crazy. Oh Tim Horton's, but that's a Canadian coffee company. This looks like a mole of some kind. I have to film this. This is really cool. We actually met one guy in India who was this fountain engineer and he like coordinates the water to the music and so on. Yeah it was really cool. I never met someone actually new enough that for the word. It's plain as well. It's cool cool. Yeah that's what I want to film. Flames fountain. Birdie. Oh yeah this area is something else. Oh, sun. Sun is shining in soar you. I guess we start our walk back towards that mole. It would be really cool to try to run to room here one night to see what it's like to stay in this part of the city. It's such a cool area. Yeah I really like the place. What does that fountain mole? We can do that for video another time. Yeah, I love it. Super cool. Oh now we have to do this. A road crossing I get. Green man. Green man. Lock it in here. Lock it. All right. Oh the green man misses his hand. Oh he's starting to blink. Do you know this house sometimes? I want you to drive in. You get like red, red, red, red, red. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And sometimes that's very few times. You get like green on green on green on green. Yeah, yeah, it feels so good and that's how I built today. When you get all those green lights, yeah, I'm always thinking okay I have a hacker now and I'm just going through the whole street like in a movie. Somebody's watching out for me. I like James Bond. Yeah. Yeah, but now we're actually at this mole so I think we have to split this up so it's two videos otherwise it's going to be too long. Yeah, so you could tap here once it's done. Yeah, really cool Japanese mole. I mean Japanese pancake. Japanese pancake. We're going to look for. So, I'll be sure to act this of course we're making tons of videos here.
