 Bye! Bye! I'm thankful! I'm thankful! So I'm going to go out in the back and see the boys. They've had a shower, they've had a bath. Unlike Isabella. So, the light just come on. And the rest of the lights. About five o'clock. The street lights are starting to come on. The birds are still out and singing. Ah, it's nice. One of my favourite times of day this is. Keetan sun has disappeared. But it's still warm out here. And the boys are here. The cookie and the cream. Ah, look at these boys. Look at the cookie. Oh, it's doing yoga. Oh, you try to get the microphone. You think it's a rat or something, don't you? You think it's a rat. The cream's just as bad. Look at him. Let's see. He's been sight track by cookie. Ah, you're a muddy again. You've had a bath. You've had a bath and you're a muddy again. So what I'm going to need to do is measure up these boys for new collos. They're out growing them quickly. They're getting bigger still. Not even a year old yet, these dogs. She's got muddy pool. She's got muddy pool. Ah, what are you doing? She's not doing. She's trying to stop you. She's trying to stop you, cream. Every time cream has a wash, he does whatever he can to try and get dirty again. This is about as not going to be happy with him. A plum or Adam back in business. So when you move to the Philippines, you really need to watch and be careful for the water. The pipes get cut easily from the outside, in the main road, coming into your property and into your street even. A filter system is a must. If you want to keep your water clean, when you have a shower, you don't want muddy water coming out. We're lucky that we don't, as our showers do, have in-built filters. But sometimes it taps the water coming out. It's not the cleanest. It's not the best. And behind me, look at this. You've got a great view of WrestleMania 38 dogs. The dog main event. Cookie vs. Cream. This looks like a mango tree. It's grass dead. It's bigger than other one. So we're going to put it where the other one is. I think it's not doing very well the other one. I need to check if this is still alive in the road. I'm not able to change it. I'm sure it's still alive. It looks like it's healthy roots. I'm not an expert, but it looks like it's okay. It's come back alive. What? What you want is that? It's the sand pool. Yeah, so all the leaves fell off and died. That is died, but it's come back alive. It starts growing new leaves. I ask her. Maybe it doesn't like the winter too much rain. Well, you know what? I mean, winter in the Philippines. The rainy season. Winter. Oh dear. Yeah, winter in the Philippines, eh? So in Christmas season, all the snow and stuff. Oh, I'm so stupid sometimes. I mean, the rainy season. It doesn't like the rain so much. Perhaps because it does get quite wet. We haven't got much grass yet. We're actually measuring up as we speak. But today, we're going to order some more bemuda grass for my fill in this area here. This grass here was only little, but it does actually spread out a little bit. And it does continue to spread if you can see. There's tiny, tiny little bits that spread out. So with a bit of luck, we get some to fill in the middle. We look after it. We keep those dusted. We keep the dogs off of it. And we might have a lawn in a few months' time. This female papaya tree. They can pollinate it. And they're starting to grow. They're starting to fruit. We're going to have papaya. Doing things like this at home. It's fun. It saves you money. And you get a sense of achievement. So now Jane has our new mango. We love mango trees. This is a yellow mango, isn't it? Yeah, this is a... A Philippine mango? Catmon. Catmon. Catmon? Yeah, it's a sweet yellow mango. Oh yeah. Not a common one? Not those green and yellow mango. No. It's that sweet yellow type that you like. Expensive. Do you want to let you like to buy from the market? So this will take... Oh, it's grafted. So it will be quicker. But it still will take a couple of years. We'll let it to fruit. Provided it survives, obviously. Huh. So Jane's harvest in. Some of our vegetables in the garden. Let's see what she's up to. Are you ready to start it, if you? Yeah. What's that, a spinach? Yeah. I think I'm full. I think I'm full. I'm the clumsy one, not you. This mango tree isn't a mango tree. This guy of anarchy hasn't fruited yet since we've been here. And then he hope it will. Oh, I've got a long beans. Some are not doing well. But some are. So, let's just take it. You just snip off the whole bean? Yeah. Did they keep growing these? Yeah, they should be bearing fruit. I mean, vegetables on the... So they won't just die off the leaves. They just keep growing more and more? They will die eventually. They will, like, but not yet. Some are already. Yeah. Die. This one is not doing well. It's awesome how high it is. I'm going to be making soon. To help with our health is some malunga tea. We have so much malunga here. It just goes up as far as you can see. It's almost like jacking the beanstalk. Like the beanstalk. I've liked it at a very, very top. You cut it, you pull it. And look at that. Before you know it. New branches grow. You can see that little branch, James looking at that. Now that's the whole new branch. She's growing where the old one was pulled off. It's incredible, really. Never ending, is it? The malunga. It's just this one here. It's just this long bear stick. Will it become a belong? Blunga. Malunga. Will it become a belong guy tree? Will it become a malunga tree one day? A belong guy. I will thank her down here. Oh, what is this? And we've got some green beans. We get a long beans, we get malunga here. And we got green beans, five-year-old. We got green beans. Yeah, we'll check if there's some more because we'll rehearse it the other day, the other week ago. Oh yeah, I can see an awkward eye. An awkward eye. One awkward eye. Oh, don't step on it, there's another one here. It's quite hidden, yeah? Oh yeah. I can be malunga grass to put this so this is... Lemon grass is good for the tea as well. For malunga tea. Malunga grass and malunga. Both great herbs or vegetables or whatever you want to call them. I think they're herbs. They're good. They're good. They're good. This one's better. It's better. Okay. I'm going to get some more. I'm going to get some more. I'm going to get some more. I'm going to get some more. I'm going to get some more. I'm going to get some more. I'm going to get some more. I'm going to get some more. I'm going to get some more. I'm going to get some more. I'm going to get some more. I'm going to get some more. I'm going to get some more. I'm going to get some more. I'm going to get some more.
