 Brozki is in Bavskis. Ayo! What a day! We are melting open here in Manila. Manila! It is hot. You guys really cranked up the heat today, man. So guys, today we are going to go to BCG. Did you see? And we are really excited about that because loads of our commenters have told us to go there. So we are going to check that out. But first we want to cool down a little bit. So we want to get some sorry sorry store ice candy. Ayo! I think we found the sorry sorry store central, baby. This looks like the place where all the sorry sorry stores congregate. Oh, here we go. I have heard of it. I just dried up. Do you have ice candy? I will just open one. I have only one. I have only one. I have only one. I have only one. Do you have ice candy? No, we have only one. Ayo! Do you have ice candy? Ice pop. Ice pop. Ice pops guys. It is not ice candy, it is ice pops. But it will help us cool down. We are going there. I hope so. Which one do you want for it? I don't mind bro. There you can have a blue bit of red one. Alright guys, we got our cooling down equipment. What flavor did you get? I don't know. Sugar. Sugar flavor. What taste like anything? It is black. It is tough. It is kind of art to eat guys. It is hard to eat but it does cool me down. Right bro? I think it is like a big frozen piece of syrup. It is rock and roll. We are going to make big money today. We are going to make real big money. Got it. We got our ice pops. It is not ice candy but it does cool us down. So we are very happy. And I think it is time to head over to BGC. So see you there. There! Where we at? Welcome to the Venice Grand Central Canal. We are going to start our BGC day. See you there. I am just getting in the Venice mood baby. I didn't know they had a Venice in Manila. I thought that was in Italy. Me too. But apparently it is a manila. Good job manila. I think it is really cool to see the original Venice. I have never actually been to Venice before. So now we can actually cross that off the list. We don't need to go anymore. I can see the canals. It is so cool. Check it out man. It is so blue. You reckon we can swim in this? Yeah. It is beautiful man. You know what I really like about this? Have you come here and you see traditional Filipino culture? They have their boats, they have their canals instead of roads. I love the ancient architecture. I really love that. That is my favorite part. Mine too. Come man. I can't help but think I will random these places. Someone has to come to someone else to be like, I have an idea. I want to bring Venice to Manila. I think I just came part of it. You are part of it. You are part of it. It is a vlog. How do you feel about that? I am amazing. Welcome to Manila Bay to Wicked. Thank you. Take care. See friendly people all over the place. Alright guys, we are crossing this amazing bridge right now. Look at that. It is incredible. How did they do that? It is like I am flying over the water. We are in Venice baby. We are in Venice. The vibes guys. It is all about the vibes. Look where we are. This morning we woke up in Manila. Now we are in Venice. Venice baby. Where dreams come true. Dude, you know what I do find? What did you find bro? What did you find? What did you find? You know what I find so disappointing? I am going to say it in the evening bro. Something else that I find really disappointing. What do you find disappointing? Is that apparently this place was built for the enjoyment of the people. But for some reason there is a few rotten apples that kept stealing the bridges. So they had to put locks on them. To ensure that those thieves would stop stealing the bridges. If you thieves are watching this right now, you put that bridge back. Because the people of Manila need these bridges. Or else they would not be able to cross this water. Oh, it's so hot. Unless they use a boat. Hello! Hello! What is this? This is a baguette baguette. Baguette bonus. Baguette pizza, bolonnes, Roma, Tower of Pizza, Godfather. Vito, Carlyone. I speak Italian. You know bro, the beautiful thing about walking around here. Is you smell the amazing Italian food. Don't you just love Italian food bro? I'll meet you. There's boats crossing speed man. See how fast they're going through the water. Crazy! Need for speed boat addition. It's too fast. Too boatryous. So we're exiting the Grand Central Canal. Otherwise known as Venice of Manila. And we're going to wander around BGC and see what else is in the area. I'm sure a lot of cool stuff awaits us. So let's go check out that new cool thing! Someone get this guy some pills. So we're taking a walk down the busiest street here of BGC. I'm seeing so many big buildings guys. I'm pretty sure that's how you can tell that you're in the sense of BGC. You are surrounded by giant skyscrapers. I feel like a little broski in the big city. It's like New York City dude. It's better. Look at this street art. Filipino street art is amazing guys. Look at this. It's pretty sturdy dude. You can probably lie on this. It's like a little soft bed dude. So you can't lie on there. You can't lie on that. Okay when it comes to BGC you cannot lie on that bus. We just learned that. It looks strong but it is not. We are making our way to Bonifacio. What is that again? Right now we're going to go to the Bonifacio High Street. And it's called Bonifacio and it's called High Street. So it must be a good place. Alright we decided to get into a cab because this is way more comfortable for one. I'm feeling so good. This is paradise on earth in this taxi right here. Paradise. We're not the only ones that think so. Right? It's paradise isn't it? Paradise? Yes sir yes sir. Yes! Yes! Cool! The vibes in this cab are awesome people. We're here baby. Bonifacio High Street. I'm so excited about being in the Bonifacio High Street man. This is where the lavish luxurious highlight is lived. And just in case you guys think that we're lying and that we've somehow constructed this to make it look like the Bonifacio High Street. But it's not really a Bonifacio High Street because we made it with Leggo. We're going to show you this. Take a walk around bra I'm feeling a little bit hungry. Me too man. Should we like check with the best food here? Yeah and then buy that and then eat it. You're crazy. It's a guy so crazy. I think I found out what we're going to eat. It's our joint. Dude this is our place. It's our joint. Hey, check it out. I'll close it up now. Two brosie burgers. Thank you. Oh man. If I was a burger I would definitely look like this. Definitely look like this. Alright guys. Presentation was... I think we've got to win. Now what I really appreciate about brosie burger over here is how they've glazed the top of this bun. It's so shiny I could almost see myself in it. Taste test number one. Yeah. Yeah. It's really good. I don't want to wait anymore. I don't want to wait anymore guys. I want to eat this burger all here. I don't want to eat it. No. Carol was dropped on his head as a baby. Alright. That explains this. This burger looks amazing guys. I cannot wait to put my teeth into it. I want to eat it so bad. It's going to be so delicious. I'm going to... It's going to be so good. Where is it?
