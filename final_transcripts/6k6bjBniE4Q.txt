 Okay, so there's something definitely in. Cream! There, we're first in the back, step in a way. Do me. It's supposed to be fitting now. Excuse me? I'm joking. Too long. Okay, okay. My hands are in this. One thing in the box. No, I just got it. I just got it. This is my first. I like this one. I like this one. It's like a fir tree. Where's the fir tree? It's amazing. I'll give it a little bit more smell. Can I have a bit of an exploration of our area where we live in the Philippines? We're going to be going to Manila this week. Yes, it's finally happening. We have a date set. Yes, we're going to be in a... ...be abandoning a bit. We're going to be abandoning this about a few days. As me and Jane need to go to Manila, it's better still has school. She doesn't break up until about the 20th of December, which really isn't that far away now. We're going to meet the most of it. We've never been to the capital before. So I'm really looking forward to it. Oh, what's this? We're going to make the first one walk to in. First one walk to in. First one walk to it. First one money, yeah. First one walk to in. I'm bewong. I can see your face. Look at the photographer and the model. Sit down on the sun. Sit down on the sun. Sit down on it. Sit down on it. This is a bit of a break. Oh God, careful and make a break. You're not as light as you think you know. Oh God, it's giving me anxiety watching it. God, when do you make that face when you swim? You're meeting a bat and someone's biting me. Good. Maybe a snake or something. Might be me. Ah, what can you start? Your feet are stuck, could you? Look at this big kid. This is awesome. We need this in the garden. Oh. This phone got my head. Oh God. You're okay. No, you probably already broke it. Go on. You're okay. You worked last year but I didn't have any this year. It's been reinforced for me but I don't know about his belly. It's been due to me. You're already better than me. How have you a year? About 5 kilos less than you. How have you a year? 5 kilos less. I'm 49. No, you're not. That's not 49 kilos. What's your 49 kilos? Definitely a bit of a change in the seasons at the moment. Getting dark and cold on the evenings. So cold is not really that cold. Not the best of the UK. It didn't need a fireplace or something like that. But it's getting a little bit chilly now and then. Got a burly, the cat got us up, five o'clock. She's even learnt now when James says it's food time, lunch time. Get some food. Get some food. You hungry? Come on, let's go then. Come on. Not me. You didn't eat me. Hey, I've not had lunch. Oh my gosh. I mean, sorry James, not you one. Come on. Let's go. She knows what you're stuck with me. Oh my god. You're on your own. So we were up a little bit early today getting some work done. And that was interrupted by cream. You found something in the garage. Oh, it's at my haircut today. Saturday morning. And cream's barking. He's gone really crazy over something. Something in the garage. Something out there, is it? It's a little crazy anymore. I call it the attack. It's going to see what it's cream's up to. What was it cream? Cream's used something. It's like in the grill or something. In the dream. Back here. What is it? You're barking at something. Can you see something? What is it cream? So there's something's been out here. It's really spooked cream. Ah, cream. What is it? I wish you could talk. Lassie used to be able to talk. What is it, boy? Oh! I got you. I got you, boy. I'm in the haircut. I'm in the haircut. So having a dog in the Philippines is good to have. If nothing else, there's good warning when you've got predators, intruders, or even just other dogs. Well, I'm cream. Good boy. I'm very proud of you. Okay, so there's something definitely in. Cream. Cream. I can't see anything in there, cream. Whoah, there it is. Wow, that was fast. So it was a... It was a home. Cream, it's gone, man. Cream. It's gone. It's no longer there, cream. It's inside there. Cream. Something we've had before is back again. So a manila this week. Yeah. Finally. Been waiting for a while, aren't we? We've been waiting for the right time. The time is now. We can finally go explore a little bit more of the Philippines. What do you think of the picture of me? Great place for photo opportunities here. It's a great place to come to spend an afternoon. Take some photos, enjoy nature. Get out of the house a bit. We've been so busy as of late. We really have. We bought one car, we sold another. Been planning a trip to Manila. Still been working on the house trying to finish it off. Bit more stuff to do tomorrow. Ah, the tank goes so quickly. You do find that. Even when you don't work anymore. Time goes just as quickly as when you did work. Sometimes you wake up in the morning. You think you've got all day to do stuff before you know it. It's two o'clock, three o'clock. Time to pick up Isabella from school. Back home, cook dinner. And that's the end of the day. You go so quickly time. So it's very important to enjoy time while you can. Don't wait for it. Just enjoy every second. Oh, the Toad Stores. There's Mr. Blobby's house. They definitely inspired by Noedmond's Mr. Blobby. Definitely inspired by Mr. Blobby. So this way Isabella is going to live next year. So we can go to the house. So we come to Highland Barbecue. They're putting out the Christmas decorations. It's a very Christmas-like Christmas, so it's nice and warm here. But it's the Philippines at Christmas time. It's not necessarily about snow and cold weather. It's about family. It's about spending time together. It's going to be our second Christmas here. I'm really missing my family. But we're going to make the most of this Christmas. It's going to be a game. So both of them are Christmas. We're looking forward to it. We bought a few presents for the kids. We're going to be making some stockings for each of them. For the province kids. Didn't have that much during the year. So we can give them something in Christmas. So if we put a smile on their faces. One of these is a cooking bag. You can get one of these and split them for the kids. It's about to melt your body. Lots of different treats inside. And it's cheaper than if you buy it individually. So we can have one of these. You look different. Different flavours inside I think. So you get like a little... To-do list. Looks like that's quite you good. You can whip them off. You can put a plan in for students. Lots of good snacks. So we've got a couple of these. Yeah. Now I don't eat any crisps ever. You don't like crisps to you? No, no, I never eat them out there. I never eat. I'm joking. There's a lot of selection here isn't there? You come from the UK and it's like the land of the crisps. I've won lots of crisps in the UK. There's such a big selection here in the Philippines. I think they like their crisps. And they do in the UK. It's chewy toffee. It's chewy toffee. It's some of these. Alright, maybe we're getting some of these. So you want to give them some sweets and chocolate, don't you? So it's just something for the kids really. So they have something Christmas time. I'm talking about the kids in the mountain. The kids that don't normally have much throughout the year. They don't normally get things like this. So we're going to give them a little bit of a treat. Something to enjoy on Christmas Day. This is our food for tonight. We're going to enjoy this. We're going to be out here for a little while. It's nice to come out on a saturday night especially. It's been had exams all last week. It's been very busy. So we need to be back to doing what we'd like to do. And then tomorrow we're back on the house. And further into the week we're off to another, finally. And then Christmas is just around the corner. It's busy time. Even when you don't work. There's still no shortage of things to be doing. Thank you very much for watching. We'll be back very soon in another other vlog. And of course, we're going to the minute. We're going to document exactly what we get up to. Our first time there together. Thanks for watching. We'll see you on the next one. Bye.
