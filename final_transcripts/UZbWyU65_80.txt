 The relaxation is tying this home. It's the yesterday here in province. The change on a way down. Before the order that dinner, we pre-booked it, pre-olded it. Tonight we've chosen to sit in one of the cottages by the sea. Here comes one of those little puppies. It's about a lovestome. Cooking cream where puppies want. Now look what happened to them. Jokelang. We are missing cooking cream. We're going to have a day. Oh God bless little Mae. We really miss her. From what we hear, she's causing havoc back at home, chasing people's feet. Eating a lot, she is a growing kitten. We're going to see them tomorrow. We're going back tomorrow. It's our last night here. It's gone so quickly. That's how I usually routine at home. And then in a couple of weeks, we'll be off somewhere else. It's Jane looking forward to our last meal here. Our last evening meal anyway. We head back to Lati, back to Ulmok. Good thing about it is we don't have any time limits. We don't have to rush too much. We can come back whenever we want really. Okay, somewhere new.

Again, I do what's going to be like. She'll be in school uniform. She's looking forward to it and she's nervous. But it's the start of something now. It's the start of regular routine for Isabella. Last year wasn't really much people because of pandemic. Yeah, that's right. At this time, there's so many people. Well, last year, there was limited numbers last year and people wear masks. This year, it's not necessary. It depends where you are in the Philippines, but the mask mandate is still enforced. In certain situations, not all the time. Not more relaxing it was, no? Yes, this is good. Good for setting things about normal. It's a big change from last year's Fiesta. We even got pork this time. We even got lechon. Great pork, you feel. Way back in the school year. I don't know. Don't give you age away. I've got what you want to eat. Yeah, probably. It's a titular in elementary. A titular in elementary school. Yeah, a long time ago. I can't remember. Nice living year. Nice meeting there. So soon you'll be going in the farm. Yeah, going to visit their farm. Yeah, they got big, ragged farm. You also have there gazebo. Good for four person. You have like in Trans-Squee or not yet. Maybe you're soon to be open this September 10th. That's good. So James took into one of our old school teachers. She was in elementary school all these years ago. She has a dragon fruit farm. A really big one, a really nice location. She's gazebo and she can be open at Arkansas, but as a business, we're going to go check her out one day soon. You can see the jackfruit. Send me jackfruit. Check for the chickens. Check for the chickens. Check them, check them. You might think that is legal. So fighting chicken. Oh, what? Fighting, buck. Fighting cock. Is it fighting cock? It's getting all chirty. Maybe my shirt is a bit too colorful for him. You don't want to go? He's a guardian, isn't he? Guardian of the jackfruit now. He's been reassigned from the coconuts to the jackfruit. He's got backup as well. He's got backup. He's got a gang. You're a good guy. You're a good guy. You're a good guy. You're a good guy.
