A lot of relaxation.
It's time, it's Homer.
Yesterday here in the province.
James on the way down.
We've already ordered our dinner.
We pre-booked it, pre-ordered it.
Tonight we've chosen to sit in one of the cottages by the sea.
And here comes one of those little puppies.
Isabella loves them.
Cookie and cream were puppies once.
Now look what happened to them.
Joke lang, we are missing cookie and cream.
And May, oh God bless little May.
We really miss her.
From what we hear, she's causing havoc back at home, chasing people's feet.
Eating a lot, she is a growing kitten.
We're going to see them tomorrow.
We're going back tomorrow.
It's our last night here.
It's gone so quickly.
Back to our usual routine at home.
And then in a couple of weeks, we'll be off somewhere else.
Jane looking forward to our last meal here.
Our last evening meal anyway.
Before we head back to Leyte, back to Ormok.
Good thing about it is we don't have any time limits.
We don't have to rush too much.
We can come back whenever we want really.
Or go somewhere new.
Discover, Boracay, Bohol,
Jago, Palawan, Baguio, Manila.
She's going to adopt it tomorrow in Ormok.
Jane and myself were just doing something and we heard a bit of a bang.
Yes, it's happened again.
This time it's Homer.
But Mr. Fluffy has been renamed.
He's now known as Homer.
He's come through the lost hatch again.
We've got this to try and catch him.
It's about 10 o'clock at night.
You okay?
Hurry up!
Where is it?
There, you need to turn on that light.
Is it in the corner?
Yeah.
Is it big or small?
Big.
Really?
Oh, I see it.
It's bigger than you.
It's in the...
In the tower.
Huh?
I'm going in, Alia.
Oh my!

Also, don't just sleep.
Okay, you help me.
Oh my God!

He's going up here!
Are you okay?
Hermione!
Hey!
I'm scared!
Darling, are you okay?
Are you okay?
You will be remembered.
Send this to my wife.
No!
No!
I want to die!
I don't want to die.
No!
Come on, please!
It's 11 PM!
No!
This is your shield.
This is your shield now.
You want to look up?
There you go!
Let me hold it.
I think it's behind the toilet.
But I can't see it.
So I'm going to go underneath the toilet.
Oh my God!
Chris is not here.
I wish Chris is here.
She's the only brave one.
Where are you?
Let me see.
I can't find the book.
I can't find it.
Where did it go?
I don't know.
I don't know where it went.
I don't know where it went.
I can't find it.
I don't know where it went.
I don't have a light.
Mom, I'm younger than you.
I deserve to live longer.
It's not recording.
I have a cold.
No, we can't see.
I think he's on the...
He's on the right-hand side.
My mom's in the shower.
Let's get it.
Oh, I got it.
I got it.
I can't believe you did that.
Done?
Yes, please.
We got it tonight.
You get it?
Just stay there a minute.
Where?
It's there.
Oh, man.
You scared me.
Oh, God, it is gone.
Okay.
It'll be okay.
It'll be okay.
Gonna be shiny.
Yeah, it'll be okay.
Anywhere you wanna go.
It'll be okay.
It'll be okay.
Gonna be shiny.
Yeah, it'll be okay.
It'll be okay.
So, we're here today.
Good morning, my friends.
My name is Bruntag.
We're in Kananga.
In the South Kananga.
It's Fiesta Day here in the province.
We're at Jane's sister's house.
We're gonna enjoy some food, some company.
Family's here.
Fiesta's bring communities together.
Bring families together.
You meet new people.
You make new friends.
Fiesta in the province.
It's something special.
There's Camille.
This is bringing back some bad memories for Isabella.
Okay, then don't look then.
Come on, Isabella.
Face your fear, Isabella.
Kai-kai.
Kai-kai.
Kai-kai?
You're calling Isabella kai-kai?
I don't know what you're calling kai-kai.
This is Fiesta today.
And we have lichun pork.
We're gonna have some food now.
Because we're hungry.
The food is ready.
That's the lichun pork.
And that one is, I forgot the name.
And that one is the chicken...
Cordon bleu.
Cordon bleu.
Yeah.
Cordon sour fish.
That's the food time.
So as usual, we're gonna bless the food before we eat.
Traditionally in the Philippines, especially in the provinces.
But we're gonna bless.
And then we're gonna enjoy the food together.
That looks so good.
Adam, here.
Ah, cool.
Here's the Fiesta.
Happy Fiesta!
Start with the face.
Go, start eating.
It's so good.
This is the pineapple.
So we need to pick up the books from the school a bit later.
And tomorrow is as best as going to the classroom for the first time in the Philippines.
It's not gonna be four lessons tomorrow.
Just an orientation.
Get to know around the campus, the facilities.
Get to meet her fellow students, the teachers.
Get an idea of what it's gonna be like.
She'll be in school uniform.
She'll be in a school uniform.
She'll be in a school uniform.
She'll be in a school uniform.
Get an idea of what it's gonna be like.
She'll be in a school uniform.
She's looking forward to it and she's nervous.
But it's the start of something now.
The start of regular routines for Isabella.
Last year wasn't really much people because of pandemic.
Yeah, that's right.
So this time there's so many people.
Well, last year there was limited numbers last year and people wear masks.
This year it's not necessary.
Not necessary, no.
Depends where you are in the Philippines.
But the mask mandate is still enforced in certain situations.
But not all the time.
It's a lot more relaxed than it was now.
Yes, this is good.
Good for some things are back to normal.
It's a big change from last year's fiesta.
We've even got pork this time.
We've even got lechon.
Great work, you fell way back to school year.
Don't give you age away.
I forgot what year was today.
Yeah, probably.
I'm a teacher in elementary.
Teacher in elementary school.
Yeah.
Long time ago.
I can't remember.
Nice meeting you.
Nice meeting you.
Nice to meet you.
So soon you'll be going in the park.
Yeah, we're going to visit their farm.
Dragon fruit farm?
Yeah.
They got a big dragon farm.
They also have their gazebo.
Good for four person.
Do you have like entrance fee or?
Not yet.
Maybe soon to be open this September 10.
Ah, that's good.
So Jane Salkin is one of her old school teachers.
When she was in elementary school all these years ago
she has a dragon fruit farm.
Really big one, really nice location.
It's gazebo and she's going to be opening it up in September as a business.
We're going to go check it out one day soon.
Can you see the jackfruit?
So many jackfruits.
Check for their chickens.
Chicken.
I'm scared of chicken.
It's a fighting chicken.
A what?
Fighting bucks.
Fighting cock.
It's a fighting cock.
He's getting all shirty.
Maybe my shirt's a bit too colourful for him.
You don't want to go?
He's a guardian, isn't he?
Guardian of the jackfruit now.
He's been reassigned from the coconuts to the jackfruit.
He's got backup as well.
He's got backup.
He's got a gang.
He's got a gang.
