 Guys, big day today. We are picking up my parents today at the airport and it's going to be not just their first time in the Philippines, but their first time abroad. So that's so super exciting. We are just in a little bit of a hurry already early morning because the car that we were supposed to use to pick them up at the airport just broke. So we don't really know how this whole car situation is going to be for the day, but first thing first, we will decorate this little room just really quickly because today is also my Dutch birthday. We are in the family resort by the way. We are going to spend just two nights here with them before we are flying to another island of the Philippines together. There's this mostly ready little room that was built in the family farm resort. Perfect for us to spend the night. It's more spacious than our home, which is like a one bedroom house. So before we figure out everything, it's time to put up some birthday decoration quickly. We also have their little little campok. We got some guia bano wine in Banoë. A cute little valet. I'd say we are quite done here. My happy birthday sign is a little bit crooked. I didn't realize that it's supposed to be like one of these designs and one of these designs until it was done. It's fine. It's fine. The tot that counts and it still looks good. Okay guys, done. Resort rooms are ready. This is our broken car that was supposed to bring us to the airport today. It got fixed, but still very risky. So we are probably not going to use it. There's this other option. John's car, which also have something that needs to get fixed. So we are trying to get that done. Before we have to leave to the airport, literally in an hour. You guys will already know if this vlog is titled just picking up my parents at the airport or we broke down on the highway with my parents in the Philippines. We don't know yet. You already know. Hoping that it's the better case. Guys, we made it to Claird. Actually my parents flight arrived to Claird, not to Manila. So that's good for us. It's a lot closer, but Claird has so many airports that we are a bit lost. We had to go. Google doesn't know where we supposed to go. But it lead us to the people there to us that it's not the arrival terminal. So they said it's not the old airport. Yeah, there's some. Oh yeah, because I saw it everywhere on Facebook that there's a new airport of Claird, but Google doesn't know it yet. I think we can turn. Guilpuyat Avenue. Also, good news. So far the cart didn't break down yet. Everything is going smoothly. We found it. This is so fun. The airport looks so cool. There here too. Regular arrival. There's even VIP arrival. No, just regular arrival. It's so big and empty. Very Claird like. It's so empty. This is the international part of the new Claird airport. I don't know where's the domestic. We will find it out also in a few days. We are guys. This is our 40th super-thien. It's not crowded at all. Usually in Manila it takes like two hours to get out of the airport here. It seems so empty that I think it will be really quick. But we are of course too early every time someone is getting picked up at the airport. It's mandatory that you arrive way too early and gets very bored. Let's look at this airport. Yeah, look at this guys. Such a pretty airport and look at this interesting weird purple plant. That's so cool. I love how this airport looks. The pixel of course also came to pick her grandparents up. But she will meet with for the first time ever. Wow, this building is so pretty. I love it. We are waiting guys. I'm tracking my parents where they are at the moment. Based on our very detailed calculations, their plane should arrive from there. From the west. From the west they went through Pangasinan. So we are waiting for the only flight that is arriving to this airport in the upcoming hours. So if we see a plane it's theirs. Maybe it's them circling. They are on top of the car. Hi! Hello! Probably won't be visible. That's them. So exciting guys. I have so hard time believing. I'm very excited of course. But I lived in the Philippines for so many years. And only throughout those years I only met my parents when I visited Bafom at Hungary. It's like so exciting. But for them and for us and also around this week is exactly the one year anniversary of me moving to the Philippines. Moving back to the Philippines. So I haven't met my parents exactly in a year. So exciting. This is how peaceful Polarcare is. Clarcare is awesome. It's breezy. It's beautiful. It's peaceful. Some people are all the camo. I think they are your grandparents. I must go.
