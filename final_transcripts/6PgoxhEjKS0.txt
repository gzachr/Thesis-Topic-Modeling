 But you're Friday. The freshest. Alright, this is interesting. It's got way we were really confused with the whole idea of country whether it was popular in the Philippines or not. And you guys said that it's very regional. There was like a part of the Philippines that this is great. The mountains? Yeah, where this is really heard and still played. It's very popular in the mountains. I don't know what mountains, but you know, that's where you got citizenship. In the mountains. I believe you. I think they call the singing, otorogis, otorogis. Otorogis? And yeah, they like to do a lot of country music. And I think there are trio and shit. Take me home. So let's keep on. Let's go. I've never heard. I don't know. Country not being played in the US. Yeah, not being from Americans. Yeah, so this is the first time. And if anyone is going to be able to do this, they will most likely be from the Philippines. That's correct. They're natural nature to emulate. I'm the justice. I don't know. The pedigree. There's different. Bill different. Bill different. Let's have a look. Hey, hey. Look at the hats and everything. Fuck, you know. OK, one, two, three, go. OK. Looks upon. I was just running. Oh, shut up. Oh, no. What? And they sing out of love. But they are so cool. It's a privilege of live. It was from the US. I am totally tripping out here. Oh, you big, you see. And thank you, Bill. For your blessings are the reason. All right, what on the earth? How? We're going to explain what the electric guitar is a bass. No, I think he's just doing all the, all the, is on my clean. It's clean. So yeah, so I think he's doing all of the, our page of work. Our page of, our page of work. So that he's just, yes, howdy partner. But no, definitely, I, this is such a trip to me. Wait a minute. What? That's actually so crazy. Sounds like what the fuck? What, what states is it? Kansas City. Country, most country music. Most popular states in America. Well, they have a country music festival in London. But you know that. I didn't know that. I've been living here for a decade. Most popular states. Hit me with it. It is. Texas, obviously, will be number one. Yes. In Tennessee. There are no other places with as many country music concerts. Nightclubs, small town, opera shows and legends. George Stray, Willie Nelson, Whalen Jennings, Bob Willes. You know Bob Willes, I would imagine. But yeah, like Texas, Texas. Kansas, anything in the south. Yeah, yeah, basically. Yeah. Fuck you know. It's crazy. That's really far away, dude. That is so far away. I wonder why. And it's so, it's so regional. It's like listening to janeras. That's literally America's janeras. It's obviously probably intertwined to like maybe church and stuff. You know, they are singing, I guess this is like a Christian song. Yes. So maybe. But it's also. Maybe they're like from the mountains, right? Or maybe they like country side. Country music is often related to the farming life and harvesting and all that stuff. You're actually highly religious as well. Yeah, because it's yeah, really conservative states. The most of them are Catholic. I think so. I think it overall. Like two to a specific area of America. So it's really it's really wild. It's so cool. It sounds fantastic. They're awesome. I'm not a big country fan, but that's just good. That's great. There's a I just want. There's food on my table. She's on my feet. What the fuck? You gave me a level. And why you found a way. Love the harmony. For your blessings on me. For a. I know I'm not strong. And this grows here. And I do. Oh, with food. Hey, good old man. I'm on my feet. Oh. Oh, I have you. Oh, hell yeah, brother. I'm out. No, the world ain't not seen. Oh, thank you. This is so cool. It's so cool. Woohoo! Ha, ha, ha. We became wolves for a second there. I fucking love that. Look at what on the earth. This is so wild. They got the twang for the singing right. Yeah. Which is like I know that. They're modulate with a Jo's. That's right. And they darkened her like the ours and the elves are super darkened. And it's just. But she's a guy in the middle. I wish I knew their names. I do apologize. It's so organic to the original. I don't know. Root of the genre. Oh gosh. I wonder how you stumble upon this and say, uh-huh. This is what I was born to say. Anyone know why historically this makes sense. Could it be maybe because... Oh, God. What is that? Slap the cows' ass. Maybe you stand behind the horse though. You get hit. What happens if you get behind a cow? You probably get hit too. Really? It's just a reflex. You saw of animals with four legs. I don't think a lot of people... I don't think of a role. Anything that gets hit wouldn't react. No, like kick back. Uh-huh. That's why you don't stand behind a horse. There you go. Piece of iron. Also, if a tiger is ever chasing you, don't piss yourself. It will think you're a Mark in territory. And attack faster. Thank you. Yeah, genuinely you're dead. No, whatever you do, even if you're crapping yourself, you can do that. Don't piss yourself. No, I say for a wonderful love. But a cow would a cow kick back. I've never seen a cow kick anything. Yes, I have. No, I've seen him run through things. I've never seen him kick. We spend so much time in the farm. You never remember. Have you ever seen him kick? Yes, I have. A cow. Yes. A cow. It's good. Blah blah. You think they're that athletic? No, but one leg. They kick with one leg. I've seen them kick with one leg. Yeah, that's true. Actually, I don't remember. I just don't. Today, I use my farm. Do you ever been to a farm? Apparently I haven't. Well, you do. Ah, what the hell. That's so weird. But what happened to your childhood memories, bruh? They're all dead and gone. Wonderful. I long beside my emotions. Okay. No, the point is. The point that we're putting our show on make is maybe, yeah, maybe like. I can't make sense of this. Maybe the radios that I've really pop around the countryside. I like American radios. Probably. How the fuck? Actually, think about it. How does this make any sense? And how are they so good at it? Meaning that maybe now because of the internet, you can't consume the type of music. But it doesn't seem to be new. Like, people would tell me in the comments and in the messages. Ah, dude. Like, this shit's always happened. That's what I mean. It's like how? How? American culture has influenced me a lot of the world, right? Yes. Cowboy culture. Maybe there was like a, was there an American base somewhere in the country? There was army related. Maybe. A lot of things come out of that. Like, in Korea, a lot of like their culture and cuisine is actually influenced by American. But it's like, there's some American. It's like, there's a change. Yeah. A change of culture between the US Army and the South Korea. And Vietnam is the same. So I don't know. Maybe they had a base or... Interesting. History, relation, personal. Right, I know. Somebody enlighten us. Yeah. And God forgive our ignorance. Ignorant asses. Hi, all of you. Hey, all of you. Yes, sir. I'm making fun of anyone. Just saying. This is just a trip in my head, though. You're out of pick. Huh? Could you run a pick? What the fuck are you doing? Well, I hit it in the back. Oh! That's right, that's right. Oh, God. Oh, yeah. I say listen to this. Come to Johnny. Oh, clap, hold my hand. Do you listen to country music? Yeah. This is awesome, this. It's just so. Yeah, it's awesome. Yeah, it's awesome. Yeah. It's just so. It's awesome. It's beautiful. It's beautiful. It's so awesome. It's beautiful. It's awesome. It's beautiful. It's beautiful. It's beautiful. It's beautiful. You know, I've never seen country music be played live. How do you play that shit in the drums? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. You play the drums? Yes, it's not in the ballads, but they've got more giddy-opie stuff. Really? Yes. It's pretty cool. How the fuck have never? Oh, yes. I know, I'm pretty sure you have. Pretty like in comics. So it was like, you know, boxbunny and stuff. Yeah, but they know their accurate presentations or what. The drumming looks like. They just do the same animation once. You know? Oh, look. Yeah. Bro, this is great. Let us know more about this. Do you like country music? Are you from any of these parts of this world? This world? Yeah, like the US, Texas, or maybe I know these. The US, Texas on its own. Yeah, long-lived country. Because that would be pretty big. You would be one of those, you know, states or parts of the world that, you know, that would be one of the most popular genres of music that they consume. Would it be more popular than pop? Because that kind of defeats the purpose of calling it pop, isn't it? But I think country pop would be, I think. Yeah, there is a thing that I would like to do. Taylor Swift. Yes, exactly. For early years. For early years, yeah. Or maybe you're from the Philippines. Maybe you're from Asia and wherever you are in Asia, you also listen to country music. Because that would be a fucking line. That's actually pretty wide. It doesn't know. I'm really interested in these lots and props to them. They're amazing. What do you mean? This is amazing. And I mean amazing. I seem like awesome. Like, it fills me with all. Like, it's not awesome in the whole sense of the word. No, no, no. I seem like it fills you with all. You're like, wow. Yeah, awesome. Yeah, it fills you up. It's awesome, but all. It's awesome. All right, on that note. And don't remember. The do remember to check out our store. If you try to store that come. That's right. If you like some of them. There's no that. Yeah, click on the thing down. Ships were white. That's right. So whether you listen to content music and Philippines and America. You can get your hoodie. All right. Anyway. Yeah, that's right. That's right. See you later.
