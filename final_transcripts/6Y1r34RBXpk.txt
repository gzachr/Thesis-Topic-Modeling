By the way, if you want to tag me on material to react on these videos, you can do so at WLSK15 on both Instagram and TikTok. We're doing a holiday version. Christmas version. So if you have fun Christmas viral videos that are from your neighborhood, your Christmas party or work, whatever, send them through. We're going to be checking them mentions. You have to be fast because we're doing a little bit like in a few days. That's right, that's right. So tag me. Anyways, the point is that this video is captioned, let's find my vibrato, which makes me vibrato. Which makes Italian hat here. Which makes me think that she's probably a very straight note straight tone kind of singer. I think that's from one of the rock. From Japan. Yes, yes, I love it because when you do good information, it makes me so proud. That's right, to find what Filipino singer has a pure tone. Rock, yeah, usually alternative rock. It's dense to be the genre. It does to be the genre that has very straight tone. Straight tone. Straight tones. So let's see what happens in here. Yeah, I have no idea what this is. Even if you didn't tell me this was from the Philippines, I would have straight up known because only Filipinos are cracked enough to make vibrato based karaoke games. Yeah, who else? Let's keep it entertaining. Let's keep it entertaining. Also, this song is cracked. There's a regime version of this, which is like... Very nice, very well placed. This is the regime version, this is the regime version. That's how hard it is to kill. But she's not very grounded, it's very lifted, it's nice. Oh, I forgot about that. Oh, that was crisp. Oh my god, it's so satisfying. Oh, and then she's playing with that vibrato. It is the regime version, by the way. That was tough. When I come, my toxic tray is thinking I could do this. What is it? She made it so easy. I've had dreams where I sing great. I genuinely tell you no, it's like a fantasy of mine. To do it, pull out the karaoke machine, do it now. And I just pull out and I am so... Mura, you know, I'm a jim Velasquez song. Something that no one would think is in my range is that I mean, I'd be like, watch this. And I pull out this version till I make you something. It is, I think that it's very toxic tray to have. Lose it. No, you're a fool. And also, if you know that, then you know that, like, individuals like this, like this girl. That's pretty mental, man. That's pretty correct. In terms, no, that's freaking correct. This song is correct. You gotta be another level of freaking broken, bro. In the mind, in the psychological experience of life, you know? You're on another realm. People talking to you on this. Yeah, yeah, I'm telling you, God, really tagged. But it's really cool because in this particular, like, I think I was right into thinking that she's a very straight tone, clear, tonality kind of singer, where you are hearing her adjustment of vibrato at the end of phrases, because it's not a natural inclination for her, which is really cool to see in this, like, practice like environment, when everybody's like around, and like, there's people in the background, minding, eating their dinner, just minding their own business. I love that. I love how encouraging the Filipino culture is, like, honestly. I think this is the... Yeah, yeah. Yeah. The breath control here is insane. Look how grand that she is, though. Freaking hell. Yo, bro, she's married, man. It's so cute. I think I've seen this. Freaking hell. Oh, stop! I'm so cute! What are you fucking this guy? He stole my heart. Oh, stop! Kiss her, kiss her. Give her a kiss. I love what the fuck. She's married, man. Is she not? She is. She has a kid with Ogi. What the fuck? I don't know what this really is, but he made me feel everything. Maybe it was her boyfriend at the time. He was, I think, a mother-in-law. Oh, well, it's kind of hard actually to tell timeline, right? Because Regina Velasquez looks the same, just kind of look the same for the last 20 years. She's looked the same since the 90s. I think she's age twice. Because she's age when she was 16, right? We don't know what she looked when she was a kid. So she aged the first time at 16, and then probably is going to age again, right? At some point. You think her, you think. I don't know how old she is, but I presume everyone ages at least twice in a life. I've seen those posters of her new tour. Yeah, bro. She looks the fucking same. She rocks, and she looks amazing. She's like, like, 90s Regina. She looks amazing. Like, I have absolutely no idea how the woman does her life. All right. I got a scale too. Who, who is the guy? What is this? Who's his name? I don't know. Robin Padilla. That's his name. Robin Padilla. What the fuck is this? Robin Padilla. What's the name? Yeah, what's the name? Well, they were all the same. He's the fucking senator of the Philippines. God, what the fuck is going on? Girl, that taste. What the hell is happening? Are you sure it's the same guy? I don't know. Yeah. He does movies. No. 1.3 million. No. God, he looks so different. Is this him? What? I am a Muslim. I'm not a terrorist. Oh, okay. That thing that is him. Wow. That's crazy, dog. He acts and then he became the... Look at him. The senator. He was a little bad, no. I don't know if that's him recently. He's only 50. The senator of the Philippines. Robin Hood, Ferdinand Carigno Padilla. What's the name? Son. He is a freaking dog. No, professionally, as Robin Padilla, is a Filipino actor, director, and politician. Holy crap. He is known as the bad boy of Filipino cinema for portraying anti-hero gangster roles in films, such as Anakke. Anak. Anak. Nibaby. Ama. Gris. Gungang. Bad boy and bad boy too. Okay, can I just... Can you check if they were together? They see... Oh, maybe they were acting. Maybe. Maybe this... She was very flattered though. She was very... Yeah. Look. I think they were acting. I think they were okay. They were in a role together. Until I met you, it's a romantic film. You're the freaking hell. I'm sorry. Damn, she's fucking active. She checked it a bunch. I didn't know. Yeah, she's got a bunch of movies. Yeah, but she has one movie on her own, probably. She has one movie on her own, but it's a sequel as well. I thought it was just a song. No, it's a film. Well, Piorlo could sing. You know who I felt bad for? Whoever that geezer was. I think it was Sara Hironimo and the deserve a guy. I felt immensely bad for them. You know, because she... I said I don't even know G.A. We could broke. Yeah, not... And they gave you a duet, but you're an actor. You know, a singer. You were pretending. You were lying. Because that's your job. And then they put you in G.A.M.A. Or fucking Assa was something where they give you zero. Forget all the tune. She had to don't exist. No, but I command. I respect my... I take my hat off to that guy. Yeah, they were acting. And then they gave you that. Oh, I see. 2006. I mean, not that I care about anyone sort of life, person to life. But I'm just saying what... Woo! But... Oh! Cool. That's my source of in it as well. Made me... Sangha original. Sangha original. Is this from Viva film? It is Viva. God. Damn. Anyways. Guys, that took a turn. Yeah, I never knew what this video was. I wouldn't know. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
