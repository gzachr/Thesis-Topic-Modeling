 What's good to ask for? Welcome to a new vlog, Tuddy! We're gonna be trying Filipino snacks for the very first time, two weeks ago. We tried Filipino food and you guys absolutely love that video and we absolutely love the food. So we needed more. So we went to our local Filipino market and picked up some of the best most popular Filipino snacks and we're gonna be trying and rating every single one of them to see what turns the best. I'm so excited for this, so make sure you guys subscribe, we're trying to hit 100,000 subscribers and with that being said, let's get to trying these balls next. First up, we got shrimp chips and this has hog garlic, Yuzu black pepper, wasabi and the classic original. Wasabi? Yeah, and this is made from wild caught shrimp guys. Let's not judge a book by its cover. Oh my god, this stench is already crazy. Oh hell no! Oh! I'm sorry, I can't. I will preface, I'm not the biggest seafood fan so I'm biased in that sense. But I do like shrimp. Ready, three, two, one. What? They're really good. These are actually good. Mmm. It tastes like like a crunchy shrimp. Yeah, I could eat these all day. That's why you don't judge a book by its cover. Yeah, the smell hit me, I was like, Oh! But the taste. Mmm! I'm gonna rate these in eight additives. I give these a... I give these a six and a half. Okay. Next up, going into the dessert category, we got mango flavored mochi. Here we go. Interesting. There it is. Nice. Open it up. Mmm. Put the whole thing in your mouth. Boss. Mmm. Mmm. Not what I was just talking. Yeah. Not a huge fan. Like it's not a, I want to throw up. Yeah. Taste, but it's like, it's not pleasant, but you're ready. I'm gonna give these a... for three. I think I'm gonna agree with you. Okay. Next, we got purple yam cake. So this one is ube, just an ube cake, and then this one is a ube gesso. Ube with cheese. This is like half and half. Yeah. And this one is just ube. That's one thing that we did notice at the Filipino store. So many products containing ube. Oh my god. It was like, ube heaven guys. I love it. Trying the ube one. Mmm. I love ube. Mmm. These are good. That's pretty fire. Personally, I might give it like a seven. Probably a seven point five. Okay. All right. Cheese and ube. Oh. Oh. I don't know which one I like better. I'd like... I don't really taste the cheese. I really don't taste much. No. Kinda taste the same as you. It kinda taste exactly the same. Okay. Just for that, we're gonna go down to a seven. Yeah. So that means you're going down to a six and a half. Okay. Yeah. Next up, we got sonaku seaweed cracklings. Check these out. These look very interesting. Okay. Okay. So like crunchy seaweed, I'm expecting this one. This one looks interesting. Hello. Wait. Is this like fried seaweed? Whoa. Look at this. I think it is. It's just like fried seaweed. All right. Ready? Mmm. That's fire. Where are we going to put this? Smired. Uh? What? Damn. No, these are actually so good. Mm-hmm. It's so simple like just fried seaweed. It tastes this good. Like, oh look. You can see the seaweed in this one. Mmm. These are guys. These are actually really good. I love how light they are. I like if it's like an eight and a half. This is probably my favorite thing so far. Okay. We need something sweet now. So we got ube and bean milk bars. I'm excited. Thank you. Oh, me too. Ready? Cheers. Cheers. Huh? There's beans in it. Hold on. Did you just bite it? There's beans in it. This is 50 ice cream right off the rip. Look at that. God, it says ube and bean. I thought it was like ube and bean mixed together and then frozen into a paleta, not beans inside of it. Look at the beans inside guys. Whoa. Ube ice cream. And I don't really mind the beans either. Yeah, you're really tasty. I know. It doesn't taste like beans, you know? Mmm. I probably give these like a nine. Yeah. Good nine. Damn, you're sucking the beans. I'm gonna up. Next item was something very interesting that I've never seen in my entire life. Milk flavored chips. Huh? Oh, they smell good. Mmm. You could taste the milk for sure. And they're actually good. Mmm. I like these. You know what the kind of taste like? What? Pops. Mmm. They kind of taste like pops. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. I really like these. I'm gonna rate those like a 9.5. Oh yeah. Oh my god. Next up is actually something that Isaac picked out because he was just shocked by it. Watermelon seeds. I have never eaten, I mean maybe like while eating a watermelon, one might slip down. Package like this, I've never seen this before. So these should be interesting. Mmm. They smell good. Do you just like be- What the hell? You just went in without me? What? I was not expecting that. What? Do you just suck on them? I was a man. They're very salty. I was expecting these to be sweet. Too salty. Mmm. Oh my god. They're good at good though. Yeah. I don't know. I think for me, that's the only thing like they're a little too salty. So maybe give them like a- Six? Yeah, like a six. All right, those seeds made a so thirsty so it's only right mmm. My first drink of the day. And I think our only drink of the day. Yeah, let's see if you can pronounce that, babe. What? Guyabona? How do you pronounce it? Wow, Guavaiano. I don't know if you can try. I don't know if you can try. Guavaiano. Mmm. I mean, I'm pronouncing it as Spanish, but for us, so we actually have this in Cuba, but we call it Guavaano. And I guess in the Philippines they call it Guavaano. Interesting. You've never seen this group before? Gas. Gas. That's so good. And there's like little pieces of the fruit in there. Mmm. No, this is so good. That's fire. It's very refreshing. Mmm. You know, it's good when he has to grunt. No, this is so good. Wait, hold on. I might rate that a 10. That is so good. Okay, we haven't tried anything like this. So we're going to try some candy. This is Bastillas de Bucco Pandan. It says chewy milk candy with a young coconut and a screw pine extract. I have no idea what screw pine extract is, but let's try it. Tuton vibe going on. Ready? I like this consistency. I'm going to huge fan of milk candy. For me, I might rate this a five. Mmm, I'm going to give it a seven. Next up, we got corn rings. Check these out. Oh my god. Mmm. It tastes like I literally just ate up a corn. Mmm. You can put some corn. These are fire. Whoa. These are fire. And these are fire. I'm going to give those a 10. Really? You're going to give these a 10? They're good, but I don't know if they're 10 good. I really like corn. And egg. I'll give them an egg. Damn. Oh no. Oh no. We got crispy fried squid. Teriyaki style. Squid? Check these out. Oh my god. Okay, let's dig in. This is what we're working with. I'm scared. You got a way smaller piece. I'm only going to eat half of it. Three, two, one. Oh my god. Uh oh. Uh oh. Uh oh. Okay. No. Okay. I think we just had our first zero of the day. Absolutely. This should make up for it. Yes. I picked these out. Oh yes. Oh my god. Ready? There's something in the middle. Oh there is. I didn't get that far. Let me try that one. They're a little dry for my taste. It tastes a lot like just bread. It's like a whoe bread. I thought it was cookies. I do like the middle though. I'm probably going to have to go with like a six for these. I'll give these a seven. And lastly we got cheese curls. These are cheese flavored corn curls. These kind of look like little cheetos. They're so cute. Mini Cheetos. Cheetos puffs. Mmm. Good. Good. Mmm. You know what these taste like? Cheetos puffs. Mmm hmm. Exactly. It's like a mini version of Cheetos puffs. Those are a ten for me. I love how cheesy and like light and small they are. Yeah. I might have to go with the ten as well. Okay. These ended up being our top four favorite snacks of the day. So if you're thinking of getting some Filipino snacks, make sure you get one of these four things. Thank you guys so much for watching. And with that being said, we'll catch you guys next one. Peace. Bye получается coffee with tomato sauce. Tomatoes. This one too! Mmm mm hmm. The way that you put it is, Grammar cheese you can probably add some force. I'm not gonna make something for you again. It's not a real world. I think too much cheese... It's like you can beetish and put some adviser's on it.
