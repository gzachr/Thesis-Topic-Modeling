 Look at our black that is. Welcome everybody to the Aristocrat restaurant. We've got recommended this a lot of times actually. It's one of our most recommended restaurants. And we're also going to be trying some Halo Halo. First time eating Halo Halo in the Philippines. Try it and do buy at a place called Halo Halo. Uh? But and it was really good. And we also made our own Halo Halo. That was very good. But now we're going to try some special Halo Halo. And I can even normal Halo Halo getting the special Halo Halo here. We also got some of the best barbecue in town according to the menu. We're going to try that. What town? Wow, those look like they came straight out of Shanghai. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Barbecue pork. Home is barbecue chicken. Lumpia Shanghai. Lumpia Shanghai is always good. We're going to try it at another place. There's special Java rice or something they call it. It's yellow. It's yellow. Wow, it's yellow. And it's in the shape of like a dome. Lumpia is the first step. We'll wait on that. That'll not feel too good. All right. So the first thing to do is drink the barbecue sauce. Oh, it's thick. But it's very thick. It's staying on the spoon. Yummy. Barbecue sauce, shallot. Oh. Wow, such a shining. It only looks like when it's clumped up like this, it looks like so much less rice. And then you then spread it out and it covers half the plate. When you unclump it, as you can see, the chicken is boneless, which makes it much easier to slice with the spoon. Or maybe not. Oh, he's getting it. He's getting it. That's straight boneless. There's a bone in the boneless chicken. How angry would you be on a scale of 1-100? Probably I guess. Back of the fork. Back of the fork. Thank you. Feel like even though I'm doing it the proper way, it's making me eat much slower. And you already eat slow. Cool. That's hot. Oh no. Everything is piping. I can see myself in there. Your reflection really works. Oh, look at the full. Oh. All right, fork. My rice. No, rice down. Oh, there's rice. Oh, there's rice down. Oh, there's rice down. Oh, there's a skewer in there. Oh. There we go. Skewer ejected. Thank you. Wow, that is so much easier. You actually have to take the stick out. Cool. What a pot. It's hard to cut sticks. Are you kidding me? I could have bit that stick. Let me get the rice first. Oh. It's special. I do taste the special one. I do. And I do taste the Indonesian chili crumb java. No, I don't think it's too hot. No. That's really good. The pork is super tender. It looked like when you cut it that it was. Super tender. Like in Georgia, we had pork. And sometimes we were like, yeah, I really chew it. And it tasted really good. But this is so tender. It just falls apart in the mouth. And it is so tender. It's so tender. It's so tender. It's so tender. It's so tender. It's so tender. It's so tender. It's so tender. It's so tender. It's so tender. It's so tender. If you layer it out and it tastes like barbecue, it smells like barbecue. And there's so much work to do. Know can you smell that? The kind of time-br所有. And it is so tender. So I think the good experience of that is with the AWS actual Oh, it's hot on the outside, on the inside. Really? When I picked it up, it literally hurt my fingers, so I thought I would cry my mouth if I could write it. It's hot. This is pretty good. It's a meteor than buddies. Does it get top 10 ranking on a loompey that you've had in your entire life? Yes. I love it up. Three or four loompeas that I've had in my life. This is top 10. I think buddies with a little bit of flavor, this one is more meat though. I think I have to. Which I do enjoy. And there's a loompey. Look at how many of them there are. It was like eight bucks, so they're thick. Did you get a lot? Good job, Aristocrat. We met Aristocrat? Where is he? Look at chicken. Oh, it's pretty bad. Whoa, that glaze is super good. Is it the best chicken barbecue in town? I don't know, he've only had one. It's smoky, glazy, deliciousness. It's built even more of it now. It's going to be a pile of rice. I'll clean it up since it's an Aristocrat. The rice complimenting it really well actually. It's not spudgy. There is a lot of meat in there. Meaty boys. The sauce is a little different than the buddies one as well. It's much sweeter, less spicy. Is that a good thing or a bad thing? Do you like the sweeter the spicy? Probably a recent devias, but I like the sweet one right now. But if I were to go back and try that one, I'd probably like that one. Marbeque sauce drinking? I'm not going to do that, that was a joke. What? I'll do the octopus, but I won't do that. I'm already done. Last time I drank a sauce, it did not go well for me in the pizza hut video. I drank the hot sauce at the end. And the next day I didn't feel good all day. Don't drink sauce as kids. If you learn one thing, that's it. Don't drink sauce. The hollow. Hollow. It's bloody time. The last dessert you saw as get was the... Oh, something really helio. Mace. Mace, it was corn. It was corn. It was corn and there was corn ice cream. This time, ube. It is corn ice cream. Which we haven't had other than a little bit in the hollow, hollow and divine. We had corn ice cream. We had ube red. Ube ice cream. And we've had ube pies. We have an ube cheesecake. It's ube is just such an interesting flavor. So we have to mix this without it. Mixing all over, flowing all over the bread was... It's like our make your own hollow. They gave us a plate. Oh my god. Look at that mixing action. More of a stabbing thing than a mixing. But everything is just moving up and down. You gotta get some of this. Bring it to the top. Oh. There's rice crispy. There's a lot of candy in here. Ube ice cream. Oh, that was a good mix there. What's this mix? Oh, it's like a blender. I am a human blender. I have been called that before. What's the context of when you were called the human blender? Back in college. I used to blend people all this. I don't know what that was. Oh my god. My mix mix is exploding. Alright, that's probably mixing up. It's all purple. Oh my gosh. Here we go. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh my god. Oh, there's all there. Candy. I think there's some bean in there. The beans really turn into like a sandy texture. Really? That's cold. It's hard because my teeth are sensitive. Same. But there's things in here that you have to chew. It's not just ice cream or anything. And I'd never chew ice cream. So you get a chew with the hollow hotness. And look at that. I don't even usually chew the ice cubes. That's delicious. That's really, really good. That is so much better than the Dubai one. Really? So much better. Okay, Dubai. Sorry, but you kind of suck. We've got a whole piece of, oh, yeah, ice cream. That's not mix mix. Oh. Oh. It's a blender and actually. You and blender are going for us. It really all just turned purple. It has now become ube. Ube no quick candy. Thank you very much. Oh, man, it's good. Oh, I don't like the bottom. Is it intense? I think so. So, me sour in there? Wow, it's good. Yeah, it's kind of, oh, let's go. Unfortunately, I'm not the cold, the human blender. So I don't know if I'll mix it and it will. It's not going to be as good. I'm really going to. Before. Layers, see those layers. After. Mix. Mix. It's so cold. I can literally just go. How does the proper way to eat it? I think so. Just drink it like that. Okay. I think that's what you told me, right? Oh, I just got ice water. Yummy. The eruption. Are you sure that you weren't called the human mini blender? I was, what's a brand of blender, like Ninja or something? Ninja? They call me Ninja. And not because I'm a blender, it's because I'm a pro Fortnite gamer. Tyler Pleven? Tyler Pleven. That's going to confuse people. Now they're going to think you're Tyler. True, my name is Isaac. Also known as Tyler Pleven. Tyler's behind the camera. Oh, that's pretty, it's not the purpleness of mine. But it's pretty mixed mixed. Wow, there's so many colors. What's the weirdest thing in there? I feel like it's fetching out. He's really observing his mix mix. Oh, that's the bite right there. I don't know what this is. I still don't know what it is, but it's very sweet. Oh, yummy. I only ended up with Ube. Oh, it's so cold. It is honestly crazy how much better it is than the Dubai one. It's 100 times. The Dubai one was just very icy. This one, even though there's still the ice in it, it actually has sweetness with it. The only thing that can't compare is the hollow hollow that I made. I think that one might be top 10 hollow hollows we've had. Yummy, yummy, yummy. Oh, that's so good. Every bite. It's so sweet. That's crazy. And that's hollow, everybody. I'm very satisfied with the hollow hollow experience here. Our first time in the Philippines, we're still on the mission. To find the best hollow hollow in Manila. Where is it? Let us know. Compare some video. Coming soon. Thank you all for watching this amazing video at the Aristocrat restaurant. And thank you to all who suggested it. It was very tasty and we are happy with our experience here. See you later.
