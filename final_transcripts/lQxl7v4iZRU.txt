 What's up guys my name is Miles and my name is Fest and this is the commodity and today we are reacting to eight days in the Philippines. This video has been widely requested fest in it to me this morning and said we needed to take a look at it. So yeah we skipped quite a few other videos that we were like maybe this one is going to be a good video blah blah and I was like no we have been literally suggested since our first Philippines video which is only like what three videos ago. As far as Philippine videos like 20 people in each video are like do eight days in the Philippines so yeah here we go we're finally getting there and when I looked it up I haven't watched any of them but I did see there was quite a few reactions on it and all the thumbnails looked like either like horrified or sad so I have no idea what to expect from this. I haven't even looked at it. I haven't even looked it up. I just go to the comments and I see let me see here let me pull up our comments real quick. I can even tell you like in two seconds let's see here straight to the Philippine video. Philippines somebody told us how much the dollars worth which thank you win crews. Shout out. So and it's also funny that everybody's giving us a different number of yeah islands so same guy win crews told us 71.07 and then further down it was like 75 something and then here's another one top viral please react to the eight days in the Philippines you will have an idea how much it will cost to you to spend vacation in the Philippines things. I mean it's just the please react to commercial of jolly bee salamat poh that should be coming thank you K.A. Aluminum channel I mean there's tons that's been coming through about the Philippines it's so great and I we highly highly appreciate it yeah one dollar is 50 pesos so I love the fact that they use pesos yeah I think they're actually worth more in the Philippines actually it's not but it's pretty close as in Mexico yeah I think it's like eight or 12 pesos to the dollar thank you been money low pass the last name what's up guys excuse my sniffling and his coughing will try and edit it out as much as possible so yeah 100% just do it. Eight days and eight minutes so I'm traveling today to this country called the Philippines and the country's tagline is it's more fun and the Philippines the Thai food airport fun going with playing fun leaving the plane is eating more fun getting your local sim card is finally fun why do you like this video yeah people smile even security guards smile I want to see if I can have food water shelter for the whole day for $0.00 here in Manila I give up my valuables by drawing and my entire wallet and checked out of the hotel to hit the stretch the same jungle yeah it's about a year I cannot take buses or taxes I cannot eat out but what I can do is rely on people's generosity for water I say I'm thirsty thank you so that's one thing so he'd mentioned he was Muslim yeah so that is one thing that I've learned so I'm a Christian I'm a Christian and I mean as far as I think that's just one of those key factors to just about every religion is take care of people take care of other people yeah no matter who they are and I hate to admit it that the first time I really started learning about Islam was in such a negative way yeah during 9-11 before that because you got to understand I was 18 years old I had 9-11 had just happened and everything that had to do with Muslims at that time was 100% negative yeah and I hate to admit it like I was never one of the people that were pro like anti Muslim or whatever because that was a huge deal I mean and from us it kind of almost made sense but it never really did make sense now don't get me wrong but after starting this channel and learning about other cultures and other religions I'm so happy I have yeah yeah like everything that I had learned growing up from 9-11 to a few years ago I'm glad none of the stuff was true yeah I'm so happy so I just thought I had to say that unbelievable but for shelter this is a bit hard I say I'm stranded I ask one two three four five six seven people and then I meet this guy it's a long story he takes me in buys me food offers me his home gives me his bed and doesn't even want to be there there is still good in this world that's one minute see you tomorrow thank you money I don't like spending it that's why I like the Philippines it's very cheap where's he from did he say where he was from? that's not an American accent I hate for $17 a Hong Kong here you can get it for $1 an Uber ride for one hour we'll cost you $3 welcome to the Philippines in romantic day for two we'll set you back $15 now you're not going to go on a date I'm hop wait how much did he say? here go back I see we'll start here okay I hear cut the Hong Kong $7 here you can get it for $1 an Uber ride for one hour we'll cost you $3 welcome to the Philippines in romantic day for two we'll set you back $15 now you're not going to go on a date I'm hop and get a haircut every single day but what I think you might like to do is drink so just a real oh we just hit your spot that's my spot that's your spot so one of the things that okay so I like to take my ex-wife and my two kids out to eat as much as possible because I feel like that's a chance I still have a great relationship with my ex-wife we are like basically I hope that we're best friends yeah like I'd never want to lose that relationship with her so we go out to eat I have a five-year-old and a two-year-old and we order two children's meals really we make it to where we they share both meals so it kind of breaks down and then we'll take whatever's left over home but it costs for two adult meals and two children's meals almost every time at a traditional like I would call them fast food sit-downs like I don't know if you all have them but it's like all of garden or what's the big ones? Chili's. Chili's like Chili's was the last one we went to and it was $50 almost every single time 48 bucks 52 dollars and we get two regular drinks and then we get children's drinks and then so when I take my daughter on dates I spend at least 40 bucks that's just two my daughter is a two-year-old and I'm that's great that's expensive you're going to stay counted yeah we're going to like a regular place and it's still costing our money like so yeah I respect that even if you add two children to that I'm sure it's only like another four bucks yeah yeah it's so cheap in the Philippines that this bottle of hot costs one dollar and ten cents yes I would do that I would get a lot of drink yeah we got to do that if we ever go to the Philippines I'm I'm having a big party with you guys I love this video oh I do too this is the most positive thing yeah these islands are gorgeous but watching it from your phone you will get bored after five seconds so let me tell you what makes this place incredible above water it's heaven or earth even when there is no sun but it's not just what's above the water and on the water that's beautiful it's also what's hiding underneath that was a great transition yeah dude you know what I would love to do I know this is so off topic is get an underwater cage for the black magic camera yeah so we could get the problem is it's we'd have to find some way to actually focus it yeah but it would be I mean we're talking the some of the best quality underwater unless you have like a a red or something crazy or you know yeah but it would be so awesome because all the places that we're looking at are either archipelago's or very heavily surrounded by water we'll just take our GoPro's oh yeah but there's no comparison yeah I would love to do that especially with all those colors oh I'd pop off he's a great storyteller I like him a lot he's standing in a perfect construction and two that's what I'd like to do go right around every dope that's cool beautiful she's angry that tip of her erupts every three to five years wow that is deadly angry but best of all she is perfect the most perfect human being nature has to offer that's me on that's one minute see you tomorrow so I got to ask can we rent those I'm assuming we can they stop him doing it yeah and of course he probably said it and I'm so just astonished by the views that I'm kind of like I try to listen to everything he's saying I'm just like I just want to go there and visit yeah it looks like it's almost perfectly sloped that you could just ride straight up the side of it which I'm sure yeah I'm sure you can't but it looks for not dude this is like hands down we're subscribing to him number one oh yeah just based off of this video we didn't know what to expect and I hope one day when we are able to travel finally that we have people reacting to our videos yeah like this because this is such a positive video yeah even if there's negative videos because you kind of got to have to point out the negative what I think he's about to because it just showed poverty okay the next topic so I mean there's always a with all positives work hard people yeah even in the Ferrari F50 there's some negatives yeah so the last five days I've always stayed in the richest parts of the Philippines and so it's easy for me to believe that all the Philippines looks like this but it's not only one cab right away from here you arrive here at the trash mountain where people live in such extreme poverty that the air is unpleasant to smell but this isn't just this area 25% of the Philippines live under the poverty line it's incredible that under the same city roof you can lunch like this and dinner like this green stuff coming from the ground means it's beautiful nature in this case it means there's so much trash pile on top of each other that it formed a mountain where actual people live and plants started to grow the country's tagline is it's more fun in the Philippines but I think a more appropriate one is it's more fun in 75% of the Philippines that sucks so yeah that that's I think that's a sad part of almost every country yeah at least to a certain percentage there's a lot of poverty here in Dallas and that's one of so that's one of the areas that I think the government can fix could fix if they were willing to like I joke about it all the time I'm I'm very open into and I hate to bring it up but pot and some states have legalized marijuana and the money that can be raised from things like that right that are not legal everywhere or whatever the case may be could be put towards those things um like even tobacco taxes right even taxes from alcohol and all these things that are already legal everywhere or most places could be used to help out poverty right it's just we choose not to exact or our politicians choose not to right because they're they want to put the money out to where that helps their own agendas and a lot of and I honestly think a lot of people political views don't want to help out right and that's where I think well I'm okay with paying taxes if it does help out people that because okay so the and I know this is going off of this whole video but the American uh what do they call it the the American uh dream is life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and the American dream has also been you can be anything you never want to be right as long as you're willing to work for it however there are certain situations that no matter what you do you might not be able to rise above and those people need help and it seems like the Philippines kind of are in the same place they have the ability to rise above because unless you're in a caste system it seems like you can grow but a lot of these people seem like they're so pushed far down and forgotten about and the government isn't willing to spend the money or whatever the case may be that we're not able they're not able to grow above it right like they fell so deep in the hole that they can't climb out yeah and it doesn't hurt to throw a rope or help out somebody and that's what this video is all about is being helpful and all that kind of stuff and loving so even like I'm saying it's not the Philippines it's not just the US it's literally literally yeah we need to figure out a way to do so sorry that's like one of the things that I actually care about so I kind of went off on a tangent so I said it before and I'm gonna say it again the Philippines is cheap which means you don't need many dollars to come here and see this piece of beauty but it also means you don't need many dollars to help those that need help it's so cheap in here that we can buy this burger with me and all or 20 cents wow 20 cents and for that price you can buy a thousand of these burgers without breaking the bank and in a place where people are so poor the trash forms an actual mountain you can form an actual mountain of foods for the price of one African hotel stay in New York City and with that you can feed up to it that's awesome that's exactly what I'm talking about that's something I would want to do I would want to do that in a hard but it also means it's not that hard or expensive to help those in need that's what we did see I love it yeah that's awesome hi it's my last day in the islands in the Philippines I'm sad but he was everything that I like about this country it's a country with more than 7,000 islands which means this and this and this exist here this volcano and this volcano also exist here the prices they're so cheap you can get a whole village drunk or another poor village fed without breaking the bank but reality is in some parts poverty so extreme people are atop of a trash mountain or an agrarian with a dead but you can google all of them yeah leave you hanging bro the people they will be generous they will feed you and they will host you without knowing they will build good startups and they will probably like crazy but best of all they will be your friend real friends the country's tagline is it's more fun in the Philippines but I don't like that in better terms is there's more love in the Philippines I like that oh that's one minute beautiful video that was great yeah that was one of the favorite videos that I've watched yeah period yeah nice the positivity they came from that the presentation he was able to present a situation a negative situation and then show that there's a way around it in a minute yeah in one minute literally one minute technically too yeah because the first one was one minute then the second was a minute so he proved that you could go eat like if every tourist that went there it's been an extra 150 bucks it would change so much yeah like I if we go to the Philippines we 100% are gonna figure something oh yeah around that even if we have to go and raise money here to take over there we're gonna have a blast but we're gonna be able to help people yeah 100% the hard part here is it does cost a lot oh it does like every now and then like if so when I say there's poverty here it's been mostly like the major city in fact some cities here are towns around Dallas don't allow paying handling is what we call it or begging whatever you want to call it and they'll kick people that don't have a home out of the city which is a horrible way to do it or the town and it's usually the suburbs so they're all kind of centrally located and I used to actually feed the the homeless with a company called big hearts I believe I'll be honest I was drugged to it by a girl that I like but it felt really good but it wasn't my heart that was doing it it was hers and I did it for it girl yeah so I'm not gonna say here and lie to you and make up some stuff but every now and then like if we go out to eat and then we come out and we have leftovers and there's somebody kind of walking around and we can tell that they're homeless you know I'll go and offer the food because just what I don't need is some leftover food that's garbage for me right when it could actually help somebody out yeah but like in the the downfall is if somebody's homeless in their alcoholics or whatever the case may be sometimes I'll even buy them a beer because if I give them five bucks or whatever the case might be they're gonna go buy a beer right so I mean I know it's a horrible concept but I've done it well that could be weather homeless that's true but that that's what I'm saying they're probably homeless because they're alcohol yeah because they they wrote they spend all their money on it but if I give them five bucks what are the odds that they're not gonna go buy out exactly like if I help the homeless it's usually food yeah usually it is but if I know that they are gonna go buy a beer I'll just just show them a little bit of love I know it's not the ideal way of doing it but it makes them happy yeah yeah like if they're gonna be homeless and they're not gonna change their ways make them happy give them one one little glimpse of happiness yeah this is one of the most positive travel videos that I've seen oh yeah in our channel's history
