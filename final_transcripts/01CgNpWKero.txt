 Aka, what do play people from different countries call the same thing. We're gonna see what they say in English. Heck yeah. Could be in the Philippines, India, Singapore, and the US. So yeah, let's check this out. We've actually been to the US. We're there. We've been to the Philippines there right now. And we're in India last year. If you want to check out our travel channel, check it out, link in the description. We got vlogs from all of those great countries. We'll have some extra input, too. We might know some of these things that they call other than Singapore. We probably want to know anything about Singapore. Let's do this. Oh. If you are talking about the actual... Well, it's the version. We skip the intro. But if you're talking about the room, then we call it the bathroom. Bathroom? Bathroom? Bathroom? Bathroom? On the sign, it'll say like ladies room, men's room, something like that. But yeah, bathroom, if you're talking about the room. Bathroom might also be a regional thing. Some people may say restroom. But if you go to bathroom, you'll bathroom. Bathroom? Bathroom? Bathroom? A wrong washroom? So in the Philippines, we say... YAR. YAR. Comfort room. Oh, this is the same thing. YAR. Because when we go out of the Philippines, people won't understand. Yeah, no way. Philippines is unique. Because I feel like that's the only country that actually... That's something different for the bathroom. That isn't like in a few other countries. Or a lot. You also use bathroom. Yeah. And for both you and we also use bathroom. Yeah, I'm guessing it's toilet. It kind of makes sense when you think about it. I don't remember. Yeah. Comfort room. I just want to talk. If you say CR, it'll be a little bit bad. It depends on the comfort room. Sometimes a little bit uncomfortable. I've never heard that before. Yeah. I'm not sure. Well, in India, we just say... It really depends. Just like what Kelly said. We'd say a washroom. It would be sometimes to say toilet. And sometimes when you go to the washroom or toilet, you'd see WC, where's a not in the bathroom. Well, of course it. But it won't. It's very comfortable. It's a scientific way. It's something that NASA would use over a national space station, whatever. But you'd see WC, where's a not in? Or you'd see... Or you would just use toilet or washroom and people would understand. You should start throwing the toilet at our own place. We call it the compost. compost room? Compost room? CR? It would still be the CR. We just say it stands for compost. It's interesting that you said WC means waste compartment. Because I would think of it as water closet. Well, you won't, of course it. Nothing for a bathroom as well. The water closet? Probably. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, that's one of the waste compartment. Yeah. In the US, we would call this egg plant. So in Singapore, we use brinjo. And look, we use eggplant as well. This one? This one? Of this point, like a different way. Yeah. It seems like... I think they call them something different in the UK. I think they feel good. I feel like egg plant is always kind of the weird term for this. Whenever I think we call it egg plant, the same way. What is egg plant? It's aubergine. I hear aubergine. I think that's the kind of thing. Aubergine? You always eat. You just gotta say bloody. So, it's a bloody egg plant. And then it's just UK. It's egg plant aubergine. And palon. Palon. Palon. Dalong India. Or this like... Oh, really? Yeah. Because we use English and Philphiro. Well, in India, we would say brinjal. I have absolutely no idea where this work comes from. But I was recently, I was watching a video and one of the where, you know, favorite famous personalities from India. He is, you know, a very well-educated man. And we sort of... He has a trick for very tricky English words. He brings out these new English words from nowhere. And he said that brinjal is not even a word. Oh, we have been using brinjal over whole lives. Wow. I do often listen to that. I, that's the mention of my hate. Yeah. It's like duck in your mind. I remember. You know? But we would say brinjal a lot. Brinjal isn't very good. But I think they're also influenced by it. Do you referring to the name or the actual food? The food. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. But we mostly use brinjal. In the US, I believe we have many terms for this. Um, dressing room, changing room, and fitting room. I thought it was fitting room. I think all of that. Like window with... Yeah. I think in all of any... Honestly, I thought I was like, what is that like a full-tellers of things? I know dressing room. No, what you're talking about. Yeah. Well, it's a single point of saying that... You know what that Nike... Like a jewel? Yeah. Like, I'd say 70% of the time people were pretty wide-footed in the fitting room. Uh, usually we just write, oh, what's the change room? Oh, that was the fitting room. Yeah. Quite similar room. Yeah, yeah. And the Philippines also, since we... About the American English. We use fitting room or changing room. Dressing room? No, dressing room. Not really. Not really. No. No, really. Okay, okay. Well, in India, we use, again, interchangeably. We use trial room. trial room. Makes sense, I guess. I think it's an Indian English thing. We just say trial room. Do you want to go for a trial? You know? It's a scary thing. It's all the sounds like you want to take this for a test drive? Yeah. It's kind of what it sounds like, but, yeah, that's just what we say. We say, do you want to go for a trial? I want to go to the trial room. But then again, obviously, we also see a fitting room. Uh, do you want to see how it fits? We just want to go to the fitting room. You know, we use both of those in the changing room. But mostly trial room. So you can say, do you want to go for a trial? Like, you want to try the time? I would think they're like going to court or something. You know, like, let's go to the trial room. Like, what did he make sense? You want to give me a trial room? Like, trying something like trial room. Yeah. You can't even make sense. Yeah. Not only you mentioned about it, you really mean something. Right. But I get what Kelly just mentioned. It just sounds like I'm dragging it to court. Yeah, it's a court. It's so scary. It's really scary. All right. We say our things. Then we just talk as girls. And we say that the dressing room is a scary place. Yeah. Yeah. The Swedish food. That's true. In the US, we would call this a gas station. In Singapore, we call it like a petrol station. Yeah, but I think we're in a petrol station. Hello. I think people are like, because they just, you know, like, gas pump. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, this is how you do it. When in doubt, do you charade? I need time. In the Philippines, you use gas station all of the sudden. It's weird. It's like petrol station. You think would be originate UK. They refer to it as petrol. I don't think almost every other country that would, was former UK, probably similar petrol possibly. And the US is what's former UK. And they'd say gas station. And then Philippines was former US. So they would say gas station also. It's very weird. A lot of the history is just the UK. Yeah. So the US got out of the UK before a lot of these things came out. Yeah. So they got their own words. So, you know, it's gasoline. Gasoline, gasoline, gasoline. Because like most of the, you know, the Spanish. A place the ending would be on or hand. And in India, we would say petrol pump. We're pumping petrol in the car. We literally take those words and we say petrol pump. So pump would mean the actual building as well or would it just mean that it's like a station. It's a place where we go. But we just don't see stations. It's amazing. We say we just, we just call it the petrol pump. We should be saying petrol pump station. But we have to do something. What do you call the pump? Also the pump? Okay. Okay. Okay. Like the pumps at the pump. The pump. In the US, we would call it movie theaters. Some people might call it the cinema. Well, in Singapore, we just do scene. Yeah. It's spelled specifically PHE. I don't really put it in. Yeah, so you just do. No, that R.E. is not. No, I get that out of here. Or Sinahan. Like the one I told you earlier. Yeah. So like Sina is cinema. And then where you watch the scene. Okay. Well, in India, we say cinema hall. But that's, I mean. We went to movie theater in India. But the title of our video was movie theater. We should have said cinema hall. Yeah. Yeah. We say theater. Um, we, people would understand. But that case, movie theater. In the US, we would call it a round of people. Actually, around the house. Round of people. We didn't talk good enough. But, I mean, I said like round about before. I mean, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I mean, I said like round about before. So you do that. You look for in the picture. I think like, um, like what they want to refer to it. Like professionally in the US is traffic circle. Yes. But everyone just calls it round about another weird name for it. I don't know. Yeah. I, those are the two of us. For sure, I've heard the most round about being way higher up. I don't know if I've ever heard a real person say traffic circle. No, I only hear it on Google Maps. Yeah. So, I don't know if I've ever heard a real person say traffic circle. Take the third exit. It's like what they, uh, businesses want. Traffic circle. Professional. You know the cross, the cross, the cross, the cross, the cross. I heard a cross. I've never used it in my life. Yeah. Where else is the street on the road? Routon, roadtund. Routon, roadtund. Routunding around the circle. Yeah. Have we seen a roadtund here? There's the big one around K-Zone. Oh, yeah. Just like a massive. Yeah. I have like a round hall, I guess. Yeah, I would call it that. I guess I would call it that. It's like, it's mostly just a small, a circle. Circle hall. Circle hall or, yeah, go through the circle. Right, right, right. Right, right. In India, we would say round about. Round about. Okay. Okay. In the US, you would say, yeah, turn right, turn left. Or this has been brought up many times in these videos. Um, in Michigan. At least I think in Michigan people would say, hang a Louis for turn left. Hang a Louis. Yeah, hang a Louis. Yeah. A place that's pretty close to me. This left. You would not say that. That's a right word. Yeah, if there's a right one, I don't know it. Yeah. It should be enough as you would for right. It's all right. We're close to Canada. And a comedian girl told me that they said hang a Roger. I think. Hang a Roger. Hang a Roger, she said. Yeah, Roger. So. This is a good left. I'm like, I don't know. Left, left, left, left, left. This is my family thing. Or, I don't know where I'm getting this, but hang a Louis. I guess I got my hang a Roger. Those Michiganies are very, very, very, extremely, members. Yeah. Yeah. I was surprised by a lot of them, the WC, the WC, the WC, the WC, the WC. And then the CR. And the R was really interesting for me. And then they use this other... What? Oh, hang a Louis. Hang a Louis. Hang a Louis. I don't know how, like, we would have mash up the Indian and American and the Michigan way of saying it. And they should say, take a Louis and take a Roger. It's gonna sound very weird. So today we talk about what difference among 20 furniture. Very thick. Interesting. Well, not really. Leave a comment. We'll see you soon. Not really. Like, that stark of like differences between the different. Things you could pretty much tell what each one was. And maybe instead of CR, if you've never been to the Philippines, you'd be like, Yeah, there's a few where like, we were like a little bit shocked when we first heard them. But then at that point, we know them. So now we just go CR, if you are, CR, if you are, fill out, fill out. Yep. You got to do it in a Filipino accent too or a different. CR. But yeah. So these are pretty interesting to see. I mean, every country is different. Every country says, even like McDonald. Some people has pointed out to us like, why do you say McDonald's is Mac Donalds? Yeah. It's some people can say things differently for countries. It's called accents. Yeah. They exist. And then it's also interesting to examine like, what's the difference between like an accent and getting in a different language at that point? Because sometimes they mesh and sometimes you never know. But that's our video for today. Hopefully you enjoyed. If you did subscribe, like the video. Check out the Travel Channel. Bye.
