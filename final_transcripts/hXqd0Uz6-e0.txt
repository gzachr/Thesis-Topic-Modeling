 Hello! Peepoppers, it's time for the Olympics. Peepoppers. We heard that the Philippines won their first ever Olympic gold medal and we watch a lot of Philippines videos and we know we have a lot of Philippine viewers so we figured we heard about this we might as well see what it's all about and react to this person winning. Yeah. So we'll see what it for. It doesn't say. Once you find out. First ever Peepopland Olympic gold medal. Congratulations to the Philippines and to Hiddeland Diaz for winning it. That's pretty cool. But uh, yeah I can't imagine how that would feel. Let's see what she had to do for this. Day three in weightlifting and trophy. Weightlifting, okay. The competition of these games now women's 55 kilograms. The first three between the men and the women all won by China. Yeah. Opening snatch 92 kilos over 202 pounds. Wow. Wow. All cute. You showing why she is number one. What is it? She just broke her arms. She's number one. Apparently. Oh. Diaz. She's one of the best in the world. Opening snatch 94 kilos. She could be us both up at the same time. Yeah. She could be us both up at the same time. Barely a sweat. Two for two three wide lights. Second attempt 97 kilos. Diaz. Elevator movement. Pupped up. How do you feel? Three wide lights. That hurt your arms. That's too good. Yeah. Definitely. Lao Q. You and how about the third attempt being better than the first two. Take about three wide lights. That was impressive. Diaz. Just not there. What a snatch of 97. After that point. Staring at nearly 260 pounds on the bar. Lao Q. You and with the clean. And the jerk. Good form. She'll try to give China. She is. The clean. Clean is there. And the jerk for Diaz. Looks like it is to her face. Yeah. The competition. And the first place. She's right. Lift in the clean and jerk. Remember she lifted 129 kilos in the clean and jerk two years ago at the World Championships. A world record. You know, he's. Halfway home. Jerks it. And Lao Q. You and showing. She's the rating world champion with three wide lights. She's five of five. Zool. Zool. Fiat. Shachan. From Kazakhstan. Back on the platform. Remember the jury took away her first lift at 123. Same amount for her second try in the clean and jerk. For bronze. Shachan. Low. Can't she jerk it? Hey, she made the first one like easy. Three wide lights. And onto the medal stand. Zool. Fiat. Shachan. Low. Just barely. But good enough. I didn't even notice his run. 124 kilograms. Second lift in the clean and jerk. I got like nervous. I was like, what is it? Drop that on himself. For first place. It is. No, it's clean. Can't she jerk it? On. Did she. Hey. Oh, yes. For Diaz. Into first. Another Olympic record. 126 kilograms. Over 277 pounds. Please. Almost 300 pounds. Can't she jerk it? Low. Cue you. Oh, my. Listen up like this. Three wide lights. Six for six. Knocks down all her legs. That's like it. That's like as much as I can do this. And then having to lift it like that. Johnny's gold. You can't do better than that as a weightlifter. Making all six of these lifts. She's certainly put herself in the best position for the gold medal. Four gold. And so verandrio will it be gold and Tokyo? Get out. Get out. Halfway through. For gold. Oh, hang on. Did she jerk it? Wow. Diaz did. Three wide lights. Very action. It's gold for the Philippines. I mean, going up against the one from. Excuse it. Former World Champion. Yeah, she looked like he was like unstoppable. And long last day. The Philippines with its first ever Olympic gold medal in any sport. And it comes in women's weightlifting. That's awesome. Wow. Yeah, that's sick. She just excited. Yeah, after she did it. Yeah. This is so cool to see because she probably works so hard for that for herself. Oh, yeah. For sure. And then she did it. And yeah, to like have to like, bump keep bumping it up every time. Especially after she messed up that one. Mm-hmm. She's probably like, oh no. Oh no. I lost it for myself. All the work I've done. I lost it. The Philippines. I've had. She did it. She did it. Ah. That's insane. What was it? Yeah, was it just the 277 or was it another one up? I think it was another kilogram up. So I'm not very metrically inclined. Oh, that's such a hard thing to like go like that. Declining soft. We still have to do it for basketball. And it was the worst basketball. Yeah. Muscles and basketball. Kevin Durant can't even lift his own body away. But uh, yeah. Okay, there are some strong women in this competition that could beat us up. Yeah. We should go to the gym and try to recreate that. I wouldn't be able to lift it. I don't think I can then lift that. I definitely couldn't then lift that. But yeah, that's pretty cool. Hopefully this video is able to go up. I don't know if they've filled my piece of block or not. But uh, it's cool. It's cool to see that. Congrats Philippines. Yeah. Because there's other Olympic stuff from other countries that you guys like us just check out because I know the Olympics is happening right now. We should be reacting to it now. And we react to international countries and international stuff. So this is like the biggest international thing you could do. Yeah. Yeah.
