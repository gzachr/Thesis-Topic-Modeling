It was a joke, you cannot take it, but I didn't understand Kurya, sometimes I don't understand
perfectly Tagalog.
Guys, hope everyone is well, early morning, sunnysday and today I am here with Kuyarino
on my back, and he started already and today we are going to cut all the bamboo here at
my back.
Finally we found help, thank you so much Kuyarino for being with us today and look at here guys,
he will help us to cut all this bamboo.
Kuyarino is way better than me actually, I've already removed the first bamboo that was
here that was really big and now it's cutting everything we will save some of
this bamboo the ball of Kuya is really sharp actually look at you guys in a few
minutes already we have removed this big part this will be a really big help for
us and later we will show you on the back over here he will remove also all
these look at my bolo here and look at the ball of Kuya the ball of Kuya is
super sharp compare mine so guys we are proceeding well we are cleaning now here
actually here is my bolo the ball of Kuya is way more sharp so with him we'll
make it really more faster I bought this actually in the Palenque we bought it
for 450 or 500 pesos but apparently it's not one of the best we are moving on the
back of our property this is our wall outside the boundary and we will need to
remove all these huge bamboo and as you can see here on my back is really
totally a jungle of bamboo it's really thick the bamboo are really big look at
here the stem guys are so so huge these are the roots of some bamboo I think
look at here so big
and the problem you can see that all this bamboo was really coming inside and
it will be a bit of hard work but we really need to remove it all because
there is too much shade inside the property also here in this corner we'll probably
clean it all this way we will have also more sun coming in and for the vegetable garden
will be better so guys it's 30 minutes just that we started 30-40 minutes and look at here
we've already piled so much bamboo and Kuya is now on top of there on top of
the wall cutting all the bamboo over here we're ready done a lot with the help of
Kuya this will be done really fast and guys look at here how big this bamboo
was and with this actually I'm planning to do something we will try to make
glasses during our travel we saw that some people are using this big bamboo
for glasses I'm just curious we will try to make it one let's see if I will be
able to and guys cutting the bamboo we saw also a nest bee I don't know if you
can see it is just over there yes we need to cut it Kuya we need to before
make sure that the bee will go away and maybe if we can transfer move it
somewhere we will because of course we really need to cut that part forks are
proceeding well now is around two hours that we are working Kuya is already
there look at there is now removing all and this will be the next a bit more and
maybe also even finish
Kuya is now cleaning all this bamboo it's actually really complicated to do this
work because the bamboo is actually itchy plus it's full of not thorns but
other stick that coming out it's not just one long it's one with a lot of
many of these that are going everywhere and you really need to be careful that
are not going inside your eyes it's really my wrap and with Kuya now we are
trying to save more bamboo as possible because maybe we can use it for creating
some structure for our vegetable garden here are already some for the happiness
of Teresita we have one huge of these we will enjoy to create some soup with
