 Music Hello everyone, good afternoon And welcome again, we're back again on Coconut Bay We're spending a few hours here at Coconut Bay just to get out of the house If you're wondering why we wearing masks, that's the reason It's a rule, we have to follow the rules Yeah, they have these rules, I think a little ridiculous rules set by the DLH, the Fortnite Health That we have to wear masks, there's no one around, I'm not sure what's the purpose of the mask But yeah, we don't want to get coconut bay in trouble, so we'll just follow the rules But yeah, so we're going to take a walk around, raise some questions to ask me And I'll see how it works Do we need to have social distancing as well? Yeah, I guess, maybe I'll skip a meter away Yeah, hey guys, so let's get started So, what are we talking about, honey? I just want to discuss about expectation versus reality Expectations versus reality of what? Living here in the Philippines, I mean what are expectations? Do you have any expectations before you come here? Did I have any expectations? I did, yeah Before coming to the Philippines All right, yeah, what I want to say is I guess everyone has some kind of expectations Before they move to a new place, you have all these ideas And what you think it's going to be like and what you're going to do But yeah, the reality is always a little different Okay I don't know, anything specific you can think of? Well, do you have like imaginations or ideas what the Philippines looks like? Well, I have come here to visit before So, yeah, before I decided to move here I did come and visit Grace quite a few times And it's been a year prior to visiting her So, we just came around to the guy I'm losing you Oh, we can't go through there We can't go through there I know And start there Few engineers later You're saying Yeah, you have ideas before you come and visit Philippines So, yeah, I said, yeah, we have been here a few times Probably like one, two, three or four months came to visit her But before that Before that? Yeah, you don't have any idea what Philippines looks like Yeah, so, but do you have like some ambition of it? You expect something like it's going to be? Well, sure, when you hear Philippines is a tropical country And you see photos of Boracay You imagine all these white beaches And palm trees everywhere And the ideal tropical island spot So, yeah, if I had to refer to When I came When I actually came to visit you the first time I mean, where Grace lives, I guess In Kageando Aura I mean, you have to really go out of the city area To find something With a white beach But here, on the coast, here You guys have seen the previous videos There's no real white tropical beaches and stuff But I mean, here is still very mountainous And beautiful trees, palm trees, and stuff like that So, I guess, yeah, I guess in that way I guess you could call it a little disappointment Yes, in a way that you expected these clear blue water And white beaches, you know So, in that way, yeah, when you came here and saw Ah, yes, only Grace Wow, I'm sure Let's have a look You look here behind us, right? It's a grey sand It's grey sand, yeah, it's not a white beach And the water itself as well I guess Water itself, yeah, it's not the blue clear tropical waters I think it's a reason for it here I mean, there's a lot of rivers running into the ocean Yeah, it's just close here, there's a river And sometimes when it's flooded, it's the mud pushed through the ocean That's right, yeah, so I mean, I mean, the sugar swam there, I have swam there before You did liar I did liar So, yeah, I could still enjoy the water I mean, it's not the ideal tropical holiday spot, put it that way But you can drive like 45 minutes away from here And find a white beach in Imi Tau That's quite nice, over there It's very cold, it's very cold It's very cold, it's very cold It's weird, look at ourself, right? And here he is Yeah, funny how it's a breeze It's weird Anyway, so expectations, the first time, yeah I mean, of course, you have different expectations You didn't know what to expect really The first time I came here But I mean, after visiting here a few times We're talking about coming to living in the Philippines I mean, yeah, I mean, I always said I love fishing, I love snorkeling And I thought I was going to do a lot of that when I get here But the reality is, yes, once you get here, it's the other stuff happening You know, you're living your life Put it that way, you know, we also have to make a living I'm not retired or anything, I'm living off retirement So we need find ways to make a living So yeah, after about three months, I started working And the work keeps you busy sometimes It was a new job, she has a few small businesses That she was running at the beginning That kept her busy enough Now she's doing the wedding coordinating and planning And she gets a customer, she needs to focus on that as well So you end up living a life as you would anywhere else Making a living, doing the work I think the big difference is the lifestyle Yeah, it's a much more relaxing lifestyle to what I was used to Maybe before like in China where I lived in the city All the hassle and bustle from the city You know, I quickly grew tired of that And here, yeah, you feel, you always feel closer to nature And go certainly Most importantly, we decided to move here to be with Grace Yes, and we saw the life together So I mean, that takes a big difference Having someone you love next to your side Some will maybe come here to live with the partner Others might come here but themselves So love So very much depends on your lifestyle And the reason why you came here My main reason is that you're living in a living place My main reason was to be with Grace And I've watched it be together So, and we managed to do that Yes, successfully We've been here now for three and a half years already Together, living together Of course Living together three and a half years But we're turning eight years this time Next month We uh Okay We mentioned another blog that of four years of that is long this time That's right So, we've been together almost eight years But anyway So, anyway, so you We've discussed before that you never really had an idea what Philippines Or you never really thought there is Philippines, it's yours You're honest, yeah, well I remember when I moved to China I lived in China for almost five years And the first time I met a Filipino Was in China It was quite a few Filipinos playing in the light bands And I'm going to the bar, I met some of them And that's when that could Philippines on the map for me And I started inquiring about it Finding out more about the Philippines And the Filipinos I met in China And you're there In conversation, just the type of people I was So you have an idea already Of some Filipino personality view Can I say that? Well, I mean, I met a few I mean, we're talking about maybe six or seven Filipinos that I've met in China So you have really a little, just a little Like idea I think the question for you I realized that Very easygoing people, very easy to get along with So I kind of set my mind, that's the kind of people they are Very simple, very easygoing Wow, take that again Simple, and easygoing Anyways, my question for you is When you're living here for two years now So how was it? What did you discover about Filipinos? Well, the fact that everyone is very easygoing in general And enjoying a simple lifestyle, enjoying the simple things in life You know, they can just sit around the table and have fun And have a laugh, enjoy a conversation So they can enjoy the simple things in life And we should really be appreciating and enjoying And another thing I learned about Filipinos If you go out, you eat It's like, doesn't matter what's the occasion, they have to be food and a wife And make sure they're right Make sure they're right Right, right is life So yeah, that's not a thing that's very obvious, you know Without any food on the table, that's a very important part of the culture of the food here Yeah, of course And I don't know other things Well, like, we have to, I have to know, like, we do experience And also like, a little bad sign You can discover something about Filipinos That sign But just be careful, because we're near the ocean, I can throw you off I don't know what you're answer You're first Right I mean, I say bad things Spins you can avoid, you should only be aware of We actually discussed that in a previous video When we talked about like crap mentality You know, it's the kind of, they love to gossip And maybe, you know, rumour spread maybe Through gossip, the information changes and stuff Yeah, it's spreading on Yeah, they love to talk and There's even a joke about it, I remember it now Like, if a single woman is eating like mango Green mango And then they will say, is she pregnant? All right Yeah, that mentality Yes, not a bad thing maybe is eating salt with your fruit Yeah, salt, of course That's a, yeah, so you see a few strange habits that you don't see everywhere Like, well, green mango with some salt But then I realized that you can almost eat any fruit with some salt And so there's some strange things that, you know, I just don't like That I wouldn't do I've tried it, but yeah, I don't see the purpose really But they like that flavor And that's just what they used to So it's not a bad thing, it's just a strange thing in a way Bad things, I think the worst thing for me really That I feel kind of disappointed about Is maybe things like litter Yeah So I mean, from my visits before I realized it's a third world country And the infrastructure is not that great So a very developing country With a lot of potential But yeah, like many third world countries You know, there's poor disposal of rubbish and stuff So you tend to see a lot of litter around And it's such a beautiful, beautiful country You know, all this beautiful landscape Natural scenery and then you find litter, you know, it just spoils it a little bit So I think that's the only thing I would call bad Yeah, that thing is just needs to be like developed And I mean, I think as the economy grow after Philippines But also a person to person, you know, we should also like To look at us also like We need more push to discipline about like just small piece of candy And they just throw it, you know Don't do that, just put it in your purse or pocket And when you got home, you just throw it in the garbage One step at a time, its person do that And then you will have less garbage You can see garbage all over Yeah, it starts with a certain mindset You know, it's, don't think of it as the government's problem Or someone else's problem, or a big problem Think of it as your problem And part of this world, this country And then it's nice to be like discipline ourselves sometimes Yeah, it's a beautiful country So yeah, I have to say the message to the Filipinos You have a really beautiful country Look after it, keep it clean Yeah, and look after your environment I myself, I'm guilty of that I'm guilty of that before I just throw a thing in this, on the ground You know, I just really didn't care But when I'm not him, I also like real life with him Yeah, more wear It's like, just like something is habit Just throwing even like half of anything just throw You know, just be responsible of your ways So yeah, that's probably to me, talking about something bad That's been the worst thing really That's what I read about attitude of Filipinos In general I'm not feeling general there, very simple, easy going attitude I mean, there's other things, I think we'll discuss in other blogs as well Things foreigners might want to be aware of When they come to the Philippines, we'll do that blog Maybe next time, we'll do a discussion about that But in general, I mean, I can't say bad attitude As we mentioned, they're crap mentality And maybe sensitivity Yeah, so they are proud Yeah, Filipinos are very proud, Filipinos So sometimes you might want to make a little joke on something But if the joke isn't bad taste and they feel it's offensive You know, it can be very sensitive to that So, I mean, as a foreigner living near you, you need to be aware of that They are sensitive people and they are proud as Filipinos So, I mean, even as a joke, yeah, make sure you're the joke is tasteful and understood Yeah I think, I don't know, any other pointers from expectations? What about food? Do you expect something like... Well, when I was before, the first arc, for the Pintin, I imagine Lots of seafood, lots of variety of seafood and tropical fruits I mean, I guess the reality was a little different It's not the abundance of seafood, you can always find fresh seafood Why looking like that? If you go to the market, can you always find your parrotfish? Depends where a market you are, which market you are? If you go to big markets like in Kungo So, you're saying, I mean, it's like where we live, you know? I still thought that stuff will be easily available We're living right on the ocean I mean, here are you, many times, rely on whatever comes from the other markets, maybe I mean, food that is always available, you're always going to find seafood available Maybe not always the exact variety you're looking for, but there is always some fresh seafood Yes, depending on your budget as well And of course, you're going to budget If you can't afford seafood, then go to the dried food And tropical fruits, it's also, yeah, some fruits are seasonal You're not going to find it, even though tropical country doesn't mean you find it all year round It's still seasonal, some tropical fruits is available only certain times of the year Like my marang, I love marang Marang, yeah I just speak very hard, you're marang My way called this face mask is slipping Maybe because I have a really long nose, not like yours Maybe opening mouth to dig Yeah, so little things like that about food, but in general, I love the food here Yeah, I have no problems with the foods, food is great That's good to know So, yeah, that may be exceeded my expectations There we go, there's just a couple of things that we can think of, I don't know if anything else you want to How about family values? What do you expect something like the same as like you mentioned in China? Well, I would maybe say what kind of food? South Africa and Philippines, what's the... Yeah, I mean Expectation was that, yeah, family members are very close Just from our conversations online while they came here, the way they took about family and living so close together I knew, yeah, maybe it's kind of an Asian thing So I did kind of know, yeah, family bonds are very close I know it's a very religious country Do you like it? You don't like what? You mean, wanting to go to your family? Yeah, there's some foreigners they don't like it They don't like to bring their partner away from the family because... I know, you know guys I'm trying, but I'm suggesting Yeah, I'm sure he's right there Yeah, I mean, honestly, it has to be honest Sometimes we get to learn much, you know, always I think so many people around You know, I mean, that's just also my personality I'm introverted, personally My own side Sometimes, yeah, me, it can get a little much But I mean, it's great, yeah, to see the family around getting along And set mom, doesn't get along with anyone But I mean, I have no complaints about that That's good, do you know? Yeah, I was gonna say, yeah, Philippines I realized, yeah, just from chatting with her And some of the Filipinos I've met in China It's a very religious country And I've actually expected maybe Filipinos to be a little more conservative than they actually are So they're not really that conservative I mean, like seeing lady boys around They're much more common Oh, that was above my expectation I didn't expect to see so many lady boys in Philippines Yeah, but really respect them, you know Not like other countries that they are not accepted Yeah, I mean, that's something I was surprised with Is how much they are accepted here Regardless of being such a religious country And some religions maybe Being a bit prejudiced towards those genders Yeah, they're loving people They're very friendly, they're very funny They're very funny people I have lots of friends life Yeah, through her I met a few of them You know, very, very kind people Yeah And make a conversation fun Yeah, yeah Also fun loving people When you're surrounded, you are stressed for That's right So yeah, all in all, I think I'm very happy living in the Philippines While we're working on our goals and stuff, you know And we're still working on getting our own place And so there's a lot of things happening Blogging being a new thing for us So we're trying that as well But I mean, yeah All in all, I think But it means definitely met my expectations Maybe exceeded my expectations I mean Let's get to know So?
