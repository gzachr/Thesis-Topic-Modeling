The wild back invited me to come along exploring some of the most beautiful islands this country has to offer. Okay. As I had never been and always wanted to go, I packed my bags and met him in Manila. Before the trip, I decided that I wanted to vlog this adventure, put in the end as a gift. I was going to be able to go back to the Philippines. Before the trip, I decided that I wanted to vlog this adventure, put in the end as it didn't really happen. We were still able to capture a lot of moments along the way, and it's definitely a story I want to share with the guys. This is our Philippines adventure. I want to go in that water. So clear and believe. And it's getting cold here already. I want water. What is? That's deep. Well, we haven't done any vlog sequences. Okay, so welcome to the Philippines. Oh, no. Whoa. That water is crystal clear. It's just a crazy just rocks just coming out of the water. The music got so loud I can't hear a thing you said. Yeah. I literally love it. Yeah. See, it's like, hey, can we jump off of that? Yeah, probably. So. Can we buy a helicopter? Whoa. That is crazy looking. Yeah. Oh, the waterfall goes up. Whoa, it reverbs. Check the nails. Oh, we need to see one of those. Does this see its eyes glowing in the forest? Oh, that trailer. That'll be sick. Whoa. What the? I got my nice boots. Nice pink boots. Because there are a lot of snakes down there. Maybe snakes. Oh. I'd be like, yo, do you want to see things? Oh, there's a place. What now? Yeah. Can we need some snake boots to go hiking? Yeah. So, me and Kyle are trying to fight the drone right now. And hope. Yeah, it's super around here somewhere. Hopefully we can find it. That'll be a cool place to just go on a hiking adventure. Yeah. So tropical. Yeah. How? How in the world? I don't know before they filmed that clip. I believe that they crashed it and lost it, but. They're just walking around and they're like, oh wait, here it is. Yeah. It's just a dizzy, huge bush. Kill broken. That's so broken. Oh, it's an SD. It's all that matters. No, they found the climbs in the house. This makes me want to go mountain climbing. Thanks. Thanks. A big thank you to Kyle, Julianne Lee, for making the strip a memorable one. Because in the end it's not about the places you visit. It's about the people you want. I feel like the people would be so cool there. Yeah. Wow. Go where you feel most alive. I'm dead inside. You are dead. I mean, nowhere. You should just go drive you off in the middle of the forest somewhere. Yeah. I'm going to go to the woods a little bit. Blindfold you, walk you out for like an hour and a half. Leave you in the woods. Tie you to a tree. The brook will come undone after two hours. And then you'll be on your own. Are you prepared? I'll turn into like some feral cannibal up there. Like I'll find some like population of ten city. And I'll go in there and just rate it and just eat all of them. And then you'll like come find me later. And then I like this massive beer game. I like to hunt you. I like to hunt you down. You know, but it's the concept of a new movie. Oh, that's a movie we could make coming to Netflix soon. Definitely. Anyways, that was a cool video. I mean, it just showcases like some more places and the Philippines that we need to go. Makes me want to go hiking really bad. Yeah, it looked like they did some hiking and they got some crazy spots. I want to climb some of those mountains. They look very rocky, which is always good for climbing. Yeah. I think it's really good for climbing sometimes. It would be interesting. Do we need snake boots? Yeah. I don't want to get bit by a snake. We just need to wear like a full bodysuit. Yeah. Just wear like Kevlar and like a chain metal all over us. I think we'd be fine from snakes then. Yeah. And then when they come and they try to bite it, it was just tsh tsh tsh. You know? Thanks for watching everybody. That was a cool video. I have a travel for like two months. I think it's only been two months. Hopefully you enjoyed. Subscribe if you did. Like the video if you did. Check out the travel logs. You can see some of our travels and see you in the next one. Bye.
