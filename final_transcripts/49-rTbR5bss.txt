 Hi everyone, it's Ryuk from Japan and today I got a request from my Filipino viewer to share my thoughts about this hashtag Cancel Korea trending now in the Philippines. So I'm going to explain to you about what this hashtag is about. Cancel Korea hashtag started because a famous TikToker fell up porch Contravery her tattoo over the rising sun with a wartime army flag of Japan on her social media and some Korean netizens are really angry against her and sending her messages like Philippines are short, poor and uneducated and Bella apologizes to them but however, many Filipino citizens are really angry against nasty comments and expressing their anger towards Korean with this hashtag Cancel Korea Japan is really related to this Cancel Korea hashtag because Bella had a rising sun flag tattoo and this how it all started it made many Korean people angry and as Japanese I'm really sad that this is happening right now in 2020 and I'm really angry towards this nasty racist comments sent towards Filipino people because Japanese I get a lot of those comments on my YouTube channel as well like saying like I hate Japan, Japan, blah blah like it really like hurts my feeling and like I don't really say this often but it really hurts my feeling toward if like my country gets like discriminated or like people say bad things about my country that's a feeling that everybody has you know if somebody talks bad thing about your country it hurts your feeling so don't do something that you don't want other people do to you do something that you want other people do to you and don't do something that you don't want people to do to you like stop writing bad comments about people and like country and being racist and that's wrong you know in 2020 so if you are watching this please stop and please try to make a peaceful world we learn history not to hate each other from what happened in the past but we learn history to make a better future and better world and I am really looking forward for a world that everybody in the world can spend peaceful days regarding what happened in the past and I strongly believe what should not be repeated again and all the nuclear weapons in the world will be gone and cancel Korea hashtag I understand that many Filipinos people want to use this hashtag to show hatred towards Korea and I feel it is better to use hashtag cancel racism or cancel discrimination and make a better world towards everybody it is difficult to make a change alone however if all of us in the world unite and try to make a better future it will happen in the future I feel and I really hope that all Filipino people and Korean people and Japanese people unite together and make a better world and everybody in the world stop hating each other in this 2020 and that is what I feel and what I wish from this small room in Japan and for if you are watching this right now I really hope that you understand my message and spread peace from one person to one person it can start from somebody next to you spread peace and make a better world and stop racism this is just my opinion but I hope this message you and that is why I feel about this cancel Korea hashtag trending now in the Philippines thank you very much for watching today
