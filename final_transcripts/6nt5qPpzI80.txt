 What's up guys right today? I'm going to react to a video called 1956 high school students in US weight debate on prejudice yeah 1956 it's quite old isn't it is about 60 years ago. Yeah, right? And the subject is pretty nice. Yeah, it's very serious content this time is it? I'm being serious sometimes. Yeah, no kidding this time. Sorry Well, it looks interesting because you know, they're four students all different nationalities Debating on prejudice. Yeah, I guess people at that time had a big prejudice Especially between those countries because you know, it was right after the second world war So people colonized countries Discrimination people got slaves Which I think those created many prejudices Well, even people these days have prejudices though, but you know, how different from that in 62 years ago I'm just curious. Well, let's see what it's like Welcome to our forum discussion on the roots of prejudice We'll be talking about Prejudice are where they came from how they're nourished and perhaps Even how to get rid of them. Let me introduce you to the four student participants in today's discussion Ratnavi is Kandari Nata high school students 17 years old and also I Mean is old she's very young isn't she? From Japan, Yoriko Kunishi Yoriko Kunishi She's What we do in all those times when we aren't having serious discussions? We very often get Yoriko to dance or sing for us. She does both From the United Kingdom 18-year-old Judith reader Judith's got a bit of a cold today yet did not come from swimming in the Atlantic Ocean although she assures this that when she's in England She does swim in the ocean during the winter. This is pretty easy Roll contrast. Roll will be 16 years old periodically enough on the 4th of July He may admit some prejudices, but why he obviously doesn't have is a prejudice against women or he wouldn't have been willing to appear tonight with Three women being the only male on the program Now on this question By trying to define what you think prejudices are what do you think prejudices is Ratnavi? I think the cutest as feeling of hate of people as a blue or under-fiddle To it are the people you see a feeling of hate. Do you think prejudices are small? Hate. Yeah, it's part of Yes, yes, prejudices and answer will be I Hit such and such Well, I suppose that is true. What do you think prejudices are you come? I found that that if somebody's distinguished between two white men It is not prejudices that if somebody's distinguished between a white man and a colored man It is right I was just kind of this way A rigid opinion formed about a certain thing before there has been a just examination of the facts When a person loses track of the dignity of the human soul and Against the judge's authors not on the basis of there being persons but on the basis of race Creed economic status that is prejudice. He's more reasonable Yeah, he looks very intelligent buzz. How would he looks like? Japanese comedians I am well prejudice against Japanese Well, not to be extended that I hate them. No, not that way But I got this well as a result of World War II Yeah, Japanese I'm looking by the Philippines I was getting to understand what happened during those times But I think that what my relatives and friends and the people who were witnessed to that unfaithful occasion Well, they just more than justified the fact and I think It's justified for me to feel the same way because I know that my people suffered very much under that rule You still is prejudiced against the Japanese as you work? Well five years ago that the prejudice of mine was well slightly fading away. Oh, that sounds great Stobberly refused to pay reparations to us Really the prejudice began to brew again, but now I found out from close contact with Yoriko and other Japanese that Japan isn't ready to pay reparations yet because as Yoriko said Yoriko that was confused Suffered the cold in the classrooms because they can't afford to heat the schools Yoriko you've got any prejudices? Well, I don't have many prejudice for the Philippines Yeah, we try not to fight other people because The president of Korea made the line his own line on the public see between Korea and Japan and If the Japanese fishermen go over the line they were they are Code by Korean people and they can't go go home for a while and We are trying to be friends For Korea Now that we started going around truth You got any prejudices? Well, sir. Go this speaking. We colonized Korea in the past I guess it's about a hundred years ago And we agree on an economic co-operational and we solve this issue But still Koreans are accusing us of that past so we still argue with Korean about this matter Which is I think it's nonsense We better go around circles. You got any prejudices? Yes, I bet admit admit them although I'm English I have a very foolish prejudices you're probably laugh for instance As soon as I meet a person with red hair I always put myself on my guard because I have a silly prejudice that all red-headed people have terrible tempers You know that there is passionate about their hair I see this is a big president I'm not a silly prejudiced For example when I first met the Australian delegates and as of a woodgate who hasn't been on television I was shot by her accent Because to me it sounds just like a cockney accent but in England I agree Yeah, she meant by their English is really A cockney accent in England, you know, well, this is a I don't know if she's so She told me that she's shuddered when she heard my accent I got paid back for that too. Why did she say she did? Oh, I think she imagined that she said she really had to forget my accent in order to like me because it's It's too formal. I gather most Americans think about that about English as well Right now they're turned Sometimes I find the duties The Dutch people when in school when I learned And I'm some other prejudices of my own that's I hit people who are proud and Who feel that here's the master of the other people and who thinks that he knows everything That anybody else Let's come back few minutes, Ralph. Are there any prejudices in the Philippines between groups of Yeah, interesting They're existing prejudices between groups of people. So matter of fact Most of us still well are prejudiced against a group of hybrid Hybrid, which are more Spanish blood than Filipino blood in them and the we term termed them as a Miss Tisos, well, the These incidents will usually occur in the schools as you know, I'm in a school run by a Spanish monks and Well, we have a lot of We have a lot of those of that group studying in our school and Usually they are they are favored, but we think and Well, we think that we're right in saying that they are sort of aristocratic Conceited and high-headed and soreheaded and all sorts of adjectives and they have the the foolish idea that they have The royal blood or royal really Well, how do you get on with the choice? Yeah, I happen all like that in this age speaking I don't get along with them pretty well. So matter of fact. Well, we use well in fight with it with one another It's very problem. Yes, Eureka Japan have had many American or European soldiers after the war and Most of them married with the Japanese girls Not only formal wedding and they made children who called the hybrid the high-brids, yeah, and I Think the high bridge Have nothing to be punished But some grownups didn't treat didn't use to treat As the In the past and the grownups also used to Treat the mothers of children Judges people thought that the mothers of high-bridge are not good Because he mixed with Foreign people for invoice and many darkness people don't like To marry with foreign people because they have them They live in different Customs and they consider with different way you still have a strong May I say pray to this in Japan against marrying people from other countries, don't you? Yes We are very private people Could you tell us something about the status of women in Japan? We had a strange things and you've been telling me the strange things could you? And tell us more about it before the war Yes, and now Up to about 60 years ago Japanese people thought that the white white people are horrible Because they are almost red hairs and Everything is so big Everything is so big People still think so And in Japan we think that something To be beautiful Must be small and delicate If you hardly apply the word delicate Big soldiers we said I never knew that you look down on us because we were big That's a very interesting We always proud of the if we Western men at all enhance them We can fit in that Yes, we are proud To be small and delicate What you said about skin color I've heard that the Chinese speak about us as pink people instead of white people Why do you talk to people Chinese to Japanese? Oh, yes, you have pink My girl face it too, if you are I feel scarred Well, in Japanese and Chinese are the same This is pretty nice There are so many colonies Well, let's say Nearly all of the world How do you feel to people in the You mean something to this? No, I personally don't have any prejudice I hope I don't I know that a lot of Europeans think of the Asians For example as Rather lazy I see They still have that image No, you don't Asian people We don't have good people I know that you dislike for example And Indonesia you dislike the Dutch there But they probably thought they were helping you They were not helping You mentioned that we are lazy We are not Exactly lazy But they didn't give us a chance And we didn't get Experiments to build our country Well, Judy, I don't think all Asians are lazy No, please, you understand me I said that was a general opinion Maybe not now, I hope so A general opinion Well, it's sort of wrong to say that they are lazy Let's just say that they have got the very flat feet That they can't lift them up Because we have to consider for example The climate in most of the regions in the Asia Yes you are You can't just work with all the hot, the warm climate around you Of course you always feel like finding yourself Or going to an air conditioned theater or something else that We are in its cold It's kind of right, a different kind of joke Is there a difference in philosophy too that perhaps we in the west have And appreciated our wonder Well, as far as I know it And well, I think you've mentioned it in this program That Indians think that they should never saw in their hands And in the Philippines I must admit that Well, we're sort of inclined to get white collar jobs and swivel chairs Most of us do especially the new college graduates We don't want to work with our hands We want to have well big bosses and with pretty secretaries around us That's the common tendency Kind of excuse You're not broke that we are lazy Oh gosh, now you've put me in a corner I was trying to give you an example You criticize the countries which you criticize that for example But I know the British when they started doing their colonization They tried to help the countries they were in But you think that we were betting on taking away your opportunities Well, yes, I think so I said I would give from a sample about the deaths that We didn't get a chance to be educated for a sample That was when the Dutch was in Do you think if the people in the colony get a chance to get free You will get them? Oh, now we're going right off the surface My friend from Malaya is very glad that Malaya She has very proud and she felt that She felt that Malaya is going to be in the final of the next year Do you think that if you do that to the other places Can you... Yes, we will make them satisfied We hope you will make them satisfied Every country wants to be independent That's only natural But there comes a point somebody to decide whether they are ready to receive their independence You go off on another long arm to wonder that Maybe we can have what I'm sorry, Ralph I was about to ask them what do they think are the most common Or the basic causes of our prejudice is it the mainly skin color Maybe Do you mean the... Do you mean for example taking the American... Rublin the South I guess taking the American side of it It's just that the white people don't want to mix themselves up With the colored ones But what about the colored people? Perhaps they don't want to mix with the white people either What about since you brought up the American raised problem I'd like to ask you... Is it so bad in the world before you came? Or is it better or worse? Well I think it's what I've seen here And what I've heard while I am here And what I have read in the newspapers it's just worse than I expect them Don't you agree, Joe? No, I didn't agree In England we don't hear too much about the American problem Except of course when a certain case came up And a Supreme Court decision we heard a lot about it then But not too much and when I came here I had imagined from that the tiller case that things would be really terrible in the South And I found that there's a real fear of autism here I stayed in a needle at the time And I was able to see the position really a bird's eye view Oh, a new curl The first thing that impressed me was that... 70s word came up Well, we're not happy about the situation but we're pleased They were grateful for what progress had been made And they were sure that the situation would continue to improve They said that two weeks ago in New Jersey The New South was in the New South in Niagara family I know that was in the northern part and conditions were better there And I was very impressed with that Oh, she's special They should be a slow process but things were gradually improving That experience should be very surprising at that time I guess I'd like to know some of your other experiences with yes, Yorika I have never seen any evidences Evidences of a rigid practice And they united state that I found out that most New-Gros They have high positions in business But I was very glad when I saw the Negro girl in South Lurinch And Columbia High School Who was vice president of the student council I'm glad you did too Yes, right now Here in New York, in New Jersey, I don't see any facial signs of the curve I see facial segregation or something like that But when they stopped and were on the spurg and they stopped in the Negro school I saw it's very strictly I mean the Negro school go to the special Negro And I was talking to some of the girls in the school And I asked them how they feel about being segregated But they said that they don't mind about that And working one is equal rights And there are some places that they can go such as a restaurant or some clubs And I think that they are not claimed And emphasize that America is the most democratic country in the world And as far as long as segregation exists, I don't think it's a democracy I agree Well adding something to that It's impressive to say that in this age That's just an agent who did the black You mentioned something about I fled to the flag of the United States of America And the Republic for it extends one nation in the visible under God With liberty and justice for all Well the last race just doesn't sort everything With this segregation problem here And the discrimination against colored people I mean the world could you have liberty and justice for all And in one of my hospitality periods I didn't expect that even the kids could carry a dad far Had the well, uh, privilege I should say of attending one of the dances Sponsored by one of the civic groups And I just noticed that Well it was a big dance floor And all the white kids were assembled on the left side And I felt like I should say Not strategic part of the ballroom But all the colored boys and girls were in there And I never saw a white boy asking a white A colored girl for a dance Nor did I see a colored boy asking white girl for a dance I had a nasty excuse He is intelligent but looks like When I first arrived and I thought I happened to mention to a group of young people that I was going to stay with the Negro family One of the boys got up and walked out of the room And I felt awful I thought I was going to stay in the north now, not in the south And then when we did go into the south I really came against it pretty hard We went into this big store And I was in the ladies' cloakroom And I was washing my hands and I was with a group of the Eastern delegates The rather darker skinned ones like Ratnati And I was standing a little apart from them And this lady came up to me And she pulled me to one side Obviously assuming that I was American And she said, uh, she said, what are these Negroes doing in here And I was so cross And I very, I told her as calm as I could That I was with them and who we were And of course her attitude immediately changed But it gives you such a nasty shot When you come up against it face to face You read about it in the newspapers You hear about it but you don't really Realize the significance of it until it hits you in the face yourself I think the major cause of the prejudice is skin colors And I think I don't know why but I think the white people think that the color people have have dirty skin And they don't have progressive culture So the white people The most great, great, great And the wonderful person in the work Thanks a lot On this matter of skin color We're here in the summer, you'd see lots of Americans on all the beaches Trying to get brown Significent. I wonder what that really means I think we white women have an inferiority complex The East and women And the Negro women have a sort of reputation For being so beautiful A little jealous of them I guess you just envy us colored people I think so Is there anything corresponding to that? Well I think so, Mrs. Waller Because in the Philippines it's just funny There's a common tendency among women Well those who have a A dark complexion I should say Or just a tan one Or just a brown complexion Well especially these high society mattress Well even if they've got already wrinkles on their face They still want to bleach their skin Suppose you meet one right now And you say, oh good morning And you see that she's just tan than brown But after three months You meet the same person And with the hot, with the useful society walk And trying to be very dignified And cultured and everything And you just notice that her face Was a slider than before And when you look at her hands And everything up to her arms Well you'll be likeable to say To explain holy Moses Because there's a real Very great difference you see She's about very light here But you look at the arms and everything And the lower part of the body But jeez it's just the Very great difference It's collared here But it's very light They really bleach their skin They don't miss a swallow What about Japanese women don't want to change it anyway Some Japanese women Die, die, die They're here Red Really? At the time? They like red hair But I don't like it What about Indonesia? Some people try to get a Dark skin We try to get light skin But we prevent The sun You're such a nice color now I think When we go out then we use a Long-sleeved blouse To prevent from the sun So we don't get a fanny dark color Tell me what are your governments If anything doing About problems of prejudice Which mentioned some prejudice That exists in your country What are your governments doing To try to eradicate it? You mentioned the prejudice against Hybrid, you mentioned the prejudice against Hybrid's too You haven't told us much about the position of women Otherwise, by the way, let me ask you right here Are women any freer in Japan now than they were before the war? Yeah, must be Before the war There was no democratic And women belonging to men And women and everything And How about that? There was a first opportunity to Everything Even getting out of the door Women had to open the door first And men passed first And in the buses or The theatre So, 19 And take seats first And if there is no seat Women had to stand in Yes, it's true But they are in America Yes, quite changed And now women can vote And women have equal opportunity in everything Judith, you were talking about your prejudice against Cockney exit and over to go Is that still very strong in England This prejudice of the so-called aristocracy against the Cockney? No, I didn't think it's a very serious problem now Especially since the war The English speak either with a Cockney accent Or else with a very aristocratic accent That isn't true anymore And we certainly don't despise people anymore if they speak with that If you go into the House of Parliament now You will often hear a North Country accent Or a Welsh accent Or even a Cockney accent And we're proud of those kind of people because they are the people who Got us through the last war and nobody would dare say anything against them In fact, it's the aristocratic accent Which is the other side of the fence And people laugh at that now And they think I'm afraid In fact, you may think that my accent is a little cultured But I assure you, back in England I have not quite a Cockney accent Still an accent At least you mean to say you're a school mistress Would not totally approve of your own Oh no, I should be corrected I hate to think what's going to happen when you go back after three months here Siddua, you write me about that I wanted to have time to ask you what you thought individuals could do In terms of eradicating prejudice But our time's almost up Anybody got a quick answer? Well, I guess we should carefully examine the individual first before passing any judgment on him And if we ever pass a judgment, we should be just with it That's a good note to end on Good comments, Japanese comedian Here we go Well, this debate was held on 1956 So it was 10 years before I'm not into the king who made that famous speech So it's really impressive that At that early time People like children, these and boys and girls were facing thinking about prejudice seriously Yeah, it was quite an old topic But this kind of issue is still discussed even in this age Or should I say it's getting more focused, right? You know, as a nationalism comes into the forefront People discuss about the prejudice In my opinion, as long as there is a difference between people, we can't eliminate the prejudices Because I think the main cause of the prejudice is the comparison While people say try to think that we're equal, but we're not actually You see, the gap between rich and poor is getting bigger and bigger these days And then people point out that difference, which leads to the prejudices So I think the solution in the first place is eliminating or minimising the gap between them But that can't be promising So yeah, prejudices are kind of a dangerous question What do you think about these guys? Or what do you think about me being serious? If you like a press the like button, if not, don't press the dislike button And if you like a press stop, you know, video, and then move to another video So, thank you for watching my video, bye for now You
