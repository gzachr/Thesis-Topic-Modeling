 So this Filipino said he only sang seriously once and this is the time where he sang seriously once I'm excited to see it genuinely he's gonna do a no easy way cover. I'm pretty sure this is the Newman Yes, it is in the Newman session. I can see some of the drinks in the back room. I'll see it Not excited genuinely. Hopefully you guys are excited too This man come on. How can you not get excited for somebody about to prove and show their talent? How can you not get excited? Let's go ahead and see him do this. No easy way cover See even the music is like oh my god Is anybody do it Yo yo yo God that's scary Oh Oh my okay Is it way to break so bad is hard All right I had to do it because I had said anything to tell me get through it I Oh And I had to turn away It's Wow dude She could have got it every and made me feel like a girlfriend child But I realized that there was a star Can you make sure that you don't mind? I wanted her to turn me and not to trim me like a friend I wanted her to say there'll be something I could call me but I still can't believe it Yeah, that is laughing But she acted like a lady to me Yeah Rose so weird I thought that she'd ring down But she smiled at me and never made a sound And I guess she understood in her way Cause her silence don't be here and nothing she could not say Rose Rose Rose Rose Rose Rose Rose Rose Rose Rose Rose Rose Rose Rose Rose I love the way his voice sounds like very raspy to it too Really The funny part about that is he said this was a serious time I'm not too sure about that being completely serious Which is also a pro to it There's a pro too and there's a con I thought this was a serious if it is actually not being serious But then the pro would be man if that's joking I'm serious but I'm sure he was actually being serious That's just his way he just laughs kind of maybe when he's nervous Maybe that's his way That happens Everybody got that My friend got that He laughs when he's nervous Nothing's funny I'm confused But that's just how he is But with that I am actually just in awe of his voice Has this very unique like factor to it It's like this raspyness this very old school vibe This old school soul At the same time with this like newer type of style With singing with the range I love it It was genuinely enjoyable and honestly I want to say thank you guys So so so much for watching I really do appreciate it If you liked it leave a like If you loved it subscribe if you want more Let me know down in the comments below And yeah Till next time guys Peace Music
