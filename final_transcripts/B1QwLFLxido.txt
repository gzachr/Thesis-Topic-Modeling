And I'm Nelly. We are to travel lifestyle and food bloggers based in Maccati city and we wanna check out our main channel making that blog, it's linked right here. But today we're gonna react to ah, Koreans trying to cook le chon kawali. Yes, they're gonna cook and eat le chon kawali. And I know, I know. I know what an adventure it is to prepare le chon kawali. I attempted to make le chon kawali in Miami. Yes. If you'd like to see us reacting to that video, please let us know in the comments down below. Otherwise, check out that video. Yeah, it was quite adventurous, so I must say, because we did not expect it to be that dangerous. Foreigners, it's not expected. Okay, so I think this is going to be a funny one. Um, because... Who is that? Okay, okay, we'll find out about them later on. Let's jump into this video. Yes! Hey guys! Hey guys! The memory here. Hello! Hey today! Hey! We are gonna eat le chon kawali. Wow! What? What is le chon kawali? Le chon kawali. Philippine-sik. Ssam-kyup-sa-l suyuk-chigi. Oh, I thought it was a pork belly. Yes. Suyuk is good at this. Suyuk-chigi. Tigi-sa-ddo. Ah, that's right. I'm gonna go out. Okay, let's go right away. Or maybe just a group of people. Yeah. One guy with a suit. Oh, yeah. Yeah, what's up with the suit? So, preparing le chon kawali is really not that easy. But once you get it right, it is so delicious. Wow! It's so big! Yeah! Both end the salt. That's gonna hit the elbow. Oh! Nice. Yeah, looks hot. Suyuk, how good it is. Okay, I'll go for it. Nice, Beerol. Ha ha ha. Really nice. It's fun to watch. It's like hunting us through, really. Got a little dry in the fridge overnight. Yeah. I thought I'd come down, John. Oh my god. Oh, come on, you feel it? What? Na-da- Get it more, then, you'll go. Na-da- thing will happen. I'm gonna put it in the oil. Oh, yeah, yeah. I think it's a little, be a wild. It's still boiling. Gotta get it nice and thin. But we should make le chon kawali again. You know? We don't have to be a missus. Yeah, I'm gonna do the job. That's some make. Yeah. We did it the proper way we had some make with le chon kawali. Really, crunch. Cut, cut. Sorry, I forgot where to press it. It's K, right? It's spacebar. Spacebar. Spacebar is broken. That's why I'm asking. Okay, na-na, wait, wait. You're my, yeah, my, max computer's broken. Yeah, everything. We need to get to those 100K guys. So we can buy a new computer too. That is not falling apart. And some nice lighting, really. So, if you enjoyed the video, subscribe and like. And give us a video. A big fat thumbs up. What I wanted to say is, I remember when we put in the, in the pork and we had the first splash. It went more like, like this. No! And then our friend Kevin had a little, as he called it, chicharon in his eye. His eye lit turned into a chicharon because the hot oil hit his eye. Yeah. That was funny. That was a fun day. Yeah, that was great. Oh, sorry. Sorry. Technical difficulties. Stay with us. Here we go. Oh my god, it's, it's splash is so much. Hi. Saminino. Oh no, this is not safe. Put on some glasses. Put that thing here. Oh my god. It looks very good already. Oh no, they make a difference. Yes. A lot of our viewers told us you're, you're supposed to splash some water into the hot oil. To get it extra crispy. Splashing water into hot oil does not sound right. It does not sound safe, but if it's not too much water, the outside lid is crispy. Let me eat. Yeah, we have some nice ASMR here. I say this after... Wow. I can easily eat this. You said that, but you have never tried this before. I think it's really good. It's really good. It's really good. Let's see. No, no, no. Ooh, they have fried garlic in this one. Ooh, that's great. Now I'm getting hungry. Oh, is that pork? Yes. Oh, this is so good. Oh, it's so good. Oh, it's so good. Yeah, no. It's speechless when you have le trancowale. So we had our very first le trancowale in Corona. Yes. I thought that as... It was our first trip to the Philippines. First day in the Philippines. First time eating Filipino food in the Philippines. And we thought le trancowale is le trancowale. We ordered le trancowale and we thought that's the le tranc. And we tried it and it was so good. It was so good. Actually the video will put it right here. And yeah, it was... And then we got... Third is two beans. Two beans. First of all, we thought le trancowale is the le tranc. Second of all, we called le tranc les chants. Yes. Which was hilarious. Third thing is we did not know how big the portions are. So, you know, us coming from Miami where they have tiny little portions. And we want portions cost a tiny portion cost $20. Yeah, we came to the Philippines and we're like, Yeah, let's order a few things so we can try a few dishes. And also we're like, oh, this is 150 pesos. That's like $2. That can't be enough for like two people. So it's order like six dishes. And then they came and they extended our tables. So we had two tables to put the food on the table. Which was quite interesting. It was really, really nice experience. I think it was fun. It was better than Korean style. We were in Korea. It felt like we were in the same place. This is a bit... It's a bit like the snack. The cup jelly. They're very loud eaters. Oh, I thought the camera's falling off. Ah, it's really good. Oh, now I want it. I'm not going to eat like this. Wow, I put this big one on the bottom. Nice. My stomach is a bit cold. It's spicy. Very nice. Can I thin like it? Happy La La, I don't think I'm going to say that. I would not recommend cooking in a set. The music. That music sounds familiar. But the taste is good in the foreign language. It's good. The jungle is beautiful. The jungle is not a village. The jungle. It's got a funny. Yeah. It's so delicious. So when we cooked it for the very first time, we cooked it outside, luckily. Because when we put in the first piece of pork, the pot was overflowing. No. No, no. It just was like popping, popping, popping and it would go everywhere. Yeah, so it was such a mess. It was such a mess. Our friend William put paper towels underneath his feet and started walking around the corner. We did it on our deck. And I'm so glad that we didn't do it indoors because the kitchen would have looked like a mess. Let us know if we should react to that video. I think that would be hilarious to react to our own video. I think we should do it. So comment, do it. Do it. I hope we're not influencing you too much. It's a fun video though. It really is good. I think we ate it up a few times. It's delicious. It's delicious. But. It's so good. So it's so good. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. It's so good. It seems I first tried it on a butterfly. I can find it fast! It has deceived my rival. I ? It was the mom's iPhone.

It's not that good. It's salty. I'm going to get a tail. It's good. It's nice. I think it's good. It's about 2kg. It's 3kg. It's 3 people. 3 guys. No side dishes. Where's the rice?

It's hot and it's like a fish cake. It's like an omelette. Really, it's like a fish cake. It's like a fish cake. It was made by making a hot fish cake in a hot weather. But it has a smell. It's a congee. It's a funny story. The hot weather in the Philippines versus when we went to Korea. I felt so cold. We were freezing cold. It was 4 of us. We've been living in the Philippines for two long. We can't take the cold no more. And no cold no more. I was wearing a hoodie yesterday because it was under 30 degrees. I was wearing a hoodie. So a pack your jacket if you go to Korea. Many pack your jackets? Yes. Oh. It's different. This is a chicken, so it's 10 years old. I'm 20 years old. I'm wearing a beer and a cup of cold beer.
