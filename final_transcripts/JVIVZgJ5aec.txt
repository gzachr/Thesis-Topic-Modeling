 Yeah, you guys go home and come to the sauce. Yeah, nowhere near $100. Yeah, I mean, they're gonna show you you can actually enjoy yourself. I don't like what you don't like the food. And he's strong, man, because I can't be eaten from everybody. He's a nice thing. I can't eat from everybody. We eat there. He really got a tough job. I mean, a tough one. You got a tough job, son. What's good, y'all? It's a devil shits. React and we're back with another video. Who we got today, see? Today, we're back with another American reaction. Super excited about this video, guys. If you need to listen to me. And we know to you. Make sure you scroll down. You hit the subscribe button. And we'll see you guys next time. See you next time. See you next time. See you next time. See you next time. See you next time. See you next time. See you next time. He desks the subscribe button. In turn on the post notification bell. Because we're on the road to 100K. And we cannot get there without you guys. All right? Join the family without further ado. Let's get into the video. Let's get it. Good day. And welcome to the Philippines and back to the second channel. Twice the fun at the effort. Actually, today it might even be one third of the effort. That is the least amount of effort so far. But it's going to be 10 times the cash. Because today I'm going to attempt to spend one hundred dollars on street food here in Manila. Right now, we are in the Kiyafo market. These alleyways, they are packed with people doing business, with rallies, with people eating street foods. I'm excited, feels good to be back in the Philippines. Let's get it. Oh, that's a good one. Cool look. Oh, I'm with Margie, and this is our first food. Margie, can I take a look? This is Misoa soup. A Chinese soup. A Chinese soup, you look inside. It looks like white, vermicelli noodle. This looks fantastic. I'm hoping that it's going to cost $9, $10, $11, because then I only need to eat 10 foods to get to 100. He starts by putting in a meatball that she puts in an egg, and then this time for this soup. This soup smells very savory and delicious, like some ramen noodle seasoning in there. She puts in the rice noodle, drapes that on top. So here, I'm going to put some fried garlic on here, and then chili oil. Oh, that's good. This looks deadly. And a little bit of pepper. How much is this? Ah, this is going to be really hard. So come take a look one more time. I'm mixing in some of that chili oil. You can see the fried garlic is becoming less crunchy, so I got to eat it soon. Wanna go for it? Mmm. Oh, it's very spicy. The noodles, they're so thin, it almost tastes like an egg drop soup. The reason it's so thick is because of some egg, some cassava flour. Next, I'm going to grab this meatball. That looks steamy and hot. I got to be very careful as I take this down. Mmm. Meenie and squishy. What kind of meatball is it? Pork. Pork and some other stuff. I like it. They're quite dense. Take a look at that. The inter-mantle. It's like when you're in eighth grade science class and you see the planets all cut in half. I'm going to try another one. It's very addictive. It's not just savory. It's sweet too. Over home. A very nice combination. Let's keep going. Hello, men. Could I please have the sotang-hoon soup? This is my first time trying some of these noodles and different types of dishes here. She starts with a glass noodle, a little bit of cabbage and a whole egg in there. And then, if that wasn't good enough, then she puts on the broth. And that broth is orange and beautiful. Thank you so much. We'll be back to pick in a couple of days. Hey, look. If you stand up straight, you can have a free haircut. Right here, we have a dish at the Novart Chinese Inspired that some of the things have tried so far in the Philippines. 99% of the things I eat in the Philippines are usually pork or a pork broth, but this is beef. There's a smattering of vegetables inside. And as a fresh egg, the glass noodles, even alone, looked incredible. I'm going to scoop out some of those noodles here. Well, it's very delicious. It's quite orange, but it doesn't taste orange. And then you ask yourself, well, what does orange really taste like anyways? I don't know. The glass noodles are so slippery, so easy to slurp it up. The cabbage, the vegetables, are refreshing the broth. Brother me! It's interesting. It's a free salty. I know my food, okay? Yeah, I see some cabbage. I know. Some cabbage would be good, right? Not too. Oh, some cabbage. Oh, we don't want you to carry with the cheese. It's definitely MSG-E, and I think that's what's making me feel so warm in my heart right now. This is a delectable, quick snack. Is it going to help me get to $100? No, I need to start looking for big ticket items. Rare gems, endangered species, whatever I can find. I got to keep going. We've come to a new neighborhood now. We are in Devisoria. And I've found a food I've never seen before in the Philippines or elsewhere. It's two different types of mashed potatoes. And the purple one I'm told the color is natural. One order of this. So it's some of the purple potato and some of the white potato. You're going to top that with margarine, actually. And then condensed milk. So a little bit of fat, a little bit of sugar on top of the potato. I'm trying to get the potato, the margarine, and the sugary condensed milk. Here we go. One big bite. 35 people watching me. Super normal. Oh, that's quite good. The potato. It's already sweet. It's like a sweet potato. The texture of the sweet potato. It's not like a typical mashed potato. It's got some chew to it. What is the purple thing? I'm very into this. I didn't know potatoes can be a dessert like this. This is incredible. It's very nice. This 20 pesos less than half a dollar. It's not helping me get to my goal. But it is delicious and a brand new discovery for me here in Manila. Let's keep moving. OK, so we have come to a different street. We stumbled upon this. I actually smell like a cooking purple potatoes. Why don't they grow it? And it comes out purple. Yeah, that's just like what are the potatoes? Red potatoes, but that's a scandal. Yeah. I'm sorry. But we have our sweet potatoes. OK, so what are you? OK. Yeah, we haven't heard of it. Purple. So I'm trying to understand the taste. So they had condensed milk, butter. Two types of potatoes. So it seems like it would be sweet, but I'm trying to understand it. I feel like it's not as sweet, though. I mean, if purple could have did it. But I don't think it would have been sweet. I think it's more like a balanced, simple, yes, sweet kind of flavor, but not as overpowering. Yeah. Yeah, let us know like what American food, y'all think that would relate that we could relate that to. Yeah. I'm not getting anything. Yeah, not as sweet potato, though. Not so sweet. Yeah. No, that's not true. Because before I saw it, it is quite a bunch of fishy, seafoody odor coming from here. This is dried squid. And then she has the world's smallest real here. So when you order it, she'll grill it or kind of roast it, put it in the cup, and you can add some vinegar. I'm going to order some right now. Can I have a ton? And the sun? Oh, that one has light. So she puts it over the hot charcoal. She heats it up. It's also going to soften it up a little bit, putting it over the hot charcoal here. It is almost ready. She puts it to the side for just a moment. She grabs a plastic cup. She inserts it into the plastic cup. And then right here, this is the main flavor. Oh, a load of onion and vinegar. The meal is finished. Come take a look. I'm going to try to get as many of those onions on there as possible. Now this bite has all those little legs. It's going to be awesome. Try it out. I'm going to lay. I haven't had a sweet before. I think so. This is exhausted by far my favorite part. So it's a little sour, super oniony, and actually quite spicy, too. So my mouth feels alive right now in this moment. It's bringing me back to life. I'm sweating. Those are pretty good. It's super, super strong seafoody taste. Try it out the bite. We have the head of the squid. So they're very good. It's like chewy and crunchy both. Overall, I like it. But we're saving it. It's definitely the power of this. Oh, y'all, it's that. Exotic food, squid. Mm-hmm. Duff, if it was an option, I would buy this from her. Because I would love to put this on just about everything. But if you're in this store, just look for nature's spring. That's the brand of this vinegar. Or maybe not. It's like a barbecue. Yeah. Wow. We've come to our next food right here at Corn. But it's not just any type of corn. It's cheese corn. My man here's going to whip one up, sir. One cheese corn, please. So here's how it works. Come close and take a look. First, he put some corn. And then he puts some processed chemical cheese powder. And then margarine. And that's how it is. It's like a fruit and yogurt parfait. It's another layer of corn, another layer of chemical cheese powder. Oh, and then corn juice on that. And that might even help that cheese powder to dissolve a little bit. Thank you. My cheesy corn is right here. It's in the cut and steam here. It looks like a hot couple of coffee on a winter. That look good. I definitely, I like some corn. The coffee good. Yeah, that look good. It reminds me of like street corn, almost. Almost. Just without nut on the cart. Yeah. Dave, so far, all of the cheese has kind of dissolved and emelted into one consistency. Almost like a cheese suit. I know some of you think of maybe being sarcastic or they call it chemical cheese. But here's the thing. Craft macaroni and cheese was like my favorite food growing up. And what is that? That's a cheese powder. So no, am I hating on chemical cheese powder? Absolutely not. That's pretty good. And I like the size. I like the size of a thimble. You're not going to get too full from it. It's surprisingly sweet. It's so much easy. Gosh, I want to drink it like an old Chinese man drinks tea. This would be awesome. And the cold winter is a vanilla. You know in Manila, when it gets down to freezing and there's snow in the air. You can hear Christmas carols. I mean the mushrooms out. The air flow. That would be really perfect. All right, cheese corn, big win, let's keep moving. Let's go. Oh, we've got our next food right here. So here he has a variety of fried treats. There's two in particular. One, this is East-Out, a chicken intestine that's been breaded and fried. And then this is calamari that's also been breaded and fried. I'm going to put this in a cup. And I'm going to find this one at a top of it. All right, that is one full. I'm calamari. My man, how much is this? 20 pesos. I don't know. He just looks at it. He eyes it up and he knows it's hard to how much it should cost. Here's the thing. Tell me in the comments if I'm right, Filipinos, especially in Manila. When you find these fried food places on the street, is it really about the fried food? Or is it about finding the best sauce possible? Because to me, I want to sauce with it. Onion, chilies, that's like really fresh looking. It doesn't look like 20 other people dipped into it. You're going to pour it in. And really that was the whole thing with vinegar, chilies, and onions in there. Oh, some cucumber too. Lucky. Try it out. I got some here. I'm going to go on there, dripping with delicious vinegar. Oh. Remember, breaded, a little squid-y flavor. The sauce is just kind of okay. That was a fresh one. So it was nice and crispy. Overall, I'm a fan of the calamari. But the sauce here, not my favorite. Let's try this. That looks like it's also going to be calamari. But nope, that is in testons of the chickens. The chickens in testin' in case on city. That's the first food I ever did for this channel. And now, something like six, seven years later, I'm back, I'm trying it again, let's go for it. That better. No gaming, no questionable. There's nothing wrong with chicken and testons in general. It prepared properly and cleaned properly. This chicken and testons, they're so awful. I'm not sure what's up with it. I'm not going to take another bite. That's going to be an end for me on this cart. I want you to know I wasn't just talking crap about the sauces. I love this kind of vinegar so much with all the onions in there. Mem, hello. How are you? Can I buy this? Yes. How much? 200. 200. So I can buy this for 200. I am literally flying to Vietnam tomorrow. And I'm going to take this for the Viennese case. And it's going to be awesome. I'm going to land and just find vinegar inside all my clothes. Yep. Side. We have come to our next location. He is frying some internal organs of the cow, including from the mammary glands of the cow. He's cut these down. He's giving me a toothpick. And he's going to spray it with some sauce. Oh, that is full of chilies and vinegar. Sir, what is your name? Mark. Mark. Yes. Is this your recipe? Yes. And how long have you been here? Oh, thank you. So I think a lot of these guys are basically making their own recipes. Especially, you know what I'm saying? And not wrong with that. Because of course, you know, we like to make our own scratch. So we cook it up. It tastes good. It tastes good, you know what I mean? So it seems like when we make a Filipino dish on a family channel, like with them, we're going to have to make a vinegar sauce on the side. So it's authentic. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. You got to have that dripping. You got to have that sauce. Oil fan base. People who keep coming back to try this over and over again. We've just been here for a short time. And he can hardly keep up with everybody ordering. Mark. Salam. Thank you. The march is made is great escape. It turns out his restaurant is also a bicycle. So right, that's what I ordered this. He just bites him. He's like, oh, no. So now I don't have to taste it in front of him and worry about his judgment. I'm going to give it a spell. The vinegar is doing his best, but it is hard to cover up how pungent and gamy this meat is. Let's go for it. Mm. Wow. That is a taste. It might take some time to get used to. The meat tastes a little bit rancid, like a little bit intense. Sometimes people like a very pungent and gamy beef. For me, one bite was plenty. Mm. Man, I don't like it when you don't like it. Food, bro. We come to our next food right here. This doll has a little bit of everything. They have some greg quek, which is a quail egg wrapped in dough and fried. It's got fish balls. And then they have this. This is called kikim. That is a mixture of pork, seafood, and really a bunch of fillers, and then made into this unique shape. After they fry it, you have two different options. You've got a sweet sticky sauce and then a sweet sticky sauce. That's also spicy. I'm going to put this one in here. New York is welcome to dose it as much as you want to. That is our finished product. How much is it? 20 pesos. Oh my gosh. I'm never going to get $200 in my eye. I'm going to take this outside and try it out in the sunlight. They gave you about 10 in here, not bad. You can see it is slathered with that sauce. And you know it's a good one, because there are chili chunks in there. It smells satisfying. It is savory, fishy. It's kind of like Odin that I've tried in Korea. I like it. Very fish-ball-leap in texture. Like a delicious wet styrofoam with all the sweet sticky sauce on it. That is also spicy. Aside from the sauce, there's not an incredible amount of flavor. Overall, I'm satisfying. I do like the very sticky sauce. Without the sauce, this would be nothing. Mmm. Oh, that is the end of the video. I tried my best. I had quite a lot of poached. In the end, maybe I spent. Oh, yeah. You guys go home with the sauce. That was the sauce. Yeah. I'm $200. No. I mean, it goes to show you can actually enjoy yourself. I don't like what you don't like the food. And he's strong, man, because I can't be eaten from everybody. He's a lot of things. I can't eat from everybody. We either. He really got a tough job. I mean, a tough one. You got a tough job, son. Yeah, let us know your favorite Filipino food. We would love to try it. We would love to cook it. Yeah. 100%. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
