 This is Filipino street food and so is this and this. While I've tried a lot of Filipino food during my time living here in the Philippines, I have stayed away from street food so far. While this channel is far from being a mock buying channel or any type of food channel for that matter, I thought that it is about time for me to give Filipino street food a go and document my experience. Alright, hello everyone. Welcome back to my YouTube channel. Today we're at Kiappo Market and we're going to be trying some of the street food that is typical here in the Philippines. We've already met some very interesting and very nice people. Without further ado, let's get right into it. I'm joined today by Bruno. He is a YouTuber here in the Philippines and he's going to be showing me around. Hey, I'm a local. Hopefully he can give us some nice street food and yeah, let's go. We've been here for less than two minutes and I've already been asked if I'm an actor and if I want to have a baby with somebody. The day is starting amazingly splendid. Can we try it? Very good. I love the taste. So what is it? So this is our burger stand? And I can? Yeah, it's nice. It's nice. It's one of the healthier foods around us. Where's the best street food? Yeah. Outside, right side. Okay. Oh, thank you. Oh, good. I'm out of the cinema. Only in the Philippines do you have the chicken on the road? Where? In the States. I hear it. Yes, same. I feel that the worry. What happened? She was like throwing bag in the her face. This is street food. You would try one of each. I will try it. I said three times already, one at one. And I still don't have the food. All right. So this is the first thing that we're trying. We have lumpia. This is apparently Chinese inspired. Some type of dumpling. This is, I think, sweet. And this, to be honest, I don't know what all these things are. As Bruno. So we're now sitting inside this little table food area. I don't know how we got here, to be honest. I thought that we would just try these things on the street there and then. But they were basically invited us like in here and said that we could just eat here. Just kind of nice. It's out of the sun and a little bit more cool because there are all these fans. And there's also this like weird thing at the table. I have no idea what it is. If somebody knows what that is, then feel free to comment. What is that? Yours? I think it's bothersome or something. You know, feel free to comment. I have no idea. There is also a hair in it, which is lovely. Yeah. And this one is every province has its own rice cake. You know, I make a cancel for getting it wrong. But I'm not very keen on my Filipino food. How was it for you? It's not. It's very basic flavors. You know, it's not too strong. You like it personally? I do. You like it. I have a pleasant least surprise. Up next, we have pan-sit. What's it for love actually? Pan-sit. So, let's give it a go. Yeah. To be honest, the noodles are nice. The meat just feels weird because I'm vegetarian. Like, it just generally feels wrong. But the noodles are actually nice. I like it. What's that up? To be honest, I prefer beef papa. I think that's my favorite Filipino meat so far. Yeah, I've been trying it so I'll pick up. Yeah, beef side because also very nice. Next. This is Siyomai. This is our local citrus. You know what this is called? Kalamanse. Yeah, so you just squeeze it on top of the whole thing. And you add soy sauce actually. Here in the Philippines, we like to have it as it is. Almost exactly how it's like done. All right, let's try this one. My vegetarian's going great. Yeah. I like the Kalamanse on it. No, this one is actually good for me. Oh yeah. So it seems like so far in this people, in this place, they've nailed it. It's very porky and it'll compare to the rest. But it's actually good. I like it. It's a good mix of the garlic, the dried one, and then the Kalamanse the soy sauce. How do you taste? So this over here is lumpia. It's our spring rolls. Sometimes you have it fresh, you know, so the things really soft. This one we have it fried. Like, it's more commonly fried than not. Do you dip it in something or not? Vinegar sometimes. There's no vinegar here. This is vinegar, I guess. Let's try lumpia. Is it vegetables? Nope. Pork. Ah, it might be vegetables too. Or agar. Pork. Really? Yeah. The noodles, 10 out of 10, the meat, maybe a four out of 10, then this one was like 10 out of 10. This one I like quite a lot, I would say maybe 7-8 out of 10. And then this one, because it wasn't hot, I would say 6 out of 10. But if it's like made fresh, I think probably like 7. You guys want it? It's so easy. Yeah, but I heard that in the Philippines, if you don't finish your food, that means you didn't like it. And it's super rude. I don't want to be rude to the owner. So I want to finish my food. My god, these foods look so crazy. Everything is like an adventure, you know. It's like, look at this stuff. It's like something you've never seen before. What's your favorite? This one? This is the best. Yeah. All right. Can we get two of this? Two. Thank you. Here it is for you. How much is it? 40. 40 pesos. I'm a real contente. There you go. Time to try this rice sausage. All the comments are going to be like canceling me. What do you have? I'm a real contente. I'm a real contente. I'm a real contente. I'm a real contente. I'm a real contente. What do you mean rice sausage? Sorry. What is it called this one? Naive, naive, naive, naive, naive. Philippine, naive, naive. Perfect. Time to try. I don't want to say what it feels like. What it does. It looks like a sea cucumber, actually. It's very bland. What is it? What does it taste like? I have no idea. I had to explain it. It's like a cinnamon. No, not cinnamon. Peanuts. Like a rice paste. That's how I would explain it. German shows Filipino, Filipino street food. Actually, I like it. I think it's that out of the... Yes. For me, Filipino desserts are usually too sweet. But this one is actually pretty nice. Seven out of ten of them over here, I think. I like it so much. I think we're not really in the street food street. There are clothes everywhere. At the same time, everyone's so kind. So, my design is staying. I feel like I'm a bit tall for these places. Hello. What's your best seller here? Could I get that one? Just a little bit. I just want to try it. I feel like my accessories... I feel like they're kinda ignoring me. So, this is a chicharon. We like deep frying pork. You know, until they're crispy. My inside vegetarian is screaming for help. Let's do it. So, this is deep fried intestine, right? Yes. It's all lovely. It's quite spicy. It's actually very spicy. Oh, it's because of the vinegar. It's not spicy, do you? What? Yes. So, you're saying it's spicy. You're saying it's not spicy. What is going on here? The comment down below if it's supposed to be spicy or not. Out of ten? It'll be honest. It's surprisingly okay. I thought it was gonna be terrible. And it's like, kind of just like chips, you know? The first kid I asked if he wanted, he was like, no. So, I guess that says a lot about the type of food that we're eating. So, they're actually closing some of the street food shops here, which is why we can't do as many street food tastings as we would like. So, we decided that we will go to China town, where there's a lot of other street food that we can try. One to the next street food, it's called Kwak Kwak. It's like whale eggs, beef fried in starch. Let's try it. I think myself. I get to choose... He said, hey, don't block the streets. Okay. Alright, I told him to keep the change, because he kind of got kicked out while we were buying from him. So, I kind of felt bad. I must say not my favorite. Nutrition wise, I'm not so sure. Yeah, I wouldn't eat this if I was on a diet. That's for sure. For honesty, I must say I prefer the other street food. So, this one out of 10? Maybe three. I think one thing about street food here is, we're pretty much big on sauce. So, like some people like to dip this on sweet chili. Because I was gonna say it's very bland, you know? Yeah. It doesn't feel like it's complete. There has to be something with it. I don't know if I'm doing it wrong, but overall, again, not as bad as I thought it would be. So, we couldn't really find the proper street food place for Chinatown, but instead we found this mall, which has a kind of Chinatown section in a way. We're aware that this isn't the real thing, but there's a lot of the same foods here, and apparently it's pretty good, so we're gonna give it a try as well. This is the girl's personal favorite, and Bruno also said it's his favorite. This seems like it's gonna be quite a good one. What is it made of? Scalops. These ones aren't too very nice. Out of 10? Like an eight. I'm not bad at all. Better than the rice dessert. So far it's the highest you ever runked anything here. That's a nice one. We're here in Lucky Chinatown, Lucky Chinatown Mall. We got three things. What is dynamite? It's a personal favorite of mine. This one, it's a popular thing in the Philippines called Shopout. And this one, the purple stuff. This is not ube. Oh, it's not. Yeah, this is called puto bumbung. It's a rice cake. It does come with these all the time. This is coconut sugar. And this is like dried shredded coconut over here. Let's try the dynamite first. So this one is just made of and ketchup, actually. Yeah, it's all right. All right. It's great. Oh, okay. You're fucked, you mean? This one's like ham and cheese. Interesting. My favorite is still the scallops one. Wow. Now on's the trunks and everything. One to the next. Next one is Shopout. At least this one likes it. I think this one in the end, particularly, is unique for this place. It's been on the... Harvey Rails in the country. It tastes different. Oh, that chili oil is spicy. Oh my god. It kind of tastes like there's something in Korea that I try that tastes similar. It's the rice cakes, I guess. But no, no, no, the filling. This one's nice, actually. Out of 10? I changed my mind on the scallops thing, by the way. It's 9. What? Yeah, and then this one I think is 8. Hey. For each one of us, you... Last one. Some say it's a dessert, some say it's not. This is probably one of the most popular... Astable foods. Do you like it? Sometimes I do. Sometimes I hate it. Okay, I like it normal, though. I'm sure it's weird for you. There's nothing like this on here. Is it made from the same thing that those like... that bubble tea is made of? The purple bubble tea, what's it called? Tarot. Tarot. Yeah, is it? No, it's not. No, well, I was gonna say it tastes similar. Maybe it knows flavor that way. But I like it. Actually I prefer it than the first dessert that we tried. Yeah, nicer. I think this is the most, for me, the most pleasant to eat. That's right. That's gonna be it from me for today. I hope you guys enjoyed this street food video.
