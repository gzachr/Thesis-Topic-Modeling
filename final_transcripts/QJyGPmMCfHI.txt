 And again a lot of people, if you meet somebody that has a big role, you know, you end up in what you're all should. I mean I can say I'm a big stool table and I need somebody to tag the area where it happens. It's possible, you know. So when you post your face, when you post this video and you're single, are there going to go man, man, looking for you? Oh, God. I like to meet somebody. Do you have a Facebook page? Sure. What's your face? What is it? John, John, John. Yeah, it's Adrian D Middle initial hood, 8-0-o-d. Adrian D Good. And they can find you on Facebook. I'm in Facebook. So I'm friends with you on Facebook. You're going to be flooded. So anybody, anybody seeking to contact Adrian? Don't call me, call him. Adrian, ADRI and Middle initial D Good. So what kind of age bracket are you all pretty good at? Well, I don't have a good answer for that because I've noticed that. The age differences here are the mentality and the maturities are different from the states. So I don't know. I'm open. I'm open. I'm open. I'm open, you know. I don't want to rule somebody in or out because of some parameter that really means nothing. But you have a dead lease one. Want to see a photo? Oh, for sure. But your net concern that the woman has a child or a single mother, your net concern? That's updated. Women that have, you know, sold them all whole life. I mean, in subit, I don't have a problem with kids. And that's a common thing is that they're all single. They're everywhere and where I'm from too. And that's still big thing. I mean, it's not the child's. It's not like, it's not the wrong. That's not school fruit or nothing. But you're up to having a family here because in the morning, we need to get your net into age bracket, right? We just want to have a child in the classroom. I am, that is, yes, something that would be considered because I don't have any children yet. I'm not opposed to that. I'm not against that by no means. What is your book time as your lesson? One. One. Oh, okay. I thought you had some big fancy camera. You don't just have that. What would you like to meet someone? I mean, we're in the Taliban area now. I am. I'm staying in downtown Taliban. I'd like to meet somebody from this area or maybe even on the island of the hole. I'm here for a couple of weeks and would be very interested in meeting someone a nice girl. Oh, that's great. So we're looking forward to meeting. And there's no restriction on age to a limit. How old are you? We got to go into that. Well, I'll extend 50. Very young man. Just a mere child. 50. So, I don't feel 50. Well, there we go. Any ladies that are in the Taliban area, I'm sure that there are because we have lots of people contacting us. I'm interested in meeting someone. I always have to write back to them and say, sorry, I can't help. But here is Adrian. And he's interested, sorry, nothing to do with me. Correct. And I'm going to be in the Philippines for a couple of weeks. And I'm going to be back in Subou. Maybe even go as far as Duma Gettie this time. If not, I tend to be back in December or January. Okay. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
