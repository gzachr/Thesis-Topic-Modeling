 What is up ladies and gentlemen flying kale here and today I am at the last sole university we can see the university behind us right now it looks really really good there is a little bit of a fence in front of it though so let's see if we can make our way in there guys really modern buildings and nice grassy fields and a lot of people it looks like a very very beautiful university from the outside that's for sure the university was established in 1911 so it's quite an old university it was founded by a Christian brotherhood it's named after the Lassolle brothers who are a parish origin good vibes around the campus already so the Lassolle University is located right next to Tuft Avenue which is a very very busy street the main entrance of the Lassolle University the Lassolle University is an elite university here in the Philippines and also in the world it ranks very well so a very very good academic institution let's see if we can get in people I've heard that it could be quite a challenge but we got to get it done let's start the mission awesome massive doors I feel like a VIP already stage one has been cleared wow the entrance hall looks really nice guys check this out now let's see we can actually get in flying bell is in I even have my very own entry card don't ask me how I did it I have my ways I'm a member of the club now people I'm a member of the club okay so look at this guys look at this black right here the Lassolle University has a lot of history guys as I said earlier it was established by a Christian brotherhood and it also had a role to play during World War II when the Japanese invaded Manila during World War II the Lassolle was actually one of the very few universities that remained in operation because it was kind of located on the outside of the city so what happened was other neighboring universities which included the Ataneo de Manila Lassolle's big rival school actually had students take class here at the Lassolle so the Lassolle and Ataneo had to put their legendary school rivalry behind them and take classes together that is nice that in difficult times you know they're able to put away their vicious rivalry and still come together the campus was actually used during certain periods of World War II as a civilian refuge and after that the Japanese took it over and used it as a defense headquarters this black right here is in remembrance of the Christian brothers that were killed during World War II they were Lassolle brothers serving here a lot of history here at the Lassolle and the memorial plaque is located right next to the school chapel look at this it's gorgeous apparently this chapel dates back to 1924 beautiful woodworking and benches a mosaic in the windows I think I have seen the chapel I'm gonna head over to the next destination despite the fact that the Lassolle is located right next to Taf Avenue which is so busy with so much traffic and loud noises once you get inside you enter a beautiful little study scientific paradise with trees and gorgeous all buildings a lot of a very good studying can be done here guys in peace Lassollians are sitting there under the shade of the tree in this beautiful little courtyard and this looked like a prime place to chill after class enough chilling facilities here at the Lassolle that's for sure for those who do not yet know I myself studied at the Arasmas University in Rotterdam peaking University in Beijing and at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia I'm just gonna kind of explore the Lassolle and compare it to my own University experience you can call that is where the museum of Delosal University is located that building is just extremely impressive very well maintained gorgeous making my way to the next destination of today's epic Delosal University tour what we saw earlier at the start of the video was the old chapel and now we have arrived at the new chapel and apparently there is a relic inside a little surprise and I'll tell you guys about it when I see it this chapel was a lot smaller but also very nice here is the surprise the relic that is being kept here in this chapel it is a bone of Saint Blasal himself before father of the Lassolle University this is where the library of Delosal University is apparently this is the center of the LSU and I can see that because there are a lot of students here the coolest thing about this building is that it is completely supported by pillars like it doesn't touch the ground so there's a whole shady area right at the bottom of it and everybody's just chilling basically under the building that is so cool that is some serious design right there the LSU is actually quite a small university campus so they've come up with some really brilliant plans to maximize the space on their campus grounds and I think having a building that's basically like supported by pillars with a lot of space under it is one of those ways we're going in people we're going in I'm so excited I'm gonna be walking under a building a lot of people chilling here I just have a good time under this huge building right here super nice little air tunnel here so you get a nice breeze and you get the shade I am making my way up apparently there's a really cool bridge that connects several buildings together and I want to walk that because you're gonna get an epic view of Europe there this building in particular it really reminds me actually of my own campus the Erasmus University in the Netherlands and the size of the campus does as well actually it's a very similar size to touch university campuses it's much smaller than like the campuses in Beijing or the one of you pen and up and up we're going people that view on that bridge is going to be epic I can't wait we have made away to the top I can see the bridge and this is already so nice super cool design very modern there's no window here people no windows optimum breeze design okay we are on the bridge the whole history of Dela Salle University it's laid out here and I'll just show you one the most significant happening 1911 people the birth of Dela Salle University on June 16th the brothers of the Christian schools opened the first Lasalle school there you have it the view here is really cool we can see a huge football field there that right there is the national football stadium of the Philippines standing here on this bridge I can see it with a perfect view I've heard that when big international matches are happening here this entire bridge just fills up with Dela Salle students and they're all watching the match for free just an added bonus of attending Dela Salle University epic free football games we have arrived at the auditorium let's have a little peek just a sneak a little peek that is huge that looks like they can have some really really cool activities and performances there actually that reminds me of the theater at a pen and at Beijing University they have very similar theaters to this where they have plays and performances we're in the Dela Salle lift going down to the ground floor taking it as a cons people this is adventure right here this is exploring and here we have the DLSU store I've read online that there's a lot of school pride going on here so everybody probably comes here and buys their shirts before a sports game especially against attenayo people then they're definitely going to show their school pride and they're probably all wearing the school colors which are white and green green stands for the Irish origin of Dela Salle and white symbolizes the Philippines being a pearl in the oriental seeds we have found the Dela Salle University school mascot the green archer this mascot has a very special story behind it it represents saint Dela Salle who was a very rich man but sacrificed his wealth for the good of society so this is kind of like robinhood right honestly out of a lot of school mascots that I've seen in my day a guy shooting a bone arrow that's pretty bad ass people that's pretty badass we are on the main walkway of campus and there's a lot of students walking here I feel like everybody's happy people I'm getting the happy vibe right now so this is really really nice is that the canteen guys I see a lot of people standing in front of little food stalls so let's check that out quickly I think this might not be the main canteen more of a standing eat something really fast high place right here this just seems like a great place to get a snack there's little stone desks right here outside under this little sunscreen right here and the people are just studying here the universities I went to were all in countries where you have like summer and winter and in the winter you know the weather gets cold people believe me the campus will be snowed over but I've never seen that before but that's so cool you can just study outside year round in the beautiful weather of the Philippines this looks like some type of activity area and I'm assuming those are like student organizations people are doing a lot of extra curricular activities that actually really reminds me of American student life because in America extra curricular activities are actually very very important and add a lot to student life on those campuses they have a fun and diverse student life right here on a DLSU another chill little food place wow guys I'm not getting it smells really good it's making me hungry just smelling it right now it smells so good it's really cool they just have a bunch of little food stalls and food places around campus you don't have to go to one central area you can just walk from one place to another and it probably has like a food place somewhere people so you can fill up those tummies and concentrate in class this is a really nice bustling little area here on campus they're that subway so you can get a nice subway sandwich my campuses never had fast food on them but it's pretty cool that they got subway right here and they have star box as well that is really cool actually out of all the universities I went to there was one with star box and that was pen pen has a star box on campus as well and I spent quite a bit of time there chilling myself so prime chill location right here and we are now nearing the tallest school building in the Philippines right here look at that it is very very tall wow it comes down to Delasol University campus being quite small in comparison with other university campuses so they come up with smart ideas to solve that problem and one of those ideas is hey let's just build a taller school building in the country because why not wow they have their very own shopping mall here it is owned by SM this is a legit mall right here on campus so in between classes you can go shopping if you want that is so epic believe me none of the universities I've attended in the Netherlands China or the US have had their own shopping malls so Delasol University actually has its own sports complex they have their own swimming pool so after a really bad exam we're sweating your butt off you're gonna jump in the water right here and cool down a little bit the universities I attended in China and the US had their own swimming pools too it's always really really nice when a university has its own sports facilities I just got out of the lift guys I took the lift all the way up to the ninth floor of the Delasol University sports complex this is where the sports teams of Delasol practice Delasol University is actually famous for its strong sports teams most notably it's basketball team it's football team cheerleaders and the volleyball team and we can actually see a few basketballers playing and practicing right now to check it out that is an epic basketball field right here people wow there we have the DLSU cap with a green archer on it and look at this guys here we have some gigantic trophies that the sports teams here have won so check it out these trophies are these trophies are cool well the trophies here are the rewards for winning the most games in the entire league and Delasol has three of them people that is an epic performance right here we just went down the stairs and we are now in the PE classroom this is a giant PE classroom guys and just like that people we are out of the sports complex we are now on our way to the facade of the Saint Delasol Hall which is meant to be a very iconic and beautiful part of campus everybody's just chilling and studying and the vibes are really good here guys really like that's the thing right like bigger is not always better this is a little bit of a smaller campus but it just makes the whole campus way more cozy way more bustling everything's like nice and tightly knit together and I think that's a very nice thing and there we have it people the facade of the Saint Delasol what a very very beautiful building ah it's just I feel like it's really affected me just being here you know like there's some kind of magic I think about going on here it's just so nice and look whoa look at that my t-shirt just suddenly turned green Delasol that must be because of this beautiful building right here no other explanation so I read online that this building is the only building in the Philippines that is included in the one thousand and one buildings you must visit before you die I can see why people this is a very very beautiful building and it actually really reminds me of like beautiful grand buildings in the United States like in New York in the courthouse for instance very very beautiful all right guys my transformation is complete I'm a real lasalia now don't forget to follow me on instagram if you want to
