 No one. This is the flavor so good. Fire. What's up, you all found? Today, we have a huge selection of Filipino snacks, and we're gonna try it for the first time. First time. We put a pull up and asked, what Filipino snacks you'd like to see us try? We listened to what you guys had to say and bought all of them. At least in the one. It's funny, because when we were shopping for a lot of the snacks, the movie's like, I have no idea what they say. She's never seen it before. I'm having Filipino, so I've had some of these snacks before, like growing up as a kid. And Josh was so excited here. He was just like jumping around like, I can't wait for you to try this.

All right. Oh, it's not. Oh, it smells so good. I don't know, I'm really hungry. But you never had this before, right? I feel like, no, I had it. Maybe for me, don't put it in. Yeah, wait. All right, together. Cheek. Wow. Have another one, bite it, but this time bite it in half. But you took too much time? It's really good. You bite it in half. Let's see, let's talk about filling.

I'm going to eat it. I'm going to eat it. I'm going to eat it. It's really good. Okay, that's enough of me. Oh, it is so good. Yeah, but especially when you get that aftertaste of like the powder, the cheese powder. How many more do we have left? Quite a few. That's good. Do you know what I like most about these Filipino snacks? I really like the packaging. It's fun. All bright and fun. Yeah. Okay, so this one, another one recommended by one of you guys. This is the sour cream and onion bia toz. I was going to get the original flavor. I think it was cheddar. But then someone said get sour cream and onion. So here we are. I love sour cream and onion cream on it. I think that's an elite flavor. I love sour cream and onion. I'm so glad. No, it's not. I've never had that before either. I know it's going to be good. Ooh, they look really cool. Is this cheddar, is this corn as well? No, potato. All right, cheers. Cheers. Okay, for me. Okay, let's go. I dropped it. All right. Mmm. Oh, it tastes like crispers. No. It's lighter though. I don't like that. This is good. Oh, this is good. I like how it's light. It feels very light. Yeah, all these snacks don't feel like you're shoving a bunch of heavy food in your bowl. Mmm. Oh, I really like this one. I really like this. It's not too salty. That's true. Or sweet or whatever. Really good. I can finish this whole bag. Like really fast too. This is really good flavor. But I bet they have insane flavors. You know what I mean? In the pot, in the second, in the Philippines, they probably have way more flavors. I'm going to put this in the pot. Yeah, like we didn't see many flavors at the start. This flavor and shutter. I think it was shutter. But yeah, like they really killed like a sour comment on your taste really good. Really good. I feel like if they have like other flavors, they'd be awesome. So far, I really like this one. Look, this one's. I may not most, but really high up. This is really good. Yeah, they really did. This is, they did a really good job. This tastes like a high quality snack. Yeah, it's really high on. Sweet corn. Smell. That's good. It smells really, it smells like, how do you, it smells so like, you know what I mean? Ready? Wow. Is it thinking? Wow. That was like a burst of flame. Mm. Hi. Did you taste that? Yeah. It's like, you know how we have cheese puffs? Mm-hmm. It's like a corn puff, sweet corn puff. This is so much better. You know what I mean? This is insane. This is so good. I don't know how they make this. I tasted, I want to taste, I want to eat it. I taste like the, the flavor like bursts after two. Mm-hmm. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. The flavor like bursts after two. It's a really thick thing. It's kind of too sweet for me, I'm more of me honest. I like hot, I like the sweet, the sweet, the sweet, the sweet. I like the sweet, the sweet. I think it's a little too sweet for me. I like sweet, too. I like having, I like eating like, not as sweet, this is the worst sweet. It's good, back in only so many. You know like, corn on the cob, like, like, it tastes like that sweetness though. I'm not thinking I ever had corn in the cob. It's just like a corn, like sweet corn, like a actual real piece of sweet corn. It tastes exactly like that. I'm done. You're doing this one? It's too sweet for me. I like it, I like it. It can't last one for me too. It's good though, I like the flavor, it's just too sweet for me. Yeah, I last wanted. Yeah. He looks into the bag. We got a B-cut. This is a cheese flavored B-cut. And another recommendation, but you guys, shout out. I'm gonna try right now. I never have this before. It's now a cheesier than ever. I'm gonna try it. Cheers. Mmm. A little odd cheese on here. Yeah, it's really cheesy. This is extremely cheesy. It tastes kind of artificial though. It does taste really artificial. I'm not huge fan of how the cheese tastes artificial. I like, I mean, I'm, you know what? These chips are good. I'm not huge fan of it either. But I could see how people really like this. It's so good. They're good chips. But not, I'm not huge. I like them though. Thanks to the roller coaster rings. Roller coaster potato rings. Done chips. One flavor, cheese and? Cheddar cheese. Thank you. Oh, my goodness. Yeah. Alright, cheers. Mmm. I like the texture of it. Mike, wait, this tastes very similar. Like the one, the other ones we have. I like that. I like it too. That's light. Mmm. It's cheesy. I was very cheesy. You know what? You know what? I like about Filipino snaps or these ones that we've had. Is that like the breading or whatever you call it? If the outside, the, the no, the actual, there is like really light. Oh yeah. If the sour cream onion one. Yeah. It's like that. Yeah. It's like white and crispy. Got that crunch. Mmm. I like this one. The cheese is not, not overpowering in this one. Very cheesy. I like a very delicious kind of cheese. Mmm. Mmm. Wow. Don't penis doing it so good. One of my favorites right now. It's really good. Last one. The ube sticko. I really like sticko but I've never had ube flavored before. Really? I've never had ube flavored. I only like chocolate, strawberry. I really want to try this ube flavored.
