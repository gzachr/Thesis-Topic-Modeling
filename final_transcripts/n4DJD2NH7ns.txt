 How was it? Mabuhay, Magandangabe and welcome back to MGMD.co. Arbisio Vela and today we will be reacting to a very interesting video. Rich vs. Poor, Pulu Bing for an social experiment Philippines. If I'm understanding this correctly, he will bag rich Filipinos and poor Filipinos. For money or food and we will see who is the most generous. I think that's what I'm getting from this title. Before we start, please consider following me on Instagram at Music, Game, News and without further ado, let's get to it. Oh my god! Oh my goodness. Well, I'm pretty sure that he's eating from a garbage that he put there, right? Just to be safe. You know, he's not going to eat something that's going to be a risk to his health obviously because this is a social experiment. But he's doing it well. Very believable. Oh. It's reaction. It's reaction. Was she just jogging? Whoa, this is the first time that I see someone in the Philippines with an umbrella to protect them from the sun. Come here. Oh my god. I love the reaction and every time he gives them money back. He's like, oh, so confusing. Love it. It's so confused. He should put exclamation points and question marks on their heads. You know, like, can you help me? Soft drink. Bless you. Hey, watch. See, that's what I like to do with, you know, beggars. I'd rather give them food or drinks. I don't like giving them money because usually what they do with that money is buy more alcohol or drugs or something, you know. This one for you? Why? No. I just want to say something about it. Whoa. Hey. I love you. No. You're good. God bless you. You can break your legs. No, it's okay. This is awesome. You can break your legs. There you go. You can break your legs. See, it's a sin at last, right? I'm not going to buy it. You can break it. You can break it. I can. Yeah, goodness. I'm going to destroy it. No choice. What kind of a stroke are they talking about? Is it like a heat stroke or something? You're just going to die. I'm going to die for this. I'm going to die for this. You're going to die. You're going to die for this. Thank you so much. God bless you. No, I'm just saying no. I'm good. Thank you so much. God bless you. Yeah. Lovely. Awesome. Can you help me? Anything? God bless you. God bless you. Thank you so much. That's very sweet. No house. No house. Street. Thank you so much. You're so kind. I'm so thirsty, so hot. What's your name? Nimpa. Is your house? Your husband? Your teacher. Oh, okay. God bless you. Yeah, I want to return the favor. You need it more. You need it more. You need it more. You need it more. You need it more. You need it more. And then more for you. Please, because you're so kind. You just want to return the favor. I will give it to somebody who needs it. They're so confused. They're like, bro, you need this. Because he's not actually explaining to them what he's doing. You know, the social experiment. Have anything for me? Oh, God bless you. I can't buy panties out now. It's good because I'm dirty. Maybe it washes me. You're so kind. Baker is there. You buy something else? That's very nice. Busy? Yeah. Say it in a... Hey! That's awesome. You can't do it. You can't do it. You can't do it. You can't do it. Oh, it's coconut water. Let's see how... I didn't show how he cuts it. I can't do it. I can't do it. Oh, God bless you. Thank you. It's not that bad. It's not that bad. It's good that you can do it. You can't do it. It's good. You can't do it. You can't do it. You can't do it. You can't do it. You can't do it. You can't do it. What's your name? Manolito. I'm very happy. Manolito. I'm not going to leave my blessing. I'm not going to leave my blessing. He's so confused. He is puzzled. I'm not going to leave my blessing. I'm not going to leave my blessing. Manolito, how are you doing? I'm fine. You're fine. Manolito. You're fine. Manolito, how are you doing? Manolito. Great job. Nice to meet you. Manolito. Manuelito, my man. Oh wow, that was great. I mean, hey, he showed more of the poor people giving back rather than showing a lot more of the richer people, maybe not giving back, but also giving back. I feel like it wasn't balanced enough, you know what I mean? But usually, usually and unfortunately, the people willing to give are the people who don't have much, you know, because they can actually relate. And even, I don't know, and even people who started from the bottom and got to riches, unfortunately, they tend to forget where they came from, you know, where they started. So, yeah. But yeah, this was a great video. I just wish it was more balanced, but yeah, clearly, clearly there are people that are generous, you know, not just in the Philippines, all around the world, you know. But he got guts, he got guts to do these type of videos where he like dresses as a hobo, you know, and goes around and asks people for money. And I'm guessing in the Philippines is not that difficult because Filipinos are kind, you know, and they're willing to help. So yeah. But yeah, I'm pretty sure he might be Syrian, like the Syrian wanderer, you know, like I feel like these are the same type of videos the Syrian wanderer does, you know, so I wouldn't be surprised. So if you have more information about this dude, what's his name again? Foreign germs. Foreign germs. There you go. Let me know in the comment section.
