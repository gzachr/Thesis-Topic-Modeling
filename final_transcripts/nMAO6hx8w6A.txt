Oh, barbecue pork on point. Cheers, guys. Enjoy. Have a good day. It's a variation, isn't it? Right here. Is that a double pork? So, we have a barbeque chicken pork. We got the double pork and we got the barbecue chicken, right? Mmm. So, for us trying this food, this is about as authentic as it gets. It's just like it came off the street in Manila. It's going on. Big, big, speaking travels. You know who it is. Filipino food connoisseur. So, we're out here today on Rupert Street in Soho. And I decided I wanted to try some Filipino kind of barbecue. I'm missing it because on the Manila streets you can get that anywhere. People just cook up and they're outside their house. This is readily available. But in here in London we can only get in one place. And you know where it is. Spoon and rice, baby. Angsara. Yo, guys. So, a lot of you are from Philippines in the audience. So, when I was in Philippines in Manila, you can also get pork barbecue on a stick for around like 13 to 15 pesos. Back in the day it was just 10 pesos and stuff like that. So, it was relatively more quite cheap and delicious. Here in London everything is relative compared to where we live and how much we earn. So, it's a bit more but it's still a really good price for food, especially with this portion size. So, we've got a combo today and I'm going to try some barbecue chicken as well for you guys. Hello, so what's your name? Hi, I'm Jeff. So, anyone knows me in Jaffaillon. We found a mini restaurant in the heart of Chinatown, including lunch, and then dumpling legend. I know the Filipino love food, they love outdoor, like most Chinese and Asian. They love indoor air conditioning. Which is to celebrate that barbecue Filipino food, which is definitely prepared into the conscience of the British public. It's a British love BBQ. In Filipino, I want to teach you a word. If you like something and it's delicious, you say Masara. Masara. Can you say Masara? Masara. Masara. Masara. So, is this the first time you had Filipino food, Oli? No, we've been here many times.
