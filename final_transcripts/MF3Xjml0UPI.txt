 So what we're gonna do is, I'm gonna order you some selections of Filipino grilled street food. Then you're gonna take a bite, and only after you've eaten it, will I tell you what it is. What is happening guys, when you're watching, long, joint is as a travel around the world. Let's go. We start off with chicken isao. So you know it's chicken, but you don't know what isao is. Just tell me what it's like. I'm going to do this for content, let's go. Like I said, you have to pass, right? My rule is you have to take a bite of everything. One bite. Eat time bite. Okay. Oh. Wow. Corn? Sweet. Lemonade? Good. All right. I'm scared she'll know what they said. It's like sausage. Pretty close, yeah. What do they use to make sausage? Don't tell me. It's chicken intestine. What? Why the face near? I know, okay. You know, it's easy. It's tasty. Yeah, and I know I shouldn't be telling you this, but when Kuyajian was a young drunk university student, student, I'd get a dozen of those. I'd scrape them all on a plate, and I'd pour spaghetti sauce on top. And I'd eat it like a meat noodle spaghetti. It works like a meat spaghetti. I think I was gonna be able to eat all that. But then I did. I mean, it doesn't taste bad. Right? It's all psychological. It's just a thought that makes it bad. You have tried it. It reminds me of my childhood days, eating this in the side of the streets. That's really good. I like it. Bravo. I'm happy that the kids tried it. Oh no. Oh yeah. It's just like it. No, no, no. Now, if you like textures, this is an intriguing texture. So we're going back to chicken again. Oh, chicken. So we call this balloon. It sounds like pee pee. No, no, no, it's not. So what is it called? I have chicken your mom. It's chicken balloons. All balloons. Okay. We then use our snack. We use most good ones. Enjoyable stuff. It's true. It's just a kind of an old one. That is tough. I thought you were a kid. But that's the part that makes it very unique. It's that interesting texture. Just crunch into it. Like a carly. Yeah, it's like almost like carterlitz, right? It's like meat with a crunch. You have that crunch. It's a weird, weird texture. I'm afraid to hear what it means. One utility later. This is so true. All right, for our science class today, we'll learn a little bit about our avian friends or birds. So have you noticed that birds do not chew? They swallow things full, right? So how do they chew their food? That's where that part comes into play. Chicken tongue. Hello? Yes? No, no, no. It's a chicken gizzard as it's called. Now the gizzard is a very hard working muscle inside inside birds. So it just squeezes and crushes the food again and again. And that's how they chew their food. Now these are teaspoon. Yeah, right, they're teaspoon. I just cannot chew it. Yes. So let me ask you this. What do you like better? Their gizzard or the intestine? The intestine. Yeah, because they can actually eat the intestines. What? I can actually eat the intestines. I can not chew on it. What's next? Oh. Your parents will totally get this. This is what we call the walkman. So if you own the walkman, you know already what this is. You're born in the 80s or the 70s. You know what a walkman is. I think it was cool when I had my walkman back then. It's just like, it stays the same. No, no, no, no. It's just like, it stays the same. No, no, no. It stays the same. Oh, such a picky bite. That's the part where you caramelize barbecue sauce on top. No, you don't know what it is. Yeah. No, eat it. No, she's the barbecue sauce. Oh, I don't know if I can eat it. I ate the good part. No, no, no, no, you got to take a bite. You did take a bite. Or else, clearly, she has to get mad. Okay. It's all in her head. I can see by her face, she don't like it. What did I eat? Well, after your sister takes a bite, I'll let you know. Come on, yeah. For content, yeah. For content. For content. You guys subscribe right now and she'll eat it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You had to eat it. Just a little bit. There we go. Okay, we got it, you got it. If I did like that, then I'm sorry. Yeah, because this is a very fatty thing. So, I like to care about it. I like I suck nothing. So, that's the barbecue sauce. So, to update the name, Walkman. So, the Walkman would have been something me and your parents would have understood. So, in more modern content, where do you put your iPod? Huh? What's that mean? They don't know what a iPod is. I didn't know as well. Army that old? Yeah. Ways in iPod! Oh. How do you listen to music? AirPods. AirPods. So, fine, I would call this dish an AirPods. You know why? It's an ear. It's an ear. It's been ear, Nia. Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. Just chewed on a pig ear. Uh. Thanks, wait. Why are white drinks so chewy? Well, that's your own ear. If you can see, it's nothing but fat, skin and cartilage. I can imagine this in like a taco where I get you with cilantro, onions, a little bit of hot sauce. Mmm tasty. Go to the nice tasty ones. Alright. Oh, how's your name? So this one, but we call this a Thai. So in Filipino folklore, the vampire is supposed to like this. It's a neck. Thanks for telling me. It's not neckiness. Oh, it's a baby. It's not a baby. It's like blood. But it's not blood because blood is red. And it's not a neck because it's bigger. Take a bite and I'll let you know. Put you out of your misery. Oh, oh, but you. Okay. Yummy. That's really good. Okay, let me help you. You might have eaten that already. Meatballs. Where are you going? That's right. Let your sister try. Okay, it doesn't look bad at all. It looks like meatballs. Oh, okay. And they're what? Meatballs. Like a meatball. Oh, no, I'm kidding. That's so good. I'm fairly surprised I see adults who hate that stuff. Oh, no. No, no, no. Eat if it's tasty, no matter what it is. Keep eating, right? Don't have different taste buds. Yeah. Don't go to it. Yeah, just like a meatball with sauce on it. All right. So that is pork liver. I hate meatballs. Are we not friends anymore? After all the stuff I put you through. I said who the real one. But yeah, congratulations. You enjoyed the liver. Because I tasted duck liver before. Oh, from grind. Yeah, it's tasty. Yeah, and then I'm like, I'm like, I'll just take kind of taste like it. Definitely tasting liver. Well, like outside. Like right now. I mean, you take out the sauce. You know you're tasting liver. So this is another iso. So if you were listening, you already know what an iso is. I mean, intestine. Good job. Yes, this is pork iso. It's big intestine. Right, it's way not. So you let me know what's tasty or a big intestine or a chicken intestine. Where am I? How are you in need? Taste. It's like chewy or not chewy. It's like fat but not fat. It's like, I give it. I give it a 7 out of 10. Now it gives us like a 6 out of 10. I like that you get intestines like your first one. Yeah, that's the chicken to 10 out of 10. Yeah, right? Oh, like 5? Yeah, now we go to the good stuff. So let's go with the regular pork barbecue. Okay. Alright, so this is how pork barbecue would be done here in the Philippines. Do you know what pork but is? Oh, yes, it's definitely gonna try this. No, no, it's regular pork meat, pork shoulder. Like the same one they use for ham. So this is just like the favorite grilled hot dog here in the Philippines. This is a strange kind of hot dog. They were trying it before. I like the pork better. Not the fan of that hot dog. No, there's because it was called it. This is more like squishy hot dog because in the US more chewy. Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You're more used to the snap that you would get from a hot dog. Yeah, hot dogs here in the Philippines. We don't, it doesn't have that snap that you're looking for. Yes, yes, yes. It's a mushy guy. Is that wraps up the grilled portion? Now it's off to... Deep fry. Deep fry portion. Let's go. But before that quick sweet snack. What a great presentation house. I know, they even take it in everything. Ready? Wow. Wow. That is beachy beachy. So it's a nice soft, sweet treat made out of pasta. So you'll notice it as you travel more around the Philippines. We treat cheese as a dessert ingredient. So you will start seeing like the most iconic flavor is in ice cream, for example. Yeah. Okay, so ice cream. So you will have this and next, if you can open it up. So it looks very similar because it also is stuffed with cheese. Also made with cassava. But they cook it differently. There's a lot of coconut in it as well. So it will be... It reminds you of sweet sticky rice cake. Oh, yes. What do I need to try first? I'll go with the peachy peachy. Okay. It's kind of jelly-like. What? Yeah, it looks really good. It looks like a gongdra. Yeah, I could taste the cheese on top. It's really good. It's like, beat that Helen's dessert that she picks. Now this is, yeah, make something like this is really, really good. And it's like mochi. Like gum drop. Really, really good. Peach, peach, eat my... Very mild. It's kind of like how's that balance between light and heavy. So it looks very similar because it also is stuffed with cheese. Also made with cassava. This is baked. And then the first one, the peachy peachy was sweet. I like this better. I like this better. I like this better. Oh, yeah. Fun fact, did you know that cassava is improperly made. It can kill you. It's both of the poison generally and the skin. And then of course the cooking process, chemically, we can sit as well. So generally, if it's properly cooked, then it's all good. We have enough of my food. Are you full yet, Novin? No paparazzi, please. Paparazzi. Man, these guys have been eating non-stop and that was only our third spot. We were at the barbecue grill spot for like an hour. We have what we call quick, quick. So those are balls, orange balls. Any idea what they are? Orange balls. This one, the small one. The big one is a duck egg. Oh, that was good. And then we're going to have proven. I will let you know what it is after you've taken a bite. So let's start off with the orange balls first, alright? They're called quick, quick. And in sour batter. It's delicious. Is this savory? And it's like flavorful? It's like, it's like a little snack. I could have like 10 of these easily. That's really, really good. I never had 12 eggs without batter. The batter is pretty plain, but I think it's designed to mix well with the sauce. I'm not quick, quick. I don't know if you can tell, but I am sweating like crazy. I'm your assistant. What do you mean? Mom, duty is my assistant. I'm assistant. It's like one second. This is what happens when you go vegetarian. Alright, now I'm proven. proven? This is not, I thought it was called proven, but it's called proven. It's a proven. It's called proven. It's called proven. proven, yeah. Not the proven, not proven. It is a calamari. That's great. It's like a mix of chicken, not fried chicken. Chicken nuggets, the same texture as a calamari. You want to know what it is? What part of the chicken it is? No. It's called a bon chicken. That is... She said chicken balls. That proven, tricolus. So that's a scientific name. Which is the true stomach of a chicken. You're eating a chicken stomach. Oh, not bad. Pretty tasty, right? Look at the dogs just chomping away and the nears like, oh no. We're going to have what we call banana turonis. So think of like a... That is so good. An egg roll covered in caramel stuffed with banana and sugar. It's like caramelized and then like a bitter cake at the end. Always amazing. I love turonis. The crunch inside is like, it's like a batter. And the banana just gives it a sweet taste to end it. Very savory, very nice. Overall, 10 out of all. All right. Go Ling Mo. Go Ling Mo. Go Ling Mo. Go Ling Mo. Go Ling Mo. Where is it? All right, let's go. So what we have here is... Puto. So Puto is a rice cake here in the Philippines. It's not the other one you're thinking about. For our espoir de cores. And I've buried usually with sea sink. It's not a Filipino thing. It's a cuyagee and thing. Let's take a quick look inside. There are pork flavors over here. There we go. So this is cheese and butter. This is what they call that. Tandaan. So it's a local leaf in the American Southeast Asia. This is muscovado sugar. So it's a less processed form of sugar. Yeah, even more lower than that. And umbe, yes, the purple yeah. So I want of each. Now we're going to pair these with the sea sink. And I would, I describe it to people. It's kind of like eating a cornbread with pork hash. So it works. It's like a cornbread. It's like a cornbread. It's like a cornbread. With with pork hash. So it works real well. Let's go, baby. I'm having a stomachache. It's so hot. I'm having it with ice. Cheers. Cheers. The next behalf here is Pinapa Itan. It's called Papa Itan. Careful, guys, because like I said, it's oily. Hot. There's a fire underneath. Can you repeat the name again? It's Papa Itan or Pinapa Itan. The solid things you see in this is everything you can find inside a cow. But the weirdest ingredient that we put here is bile. It's a liquid found in most animals, because I know frogs have them. I know snakes have them. You have to be careful with bile, because it ruins the meat. Like a lid too much of it, and it will be too disgusting to eat basically. What we're doing, yeah. What we do is we add just a little bit here. Just to add that flavor profile we're looking for. So it's a nice, tasty sour, salty, umami rich soup. It smells good. It smells good. So there's no like snake on it. Yes, it's very similar. Very similar. So Nia just messed up on the whole explanation. She was at the restroom, and sat down at ita papa Itan, without even thinking about her. She had no idea what to do. See, that's the trick for Nia. Don't tell her anything about it. See, she just ate it. Yeah. It's really good, right? Do you want to know what it is? No, thank you. Okay, enjoy. So by eating this soup, you are in the 1% of the human population that have willingly eaten bile. So bile, not many cultures in the world consume bile. Purposefully. Wow. Good job. You're in a 1%ile now. Yeah. And it works really well. The broth is really tasty. I just want like a bowl of rice just soak it in the broth. It's like Sini gaonlo. Mix it up a little bit sour. That's good. It is similar to the other than the salmon. That's really good. Very sour, limey. Yeah. Sini gaonlo. Definitely rich in flavor. I'm going to keep eating it. Look, it makes me want to eat more. I'll wait you up by the way. This will be a good morning soup. So this is sea sig. That looks so good. Yep, can you smell it? So what is inside of it? So it's pork belly. A crispy pork dish. They chop it up real fine. They've added onions, it's sugar, and an egg, and butter. So you squeeze on a couple of calamansis on top just to cut the richness of the fatty pork. And then you mix it all together. If you know originally it was made from pig head. But everything you could get from the head of a pig. That's what they would put on a sea sig. But nowadays since everyone wants sea sig, it's one of the most favorite dishes here in the Philippines. Everyone's fighting for the pig head sender. So only how many heads per pig? What? And how much meat can you get from it? Just a little bit, right? Yeah. So most sea sigs that you come upon are actually made from pork belly. Because the belly of the pork is really, really big, right? Like we a G and Spins. Wait, did you guys agree? No, no. We're a great. But hands down, my favorite sea sig version would be, what's that shellfish where you generally eat it for all? They cook it for this sea sig version. Oysters. Oysters. Oyster sea sig if you're ever. I've never had it. Sea oyster sea sig is so good. It's so good. Is that good? Yeah. I like the sound. Yeah, I mean, can you imagine oysters like deep fried and then it has butter and the seasoning that they put in sea sig. And it's just... Ah, tofu sea sig is a thing. Yeah, tofu sea sig is a thing. You should have that. I would love it. You will enjoy it as well because it's still flavors of the same flavor profile you get with sea sig. With crispy fried tofu and then it pairs well with the grilled cheese and the onions. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's definitely good tofu. Is it true that sea sig originated in Bapbangra? Yes. Yes. Actually, the lady's name was Hanyu Se. I didn't know that. Do you know that? Yes, yes, yes. From where you grew up, you were born, yeah? Alright, guys, so you pair it with the... ...huto. Okay, I'm gonna have the panda because I love the panda on the top. I'm eating huto, not the bad word. But the bread. It's like cornbread, but I got the panda. Now, while this is a dessert, you can definitely eat it with a savory dish. Like a sea sig. I'm gonna try the... I'm gonna try the six-headed plain first. What is it? What is it? There is no one. Oh. This is so good. Okay, I'm gonna try it now with the six-headed huto. Let's try it out. He's better than I expected. Ah! That's so pretty good. I'm gonna top it off with san Miguel beer. Ah, that's a nice pairing right there. Nice pairing. Another winner. Good job, Kuyagean. Check this out. The six-fig. With the straw in it, the bowed by. This guy right here. Really, really. Really, really. Really, really. Six-figured lover. Wow, no, I don't know. You're like six-headed guy. That's so good. That's good. You're good. I hope, I hope, I hope. It's off the balloon. We go. See? Can you see the huge bucket of eggs? Oh my gosh. You guys, I see the bucket of eggs. I didn't realize it was gonna be like a bucket of eggs. Are you all ready to see this? No. So these are the three things that you generally see being sold by balloon vendors. You have the balloon itself, boiled quail eggs, and boiled peanuts. Now, you- No, you already had quail eggs. Now, you might be wondering why do some of them have markings and some of them don't? Now, the ones without markings, they are what we call pan-noi. They are unfertilized. Meaning, when you open it up, it looks just like a boiled egg. We don't want that. We want the one with a surprise inside. All right? So scientifically, to hatch a duck egg, it takes roughly 31 days, if I'm not mistaken. We cook it right around 14, 15, 16. Just at the middle ground. So, yeah, not too scary. Most of it will be egg yolk. It'll just look like egg yolk. All right. See me eat it first. Now, what you do is you find a nice warm one. Okay, not too warm, because it'll be too hot. You can't hold it. Now, generally, you're supposed to just feel and find which one is the lighter side. Meaning, that's the one with an air pocket. But if you don't- If you can't feel it, you can put it by the light, and you can find that air pocket. Can you see that over there? Oh, yeah. All right. Okay, so you get that. You can smack it on your head or on here. I'm not the hard-headed guy, so we'll have to use this. See? And then- And then you have a small film there. So, that is the balut. What you do first is you get a pinch of salt. You get a pinch of salt. Okay, there you go. And then, most people will put vinegar. I don't like vinegar in it. I just like it plain, like, with salt. And then, bottom soup. Like a doxoo. It tastes like chicken broth. Hear that? Okay. Next, you open it up again, just so you show up more of the balut itself. Now, I think you're brave enough so I can tell you the truth of it. As I'm peeling it, you can see this is mostly egg yolk. That's a baby duck. It stuck in between. Right? And then, more salt. Because I just like it with more salt. And then, just take a bite. More ducky. Yeah, that's part of the duck. And then, what's left is just a little bit more egg yolk. So, waste not one, not so let's have the egg yolk. And then, the egg white that's left. It's very hard. If you've ever tried chewing an aneryser before, that's what it feels like. So I don't suggest you eating the egg white inside. There's a bit of soup left, so, bon appetit. Okay, I made my decision. I'm not going to have a bite. I'm turning me. I'm turning me. No. Let me choose a nice one for you. Yes, yes. Wow. I can't believe we're doing it. Tell me about it. Right. You did it though. It tastes like chicken soup. But I feel like I feel weird about it. Wow, I guess you're eating a baby ducky. Yeah, I can taste the baby ducky and the chicken soup. Finish up the soup. Now, I'm going to take a bite and try to get him to take a bite. No, I can't do it. No. No, I can't do it. Oh, I'm not doing it. No, you have to do it. Are you sure? It's okay. Yeah, okay. Okay, take it on. Next time. You're so excited. It's kind of fun. Uh-oh. Okay, so now I eat the aneryser. Yep. And the egg yolk. For mostly the egg yolk. Right. Mmm. So you got the baby ducky hat. This is about a 15-day old baby ducky today. Yeah, it's so interesting. Yeah, baby ducky. Baby ducky right there, right? Mmm. Cut the juice all over me. How delicious. Yeah. That was so good, guys. Good job for doing the juice, at least. Now, the thing is, trying the juice, trying the soup, right? That's how Filipino kids learn to eat balut. Your dad would have balut and then you'd be too scared. That's the day he explains to you what it is. So for the soup, a couple of times it's just a soup. And then maybe after the seventh, sixth time, your braid event enough to try the actual ducky. So yeah, so good. When you're more than a coffee, give it a try. So yeah, I'll give you a pass. I'll give you a pass. All right. Hi, I'm John. You are definitely one of the best food tour guide we've ever had. Thank you very much. You're more than a food tour guide. A fan. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Amazing. Thank you so much.
