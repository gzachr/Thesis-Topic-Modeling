 Good morning guys welcome to another day of juice. We're just edging up and trying to upload the vlog this morning. Wi-Fi has been a little bit tricky on this road trip. We've been connecting to lots of different Wi-Fi network. Yes. We've been connecting to Wi-Fi connections in hotels, restaurants, cafes, hot spots, all sorts of different things. Which is why we have partnered up with ExpressVPN who are the sponsor of today's video. We've given us use of their VPN service to keep our data safe and they've also offered you guys three months free on their yearly plan. So if you guys don't know what a VPN is, there's quite a few different things that can help you, that can benefit you in different ways. So you've got things like security. They basically encrypt your internet data which means that if you're connecting in a cafe and someone's trying to get some of your information they won't be able to because of VPN blocks them. Something that works for us really well is that they also unblock certain things. So when we're traveling around some websites you can't access in different countries. We want to get to sometimes like Netflix doesn't work completely. So the news website, a few different ones we've gotten to do before and then you just click the little beat and you connect to it and then it's like oh it works. It's a one click thing. There's loads of countries you can choose from to connect to. So your computer thinks you're in that country. ExpressVPN actually has 94 different countries you can connect to. So this is a great way to keep your data safe online if you're doing sensitive work. It's to be honest if you're doing anything you don't have to snooping around on your network. There's even things like Facebook passwords. It doesn't have to be banned in detail. Obviously that's currently too. If we're doing some things on our spreadsheets and stuff or our figures and stuff like that we don't want people to be able to get access to. Click on the VPN. And Lucy and I only use other people's Wi-Fi at the moment because we're traveling. We're not using our own home network. We're always kind of vulnerable unless we're using the VPN. So if you're interested in this you can use our link here. It's in the description. Click the link. You can get three months free with a one-year package. And then offer that it's less than $7 a month with a 30-day money back guarantee. So if you guys click the link, get secure. Don't leave yourself vulnerable. Stop protecting your internet privacy. It's very very important this day now. You don't know who's snooping around. Morning guys. Well, we'll see you another daily Tuesday. We're just heading out now for breakfast. We've got a couple of bits to get to what it's saying in a little bit before we head out on the second leg of this road trip and we're heading south. Today we are going to Tagatai. Tagatai. We're saying something really cool tonight. We can't wait to show you that. Yeah, that's a good idea. Coffee and breakfast and get the taste off. I think Mike and I are also getting haircuts today because under this hat, under this very hat there is. There is a lot going on and it needs to be sorted. So Mike made a video about a barbershop. We're here already. Oh, we've walked right past it. Mike's probably like what you're doing. Mike made a video a little while ago about this cool barbershop in Central City more and we're going to head there off the breakfast I believe. Just sort out this mess. Oh, I need a coffee. I missed you. I missed you. Don't you find the morning coffee. The first morning coffee is the best one. The coffee is so good. We've gone for a lot of day. A double shot flat white blend. Cheers. Oh, yeah. Oh, that's very good. That is definitely my kind of coffee. Not thinking that. It's just not thinking that. The worst thing about leaving hotels is trying to pack these bags. The good thing is some of our clothes are in laundry now. So this should close easier. Change of plan. We don't have time for a haircut today. However, we have a big event to attend in about a week's time. So we're going to get hair cut for then fresh. So let's go. We seem to have a lot more stuff suddenly. We fill up every car. We left with four bags and now we've got like one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, seven, 14. Future us will sort this out. We are about to get this show on the road. We stopped off at Glory Atomall. It's very dark. We stopped off at Glory Atomall to get some provisions for the road and stuff we needed. And now we're getting a quick coffee stop. There's a toby to state hidden down this alley, which is kind of weird but kind of cool. Then we hit the road. We're off to Tagatai. Tagatai. Please let me know. Tagatai. Tagatai. Tagatai. Tagatai. Tagatai. Tagatai. Tagatai. Tagatai. Tagatai. Tagatai. Tagatai. Tagatai. Tagatai. Tagatai. Tagatai. All right guys. Last night was always how we pronounced that. For the turtle and his crystal, we think we'll get this one. We're just trying to find some reusable coffee cups. And these are good. We had a very good influence on you guys. He's a great even getting one reusable cups. Yeah. We drink so much coffee that we want to stop wasting these disposable cups every time we get coffee. We can buy these little ones to just reuse them. And they're nice and black. And it's got tables. They look cool. I'm definitely getting some food as well. Mike's also cleaning his camera so he can bring you guys sparkling clean vlogs. Yeah, this is another wrecking thing to do. Yeah, we're rather you than me buddy. It means we can reduce our waste means we can have coffee on the road. Taste just as good. Perfect. In the last days of love. This is so nice. We're just driving up now. Gain me some light and it's so nice. The sun's setting. There's just palm trees everywhere and these like big mountains and stuff. And where we're staying tonight has got a view of the towel. Is it a volcano? Yeah, it is a volcano. Towel volcano. But I honestly had no expectations for what the south would look like. And I know we're going to just go on a little bit south. We can still see Manila from this mountain more on now. But I don't know what I expected. But I don't know. This feels kind of, we were just saying with other palm trees and the winding roads. It feels kind of like an island that we've been to. Like, signal or something. And then with the mountains and stuff, it feels more like the north. Just managed to catch sunset on the drive through here. It was amazing. Wow. There's view. Both sides of the road we have sunset one side. And then the map. Wow, this is crazy. Look at this. Have a look. Wow. Look at that. Really nice. Really nice room. That view. You know, we can book a full of briefs. Look at this. It's going to be sweet, isn't it? Wow. With AC. That's crazy. Oh yeah. What a crazy view. Wow. There's a very good one. Amazing. Do you want to hear some good news? Yeah. How'd you feel about a massage later? Really? Yes. I actually love that. Mike, how would you feel about having a massage later? Oh, that would be so amazing. It's happening. I really, yeah. We need to tell them what time and it's happening. Oh, that is amazing. So good. It just changed my whole life. Your whole life. Thank you so much. Thank you. So nice here. I just can't get over that view. I'm going to wake up at the summer rides tomorrow just to take the summer rides over there. The summer rides from there. Could it set there? The summer rides at the east of recent, it's a little fun for a warm home. Ah, yes. Exactly what I said. It's so nice here, they say. I think the plan later, it's around this carrying like so much stuff. I think the plan later is to have a bonfire and have smores which is very exciting. Yeah, I used to be a do-go guide. I don't know if you have anything like that in Austria, like a little group, like scouts kind of thing. But the girl version. Yeah, yeah. I'm used to going on camps and have smores and it was very adorable. So yeah, that's a lot of my day. Have you had them before? I had them for a very first time in the US. Nice, that's so good. Yeah, I'm sorry, I think. I'm on TV. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was weird to have it, it's like actually. Yeah. In front of a bonfire. Amazing. Alright guys, it's the evening. It's quite hot here. It's a bit windy, it's more like vaguio kind of weather. It's a bit colder. I can't believe we drove like an hour and 20 minutes from Manila. And we're here. It's so different again. I mean it's pitch black behind us now. It's nighttime. We're heading out for a restaurant for some dinner. I think it might be. Can you guys see all these city lights? Here. These lights. We're going to explore more tomorrow. Actually, if you've been enjoying the adventure vlogs lately, the 4x4, the volcano, the hiking. We're hiking mountains. No, it's not a mountain of volcano. How long do you know? Tau, I do pronounce it like Tau or Tau. Yeah, we're going to see that tomorrow. Yeah, we did it there. And we just tried to go and then get both and then get back in the boat. So tomorrow's vlog is going to be full of adventure. I'm so excited. Photos are amazing. But first, let's get to the park. Driven out to a place now, recommended by Bob, our Volkswagen. Bag of beans. In Tagate City. We all need some food. Have we had three meals today? No, we've had one meal. One meal. I can't even remember. All these, when you daily vlog, it's crazy. All the days blend into one. You don't know when you're eating. You don't know when you're sleeping. When we're driving through the night. Everything blends into one. We're doing so many different locations all the time every day. It's kind of crazy, but it's a lot of fun. It's really nice. This place looks so nice. It's a bit in breakfast as well. It smells good. Hungry? Let's go. Bob's down. Bob, is that because of you? Yeah, maybe. All that style come from Bob. Well, that's the one you want to come here to try the Bob bread. Are they raw? Raw? Pork chops. They sound good. Marinette Pork chops are creamy perfect for Bob. Would this eat Bob? This menu looks amazing. They have chicken pie, steak pie. I haven't had pie in ages. We just saw someone's pasta which looked amazing. It all smells so good. It smells amazing. Guys, maybe because we're just so hungry. Maybe. It still smells good. It looks amazing. It smells amazing. It must be good. Carbonara. Claimful cheeseburger. Okay, I need to look at this. You're going to come. Do they have any Instagram? It's a good idea. And they do loads of coffee as well. There's beans everywhere. This is a bag of beans. What's that? All they have shakes as well. We were just saying we haven't had shakes in ages. I'm going to shake. Hi. How's it? Thank you. Marinette's mangoes? Did you go to the masher? Yes. Thank you. Oh, go ahead. Yeah. Nice. I guess not many things are coming out of you. Look at this. It's so pretty. Ah. That's not what I was talking about. Okay. Cheers guys. Cheers. I can't really, um, can you come to me? Yes. Cheers. Cheers. Thanks, guys. This looks so good. I've got the ribs, the mashed potatoes, and buttered vegetables. And then here's some chicken and mushroom pie that George and I share. Oh. Because we need pies. That looks so good. Eugella. Yes. Your food, MV. I also wish I ordered cheeseburger. Why? I might get it for dessert. That looks great. I'm about five feet in each breakfast. I don't know. The garlic bread. Oh, the garlic bread. Oh, I'm jealous now. Thank you, guys. I thought, hello. Oh, the garlic bread for a wrap. Oh, I'm curious to see. I know. Oh, I know. I'm curious to see. I'm full of the bread. So we're staying with eight sweets tonight. And they've kindly hooked us up with this room. And they've made a, like, a bonfire for us. And we've got the smalls there. I'm feeling so pretty burning me. And we've got the smalls to tell you so that it wants its calm down a little bit. So we nearly lost Woody to the fire because we left them on the table. And the other stuff was hitting him. The stuff the fire. Yeah, the embers were hitting Woody. Oh, Woody. Wow, look. It's really coming over. Everyone's getting burned. Woody would burn really well, but I just couldn't do that to Woody. Mellies are lighting assistants, even. You look like an... Really nice, right? What is that that has to lighten him? Is it not ET or is it ET? It is it. ET. It's that you like ET in a nice way. Yeah. Just need a bike? Oh, where were we? Head up. Yeah, yeah. And do this. Phone home. If you're on home, ET, ET. Oh, it's been a long day. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. My top tip, and what I have always done this, stick it into the fire. So you don't have to wait very long to eat it. That is just... So it's... It's burnt, but it's so wet inside. Yeah, perfect. It's so thin. It's not. But the black are the best, sir. No. Because it is crispy and you get the soft inside, and you get to eat it much quicker than if you have to wait and keep rotating it. I'm just going to put it back on fire now. More. But it's only done one side. Right in the flame. Right in the flame. Then it's on fire to leave it for a few seconds. Blow it out. And it's done. I'm not eating that. I'm eating that. It's well nice. I'm eating the mousseau. Oh, look at that. It's not that perfect. I'm going to dip it in chocolate now. Ready? Ready for the taste test. Is it going to be hot? That's okay. Perfect. So good. And it doesn't even taste bad. Alright. So good. And it doesn't even taste bad. So George, how do you feel about Takatai? I love it. It's really cool, isn't it? It's really. Yeah, I mean, really rough tonight. But already, it feels very different. I can't believe it's an hour away from Manila. It's crazy, isn't it? Hour and 20. Depends how fast you drive. Yeah. Yeah, I don't think the dog needs nice guys. Yeah, really nice. Again, it's completely different to anywhere we've seen before. Yeah. Maybe there's some similarities with the views. But it does feel different. It definitely feels different. Yeah. I agree. And I think what makes it different is that it feels like quite far away from staff. Although it feels like it's kind of very different to anywhere else. But then there's like the Yalamore here. There's like Starbucks everywhere. There's loads of shops like it. I expected it to be quite a quiet place. So. And it seems this place was highly recommended to do the volcano trip. And I figured it'd be kind of like St. Juliana that we went to. And that was kind of like a halfway point. Very small village with access to the tour. Because we didn't really set this place a tour before coming here. Which I like. I was really nicely surprised. Yeah, yeah. Me too. I don't like knowing too much like Vegan. We had the genuine reaction to that place. Because we didn't research it. We didn't know what to expect. You tell us to go somewhere and we go there. And then we figure out what it's like for us to have. So. Best way to do I think. I agree. Is it so nice and chill, doesn't it? Yeah. So nice. Should we end off the vlog here? Yeah. Cool. Thank you for watching today guys. Hope you are excited for tomorrow's video. Yeah, I'm so excited. We're very excited. We're so excited.
