 But you're Friday. The freshest. Oh my god, I'm so excited for this. This is the Niko busquad. Speaking in Spanish. And Alex, Ayuno, and they're doing it together in a freaking little and collab momental. Let's go, Chuck. It's cool. And then I'll let you know a bit as well behind the scenes. We're sure of it. We're sure of it. Okay, ready? Three, two. Ready? Yeah, let's do it. That's really me. That's last last. Can we? It's close. I remember watching his videos on the top. He's making a lot of... He's making a lot of... He's making a lot of... He's making a lot of projects now. He's Alex. Oh, they're so good. It's got some catchy vocals. He lost mixin'. She has doesn't he? It's got one that's... It's got one that's... Why is he so good? Why is he so good at pop? Like, this song's done sound good. Of course, the guitar stops. Like, how is he making this stuff sound great? It's both of them. How do they make him bang? Alex is a co-host. Alex is on another sleep. And then he goes a boss. Ah, by the way. They work so well together. Okay, so they're not with the podcast with him. Yes. Just this week? Yes. What do you call Sunday? Like, Sunday part of the new week or the week before? Well, in some calendar Sunday is the beginning of the week. But in some of the calendar Sunday is the end of the week. All right, well, Sunday, yeah. The podcast on Sunday, and I feel free to check out. He's a class actor. He gave a little insight of what it was like to work with Alex. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So actually, they were like, I mean, I don't want to spoil it. Just go watch it. It's nice and fun. It's fun stuff. Okay, so it's a release again new album. There are vocals on L.A.B. Smash so well. The way we're all doing it is so freaking well. I love the way life makes things as happening in the studio as well. Okay. I love the way life makes things as happening in the studio as well. No! I'm telling you, hopefully Pino's gonna speak Spanish. He's just not activated. You know what I mean? He's like a super power, that's dormant. He's got to go to settings. Yeah, then he's got to go to settings activated. And it's like an easy language for me. For me, it's like, I always do fucking impossible. Oh, dude, are you doing that? I freaking love that song. Keep going. I can put it again. I think I like the capella situation singing in Spanish. Like the whole rhythmical... Oh, that's one of my favorite songs ever. I remember. I remember. I was studying Spanish, not like... In Aiseka. Niki, niki, niki, jam. You got it. More than I needed to, but I did a Spanish literature. Whatever you call it. Whatever you call it. It was cool. I don't even know what I'm saying. Basically, just this song is to play a lot. And the people that were studying Spanish, and I was kinda like there just because I... Do you want it too? Yeah. Easy subject. Anyways. It's a hot girl. And yeah, but yeah, so that was sort of just there always. I also got... I had to do the test and stuff. And this song was playing the background, and it became a meme of the class. Because that was it. You know, one of the best ways to learn Spanish is... Any language. Like Reggaeton is really catchy. So you stop singing it along, and then also your pronunciation gets really good. It was a surprise me. Alex is actually not from South America. He's actually Somalian. I think he is, yes. So, yeah. Learning all this lyrics in Spanish wouldn't surprise me the fact that he can actually speak a bit. And he knew, yeah, make it on it. Because I want to speak to you in Spanish. Oh my God. And he said that he kinda learned a little bit back in school. I'm saying... I want him to make... Dude, I want him and like... Jay Balvin or someone like that. Or Bad Bunny. Someone like would be make good contrast to make a trend together. I would love to hear him sing. It's so... Like a Latino trap song. Rawa Alejandro, dude. Oh my God, yeah! Or so, dude. I'm totally free. I'm going to go to the studio. He told us I was checking out the studio. The studio. Check it out. Check it out. Oh, that's what he was saying. Oh, that's what you're fighting! Oh, he's fire! Oh, he's fire! Oh, bravo! Freaking! That's how you win all the demons right there! They both have got them all checked out! This is freaking amazing! I think in his new album, I think, I don't want to spill any beans or anything like that. But yeah, maybe there will be some Latino sounds and stuff like that. Who knows? I wanted to make Reggaeton. Me too. Like, this is just exactly what I was talking about when I heard his catching feelings on the wish bus. I was like, he just needs to drop like a Reggaeton song. And I love to hear you know, we know a lot of you guys speak Spanish and stuff like that. Yeah, like what do you think? It'll be awesome! Like, I just think everyone would agree. I think it'll be awesome to get like Spanish songs with him and stuff like that. But yeah, let us know what you think about it. And yeah, official merchandise is officially out. How many times can I say that word official? Forget it's boring. Apparently, you can be the new official again. Yeah, the link is in the description and there's worldwide shipping and it helps support podcasts and the channel. So do check it out. Bye.
