I don't think this is our room. I don't think this is our room. Hey everybody. So we are now in our hotel room. And this is after 26 hours, almost 26 hours since we left our Blueja Nigeria. We are now in Manila Philippines. Hello Manila. Hello Philippines. I get a lot of views from Philippines. You know, from what I see. I see comments from Filipinos and all of that. So if you're watching and you're from the Philippines, please drop a comment. Let me know you're here. You know, we could get to see and all of that. I'm here for the fun. I'm here for the culture. I'm here for the food. I'm here for the people. I'm here for everything. Right. So let me know if you're watching from the Philippines. All right. So let me just give you a little bit of what happened after we arrived at all. So we arrived. We got, you know, we changed dollars to pesos. That is a local currency. And then we got SIM cards as well. Then after that, we now made our way out of the airports to get a taxi down to the hotel. So we intended to use a grab. Grab is their own version of Uber. There's no Uber in the Philippines. What they use here is a grab, right? So we tried to get that. You know, I tried to get it on my phone. I downloaded it up and everything. And there were no rights available. I waited for, oh, I think like 20 minutes. We couldn't get it right. So we also have a grab stand right there at the airport. We walked up to them. And the grab stand told us that it's going to take over one hour before we get it right. So I don't know if it has to do with the time we arrived. This was around 9 p.m. Right? This was around 9 p.m. Is it? Yeah. Okay. My watch is still in Nigerian time. But on my phone, my phone is, you know, local time. So it was around 9 p.m. We're doing this. And this time it has to be for over one hour to get it right. So we had to like try others. So one fact, grab on the app was around 320 p.m. To our hotel. And then we saw, you know, those taxes that passed by the road, one told us 1,500 p.m. And other one told us 800 p.m. So at the taxi stands, because there are a lot of taxi stands right there, you know, outside the airport. So after grab the next one told us it was going to be 1,400 p.m. So that was like a process to grab. Grab was 320 p.m. And the one we used down to our hotel was 490 p.m. And we needed to pay 35 p.m. for two. So it all came down to 515 p.m. 525 p.m. Right? Am I getting it right? 525 p.m. From the airport down to our hotel, which is the airport. We are staying in Makati. The hotel is located in Makati. And it was just like 15 minutes right? Was it? Right? Okay, you can't hear me. Yeah, around 15 minutes was the right down here anyway. So we are now in Manila after 26 hours. So obviously we need to rest on all of that. So tomorrow we begin our adventures. Here in Manila Philippines. So be sure to subscribe, turn on the post notification bell. So you can be seeing our adventures here in the Philippines.
