 Hey good morning another day another dollar I'm gonna continue with the jambda and the world of the kapot and much more so let's get into it because I have this cafe in Going down to Robert's line to measure the fascia. Just to the same. Nothing fancy. It's only a fascia. Step down on this one. It's better the first one we did. So I need to do a bit of a correction on the old one here, the first one at the end. It's too thick here, it's not straight. Too thick here, too low here, so I need to correct it a bit. That's okay. Oh, I can come and bring us some drinks and merienda! Yeah, put it here. That's the only way. Bring the middle. Yep, very nice. Thank you so much. Bye-bye. Are you cooking something nice? I could smell nice this morning. Maybe. Oh, that was for the dog. Thank you. Bye-bye. The dog. So we're going to do the food that puppy there. Cooking BBQ. Really? Yeah. Oh my god, I can't. BBQ. Oh, yeah. You eat. Yeah, he's going to organize it to prepare for the fascia. I haven't bought it yet. I just had to give him this job because I'm behind on the go jam. So, while I finish that, I just have to prepare all around for the new fascia. So that's what's happening here. The dog. The dog. The dog. The dog. The dog. The dog. The dog. The dog. The dog. The dog. The dog. The dog. Okay, all done. You have to cut the lines now. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Next time, let's go. Oh, the run coming. There's a matter. We should go right. It's playing. Oh, you want to take it? Yeah, you take it. No problem. Yeah, of course. I'll tell you, take this one. Okay. No. Okay, use this one after if you need. You take another one. Yeah. The dog is going to run with his roof, so I'm giving him some towel. Until he gets it fixed. Okay. See you later. Sorry. Okay, let's go have lunch. This is one of my favorite dishes, fries with a running egg on top. And Jammas is not a beautiful pizza. Look at this. And we got some healthy fruits there. Castella apple. And this is one kind of watermelon. And some salad. Oh, we got this. Cheese. Lumpia. Cheese one. Very good. Okay, let's eat. I'm going to have some water. I'm going to have some water. I'm going to have some water. Got the kicker with his rod. And this is not finished. So the water is still coming here. Okay, we know that. That's okay. But we know what we need to do now. So that's not a big deal. We'll fix that. But we can't do anything in the water. Woo! I need to go to the house and bring some food. And I'm going to go away. I'm going to have some water. Close again. Close again. Okay, get in there. Guys, I'm going to get some drinking water. In the meantime, we have to stop installing the jambdo. Nothing wrong with the jambdo. The jambdo will sit on. It was all over the place. So I asked him to redo again. And then there will be much easier to install the jambdo and everything else. Yeah, you have to do just a couple of corrections there to get everything nice and straight. So we won't get that dough installed today on foot of the place. It's going to have to be sometime tomorrow, hopefully. Look at this weather. It was so bad before. And now it's another thunderstorm coming up. Crazy. Okay, I had the next suburb, but I'm going to just tell me. There's a thunderbolt hit some electrical installation. And the out of power now, we're okay. This is further away from the depolode. That's probably why the out and we're still okay. That's unfortunate, but those things happen. Something up before we go. At least we go one jambdo. Our position looks very good, pretty straight now. It's good. Okay, that's it for today. Now go away. Good morning. Jamb prepared her breakfast. We've got a mobile fish seller who drives past the house. So she got that. And from the garden. She got this beautiful vegetable and aromatic. Very nice. So what you're going to make like a... Tinola. Oh, very good. And I'm happy, my... This is crown. Okay, let you do that.
