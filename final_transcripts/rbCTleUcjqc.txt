 So hello, yeah, today we are in Glan that's southeast I think of Jansan, General Santos, one of the bigger cities on Mindanao, down south, middle of it, not in the super dangerous areas, it's just not really super dangerous but according to the state departments it is, we are at the horizon beach resort, we looked at several different ones, we were a little bit closer to where we are staying but they all want you to rent a cottage which apparently is quite common here, that people don't really go to the beach the way we might do in the west, they go to the beach to stay in the shade and party and eat and stuff so they stay in the shade rather than go out into the water and get some sun and stuff like that like we do, but this place was entry fee 100 pesos each, that's like two bucks and the cottage was a thousand so that would be 20 dollars and I assume you get it for the entire day but I'm not sure but regardless we weren't really interested, instead we found this nice little dunia, that shrubbery, a few trees to hide behind on the beach because the sun is very strong, we're using a spas 50, what it's called but still it's a very strong sun, but nice breeze from the ocean, Jensen is notorious for being extremely hot and it's also compared to here quite dirty or the the air is filled with the fumes and sand and dirt and it's not super nice and very hot city so, Belon is more of a Northern claims its province area although we're kind of close to the center of it so it's not that province, it's still city but few less traffic, wider streets actually at least one in Baguio and nice views, let's try to get the one really close to where we are, like palm trees, wide open area with palm trees and it looks really nice, some carabou and stuff, not just now we're at the beach but it's also very nice, I hope the camera can pick up the color of the water, it's not like what we've seen from other vloggers from Palawan but it's very blue and nice and calm, it's not definitely not surfing, not that I surf but it's definitely not for surfing, this is for chilling, some people are sitting more or less in their canoes and the water I think we have another video of that, there's some people walking around selling stuff so one with ice cream that was the only one potentially could be an interesting, the other one sell Filipino stuff, I guess usually some meat-based snack or something, we haven't tried it, we're just chilling at the beach, she went to get some chips because she wants to get some spicy fluffy pig skin thing, it's all for her, I like more water and some what she called plain or bland chips, so potato chips, nothing else, but yeah this is when we left Baguio it was, it was starting to turn, it was sunny most of the time or at least half of the time, meanwhile here it's sunny constantly and the no fog, it's quite nice, it's more vacationally which is kind of what I was looking for, but if you like me, I think going to Baguio is a good way to get flaminated or whatever it's called, to the Philippines, sorry, because I mean depending on when you go at least but when we got there it was June or we went to the Trinidad which is this small suburb slash city, just outside of Baguio and then we went to Baguio but it's June, July then it's mostly it's mostly grey skies, fog, rain, cold for her, it's quite nice for me to be honest, but going straight for example to Jensen which we did for the stay the month in Davao, it's hot, like insanely hot, so going to a place that's a little bit colder might be a good idea and then slowly go to the insanely hot places, just so you get used to it and now, oh there we go, I'm getting food for all of you, that's it, overdressed for the beach, all right we're gonna eat now
