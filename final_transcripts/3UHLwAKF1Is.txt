Lovely message. Very lovely. Wow. Very moving. Very powerful. Yeah. So, I saw a statement of an influenza here in the Philippines who said we should stop romanticizing the Filipino resilience. stop romanticizing the Filipino resilience and I think we should not stop because we all have been through something in our life. Either it's something that is considered, that has to do with our health, financial problems, losing your home like I did. And I think having a positive outlook and making the best out of the situation that is possible is something very, very powerful. Yeah, and I think it's just something that you should start. Being resilient and smiling doesn't mean you ignore what's happening, it means you keep a positive outlook on life and that never can be something negative. And there's also a saying that says the ones who smile the most have the biggest scars.
