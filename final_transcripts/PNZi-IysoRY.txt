 Oh look at that! Wow! It seems like they have a full entertainment area! Oh! That's so nice! What's up guys? Welcome to What's Up Philippines! Today we are coming from a rather new backdrop. Actually, you know, in the last video we had it already, but we have a little bit of a set up that makes this reaction video a little bit more comfortable for us to film. And hopefully a little bit more enjoyable for YouTube film. I'm talking about backdrops. Today we are reacting to Gabi Garcia's house tour. Gabi Garcia is a GMA actress, a Filipina actress, very, very beautiful what I saw in the first few seconds of the video. And yeah, this is a a house tour and that's all I can say right now. We haven't seen the video. By the way, yes, if you knew around here, Mike. I'm Lily. Our main YouTube channel is making it happen vlog with based, we've been based in Manila for the past year. We've been traveling through the Philippines for the past three years and don't plan on leaving anytime soon. And we are right now stuck at home because we're going to go to the Expendor! If you want to see some fun lifestyle food and travel vlogs and henover tour on main channel, which is linked right here. Alright, shall we? Shall we? Yes, I'm sorry. Okay, first of all, I'm super, super excited because I love interior design. So, I want to see home, I want to see how it looks like and how she decorated it. So, let's start. Let's start. Yes. Hey guys, welcome back to my YouTube channel. I'm so excited to do this vlog. It's the most beautiful vlog. Can I have a look at like Michelle? Yeah, it's my house tour. Okay. Whoa! Nice! Is that in San Lorenzo? I don't know. Oh, I'm actually nice with my house. Oh, the house tour. Okay. Okay, nice preview. We already saw a lot of things that we love. Bugs, guitars, plans. What else? I saw macramese, swords. Yeah, we love swords. Swords. Sorry. Like a pocket garden. Nice. My dad built like a mini parking area for my van. Over there, we have like a mini garden also as well. Okay, so now we are going to go in. So, this is the front gate leading to our garden. So, this is our garden. I often post this on my Instagram on Gali's vlog. So many things are tropical. Always the hour of a vertical garden. So before green, Shalap, there is a daddy. He's putting on things to the red, but he's putting on things. I like the red accent. He has the green thumbs in our family. I'm not sure about the names of the plants, but I know this is a snake plant. Yes! Mom, you need a pinnacle. And then also this is my favorite part. I don't know if I know. And we have like small trees here. Before we were planning to put a big tree here, it seems like when I come here, but then the grass is very strong. It's very nice. It's like a table. Okay, so now it's time to go. First impression is really, really good. It looks like a little oasis in the garden. So I really like that there's water in the background. Very greenery and very very zen. Yes! Inside my house. Welcome to Casa Lopez. Very nice. Look at the flowers. Dry flowers. Oh my god. I love the chairs. Okay, so when you enter my house, the first floor is very quiet. Oh yeah. So we have here this big chair. This was supposed to be a place in a walking closet. But in Indonesia, it's a passageway going to my closet. So we decided to put it here. This is custom made by Donor N'Avera. And these flowers are not real. Oh, they're fake. They look real. They're just looking at flowers, especially by my mom. We're such fans of dried flowers. Fresh flowers. But we know that we can't really maintain it when we have like fresh flowers here. So we just opted to like the... The bunch of flowers is bigger than piers. Yeah. So, oh yes. I got a nice flower delivery today. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Look about fresh flowers. And oh, it's was so good. I just wanted to brag with my flowers. I will link the company that sent me the flowers in the description down below. Did you see this? Yeah, it's a tie. Oh, it's beautiful. Oh, it's a separate house. This one I got from Instagram, I think. So why, yeah, no, we're a shell one. Shell two. Oh, so we're a shell. We have the house's barren tropical glam. Imagine they go to the church so we decided that the barrens is the largest space. I actually don't know. What if you're asking them? I got from this Instagram shop called Sunday Home, I think. It's also nice because it's part of the night. Bed night. Night bed. And you want it can be a night lamp there. So you're just gonna have to turn this on and then just... Cute. So nice. So this part, this is also my favorite. So as you can see, it's a white and gold video. Because we're going to have to go to the gold. Yeah, I love the gold details. All of these cabinets, it's just a cabinet. So it's not a big deal because that was our main problem. We stayed in the condo before. And we just need to have storage. So I told my end-tier designers to store them. Because they're collaborated with them. They're a base design house. A lot of storage air. Yeah, yeah. That is one of the disadvantages of living in a condo. You have to find storage space in hidden places. Yes. It's not so easy because if you put a lot of cupboards in, you lose a lot of square footage of enjoyable space. So you've got to be very smart at planning. We have luckily a maitreum, but we transferred it into an x-ray. Transformed it. And we have some extra storage space because we don't use it that much. Also, sometimes our guest bathroom. It becomes a storage. Guys, if you would like to see a house to an apartment here in Manila, please let us know in the comments down below. Yeah, I'm just waiting for a lampshade. And then we'll do the full roof. I just hear a lot of junk there. And this one was a good idea. I had it with me, never since. No cord to the ace but I'm glad. And we didn't want to get rid of it because it's just bamboo with the message that was for women. It's a Merry Christmas. What was the theme of the house? That was it to see shine. Cute. What was it? This is shine. I got this from Taiwan. They have 5 orange, they have certificates, diplomas, they have a display. I'm just saying this. So I'm saying this is the display. So I'm just feeling that we're not in the house. So it's here. Wow. There you go. And my, my sister. It's nice that it's, it's nice that everything is hidden because these are obviously pieces that they want to you know have around. It's like I saw some collectibles and a wall. So it's really nice to have those things in your home. But it can look distracting sometimes. Yeah. This is the jihad jihad. So this is the award section. Yeah. Let's move on to the dining area. Wow. Nice. I love the editing on this video. Yeah. Sure. I told my mom in that that I wanted the dining table, the dining area, and the sofa to be extra special because I feel like it's the main, the main parts of the life. So yeah. We, we've been putting the dining table and we got this from fashion and tear yours and they're super cool. I'm doing the stuff they love. I think like a few people only know it because it seems easy to bar. It's like they're so pretty, but their pieces are so nice. Green because we wanted to go for like a tropical glam kind of feel in their house. It's not too tropical and not too glam at the same time. Balance glam. And this one, this light is also from fashion and tear. Gendelang because it matches the wood here. This is by the way in the corn wood. Yeah. And there's always a little bit of that. Here we have our buffet table. That's what we didn't get it. There's something that we don't have. And my mom has like a little cut that you can push out and it's got like heating drawers. Yeah. I'm usually used for Christmas. Yeah, it's very flower. So you know, we use a lot of different flowers. And my special machine. Because I'm not like Ali who can like do all the police. In the pink that's not yogurt. I said I must press them like I did now. Good Englishman. We keep our planes here. So a very nice place. Nice and classic. Timeless. Because we like to go to the bathroom. So we have to do that. But yeah. She seems very nice. Yeah. Now she reminds me a lot of Michelle. I'm talking about Michelle, the old friend. I was like, what are you doing? I was just looking at the bathroom. But I was doing who suggested it. Because I love entertaining people. I love having my friends over. Kiyami, Bar Area, Taya. And this is so detailed. Wow. Even in the bedroom. It's in the curtains there. So it's so detailed. It looks like a real bar. So when you just look from what's behind her, it looks like it's a little real bar in her home, which is really cool. I don't know. We wanted to be like a bar. They're like a speakeasy bar. But when we have patients, we can just hire a bartender. That was the thing. They're in the friends' call. So we saw this nice, a previous vlog. We're in the moment. Oh, that is nice. Oh, we need one of those. It's so nice. My mother's story, my mother drinks, like this one. This one I got from my trip. Maybe some trip to Spain. San Río, because they love San Río. And then also this one I got during our anniversary. During our anniversary. Good choice. We tried that. Fair. The art team. Mike is getting it. It's a octin. It's craft spirits here from the Philippines. Hally, Hally recommended. They also have different ones. That's the one that we have. Focus, focus, camera, focus. Focus. No. Okay, this is the one. In any case. Really, really, really, really good stuff. And we did a video trying Philippine alcohol. Link, right? Yep. Totally worth it. Mike, totally worth it. And thumbs up for Mike's effort. For my friends. Oh, don't pop it wrong. So you haven't tried that video. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just got a memory. I'm worried. I'm so happy to see you. So this is like a music. Look at me. Mommy. Mommy made me. It's really nice from one of my guests. And every time we eat, they have a lot of mentors. I think it's a bit of a waste to see my house. But not really. But yeah, okay. I love my character also. I brought peace to much blessing. Why not? Moving on to the living area. Wow. Nice. So this is my living area. And starting with my plant area. Some of them didn't have a plant. But I'm still learning. Because they have a lot of plants. But anyway, yeah, these are my plants. Measure, they're not in good condition. Because if I just leave this, if I leave sunlight, I'll leave it in the middle of the park. Because it's not in the forest. It's really hard with plants. Sometimes, the onesons, sometimes they don't want sun, sometimes they want dry area. Then sometimes they want humid areas. And you never know what they like. But here's a fun fact. They have a logic to tap water. Here's a fun fact. Just in the living room where we are now, we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, seven, thirty, four, five, fifteen plants in the living room I love. I thought Nelly has a pillowcase addiction, but clearly she has a plant addiction. We need nature. I like it. It makes the place very, very cozy. So it's an addiction that I can deal with. Okay, cool. So they're not included. Oh, no. We have here are digital frames. Because we're not really... We don't have to be afraid of the photos that Nelly put in the hall. Really? Do you see our own way? Digital frames, you know. I really like to print some of our photos. Yes, same. Instead, I don't know, to like... I like the color. They have the recipe to make the treatise. Like a... It's like a... like a... And yes, so... How many areas do you see on my Instagram? This is our coffee table. We got it also in a passion year. It's marble. So imagine a big time. It's really, really nice. Good quality, right? And our TV or entertainment area and my favorite part are... Like in my sense. And I concept you very... It's a big room. The help of my mom. Depending on my bag, I have a bag of honey based or bag of dry flowers. Super cute. Like a... Noted. But it's a scene of... And they're in the lighting everywhere. It's really, really cool. Because it's just... dried notos. This one, the one, came from like a book. It's a book. It's... The dry book. And then that is a fake plant. If you have suggestions, guys, you can put it here. The planet one by coffee table box. Very staff for the judge. Good choice. We see the homing like a carupea, like Netflix. And we also have... RPS for you. Three things... Air. Okay, it seems like they have a full entertainment area for just the living space. So they have PlayStation, kind of a cinema like... Area, karaoke, Netflix, all of the things. So... Wow. So, I guess... And we have here... Alexa. Hello. We have Google. Happy Thursday. Okay, Google. Who is better? Alexa or Google? I couldn't compare myself to Alexa. We are assistants that just stick together. Oh, that's so nice! Okay, Google. Who is making it happen, vlog. Now let's continue watching. It's a vlog video. Let's do it. Okay, Google, stop. Maybe it's part of the... No, that's more like it. Maybe it couldn't be the area that it was made. I'm sure it was in Instagram. I love this area because of the base mainly. This is from Bondi Studios. So yeah, this is the body base in Morena because I'm... Wow. And then... This mirror, I don't know where my mom got it from, but it's really, really nice. And so good. Nice statement, please. And this all, guys, believe it or not, my dad came home with this thing. I don't even know where you got it from, but... It's very nice. It's really cool. And this is for me to the powder. Good job, dad. This is something that I realized here in the Philippines. The guest. toilet slash bathroom is called powder room. All right. We call it poop house. Oh my gosh. Oh my god. Okay, I just wanted to say that there's a difference. And we didn't really figure out why it's called, you know, differently. I think it's just... So you don't have to say poop house. Okay, told you. Or toilet. So you can say I'm going to the powder room. I'm going to... Let's walk paper I got from wall crown. Actually, all of the wall papers here in our house are from wall crown. My dad installed a urinal here. Because all the girls are going to be with me. They're just like that. So when I was in prison, I had girls. So, I met a concho, and even it comes to planiness of the bathroom. I think everybody should be like that. So we installed a urinal so that the boys would see that. And then you can continue toilet. It is more hygienic. Yeah. So we're going to put in the toilet. In this area, it's full of gold. This one we made before. Wow. Actually, most of the carpentry the girls would do it. They would put in the hot, they would put in the supervice. Then they would put in the cold. So, designs of free-latures, we would put in the air. It's a shame that we don't have the air. Even if we're going to the house. I love the powder room. That's a fake. It's really nice. And we have also a mini shine that you're here. Blossom, the clover. Yeah, I think if she wouldn't say, this is a fake file. Nobody would know it. It's so good. No, but you have, I think you have to put fake flowers into the bathroom because our bathroom does not have any sunlight. So I don't know if any plant would survive. Survive the... Maybe the snake plant. The sun for sure doesn't shine in the air. Our ceiling. Guys, I'm in Lamyan. So I'm very much in the walking closet. So, aside from the mind, we have to make use of it. So that decided to put it here. It's about you. To make it more posh. Basically, we're having a very nice ceiling. The guest is going to the bathroom. It has not very soft light as well in the bathroom. Yeah. We have a second floor. Everywhere, it's very soft light. No, no, no, no. Or it's a different area. The second floor. So our room is here. It's a ground floor, which is, I think, more convenient. Convenient. Which I think is more convenient. In case you're hungry, or you want a midnight snack, or you want to cook. It's a very convenient convenience of the food. But yeah, it's more convenient than I thought. For my mom and dad. But it's just a very nice place. But it's just a place. So originally, this French door, what was it like? It's just an open area, street to the dining area. Not a lot of the food. But since this is a very bright area, it's a private space. That decided to install a French door, which is a very nice place. Because it's a very nice place to stay. So our room is very nice. So private space is very nice. But it just looks so classy as well. It's a very nice living here also. And for the very walls, we're planning to put like a photo wall. So we're planning to fill this up with like, pictures, games, different travels. Not made, or like, important people in their lives. So yeah, we're just standing up. That's very cool. We're living here, having things there. So it's like a memory lane call. So my sister has this memory wall of pictures, random pictures that she took printed out, and just stick to the wall. And it's so cool to just enter her room and see everybody's faces and memories that come along with these pictures. So I think that's a great idea. We were going to have a pop-up red course. The lockdown, the lockdown, the air. So, Syrenta, we were going to have a... Sobram began to guys. It's like angel wings. The ghost is from passionate figures. We love the details. Sobram detailed it on a piece set of... Yeah, last year, the night. It's so detailed. And it's just a really nice accent with a hallway. It's not too loud, and it's also not so bare. That's what I was going to say. It doesn't make it so to well. Peace, fun, holy. And it's angel wings. Merendink, you know, merendink, coming down the... It looked... It looked so nice when she was standing in the front. Yeah. And you could see the angel wings behind her, and it looked like she has the wings on. So that's... So, I've committed a piece. This is repatriate. Yeah, that. And guys, I'm supposed to hurry the staff here. This is my sword in Angandadia. So I'm supposed to go here. Oh, cool. But, well, what a... How does it look? It's not the only one here, so it's just here for the new time. But yeah, this is my sword for Angandadia. I'll go up before the show ended, but I'll make a piece here. What's your signature move? It's my signature move. Oh, that's it. Good. I've already left here. That's where the angel wings are. Maybe she's out of practice. Oh, look about it. What's your signature move, folks? Let me do it. My signature move? Ah, I'm going to do it with my pose. Oh? Oh? Insert photo. So guys, it's the breakfast now, but... Views to be the breakfast now. Because there are a lot of lockdowns and I opened a music school just like the temple primo. So, if you want me to do a drum set from this school and you're placed here for her online classes, by the way, guys, if you want to enroll, please do it. Wow, cool. It's very thin here. Anyway, May Studio commissata us, which you will be seeing later. But then the Wi-Fi is really weak upstairs. So we need to relax so let's do conference now with the student. So we just converted this to like an online class room. Let's tell you this is like a breakfast. No, it's supposed to be a breakfast. So we have fake gas here. TV speakers and my ex-dad too, my ex-dad. Then we have seats, and we're planning to put them in the bag. It's like a house where my friends and I can play board games, can play just dance, morning and night. But yeah, they want room. And we have a few kids and teens and my sister's notes for their online classes. So back here is the laundry area and like a pocket garden. This is our pocket garden and our gigantic tom-k. Oh, be there. Because it's a dead dead bone. I don't know what I'm doing. But I'm okay. So maybe got the house and just a shot. You know, you just need to use it. And you just need to put the bag in the bag. But you need to put it in the bag. And here we have... I couldn't understand it, but I think it's good that they have their own tank just in case. There's a water shortage or anything. Definitely. I think we would do the same. Oh yeah. If we would have a house someday, subscribe so we can hopefully make it happen someday. It was very, very, keeper, you know, storage for Christmas, Christmas walks. And over there, your washing machine dryer. And that... You toss it. Didn't look that big from the outside. On the other side, maybe you'll find your and your stock. Oh! Wow. So welcome to my dad's man cave. This is his personal space. Dad, we're going to see. Oh! He has three bikes. And we're going to buy a bed. It's a super bike. See, the X10RR. That's a high price. The X10RR. And then this one... It's both 1000 CC. But he called me the... Oh! Oh! So, I'm going to buy a bed. I'm going to buy a bed. I'm going to buy a bed. It's a super bike. See, the X10RR. Because it's a naked bike. Yeah, it's the same. Yeah, it's the same. I think that's a good idea. It's a good idea. Yeah, and then that small bike over there. My toy. And my monkey. Monkey bike. Yeah, they're really cool. Honda monkey. Yeah. Yeah. Very popular bike. In Berlin for many decades. Oh, that's cool. What is that? It's a... Pressurized aid. And then, then, then, by... It's really a space. That was... If you see here, that detail is around his monkey. The screen... The picture of the monkey, guys. And here, that... My please. The train train, guys. The monkey, you can see it. Yeah, that's it. This one, the navigator, remote control, the monkey, before me, or still kids, I can remember. But this one... The public is just in the name. This one, this is the monkey, guys. Wow. I think this is the first time you've ever met a monkey from the living room. And then, if you see there, you can see it. Okay, I didn't understand the part with the... Army suit. So maybe... It's just a mannequin. Oh, it's not like a real... I don't get so... It's not his uniform, what I think. I don't think so. I don't know. I didn't understand it. Let us know in the comments down below and we'd really love to have an event. I'm sure we could... give it a play back and try on this stuff. Jump up, hardly. Not for an expert. Are you in Tinen? And then, guys, it's a secret passion to that. Right? There's a... Ladder, Jans. Yeah. I'm moving up. So what's your favorite bike, though? This one. This one. We'll have a make-up bike. It's more awkward. This one, this one is a bit... The passion goes... But it has more polka-point. Oh, because polka-point is the... So when you go up there, it's his man-gave for boys for me. So, may Ladder Jans ride back. We don't usually go up there, because it's so hard to go up. All right? Oh, wow. That's cool. I like that. Okay. This is my special... Oh, look at that. Wow. This is the biggest adipo. These are my riding gears. They're there. Cool. Nice. This is my electric drum set. And then, Papaturo, all the other things. And then... And then, that's my collection of airsoft guns. Okay. We're going to have a new job. A new car. A summer. We don't know about this. It's so fun. Yeah, that's very unique. I got this phone. God is a fan. I don't know what I should do. I'm going to see him. So that he can see the lights. I don't know if he's here. It's like... I don't know so far. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I don't know. I have this door. I can accommodate two, three persons. Right. All right. Thanks, Tika. It's like... I know. A fireman's... Ladder. It's a very good use of space. Just having some extra rooms. Yeah. Absolutely. I agree. Good night, cameraman. Go. Bye-bye. So behind me is the kitchen door. But as of now, guys, I don't know if I'm going to go to the kitchen. I'm going to renovate. Mom and dad will renovate it. With the guest room right beside it. So for the future vlogs, the kitchen door. Anyway, we're going to go up to the second floor now. And then your music studio downstairs. Well, now I'm in with my parents. Oh, that was all the ground level. And my one-plus-end. Let's go. It looked like... What can I also say? I think I was like two hundred and fifty square meters away. Actually, I'm reading Moon Dynamite and I'm sister. When you're in the second floor, it consists of her music studio and my walking closet. And this is the... passage area. Hide stays. It made a bowl. The steepest. The steepest stays like that. You might want to put the bowl upstairs. Okay. Oh, yeah. I think we read that she's a singer too, right? I'll read. Yeah, she might be. I mean, make sense. Yeah. So, my guitar name is different. It's a standard Korean and a classical. Her door is just plain white. Mine. Has like... The wheels of gold. And then it has a... So more art than that. Okay, let's go. What's up? Wow. So this is the music studio of my sister. She's just a kid. Okay. Okay. Hey! Okay, so as you can see, it's kind of a small space, but it offers to you. So, I'm going to the door. I'm going to the music studio. I'm going to the music studio. We can follow Temple Primo in Instagram. Temple Primo Academy. We also have Facebook. Facebook and Instagram. Temple Primo Academy. Oh, you're Instagram. Oh, cool. Temple Instagram. Take it out. Alexie and Zee. JVG. Paul Shahzik. JVG. Which is your favorite guitar of all time? Actually, I guess. I don't know what it is. It's the same year. 2011. Our family is in the box of us in like guitars. Please. It's a bug-sash in the language. So at the end, one, two, and three. That was it. That's 2011. Yeah. And then followed by an acoustic, like two acoustic guitars. This one. This one and this one. Actually, because the one guitar was a classical guitar. So I was just playing with it. But it was hard because it was very hard. So that bought this guitar. So this is the first guitar I played with. It was very explored. And then, It's a shame that you have that. It's the same guitar. It's a different color. It's a different color. It's a different color. But it's a different guitar. By the way. Yes. And self thought. I was just playing guitar. In high school, the jamming, jamming, my favorite. I was playing it sometimes. And he's saying, when he reaches 100k on Instagram, he will play a Filipino song on the guitar and sing to it. Exactly. In Tagalog. So I had an overture making it happen. Vlogging it. Follow me. Private message. Say hi. Yes. Come on. So after none, 2015, 2016, they gave me a gap in the whole family. My new guitar, little Martin, and that's the best friend to ever stand. Dread, you know, in the early part of the band, the LSS. That's the reason that I got it because it's a cary in the audience. So I got it. Dread, and a drum set. Dread was also a gift to make a company. Good drum set. Pretty good. Along with my symbols, my meal, HCS. And a fun fact, like drums didn't show in high school. Because they don't have a choice. Because I was the drummer of the band. So I had to take over since I was the drummer in the middle of the night, and I was like, what do you do in the end? I'm just like, you know, you know. You know, you know, you know. To help her out. So this is a telecaster square. So, Pansha, recently, I just explored electric guitar. I didn't want to play guitar. I played everything. Stab us. This is not bad. We have two of them. Alex and Nareem, we do a lot of stuff. They're covers songs of guitar and violin. Wow. In basketball checker. Yeah. This is the recent night-a, we released. This is the editing. Late last year, I was able to enter the music production. So, I got this stuff so I got an interface, a mini keyboard, speakers, and yeah. Oh, that stuff is so expensive. Like, and then, yes, last year again, I was able to enter the bass of the Daikas and Bongo Pops. That's why they're there. Oh, you know, drums. Oh, you know, I know drums. Oh, you know, you know. Oh, you know. Wow. That's such a good song. Wow. Malek, Malek. Gapat, Anor, Malik, Ola, Asabit. But, anyway, movie suggestion, if you are really into drums or music in general, we're plar. Mm-hmm. Doble app. By the way, I've had a few first one at all. Yeah, I've had a funny day like, three buttons we need to press on this keyboard for all our reaction videos, for like such a long time, and then they still forget which buttons to press. No, I'm just, it's so complicated with my, stop, my computer is broken. This whole thing does not work, so we need to save up for your computer. So, please subscribe, so I don't have to press other buttons to just continue playing. I need to put my pads, so, I don't know what to do, I don't know. Are all from the go-al.
