So, supposedly, there's 17,000 population here, which got told this morning, but this airport is, I've never seen an airport like this ever in my life. It's almost more like a gift shop. Oh, I've got a gift shop. Like a garden. Yeah, there's like a nice little ass. They've got their welcome. Nice. My can only stay in the different hotel guys just so you know, they booked a little bit before us and when we went to book ours, all the rooms have sold out, so we're in a different place. They've got their pick up. I think our hotel's like four or five minutes away from each other. Look, there's a little goldfish pond. Everyone's just chilling. No idea where we get our luggage, but I'm sure we'll find out. Interesting development, trying to get out of the airport. No luggage. The plane left without a ton of people's luggage. We've got one of two suitcases. Luckily, I've got clothes, Lucy can wear my t-shirt. We have our toiletries. Nellin Mike's sadly don't have any of their bags and they've just been told. It was a weight restriction on the aircraft, which seems weird. Like, I don't know why they would take off without everyone's luggage. Everyone's paid for luggage. There's only a certain number of people on the plane. You'd think they'd be able to work that out. They just told us the luggage is coming on the same flight tomorrow morning. And we'll be delivered to our hotel. We're being given a thousand pesos of compensation per bag. To go and buy some clothes and stuff. So, there's quite a lot of angry people here to be honest with you right now. But one of those things, one of those things that happens, you've got to navigate these situations. We have a ride. Alright, let's go. Alright guys, little update for you. Please excuse how I look. I've just woken up from an hour's nap because we needed to quickly get a bit of sleep in before we go and explore. Because we kind of, I don't know if you guys know the feeling, when you're so tired you feel a little bit sick. Because you're like lacking so in sleep. You must have had like two hours sleep last night. Because we couldn't sleep for a little while. But feeling much better now after a quick nap. Also just finished editing up the vlog. And we're going to start the uploading. Hopefully we'll soon as soon as it's explored. We'll start uploading. And fingers crossed. The Wi-Fi's quick enough on our smart sims or on the globe. We'll try both out. See which one works best. But I really hope that the video will be on tonight. We've got one o'clock now. So we'll call quite a few hours until we should be publishing. It should be fine. It should be fine. Let me quickly show you around more staying as well. So we're staying somewhere that's kind of, if you imagine this is a town. This is the airport. I say the town. Basko is the name of the place. It's very small still. There's a few restaurants, a few hotels. It's not really like a town. I'd say it's a little village. That's just here. The airport's here and my canal is staying kind of near that. And then we're staying the other side of the town. Which makes it sound like we're really far away from each other. It's actually a 14 minute walk. So that shows you the scale of how big this place is. If there's a point right at the other side of the island, you can go to an motorcycle, 30 minute trip. So it's quite a small place to get around. We're just trying to actually sort out a way of getting a scooter to hire while we're here. Finn message me earlier saying it's 1,500 pesos per day. Which is the most expensive I've seen anywhere in the Philippines. I'd say average is like 300 to 600 I paid before per day. So it's kind of pricey but she's trying to see. I said if you've got any scooter rental and she was like, hmm, I actually didn't quite understand. And then she said, oh, I didn't like the one but it's really far away. But I don't know, I'm not too sure because when I Google scooter rental, press search and it threw me to Taiwan. That is the closest place to rent a scooter from here. So I don't think we're making any trips to Taiwan today to get a scooter. But hopefully they can sort us out. Otherwise we can use tricycles and stuff while we're here to go and explore. The other place we're staying in, it's very basic. It's just literally on a normal residential street. Just like a little house. It looks like any other house and you've got a few rooms that you can stay in. So I'd say it's more like a guest house. When we got here, George got some food and the lady just basically made him a breakfast so it's like you're staying at someone's house. I'm not actually a hotel if I may say so it was really nice. Very simple, double bed, air conditioning and a fan which is good because it's super hot. I've turned the aircon off to film this clip. It's so noisy and I'm already getting hot again. And yeah, I'll just show you around quick. Like we said yesterday's video, my cannelli booked a bit more of a nicer place. I don't know if it's like three star places got a customning pool and stuff. It's really nice to be photos. But when we went to look at our accommodation, that place is already booked up. I've had quite a few others but we said it's all good. We'll save money and this is like a third of the price which is really good for what you're getting as well. And we get breakfast here every day so it's good. So just got a little sofa bed thing down here, one suitcase area. The bed just here, aircon unit, fan, mirror, wardrobe and then just a toilet in here. So it's all good. It's got everything we need. And then we're going to just freshen up quick and then head out for some lunch and see what this place is about. But we're picking a very bad time of day to go because it's now super super hot. But I think the average temperature right now is about 25 degrees. So it's much cooler than Minilla. It should be nice. This is a place where staying tiny little house, amazing view of the mountain there with the cloud coming over it. Lighthouse over here which we will definitely explore at some point either today or tomorrow. But for now we need lunch. Someone has a view of the sun now. No luggage means I'm now wearing George shirts when I get sunburn because I was only wearing a little top before. But bike, all sorts of things. Beautiful isn't it? Negotiations skills intact. It was a really nice guy so we didn't push too hard. We got him down like 100 pace as of today. He said, well this is what it was like. Alright, we're in a really nice place for lunch. Octagon, amazing view of the sea. We're so happy to be so excited. Literally that little drive there. We were just smiling the whole way weren't we? So amazing. Sadly this place is closed for lunch but we might come back for dinner because it's a really nice spot right on the sea. We're getting our first taste here. What all the fuss is about here. What we've seen photos of, videos of, absolutely stunning. People in the sea look. It's so cool. Yeah, there's people in the sea. Oh my god. Green hills, the lighthouse over there which is very well known. You see it in all the photos. So it's so happy to be here. I was just saying to myself, I was about to say saying to Lucy. Definitely wasn't. We're saying to myself. Really good to be in like a really laid back place again after a week in Manila. We love Manila but it's nice to, it's like you come here and there's no worries. It's so peaceful. It's going to eat nice food and drive around. Really, really happy to be here. Special special place. I'm going to be in the next place. I'm going to be in the next place. Since you came back. Back to your back and played your cards. I've been running from my... Guys, we've just driven up here. Look at this view. We weren't even expecting this. We're just trying to find some food. I am blown away, officially. You can see from the point we're at now, if we turn around in a second, you can see the other part of the island from here. And this side at the same time. This is so peaceful up here as well. But there is a bit of a big cloud coming. Wow, just look at this place. We knew it would be stunning but I don't think we were quite ready for this. Hello. See the clouds coming over the mountain. We've gained quite a lot of height in a few days. We've been looking at the clouds. We've been looking at the clouds. We've been looking at the clouds. We've been looking at the clouds. We've been looking at the clouds. We've gained quite a lot of height in a short period of time. But look at this. Welcome to the terrace. Crazy, crazy, absolutely insane. We've been looking at the clouds. We've been looking at the clouds. We've been looking at the clouds. We've been looking at the clouds. We've been looking at the clouds.

We've been looking at the clouds. We've been looking at the clouds. We've been looking at the clouds. We've been looking at the clouds. We've come to Cafe 2 Con now. It was one of the best rated places on the island. When we loads out, we were like... That's the shame it's so far away. I don't know if we can make it there today, but it was like 12 minutes drive, including stopping through the midst of GrandFates days, so we're all good. We've come to Cafe 2 Con now.
