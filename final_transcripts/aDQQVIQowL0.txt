 phone. What? Is it because the battery is very low? No, it's not. Or how are you going to do a lot of things? It's a battery is low. No, it's okay. It's not low. It's just having a, you know, what is not that problem. So what's next? See when? You should be the lie. But I'm not getting a live singing. Yeah, two, three, two, three. I think we're live now because we got viewers. You got viewers? Yes, but I'm not live. Yeah, what? My one's still live. You're live. Sorry, our one viewer, but what have been problems? You got one viewer? You've got live. This is the first one that we've done a sweet dream. That's okay. If it's only one channel, this is annoying. I'm hearing a voice and I've got that nice delay. What? Yeah, but not on my channel. Not on your channel? Not on my channel. Yeah. So let's just keep going. Let's keep going. We can do. Yes, welcome to a foreigner in the Philippines. Yeah, so this is between a foreigner in the Philippines and a half of a century. That's right. I'm controlling it. See I can go full screen. See full screen? That's me. Hi. We're not as a British. We say, even we're not in the moment. Yeah, so that's right. So yeah, you're right now. We get four viewers out there. Four viewers. Yay. Oh, it helps to look right. I'm live. I'm live. I think we're also a couple of minutes late, aren't we? That's why you keep another window. So we are live on the border and in the Philippines and also the harvest is ready at the same time. So welcome everybody. Steven, Steven, I could tell you a voice and I couldn't see your mouth moving. Bit of a trickles of them. Yes. That was a one-hour present on our present technical control. I like and say is all I can admit is it's a good thing we're not packing. That is true. I will give you that. Explain a live stream. So what are you saying? Yeah, we're trying to work out the live stream. And we got Steven and Hong Kong and we're in the book. That's right. It's like we're listening to our own efforts. So seven. Seven viewers out there. We got seven viewers with with a great sense of humor. So I would be looking at the OB's and then just screen so you don't get confused. Hello. On the live. Okay, well, the the picture will have to take care of itself. Welcome to live chat. And I'm Red Rose. Hello, Red Rose. Are you making any sense of this at all? You know, you can pop up the chat. My channel. I found an inability and the harvest is really the harvest really. Yes. This is a bright and error on our live stream. We thought we would try one with with with Steven should explain that Steven is. Yeah, it is actually connected to the UK and to New Zealand, which I'm not connected to New Zealand other than with friends. The UK. Yes. But seven is from Hong Kong. Actually, I'll tell you we always call Steven Steven from Hong Kong. Did you know that? Yes. I know that well. That was about your designation. So, can everybody hear both of us? Yeah, so eight viewers out there give us a likes on the live stream. So if one of you, if one of you eight could, uh, could answer that question of Stevens, can you hear both of us both Beth and I? And Steven actually. Actually, even with my message that makes three, doesn't it? And you hear us all. Imagine imagine that the technology right Steven and then in the back of Steven is the. The two three or three before the red shot right? Yeah, it works. You see? That's the red shot. Yes. How come I thought this was in present time? The power of technology. I'm really behind you. Turn around. I see. Can anybody here, Steven as well as Beth and I? See. Can you hear both of us or both sides? No, we're not getting any response on this. Come on. Everybody. We want to know if we can hear both of us. Or seven or seven concurrent viewers. Somebody speak up and help us out. Let me check. Hope you don't get some. We can speak. Hope you don't get what? Right. We're good now with a great sense of humor. Hello? We picked up another three. Out of those three, can you say? Yeah, it's working. It's working. It's working. Okay. Yes, it was. Yes. Echo. Well, that was good. My voice was in an echo chip. I'm going to tell you the difficulties that we're working on. I've got one earphone of a pet of earphones. And Beth is just trying to hear. I think it's a bit of a switch void between one ear and another. As many people have said about me. Yeah, from. Was she going to hear any of the voices? We got to hear anything from echo. Yes, I can hear you all, but Steven sounds like he is in an echo chip. It's even much better than that. We thought it was. Echo, echo, echo, echo. I think the viewers out there give us a light. The same time you have some topic that you want to discuss on this. For a livestream. We're Steven and I'm still with us and Steven. Just comment on the comment sections and at the same time it's an open discussion. What we want to discuss and at the same time. More on relationship. It would be not for another relationship or anything under the sun. I'm the other guy. My name is Steve. Every time I talk, I've got to take my head for an hour. I an error livestream. It's the first time. We didn't know how it works. From says door to door, you can hear your friends Steven. I wonder for this. Live. What do you do better if we just take the picture out altogether and just talk. That sound only. At least we wouldn't have that. Okay. Can I have a little. I can can fit this. Can you hear me now? No. Right. Can you hear me? Hello. Hello. Yes. And yet we're getting more people who are listening. I guess it's. Yeah. They're called in the headlights. It's the holiday. Watching three people struggle. You chat rate is only two. Yes. Nobody's going to step into this. So. Anybody else. Anybody else have a comment? Good evening. Host. Very close. He's from so. Yeah. Thank you for giving us a thumbs up at the same time. To all viewers out there that watching our videos. Don't forget. And don't escape or advertisement. That's where we let's be helped us. That's where we let us. Yeah. So. And. And then a success. If you have some suggestions or you have some topic. If you want to discuss on this live stream. Just comment out there. We. Okay. You were. We were going to suggest that. I never. Never ending. Endingly interesting. Topic full for most that listen. And watch our videos. And the one of the things that we have in common with Stephen. Is.

Yeah. Yeah. That's when we got 26 viewers out. Yeah. On out 10, 20 and in. Yeah. We got a good signal here. So red rose. It's a familiar. That's a familiar name. We're not the red rose that has a construction company. Yeah. Anyway, Mr. S. First time seeing this live blog here in the show. You stay or Missouri on a coldly assignment. I wish the Philippines would open up. Oh boy. So do we. We've been in Panglao today, which used to be. Well, we are in Panglao right now. And it used to be such a vibrant, alive place. And we're going through now. And it's. It's very sad actually. Very sad to see even the hotel that we're staying at. Is a wonderful place. You must have seen what you possibly have seen pictures. That we put on Facebook. Okay. It's such a fabulous place. Perch right on the edge of the cliff. Okay. Very nice rooms. And. It's only got two places have been. Okay. So. Hi, bad. I'm telling you, give me a part of the partner. I wish we had some. I've just looked in the drawer. I'm aware out of stock. Sorry. We can't do it. I watch for interest. You're. Rainy weather. Last week. That system. Stretch from Philippines. The West Coast. Canada. We got. So. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm. I'm here. I'm. I'm here. I'm here. Come on. Can you well. Can everybody hear Steven? Yeah. Think they can. Anybody got a question for. Yeah. Yeah. Now are we in present time? I don't think so. Present time. I'm waving my hand and it's not showing. It's like a little delay. What a great deal. All right, let's see. What's the other one? You ran and Cham a lot like love. And Cham a lot like love. Hi, Beth and Terrence from Thailand, you too are my Filipino girlfriend. You too are my Filipino girlfriend. Then I real life heroes. Thank you very much. I take that very seriously. Although I will fact check it, of course. Although I started differs, we laugh at your last cry at your sorrows and sweat your struggles. Oh, bro, that must be making you strong, but we don't regret anything. Yeah, if you have some questions of Stephen, just comment and tell answer you very, actually, so and cherry. Are you so funny, Teddy? I'm not going to get my day. Okay, Sherry. Yeah, yeah. Can you hear me? Yes, we can. Yeah, Texas coming soon to be with you. I hope so. Make sure you've got all your paperwork. Yes. You have some questions to see then. You asked you comment and hell answer you. Red Rose, I am connected with your channel already. Red Rose, Rose, I know that you are. Your name is very familiar. There is one other rose that is something to do with a construction company, isn't there? What's it all just said, Teddy? Yes. Amy. Amy. So does anybody have any questions for Stephen? And why is your channel called the father says ready? Okay, why is my why is my channel called the harvester's red? I have to take the headphone out because I hear myself. The harvester's red is because I'm focusing on the channel's focusing on how churches with their media, especially in the times of COVID where churches may not be out of me. I mean in person. So I've got a lot of technical videos that help you set up your live streaming. Like this is a new experience that I've done here. I've used a program called OBS Ninja so that we can talk with Terence and Beth and connect our cameras together without any logos, without any cost either or anything like that. So yeah. So have a look if you need any help with your live streaming for your churches or anything like that. There's a lot of videos to help with that. Okay. Well, hopefully in Stephen's defense, we have to say that we are working with very poor equipment here. We've got a laptop which is several years old that has already taken two test flights from the desk because Beth left the emotional edge on the cat decided that it looked like it was safe to jump on. And the other thing is we're working with this business at this place for professional bloggers. Look at this. Can you see this? Look. Okay. I've got a half an earplug. Half an earplug. So as I said, we got 41 tours out there. We asked a little bit of energy for you. And often discussions. You want to ask. Is an often, often discussions. So you're from it out there. If you have some questions, some suggestions, then a topic. Then. Mm hmm. Thank you. That's the light. Because the light is only out of simplicity. Yeah. I don't think both of you. It was your helping poor people. God bless. And protect. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. I don't think both of you. Thank you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. There's a bid me to go immodelateler of the other phone to have a jacket. The quadrator. The monitor. Let us into the secret. Please. What is it about this jacket? Every forever. Hello, everyone. What would you suggest a ring with me to the Philippines that I can have get there? Thank you. No, it's not. Thank you. chocolate. No, what is talking is about this group of things what you're going to bring. You know what family is going to bring. I wouldn't bring. Well, it depends. Chocolate, surprisingly chocolate is a serious thing. Chocolate and all your, let me see, all your electrical things, would you say? I tell you one thing you need to bring. And that's your ATM card. You said, seriously, you need to set up your account so that when you, so that they know you're coming here and they want freak out and close your account, you see somebody trying to get cash from an ATM in the high street in Taliban or wherever you stay to set foot. So that's important. A nice, a nice, brand-new ATM card that won't crap out on you and a little cash. We've dropped everything else to see. Okay. Back to what you are trying to do there, Stephen. Right. I think the ECA is better now. Okay. Right. Stephen. Yes. Are you full time in the Philippines? No, but it is my goal. I do desire to be there in the Philippines full time. And part of this media ministry that I'm doing is part of what I'm planning along with some educational things as well. But yeah, not right now. I'm still based in Hong Kong. And I would love to get to the Philippines as soon as I can. And we will be there. Actually, we will be there to meet him at the airport with a pair of handcuffs. And he will be changed to pick up truck because we need this help when he gets here. So we'll be taking prisoners when he gets here. Isn't that what Stephen? This is my response. Well, you just found out the press. I mean, Yes, I have control of the cameras. You're taking yourself out of the picture. There's our pair. We re-read red truck. You know, it's just lying there at the moment, like in a truck graveyard. So let's get to more questions. How many people have we got? We got 48 people now. What's the matter with you? You can have some fight for them and make sure. Yeah, I'm deep voice like eggs, you know, and if you're not subscribed yet, subscribe to our channel. The heart and Stephen's channel, the harvest is really on the foreigner in the Philippines. At the same time, if you're watching our videos to do this day for advertising, I need to chill my husband. Where is it? Why is it you're not being shown in the camera? That's in charge of. Why is it not? This is getting harder and harder. This, you know, what we did is we filed the pillow. Right. So we could able to work it out. Because there's nothing will here. If you could see how technical we are, we've got a table that we we've pirated from outside the hotel room on a patio. So the table is one of those, those knitted things. Not knitted woven. Those basket weave type tables. And on that we put a pillow. And on top of that, we've got balanced, very precariously, the laptop. Yeah, from here from garbage. The utterance will you be restoring your beat value bug? BW bug. What's BW bug? BW bug. BW bug. BW bug. BW bug. Yeah. Terrence, maybe restoring your, you know, I would like to, but I got so many other things and trying to restore myself, you know, I made T1. But that's not working up so well. I'll just keep getting older. At some point, yes, we will. Because Bert loves that BW. You know, when we drove that, it actually looked beautiful, but we left it parked and kids played on it and people kept chickens in it without our permission. And so it doesn't look quite so beautiful anymore. But kids use the staff. Still, he's the kids use the stand at the side of the road and wave to us. When we drove past in that and call it the bow bow, which means Tertel. Tertel. It means Tertel. So yes, we will be doing that. So, Elffretch, I'm sending four Ballet Bayern boxes ahead of my arrival with all the good design might need. Is that a good idea? It depends. Can we talk again about chocolate? No. It is. I think it's always bring chocolate. Yeah. You know, there is a webber that you look at his questions. Okay. Yeah. You know, that's against your rules. Chocolate is the currency. No, it's a good idea. This is what I suggest. You need to send them so that you know that they'll be arriving just after you do. So, in other words, it's going to take six to eight weeks to get the Ballet Bayern box here. Now, try to make it so that you are on hand to pick them up. Because like we did, we had a friend who sent many boxes, but he got one of them, developed to the shipping company. And unfortunately, put his own name as the sender. And we thought that the box would have sold us, and we opened some of the other boxes. And we couldn't understand why anybody had sent a loan or... It was very embarrassing when we just go with our mistake. Let's go around trying to get it back all the things that you just think about. So, perhaps come on. Is it fine? It's fine. Yeah. Of course, third of all. I just think it's been the end. What? Hi. So, yeah. What are you doing? Yeah. Hello, hello, Philippines and hello world. Don't ask the moderator and host will be if they want you to be the moderator of your channel. How is the Philippines nowadays? Well, our part of the Philippines is really quite laid back, but the businesses are going down. In the places where foreigners, tourists, where they're perilous to the pandemic, which is where we are now in Banglao, it's the furry story. It's very sad. That's right, Stephen. That's okay. Can you hear me? I'm from Hong Kong, Stephen. Yes. Good. I fixed the echo. Found it. That's good. How is Hong Kong? Hong Kong is, well, it's really funny. If you look at the statistics, we've only really been through three waves of COVID, right? But the authorities will say four. So at the moment, things are pretty well, I wouldn't say normal, but there's like a new normal. Oh, God, that phrase. You're right. New normal. So freaky, right? The new normal phrase. Basically, for me, I've lost about 30, 40% of my income as a result of different activities closing because I'm my primary income sources, a teacher here in Hong Kong. So the moment there are no schools operating in Hong Kong, I say that loosely. I see that loosely, because what's happening at the moment is that we're doing Zoom classes, and primary six students, and the last year of secondary students can still come into school for examinations and work and stuff. Basically, there's only restaurants are only open in the daytime, they're closed at nights, tables and restaurants are limited to 50% capacity, and only two at each table. But trains, buses and everything else are normal, or beaches are closed. So... Doesn't it crazy at the bus stop? At the bus stop, you have a special distancing, and then when they get a next assembly. We don't have the social distancing at bus stops in Hong Kong, which I think is thankful. But we do follow everyone in Hong Kong wears a mask, absolutely. And I think that's why Hong Kong has got a pretty good control of what's happening in that sense. We're having about 50 or 60 cases a day on average, and we're running at about 700 cases active. But that's I think that's part... When you spend the world... Sorry? How you spend the world health organization? How you've seen that the World Health Organization has now suggested that the... I believe it's vibrations. Ibrations which they record when they do the test vibrations, but cycles or something like that. And they've suggested that they've been using on the test, they've been using a measure that's too high, that they should bring that down because they've been using a sensitivity which is so high, that it will record anything that's on there, and then they put that down to Covid. So that's many people. A lot of false positives, right? Yes. Yes. Because I think you know we've had some discussions about the different things that have gone on in the past regards to this and the vaccines and things like this, but I'm very much the middle of the road guy. Like I just... I look at the numbers, I don't really look at the media and what the media reports are saying. What's happening in society? What's happening? And when I see an extra lockdown, when cases are dropping each day and that, if cases are going down each day and I'm going... I'm going... That doesn't make sense, right? Or the rationale, why the rationale or why they say, we've got to do this. Or like, oh, the biggest thing was they made a... One person made a mandate. We need to make sure all Filipina helpers are kept at home because it's a risk to get Covid 19. But the problem with that is that how many cases... How many Filipina helpers have had Covid 19 in Hong Kong? And what percentage of that, you know, you want to... What I'm saying, they don't look at the percentages overall. A group of people gathered together doesn't mean that they're all going to get Covid 19, right? Yeah. So if you say, let's... This discriminated against this group because they always gather together on Sundays. But there's no evidence of rampant contagion between that group. You're discriminating based on race, nothing more, nothing less, right? And there's a lot of that being going on at the moment where they're just making rash decisions not based on anything foundational, right? If there's a group of people that were catching it all the time, then of course you're going to say, those guys can't meet anymore. Because they're spreading the disease, right? But if there's no evidence for it, leave them alone. Well, they're very little evidence for the way that they've attacked this. Yes. Because I've Denmark, haven't had lockdowns, haven't had social distancing, haven't even been wearing masks, and they've been dropping like flies. But I've... didn't they close their borders? I don't know. Yeah. I've seen that part of it. Yeah. They're not the only sort of done that. Yeah. And so it's a never ending discussion. Let me just read it. We lose it all together. I have to understand you from my point of view. I'm very echoing. The bless you, Beth, and Terence, for being good Samaritans. Always there in times of people dating help. We do try and it's becoming more. Terence, you are so lucky with Beth because she is not a social climber. You love to help poor people in your areas. And so you have both a good heart, good bless you. Don't realize just how much Beth is prepared to help. I do. Sometimes I go and get... I get a clean pair of socks and she's given them away to somebody. I'm not going to wear my t-shirt. I'm going to wear my t-shirt. Every time I go to these guys is place. They're busy from morning to night. I'm happy to meet you. I'm Beth and Terence. You are good to them, Abit. Thank you. We got two chalk and it was. I was just saying I was just following on to what Terence said at that same time, which was to say... Every time I've gone there, they've always been working from dawn to dusk and even later. Every day you're out doing something, helping some family, getting someone to one place or another or anything like that. They're continually in the community and the local community just being that help and that need. And it's... You're just a blessing to that community. It's so incredible. You know, how do that is almost selfish because the way that we... The way that we feel it's just the fact, we certainly don't know that it's not just the Bible that says to give is more blessed than to receive. We don't find that. We get an incredible return. Spiritualing. We get an... I don't mean that we believe that we're blessed and all in that particular way. I just mean that we do believe that having found to this degree the lady is correct, what she just said, but because we are both united in the mission of trying to help, we are brought together more strong than ever. Right. Yes. So, what's the point of being... Are you going to fake the image? American... Oh, sorry. Are you going to take the American vaccine? Absolutely not. I'm not doing that. Elon Musk said he was tested twice in one day. He was positive in one test, and negative in the other. And I believe that that's the way that it's better to give enough now on trying to... That's not... No. I got the uniform in one ear, and we were relying on the side on the sound, traveling right through because it's very... As you do. It goes from one ear and the other, right? All the way through. Yeah, let's get it through. Come on, come on, get it there. Hey, there's a kiss from Italy. Thank you so much. We'll buy the Chinese vaccine for what it's people. How can those of us in America help the people there? Well, if you could just sort things out in America, it would be the enormous... and the enormous benefit to the entire world. They're going on in America right now, especially Turkey. They're not going to... It's as my mother used to say, but if I was arguing with my brother, she would come in and say, stop that, it'll end in tears. This will end in tears. And that will be something that you can do. Do you know, you have to come to the Philippines to try to help someone? Yes. You have to do this girl and help somebody. And sometimes that can be as simple as doing what the lady did in the restaurant. The lady... A lady in her 40s, something like that, was in a restaurant and she was... she was having lunch alone. And she looked over at another table and it had an elderly person there who was dining alone. And on the spur of a moment, she went over and she said to the lady, I'm... I see that you're dining alone. Would you mind if I join you? And your lady was very, very grateful for that. And they had lunch together. And from that came a friendship for that old lady and the younger woman. And they had lunch often together. You can do something like that. And it's very, very... So anyway, if people just listen to your... people just listen to your bodies and take care of yourself. You're an advice. You're very smooth. Yeah, that... Basically, I know you may not agree with this, but honestly, the problem with mask wearing is that everybody needs to do it. If someone doesn't, it defeats the purpose. Because masks don't protect you, they protect everybody else. So yeah, keep your social distancing. Wash your hands. Just do the basic hygiene. Yeah. Sorry, have I lost track? Have I done that one? Yeah. But anyway, I'm getting distracted. I've got messages coming on on other phones and stuff. My lovely... My lovely, my lovely face saying, where are you? And she says, hello. Yeah. Let's say hello back again. Yeah. You're just agreeing with me. If we were face to face, I would kill you. Exactly. You know, we'll be on the street. We'll be rolling on the floor. And... And everyone will be saying, what are you doing with that old man? Yeah. Because I'm skinny when you're not. You're... No. But anyway, I'm gonna go and bake food and pantry. Yeah. And some... Sun Chi... Sun Chi. Good evening everybody from Naden, Samar Philippines. Ah, somebody actually from Philippines. Hi, Beth and Terence, and your friend Steven too. This is good. This is good. You're going live. Yeah, away. Bless the thought. Amen. Yes, trouble. Amen. But just... I know you're McKenzie. Yes. Don't you mean McKenzie? One of the most popular places to retire in. Almost in the world, I think. It's nothing so. Very... Two. Yes, it is actually. Certainly in the Philippines, it's the... The primary place. Because... The infrastructure has been... made so far and friendly that you can go there and you can live in the... Philippines. Ah, just had something... I can't get it to close, honey. And you close that? Yeah. Hit it harder! Hit it harder! Oh, man. Is anyone set back, but it's not a touch screen. To hell with you. Are you tapping the screen, trying to close it? I know. Yeah. It's not working! I couldn't have stood up when his still didn't work. Anyway, let me go say in Italian. Well, yes. What else can I say? Take you, Sir Terence. And Cooke and Banks said, thank you. I remember my Italian terms from when I was a musician. Things like Eccale Rendo and Domenio Indo and Crescendo. And that's about it. Conversationally, I'm a dead man. Yeah. So, Eccale, some experts are now trained to push people to wear two masks. What? That's no point. No point whatsoever. Get person to just wear one mask to start off with. You know, come on. People are not even doing that. One mask sometimes hard to breathe with. I couldn't even imagine too. Well, Oh, no. Maybe you should look at there is a hidden agenda. It's trying to kill you. So, health spread on 76 years old Jada Meechai, I made T1. And I've lived in Southeast Asia for 22 years. Oh my gosh. The people of the Philippines are number one in all areas. I believe that that's true. Yeah. David, I know that you're in Hong Kong. But when we had our trip to Hong Kong, it was so different. Yeah. And when we came home, I said to best, you know, we should make sure that we recommend. If anybody tells us they're going on a double trip to Hong Kong and the Philippines, they must go to Hong Kong. Yes, absolutely. Because if they go to the Philippines, the Philippines will completely ruin them. Absolutely. They're going in. You know, remember when I came over to do the solar panel, the solar panel project, right? And I was just told you, it was so flabbergasted because I go into a shot. And I said, I need this particular switch. I was looking for a switchboard for electricity or something like that, accordingly. Something very, very strange, a little bit unique, right? And the guy that lady says, I talked to her boss, says, I'm not going to, it talks in Filipino, of course. This is the boss tell to take him to my competition to find what he needs. So, you know, of course, they're going to be first to sell you what they have first. But if they don't have it, they have no qualms about getting someone else in the neighborhood, the business, right? It's like, and it's just a really community spirit, right? Of course, they're going to, they're going to, if they have it, they're going to sell it to you first. But if they don't have it, they're going to go out of the way to help you find what you need. And it's just an incredible community spirit that the Philippines has. They'll just go out of, you know, they'll go out of the way to help you. You know, they expect you to buy from them first. But, you know, they'll take you to where you need to get the stuff done. So, yeah, incredible. Yeah, yeah. I know, I often hear them accuse the world kinds of things. And I never find that. Maybe there's an urge for it, which I can't remember what that word is. But there's a thing, a word that describes reverse paranoia. Let's define paranoia. I'm thinking everything will go wrong and everybody will try to do you in. And reverse paranoia is when you go out thinking that everybody is going to be nice to you. Yeah. And the first paranoia is what I experience. I mean, people who are the poorest of the poor, and they've been totally honest with me. You know, to such a degree that it's almost embarrassing. Mm-hmm. I've frozen, I think. Yeah. Yeah, I'll fix myself up. I'll fix myself up, don't worry. I had to do it. You've been caught with your mouth open, Steven. That's right. I always get caught in some weird expression when Beth does these thumbnails. So you always look at your own. Hey, I'm back now. Oh, okay. No, I'm not. I just, I did something stupid. I did something silly. So, first and then, the best thing in my community, God will give you good health. I, that, I do hope that that's true. And I am pretty healthy. Yeah. I'm feeding up. You can hear my bones creaking from about 10 to a way. But apart from that, it's not still bad. So, one congressman wants to make people to take the vaccine to be able to get a stimulus check.

So, in spite of the primitive tread flinstone setup that we... Keep it going, keep it going, keep it going. I must go, but... In fact, Stephen is is, is, is, is really technical. It's only me that is, uh, is, um, backward in coming forward. But I think the next time it will be a lot quicker, right? Next time we... I think so, yes. Because now that you know, we defined all the keys and everything you want to do and connect. Yeah, and I've got this set it up. I've got the sound now set it up properly. Because this is the first time I've done anything like this as well myself using this program. So, it worked really well. I should have tried to have a conversation. The sound is different by about 30 seconds. Well, you should be in the picture. This is why I encourage you to use the phone. Then you just use the phone and use the computer for your comments and stuff, right? Yeah. I should be. Right? Okay. Then, then you have a proper conversation. Well, yeah. Well, it's not my fault. It's never... Anyway, sir. When it comes to this conversation, I'm democratic. I'm a democratic when it comes to this. Just showing your colors, your red. You're going to the red, right? Yeah. Yeah. You're done. Are you coming in on this for just a few moments? Yeah, we should be finishing up soon. I need to... Starting to line on the bed and doing absolutely nothing. I'm getting called away. I'm getting called away. Okay, well, if you like, you may leave. Get the hell out of here and I will continue reading your books. I'll put your full screen. I'll meet myself and you can keep it going and you can just end when you're finished, okay? And the next time, if you could, please... Get it right. I'll give you one more money. Yes, absolutely. I'll give you a hundred percent refund of what you paid me. I hope so. Yes. I didn't... I didn't see anything. Well, I'm only bit back anyway. Okay. You will talk again, sir. Yes. Okay, I'll keep this connection open for you and then you can go from there, okay? I know. Okay. See you. Stephen. Stephen. Yes. Just a bit. I suggest cleaner glasses. I can hardly see your eyes.

We'll go forward to it. Yes, absolutely. Okay. Thank you for watching. Tadda for now. All right. All right. Happy new year. It's just funny. This is funny, I'll be this. Okay. Get me back. All right. I'm full screen. What does he want to say? Hello, everyone here. Ah, still. Ah, my name is Irish. Cook the bake is just a channel I made up a few weeks ago for entertainment while we are still in lockdown here in Milan. Actually, I got a confession to make. I'm brighter than I look. I knew that it wasn't really. Can we get full sound now? Yeah, I think so. What is that? Where Stephen looks? Well, I'm going to be here. I'm still watching. I have to get back to to fade. Ah, okay. Hello. All right. Are we? Are we going to have full sound now? We're working on this now. Yeah, we can. I'm best at it back and she knows everything. Yeah, you don't need that. So, now I don't need. You don't need this. Okay. Yeah, so. Yeah. Ah, we're not going to have. We're not going to have any sound then. Yes, no, we don't need sound. Do we? So we take the sound? Yeah, I take that out. Yes, and you know, there's I guess why I didn't come because I look at that. She's been. This one. I think, yeah, this one was our. I think you're right there. The dog gets this one. Right. Got that. Is that one? Why do we put up with that? Why do we put up with that dog? Look at these glasses. Look. I'm a professional, God say. Look at it. I mean, then go back little. You see that little thing there that's supposed to stop you from getting an injury on your nose. Like this one. This is terrible. Anyway, I don't need the glasses now. Oh, yes, I do. Yeah, you mean. Yes, I do. Where do I know from? So. Where do I know? I entertain you. You may lock down where we are. Here in Milan. Congratulations. Well, congratulations on being Irish. That's the main thing. So I have to, if you're Irish, it depends. I'm not sure how well. Let me tell them an Irish show coming. Ah. That Irish jokes are all the thing in the UK. But the funniest Irish show that I ever heard was told to me by an Irishman. By the way, I am an Irishman twice removed on the generations. And my parents were first generation Irish. So that there's two Irish there. A pair of twins in Ireland. One of them dies identical twins. One of them dies and they're having the wake. And as is their way, the dead, the dead one is lying in state in the parlour. And they're having a party awake in the rest of the house. Well, one of the visiting relatives was a distant uncle. And he comes in and he has to see the deceased. So the other two, the surviving twin takes them in there. And they're standing there and they're looking down at the dead twin. And the uncle suddenly says to the surviving twin, was it you or the other one that died? You notice the way you talk is delayed. Yes, darling. Did you think that voice that was incredibly fine? You could tell this woman the funniest joke and at the end of it, you say, was it you or the other one that died? And she looks at you with a totally straight face and says, and what happened then? But really, I know, I'm looking to see. Let me check. Let me correct the, let me check. Down is good. Let me check. And? No, I'm trying to work it out the delay of the sounds. Okay. What help people what we're doing? Yeah. And then they're more...
