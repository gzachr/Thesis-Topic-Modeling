It shows you even more of this massive city. So much has changed. Yeah. The buildings have been built. There's less cranes in this one already. It looks like. Yeah. Maybe the cranes were done doing their cranes. They lifted everything and they just collapsed. You know that's how they get rid of cranes. They don't just... Oh. What are they? Other buildings though. Sometimes it does but you're just like that. They just drop it on the street. So they need a new crane to repair the other buildings. Yeah. Then they have to get another crane built another crane up to get that crane out. Oh my gosh. It's really efficient. Let's get right into this. If you enjoy, subscribe. Like the video.

Those buildings are very futuristic looking. Great. Great. Oh no. Wow this area is very fancy. There's that dome thing. Oh it's going. Jeez. So where are we going to be staying when we're here? Right next to that crane. Oh I want to stay in the unfinished building. Let's just stay in Jolaby Tower. Yes. That's where it looks like a hotel there. Ooh. Yeah it looks like there's some like pools on top. Jolaby Tower that's where we're staying. Union Bank. There's just a golden tower in the middle. It's a jump tower. Jump tower. Was it? No. Oh I was like what? Philippines wouldn't do that. No. They have Jolaby to do. Okay if you walk in a Jolaby Tower do they give you free mangopies? They better. And then the Jolaby mascot just in there. Hi. Hi. Ooh. Those are very uh cylinder like. I don't know what the cylinder like. It's spherical. What a cylinder one. It's cylindrical. It's the cylindrical? Ew that sounds weird. I don't like that. Jeez. What was Cargis doing? I don't know. They just have like uh european style church right there. Yeah. You don't get the docs over there. Oh that's it that's where they perform. That's where we're 19 for four. We reacted to that before we're over there. Oh it might not be up by now but in the we have reacted to that video. It's going to be good. Yeah it's coming soon. Yeah. At least set in that video that we are going to re-enact the SB19 dance right in that exact spot. We're going to go and we're going to do that. We're going to do it. Mark our words right now. So many collars. Yeah. Very colorful buildings. I'm going to find a... Jeez. Oh that big boy. Big boy towers. McDonald's! Oh wow! Dude that was going to be one. What is... Wonder what different stuff they have in Filipino McDonald's. Oh my god that's sharp. There you think. At least I knew York or something like that. It's so many. Whoa. Get some nighttime shots here. We're going to see some people in doing their private business. We're just sassing them down the toilet. That would be kind of awkward. Yeah. Sorry dude. Innovation in their privacy. It would be. You're just sitting on your pooper and a drone just. Jeez. So many things being built. It's crazy. Yeah. Such a fast-running city. Yeah. I mean if we go to like miniapolis our main city where we live there's not really any towers being built from in our like lifetime. No. Yeah. Jeez. That looks fake. Doesn't it look like an animation at that angle? Back to get that. Yeah. It's like, oh my. They just have these neighborhoods in the middle. Wow. It looks like so many different styles too. It looks like kind of like American style buildings and then like Asian like South Korea Japan style buildings. Yeah. There's some that are like they're like all glass and then some of the like colorful ones. Then ones like this. Yeah. The white. Yeah. I feel like I'm watching like a battle with this music on. It's like building up. They're about to charge at each other right now. Oh my gosh. Jeez. Doesn't seem like it's a very walkable city just based on how big it is. It seems like it's so spread out. Yeah. I can probably areas that are walkable. Yeah. You can't walk at the whole city. Oh yeah. That big. It's like central park of Manila. is 144. finish higher. Cheaters. for של while Was that a cemetery? I think it was. So, whatever it's like a soldier cemetery, yeah, it must be. Looks very similar to the United States Cemetery in my D.C. The soldier was. I wonder if it... She just constantly did go down forever. Really showing this. I wonder, is this for Filipino soldiers? I know in the United States or during World War II, they have this in Italy too. They have United States soldier cemeteries that look exactly like this in the countries where soldiers die. So I wonder if that's one of these or the Philippines just kind of do the similar aesthetic to it. Because I know they fought in the Philippines or in World War II. And those crosses are really the... Because aren't the US ones just the half circle type things? I don't know, I think they do have cross. I'm not sure. But you've seen that style before. Yeah, yeah, I've seen that. There's a lot of helicopters. There are a lot of helicopters. She's so many cranes. You were completely wrong on the crane. What? I was like a casino, that really pointy one. I don't know why, but it's HKTV. I was saying, evil villains later. The HKTV one? Yeah, he would light up that night red and he'd go, I don't think I'm picking up your foot in that. What? Pick it up! No, yeah, okay, now I get it. I just want to go inside of Jolaby Tower. Do they have tours in Jolaby Tower? Are they better? SB19 should tour us through Jolaby Tower. It's getting intense again. There he is. I print the middle. Oh, that little like, lock way. Yeah, he's just watching. Whoa, look at it. There are some crazy ones like that in my California. That we even know. Oh, wow, it's like stack stack. Oh, I don't think it did light up red. Whoa! Go back to that, you know. That's so crazy, he's. So much, that city is alive and very dark. Sitting on a never sleep set isn't New York. It's Manila. Manila Vanilla. I'm curious what that cemetery is. American? It is American cemetery, I thought so. All right, that was cool. Yeah, wow. A bit more high quality too. Definitely, that was definitely a superior version. It just showed you more of the city. But we got both, we got the like, a little while ago, what it looked like, and then what it looks like now. Not even that long after, but still how much has like, The other is quite a bit of a change. Yeah, it's pretty cool. That was just the colors of the city is so cool. The buildings, the architecture, that is like so many different styles, I feel like. Yeah, I feel like it would be worth, like, say, to someone like, Oh, this is what the Filipinos, or like, if you were to ask someone what the Manila skyline would look like, I don't think that's what they think. No, they didn't know much about the Philippines. Yeah, that's a really incredible skyline. But more Philippine stuff. Because we just need to keep feeding our hunger until we can finally go there. Still, I don't know when that's going to be. Oh, my stomach is rumbling, do you hear it? You need some a dough ball, here you go. Um, and here's some ballute. Why do you not go home? That's how you eat ballute. Just swallow the duck thing whole. Yeah. Then start chopping other eggs. Something a little baby chicken would come into your mouth. Or duck. But thanks for watching. Hopefully you enjoyed subscribing if you did, like the video if you did, and we'll see you in the next one. Bye!
