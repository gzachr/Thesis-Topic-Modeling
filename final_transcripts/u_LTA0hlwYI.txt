Super close. It's so nice. I have a brother. We used to almost kill each other. I mean, we used to kill each other. Oh you did? We always wanted to kill each other. I think that's normal. That's normal thing, but you're still close. Your public appearance began with voice kids, right? Yeah. How's your 12 years old? Wow! How was the experience? It's funny. I'm actually hearing my dad. That's my dad, by the way. Really? The boy guy. Way back then, he wasn't like a really big fan of the music thing. Because like, he was in a band back in college. But it was my grand mother who really pushed me into joining competitions. I remember in the voice kids in particular, there was like thousands of addition in his career there. For like, I think the addition started around 2 a.m. 2 a.m.? Yeah, 2 a.m. The gates opened around 4, I think 5. And then we ended around 12 a.m. But you guys were kids though. We're into tired. It's okay. We were kids, so we didn't really. Yeah, you're excited also about what you're doing. And then the whole voice kids, do you remember how long was that? Just a few months, maybe. With like the additions outside of the blind additions. I got into blind additions, did the battles, and then basically got eliminated after. Were you hurt? Yeah, obviously. Like, she reduced her arm. I was like 12. I was like, I was like, I'm so big. I felt like I basically just finished my whole music dream. Really? Because of that. I was crying. Oh my god. I remember like after getting eliminated. I was in the corner of a busy being. Look at that time. Now I was just crying. What? Yeah, I'm like, that was like, we should go to the after party. I was like, I don't think I can. I'm like, we just find home again. Oh my god. So you really wanted to really last. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But it's okay because few years later, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I also did K-pop thing, right? And then I was 13 when I first joined the industry. Yeah, yeah. And then I quit school with everything. Did you also have to quit school? Not really. I just, I just stopped school a few years ago when like the whole music thing got picked. I was in first year college. You still went to college? Yeah, I went to college. I tried to, but I didn't work out. That's amazing. What course? I took up communications. It's mask communication. And then it was just too much. Yeah, which is a bit too much but the schedule and stuff. Because I want to go to college too. Yeah. But I haven't. I don't want to go back as well. You want to go back as well? Yeah, I want to go back. One day. One day. Yeah, one day. Okay. Let's eat first. So you graduated high school and then you still went to college but you stopped in the middle. Yeah, it stopped. That was like during the pandemic as well. Yeah, so like everything was online. It was really good. Hard. Actually, because you're zero one, the same as me. I know when we just graduated, right? Right. Pandemic. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What is this? Oh, it's trying first. It's like a normal pork bun. Mmm. Oh, my God. That's good. What's your favorite kind of a dough ball? My dad makes the best of the dough, wherever. That's why you ask your dad the recipe here. It's really nice that you're following him. And yeah, but I'm actually a lot of this bad here. But when you left the house after the basic opening, ask me out of the corner. So you now know how to cook a dough ball? Yeah. Oh, that's great. That's great. Wow. Just favorite. Just favorite. Look at this guys. So this is like, yeah. That's the first time I make sushi question. I know, right? It's the original thing I think. Really good. What's your favorite kind of food? Very difficult question. Have you tried just the classic kimchi stew? Kimchi stew basically. That's like the dough ball for Koreans. Like comfort food, you know? What about you? Do you know? Do you like Korean food? I like Korean food. There was one time during the pandemic. I just ate kimchi every day for like almost three months. You like kimchi as well? I don't know. It was a phase. Like I got addicted to Korean drama. We should have made kimchi together. You know how to make kimchi for scratch? From scratch. It was a phase. I had no idea. I was getting addicted to Korean drama. Oh my god. What's your favorite Korean drama? That's really hard. I can't kind of analyze his personality by knowing what your favorite drama. Yeah. This is really hard. Okay, top three. I would go for my top one first. Oh, go for my top one. I love our beloved summer. It's such a, I was going through such a really hard time with like relationship and stuff. And I saw that too. Oh my god. Oh my god. I watched our beloved summer for like 10 times already. It's not bad. Oh my god. And I never saw myself being addicted to k-drama. Okay, next. That's my top one. You know my first first love? I'm like, it's a great one. Yeah, that's super old. Yeah. Our beloved summer, right? It's a bit different from the typical k-drama. Or just a heavy cook. Yeah, actually. Through to get it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. When you first watch like the first parts of it, it feels such a super light drama. And then the middle of it just starts getting really serious. Yeah. Yeah. I first heard your music during the pandemic. By the time I was in Korea, I was stuck in Korea for two years like that. Like I didn't know I'm going through the stuck in Korea for that long. My Filipino was getting worse and worse as I was thinking. Korea, because I don't talk as much to Filipino's in Korea. So that's why it was your music. That I also really let my Filipino active still in my brain. What was the first song you heard of me? Bano. Bano was the first one, but then I became a huge fan, right? So I listened to all of your songs since you released. Ever since. Sick. Yeah, really. And then it was all good. So how do you come up with those very stuck-its-up-this-all-air? So basically everything that I write is based on personal experience. I'm going to give you a few. Oh my god, thank you. Thank you, thank you. Going through a lot of heartbreak. I get dumped a lot as well back in high school. Also, that experience they're talking about, right? Is past experience ongoing or? Some are ongoing. Most of them are like past. Most of them are past. That's kind of like my creative process. So I started off with something really personal. Story-based about what I really went through. So like something super specific, like a place. And then when it comes out, it's really different. Because like I make it as something that people would listen to. Yeah. So everyone can relate to it. Related to it. So like Bano had like super different lyrics back then. Oh. Basically, all of this. It's like me putting out my shoes. Right, right. Yeah. Bridge to connect with them. Bridge to connect with them. So like for example, like a song of Bano. That means you wrote it like a long time ago. Not really a long time ago. When I wrote Bano was actually just a week after. And then I told my living. I need that certain person to hear what I was feeling when she told me. And so I was like, oh my god. This is the reason why the lyrics are really, you can really feel it. So you do that all of that yourself. I do the writing, I do the production, make some mess as well. I have a studio. I actually am wearing production in the US and LA. So I would go home from school. Be on my laptop. I would talk to like rappers and producers in LA. Now be a ghost producer and ghost writer for like two years. I also want to ask, right? Because you are making really a mark in this opium industry right now. What does opium mean for you? Because I feel like it also doesn't get that much recognition as it should be personally. Yeah, just opium in general is such a, I feel like it has its own role this man. Something like K-pop or like time music. Yeah. All of these countries. Filipinos have opium and it's such a big culture. Like everyone basically writes their own music as well. Everyone can produce their own music. Yeah, yeah. So in terms of like the style and everything, it's really versatile as well. Because like we have bands. I'm like pulsing as well here. Yeah. Although I do see the growth of it now. Because like there's so much potential of opium artists like really blowing up. Yeah. There's definitely a bigger platform for all of us artists. We can really just step on the global stage. Because you know there's this stereotype right? The opium's all like sad. Yeah. You know that's stereotyped. What do you think about that? Oh really? Not really. So like I'm making music. I guess I can be an example with that question. Like I made Ha Bang Buhai. Yeah. That one also praises me. So I feel like when it comes to the who good side though. That's our specialty. Like that's the opium specialty you know what? When you say who good, they're like really sad songs. Ah, who good means sad. Sad. It's like coming from the roots. Oh, who good? You're going through something right? Yeah. It'd be the who good and the who good. It's a bit deeper. Yeah, it's a bit deeper. So it's like more of feelings. Like a real feel inside. In my head as well, right? OPM ever since I was young. The kind of songs that I encountered as a kid. I really though in the karaoke, although tatais are singing the stiffer songs. Then bye, right? And suddenly I listened to Pano. And then suddenly I was like, ah, opium. It's like this? Opium can be like this. And I researched more into the kind of trendy opium songs at that moment. And I figured as well, there are a lot of other trendy, you know, diverse opium songs. I really noticed that it's, you know, being taken into another level as well. I feel like it's also the influence of like different artists, like overseas. Like there's so much incorporation of like styles that we hear in the Western music. Southeast Asian countries as well. And what they do, it can be a big influence to Filipino music. Opium is a bit different now. It's kind of sounds bigger. It's a bit different now. Is it just opium if you make it into Filipino? Or what do you think, you know, that's something unique about it? I don't know. I feel like it's a bit similar to K-pop as well. Right. It has its own role, you know? It can be a genre. It can be like, when you say opium, you literally have like different artists already. Yeah. I feel like it's such a big thing to tackle about it. It's a role. Yeah, that's true. That's true. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I'm so happy as well that opium is also getting more and more recognition. So what are you listening to in Korean? K-pop, I guess. Yeah, you know, the old K-pop. I just really grew up with it. You know, the girl's generation era. 21 Big Bang, you know? Gotcha. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you like K-pop? Yeah. Favorite K-pop? I love K-pop. Oh! I love K-pop. I love K-pop. I love K-pop. I'm a huge fan of K-pop. He's kind of similar to you in a way that he also first made his appearance in K-pop star, yeah, in a show. I love his voice. I love everything that he does. He's my one. Oh my gosh. You guys should collab. Oh my gosh. I have a question. What's your top three K-drama? Oh, how's your K-drama? Oh, first one, it has to be Mr. Sunshine. Third. Really? It's like the traditional Korean background. So it's like the tempo. Yeah, yeah, yeah, like that. Like that, yeah, yeah. It really shows the history of Korea as well. Kloy? Oh, okay. Hey, you want to look Kloy? Yeah, Kloy, I really... You know, also now K-drama and K-pop is like a thing. But before, when I first came here, I came back to school. While I was doing my K-pop training, and everyone knew right, I was doing this K-pop thing. Just until then, it was not that big. That everyone would tease me. Like, Ha, K-pop! And then when I put like my background photo wallpaper into some K-pop star, they're like, oh, is it gay? You know that thing? Yeah, yeah, yeah. But then five years, later's image totally changed. Never been got a dick-tool. Yeah, yeah! It was so shocking because, you know, those boys in my class would tease me about K-pop. Later on, messages me like, you look twice to me. Yeah. Are you gonna eat the chili? Huh? No, we have to go. Huh? Have you been to Korea? No. Put on my dreams. I just need to go too. She should go and you should visit those hour-beloved summer. Shooting locations. I'm very, very nice. Oh, really? Yeah, I want to go. And you know, BTS Jungkook reacted to your song, right? Hmm. Next song is, give me your forever by Zach. Yeah. How was that? You were going crazy. Oh my god. Actually, most of my family members are big fans of BTS as well. I would just wake up to such a loud tone. I was like, oh, just singing to songs. And being like, I'm mean. Go to the magnet. Yeah. It's so real. The whole Jungkook thing was wild. We never saw this kind of thing. Even in the first place, like this whole music thing that I've been doing, we never really expected it. Yeah. I'm just a normal kid. How do you feel about that? The jump is, it's very steep, right? How do you feel about that? There has been a lot of, I guess, being lost in terms of, like, the whole music and career in life. How to navigate. Yeah, how to navigate everything. I feel like it all came down. Actually, just last year, where everything was kind of like, that didn't really tell from me. I didn't know what to do. As well as the pressure being like, is like, you know, having like these numbers. Yeah, yeah. There's a lot of misunderstandings when it comes to being number one and being like on top of everything. People in general feel like you have everything when you're up there. It's actually the complete opposite. Right. It doesn't mean that you're up there. You have a bunch of friends. You have everything to rely on. It's actually pretty really lonely up there. So that's why I love my family and a little of my friends now. It's just, I get to like really have a really small circle. But they're, they're all of them are real to me. Right. That's what's important. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I'm really blessed to be here. It's also crazy, right? That I got to meet you as well. Because. Oh, thank you for having me. Of course, like, thank you for coming here. Yeah, I just watched you on YouTube. Oh, yeah. So now I want to know what are your plans? I feel like next year would probably be the biggest year of the whole music thing. I mean, I have a US tour. I have a Canada tour. For basically doing a world tour. Wow, that's amazing. I also have an album coming out. It's probably my most personal and my favorite sets of songs ever. Oh my god. We have a lot of announcements coming soon. Oh my god, I'm so excited. Wow, thank you so much. Of course, thank you for eating with me. Yeah. And yeah, thank you guys for watching as well. I hope you guys enjoyed our dinner time with my Loddy. That's my Loddy. Yeah, my Loddy. You guys in my next video. Bye.
