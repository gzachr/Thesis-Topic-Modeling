 My mom tried jolly bee for the first time. It did not go how I expected. I'm back in the States and decided to treat my mom to the fast food restaurant that I've been obsessed with, jolly bee. We got the two-piece chicken joy. She got the fries and I got the spaghetti. Growing up, my mom would put hot dogs in her spaghetti. So I was excited to see her try jolly bee spaghetti. Because I knew it would be an instant hit. And it wasn't. Next is the chicken. We got original because they were out of spicy. So let's see if she likes it. I had to make sure she tried it with the gravy because it's a mind-blowing experience. But this is what she had to say. And how do you give me KLC vibes before you could? Next is the peach mango pie. And honestly, I was surprised by how much she really enjoyed this. Final verdict. She thought the chicken was pretty good. Spaghetti was pretty bad. And the pie was pretty bomb. We tried jolly bee in America. Do you think my mom should try the jolly bee in the Philippines? If so, drop a comment below. And just so you know.
