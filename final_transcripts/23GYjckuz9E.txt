 Hello YouTube today. I'm super excited because I am going to the famous Leechon House here in Cebu City. I'm even more excited because I haven't eaten anything yet today already been to the gym so I'm super hungry. I've seen videos of this place that food looks absolutely delicious. I can't wait to try it and bring a new along with me. This might be my first daytime video that I post here in Cebu City. I'm currently staying in the business district. Leechon House. Leechon House? I'll just walk. It's fine. I need to walk in film. It's okay. That's it. Yeah, I think it's very close by. Yeah, I'll just walk. Thank you. It seems people who aren't affiliated with any ride-sharing company just pick you up with their motorcycles. It seems and give you a ride. I've seen a lot of this here in the Philippines. We're going to walk instead of taking one of these so we can see the city, see the business district. It's extremely nice and modern in this area. I've also gone over to the IT Park which is also extremely nice. The IT Park seems to basically be the BGC of Cebu City. If you're not familiar, BGC is a very modern area in Manila. I just want to get out of the sun honestly. It's attempted to run so I can get out of the side. I don't like the sun. It seems the Leechon House is just on the other side of this mall. This is Ayala mall. I love this mall with the outdoor area in the back last night, Saturday night. They even had a concert at the mall in the outdoor area. What are your names? My name is Roy. Ryan? Oh Roy. I'm Roy. Oh Roy. Oh Roy. Nice to meet you Roy. Nice to meet you Tina. Yeah I'm John. Jonathan. I'm Trevor Skate. Yeah, Trevor. I don't know what? Yeah but lately it's been all Philippines and I'm probably moving to the Philippines so it's going to be mostly Philippines. For how many months? You'll be here in Philippines. I've been here just over one month. Oh, one month, all right? Yeah. Yeah, that's awesome. Okay, I'm just going to comment for our one for your video. You're going to what? Comment, comment. Yeah, yeah, comment. I'll read all the comments. I'm so thrilled also. All right, thank you so much. You'll be older. All right, thank you so much. All right, all right. I do have one question. Have you been to House of Leechon? House of Leechon, is that it? House of Leechon. Do you know what it is? That one. It's over there? Yeah, it's over there. But it's not open yet. It's not open every time. Maybe launch that. Yeah. It's over there. It's over there. Yeah, it's 10 o'clock at night. Okay, okay. Have you been to Rico's Leechon? Oh, Rico's Leechon? Yeah, yeah. Okay, have you been to both of them? There's something different that they're mostly. You've been to both? Yeah. They're both going with their different. I've been to Hawaii's Leechon more. Okay, House of Leechon more. I think I'm going to House of Leechon today. Can you just say that you're going to walk? Yeah? Okay, all right. Thank you. I love your job. Well, this is the reason why it's a fun job is because of people like you. The interviewing people talking to people. That's what makes it fun. That's amazing, awesome. All right, well, thank you so much. You'll see me tomorrow if I extend. If I stay one more night here. All right, see you. Nice to meet you. Bye. That was crazy. I was over here walking around the mall. Just the outside of the mall. A guard came over and told me I cannot film on a yala property. Even though it wasn't going into the mall, but even the sidewalks surrounding the blocks, surrounding maybe one block surrounding the mall is a yala property. And I cannot film there. He said, once you pass the guard house, you're outside of the property. There's a guard house. I guess I'm in the clear. I've never heard of that. This business district of Seaboo City is really nice. Seaboo City has a vibrant nightlife. There's live music everywhere. I was here for Thursday night. Friday night went out and saw a bit of IT Park. I have no idea where I am. Oh, look. Oh, I found it. Hello. Good morning. House of Leachon. Nice. Not crowded at all. This is, they have just opened, I think they opened at 10am. It's 11am. Maybe it's still early. I haven't been feeling it's gonna get crowded soon though. House of Leachon. Oh, thank you. Hello. Hi. Hello, we're here morning. Welcome to the mall. Hi. Hello. Hello. Welcome to the mall. Thank you. Good morning. Morning. Wow. Hi, sir. Hello. How are you? I'm fine. This looks delicious. My goodness. How are you? Sorry. Oh, I'm good. I'm great now. I'm finally found the food. I'm happy. I can't wait to try this. Oh, you gonna let me try it now? Oh, awesome. So it's a free restaurant. Free food. Wow. Okay, hold on. You're giving me the first. I was thinking the first taste was going to be at the table, but I just got a free sample. Thank you from... What's your name, Shane? Shane. Thank you, Shane. Nice to meet you. All right, so I'm actually trying it as I'm walking in the door here. Mmm. How are you? I'm good. Sorry? It's spicy. It's spicy. It's spicy. Spicy. Does it seem very spicy? Yeah. Wow. It's delicious, though. But it's not spicy. Boy, it's a little bit spicy. Yeah, yeah, not too spicy. This is absolutely delicious. That was so good. This is my second time trying, Leachon. The inside, I haven't had the inside, though. This looks really good to meet on the inside, as well. So the outside, the skin is obviously extremely crunchy. A similar texture to extra crispy bacon, I guess, considering it's coming from a pig as well. Mmm, I can't wait to eat more. Yeah, sure. Okay. Why not? Thank you. Okay, so this is the spicy meat. How spicy? That's what it's regular. Okay, okay. This one's regular, this one's spicy. Okay, so this is the spicy meat. I still haven't even sat down yet. It's just walking in the door. There's the spice. Yeah, yeah. It's got a little kick to it. Yeah. No, it's just mild, it's good. It's just... This is delicious. This is the perfect amount of spice for me. It's definitely spicy, though. Yeah. I definitely taste it. So yeah, it's got a little kick, but it's not overwhelmingly spicy. It's not... Sorry? Yes, I need water. Yeah, yeah. This is so good. I'm gonna get the spicy. I like the spicy. This is really good with the spice. Oh. Okay, all right. Thank you so much. Thank you. I served morning. Good morning. Service water. Yeah. I'll throw out. I'll throw out. Yeah, I'm gonna thank you. They know that I just ate the spicy. I'll eat you all, so she's going to give me water. I didn't even have to ask for that. That was so nice. I just walked in the door. They just gave me a sample. That's definitely a little spicy, though. Hello, good morning. How are you? It's fine. Hello. It's good. Okay. Thank you very much. I'm good, sir. Outside looks great. Yeah. Thank you. It's okay. All right. Do you want to eat? You can choose anywhere. Okay. I'll sit. Well, I don't want to take up a large table because more people might come. Yeah, small table's good. I think I can. Thank you. Perfect. Thank you very much. It came here. Yeah, it's perfect. Thank you. Thank you. Salam alaikum. I have to get more of that. Even though I've already tried it, and I want to try new things for the video, I have to get more of that spicy leecho. And that's so good. It's perfect. It wasn't too spicy. I like a little bit of spice, but I don't. I'm not a huge fan of overwhelmingly spicy. That was the perfect amount of spice for me. And I went perfectly with the pork. I have to order more of that. But let's get something else we want to try. Something new as well. Crispy chicken skin. Oh yeah. I'm so excited. So hungry. Okay, this is leecho and a dish. I want something unique. grilled pork belly. It's probably very good. I feel like I've solved this in a video as well. I tried this the other night at Subo Market. So I won't get that. That might be good. Hello. Hi. Who did the orders? Do you have any suggestions at all? We have big, big stallow. Scalps? Yes, we have calamales. This one, but it's not available for today. Okay. So now, something... We've also finished the both here. And of course the chuan. Yeah, I think I have to get lechuan. Spicy one or the... the oil. I think I'm going to get the spicy one. And something else also. I want to try a couple different things. Something that is unique to hear. Something that's unique to Philippines. Yeah, this one. This is unique. Okay. Squidadobo. Okay. Squidadobo. I don't eat much. So I guarantee this is going to be too much food. But afterwards if we have too much, we can find someone. And I'm sure they'll enjoy it. We want to try a few things. Since we are actually here at the house of Lechuan, we need to get a few things. It's 11.45 on Sunday. Car loads of people are coming in, dropping people off. We've even got a man directing traffic here. Because so many people are flooding in. I think I got here just before the Sunday lunch crowd did. I think all of this is about to be full. It's already full inside. There's probably air conditioning in there. That's what everyone's going in there. The Lechuan has arrived. I've already tried this earlier. So you've had my reaction. I had to get my own full portion of this. And then we've got a couple advertisers that I'll try as well. But this is the one fourth kilo portion. Oh! You get the skin, the crunchy skin on the outside, and of course you get the spiciness on the meat from the inside. This isn't spicy at all on the skin. But this is the portion size that you get. I'm going to eat all of this. I'm not going to film at all. I think we have more food to come in actually. Thank you, Salamah. Chicken skin. Sit your still here. We're going to try the chicken skin. It's green. I don't know any green chickens. It's good. Doesn't taste very healthy though. But yeah, you can definitely taste the oil. Probably not the healthiest thing on the menu. But it's really good. These are, this is an appetizer. So this would be like a snack while you're waiting for your Lechuan. I think so. I made the mistake of ordering too many deep fried things. I wanted to try a couple different appetizers. It's good, but I typically don't eat a lot of things like this that are so heavily deep fried and greasy. Definitely too much for just one person. These are the chicken skins. Here. All right, before we get at the chicken skins, let's try this with the sauce. I don't know. I should probably be using a fork. I don't really know why I'm using my hands. God, that's so good. This is, that's a spicy Lechuan. It might be my number one favorite food. I've tried so far in the Philippines, maybe. Probably yep. Yeah, this is probably the best thing I've eaten so far. It's up in here. The spicy Lechuan at the house of Lechuan. All right, let's try the chicken skins while you're here. Again, these, both of these were appetizers. The fried vegetable and the fried chicken skins. They both look deep fried. Hmm. I like that a lot. I like that a lot. That's number two. Number one. Number two. And that's number three. I've got the appetizers in a bag here. They're good, but if I had one piece, that would have been fine. They're really heavy. So it's not, I don't know why I ordered two of them to myself. I wanted to try a couple different things from the menu. But this is something that is meant to be shared for an entire table. One or two pieces is enough. It's that heavy. So I'm, I saw a family out here. I'd like to give it to them, but I can't find them. They're they're not where they were before I walked in. Overall, obviously the highlight of the meal was the, the leachone. That's what they're known for. And the spicy, the sauce was really good too, but it was extremely potent. You only need a tiny bit of that sauce and you're good. The leachone itself is flavored by, by itself, before you add on that sauce. It's really good. Be sure to check out these other videos that I have here from the Philippines. I already have several on my channel. Be sure to follow along. I will have plenty more in the future. If you liked the video, please don't forget to like, comment, share, all of these things, help out the channel a lot. And I really appreciate it so much. Thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next one.
