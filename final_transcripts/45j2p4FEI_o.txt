 Well, if you do not know much about Canada, the one thing you should know is massive doctor shortage. It is really difficult to get a family doctor. It's been many, many, many, many years. I think about 15 years, the last 15 years of your Canada could not get a family doctor. You just go to walking clinics the only way. Most doctors are two-booked up. When your family doctor passes away or retires or something like that, they will give you some contacts, but they only can accept a couple of patients on and the vast majority miss out. That's pretty common occurrence. As well, if you need a specialty, if you want a specialist, you might wait for six months, maybe even longer. It is possible, if some specialties, yes, you could get somebody within a month, maybe three weeks. But most of them, like a dermatologist, for example, and a five-minute appointment. That's only five minutes. You can schedule them all the way through. It can be booked online in Canada. It will probably be six, eight months out. That's just a fact of life. Here, Idioluilo, we got an OB-GYN for Bianca immediately. They just scheduled something within a week. That was amazing. We have a psychiatrist for January, because only because of a vacation and Christmas. They said, okay, no problem. Three to four weeks, just for her anxiety stuff. Later today, right after this, we have a family doctor for both of us. Very, very quick. They're all doctors in Idioluilo. Hello, doctors. You all know who you are. There's many, many on the Watcher channel, which is so cool. Let's check out. I'm not going to go in there with the camera, but she'll be able to tell you her experience. See how it went. Okay, so look at that. OB-GYN appointment. No problem. How did it go? Am I allowed to show you guys my... Yeah, why not? No, it's inappropriate. That's not it. All right, so you got your paper work? What are those? Those are ultrasound? Yeah, no. Okay. So anyway, so how did it go? It was good. She was super nice. Okay, like, I definitely recommend that. OBGYN. How do you say OBGYN? OBGYN? A lot of people just say OB. I'm not sure if it's different. Yeah, she's okay. Either way, she was really cool. She literally has a TikTok account and vanishes everything. And she's really nice. Oh, just TikTok. Yeah, she doesn't do the TikTok while she has patient feet. But like, she showed me her TikTok video after. And she was super sweet. And like, she makes you feel comfortable. Oh, that's awesome. So, we'll put her TikTok down in the link in the description. Oh, and of course, yeah. Okay, I don't know if anybody... Yeah, if you guys are looking for an OB, we will provide you the information of where to find her. Awesome. All right, we now have a family doctor's appointment to go to. Yeah. And this is our very first visit. And we're really lucky in that our family doctor that we found, because it's the same as our insurance policy, is the head of the Elo-Elo medical society. Yeah, exactly. So like, top doctor, what? We're lucky. We're getting spoiled. Yeah, exactly. Okay, up we go. All right, and so our doctor that is approved for our health insurance. Let's have a cross. And is called Medicus. And they've locations, a few locations here. And so, because our doctor's at this office today, this is the one we're meeting at. And this is Whitmo. The Robinson Plaza, the GT Plaza. The Hazaravans. In Molo, yeah. Yeah, it has the Robinson supermarket. I wonder, are they owned by Robinson? Because the other GT Plaza was across the street from Robinson. Maybe, but there was an SM supermarket inside the GT. Maybe they played both fields. Yeah, maybe. They're like, please don't buy us out. That's right, that's right. Yeah, because yeah, there's a Robinson supermarket in the GT Plaza. Yeah. So, that's sure. Makes sense, then, that they're probably not owned, because why would that one have an SM, and this one has a Robinson? Yeah, exactly. They've worked together. And we've been here before. We have one who's a handyman, the dual-sword. That's right, the DIY or something. I don't remember exactly. Yeah. All what we were looking for, that was Thai things, because of our motorbike journey, which you guys can watch. Yeah, that's what we wanted to look at. Yeah, we needed something to tie our backpacks together. That's right. Because our shoulders were like giving out. Right. Because we both were wearing our backpacks on this 100cc motorbike, driving wrap. Yeah. And, I want to, I'm going to go look at this. Okay, I'm going to just look at this, you know, this whole setup. Okay. What stands out as unusual? You've got nail polish, and you've got some skin care. Yeah. She found it. You got facial and spam. It's spam good for your skin. You want to see it whiteens your skin, in case the way acne is. No, not medical, or your advice. You're not. Yeah. So, while you get your nail polish, your facial is your lat. You get yourself a can of spam. Anyway, not, not make it fun to them or anything. It's just really funny. Hello, hello. You're so beautiful, man. Oh, thank you. All right. Hello, guys. Hello. Hello, guys. Hello. Hello. So, as you can see, I love this. It's like a bizarre also here with all kinds. Oh, yeah. Wow. No wonder you wanted to stop there. Yeah. Yeah, there's the Mr. DUI Y. That's ruined last time. And we only have about 30 minutes. So, we're going to grab some food and right away that just call her name. I don't know. I love oysters. I always can, I never say this word right. Gambalise? Zambales. Zambales? Zambales. Zambales. Maybe I'm saying. I don't know. I don't know if I'm saying it white, but I'm like, yeah. Right. Are you saying it right? Is that the Canadian in you? All right. So, we got fake oysters. Did you tell them about this drama? Oh, yeah. No, we didn't. We made a mistake. We knew that all medical facilities require masks there. We knew that, and yet we completely forgot. Yeah. And the traffic was already hectic, so we were like rushed to get to the office. Yeah. And then we got there, and they're like, you need a mask to go into the doctor's office. And we're like, right. Right. Of course, of course. And so, is there not even a convenience store selling a mask? They're sold there, or something? Yeah. They didn't have any masks, and there's only one convenience store. This is the first time in my entire life in the Philippines, that there wasn't like five sorry-sorry's ready in like, in coughing distance, you know? And so, we were just struggling. We were going down these alleys at alleyways and everything. And then finally, we found just an employee at a restaurant. Yeah. He was on break or something. And what, did you just, we just asked him if he had a mask. Yeah. I just said, hey, do you know where we can get masks? And he's like, come with me. And he literally, he just went down the corner to his house and brought out two masks. We're asked. We gave him some money for them because we saved our bus. Exactly. But it was, this was hard, okay? And we were sweating. It was hot. Yeah. But, yeah. Totally honest, we should have known. Yeah. Yeah. We felt like. Yeah. I was just, you're local. Wow. Doesn't that look absolutely delicious? Why do yours look bigger than mine? That's a little bit. Excuse me. Excuse me, you're smaller than me. Not my belly. Your belly's bigger than mine? I actually don't disagree. But I don't know where you put it. Are you guys? It's crazy. All right. That's quick. That's so fast. Yeah. Oh, it was super fast. I was nervous that we would be late for our food. Yeah. I was nervous. I was nervous. I was nervous. I was nervous. Yeah. We're doing good. Cheers. Cheers. Well, I want to see though. These are ripe. Why? Is that 4 times? You're still missing the 4 times? I'm not. All right. So good. Honestly, we've had them in a lot of places and nobody has yet come and able to beat it. Nobody should take a personal here at the restaurant. It's next level. That's all. All right. That was good. Quick and easy. She found a mirror. Surprise. We have one. All right. So actually, there are two medicas sitting here. One is a diagnostic center. You need to put them in your bottle. Yeah. Where's the waffle house? That one? All right. So we did find the right one though. That is the right place. Cool. The one. This is where we're supposed to go. Yeah. One minute, really. Hello. We're going to put a mask on. Oh, yeah. Dr. Bull. Dr. Bull. Dr. Bull. All right. We were wrong. It's the other one. The diagnostic center, I guess. Makes sense. They're going to diagnose you. Is it being the coolest person in the world? No. Oh, maybe, yeah. But they might say no. So, are you ready for that? They won't come here. Look at the glasses. Where are the clothes? These glasses here. Yeah, I know. There it is. This is where we got to go. Here's your good book. Like a brother. Is it the experiment? You're over it. You're over it. Zebra. No. You're over it. Zebra. 96 or something. You're too tall. Okay. That's all done with. It was very thorough, which we really appreciate. Obviously, it's a very thorough visit of a family doctor. So, they have to put down all of your information into the file. Yeah, exactly. And they should know everything. Your family doctor is your, like, your ghost. Yeah. You're a ghost. You're a ghost. You're a ghost. You're a ghost. You're a ghost. You're a ghost. You're a ghost. You're a ghost. You're a ghost. You're a ghost. You're a ghost. You're a ghost. You're a ghost. You're a ghost. Or like, you're ghost. So, that way they know you're taking any medications for other people, other doctors, that kind of thing. So, they don't give you anything wrong. Cause I have just high blood pressure since I was 23 years old. And so, he's going to change it up slightly. And then, in one week, we'll come back. And test it again and see if it's improving or if it's the same. Or, you know, that kind of thing. And otherwise, we just have, like, you know, the psoriasis thing. Or maybe an allergy or something. But yeah, we're really good. We got a bunch of blood tests for me coming up, but I need to fast for 10 hours. Well, it's fastings at the problem. No drinking of coffee or anything. Just water will make for 10 hours is the pain. Did you get up in the morning? You're like, oh, I'm not awake until I have my coffee. Anyway, it was a pretty painless process. Yeah, and we've been in places in Canada. Very difficult to get a family doctor. Very difficult to get specialists. And so you go to walk in clinics and you'll wait just as long if not longer. We'll wait two hours, sometimes in the lobby or longer just to see a clinic doctor who doesn't know you from Adam. So yeah, yeah, if anybody is thinking, oh, it's far, it's not as superior as it is in Canada or whatever. Yeah. Yeah, that's not a true story. But yeah, it was really good. So there you go, guys, that's our own experience. Of course, I'm sure you can have bad experiences just like anywhere in the world. But yeah, good timing. Look at that. What is that over there, say? Ucai, Ucai. What? I know, I know. How do they follow you everywhere? Exactly. All right, guys, see you later. Bye. Okay, guys, today we're going to have something special. Today we're going to have a Ucai, Ucai challenge. We got contestant number one, Zennel. Apparently, because she's a local, she has a bit of a...
