 with you Friday. The freshest. Hello! Look who's made it back, I guess, temporarily. I just couldn't miss the populations of TikToks, you know? We're here for vocal acrobatics from the Philippines and of course we're better place to find it than in the all godly, the best app in the world. TikTok? Yeah, right. YouTube, YouTube! Oh my god, what the hell? Oh my god, what the hell? I remember when my turn. I remember when I lost my mind. Can you explain? How? How does he do that? Oh, it's just Fibon and Waffle set up and I'm really, really, really smooth in a really smooth way. Similar to a whistle register. So he's flipping really quick into that falsetto way, but he's also pushing towards it. So it sounds more pinky towards the end of the falsetto. And he doesn't lose weight. This, like... Jesus Jason. Jesus Jason. Jesus. Okay, also fashion. Can we talk about that? This, this, this. Just like, it's not even my show. I'm just, oh, would you like to sing, yeah? Thank you, by the way. I just murdered your show. It's not my show. Hey me. That is stupid. That is stupid. Rubius. Rubius. Rubius. Thank you, Paul. Thank you, Lord. Yes, yes. Listen, the thing is, like, those runs are so hard because they're unprepared, because you don't have, you don't, you are, like, trying to figure it out as you're going through it. Right. So you don't really know where or when. It's like a no, no path. You're going to finish or in what note? So you're going to have to, like, it's like building a puzzle. It's like building your own path as you're, as you're coming down the hill in the slate. You know, it's like, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. So you don't really know. It's a lively moment, yeah, yeah. So yeah, you don't really know. Look at this. This is crazy. This is how they carol in the Philippines. Really? I don't know. I don't know. I feel like I just, I travel down memory lane and I just looked at all my Christmases. Just in those 15 seconds. The one lame, it was just nice, delicious until with that soundtrack. Oh, okay, I see. I'm just doing that. What a nice Christmas. I've had some great Christmases. Oh, great Christmas. I've had some great Christmas's. Very nice, okay. Okay. Okay. Oh, we're at the first to say that I was born. Oh, I know I'm probably much too late. Yes, sir. I'm just for my mistakes. But I just want you now. Oh, so brilliant. Wow, yes, wow. Okay, wow. That was so great. People do not. Top of the larynx, look, so all about the building and he's out there doing it and clean and he even give you like a little bit of yodeling. Yodeling. Yodeling. Yodeling. You know what I'm saying? And then I come with a cowboy. Hello, what are you doing? You looking kind of pretty. Yodeling. You know that's yodeling. Cowboys don't yodeling. The cowboys don't yodeling. Yeah, they do. They do. Are you there? What the hell? Yeah, like in Switzerland. Like Switzerland. That's not an American thing. You know? What? Anyways, this guy is unreal. What's his name? His name is Aguilar Archie. Aguilar Archie. That's what it is. Shout out Aguilar Archie. My brother, you've done it again. You did your country proud. He's a woman. What a song. He feels like a woman. He feels like a woman. He feels like a woman. He feels like a woman. Wow. Wow. Yes. You know, he's even, he's so clean. And even smoke. Eyes here. Smoke. He's coming out. What a voice. What a gem. I love his voice. I love his voice. I love his voice. I love his voice. I love his voice. I love his voice. I love his voice. He's beautiful. That's the voice. If I could choose the voice of my character, you get a different voice. That's the voice. If I could choose the voice of my character, you get to play in life. That's the voice I wish I had. Oh, okay. You know what I mean? Damn, dude. Look, and look at him. He just looks like, you know, he's a good dad as well. That's a good man right there. That's a good man. I'm plus, like, imagine if you had that as a father or an uncle, something. You know, be like, I have a father or uncle. You know what I mean? I just wish I had that, man. Yeah. Even I did. Even I did. Who's wearing a light? Okay, but she's put on. You did. You put on some useful clothes. It's number. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. She is put on. She is put on. She is put on. Ortega. She's really famous. What is she? Like an actress. Of course she acts. Everyone in the Philippines, it's like, one talent not enough. But that's crazy though, because it's like, super high on her range as well. Like, this is not natural. This is a fan of him, bro. Can you just click on the thing? Can't click on that. Okay. I found the hair. Yes, I found the hair. Oh, she's the one that sang in the bathroom that we were like, what the hell? Yeah, she's really good. Just when I fell like giving up on us. Oh, it's her. Damn, she is looking on real and she can speak Korean a bit. Well? I don't know how good the Korean was, but it sounds clean to me. Listen, what's impressive about that? It's a good combination of things, but it's the vocal for me. The vocal dexterity and how like, her vocal flexibility there was absolutely stunning. And it was so sport on. I mean, Yes, she has like, in same flexibility. Oh yeah. Also, that song is just so incredibly difficult because of the dynamics of the diction as well, because it goes, so you're going to the notes and dropping down to go back to the note again. So those dynamics, they tend to be quite, they tend to make you tired. So the more you do them, the less accurate you become. Right. So this is one of those videos that no matter how much you practice, actually more practice would hinder your actual progress in the song. I see. Because it's so hard to maintain that type of stamina for so long. No. Oh my god! Oh, that's so beautiful. Oh, beautiful. I love how she is. Is this higher than the original? I don't know, but she is, that's probably the best cover we've seen in a karaoke of this song. And I love as well how she is living her best story. She's living her best life. She is. My gosh. A hundred percent committed to this. Oh my god! Oh, that is just a flex. Every thing that's higher than the original. Probably. I see. I see. I see. Oh my god! Oh, that is just a flex. Every thing that's higher than the original. Probably. I see. I see. That's higher than the original. Yeah, it is higher. I think it's actually higher than the original. I know this isn't a normal night. I don't know many singers in the world that can actually cover this song. Higher. Who cares? Who cares? It's higher. That's definitely freaking higher. I actually think this is the best cover we've ever heard of that song. That is so clean. It's so accurate. There's no effort. There's no strain. There's no need for anchoring. It sounds very relaxed in her natural range of vocal flexibility. I also have to say, I would love to hear her speaking. Yeah, I want to see what she speaks up. Because those larynx, my god! Oh my god! Is that a song? This song, yes. Go girl! Damn! It's with a live band as well. Oh my god! Give a price to those back in vocalist as well. Oh my god! She's good. Mary. Mary. Mary. Mary. Mary. Mary. Mary. Mary. Mary. Mary. Mary. I hate some larynx. I'm the one in the world. I'm the only one in the world. Oh my god! I'm so invested! I'm the one in the world. I'm the only one in the world. Oh! Oh, she's great. Go Mary. Oh my god! She's dangerous, dude. Yeah. You know what's fabulous? She's the best combo of a rock alternative singer that has a bit of like a ballad background. So she makes the two genres in one take. It's hot. That is incredibly hard to manage. And also... Most of my videos are like live gigs. Oh my god! How cool! She does a lot of gigs in this environment, in this place. Maybe just like... You know how that... Or restaurants have like... The set of bands that come in like every Friday or Saturday. Yeah, it's probably like a bar that has a lot of nights. And they probably booked them a lot. Yeah, yeah. But you know what? Like there are some venues that have that one band every week. There's like the in-house band. Yeah. Maybe that's what it is. Oh, I'm living. Oh, I'm living. Can we just talk about how he's a whole vibe? Just look at him. I just saw Chris Brown performing his live. And actually there he sounded so much... Holy fuck. Maybe you can't lie to me. But yeah. That's right. I love that this was the last stage. And I know how I should live. I do wonder what I like about this in Tagalog. And I have a lot of views about it. And I do. I think that's what it is about. I think that's what I like about this. I think that's what it is about. And I think that's what it is about. And I think that's what it is about. I like that. Yeah. I think it's full cover, they sing Tagalog I think it's like a pre-mix It'd be a hot song It's like among the influence papi Michael, Jesus But this is them rehearsing for the tour they did Bulldog Kale together I know, it's stupid Jesus And this is like live rehearsals This is like them trying to figure it out Come on, what the hell What an absolute vibe
