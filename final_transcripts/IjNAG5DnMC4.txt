What a morning. Feeling good. I'm still sweating a bit because it's a bit humid, but it's nice because there's no sun right now. Yeah, I'm just gonna hang out here and cut some fabric because I've been telling a few people over the past few months and weeks, especially in the brown guy that will make them headbands, and I haven't given them to him yet. So, haven't given them, haven't given them the headbands yet. So, I don't want to become Paasa. Paasa on the Philippines is like, getting your hopes up, getting people's hopes up. So, Dili ko paasa, mix some headbands, eat some land zone is, have a beautiful morning and, uh, yeah, then I gotta go to a christening. So good atimersi. Yeah. Well, I realize I'm running low on fabric. I think I have enough to make about 20 more headbands. Here's two of them. If you ever get one of these, please do know this is how they're made and they're not per se, or I just give them away. It's a personal, you know, happiness thing in reminder of, uh, you know, keeping a simple and inspiration in where my energy and life comes from, the Philippines. All right. How are you? Hi.

Commander, if you got back from a beautiful little christening in your community and finish eating a wonderful food, you would definitely go out in the rain and just make some extra sounds like me, right? Hahaha! Comedian! It's raining, it's 2pm, let me go on the beach, do some exercise and uh, woo! Burn off my first the drone in 50 days! Holy smokes! I actually really like when it's raining like this, just rain, not really heavy winds. But, two brazzoes in front of me. Ah yeah, that was Ivan's family though, he has three kids and we're starting to actually get to know everybody in the braungai, at least by face, which is really cool. So if you guys watch this, braungai san Antonio, anybody here and you see this, please don't get upset with me if I don't know your name, because I know you, but just as kuiya, manong and anai, or tida, or tido, or brad, or ate, the great thing in the Philippines is you can just use those terms to show respect, you don't have to know everyone's name, but the beach is misty, a little bit of rain, huge rain just passed through. Yeah, that was great, let's cook the lapo lapo later, but for this video, let's end it here and uh, yeah, parang san Antonio, parang at the year.
