 Guess what folks, we're back. Yay! We made it. We're back in the mold and we love it. And the moment we got here, deep breath, the weight lifted off our shoulders. Like we're home. This is where we call home now and coming up on a year since we came here. It's been a long two months away. We're very, very excited to be back. We've got so much in store. We have so many ideas, a lot of recommendations from the locals on who we should be meeting and collaborating with. The bottom line is we are home. We are here and we are here to stay. Hi. Welcome to the Philippines. We are here. So very much going to be a reality check couple of nights for us. We are staying in a traditional Nipahat. Nipah! Very appreciative of our friends who offered it up to us as a place to land and crash until we find an official home. Myan Buntag. Good morning. Good morning amigos. Myan Buntag Amigos. Myan Buntag Amigos. Oh, you're else like me. Did I get that on camera? I did. We're recording, luckily. It's hot. So it's like really Filipino. Don't touch me. Don't touch me. It's hot. Myan Buntag Amigos. Come on, it's time. Hello, family and friends. We are back. We are back in the Philippines. We are so happy to be here. Rain or shine. We are enjoying life. Crazy couple of weeks for us. An absolute whirlwind of emotions, knowledge gained, humbling lessons. So much has happened in the last couple of weeks that we have so much to talk about. But first we just want to let you know that we're back and let you guys check out what we're staying for right now. So I'm getting back to the Philippines. Some really, really dear wonderful friends of ours which shout to us and offered us to stay in their property in their extra lipahit. We are feeling very blessed for these friends. We've been staying in the Bayog or Cameling. Bayog? Bayog? Bayog? Bayog? Cameling? It's one of these. Or is it? What do you think? It's got to be one of them. Let us know. We want to make sure we get it right. What's your nickname? All my new name name? From my little homie? Big Body Slim. He didn't bring back anything from Bali except for a nickname. Big Body Slim. I lost weight. Did I lose weight, Ben? Yes, you have lost weight. Surfing, hiking up and down the hills, getting sick in Bali twice in one month. That's what I'll lead up to it. And then to top it off going on a shift where all we're eating is tuna and rice. What's up ladies and gentlemen? What's up legends? Welcome to our Filipino crib. What's up Filipinos? This is the Filipino cribs live. We're here. Yo shout out Philippines. Wanna wear my hair down? Because it's like it's wear your hair down. But it's so hot. And it's not just my fault now. It's hot. Oh, so I got my hair up. Can you do a hot hands? Yeah, yeah. I'm one blood. So hold on, let me put my hair up. But it's a mess right now because we just landed and you know we're in the middle. So let's go check it out. It's not a proper Nepah hut. It doesn't come with one of those. This is a traditional communal area. It could be used as a bed but a lot of them use it to sit and chill. I know there's names for all of this but I guess that's the big part. I need to learn all the names. This is my lounge area. We're a hang, you know. Now this is where we piled up all our stuff and got here and just fell over and went. It's good to be home. You know that emotion where you're like oh oh literally home. That's how we felt here. This is all our stuff. Basically that's everything we travel with. And uh it's all we own. It's all we own. Obviously it's a lot. It's nowhere near back back or level. But we want to be a little bit more prepared than them and like do a lot of extreme sports stuff. So we want a home base somewhere. It's tight and secure and then bounce around with little kids. Little kids. Then you hit your fish and rods and then you're gonna pull it and then you're gonna dive here. No. And then it's like yeah I gotta bring it off. And then we gotta bring it off. This is our kitchen. Indoor, outdoor, add-on. The hut is a very traditional bedroom bedroom, bathroom wet head and common space. Then they have this add-on kitchen which is great when it's in use. It's great when it's not in use because you can use it as storage because people come and go workers come and go things like that and owners and contracts come and go. This is a common kitchen. All we really eat is meat on the stick on the grill, habashi style, tiny little Filipino habashi style with the standard banana cuts up marinade that we do. Just like them or we get whole chickens already grilled and we've just cooked rice and mixed it up and maybe saute some veggies. And you can literally do that with a fire or a common hot plate and you sit down on you eat. It's our favorite thing to do. And this is you know the totally normal natural but not always something everyone just shines about. As we call it the CR, if we need to use the restroom, there's a wet head. We love it because it's just like the boats. Wet heads are just like on sailboats where you wash, you rinse, you wash, you rinse, you lather, you rinse. And then you do a final rinse and you're out and that's just like on sailboats. Wet heads work. Don't know what the scoop is and the water floating. You better learn. Little pins. So last but certainly not least, the place where the magic happens. Ahikomatu, anhinkon matu or Denhikokuma or Denhikokuma. Yeah so this is where we sleep at night. There's no magic happening in here. Oh it's magic. These are the windows. They're very interesting. Oh that's very 1985 Florida right there. Oh yeah? 1965 Florida. Washington State. This is something new to me. I just want to stay here and open until it's all day. Yeah. Yeah they break but yeah grandma's house always had them. Okay. Sabaka ayo. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. At night we hear all kinds of noises. Last night was the dogs howling chickens, roosters, the nuts falling onto the roof, the metal roof. That's always a waker upper. Groom storms. Yeah the storms here have been very loudly. Very cool. Very loud. And that's about that. So all we got for our tour today. I'm hungry. Good time. Oh good time. Good time. Good time. Good time. Good time. Oh. Oh. Let me kayo. Oh you want some let me kayo? Yeah. Way to go nerd. Okay. Now what? Oops. I am so hungry and ready to eat. Yeah. We are here. Watch your stuff. At a local roadside stand. Yeah. That's about to grab some money. Oh hungry. Mangoto. Hello. Almost done. How are you? Good? Good? Good. Good. Good. Pork coinudo? Yeah. Okay. Oh.

The local food here is absolutely wonderful. Yeah. You never go wrong. You just pull up. You're going to eat. It's going to be good. Yeah. It's easy. And his aunt, Enthony Bourdain said, try something new. Eat local. Oh yeah. That's all you need. Looks good. Oh. Masarap. Lameek. Oh my god. Small place made for small people. I just can't crunch down sometimes. So I lift a lot of what I eat. Oh yes. Wow. Oh so not beautiful. Lameek. We always order too much food. Do we? This is amazing. It's just like pork shoulder knuckle soup with everything that matters. It's delicious. Lameek. Love me. Love me. All right. The rest has come in. So we got our pork minuto. Some fun seed. Some rice. Some pork knuckle soup. And literally my favorite beans on earth. These beans are amazing. These are the long beans that they turn into the most amazing green bean dish ever. Masarap. So good. The very thing love you need to come here. What was that? Do you're in Penglao? You need to come here. Yeah. It's true. This is delicious. And you take your time. Take your time. It's also good. I want to eat it so fast. Ha ha. Okay, so this is literally like some of my favorite stuff. And it literally just peels like these giant chunks of meat. Just fall right off the bone. Okay, now I eat with my hands. I can't help it. When the woman is dancing while she eats, she's definitely enjoying the food she's consuming. Oh yeah. Yeah. Are you dancing? I've been dancing. So good. Masarap. So happy. Keep your eyes on your own panseed. Don't touch a gross panseed. She lives for that stuff. I can't stop thinking about the Reverend Paton's Big Dam Band. Okay. We deserve happy and day. Like that's my happy song right now. I think the first piece of the adaptation of as many famous people would say right now, becoming Filipino is the eyes and the head, which is really easy for me because I come from a family with a deaf brother. So they're all very and that's how it is here. So I start seeing guys real buying them. Okay. And they're like, when I know I'm there, it's true though.
