 So we passed by McDowell the other day, by the way that's how they see McDonald's in the Philippines. And I suddenly noticed these cute McDowell themed Christmas petals. FYI, but all of our stars shaped Christmas lanterns that you'll see in the Philippines during Christmas season. And I super loved that McDowell made their own version. We decided to see if they had any special holiday treats on the menu. Our son, Kona, loves Oreo McFlurry's, and we saw that they had the speculous cookie McFlurry on their menu. So of course he had to try it. Taste test. Is that cookies? Is that cookies? It's like cookie crackers. Yeah, with anything better. Oreo over there. Oreo. Oreo is still your favorite. Mine is a size.
