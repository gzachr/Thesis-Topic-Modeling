 But you're Friday. The freshest. So we checked out... This is love. We checked out Filipina Pazis, right? And we're quite blowing away. Then one of you said there's this thing. It's got the listen challenge and it's Mike sharing with friends. He he he he. That's actually what he says. I'm not making that up. But so everyone's gonna just out here just sing Beyonce. And I guess the song is called Listen. So I guess to sort of pass along. Yeah, the crazy thing is though, like I have to be honest. So many messages. So many mentions in this in different platforms of the same video. Takbaleska on TikTok or Instagram at WLSK15. Oh, as some of you guys said too. You got consent as emails I guess. Yes. And those lovely messages. I was very welcome. Some of you have very lovely stuff to say. But go on. But yes, I'm really looking forward to it because all of you were really excited. This has 3 million views on TikTok. Just a normal day in the Philippines. Indeed, my friends. Just a normal Tuesday. You can tell that, man. Oh, shit. Okay, they're odd so this, right? So there's about 9 people out of 9. One has to be shit. Oh, well, that's the thing, probably not. No, it's their fairly beautiful. No, no, no, no. Because in a normal scenario, if there was 9 people, 8 would be garbage. One would be good. One's the thing, girl, over the singing guy. In the Philippines. You're probably came up with the idea. Yes, after lots of drinks, so everyone agreed. But in the Philippines, it's like the odds is like 9 out of 10 can sing. One's probably shit. And that one probably dances. You know what I mean? Yeah, well, please basketball with a really good level. Didn't know. Yeah? Basketball's big deal. Huge deal. That's true, that's true. I didn't know that dancing was such a big deal. Sort of in the parties as well. I thought it was just more like singing. But a lot of you guys corrected me and told me, you know, mate, we don't dance salsa, but we dance. Yeah. Oh, girl. Oh, girl. Oh, girl. Oh, girl. Oh, girl. Oh, girl. Oh, girl. Oh, girl. Oh, girl. Oh, girl. Oh, girl. Oh, girl. Oh, girl. Oh, girl. Oh, girl. One, two, three, four, five, six, six, seven. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Yeah, human, three, five, six, seven, seven. And then always staying up to you guys. And then always staying up on you guys. Two, three, four, five, six. Just to be honest, about, yeah, it is a bizarre thing. We are friends. It's good. Mhm. True? But it's been so many years since we've done that. We have, we are friends. Yeah. I think I've done what I was seen before. Bekï¿½ rollers. I'm gonna rest now, start with you guys. Who want to do like that almost again? Uh. I think. But I would be shitting myself in a line. That's horrible. That's a kind of audition. It is. Auditions do make me shit myself without a doubt. Really? How strange. Because it's bizarre. Well, because when you're performing, people went to watch. They went to and they know, you know what I mean? It's like there's nothing to do. They know, you know, they know. Exactly. But if you go to an audition, there's no crowd. You can't work the crowd. You can't make them like you. The thing is, that's how you have to treat the audition. Someone cow will make me. Yeah. So, I got right prick as well. So it's just not auditions, no thanks. And that feels like one. You know what? Pretty much. Yeah. Because everyone's judging you in the back of the line. It's like, you're he's alright. Yes, she was shit. I don't think they would do that. Oh, you're so wonderful. I'm so proud. That's like a pause. Get out of here. What the fuck is this place? Freaking hell. I swear to God. This place. This place. This place. I'm going to work out. That just makes me want to go to bars here in London and start be like, actually, how about we all start a line? I should regret. I should regret this. I don't think this look. I see the comments. I see the comments. I see the staff look just the normal day in the Philippines. People are talented. Normal day. Wow. Well done, everyone. So, normal. I read your comments. I try to read everyone. We've got a team of mother and father. They read everything as well. Yes. That shit ain't normal. In real. We should make. We should make a tick-tock of like trying to recreate popular party tricks from the Philippines in London. Look, I have a, I have a bit of homework for you because we know people from all over the world watch, which is awesome and super grateful. Where you're watching from. First of all, let us know where you're watching from. And then, gather your mates, spread the word, knock on the doors of people. Have you got time for your Lord and the Philippines? And gather them, gather them, put them in a line and do the listen challenge. Everyone has to sing at least like four or five people. So, we can have a decent sample size. Then, because we know we've got people everywhere. We've got people watching from all over the world. Some of the places are they don't even know where places. So, you, you do that. You record it, send it to a lucha. And I promise you, we will do a whole podcast on the world. Recreating Filipino sort of normal behavior. I will do this. If you do help me, I will proceed with this idea. And I would vouch with that. Please continue. Yes. What the hell? Oh, where are the flip-flops? Oh, me. The other game that back is, gearing up for the fight. Listen. Wow, it really went with the set of ship. Her vocals are so nice. They all have appropriate decision making. Yeah. Right, I guess this one was a lover. I like to hear her entry again. But it's interesting because they all have sort of a, this is what's so peculiar is that everyone, I guess the more you sing and we've sort of discussed it and the more you sort of learn about how to listen and then how to replicate. You do. Of course. Of course. I didn't tend that actually. I take all responsibility for that pun. But yeah, so if the more you hear a song and the sort of more you replicate it, you learn some of the musical principles. Yes. And perhaps you start to learn appropriate decision making, appropriate breath control, appropriate anchoring in specific places, when to utilize falsetto, how to make the breath economy work. And sort of even the intent of specific notes, you start to understand how the original, so because it's beyond say the original, how she intended, how she performed the song and the intent behind each sing and phrase is. And you can kind of replicate that then perhaps you can stylize it, give her your own flair related to your own story, make it more fun or make it more emotionally driven. And these are all musical principles that you know people take lifetimes or study, because you can go really deep into a specific one like intent is a huge one. How to sing the same phrase, but with completely different meanings. Well, we call it inflection is a, as well, and also we work a lot in subtext. That's it. So you could always be singing because that's usually what happens in theaters. So you sing the same phrase, but you change the subtext. So whatever the meaning behind from the character's perspective is can change even though you're singing the same phrase, the same lyrics, over and over again. And more often than not, you find singing phrases that repeat themselves throughout the song structure. And in musical theater when has that principle that when the phrase is being repeated is because you're changing subtext or you're doing it for to emphasize the first initial thought process. But yeah, so there's a lot of play in in the thought process behind the same singing phrase. So yeah, it's totally applicable. Thanks, right? No problem. A lot of fantastic explanation. But then you sort of you're kicking out of here. You can learn that essentially, not maybe to that extent, but you can certainly learn it to replicate it. And it's like speech. If you hear a good talker or a good speaker, a public speaker, they have this capability of sort of, yeah, you know, meaning different things with the same words or context is obviously ginormous. Comedians are really good at this. You can see it in actors, especially stage actors is really, it's really palpable. So whenever you go to theater or whatever the show might be, you can really see subtext to be in late pretty well. So it seems in the Philippines they have, because singing is so sort of common and practiced after, it's so practiced and sort of recreationally done, it becomes like speech to them. They learn, you learn how, you know, when you want to swear what type of inflection you utilize there, when you're angry, when your voice changes, or when you're perhaps, you want to be a bit more seductive, or perhaps you want to be more persuasive, or you want to be more cunning, or you want to be more controversial. Things change to anality, inflections, words you may utilize. It seems for them singing has become like speech. Yeah. And because they do it so often, they experiment with so much. And it's so encouraged. Like the fact that you're singing with your friends in the style of environments. So check, you know, demanding song as well. This is just so crazy. Oh my God, she had the hard part. She just took it on the chin like it was. And I had the whole thing. You see, random. You get random. Yeah, I think. They sing like two phrases, one phrase. Oh, a phrase thing, we've won already. Yeah, like I don't, but they're doing it at random. They didn't set up in a specific manner, like she gets the big. No, no, no, nobody knows. That's the thing. You just know what part you're going to get. I think that's what makes it so entertaining. I will only do this without the fellow Filipinos because I will be the shit one. So we will have to do a general Gibbs. Or original Laskers, a program. Oh, actually, we should do Ikow Lang. I love that. I love that. Ikow Lang. Or Dilangi Cow. Dilangi Cow. I fucking love that. Or was the one that Jaya has that is that it was actually a Korean OST. Oh, yeah. Is it Dilangi Cow? Is it Dilangi Cow? Yeah, I think so. What a spangling song, man. I said that really confidently. I'm not sure. You know which one I'm like, you know which one I'm like right now. I'm like super obsessed with. What? Hangang Sahuli. Oh, man. It's been 19. They come like, I can't. I love that. I love that. I love that. I love that. I love that. I love that. I love that. I love that. I love that. I just ran the words that I remember from the beginning. It's a banging song. It's one of the best palettes. I think it's come out of people. I agree. Yeah, come. That until a loo has pretty good to do. Yeah, till a loo was a banging song. Yeah. Do it again, girl. Do it again. Do it again. Yeah, because I thought she was going to do it. Woo! It was set in Virginia, really. Woo! The growl, baby. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
