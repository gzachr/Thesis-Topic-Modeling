So have you noticed any differences here in the Philippines? Yes, there's lots of differences. So first off, it's like you never stop. There's no red lights anywhere which is awesome. No rules. Yeah, I mean the model here is like it's more fun in the Philippines. It's way more fun to ride scooters here than it is in the US. Yeah, you're not worried about getting speed in tickets? No, I get those all the time in the United States. I don't get them here at all. Anybody? I'm not yet. Can you get speed in tickets here? I don't think so. Because I saw speed limits for 30 kilometers per hour. Yeah, they... I've never heard of a speed in ticket but... Alright, cool. Yeah, I'm for it. But yeah, oh. I noticed there's a lot of hazards and the biggest hazard that you'll run into is a dog. You're gonna beep at the dog's like 20 times. Yeah, I think that's the number one cause of crashes. Really? Dang dogs. Especially in the next time. Dang dangos. Alright, so... I'm gonna go get some fruits. The first time I've had a hard time, the first time I've had a hard time. Three days a day.
