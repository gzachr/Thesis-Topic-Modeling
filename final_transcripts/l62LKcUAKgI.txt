 We're going to use part of this banana stock as a plate for the coconut candy to dry. Manah! Manah is done. This is where all the kids were swimming when it was raining that one day. Since the last time we were here, Baludoi made a badminton net or volleyball. They mowed the grass or got all the tall grass from here too. Yeah, very cool. And then the other ingredient for the coconut candy is the coconut. So these older coconuts are good to use for cooking. And there's not a lot of meat in there so we have to grind it up. And then the newer coconuts are good for like eating and for the juice. And then we have brown sugar. So there's only two ingredients for this coconut candy. It's coconuts and then brown sugar. Michael's doing the pudding. Alright Michael did a great job at shredding the coconut. Three cups of water. Okay. Three. No. I did wash my hands. In 몇 times? Me. Freeze and put them in and think that was smaller. that bastion of宙 gives it both of the female Capin So we're going to cook that until it gets sticky and yellowish. And that's just the juice from the leftover coconut meat. Mix it with a little bit of water. The cow came to say hello. Look at that spatula. Very nice. All right, now is the brown sugar. So this is a little similar to Bacayo that we made in a Jerome's house. Yeah, coconut and sugar. Very similar. But that one is the meat. But that one is the juice. Yeah, but we're going to add the meat later, right? No. Or no. Okay, so we're not going to add the meat at all. Okay. So I guess that's the one big difference. We're not adding the meat at all here. Another one we added the meat. So this is just the juice and then brown sugar. And then the bacayo is the meat and the brown sugar. Okay. It's getting heavy here. So that's like a way to your sleeper. You can smell the brown sugar and the coconuts. It smells good. It's a hot job. It's good to keep taking care of. It's nice to have a lot of people here. We can keep roadtakes. This is probably the longest process of the whole procedure. It's stirring and waiting till it gets sticky. It's getting close. It's almost there. All right, I think it's finished. Arinati Bek. I'm going to add the coconut milk. I'm going to add the coconut milk. I'm going to add the coconut milk. Next step, we're just going to let this dry. A guy is out. Look at that. It's already starting to get hard. Let's go. Let's go. I can't do this anymore. Let's try. Let's try. Today's lunch is sardines with some rice. All right, we have our spoons. Now it's time to eat. It's hard. All right. The guy is out. I'll be. I got some here today. How was it? Not yet. Wow, that's a big piece. Oh, no, no, no. Oh, there it goes. It's my take a while. It's my take a while. It's my take a while. It's my take a while. I'm going to take a while. If you got your trinness at home, you probably want to slice it before it gets too hard to get it into pieces better. Once it dries, it's really hard to get it apart. I'm going to put it in here. I'm going to put it in here. It's hard. It's a big piece. Something about to eat this off. It's good. It's good. It's good. That is good. It's like a hard candy. I hope we can get on a plate and just crack it open. Get a hammer. When you get to the end pieces, it's hard enough for you to crack it or chew it and crunch it. Right now, the middle part is still a little warm. It's really, really sticky. It's really hard to get it apart. Once it hardens, it's crunchy. You can probably crack it apart when it gets hard enough. We didn't want to wait until it got hard enough. Everyone's ready to eat right now. Let's eat. Come on. It's good. It's good. We need our helmets. We have flying candy. It reminds me of toffee a little bit. It reminds me of that. You got toffee? No. If you had candy wrappers and wanted to do this to sell it or something, you could get the wrappers, but like a spoonful before it gets too dry, before it gets hard, then you can wrap that up and once it dries, you can save it for later or you can easily store it too. You can just have one piece at a time. Or if you wanted to sell it. This is only two ingredients of brown sugar and then the juice from the coconut. Very simple and very delicious. The good thing about candy like this is it will last a long time because you're pretty much just sucking on it. It's like a hard candy. It takes a long time to eat. It's the biggest candy ever. It's the biggest candy ever. Oh, oh. Keep turning. Keep turning. Let me doubt it. So I think I'll never be hungry for one week. Really? I'm going to have a bite. I'm going to have a bite. Ah! I'm going to have a bite. It's going to be a bit hard. It's going to be a bit hard. I'm going to have a bite. Where do they go? Oh, when I eat it, I'm going to have a bite. Look at that. Look at that. Wow. It's a messy treat but it's worth it. Hopefully you guys enjoyed this video. That's a pretty simple treat to me and really delicious. Perfect little piece of toffee or candy. So I think we're going to finish these up and then we might play some badminton later and Boulude always knew net. And we'll see you guys later. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. Oh, there goes the first beat. What? Hi! Hurry, hurry. Look at that. Amerika is reaching a corner! Moses! Lewis! Let's go!
