No! You want to know what that is? What is it? It's just a cream and condensed milk. Let's just eat that. So, my down, what can you say about Filipinos food? Oh, please! I'm going over there. As soon as I can. But you're gonna come with me. They can show me all the restaurants. This is so nice. So nice. Oh, it's just awesome. You're enjoying it. I love eating it. I waited for... ...so grumpy to finish. Then I came to the restaurant. I'm really enjoying it. Yeah. Mom, do you think it's another one? I don't think so. That's why he's called grumpy. You want to do a fruit salad with me? It should be so deep. It's like congema tangen. I'm waiting for the reaction. Lovely. Very, very nice. So grumpy is passing with the food, I believe. But he likes our Filipinos food. I love them. Thank you. No, Lady Dee, you don't make those for him. No! Of course, he's a Filipinos food. Cream and condensed milk. Yes. You think I look like this? Yes. I'm sure it has been more nice. You should challenge. What does that have? Yogurt. No? I don't know. What does it have? Okay, fresh cream and condensed milk. Apple. And apple? Apple, you know the fruit salad in a can? That's it. I just put fresh apple. Guys, mistato should be one of the team of bikinis. She always make a good refood review of Filipino food. Whoa! Oh! I like it. Wow! It's like a wholesome cream. Okay. It just makes it a fruit. It just makes it a fruit. It's like a wholesome cream. A lot of them say it's a yogurt, but no, it's not. It's a fresh cream and condensed milk. It's not fruit for the hips. Because you want fruits and it's for the healthy. What's with the cream? It's so good. Wow. It's so good. It's so good. It's so good. It's so good. Yes. It's a really similar. Just keep the fruit mix from the supermarket. And then just fresh cream and condensed milk and mix it. Are you going to add raisins or what? Yeah, raisins. You can put grapes or whatever fruit you want. But you can even use fresh fruits. No, that's... Don't change anything. That's one of the favorite desserts in Filipino. Guys, we start with love. I love this grape. It's so good. But it is so... Just an ashoga. And a happy dawn. So now, what can you say about Filipino food? I think it should become the natural food of South Africa. It's really good. I won't lie to you. I've never had Filipino food before. But all the meals that you've done for me are... Thank you so much. All of it. Different you need. I love it. I really love it. Thank you for being open-minded and trying what I'm bringing you. Thank you for feeding me. See you next time, Adam. Thank you. Thank you. Bye. This is a fruit salad. It's a different kind of salad. It's like a dessert. I'm not sure if you're doing that here. Is that yogurt? No. What's that? It's cream with condensed milk. Oh, okay. Yeah. But it looks very good. That's very sweet, isn't it? It's almost as like yogurt. I'm seeing a lot of the stuff are so in the macaroni. But it's a completely different taste. The mixture, they've blended together in your mouth. The raisins have a nice... I like raisins a lot. They have a nice consistency. Like the mixture. It's just very good. I eat this for dessert at a restaurant. Okay. Also, you have that. Never tasted something like that. It's almost like yogurt, but it's very different. When they make fruit salads and kia, they don't use condensed milk or cream. It's more like a jelly mixture. So this is very... Never add something. All right. I really like the sweetness. I like the pieces as well. Because it's not just like smooth. It's like little chunks. Can you see now that Filipino foods are very nice? This is very very good. You know what? If you come to Philippines, you're going to get fat. I promise you that. Okay. Thank you, Pa. Thank you very much. See you next week again. See you next week. Bye, everyone. I hope everybody is doing good. Thank you for all your support. I like all your comments. I feel very happy. Everyone is just so kind and awesome in the comments section. And thank you very much for watching. Bye, everyone. Love good morning, kia. How are you? I'm good. Long time no see. Where have you been? I've been here. I don't think you see. There's only weeks I've been. Okay. Lucky I show you today. Now I'm offering you fruit salad. There you go. That's one of the Filipino foods. No. Popular fruit salad for dessert. Is there anything that makes it different from normal fruit salad? Yeah, taste it. And then let's see. Tell me, have you tasted that here already or no? No. So that's really the difference. It tastes sweet. Yeah. We put cream and condense milk. Oh, good. That's why it's creamy. I like condense milk, too. How old are your kiosk? I'm going to reach my next month. Okay. What made you make this salad today? Oh, I'm going to be a little bit too old. But what is that? No, because I'm always making breakfast and meal. And some viewers, they want me to offer Filipino desserts. That's why. How is it so far? It's nice. Thank you. It's nice and sweet. This is very good. Is it that good? Very good. Thank you. Okay, madam, this is dessert. This is also fruit salad. Oh, that's a different kind of salad now. Oh, fruit salad. I like it because it's sweet. Is it like condense? Yeah, it's very good. Condense and cream. It's good. I like the sweet and the country of the apple. It's really good. Thank you, madam. Thank you. Thank you. I really saved the last piece for you. Thank you so much. That is a fruit salad also. Okay. Now, I don't know which one I like more. The chicken or the fruit salad. That is really more on the dessert. It's really good. It's really good. I can taste some peaches, some here. Yeah, I use the fruit in cans. Okay. But you can use the fresh fruit in here one. And then I just added the fresh apple and the raisin and some cheese. Oh, and cheese as well. Yeah, there are small bits of cheese there. And then your cream is also the dessert cream and condense milk again. It's a cream. Yeah. No, it's just an all-purpose cream or the fresh cream. Oh, okay. So easy to make. So good. Thank you. Thank you so much, madam. There you go, my friend. Our fruit salad is finished. And always thumbs up and they love it. All right. Thank you, guys. Bye.
