 Schmehrres Reis? Ich bin Abta. Meå„˜fried. Meå„˜ced einer. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . In the Philippines, the weather changed, so for at least some times. Got a great sunny day. And then this happens. We knew there was an LPA moon across the Philippines. Although it looked like we saw it in past already. It might be the tail end of it. So the rainy season is here in the Philippines. It's not going to stop us doing what we need to do though. So sometimes you don't get what you want, but you get what you need. Living here in the province, here in Lati. We get a bit of rain from time to time. Sometimes you wake up and you hope it's a sunny day. That's a little bit grey like it is today. But you look on the bright side. The glass is always half full. When it rains, the garden loves it. The plants grow. The cool things down. It's quite nice from time to time. So I've got my towel. Now I've got used to using this. It's handy. You put it in the back of your neck. There's two things. One is protection of clothes and sweat. The most important thing is protection of sweat. When you do sweat, you can draw on the back of your neck. That can lead to certain things like pneumonia. Trying to get out before the rain comes. Would you have fun this storm today? Yeah, fun this storm. We'll talk a bit more about that a bit later. Ã¤an Ã¤an Come in, Gene. Das Restaurant ist poder~!! Ich ðŸ˜Š Der Twin Belgische Tag stÃ¶rt sich auch im twelvechan<|de|> ihm headaches lassen Auf dem Zhan und werden reducing Daschen ist gewechselt Hi there we are. I'm running for digging. I'm running for digging for digging. So we're stuck inside the house the last day or so. Good to get back out in the garden. So it's always nice to be back in the garden. It was nice to have a garden. When we built the house the garden was a little bit of an afterfall in the beginning but the more we fought about it, especially with the cost of living and going up around the world. We knew that a garden would be very beneficial for us. Some of that we can go to, to grow our own fruits and vegetables and also to come outside and relax. I should only be stuck inside the house all day, especially living in a place like this. Wow. You really want to be out with nature, enjoying it. The size of this aqua. So... It's still red, isn't it? This is the original aqua we first planted here. Still going strong. How old is it now, six months? I'm sure it's the same in America, Canada, Australia, every country around the world. Even the Philippines, the prices have gone up. And it's difficult. So growing your own fruits and vegetables will save you a bit of money. And it's fun to do. So we planted some peanuts in this end bed. And these are really taken off. Really started to grow, aren't they? There's a flower here. There's quite a few flowers. Does that mean the peanut will start to grow? Yeah. I think six, three months. Is it three months? I think about three months we've never grown peanuts before. Bit of an experiment, really. The next day I just had a wash, look at him. He's doing everything he can do to get money again. Cream... Cream. Cream... Clean, cream. This stupid dog. Look at him. Look at him! Ich denke, he likes to wash, but sometimes he does what he can't get dirty. Oh, cream! For cream to have a bit of fun. So soft on the garden up. Oh, cream! They don't like being wet these dogs. He's going to go and do his disappearing after think. Cream? No! Ah, there he goes again. Oh, creamy boy. What we're going to do with you. Iné›…, Caruille, cream. So it was less than two years ago, we decided we wanted to move to the Philippines. And around 12 months later, we actually made the move. Now, about a lot of comments at a time from people, from all you guys around the world, a lot of you are saying the same thing you're looking forward to move to the Philippines. Maybe you made the move. If you did, let us know in the comments how did it go. So if you haven't made the move yet, but you are going to make the move, let us know in the comments. Is there anything you're not looking forward to? Anything you're worried about? As it's not easy to move to another country. We've done it relatively easily. We've been lucky, of course. But we did a lot of planning, a lot of research. I've had a lot of luck on our side. And we're here now where we are. And we're here to stay. And we won't swap that for anything. We're looking forward to traveling a lot more. We went to Clankhaman Island, which is fantastic, spectacular. Just as we remember it to be. And we really want to go back. And go to more places. So, the cook is here somewhere. In the Philippines. And in a lot of countries, you do get a lot of forms with rats. And rodents, mice. And this happened. So, as you might be able to see. We've had rats in the car. It's actually living in the glove box in the engine bay. Hello, Cookie. You okay? Cookie spends a lot of it's time now in the garage area. He likes it here. It shades it's cool. It's got plenty of food and water. He's on the watch out for rats trying to climb into the car. And flies on his pool. Where I'm cookie, good boy. You're too big to go in the roof space. So, I have to still get a cat for that, I think. Look at this sky. Looks like that's going to be a thunderstorm on its way over. Definitely, definitely, definitely rainy season. It's last time to start cooking our dinner. It makes having specials in Filipino food tonight. We have some beef. You're going to try something new. Now, I do like Filipino food, but I have to admit, I've never cooked it before. This is going to be my first time trying to cook. It might not be a traditional recipe. Maybe something I'll make up myself. But it should be quite tasty. Got blue sky there. And then you turn the corner. And you see this incredible dark cloud coming up over the mountain. I'll try with the blue kid. So, we're going to start by boiling water with the beef inside. So, take about 40 minutes into a really soft, tender, and we can add the rest of the ingredients in. Change your plan. We're going to use taro instead of sweet potato. Might be a bit nicer. Now, we're going to use a little bit of garlic. We're going to use a little bit of garlic. We're going to use a little bit of garlic. This is coming along nicely. So, we need to add some ingredients. Have a cool. And even. Or even hands are clean. Got it. This is a beef stock, even or beef stock. Beef stock, even. Beef stock. Beef stock. The dinner's ready. Jane doesn't know I've done this. Is the bell that's been helped me to record this. But Jane doesn't know anything about this. It's going to surprise her now. This is my first attempt at looking at food. It's not just from S&P. But there's a beef stew, similar to bullenue. But there's no sweet corn in it. And no long beans. Not too bad. This is ready. It's dinner time. It's very nice. It's a little bit up top. I've made just some food. I've made some dinner. What is that? That's beef tunnel art. Beef tunnel art? What is that, man? Beef for the loo. But it's not quite the same. It's a little bit of a loo. But we didn't have all the ingredients. So I made it the best I could. And I've blessed the food. And first, what is the... How the chicken? I have the chicken. The servings were from dinner. Do you want to speak nice and tender? I'm going to try this soup too. Snack is... Really? It's nice, yeah. Nice, well done, darling. I'm going to try it on. I can't wait to eat it. Snack is nice. Snack was specially when it was really season. What's this? It's great. It's a paro. You know, it's a paro? It's a paro. It's a paro. You should've added a boiled egg. What? What are you doing? I don't know. This is the same as the same hatchy, because you... It's you. This is cooked though, right? 100%. Oh yeah. It's cooked. It's not always about this. It's not raw. It's not moving in the film next to us. Actually, that cow hasn't been there for a few days. Don't blame me. It's a paro made it dessert for us. Yeah. I was born on year, so I made some mango flow. Oh wow. Mango flow, that's something. It strikes the billers, the syrup. I think it's going to be very lemmy. Good. It's good. Good? Of course. It's good. It's good. So we're going to leave it there. We're going to finish our desserts, and we'll catch you next time. Thanks very much for watching.
