I grew up in Mambahau.

Sintro.
Sintro.
In Mambahau.
I grew up in Mercado.
Are you from Asaka?
Mehinog.
Hubangon, actually.
Representing Hubangon.
Yeah.
Representing.
Pageant, isn't it?
Pageant.
Yeah, so I'm down the other end of the island.
But right now, we're just going to have a little chat.
We're just going to have a little chat.
Where is that one located?
Naasag.

But we're best friends now.
So that's why we're making this video.
We're just going to have a chat right now.
We're just going to have a chat right now.

Naasa.
That's been open for three years, and this one is like 12 months.
So it's been a year.
What is one year?
Sakatuigud.
Sakatuigud.
So right now, she's living in California, but she's still back here in Camiguin.
She's been doing business here.
Even though she's been doing business here, it's better for her to work here.
It's better for her to help the locals, give back to the community, right?
Yes.
Yes.
That's my vision for Bintana is really to develop Camiguin talent or anywhere we can
open and make them to be a rock star where they can be sustainable under their own business.
That's my goal, like train them to be the best employee, and then they can do it now.
What was your inspiration for that?
I think, you know, I grew up very poor here in Mambajao.
I saw my family.
They succeeded running a business.
My mother started that pastel.
Oh yeah.
So it was started from my grandmother.
I think it's from her grandparents.
So I saw how they were able to build a business and employ more employees.
So that gave me a confidence like, okay, if they've done it, I can do it.
So that was my drive of opening a business because when I was young, I was slave laborer.
Like making pastries.
We used to go to Bukid.
And we used to go to Bukid.
So we used to go on a Sunday, collect lubing in Bukid.
And then we dry it out.
We chop it into pieces and dry it out.
And that's how we bake the pastel back in the day.
If you don't know what pastel is, it's like a pastry, right?
It's like a pastry.
It's sweet.
It's not sweet to your friends.
I just don't eat it.
It's sweet.
It's sweet, right?
You eat it here.
So your family is not the inventor?
Yeah, my grandmother.
Yeah, my grandmother.
And then my aunt scale it.
Really?
To my mom's mother.
So my mama and my sister, they're still involved.
But I moved and did my own because I'm hard-hitting.
She's the boss.
Me too.
You're the boss.
Yeah, you're the boss.
Did you watch it?
I'm watching what you're doing.
I'm watching what you're doing.
Well, my parents had a business here as well.
So like back when we lived here in 1994 to 1999, I think, I was Batapa.
But they had a cafe called Koala and it was down the other end of the island.
But yeah, my family has had its roots in Kamigan for a long time as well.
So it's nice to see Kamigan flourishing finally.
What was the top seller food in Koala?
Lechon Mano.
Just the big classic lechon.
Yeah, we also used to sell it from our house as well.
And then on weekends, they had a stall at the cockfight.
And then our house was also a karaoke bar.
So sabat kayo.
Was that still the same now?
No, it's just the house now.
Actually, it's not even the house now.
Wow.
So what do you like about Kamigan yourself?
That's what I like about Kamigan Falls.
There are also secret falls that are not yet famous.
I don't know where they are because it's secret.
So you can go there, go to the beaches.
She has a family here.
So next week, you can go with your relatives.
You'll be able to play, I promise.
You'll be able to have more fun.
This is my third time.
Third time here in Kamigan and third time this year.
It's all been since we've been dating.
Actually, no, first time I'm here.
I haven't been here yet.
But it was our first trip together.
Yeah, our first trip.
Wow.
So Kamigan is memorable.
Very memorable.
We had a dog here.
We adopted a dog.
But no, he doesn't like us.
So we had a dog.
What's his name?
Junior.
He was a puppy.
When he was a kid, he couldn't bark.
He was like that.
And then we brought him back here.
He wasn't like that anymore.
He didn't bark anymore.
He was like that.
That's sad.
So it's up to him.
He slept in my room.
Slept in bed with her?
Yeah, literally.
I got him clean.
I gave him his first bath.
Because he was just a street dog?
Yeah.
I think it's my cousin.
My cousin's house.
And I was like, oh, that's cute.
Can I take your dog?
And they were like, OK, no problem.
And then I gave him back after a few days.
Because we had to leave the island.
He forgot about us.
Maybe he's chapped because we abandoned him.
Yeah, maybe.
Or you got Gary.
Yeah, we do have Gary.
Not my dad.
So we're here in Bintan in Paris.
We're here in Bukit.
They're here with Gary.
But he's a woman.
He's not a man.
Maybe he's chapped.
And then he has children.
But they're hidden.
They're in the forest.
In the forest.
In the forest.
But we can't find them.
Maybe they're at home.
Maybe they're at home.
Yeah.
So we're here.
They're probably gone.
Exactly.
Exactly, exactly.
Yes.
Yeah.
And you have how many kids?
I have two kids.
I have boys, Joshua and Luke.
And they're 13 and 17 years old.
Do they know Bisaya?
No.
Can they understand?
No.
I know.
You've got to bring them here.
Yeah.
You guys need to hang out.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They know when I'm mad.
Because it's the same tone.
You speak Bisaya?
Yes.
Huy.
Mamalikas.
Mamalikas.
Bad words.
Bad words.
When you translated to English, how do you...
How is that bad words when you say at the...
Does it really work?
Yeah.
Like the bad one.
Yeah.
Does it really translate?
No.
It doesn't translate very well.
It's not bad in English.
Yeah.
It's not bad in English.
Like one of the words that's bad in Bisaya means devil.
Yeah.
Insect devil, but that's not bad.
That's not a bad word.
Insect devil.
Like liver.
But if it's Bisaya, then...
Like how is liver?
Liver.
Like when you chop it?
Yeah.
Like dinuguan?
Like liver.
Yeah.
So how do you...
Yeah.
So it was very interesting.
And how many times have your kids been here?
I've been here maybe four or five times, but they were very young.
But last summer, they were here at the construction.
Nice.
Construction worker.
Yeah.
Because I want them to really know the culture.
Yeah.
For them to work and...
Really?
Yes.
Yes.
And your one anak is scared of the...
Yes.
Oh my God.
He's...
I've been trying to convince them to stay here for the summer, but ang magulang na
trauma git siya kai ang iyaya ko na hogi bubuan na siyag tungnonga tubing.
So he doesn't want to do it like...
He tells me, like, Mom, I don't want you adding it to me, like...
Oh my gosh.
Pour me like a cold water.
So had log siya mo balik sa pinas tungnonga tubing.
Basing didi siya naligot sa bukit kaya.
Basing didnong kaya, yeah.
But I think he was fine the last visit.
Likes it now.
Good.
Yeah.
They like their free massage because it's cheap.
Right?
Yeah.
You get a massage the other day.
Yeah.
Your masseuse is so good.

that is cute, mantigi, yeah i like mantigi a lot
i like that trees
and the backdrop
i like white island but i don't like heat so much
so hot? yes so hot
every time we go we get so sunburned
and we're too kuri po to buy a payong
payong?
i don't like to drink sunburned liquor
i get super sunburned
my whole back went
yeah i like mantigi because it has trees
i like the island where
it has a tree
and i just discovered they have a
bridge in between the forest
i didn't know that
did you know? no
it's like a
it's like a hanging bridge?
the bridge just goes through the forest
but it's like a bamboo bridge that you walk across
kind of like the mangrove bridges that they have
yeah that's cool
what part of korea
is your favorite? which tourist spot?
tourist spot?
i love mantigi as well
and mehinog pride
bag and weapons pride
and like
my favorite memories coming back here
before it was super touristy
we had our own boat
so we would just take our own boat over
to mantigi
almost by our house across there
just with my family
i loved that
what else
do you love?
i loved ardent when it was super hot
but it's a bit cooler now
it's like lukewarm
yeah
i loved going to ardent
that used to be my favorite
when it was warmer
because then when you're done
you just sleep and hike
but now it's not as warm
what's your favorite
spot in camellia?
i've never been
i'm just kidding i've never been
but one day i will hike it
by yourself
she has terrible lungs
i have asthma
bad lungs
so if any of you want to hike hibuk with me
but you need a guide
we have a guide
we have eight guests
last week
hibuk hibuk
that's the giant volcano on this island
just one of the many volcanoes
i've heard it's very tricky
you heard it's a gnarly hike
when my dad lived here
way way back
he was in mambahau at his
suki bar
a foreigner came in
and he had
a broken leg and cuts all over him
and dad was like what happened to you
and this guy hiked hibuk hibuk
by himself without a guide
and fell down
hibuk hibuk
but not the whole way
that would be a long fall
enough to break your leg
it's very tricky especially when
it's rainy season
we need to hike
we need to slowly
we should hike tomorrow
tomorrow
oh gary the guy
the dog
no he's a guy
he's one of the guys
is he important
no
gary
what's his name
we all have borrowed names
like jr
kaloy
so why is he named kaloy
because
everyone calls me carls in and that's not my name
so i just go with kaloy
i did a vote on instagram
what my bisaya nickname is
and since carlos
is to kaloy and carzon
is close to carlos
they just named me kaloy
so it's easier for the locals to remember
otherwise they have a hard time
remembering carzon
or they say carlson
kaloy and carlson
i have two nicknames
derisa and kamegan
the first one is koala
because of the cafe
that my parents had
some people didn't realize it was named after
the austrian animal and they thought it was named after
the anak
so even now
i'm 24 and people who
knew the cafe back then
koala
and then
my other nickname is joey
because sometimes people have a hard time
saying zoey
so they're like
oh my name is zoey
that's close enough
so now i'm just like
i also get called kaloy
but that's just
everyone
not just in the philippines
my grandma calls me kaloy
and sometimes people
will write kaloy
my name is right there
this is a very unique name though
i've never heard of zoey
except for your other cousin
there's a decent amount of zoes but never spelled
z-o-e, it's normal
z-o-w-i-e
just her
and my cousin
because my dad liked david bowie
so that's why
it's gonna be careful
because sometimes it cuts off if it's too long
yeah
19 minutes
that was good
that's
1 almost 2 o'clock
so it's just that time
nap time
nap time
in the hammock
in this bad boy
you got everything you wanted
at least for this time because
stay tuned
