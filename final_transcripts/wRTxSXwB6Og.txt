 The Philippines, home is some of the most beautiful islands in the world. And some of the most amazing food and culture you'll ever experience. It's also home to the most friendly, humble, Filipino people that live day by day with smile on their faces, regardless of the challenges they may face. As a Filipino American, they grew up in the USA. I wanted to humble myself and experience what life is like living like a Filipino in poverty. The goal is one month living in the Philippines province on a 200-pacel with day budget, which is $4 USD. I must live like a Filipino in experience every day just like my ancestors who still live and still living to this day. So join me on this new journey of becoming a true Filipino, paramount. I want ice candy. Which one? You show me. How much is it? Do you want ice candy? Do you want? How many? One, two, three, four, five. Oh, wow! Ice candy. Oh, market adventure. Look at all this stuff they got now. I'm not gonna lie. I'm really hungry, so this is definitely gonna hit the spot. You wanna get fried or barbecue better? Yes, more juicy. Welcome back guys to day 20. Yes guys, it's already been day 20 in this journey. We only have 10 more days now. 10 more days of living in a tent. So yeah guys, I'm very excited. I'm very proud of myself for actually doing the tent the whole month, where 20 days already. So if you haven't seen my other videos, go check them out. There's a whole series on it. But guys, I'm very surprised this tent has been holding up because it's been very windy now. I know, we made it extra sturdy. Extra sturdy. So if you guys are new to my channel, I do live in a tent. So if you are new, I will give you a quick little tour. So guys, this is the living room. You were met with a nice comfy couch. We have a table to eat and do office work. This couch actually turns into a bed as well. And this one is where we sleep. But I wanna say to you guys, this tent can hold 8 to 12 people. So it's a very big tent. It might not look like it on camera, but it is very spacious. It could probably hold, I would say like, 6 Americans or foreigners. But Filipinos definitely have no problem with 8 to 12. So yeah guys, for today's vlog, for today, what are you doing now? I don't know, rossers fighting. So for today's vlog, we are going to... Wash your bike and so on there. Yeah, my bike needs a wash. We're not gonna be going to a car wash, we'll actually be just hand washing area. Yeah, we can hand wash it. So after that, we have to give the dogs some medicine. Yeah, we forgot to give them medicines this morning. And if you guys are new to my channel, we have a lot of dogs. This is rock star. What's up, boy? What's up, boy? Oh, she's not here. They made me do it now. Maybe they went out, but we will be giving them medicine. If you guys are new, they have Lyme disease. So right now, we're there on medication. We took them to the vet. But actually, the medicine is not here. They made me do it now. Ah, maybe they went out. But we will be giving them medicine. If you guys are new, they have Lyme disease. So right now, we're there on medication. We have to give it. But actually, the medication is working good. And I think they're actually back to normal. Like it's crazy. They're eating again. They're playing again. They're basically back to normal right now. But we need to work on their weight loss because they lost their weight. So we have to feed them a lot again. Yeah, they lost a lot of weight. And we're on a mission to get them fat again. Because they were very fat. Yeah. So now, we're washed the bike, give them the medicine. And then what's the third thing we need to do? Oh, we're going to Changge. You never been there, right? No, what's the Changge? Changge, it's like, it just happens every Monday and Friday here in the Brangai. They put all the different type of store in food store or like that. So it's basically like a fair.

Yeah, it's a little... Some Japanese. I think it's Chinese. Well, yeah, noodles with sourdings and then vegetable. This is called patola. Patola? Patola. So what is misoah? Is this noodles? Yes, this one. What the heck is this? This is like paper. It's so crunchy. Can you eat this by itself? No. I feel like you can... You have to cook that. Well, so how long does it take to make? You had a boil it or... No, it's easy. It's just gonna take like five minutes. So we got garlic on... Patto col tomatoes. Patola? Since you requested we had garlic. Oh, finally. Finally need some garlic. Hey, Marmos. What's up, Vera? What's up, Vera? Oh, yeah, we put the garlic first. Yeah. And then onion. Finally. It already smells amazing, huh? You haven't even cooked. It's just a smell of the garlic and onion. There's no... the only meat is the sourdings. Can I see? We'll flavor it. Spicy. So you put the sauce in it too? Yeah. Oh, okay. So the sauce stayed that up now and then you add the sourdings. Yeah. Okay. The other sourdings and then the veggies. Mmm. Sounds good to me. Sounds delicious. Smells delicious. Wow. Oh my gosh. So windy. So now this is the final result? Yes. Wow. Looks good. Yes. Smells fishy. This is one of the most Filipino's cook in the world. How much was this to make it all? This one is just shit. I actually... I actually spent maybe two dollars for all of this. 100 pesos for all of it? Or less. Or less, okay. Because the sourdings is one to six. The vegetable is like 25. And the condiments. So it's like less than two dollars. Miso. It looks good. Smells good. I can't wait to try it. As you can see, I just prepared this five star meal. Did you really? So I did not cook this but we're going to taste it. So everybody gets one bowl. So we're just going to taste it because... Looks enough, not? Just one more. One more. Chill out. It's a little hot, guys. Do you have any miso? What is it again? It's rice noodles. No, it's just a noodle. Super thin noodles. Very thin. It's not like spaghetti. It's made of sardines. Yeah, sardines. What else is in there now? A patolla. Okay, okay. So it's a very windy day. So it's perfect. Beautiful night. Beautiful night. Beautiful. Everything. So guys, thank you Lord for everything you've done. Thank you for this journey, Lord. Thank you for this fool. Thank you for the kind people we met today. Thank you for the viewers. Thank you for everything, Lord. You blessed us so much more than we need. And thank you for keeping our dogs safe and healthy. And thank you for protecting over us. Thank you, Lord. Thank you for this day. Bless everything. Protect them. And please, Lord, have a relationship with them. And the name of Jesus, I pray, amen. Amen. So guys, we have it. I'm very excited. That's a big chunk of garlic in there. So. Be careful. You're supposed very good now. Spicy or hot? Hot. It's good. It's got super fishy texture, though. I'm just tasting a lot of fish. But maybe that's how the dish is supposed to be. Is it supposed to be like this? It is. Okay. So let's try without the fish. You like patola? Mmm. The vegetables good. Patola? Very good. Mmm. But I will say guys, this is definitely isn't my style. It's not because of the chef. It's not like she messed it up. I love this dish, what do you mean? It's a good tasting dish. I just don't see myself eating this again. I'll give the salad six out of ten. But since you made it really good, I'll bump it up to a seven point five. Because I'll finish this. I'll end up finishing it. All right. No. The chef needs a taste of food. Obviously, I would love this. I'll give this up then, without even anything in there. Wow, ten. Bye, Ace. Mmm. Very good. Sorry guys, for the low lighting is getting dark out, but... Yeah. We really started to get dark out. I'm going to start with the dark out. I'm going to start with the dark out. We really started cooking solid. Yeah. My gosh, now I love this. It's a solid eight for me. Solid eight? Okay. But yeah guys, that's going to conclude it for today's video.
