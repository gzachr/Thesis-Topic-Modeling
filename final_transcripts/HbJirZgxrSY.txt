 Hello everybody! Welcome to trying some more Filipino food. Keyword? Trying. Trying to try. Trying to try. We wanted to try some crispy pasta here. Because you know, crispy pasta. We've heard of it. We actually tried some in Dubai. But we haven't tried it here yet in the Philippines. They were out unfortunately. Or didn't have it. It was like one of their like big things on the menu. It's in right. There's a big picture on the top of the menu of it. So we're like, oh okay whatever. We'll just try some pork spare ribs or something. They look pretty good on there. And then some some bangus. They didn't have the bangus. So we're like, oh okay. They have bangus that we see bangus on every menu at every restaurant in the entire country and they didn't have bangus. And one of the desserts we tried to get didn't have that as well. We hadn't had this issue for like the last few weeks. But we had it a lot before that they didn't have like Italianies not having spaghetti with meatballs and garlic bread. Chicken and waffle place not having waffles. So this is a serious issue that needs to be addressed. So we're starting to go fun me link in the description. You can go donate to it. We promise we will use it to have it. Yes. Thank you very much. And Mesa, please fix your pasta problem. Thank you very much. We'll judge your all meat platter now. All meat. Yeah. So we went from getting pasta to getting whatever the other thing. To getting Filipino seafood. So now we're going to get some Filipino barbecue. Just satisfied. We... You guys have watched our food reviews. We never critique anything. We just go, whoa, whoa, whoa. It's been a roller coaster. Mesa, you're getting a bad review today. We'll see how the food is. Yeah. Is that the J-L-I-P of the Philippines? Is his name Mesa? Oh wow. The focus is really terrible. Oh. Alright. This is called Sago Goulomb. And today it's a dessert slash drink thing and we're gonna try it. Oh, the foods here. Oh. Thank you. Did you see the plain rice? Oh my God. We ordered garlic rice. Okay. Well, we got a free thing that they gave us for our disappointment. This is our meat platter. There's a lot of meats on there. I don't know what they are, but they're covered in sauce. This video is turned into a complete disaster. Let's try my Sago Jalaboon. It's a very hard day to pronounce. I don't know if you're supposed to drink it or... They could have just called it like... Ball juice. Ball iced tea juice. Yeah. Let's try it. It'd be so much easier to pronounce. Wow. The balls are bigger than the straw. Oh, you can shoot it though. I'm gonna write in my throat. Okay. Wow. It's tea. Like strong tea. Very graphic. I'd be like tea. You might like this. It's pretty strong. What was he called again? Sago Jalaboon. It's basically a stronger tea with boba balls in there. And ice. It's not bad. It's pretty good. Nice. All right. We got a lot of meats here. We'll just smoke in some meats. It's a zuck would be probably. We really reference zuck a lot recently. Zuck's our new Urban Rescue Ranch. Okay. I didn't know what I expected. The picture had a banana leaf on it, so I thought we're gonna have like the epic banana leaf barbecue style, but it's just kind of a plate. If the audio randomly changes, it's because this phone died and we switched to a different camera that doesn't use these mites. So I'm gonna try one of these sticks. Don't know what it is. There's a little bit of fat tube at the end there, but maybe it's pork. I think it's pork. That's pretty good. Oh, I think it's pretty good. It's similar to the one we had at the summer market. Yeah, it is pretty similar to that one. It's a little skinnier, but tasty. Look at this nice setup we have today for our... Of course, it's so official that we use a microphone. The quality is going up, up, up. So we have a garlic rice taste test. It's actually very garlicy. Wow, that's almost as garlicy as the Texas Roadhouse one. This might be the bed, one of the better garlic rice that we have since it's actually garlicy. So I think you need to try a skewer. Steal-squeal. Steal-y. Oh! That's very good. This is pretty tasty. The sauce is a bit sweet, but it's not too overpowering. See that this is some sort of beef. Also that we're having. I don't know if it's beef or what it is. Looks like beef. Yeah. Oh, that's very good. Oh, it's very tender. Very tender. Yeah, you have to get your beef to race ratio very good. Wow, that's impressive, I know. I should probably should have cut it, but I don't really care. You ready to beef this thing? Beef it, beef it. Oh, that's a big bite. Oh. Oh, it's a big bite. I'm just going to film like to that one. The pork one. It's like steak. Oh. Yeah, the meat actually does. Yeah. It's a little more steaky with some nice, whatever the sauce is. It's kind of like a sweet meat sauce. It's got like a little tang at the end. Pretty good. This leak just penetrated that. We see this leak right here. What the hell is that? It's actually in it. Was it inside of it? They make a taste better. It's good. I would say that it's a 5 out of 10 leak right there. 5 out of 10. 5 out of 10. Top 10 leaks you've had in your life? Yes. At least top 6 leaks, actually. Okay. I don't know what the heck this thing is, but it's very big. Is it the same as this one? Oh, it's very tender off the end. Is it pork belly? This is a bone right there. There's a bone. This is not boneless bangus, that's for sure. Oh, these are pretty good. These are right here at least like fat. So I'm not sure. This must be pork belly then. This is a bone. Fat cube. Fat cube. Delicious. Okay. It's very weird using three utensils at the same time. Pork belly, I think. Huh? Very chewy. Lagala flavor. This is our flavor. And there's a crunch on the outside. I like the way your caressing that. Wow. I like the way the cubes move from tag-a-tied to them. These cubes are quite odd. All right, let's move onto the chicken, I guess. They're a bone in this chick. I can't tell. Oh, wow. Oh, yeah, there's something. Oh, yeah, there's a spine right there. I don't think this one has a bone. No, boneless. I would eat that hole if I were you. Okay. It's like when you're eating Indian curry and then you take it by now to something and you're like, oh, is this a, no, it has a bone. It'll break your teeth. Chicken and garlic rice. Look at that. So like my rice to chicken ratio is pretty good on this one. Would you agree? I think you need more rice. There, that's right. No. All right, this is really hard. I feel like there's only one way to do it. It must go. Not as flavorful. No. Because the others, not, got significantly less actually, but it's still good. Just chicken. Not impressive after. We should have started with the chicken. True. We should have the most basic food. This is the most flavorful part right here. I heard. Okay. Let me cut it quick. Please. Harder. Use your skewer. Oh, I cut it. Now I guess our free are free thing. We were awarded this because they don't have enough stuff. Yes. They do have vegetables though. Don't worry. I have no idea what this is. Is it sour? We have to try whatever the heck this thing is. Great. Let's put some on that vegetable. I'll grab a bean. Bean for the bean boy. And I am a bean boy. And a pepper. I think, I don't know what that thing is. It looks like a mackerel. Do you want to eat this thing? I've never seen it in my life. So we'll eat this directly. Okay. What is it? I almost lost it. Here we go. I'm just... What is happening in my mouth? What is happening in my tongue? What is happening in my tongue? What is happening in my mouth? What is that? Is it spicy? No. I don't know what it is. It's like numbing my mouth but it's not hot. It's like I just put on flavored mouthwash in my mouth. It didn't even touch my tongue but it just slowly my tongue started getting coated in whatever it is. It's like num. Oh that's not good. I think I'd give that like a 10 out of 10 on the not goodness. Yeah same. Wow. Imagine if we didn't know that was and they were just eating and we're like suddenly our tongue just goes numb. We be so confused. All right are we going to get any more surprises? No. What this thing is? Pepper that has tomato chunks in it. Oh that's this is tomato? Yeah it's a yellow tomato I guess. I like tomatoes. I like tomatoes. We really hate tomatoes and a zucchini and a bean. Beans are tasty. The zucchini is good and um is that a pea pod? I don't know. That's a weird organ in it or something. It has an organ? Yeah I think so. The heck is this thing? Oh oh it's not like a sandpaper texture. It tastes like a bean though. It does taste like a bean. But it's kind of all balls on it. Oh that's the eggs. It's the eggs of the bean. And that's what we got here for our barbecue Filipino adventure. We have some desserts coming as well. My tongue still feels a little weird. What was it? We're going to eat this up and get our desserts and then we'll continue. Okay so we have some spane spane. Spane spane and some crispy leche flan which I didn't know was a thing but maybe it's just this place is special. Yeah I didn't know the thing either. It looks just like some taro. Why did they have a fork if they all have spoon? I'm not sure. All right let's try these first. These are very intriguing. I mean look at what that looks like. Oh it's about to fall off my fork. Please don't. How is that leche flan and how is it not too wrong? That's what I don't understand. It better be really soft on the inside. Let's ding it. Oh oh it flopped. Don't eat it. Don't eat it. Oh I can really odd. The inside kind of has zero flavor. It's not very sweet either. No. It's just kind of like a lumpy wrap around some sort of like a cream cheese almost. Yeah but cream cheese that isn't very good to be honest. I mean it doesn't taste bad. It's just kind of underwhelming. That would say. Definitely. I was excited for this. It's all right. Not bad. It's not that expensive so. Oh all right well we do have spane spane here. Luckily we really comments about that. If you guys don't understand that you will have to watch our old videos to get the reference. Yes. All right. Seppin-seppin. Oh no. No. Off my hand. Seppin-seppin off my hand. Let's do it. Oh it kind of melts in your mouth. In Dubai you chewed it forever. Yeah. This one instantly melted. We always got the buffet ones. So that's why. These ones yeah. Oh god. Pretty solid. I like that. The two sides it was called or something so they have the. Wow look at that. Oh they're fat. They're chunky boy. Look at how chunky they are. That is a very yellow ice cream. Is it cheese ice cream? It looks kind of cheesy. But these are like lumpia looking things with the rice cake inside which is interesting. Let's pop these. Hold there. One. Very one. Oh that's weird. Hmm. All right good. It's weird that it gushes out. Ready for fanciness? You have to go super fancy mode and go a bit then. Oh wait we have to do it like this. Do you feel really weird doing that with something so mushy? Yeah. I just feel so. Those are definitely better than this. They are. They have like this creaminess too almost even though they're like a rice cake. It was pretty good. I do like that a lot. But I was saying about the spring roll version. It's weird that it's crispy. Usually the stuff inside of the spring roll is like mushy and then but it just turned in the sticky and you actually have to chew it in the inside part which is not too. Yeah. I can't like score it enough. Very very. Gosh. The rice cake has penetrated my throat. It was in the word penetrating a lot. It's a bit weird. And this was weird. What is it? Is that all right? Yeah it's like a scrambled egg in there. Oh yummy. A scrambled egg. All right we got a turon here. Professional cut here. This turon was only like a dollar. That is much different than eight dollars or whatever the other one. Yeah 12 dollars. Yeah and this one is actually like a little under two dollars. So we are judging this. Oh look at that. You know fancy that looks wow. All right let's try some turon. With some liquid flantsauce. Oh I find. Oh. Really sweet. Oh that's good. All right it's good. You know the funny thing is it's just as good as the 12 dollar one. Wow. Are you saying that expensive things like that are a myth. We're paid for the ambiance. Oh. The frozen and the Latin piano. The music piano. Yes. That was our experience here with our Filipino barbecue. We had a lot of food and time to eat it all ourselves. Let's do it. The camera was just magically floating across the other side of the table. Yeah. Yeah I don't know what the heck. Yeah overall it was pretty good food. Pretty good. The restaurant situation was a little disappointing. Yeah the people seemed decently friendly about it but they didn't have some of the big things. You know like hollow, hollow, bangus, pata. Those are like Filipino classics right there. Hey we got this done.
