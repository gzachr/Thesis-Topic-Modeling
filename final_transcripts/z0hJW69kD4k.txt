 This is beautiful. So fun fact, I learned that VGC is to be like a base or a fort for the US Army or the Army. I'm not mistaken. So another interesting fact about VGC is that. You know, seeing earlier that it seems very... VGC is very like... feels like New York kind of. I mean, a lot of international brands are here. Like, I'm seeing many American brands. Wow. As Arstern Martin in VGC. Wow. Wow. That is so cool. Fifth Avenue. One thing I'm noticing about VGC is that the streets are named like New York. Like, they have the same name in pattern of New York. So you have six avenue, fifth avenue and all that. Just like you have it in New York. Wow. Nice. Really is a global city. Interesting. Everywhere is so clean, so like... Every needs, like, how they do it. I had to have a lens for model bikes and all that. I'm actually here on this Saturday. I was supposed to call me yesterday but I couldn't. It rained. So we are in the middle of... well, not in the middle of. We are in the rainy season and all that. It's been raining a lot. In fact, the second day when we got to the Philippines, it rained and the affected. We couldn't really go out when the evening. And we couldn't do much and all that. So I'm hoping, hopefully, fingers crossed to have great weather today. Ah, the street is closed out here. Ah, this is the famous 3D screen. Wow. Interesting. Excuse me, my friend. Please, what's going on there? Just the weekend of the Philippines, actually. Oh, okay. Ah, interesting. So the closest streets of... I can't see the weekends. Every weekend.

The weekend activities. So you see people taking pictures. People have a great time. Nice. It's really cool. And the light is... Wow. This is cool. Because, guys, this is a major commercial center of the Philippines. Like, after my car, BGC, I guess is the second most important commercial community. And they literally closed off the streets. Wow. This is so cool. I don't know what I'm ever wrong. I don't think they do this anywhere. Even in New York. How you doing? Later. Come in. You see that. And then that testament to the warmness.

Let's see how much of it looks like Times Square. Does it really look like Times Square? One boniface here ice strips. So another fun fact. I heard that boniface here kind of reminds of the fooling now, but he is one of his, one of the great revolutionaries of Philippine independence or something like that. Yeah. He's a very notable figure in Philippine history. So that's why this whole city is named after him. Cool. Oh, this place. Sea Rex. Why did the chicken cross the road? So this is the ground path.

They love to have a good time. Who's that? It's dying out. It feels like a jungle inside the city. I was making those sounds. Nice. Yeah. Wow. My opinion, I think, DGC, easily puts the Philippines, apart from any developed country in the world. I don't think, I mean, how else do you want to mention right now? New York, London, Tokyo, Philippines, DGC calls any open. Any metric you want to use to measure it. Wow. This is just mind-blowing. Wow. All the major international brands are in DGC. Like, that's just pissed. McDonald's, Fiji2, Wendy's. It's really amazing, really. I can't think about it. I'm not sure if I can say that. I'm not sure. It's amazing, really. I can't think about it. The fact that I get that international brands that are in Manila that are not even in the UK. Can you beat that? They have their own, I mean, there's Ferrari's in BGC. Ferrari's in BGC Lamborghini, Rolls Royce. So many, this is a residence. Okay. So you have a combination of condo units, like residential and commercial companies and all that. In BGC. Wow. This is so cool. We have a lot of banks too. A lot of banks and Philippines. Only way. See in your new... Oh, oh, oh, she fell. So sorry about that. Wow. I don't see the end in your heart, self-like. Should have one more protected G.M. And this place is a bit uphill. How much does that? How you doing? Yeah, it's a bit uphill. Yeah, it's like an inclined, going uphill. I'm going to few calls. Going uphill on those. I'm off this line though. Interesting thing about BGC also, it seems to be like the number one nail tin pot of cultures. Take it easy. Wow. Whoa. Easy. She fell again. Oh, it's another person. She's brave. She stood up again. She fell. She stand up just herself up. Whoa, they're falling. Wow. It's me again. Oh, sorry. She shouldn't give up. She should keep trying. She'll get used to it. Okay, so I guess this guy teaches you how to roll our skates. How fast was today? I'll learn another day. Cool. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Wow. Wow. So like I was saying earlier, VGC is top mountains. So like I was saying earlier, so here in VGC you have so many cultures represented like to have Koreans, Japanese, Indians, Chinese, Filipinos of course. Americans. I think it's not important of Asian country. In fact, you see the influence of all these countries, all these nations, on VGC. So in fact, you see the influence of all these cultures, all these nations in the VGC. Like Japanese, for example, you see a lot of Japanese establishments here. It's a poshimal.
