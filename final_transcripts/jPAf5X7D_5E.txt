 So it's been five years since we were here. It's the first festival in the Philippines, meeting with two together. So we're going back to Ormok again today to see the house yet again. But also we're going to go to Mandu for today. We may get something or two, we have to see what's there. But we're going to share with you places of furniture in the Philippines in one of the biggest department stores or furniture stores if you would. Mandu for you. So another jackfruit is fallen. We get the size of this one. Wow. Huge. I think I heard this for the other day. I thought it was a football or something or basketball. Turns out it was the jackfruit that fell in the middle of the night. Probably best let the experts open this one. I might make a mess again and get all sticky. I follow you advice if I do and use all along my hands and the knife for hand. So we have two jackfruit left in this tree. Two big ones. But if you look up, you might just see there's another one there. It's a little bit smaller but it will grow. And we'll be soon ready to harvest. This is the second jackfruit tree over there. A couple more at the top. And a few. A bit lower down. I saw what's going on. That's a fake spider. It's poison art. Tarantula. Baby Tarantula. You know what? Jillian the best friend. I trust you. Run away. We're just waiting for it to come down. Who's on the top bank? Jillian. Get a glass. I'm going to get a glass. You want me to stand on the top bank. Put a glass over it. Jillian. Oh my goodness. She's going to do it. I've got no point. She's doing it. It's moving. Are you up? Are you up? Are you up? Are you up? Are you up? You stand now. You want it? She's gone. It's a dead. It's a dead. It's playing dead. You have to strip it out. Put it down on the top bank. Keep it up. I can tell you you're doing it. Where are you going? Oh. Here it comes. It's still alive. It's behind it, it's behind it, it's behind it. Who's better still get it? It's behind it. Oh you're just good. You're just good. Just sweep out of them. Just sweep out. You're just good. You're just good. You're just good. You're just good. You're just good. You're just good. You're just good. This is when you're looking at 15-215 for the Harrier. So these seats, these cushions, you can remove it you need to. It's nice to be no two-seater. Cam no, two-seater. So, it's a bit more expensive than the other one. This is the sewing line now. That's the two-seater version. And it's Boston Home Theater. Boston Home Theater. We do a cleaner on the edges. Right this colour, all different. What's that, choices? We would have to talk to them, colour choices. Fully up on the screen. But it's cacky, it's like cacking. Do you mean we like this 60-to-dining set, don't you? Maybe we're dialing. This is your favourite is that? So it's 35-300, which is quite expensive. But 25% off, 26,000 pesos. So it's not too bad for the money. The quality is nice and it's a good size. You can imagine having a nice family meal here. Six people, it's bigger now. They're ginger like this, do you? Do four. Do four I say, do four, I'm the only fours always. So going out and stuff, so what just the... What is that down? Probably one to go this way. Oh, oh, do let me fall. Then by the way, the one who falls over here. But here's one to be famous, quick pick here. Quite a good selection, one of the best. It's a plane. Yeah, a plane. It's been all this since Etocklack. When is it likely to come back up the power? I don't have a day, probably, for the middle of the night. No internet. No lights. So this one don't work because the brand out, however, one of our solar lights is still operational. So we've got a little bit of light. So this is what we're going to do. We're going to get washed in the dark. Hopefully the power comes up by later tonight. Otherwise we're going to be eating, washing, and everything else in the dark. Welcome to the Philippines province. You do get bad acts now and then. It's not my first one. We experienced them before in 2016 and 18. They're a bit inconvenient, but you get used to them. So just break out the candles. And enjoy. So we're quite successful in the city today. We bought quite a lot of furniture for our house. It's on order. We're ready in about a month or two. Should be perfect timing really. And we're looking forward to finishing the house. So what have we been doing today? We've been just roaming around in the city. We opened up our windows of city. We saw cookie and cream again. And what's that you got? A fan? A fan. I just keep calling when there's no power. Mandari foam, however, 25% discount sale. Sent for July to 17th of July. And 25% off everything in the store. So we had to take advantage of it really. Try to furnish our house for when it's ready. So it's in the lights. I've just come back on the powers. So the power's back. What's the first thing you're going to do? So the power. The power is back. It's back. We have power. We have light. We have fans. It's quite a warm, human night tonight. But we now have fans. I was going to sit outside all night in the cold. Well, not in the cold in the rain. But now we have fans. So that's good. And we can also eat inside instead of outside. But it's just something to get used to here in the Philippines and the province. And we love it. And my glass is because I was again a bit sore. I have a contact lenses in all day. I just need to rest them a little bit. Also, if I'm going to go to Ormok City, you're going to have a look at the opticians to try and find a source for contact lenses. Continuous contact lenses. So part of our video is just to bring you the cost of living in the Philippines. But also give you an idea how you can obtain things. Some things that you might not think are available. The treasures are starting to fall down. Migos are starting to lose their way. I don't know how to do this fat pig legs. But boy, human but boy. How many times does somebody come to get weird? Because it's so nice, it's reasonably cheap. I always brush. This is from me. I'm going to put it on. It's brought us a sweet potato. Oh wow, look at this. It's a sweet and cheap. It's a sweet and cheap. It's a sweet and cheap but a sweet potato. It's a house in Ormok City, isn't it? Yeah. People will look up there and they've blanched some sweet potato. And they just harvest and they just give us. These here? Great ones. My very own garden in Ormok City. Oh, well, well, talking potato head. Philippines is fantastic, a growing fantastic. So we're going to eat very shortly. I think it'll be commotic tonight, sweet potato. I love sweet potato in the Philippines. I will see what else we're going to have. See you soon.
