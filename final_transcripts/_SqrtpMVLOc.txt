 But you're Friday. The freshest. Happy Holidays, everyone. Happy Holidays. When will you be there? When will you be there? Christmas time. Happy Holidays. We are Nelia Christmas. But let's been talking about this because you guys keep sending it to her. And all I see is just, this is what I see. I don't know what this is. But it's a bunch of cops. It is. We have seen one video of like a Filipino cop, right? Like singing. Like a band. We've seen a holland band. Actually. The Jewish bus. The Jewish bus. The Jewish bus. Well, I said that this is Christmassy. No, that was the army. Like that was the army. That was the army. That was the army. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is like the actual Metropolitan Police. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But this is like Christmassy apparently. Yes. Okay. This is like fit for like a choir festival. And you're about to see who I am. Let's see. Let's come in from there. I thought he was recording. No, no, no, no. Is that singing? What the fuck? Oh, but he sounds real. Oh, but he sounds real. Oh, but he sounds real. Yeah, come on. That is crazy. Come on. What the fuck? No, here's the thing. Who came like, like, did they just sit there and be like, guys, guys, guys, who wants to be a soprano? No, they say, and then be like, no, no, no, be an alto today. They're not cops. They're the singing police. You know, they go around people like that. It's like hit a B flat sharp. No, no, you're flat. You're flat. Find. Hit a E minor 7. Now. Flat. You're fired. You look suspicious to me. Get over here now. C7. Now. Oh, my god. That is incorrect. Back to straight to jail. You know what I mean? Straight away. Straight away. How do they have the... What the? And there was like... This is after dinner. Like, they were already eaten and stuff. I'm like a bunch of sports and pictures. Also, the acoustics in that room. Because they sing, sing, man. They sing, sing, sing. Oh, my. Oh, there's somebody directing and stuff. Like, come on, y'all. Who came up with this stuff? Who said after? After they were having like... Usually, I just don't understand. You were sitting down, you're eating, and then everybody is just having a merry old time because it's Christmas. This is probably the yearly... Like, get together, right? Like, everybody from all departments get together and they have a blast. And then they already had dinner and then like, instead. Instead of like talking about current events of the universe. No, we're gonna... Who wants to be an alto? Says Tanyada in her thing or all of their thing. One of those are plays. I could be. I don't know what that means. They also have a bunch of sports and pictures. I don't know that it's maybe Marecia Poga. Maybe it's two old. That's MJ, right? Probably presuming that's Kobe. I don't know. It's really funny though, because like... They sing, sing. Like, this is not like... This is... That's being nice. Oh, you know, like cops, whatever. Guys, this is crazy. That's like, quiet standard. It is. That's what I'm saying. I'm like reading it as well. And they're like reading it as well. And this guy and the Conor. He's the one directing the whole thing. What are the last names? I think it is. Yeah, what...what are you doing? I don't know. Maybe the... The place that they sort of... The message that sent this through. So this was the metropolis in Timpolice. Like, this is like... I don't know what district or anything. That's good. That's so good. This is a service for the people. Bo-bada, what...of filter? J-j-j-s, bro, you know what I mean? What was that? I think it was up with your Facebook, man. I have never...I've never go in there. So people are saying things to our regional director for always supporting us. And our resident conductor, Romeo Delta Mike. Okay. Romeo Delta. Romeo Delta, you are the man. He is him. Yeah, he is him. That is so crazy. What are people saying in the comments? I really don't understand how people just get together and be like, yeah, this is what we're doing, after all. That's crazy, bro. In our work, in our work, you know what I mean? And you know what I meant to say, I was like, now you... Our channel can be used as evidence, mate. But like, this happens fairly often. Like, this isn't that rarer of an occurrence, which is even more mental, because I guarantee you. Like, again, in comparison to other parts of the world, I'm not...I'm not trying to be like, you know, oh, it's so amazing. It is amazing. But like, in other parts of the world, you wouldn't really...that wouldn't really happen. No, no, no, no. And most importantly, it wouldn't even happen with that frequency. Because this isn't just like one in a million. Oh, this has happened before. They probably do this every Christmas. Honestly, they probably do this every special event. There's probably, at some division, at some division. Yeah, yeah, they are here doing people. Yeah, they are here doing people. They are doing like covers of songs in karaoke nights and like, there is social get-together... This is a service for the people. And only now is like, the world learning about it and catching up about it, because of cameras. Yeah, that's right. Because this has probably been happening like that for 40 years. For years. Yeah. For years. That frequency is just, you know, back then there's no video cameras that easy. You couldn't publish it that easy. But now that's why you're seeing all these videos go around. They're so sick. It's getting mental, mate. Okay, whoever recorded that, I'm decided to post it in the interwebs. That is the real hero. They call it BFP singing ambassadors. So maybe they're all the cops that sort of sing. That is so cool. But like, they sing sing. Like, that could be another career for them. That is so freaking cool, you know. I know. Let us know what you guys thought about it. And... Police by day, singer by night. Let's go!
