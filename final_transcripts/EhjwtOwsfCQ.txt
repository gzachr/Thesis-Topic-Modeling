what's up guys hello everybody my name is 
Alina and my name is Justin and today we  
are doing popular Filipino snack review so 
as you can see last night we actually went  
to a local supermarket here called landmark 
and we buy a whole bunch of snack amount for  
around 523 pesos in total so today Alina 
will do the honest okay you ready yes
so we've got a whole bunch of Filipino snacks 
and I must confess before when we first came  
to Philippines and I cooked so far in this six 
months we've never actually tried any of the  
videos that I think in general we are very 
uh health conscious so we try to avoid like  
snacks because in Cantonese it's something called 
Hey means like bad for your skin and everything  
let's try to avoid everything but today our 
cheat meal day yeah today forget about health  
forget about being healthy we're eating Filipino 
snacks today in total 420 something pesos okay  
let's try from start from this one this is 
plain salted chincharon my exportation is so  
long I don't know I don't know okay let's 
try yeah let's keep it a low expectation
all right let's give it a shot at mahi's crackling 
vegetarian chicharron smells like a chips
yeah it's like a chips it's not like 
the typical things like chips though  
this is more like a thick skin I think 
for me this one is okay so I'll give a  
six out of ten you I think for me it's 
four four yeah because it's so funny  
it's so oily do you understand more I try 
that when you say I try a second piece and  
I kind of like it more so add an extra point 
seven out of 10 for me oh really yeah for me
speaking of bacterias did you know that 99 of 
the bacteria in this world is actually good  
and only one percent what you got pathogen 
strains are bad bacteria since we were kids  
we were always told that all bacterias are bad 
our parents always educate us to stay hygienic  
otherwise you'll attract diseases caused by bad 
bacteria such as salmonella and streptococcus if  
you think about it our body is like a universe 
there are 250 billion stars in the Milky Way  
in our universe you might call me a nerd but back 
when I was in high school I was actually the vice  
president of astronomy club I bought itself it's 
like a universe with 38 trillion bacterias living  
inside us so how can bacterias be good for your 
gut it aids digestion and help regulate metabolism  
for your skin certain bacteria promotes tissue 
healing and adaptive immunity alright so how can  
we get these bacterias by definition probiotics 
are live microorganisms that when administered  
inadequate amounts confer health benefits on a 
host most fermented foods and beverages such as  
yogurt kimchi miso have these bacteria but most 
of these items don't survive the trip through  
digestion against stomach acid that's why I've 
been trying this product called seats ds01 daily  
symbiotic it is heavily studied and backed by 
scientific research and has 24 strains of broad  
spectrum probiotic and Prebiotic formulated 
for Digestive guts and promotes heart health  
and maintains blood cholesterol levels already 
in the normal range it has a capture and capture  
designed to protect the probiotic from stomach 
acid digestion enzymes and biosots to ensure  
viability through all stages of digestion so that 
they reach intestine for delivery into the cologne  
you know typical Market known probiotics needs 
to be refrigerated but when you're traveling  
that can be quite difficult in a challenge but a 
ds01 symbiotic doesn't need to be because of its  
dry cap in cap system that prevents bacteria 
from oxygen moisture and heat it's also got  
chlorophylline exterior tissue bacterium light 
if you're interested in getting seeds ds01  
daily symbiotic then use the code projectware at 
checkout to get 20 off your first months of order
my choice next time okay [Music] you already 
know I know I wanted something red yeah so  
next here we're trying the reason I got this one 
which is called Peewee sizzling barbecue because
so I just thought the name is quite 
interesting that's why I got this one oh
I like this one because it's a texture like uh 
pillows it's fluffy with air inside and it's  
small I don't know if it's just made it but it 
is a bit of mushroom inside it exactly tastes  
like a barbecue I mean it's like mushroom 
with mushroom so this is I give seven seven  
out of ten yeah but I don't know because 
it's anyway it's better than before okay
I can buy this for me I think this this tastes 
good it tastes like mushrooms okay okay I know  
if I give this dressing just and eat everything 
let's try next one this okay uh piatto's is it  
is it how you pronounce yeah and what is this 
favor sour cream and onion okay your favorite  
onions I think for me uh if it's chips it's okay 
but I don't like onions in general let's see  
okay smell it smells like chips yeah it 
smells like normal chips one two three go hmm
it's like a lace it's like prank boost 
yeah it's like for me it's like lace  
it's just normal for the chips 
yeah I think solid yeah let's go  
um I give seven I like before more to be honest 
because this is like just simple normal lace  
seven for you I mean in general I like sour cream 
that potato chips and this tastes like it's like  
like Pringles so seven seven out of ten I would 
say and now I want to try something that will like  
spice up this chocolate oh no I'm gonna get 
the potato chips because it's spicy barbecue  
flavored and spicy but I think this one it 
will be tasty like oh my God it's so big  
how can I eat this it's so big you want 
to change yes change okay one two three
oh it's not spicy a little bit I don't feel 
spicy at all a little bit the aftertaste has  
got a little bit spicy actually I'm gonna get one 
more your review oh I don't know I guess same like  
before seven yeah just normal cheap compared 
to a barbecue snack that we had before I think  
about barbecue snack with but uh this one is chips 
yeah spicy chips so for me it's like yeah seven I  
think it's okay for me okay next next which one 
are you trying mine done yeah okay let's try  
this one roller coaster why is it called roller 
coaster I think because it's raining yeah potato  
Rings cheddar cheese taste like every snacks here 
it's around six pesos yeah it's so affordable and  
this is we bought it from the supermarket can 
you imagine buying it like uh like the build  
shops on the road that would be even cheaper 
yeah I'm sure this is the ring I'll give you
okay let's try
do you feel cheese it's too light it's like 
eating air I think I need to get like whole  
bone eat all of it and then I can taste a very 
strong cheese add this is cheese flavor to  
be honest if I go to market I won't buy this 
one because I don't feel any like extra like  
super taste yeah I think for me if I choose 
between like a cheese ball compared to this  
like those ones full of cheese and this 
one I would choose the cheese one because  
the cheeseboard has a strong Taste of cheese this 
one is just like it tastes like air free I'll give  
it a four okay next one you're talking on my turn 
Okay so next on the list we have the golden sweet  
corn so I just thought this the packaging looks 
really good that's why I got it okay whoa oh
it tastes so good oh my God it smells so good 
you know I always say tastes good because  
Santa is good it's like a smell good okay 
let's try that's really so tasty smell okay
[Music]  
like 10 to 10 10 to 10. wow they're so tasty wow 
it's so tasty hey I didn't expect it will be so  
tasty this reminds me of the cheese ball but with 
corn powder but it tastes amazing I would give it  
a 10 out of 10. this is my favorite for the house 
yes in the Philippines yeah me too very delicious
hey yes spicy Seafood spicy prawns curls  
yeah it smells good oh it smells so good 
so strong I love it one two three go
a little bit spicier than the last one 
I think spicy the more I put in my mouth  
the more the spice the more I keep it 
here the more you become spicy yeah
it's like a spicy chip there it's okay one to ten 
for me I think this is the nine for me oh my gosh  
there's a knife for me because it has shrimp you 
know in Hong Kong we eat shrimp noodles this is  
like shrimp flavored chips I love it and it's 
spicy I love a bit of cake oh let's start let's  
try vegetarian okay let's try the vegetarian one 
veggie I like veggie so wait does it doesn't mean  
this is like fried oh I'm thinking is it fried 
veggies inside but I see the the like the green  
fingers here all right I'm a bit excited for this 
I don't think I'm a bit nervous because like I  
never had a good impression with veggies and snack 
so oh it's a green all right let's give it a try
cute I hope it's more spicy
wow they're so strange
I see you like it I think you like it this one it 
tastes a bit like a corn one in a way that that  
kind of texture but this one is a bit sweeter 
I would say and I don't know it just has this  
interesting taste I don't know how to describe it 
but it doesn't taste like veggie at all it doesn't  
taste like any veggie for me it's something 
strange taste but it's tasty and it's so soft  
yeah okay I'm So Soft waiting what do you say 
raising I'll say six to ten six to ten yeah we  
mean six to ten you need to give six four ten oh 
six seven eight I mean six out of ten [Laughter]  
for me yeah this is a nine oh it's quite tasty I  
love it I like this kind of texture 
the powder it's so interesting okay  
okay next one clever bread Clover okay so this 
is two it has two cheese taste and barbecue taste  
yeah so here the packaging says it's a corn snack 
okay Justin will try barbecue I will try cheese
um okay next one and we give the honest review
flavor it doesn't have a lot of flavor I 
think the powder is not enough for some  
maybe they didn't shake it properly 
but it tastes like chipped corn corn  
chips away for me I think two because 
it looks better than it's eggs and I  
don't feel different so I didn't make like 
two different flavor exactly the same yes  
very subtle difference I would say rating and 
after this I'm gonna drink one I don't know  
yeah I think we made this one it's a yeah this 
one is a two for me too it's unfortunately I think  
it's the lowest for me so far yeah so next we're 
gonna try the piatos cheese flavor potato chips so  
looks good the packaging has cheese I love 
cheese snack that's what I'm saying okay
um it doesn't have any taste unfortunately  
yeah for me this doesn't have any taste I think 
that'll give this sorry it's even lower than the  
last one it's one one for me this one well no 
it's better than last one so I give this like  
a free anyway let's continue to try the remaining 
snacks that we have here fish drop I'm not gonna  
lie my impression of this snack is that it's gonna 
be very tasteless because it's white in color so  
yeah color good let's see how it's still inside 
total white this reminds me of like a shrimp  
crackers that you'll have in like Chinese cuisine 
they serve it under something okay let's try this
it's so soft like the bubbles but also it's good 
taste and it's not so salty not so spicy not so  
flavor it's like ideal Perfect 10 to 10. 10. Wow 
Let's just try writing okay you know how I was  
saying I was biases and based on that like the 
packaging I didn't think it was going to taste  
good but for me this tastes actually pretty good 
I would say I'll give it eight because we have  
something similar in Hong Kong as well okay six I 
would choose oh so the last one was fish crackers  
this one here is shrimp crackers sorry let's try 
this okay I have a good feeling about this one I  
like swimming practice in general all right go for 
it oh it looks different actually doesn't remind  
you of salmon yeah the wines like this salmon 
like a little bit fried salmon already yeah
so hard I think that's one for me it tastes 
really good I think it's like they put shrimp  
paste on top of chips for me I like it so for 
me this one is easily an eight out of ten too
because taste it tastes like a fish 
shrimp from River uncooked next  
hey you you keep it for later sweet oh not first  
I know Alina wants sweet things all right so next 
on the list we've got this very popular Filipino  
snack that's typically used with beer like you're 
drinking alcohol you want a snack then this is the  
go-to and this one is called Ding Dong it's like a 
dog so uh this is mixed nuts with chips and curls  
sweet and spicy flavor I think you can even get 
a bowl for like a panda like this okay okay so  
they've got nuts oh different types of nuts and 
some chips and curls inside okay one two three
[Music]  
what do you think baby why 
is she that's an impression
I don't like it don't like it zero 
to ten really that low okay why  
tell me why because it's spicy and because 
inside have hope this nuts called calling  
peanut is it peanut yeah I don't 
like I don't like when you know  
and for me I think this that ding dong 
it's uh I would say it's okay for me
if I have food that I cannot eat restaurant always 
eat so my reaction to this ding dong snack is that  
it's a little bit too sweet for me I'm 
not very used to eating like a sweets  
yeah I don't feel sweet it's really for me 
it's just too sweet this one I like a spicy  
part of it but I'll give it a 4 out of 10 
for me yeah four out of ten okay I'll give  
one I get one okay zero because I already 
did this the people who love spicy and love  
like small snacks to eat like this just to 
obviously like it like yeah so yeah it's big  
pack it's a big pack and it's a good price 
but anyway it tastes not for me can we now
can we now start oh save one more nights actually  
can we now start eating three things and this is 
last night we will keep for last trying because  
I really wanted something sweet after spicy 
my mouth it's like a fire now okay okay okay  
okay so let's start with the sweet stuff which 
one do you want to try first oh yes thank you  
for asking I want to try this okay mochi mochi 
so the thing about this Moshi is it's a salted  
flavor it means it's got different flavors 
here from the looks of it there's a green one  
wait let me let me see what flavors they've 
got here oh so here even though it's made  
in the Philippines it says it's Japanese style 
glutinous rice cake so it's like puto which is  
rice stickers in Philippines I love Mochi I love 
Japanese Mojo let's see maybe Filipino much insane
I didn't say this is so tasty like I love 
more chip that's right for me it's so tasty  
but inside the filling it's a little bit dry 
so if inside they put some jam and it's like  
smoothing then we'll be perfect yeah for me I 
think the strawberry Mochi was like Alina said  
it's the outside's okay so it's quite chewy um 
but the inside for me it's too dry for me it's  
80s wow for me it's two two yeah I did really 
like it this one I didn't like it looks I wanna  
try snake this brand has got loaded loaded 
like have money like I'm loaded it's pillows
pillows looks very similar so 
I wonder what the difference is
I'm excited this smells like cereal okay
[Music]  
wow I'll get the 8 out of ten it's really tasty I 
think this can mix up cereal to be honest morning  
breakfast yeah for me it's 20 to 10. the highest 
up so far so good I love it I love it I can eat  
this non-stop hey save it for tomorrow okay save 
it for tomorrow I want to try a cake actually  
okay I'm gonna try a cake okay okay let's try 
a cheesecake cheesecake cheesecake butter small  
cheese cupcake usually I like this like this 
kind of style oh it smells like cheesecake
[Music]
okay what do you think I think it's tastes like 
a something in Russia it's called gimat again  
give it again and it's a selling in a pharmacy 
so for healthy yeah for health this is exactly  
the same taste but I really like it yeah let's 
go nine nine out of ten yeah nine out of ten all  
right my review of this cheesecake it tastes 
good flavor it's definitely there for me it's  
a yeah nine out of ten but I wish yeah if there 
is like more like sauce or like more cheese like  
creamy more cream inside and it'll be tastier even 
yeah but overall it's a good good snack we already  
almost eat everything so we have only one two 
three four five six seven eight eight snacks oh  
I'm already so full to be honest I'm just getting 
started okay you want to go for sleep so you're  
gonna go to sleep no I thought you might need 
a pillow thank you all right so right up yeah  
it says oh wow so you to like when you open it 
when smell says oh wow like this oh really okay
what do you mean it smells okay I don't know for  
me wait wait wait wait it smells 
like a pair of socks to me okay
oh so I think this one right here compared to 
the other pillow that we had before I think  
this one it's this one tastes even more like 
a cereal because inside there is not a lot  
of filling not a lot of chocolate filling so 
I think it's not as tasty as loaded I would  
say toad Lotus more tasty I want to say the 
same look it's more more tasty this is like  
less feeling less sweetness and just like it's 
crunchy yeah more crunchy so this is a gift six  
yeah I would say yeah for me it's the same I 
would say this is a I mean it still tastes and  
okay nevermind it tastes okay six thousand 
six all right next you want some yum yum
yeah it's a cup noodle mini cup noodle 
this kind of reminds you it's like if I'm  
a child if I throw up then we'll be like 
wow this is my childhood memory because  
the Colors oh it's like Nutella whoa oh 
whoa and so colorful things inside it's  
right some Nutella the steak and chicken 
and chocolate Nutella let me try Nutella
it stays not like a Nutella it tastes like a 
chocolate sweeter of Nutella chocolate I think
um I cannot say I think for me it's not so high 
quality chocolate they can feel it usually I like  
dark chocolate original but for me I think it cute 
as a child and you eat this you'll be like oh my  
goodness this is my childhood memory because the 
chocolate it's literally you can take spoons and  
spoons of chocolate just eat it's like eating 
Nutella on its own so for me it's quite tasty  
chocolate is a little bit sweeter than Nutella I 
think if you put everything this is like pillows  
they're not sweet so if you put inside in English 
Chocolate it's a good mix yeah right and this is  
rice crackers you know so it technically 
can get feeling just by eating chocolate
no I need my house
bye baby oh looks good it looks 
like a chocolate I decided to  
try this one this looks really good 
it's like a egg whoa chocolate pie
chocolate by more tastier
so like it looks like choco fire 
looks good everything looks good  
but only looks yeah that's what I'm trying 
to say so this is my review is that it I  
think any chocolate crust compared 
with chocolate pie the crust it's a  
bit more crunchy this one and also 
the marshmallow inside taste of it
it's a little bit different to chocolate 
pie it doesn't taste like yeah something  
different but not describing uh I'll give it a 
five out of ten I think how much you give did  
you give it ready no no that one I want I won't 
recommend buy this because it's like tastes so  
suspicious looks good but doesn't taste don't 
like it next we have this one I hope you're  
wrong with banana tea yeah so this one looks 
like a local snack this looks like a candy  
oh it's so small see so 
small it's like candy inside
[Music]  
yeah I mean The Taste is quite good I think you 
can make this into a biscuit I would actually buy  
it I think it's so soft and it's like immediately 
melt in your mouth yeah am I waiting for this one  
it's a I think it makes a five out of ten yeah for 
me five out of 10 too yeah okay one two three four
wait wait I'm looking I'm looking 
I can't see actually so I'll choose  
this one hey you know I don't know so this one uh 
it's Naka Raya yesterday we'll be at supermarket  
we're gonna buy one of these nuts and the lady 
was like try adorable adobo is the best okay I  
know it's nity wait wait no all right so before 
we try let's have a snail a little bit first
[Music] okay nice this I don't like this 
nuts I think in general for me as well  
I'm not a big fan of nuts but let's see 
maybe it will change my mind I'll create  
open-minded I'm fan of nuts I'm proud 
of yeah I'm fan of uh almond cashew and  
everything but not this nuts I'm gonna 
get a few just get the food taste a bit
oh like it done okay I feel when 
you try a few it's crunchy yeah
not bad yeah not bad
it's cover all taste peanuts and you can feel 
adobo taste really so crunchy it doesn't like  
the texture it's not like peanut but when you 
can eat on it it's like it's like crackers  
basically but it has that peanut flavor for 
me it's quite interesting I like it yeah so  
um I'll give it eight I think eight out of ten 
tastes better than it looks yep okay I am next  
next to seeing and we have only this is free last 
packs of Filipino snacks let's let's try this one  
okay this beer bites yeah pipe pipe yeah the 
reason why it's got a pie is because there's  
a hole in the middle and there is like cream 
peeling I think that's why it's got a pipe with  
white chocolate oh it's like a churros no I think 
churros no rolly rolly rolly chilling [Laughter]
[Music]
I really like it 20. 20 out of 10. 20. my goodness  
I will eat this for breakfast every day this 
reminds me of the Corn the corn snack that we  
had earlier plus inside there's a Feeling don't 
know why it tastes like corn the corn the corn  
snack that we had just now she's not listening to 
me already it's just you know in Paradise for me  
I think it's okay for me it's a six out of ten 
yeah it's a six out of ten for me it's okay
I like it like it no okay all right next I choose 
this one so next we have Moby caramel Puffs from  
an appearance it actually looks like popcorns kind 
of thing oh all right smells like nothing [Music]
oh it's so similar so something 
similar we had this now  
no oh no I know I know I know I know if Russia 
have this next it's called kukuruzik it's like  
so so so so so old Russian snake like red my 
grandmother gave me before and it's exactly the  
same taste but different form we have like this 
I think for me I'm I'm just vibing on this one  
I think I can do this like oh I need a little bit 
it's so it's quite tasty I like the Puffs I think  
this might be one of the most addictive snacks 
you can have yeah I think for this one I can eat  
it at every movie that we watch yeah I think this 
is real addictive so I will give this a 20 out of  
10. oh my favorite one really yeah your favorite 
though yeah this is Africa taste of it is good  
and last one I think this will be my favorite I 
don't know because uh from package that I see I  
really love it it's like a marshmallow Mochi plus 
inside feeling chocolate but again looks can be  
deceiving even it looks so good but it can taste I 
know Japanese usually have something similar yeah  
so this is uh Filipino made from 
here since the last one is cheese
it's the same exactly like Japanese [Music]
properly so sweet but anyway nine out of 
ten for me I think at my the first taste  
I had the one I had didn't have a lot 
of chocolate inside I think I picked the  
wrong piece just then but I had a second one 
second one has a lot of chocolate inside so  
it's quite tasty it's like a marshmallow 
with chocolate filling inside outrated  
um maybe like eight out of ten for a snack overall 
good snack I guess yay we fish everything yeah
at home
oh my goodness just now you you cannot expect 
what's happened we ran off our battery and our  
cameras died yeah and Alina went to the phone it's 
like oh no the video is gone one hour footage was  
gorgeous then and Alina was like [Music] I get 
so scared because we we really we try everything  
for me it was so upset oh my God yeah I don't know 
what we'll do to be honestly I probably already 10  
minutes after 10 minutes I just like pick up my 
phone with hope this video will be my fault and  
it's actually there luckily we're just processing 
because it was saving uh when the battery died so  
luckily it's still there but heart attack well 
situation so I think overall this experience of  
trying Filipino food for me it's that I realized 
in Philippines there is a huge diversity of snacks  
so they are food they are like in their snacks I 
don't like if you guys think but have something  
else in Philippines what we should try uh put 
down like writing something in the comments and  
we will read and next time we will make new video 
that's it we're thinking to do more reaction time  
of videos so if there's anything you'd like us 
to react about the Philippines let us in the  
comments and we'll react to it and don't forget 
to like this video comment and subscribe to our  
Channel if you haven't already because it will 
help us a lot and continue our journey here in  
the Philippines okay see you guys next 
time see you guys next time bye [Music]
