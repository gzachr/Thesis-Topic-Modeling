 Good morning guys, welcome to another daily juice and this balcony we were on ending yesterday's video probably about two hours ago. We've edited two vlogs, done a bit work and we ate some pizza. It was good actually, very nice pizza. I thought about a bit more after our experience this evening. We were considering like should we sleep, should we not sleep and we've gone with Mike and said no we're not gonna sleep so if we're moody later this guy's fault. I just I convinced everybody to just drink coffee all the time. All you ever do. I ever do drink coffee and eat a lot and edit vlogs. Imagine if humans didn't need sleep and you just do it. It's just a constant rolling thing. Yeah, you get so much done. Just imagine you you were able to switch to a polyphasic sleep rhythm. That would be the best. Yes, that. Right should we go to the airport and catch fry and then a ferry. Alright then. Capture a ferry, a scooter, a donkey and a horse. That's good. Maybe ride a duck. Ride a balloon. I'm still tasting it. I'm editing the video of eating the ballot right after eating it. Didn't help. It's not very luckily George edited that one. Even I struggled but I'm not gonna speak so I've already been accused of being over dramatic. You're never walking back. You just you don't know. You don't know. You've never been there. I'm not part of the club. You wouldn't understand. Right. Airport. We are living a yellow submarine. A yellow submarine. A yellow submarine. Thank you. Thank you. Rock and roll. Bye. Bye. Let's rock and roll. This is when you do want to use an airport trolley at three in the morning when you've had no sleep. I'll fix that. What a big lift. Ready. Where do you want? We're in a lift. It's singing time again. Hello darkness my old friend. Yeah right. When I work at home in the U.S. You don't get the way out of screen. That's so nice. Sure I'll take a picture of you guys. Everyone. To me. How you doing? How you doing? How you doing? Go back. I'm going to go back. So we seem to get into Manila Airport a really good way actually from across the other completely other side of the street which meant we didn't have to queue at all. Got straight in. Oh. Right here again. Mind your toes. Yeah. Yeah. Five AM at the airport. Mike's picked up a coffee obviously. We've been uploading the vlog for Phantom Wi-Fi and we are boarding the plane in 20 minutes. This way? To me. Good to meet some of you guys. Sorry if we've been tired in the selfies and things when we've met you but it's great to see so many of you. We, well, meet Lucy and Nelly are a little bit tired. It's a tiny bit weirry, shall we say. Mike however has an incredible amount of energy. No. Coffee inside of her. Because he has had about 16 coffees today. You know I'm really proud of some of that. I mean all of them. You and me. Every thing that we've been through has made us strong. You won't believe we've had our way. But so right there's a light inside of us. We managed to get the best seats in the house here. Right up front. We didn't want to be too far away from these guys for too long. I love you. Flight done. We're in the whole place we really like. We're actually under a different airport. So one moment. This is very... And it's delayed by an hour. And this airport is further away from the ferry port. So now we've got a bit... We're a bit tight to time. I can't wait to see if there's any luck to a day. I call it being time efficient. No? No. Mike here has stopped over at the side of the road because none of us have eaten since last night's dinner. And before that we had an eaten since breakfast. Oh I'm a little under the bullet. So he's trying to get us some. I mean this looks quite good actually. It's like a little bakery. So the coffee options here at the ferry port. Creamy latte or creamy white. Creamy? No. Actually. Oh the decision isn't it? Very well-branded sugar. 4.8. So creamy white please. It's got 9.8 less grams of sugar. But the ferry port now. This is the secret room. If you're at the port, go upstairs. There's aircon. There's plugs. There's an editing desk. Which I think they call it right? Yeah. And there's a small coffee option. So it's great. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. I think it's a nice day. It's been stirring. It's not just stirring. What is it, last one? I think I'm still locked in with George's Internet family. I swear it was fast. No. What the hell are ferry ports? So guys you see what I go through together. I vlog out to you around the papers in my laptop. What do you need papers for a vlog? Because I need the documentation for the copy right. Finally boarding our ferry. This has been kind of intense travel day today, hasn't it? Yeah. It's been just pretty much moving around. Flight, taxi, ferry. I think we're going to be rewarded. You guys tell me this place is insane. It has to be amazing. We stayed a week 24 hours. It's 24 hours. We've been up 24 hours, which is no easy thing to do, but it's going to pay off. It's been interesting that it's been Instagram's that we've been taking in the last couple of days on our road trip. And also we get questions of how do you get your photos and stuff and what filters do you use. So we're going to put a link below to our presets. We sell lightroom presets. It's really easy to download them. You can have them on an Android or iPhone or a computer or a Mac. It's like a one click thing that puts a filter onto your photos. And then you can have like a nice theme and stuff on your Instagram. And they're all kind of like, we call it the travel pack. Because it's all like nice like, aquacolours and nice plays and stuff. We'll put some before and after in here. So you can see that includes five presets as well. So the links below if you want to go and check it out. So Mike is still trying to upload his vlog even though we're queuing for the ferry. It's not so much the laptop. The papers need to be filed. So everybody ready? Yay! Yay! So the bullet videos on both of our channels have just gone live. And we are sat here reading and replying to all the comments coming in there. They're coming in faster than we can reply to them. So thanks so much. We hope you enjoyed those videos. It looks like you guys are really... So funny. It was like, right to me. Sorry to take this on guys but we did it. Alright, getting a tricycle. Very nice tricycle. Lovely paint job. I like it. This guy's taking us to our... Oh, okay. Wait, now? What on earth can you work out then? We are getting ready to hit the road to our hostel. It's a hostel but it's like a schedule for all of us. What? We are in one room. Oh, really cold. Yeah. There is a priceless to be arrived for the transport. So just have a look on that. Okay, you will know it's regulated for mine. Everyone in? Yeah, we are going to fit in there. One in my back. Is there? Two guys and one woman here. Oh, so the guy is inside. Oh, and you man? Here? And you? Maybe we are here. It's not mine, huh? Just only sit. I'm on your back. Are you ready? Watch your head. Everyone in. Watch your head. Alright. The plane. Yes. Yes. Alright. Hello. Thank you, Lala. Woo! I said I think I know what you mean. We're good for it. You're not here. You got me. It's mine. It's over for one. I was when you woke me up. All this time, I didn't know I had my heart to stand by. We've arrived at our accommodation. We're staying in this really cool house right there somewhere. A little balcony. Back to Ireland life. Already I feel calmer. The air feels fresher. It's nice. Palm trees that coconut trees everywhere. We are all pretty tired. It's staying up 24 hours. It's never really a good idea unless you're Mike. You're good to scoot? Yeah. Because it's pretty 3 minutes away. Oh, okay. Yeah, cool. So we're going to take scooters to some food. And then I think we're going to come back and possibly just rest. Call it a day there. Get off-log sorted. Get what we need to do, done. And then bed. I think Nelly really, really needs a sleep. I turn into a monster. Yeah. I've noticed. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom. I'm going to have to go to the bathroom.
