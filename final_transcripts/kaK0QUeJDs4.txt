 Hi everyone welcome to our channel. Yes at last it's roof time. So let's have a look how they build this roof and what it looks like and how much it costs at the end of the day. Don't go away and enjoy. Thank you. Okay another layer build and yesterday I wasn't here so it looks like the roof people started to assemble. They brought all the stuff, pulled some string line and all the material here delivered. Yeah surprise. Anyway that's okay. It's good I'm happy. Oh that's pretty long. That's a 20 feet long or what? Wow. I like the color of the roof so I hope you like it too. Okay they said they come here Monday so they came but I haven't seen anybody today this morning so I don't know if they come lighter or they go back finish another job. Maybe they come back in a week time. Who knows so that's what it's all about. That's the Philippines. So I'm going home because that text them has no answer. It's okay at least it's good we know that something's happening. Okay the workers are right for the roof but I'm going to get gone going to come from that to time and supervise it. Just to help them they need water they need something that's how it is. They know what they're doing I hope and I'm going home I'll be back later. Okay another day so still a lot of work to do but getting there. Okay that's how far they went. I think it's going to be an extra day. I felt three days to finish today but they won't finish today. Now you have to put the whole insulation on the big roof and I still have a bit to do on the verendant having done nothing yet. Let's have a look. Yeah the verendant the back nothing done yet. It's a bit pretty slow actually but I can't get my workers to work underneath. There was a roof is finished but we'll install the floor. Yeah I'm sure you can see those rivets but they will be painted as well so we won't see them after. Yeah the porch looking good so the future looking good for the roof. Still a lot of work to do. Anyway as soon as the roof is finished we're going to do the floor. Yeah more people cam now so they're going to start I think with the verendant. Somebody already at the taking some measurement. I'm not going to get my workers to work underneath them and you see this stuff is very wise too dangerous. I know I wanted to do some work on the water tank but they want to have a rest. I need a rest too so we're not going to work this week just have a rest. All that we do when the roof is just to get a cup of pipe just to send the water down the slope. I'm going to do a lot of work on the water tank. I'll see how they're going to have a lot of work on the water tank. So if you do that I'm going to have to buy a second water tank. So it's no rush for that. One of the roof is installed. My man can work inside and that's the main thing. That's very good. That's important. That's a good view. The man house will have an insulation I think we did well. I think it's an extra 5000 pesos. I'm going to do a cost list or what's been happening anyway. Yeah that pot is looking good. They give us the fascia color like you see. Field charge. 74000 pesos for the whole thing. I think it's pretty good price. Everything included, labor, materials. It's got like four days to do this job. That's pretty good. I'm happy. Somebody's coming to give me some quotation for a window. About the small window. How many size? Small. I see a picture today. One window. No, better open. Open because you're usually on the one-in-six. See our window. 300x300. 30. 60 or maybe? No, no, no, small. 30. It's going up red. Because I'll pull a little bit higher. 30x30. That'll be okay. The rest it's all here in inches. 48x48. It's green. Okay, we go to his house. Just around the corner so we can see what he's selling me. Let's go there. He's only 300 meters from my house. And I never thought somebody might win those here. Okay, we've got a little sample here so it's good. Actually, I don't mind this size window. That's a bigger one. That's better made it for the bedroom. Anyway. This glass is a little bit dark. Package your screen. All package, Joe. All package screen. You give me per window. Per window and then after how many? Just work out one window. Because I want to see different size. I want to see the one meter as well. Maybe one meter enough. One meter like 40? One meter at the back. Maybe. Okay, I got some price 5,920 for 1.2 by 1.2 meter. And 5,620 for one by one. This with this glass is the glass make a difference? Price? Okay. You have another glass cheaper but still good quality. Only this one. Artificial polar. This is the better one. Art. I'm not sure to go with him because I could see his job is done on his house. Things are not cut square. I worry already. One door is dropping on one side. One that. Yeah, what I'm here. So this. That's excellent. I like to grow them. Love it. It's very healthy. Yeah. Yeah, pineapple. Okay, let's go back. Hello. Oh, you're gorgeous. Okay, we got to the line to see how the roof is going. And there we go shopping. Let's go baby. Oh, you look so cute. Stand up. Stand up, girl. Please. What is a Bella? Yeah. Very hot. We going to the land. It's too hot. Yes, Bella is with us. Yes. Bella is a Bella. Maybe if you close the window. You can see how much ice is ice. See. What are you so good? It's too hot. The weather is so good. It's too hot. I said the weather is so good. It's very hot today. The weather is so good. It's very hot today. Okay, guys. Nearly finito. You have to put the fascia cover all around. So they are on the front, the side of the you can see the porch. It's finished. How about the veranda? Let's have a look closer. This is weekend. That's what we are going to see on this video. Oh yeah. Okay, veranda is particularly finished. Yeah. Yeah, you just put in the fascia cover around. That's it. So there was finished. This is big. This is with insulation on the house side of it. What do you think, baby? This is your house after, baby. This is your house after, baby. This is big. It looks big, but once we put the walls and everything, it's not going to be that big. But yeah, so Monday should be able to start installing the floor. One day here. So what do you think? I know you're happy. Something's happening. Yeah. Yeah, because we really want to move out. From the partner, we got the yacon off. And they just want to charge you everything. And let's see if it's. The porch is big. The ranch is good. Give you freedom. Just stay here forever. It's not a good thing. A little girl, what do you think, baby? You happy? You don't care. She's looking around. Yeah. Yeah, she's good. Where are you? That's your house, baby. Yeah, I did well to put insulation on the house side. I think it's not too much for a river. And the roof is pretty high. So the heat's not going to stay there for sure. Not like in the Fama's mountain. I think it's start running. Okay guys, we got it because it's start running. It's going to rain. The flag. I think Jerm is happy. I think milestone to have the roof. So yeah. Uh, Jerm, stay here. We do a photo. Okay, that should be finished by Monday. We are Saturday now. So I'm sure Monday will be finished. We can start the flow. Okay. Let's go training. I hope you enjoyed this video. Until the next video. Take care, God bless you. Bye bye. Bye bye.
