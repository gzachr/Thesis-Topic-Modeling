How do I point? Filipino. Give me another one. Moby-at. What is this? Oh, those are the beans, right? Oh, I have those. These. These. These are like... Chocolate Cheetos. We recently had that on our road trip back here from Shagawa. And I was eating them and I was like, what's this? Take it out to my mouth. And it was a rock. I'm not even going to say stone. This was a rock, a stone called rock. Okay. But it isn't that. We haven't confirmed yet. I think it is. Is it this? Pop beans. Pop beans. Guys, let us know if Moby is pop beans. Let's do this. Hey, how's it going? Super crunchy. I love it. It's slightly salty. Listen to that. It's hot, crunchy. But they actually taste like chocolate Cheetos. So, do you guys take some like chocolate Cheetos? Kind of. You get it? This is not... Ooh, chocolate favorite. No, this is not this. So these are called Moby. It is a chocolate covered. No, this is not this. I like what you're talking about. It looks like a... I feel like I'm winning right now. I'm craving chocolate now. Wait. I know what it is. I was going to destroy these wrongs. I will buy two packs. Two. Is that the one in the red package? Oh. Yeah. It's like the chocolate puffs. I ate too much. Would you like? Because they said it's like chocolate cereal. How do you not know this? Why do you have to know this? We don't know this. It's like a cow. It's so like a bird. What is it? It's selling bird right now. So like a bird. Okay. Hold on. We tried so many Filipino snacks. We even have a dedicated video where we tried lots of things that are obvious. I never had these. We had hoppia. We had... What else? Pulveron. Pulveron. Mike loves chocolate mochotro. So many things, but never have these. I feel like chocolate mochotro gets way too little credit. Chocolate mochotro is fantastic. You take a snacker and a chocolate mochotro. You take it on my own popping tour. I'm telling you too early later. Your snacker is melted. It is gone. You cannot enjoy it unless you stick a straw in it. But your chocolate mochotro is too crunchy. It is too solid. It is delicious. Let me know what is your favorite chocolate mochotro. Mine is the peanut chocolate mochotro. The golden one. This is not sponsored though. I've chocolate mochotro wants to sponsor Mike. He would highly appreciate it. Reach out. I already do have the assets. Is this? It looks like a pearl. It tastes weird and very dusty. Dusty? Let me get to tasting pot. Milk. Milk? Milk mix with sugar and taste like. It tastes kind of like the spoiled milk we had in the joey bean game. I like it. Milk candies. Oh, that's why those are cow. I'm a sickle. Ripped crackings. Okay, we have. Really? It's like chit-choron. Oh, okay. Oh. Oh, this is milk. I don't think it's like it. It smells spicy. It does taste good. It's a spicy kind of way. It's very cute. It's a bit bit pino. Yeah. I like it. You don't know a lot of the other chips. This is the bigger one. A lot of chip-person chips. It's chocolate chip. Cougies. I would get a chocolate chip. Thank you, Ben, for sending snacks to us. We really liked it. Thank you, Ben. Chata, Chama Filipinos. Oh, Chata to Filipinos. That was hilarious. So cute. We need to try more Filipinos snacks. We have not tried a Filipino snack. Here's one thing that we can do to make it up to you guys. We are currently in right now. And we will be at home for a very long time as it looks for now. So please do us a solid favor and comment down below. What kind of snacks we should try? We will try to do a reaction video on our main channel. Yeah. Just about... Yeah. Just like sit down and eat candy and snacks and everything. So maybe... And we have tried a few already. So if you check out the one video on our channel, it was our very first meter here in the Philippines, where people brought us some snacks and we tried the bad videos linked right here. And also when we did our big meter, a lot of people brought us snacks. That was the second meter and we did a video trying the snacks after that. So that will pop up right here. So a lot of snack videos but still just scratch the surface. Whoever this guy is who sends those kids the snacks, please send us some snacks. Please send food! Please send food! Well, I have to get rid of my lechon belly so not too many. Yeah, definitely. What is your favorite Filipino snack? I would say... I really enjoy it. I don't know what it is called. It's like the puffs, the chocolate puffs that are like... The chocolate cereal. It's like big cocoa puffs. Yeah. It's like mice. It's not mice. It's a cornice. I think that was a movie. It's a puff. It's like a cheeto just with chocolate. I don't know. It's like a sweeto cheeto. I know what the real favorite Filipino snack is. Get ready for this. What? Chicken skins. There you go. There you go. There it is. That's a really good one. There is one restaurant here. It's called Ocean Basket, I think. Island. Island Basket. They have really good chicken skins with some vinegar. Yeah. We actually did a very fun video there. We did a blind phone challenge where I was wearing blind phones and phones. They just ordered a few things of the menu and I had to try and guess what this is. What is your favorite snack? Obviously. No, not chocolate motro. I like chocolate motro. I have a relationship. We have chocolate motro here at home. I would say I like me some good chicharang. Love chicharang. Anything salted egg from the Philippines. Oh, salted egg chips. Love salted egg chips and salted egg stuff. Yeah, Mike is a huge fan of salted egg. So cool. Yes.
