 Houses very quiet at the moment. Everyone's out on a midday, CSTA asleep. So I've ordered formulas out of it for the first time. Just waiting for them to deliver. I've ordered a mobile Wi-Fi. So that we can connect a bit more and upload our videos. I have to rely on family members, Wi-Fi signal, or mobile phones. So hopefully they find the address. The delivery of the Philippines. Not many houses have an address here. Most people just know word of mouth where someone lives. So we've given the directions to the driver and hope he can find it. So we're just on the phone now to the Lazada Minjavan, the delivery. Let's try and tell them where we are. So we can try and collect the parcel. So we finally got the parcel. So Lazada finally addressed. He knew where it was really. He just wasn't used to the number. I put my number on there. But anyway, you're all good. So we're going to get some papaya today. Right papaya. Jane Isabella and myself are picking up papaya. We've never done it before. New experience here in the province. We have quite a lot of new experiences because we've only been here about a month now. Well, just under a month. And how are we settling in? It's been great. There's been a lot of adjustments of course. But we really love it here. We really enjoy it. And we're looking forward to everything that life has for us here in the Philippines. Now you want to one? Oh, there's the papaya. We're going to try and get these papaya. It's probably better for you to reserve because you know I'm sure. I can try. I can try a lot of them. You can try. It's their Jane type first. I don't understand anything. So which are the white ones? The green or the orange? The orange one this week. That one. That one? Yeah, that yellow. Yellow. Orange. I mean orange. That's the ripe. Are you pointing me to a mouth? I'm just... Can you just stick one back? Could change. Oh. Yeah. Right, a two-block to that. We're stuck. No, no, we had none more for. It's gone squashed. But that's good to be condemned. So here we... Here we have a papaya. A white, a very, very white papaya. That one is overrides. It's overrides. Adam strikes a game. Okay. Okay. Okay, be careful. I'm gonna follow you. I'm gonna step on the pitch. Yeah. I hit my phone when I pushed. Oh my god, are you okay? That was okay. Just I didn't see it. Bye. Watch your whole watch with the whole thing falling. So this is what happened guys. Adam is not used to with this stuff. So it's James to nice put the guava. Have two white guava's here.

I had a dragonfly. Close my mind this bitch. Wow, cute. So we're going back to all mock tomorrow. Isabella's going to school, believe it or not. She's got an exam to see if she can get into a school in all mock. It's not a proper start to school as of yet, as it's still the summer holidays here in the Philippines. But she's going to go and they're going to talk to her about her education level and see if she's able to join in August. So I'll show you what happens. I'm hopefully rather not date soon. But we want to share with you the process of involving a child into a school in the Philippines. And we're going to let you know exactly what we find out. So if you are making a move to the Philippines and you know what to expect as well. Sun's starting to go down here. Nice evening. And are you looking forward to school tomorrow, Isabella? Wait up. I don't want to go to school. I want to be free forever. Can't wait to be your age. No, you wouldn't want that. You want to go all quickly. Why would you want to be 25? 25. You're close to me.

But you're always going to be happy. You haven't got a job and you've got money. That's true. Yeah, ASMR is my job. Well, I don't know about that. What do you guys think? Do you think Isabella is doing an ASMR on her channel? Or just eating for you? Just eating until she gets far. And then you'll watch me do my weight loss. Because lose a Philippines. Wow. Thank you. This is the big guava that we just picked from the tree and then our slice is really big. So... Oh, it's... Right? It's really hard. Ah! Be careful. You'll focus me. It's hard. I think we just have to bite it. Bite it? You have to bite it. I don't think this game's edible. Yeah, you can't eat it. They won't rush that skin. Yeah. Oh, it's really good. Not too skin. What do you think? It's a good one. It's a good one. I don't know why I'm like that. She's concentrating all right. I know. You got hit, too. Oh, boss. It's really good. This is stuck man. What do you think? I don't have energy. No more energy. How could that? Promise. Hello. There you are. There you go. Ah, there's some. Get that back. I've never tried guava before. You can try now. Don't eat the seeds. That should be fine. It's good. It's fine. You can eat the seeds with it. You can even the skin. You can eat the skin. You're supposed to eat the skin like that. You bite that bit. Right, the skin. Yeah. Like apple. Yeah, like apple. The skin is better. It's this nice. I don't really like it. It's just good. Do you want to do ASMR? You want to do ASMR? This is your start. Yeah. So guava. The skin. The skin. Yeah. You have to eat the skin as well as the bit. Yeah. Yeah, it's unusual. The skin is so bitter. It's quite dry. It's nice. It's something that guava flavour drinks, don't you? Yeah. It's good for energy. But by itself it's a bit too dry. But it'd be nice as a flavour for something. Mental focus is about if it's more for your school. No, it tastes so sour. It would make me... I don't know. Throw up. You didn't throw up. You didn't throw up. The slice went to his eye. So here we have guava. Especially baked guava. So I have grown from the garden. The skin. The skin. It's nice. SMR.
