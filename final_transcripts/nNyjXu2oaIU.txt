 Anyang sayang mga patatas, welcome back to my channel. So it's been one and a half month since I came to Korea. And to be honest, I have been craving so much for Filipino food. So today, I decided to come to a Filipino restaurant in Seoul. Yeah, and I'm very excited. And my sister, Atagre, who has been staying in Korea for several months, he really misses Filipino food so today, I have three companies with me, my sister and two friends who are also from the Philippines. So yeah, it's gonna be super fun talking about our memories in the Philippines. So let's go! In the little details. Jollybee Club, give me. And the interior design is really pretty. It reminds me of Bahiko Bo. I'm Jion. I started in Mapoah. Mapoah. And I'm from Takaitan. Takaitan! Hi. Hi guys. What's your name? What's your name? My name is Sean. And I'm studying in the new...

The irony is, why do they give us radish? It should be a chara. You know a chara? No one will be crispy butter. The Philippines will be crispy butter. They'll be like this. But sadly, they only have a chara. He said, what's up, money? You were preparing for it. No, no chara. You know what I mean. What's up? What's up? Four New Year's Eve. Again. So our menu is here. What's this? Dicol Express. Dicol Express, Uncle. Finiang. This thing's tasty. And the mango. And my garlic rice is here. 10,000 YouTube. Garlic rice. 10,000 YouTube. Is it 10,000? 10,000. Oh, shit.

You're the one who's eating chicken. It's 10,000. And this is the one. It's 10,000. It's 10,000. It's 10,000. It's 10,000. English please, everyone. It's 10,000. It's 10,000. It's 10,000.

It's really good. It's really good. It's 3,000. It's so good. It's really good. It's really good. I'm going to ask if there's laboio. Because I just saw laboio in Wildtanger. Are you sure laboio is this? No, just give it to me. The chef is Filipino. For sure. She's a lady. But I'm not sure if there's laboio. I'm not sure if there's any. I got my laboio. I'm going to eat this with the special. What is it? It's really good. It's really good. I'm going to eat this with the special. It's really good. I'm going to eat this with the special. Yeah, it's good. It's really good. It's really good. It's really good. It's really good. It's really good. I'm going to show them your skin. That's right. What I like about these places, they did not change the style of Philippines state. It's like some restaurants need to shift to fusion, like Korean and Filipino style. But here is really authentic. But the price. The price is not Filipino. The price is Korean. I'm going to eat this with the special. It's really good. Wow, it's really good. I'm going to put this one. It's good. Hello, hello. Let me see. What's this, sir? It's a chicken. It's a chicken. I want to eat this. I'm full. It's very hot. Very hot. It's very hot. I mean, Lee Hyun-hee, when I was in a hurry, she said, she needs her school. And it's just like five minutes walk. She pays eight pesos, I thought she was a student. But it's actually very convenient. Sometimes do that. It's just that some local people will look like you. Yeah, like, why is she getting down so fast like that? You know? I think the school is really good. The school is really good. But I don't think I can do it. Oh, no fans. I'm not giving any voted. Come in. Come in. Oh, no. Come in. No. It's almost the opposite of the other. Probably, the women who are running and running, I think it's going to be someone who will come out. But now, the two of us are a little bit strong. I don't know. I have no political stance, guys. It's really good. We're in Angleys. They have the authentic balabok there. But for me, Jolly Balabok is the best. I don't know why. Yeah. That's my best lunch. Maybe it's Korean's favorite? It's a perfect meal. So this is the outcome. Samokang. I'm trying to eat all the shrimp. She ate all the shrimp. So now we're going to leave and I just saw this signboard. My boohai. Let's go. Guys, we're done eating. I'm going to end my video here because I'm going to be heading home. Anyways, I really enjoyed the food so much. I know it's just been one and a half months. I feel it's Filipino food. But I don't know. I really miss it. I think I'm going to come here open with my sister. And also, maybe next time, we're going to try another Filipino restaurant in Seoul. Anyways, thank you so much for watching, guys.
