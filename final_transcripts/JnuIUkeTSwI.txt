Manages are promised between two people, the love each other and who trust that love. But it takes more than love to make this relationship work. It takes trust to know in your hearts that you only want the best for each other. It takes dedication to stay open to one another, to learn and to grow. Even when it's difficult to know so. And it takes faith to go forward together without knowing what the future holds for you both. Eugene, will you think as much to be a loved-oriented wife, to live together in the state of Machimon? Thank you. We give love, honor and keep her in Sikhas and in help. And for seeking all others, keep her safe from all the other, as long as she wants to share the enemy.
