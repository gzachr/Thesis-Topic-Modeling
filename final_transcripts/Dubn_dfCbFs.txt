Yeah, that's my first magic. Oh, we are not amazing. I'm going to get the car. I'm going to get the car. I'm going to get the car. Yeah, and I was thinking like you can see here like a lot of people you know they spend their whole lives Growing up here and they go to these things every year and how everybody's all Interconnected and like that whole feeling of family Regardless yeah with their whole community, right? Like that's super incredible. That's something we're kind of used to watch our earlier videos We talk about this all the time that you don't even know your neighbors have So when you come here everybody gets to know everybody and everybody's kind of Interconnected and I believe they have like I like when I was told the numbers it was 18,000 registered voters In this area so when you add children people that have been registered to vote that kind of thing could be 40-45,000 so we're not talking a very small town here You know it's pretty big and this was so amazing So we won't know who won by the way Because it goes on all week and then they have a crowning of this Because of now I think it's the Sunday next Sunday something like that It's still loud you know they do the exit things but people are now now Hey Isn't that beautiful So pretty here it's so amazing I'm so jealous of it. I want this in New Zealand right now. Right? Come on, New Zealand. Have that kind of like down home field for a minute, will you? Like we do have, you know, the festival markets of the guy. But it's very commercialized, right? We're this, the whole other thing, you know, between commercialized and local. The only thing is it only is long during December. Yeah. One month. Yeah, it's the year long one. I would be there every day to be on it. I never learned to go. All right. It's not a face of drive though. I would learn how to drive. I would learn how to drive. I'm so short, I'm not. I know, it's really hard to drive here. With this one anyway. This is our other camera. This one is a little bit different for night time. So it helps us. But it is really difficult because the lens doesn't let me get that far. We don't have, we don't have proper lenses. Yeah, we don't have a real wide lens. But it's okay, it's okay. You see me, I see you. Whoa. I don't see you actually. I see. No, you don't see me. I found the singer. Is it normal for the singer to hide like that? Every place I go in the Philippines they sing great. Every time. Everybody sings. I let you know that I'm not so sure. You need to never say that. I hope you go. I hope you know that this is what it should do with you. We don't need to say that we don't need to do it. I know, they just give you money. So here we go. Look at this. It's like a little carnival. This is so cool. This is really nice. But, yeah, karaoke at the carnival up here. All right, it's really loud with two karaoke's going on at the same time. I'm doing karaoke. But you'll notice where are the people mostly? It's where they bet the real money. Yeah, they're at the gambling stations. And then karaoke. Those are the two. Most pop it. But nobody wants to ride. But what's this? Nobody wants to ride the chicken. Parasel. Is it parisel? Is it funeral paris? Well, there's chickens too though. And roosters. Hey, well, my joke was funnier when you don't... Sorry. But you are standing in front of an ostrich. Parasel. Yeah. Imagine having a rooster in the pool right under it. Right. Like so you have to swim with the fishes. And then have a pool. So we're ready for our hungry. Look at, they're like waiting for you. Oh, yeah. And then they set up here. This place open. Only this weekend. I feel like a brand new place. Hotel. Cafe right music. So. This is the wolf's room for... Well, the wolf's room. There's a few here in this. I'm pretty poor. But not in the deck. Oh, okay. So on the roof they have a private event. So we can't go up there. But we could see from the outside. It's really pretty up there. Hey, there's that carousel. Hey. Yeah. Wow, look how far the water is out today. Yeah. Very, very low. It's pretty like blocks. It could be a little vision. Yeah. And then the boardwalk all the way down. And that's the fish. A fish? Ah, yes. That's the fish market. So you get fish here. Fresh. Oh, no. Hey, where are you going? Let me get started. You're moving, start. I'm going to get the food. I'm going to get the food. I'm going to get it. I'm going to get it. Oh, my gosh. Oh, we got some calamari too. You don't like it? No, no, no, no. That's mine. That's mine. You're with me. We just had breakfast. Face-eyed. Face-eyed. Really beautiful place. I can see why it's doing well in the town here. It's something brand new right on the beach. That's pretty nice. And good news. Everything's all new. It's so nice. So now if you want to know where a nice cayenne place to stay in Benathis? Benathis. That's where it is. All right, let's keep going. We're going to go and get our luggage first out of the place for staying. What's the name of the place for staying? Gonzalez building. Gonzalez building where you can find more affordable places to stay than I. And it was quite comfortable. We slept like babies. Yeah, they see what's nice. Everything is nice. Yeah. And it's right across from the fish market right here. Well, I guess it's the tally pop up. Yeah. So if you do that, and then it's right near the palawan also. So that's easiest way to find it. This is Badong. Badong. Badong. Badong. What is Badong's shrimp paste? No, the Badong is a shrimp. Yeah, shrimp. That they use for shrimp paste, right? Hello. There you go. You think of Badong, Badong? Look at the rice. 30 pesos a kilo of rice. Oh, it's a loaf of rice. Yeah, pretty much. Do you sell rice here or do you bring it? Well, we send it to the main market. Oh, okay. Okay. There you go. There's the vegetable. A little more busier than yesterday when it comes to vendors. I have to find the Mandaria market. Let's read my friend. Okay. Yeah, this is about some off of them. There we go. I'm going to give you some. We're back home. Now we're good right now for a minute. So yeah, we're back home here in Ilavilo. We've got the bus station. That time we had an air-conditioned bus. Kind of. Well, yeah. It's an older bus that needs a little bit of upgrades. But a little bit of air conditioning. So no open windows. Yeah, it wasn't sweating against any hotlines. Yeah, yeah. So we covered up as best as we could. But it wasn't as cool as the normal bus. That's for sure. Our cat is cats. One of our cats are missing. We can't find Kauai. It's been three days. If you were one of our local neighbors, and you see this little cat with a curly little tail. That orange cat, okay. It's not messed up tail. He's a bit of a jerk. He's a bit tummy. I don't know what that is. Yeah, maybe not no more. But anyway, if you've seen our cat, we have lots of videos of our cat. Let us know. Even if you've adopted them, that's fine. It's fine. We know we safe, okay? Because we care more about the cats and ourselves. So, Bora, though, is at home alone. So we've featured a lot of food and everything else. Now we want to go home to them. There we go. Sorry. So the security is quite high. Of course, they'll pat you down, separate it, male-female lines. And they will take away your pens. And your cigarettes, all that stuff. So don't bring them. If you were coming to us.
