 Future Friday. The freshest. This video keeps getting sent to us and I just looked at the video and it has the old school vibe. It's old. And I did a little bit of research and this is actually one of the longest running shows in the Philippines called, like, Bulaga Pamore or Pamore. I don't know. Bulaga Pamore. It Bulaga. Yes, some of the other. And Kakai Baltista goes versus Jonah. Oh my God. And. I don't know what I... Okay, we reviewed Kakai Baltista like months ago, right? Like months ago. Yeah. And you guys were like, oh my God, she's a comedian. You guys should check out her. And I was like, there's no way. There's no way. There's no way. But I guess this is like a good example of what you actually... And I love this versus video, right? No, it's video. So let's give it a watch. Music Pamore. Pamore. Music Pamore. Yeah, I told you. More. Ages. Good Jonah. What would have thought that could come out with such a tiny body? Right. But she's this big. She's freaking fantastic. Yeah. Look at her. Look what I belived. And you guys, I saw her! That's right. It is CIUMYA reverse hand in a Japanese Liberty music gitti. And you're that beat when she switched the melody to the��ijd right away. She also looks so good when we're in. Now I see your head isn't there, so I'm going to push the horn, and sing it, and show you how to make it possible. We're going to ask some people for help, that they can and everything. How silly. How silly is that? Look at people losing it. They go mental. And then of course, it's time for their reply. We have to see that, of course, of course. Oh yes! Woohoo! Yeah! We call matching vocally, even though it's about this time. What about this time? She probably can. She's got pipes. Oh yes! What other comedians could do that in other parts of the world? Oh no. What could mean? Because you know that popular in other parts of the world? Hey, but also it's fantastic at this as well. Yeah, okay, but also it's a G.M. But I mean, like other comedians in other parts of the world. There are a few black comedians that do this fantastically well. Right, right, right. Names? I'm sure you know, right? But a showbiz, that's not really a thing. It's like a really Filipino thing, it seems. I feel like I think that's a very comedian thing. Yeah, like comedy thing. Like comedians in the Philippines are most likely also decent performers. Yeah, overall. I think in music, I mean. Yes, I see what you mean, yeah. Like you can at least do impressions. Ooh, girl! Okay! She's good. Nobody has any ears here, I thought that makes you so nervous. Old school, bro. Oh my god! They're right way again. Yeah, cut. She's let her cook. Let her cook. She really is eating. Done. Yeah, I throw it alone. Stop. She was joking there, but that was very good mix. That was fabulous. I also love it. What are they all? Filipino TV is fucking chaotic, right? Absolutely chaos. It's just like how much masking we make. And I love that approach to TV. It's like absolute chaos. And they also put that chipmunk in the back like that. All the time. I think they sang together as well. You go, girl. Yes, yes. I'm sorry, but she's going. Bro, look, I had necklips. Like a parallelip. No, I know, I still... Wow. I'm trying to so refined. Come on. She's good, yeah. Good girl. Damn. I'm sorry for them as well. That was freaking impressive, Jenna. That was a little bit blown away by that. Not gonna lie. That was pretty crazy. You know what? I wish. I knew who age is was early in my life. Yeah, same. Because they got the bangers that you need to sing when you're drunk. I'm a bit jealous of the people that grew up in that era. Same. Because there are such screaming songs, like I'm belted. It's such a good representation of like when you're having a f*** day. You just have to put an electric motor. Yeah. It's like, it's so good for that. And vocally speaking, they're so great. And the fact that I mean, the fact that a comedian can do this. And I mean, the fact that Jonah is so refined. It's such a, and she takes it like hearted. It's so fun. I like that aspect as well of sort of the Filipino music industry and the Filipino TV. Interim. I find it quite chaotic and quite nerve-wracking for the singers. But I think it's the best way to create raw singers in that manner. I also think it's a great way of like giving humanity to the singers that we... Like as a spectator. Like as spectators have really kind of like made nearly not human. You know, like you admire them so much for like what they do. Because it's so possibly difficult. And they do it to such ease, to such beautiful standard, like especially Jonah. In this case, you hold them to such high standards. To see them being so human, being so open to try and mess things around. And yeah, the entertainment aspect of it brings out this whole essence. We're all the same at the end of the day. You know, it's fantastic. A freak of nature. Chewie is so refined. Anyways, let us know if you guys would like us to check out any more videos. It is fun to go by this new old show. So if you have any old shows or cool moments, we'll have to check them out. Goodbye.
