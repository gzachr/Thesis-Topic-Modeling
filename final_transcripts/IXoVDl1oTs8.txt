All right, let's see what it's like living in the Philippines. This dude is white. I don't know if he's like half-sees or what, but he looks white to me. Just look white to me. Yes. We are also white. So what is his experience? This might be our experience. It's me. That has the US scratch shop. Oh, maybe he was born there. It's fine out. It does have an underarm. Is underarm. It's the same color as my shirt. It's literally the same color as my shirt. Let's do it. Here we go. Hi, sir. Already accurate. And do bye. Every time you go to a restaurant. Hi, sir. Where's the Filipino woman? There will be 307 pesos. I received 1,000. Do you have seven pesos? Sure. This happened to me in India all the time. They would always ask me if I had like five rupees or something like that. My coins were like the bottom. I was like, oh, and I just wanted to break the change anyway. Usually. But that's all that happens in Europe too. They're just like, that doesn't happen in the US. You give them a dollar. They just give it whatever right back. So it's always interesting when that happens. This is also like going through airport security in India. Good enough everything. Seven pesos, sir. Seven pesos, sir. Seven pesos, sir. Okay, mom. I don't have seven pesos. I'm sorry. But that one. Okay, sir. Here's your change, sir. People like to ask for exact change here a lot. That's true. This is us again. Bye-bye. In the fridge. Cookies. In the fridge. Don't know what's in. Oh, what does that do? I've heard of it. I don't like heard of it too. Instead of those sweat, it has to go in the fridge. This here runs faster when it slows down. Got it. To leave it. That's pretty cool to have. Yeah, leave the fridge door open and go out. Filipinos like to refrigerate basically anything that can be refrigerated. I like to take shots. We're doing drinks. We don't really want to live whatever is happening right now. It's a party. There's Filipinos are good with drinking shots. When you drink, you turn into women. Yes, and it also changes the time of day. Filipinos like to drink using one glass shared around the entire day. Why is this so sit-up here? I can see the remnants of his shot taking in the background there. That's a good looking group. Filipinos love their wildest tambourine. This is the greatest prune ever invented. Now excuse me for this one second. You need to have relations with that room. Hold on a second. I'm going to have a look at the rest of the room. I'm going to have a look at the rest of the room. Filipinos really love their wildest tambourine. Hold on a second. Oh, I'm tired. Pito, pito, peso, sir. Pito, you have pito, peso, sir. Pito, pito, peso, sir. Okay, sir. You know it's true. I don't know. I've never been there. All right. That is... Pino, I bet it. Pino, I bet it missed the stop. We didn't discover... We didn't do Filipino content on purpose. No, we did. We were in Kpop and we were like Kpop and then it's been 18. Honestly, I thought it was Kpop at first because we were sort of new to Kpop. At the time we didn't know any Kpop groups and then it's been 19. We were like this doesn't sound like Korean and then it was filipino. And we were like, oh, okay, and we started doing it. Then we had to pick up 18 and got a lot of Filipino subscribers. So we made a second channel, we were going to do a lot of geography reactions. We started with Korea and they did pretty well and then we did a filipine's one. And that's boom. And now we're here. And now we're moving, we're going there. So, SB19 started it all. If you're wondering how we got into this, it's SB19. And if you're wondering why we referenced SB19 randomly in these videos. That's why. So hopefully you enjoyed some of the things where I mean we know what to expect now if we're having a group alcohol meeting. Yep, we'd love group alcohol. Personally, I just love alcohol. I want to feel it burned all the way down. If you didn't know, I'm actually not even off leadal age to drink in the United States. It's still a piece of ice. I am. Oh, probably, am I? Probably. Thanks for watching everybody. Hopefully you enjoyed it. If you did, subscribe. Like the video, see you in the next one. Bye.
