 Yes! Hi everyone welcome to our channel 530am and at last we are going to our land to do some work there So, follow us and enjoy! Good morning! It's raining! It's raining a little bit! Here we go! Very early in the morning! I'm going to pick up three workers, check that! We have plenty of drinking food, we can't wait to get back! Thank you! Thank you! We are in Katipu now waiting for the others to have a coffee! We are going to have a nice breakfast! We are going to have a nice breakfast! And some fresh bread! We are going to pick up the workers! I thought so! I thought that was a good one! Hello mate! It's so funny! What is happening? I'm going to have a selfie! Did you expect to hear what we are trying to do? I want to see if I can get some money! Come here! Today we are going to prepare all these trucks! We can see we need to dig on the side! Right in the middle of the driveway, there is this big coconut stamp on the left! First the clean! That's the exercise today! We are going to have a good rest! We are going to have a good rest! We have the apples to help! We are going to clean the land and throw all the branch trees and everything out of the land! I love to cut here! Maybe we should start cutting here! Hey! Move! I'm going to cut here! No, no, no! It's not the right way! Your mom knows I'm going to play! Yeah, why are you working there? I'm curious! I'm currently with my plates holding my spoon! I can do nothing! Yeah, this is coming down! Tom, you did a good job! I don't know how we are going to do this! You can drive there! Maybe you have to come here? Yeah, no here! Just stay! And do the garage there! But this needs to go! No! I'm going to put the money on the tree! Almost finished! You're working so hard there! Okay! Are you done? I'm done! I'm going to put the money on the tree! Where did you put the money? I'm going to put it on the tree! Oh, this is the cable! I'm going to put it on the tree! Okay, James is doing some work! She doesn't have to do it just a little bit! Just like things! Because we haven't done any exercises in the morning! I'm working like the Egyptian! I think I'm going to lose some weight! I hope! She's trying! Even Mama helping! She's strong! Look at this! A lot of those movies! I'm usually an office person, so... But I don't mind to work hard! Pity my back is not... How they would have played and cis-cruse! That's how my spine is holding together! So I need to be very, very careful! I can hit! But I cannot lift! I'm not supposed to lift more than a cut on a milk! That's why the surgeon told me before I left the hospital! But it's looking good! We're going to bring a truck with dirt at the front to level up everything! And also at the back, where the driveway will take us to the garage! Maybe I will show you! So we're going to fill up all here! Because a bit of a galley there! And fill up from the road up to here! And then what we'll do... We're trying to get rid of this coconut tree stump! And then fill up all the way up to the coconut tree! Just here and then build the garage, facing this way! And the house will be just here! Just here, no foul! So that's the plan for now! That's the heartbeat today! This is almost about to fall! A big job! They're going to it two hours, something like that! But they know what they're doing, they know how to do! And here we're just leveling the driveway! After we fill all that, do a big parking area! The garage next to this coconut tree there! On the right side of the coconut tree! And the house will be built between those two... At the back of those two coconut trees! Yeah! It was sit for my woman! All good? Yeah, she's happy! Oh, this is almost coming off! It's moving! Hard work! Ah, it's coming off! It's coming off! Maybe not yet! Maybe I have to break more! Yay! Oh my god! Stop! Okay, we're pretty happy with the driveway! We can't do much more, they're going to have to fill! So now we start digging for the septic tank And the boys are digging for the fence! That'll be a good day once we get all of them! Yeah, we'll let him! Good girl! Just here! Just here! Just to spoil everything! No much, but they're still working out there! Anyway, see how we go! Okay, it's raining quite a fair bit now, so we're having lunch! Apologies to all the people who don't like when we're always eating on the video, but it's now a fall! We need to eat! We are human beings! Yeah, thank you! And look what they've done at the little tent! And everybody else having lunch at the back? Yeah! So as I always say, let's eat! Septic tank is the most difficult work, I think! It's a big one! Maybe too big, I don't know! Still have to go another meter deep! Anyway, I'm all the whole for the fence post I met! Well, we're there, we're buying some shrimps, because I love it! I'm a cook tomorrow! Just one kilo! Not too much water! Yeah, just a couple more or something! You want more? No, but I mean there's a lot of water then! I don't know! 50 lbs of shrimp! 50? Huh? 50? 51.5 kg? No, only 1 kilo! 1 kilo, that's it! What is this for? For 40 people? 1 kilo! I can't even do it! You know, listen baby, it's for water! I don't know! I don't like it! I don't know! Do I tell me that? The water may go off? Yeah, that's it! 1 kilo, yeah! Okay, good man! We'll buy again! Three eight here! I think! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! What's this? It's a baguette! It's a baguette! I want it too! Very muddy! I want it too! Yeah, good morning guys! Today is day three! And... of Milti Aura. Anyway, let's see how we go! We don't want! Okay, we're back at the line for the free, yeah? We had already two days before. We did some stuff yesterday, we're gonna show now. And now we're here on the... ...foot-day. And it's mad everywhere, right? It's very hard to walk here. So, Jan decided to take a shoes off. And she did well because... I just cleaned my shoes. And look at this! Yeah, if I can't lift my leg... There's so much weight under there! It's terrible! My work is still up there at the end. Doing the septic tank. Let's gonna look closer to see how this thing progress. This is how we have to. We need about... almost two meter deep. Get in there! That's hard work. And then we're bringing some stones... for the big two... ...timburg gonna put at the entrance. Two big posts for the gate. Can't wait to get this fence down with Bob wire. We've got people walking here all the time. Yeah, I don't want that. So... We thought to have a bamboo fence, but now we decide we put... ...Bob wire will make high enough. And nobody coming. But there are any given time. We had like eight, seven, eight people yesterday here. I don't want that. Something happened, they get hurt. You know, they may put on you and... ...you have to put the wheels. No, I don't want. It's just the best stop here. Is. So they will take you to the next town. It's good. I just picked up a cup of stone. That's it. I'm sweaty like a pig. What's up, baby? One more load and then... Yeah, we bring more. One and then we're gonna ask that man to... ...just separate the stones. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Only s***. Oh yeah! Walks back. We don't see shit. I went with that one day. Very niceâ€¦. Okay, we're getting somewhere. The second tower walk you on that mud. They still have to fill the just before the coconut tree and here and then put more of that sand. To make life a bit easier to walk around and carry things and then the other stage. Once everything is compact with a run, a bit of run, whatever you think is a compact bit by itself. There we bring some gravels. I very like it to find some hard worker. How much for the wheelbarrow? Two thousand and 150. Very handy. There's a few concrete posts we're going to install before going home. We've got one on position already at least. And that's to put a lot of small rocks all around. Otherwise, just to make sure it's all rigid, strong. This all looks okay. It's not perfect straight but this is not German engineering. This is all we've done. We got the 7-1 on the extremity and somewhere in between the fence. And the rest will be timber with an anti-theraume, I think. That's the cheapest way we can go about. Those things are 290 pesos each and it's 48. So imagine how much money is that. I don't want to spend on money in the fence. So I'm going to put timber in between. Okay, come back to your land. You got to hit me. This is the last post. I was still feeling up here. We are so tired. Going home after this. And I have 3 days rest under the bus. So I give myself holiday for 3 days. Rest day. Tomorrow we go shopping. We're going to buy a barbed wire, probably going to buy a couple more cement posts. We see along the road we need to put a nice fence, strong fence because it's a little road here. And the front. And the barbed wire for sure. The front. The front we were related. The front nobody can walk there.
