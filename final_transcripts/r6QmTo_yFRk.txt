 Impalmation, Applaia, Caranthiria, Paris, Tilleseria. Very similar, or actually the same, right? Is it not? Stop! Nelly! Demonetized! What's up Philippines? Welcome to a brand new reaction video here on the channel. I'm Mike. And I'm Nelly. To travel food and lifestyle vloggers based in the phenomenal country. Of the Philippines, we are permanent residents here. We live here. We are very happy to live here and we are happy to bring your reaction videos. Are you guys... Same as reaction videos, videos we should react to. And we react to them. And today we are reacting to... Filipino versus Spanish language similarities by Will Dazavitch. Interesting. Will Dazavitch is a guarantee that it's going to be hilarious. So let's jump right in. All right. One, two, three. This is the Spain Spanish versus Filipino Spanish harmon. Nice intro. How are you? I'm good. My name is Will and I'm from the Philippines. And this is... How are you? I'm in Spain. And this is the Spanish versus Filipino challenge. Are the Spanish versus Filipino Spanish challenge? Are the similarities between Spanish and Filipino Spanish chat? Something like that. We have spent the last two weeks together and we realize our languages are quite similar. Have a lot of the same words. Almost the same but different. Let's jump into it. Same time but different. How are you? How are you? How are you? How are you? I would say how are you? Because I'm from the south. But in Spain normally you say how are you? Say it again. How are you? How are you? How are you? You have to use the list for that. How are you? No, I say how are you? Because we don't say the list. You almost don't say the S. In the south we don't. But yes, standard Spanish will be how are you? I want to bring the list to the Philippines and say, How are you? I'm good. I'm good. I'm good. I love the list. I like it. It makes you sound good. I think you know. Okay, next word. And? Pantalón. Pantalón? Or pantalones? Very similar. Sorry, I'm half Filipino. It's my second language. I have my mom come here. I need to double check. Is it pantalón or pantalones? In Filipino. Pantalón. Okay. So for you it's pantalones. We can see pantalones or pantalones. For us it's not with pantalones. They're shopping at us. I know oras na. Okay, oras. Okay, so we have oras. Oras. That's the only word we have similar in that. La mesa. La mesa. But? La mesa is one word. So you would say the la mesa. What? Yeah, that's one word. For us it's mesa and then we have last mesa. That's a table. Yeah, no, ours is just a la mesa's one word. Yeah, interesting. Oh. And number 10. 10. Jess. Jess? Jess? Jess. Yeah, that's funny. But it's like J-E-S. But. Yeah. Yeah. But the pronunciation. Jess. Jess. Mom always knows. Press, cuatro, cinco, c'est, c'est, c'est, ocho. No, no, no, wait, wait, wait, sheté. Like sheté. Sheté. So sheté. Sheté. And then I don't know anything else after that. Bringing that back. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The next information. Information. Information. Information. Information with an M and M. Information. Information. For a P, don't you? Like, Pilipino. Yeah. Almost. Sometimes. Sometimes. That's just weird. Actually, I know that you say that. Sometimes. We say that again. Very often. I feel like when you say it, you just sound rich. Oh, really? That's how you like that. You just speak rich people, Pilipino, you know? That's me, me. Yeah, basically. Next question. Beach. Lailla. La playa. So, one word. One word. So you say. No, no, no, wait, I take it back. Apply. Apply. But I just apply. Apply. For, I guess it's. Boy, I'm going. Ah, la playa. But it's too worse. La playa. For us, it's. I feel like his mom said it. I'm glad. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, next. For us, it's a second language. Thank you. Thank you. Chango. Chango. Mono. Oh, it's not the same. It's not. I met this guy in Colombia and he asked me what my logo is. And I told him it's a Chango, which means monkey in Pilipino. And he said, oh, it's the same thing in Colombia. It's probably because it's so different. In Spain and Latin America, there's a lot of words that change a lot. And we actually don't understand them a lot of the time. So maybe it's a thing. For us, it's just. Like German and Austrian and Swiss. It's like Vienna and not Vienna. Sapatos, right? But no Z, not with Z. Sapatos. So you just remove our list and turn it into. So I know that it's for me. Just sapatos. Do you guys spell it with Z? Yeah, it's Zapatos. So in Spain, you say sapatos, but in Latin America, they read it sapatos. I guess ours is the same as Latin America, sapatos. Next. Mejas. Yeah, mejas. OK, we have medias. And we have calcetines. So calcetines is what we call medias. Medias, for me, would be tight. But in Latin America, medias is sauce. There you go. Mejas. So you don't have calcetines. No, that's like a, that's where you eat, right, Mom? Or to cough, then tiniya or something? Cough, then. Cough, then. Carendiria. Do you have that? That's really. I've heard that. In my life. You don't have calcetines. Mm-hmm. Ah. Ah. Ah. A carendiria is a calcetino term for a local eating and serving meals usually with wooden benches. A carendiria is also known as a terro-terro, which is a local eating point point in English. But times, customers usually point out their quarters. Ah. So you have longganisa and you have to-tofino. No, I'm not saying you like that. Just to know. Tocino. And, ah, you don't have a dabo. A dabo? Yes? What? So we have a dish. That's called a son. That's called a little bit of a cutting. That's like fried with totami, like the tempura. Totami. I think we'll mix the video funny. All of these special effects that you posted. ours has an S. It's very well done, which- It's more of a classic, it's plural with the same pan-fanas. If ours is plural, it's manga manzana. Yeah, if it's a small apple, what would it be? If it's a small apple? Manganita. Manganita. I didn't- I just learned that right now. It's pumpkin. It's pumpkin. You have calabaza. Oh, I thought there's a- So calabaza is pumpkin and calabasin is like a little pumpkin. It's a pinnacle. Do you have calamanci? Calabasin. It's a Filipino lemon, basically. I think- It's like a miniature lemon line. It's a feast, Asia. Wow. We're going down the rabbit hole from calamanci to calamanci. The calabaza to Manganita. I don't even know. Basically, it's pretty close. Hmm? Very cheap. Ooh. Sabanas or mantas? Or is it scubracama? Cubracama, that's Spanish. I would not use it that much, but if I said cubracama, it's rather than the bad sheets. It's what you put then after the bad sheets you put it on top. But then you remove it when you were sleeping. The scubre mean cover. Cover. So bad cover. And comma means bed. Bed. Yeah, so it's a bad cover, but it's not the sheets. Okay. Yeah. Under the stand. Under the stand. Intim-b. Okay. Long explanation for bad sheets. Oh, that's like past tense. So entiéndu is I understand. Well, that's so funny because entiéndu means I understand. No, do you understand for us? If I want to say do you understand, I would say entiéndu. And you will remind entiéndu. So it's like the other way around. Damn. Interesting. Yeah. Absolutely. I remember people were saying like- Oh, you should learn Spanish because you know Filipinos. So it's like similar. But for me, it's just more confusing because you know- You know it, but it's different. It just sounds the same. Yeah, I was really surprised because I didn't know Filipinos had so many Spanish words until I moved to the bind. And I was always rounded by a lot of Filipinos. And I would hear Spanish words. And I'd be like, wait, why are they speaking Spanish? And then I realized, no, it's just they have so many similar words. It's so interesting. Yeah, when I- When I listen to you and your friend speak, it's like every four-four- That's the conversation. Pick up the name. Trebajo, Pinto, Puerto, or something. Yeah. Sugar. Ah, sugar. Ah, sugar, right? Sugar, with an L. Ah, sugar with an L. Wow. It's actually in our word. It's like sugar or something like that. Mm. In Arabic. We got it from the Arabic. Interesting. I'll say the days of the week. What's the general word for? Let's go together. Lunes, Martes, Webes. I'm being- Sorry, sorry. Mirkoles, Webes. Bienes. Bienes. Sabato. Lingo. Lingo. I don't know why. I don't know why they decided to change Sunday. Lingo. Your favorite? Pediodico. You say that too? Pedi- Pedi- Pedi- I know Jari- Pedi- Diario. Yeah. So, the audio for us could be pediodico. Your favorite? Or it could be entire. Like a journal. You know. Journal is quaterno. Quaterno for us means a notebook. Yeah. Rather than journal, you write daily. That's Diari. Okay. Quaterno. It's the same. Quaterno. Paper. Or papeles. Which one is it? Papeles or papeles? I guess it's the same. Papeles and papeles. But plural for us is manga and papel. We don't add us like Americans or Spanish, too. You just add manga before the word. And then it makes many. Yeah. So, Libro book. Is that the same? Yeah, Libro. I'm just looking at whatever object is here. Manga Libro. Libro. Libro. I started with the pronunciation of... Silia. More opuan. Or salem poet. Or banco. Banco. There's a lot of lines. Banco for us is bench. Oh, really? Or bank. Or bank. Yeah. It's awesome bank. It could also be bank. Bia. Bia. Oh. Bia. But the way you say it sounds totally Latin American. It would say Biaje. Mijé. They pronounce it in certain Latin American countries. It's a Biaje. It's a Biaje. It's a Biaje. Okay. And we say Biaje. Okay, the month of... Hold the month. Okay. I don't... I can't. Can you... Can you... I don't know the months of... Genuero. Genuero. This is where my Filipino gets weak, mom. Okay, ready? Go. Start from... Start from January. Okay. Okay. I'm going to open the month of May. I'm going to be in July. I'm going to be in September. I'm going to be in September. I'm going to be in September. I'm going to be in September. Okay. Every single one. Okay, thank you. Very similar. Or actually the same, right? Glouendcha. Inglouendcha. Again, it's just the rich way to say... And you say, include... Inglouendcha. Like, in Pormachun. I might get roasted though, because, you know, again, it's my second language. I'm not like the best at pronouncing, but it's pretty much the same. And at least, you speak the language. Exactly. To all the Americans out there who make fun of me. You only know one language. Right now. Ah, ha, ha. Ahora. That's funny. That's funny. No, no, no. Sorry, I was speaking Spanish. Sorry, I'm Spanish. Sorry, I'm Spanish. Yeah, I'm getting confused. Nayon mismo. I want a mismo. Okay. And Filipino is parejas. Parejas. Yeah, parejas just means same. Or parejas means... Or parejas means both. Oh, no. Parejas, for us, means a couple or a pair. Yes. Or parejo, similar. So mismo, for me, is same. And in pareja, I mean, couple or a pair. Mismo is like just... ...on the dot. So, Nayon is now mismo. Right now. Same, same. Ahora means more like right now. Parejas. TV show drama. Tell us area. Do you have tell us area? Hmm. Are you saying tell a Nella? Oh, tell us area. TV show or TV show. Or TV show. Is it like a drama? Television. Television. Television. Television. Yeah. No, TV show. The billion. Wow, that's long. It's just a pilio. Without the... How do you call the brush to clean the floor? What is tincting? Can you say brush? Suclai, saklai? We can't put pilio. So we have to specify it's sufrash, not just the brush. So we say sepillo de vien. Sepillo de vien. Sepillo de vien. Sepillo is only the brush for... It's toothbrush, yeah. If it's for the hair, you say saklai or saklai. Suclai. Mom, what is it? One of those. Oh, I'm waiting. Mantika. Mantika is like more like a butter for us. Cooking oil. Like a paste. Like anamo fa and stuff. We will call that mantika. Oh, we have mantikija. We have two. That's more like everything. Yeah. For us mantikija is butter. No? Leche? Leche? Yeah. Put. Leche is like a bad word. You know. Right? Is it bad? Can you use it? No, we have to use it with a bigger sentence. You say someone has a bad word. If they are very rude or like very angry. But let's use it. No. The bad word goes very fast. But let's use it on its own. Well, I said put. Yeah, that's the same. I'm sure that's the same. I'm not international. Yeah, I might know that. Definitely that word is Spanish. And basically, yeah, that's like... Who's what you would say? Is it an interjacking? Demonetized! It's not about the word. Integalog, right? My mom's rich friends say that word. They say, Coneyo. But how I hear it more commonly used is like... When someone's rich in upper class and they're all like... They're like fans here, whatever. They're so Coneyo. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's you. You would use it like Coneyo. You know? It's like an interjaction. But it means that. Or you can say, What the hell are you saying or what the hell are you doing? We can add that to the sentence to make it more traumatic. But it's definitely about a word in Spanish. You would not say that in front of your kids. You know, I mean, it's like a Filipino. Don't use that word. You know, you're Spanish friends. Or do. Or do. Or do. I think that's it. This is the Spanish Spanish versus Filipino Spanish Spanish challenge. Whatever you harm on a homo. A lot of you import math to you. I'm going to start speaking Spanish. You like Spanish. You like it. You can do that in English. So that I can sound. Yeah, cool like that. So, Marame, Falaamat, and Yung Lahat. And I hope you learned something, whether you're from Spain, or Filipino. There are some other languages. Subscribe to Afu, Miftika. And Filipino, Azul, Nistaka.

And it was my favorite Christmas dessert. Yeah. And it got demonetized because I cannot say on this channel or the other channel what my favorite Christmas desserts because of monetization reasons. So yeah, we added in the title and YouTube was like, nope. No, we don't say that in the title. And it ain't Binkka. It starts with P. Yeah, it's...
