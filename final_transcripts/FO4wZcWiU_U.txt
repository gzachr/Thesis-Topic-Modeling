The palm tree's just covered in light. Oh my gosh. There's a lot of light. They put a lot on there. Oh my gosh. Oh my. Usually here is like one like single strip that kind of like goes like, there's big spaces like between these of a line. This one they're like, nope. Every digit light. The tree is going to become a light. Yes. They don't even need to turn on the street lights during that winter. Oh my gosh. That fairies wheel. That'll ball. They have a giant Christmas ball. That also shows WWE. Wow. That ain't a ball. I bet the most of the Christmas are super cool. But it's that. No idea. That Ube. Maybe with butter. Oh my gosh. That looks like something you see on it. Lots of Vegas slot machine around the outside building up. It just is light. But it's like Christmas. It's a little bit like a casino light. That's crazy. Instead of being Christmas, it'd be like strippers. Come in. Yeah, strippers. Gambling. Smoking a lot. Yeah. I was going to say only Santa. Oh. Wow. There's so many lights just in the background there. It's sparklers and balls. Oh. Vacations there. They don't all know. Everything seems to. Wow. For some reason, my first thought that was like, how do they have water? And then I was like, oh yeah, it's warm there in the winter. Oh yeah. It gets cold here. It would be frozen. Yeah. It would probably just destroy the pipes. We associate Christmas as being like snowy. Very snowy, very cold. Yes. Is that where we're going to do the dance? Yes. You're doing, sir. Smash in a bottle cap. Oh. They carry in for gifts. Oh, my God. She go blind, stabbing her. Oh, I didn't do it properly. Oh, they have a bunch of different ones. Christmas, a London. The Saika, Japan vlog. It has nothing to do with the music. It's a lot of fun. It's my London. The Saika, Japan vlog. It has nothing to do with Christmas. It's a Krenz G7 X Mark II. Wow, it's crazy. There's so many lights. Yeah, it's like, there's like the amount of lights that we would expect as Americans, like on a tree. But like, oh, it's lit up cool. And then there's Filipino lights. Just turn the tree into one of those neon light sticks things. I don't know. I don't know. I think that's their official name. The neon white stick thing. It looks like a lot of the businesses too. Like every single business had some sort of Christmas decoration where it's here, like some business will put up a Christmas tree with a few lights outside. What's going on? And the Philippines, they celebrate it for a lot of months. Yeah, it's so a lot of months. They got a lot of time to set up decorations. We're here. It's like, yeah, like a little window. And you're like, it has to be after Thanksgiving. Generally, some people do it earlier. Incidentally taken down the day after Christmas. Yes. That's how it works. It's only acceptable. I get it. The last final cutoff is January 1st. Yeah. Yeah. That is out. After Thanksgiving, which is November 25th, 26th usually around there. The like last Thursday of the month. And then, January, that is done. You have them up. You're free. Just somebody watching this is like, I don't think I'm free. We're just kidding. Yeah. We're just kidding. Anyways, thanks for watching everybody. Hopefully you enjoyed. We won't be making it to the Philippines for Christmas this year. Unfortunately not. May be in the other year. We'll be on the Zuerokron variant of COVID. Yeah. And every country will be shut down. The Zuerokron will be stranded somewhere in the middle of nowhere. Thanks for watching. See you later. Bye-bye.
