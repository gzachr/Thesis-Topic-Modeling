 We're coming in for we've been up to the Taliban and done some stuff up there uploaded some videos and we're coming back now. We need to talk to Team Yo about putting a small porch on to the house for either the let me see what we're calling the rubble house. And so we're going to go out and as well take another video of day two we're almost at the end of day two so this is a good time. Yeah they are almost finished in the roofings. Yes. In fact we started also the blocks and filing of the blocks. So some of the block was used already done. So this is the main part of getting the roof down and then we're concentrating on getting that block work after that it's all framing. Yeah I think Basit Timo was not here because it's Wednesday and once it's Wednesday he has he excuse up at 3.30 for prayer meeting. Oh there's a prayer meeting because he has passed the Timo. So that's what we've done. Well I say we that's what has been done in two days which I think is amazing. So this has been a foreigner in the Philippines.
