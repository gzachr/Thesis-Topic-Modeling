 Hey guys, welcome to another daily juice. This one's a little bit of a different one. George had a hilarious idea. Can we share this? A genius idea last night. A load of you often comment and say you found our videos from an old video in the Philippines and we were looking at our channel and we have like 200 videos from the Philippines from the last sort of few months alone. We first edited the Philippines in October last year and George said why don't we react to how we were, how we reacted to it's really wonky on the thing it's an ad look. Is it wonky? It's really wonky. I think I can see it like that. It's straight in it. I can't tell you what. We reacted to how we like the food we ate, how we were with like the people because it was just like for us the Philippines means a lot more to us now than I guess it did at the time we first got. Yeah we knew nothing about the country when we first arrived. It was more just another stop in Asia, a country in Asia we've never been to. Let's go and see what it's all about. Somewhere on our list to visit and kind of tick off. We're so grateful the channel is growing so so fast it's unbelievable. We get a new subscriber every single day so we thought it'd be fun for the OG viewers of the vlog who's gonna remember some of these clips and for the new viewers of the channel we didn't see these vlogs and for us who haven't looked back at this for a long time pretty sure my pair and beard might be a feature of this we thought it'd be fun to look back. What we've done here is we haven't watched these clips yet we purely just picked a few different parts of four or five different vlogs from last year it was purely from Paloan which is where we first went and see and that was like the first two and a half weeks you spent before going off to Taipei and then before we came back again just go to the studio and all the other places. So briefly. Thank you. We put together a little thing so we can just press play on this and watch it it's cut up bits from different vlogs but when I edited this together I didn't sound on I didn't watch really what was going on I just kind of broke it up so. Okay. Neither of us have seen this for good reactions this seems so old now this is like November last year. Yeah October. October last year right okay. Is it editing during Lucy? Three, two, one. Right okay so we are now in the fitness. We are in port princesses. There are so far. My face is so far. To look at the conversation is like oh so where are you after the after Manila and you're like oh I think we're gonna head over to Dancer. Look at my beard it's so long. And he's hard because I'm not there as well. For that you literally think like he's wondering what we're doing like. Yeah where are we. This is when we messed up coming into the Philippines. We didn't realise we needed a flight out and we had another flight. See how it goes. Still planning it. Yeah still planning it. Ah well if you don't know why you're going next and you have no proof of one when trampling then I can't check through into this flight. Yeah we nearly didn't even come to the country at this point. Yeah we could have gone to another country at that point. And we didn't know how long we've been there either. Imagine if we never came here. Oh how long we want to spend in the Philippines either. I just called it a tuk-tuk. It's a tricycle. Oh yeah. We just called it a tuk-tuk. We just like. We just like. We just like. I'm just riding it. Sorry. First tricycle ride not tuk-tuk. Oh my goodness. Okay so we're on this crazy tuk-tuk. They're so different to like in Cambodia or whatever. And the guy just saw somebody new. He's like wait one sec. Oh yeah. Classic. Yeah. He's into the side of the road. Yeah now that's casual and now he's pulled up to see his friend. No idea what's going on but. That's so normal now. So I think that would be like yeah cool no worries bro. Take your time. Yeah. It's short. We've gone for this. Oh this is so. We said listen. Uh low the low. Halo, halo. Halo, halo. Low the low. Halo, halo. Halo. It's a gram. I know what kind of is with this. Yeah. Try this dessert. We've got some luck. You guys went crazy in the comments. We called it a halo, halo. And we didn't mix it. No you're meant to wait for that bit. But I just know because I remember the comments in this video. It's all you just we just ate each individual piece. The people who served it to us didn't tell us we were supposed to mix it. Yeah. Love it. And the ice cream looks good actually. So we just screamed from cornflake. Some cornflake. Jelly cubes. Oh no. We just start eating it from the top. Yeah. And this also is not a very good one either was it? If you still don't know if you're watching this and you don't know. This is called halo, halo. You're supposed to mix it completely. It translates to mix, it translates to mix, man. It literally means mix, mix. But we really went short because it was a very good one was that. Order. Tell me if I'm pronounced chicken or bodo. A bodo. That's it right. Yeah. This is the first time we ever tried Filipino food. Proper Filipino food. Yeah. And we look on pictures but I hate it. Because we were told before that Filipino food is not good by loads of people. Loads of people warned us when we came to like the food's not good. Now we love the food then. Well that city doesn't look good though does it? That's what we look the best. It's nothing like a Ling-Loo thing. Oh yeah. And you know, mangillus. So we've got, I hate to look over here because I'm not going to remember that. This is the pork, is it? I don't know what this is on top. But we didn't know it was pig's face. We got the chicken. We just thought it was bit of pork. I think I said in a minute. I think this is crispy pork. And I've got two dots of fries to have I think with a soup and chicken with a coming fries. And I'm not eating with spoons at this moment. I used to using fork and spoon. I really want to try that pork. Yeah, got it. You go first in the pork. Okay. Now this one isn't the one that's a shirt. I think with this we just googled most famous Filipino food because we wanted to try I say smells absolute dishes from the Philippines but I think we went to like, um, more of a touristy restaurant right? Yeah. And it wasn't that authentic. It's so good though. I did like it I think. I think it's pretty much crispy fried pork and crispy pork. I had no idea it was a pig's face. It's very nice. Wonder if that would have been a famous one. I think we would have been nervous about that back then. Cracking but juicy up. It's onion from our day. No, I like it. I think that looks like pudding glory. That actually wasn't a very good synagame. I remember we had such good synagame now. Yeah, who's the best? Jones easily. Is it sour? Is that what it is? I really wasn't sure. Yeah, I can tell why it's called that. I don't think you like to that much. I can tell it's sour. We say it I think. It's probably a bit too fishy for me if I'm on this. Like, I just like it from. We always like to be honest. She has a normal part. It does taste sour. Well, it not sour like something sour. This is what I like about our bloggers. No, we always say that like still to this day, we're always honest and genuine about if we like something, if we don't like something, if it's not for us. I want you to do it. And we've always been like that from the start. That's too hot to be cut because it's sweet inside the actual shell. We have made such a mess of this table. I'm glad we got a big table. The guy that did the table. No, what did he do? I looked why you feel a bit. Yeah, I looked quite fat. Don't know. You look kind of fat. I look rough. My beard, long my hair, long. It looks like you've done that in your beard. A little bit chubby in the face. Let's. I love you not so much weight between the two of us. But we want the road from like August onwards, like heavy travel. 7-11 cookies every day. Bad diet, yeah. Chicken and pork, person name. I can appreciate it. I'm supposed to have rice with this. Yeah. All right, okay. Are you? I still don't know if you're supposed to say it's pretty salty, yeah. Oh, it's okay. I put the right into the soup. I don't think you're meant to do that. Come over though. Are we still in a way? I probably still would do that now. For the second time. Okay, watch this. And hopefully the right weight this time. Hello, hello. Because I know it's not halo. Halo, halo. It's a boy. Hello, hello, hello. Hello. At least you corrected me. I felt like we're up high. We're now. Hello, hello. So we're going to try that now. Again. Okay, do we know to mix it though? I don't know. I think hope so. What the other one that looks very different. Okay. I think it's almost better. This is the second time. I think we've been told that you're supposed to mix it. Please do. Everyone's going to be like, that is not how you mix it. Yeah. It might be pretty hard to mix. This looks better than the previous one. I can't see if it's mixed. See if it's too full full. No. Yeah. Noodles. Noodles. Well, they've been noodles. This was a, this was our needo. Yeah, this was a good barhead. I mean, in St. Burgers, I remember. Oh, you're not going to lose it, loser. Oh. How long will that do? It gets longer. Okay, like a, it was just a solid block. Gentle mix. There we go. Okay, we mixed it. A few. We're deened ourselves. We cash out to get actually get anywhere. Rainy. Yeah. You get different that. Yeah. It's a bit now. No, no, no. We'll try it as we've dropped us. It got so much. That was after a long bus, though. We'll wait for it inside. It could be a bit chilly. We've had a few comments recently, so we have to try this place. It's like, I think we've never been in a jolly bee before. No. We've got a need like cutlery. Got any cutlery? Cutlery. No, we've got the chicken, right? There you go. So we've got to get... From the bus terminal to here, we had to first get some cash out, so we had to get a try-school to drop us. This guy scammed us, isn't he? This is when we pretty much got ripped off by a try-school driver. So we have been quoted before, like, five, ten-minute journey. We've been paying like 50, 17, maybe a little bit more paid, so there's a go. This guy was like, this is like a ten-minute journey total. Obviously, there'll be maybe like five minutes of waiting for the A.F. So maybe 15 minutes, but it's all down one road. Nine-cent simple journey. And this guy was like, yes, it's going to be 200 each to get to the 80s. 400 each. Just to the 80s. You used to get from the 80s into here, which is literally a 30-second journey. A thousand pesos, pretty much. There's been 900 pesos. We've got them down to 200. Nine hundred. Nine hundred for ten-minute journey. I remember... And even 200's too much. I remember we got them down to 200, and then we put this vlog out, and even in the comments, people were like, 200 is too much for that. Still too much, I'd say. We went down to 200. We actually gave him 300 a day, because... Why are you giving 300? But we had no idea at this point. We thought... With our choice. Compared to English money, that's still cheap. Wait too much, we get more closer. Okay, I'm going to go straight in with this spaghetti, because I'm going to go... Joyly beast spaghetti. We get to eat. That is expensive. It's like... It's a bit too much. This is so funny, like, we... It's a bit bad. We know what they're so much now. Yeah. It doesn't feel like ours. Oh, this feels like so long ago. Make sure you comment below if you were watching these vlogs, if you remember this. Yeah. And also, let us know which video you first saw on the channel. What made you subscribe? I saw loads of people with spaghetti at the till. Like, it seems very popular. Oh my god, that's so nice. Getting mad. I was so in love with it. I loved it. We still do like, do I? So good. Oh, this is our first experience of like, a paradise in the Philippines. This... Oh yeah, this was great. I'll need it, right? Yeah. Tour A. Look at this. This... Okay, Thailand. Do I still... Thailand forget it? Do I say insane? Probably. This is our old GoPro as well. It looks very bad. Yeah, true. Very shaky. It's still right. It's a bit worrying. We need to do some like this again. I've missed this one. I'm craving a beach. Yeah. But we're getting here for all the tourists too. We need to... I don't want to go to the beach. I think it's one of those little great clouds pretty looking like this. Did you ever say I'm like, we're getting here for the tourists. Go inside. Tourists everywhere. We want to sit down, need us. It's all right. But to us coming from Thailand and Cambodian stuff, it was quiet. We felt like this was untouched. If we went now, though, it'd be like, whoa. Yeah. It's quite difficult. And you're here, like it's meant to be cold. It's much colder in here. Didn't you lose your sunglasses here? Or did I lose mine? No, it's just my hair band. You lost yours. No, you lost your hair band. Oh yeah, I lost my hair band. It's quite a small gumbag. It's about all around. This was such a special day that it wasn't there. We loved it. But it was my set. Yeah, it was my set. Pulling into the highlight. Look at the water. This is the peak. This is the Pike Peak on all the brochures. Oh wow. It does look amazing. I mean, I'm like re-reacting to it. And it's still incredible. So there. Oh, I'm going to get it. That's incredible. And this was where we had, and all the books do exactly the same thing. You'll queue up and get a pitch on the front of the way. I know all the boats around this. You know, we had lunch here, and it was like all Filipinos eating with their hands. And then we were there like, Oh yeah, British couple with a knife and a fork. Spoon and fork. Spoon and fork. And they were like using their hands and cheering the rise. And we didn't know what to do. I do this day again, actually. They're just preparing that one out for us. I'm just going to sit here and enjoy this and hopefully go for a little bit of a dip in this walk. It was what I've never seen water so clear. You can go from back. But it's still blue. Never seen water so clear. For a climb. Yeah, no we haven't. Yeah. Look at that, though. So nice. Okay, this is that little beach. So we haven't watched this since we did it. We don't really want to have logs back that much. The way back up there. I haven't seen this since we filmed it. There's a little swimming spot down there we can go to. But it's just so quiet, isn't it? So nice. I think it's on the tour to that way. And we're just here like on our way. Amazing. Such a nice beach. So nice. That was a really nice beach. Wow, that's really nice. Look at the water. Look at all my sunglasses. I just did that shot. I got it under and I was wearing my sunglasses. Why? You've got all these mountains above us with blue sky. And then you come lower and there's palm trees and then there's these gorgeous little huts along the seafront. There's people on the swing, chilling out having a great time, laughing on their families. And and this is when we first started realizing what the culture was like, what the people were like and how laid back the vibe was. There he is. There he is. Look how happy I am. That was a good day. Really, really good day. So nice. There he is. Slow-mo on the go. All go pray. Okay, yeah. Did you slow-mo just wasn't back in quality? End of that one. That way, then. Oh, 4.35. This was not a good day. We're up. Jim, what happened? He's going to be trying to go to crime. We've got a cat. We're all packed up. We're leaving. How's it going? We're ready. We're going. Just going. So good news. Um, so I'm coming. Good news. This is a lovely day here. I'm a positive guy. Bad news. Is that the ferry's been cancelled. We just asked if there's going to be one tomorrow. Have some. Because of the weather, right? Get annoying, but rather they cancelled it. If it's a safety thing. This was like typhoon season. There's a lot of rain. And we still haven't been to crime. We really wanted to avoid it. This was our chance to go. We couldn't go. And we couldn't go later. Like wait a few days because we had a flight there. To tow on from Princess there a few days later. It's 6.30 to bring to the city. Are you alright? Look at my hair. Shit friends. The... You met Tannu. Basically there's no line. More Tannu and I do now. I don't know. But it was a beach day. The time travel wasn't out. The day was so long. People were so long. The ship. The ship. Run. That's their day that's been cancelled for them. And we've got to go. This place is so nice. So wasn't it? It's a Sabrina. Yeah. I'm going to risk that. We don't want to get stuck there and not be able to get back. Peak house. You know, I'm going to go. Peak house gardens. Peak house gardens. It's much clearer than what we've seen. We sit flying down here last night. This is our first ever Philippine Sunset. At the beach. At the beach. Like properly... That's the thing. And we never... Yeah. We drank. We never drunk. I have never used to drink. Thailand and maybe Vietnam had a couple of beers like in a month. No, we did have quite a few in Thailand. Oh Thailand, yeah. But between... Oh no. A week before Hong Kong. Oh yeah. We did this drink. I don't think we drank since Hong Kong before these beers. True. That was it. This is the first time we properly went just to watch Sunset and did a different thing out. Oh, it's so nice though. What's your film at? Oh, it's a film at. And we didn't have our train with us. Because we did a Christmas. Oh yeah. Oh look at that. That was really nice. Yeah, really nice. That's when I fell in love with the Philippines. I think we were just sitting there. Just appreciating this more. We'd had the best light couple of weeks. Old encod. Old encod. So good. So nice to look back on isn't it? Oh that's crazy. Yeah. We literally... Yeah, we don't watch old vlogs. No. Maybe we should. Yeah, that is so nice. I hope you enjoyed reacting to those with us. Do let us know if you watched those old vlogs. Yeah, and what you think of how we've changed or like our reactions how... Yeah. They have far we've come up, I want to say. Because I feel like we have grown up a lot since that. Like, it kind of feels like different people. Yeah. I don't know. And then let us know if there's any more specific moments that you've watched with us. And that you want us to react to again. Because we literally haven't really watched anything. Yeah, it's fun to look back. If you were there with those vlogs and before, huge thank you to you. And to any new people on the channel subscribing, as I said the channel was growing, absolutely amazing. We're so, so grateful, so, so happy. If you enjoyed this video, please give it a thumbs up. I really feel like we're doing like an old saw video right now. And I like sit down. We never... Yeah, we used to see some of you do. Like thumbs up, subscribe to me. Do all the stuff. You guys have to do it. Yeah, you guys are doing it anyway. You're amazing. We love you. We'll see you in tomorrow's daily juice. Oh, what we're doing tomorrow, but today. Yeah, which is being filmed today. It's kind of... A bit confusing. A bit confusing, but not confusing for you. As normal. Oh, it's a good one. Well, I don't know, okay. We haven't done it yet. We're about to do it, but it should be good. All right. See you tomorrow. Bye.
