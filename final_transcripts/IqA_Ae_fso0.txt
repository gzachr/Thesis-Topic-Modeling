See what kind of like Americans who Americans think is like the most beautiful and most handsome. And I think it's really interesting type of video because I remember when Times Square looked like this. Let's see. These six famous Filipino celebrities. We got Nadine Luster. We got Maine Mentosa. We got Liza Silverana. We got Catherine Bernado. We got Mame and Trata. And we got Ann Curtis today. It'll just be interesting to see who in American size and people who fall around the world here in New York City for their own beauty standards, who they think would be the most attractive and wise. Yeah, guys. And if you liked this video, please subscribe and let me know what other types of videos like this you guys would want to see. So, um, see you in New York. Come on. I should try to collaborate with you. Today, as we are asking people to judge the appearance of these six celebrities. I thought it was superficial, isn't it? A little bit, yes. The idea behind it is that a lot of people in the Philippines have their own sort of perceptions of what they do. So, the idea here is to sort of see, like what people's beauty standards here are like. This is totally superficial, but knowing nothing else about these celebrities, who would you say personally is the most attractive and wise? The person trying to meet everyone. Yeah. Well, all attractive, but for me, probably is the most attractive. Yeah. I don't know. I like her hair and her jabs. Oh, he's turning red. Right? Awesome. Thank you so much for being so red. Thank you. So, we have six celebrities here. We're already popular in the Philippines. I mean, we want to know, like, the important to people's own beauty standards here, who they think is like the most beautiful one. Okay. Well, I wouldn't compare them all because they have like all different types. They're so beautiful. Yeah. I can't pick a sort of one because they're all gorgeous, right? And they're probably of their own personalities. We'll stop like that. Sure. Sure. Do you see anything similar to the other one? Oh, yes. I see. It's really pretty too. Why? Why? Why? Not to speak up. Okay. Wow. We want to see what people here are according to their own beauty. Uh-oh. These standards, we think it's the most beautiful one. Okay. Or attractive. So, who would you think? I think it's the love one. Eat that. Huh? Oh? That's awesome. Eat it. You think me? Yeah. Why? Her eyes. I'll be eating her eyes. Her smile. It's so beautiful. What do you think we do? Yeah. Okay. It's funny how certain groups like all think the same person is attractive. Like they all agree on it. Which is interesting or they all think it's just like group. It's very mentality right there. We can see our cards from there. Probably C or VVP. Oh. It's just to help the most. Yeah. Oh, it's hard.

We're just kind of looking to see like, basically how people do stand as different here than those people. Yeah. And so like, how people here would perceive this celebrity's going to fit one of the particular that might stand out to them to see particularly the floor chapter. I would say A is beautiful. Yeah. Why? Um, I'd just say her eyebrows look nice. She has full lips. She has good cheekbones. Yeah. Her hair with the part. She's looking at the lip. Right? Interesting. Cool. Because of the brand now. What would you say? I think they all look great. Yeah. Any of them can walk down the street and I would like, uh, they're pretty. I think they look like Filipino. I wouldn't be able to smell the bean. Right. I think so. Yeah. They look all American. No. These two look like Hispanic. What? B and B and C and C. Even white. That's white. That's right. I'd say like that. That's a little bit of a look. I mean they're all pretty. I mean D. And D-Ray. I'd say B or D. Okay. Um, I think A. A. Why? I think I'm good at eyebrows. Eyebrows. Her lashes make her eyes down. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think? What do you think? Why do you think that? I think they're small green. And they're like brown. Brown. Okay. I think they're nice.

Next time. Next time. Yeah. So these are all very famous celebrities in the Philippines. And we're looking to see what people hear. What do their own, like beauty standards. What do you think of the most beautiful or attractive? E. And white. So why she had the full face of makeup? No. Oh. It's not. E because you know. Back in my city, I'm from China. For the most. For the most. Toronto's the time. Yeah. Me neither. Back in my city. I don't see girls like that. I say seeds. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see. I see her smile too. I see her smile. What's she is like. What is the type of makeup? Yeah. I see. I see. Look at her. I see. I see. That's like, naturally pretty. I think it's because she has big eyes. I like A because she has big eyes. I have a full face. I see. Be her see. Like. That's the thing. That's the thing. I'm not like that natural. But that's like. She's like. I like G2. You know. G2. G2. She is your ex. Not bad. I think she came out to farm. E she's trying to harm. E she's on Tinder. See? She's a movie star. But E she looks like art Carly and A. That's my girl. I'm done. Thank you guys so much. That's right. She's a nice guy. Maybe I was his girlfriend. C B and D. C B and D. Yeah. Why? I have no idea. I just think I've got a great eye. I don't know. I don't know. I love that. I love that. I love that. That's a good one. D. Okay. For the one that stands out to you, it's particularly beautiful. I only went over to her there. I think she is. See? She's like, I don't know where they are. Just look at the edgy. Yeah. I like C the best too. She's more edgy. She for sure. I like the edgy. See? Is she an actress? Who would see? She's a lot of them. They? They're more decent though. D. Yes. What? She has more of a natural type look. Yeah. But also it looks really like, from an, I don't know, I like you. They're all pretty cool. Like, it's a natural look off the curve. What? I have to go to D too. D. Yeah. What? Same thing. Like, natural. Right. Just natural. Natural. Yeah. I mean, for one that I would say, you have to use attractive means to me. What? Mostly because I like her smile. She's like, cool. Cool. I think the two of you guys showed more fierce games. Yeah. Right. Cool. Yeah. Thank you guys so much. Wow. So Liza, so brilliant. I think that was really interesting. It was actually, you know what? To my mind, that seemed like a very close race. Like, I really think that people had a hard time choosing. And it wasn't really surprising. They're all, are obviously very beautiful. Personally, I think some interesting things that stood out for me were that I think people really kind of appreciated like, a natural look sort of. They didn't really necessarily appreciate so much makeup. But a lot of people did also like that kind of like sexy look. Anyway, thanks so much for watching. And we'll see y'all next time. Guys, I don't know if I agree with that, right? Because they, like, they everyone kept voting for C. I feel like out of the most, it said 7 on there at one point. And she had the most makeup on. I think two, another part of understanding beauty is that it's all subjective. So it's all your type or whatever. But also it's the picture you use. It could be an angle. There could be like, I worked with photographers that are like amazing photographers. And I look like I should be on the cover of vote kind of photographers. And I get work as a model because these photographers are so good. And I've worked with photographers where you look at me. And I'm like, oh, God, can I rip that photo up? Do not show that picture of me to anyone. It really just depends on the lighting. Also the makeup, too. If you're working with a great makeup artist, my makeup artist from Moonstar Beauty, she's amazing. She puts a makeup on my face. And I'm like, oh, my God, I look like a movie star. Then you can also work with some people that you will be crying in the bathroom after they do your makeup, like hiding, trying to fix some of the stuff they've just beat on your face. There's some makeup artists that are really, I don't know, what they're doing. They're just so bad. So all of these things are factors. But guys, most importantly, beauty is skin deep, for sure. It is definitely, definitely skin deep, for sure. And guys, you can always work on yourself. That's something that I think is especially during this time. So important to work on yourself. Let's give a shout out to exo-man. And well, ex-x-i-a-o-man. And y-c-oh my goodness, we're in New York, you see. I'm gonna, I'm gonna find him and collab with him because he's smart, guys.
