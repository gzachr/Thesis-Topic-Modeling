You cannot eat inside without the back to neck to call. All our food is worth to be ordered. You should be mixed to the right. Yeah, you have mixed. So we could earn you. Before we need all the coffee is just in the plastic. Now, they put in the bowl. I think the manager is changing. Right channel? They've been. So we order big mouth and large fries. And of course large coffee. So we have to eat. Let's eat guys. So this is like just snap but I'm not planning to eat dinner. But of course, half is planning to eat dinner little. So yeah, that's the new thing. You cannot eat without the boxen. No dining to the toilet. Yeah dining to the toilet only. But I think if you just buy out a big out, that's the thing. It's okay. Only when people want to eat here inside then they will ask for boxen. I'm good. You paid for this? Thank you. You can take it on. It's a new thing before they just use like a carton. Right? It's like a carton. You want to have a hamburger? Right here. Now, they put in the bowl and then... And even the quantity seems to be more. The whole thing is in the glass. It's been a while since I ate it. I think. What is that? I put three sugar. I mean the honey is a thing. It's a thing. It's a thing that's a little bit less. They do it one? Yeah. They can put it on. They do it with it. You know, I put it in the bowl. I don't need to go there. I put it on. I don't need to go there. And sugar. Nothing. I put it there. Okay. Right. Let's see. So I think my sugar... They can ask for it. One of them. We are one of them because... So I just used the chili for the sweet and other one. She's not because she's only 17 years old. Yeah. Now giving for the baby to me. We're giving it 8 years old. Now, it's been 12 years. I really need to eat this. So we've got a fried one today. Yeah. But it's so tiny. It's very... It's more nice with it. No, but look at the big natural size of the baby. It's very big size. And the picture is also big. That's it. There's one time that we eat here. And then we serve us a Wednesday and it's called... And also the second one. So we think we didn't complain about that guy. He's giving it to us. Whatever. He's a chef. You guys told us that if you don't like the food, you always told me. That's why I don't complain. We complain that time. We give us the new one. It's hot. Coffee and the... When we find the coffee, it's not that hot enough. That time, we give it to the manager. Yeah.
