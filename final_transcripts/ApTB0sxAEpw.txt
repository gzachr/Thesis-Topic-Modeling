 But you're Friday. The freshest. Miss Universe. Miss Universe just happened and you have the lineup for the performances in the Miss Universe in the Philippines was absolutely insane. You know, the whole thing happened in the Philippines right? Yes. Well, nice. Mori set some concepts. Yom. Yeah, easy meal. Easy meal. And those are also another performer which I would then recognize which I think it was. He said was like J.M. something. I do apologize. I mean, it's hard to know everyone's name. But yeah, maybe if you'd like us to check out some of those performances, let us know. But obviously Mori set one and this was very requested in the last few days and she performed power which is a new song. So let's give it a watch. Oh, it's so damn good. She looked amazing. I'm going crazy. She did. Look at this. Yes. Look at that hair. The coronation. Oh, my dress is great. You go, girl. Oh, my dress is great. You go, girl. Oh, my dress is great. I'm going crazy. I'm going crazy. I'm going crazy. That's absolutely stunning. I have to say. Oh, my poor. Look at all the beautiful women coming out. Yes. I have to say, this is probably one of the most pleasant on the eyes videos. But that we've reviewed in the channel. But sometimes when I have a look at some of these performances, well, it's not that big and they also miss universe stuff or like the shows, the pageants are they called? But obviously some of the performances go really viral. Like I think the weekend one because I think his wife or something was it or his girlfriend was in the thing. Oh, you're talking. Is that so nice? You're getting it all going. Victoria Zick, that was great. That was so cool. I thought you just made a great show. Oh, nice. So for those type of performances go viral, right? One of the things I noticed is that the audio and the performers, it's actually not like up to standard sometimes because it's not a show made for music. But the fucking fact that Maurice says sounds to that standard here. I mean, I got to say like, I got to say like it is. Some of those shows, the music's garbage. It's like straight trash. Because it's on the Philippines, that was one of the questions that I have to validate. I was like, I wonder who's going to do a show? It's turns out ABS is the one broadcasting, broadcasting everything. And they have one, I think one of the most difficult shows and they put it on every Sunday. I said nothing to. And all these singers basically, they're pedigrees from that show. That's true. You know what I mean? They're all used to your singing live, bro. And you had like a date to rehearse this and you blow everyone's mind away. So that, I think this is a great example to highlight that. Like the pedigree of singing in the Filipino music industry. It's on another level in comparison to other parts of the world. And you can notice it in shows like this. So if they were going to host it in any country, like any of these music shows, I'll be more inclined for them to do it in places like the Philippines. Because they don't bullshit with audio. That's right. I agree. And they also prioritize the comfort of the singer itself, the performer. Because it's about them as much as they do about the girls in the pageant too. So it's a pretty well balanced outlook, especially in how we're seeing it here. Which is also the mix that we're getting through, but the people outside. So like the TV version of it. Yeah. So that mix is different to what they were actually getting on the stadium or the studio, or whatever they were performing the set. It's a completely different mix. So it's compressed differently. So the fact that it sounds that clean here, it tells a lot of why was happening in there. Oh, you think we're getting the live-ing mix? Yes, I think so. Okay. Ooh, they're even better. See, that's like it. Like the gates are done differently. That's more realistic. I think I'm off. Las Vegas. Las Vegas. We good. Okay, Boris is killing that song. Ooh. Mattanis. So these are women from the Philippines. Oh, yeah, well, that looks like confidence. That looks like confidence. That's how beautiful dresses do fall on that. Ooh. So that track, do you guys want them? Do you guys like the chorus? Rainy, cool. Oh my god, what a dress. Oh, god, they're... Iris? I'm a blue-and-white. Oh, no idea. Cool. She looks like a fucking power ranger, but I'm supposed to save the world. Oh my god, what a dress. Ooh, yeah. What's that? What is that? Yes. Oh my god, she's absolutely gorgeous. Good. Mori said he's murdering bro. Oh my god, Mori said. Oh my god, Mori said. Gosh, what a hell. What a freaking... She's Miss Universe, Philippines, 2021. Richie Gomez. Gosh, that's difficult. She's from... Oh my god, what a deal. She's from... Oh, she's from... With that name. So they showed it to me. Good, Miss Gracious. My god, Mori said. Mate. What? That's fucking outrageous. She was just chilling there. But you know what I mean? The caliber of singing, dude. That key change wasn't the same. It was so necessary. You didn't have to make that difficult. Well, you did. The reigning queen was coming through, right? So you were the most drunken. Okay, name me another singer. That would have probably chosen. I think like, here, something, you know, that caliber, like Adele, you know, she could do something very impressive. Yeah, dramatic. It would be so glamorous. You were, it's like I ran a grandi. It could be very impressive. I'm 100% I ran a grandi. They could do that. It does have a range of enslave. But again, it's like, hand... Pick. Oh, Jessie J. She would be able to do something crazy. Very impressive. Yes, she would. But yeah, I just don't... I also because of the crowd, right? Like, you're in the Philippines and life music. It's... It's... It's a pretty big deal. It's appreciated at a different level. And that's so hard to sell to like another demographic. It's like, in Abro, it's like, life music is a top notch priority. Well, it goes like that, right? It's like life music and then like, it goes like pageants. They're like so close together, right? Yes, it's... They're like so intertwined to the culture itself in the Philippines. That is such a huge... A deal to be hosting Miss Universe in the Philippines must be incorrect. What are those provinces? That's some... Fuck me. Some attractive women. I must visit now. I don't know if each contestant was from the Philippines there. I don't really understand. For one of them, she said we'll see it. That's definitely for the Philippines. And last being yes, I know that's a province as well. Yeah, so maybe they were presenting the Philippines. Right. And then, because they're the hosting country. Right, friends. And then they have like the reigning champions or former champions. No, there's not champions. There's queens. They're reigning queens. Like, well, it can't be a champion. What are you talking about? Well, yeah, you're sure, but it's not like you're champion. It's like you've got your girlfriend. It's like... But it's not a championship. Oh, right. Well, it's not like in tennis. But you're competing. You are. That's like how to explain to a guy. What about our beauty pageant women? It's not football. But yeah. For the queen. Yes, yes, yes, yes. It's fair enough. I don't know. They're all good looking women. That's like, you know, that's what it counts. Absolutely fantastic. And let's talk about Mori said. Absolutely. How do you win? Like, is it votes? I think the judges vote. Oh, the judges. I think there's a line of judges. And they're like very serious. And based on what? How you walk. Yes, there's like a whole criteria. Like how you walk your measurements. Yes. So there's also like personality tests and stuff. So it's just based on the opinion of the sort of judges. Yes, yes, yes. And there's like a whole process before the actual show. Where they got like a whole week where they were being judged. How about talent? Yes, also to talent. What did they do like a talent show? Some girls sing. Really? Yeah, some. But it doesn't happen in the pageant. Like that happens prior to the pageant. Like the actual show. I see. A trauma, a trauma grade, right? Yes. She can sing. Yes, yes. So she would have said that. I sing me. Probably. Plus, she's got like a degree of music. Yes, yes, probably. She's that way she won. No, I don't know. She was smart. I'm just trying to see. You know, how can we get involved? Anyway, let us know what you guys thought about it. And they're very pleasant on the eyes, I have to say. What is it slayed? What is wrong? If you like to check out any other performances, let us know. Bye, bye. Okay.
