 Music Ok 15th September we're here for day two of the delivery from CityHardware We're going to get some rain here so they got to get this unloaded and they've already unloaded some stuff the boys and looks like paints so that's plywoods that's ours I hope not I think it's in the side I don't know we'll see Here's the Jacuzzi massage bathtub it's called here Look at how they carry that because they will get stuck right here is a bad area they will get stuck this whole side here is soft because of all the rain so we've cautioned them not to get off into this they will get stuck so they're going to have to have it's a hefty thing so hopefully there's enough of them to move it maybe Jacuzzi is going to tell them what to put it let's walk over there and see as I step through all this ok we're here and it looks like this is where they're going to put the Jacuzzi tub we're going to have to inventory this later babe if you can hold this will I looks like they still got some things is this all they've unloaded so far is this paint? this bench should be inside Permanco what? maybe they can put this inside we'll see yeah we'll talk to Jacuzzi and the boys today is also a payday for these gym these are the looks like the 30 by 30 tiles we'll put them over here ok well so we didn't move the bags but we covered them up for the tarp so that's good we got the tin all from this to keep the rain hopefully that'll be quite sufficient we got the roof being here and we got the metal pieces and we got the tarp should be suffice as a typhoon comes through here step around and this is going to continue so I'm going to pause it here ok there's going to have to get flagged on the copy right pull my Jacuzzi still working on the ceiling part up there put a can of now and stay out of their way as much as possible again going to be some short half footage ok I'm here I'm stuck here working the window for him here sounds like clearly flirting in there and then be on the outside again there's noise hazard and the rain starts looks like they're made looks like they're made so you'll be able to set the top can't get anchors as bottom downstairs with the window and the CR downstairs in the bathroom notice my video is it was off-centered because they put it up before they put the wall up so I'm going to dress the deformer recenter and so it looks centered like this window the one downstairs before they plaster I'm going to remind them again as well as brother Jay let me see if I can catch what I can find in the rain yeah ok the plaster inside of the CR well recording now so that's what they're doing there and passing out the cement and they're exactly getting ready to do it here too this is going to be the mission for today the CR and inside stuff while it's raining and now it's going to continue to mix nice and smooth to the plaster and more gravel here I'm trying to get outside to give you guys an update pause the outside update on the column post here supporting post I went and talked a little bit and then I guess it wasn't recording so I've verified it now ok quick summary this column is going to be removed this column concrete column is going to be removed this one will stay canopy is going to go up across here for the drawings originally we're supposed to be a fiberglass canopy that may not be cost effective for us at this point maybe sometime in the future and I few up some additional funds somewhere but for now we're going to go it's not going to be a concrete slab as the prior management had decided without that's the reason the concrete columns went up again you know you don't build someone's home and just change things without talking to them but pass this pass anyway we're going to put up once these two come down we're going to put up it's going to be almost like a two before is kind of a support pole the material we're going to be determined at this point later date same with the roofing the actual canopy it's going to be made up some type of wood though and then we're going to seal it so it's going to have like water sealant on it and that's going to work for us in the end of the room like I said until we free up some additional funds at a future time but now we're just going to focus on the main areas of the home and get that taken care of now I'm trying to cover the phone it's not waterproof I know I got to get some better tools but if you've been following us when the funds have become available just getting outside look to see if they did any outside plashing on the CR or not yet so not much of an update here everyone's working and I'm going to keep repeating myself I do not want to enter up their working just to get an update basically a visual this is not an instructional video on how to build a home it's just our family vlog and we're showing you what we're going through you can see he completed the mental platings up under here up into that point for now it's raining that's what the water took it inside and then we'll take it over here and you can see it up until that point there all right once the rain stops I'm sure they're going to come out and work on that so that's why he's working inside on the ceiling getting that framed up inside let me pause Rebar is beginning to put the cement up for the plashing so that's going to be their focus while it rains so I'm putting the brightness on the screen it's still a lot of hazards up here walking hazards so again it's going to complete the process stelso mix the relay that's all and then the actual plashing so no need to continue the video it's just going to be in the same process over and over until all the inside walls are in the plashing so at some point I need to bring in 12 cubic meters of sand probably just going to bring in a whole dump truck 20 cubic meters I think it's 4,800 pesos or 4,500 I forget which one of those two but we're going to bring that in before the heavy rain start I need to go ahead and get that done probably today because I want to hear it I don't want it to hold them up when they run out of sand I folks looks like this is it for today for that the actual house so maybe later hopefully we'll see I don't recall if I've shown this as whether I started breaking up the cement piece right here to make room, head room for me and again it's going to come out somewhere probably over here I would think so that when I step up from this step here all this will be gone so I'm going to have a head hazard okay quick look at our plant door we're going to get out before he starts to drill in too much and the music is kind of loud it's called a Kentucky door they're still doing the unload here's the remaining sand we have left so I want to get in another dump truck load over in the same area so like I said it doesn't slow them down too much but not having the materials here so it's some more 60 by 60 tiles and some 30 by 30 tiles the front door the Jacuzzi and the paint and we're going to inventory everything once we're done unload I'm not going to record that that's the tedious that's a long tedious process so all right on to the next doing too many things here I wanted to record them heft and that thing over here they had to get some help from some of the guys in the house the bar, call your ferdinand Nelson Jays on the other side and two of the delivery guys the other guys over there I don't know why let me step over here and get out of the way that manpower he's trying to stay out of the way he's pretty heavy and he got it created good take a seat hopefully I can still get in there and do my towel inventory I'm not finished with that yet so that was doing when they said they were carrying there's Jacuzzi oh leave it alone you can take a shower now back I'm going to open it up now open it up now and take a look see I'm J get up in there and take a look see all right well it's delivered nothing need to show it opening it up and everything the time of the viewing once it's installed so let me just stop here for this test okay how could I forget the rain is thrown here's the toilet roll here it's here it made it here also we've checked everything it's there we've confirmed all the paints quantities exactly what we ordered we got two pieces of towels that were broken yesterday we turned there the Jacuzzi's intact all the towels floor tiles and wall tiles everything's here the doors inside the house the plywood is going I think they put it inside the house because it's getting ready to rain we didn't want it to get wet I think it's going to stay in the house somewhere and sorry about the noise turning the hand walk the way because they're just enclosing the barracks which is now in the storage shed to keep the rain out from all of our materials so hopefully we'll have good luck there with that I got that look from the forming like slow your roll a rock slow your roll easy does it on the materials here I thought we'd be able to put another room I think I mentioned that already but no because I'm moving around they're trying to plasher everything and everywhere wherever they can get to whatever they can get to it so we'll see okay more later it's just noisy
