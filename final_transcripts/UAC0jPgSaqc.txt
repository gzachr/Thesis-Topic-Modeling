 What is this? Call of duty? What is this? Valorant. Valorant. Valorant. Valorant. Valorant. Oh, nice man. Vida Vida. I go in the van. I'm going in the van. Got some dude's playing Valorant here. Thank you, bros. Good morning from Seaboo City. So, I have been here for a few nights. I haven't been able to record because I'll tell you why later in this video. But very excited to take you on sort of my first proper day exploring Seaboo. I have only been working, so I've not really had a chance to spend a lot of time exploring the city. So, very excited to take you on this journey with me. Right now, just kind of making my way here to get some coffee. So let's do that. I have a good spot up here. Now if you don't know, Seaboo City is part of the province of Seaboo. And according to my research, whoever wrote the Wikipedia article, Seaboo City is a first-class, highly urbanized city. And I can definitely feel that about Seaboo City. I will just tell you, I fried my GoPro in Boracay. And I was able to find five or six different authorized GoPro dealers. So it's definitely well equipped, urbanized city, but on an island. So that is something that I find very interesting about Seaboo City. Seaboo City has a population that is estimated to be around one million. And the province of Seaboo has a population of around five million. So there are a lot of people here. You can definitely feel this. And yeah, it's a really cool place to be just kind of in the area that I've been. There are, there's definitely a lack of sidewalk infrastructure here, but that's not taking away from the experience too much for me. But that's definitely just something that I noticed. There are also kind of these tools that you have to be careful of when you're walking here. Now what's really cool is in Seaboo, the province of Seaboo, there is a Seabanu language. And I will put that word on the screen, assuming I, in case I'm not saying it correctly. The Seabanu language is a language that is local to the province of Seaboo. And this is different from what I understand of Tagalog, which is the traditional Filipino language. And what's really cool is so you can speak Seabanu, right? Probably if you're native to Seaboo or if your family is from Seaboo. But people also refer to themselves as Seabanu. So I think that's very cool and a very interesting part of this region of the central Visayas. Hello. And you can see there's an interesting Jeep here going by. There are a number of public transportation options here, just like in Manila. But we're definitely going to try to get on some public transportation here in this video. But yeah. So here is Bo's Coffee. There are a number of, hello, good morning. There are a number of Bo's coffees here in the area. I do wonder if I'm allowed to film. Hello. Thank you. And okay. Music. So I will see you. All right guys. So we're going to be doing a lot of exploring today. So I decided to start off this video here with a breakfast at Bo's Coffee. Really cool, 20 spot here in Seaboo. But I got myself a Jamaican cheese and an iced Americano for 365 pesos. Which is, let's see here. Let's see how much 365 pesos is. Six dollars and 60 cents. Take a look at this bus here. Isn't this interesting? Would like to ride one of these. The bus codes are hard for me to understand. So I don't want to get on one and then go to a place that I have no idea where I am. But there are, you can see, I don't know if you can see, but on the top of the bus there's zero six B. So what you have to do from what I understand here in Seaboo is you have to learn what the bus code is. And then each bus code has a specific route on where it takes you. Now Seaboo City is broken up into multiple sort of hubs or if you want to call them neighborhoods like many cities. I've been staying in the capital site and I haven't gone outside of this area. I've been working. But I'm going to take us to Cologne Street or the Cologne area, which is pretty happening here. And we're going to take a bus. We're going to try to take a bus here. First time doing public transportation in the Philippines, actually. But there's also IT Park. There is Ayala and there's also SNCD just in kind of Seaboo City proper. There are also other parts of like right around Seaboo City that kind of cater more towards like a resort style kind of experience for travel or for living. There are a number of like waterfront casinos and waterfront stays, beach stays. Of course there is the famous whale. You can swim with a shark. You can swim with sardines as well. It's called something but you can basically swim into a huge ball of sardines which is really interesting. And here's one of these famous jeeps here. So here we're just walking upon Puente as Mena Circle, as Mena. Hopefully probably not pronouncing that correctly. But this is kind of right at the center of capital site, which is where I've been staying. I'm not sure if I said this already but very affordable combination. I'm spending $21 a night at this hotel. I think I might try to show some footage of it. I may or may not here. But here is Puente as Mena Circle. You've got tons of Jollybees, Chow King, KFC, other restaurants around there. And there are like three malls right around the edge of this circle here. You know it's interesting. The cars here are like jeepneys for example. Jeepneys and other kind of public transportation vehicles are kind of a relic of the American military, which is so interesting. America and the Philippines are allies. Let me see if this is the right bus here. Ooh, and I gotta be careful on where I'm walking. I do not have the right way in the Philippines, just like in Thailand, hello. And so this is not my bus I'm looking for, I don't believe, but it's called My Bus. And just another way to get around here. And I saw a sign on the bus that said free ride. So you can't beat that. But I will be taking another form of transportation. Now let me get across here. And another shot here, there is like a nice place to kind of sit, have a lunch. You can see just this little bit of traffic, it's unbeatable. Yeah, but there's Robinson's one of the malls, Robinson, Puente. And there's also Robinson Cyber City or Cyber something. That's a rain stream all right around the corner. So you've got desserts here, street dessert. So it's pretty good. All right. Hello. Sorry. Hello. Oh, what's going on? Oh, see if it's right. Sorry. Hello. Hello. What's going on? Just going to Colombian street? Yeah. All right, cool. Cool. On the right one. So how do I pay? Do I get off? Okay. Thank you. I'll go to my room. Okay. You can go to my room. Okay. You can go. Okay. You can go. Yeah. Okay. You can go. That's a nice place. Okay. I'll be back. Thank you. Thank you. Is this cool, huh? Yeah, it is. Oh, really? So that was a really cool experience. Almost didn't make it off the bus. What we got off the bus. Yeah. I'm going to get off the bus. Thank you. Is this cool, huh? Yeah, it is. Oh, really? So that was a really cool experience. Almost didn't make it off the bus. What we got off. And I think it cost 11 pesos. And now we're here somewhere right near Colon Street. So yeah, you can definitely use Google Maps. You can just use Google Maps to use a public transportation. All right. So this is the famous Colon Street. And let me tell you, way different than the capital site where I pay for the city. Capital site where I've been staying in Cebu City. So much going on. You can definitely see the modern industrialized way that is Cebu City here. Hanzo stuff. So many people in your face. As soon as you get off the jeepney. Wow. Actually, is that called a jeepney? Let me know. Let me know in the comments. I think I'll tell you something else. But fortunately, there's a lot of music you're playing. I can only show so much right now. But I think we have a good stretch here of music free. And tons of cell phone shops here. It seems. But I'm excited to continue exploring Cebu City with you in this video. There's also like a few markets around here. I think there's a Cologne market. There's also Tauban or Tauban market. So I think I'm going to pop in here to 7-Eleven. See if I can film it. If I can, I will take you with me. I'll be able to get a drink here. That's a big one. All right. Got myself a water here. And we're trying to get across. Look. Hulk. That's sick. We just ran. Almost. Not quite. Almost. This chaotic vanilla. The Benondo region. Wow. This is a film piece. Time and time again. It's been amazing. But also, like, just in eye-opening experience where there's just so much going on. It's like a big dopamine rush. Anytime that you explore these kind of busier areas of vanilla or sorry of the Philippines rather, we're in Cebu. Dim Sum Break. Tap that on Dim Sum after Benondo. But that won't last too long. It's interesting. These Jeepneys or buses or whatever they're called. They're not like Jeepneys. They're kind of different. But they have like a really interesting art on them. Like the Hulk, Spider-Man. I've seen some really cool ones. Really amazing experience. I'm glad that I popped on one of those. By the way, if I did not already say it, you can just use Google Maps. Google Maps has the Jeepney codes that will tell you where you need to go or the bus codes. Whatever they're called. Take a look at this. We've got cookies, all sorts of things here. Hello. What is this? Is this sweet? Okay. I'll have one of those. One. Can I also give you this to throw out for me? Thank you. I think just one of those is one to me. What is it? Banana. Alright, let's give it a shot. Is it good? Thank you. Okay. Alright, thank you. How much? Love it. All right. You can keep. Do you have one vessel? You can keep. You can keep. It's fine. You can have. Yeah, thank you. Can you give this one? No, it's okay. Thank you. Thank you. Alright, what is this called? What is this called again? Minan-caw. We call it Minan-caw. Banana-caw. Alright. Is it sweet? Sweet. Alright. Let me give it a shot. Good. It's like a cookie. Is it a say-bano? Is it like local to, is it like Filipino or is it... Hmm. Hmm. Can you give this one a shot? I can't. Is it a say-bano? Is it like local to, is it like Filipino or is it... Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Thank you. Thank you. Nice. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. The match is being nice. I actually really taste good. It's Bianca. I'll go ahead again. Hmm. Hmm. Here's also the cookie. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Oh, that cookie is even better than the Bianca. Oh my God. Wow. Again, not just being nice here. It's cookie. Really freaking good. So, I'll just add a little bit of a market here. This is really cool. So, I like kind of just going for a wonder. I love it. It's called Daadco. I don't know if that means orange in Tagalog or a savane. But, I don't know my hands. I would have had one. Like more open market here stuff. These are shops, but. Tulo. Tulo. Hello. So, what is the difference between a Daadco and a Tulo? I don't know. Also, I should know if it is a Sunday. I believe this is the start of Holy Mac here in Philippines. So, here's the Inus Hall, which is another Filipino sort of fast food joint. And, apparently, they have some really amazing Halo Halo. Of course, statues of saints, available as purchase. There's some really, really dope shirts. Let's take a look here, actually. So, you've got Kobe Bryant. You have Demon Slayer. I used to know that anime now, I forget. Oh, Juju Kaisen. Tupac. Oh, man. Oh, man. Every part of me wants to get one of those, but. I don't have room in my luggage. So, I've actually decided we're going to go check out Magellan Cross. I believe I'm saying that correctly before we go to the market. And there are a number of shops here selling items that have a, that are of a religious nature. And here is Magellan Cross. Magellan, maybe. Magellan. Magellan. I do not know what the significance of this is. It's a notable monument on Google Maps. So, I have not done my research here. But, see what it's about. Kuyak Taninio. I mean, I know what I'm saying that correctly. I have no idea what that means. Okay. I'm going to map the photo here. What? I'm going to see the photo. Can I go in? Thank you. I think that would be true. Magellan Cross. This cross of $10 would, in case the original cross, planted by Fernando Magellan on this very site. In 1521, on April 21st. So, it's an amazing, amazing time to be here. I didn't want to interrupt the photo. But, lots of people taking photos here. And, take there's candles all around. This feels very nice. So, cool. And I just looked, and it looks like there's another Jose Rizal monument. Oh, no, this is Vicente Rana. But, there is another Jose Rizal monument, somewhere around here, which you didn't see my first impressions of Manila video. I visited the Jose Rizal monument in Manila. And it looks like there's another one here in Cebu. So, he seems to be a very important Filipino figure. It's a very important thing to this country. So, let's take a look at the monument here. I don't know if we can get in. No, I don't think we're going to be overgidden. But, oh wait, is this him? No, this is not him. Let's see if we can find it. Oh, no. Oh, yes, that is the Jose Rizal monument, I believe. I believe that is it. Is it, what is this? What is this? Holy cross Pedro Kalungso. What do you do with it? What is it used to? Every year, we celebrate our ala spas in Pesaya, in English. We'll be in the Olden. Holy cross. Okay. How much? How much? 35, I don't know. Okay, I'll buy one. 25. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I like them. I like them. And it's cool. Ah, thank you. All right. Souvenirs, or do I take this somewhere or Souvenirs? Souvenirs, yeah. Souvenirs, thank you. I know what's hard. All right. So, we got one of these. They're generally the same in Tunis. And maybe I'll give this away or something. But, yeah. Don't mind supporting. Do you want? Here. Would you like this for free? Okay. Yeah. Thank you. All right. Maybe they can hold on to that. And do something with it. I will not be able to. All right. So, we're basically right at the entrance. So, we're very close to the market here. Hello. What's up, bro? What's up, bro? What's up, bro? Make sure to make sure. All right, man. Hey. Hey. See you. This market is more about like produce, fruits, stuff like that. Fortunately, I do not believe the night market is open. But, let's see what this is about. Pineapple. Pineapple. Pineapple. Pineapple. Oh! How much for pineapple? All right. How much? 30. 30. Okay. Do you, you don't wash it with water, right? Do you, is it just, just open? Do you don't wash it, right? Do you, do you wash it with water? No. No water? Okay. Yeah, I'll buy one. Oh, which one go? Oh, this is your first time. Brother, you can keep. You can keep. It's fine. It's fine. You can keep. Yeah. Hello. Hello. Vlog. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Best pineapple? Good pineapple? All right. Let's try this pineapple out, folks. Mmm. Yum. Mastara. Mastara. Mmm. It's actually really good. You can see. Mmm. You can have. All right. That pineapple is really good. Hello. The person really wanted to give me change. This was nice. I'm very happy. I'm also happy. Oh. The person really wanted to give me change. This was nice. I was just gonna give him 50. But nice of him to give me the change. All right, so we've got Tom's fruits. Hello. Avocado's I believe. Codos. Tom. Oh, and here we go. So I think this is the actual market in here. So let's go in here. See what this is all about. Is that a jackfruit or durian? Okay. So I believe this is a place where you can get dry goods as well as fruits. So. Hello. You can even get burgers here. So if I was local to see you do, I would absolutely be getting my fruit here. That pineapple is really juicy. And I think there's like candy since then. Hello. Hello. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know what it is. Candy, stragguts. Sweet grapes. Soft jelly candy. Ooh, looks good. I love gummies. I think I'll refrain. Do I refrain? All right, and we're right back where we started here. Let's go back around. Okay, there's a lot more to this market actually. So that was just the inside part. Those of you who don't know, you have to be very careful about pre-cut fruit in any country that does not have potable water, which interestingly enough, there are only 12 countries in the world where you can drink the tap water. So that is just something to consider when traveling, not just in Southeast Asia, but in any country, that does not have drinkable tap water. Oh, okay, it's big market. I've only just scratched the surface here. The carbon market. And you can see carbon bags of con. I don't know what that means, super city. And this looks like a really interesting building. So you can get a better shot here. Carbon market, see Boocity, interim building. So you could really just get lost in here. It is sort of like a much smaller divasorea market. It's like we've got some ice cream. It's quite hot today. So, maybe some ice cream I do. See the flavors here? Durian, Butterstouch, Ube, hello. Mango, cookie monster, cookies. Hello. May I have a Milky Bar? I have no Milky Bar. No Milky Bar. Yeah, I've been to Australia. I've been to Australia. 39. 39. Yeah, 39. Okay. Let's see here. One scoop, 39. Also, two scoop, 39. All right. But, no, I need flavor. What flavor are you? All right, one flavor. My flavor only. I will do cookie monster. Cookie monster. Good flavor? Yeah. Okay, that's good. I'm probably not going to eat it all. That's okay. That's good. Yeah, yeah, good. Thank you. So, cookie monster ice cream here. All right, cookie monster ice cream. Really hard to blog this. I'm going to eat it all. I'm going to eat it all. That's okay. Yeah, yeah, good. Thank you. So, cookie monster ice cream here. Cookie monster ice cream. Really hard to blog this. Mmm. I don't know what flavor cookie monster is. But, wow, it's a good... Yum. I like it. All right. So, here is... another shot. So, it just goes on. There's a lot more to see. What's like? So much here, hello. Wow. Who? Who? Who? Who? Shops. What's up, man? Wow. It's like a little market. Places get food down there. And I think... There's more here. Okay. I think we're going to go back out to the main road here. Let's see what's down here. Viva Pit Senior. Hello. It's like another spot to get like food. It's like that. Wow. I love seeing the local culture. It's probably the best part of traveling. It's stuff like this. I do think that's the water down there. I'm going no maps right now. I'm just wondering. Which is the way. What are we with this is? What is this? What's up bro? What is this? What is this? Call of duty? What is this? Valorant. Valorant. Valorant. Valorant. Oh nice man. I got some dude's playing Valorant here. Here. Do you have to pay pesos to play? Yeah. It's like a good time. There's like a block down there. Oh this person is playing League of Legends. Three players. This guy's watching YouTube. Count. There I am. Do you subscribe? Thank you brother. Yeah. It's okay brother. It's okay. So do you pay pesos? And then you pay five pesos and then you get... And then you get 30 minutes. Okay. That's me. Yes. I'm starting the Philippines. Thank you brother. Thank you. All right enjoy. Sorry man. Have a good day. Thank you. All right. So five pesos gets you 30 minutes of play time. Hello. Hi. What's up guys playing pool here? No. It's like a really fun spot to hang out on a Sunday. What's up guys? How's it going? What's up? Thank you brother. Oh man. Now a little kids have welcomed the Philippines. So nice. Hi. Hello. What's up bro? Yes vlog. Yeah YouTube. YouTube yes. Zane travel. Zane travel. Salamad. Thank you brother. I believe we're back kind of towards Kalon Street. I think I turned around but it's okay because I found myself right. What do you mean? All right. This is what I was looking for here. So what? I believe this whole area is called Plaza in the Pensia. Again the Spanish influence here all over the Philippines of Zipa City. And along with that I just realized that there's something I forgot to say in the intro which is Seaboo City is known as the Queen City of the South. But you can see right here. It is the one of the larger cities in the Philippines. It's not the second biggest but outside of Manila it is a one of the larger cities. This whole area is the Plaza in the Pensia. And I believe this is the largest city in the South. Maybe the Valle or the Valle city might be bigger which is also I believe considered South Philippines. But yeah definitely recommend coming to Seaboo if you do a Philippines trip. Having a good time here especially in this part. It's so interesting because as I stated before it is a highly urbanized city of over a million people. But it's an island. So it's an island city which is so cool. Yeah so this is Fort San Pedro in Seaboo City here. 30 pesos to get in Fort San Pedro. One of these things where I don't really want to do this again so worth the entrance fee to me. I just got a drink in there. I like it's riding that jeep so much. That thing. I'll find another one. Thank you bro. Alright here we are. Alright just got off of that. And yeah, love being a jeep. Definitely will be taking advantage of these more during my time here in Seaboo. Never experience anything like that. It's a uniquely Filipino experience.
