I'm somewhere in this area. All right. Are you close? I don't like that stick. No, it's not up like that. They're on here? Yes, they're on here. I hear. Yeah, it's this way. They know. Okay, I'm just going to take a shot of the dark. Okay. Gosh. I actually show me where his Philippines is. You guys can help each other. Okay. I feel like sometimes I get Philippines and the in Indonesia, like mixed up. I don't know if they're one or the same. But I'm thinking it's like in this area here. Good guess. Oh. Okay. At least try. Okay. Show me where his Philippines is. Wow, I'm going to... He's good. He knows a lot of things. Yeah. Okay. Let's get this guy's skin. Philippines. Yeah. But it's funny how he's the one that the kind of the group leaders so everybody's just kind of backing him up and he's like every time he says something and everybody's like, yeah, yeah, yeah. He's the extrovert of the group. We're sure. Oh, shit. It's one of these. I think it's here right there. How about you? Ah, no, I thought it was. At everything here. That's right. Oh, you could have. Yeah, I'm going to have a ride. Yeah. It's okay. It's beautiful. That's Spanish for dumb. Yeah, 2001 islands. Okay. Okay. It's on this side. Yes, it's on this side. It's on the right. It's on the north or the north. It's on the right. I just know it's a natural area. A thousand hours. A thousand hours. A thousand hours. Here? Here almost there. But it's up here. A little up there. So that's the Philippines. Is it getting close? Right here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. She got it. So we're here in this region. Yeah. It's okay. I'm going. This is okay. Oh, it's like this Africa. There's like popping again. It's a rock. We're going here somewhere. Right? By Asia? Yes. Is it good? Yes. You're right. You're right. Yes, Trania. Uh oh. Okay, you're going to show me where Mo just like is. Okay. You're actually close. Thought so far? I expected them to know more. Yeah. I'm surprised. They didn't know as many facts. Yeah. I'm sure we'd ask like our friends in America. They might know. I think if we'd ask our friend Kevin, he would tell you. He would tell you not only where the Philippines is. He'd tell you where it's a blue air. He'd tell you where Manila's. He'd tell you. He knows the foods. He'd tell you when in the end. Dependent stay is he tell you the whole story of the Philippines during the Second World War. What was he doing? The 19, something. 1945. Yeah, he was doing a Porsche, not push-ups. Set ups and like referring to historical events in the Philippines that back then we even didn't know. So he is really into history. And even though he never visited the Philippines, he knew like, even dishes that we never heard of. He knew like the gold-piled soup and so on. He knew all these things. So yeah. Wish he could visit us someday. Okay, what's that? Yeah. So that's a Philippines. Yeah, it's got to be a Philippines. I knew it was in that area. Okay, how about this? These are different flags. So you have to choose at least guess which one is the Philippines flag. Ooh, the Philippine flag. Oh, interesting. Yeah, no, a good guess. In fact. Not that one. You guys got the look at that. You're trying to fool me with those. My friends in the Philippines were like, that was years ago if you talked about that stuff. Oh really? But do you know which flags these are? I think the upper left is Malaysia. I think that's Thailand. That's Thailand? That could be Malaysia. It also could be Burma. No, Burma is red and green I think. Don't know what that, no, that's not Vietnam. I don't know. That's the Philippines. Choose one of those. Oh, which one's the flag? Okay, I was going to say two. Um, is it two? She's saying I'm a real. You guys have to have a consensus. Okay, we have to. What's the consensus? I think I got two. Okay, I'm going to have to go against the green because I'm going to go with you guys. Okay, okay. So I want to say that it is one. One. I saw my screen. Almost correct. Number two. Wow, I like to know that. Shot the dark. Oh, I'm going to yell at you. Oh, that's so funny. It's so funny. Yeah, so. See, you didn't even know. But you didn't get your life. I think it was a good chance. You're with their pointing at Hawaii. Yeah. We like these guys competing with each other. One or three. One or three. Ah, ah, ah, ah, it was a four. It's two. Two. It's all brought all three terms. I feel like. Which one? I want to go with the sun, shiny one. Wow. Three. Three. Yes. Yes. Yes, just a guess. Is that right? Yes. Oh, three. Which one? You got it wrong, dear. This is the correct one. Done. I knew it was from the trick, though. I wanted the sun, but I, it's toast. I know I can get it right. I'm going towards two, but is it no? Okay, you need the words to, how about you? I'm going towards one person. One? Okay, but you have to choose one. You're correct. Number two. Good job, man. Did you know that? It was an interview. As a guess. So you're going to do it. I'm in it. Pick one where is the Philippine flag? This is a random guess. I want to say two. Yes. Number two? Number two. You got it right. Yes. Guesses. This is somewhat educated guess what I still... That's why I have even here. Like, so this is one of the famous beaches in the Philippines. I wish. Okay. Good guesses on the flags, but I have no idea yet what the other flags are. So if you guys know, let us know in the comments down below. I have no idea what four is. So if anybody knows, let us know. Four is a number. It's a four. It's the fourth number. If you count this one, then you have two. You also have three, but then you have four. Technically correct, man. Yeah, so correct. Uh, is it so quick? It's very beautiful. How about this one? Have you been to the Philippines? I wouldn't have come back. I used that to say, yeah, wouldn't you wouldn't know me? Yeah, I know you've been here. Have you been to the Philippines? I've never been to the Philippines. Oh, it's probably a nice famous beach I would imagine. Everybody looks very happy or I would be. So famous beach, beach, beach in the Philippines. I can't believe it's a Philippines. Oh, no, but that looks nice. Beautiful. Oh, there's some Philippines that happen to be in the Philippines. You have to visit this place. Okay, then you come to the Philippines to have the visit this one. So this is the picture of one of the beautiful beaches that we have in the Philippines. Okay. Have you heard of this place? So this is Burakai. Okay. Looks beautiful. Look at the red map here. It's difficult for you guys to guess. So that's Burakai. If ever you go to the Philippines, you have to visit this place. I'll have to describe how amazing that picture is. Okay. Okay. But I have to say this picture doesn't do justice. Because usually when you come to Burakai, it's it's white sand beach and the water is crystal clear and toy coiz. But so nice that it looks blowering. It looks so nice that you feel like it's photoshopped. So good. Really good. So good. So amazing. I can not remember that. So this is Burakai. Oh wow, that's cool. So this is Burakai. Burakai. Have you heard of Burakai? So this is Burakai. If you visit the Philippines, you have to come here. This one is beautiful beaches that we have. And when I win this contest, you're sending me here. If you have money, you're sending me. I'll send you. From here, you guys, it's channel, right? Generates money. It's Burakai. You have to go here. I would love to. Okay, so come to the Philippines. Have you been to the Philippines? No. Oh, you have to come to the Philippines and visit Burakai. It's super nice. I heard it's inexpensive to travel there. So this is Burakai. Have you heard of Burakai? Yeah, I've heard of it. That friend that went there. He has a nice air. Man, that is beautiful. Yes, it is. It's super. Yeah, hey, you have been to Dobo and all that stuff.

Nice. Okay, I really, really enjoyed this video. Yeah. It seems to be a part two, so... Yeah. Keep an eye open for that one. Yes. I really like the people that she interviewed.
