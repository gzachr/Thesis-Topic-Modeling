Today, I'm reacting to this video. Wanna go on zales? Arima songs, part 2. While long time no see, Mona, actually I've already reacted to her anima song mentally before. This time, part 2. Well, I think I'm in different generation from her, so yeah, it's interesting to see what kind of anima song she's selecting. So yeah, let's see. Oh, one piece. Namiya, right? I like myself. Backing with the car is how to say it, right? Wow, you're Japanese. I'm very the soft voice. Wow, you're Japanese. Oh, very good. Oh, very good. This song. I don't know this song. So good that really, right? So good that really, right? Oh, Hello, good to be Brad-to. What's this anime? I wonder where she's going with the car. I Something beeping. Is this all right? Oh, good. Oh, good falsetto. I can hear some crack-sh-ing. Wow. Oh, wow. That's great song. Song from Brad-wimps. She looks so serious. Oh, I like how the voice is. Beautiful. Oh Oh, perfect.

Oh Fantastic. Good Japanese. Oh, I love it. Actually, actually, her voice is really similar to the original singer. Well, I love it. And her voice with a bit of husky, really matches with this song. Wow. Fantastic. And now, who am I seeing? Is he that? I want to change the world. Join it. Oh, my name is my child. I'm so, so, so, so. You know, we have that. I think I was in English. I think I was in English. Oh, so, yeah. Oh, Some from places, right? Yeah, very good. I Uh, I heard it somewhere. It's a new one, right? Different generation from me.

Wow, it's once from Sunday. Oh, Wow, I love that. I don't know. Say it again. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. That's good.

That's good. That's good. Yaby, You have something to ask you to tell me through. Hey, This is a informaci√≥n for us to see from afar. Sorry Kaiko, My Honors Samurai City Well, that was fantastic. What I was surprised is a special lady. She's single without any music. That's really difficult to, you know, adjust the tone, right? Her, you know, sense of tone is really accurate, you know. Her sense is really sophisticated. That's why he has really good technique and rounds, vibrato, really high technique. I can see them from this song and also one question. So are these anime songs really famous in Philippines? Most of them didn't really hit me. Yeah, I have really no idea about most of songs. I don't think these are really famous in Japan. Like, yeah, one piece, Naruto, like a slum down to their famous but other songs don't really famous. So yeah. So if these are really famous in Philippines, this is really interesting. Okay, that's it for today. I think if you watch my video, I hope you like it. If you do, make sure to like, button and subscribe please. So, mata ozu.
