Hallo, hallo, and maizcognelo. And those two are my favorite or go-to desserts, especially during summer. So I think it would just be perfect for them to try it. So let's go ahead and see their reaction. So we're back with the K-pop idols ghostline. Please introduce yourself one more time. Hello, we are ghostline. Akozi, 준성. Akozi, 준형. Akozi, Prince. And this time, we're going to have some time for dessert. Oh, dessert. It's dessert. I love it. Summer time now, right? And you know, the Philippines is also very, very hot. Yeah. It's a tropical country. So we have a lot of pingsu in there. Today, we're going to make two different kinds of pingsu together. We're going to make it? Yeah, we're going to make it. Oh. Do you like pingsu? Oh, we love it. Of course. So we're going to make our hallo, hallo now. Hallo, hallo means mix, mix. Hallo, hallo, hallo. I'll give you guys the chance to make your own hallo, hallo. So first, I think you can start with ice. When you put your ice, you add this evaporated milk. Or evaporata in Filipino. evaporata. Yeah, you can put like, pak pak. Pak pak. And then you, now we add the toppings. Yeah. So this one you got red bean, deli. Yellow thing here over here is jackfruit. Jackfruit. Do you guys try jackfruit? No. Jackfruit, what's it? It's a, and Korean. Jackfruit. Jackfruit. It's Julian's friend. Ah. You also got this one. This is makdafuno. Or ino the white part of coconut. Have you guys tried fresh coconut? Yeah, yeah. Have you guys tried the white ones on the side? Yeah, yeah. So a lot of Koreans, they never tried the white ones. They don't know what to eat. This part is really luxurious. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, you know. Yeah. So you guys can just scoop everything out and put as much as you guys. I like the hot beans. Right, right. It's like popping juice. It's like a hot, really hot. So you can start by putting the oil inside. So this is a purple lamb. This is a jujube. Ah, a bhalwhal. Ah. More than pot. Yeah, more than pot. This is what makes the flavor. Ah. So you guys can put it. Doesn't this smell like a sweet potato? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like a potato. Yeah, yeah. It's like a potato. Yeah, yeah. It's like a potato. Yeah, yeah. I think it's blue cheese and gochujang. Yeah. So you have a bhalwhal, you mix it. We will top it off with ice cream. Oh. Wow. I can't stop. Ice cream. I can ensure that it will be really delicious. Okay, so you can add more condensada, condens milk, 연유. And then just give it a try. It's gaita. It's gaita. It's gaita. It's gaita. It's gaita. Mm. From Washington, did. How is it? It's super delicious. Is it different from puffing soup? No, I think it's really similar. It has more liquid than puffing soup. Yeah, how's the puffing soup? I like the jelly. You like the jelly? Yeah. How's jackfruit? It tastes like calm. It's really sweet. I thought it wouldn't be sweet, so I put it in a lot of condens. but now it's really sweet. Okay, so now it's what's gonna make it sweeter actually is this. It's family to do. It looks like a poigah. Ah! It looks like a poigah, right? Isn't it? This one is like a fancy dessert that we have during special occasions. Let's get the whole thing. It's gonna be really sweet. Mmm! Mmm! It's a pure. Oh, it's a melt senior. It has a rich flavor. It's really cool. Does it go well with the pingsu? Yeah. It's like completes the concept. Okay, amazing. And actually there are more toppings that goes in Steine Haruhalo, but we weren't able to get everything here in Korea. That really means you guys have to go to the Philippines and try the authentic Haruhalo. Sure. Okay, now it's time for our second pingsu. Yep. And it's called maizko niello. Maizko niello. So maiz means corn and then yellow means ice. Oh! So, ox's a pingsu. Oh! 약간 한국인점이 믹서 같은 그런 느낌? Same process started out with ice. And this time you can fill it up. Fill it up. So, this is a very famous street food. And then with our evaporata, you can fill it up again. But this time just put a little so it doesn't melt too much. And then now this is the main flavoring agent. Oh! So you can put some. Oh, the color is pretty. Yellow. And then last but not least, you top it off with the green. The actual corn. And all they're putting it, you can add already the syrup. You know, you eat a lot in a long distance. Yes. I think you can eat a lot. If you eat a lot, you'll get a lot of trouble. Yeah, you can eat a lot in a long distance. Okay, and you guys can give it a try. Bon appétit. Yep. Bon appétit. Bon appétit. Bon appétit. Bon appétit. Bon appétit. Bon appétit. Bon appétit. This is a little interesting. You first have to eat it. Yes. If you freeze corn, that's it. No, just like frozen corn. I mean, I'm so famous. So I thought I was going to eat it. I think I'm eating it in one place. I think I'm eating it in a similar place. But I don't remember. Carbohydrate? Yes. Carbohydrate. 차록수소 아이스크림을 더 고급스럽게 먹는 그런 느낌이라고 해야 되나? 입맛에는 맞으세요, 다들? Yes. Yes. So what do you guys like better than Haru Haru or MySumiel? I prefer this one. Oh, yeah? Yeah, Haru Haru. Haru Haru Haru, are you? 저가 스템으로 만들어든 것 같아요. Oh my god. 그게 달거든요. 그래서 이거예요. Yeah, me. I also personally prefer MySumiel better. 익숙하면서 익숙하지 않은 맛인데 계속, I think I'm addicted to it. 계속 먹게 돼요. 왜지? 빵이랑 추가하면 진짜 되게 기절해요. 네, 저는 여기서 시리어도 더 넣어서 먹어요. For some crunch. Yeah. Next time you have to really try the authentic one in the Philippines. Actually, in the streets, in the beach. I was the whole summer food experience. It was really good. Yeah. I feel like if I'm on a diet, I can eat this, but then just put less of the milk in. And I won't get that. Because it's just ice and corn. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It can be low in calories. I feel like I'm getting higher. I think I should go to the Philippines. With this experience, I have more interesting infillacies. Yep, definitely. I'm very happy that you guys have more interest to the Philippines after trying all this. So thank you so much for being here and trying all the Filipino food. If you guys have anything to say to your Filipino friends, now the time. Our Philippines ghosties, we really want to meet you guys as much as you do. So we're going to meet soon one day.
