 Vitya Friday. The freshest. This is one of the videos that you guys keep sending us. It's been so spammed. I am so glad that we're actually checking it out right now. We've checked it out before so how cool some of the crowds in the Philippines are. But I think these two artists, both one republic and Jacob Cully, have weaponized this. They really have taken it to the next list. And I will show you what. I love the bass, bass players like you. I got you. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Come on, having gold. No. I already know. Philippines. I think 45 countries in and I already know this is going to be a far far. The best. Of course. Yeah, bro. The bridge. I'll go to the next one. I'll go to the next one. 45 countries though. This is crazy. You basically just said the RIP, my sleep pattern. Let's just do this. Whatever, whatever, no, you pick. Keep that note please. Okay, here we go. Yeah, the problem is going to be remembering it. No, you'll see this. Wow, I forgot my music class again. We're back in the choir. We go. Oh, nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. That is freakin brilliant. Oh my God. No that broke. It broke. Yeah. Bro, It broke. Bro, Yeah, I've always said it. That I've already said it. If the<|pl|> Williams come to planet earth, the first thing you show them is them między되는 that singers. Your first thing you show me is in singing What so amazing about people when they get together in one space they forget about everything all their trouble all their issues and they would just sing I'm really weaponized Philippine was singing Park through I haven't seen this one. I'm Bali hasn't seen this one either But I have seen what Jacob can do he did it in man. What's it? Indonesia way did it he's done it enough and it's really Rome the Rome yes the Rome video, but here's the thing Jacob is quite interesting because he his audience is like It's a little bit more musically refined. Yeah people or musically inclined The truckers so the thing is like he will throw you one ninth. He won't work on third some fifths He will throw you one a seventh and then a ninth and then we'll make you sing all together and then he'll start playing and then It's like you he has a choir on the man He's His pitch is so freaking accurate He just opened the gates of heaven That's just ridiculous is not fair Oh Oh Oh He's such a weird person like he's too good to be a person Look at it. It's a mature. A weird hat. It's like trousers. I sure like makes him look like the Messiah. The guy is special man. There's no way in earth this guy's just a person. It I totally agree with the idea. He gets one. We got cheese. We all got f**ked. You know what I'm saying? Like, oh, if we ever any come here to earth, they're already here. I know there was playing with us. He's the one. Taking it home. Cream. Look at me. Good Wait, cheers. We're turning it off I can't feel this Frag time comes You're getting it How do they know this is a phantom? I love that he's also leading with his voice. Just randomly someone from the crowds begins to float. Literally, I've... Oh, Jay-Pock is to float on shine, exposed. Tonsari doesn't eat. This is how he eats. This is how he gets nutrients. He's taking your nutrients. Give him more, more. I was gonna say I love that he's leading with his voice. Yeah, he's got a fantastic... But he's also so subtle about like the module... Yeah, how he modules his voice is so soft that it actually blends into the crowd. He's still finding that leadership. Yeah, still finding that leadership. But without being overpowering, which is so brilliant, like again... He doesn't feel... No, you're doing it wrong. No, he's just... God, let me guide you. My young... Out of one. Yeah, student. Sinking you must. I don't even watch Star Wars. What the f***? What's the name of the... The green goblin? Yoda. Yoda, that's right. Yes, welcome. It makes me just died. Yes, welcome. It makes me just died. Oh, he... Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's just coming out. Yeah, yeah. And it's just coming out. I just got... This is some beer and otter joy. Oh... Oh... Oh, my God. Toot toot! Oh, wow. I genuinely feel like all my scenes have been cleansed. No, bro. I didn't mean to judge me. We... Here's the thing, though. We just think there's something so beautiful about making human sound. Find it... It's way out of the mundane everyday life into something that magical. Like, because there... This people aren't like, you know, they... They bought tickets to watch a show. They're not necessarily singers themselves. And then... In this magical moment, everybody is part of that choir. Everybody is part of that magic. That is so freaking great. Nice to be human. Good bye.
