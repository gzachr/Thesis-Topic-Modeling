 Hi guys! Actually I'm a youtuber and she's also a youtuber. We're working in the Philippines. I'm from Bang Bang. I'm Tina so I just started YouTube like one month ago and she started one year ago. She started it for me or sisters. I want to be famous. Please check our videos. So this is Filipino music video right? It's pretty. It's really cool. Let's see some mirrors on it. It's unique. It's pretty. The makeup is really unique. Yeah, her makeup is so good. I think this is a modern tempo of Balacan. Get hit man! Where is that? I want to go there. What color is that? What did you give me? I think it's a Philippines. I don't think it's a Philippines. I like the melodies. I like the rhythm of the song. It doesn't really sound like the typical opium that I'm used to. Do you know what she's saying? No. I don't understand. She's holding the mirror that's what she's talking about the mirror. I'm just wondering what this mirror is for. I think it's a long time ago. It's not like a modern style song. I think her voice sounds similar to one of the songs. Similar to one of K-pop singers, not K-pop idols. It sounds like a modern style song. It sounds like a modern style song. It sounds like a modern style song. It sounds like a modern style song. It seems like the songs are different. It seems like the songs are different. The Philippines is really emotional. It's like when I watch this video, I feel like I'm in a new world. I feel like I'm in a new world. The dark one is like her inner shadow. Even though I cannot understand what she's saying. I can feel it by emotional. I don't know what this is. I don't know what this is. I don't know what this is. She's talking about being okay with being single. I like her interest. I like her outfits. I like her outfits. The makeup really matches with the dress. The dress is like the makeup is also that. Exactly. For being alone, being single. It's like I don't need no man. Yes. Like me. Like me. Like me. I'm the first. Me first. Like me. Me first. She's putting herself first. Oh, what an empowering feeling. Number one. Love yourself. Oh, it's like a movie. Is it really? Looks like the movie teaser. Is it not or what? What? Rock? It's a band. I think it's a band. I think it's different from the one I thought. No, the figure is the boy. It's not a girl. I think she got trapped somewhere. It's pretty. Maybe it's all about one girl. I hope I can understand the girl look a way better than this. This is not rock. Or a mini-bid. It's not a pop song. It's a pop EDM. It's a pop song. It's a pop song. It's like this in this song. Maybe they have a wall between them. Oh, it's chill. It's like an EDM. It's like a house. Actually, I saw lots of bands through KTV while I'm singing. But it's my first time to see the real bands. I love the sound. I like it. I like his voice. I can't see it. It's so dark. It's like Chinese. It doesn't look like... I like the voice. It sounds like... English ball. It's good to listen. I like to read them, right? It's like a club. I think the music is very trendy. Even though his voice is soft. His... Attractive people. Kindina. Kindina. Oh, it's a rap. It's my first time to hear it. I like this scene. Nice. It's awesome. I can understand this. What does he say? I don't know. It seems like he's one of the participants and show me the money the program in Korea. Like the rapper's program. Bush doll. I never thought that Philippine rap will be like the lead. Yeah, but it's really good. The blue. The black. The black. The black. No, you're right. There's a wall between them. I don't know why she got trapped. It seems like they still love each other. Or they want to be together. Maybe they're not meant to be. But there are situations that block the relationship. Oh, that's why there's a wall. Yes. I mean this was like The wall. I mean this was like It was like The wall was trying to Saver. And In somewhere like very dark . The wall represents the situation That they can't be together. Each part of the music there is a different vibe. I can feel the different feelings. I hope I can listen this song And I hope I can listen this song Oh, they met. Yeah, finally they met each other. I think he's saved her. They're meant to be. Oh, finally. Oh, it's like Seoul. Where is this place? Or Tenga? Which one is this? Filipino city life. Is it Seoul? No, it's not. It really looks like the streets. The one. Oh, the one. The one? Oh, this one. The one. The one. I forgot the meaning of the one. I've heard this song before. Alright, the man is rich. She's so pretty. The man got a lovely girlfriend. It's like a love story. Oh, the voice. It's like the voice of the voice. I think I've seen the place before. Really? I think I've driven around the place before. I'm not sure. Oh, I know this song. I know this song. I know this song. I know this song. The music is so old, right? Kind of old-fashioned. I've heard of it several times. Ah, the woman is pretty. The song is good, too. It's so cute. Oops, oops. Overact. Oops. Why are you fighting? Why are you guys fighting? You can't make that. You have a different eye. Look at your eyes. You can just tell their gently be careful. Watch out. Maybe they have misunderstood between them. Can't you see someone? Or suddenly because of that chord? What's your saying? Maybe he's worried about you. I told you from the first scene. They are hurting each other. It's a big fight. When fighting, I love you. Love you. Turning away. What the... What is that? Why are they dying? Bro, wait. Where are you tighter? Oh, chiptack. Chiptack. Oh, shit. Kind of. Parktae. Napchi. The way of loving her is really... Scary. It's weird. Cycle? He loves her, but the way of loving... It's toxic. I think I can fully understand if I really understand the lyrics. It's talking about a toxic relationship. There's that happy moments. I'm curious and curious. Then the only way to keep her safe is to trap her. Is she enjoying being tied? Or... But... I think he's not letting her go. It seems like you're mine. You can't go anywhere. I really can't understand the story. Why is this screaming? Maybe the story is about mental illness. Those picture perfect moments. Yes. But now, inside... Maybe... One of them has problems. Mental problems. Or... Maybe I think so. I think we're going to be in a hurry. Oh, the video is playing back. They're happy. They were happy. Why? I can't understand this. Maybe they're thinking about the happiness. Everything was an image. What happened? They were relaxed. To the beginning. Oh... What? Wow, it's a goosebumps. I think it's a goosebumps. I think it's crazy. Yeah, it's crazy. I think it's a goosebumps. He's the one who can tie that. Now I can understand. He's in a trap. I like the last part. It's scary at the end. I think the girl is like... Ghost? What? What? Wow! So the three videos that you guys have just watched are all recent songs from Young Concente. John Roa, also known as Jane Roa, and Juan Carlos LeBao. Young Concente knows mostly known for her quirky self-written love songs. However, through Acomuna, she is able to showcase a home inside of the spectrum of love, that being of self-love. According to an interview by Mix Philippines, Young herself states that it's about self-love and that it's okay to be single and to love yourself. John Roa, or more popularly known as Jane Roa, rose to fame during the fourth season of Filipinas Got Talent. After such, he also became a member of Chart Topping Hip-Hop Collective X Battalion. He even took part of their hit single entitled Hayan Masila, before leaving the group last 2017 to pursue a solo career. His latest single entitled Bagita explores the concept of breaking the boundaries of a seemingly impossible relationship through love. That's just the music video for Juan Carlos' Chart Topping single entitled Boan. Although the official meaning of the music video hasn't been released yet, many of the netizens have speculated various theories. One of these theories equates the word Boan with lunacy or the state of being a lunatic. The lunacy caused by shock due to trauma by the possible death of his girlfriend. Now that you've been introduced to these artists and their music videos, what are your thoughts on the videos that you've just watched? Um, my favorite is the third one. I actually have similar experiences about it. I mean, like, I didn't act or I didn't do anything. Like the guy in this music video though, after I know the real meaning of the music video, I can feel him actually. How much he yearned longing somebody he really loved before. Second video, I just noticed a wall between the girl and guy. I just thought that the girl just got trapped somewhere in the dark area. In terms of the song, actually I like the song the most. It's very trendy. It's very pop-ish. First one, Diva, I was like, kept wondering why is the mirror there. If I understand the lyrics in Filipino language, of course I can understand what the music video means with. At the very first time, when the mirror shows up in the music video, I felt like the mirror was just an ornament of the music video. But after I know about the real meaning of the music video, then yeah, love yourself first. These three music videos are very trendy, very modern. Compared to the opium music that I used to listen to. The first impression of opium music before to me was like, very old country like folk song. But now, yeah, it's been so trendy. I like it the melody. I like how the musical codes are playing as the music plays by. I like the scene while the singer holding a meter. It shows different versions of her. In Korea, there are so many dancers at the back. Because she just sung herself, but I'm really concentrating on that video. It gives so many meanings. And her voice was so soft. It was really good. It was a club song, but it was a love song. While I watched the scene, at the first time I was confused. What is this all about? After a few seconds, I couldn't imagine. I think there is always a world between men and women. Third one, I kept on saying this, but at the first time, I couldn't understand what was the song really about. That's why I was just keep watching. That makes us realize what this song was about. After a full story told, I could understand the feelings of the night. I like the third one. I like the first one. I like the game. For me, I like the third one because it's like one of the story of one's life. One's love story. So it makes people understand and keep empathy. It's like it's really emotional. They really love someone that expresses that feelings. The last video is a story of our generation. I really love the last video. I like what you like first. So it's like a song. A song? Yeah. I think it was such a good environment. It really relates to our generation. Sometimes people look down on people who put themselves first. Because it's selfish or it's not helping other people. But honestly, helping yourself is helping other people. We help ourselves so we can help other people become better people as well. I think it's a good meaning. It's like a joke that Chinese people have the great walls. Yeah. In the relationship. Yes. Creators of the DMZ. Yeah. Oh my god. That makes sense. That makes very much sense. I have a lot of friends who went through the same thing. Not just because of the great wall. But like in general, because of the situation, they couldn't be together. But they really persevered on being in a relationship because they really, really want to be together. So they really pushed through that. Now they're together. They're even together for a lot of time. So I'm really happy for them. I didn't know the story. I knew the song because my friends, they really loved this song. That's why I already heard this song. But I didn't know that was a meaning. Same. So the title, Buan, is not just other meaning. Yeah, it's not the other meaning. It was the meaning of a fragment of his imagination. That's so sad. Because it was something like under the moon. So I thought it was something under the moon. Yes, but it was under the imagination of... That's so sad. That is so sad. For me, I liked the last video. I've already heard the song before. And I realized that the meaning of Buan is not just one meaning. It's not just one meaning. My favorite music video, I think, is the first one. I knew that. I think really self-help is really important in a person's growth. And we need to think of ourselves first. And we need to maybe realize what we did. Or during the past. So we can help ourselves in the future. So then we can eventually help other people grow and other people become better. Do the same thing as well. It's not just about thinking about yourself. It's thinking what's better for yourself. So you can do something better for the society. Yes, yes. I think now, OPM, it talks more about mental health. Social things. Something that's tabooed in media and drama. I'm bearing it from the past OPM. Some like old OPMs. We talk about love and broken hearts. Well, they are gaining love. Now, they really focus on the struggles of mental health. Not just on a personal level, but in a relationship level. So I think it's really progressive. It's very progressive. What did I say? Just talk about it. It's a little bit deep. It's a little bit deep. Like the last one. Like someone's singing. It's like a mental thing. It's like a sign. I definitely have a lot of my Spotify. It's a really good song. I'll get that.
