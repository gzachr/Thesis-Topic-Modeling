 We are here, this is the start of the vlog. We're going to Philippines. Grace is literally stacked already. Grace, Ali, this is the vlog Philippines. Let's go. Out of 10, how excited are you? How are you to go home? 20, that's that solid. Right, we are flying from London Heathrow today to Singapore and then to Manila. Grace, happy to be going home. For the first time in how long? 18 months. 18 months. 18 months. Me, I'm a newbie. I'm very in a cacatiness. What are you doing? What are you looking for in the Philippines? For two. I'm looking forward to speaking to Galag to everyone. Ride of a gypsy because you've told me about that. A lot. When we just get the normal bus, you're like, oh, could be riding the gypsy. The food, the people. And also, you told me it's more fun in the Philippines. So I'm going to find that out over the next three weeks or so. And I'm going to come to a conclusion if the Philippines is better than the UK. That's part of the journey. It is actually better. I'm going home. Well, you are. I'm not going home. I'm going away from home. You're going home. You're going home. Jolly V, we're coming. Right. We've arrived Singapore, Grumpy. Only four more hours to go. Are you grumpy? Do you hate me? Do you think I'm nice and well-impersonated in the world? You can feel free to express yourself into Galag. Can I wait a bit? Yeah. That is, yeah. Great. So we're Singapore, Minila, and then going to completely crush out when we get to Minila. I'm going to be so tired. You're like, oh, let's go to the shopping centre. Let's go do this. I just want to sleep. At this point, I'm about to have a breakdown. Anyway. Right. Arrived in Lothilippines. I don't know what I just said. Yeah, you're back home. But also, like, one thing which is really crazy when you're more flying in what I'm saying, I'm like, wow, it's so, like, literally so, so flat. There was like a massive mountain in the distance. Let's ride to the Sovertile across town. We're not really across town. Experience how busy the roads are. I will not be driving ever. I will not be driving. I said to Grace, I was like, I said, if I was driving and everyone with beeping, I would just go and muck up. I'll be, I'm dumb. I'll be, I'm actually dumb with this. Impressions of Minila so far. Very, very busy. But I expect to like, it's like a hustle and bustle of like a capital city, a bit like London. We're not really like London. It's completely opposite to London. But yeah, this is the view we've got here. We're here for one night and then we go to Baroque for a couple of days. It's so brown. It's so brown. I'm white as this. Like if I, I'm blinded into it too much. Though the flight, if you are thinking about the flights, we flew from Heathrow Singapore, Singapore to Minila. I think it took over 24 hours. But the flights, the flights for the flights was pretty good, wasn't it? My view was like 600 pound round trip, which is really like reasonable for like a flight of that length, which obviously still a bit expensive. But obviously when you get here, it's not like the most expensive country I've heard. Looking forward to the food. And I'm going to continue this vlog when Grace stops being so shy. Who's so shy? Who's so shy? I'm having a flow ready. Let's start tour. I'm going to be in the store. So many on in the store. I'm going to talk to them. I just want to talk to them to something. I just broke that. That would be 2000 pesos, please. You look beautiful. Grace, what do you love about the Philippines? Which is better than the UK. Can't say food. Great. And my family's here. Obviously. I've been living in the Philippines. Yeah. The first time I'm going to be seeing them. Yeah. That's it. No other reasons. I don't know. The UK doesn't have gyplies. True. Everything is. Right. Just got back. Went out for a meal with Grace's family first time ever meeting them. I'm well, we were going to vlog it. But it's kind of like a thing, which is just a nice thing between me and their family. I don't want to whip my camera out. I'd be like, oh, get a vlog. But no. So yeah, we've just actually went to bar in the hotel. It was actually pretty good, wasn't it? And my parting skills, I actually do play golf. So I'm just going to add that in now. You're right. I'm going to be playing the game. So I'm going to be playing the game. I'm going to be playing the game. Oh, yeah. All right. That is big. Big. Big. No, no. No. It was a good first day. Obviously tied, running off limited sleep. Tomorrow, off to Baroque. Going to be some good vlogs on there, some content. Grace, do you have any parting words to say? Good night. Bye.
