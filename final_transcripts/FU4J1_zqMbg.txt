 But at a monthly expense of Â£684, my monthly rent in the UK wasn't much less than that. And to my American friends, I spent $842 American dollars. No doubt a lot of you will be saying, geez, I can't live on that. That's ridiculous. But look, if I had a thousand dollars a month to spend on nicer accommodation and better food, I would spend it. I'm not a rich man, nor a poor man, I'm frugal and living within my means. I know the value of money and watch what I'm spending. If I stay on this path for another few years, I can continue travelling and uploading videos.
