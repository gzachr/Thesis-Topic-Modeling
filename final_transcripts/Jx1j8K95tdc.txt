 Okay, first of all, I thought French people know about food. Ooh, we're talking about food today! What's up Philippines? How are you guys doing today? Today I am reacting to a girl that lives in France, but she is half Filipina. So she has been doing a lot of videos about her heritage and her cultural background. I think her mom is Filipina, I'm not quite sure. But yeah, today I am reacting to her doing a social experiment in France. It is French strangers try Filipino-Turon for the first time they fall in love. Wow! So I think I'm just going to jump straight into the video. I'm very, very excited to see the reactions and just see how, you know, French love Filipino food. How they like it? Ready? Well, I'm going to jump straight into the video. It's called the turon. Wow, homemade turon by my mom. Oh, it's so warm! Okay. We're going to jump straight into it. I want to let you go. It's between the country and the sea. Exactly! I want to go! It's really good. Come on. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You have to guess. You should go to the mom? No, maybe. You can go to the mom. I'm going to see it. Thank you. This is excellent. I hope you will live with the beauty of your chance. Oh, yes, we did. Hey, oh, this is Léa with the Nation. Here's a new video of my series, Making French People Try Filipino Food. So, I'm going to make a dessert for the turon. I'm in the 16th. We're going to make the turon's passion. You can't miss out on a turon or a mama. I don't like it. We're going to see their feedbacks and comments about the turon hoping that they will enjoy. So, just to remind you, it was not easy to make a message. I'm very happy to see you. Hello, my parents. Okay, first of all, I love the cheese just mixing French and a little bit of Tagalog and a little bit of English. Doing those kind of experiments is really difficult, especially in Europe, where people are not really eager to be in front of the camera. Me vlogging in the Philippines is very different, because as soon as you point a camera on somebody, it's like, Hi! But in Europe, people are very distant and very, you know, how should I say, reserved. So, who does to her for having the courage to just go out and give it a try? Excuse me, I'm going to make a dessert. You make a dessert? You? Do you want to have a dessert? You want a little bit of a dessert? No, it's not. It's a dessert. Oh, yeah, it's not like you're doing a little bit of tasting. I'm not doing a little bit of tasting. Yeah. Okay, not all of it. It's in this world, everything is from the rejects or how to start to kiss the arms. No, you have to keep your eyes open and stay persistent. It's dramatic. Here's the dessert. It's called the Taron. Taron. I want to have a dessert. Ah, two. A little bit of alcohol. Okay, I want to have a dessert. Bon appetit. Okay. Moment of truth. Hmm. Hello. Yes? Is that your pleasure to say, Masarab? Yes. Thank you. Well, thank you very much, man. Well, you have the opportunity to eat. Thank you very much. Thank you. Let's go. Do you like it? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Wow. You can do it. It's not a banana, it's a banana. Yes. It's a banana. It's a banana in front of you. And if you look at the colors, do you recognize... Do you want to say, you're good? Yes. We're going to have a dessert of the secret. It's good. Well, we're going to look at the camera and we're going to put a spoon in the air. Banana and ham. That's the work. I mean, pineapple and ham works. There is nothing. There are all kinds of things you have to take. I'm going to leave you a cup of beer. There you go. So, is it already seen today? It reminds you of something. Of course, they're looking at it like this. They're familiar. It's between the banana and the lemon. Exactly. And inside you recognize the fruit. That's right. I don't know if you're going to say anything about fruit. It's not that bad. Yeah, it's not that bad. So, in the colors, you said, you saw the violet. Now, it's actually the UB. It's a kind of a banana. Okay. There's something. Do you recognize something? Asian fruit. Not the mango. After that. No, it's not the mango. The jacquille. I can imagine everything. Okay, you've discovered it. It's the fruit. Is it more sour? Yes. It's the best. Okay, first of all, I thought French people know about food. No things. Saying raspberry, I mean, it does not taste like raspberry. I had jackfruit. It's a very different taste. It's a bit sour. It's a bit sour. It's like beer. It's a bit sour. Yeah, let's go. It's not a little one. What do you know? It's a fruity one. There's nothing that's sour. No, it's sour. It's yellow. Yeah, it's a bit sour. It's a bit sour. Yeah, it's not the arctic one. It's not sour. It's not sour. Yeah, it's sour. But for the taste, it really looks like the same. It's a banana from the banana from me. Oh, yeah. Oh, it's a banana flavor. It really looks like the banana from me. It's a big mix of lemon and banana. It's a bit sour. It's sour. It's like they've already eaten in the end. In the end. In the end. In the end. I want to taste a dessert. It's called the turon. It's a bitter one. Yeah, kids will love it. Yeah. It's good. It's good. Yeah, it's sour. Yeah, it's sour. Yeah, it's good. Good job. No. Maybe the taste is sour. It's a bit sour. It's sour. I'm going to eat it. I'm going to eat it. I'll take a look. Our goal is to taste the UB. It's a bit sour. Oh. We're going to make the pie. So it's good. We're going to make a thumbs up. It's the turon. Ah, it's sour. Yeah. So, attention. Is my wife doing very good? Well, just a moment. You're going to try it. Yes. It's good. Yeah. He's curious. He wants to try it too. Mmm. Like a lally pop. A candy. She called for it. And why? It's very good. Yes. Yes. And do you recognize the other fruits inside? Well, you said it's banana? Yes. There are two others. Mmm. The baby loves it. Yeah. You have to guess. It's going to go. It's going to be a little bit sour. Oh, there's UB in the bag. There's a towel. Yes. It's very good. There's a little bit sour. Yeah. UB is something that a lot of people are not familiar with. And especially in Europe, we have sweet potato, which is imported. But UB is just so different from sweet potato. Similar but very, very different. But what's the thing here? It's really good. How come I never met you? You're not going to be in the house. How come you never give me? It's super. In love, maybe you already took it. It's a mace. It's a mace. It's good. Let's go to the thumbs up. Yes. I think you're going to go. No, no, no. Oh my god. I saw it. I thought I had a mace. Yes, sure. I know the tower. It's very good. It's for me, it's... It's really... Super. Yes, yes, yes. Then there are idols that change. But why don't you put the lanka? Well, the lanka! It's like the Jackfruit. It's like the other ones that you... It's like the other ones that you... It's like the other ones that you... It's like the other ones that you... It's like the other ones that you... It's difficult. Yeah, I was just thinking the same. There is. Oh, don't know. Yeah, yeah. It's very good. Thank you very much. Bravo! We called the tower. It's a long time ago. I was going to go to the movies. It's a little bit familiar. It's like a long time ago. It's like a long time ago. That's it. Maybe when we're going to have a good time, it's going to be good. Let's go. I wanted to choose. We don't have anything important. Come on, let's go. Do you know the three of us? No, no, no. I'm going to go to the water. Good night. No, it's free to do it. It's not bad. Yes, a little bit secret. It's thinking. So there is a sex. Yes. It's already the form that you call something family. No, no. It's not like that. It's nice. It's free to do it. It's a local. A exotic fruit. Yes. If there is a yellow fruit that we find in France, a lot of potassium. It's not the pineapple, is it? No, but it's a fruit. A fruit? No. It's a fruit. It's a fruit. I never had it. I mean, yeah, you can find it in Europe, but it's not in Europe. No, it's not in Europe. Oh, it's a fruit. It's a fruit. Yes. It's a fruit. We have everything. We have the orange, generally. It's a banana. It's a banana plant. Ah, it's a banana plant. It's a fruit. It's a fruit. Oh, yeah, it's a fruit. Oh, you want some too? I want some too. I want some too. Yes. Yes, it's a fruit. Yes. So, it's a house. For a moment, there's no more. We just try to see the video of democracy by discovering. It's excellent. Nice. Yes. I hope the model opens a restaurant. Thank you very much, Monsieur. Bon appétit. Can I remind you of a girl? Ah, it's good. It's good? It's like a city. We're going to the south of the tent. We're going to the banana plant. We'll see it in the banana plant. Ah, it's beautiful. You see it with the UB. You see it with the UB. It's funny because we have a dessert that looks like this. We also have a sugest. We're next to it, actually. We eat similar things. The UB is the first time I taste it. It's really good. I had never tasted it before. I'm not disappointed. I always train with you. And... It's so good. It's so good. It's so good. It's so good. Thank you Tony. Yes. I hope you enjoyed it. The food is really good. It's super beautiful. It's so good. It's so good. Oh, I see. If you enjoyed this, let me know in the comments. And we're going to make other videos of making French people try Pinot Phone. Nice. Yeah, definitely give her a follow if you want to see more videos. And I can understand that people are confused with the purple color. Uber is, as I say, not a familiar taste. And then specifically having it mixed with banana. It just tastes very, very different. I agree that it's best eaten when it's still warm. So it's crunchy. And you have this warm banana flavor and everything is caramelized. So it's super, super nice. Not the healthiest snack though. But definitely one that is very, very satisfying for the sweet too that you have. If you enjoyed this video, give it a thumbs up. Definitely subscribe if you are new and want to see more of my videos. I'll see you guys in the next one here on What's Up Philippines. Orivwa. Bye.
