 That is hilarious. Come on, Bob, hi. Magandangabe, and welcome back to MGMD. And before we even start this video, I'd like to thank you so much for your feedback on the SB19 what music video reaction it was awesome I must have watched that music video at least five times already because I thoroughly enjoyed the song but also the music video yes I got some hate on my reaction because people usually tend to focus on the drama you know people who usually enjoy what they're watching you know they will not leave a comment it's really people that you know try to find issues that usually comment and I've gotten some messages some sweet messages from you guys telling me to not focus on the on the haters you know I'm used to it by now I really don't focus on the haters and people who you know insult me or stuff like that are immediately banned and it just comes with the territory you know the bigger you get the more hate you will get and I understand that okay but we are here today to react apparently to a funny video okay so the title and Tagalog is Baguio Carlang Pinoy Cam√≠ which apparently means you're just a typhoon where filipino okay I honestly don't know what this is going to be about if it's about a typhoon I'm not surprised because the filipines is a country that is very familiar unfortunately with environmental catastrophes like typhoons like floods like volcano eruptions you know what I mean like man power to you guys seriously power to you but before we start please consider follow me on instagram at music game news and we love for the redo let's check it out what the hell oh my god this is very dangerous I don't think people should do this but it's freaking hilarious he he thinks he's a rock star he's basically using the strong winds of the typhoon to replace the wind that you know big stars like Michael Jackson use and their music videos you know like wind generated by by technology by machines you know oh my god I mean props to him it's dangerous props to you he's like oh oh oh yeah see he was imitating Michael Jackson RIP man the best artist that this world has ever known in my opinion what in the world is going on dude that is so freaking dangerous people that play with fire like this and in this case play with typhoon what are you doing you know a branch could hit you in the face and knock you out cold bro get to shelter oh my god people are just seeking attention no freaking way the dude is crumping I think that's how it's called this type of dancing is crumping he is crumping in the middle of a typhoon I guess people are just bored in the Philippines seriously and it looks like a kid hey man look this is dangerous but his crumping is actually pretty dope oh that is hilarious see you don't need Hollywood or CGI to create amazing effects with the water you just have to stand on a on a what see it is seemingly a port you know and just play with the water wait for that wave to hit you and just put your hands up god this is awesome it's so creative though okay in this case I think it's okay it doesn't seem like it's too dangerous you know so it's fine it's extremely creative I love it it's like he is literally controlling the sea you know what's the name of the DC comics superhero you know that is like the god in the water I'm drawing a blank like I watched the movie of you know and stuff but I forgot his name oh wow oh oh how is he so in sync with the water room nah that looks photoshopped the first guy this guy no not him no seriously guys this cannot be real oh my god it looks photoshopped oh oh my god chilling chilling man why not take a bath during a typhoon and drink some beers yeah sure as long as you're not in danger okay wow this is insane oh my god oh come on you cannot tell me that computers here are actually functioning that's impossible what are these serious it looks like they are in class with the room completely flooded this is insane and it's very very dangerous you can get electrocuted electrocuted whoa oh my god this is so dangerous I mean I can tell that they put all the electric electric you know stuff above water but still still this is dangerous wow I mean it's like why should life stop because of a typhoon right I mean you guys are used to it by now so you know exactly what to do shabar angst this is crazy oh no stop it stop it this is not happening this is not real I mean this cannot be photoshopped I mean anything can be photoshopped but I don't know but it feels very real are you serious they're actually studying in school in the water like that this is this is just it's unbelievable yeah this one I saw before this picture oh my god I went through so many states of emotions here I left I was scared I was worried for them I felt sad I felt empathy I felt like I wanted to help you know what I mean like so many but but the one thing that really stands out for me is just the the the the resilience you know of Filipinos and just the love for life like nothing is gonna stop Filipinos which means that this title the title of this video is actually very accurate like yeah you're just typhoon we're Filipinos you know we we we we can fight anything you know we deal with hardships it's no problem wow that was like I said hilarious and scary at the same time dude and I think my favorite one was the guy that was controlling the sea and it's really really bothering me that I cannot remember the name of the superhero you know that swims you know and that Jason Momoa right played in the movie what's his name it has something to do with sea no oh my god and I even remember like I have a scene in my mind of the Big Bang Theory where Raj actually dresses up as that hero and says that he doesn't want to dress like that hero because he sucks but I can't remember the name oh please let me know in the comment section it's really really bothering me but yeah this video was so much fun I love the fact that you know some days I react to something more serious some days it's like music some days is something more lighthearted like this so much fun now it is your turn to tell me the comment section below if this is true you know that's the first thing and then what you think of it you know have you ever experienced something like this you know oh my god I mean in Algeria you know we've had floods but nothing like this the water does not reach this high that's insane that's crazy like I can't say personally that I've experienced this like would the worst thing that I've experienced was playing basketball when it was like heavily raining when I was living in Kenya but that's it wow that is
