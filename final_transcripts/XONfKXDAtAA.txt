 Hey hey hey what's up guys welcome to a new vlog Today I'm on the island of Bohol Still here in the Philippines obviously and I'm staying in a place called Bohol Coco farm It's a really nice hot stuff and I ran to the motorbike as you can see and today I'm gonna go out by myself and explore this island There's a few attractions that I'm interested in So I'm gonna bring you with me. You ready? Let's go So I was looking for a place called the manmade forest or at least that's what It was listed on the tour I chose not to go on the organized tour today where you just pay and go in a van and they bring you to all these places Instead I figured I just ran to motorbike and go to some of those places myself And one of the places listed on that list was called manmade forest and I looked on the map And it was supposed to be around here somewhere But I don't see a manmade forest anywhere So I think we're gonna skip that one But one of the most popular attractions on this island is known as chocolate hails So we're gonna go there I'll show you that I think it's about an hour drive away from here So I'll see you there So we're not quite at the chocolate hills yet But just want to show you what I'm driving through So been driving through a lot of towns and villages with a bunch of stores and buildings and homes like this But every once in a while we come across a place that looks like this With a big open view of the sea and a beautiful river hold on check this out Woooow Woooow All right, we're about halfway to the chocolate hills. I'll see you there Swipe away guys check it out This is the manmade forest I just saw a sign back there that says a manmade forest And on my map it said it was way back where it was about an hour ago But apparently this is it Now let's take a little drive through it shall we? So much division my vision is faded We all from the same tree but your name's degraded Judging the different branches and music that elevated Just because it's farther from the roots Don't mean that you should hate it Because it's a time and place for everything that's been created Damn All right, that was a cool forest You hear that noise? Sounds like a bunch of bugs like zipping Anyway, I'll see you at chocolate hills I'm right made into the chocolate hills Well first I got to climb up here And I know I started the day where to helm it But you know your boys got his adventure hat with him All right, let's climb these stairs Get to the top and check out this view Oh this view is breathtaking And so the stairs Kind of ride up here because I was excited Let me catch my breath Check out this view I'm going to play with the camera This view is incredible But you guys know this isn't good enough It's time to get higher You guys ready to fly? Let's do it This is nice up here Not much of chocolate hills actually More like minty hills Hi I guess uh usually the hills are rather brown But I guess they're flourishing right now So they're growing grass so they're rather green But still nice Now I think I'm going to head back to my bike Ride a little bit longer Get some food pretty hungry get some lunch And there's a really exciting thing Well exciting for me There's a big swing called the plunge That I've heard about I saw videos I'm going to go check that out So let's go there Taking a quick pit stop at this public market See if I can find some food Let's go explore Got a bunch of shoes I'm not really hungry for shoes though Got a bunch of bunch of bunch of bunch of bunch bunch of things I don't need Here's the veggie part of the market But I don't want the raw goods I want the cooked goods Hello Is there anywhere I can find food to eat That is already already cooked Oh my god That way You got to take a selfie Thank you But I'm so thinking What?
