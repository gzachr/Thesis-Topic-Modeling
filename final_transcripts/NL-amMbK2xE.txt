 Future Friday. The freshest. Since we discovered Nora Aunor, which is... Which was mind blowing, by the way. And one of the most popular and most awarded actresses actually in the Philippines, she's just a Jiauk singer, because welcome to the land. She can do it all. We got recommended Maricel Soriano. And Maricel Soriano, it's like known as like one of the... another big actress, but she's actually known for her dancing. Oh fabulous. Which is referred to as the Diamond Star for her acting prowess, talent and popularity. People can't recommend in this video of her and Al Mar Moreno. Okay, new names I love when we travel back in time. Al Mar Moreno means like... Brown soul. Brown soul, yeah. In Spanish. Spanish soul. It's a beautiful name though. Let's give you some watch. Al Mar Moreno and Maricel Soriano. How cool! Bravo. Wow. They got to accept it even the cameraman. I can't keep it to go. Look at that stage. Wow, so much good acting. Brian Miss. Oh, I wish it was just like in the back in the good old days. I wasn't even alive there. I just look at those videos and I'm like, man, we just doesn't feel like that anymore. You know what I'm saying? Watching these videos, like when we were looking at... no, no, no. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. We were looking at No Out Nor and the 70s videos and stuff. I was just like, I didn't think, damn, wouldn't it be cool to recreate the same video today, like how Bruno Mars did it when he's... No, no, no, bang. Yeah, she does. It would be so cool to recreate these videos. Like, look how cool they are. No, and the freaking costumes they are obsessed. Oh, I listen, bang. Isn't there such a lovely side to just a raw, pure dance performance without Shabang? Yes, yes, yes. I love this. Because it's all about the presence, the attitude when you have a little simple stage. Yeah. The A-d is so good. That is so cool. Proud of. I love this. No need for flips. No, no, no, just two beautiful feminine women. Yes. Just exuding seduction, bro, as they dance and move. Because it's all about, that's what it is about. Without being grotesque. Without having to wear anything revealing. No, bro. They're charming. Yes, they're seduced by them. That's true. Also, different styles of dancing, different types. But how cool are they? You see, Eddie's also subtle. They're so great at it. They're great. Oh my dancers. Oh, they are. I love these. I love these. Your channel was out here.ilar. Yeah, I love it. Hey! The movie is the best part. Where's the nightly flow from? It's midnight. Really. I almost felt bad yesterday. Sure. Could be like connect- with like commercial gems. Look. Right. God, dude, dude, dude. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. Bring this day's back. A little bit of cha cha there, you see that? Yeah, no different styles, right? Very cool. And, oh, tango, okay. Ew. Oh, dang. I love me. I could step through step. They're so effective. Oh, the 80s, baby. Did it come on? Yes. I'm a big fan of her. It's the guys in the background. They're leaving their best life. Look at them. Ooh. Step, step, step. One, two, three. Do immensely well right now. Today, right, I think so too. I don't know the market. I don't know the market. We know shit. This is based on... Solly. I'm telling you, we're gonna recreate it. I would love to. Like, for a single for you, some shit. Yeah. I mean, yes. It's so cool. Ah, Bravo. Look at the people losing their minds in the audience. Very nice. Very nice. It reminds you kind of what? And look at this, stay there. Oh, and the magic. It was a cable, bro. I think... How crazy, bro. You are on another level of coolness. She... Very... Alfa Moreno and Marcel. Maricel Soriano. She has a YouTube channel. Oh, no way. She does like interviews and stuff. Marcel. Oh, damn. Ah, the other one was too tame. She was totally wild. Oh, I love the 80s, man. Yes. Dude. Okay, the dancers had the best outfits. Can I be mad at that? I'm on top. Can I be mad at that? Oh, so it's a very fast-known thing. But you know, you didn't do anything random stuff. Whoa. It's trying to stop the rain. Well, do you want a chabang? You get for a chabang. Okay, the white neatads. Absolutely banging. Oh, these new kids... Oh, these new kids thinking like, oh, you know, being a boss and being a girl boss and dancing on the stage. Just like new era. Shut the f*** up. No, you're not. You're all copying all these people. Like, these new kids think that like, I'm so original. I don't want to be like anyone else. It's been done before. This is cool, though. Respect that you're standing on the shoulder of giants. All of you TikTok motherf***er. Yeah. I don't know who's this director. Yeah. How cool is she, though? She's not singing. I have no idea. I can't see her mic. I can't see her mic. No, I don't think she has a mic. I think it's just a dance before. Yeah. It was like acting through song template. Because she was known for her dancing, not for her singing. She's a really cool, though. She's a brother, girl, and they're back. Yeah. Out of here, it's a happy thing. It does just that. They're back. They're just literally giving, living, yeah. It was the 80s. It was a time to do the stuff. What song is this? I have no idea. I can't see it in my heart. She's a rock star. How cool is she? If you want to show, thank you. Look at the guy in the denim vest in the background. He was doing people with like... Did they just carry her? Like, did she just fly from the flying stairs to the actual stairs? Wow. Wow, yes. If you ever wonder if dirty dancing was like everything, I knew it. It just screams 80s. Well, I'm very interested on keeping digging and keeping discovering. I actually want to keep going further back. Because it seems a lot of these singers, dancers, actresses are not only still the world record holders. They're not only still the most awarded ever in the Philippines, but also very successful all across the world back in the day. Back in the day, it was even harder to break through boundaries and what do you call it? Frontiers. Because the internet wasn't a thing. Imagine that. The efforts were tripled. Let us know about more artists like this. It does enhance our knowledge and I think new people and new generation that watch these types of videos, regardless of where they're from, start to get more informed and start to respect the past.
