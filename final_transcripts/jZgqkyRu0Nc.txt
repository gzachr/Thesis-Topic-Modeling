 So recently I've seen a couple of you guys been telling me that I need to wreck this guy So I was like, why everyone want me to wreck this guy? I've never, it's not someone that I rex on the channel, not gonna lie, never listen to him before So I tap in his name on YouTube and I was looking through his videos to see which one I should pick So I've recognized that he was on the voice, the voice Philippines And then I scrolled down and I was scrolling to see if there's more videos of him like original videos and stuff And then I saw RIP like the short section of YouTube saying RIP this RIP that And short videos posted on YouTube saying RIP What it seems to be on the thumbnail, I haven't clicked on the video to see because I don't really like to see stuff like that I think he was hadn't bike accident, maybe he was rushed to the hospital and he didn't made it But based on what I've seen on YouTube looks like he's passed away so if that's the case, RIP Maybe this is the reason why you guys are requesting me to do a reaction of him because I guess he's like when someone posted that you know him He kind of go back and watch their old stuff like if a rapper died that you know Automatically people go and listen to his music, right? So I guess you guys are listening to maybe even watching this video over again, I think he have watched it years already But yeah RIP man, you can't explain that but he has no time when it day comes, it just comes in it And it's a part of life but yeah, the voice of the Philip Leans blind audition Let's go I remember you guys said the RIP culture is actually quite strong over there in the Philippines Oh my god, wait a minute Goosebumps just run down straight on my face, wait a minute Man's a real raster for right no shoes, no nothing, it's just pure I I I You I You You I You I You I You It's always this one judge sorry, okay? Okay, okay, okay, but you know already if you guys knew to the channel the pronunciation over here is it's anyway back to the video There's always this one The judge does always try to play hardball and this is why I think most of these reality TV show is kind of rigged because in every single audition or singer got talent or whatever There's always a judge that has to be mean. It's like the judge is kind of the own character that every audition has you do we all agree? Give me down. I mean that's every competition has It's worth it But I never let you get me down Oh yeah Why not I just need a little reggae type vibes I I One day But one day But you're one day It's one day Oh Well ladies I will change We'll be better than the same stuff with your money Oh my days you know what song I would like him to sing if he done a video on that I'm going to search it up for this um Bob Molly Redemption song Is it what is it called again is it redemption redemption redemption song I'm trying to remember what that song title is called but I feel like it will nail it I'm proud to be that we are never sent to an insane song to be the guy Oh Oh It's all my life We need to find the pain in our When the people just say they've been at me though When the time goes on When the world is till you're the only one day But his whole voice is hope or sonar his whole look Everything is just screaming reggae like it's just pure it's not like he's forcing a genre that he doesn't belong in It just seems so natural and that's some shit that's crazy Oh It sings with emotion as well I mean it's sing the emotion as well You guys actually I don't know if this video is going to be blocked because this is the voice Philippines All of the voice reactions I've done they always got blocked so hopefully you guys see it I know for sure this is not getting monetized I don't do it actually for monetization peep anyway But anyway if you guys want to see more of them if this if you guys get to see this recommend which song or video you like the most And I'll do some of them in it but yeah once again RIP man this he sees he seems just like a genuine song But like I said he never know when that time comes so it's like just leave your life to the fullest That would be more advice to you leave your life to the fullest Not like the last days tomorrow because you can go about your life like that you end up being 60 without nothing But just have fun bro don't take everything too seriously because you all go into the same place Don't let her reach on poor we're all going on the ground Yeah for that direction of this video share support by slapping on that lab And subscribe to the channel for more content like DSC Spinial, Boy Spinial, hold me
