 So we now have a swimming pool forming on the land. Let's open next to us. Holy smokes. Nice. Thanks Brad. Gonna go take a look at the beach. So for some reason we lost all of our pyjamas. Talk about timing. If you have any afternoon and we got a red rainfall warning it just won't stop raining. I think this is when the river is going to start really going up. That's not so water. That's all fresh water. It's different than respected. A river of fresh water if I never house going into the ocean. Oh my gosh. Oh no. Bro. My second bro. I just hope the wind doesn't kick up again. I like to have fun. I've also realised over the years that right now there's a lot of people who are probably getting soaked or flooded in their houses. It's a sucks man. One of the things about it makes life difficult for so many people here in the Philippines. The environment sometimes could be very difficult. We don't have any. All of our pyjamas are gone but how are you? So I decided not to cook for lunch. So I said we'll just have a light, something light for lunch. Late lunch. We can take it right now. My rose is just casually making chicken in the kitchen in the dark. Because nothing, she fears nothing. I'm not unlikely. You're walking. It's so silly. I don't know. I mean, Colas was walking. He was walking in the park. It's not reckless. It's just like, it's just... I was having fun. I don't have it fun. I just did this monitor. You young talk me. Mama, who was that? It's Colas. He became silly. He was walking. And then the storm. And he has a good time. He feels like walking in the park. But I do have a little bit of fear. I'm like Mama Rose, who's fearless. No, no, I'm not. I mean, our place is not flat here but you can see. There's a little bit of a river in the driveway right now. Because our rain is just an hour. I'm not going to stop. Oh, it's gross. There's Mama Rose's driveway. I decided actually, I think I can pop into the Brunga. I'll just grab my car. Maybe he can buy a few things. I'm so about stuff for a bullard. But let's take it to quiet it down again. Let's hope that was the last. Somebody was telling me that Kragga had a few Brunga's. I had to evacuate. It's tough times, man. And this stuff happens. So again, you want to have fun or run under the rain and have a laugh. But you have to also realise a lot of people these moments are really tough soon. Okay, just approaching the Brunga. Hopefully it's not flooded at the backside like last time. I'm just going to grab a few things now. Sodeens in tomato sauce. I think the guys want to make sodeens and noodles. But looking at them in the back of Cecil's store right now, the SM of the Brunga. You can hear this a generator because it's been brown out for the past kind of, going on and off the past 24 hours. Double good news. Brunga is looking alright. Everyone's chill. Just no power. But people are hanging out. You can go to the bakery, you can go to the shop. Second thing. Donut lollipops. At the Cecil, where the heck did you get this thing? It is freaking cute. Look at that. Donut lollipop. Oh my gosh. I don't know what to say. It's fruity. It looks like a donut. Mmm. That's five pieces of awesome right there. You got to love the little strange unique candies you can get at the shops and sorries and the Philippines. Part of the fun. Mmm. Extra garlic. Fuck. What's the best? Hi, what's the best? I like your artichoke though, but I just love garlic chips. So this is what I do all the time. I made it back. There's something really comforting about just eating. He's starting sweetens our right out of the can on a rainy day. Mmm. Mmm. Yeah, I ran came back again, but it definitely seems to be calm. Now I should stop saying that knock on wood. I don't want to drink it, but all seems to be okay. Super impressed that Costa Sillin's pool at the sun, the drone, is actually still looking very clean and blue. When the ocean is just brown, there's a lot flowing into it right now from the mountains. A lot of dirt and silt. It's just going to chill, relax, take a nap. Great story. See you and I see you. Nice. That's good. Well, I had to come pick up my laundry because in about a day and a half we'd be heading out and then slowly making my way towards Canada. But for every time I was able to see it, the cats that you'll just see park and treat. It's really good, I like it. Nice sky of... This place is beautiful. This place is one of my favorite in the Philippines. It's really, really as flavor and vibes in the score count. Hey, give me a gig. Hey, give me a gig. Alright, I take three photos. Let me get it. I realised as well that Simbonga Biggie has started. Every morning I was super early and people were going to this church in the Faza. I have something very common here in the Philippines. I believe it's nine mornings in a row. And it's something people try and compete. Or complete, not compete. And also, there tends to be a lot of little snacks. There's a little bombings kicking around. Merry Christmas from Katyaeo. But I will be spending Christmas in Katyaeo this year. Just as I said that... It's now officially brown out. Just as I said that. We're spending Christmas. Maybe that's an omine. I should have spent Christmas here with the cats of you. Brown out. Good night, Munga Christmas tree. That's really nice, man. Look at this one. Wow. That is a beautiful house. Beautiful home. Another old home. We're in Kragga. That oriental. Looking for a karendria. Sorry, I'm hungry. It's the morning. It's 10 a.m. Talk to you when we find it. I'm hungry. Is that a good home? Good home, John. Good home, John. Oh, John? No way. Oh my gosh. Wow. The thing is maybe because the storm is something the karendria is. Don't have a lot of slacks. Oh. This one. Fish. Oh, this looks alright. Dude, I've never been in the back of the terminal. First time in Kragga. Top tip. Terminals. Have food in the Philippines. Perfect timing as well. Yeah, sakto. Oh, that's a good man. Oh, it's nice mango. It's nice above. Oh, and that can be so many options. It's a good spot. It's the... This one. It's the same. Is it from the river? Yes, it is. It's the smaller fish. It's good, huh? It's good, man. Tempting, bro. It's an apricot, but it's... It's a bit different from... Salgu. Salgu? No. Oh, it's from the river? No way. It's a native fish bar. Wow, very cool. Only one bar. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. So, what? Yeah, I might as well get to do that. Dude, that's so cool. Is that a native dish here? It's all done. It's a mouth. It's a mouth. It's interesting that you cook at Paxyr style, no? Wow. It's vinegar, right? It's like a white meat. You can dig in with the soup, no? Can you cook it with the river? I can. Okay, cool, cool, cool. How do they catch them with net? Mingwit or net? Net. Net or cool, cool, cool. And yeah, that's a local delicacy here. Only sometimes in season, kind of white meat. And there's little mini shrimps. Mungo Pazai and Gikens with soupa? Yes, karaka. Ah, everything's from Karakar River. Okay, really, really cool. I'm going to cook it with vinegar and a bit of olive. Let's see, once I try it, it's called Aliwagwo. It's called Daupingan. So they have these in Aliwagwo River as well with their bigger. It's called Daupingan. So these, and by the way, they're not seasonal. They're all year round. So the locals, they catch these things, mix them up, cook them back soon. It's a pretty big pito as well. Like, it's a little pito with a pito. What is it? A pito? Bedel. What the big is, not that one. Okay, I'm sakto. Now we know. Good vibes. Good vibes. Just leaving Karakar and you can tell they definitely have some hot air here. I think the tropical storm, this is where some of the rivers with the overflowing. Yeah, look at right here, no? Everyone's moving to the stuff out. Grab the oil, yeah. That is the Pasalic position, maybe. No touching right. That's awesome. That is amazing. It's either the Pasalic position or the no touching position. This is the bamboo. Oh my gosh, that's the ninja moves position right there. That's a stable one. Oh yeah, that's gonna be hot. It's like Mario Go card. He's gonna hit you with it. And then we're gonna spin out. I'm swimming down by the underline. Woo, woo, underline. I'm swimming down by the underline. Yeah, I've been doing my radio drama. If you ever heard it in body, you get some good parodies or herbal oil. What I guess? Is it a drama ad? It's a drama ad. Hey, it's 4 p.m. in the afternoon. All of my paperwork and things are done. And I am in Pentuken, Gavinson Bucco in the market area. I'm just gonna hold Bucco, Brad. I'm pretty easy to go Bucco but we'll get that. I'm pretty, we'll get that. We're pretty, we'll get that. We're pretty, just a lady. I'll be honest, I'm not really a big fan of the Gataas in my Bucco. So I'm just buying a whole Bucco. Oh, you guys are singing. I'm getting past Gohan for my Bucco. I'm going to get it. Oh, Bucco is life. Bucco is life. But I don't have a Bucco. Bucco, Bucco. Gavin, do you have a Bucco? Coconut. It's English. Coconut. Coconut. Sack toad. By the way, if you're gonna get a Bucco or a Bucco from a vendor who sells them at the Gataas, expect to pay a premium because they usually mix this with coconut milk. They're losing a coconut, but you just pay a bit more and then it's all good. I just realized I might have made a mistake though, you know what? It's so hard for you to do it. No, no, no, no, this would be fine. You need a straw. I like the style. No, it's okay. The style is good. You see it, there's just a side cut. The problem is the coconut is very warm. That's why I think it's... Let's go to the mini-life bench. It's dude. That is a very, very warm coconut juice. It's been under the sun. Yeah, I never... I should have... I should have. Dude, that's really... Very warm. It's so very refreshing. Well, you know what is refreshing though? What's refreshing is the brand new bridge that's finally complete and saves us a lot of time. And saves us time. We'll see you when we cross it. Alright, everybody, if you are from Davao area, you will know we just crossed over the longest bridge. At least it was for four years. That small little bridge had so many backups. Huge traffic jams, because one side was under construction. But finally, as of a few weeks ago, it is done. They finished the new side. So even though it's 5pm right now, there's no more waiting. There's no more lineups. You're cruising into Davao city. The longest bridge is now the shortest bridge. Tuganai, success, Daog. If you're from Davao, you'll know why I'm fist pumping. That's all. That's the excitement. See you in the city. 11pm late night flight. And even though 1am, back to Muzon, few days away from Canada. Power on.
