 Alright people! Flying cows in town, baby! Alright people, Flying Cow has arrived in Manila. Man I am so excited to be back guys. This is actually my second time in Manila. However, this is my first time in Mandalu, Jung. Last time I stayed in Makati, which was really awesome. So today my plan is to just walk around Mandalu Jung. Get a feel for the vibes. Get a feel for the people. So I say let's get rolling. It is my very first time in Mandalu Jung. And I gotta say people. Hey what's up guys? What's your name? Cow man, how are you doing? You from Mandalu? Yeah! Good place, good place people. Oh man, as always the vibes in the Filipino hospitality. It doesn't matter if you're in Makati, if you're in Mandalu Jung, if you're in Kaisan City. The Filipino hospitality always remains a constant. But today the plan is to just walk around and see what we can find in this chill little area. Mandalu Jung, let's get out of the way. I don't know how to lay those cars. Hello sir, how are you? Good, good, fantastic, holy crap. That looks like a place I gotta go. I love it man, I love it. I love seeing the cables all over the sky. I love seeing the cables, I love seeing the organized chaos of the Philippines. You know, somehow it all works, it all functions. Hello sir, how are you? Good, nice, nice. Hello sir, how are you? Good, good. Man, I have to say that everybody, everybody in Mandalu Jung seems to be doing good. Oh yeah, school's out. Time to be happy, it's Friday, weekends coming. Time to play people, time to play. Alright guys, as we are exploring Mandalu Jung, I will lay out some of my plans for this channel. I'm relying on KEL, brought to you by one of the co-founders of Dubrovskiv. Yeah, so I'm gonna be in the Philippines for exactly 28 days. This trip, four weeks. And I'm gonna be spending the next eight in Manila. I just arrived, just arrived pretty much today. After that, my plans are quite flexible. I think it depends on what all my zero subscribers in the comments are gonna say. I'm gonna suggest I do, just gonna see where it takes me. I'm just gonna have an organic... Yeah man, you? That was a fun, that was a fun in the Philippines. Yeah, I'm thinking about maybe... Hello. I think about maybe Boracay or let's call it Koron. Hello? Hello! Are you? Okay. Hi. See you. I'm loving the vibes here in Mandalu Jung, loving it. So lively, so lively around here people. What was I saying man? Too many good vibes.

What's there? Countryside. Okay, let's do the countryside, people. I will sign a book. Is it not raining? I know, I know, I'm sad. Otherwise I will burn. Why? Because I'm so white. This burns. Oh, you're red. Alright guys, that was so nice of them. They came with an umbrella. Because they saw how white I am, those are. And to be honest guys, I put like, I put like three layers of sunscreen on man, because this Filipino sun, you know, it burns me. It will burn me to a freaking crisp. Believe me, I'll be a lobster if I don't put any sunblock on. So, that was really nice. Alright, let's continue the journey. I think I'd love the Jitni's people. The Jitni's and the Tricycles, just like anywhere. In the Netherlands. They have them in Mandeluyong as well. Alright guys, all this walking around and all these good Filipino vibes have really given me a huge appetite. So I think that I am. Woo! Gonna get some food. Some authentic Mandeluyong food. Mandeluyong has definitely passed the Filipino vibe test. The vibes are through the roof. Now, can we get some kick-ass Filipino food here? We're gonna have to find out. I've found a very, very popular little car in India. So I suspect that this is a store restaurant here in Mandeluyong. Let's go check it out. Careful on the road. Oh, this looks good. Hello! How are you? Good, you? Hi, my name is Akiwak. I just want to eat some good Filipino food. You have recommendations? Ah! Nothing else! Everything is good.

I've got a lot of things to do. Ah. And now I'm just enjoying this nice little breeze. It's a little mandaluyon breeze. Next to this mandaluyon river. Actually, I think this is the Pasek River. That kid knows how to chill. That is the boat that crosses from mandaluyon to Makati. They have to make a very dangerous and treacherous journey across the Pasek River. Let's wish them good luck guys because nobody knows if they're going to make it. Brave, brave souls. They made it. They've made it people. They really made it. God that's awesome. I think the people in mandaluyon really love chickens. Because a lot of them seem to have chickens as pets here. Good little chicken. It's a good little chicken.
