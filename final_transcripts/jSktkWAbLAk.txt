 you There's money, another day, another dollar. I gotta try this grass cutter. But we need a gas and oil. So let's go and buy that. I'm ready to go. Okay, let's go. I'm gonna go and get this. Okay, I gotta try to start this baby today. I did my mixture. It's a 91 octane and two-stroke motor oil. So let's fill up and try to start. Roll, follow it red. Okay, time for lunch. Beautiful mixture of vegetable with egg, excellent. And some bamboo, fry bamboo. You have rice and I have other rice. I can't eat rice. I have bread. Tosted bread. Always toast the bread to get rid of some of the chemical. Okay, let's eat. Oh, I'm a little red wine there. Of course, you've seen that. Not the beer. Yep. That's it. Time to cut the grass. I'm gonna cut the grass. I cut the grass. I cut the grass. I cut the grass. I cut the grass. Need to rest. Now we go back there. It's heavy, too. Yay. Parabai lala bamba. Okay, that's the area. I cleaned up today. Tomorrow we do more. It's a big job. This is much better than this. Anyway, that's it for today. I'm having a food bath, cleaning, pedicure, so tired. This crosscutting is not a easy thing to do. It's very heavy. It's not that heavy, but it's okay. Tomorrow, after tomorrow, I'm a little bit more and so forth. I need to use a little one just for the edges. Pretty good. So I'll be charging it. And I'm relaxing with my pedicure and very cold beer. The glass was in the fridge in the freezer and the cold beer put inside the glass. Beautiful. Hmm. Wow. It's better than my cooking ice cream. Yes, pretty good. Anyway, I didn't do much with the crosscutter because I had to learn it and best way to start it. Still haven't really mastered the plaster is to put the plastic string around it. They'll keep coming off, breaking. Maybe that's not the one to do, but the blades, I hope, it's so big, so heavy. I worry. But I'm going to try that next time to go into the rough grassy. There's a lot of roots and things like that. That's probably what I need. This may be water. It's probably the plastic string in the last very long. Anyway. Oh, it's nice relaxing. Well deserved. Good morning. What a beautiful morning. I'm working hard already. I'm going to use the plastic string. I've just literally got another. Oh, too. No, don't blow. My gut. I know it's going to have to pick up all this. Who? You? Okay, I've got to get my breakfast. Can't see the mountain range of the. Beautiful. Okay, that's it. My two babies just wake up. Good morning. You can see she just wake up. Good. Hello. Hello, pretty eyes. Oh, yeah. Still sleepy, daddy? I'm start. Making my breakfast. Tossed, of course. Now we're not going to bite today. Just have a quick look. That's a. Ice-suzu. With GPS. It's nice. Nice. So total price on this one. One point. One point five. Okay. You hear that, guys? And if you get it, there was two, two 40,000 deposit and 25,000 per month. Just dreaming. Different color. I like actually. This is when we finished the house, maybe. And new business going well. Why not? I'm so hot now. We stopped at our favorite food shop. And Boko. Shuty Boko. Food salad. And we all love it. Food salad here. Even Bella, she enjoys so much. We can hear sucking. She didn't stop. So cute. Oh yeah. She got to try to take some food there. Be careful. So hot. So hot. It's crazy. It was better before the learning season. I think it's going to rain again. So now we're going to have a look at the Nissan. Just for fun. That's going to have a table of prices. Yeah, he had Nissan. He's not exactly where we were after. So it's okay. We got some prices anyway. It's so hot. I think we're going home now. Bella, have a great time. Yeah. Now, now stand up. Stand up. Good girl. Stay here. Stay here, my love. Let's go. We're going home now. Let's go. Yeah, guys, I've been trying to purchase styling. But it's not working. I've done maybe 20 times. I always say, payment was not authorized. Although, how this special code you have to... That the banks hand you and put that in. And then this page came up again. With all the blank still to be filled again. And it says payment not authorized. And I've done so many times now funny. So I don't know what to do. We got somebody got the answer here. I don't think it's going to be easy to do the bank. So we'll see what happened. Anyway, if some of you has got an answer or... ...got to do something special here, I'm not sure. It's not working. I can't do any payment. And I look at Google. And a lot of people also had a lot of problem making some payment. I think Elon Musk's got pretty tight. Anti-frored device here. And I don't know. It's a little something not quite right. And he won't accept it. I don't think it's going to be easy to do the bank. But that's my position. So I can't do nothing. I'm not really... I don't know. I may try again tomorrow or another device. I've been trying so many times. I clear the cookies, the history, everything. Still not working. And I don't want to use my international card. It's too expensive. And I think it works. I think the address is going to be related to the card. Whether the card's been issued, I mean, the country. Otherwise, it's going to be even more difficult, I think. So, let's just story. Oh, the first tomato ever! Yes. Yay! Excellent! Jam's so happy! Of course! Yeah. No, my baby! It's beautiful. Oh my God, she loves the water so... And she played with my other phone. It's a mess with this girl. Here we go to a party at Jennifer Royal House. I think you've met them before. They come back from Europe, Netherlands.
