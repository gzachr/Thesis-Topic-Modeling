 Hi guys and welcome back to double the reaction. As our name suggests double the reaction, double reaction. Sort of, we thought we were clever anyway if the title didn't we? Well, it is. We are going to be doing so much more than just reactions. If you are new then you wouldn't have heard this before. So we are going to be doing some cooking. We're going to be doing some reactions, some news, some chit chats, learning languages, games, quizzes, so much. Everything and I'm going to be doing some eating as soon as the money gets around doing some cooking. So keep your recommendations coming. We really enjoy getting around to doing all of them. We stick in with the reactions for the meantime and I keep saying that. But as things change in terms of the lockdown, the food will come. So stay tuned for the food. And games, we haven't had many games or languages or things like that recommended. Quizzies, any questions. So yeah, recommend loads of ones today. Even make your own quiz. Maybe send us your own quiz. And we'll get around to answering your own questions. So like a personal quiz from you guys. That'd be great. And be quite cool. Yeah. But today we are going to be looking at the top 10 Filipino singers who went viral on YouTube. That's a bit of a mouthful. I don't know whether they're going to be famous, whether it's just going to be viral. It's probably how they became famous, I presume, if they went viral on YouTube. Left or right. Also, I just wanted to say a massive thank you to all of you that have subscribed. We didn't expect the channel to do so well so quickly. But if you are new, make sure you subscribe. And if you want to follow us on Instagram, give us any recommendations this way. Yeah, no, I have to start. Yeah, yeah, really, really. I'm going to know what I, is what we're going to do is I'm going to come in and I push your hand on. Okay, ready. I have to jump up. That was good. Right. Are you ready? I'm ready. We're back in the new room today as well. Yeah, I like this room. I can't. Lightens nice. Headphones aren't working. Is that her singing? Yeah. Sounds like Ariana Grande, don't you? Wow. So just this video, she'll work. And I like her college? I'm not sure. She's good though, isn't she? What? What's that? Are you like a queen? Yeah, I think it's at school, not at college. She's really good. She sounds exactly like her. Wow. They can all get such high pitched voices, don't they? What? Hang on, she just got that note. Up here. Up here. It's not even on the screen. Unreal. Yeah. There's low-oskey voice. In the bathroom as well. Everyone sings in the bathroom, aren't they? They're in the shower. Wow. What a dull. So good. How could they do that? That's a good voice. You think this is just filmed on like a phone? No auto tune, nothing. You know what else they've good? They're playing guitar, waxing in like hours, that even buss. I can't play the guitar. I can't play anything musically. But I'm not singing and playing that. So good. We've got their own little way of singing this song. What day? What's your smash hit now? Sitting class again. Everyone loves singing in class. What? How high it is. They can always hit such high notes. Such high notes. There's even a teacher film in. Even a teacher's film in. Everyone's waving. It's so effortless. It's a net. It's literally just filmed from it. Comfortable. In class. Unreal. So good. What? Love that. In the GK. This voice is so good. I love how raw it is. No way. Oh my god, what a little sweetie. He's just in his own moment. Like he doesn't care who's there. He's not watching sort of anything that's going on. He's singing along and attaining everyone on their way to work. Probably on their way to school. So cute. So good. I love it. Love it. Just as people are getting on and everything. So effortless. As he moves about. Is this in class again? Whoa. They love singing in class. Is it, is it, is it, is it. See her sounds just like her. How high they're notes that she can get. The notes are so high. Bum, bum, bum. And then they get embarrassed. Like oh my god, they get embarrassed. They shouldn't get embarrassed. They're so good. It's going to go again. Different song. So good. So good. Go on. Dooh. He's so good. The notes make there, probably giving it that on the table. Love it. I love how natural they all are. No auto tune, no microphone. No fancy camera. So good. Always just vibing. Mm-hmm. It's good. It's so good. Love it. So good. They're picking at the pace up. That's about all I could do. I reckon I could do that on the table. Smashing it. I thought you're there, don't you? Mm-hmm. The world is so sad. Mm-hmm. It doesn't, I don't think he knows he's been filmed. Where he's just chilling there in the restaurant. Probably his family restaurant. I love that. Singing away. Just sitting there and the voice comes out. It's unreal. Imagine you sitting there when you dinner. You could entertain everyone. What? It's so good. And he'd, I generally don't think he thinks he's been filmed. Because you see them zoom in at the start. They're quite far away. What? How does that big voice come out of such a little person? I can't stand. Oh, love it. Good one. Oh, go, is he still going? I've passed out. Mm-hmm. So good. Good task, but. That's how I like one of these. Because they're so natural. It's not in a studio. It's not on that's already famous. This is hopefully that any of these go on so far to become famous. Is it so good? You can see where they went viral. Uh-huh. It's how natural it all is. You can never trust a lot of the famous musicians around the world. They're all so true and everything like that. So good. She likes everyone. And I never lied to you that I was wrong. Oh, been so cut off in my job. You see what's going on, but no, I know. Don't be so confused on my own. So good. Just chill with this one. So chill. Love how he's using the guitar to make the beat as well. He's smashing it. And what they're all attacked clever. So clever. It's like she's mining. Mm-hmm. Because they're like goods. It sounds like something that's been auto tuned. Just gentle in it. I love how it's not like extravagant over the top. She's like a little bit nervous. It makes it so much more natural. Like that could be anyone there singing. That was so good. She was so sweet. Did you, um, did you know any of that then top 10 viral Filipinos? Have you seen them before? Yeah, they were so good. I that was it. The authenticity of it. The fact that it was natural. No auto tune. A lot of it was filmed on a phone. A lot of them were nervous. It was just like it could have been anyone up there singing. And have any of these actually become really famous since? Are they now famous singers? Let us know. That was really interesting. Such good voices. I just love to see people doing what they're good at. And Filipinos love to sing. 80% of Filipinos can sing. I reckon. I reckon 80% and 100% do karaoke. So they learn to sing for me on age. They do. Thanks for recommending these videos. I really like to see different things. We both like to look at different things. That's not the best singer. I'm the best. I'm learning how to sing. You know, I'm never singing but I'm learning. I'm learning as we go. I keep recommendations coming. Remember to comment below or send me over to our Instagram.
