 The coconut nut is a giant nut. Seriously? You eat too much, you get very fat. So we just finished our delicious, looking delicious, right? But in the Philippines, after a meal, you cannot miss this. What is it? What is it? Are you guys really curious? Yes. What I know? It's dessert. I'm so full, but there's the same. There's always room for dessert. One of the desserts we're going to eat is, Hello, hello. Hello. Once you see, dessert, boom. And dessert will be coming. Really? I don't believe it. So let's just say, hello, hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Oh. Hello. Oh. Yeah, see? They came on a mountain. OK, this is called hello, hello. So as you can see, it really looks similar to pizza, to be honest for me. Yeah, it seems like pizza. Right, right. In Thai, it's called Numpang style. Numpang style, right? Ah, it's true. In Burmese, it's called Yigajj. It's interesting that every country in Southeast Asia has something like, it's like, she's like, she's like, oh, whoa, whoa. But, Jay, what is the triple ice cream here? I don't think I've ever seen a triple ice cream. Yeah, a triple ice cream. A triple ice cream. So someone might think this is unappetizing because of the color, but it does look appetizing. It's actually called Ube ice cream. But what is Ube? Ube? You remember, last time, we tried piaya. Inside of piaya, there was Ube. This small thing is called Letcha Fun. And we can just mix it all together, because the name, hello, hello, literally has a meaning of mix, mix. Oh. Mix, mix. Hello, hello. Mm. Mm. Oh, there's so many things at the bottom. Yeah. I, the Thai word, it's like very sweet. It's not as sweet, but it still has other flavors that come in. For me, as a Korean, I was really surprised with the content inside, because there are many things inside here in Talo Halo. Usually, Pingsu has not many content, just like, shaped ice, that's all. It's syrup. It's like very refreshing, no? After a heavy meal, what we just had is really good. Right? We just had Letcha Fun here, right? But we're going to have the original one, the real Letcha Fun right now. Yeah. This is Letcha Fun. So Letcha Fun is actually simple. You know, fun is like, fun is dessert. Like, fun like pudding, one day. Yeah. So Letcha actually needs milk. So Letcha Fun is like literally milk fun. What is fun? Plain is fun is fun. So, plans the name of the dessert. Let's do a caramel. Yeah, this is caramelized. I know. Yeah. For this Talo Halo, you can have it really easily in developing such as, like, fast food restaurant chains, such as Chao King or, like, you know, Guya J, Max. Like, there are other places where you can have Palo Halo easily. Okay, so I said, told you before. So, it's called Letcha Fun. I got to say it's, of course, like, many Filipinos, like, favorite dessert. And of course, it's my favorite Filipino food, Espo. So, it's made of, like, milk and milk, like, egg yolk as well. Oh, it's so rich in flavor. For me, I think this is more like a, having more caramel taste. But personally, I prefer the one having more, like, egg-y. You remember, like, you guys have tried classical restaurant, right? Yeah. The brand is called Goldilocks. And when you go to the Philippines, there's, like, a restaurant. With dessert restaurant, you can buy dessert. It's called Goldilocks. There, you can buy, like, a planet wall. And that Letcha Fun is my favorite. How much is an average, letcha fun? If you go to the rest of the restaurant, it usually costs around 60. So, that means around $1. But if you have, like, you know, just on the street or other, like, cheaper places, of course, it's way cheaper. Really good though. I like, in conclusion, I'm really surprised with the cuisine of Filipino. It's really rich in flavor. And it gets you full, really easy. Last one is called Buko Salad. Coco Salad? Buko Salad. What? Buko actually means coconut. It's actually mainly made with shredded young coconut. Oh. What's the difference between young and old coconut? I have no idea. I have no idea. Is it cold? Is it, like, an ice cream? It's kind of like an ice cream thing, because it's a portion of this area, so that's why. Oh, there's a lot, there's much more things inside here, too. Like, hello, hello, right? Yeah, kind of like, hello. Mmm. Really? Can I try? It's like, yeah, there's, like, similar to, like, a Thai dessert. We also, like, try to use coconut. Oh, sure, okay. We also have coconut, too. But this one is really good. Mmm. Right? Mmm. Oh my god, the taste of coconut is so strong. I love it. I love it. I personally like coconut already. Like coconut juice. And I like to chip the coconut in the coconut. I really love it. So today, starting from Filipino dishes, we finally end up having Filipino desserts, right? Actually, I have a question for you guys. We just had three desserts today, right? Remember first one, what was that? Aloha. Aloha. How was the second one? We did. Linka. Let's have a flat. Yeah, let's have a flat. And how about the third one? Buko salad. Yeah, Buko salad, sure. Yeah, yeah. So my question is, what was your favorite? Buko salad, hands down. Yeah. I like the ketchup man. Oh really? Yeah, I really like it. I think it might possibly be one of my favorite desserts. So next time, please come to the Philippines and I'll treat you to Buko salad every day. Oh, yes. I really want to come to this island. Oh, yeah, please. I hope to meet you guys in the Philippines. OK. I'll say bye in Burmese. Mingla ba da da da. Hongkong mana haf. On behalf of the half.
