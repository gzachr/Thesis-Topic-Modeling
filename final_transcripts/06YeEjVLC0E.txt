 Hey guys and welcome to another video. This one is going to be a little bit different my usual vlogs. So we decided that we're going to try to pronounce Philippine words. We have been in the Philippine piece for a while and we actually didn't learn that many Philippine words. So we really really want to try to learn a little bit more now. This is Fornis trying to pronounce Philippine words. Palam. Ah but there's two A's. Do you think it's like palam? I mean palam sounds really retarded. I think it's not like palam. No. Palam. Palam. Palam. Palam. We got it. We think we got it. How is that? How is that? How is that sounds good to me? It's kind of like Spanish. How is that? Oh how is that? How is that? How is that? In Spanish. Yeah. These letters now make any mistakes so that we can improve. In general just like everything. Everything. Probably way too much work but the worst things. Write them down. So we know that it's really wrong. This one we know because it's when we heard several times. Let's say it together. One two three. Saddle that. So we hope it's right. Yeah. I don't know. Oh oh. Sounds like you're just surprised. It sounds like you're like like how did you forget the keys? Oh oh because like oh yeah. It sounds like it sounds like. I don't know. Hindi. Even cool. Maybe? But I would like to know what it's like I don't know Tagalog. Is it like even cool? Tagalog? Maybe. Even cool Pinoes? You don't know Philippines? How man-hyn? How man-hyn? How man-hyn? I don't know. It depends if you care or not. You ate my chocolate. How man-hyn? Okay I found a way to use one. I have ako-ai Filipino. So oh no no. Ako-ai Filipino. Filipino? It's actually Filipino. Filipino in Tagalog? That's easy. And then I consider maybe I can say ako-ai-ulia. Can't actually say this. Probably. This would be amazing. Ako-ai-ul. So now we know. Ako-ai-ul-nor-veg-yo. No one is just a Spanish like a mixture of Spanish and Vietnamese. Okay this one is really good for me. Magandha-Ako. Excuse me. Grab it. You'll have to say it. Grab it. Anguap-puk-au. That's not even the word. It's like grab it. Anguap-au. Grab it. Anguap-puk-au. Bajala-kasa-bu-hai-mou. It wasn't even mean I could get what I was like criticism. I mean it was just a picture. I mean we have to admit the obviously no we don't know Tagalogs. We just stole a lot of these things from different sources so we don't mean or show up the translations are right right now. So Bajala-kasa-bu-hai-mou. I think that was very good. I think that was a little Spanish accent. I think that was a little Spanish accent. Bumitab. Okay I'm sorry I have to read it again. Bumitab. Bumitab. Dikuna-fazhat-ako. Yeah. Bumitab. Just the pronunciation. It can't be right. I will have to say it. Dikuna-baba-la-galo. I'm wondering why you were taking a like Anguab-au-banyo? Banyo. It's Anguab-au. Ah. Anguab-au. I like that. That's so cool. That's what I looked at. There was like a one syllable conversation you can have in the Philippines. Which is just... No. Okay once again. So I was like for example if you go to the elevator and it opens and you can ask if it's going down. It's like going down. Going down. Nice. What does it mean? It seems to be a port word. Aoko. Aung-kigas. Ulo-mo. Aung-kigas. Aung-kigas. Simani ang pang. Simani ang pangbangang snow. Jesus. Simani ang pangbangang kamao. If any of these by don't make sense at all. Let us know and then we can play our sources. Kal-lang naman. Ako-sash-yue. No. Of course. I like that. Dala-lang naman ako-sash-yue. Everyone has to go like yue. Pina-pah-hina. Pina-pah-hina. Pina-pah-hina. Pina-pah-hina. Pina-pah-hina. That's what I said. It's really high-excuse. Pina-pah-hina-pang-wo-a-ko. Okay. I want to play again. What's that? Pina-pah-hina-pah-hina moa-ko. Oh no, that is the next thing. Hahaha. Julia. Pina-pah-hina moa-ko. No, I've never seen that before. Kal-lang naman pah-bang-sa-gutin-ya. Wow. This is a cool accent. It's a little wrong accent. Kal-lang naman pah-bah-hno. Yeah, Kal-lang naman. Yeah. Pina-pah-hina-pah-hina moa-ko. Paraka-yang naman-gah-biheng-nan-ina. Paraka-yang naman-gah-biheng. Nanini-mala. Oh, it's a bit vulgar. It's easy. Paraka-yang naman-gah-biheng-nanini-vala-sa-pak-ibig-n-is-an-put-a. Good. Paraka-sina-sabi-molan-yan-kasi-las-eng-no. You deserve that. That's right. Paraka-sina-sabi-molan-yan-kasi-las-eng-no-ako-na-ako. Lesson. Or the sing-no. Paraka-sina-sabi-molan-yan-kasi-las-eng-na-ako-at-zaka-las-eng-kan-arina. So this is our last section. We're going to go through all of us the hardest chocolate words. So we're going to try to pronounce those. Oh, my God. It's a quite challenging, yeah. Yvina-gah-no. Yvina-gah-y-y-y.
