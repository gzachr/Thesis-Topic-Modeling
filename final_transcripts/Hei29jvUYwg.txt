 The Philippines homeless some of the most beautiful islands in the world and some of the most amazing food and culture you'll ever experience. It's also home to the most friendly, humble, Filipino people that live day by day with smile on their faces regardless of the challenges they make face. As a Filipino American, they grew up in the USA. I wanted to humble myself and experience what life is like living like a Filipino in poverty. The goal is one month living in the Philippines province on a 200-pacel with day budget, which is $4 USD. I must live like a Filipino who expands every day just like my ancestors who still live and still live into this day. So join me on this new journey of becoming a true Filipino. Pyramid. The Philippines. Good morning guys from the Philippines. So this is the first experience in this tent and I'm going to be honest with you guys, it was extremely hot. How was that experience? Super. It's quite cold. Night time is cold but once you wake up you feel that heat, like immediately how woke up sweating. That's why I got no shirt and everything. Is day one completed? What do you rate that out of 10? I think that I rate it as 7. Yeah, we're going to get the day started today. First things first is we're going to take a shower. I'm going to show you how to take a traditional Filipino shower. Something humans have promised us. Okay, I've lost a vacation now. That we ordered some安保不公 desire market. Was it safe to take one shower then take another shower? My mom's taking water. All right guys, so this is how you take a Filipino shower. What is this called? I forgot. Tabo. Tabo? So you basically just scoop the water up. You have your soap, your shampoo, and you're just going to take a shower back. I guess so. We're going to show you an example. All right guys, so now we're going to use the shampoo. The good thing about the Philippines is they got like these individual packs. If you're on a budget, you could just buy these. I believe these are like five pesos. No, it's like eight. Eight pesos each or for the whole thing. For the whole thing. Eight pesos and you get one, two, three showers. So let's use one. Just pop it open like that. And then pour it in. We use them palm olives. What is this palm olives? No, it's not so. Shit, it don't matter to me. I just use them. But yeah, you get a lot of shampoo. This is going to last you one day. That's good. It's really easy doing this. This is humbling. It's a humbling experience to do this. But this ain't nothing bro. If you think this is crazy to do, it's like, you know, you got to understand. I've been in way with words situations. I haven't had a lot. So yeah, make sure you guys scrub good. Because it's super hot in the Philippines. That's how you take a traditional Philippine shower. Philippine with shower. What the hell is this? What the hell is this? What the hell is this?

Schedule, let's put the onion. It's more of a... The best part. Well, flavor is that. That's the chili. It's the lemon seed. They don't have the sweetens. Sweetens. That's... That one is sweet too. It looks like a ball. Can I see that? Yes, you know. It's got oil, soy sauce, seasoning. Oh, show me. Where is it? Put it here. Oh. Alright, so once that's done boiling, then we're going to show you guys what you've got to do next. Put. Put the lid on. I need the... It does to the soft. Yeah, once it's done soft. I'll let it up here. Just... Let's see. And then let's see your noodles. It's almost done. It is half illipid, no check, they're noodles. I would check it's hot. Oh, shit. I think it's good.

We will be done on our... As a decent happen. Give us a day or a day of food. Our daily food and forgive us our sins. We forgive those sins again since. We're going to bring us the temptation to deliver us our kingdom. Lord bless this food that we're about to eat. We thank you so much for this another day. To keep us going with this journey. Please look after us. And bless our animals too. And continue giving us blessings so we can buy them more food for them. And we thank you so much Lord. Just name my prayer, Amen. Real quick, I want to pray for the person watching this too. I pray that Jesus touches you and I pray that you come closer to a relationship with God. And Jesus name my prayer, Amen. Alright, let's try this food. I'm not giving this to you. Try it now. We need to buy some forks. We don't even use forks. Yeah, there we go, first bite. Okay, the sandwich. Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. Try it now. Let's fire. So the goal is to eat like a Filipino. To be honest guys, like, if this is even like a Filipino, I'm not mad. This meal costs 110 pesos. Who are you winning? This meal costs 110 pesos. And that's like $2.20 and it feeds two people perfectly. This is actually more than food too. It's just about being thankful for what you have. You know, growing up in the USA, a lot of people are spoiled because they get to decide what they want to eat every day. But people would know, you know, with limited money, it's like they wake up and they just eat what they have. That's the thing I'm trying to prove here. Eating what you have and just being satisfied with it, because you gotta be as thankful as possible. This meal right here, $2.20 and this is delicious. I could probably eat this every day. It's not healthy, but like I said, I'm not gonna complain about this. You got the water from? Boy, winning. You can't eat this. No. But yeah, this meal definitely gonna fill you up. And what time is it? It's 5 p.m. It's 5 p.m. This is the first meal I had, we both had today. Yeah, we've fasted for a long time. Yeah, you've been fasting so I'm not mad at this too. These damn dogs. Is it a cut? The cats there, I might have to spray them. I'm gonna spray them now. They're still stuck. All right, they're good. All right, come back here. No, I gotta ask you a question. Give me more pants at camp. All right, I'll ask you a question. So how was your life growing up in the Philippines? Like, was it good? What are you making? What was your life like? Like your child? What was it good? Were you a rich kid? A bro? Not really. A little milk eyes? Yeah, a little milk eyes. So what was your childhood growing up? How was it? Here you were more? No, I didn't. It was good growing up in a big family. That's all loaded, you know? Total loaded. I don't wanna do this. We can't hear you. I don't wanna... Where are you interviewing me in this dish meal? Because you gotta be thankful. I just wanna know how your life is. I mean, it's simple. We had our food everyday. So what was the normal things you used to eat? Back then. Hard dog. Hard dog to see no... Long and nice. Those are my favorite bad men. And then... My mom always makes a go-go and... Pansi canton. I pansi canton. I mean, pansi canton mixed with real pansi, you know? That tin ones. Yeah, so they... Mix it with the real pansi canton is good. So did you guys have like... A lot of food growing up or is it just like one meal? And I see it. Mmm. I think we had like... Two meals. Like two different meals in the day. It's like more than anything. Were you satisfied every night? Or some days you went to bed hungry? No, we went to hungry. I never really slept hungry before when I was a kid. So compare that to like... Like... I don't know. You were satisfied with life basically. Like you loved your childhood. Yeah, I was content. Okay. We always eat something. Have you ever tried eating rice with the milk? No. Milk powder. I thought you said you would never hungry. You're eating rice with milk? Yeah, I'm eating something. How are you all? I still have food for us, but then. So... Did you ever have cravings like every time you ate rice with milk? Was it like... Now I want to jolly beer something? I never craved before. I never really craved about them until I got older. No, I know what craving is. So now you're a little spoiled. Like you... You don't go back to your old ways. I have no. I still eat shit. So you could eat rice with milk? Well, I don't like that no more. I also like this when I was a kid. But no, I don't like the flavor. Hmm. Well... I'm just trying to tell you why. As long as you got food in your stomach, it really don't matter. Like, it really don't matter. As long as you're satisfied, that's what matters. So we're supposed to spend 200 to day. So we got 80 pesos left. We might not even use it. We're only 90 left for our budget. We can buy food later if I still want. I don't think I will eat later. Well, that's what I'm saying. Even if we don't spend the 200, 110 pesos for the whole day. And we're already full. I'm not going to need to diet or so fast. Yeah, diet is key too for this journey. I want to lose some weight during this journey too, but... Who knows? Maybe I'll just... You still have to lose weight for your health. That's true. You gotta take care of your body. That's another reason I'm doing this journey. When you have privileges and stuff like that, you don't really think about your health. You're playing video games, you're playing, you know. Whatever you're playing, whatever you're doing. Jimmy, you were unknown. You eat what you want all the time. You always eat a lot. Mm-hmm. That's why we're doing this journey. Move. Look at the water, no? Done, done. I'm doing it. And this is very important too. Drink water. Cut out all that soda, cut out all that juice. I'm not really a juice. I don't really drink juice like that. Me too. I'm not that chicken alive. I don't really drink juice. Even soda, I'm ready to drink water. That's what it is. Winnie. No, are you just eating? I was gonna give that to you. All right guys. I'm rating that Ponce can't sober meal. Which you rated? The tuna sandwich, I gotta give that a six. But, like, I can eat that every day. It's not the best tasting. It gets the job done on full. That's what it is. Five out of 10 tuna sandwich? I like it. I don't really like it, but. Ponce can't sober. Which you rate that? Six. Six, I'll give that 7.5. That was good. I like that, they're favorite one. It's within this spicy. Maybe we'll try that one next time. Yeah, that's it for today's video guys. Probably gonna pack this up. Give me water please. Why are you sitting down? It's like we're... We're doing a sinking. Tomorrow, we're gonna... What are we gonna do tomorrow? I think we should try a barbecue. Like, campfire? Yeah. You gonna buy barbecue? Yeah, we'll buy barbecue and then we'll do our own campfire. And then, yeah. So stay tuned for next vlog tomorrow. 30 days guys, 30 days in this tent. So, hopefully you guys join me. I appreciate you guys for watching. Subscribe for more. And I'm out. Peace.
