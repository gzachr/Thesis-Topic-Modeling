Going to the list of one and then trying to give us a little breakfast as well. Bread, egg, eggs, sausages, and some local food as well. And he's a little room to a couple of one there, couple of two of them there. Pea down here. And the view out there. You are all right, just wanted to try it in. There he is. Is that joy? Alright, we've got some light flying. The problem is whether we're here to use the bread for you. How are you? Are you ready to reverse it? Yes, welcome to Aventus! Welcome to Aventus! Look at his camera left! Look at your camera left! Look at you. That's a distance it's pretty nice, isn't it? It's pretty good, isn't it? Where does that mean? If you Ramen It's against humour I'm going to take you home. I'm going to grab you home. No! No! You're going to be good. You're going to be good. You're going to be good. It's all safe. There's some things that change. I couldn't stop and say hello. What's happening? These guys have been around. They don't even bother to drop by Perthagalera. It's the nearest. We're here. Are you guys staying? We've got an A B and B close by. Do you know how we can get to White Beach? White sun beach? First you have to go to White Beach. First you have to go to White Beach. First you have to go down your car. Of course. The very first beach is here. That's White Beach. Can we pass? This is ours. It's great that you guys are here. Thank you. Good to be here. You're new people. Thank you. So here we are going to the White Beach. We're going to walk into a sketchy way to get there. Some locals recognize Nilly and Mike. So we're going the normal way. Normal way. Is the VMware doing professionally today? Ready to go near White Beach. It's apparently pretty good. I'm gonna give it a go. It's a lot of BSO. Check it after the drone though. Drone fest then put the beer away in the end. I'm gonna give it a go. I'm gonna give it a go. We are at the White Scent Beach. I'm walking around seeing if there's any cool photo opportunities. And then we're gonna go eat. So we have some fresh cold fish here. Look at that. Yum! It's really like a throwing it away. Me, me, me, me. Me, me, me, me. This is actually the first time really we've been together. We haven't been here hardly together. The first time we went to the Philippines together was when Mitch was coming to here to play football. Yeah to play sport in Angela City, right? I'm so glad we got a chance to go and discover this. Yeah so it's pretty weird. We've been to the Philippines many times. But it's actually the real time traveling together. Thanks to Mike and Nelly. Otherwise, yeah, it would have been probably somewhere else. Yeah, not here. Not here. I'd rather be here. And I think I got Mosquitoes bite. Oh my god. I'm trying. It's a drone. The Mosquitoes bite for sure though. Oh my god. Can you hold the camera? Because I'm gonna... For the edge. Ooh! Nice. Can you bite? Yeah. Can I try again? Perfect time to be here. After spending most of our afternoon at White Sand Beach, where we met some really cool locals and had some amazing food. We decided to go for a little bit of a sunset hike. We're trying to find the windmills. Now we haven't found them just yet. Well they're there. We don't know how to get to them just yet. But right now we've got some incredible views. We're gonna take some shots of. Have a look at this. Yep, Mike is gonna launch the journey. He's over there. We're gonna see some beautiful shots. By Mike now. Now. I know everyone's on their cameras. Come on now. You can do it. Throw it. Yeah. We're doing a little turn-lapse with this by-moo. Ready? Let's see how that goes. Look at the beautiful sun. Alright, so looking pretty. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.
