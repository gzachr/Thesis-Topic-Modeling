 That is one of the most dangerous spiders. You will die in a few hours if this thing bites you. Mick Mick where are you bro? This is a fearless and far thing. I am going to go to the next one. I am going to go to the next one. I am going to go to the next one. I am going to go to the next one. I am going to go to the next one. I am going to go to the next one. I am going to go to the next one. I am going to go to the next one. I am going to go to the next one. I am going to go to the next one. I am going to go to the next one. I am going to go to the next one. I am going to go to the next one. I am going to go to the next one. That is a really nice infinity triple swimming pool. Oh, we are glad. Randy season in the Philippines. Welcome to Samar on the national park. 335,100 hectares. Beautiful forest right here in the middle of Samar. I am in Paralat for a hunt us. I have been here many times before doing the torpedo boating. But today it is a little bit different. I just had a chat with other locals about the community sustainable tourism here. I am going to go check something else out here that I have never seen before. I am going to show you. I am going to get out of the rain. That is a... Run! I am going to go to the next one. I have been a little bit of a problem right now. I was going to go to the Eco Trail but I don't know if that is going to be possible. It might just be the Bassa Trail. Superland. Iris. Yes. Okay. It has been raining so much. So before we try to go on the Eco Trail and with Mum Iris, she is going to show us. You can actually stay at the national park. There are two styles of rooms. There is a dormitory. And then a private. We are going to check the dormitory first. This is really cool. I didn't even know this existed. This is the good for now. And then there is a good for five. Oh, this is a private room? No, no. It is a private room. Half private. Five bedrooms. Cool. Look at this. Imagine you leave your room. I want to go swimming in the jungle. Look at this. Wow. I feel like you have come here already. No, I don't know why I never stopped here. Why? I am crazy. I have been here so many times. I never came up. Literally it is on the main road. That is the main road next to the swimming pool. The friends are 150 pesos per person for a bed in the dorm. Or get your own private room for 100 or 1500. Look at this pool. It is incredible. There are three pools. This one is the outdoor. And then there is a jacuzzi pool. And then the last one is the children's pool. There is a jacuzzi pool. Oh, yes. Wow. I am officially mind blown. That is a beautiful pool. That is an incredible view right along the Ola River. Why have I not stayed here yet? I don't know. But I will definitely be coming back again to stay in this place. There is an eagle trail down to the left. We are going to head to that in a second. I am going to tell you a bit more about this. If you didn't know the Ola River, like I have said before, it is now a river that they do torpedo boating. But the boat drivers and the torpedo boats used to be used for legal logging. But because of ecotourism, now it is turned into a tourist site and the legal logging s2 is used to exist. So it doesn't really happen anymore. And then it started to do simple little changes to the area to make it even more friendly for ecotourism. So this is clearly one of them, an amazing pool and rooms you can stay in. And then the cool part again, the ecotouril, I don't know, nothing about it. We are going to go check it out. Before that, I tell you, can you do this? Is that for real? This is for real. This one? No, not this one. So I can just bite this. Oh yes! Okay, I can just pick all of us from the deck. Oh, that is so good! Oh look at this! Dude, good morning. It is really good to get one. Oh delicious! I am just taking pictures of the jungle in Samar. And the clear of a pool. I just go to the ecotouril. Wow! Wait for me to go to the waterway. Wait for me to go to the waterway. Oh! We can't let this go. We can't let this go. We can't let this go. We can't let this go. This is Elizabeth. She is a local here. She is working here at the ecotrail. This, the bridge just happened. Just opened, no? In August? Yes, August 7th. Ah, amazing! So this activity, this is right near the torpedo boarding is. And you'll notice actually everyone who is working here in Oba'i, no? Yes. Oba'i says this is managed by some of the local ladies. And I think, you have a minute or two or more. It depends on the time, about 1 kilometer, almost 1 kilometer of the trail, depending on the time, about 1 hour or less. We'll be able to get to station 5. I think other stations, we have five stations. We have five stations. And every station, we can get to the waterway. And station 1 and 2 and 5, we can get to the waterway. So this is amazing. There's a place you can stay here. Right next to the ecotrail, we're going to check with the ecotrail. It's all locally run. Very much another cool kind of side activity you can do from the torpedo boat. So, it's a good guy. I'll just follow you really easily. Okay, so, we're going to go to the bathroom. Yes, the shower. Is this the best here? Yes, the tap water. Yes, very good, but it's a little bit dry. Wow, very cool. Blade? No. You can't eat it, no? No. Thank you, bar try it. That's called Cat Moon. Cat Moon is really used to cook making sour. So, don't eat it. I'll give you a little bit of salt, but those were cut, very easily, it is a good time to do something actually of walking. No, it means very tiring to climb. Ah, very tiring to climb up. Up there. Up there. I was close. And then? Oh, the restaurant is challenging me now. Perro, last stack of a pager de masasawala. So, but you'll be, we'll all be tired if we don't. No, no. The worst is loving of me. I know. Must tiring you, I know. And by humasa? You both? Oh yeah, I know. I knew that one. Nothing. I get it. I get it. I get it. I failed. Who is the last one? I wonder, do you have? So, you brought in all of this stuff. Yes, the third pair of members. Boys. Yes, they carry this stuff. Up here. Really? Oh. Very heavy. Yeah, looks heavy. Geez. Nice to walk on though. This is very easy to walk on. Very cool. Like, look at the dense forest. It's amazing. I really love community projects like this. Okay. Focus on the forest. That's a really wonderful. You guys have really built something amazing in this bit. This is the organic garden hangout here in the middle of the National Park Forest. Good. Go ahead and see how my mom made this. Oh, you got even the red bell peppers. See you, Tao. Catch you. Brad, let's go. Go away. Brad, come on. Go away. Leave the Filipino. Brad. I'm in my own country. Come on. Go. Samok. Okay. What's going on? This is called Payau. This is very useful for the men. Why? Because I know my loss loss. I just got an appointment with the woman. And then, I'll get the treatment. That's it. If you're going to get a car, you can get an airplane. The loss of time before the rain. And then, I'll get a ticket. This is not the only thing. The only thing after that is the rain. Okay. Very effective. All right. Now we know. I guess we can go Brad. I don't see a glistula just a day ago. In case you're wondering what we just talked about, if you have a sickness on your balls, that is the leaf you need. That is all. Everything you need in the forest. That is insane. So, we just climbed in there. I am very, very short movie. I'm really lucky. This is not a lot. This is a very dangerous spider. This bit me, Patai. Yes, yes. So, we'll make this feel short. We'll make it feel short. We'll make it feel short. We'll make it feel short. We'll make it feel short. We'll make it feel short. We'll make it feel short. Mick Mick, where are you bro? This is a fearless and far thing. Unbelievable. I'm very sorry. They live underneath. They live in different vegetation. It's lucky. It just jumped into that sign somehow. Mind blowing. Okay, then, bro. Oh, not bro. It's Elizabeth. Let's go back to the trip. Station 4. Coming up. Love you, Dad. Beautiful. That's awesome. Top of the jungle. Nice, son. Right. Good job. Top of the jungle. Nice, son. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. Good job. What do you say? This is... ...by ever bringing anybody to do torpedo boating. They're coming here. They're doing this. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Absolutely blown away. This is so cool. There's actually a fifth station higher up, but I've decided that I'm not going to do it today. I'm going to come back with friends. It gives me reason to find out what is up there. The secret of station 5. Next time. All right. It's head back. It's a food. Samaritan National Park. Horanas. So back in the day, imagine this too. When they were doing illegal timber poaching here. They'd maybe make 200 pesos in a day, trekking through the jungle, carrying lumber for four to five hours. That's... ...cheese. Now these people are making a great livelihood doing something positive for the environment around them. You guys are off. That's awesome. I had to put that on before finishing and going to eat because it's just so heartwarming. It's exactly the kind of tourism that not only is beautiful for the client us, but it's something that is beautiful for everything around us. That's what I'm going to do. Come to Samaritan. Do it now. Seriously. I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat.

Is there any other one? Oh, maybe? Maybe. Maybe.
