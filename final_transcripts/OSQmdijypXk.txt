Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Lord Jesus, we thank you Lord that you've really blessed us with so much. And we have so much to be thankful for Lord this house, my family, my job, this country, the freedom that we have here to worship you and spirit and in truth. Lord, I just never want to take for granted your word. You've given us your word to really give us a map, Lord, a standard by which we are to judge all things. And Lord, you make it very clear what you require of us Lord. Just a repent of our sins and place all of our faith and trust in you Lord. So I just thank you Lord for that. It's so practical that we could apply it to every area of our lives Lord, no matter how young or old we are. It is just absolutely timeless and it traverses culture and age and it is the eternal word of God. You say heaven and earth will pass away but your word will never pass away and we thank you Lord for your word. We ask Lord that you would apply it to our hearts by your spirit and may he be our teacher tonight. We love you Lord. We pray this in your name. Amen. Amen. Amen. Let's start. Keep going. But you're not meant to struggle forever. We're supposed to live with Toreacy. We can help you overcome that. If you think that you can overcome your hang-ups, like picking yourself up by your own bootstraps, it doesn't work. Jesus is the one who gives us the victory. We have the victory through our word Jesus Christ. So just as you trusted Jesus for your salvation, trust Jesus in your everyday walk with Him. You hasn't left this is a lot of things. Remember, He's given us His Holy Spirit. I've heard a lot of things. And that you'll be with us every step of the way Lord. Help us to stand for what's right and what's right and not to lay down Lord. Help us to really resist the evil one. Lord, we know that. There's a lot of opposition out there. There's the world, the flesh and the devil. But we thank you Lord that you give us the victory. So Lord, help us to rely on your strength. And not on our strength. Lord, we may be disciplined. We may memorize the Bible Lord. But help us remember. Or to forget we are to rely on you. On you to give us through this life. And to do what you have us to do while we're here. So Lord, we love you. And we pray all these things of Jesus name and word and we pray for Charles. But is it feeling good? The outstored that you are healing him. The outstored that you do with Matt. That you also feel him. If anybody that isn't feeling well, Larry. I'm just healed. Everybody Lord who is going through some kind of ailment. And I'll just get back on their feet.
