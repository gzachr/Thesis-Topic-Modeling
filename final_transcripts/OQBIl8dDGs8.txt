 Hey good morning, it's still raining. I'm grass cutting and forwardly. Anyway we invited to a Christmas party today. That's it, let's enjoy. Okay we invited to get together for Christmas. This is Crabbis and I think you just lay around. Well it's not very nice, it's bad. So come with us and enjoy. The road has been very flooded, the grandma let you go grandma. So I didn't use a crush on me. It's a terrible weather but we know we've got a typhoon hanging around on the east coast of in the now. Lucky. We're going to West Coast. So we only get ready here. We waited for our friends to pick us up here. Oh we meet here actually. There's a lot of people running so much, it's so flooded up there and the road I think you can see that. So I'm not sure if we can stay very long time because on the way back it's going to be loaded. Yeah have you river crossed to our home and for a day won't be able to stay very long time because it's going to get flooded. It's not like I get really bad. Okay for that here, we're going to follow you down. Oh what a weather. Oh we've been greeted by the show legs. We have many dogs. Well come let's have one of them she loves animals. Yeah they never seen us that's why they like this. Oh my god. I'm going to take my hairy edge out. Oh that's a small kitchen. Wow that's better. Now we can talk. Hey come here. It's okay. We're still alive. Okay it's okay. It's okay. Of course you're going to watch TV. Oh lunch is ready guys we look at this. This is wonderful. What is this? This is pork ribs. Pork ribs. I wanted to go and die. Chicken looks beautiful. Wow. It's around Christmas. We have to eat. You're going to clean this house now? No. Oh nice pants. Are we still eating now? Maybe J.M. No I don't know the fish. No I can't see. Fish for the two. Wow the fish is good. Maybe it's Filipino but I don't know that. No that's it. Yeah. How you call it? We call it Pipina in Filipino. I don't know what's the English name. Pipina? No. It looks like a dinosaur fish. Are you hungry? No. The mommy shows. You can't wait them. It's fine because they have blood. They will talk to our blood. It looks good. Mango. Love it. I'm going to have some then Jun. I'm going to have some then and, potato. Haha. Then I'm always taking that part after lunch, and we choose, so we are going upstairs having this Japanese. You can see the weather起來 in a very nice way with the raining. It's okay, we're eating. I have one. No dice for a couple of weeks I think. We get back to die after festivities. I can't believe it. I'm scared. It's nice. What is it? Mango. Mango. Mango, eat it. I can't believe it. It's dry. I can't believe it. I can't believe it. It's so dry. Is this a piece of meat? I think it's very thick. I think it's very thick. I think it's very thick. I think it's very thick. Hello, you gave me the baby. Photo. Like that. Photo. Wow. Why? Did someone ask us to send them the pictures in the videos? We do. Bond picture of Henry Curtis Gardener. It's four- estiver, says 3 and 4. It is one- Mediterranean, around 21. Subaw much less western. Mori Realfe. Ja? Why are you excited? He proposed me. No, not to sleep. No, it's okay. It's going to be better than... Oh my God. She has to touch everything. It's my day. It's my day. It's super full. Too much. I really want you to come to us. It's kind of a smart thing to see it from here. Wow. Let me have a look. Dad is going to show me his water pressure system in the house. I'm about to do mine. That's a good tank. 20 year old. This one must have a bladder. How many horsepower? One horsepower only. You said the pressure will spring there. That's probably what I have to do. Maybe just make the lowest pressure possible. It comes on at 20-27 pressure or something and then goes off at 35. We have lots of water pressure. No problem. Small bladder tank. 20 year old pot. I need to build the protection from the rain. That too. I agree with him. The kids doesn't come here. It was like that. That's good. Here's where the water goes. This is your... The water comes from... The water must come from here because this is the well water. Oh, is that the water comes from? That's from the well. Let's go through here. This one is open. This one goes in here. You want to come from the well? This is the well water. The black hose. Do you have a filter? No. I don't think there's a filter. Then we have clean water by the way. The water is... The city water we had in Polonco. We had city waters. Polonco with... Problems. Yeah, depending on what they get it from. Yellow, laundry, everything. That's good. This water is clean. Oh, concrete. It's on the base. I don't know enough about exactly where the system is. But I'm thinking that it comes from the well. It goes to here. Must be pressurized in here with a bladder tank. And then comes back out again. Oh, well, here's the pump. That's the water pump side. So it must be coming in from here. Now it can't be because this is the well water. This is the well water, the black hose. This is the inside pressure. You'll think it's from the tank. It's coming from the tank. And then it goes here. So there's two sides from the tank. That's what I was asking you the question about this. Because you got another inlet there. And I agree. I don't know if the answer is. Okay. That's all right. Maybe one of your subscribers. No worries. Okay, good. The first thing I saw was when I got the place. I said, this is not right. That's good. But it's been going for 20 years. The house was doing it for 20 years. Yeah. Regional pump. No, very good. All right. It must be pretty good. But I noticed all bladder. Yeah, bladder. Yeah. This one says water. I think those are two key. Excellent. No problem. Oh, interesting. Your pressure switch is built. It's installed here. What is that pressure? Man is installed under tank. Okay. I guess you should do the same thing. I don't know. That's interesting. That's why I wanted you to look at this thing. I'm going to ask my viewer what they think about that. Yeah, I get an opinion. Where is everybody? Here, here. Here. Here. Here. Yeah. You're into being used. Out toilet. No, no. Oh, that looks familiar. It's you. They're always playing. Who's this guy? He's always watching you. Yeah. He's always watching. Oh, my God. Be there. Oh, be there. Who's that thing in? I don't know. Who's that every day? Yeah, working hard now. That looks familiar. You don't know what I'm getting on my meds, you know? Have you ever seen the film, We Know More? I've never seen the film, We Know More. It's a walk around in suit. There's the white shirts. Yeah. We're now in a sequo city they had. It's too high. It's a bit of an activity to battle. Now, jump on the bed. Remember, monkey jump on the bed. You are great. Stuck in this. Is that daddy? It's just like that. Daddy? Yeah. Oh, no. I'm going to finish this guy. Please. I'm having a second lunch. And have a coffee. Thank you. Thank you. You try the coffee. Thank you. It's special coffee. They're last taking her diaper off. We don't know why. What's your one thing to do? Photo session. Let's try it. Let's go. It hasn't stopped raining so we're going to go home. It must be flooded anyway. It's dangerous. Let's go now. I know. I can do it. Thank you. I want to do it. It's been free now. I'm not going to. I'm going to take good care of you. Fish, maybe the head or something. You give. I'm going to take it. Let's see if we can go home. The foot was absolutely fantastic. No, no. Oh, exactly. What can we do? How are we going to drive for a couple of weeks? Then we go back to the Yiskelle City. Left. Left.
