 Hi guys welcome back to another juicy VR. Today we have Philippines won the World Travel Awards. Congratulations and Maboo High. Where was this? I don't know. I don't know. As always guys, we don't watch these videos before and I would kind of defeat the point of reaction to them in filming these videos. Well I would have already watched it but we wanted to show you guys. But you can just watch a small version of it. Yeah, if you're new around here, please do send us your reaction requests. That's where we get all these videos from for this channel on Instagram. I should pop up here if not the handles for Instagram are in the description of this video. And if you are also new around here please hit that subscribe button. And that really happens out. We're on road to 300 feet. Don't kick your ass like that. Freaks me out. I'm excited for this one because we haven't been able to travel much of the Philippines this year or last year. And this year. So hopefully it's going to be a little bit traveling this little bit of some nice stuff. Yeah. So let's see what this is all about. Cool, ready? Three, two, one. I can't bear. You're welcome. I've never heard of the world travel awards by the way. Same. Anything want it? Hello and welcome to the 2020 edition of the world travel of water. Australia? Yeah, it's trying to get a lot of dirty tape. Oh, dirty tape. A very glamorous tape. Because those teeth line me. The world's fairs is the more expensive. Right, are they my future? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. 12 people say it wasn't it? Tourism. Over the course of the year. Tourism consumers, industry professionals and the international media have been voting in record numbers for their favorite travel brands and her voice is great. Actually, I'm happy. I was a few. We're global travel and tourism. Once again, takes center stage. Winning a world travel award this year has become more important than ever before. So it wasn't 20-30 that 30s. They're booking the very best. And the best of the best. This year's winners of the 2020 world travel awards or the voting we've had now come to I suppose. I love this. That's been counted. And the winners chosen for the 27th annual world travel awards. She's making me so excited. And we already know. I don't know. She's making me excited. I wonder who was in it. And I was for Asia's leading beach destination and Asia's leading die destination as well. I don't know. Surely they'll say well. All of them. Philippines and the Philippines to come. Wow. Leading tourist board to come to the Philippines. This is Bernadette Ramalokuyab. I think I've fallen right on Instagram. Through the Philippines, the part that of the reason. Thank you very much for honoring our beautiful island nation with three world travel awards. That's awesome. I said it in the recent reaction video. If we didn't do this channel and watch these videos, I wouldn't have known that. I didn't know about this. And Asia's leading die destination. Wow. I kind of feel proud. And that's not my home country because we spend so much time in it. I'd like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to everyone who voted for us in these categories. Thank you to all our. Think about now how many more people want to come here. This is like well-known news. Especially when travel opens up. People need to be so eager to come here. Yeah. Efficiently and successfully. And to the world travel awards for recognizing our outstanding beaches and awarding the breathtaking beauty of our dive sites. Thank you and good life. Congratulations to our 2020 winners. Is that it? Is that the real awards? No, no, no. And Philippine has got all of them. Yeah. So cool. And that's it. And taking all three awards is the Philippines. That's like what's this? Where we're going now, Kate Jensen. Where you're taking us, Kate? Oh, some crazy terribly blurry photos of the Philippines by the way. It's a bit of a Rizal Park. Yeah. Entity Kingdom. I feel like this is the person who made this video. Not the award. The audience. Yeah. Let us actually skip through because I think that's it. I think that's actually right. So there's some island stuff. Okay, guys, the rest of the video is just photos of the Philippines which is cool but they're all a little bit blurry. They're all a little bit sideways. You can watch our vlogs to see better. There's actually interesting transitions on this. But we're all stopping there. Congratulations, Philippines. I had no idea that those awards have been won. That's awesome. That's great news. We totally, totally agree that Philippines should have the travel awards. We made our own... Constantly. Oh my God. Yeah, so about that. We made our own tourism ad. And Lucy made it. Yeah, called Imagine the Philippines. And it was all footage from our vlogs. Yeah. Because we watched the... Imagine, no, what was it? Wake up in the Philippines, Tourism Ad. We've been to all these places. We have this footage. We can do our version as people that are from the Philippines. People from like outsiders that have travelled it on our own. And we wrote the scripts. And I did the voiceover for it. And it kind of encompasses how we feel about the country. Yeah. Perfect. Yeah. If anyone's like, oh, what do you think of the Philippines? Send them the link to that video, because that's exactly the same. That's true. And if you're on New Year's Eve here, we live in Manila. Yes. We're in Metra Manila right now. What's that? Just a little bit of skyline. And we spent the end of 18, most of 2019. And so far we've been here in 2021. Oh, I'm 20. So over four years now. Blind me. Over four years. Yeah. Not over four years. Over four years. Over the course. Over four years. And we've been in the Philippines in four different years. Tundra travel vlogs on another channel.
