 I'll never go with the wind Just let it flow, let it take me where it wants to go Till you open the door, and there's so much more I've never seen it before, I was trying to fly But I couldn't find a way But you came alone and you changed everything You lift my feet up the ground You spin me around, you make me crazy I'm having a time on my life And take a photograph I don't wanna leave this behind This scene is so right of reach The hole there right in our hands Let's give up everything Let's jump in and never look back Let's jump in and never look back This is all I ever wanted but I got it my way You're all I ever wanted I knew it's you it could change There's something worth missing until today The city comes alive As soon as you walk through the door Now the sleep is night But I don't wanna sleep anymore Don't wanna sleep anymore This is all I ever wanted but I got it my way You're all I ever wanted I didn't see how it could change There's something worth missing until today I'm in so high just don't look down We can see everything from here What's in my life? Be up the ground
