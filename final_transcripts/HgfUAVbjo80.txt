No, they're really good with my little fries. I'm scared. Because I don't really like like fish fish. You got... I don't know. These are good. They're not like... They're not too fishy. For me, they were... I like this. No, that's really good. It's very chocolatey. Yeah, I like it. So does this go in the mouth? Yes. This tastes like um... Americans. This right here... It tastes like... The turtles. You don't think about? You ever had them? If you ever had the chocolate turtles, you got peanut cinnamon stuff, that's what they taste like. Yeah, it tastes really good. I'm not gonna lie. But if you taste one of those turtles, you're like, this is not gonna be good. And you go like, oh, that's just fine. Yeah. And these are the fish crackers. Salt and vinegar flavor. So I'm missing these. They're gonna taste like... Salt and vinegar. And then this right here... It's a cupcake-y, uh, cheesy cheese. Like a cupcake. Oh, um... These are really good. These are really good. They just taste like they're strong. Like... That's very... A lot. It tastes like um... Cornbread. I love cornbread. I'll try to give it... I'll try to figure out how to taste. I like it. It tastes like cornbread. Like the jiffy cornbread. You know, I'm not a fan of that chip. It's not bad. It's different. It's not bad. It's different. I'm like, the last spot. Yeah. There's a little bit of that. Yeah. Let's go, though. Sweet tamarind candy. What is that? I don't know. That's all I want to eat. I used to get it. I really tried to say a few about this one. They're like sticking to their upwards light. Oh. I got my other separates together. It's like the texture of a raisin. I'll bet the lily syrup. What do you want to know? Like, this is like... This one... It's made of messing. Yeah. I think it's supposed to be like all of a sour. It's like that Mexican candy. Yeah. The Mexican candy like... I think that's where I can figure it out. Oh, I do. It's like hard in the center. I'm kind of like bite it. Yeah, I don't like that one. Yeah. It's like a job like here. I mean, it's a... This is the hard part. That's a... That's a... Uh, night. It is. It's hard. Yeah, you have to go to eat it. It's a night. No. It's like a... Like the core of something. I think you just bite it by some... Oh, they're like cookies. Oh, these are like the straws. Let me see. They have like... They're popping in and so like... Good. Good. Yeah. Like, they make sure this stuff is sealed. Yeah. This is... It's like thick plastic. I don't know if it's because that's what we got. This is like... You don't name it, but like... I couldn't imagine them being in a state or in a country and got to do either box purge or whatever. Um, some snacks. Yeah, like... I really like the packaging. I don't know. This is cool. I like the cup that comes with a little thing. Like, you know, like... It's like clean. Well, if you want to take a couple with you, you can put them in here. Oh my god, this feels like... Played out. This is cool. It has something in the move. Look at it. Would you like a lemon? Drops. You would have to try this. It's a good one. It's just so different. Really? Like, the texture... It feels like you're not supposed to eat this. But it tastes good. It's good. Lemon. But just feel it with your fingers. Oh wow. This smells like Played Out. Like what? Right? It's not bad. It's definitely not the... Not the best one. The thing is... How do you eat that? What do you eat that with? I'm not... I think it's the most obvious snack. That one calls it stomach pain. I think it's because it feels weird. So we don't think we should be eating it. So like the power of the mind. Yeah. Like your mind knows like it's not familiar like texture. Yeah, that's... And things says you're not supposed to eat it. And I know I'm gonna try their... Their dream. This one is just fruit soda. And if anybody ever wants some soda, they should love it. He likes soda. Oh it tastes like fancy. I mean, it smells like fancy. In this right here, I really don't know. But here you can eat it. I don't know. This is not bad. This tastes like the uncarpinated phantom. Oh really? It's kind of like dull? No, it's not dull. Like it's like you can put some ice in it. It's still gonna be good. You know? Mm. Right? That's really good. Yeah. It kind of mixes with sprites. Mm-hmm. Right? Like when you go to McDonald's, you get the mixture of drinks. Mm-hmm. And that's what that one is like. When you mix sprites with like phantom. Yeah. I don't know what these are. But they look like this. And they come. So they look like... They look like little pepperonis. This has like a little football, man. I'm... With football on this hand. Or rather the baseball. I don't know. Try this. It's so good. I think it smells very sweet. I mean, maybe one of my biggest mispeak. This must be candy. I love this strawberry dish. I need like little chocolates. Little chocolate candy. But it's like when it's sweet heart. Yeah. That's crazy. That's funny. They're like little fungits like candies. Little fung, sweet heart or something. Yeah. So they literally, it's the same feeling when you do that with your teeth or something. Yeah. Right here is this... I think this is like just cheese balls. This is another... It's a cake. But it looks like they have lots of flavors. They have purple. They got the pink strawberry. Which one's best one I'm probably gonna try. This green one. And they also have this color right here. The mocha. These are bad. I wonder if their snacks can last longer than our slits. So... Come back. So tight this sealed. Mmm. Who's question? Because once I did that, I put a bunch of air in it. These are solid. Oh, they're snacks. How? Have different... You like the chocolate. Why should you do that? They're snacks have different textures. Like this... Yeah. Oh yeah. What is it? This reminds me of a beauty blender. No, it's like... Oh, it's like... It feels like a... It's like a sponge cake too. This strawberry... So it's like... Mmm. This one's a little... Oh, and it's got it. Oh. It tastes kind of like a wafer. No, it's a dream. A wafer, the pick one. The pick one? Okay, I can see it. So everybody know where they saw these at in your lifetime. Where I'm at? Grandma's house. New for show. Very other cookie be gone except for these. I'm going to try this fish stock. But as you got older, you started to like these. Yeah. That's where grandma's house. It's funny how like your taste buds change as you go through it. Yes, because when you were young, you're like, oh, that's nasty. As you get older, you're like, that's good. Mmm. These remind me of a chip way up here. Grandma's house. 100%. These are such white chips. I'm not gonna white chip like this. Popcorn. Popcorn. That's it though. I did chip that we have here, but I can't put my name on it. It's like, it doesn't taste like fish though. No, there's like a fish on the packet. It has like a... A... A scent to it. Alright. I'm gonna try these. Ooh. This. It says King Choknut. This right here is gum. So let's take this. Can I use this? I was gonna take the gum for last. Okay, I'll show you the for last. Okay, so it came a little broken, but this is what it looks like. I'm assuming it tastes like chocolate. It's called Choknut. Choknut. Choknut. Oh my god. Oh my god, I'm gonna try it. Tell me if what I'm thinking is correct. Right here is... I'm gonna try it. It tastes like powdered chocolate. It just gluts it in your mouth. Yeah. Right? That's insane. You know... A chicko stick? You know what a chicko stick is? Maybe I do it to the knee. Or the little thing that's right next to the chicko sticks, but they're like white and black. They look like, but they're like candies. That tastes like the powder of that. Like why would... It tastes just like that, but it's just the powder of it. Like it's like crushed down instead of being a candy. It's more like a form like... You know? It's like if they crushed a candy up and put it all back together but it wouldn't be a candy and it'd be just that. You're right. Yeah, like powder. And it just shoots in it. That's literally right. Yeah. What is this called? I'm gonna try this. It reminds me of Red Bull. I didn't want to try to say this name. I didn't want to be... Polo... Polo... Polo... One... I didn't want to be just... You didn't even try. I didn't want to be just... She's better. Okay, so this is called formed sax. It's a juice drink by Zesto. It smells like latte. It's like... Cream... Like this cream will sugar that up on the side of the coffee. Really? Creamer. This tastes like orange soda and water mixed together. This tastes just like the other one where. Powder. Yes. And this weird... Like the textures are so different. Yeah. That's just powder. It is just powder. Yeah. Cause it doesn't even stay in its shape. No. Yeah. That's why I couldn't get the taste. I'm like, bro, what is that? Because it's like... Yeah. So we're going to put that to the side because that's the same thing as this. All right guys, so we cleared out the deck. I'm pretty sure you just saw. These are going to be just like the... Let's try braver. Can we try it? Let me see. Yeah. Let's try it. These are different flavors. Oh, what do they call it? Fingers. Fingers. Okay, so this is a chamerox. Chamerox. Well, that's like the brown one, so... Yeah. Big whole baron. I like this a lot. Try it. Just find my favorite. Yeah. I don't have a lot of these. These are find my favorite. They taste like the fruity pebbles. With the chocolate version. Those are things that would taste like if you just ate a whole thing and made your head like that. I have good descriptions there. You do. Do I? Yeah. You just... They're not coming through. You like halfway there and you're like, and then I'll finish it off for you. Yeah. Yeah. I'm trying. You want to try this? This is a very plain cookie. Let's try just a description for that. But... Oh, I've put in all your pens. Yeah. Right? See, because look, listen. You just tell me, just like a plain cookie. And then I'm just going to... Yeah, then go on to your list, everybody. Oh my god. Stop. I haven't changed for you. But I forgot. What are you talking about? That's all I couldn't understand. It's just a plain cookie. I don't taste bad. I don't taste amazing. It's just a plain cookie. Rammoth house cookies, I should have. Yeah. Oh, okay. So these are... Coco melos. So it's like marshmallows? Chocolate marshmallows maybe? Oh, yep. Marshmallows in chocolate. Cookie. Like a first cookie. Literally. Marshmallow with chocolate on it. So good. It's not bad. This is what you would eat at a very fancy restaurant after your meal. Right? You know those little things that they give you? Little pieces of chocolate to end your meal. A couple of letters. No? That's what I'm giving you. No, I'm getting better. Because it has a minty taste to it too. That's literally... They're giving me... No, they're giving me um... Girl's house cookies. The mint ones. Yeah. I see that too. That's what they're... They give you meat cookies after your meal. Like I was just going to find stuff. Yeah? But they taste more like that. To me. Okay. This right here is just... I look like this is a pretty much protein. But it's not protein. It's just chocolate. You can't even eat it. Oh, you have to mix it? Yeah, you got to mix it. I'm gonna take a step. I got this, Dye Ray. Right? I put it in this orange. Okay. I'm gonna get orange. And then you tell me.

Dang, let me try a strawberry. A strawberry is fun. Orange is bad. No? That's definitely good though. Then they're both really good. Yeah. The orange is good. They have it sour. Mm-hmm. It's like more chain. But the gum? Oh my gosh, so good. Good. Good as hell. Better than our gum, I bet. Yeah. That's just so good. I don't want this stuff even in the gum. I'm gonna be a kid again.
