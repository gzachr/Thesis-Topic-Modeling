 I can hear some birds. So far this bridge has been it for six years and it seems still doing good. This is what's making it narrow. Ah, look. Ah yeah. It will be cut back in the same here. Just getting smaller and smaller. Hmm. Come on, Pogi. Smaller and smaller. So, we do this once a week or once a month. This is two. Once a month. Yeah, need to be cut. You know, just do it late some day or later, or later after another. So just walk far going to the pountry with the dogs. And then come back to the kind of exercise. So, because if you notice, I am already hungry. But first, while parents are still good, you know. So, that's why we tried to have an exercise every now and then. So, and it's other thing is, it also makes the dogs run faster and enjoyed walking with us. Oh, so hungry. Oh, so really beautiful day for a walk. Yeah. It's a good part of sky. For 20. So, this is the part here that when we do the bike. Or having the car when it's muddy. It's really difficult because the type of clay, you know, the water from the mountain drop here and stagnant plus the kind of solites. There's a lot of water. It sits in these ridges, but these are a danger anyway. When you're riding the bike, because even when it's dry, if you get caught in one of these ruts, it can be quite exciting.
