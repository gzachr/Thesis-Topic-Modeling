 Yo! What is up guys? Two broskies, Jazz and Kel here. We are here to explore Lowbock and the first big one. Exactly. Kel is doing the action right now with Zipline. And maybe it's the biggest Zipline in the whole of the Philippines. And after that people, we're gonna do the Lowbock River Cruise. Hopefully first we got to survive this Zipline. It looks pretty crazy. Let's do it man. We could die bro. We could die right there. Let's do it. I can't wait. I want to die. Alright guys, you know it's serious when they make you sign a waiver before you go on the Zipline. First before we go Ziplining I'm gonna sign my life away so that they do not have any responsibility for me crashing down that big ravine over there. So both Jazz and I have now signed away our lives. We are slaves to the Zipline now. Alright guys, up to the launch area where they're gonna fire us into space. And we're up here bro. Alright it's been a long trek. We made it up. This is where they launch people to their certain death. In 2018, two brave young men decided to embark on a journey of a lifetime. They did not know if they'd be reaching their destination or if they'd ever see home again. And they did it to save the planet. So you can thank us for that later in the comments and by liking this video. Oh wait wait, why would you have to hang? Fuck the rope people. It's time for the fly baby. Ready to show! Ready boss! Oh man. Oh man that was incredible. Unless she I've never felt like I was flying but that's flying right there. That is amazing. Oh dude that feels so good. You're right dude that's amazing. When I look down I was like, It's absolutely incredible. It's the view. This is what it back feels like. Alright guys, the way back, Jazz and I are gonna have a little brosky versus brosky race off. It's gonna be KELVUS. It's gonna be a pleasure to play your best people. Good luck bro. You're gonna need it bro. Ready for action. V2. It's pretty much wheeled ready. Yeah. It's awesome. That's amazing. It was an exciting race. KELVUS was in the lead for most of it but at the very very end, Jazz pulls off. It's a rocket in my feet. Water race. Exciting from start to finish. So now people are adrenaline. It's really that blue. So what we're gonna do to bring it back to the floor, we're gonna do a nice chillaxing river cruise. To bring back the energy. I like that. Let's get on our way to the Lobach River Cruise baby. We are at the Lobach River cruise guys. This is our boat.
