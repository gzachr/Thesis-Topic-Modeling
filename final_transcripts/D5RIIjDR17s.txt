 Morning everybody! Morning morning! I'm out of business! This is beautiful view, do we have right amongst us? It's like a little Swiss Alps. That is a good view. Anywhere, anytime I would do anything for you! Great sleep last night. It's freezing this morning. I'm not used to the cold anymore. Good morning! We are now walking to the Sarri-Sari store. It's awesome because you can wake up and you can smell the palm trees. It's palm trees. You can wake up and smell the palm trees. I'm so used to the Philippines that keep saying palm trees. My name is... ...Dishwashingly good. It's apple for kind of apple. It's apple! It's apple! It's apple! It's apple! It's apple! Salamat. Hello. There's all kinds of animals around here today. There's dogs, chickens, ducks. I can hear the ducks inside my bedroom. It's like... ...who's a good boy? The issue is, you're so friendly aren't you? You're a friendly baby. That's the female and that's the daddy. That's the daddy. That's the female and that's the baby! Hey! Good doggy! Wow! You're walking, are you walking the doggy? I'll leave it. Now, leave it. I'll eat the diapers. So for today we're going to go somewhere with activity. I don't know if it's Burnham Park or Hyde Park, but there's a place here where you can do horse riding. So that's one place we can do that. Or we can go to the zip lining place. I don't know if we can have time to do boat. Shut up! We got friends. We got little friends joining us. Come with us. Hello? You're so cute! I know a carpenter. I know a laborer. He is my teacher. He's a wild boy. Yeah! Yeah! Thank you! Yeah, bye-bye! Bye-bye! You know what that's in Wai? Bye-bye! That's the beauty about the Northern region. The Philippines is a very different variation of what we already understand of the Philippines, which is the beaches, the island hopping, and all that. There's also the North, which is sometimes overlooked, but yeah, it's really a great place to go. There's mountains, there's little cold, there's great for camping. Hiking tours are amazing up here. So definitely go to come out and check this place out if you're a little bit. Not say bored, but tired of just island hopping, because we always do that. So sometimes you want a different variation of the Philippines, come up to the North. Good, baby. How are you feeling today? I'm glad you're here. Daniel, I'm so glad you're here. I love you so much, Daniel. I'm a best friend. Right now we're in another 50s diner. They seem to love the 50s inspired teen-y diner. I don't know what it's about, the 50s here.

Before entering the zip lining, it's going to be awesome. Is this going to be awesome? A little bit. Just go straight to the garden. Good. So now we're in the parking comp John hey we're in the picnic area and yeah we're gonna go to the adventure place after this so let's go.

Okay, so we're going to have a change of plan. We're going to head on to I think the horse place. Because we're going to have to wait an hour here. And then we also have to wait for the rides. And then some of them are not available. So we're going to go to the horse place. Change of plan. And plus they have the dogs and you're not allowed to leave her belongings. Anyway, there's no lockers or. Well, it's not like you're going to put a dog in a locker. You know what I mean? You can't leave the dogs there. So I'd rather do something as a group. You know what? Family matters. So we're going to go on. And she's not allowed. She's not allowed. She's not allowed. She's not allowed. And a plunging neckline. Yeah, and a plunging neckline apparently.
