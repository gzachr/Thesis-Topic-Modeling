I don't work. That's that this picture is probably from the Philippines What's up? You're in today's video I share my experience on how I live better in the Philippines and I did in the States All right with always in time. Let's get into it So any extra that's lived in the Philippines can concur with me on this the reason we can live better in the Philippines and in the US is because of the low cost of living in the affordable luxuries Yeah, for the same amount of money you'd spend in California, New York, Chicago and any of the major cities in the US You can live a life of luxury in the Philippines before we moved to the Philippines We lived in Chicago and as you know Chicago is not a cheap place to live no It's not the expenses would reach up to over ten thousand dollars per month Congratulations. Hey, what are you doing? Oh dependent on where you live? I mean you can live 10,000 now when he says monthly expenses he could be including like the luxuries that they do as well and they might They might live a month They might be a wealthy family. I mean they're definitely wouldn't be moving to well They're rich now. They're much more wealthy in the Philippines All right, let's find out 10,000 and that's not hard. I want to see what he said $1,000 per month Congratulations, you play yourself and that's not hard to spend it being how expensive the city is and nowadays I've been there rising costs you'd easily blow through that and also keep in mind that it's an entire family as well Not just one person, but here in the Philippines you come here with that kind of budget Forget about it. You come here with half of that $5,000. You're living like Only one panor a political prisoner Okay, maybe I'm exaggerating, but $5,000 no joke will provide you a life with very very little Financial worries here. I might even say none to put the icing on the cake You come here with half of that half $2,500 and you're living the life my friend for example I'm here at the pool in Arcanno in BGC granted. I won't sugar-coated It is more pricey to live in the cities of the Philippines, but but that that's beautiful I mean in BGC granted I won't sugar-coated it is depending on which everywhere in the Philippines is not far from the ocean So so I personally did the math for all my stuff just recently With everything including car payment in an RV on top of that right insurance is everything I'm around 3,800 bucks. Yeah, I think I'm right at $3,000 And I'm still paying on things. No, and I'm above 3,000. I'm about 3,500 $3,600 and that's with child support. That's with a thousand dollars of child support Yeah, and then so expenses and Child care and things like that I'm around 35 you said 38. So That's that's in 2000 is my rent right so you got to be looking at I mean here you'd have to make just to get by and Be able to do some luxuries you'd have to make at least 5500 to 6 grand pre-tax Just to be able to do some fun things with with those kind of expenses There's more price to live in the cities of the Philippines, but even with Elegurious lifestyle like eating out whenever you please hanging out at the pool mid-afternoon and getting massages I'd say the majority of us from the state is still spending less in the Philippines even with this in the same budget To afford this type of lifestyle in the Philippines, but afford you really nothing glamorous in the states What you'll likely have when moving to the Philippines whether you're tired summer or tired or working as a digital nomad is Freedom of your own routine the nice part about coming here and leaving your job from your home country is that you dictate your own time And basically live on your own terms your daily routine is completely up to you because you have less obligations Starting in a new country from most of you in the Philippines You can wake up when you please and do whatever you want during the day and see that that would be fantastic to run a YouTube channel out of the Philippines Oh, yeah, because you make the same money you were making in America because it's just based off of your viewership and like the origins that that your viewers are from but It's doable. Yeah, absolutely. I love doing what he's doing right there. I've never I've never been successful in blowing o's in the water You got to lay on your back to do it. Oh, I love doing it. We can swim whenever we want We can eat out often and enjoy relaxing and get away activities What we do here is shape our work life around our preferred lifestyle So if you want to go out and do this to dad or swim we schedule our work hours accordingly This is why I suggest if you're coming here that you still have some sort of income coming in from your western country Of course, what you guys know that because if you or I were to work at traditional job in the Philippines We won't get that freedom of routine where you can schedule your own day not to mention It's always best to get paid dollars while in the Philippines But I know a lot of you guys are looking for a simple life in the provinces of the Philippines Many and perhaps yourself may be leaving your country to live a simple Minimulus and peaceful life in the Philippines and perhaps you don't want to live on the non-necessities and live Extravagantly and that's even better because your money will last you even longer here But I'll tell you guys right now not everyone is going to live better in the Philippines than they did in the US Some people just like their life in the US or at the whole country More than they do in the Philippines. So make no mistake It's not like you get off the plane in your own wonderland immediately and all of your breweries disappear I don't want to sell you guys a life that I know depends on each individual's taste For getting back to my point the costs of living and the affordable luxuries is what really makes life living here amazing Even if you're not the type to spend much you at least have that peace of mind Know that you're not going to hit the pit of your wallet each month How many Americans or just people in the West in general go a day without having to worry about making rent or at least making Enough for that month. We all know Even though you and I make good money I mean it is still conscious. I thought in the back of our mind like We've got to make more. We're not making enough 100% it's easy to get pressured into I don't know wherever I live. It's gonna change that exact next paycheck But in places like the Philippines and Bali you find that you free yourself of that stress because you're living a life with Lower expenses basically it's just not as hard to keep up with your expenses while it's totally understandable It's funny how many Filipinos want to move to the US and then many Americans want to leave the US for the Philippines There's always aspects that you and I like and dislike about the US and same with the Philippines It's up to us to figure out whether or not those Upside overcome the downsides and why I also see us living better in the Philippines and in the US is because what is seen as Luxuries in America is completely affordable in the Philippines these movie references are are great They're impactful give you an example my family would spend a lot of time going back and forth between the province in the city and In Manila it doesn't make sense for us to look at any of that Staying in time or to take public transportation So what we did which maybe ideal for most of you as well was hire a driver You tell someone you hired a driver or a maid in the states then they'll immediately presume you to be rich But here in the Philippines hiring a driver for $250 per month is not only affordable but also completely worth it Have your own driver for $250 a month. It's always Yeah, I just get a scooter. I just get a scooter now if it's 250. What is there? Denomination Paces. Oh, yeah, that's right. That's right. If it's 250 pesos you got to deal. Oh, yeah You have someone to help you navigate the area you're with a local that would be nice You getting around and most of all you don't have to drive So this is just one of the many like having your own tour guys. I need that big car And on called let's say you don't need stuff like that and you prefer to live minimally which many expats do here Then you can expect your budget to last you much longer in the Philippines But enough about money. We already know that you can get much more bang for your buck in the Philippines The reason I and perhaps yourself will have a much better life in the Philippines is because of the people the people make the Philippines I always talk about how the people here are genuine and kind So him speaking on people we've heard that in almost every Filipino video that we've watched that the Philippines Has some of the most amazing people just because of their kindness and their generosity and we've seen it Just in our comments section. Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of the Philippines gives us the most love out of anybody Except for the one or two Pinoy baiting comments that we get from from Just mean people Get a sense of less tension in the air because the priorities of the people in the Philippines are different than the priorities of the people in the West Here am I saying enough about money, but honestly Filipinos prioritize family and relationships more than they do money As opposed to living a life of materialism they show you that happiness doesn't come from what you own So it gives you a deeper sense of hey if these struggling Filipinos are happy with what little they have Then why can't I be happy with what I have the next reason I enjoy life more everywhere in the US It's because of how more peaceful it is abroad peaceful because of several reasons number one You get the island life no matter what setting you're in so the pace of life here is much slower and laid back Number two, I wouldn't love that divisive and generally mind their own business and three as I mentioned you can have freedom by living on your own terms And what you do during the day but among these reasons the fact that Filipinos are not divisive is what makes living here much sweeter It's not like you have to walk on eggshells when talking to the people worried about their political stands and their personal beliefs and it's not like they'll get offended if your beliefs are different than theirs For the most part the people here are united and there's not much drama whatsoever the divisiveness Homelessness increasing crime rates increasing prices and political drama We're all things that led up to leaving the US but I'll be honest guys We still would have moved to the Philippines regardless don't get me wrong But these issues were just the cherry on top and it's what sealed the deal and another reason I love the Philippines is because sunsets are like this every day Very beautiful and so while it may sound crazy to leave America for a third world country and all reality America has the exact same things that third world countries have and don't get me wrong I love that I was raising the states and life was good there Technically, we do not call it third world countries anymore Yeah, and you guys the Philippines I wouldn't consider a third world country It's developed and underdeveloped Yeah, I mean it's it's but it's developing quickly yeah absolutely But no, I wouldn't even use that term to describe right the Philippines is way too yeah the Philippines is way too gorgeous and and Technologically advanced to call a I really had to leave that far back that it's understated place to be to go the light And I consider a blessing because I wouldn't have my upbringing in any other way or any other place But at some point you just want something new for a change and you look all around in America And you see that it's also changing and not for the better either But I'll be honest two years ago I wouldn't be able to say that I like the Philippines more than I did the US That's the thing it can be easy to picture the Philippines as everything you see on social media The beautiful beaches the weather the people it can be easy to get caught up in thinking that things will be perfect As soon as you land but the reality is for many it will take time to adjust to the Philippines My first couple months here. I didn't like the Philippines. I wasn't used to life here But as time goes on you figure out the best place to live suited for you You figure out your routine and you adjust to the new life for some of you You may prefer living in the province full time while for others They simply can't stand living in the province for extended periods of time These are the little turn around along the way that make for a good life in the Philippines So I'd say for some the longer that you live here the better life gets that was at least the case for us We knew that we didn't want to live in the province full time so we made BGC our home base Then when we feel like visiting the province to go to the beaches and check out the sites We set aside a day for that So there you have it say be expats that is a couple of reasons why I find life better in the Philippines than in the US Personally, I feel happier here and that's not just because I run a YouTube channel about the Philippines I can genuinely say that with my hand to my heart if you enjoyed this video a like so definitely I would Enjoy this video and give it a like this was I very well put together video and he explained things very well guys go check out this savvy expat He's only got 19.6 thousand subscribers.
