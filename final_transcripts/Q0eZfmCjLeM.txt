 Oh, tubers, family and friends, it's the evening, beautiful day today. In northern Mendenau, Philippines, or just in the backyard, just kind of doing a little chores. What actually are you cooking back here? Oh, a fish. Cooking a fish. Fish, you don't like fish, but awesome. I like tuna. Yeah, there. My god, that's not a poor life. Tuna is very expensive. Tuna is delicious. Yeah. And there's no bone, so that's why I like it. No bone, no chance for the boys to get a bone caught in their throat. That's my biggest concern. What are you doing? What are you doing? What's that? What's that? A leaf? What's that? What's that? A leaf? Leo, what's that? A leaf? Huh? What do you have? You usually talking up a storm. Come on, let's go look at the fire. Come on. Come on. It's over here, fire. Stick? No, don't put that stick. What's that? A fire. Fire. Fire. There's a fire. Oh no, I'm going to bite you. Let's go look at the turkey. The turkey hungry. The turkey hungry. The turkey. The turkey. The turkey. Yeah, that's cooking to fish, Leo. Come on, hit, bone, bone. How come you're hitting bone, bone? She's going to cry. Come on. How come you guys aren't cooking in there? How come you're not cooking in there? Very hard. What if it starts to rain? That probably won't tonight. Here's all our kind of junk pile from construction. Still left over. We've got some scaffold pipes still here. On this end too. Some over here, some on the other side. Just odds and ends. Mostly it's just wood rotting. This wood that's rotting, you guys can burn that for cooking. What is it called? I love toads in my fridge. It's just a junk pile here now. Just odds and ends. Different stuff that we were using for construction. Here's the harvested and cut all this out of native trees here. This is a big spider right here right now. This here is a bull saw. We use that to cut everything into thick lumber. There's lots of spider webs and bugs in here now. That's the only turkey we have left out of the five turkeys we had. A couple of them got sick last year and we butchered for a woman. This is the only one of the old eggs they laid that lived, that actually hatched. But we had to put it in the nest of the chicken for it to hatch. It's a male. It's a Tom turkey. It's about three years old now right. Same age as Leo. Actually three and a half was born like three, four months before Leo was born. So it was an old man signed to us that it was the only egg that hatched into a turkey. And it was a boy. So we figured okay we're going to get one boy. And sure enough, there's Leo. Actually we get a fire there. Actually we guess already that this is when we guess Leonardo before I become pregnant. After this, Pablo. Yeah and that just confirmed it. They call it Pablo I call it turkey. Which is that the Pablo that's our hand. We're the find sometimes. So it's kind of nice back here. It's kind of like a get a little getaway and a little private forest. We planted all these coconuts here. These dwarf coconuts. They're still pretty small looking and it's kind of weird looking. I mean look at this one. Like what? One foot of stump. Then it goes right into the ferns after one foot. It's very strange. So what's this tree here, huh? That we plant? Mangosteen. Mangosteen, this one? Yes. Okay that's Mangosteen. And these are lasunni trees here. These two that were here before when we bought the property before we developed it. And here's one of the original coconut trees that was here. This one here. And then this is a new one that we planted, a dwarf coconut, along with these dwarf coconuts here. What other fruit trees did you grow back here? Avocado, jackfruit, actually. These two here are avocado. Avocado is a dwarf avocado. It's never become big and big like five years already. Huh. And this other one is a jump form which is the de-save. Where? The other one. That one? This little one? Or this big one? The big one. Okay. That's jackfruit, a small one. It's hard to tell when they're young what they are until they start giving you fruit. But these are all probably three, four years old. You know, these coconuts are five. How old is Mangosteen? Four. Four years? Four years? What's this one, huh? That's a mango. That's four or five years old. This one? Yes. That's a dwarf. That's a mango. Okay, apple. Apple mango. It's a mango still. It's an apple mango. And one time it produced three pieces of fruits. And born and I very attractive with it. Then we decided to get it instead of let that produce many. And we just, I hope, knows like a spell. If you have this right away, then never produce again. It's right on the... Don't talk to me about spells. Crazy. These people on the province believe in spells and shit all the time. So, this is also a lasoony tree here. And this here is a regular mango tree. This one here, if you plan it. I haven't seen any mangoes and this one is also about four years old. We've been trimming it so the branches don't go wide out to the sides. We've been trying to grow it up by trimming the bottom branches. But no fruits yet. Let's see. Every year, it grows like a foot and a half or two feet. Everything grows like weeds in this country. So, you'll never have any problems growing anything. Okay. What are you doing, Leo? No. Huh? Come on. You can come over here. Okay, we'll get it. Where are you going to go? How are you? Where are you going to go? Huh? What's this? Coco? Coco. Coco. Oh, there. That's a cocoa. Coco nut. Wow. There's a dirty on it. Are you going to eat that? Are you going to eat that cocoa? Huh? Come on, buddy. We're going to go up here now. There's some more cocoa. Coco. I really love this tree, this golden tree. You can see the seeds that it's bearing. I've made other trees from these seeds many times already. So, as you can see, the driveway looks so nice now after we pressure washed it. It looks like almost brand new concrete. It'll be that way for six months and then it'll be worse if it's new. So, from the golden palace, I'll let you guys go. This is just a little tidbit of what we're doing in the evening here. Just chilling out. Chillin' out in the jungle. So, take care. God bless, bye-bye.
