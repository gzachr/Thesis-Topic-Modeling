 Good morning, everyone. You know what guys? Let's go see if they'll arrest me. What do I mean? What do I mean? You guys know there's that challenge out there, that challenge me walking down walking street in my speedo. That's just a fun challenge, right? So a lot of people are like, well pay you not to do it. Other people are saying, don't do it, you can get arrested. Well, let's go find out, let's go find out if they're gonna arrest me. Car turning around. It's all on fun guys. It was all it's all in fun. Surprisingly, there were a few people that did donate and I'm here to say, if it's a no-go, I will refund your money. Not enough yet to make it worth my while, right? Anyways guys, I am taking a little stroll down through here. So we'll go find out. Well, I'll head up to the police department here and talk to them and see what they have to say. Yeah, a lot of people are like, well pay you not to do it. Well, pay you not to do it. Anyways, here we are. Just got done eating. Let's wind him up in this area here. Central tower. I've been up there in a while. Ah, beautiful day. Beautiful day. No rain. It doesn't appear to be rain. Do get some rain at night. It is rainy season. So it's to be expected, right? I don't mind the rainy season. It doesn't rain every day. Reading every day, I don't. I'm not a big fan of that. Good morning. Hello. Wow, look at you. Twins. Same dress. Here for the mass. I got mass today. There's the church. Morning. The old sisters. This guy here on the right is recycling. That's his recycling cart right there. Recycling, Pooja. Recycle. Recycle. Yeah, cardboard and plastic. That's his recycling. All right, good to see some recycling. There's a place they take all that recycling too. You do see people like here. You will see people going through that and you think, oh, they're picking up garbage. What you're doing is they're going through there, picking up anything recyclable. Check out the weight bench. There's a weight bench. Here's a weight concrete blocks with a metal pole in the middle. Rosie Lynn's lunch room. Morning. Looks like the pharmacy is a little white today. Item in road here. Morning. Envy's on the right. Fillies on the left. Police stations are right up here. I think it's police station number four. You can say what better way to find out than to go to the source, right? You're across here. Nobody coming? All right. That's I, I would tell luxury pios above the tail. That's new. First time seeing that. All right, right up here is police station number four. So let me head in there and see about it, right? Let me find out if it's allowed or it's not allowed. All right, guys. So here is what I found out. I evidently there is moral indecency balls here. So basically I was told it would be considered a morally indecent act. Now, I guess appropriate places and appropriate attire for the appropriate surroundings. So if I'm on the beach in the Philippines, it wouldn't be considered immoral to wear a speedo. No, because surrounding dictates it's okay, but it would be considered an immoral act if I were to walk up walking street wearing a speedo. Here's here's what's weird. Here, he didn't even told me this. You know, around here you everywhere you go for real. You see people like stopping and urinating on the side of the road, a tree or whatever. To me, I don't care. Personally, it does not bother me because you know, I have to go really, really bad and there's no restaurant around, restroom around. If there's a tree or whatever, I'm going, I'm going. And that's what's great about here in the Philippines. The state's, oh, you're getting arrested for public exposure and you're going to possibly go to jail and get fines. And here it doesn't matter, but technically it's considered an immoral act. So that's what's going on. You know what? Let's walk this way. I will walk and I will talk. And when I talked about doing something like that, a couple of you guys did leave comments, say you better not do that. It might be against the law here. You might get in trouble for it. And look, even told me, well, look, wasn't a big fan of it. I mean, we laughed at it. But look, it's like, nah, I wouldn't do that. Something could happen. Basically, they told me if I were to do something like that, I'd be arrested. I'd be arrested. Basically, that was threatened to be arrested. Well, I wouldn't say threatened, but I could be arrested, be thrown in jail, be given fines. So not worth it, not worth it, not going to do it. Ah, yeah. I looked even told me. She said she remembers there was an incident where there was a photo agency, an agency that did photos. And they had the women were at this happening in Nilla area. And they were in swimsuits bikinis and stuff like that. And they came in and shut it down and shut down the agency. And there was a big, big thing about it. So she even said, I don't think it would be a good idea. So I just clarified it. It's not a good idea. Not a good idea. Anyways, I'll walk up this way. It was the old jolly bee. I think I was in there one time. I think it was in his jolly bee, one time. I might have been to go to the bathroom. Or no, no, we went in there for a meal. It looked, when it looks family was up here a few years back. These restaurants here to the left right down there is Fields Avenue. So we're just going to kind of parallel walk down here. Over there is the terminal for, I think that's a terminal takes you on the Clark. Different jeep needs pull in there taking you to different places. Let's see, I haven't checked through here.

Medical and surgical consultations, laboratory, test, dental treatment, cosmetic treatments. Then here on the corner, salon and spa, that is closed. All right. All right. Across street, there is a same Clark. I haven't been in SM Clark in a while. Everyone I first got here, I was always at SM Clark. At least three or four times a week we go in there. I want to check something out of here. Right down here. I've seen this driving through here. Wondered what it was. So what better way to find out than to check it out. Here's straight ahead there. There's two poles. There's these two poles here. So I don't know if this was a memorial at one time here. I don't know if it was a memorial, but it looks like it looks like two flag poles right here.
