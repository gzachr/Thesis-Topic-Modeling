 We have 21 islands and say for 370... Oh! I'm so excited! I'm so excited! Today we have a very special video Because as you may know or not, we like to read all of your comments Even though sometimes we don't answer and a lot of people told us Because we've made a few speaking Filipino language reaction videos Yeah We know about the similarity between Spanish and the Tagalog and other Filipino language And you guys told us that Shaba can know is the one that is the most similar to Spanish And now we found a video about Rubin's Kid Rubin's Kid is a very famous YouTuber who goal is to travel to every country on the planet Earth And he's why I think he's Filipinus Yeah, he's why he's Filipino He has been to every country except 5 or 6 now near the end of his goal And we found one of his videos about Asian Latin town that can speak Spanish And it's the Shaba can know language, the town is called Zambo and Watt So we're gonna react to it right now So, okay, let's get started No, don't stress Oh! Wait, we know of those 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 Oh no, I don't remember the end 9 and 10 What is it? He's doing him 10 and 10 is it 7, 7, 7 I don't remember, I know No, no Ah, we also have the French Creole We also have our version of French Creole Wow, what's that? Whoa Oh What's your name? I'm Kevan We're good, and you? We're good Are you from Spain? Yes, yes Oh my god, I understand everything Yeah? We're good How are you? Wow, are you really speaking? Very similar to Spanish or Spanish So the lady she's speaking that language and we're good She's speaking Spanish And he's speaking Spanish to her To her Oh Like it was very easy conversation Like, oh, I'm with one of the ass We're good, we're good, I'm good Yeah? This is the one that you learned like the first class in university to introduce yourself Wow, that means I think that could speak like a tree language If they are staying in that part of the meaning Maybe they don't speak Tagalog I don't know You know But this is because every part of the Philippine have their damn what maybe they do Anyway, it depends I think where they are in the Philippine, I don't know I wanted to visit Zambawanga Not only because it has a cool name Or any of the things in the southwestern Philippines But it's always been drawn into its culture This one is good And it's made of And it's made of Beef and Beef and Burn coconut Have you seen burn coconut before? Burn coconut like that? It's like we are stir the coconut until it turns brown But actually I'm not sure But usually we make that one to be a dessert Oh, it's a dessert? But I don't know about this one Yeah Burn coconut Oh, you drink it like that? It's spicy The name is good It's so different then Shabakano It's similar to Paris It's crazy being here because the culture feels somewhat like Malaysian and Indonesia When you're in Spanish reminds me of the equatorial beginning The only Spanish-speaking country in Africa In good culture here in the equatorial beginning In fact, Zeboanga is the only place in all of Asia where people speak as Spanish-Dia Wow How does Panapista speak? How does this all happen? Terminator In 1521 And the fish market is archipelago of 7,641 islands And stayed for 370 Oh, so this is the town that they enter from You know when we say that the Spanish colonized Filipino, the Filipino I think it's the town that they arrive And they stay alone Yeah They come by the boat and they stop there This is the town, the place that they arrive from Because you can see on the map, it's not necessarily near the valley But it's more on the side So they arrive by here and they arrive in the mountains Yeah, yeah So that's why a lot of language like outside of that still will also speak Spanish So maybe the more of the Philippines pick a little bit more or less they have their dialect that is less Spanish Because it's far, I don't know, but Yeah How can you say that it is more started? Too amazing It's going to have a 377 day Years, that is still there Day or year? Years Well, that's too long Yeah It's spread all over the country, right? And language Wow, many of the Philippines 170 dialects have elements of Spanish words Nothing is... Because it's started there Yeah, yeah, yeah Wow Oh my god Even the sea there is a little pretty like a Not destroyed yet The language evolved from a history of inner religion To be said Wow I'm completely happy if I can stop Me too Hello Hello Tata No Even though it's a queer language About 70% of the words are the same as Spanish 70% You know, down here can read, speak, and write Spanish Wow Wow I'm going to Spanish and Spanish as well In Spanish In Spanish Existing or in Papua In Spanish So the next one See, on poco, a little bit Just remember that there's tons of smiling faces in the face Wow I love to join the conversation Nice Oh my god, a lot of Jungkook Yeah I didn't know what I wanted to say Is it me or T Or more fair skin than A lot of the video that we react to Like, their skin color look a little bit More potpale or a little bit wider I don't know if it makes sense I was going to ask to like her Like a lot of people that skin is kind of like clear Yeah, yeah And you see that lady right on the side It's on the trivita lady But she has something on her head I saw some people with some stuff on their head Well, he mentioned it This towel is look like Malaysia and Indonesia Maybe we're going to have like some Maybe there's some Muslim guy Yeah, it will make sense Yeah, good Gracias Thank you Oh, it's finished A country left So it's kind of a recent video And he did Balloon Some of you told us about Balloon Is it chicken inside? Oh, he's the one that I've got A little chicken and it's so ugly But some people love it It's like having food You don't like it right I don't know who eat it But my friend is her life It's her life The Balloon Yeah It's the one with the chicken that look It looked like a small chicken before It's like girl Oh, yes, it's this one right All you drink like that Delicious, so Delicious Oh, you eat it How is it? One two three That has to be You have to stay in the same Together I don't think that's the word One two three Yeah Wait, three more times Oh my god Wow, I think that was I mean, that was really interesting You know, I'm so curious If they are going in another part of like, Philippines Would they prefer the Spanish language Or like, that's a lot more And another people in another part Would they understand the people From that part well or not Yeah, because it just sets 70% Spanish So the rest is it That a lot is 30% Enough, I think so I think if you do the math together I think it will be an A ball I think because maybe it probably Learned that a lot at school too Yeah Until learning dialect Because I think what I understood from you But I'm not sure is that the The main Filipino language That a lot I think pretty much everyone speak it But then everyone has their own dialect Just like I speak French What I speak in my French in With my also my dialect But I can speak with someone from France You know I can speak from someone who speak French in Africa With no real problem But I have my way to speak When I speak with my friend That I'm not necessarily Gonna use the same word When I speak to someone Who is from another country French You know Because sometimes it's gonna be too different And that she can, right If you know If I don't see anything inside yet Like you just take a little part of it And then give it to me I will not have any problem about that Because when I was young Like my uncle He like lying to me He was making like some kind of fry meat Like pucker-pow The Thailand The Thai dish And then he gave it to me I did not know it was what a rat means And I was like oh it was so good And then he just Told me at the end it was rat I thought it was poor and I And I kicked that dish away Immediately Because I did not know it was rat You know But it was so delicious Seriously And the chicken is gonna be like that too You know one thing also that I mentioned It's look very clean, the streets Yeah It looks very like very very clean Very everything It seemed like to be Somewhat of not maybe not necessarily a rich Like I don't know if it's considered rich But it seemed really clean And the building looked quite nice actually Oh I know Like forest Yeah yeah It looked very nice place to be actually Yeah Let us know what you think in the comment below Well else we should know about that part of the Philippine Yeah Thank you for watching And see you next time Bye bye
