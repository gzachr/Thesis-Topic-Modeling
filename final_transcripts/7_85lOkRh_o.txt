And also don't forget when you go to the market, bring your own echo bag or your own basket or your own biong. And please avoid using single use plastics. Actually it's not allowed anymore here in Batanga. In other cities also in the Philippines, they have a lot of meat. Yes, Makati and Nido there are many places.
