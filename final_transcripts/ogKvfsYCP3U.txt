 Wow! I'm excited! It's so cool to go in the foreign supermarkets. I really love it. I've never seen such a creatively decorated vegetarian food section in my life. Oh, I almost find your own. Really? Wow. I think we found the local stock. Oh, my local! Oh, she's big! She is bigger. Look how they affect the beans. You guys would have no idea what we just found in the money that supermarket. Crazy! Big and neat! It's crazy. You know when we started traveling we thought that the Philippines would be the most difficult with vegetarian food. Now we are just one day here and we already found so much vegan and vegetarian foods. Amazing!
