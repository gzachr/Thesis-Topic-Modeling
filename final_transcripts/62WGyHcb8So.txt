All right, because it's an in as well. So you can check in here for room, I guess. But yeah. Look at this. It's got that whole German feel to it. Oh, look at that. But very incredible. You can actually visit this one. That'd be pretty mad man. Or the light is kind of reflecting on that, but that'd be pretty cool. Uh, they got beaver signs in here. All right, let's go one of our cover fasts. Look at this. The decor, in here, is so cool. Yeah, like we're going to our cover fest. Look at this, the decor in here is so cool. All right, we're going to keep on. All right, I've got my head here. Okay. I noticed this. That's why I wanted to go. Oh, the old pottery and the axe. It's like a little museum along with the food. Hey, there's a bell over here too. Like a hear you. You want service? Get ready. Oh, all right. Hey, that's like the orchid for the mall. That's it, there you go. Oh, you would probably be there.

The main meals here, you see the different sausage meals, are 290 pesos. Snitzel, 329, Vienna Snitzel, looks really, really good. And yeah, you're able to get some unusual foods that you normally aren't going to imagine finding in the Philippines. I'm excited. I'm still happy. I love meat, so I'm not.

Like, you could like, best digs and stuff. Yeah, the stakes, I couldn't believe it. Yeah, really well-pressed. But everything, everything looks good, but. Yeah, you got to get that. I need to know what you're getting for. What's your favorite? Right? The chicken wings. The chicken wings? The chicken wings? The chicken wings? That's a German of you? No, it's very German. One liter of German beer. This is the Radler, and it is a sweeter light beer. The North Mine. Look at you. Cheers, them of this thing. Wow. My arms are shaking. I bet. You wanted to work out. This is how I work. This is how you convince me to work out. I'm going to just lift the beer to my lips. Oh my god. Back and forth. Are you going to be able to drink all that? You little you? Look at little tiny you. You're going to drink all this. Oh my god. Let's do it. Oh, it's like challenging stuff, dude. Do I have a tablet? We drink it in two minutes. Oh my god. Right, right. Chalk, chalk. Chalk. Chalk. Chalk. Chalk. Chalk. Chalk. Chalk. We don't have to like, passing out on the sidewalk. Well, you know, it happens. All right, here we go. Taste test. That is really good. Doesn't even taste like beer. Really? Yeah, it doesn't taste like beer. Uh-oh, that sounds dangerous when you get in there. By the way, how much was one one here? 199, 199? Oh my god. And later a beer. Alright, that's four dollars guys. You know, that's what a lot of people were selling. Almost as much as they were selling a single-boi beer bottle on Borca. Yeah, if you want, you can have one beer or you can have more beer. Four. Wow. I need to try it. Yeah. So in October, I see that your cheer is so hard, it would splash over it because they have the beer stand. But this is glass. We're not doing that. We're not going to break anything. Oh my god. Right? Right? I told you it's dangerous. This is liquid candy? This isn't. It really is sweet. You know, I never expected. Like when they're like, oh, it's a sweet beer. I'm like, okay. It's still good. I've had Radly before. But honestly, I really like that orange beer. Yeah. I really like it. Like, but light orange. What was the other blue moon or bell jam moon, whatever, my favorite. But every time you try some of the other ones, the Radly ones, it actually tastes kind of terrible, like hyper grapefruit or whatever. I don't like that. But this is delicious. All right. All right. We're not here just a drink beer. We're not coming here to drink beer. Do they? Can you order it for home? You are a beer. Oh. Oh, that's cool. All right. So here is the October Fest Ladder. Holy smokes. You've got four or five different types of sausages here, first mustard. You have, it looks like crispy pata. I mean, yeah, looks like that. You got snitzel here and... I think that's a... It's a... Potato salad or something. And then you got another salad over here, like a, looks like a thousand island. Yeah, let's put it in a salad. Potato salad. Let's try it on a potato salad. German potato salad. Okay. That's incredible. This is an actual feast here. Wait, what's this? Is this part of the crispy pata? Is this something else? That's part of the crispy pata. I'll just... It's just profile. All right. So the crispy pata, by the way, a little last German. Oh, they also have a German. It's called Pognuffles. Oh, pork knuckles. Okay. So is German also? Fantastic. By the way, we have the owner here. I'm sorry. It's just an open-up. Awesome place, by the way. This place is so cool. And the beer. Look at this. Look how much we're into it already. Bread and butter as well. And there's different types of bread in there. Yeah, it's some of the raw. Wow. Honeygar, like chicken wings, is well. And they look fantastic. I love how they set it up. Over here is also a bocal. Yeah. And that is a beef shank. We have a cow. Oh, hello. Hello. And it comes with pasta and a little bit of salad on the sides. We have somebody else joining us. Hi. Hello. Look at this. We're having a party. But we're the only... Oh, no, he's going to die. Oh, we're doing it. Oh, okay, okay, okay. Fair enough. All right. So what are you excited about? All of it. No, come on. The sausages. The sausages is the first thing you want. The sausages are the number one. Definitely. All right. Well, why do you take one of each one? Oh, okay. I cut them in pieces. Thank you. Wow. You know. Oh, it's a feast. It's a massive feast. Four pieces makes one whole. Oh, I'm going. I'm going. Okay. I don't know which is which. Yeah. Just try them all. This one might be my favorite. Really? So the light color going up here. What's the light color going up here? It's brown. Oh, that was brown worse. Brown worse. Okay. Okay. Which one is this one? I think that's the Vienna. Vienna sausage. It's like a good breakfast sausage. Yeah. Oh, okay. And the next one's a bread. Oh, okay. It's a bread. It's a bread. It's a bread. Okay. I think that's a Vienna sausage. Okay. Vienna sausage. It's like a good breakfast sausage. And the next one's a bread. Where's this winning? No, Vienna. Oh, Vienna sausage. Okay. This one's next. This is the last one. Which one is this one? I think that's the hungry one. Hungarian. Okay, let's go. Hold on. Oh, they're all so good. All right. With some mustard. Okay. You have to try it with the mustard. Of course. Yeah. I'm sure we're going to get the comments. Where's the vinegar? But you got to have mustard and sausages. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. You got to have mustard and sausages. You press it in the song. Please blow me away. It's so good. Oh, that's great. It's so good. I can eat this every day. What about the crispy path to the dough? You've had crispy path before. And the schnitzel. Actually, go for a hold. Let's go for a hand, y'all. I'm going to see this on. The pork nappost. Yeah. It was nice and bow. Right. It was very tender. Just the dough. All right. Pork nappost. It's so crunchy. All right. Everybody is having a blast. This is absolutely delicious. Hey, it's a little bit. It's a little bit sweet. Wow. Okay. Okay. That sounds cool. I think you're going to have to take a crispy path at home. We can do that. Yeah, I know you'll eat that. You'll eat that. Because that was more food than possibly anybody can handle. That's a lot. There are five of us. No wonder it's a platter. Come on. And there are four guys here. How do you feel? Yeah, what the heck? How do you feel? Surrounded by four guys. Pretty special. I don't know. I feel great. You feel like one of the guys, right? I'm one of the boys. That's right. That's right. Wow, that was so delicious. And we tried the other beer at the end there. Yeah, the dark beer. It was really, really good. They're both left. That's my favorite now. I think so as well. We had to come back here again. Yeah, I was shocked. I was like, listen. You need to get this in other restaurants here in town. Because this beer is absolutely amazing. And having craft beer will attract people to other restaurants. So yeah, he's going to look into that. So, hey, if you were a restaurant in town and you were in the restaurant, you were in the restaurant in town and you want to serve it. You were a drinker. Yeah, or a bar or something. And you want to serve his beer. I would suggest you get ahold of him. I know. He doesn't yet have kegs or anything. But he's like, yeah, I'd probably do that. Yeah. So, yeah, I would go to your place if you had it. That's for sure. So, remember guys, this is Bavaria, German restaurant. The sausages, like even the snitzel. Yeah. Amazing. Fabulous. That was actually really, really good. Yeah, I'm so full. Really with the beer, everything. Amazing. Yeah. Yeah. And it's a family owned business. A Filipino is like, great, great place. So, anyway, check it out. We highly recommend it because that was really good. And now we're going to go off and check out another place because our friend here is taking us a little bit around town. So, we appreciate it. Getting a little adventure. You're an adventure. Thank you. Mabuhai. Mabuhai.
