It's doing a very good job there. So, I put your door. And then we're going to make an easy access here to the chair, which was a bit hard. This is the access. I'm not going. Excellent. Oh, sorry man, I'm on your way. We need some hinges. And you make the door open from outside. Maybe better. Inside. So, if we put a bin there with water, it's okay. It's the room, yeah? Okay. Okay. Outside. It's not low. Outside is better, I think. No. But it's no nice. Doesn't matter. What if it's easy for you? I'm easy. That's a nice door. I need to go sideways there with my big belly. But that's good. Very good job. Excellent. Okay, I need to go back inside the house. We need the bed to be done for tonight. Okay, the mirror is here because I got Jason to drive it all the way before when we pick up the furniture. Slowly, slowly, we get things done. Tomorrow I'm going to try to bring my Kawasaki here. Maybe good. I don't know tomorrow. It's better going in the morning so it's not around. But it's hard. We'll see. Maybe we got tonight. Okay, let's go back to that bedroom. Sweet. What is the bed tonight? You finished? Okay. No, it's okay. She got her own thing. That's all you have to do. Oh yeah, it's here. Wait, wait, wait. James, helping build the bed. It's nice to see. She's here. So much easier for me. Okay, I'll do it. Don't worry. It's not that straightforward. Now that I've just seen, I've been just too much talk. Say back. Burned. It's areibtica. Oh, don't turn the bed. It's okay. Let me sit to read it. supportingmusic Yeah, there's a problem here. Ready! This was washed previously. Okay, done. I think it went too hard. First step so we can make steps. We couldn't go to the cooking. We couldn't really cook at home. So we're here at Sita in Deepo-Lox City. We came to pick up a few more things and relax. So tired. Bella and Joy. Oh, yum! Meatball, what do we have? Meatball pan-sits. Chopped soy, the sort of vegetable, and then some kind of meat. Beef? Okay. Personally, I'm not hungry, but mainly thirsty. They are righted. It's so hard to eat. I'm going to step well tonight. First night at the house. So she has to go into the kitchen. Let you know. Okay, apparently there's some bats hitting on the window. No, you're on the window. Doesn't worry me, but Jim is a bit scared. So you put your garlic. So, can't Dracula doesn't come here? It's okay, my love. Put it in. Put your garlic. You're gonna see, you need a little carton. So here's the garlic. I put it aside. Yeah. Not much light. I don't know if you're gonna see much, but...

There's no power, but it's not only here. It's also dipologue. It's a rule. I don't know what's going on, but it's every way. It's the whole province, I believe. Have a little breakfast, baby. You like it? Yes. You're gorgeous. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, she likes it. She doesn't like it. She loves it. Not sure what you're going to do today with this friend. Get the water tank base. We need to go back to the house to clean up up there and pick up whatever is left over. Here we are, the apartment. Try to clear everything. Almost all gone, but a lot of clean up to do. I had that. Good morning. Another day, another dollar to spend. This is our second day at the house. Still messy. At this, we can sleep comfortably. I slept so well last night. How about you, my love? Did you sleep well? Yeah, it's even cooler, you see. I don't need a car here. And our baby is watching cartoons. She loves cartoons. And I just finished doing breakfast. So I'm hungry. And I'm making a tea. So I'm the one organizing breakfast always. I suppose to go and pick up my bag today, but it's raining. So maybe pick another day or in the afternoon. It's been rainy every day. We had a brand out all the time. Every day, not just here, the whole Zambuanga. They fixed him, I don't know, they do a big fix, I guess. No power. I couldn't do any video. Beside it, I need to set up my computer, but I could put on a corner of the table and do my editing. But I just, no power. It's okay. I'm going to pick the old one. Yeah, a lot of cleanup to be done. And we just employ a guy to clean all the weeds. And what's the run star? We'll burn all that. So that's it for this video. There's a couple there. We haven't done anything. Just work and rest. That's it for now. I hope you enjoyed until the next video. Take care. God bless you all. Bye. Thank you.
