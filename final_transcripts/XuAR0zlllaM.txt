 Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines. Oh my gosh, it comparison video. We've done this with some European countries, but now I'm trying to do it with some of the biggest countries in Southeast Asia. Heck yes. These videos can be outdated, and they create quite controversy. They can be very biased, depending on who created it. And based on what we're seeing already on the screen. Let me show you what you guys really quick. That seems like we have some bias towards Indonesia. Already. Yes. The Philippines looks sleepy. Malaysia looks drunk. Yes. And Indonesia's like, oh, I'm perfect. He he. Yeah, there might be some bias in these. We'll just look at it from outside our perspective. Take everything with a grain of salt. Yes, maybe even an entire salt shakers worth of salt. Yes. We'll try our best, but hopefully you guys enjoy. Either way, it's just kind of an interesting to compare the countries just based on statistics. Obviously we know you can't really compare anything unless you go on the ground and do it. And that's what we do. We have actually, if you look at these countries here, we are currently residing in the Philippines. We've been here for tons of time. Vlogs on the vlog channel for that. And we went to Malaysia for a few days as well. Vlogs on the vlog channel for Malaysia as well. And guess what? Where we're going next. Indonesia. So all these countries are like places that we will soon be and will have a firsthand comparison of them. So let's see what this video says. Hopefully you enjoy. Subscribe if you do. Go. All right. So we see that. Malaysians are drunks. I like the tigers on the bay. I see. Wow. Indonesia's fracking base. It is. Oh, I can't see music. How intramurals in this park. A two-challenge. I don't know exactly where the picture is taken from. But that's the other story. Malaysia. National Day is June 12th. We won't be here for that. Oh, maybe we'll stay an extra 12 days. You see go to that. Constitutional public for all of them. Constitutional monarchy. Oh, yeah. That's crazy. Oh, massive. Oh, massive. 33 mil. I mean, and the density. Just we've experienced this residing here in the Philippines. The density is insane. It's insane. It's insane. It's insane. It's insane. It's insane. And it seems like Jakarta, which might be the place we're going to. Also, it's going to be quite dense as well. So we're curious to see what that would be like. Everyone seems so much more happy over in Malaysia. Look at that smile. Fiance became question. You know, indeed. Interesting that. Our Malaysia wouldn't have like multiple. Yeah, true. That is structure. A lot of young people in all these countries, especially in the Philippines. See them on the streets. Yes, there's a lot of very young people. And of course they're doing the working age or everything. So it's just a massive lump. You can't really see it. Like 15 to 25 is bigger. And then. Well, Malaysia's got a bump in those years. Yeah, and income. And then. And then. And then. And then. And then. And then. And then. And then. And then. that. Incamp and the poverty rates lower. But otherwise, Indonesian Philippines. Very similar. Reaching. Almost all. 50. I. I don't know. I guess there's so many different cultures in Malaysia. This is 14,000 IDR to one USB. It's not as much as the doll. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Malaysia is an export in the LAPO. The oil air pump in. I think it's the rain. Oh, these have big nodes now. There are a lot of people. Four tanks. But they have so many tanks. That would be very hard to use a tank in Malaysia. It's split up into what if they need to transport one of the tanks from the other way? Yeah, that's very interesting. The Philippines has a lot of aircraft. The Philippines has a lot of aircraft. For its. Yeah, it's got double Malaysia. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, you need to eat that. Wait, did that make me... Yeah, I did make that one. I think it's the best way to represent a national dish. Hi, hi, very high. Am I right? Oh, oh. There's Malaysia is so higher than I thought. Yeah, I think. People are saying it's so dangerous in the Philippines. And it's the lowest of all these. Now I'm scared to go back to Malaysia. Like it stabbed. That would be really scary. Look at how big those legs are. Pick them in the knee. Oh, Philippines. Oh, that worked. Oh, wow. I know, this whole apart had a lot of highways. But the size of Indonesia can't come close. 72. 383. All those islands. Yeah, what the heck. That's crazy. At least 62. That's a surprising amount. One big medal. Oh, we saw this. Oh, interesting. It's a... I don't know about the badminton. We knew the badminton Indonesia badminton. Oh, there it is. Badminton. I see a little basketball here. Or power something. Oh, I don't know. I didn't know was that high. That's really high. Is that better than the U.S.? It's like just about the same. The U.S. is like... It's very tribal. KL, one of the most good cities in the world. Yeah, much higher. Malaysian, much higher. And if that's true, which I feel like it's not for the Philippines. Philippines is the most social... Yeah. Online country in the world, they say. Yeah. That way lower than I would have expected it to be. I would have expected it to be at least 80s. Yeah. Interesting. Ah, rich people. Or stickers of high. Orc investment. That means they're really helpful for society. I think... What about that... Uh... Gerrera, Niana. Yes, she has an insane amount of followers. I mean, maybe this is just on one single platform. She has 30 million on TikTok. I don't know what they're based on this at all. Fake news. I mean, there's people on Facebook that we saw. Philippines was at like 20 million. Yeah, like what the heck? It's called the hills. Malaysia, that's obviously not as epic. All right, interesting. Very interesting. So, um, we are going to trust everything in this video to be completely correct. I know some of them were like, oh, that seems very wrong. Yeah, weird. But yeah, it's very interesting to see the comparison. A lot of it was like, oh, Indonesia's double the other ones because it has a higher population. Oh, makes sense. Yeah, I'll see. So anyways, hopefully you guys enjoyed another reaction. I compare someone if you have any other good or more updated videos. Let us know down in the comments below. Obviously, we know these videos are biased. Uh-oh. Incorrect at times, but also, some of you may be biased as well. So check your facts. People are biased. What? See you in the next one.
