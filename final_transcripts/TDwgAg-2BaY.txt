I have heard people say, especially in South Korean stuff when we went there, there's like this beauty standard like cosmetic skincare, plastic surgery. You see a lot of whitening cream. White underarms are the same. I'm guessing it's going to be something like that. Or it's going to be totally flipped on the head and it's going to be a video that's actually not bad looks.

I don't have to buy it in the TV commercial. I promote it in the Philippines. Because in the Philippines, the Philippines is the only one that we can offer. Because, what do you think? That's what I really like about Philippines. So, that's what we call it. Philippines, a hotspot, it's 12 finger cheap and I like that. Yeah? Just like in the Philippines. So there will be a lot more decoration. But eating dress is so ideal. It make you proud. But it's impossible for you to be irresponsible of the world. I'm so sorry. What are your features that you want? Simple and simple. And even without makeup, we would have a lot of fun. And curious. Why is it so? Because I'm talking about skin color. It's a lot of hair.

For more authentic insight into the latest. Very cool. That's amazing. That really does show the difference between some countries and what people... Is this thing of you want what you don't have? People from Britain, everyone wants to be tan. I have very pale skin naturally. My hair color kind of naturally gave me that. Because in my country, England, people with ginger hair like me are always pale. Generally, we don't tan as easy. So I'm naturally pale. And since being in the Philippines, I've noticed people always comment on my skin and how it's so nice and white. But when I was in the UK a few years ago, I'd be putting these fake tan products onto the pan and be darker and trying to be more like this color, like George. George tan quite easily. So George is also British, but there's different, obviously, genes and things. Yeah, of course. But even I try and be darker. I try and tan. I can't tan naturally. So that's why you think that. You look through filters on Instagram to make it tan. Yeah, it's so crazy. And also when one of the girls was saying that her ideal mix would be British. And she was like, oh, they tend to be more like better bodies and stuff. British people and stuff. But I guess that's so depended on my... That's so individual. ...any one. There's every type of body shape in the British. And you can work through a good body. Yeah, I guess white. I guess white is different. Maybe. I guess Filipinos are generally a little bit shorter than British. Yeah. I think our average is like five foot four for women. And I'm like five, eight or nine. I'm quite tall. I like the bit of the end where they said that real beauty is to do with the person, the intention of someone, the personality, the values. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, that's true. Nice, that's true. Let's have a look at some comments. So a few here. Sadly, Filipino beauty standards is to try and look as white as possible. That's got loads of likes. I hear a lot of English and Spanish words when we speak. In Filipinos, we consider that a guy at Hanson, if he smells good and has a proper hygiene, we consider it attractive. Yeah. I just noticed one thing that all smiling when they talk. So true. Filipinos smile. So maybe this is not very many Filipinos commenting. People from other countries that are known to think that they're... Yeah, who are like finding out about the Philippines and what people want and like. Interesting line.
