Breaking head Metro Manila the National Capital Region of the Philippines a bustling mega city yeah it is home for more than 14 million people. There's so much traffic yeah the Philippines Center for Finance commerce I cannot get over the architecture architecture and in these Asian cities I mean they're yeah we don't have like I mean we have crazy architecture but not in like so many different cities like it's like well we do we do we haven't gotten anything in a long time that's like outside of the what do they call it the one tower one that one was a huge feat that one is literally like 1,776 feet for the the declaration of independence was signed but beyond that I mean I mean they're just super edgy and modern yeah yeah I mean they they go above and beyond to make sure their stuff is I mean it pops yeah I've never meant education a driving force of the country's developing economy which account of almost 37% of the countries gross domestic product due to limited land area the country's national capital region is among of the most densely populated places Asian or most congested cities Asia and for the Philippines in an area of 619.57 square kilometers in effect traffic congestion and limited business expansion hamperes the potential growth of the region see this would be a place that you really want to live by the majority of places that you're going to be yes yes you want to live by the nicest restaurant and shopping centers and I have a stealing that's why they're big on big giant malls and things like that right so it's not as like you can kind of it's a one-stop shop type situation for them I'm sure so these in mind the national outside of gross the which they might have in the land reclamation within Metro Manila building another small city to expand its business district and to develop new core growth in the region today we will feature the biggest reclamation project of Metro Manila solar city Manila we reacted to the city Manila solar city is a proposed mixed-use development to be built on one hundred already away from the claimed land in Manila Bay it's insanely beautiful adjacent to the north of the cultural center of the Philippines complex and west of the Manila yacht club equipped with the latest technology with renewable and sustainable energy equipped that car just drives off yeah I saw that I think it's a part of the garage or something it's just like I'm really no building no floor though it just stand as a benchmark of today's center of the world and progress as part of Manila Cavidi Coast projects which consists of several reclamation projects envisioned several decades ago the reclaimed area will have three islands East Island 1 area A the closest to the Manila yacht club measuring 28.73 hectares East Island 2 area V 36.87 hectares and West Island area C one thing I'd be worried about is the the weather accessible from it's a modern city I'm assuming that they're going to like be a weather well yeah the city will be developed as disaster resilient yeah thank you for answering my question I'm a chef my mouth now I have an environmentally friendly city by using renewable energy such as solar wind and biomass all buildings will have its own solar panel to contribute the energy production while maximizing the wind energy all building will be designed to have an open ground floor to have a breathable corridors and wall of them that's dope by these the city layouts requires less air calling and conditioning providing a continuous green network the green corridors and walkways will also provide an uninterrupted view of Manila Bay's horizon all those people are so still I know it's like move area the lights green let's go an iconic bridge overlooking the Philippines first international cruise terminal with all those islands you think that would be sick that would be walkways for an exciting experience that would be really dope yeah I'm just curious of how they wouldn't like fry the fish underneath with the magnification yeah well there's a building I literally just watched about today I think or yesterday it's a building in London I believe that is bowed and it literally will melt cars if they part beside it no they're parked across like a distance and the shape of it causes like a wind tunnel but it's it puts so much heat like they've had adjust the building like a put different type of windowpane and stuff because it was literally melting like the sidewalk and the buildings and starting fires and burning up cars melting cars why would I imagine you know fish aren't just gonna sit under there well I'm talking about just the water in general just boil that in the water so I mean they might have it tended to a certain extent but or maybe some special glass that like reduces maybe like acrylic or something yeah but those still probably magnify oh well guess fish look weird like if you put your hand in water and yeah fish do look weird no I mean like if you put your hand in like an acrylic tank it still looks odd a spectacular seven star hotel complex with man-made beach is another attraction it's insane the city will also feature an effective intermodal system that aims to minimize the used of private cars there goes the public transports were designed to obstruct the traffic flow of the ground a fallacious a monorail system I like the monorail at Disney World by a duck transit system providing a safe easy and easy navigation around the so when I went to Disney World all the rides were stupid packed because I went right after Christmas and the only thing we rode the whole time was in Epcot I think that dome looking I love it it was like an educational ride and everything in Epcot is interesting yeah and so that was the only thing we rode in the three days we were at Disney World are you serious the lines were stupid long and you went during office well you went during it was right before New Year's yeah and so at night whenever to get dark outside and like everybody was asleep I'd ride the monorail that's funny so I just hopped on it and I'd ride it all around Disney World last time we went we went in January when it was cold here we went on a cruise but we stopped at Universal we didn't actually go to Disney World but we did Universal we wanted to go visit the Harry Potter place yeah yeah but it was like dead it was awesome because everybody back in school we were on vacation went on a five day cruise down to the Bahamas and stuff it was great I wish that we could have rode more trams also provide access to grids and buy a duck level for a smooth transport system in core developments the development will also be accessible coming from the Manila Bay to New Manila yacht club the new design for Manila yacht club is a perfect symbol of development for harmonious growth for a spire I mean everything that they're doing in this city looks like art yeah horizon reclamation Manila horizon Manila is an upcoming mixed-use planned community to be built on a 419 hectare reclaimed land so you notice how they they do the trees on top of the buildings right as the biggest breakfast across the street are there Philippines the city built on scratch do you see they're starting the work the rain started today west with long faces along the north south axis with a four kilometer long canal park as the main connecting feature in between the islands this urban valley recalls the settlement of Manila along the Pasig river and bolstered the idea of Manila as a city by the river it's like a small man yeah I say that but Manhattan is pretty small that is so the find the lives of all its residents that is so cool now part that not only connects the three islands but also provides horizon with a public park at its core that stretches all the way to the waters edge ensuring that Manila Bay sunset will be always belonged to the public a via that the monorail system allows direct access from Manila to the islands from the central station the trackless electric tram system move around the development and no place that's done yeah it is in a five minutes walk away from a tram station they're having a road will be tree line and will features eight meter wide sidewalks with those people look so fake that ensure shades in any form of weather the development emphasizes personal mobility yeah pedestrian and bike lanes and aims to a car because they are now I was waiting for that risk of a resident realistically they look pretty real yeah for what it is quite the opposite look at the random balloons they were they were hot air balloons yeah those ones like the bottom hot air balloons they're just chilling there and amenities to allow a diverse mix of entertainment for its residents such as pop-up galleries and that's the best of all arena Philippines man and most importantly the sunset view of the millabays put into consideration as well ensuring that this city called out it's called fashion and most importantly the sunset is that the St. Louis arch that's what it looks like you as a Manila Bay is put into consideration it's like a smaller version of it the St. Louis Arch is gigantic by people in the vicinity with little to no impact to viewers from that's actually world war one museum the next the next SM new Bay City the Philippines pearl of the Orient and Asia's rising tiger hoist for a new beginning a unique partnership of city governments national authorities and a private sector a vision of 726 hectare of reclaimed land to raise along 9.2 km of Manila Bay I'm excited to see all of this stuff go down creating a premier Asian destination in the Philippines a collaboration of the people government and enterprise in response to fast growing cities and rapidly modernizing economy grow baby grow designed by local and international planners and engineers it will provide a new home for 576 000 resident 924 960 jobs yeah 851 000 right outside of the major yeah the reclamation will play an important role in the growth of the that'd be dope place to live oh yeah it's a new dawn for the Philippines a truly global city that's so dawn that's a new day a new city to live sports and play promoting community central for realizing your dreams a green inclusive city with open spaces putting Philippines in our Hong Kong Singapore and Sydney with world class transportation network and a CBD with fast connectivity is a CBD CBD to the airport and to the metro the project will be developed with careful consideration surrounding natural habitats the reclamation is designed to international standards to withstand the strongest typhoon waves and surges within occurrence of once on a mountainous mountainous mountainous mountainous that would just be so insane though like those are going to have to be some strong buildings green signs of conditions wide canals to accommodate drainage one hopefully nothing like that happens is truly a milestone a unique model of collaborative development aiming towards unfortunately it's the world and you just kind of get to take you know I mean it's probably inevitable that it's going to happen one day yeah but it's just crazy it'd be really cool like something that they have like on what's that movie where they have the one day out of the year where they go and kill every like there's no the purge the purge but we're like these tall buildings that have like all these windows like they have the purge windows and those really rich people's houses where it's like oh that'd be cool it just shuts that so that it just puts a metal thing in front of the so the storm doesn't affect the actual windows yeah that'd be so cool that where Ironman Ironman with the amount of glass that is on all of these buildings if something like that was to happen that would be such an expensive but I'm sure that the glass is meant to hold up to like I'm sure it's like 150 miles wins it's just the debris that will be the issue hopefully again nothing happens providing the greater opportunities for the people the nevotus boulevard is hard the nevotus boulevard it seems like all of these are being made island yeah I don't know how to say that being made islands man made islands yeah here reclaim land and has been under construction since 2019 so when they say reclaimed lands does that mean like it was there and now they're just adding more dirt on top of it because it's sunk now I don't know I honestly don't know reclaimed that's what it said like reclaimed wood would be like used wood so what I'm thinking is is these are islands they're just under the water and so they're they're building it up if I'm wrong I'm sorry correct me please I've just never heard of a reclaimed island I haven't either I've heard of the only thing I can think of that I've heard reclaimed is wood because it's like real popular in the south right where they've just made the developer to stop to create a mixed-use community with residential institutional commercial that's a good thing yeah I'm assuming it won't be that translucent nice it was this like there was no floor yeah that's what I'm saying I'm sure they'll have stuff in there but they've made all these look like clothes yeah where that one is just an open cord on a big glass box they're gonna have flashing roads same RGB roads Novata's coastal Bay reclamation by Serbana Jura a Singaporean government-owned consultancy company focusing on infrastructure and urban development reclamation projects reclamation reclamation rec-wreck reclamation yeah you like that don't don't hop out of the video I'm sorry that's dope yeah that's something to be excited about those are for sure some huge projects I mean unless it's something that you're not actually looking forward to like if it is costing me a lot of money or yeah it's gonna cause because I don't know how owning homes in the philip the philipines is because usually when there's a big project next to you the people pay for it your taxes yeah your property taxes are gonna go up because the value of your property is gonna go up so you have to pay property taxes which a lot of some states don't have property right we just don't have state income tax so we pay high property tax and even if you live in an apartment like they're building a really nice multi-use like a resort across the street and so we're anticipating that the cost of our rent will go up because dramatically I hope not fingers crossed I'm scared yeah I'm very
