Right, today I'm wrapped into this video. Wake up in the Philippines! Well, apparently this is a tourism or the baddestment of Philippines. Well, I miss Philippines so much. You know, before coronavirus, sure, I won them many times like once a month. And I haven't been this in some of them, like, two years. If I remember correctly, which is so stressful, I want to go there. Asap, did I come into this video? Wake up in the Philippines! Well, thank you to make myself feel in like, you know, visiting there. So, it's good idea, isn't it? So, right here. Let's get into it. Oh, exciting! The mind. Today, I woke up in his story Pope properties. Where fun jades back to the 16th Century. Wow, that's so cool! He's a- Oh, it's cool! I don't- It looks so beautiful isn't it? Oh, that's like a Japanese Togay. You know Togay? Yeah, it's our traditional house. Oh, you guys have one too. That's so surprising. We get our thrills and a giant sand box. Wow, that's so fun. And spend all day playing in the water. Speaking of the Philippines, it's the sea. The adventures come by the hundreds. This is a place where time stands absolutely silent. Exactly, you get full of ketchup on time. Because you know time is all we can ever see too. Wow. Well, actually, I must have placed, I don't know. I woke up inside the fire. Colded era. Which area is it? With a painting dance with every brushstroke. I didn't know that there are beautiful mountains and works of art span from floor to ceiling. Wow. I witnessed masters at the craft who transform even the ordinary into exception. There is the original culture. Wow. Oh, well, what's that? It was like Japanese mochitsuki, you know this one. You know, we eat rice cake. This is to make it, you know, hitting by the woody hammer. Yeah, is that like that? Confections came in more colors than I could imagine. I wish I could have a half there. And a creative escape waited around every corner. Some original festival. Fire, or bingo, if you go. Oh, I don't know what some places. I woke up to my own adventure. Wow, looks so adventurous. I'm going to go on a adventure. Each page was different. Every chapter, a new surprise. Wow. What a beautiful world. What's that? I like what you can so much. You know, like a Japanese training. Trust my gut. Oh, so nice. Because here, the best travel plan is to make no plans. And just let life happen. Yeah, that's good idea. But I'm fortunate that I can do that. Because I'm so organized. I can't do that without any flying. Oh, let's see, it'll like, isn't it? I just woke up from the time of my life. Oh, yeah, Metramania. This is the most funnier adventure back. Did I got to meet the big shot? This is all square, isn't it? I found a sweet spot between cultures. And hug out with the arts. Yeah, I know. I even picked up a few things along the way. After that, things kicked into overdrive. And then I started with a world record. Yeah, I knew it. Not that it was the best way to find this area, isn't it? A celebration of labor in every bite. And an epik you part in every turn. And I'm like, I want to go stand the batting here. The good times are never over. I woke up while nature was so small. I woke up while nature was so small. What is it? It's like a caramba. At its kingdom. I stroked through its lush gardens. What a beautiful river. Every little wonder of clubs. Here, you can dance with giants. Discover a piece of art. Oh, interesting. There are many original festivals for the appetite of events. Well, I didn't love that. Walls that hold hero's stories told me of their bravery. Yeah, yeah. While St. Vincent was on track. I roamed places that stood the test of time. Oh, so nice. And others that went up to the beginning. What's the spirit shell view? It's a modern air. A clump spread over like a sea. Wow. Once I woke up in a hidden place. Hidden place. I like it. Where is it? I think I had ever seen. Wow. The twire. What's that? I wish I could go there. Wow. The birds, beaches, few had ever walked before. Fantastic. By the way, he's whispered their secrets. This place was my very treasure. It's Cuba diving. Yeah. So nice.

Well, we can't wait with you. I was sunlight at the moment. Oh, beautiful. Oh, so well, we can't wait with you. I was sunlight at the Okinawa in Japan. This place is much more beautiful. And you know, for the best adventure of your life. Oh, some French guys there. Yeah, they must stop how powerful. I just woke up in a non-stop action scene. You call, where is it? Wow, I have no idea what that means. You know, they call, but... Defying gravity one moment? Wow. To communing with giants. Oh, fuse. Fuse shop. And getting lost in the lights the next. Oh, must be good experience. You know, they only exist in that beautiful river, right? Wow. I really, really feel the heat. We finally regained our balance. And found an epic finale. So it is epic. Wow. Oh, beautiful. Wow. There is a black guy I always wanted to go there. This is one of the best places in Philippines. Ivan Paradise is now ready to welcome more local travelers. Yeah. Oh, it's sad that we got to wear masks in the result of the island, right? Wow. With strict health and safety protocols in place. In this age, it cannot be helped, right? Haha, that's self-famous place. All set for the tourist, you know? Yeah, that's the famous place should be. World famous white beaches. Wake up to a better Boracay. Welcome back.

And my appetite. Wow, another fruit. Oh, looks like a yakitori. Just like this famous food. Oh, where's it? You go either. Yeah, I know. Today, I always see us below the surface. Where I learned to face my fears. Yeah, every place has a beautiful safe, right? Nice. And so nice. Surfing. Of course. Beautiful sea has a beautiful animals. But it's when I came to appreciate the big. And the swell, finding a nimble, right? Wow. Made new friends from all over. And could no longer hide my true colors. That I knew I'd emerged a local. Wow. Sebu, yeah. Wow. Mountains good as well. You're right. I'm going to be a little bit more beautiful. I'm going to be a little bit more beautiful. Wow. I'm going to be a little bit more beautiful. Wow. Mountains good as well. It's a Philippines. I didn't know that. Where water is stronger than rock. So I learned to sit back and enjoy the ride. Wow. Get washed up on a deserted island. Wow. What's that room? So surprising. I can't believe the locals living history. Oh. Perhaps even find a hole in the wall. Wow. Soul spiritual place. Or discover a whole new world beyond top of. Oh my god. Mix me wonder where should I go? Where I should go? Wow. Today I woke up. Oh, another physical. Oh, beautiful. And a beautiful lady. Surrounded by mesmerizing patterns. Oh, another foods.

Is that traditional craft or something? Oh. Interesting. Minda no aela. Yeah. Famous. Right in the middle of the river. So, lots of nature there. It takes me to some pretty, I think. Oh, I'm kidding me. Can tourists out to do that without any license? Wow, I wanna try. I'm trying to hold. Just when I thought it was over. Wow. So adventurous. There was another thrill waiting around the border. And forever long, I stayed for the right. Yeah, well the whole. It's so awesome. Ooh. What's the island? Wow. Oh my god, so beautiful. I can't help saying that. Sobskagen. Sobskagen. Sobskagen. Sobskagen. Where is it? Oh. Tertishakrafts, isn't it? Interesting. Wow. What was that costume? So characteristic. It's like Kilt, you know, Scottish traditional costume. Wow. Yeah, agriculture is famous in this place. The people here are connected to the land. And everywhere you look. Hmm. Nice. Nice. It shows. Oh yeah, full of foods there. Wow. I wake up at a postcard. Every single. Shhhhhh. Wow. Beautiful sea and a beautiful lady. So much. Each corner a love letter straight from Cloudmine. Wow. The sun. It must be hidden place. There are very few people. Everywhere's an invitation. Yeah, I want to do surfing, but actually I've never tried it before. Yeah, if I do that, I think I'd be better to choose the Philippines to do the surfing for my first experience. Well, that was fantastic video. There are still many of your things that I didn't know. Actually, I've been to the Philippines many times, but I realised I didn't know that thing about the Philippines after I watched this video. Yeah, I know there are beautiful sea or beach in the Philippines, but you didn't know what they're like. You know, beautiful nature, fantastic foods, fantastic culture. You guys have tried to ask for Japanese what Philippines is like. I'm sure everyone different is like, you know, there is a beautiful sea. That's all, yeah, actually that's all. I'm telling you that's a truth. But no, that's no, that's wrong. They have many kinds of beautiful cultures, you know, traditional festivals or traditional crafts or, you know, fantastic foods. Many kinds of fantastic foods and rivers, mountains and forests. Those are really beautiful and fantastic. Each place has different original ones. This is what I was surprised to really in particular. Well, generally, I don't really like living foods, but I try to live in Rosalind Island only. So I will probably find a good food that I like later, maybe. And also, I always wanted to go to Black Eye because they said they have the best scene of the Philippines. But now I'm on the fence totally because, you know, I don't know that. I don't know the beautiful sea in the Philippines. So, yeah, so confusing, which part I should go next time. Well, I wonder when I can go there next time. Coronavirus settled down fast. Okay, that's it for today. Thank you for watching my video. If you like it, make sure to like, subscribe, please.
