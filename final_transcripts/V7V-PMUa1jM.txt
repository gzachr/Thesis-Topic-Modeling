 See you guys! See you! When did you come in? Up! Thank you! Guys, that was awesome! Good morning! My amputac, my buhai, Filipinas! This is my favorite type of sunny days. Blue skies with a little bit of patches of clouds. What a gorgeous one! We're taking a walk outside of Rockwell. And I'm going to do something for the very first time during the lockdown. I've never done this before. Let's see how it goes. See you guys! Thank you! Good day, guys! Thank you! Guys, that was awesome! Little, a few meters outside of the condominium. The guys are just picking bugs for the tree. I almost fricking got them. They were joking about $50 or $1. So I'm giving 50 pesos. 50 pesos, $50, isn't it, right? Actually, I'm not sure if I got that on recording or if they go pro mess something up, but they're picking some mangoes there. It's really cool, senior. And about one of them for $50 because this is $50. So I'll give 50 pesos, same thing, right? 50 pesos, $50. Right? Look at that tree. Look at that tree. Wow! As you can see, there's cars, people everywhere. Super busy. A lot of people are outside. But everybody's wearing a mask, so that's good. Pulleys over there. But I want to go to the corner there. That's where they sell all the mangoes. Or fruits. So let's go buy some fruits. No mask, no entry. 5 pesos. 5 pesos. Oh, sorry. It's a very crowded area, but it's nice. They have a sign that says social distancing. That's a bakery shop. Hello. Come inside. It's okay. No mask, no entry. Oh, I like these ones, guys. This is good. Buy something here. Only 500, man. Thank you. No mask, no entry. That's awesome. We got a banana look. Alright, let's walk back to Rockwell. That was a fun trip. My brother back home in Iceland is electrician. I sometimes send him a picture of my cables like that. That's telling. Hey, try to fix that, bro. Oh, no, my glass. Look at my glass. It keeps my leg off. He knew glasses. Now during this lockdown, we haven't gone outside at all, except going to the groceries. That's all we can do here in Sipo. But I wonder how my skin color is. I'm usually pretty white, but I'm probably like a ghost right now. We got the manga boys. Manga boys. We got what he had brought earlier. Let's take one up for the truth. Yes, the bamboo manga stick. And they got a gun. They got a gun as well. Manga boys. For you guys, for my guards. Yes, banana look. Probably a bakery. Thank you. Alright, let's go back. Okay, let's go back. Okay, let's go back. Okay, let's go back. Alright, let's go back. Oh, hello. Yes, always vlogging. I miss the heat a lot. Even though it's just walking outside a little bit, I feel like I've adjusted immediately. But while you're inside all the time, with the aircon on and you go outside, you feel like, oh, it's so freaking hot, I can't be outside. It's got to get over that threshold. Walk around a little bit, spend like 30 minutes, 60 minutes outside. Then you get over it, then you'll love the heat. And when the breeze comes in, oh, that is magical. Wow, what a fun day. Let's go back up. Hello. A temperature check. Oh, 575. 37.3. Thank you. We're good. No fever. Look what they did also in the elevator. I guess they can only have four people at the same time. One, two, three, four. Cool. We got manga. Lots of manga. But I failed them a bit, I have to be honest. Yeah, I failed. Yeah, I failed. What was it? Naaah, manga. Oh, I said, anana, nana, manga, think. Naaah, mangah. He did not understand that which is 100%. Naaah, mangah. However, I got mangah from the mangah, boys. Just outside. Yeah. It's dead from the tree. It was guard, right? Yeah, little bit down the street. Look, it smells delicious. It's a flamingo. Yeah. A flamingo though. They said only $50. $50? Yeah, give 50 pesos. $50.50 is same. What? $50, $2500. This is $1,50. That's what I said. And like usually, Operation Cleanup once we get a site, I want to take everything off, shower immediately. Oh my god, guys. Look what came into the mail. You know who is that for? Jigs, hell, bit. Okay, we got to feed a little bit better. And to see you. Jigs. You see me here? Come on. Yeah. You got it. Wow, you ready for the motorbike? We're going together. Wow, that one smells good. Wow. That smells really good. Okay, I have a question for you. Can you make your mouth? Mmm. You said lunch, but we want to have a dessert, something sweet. The best. Okay, what did you say to the vendor? Anamanga. Naamanga. Which is obviously not correct. I was supposed to say naa. Naa. Naai. Naai. Say anamanga. Yes. Maka pa. Again, again, again. I give naa. I'm the vendor and you're the one asking. Okay. Naa. Maka. Naa. Pila. Oh, one 20 ang kilo. Maka pa. Maka pa. Maka pita. Manga. So. Maka palito. No, palito. How palito? Yeah. Maka palito is in Tagalog. Okay, what much time? Ten. Tag two. May you put a cast. May you put a puto. Naa. Amanga. Naa. Pila. And one 20 kilo. Oh, Maka pita. Pila is cold. Palito is cold. Palito is cold. Pila is hot. It's hot. It's hot. Take a four day four again. May you put a cast. May you put a puto. Naa. Amanga. Naa. Pila. One 20 ang kilo. Pakalit. Pala. Pala. Pala. Ah. It's hot. It's in palit. Palit. Why is this like... It's too bad. Take five. Take five. It's too bad. May you put a cast. May you put a puto. Naa. Amanga. Naa. Pila. One 20 ang kilo. Palito. Oh. Okay. Pila kilo. Is that... One kilo. Hmm. Half a kilo. Okay. Good. What... I'll show you the best way to open up the mango. If you cut it and open it, I feel like you're not using all of the mango. But if you peel it up like a banana. Just like that. I feel like you are consuming most of the mango. Okay. Lamy. Mase. Masarabla negayo. Good. Mine. Try it. All right. Today is the 24th May. There's only a week until they start transitioning to the G.C.C. So that's it. Thank you, manga boys. Outside. If you watch this video, and then I'll start. Peace out.
