 But you're Friday. The freshest. The world moves fast. But nothing moves faster than TikTok in the bloody Philippines. There's so much shit going on all the time and we're here for it. Woo! I'm watching this tutorial. How to be more energetic on camera. So you get more views. I'm only joking. Look, this has happened, idol Philippines and you guys keep sending us this video. Actually, more actually, he keeps sending it to Walucha who now has 15,000 followers on TikTok. But it's the famous now. Guys, but it's the famous now. If you don't want to say hello to me in the mornings. You know, try to do something good morning because if you have 15,000 followers on TikTok. Anyway, so get a balance and I'm going to the top of the gym. And shit, I'm going to the top. What's the word? My what? Bernie. They're Bernie. I love Virginia's laughing her way. What the hell's happening? Don't touch my face. All right, nice. Thank you. What the hell guys? Don't touch my face. No, back home. Bernie means. Is late. What? When the drummer of bass is late. Oh, fuck. No, Bernie. Does this motherfucker have a secret hand? Like a third just comes out of his belly button. And he's like, that's the one that's doing the tongue. Because I have a fuck. You got something up. Imagine his hand. This guy's guitar here. And then he's like, hold this on. Hold this on. And then he's like, what the fuck? How can he do that shit? And also, what are the other things that make me off? I'm telling you, if I had that voice, dude. It's pretty impressive. I'm not going to lie. I'm a little bit like, whoa, I don't know where all those sounds are coming from. This is a karaoke relay. I think her hair is perfect. Look, so they're in a school house. Bless you. For the listening, I'm going to write up first. Oh, they do it the relay. Yeah, that's what I just said. Oh, what the hell? There's some resonance. I love her voice. I lost my rivals. Holy shit, he's good. Okay, no. Can I just point out this fucking video's ridiculous. No, no, listen, listen. This is not easy, bro. This is not easy. How hard is a skill? You know, I can't do it. What people don't understand is that this is actually quite good level of singing. It isn't just that they can hold a tune and they can do maybe back and vocally stuff. Not like that. They can be us. These motherfuckers are soloists. Yes. My anxiety levels, if I had to be one of these relays, is like the opening line is like, oh, that's good. The second girl comes in and is like, oh, that's really good. And then there's the first guy and he's like, oh. Yeah, but he chose fucking violence, bro. And then they come to my turn and I'll be like, like, jokes on pain and misery, you know? Because you wouldn't. Why? You wouldn't. No, you wouldn't. I would. I would because I don't get nervous for stuff. I don't know why I think that bit of me is missing. So what you see me doing this karaoke relays stuff? Yeah. Most likely, oh, fucking yes. But, you know, just, I'd like to try it once in my life. We're definitely trying it. We're back to the beginning of the line, okay? Okay. I'm here, though. She has so much presence. We're such a good boy. You're a good boy. She has so much presence. We're such a good boy. You're a good boy. She's got so much confidence, the straights. I'm waiting for that guy with a big shirt, though. Okay, just wait before it, before he comes in. I just have a question. Do all my Filipinas out there? What the hell are you using your hair? What type of product? Sorry, this girl's using... I meet them in my life. They hair growth, the silkiness, the perfect movement. They look like those... It's like a shampoo add. Yeah, they look like a pantain. Pantain. Pantine. What is it called? Pantain. Head and shoulders. I'll just use another competitor brand. You know, because by the hair... They hair that we're putting into the motion, he's always shiny. And he looks like that. Yeah, maybe it's just... I don't know. Where is it? Yeah, maybe it's just the humidity, the air thing, so... Is it my hair? I need it in my life. It's just summer, so humidity here in London. Shit. I want that. You get all puffy all the time. Yes, very frisk. Step outside. Yeah, you've become a walking portal. What is it do that? Oh, they did my brother dirty. Next. All of a sudden the line starts. It was so... This respect. I like her. The most difficult parts of the song, the least people you see in the line. Yeah. It's like Colors of the Line. Retreat. A part mission. That's what I'll do. Just what I'll do is I'll just make sure we're doing something I can do. Like, in general games. In general games. In general games. In general games. Hello, general games. Or, give, general. You know, general games? It's also quite a good one. It's also this other song. I really like it as well. I think the artist is general games. Literally. Wow. Wow. I like her. Yeah, literally. I love how she went. I think also. Because you see the environment. Like, put that up. Work, work. It's such a good song. It's such a good song. Like, in that environment, right? You're sort of... You had dinner, you had your lunch or whatever. You had your dinner. You had your sort of family and stuff. And then, they just, you know, let's bring out the karaoke. You know, it's sort of normal. It's tradition. So everyone does it. And then you're sort of singing. But then you put your chair a bit more forward and everyone sort of watches. And you're not even looking at the people watching. You're just, you know, so sort of focused on this thing. I feel like that song or the people that decide to do this. They need, is that an outlet? Like, this chick, bro. She must have been going through something. Because to sing... What? Yeah, bro. Because to sing this song. Through the fire. Exactly. To sing this type of pan-grap koan in the Ginkart. Like, especially the ones you see, like... What's the ultimate heartbreak? Like, the heartbreak song. The tonalang. No, the ultimate. Oh, the ultimate. It's probably Rosalina. I kid you know, it's probably Rosalina. Rosalina. Thank you so much. Because she has so many hits. She does, I agree. You know, so many that I was, oh, I love her song. Who is it, Rosalina? Oh, well, I saw who is it. Oh, it's Everage. It's Rosalina. You're like, what the fuck? Yeah, okay. I want to drop her text. Please. Please, let's get her on. I love it. Like, what does it feel like to have every fucking karaoke song in that song? In that book, be yours. You know what I mean? Yeah, I think you're going through some shit, like... Like, maybe you had a shit there at your work. Maybe you just... You know, you're falling in love. Maybe you... I don't know. But dude, that shit... Look at this, right? Why is falling in love with that thing? No, no, I'm not saying about it. But you're going through something. This is coming from somewhere. Wow. I'm going through... Darling. Darling, mom! Did you see that? Yeah, that's what I said. She was like, okay. Well, if you like to try guys in any of your videos, or perhaps any videos that are popping up popping up at the moment as we can realize it's becoming like a weekly series now.
