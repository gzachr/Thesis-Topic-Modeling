 We're gonna do some crazy on the channel. We're gonna listen to some Filipino. Oh, not rock. Filipino metal. No, no, no, no, no. Filipino clasp. No, that's classical. Rap. 187 mobs does. We don't die. We multiply. See the wicket clowns? Wicket clowns? We don't die. Oh boy. So this song is like 15 minutes long. So everybody turn on your fireplaces and pull up a hot cup of chocolate and marshmallows or or polish your glocks and start to load them. It's up to you guys. This is gonna be the first for us. We never listen to rap from the Philippines. And I'm trying to incorporate a little bit more hip hop into the channel to expand our fan base. I would like everybody to watch our channel. Even you. I don't watch our channel. You're a prick. No. No, no, sorry. You know what? I just venture to say that for me it's more about expanding my horizons because as you so astutely pointed out last week when we're recording that we sort of do kind of have a bubble that we kind of exist within. We need a break free. I want to break free. So maybe this will be a start of something really fresh. Why did that fucking okay? I don't know. I give up. Why? Chubs. Hey, Chub. Yeah. You have one eye. You took Chubs's hand. Oh, that's probably not the same Chub. Alright, Chub man bat. That's probably a man bat. Oh, I'm sorry. I miss red that man of it. Manabat. Manabat. I don't know. Alright, can we just get on with the video? Yes, we shall press on. 76. We know it sounds like fat music. That dude had the same watch I did. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. I didn't expect that to his voice. What? I didn't we don't have to keep ours and I was just going to say I didn't expect that to his voice to be like like kind of like softer and lighter right now. He's like it's kind of like he has like the bone thug sound. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I do like. Oh. Oh. Oh. Hey, shut up. I can't understand the word he's fucking saying. Alright, well then let's continue. It's in a different language. Probably Filipino. I get that. But I'm just going to explain this. It doesn't freaking matter. No, because it flows. It sounds cool. I've always said that about bands before. Remember the very first like anyway rap song that I ever heard that was in a different language was the link when habits. Right. And that sounded fucking cool. I still have that song on my phone just like this. Tray Steli Quente's. Yeah, that was cool. Who was the other Filipino? Didn't we listen to was that Hayop? That was the name of the song wasn't it. Hayop was the name of the song but hit me in the mouth. Hit me with some funny shit. No. Oh fuck I was waiting for it. I know the strato. That's who it was. Yes. See? You didn't even have to hit me. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Holy shit. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

BI'I G.isco I'm just like a dude I work with. So that looks just like a dude that I worked with. Yeah, this one's cool. Yeah, I'm just like a dude I work with. Yeah, I'm just like a dude I work with. Yeah, I'm gonna give you guys that are watching words some word of advice. Don't go on that alley. That guy's from South Chicago or something he looks pissed. They all look pissed. Look at him. That guy's wearing a mess and they got a lot of guns. Oh, my. Holy fuck, dude. I need to breathe there after that one. That guy was intense just for how short of a segment he had. He was all up in that guy's face like, chase skills. Hey, that was a good pause. He looks like Steve O from Jackass. Let's see what this dude's got to offer. Hey, but that last dude when he was wearing I have the same lucky red shirt that that guy's got. I think it's hard to pick who's my favorite. I can't even tell you half of the names. The names are flashing by so fucking quick. You think that they'd have it up there for like at least a second longer. Okay, let's see if Steve O. I'm gonna search for that brown biscuit music or whatever he said or records or studios. Whatever the dude's t-shirts said. One of them. Yeah. Okay. What was that? Oh, so I like that dude's voice that guy's cool so are these rival gangs all in on the same track I don't think they necessarily rivals. I don't know you mean you got guys dress up blue guys dress up black guys dress some white guys dress and red guys dress and pink guys dress and green Chicago where the met's from is that New York? Yeah dogs and cats living together mass hysteria so someone's gonna have to you know let us know what the hell's going on here they're all they're all they all put aside their differences I don't think they're actually rivals they could be like good gangs where they just literally protect their neighborhoods good gangs where they I want to oh I need an energy drink but like maybe they go like donate to like you know the sick children and stuff they go to the they work at the church and everything and they're like like ushers and they help see people and if they're loud in church they just they give them you know just keep things orderly you know what? Oh no I'm not gonna go get an oil change there look at that guy he's like whipping his dick out like what's he gonna do back there? Oh wow all right I mean that didn't seem like 14 minutes long some of the guys in there I was like okay you kind of suck but most of them I mean they all okay I just wasn't as good as the other guys there's some dudes in their man that's tricky to try to phrase that but some people like don't like the fast rapping guys you know but what they did I thought was good was the way that they mixed the fast with like the slower and the melodic if you want to calm slow right they kind of broke it up yeah yeah that's their wild and they went to the more gave you a chance to have a breather in there okay all right well thank you for the recommendation that was one of the first ones that some of you recommended that yeah that wasn't I mean go for that sure okay yeah because I asked people you know put me up with some rap that's one of them so you know what that means now then we will have to take it upon ourselves to actually rewind that video find the names of the guys individually that's what we're gonna have to do no they gave this video to us in good faith hey and that we retreated accordingly somebody somebody is going to don't hit that why would you hit that because I see if their names are in here watch this ah they're all links 1 8 7 lapses you got spiker they got cosmala gamula puat ah caliboy records shoot to nougt cosmala okay yeah that's that's no all right so you get the point yeah so we're gonna go hey but you know honestly though without music I would feel all alone without you I would feel all alone and without all of you we would feel all alone so thank you very much for hanging out with us I like some x or something it's better with you all right we gotta go
