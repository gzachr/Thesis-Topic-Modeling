Just, unfortunately, I will be replying to all of your comments and your DMs on my social media accounts. So without further ado, let this video started. Manila, the capital of the Philippines. So that is the Mall of Asia, one of the largest of the Philippine malls. And that is the Mall of Asia Arena located in Pasay City down to Metamanila. So as you can see, there are so many buildings and roundabouts in Mall of Asia Arena. And that is the University of San Dota Mas, our University of St. Thomas. Yes, pregnant from wrong, sorry if I stayed it wrong. This is the Philippine Arena. Actually, this is in Bolac√°n and it is not located in the Philippines. So it means there are some errors, but this is not located in Manila. So that is the oval. So in this video, I will be saying that what is the location or where is the location of this particular... We can see on the videos about Manila. And this is the Makati. As you can see, there are no electrical lines on the side of the roads. And it is look very clean. And this time, I think this was filmed before the pandemic. And there are a lot of Chinese nationals living and working in Makati. And that is our MRT. Sorry, that is our MRT. Sorry, our metro rail transit number three located in Edsa. And this I think is Makati or BGC, which is the BGC or one of our business districts in Manila. As you can see, there are so many lights and there are so many buildings there. And the lights are looking good. Next is Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia. Look at the roads, it is well-faved. And there are some trees beside on the road and there is the main island and run about in this location. So I have watched about Jakarta versus Bangkok. So you can watch it here and just click it after the video. Please watch this video first before you enter the Bangkok versus Jakarta comparison video. As you can see, there is no traffic. Like it is an expressway. And it really looks good. This is one of the Jakarta's business districts located in Jakarta. Look at the roads, guys. There are no cracks. It is just well-faved and very clean looking. And they have a bus transit system on the right side of the lanes. So that is a good form of transportation. Which is fastened up the destination time to your dedicated location you want to travel. And this is one of New stadiums. I have saw this on my past video on Bangkok versus Jakarta in the stadium is Yomongguz. And this specific scene, it is very amazing. Look at the sidewalk, it is very spacious as you can see. Like so many people can walk beside and here. And there are only few people walking. And I think this is their MRT subway. And it is one of highly technological advancements when it comes to the subway system. And that is Jakarta when in nighttime. And it is very amazing. The sea of the lights and the condominiums and buildings and the cars and the roads. Just everything lighting as you can see is amazing. Wow, so basically this is it. So guys, I am done watching this video of Manila and Jakarta 2020, the capital of Philippines and Indonesia. So in this video, it is a comparison video I guess. We don't really compare on this. In this video, we will be getting to know each other's countries, capital cities and amazing buildings, tapasians, roads, transportation, cars, buildings, etc. So many. And then Manila and Jakarta is an amazing capital city in both of the countries. And both cities have unique nest with it. And it has different levels of urbanization and development that is occurring in our cities, specifically to our countries, Indonesia and the Philippines.
