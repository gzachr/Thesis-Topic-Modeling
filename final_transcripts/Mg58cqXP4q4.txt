 Okay, so today we will find out what foreigners in the Philippines, I'm guessing foreigners that live in the Philippines really think of Filipino people. It's another street interview. Yes, sir. And I say another because a few weeks ago, I reacted to a street interview of my boy, Calvin Castiel, whom I did an interview with. Yes, you can check it out and find it on his channel. But the difference between his video and this video is that his video was him asking foreigners who traveled to the Philippines, mostly for the basketball world cup. But here it's actually foreigners who have been living in the Philippines. So they know more about the Philippines and they will be able to tell us what they think about Filipino people. You know what I'm saying? So yeah, this is exciting. If you are new to the channel, welcome, welcome. Manigayang Pagabalek sa Akhi in Channo, Aqabuzio Vela. I am a sound engineer, beat maker and content creator on YouTube. And with that being said, let's jump right into it. Hi, what's your name? I'm Sophie. And yours? I'm Marcus. And where are you guys from? We're from Denmark. We're from Denmark. We're from Denmark. We're from Denmark. We're from Denmark. We're from Denmark. We're from Denmark. We're from Denmark. We're from Denmark. We're from Denmark. We're from Denmark. We're backpicking at the moment for eight months. Eight months. We've been here now. Almost a month. A month. I see you get your bags packed. Are you leaving somewhere now? Are you going back? Yeah, we're going to around the airport, an area called the Macdan. Okay. We're going to stay there for a couple of days before we fly to Porto Pensessa. Oh, very nice. I'll need a crown area. That's beautiful. It's beautiful there. It's really, really nice. Yeah, it's really nice. Have you had a chance to speak to Philippine people? Yeah. Of course. A month. Yeah, they're very sweet and kind. Very open. Okay. So when I get to the Philippines next year in May, I will have the opportunity to stay approximately three weeks in the Philippines. Very nice. And what about yourself? Anything different? I feel different. Okay. I feel different. Okay. Excellent. Thank you so much for your time. Appreciate it. Thank you. Hi. What's your name? My name is Rotterrey. And where are you from? I'm originally from Buffalo, New York. I live in Hawaii right now. Okay. And what brings you down here to the Philippines? I mean, just to get away from Hawaii and the high prices, you know, you can't beat the exchange rate here. Food is good. Yeah. People are pretty real real friendly. Tell me a little bit about the people. Have you had a chance to interact with any locals? Yeah, I have. Basically some of the staff at the hotel and some people. Some of them are good by men here. They are well-mannered, well-friendly. Well-mannered? Well-friendly. Real, real nice. You know, he did talk to, well-happy, hang up, survive, anything like that. For sure. Do you ever feel like concern for safety or anything around here or anything? No, no, it's pretty much. I read up on the area before I came here. It's basically pretty, pretty safe. The main thing is people here, they basically speak English. Even as a broken English. It's a huge plus. Not like some other country where you just don't know anything like that. Yeah, so my friend and my brother and I are not worried about the Philippines at all. You know, because yes, they do speak English. And, you know, I've been reacting to Filipino content for years now. So I know what to expect from the Philippines. I'm still hoping to be surprised here and there, but we will see. But we're not only visiting the Philippines, we're visiting Japan and Vietnam. So yeah, we're a little bit worried about those two countries because they don't speak English. You know, it's going to be tougher to move around in those countries compared to the Philippines. Thailand, if you're going to province of the Royal Air, is she? You're done. I agree. So you've been to Thailand? Oh, yes. Okay, and there's no difference between the two countries so far during your stay. I have, I have. I travel all over Southeast Asia, you know. And I thought about retiring, you know, the only difference is Thailand and here. See, I mean, the guy enjoys Southeast Asian countries so much that he thought of retiring there. That is amazing. Here is the country's built up more and they have more medical facilities for you compared to here. Because if you decide to retire here, you live out in the province. See, which is crazy to me that he's saying that they have more medical facilities in Thailand compared to the Philippines because Filipinos are known to have a lot of workers that work in hospitals, you know, and clinics and stuff like that. Like a lot of nurses, you know, and doctors. So it's a little surprising to me. You might have a problem if you're trying to need medical assistance. Not like in Thailand, you have hospitals and everything all the way. Well, hopefully none of us have to experience that anytime soon. Yeah, but it happens to happen, you know, you gotta be prepared, I guess. Yes, yes. All right, man, thank you so much for your time. I appreciate you too. And I'll tell everybody in Toronto. I'll say hello to Ronald. Oh, Mary body. So the interviewer is from Canada. Let's go. Hey, we are pretty decent people as well. We are welcoming, in my opinion. Hopefully I get a chance to see the cab, but cab, Anna. Okay, yeah, sure. Maybe you're here. Maybe, you know, except for the COVID time. Yeah. So we don't know how that's going. Okay, your bills, Finn? Oh, wait, 100%. What are they going to want to championship? This year. This year, all right, got you. That's a good one. Good. She's wiggling for you, my man. All right, thank you so much for your time. Appreciate it. Hi, what's your name? What I'm Sean. Where are you from? I'm from Tasmania. Tasmania. I thought that was a cartoon, no? That was a cartoon character. That's a real place. It is. Yeah, just below Australia. Amazing. I'm just kidding. Of course, Tasmania sounds wonderful. What brings you down here to the Philippines? Just a holiday. Just a bit of a relaxation. Yeah. Sure. How long have you been here? I've been here a week. A week? That's not a lot. I love to know what you like so far. No week. The people. The people are amazing. Being always happy, always smiling. Always willing to do something for you. Yeah, they're perfect. Yeah. Okay, and how many more days are you going to be here? I'm here for another 10 days. All right. Sorry, little looking forward to it. So when Si Buu Nga, do you plan to visit any other islands or anywhere else or the Si Buu? No, just a boot. I've been, I've done a few tours and I'm not entirely enjoyed them. Especially the Kenyaneering and the whale sharks were great. Wow. I got to do that. I got to do that. I'm starting up a bit of sun and just relax. Have you had any chance to try Filipino food? I have. Yeah. What do you think of it? A bit different. Yeah. But yeah, easy to, it's very nice. Yeah, very nice. Very nice. Very nice. You should have living or retiring. Oh, definitely. Yeah, come and retire. And I should settle in with an old school. And the climate. Yeah. I'm going to say how the climate is pretty here. Settling with a nice little bit of, and the Philippines. I'm telling you, it's fairly colder than here. And I'm looking forward to it. It took me a few days to sort of a tolerance. Yeah. Easy to get. Easy to get used to. Thank you so much for your time. No worries. You have a good day. Hi, what's your name? Italy. And where are you from? Italy. Italy. Italy. And why are you in the Philippines? Because in Italy, it's too much to fit the woman. It's very, too much difficult. And very complicated. Yeah. I hope it's. So he's basically saying that in Italy, it is too expensive to take care of the woman. Right? Wow. It's easy. Yeah. I don't know. Things are cheaper in the Philippines. Are you here to meet a friend, a girlfriend, a woman? Are you here by yourself? Am I still allowed? No. And I said, come on, it's the Philippines. And how long have you been here? To come out. You've been in the Philippines for two months. Okay. Did you talk to many Filipino people? Or perhaps he was joking about the difficulty of feeding a woman in Italy. Think of the Philippines. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Think of the Filipino people. But for now, I think I'm fairly, want to speak. But I think it's good is very quiet. Yeah. It's soft, and always good. The people are there. Awesome. Thank you so much for your time. I appreciate it. Thank you. Very strong accent. Hi, what's your name? My name is Werli. And where are you from? I'm a lot of people. And what bring you down here to the Philippines? I'm a bit of holiday. And maybe you can add to the retire here. How do you like the rain so far? Rainy season, right? It comes in cool. Yeah. You know, for sure. How long have you been here? That's interesting, eh? How the, let's not elderly people, but let's just say the, you know, the men between, I don't know, 50 and 70 years old. They contemplate retiring in Southeast Asian countries, man. A photo month. What are your thoughts about the Philippines? What do you like the most in a month? I like the people. Yeah. They're probably the earliest people in the world. I'm going to ask about the people next, but I'm glad you mentioned it. Is there anything specific? Everybody keeps saying that people are the best. Well, well, there. I never thought, because before I said Canadians were the nicest people. Yeah. Let's go. I'll just use this. I'm a runner. Honestly, I'm here, runner race. And after the rain, you know, the streets here. I get kind of, like, I took off a spill. Oh, no. I don't know anybody yet. All types of people ran over the check on me. I was fine. Wow. I took people checked on me. Yeah. That's amazing. I can tell you a lot of time in the West people might just walk by. I like to, I can get by a car on a sidewalk. Wow. Nobody can. Nobody can. Yeah. And now it's very different over here. Like Canadians are known to be nice, but usually you have to spark a conversation or something. I find the Philippines a lot of people take the initiative by smiling or saying hello. Oh, yeah. They smile all the time. I say hello. It's just brilliant. Okay. I'm going to mention about maybe possibly. Yeah. Filipinos are kind and very helpful. I remember either reacting or just watching a video of this foreigner as well who had, he thought he had lost a backpack that contained, you know, some valuable items. So random Filipinos just really offered to help him out and they did, you know, they did. But the thing is he had misplaced his backpack. I think it was in his apartment or hotel room or whatever. But the point is that random Filipinos tried to help him, you know, which is unbelievable. Tyrone here. Do you have any specific locations in the mine? Have you been anywhere? That's my hard part because I would like to check out like the bow. He says the bow. I've been told that. The bow. The bow. Halloween. Halloween. Yeah. Sure. But it's so many places. I don't want to, you know, I could live in so good. Yeah. You know, Manila is way too crowded. I've never, I've only been to a BGC for a few days. So I'm not very experienced by Manila. But it's... Most people are asking me to stay in BGC when I stay in Manila. Because yes, I will try to stay in Manila for a few days, you know, so that I can check out a bunch of things. Like the wish bus, hopefully some concerts, maybe see some people. So BGC apparently is the place to be. I hope it's pretty easy to rent like, I don't know, like a small apartment for a few days. Toronto wants to have really... Yeah, another major city that's like busy, busy, right? But it's pretty, pretty traffic. I hear it's like some of the worst in the world from Manila traffic. Well, yeah. You know, I thought about getting a scooter here. Yeah. Might be risky, right? In Manila, in no way. All right, now do you have any concerns about health insurance? How do you like stay up to date with that stuff in case something does happen? Well, I have travel insurance. Okay. I mean, that's a smart thing to do. What about your like relationship status? Are you seeing people? Are you seeing people? That's personal. For me, just because I don't know if you're familiar with little people. I'm not really familiar, but maybe you couldn't help us all out with the little lost stuff. About what? About dating? I'm going to stay here. I get everything needed for it. Oh, I see. I see. You can have intense... The lots really build for the Philippines. I see. So if you know from what I hear, they all want to move in with you and all that. Once you move in, anything you look for, I don't know the timeframe. Yeah. It's kind of like they get part of it. So if you're going to buy a condo, you buy the condo before. Got you. So buy everything before your relationship. Just think things that doesn't go well. Yeah. It's after. Okay. I don't know the timeframe, but that's the kind of stuff. Some thinking they're talking about doing things prior to getting married in the Philippines. I think that's what they mean. It's not very clear. But do I think that's going to help them? That happens everywhere, right? Yeah. But I think people need to just be aware. Definitely. I mean, it's just like it's not, but it's just like any place out. Yeah. Got it. I will thank you so much for your time. You're very informative and helpful. Thank you. Hi, what's your name? Scott. Scott, where's the front? It's Filipino Santa. Philippines. I just come for a bit of a look around. See what's happening. Are you working right now? Are you retired back home? What do you do? I work. Thank God. I'm not. I have a cattle proper. A cattle farm must be a lot of hard work. Oh, yeah. It's pretty cool, right? I would love to know your experience in the Philippines. What do you like about it so far? I really like it. Yeah. You know, just going around seeing things, trying to get in hell of people. Speaking of the people, have you had a chance to interact with any locals? Yeah. What do you think of the Filipino people? They just think it's wonderful. Quite surprising. Is this a place you can see yourself retiring? Absolutely. Of course. How's the cost of living here compared to Australia? I think it's fast. Yeah. Look, right. A lot cheaper. Your money goes a lot further, right? Yeah. Yeah. Thank you so much for your time. I appreciate it. Good on you, man. All right. So clearly, the thing that came back the most often are the people. The people, the people. They are kind. They are helpful. I don't think they said polite, but I know that they are polite. So it's the people. Everything all these videos have been promoting about the Philippines. They always talk about the people and their kindness. And it's true. It's true. So there you go. It was a fun, quick video. Although the audio was not great. Unfortunately. So I hope you guys don't have too much trouble hearing what they were saying. So yeah, let me know in the comment section below your thoughts. Marami, marami, salam al-Boh. And of course, if you found value in this video, do not hesitate to check out my other reaction videos right here.
