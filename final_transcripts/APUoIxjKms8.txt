 You're gonna take it! Oh, it's done. Oh, wow! I really cannot understand why you guys are eating this. Mmm! Mmm! Mmm! Hi everyone! This is Jessica and welcome back to the Korean Ate series here on The Sunbes Club. For today's video, I'm going to let different Korean college students try the famous, the classic Panfit Kanton. Panfit Kanton, as you guys know, is my favorite, especially the original flavor. But there is also the very exotic, kind of a sweet flavor in there. At first, it was very exotic for me as well, so I'm very excited to figure out how other Korean college students would feel about it. So let's go ahead and see their reactions. Alright guys, so we have a female guest. Could you please introduce yourself? I want to be a YouTuber. Oh! I'm Park Jung Hyun. I'm a college student at Hojo University. I'm a student of the U.S.A. I'm a teacher at the Indian Asia. I'm Korean. Today, I'm going to eat Korean noodles with the Korean noodles. Have you ever tried them? No, I haven't. No, I haven't. I've never tried them before. I've never tried them before, so I can't eat them in Korea. I've become very similar to them in Korea. I'm very excited to try them. I'll prepare five kinds of noodles. This is the ramen. I got a rainbow. This is a breadcrumbs that is made of flour. I need to cook first. I'm excited. I'm excited. You're so delicious. I'm going to taste this first. This is original. This is the most classic taste. Okay. Mmm! Mmm! Mmm! Mmm! Mmm! I can eat this with Korean noodles. It's sweet, but it's salty. It's salty. It's very salty. Have this with rice. Yes, it's salty. It's really salty. It's really good. It's very similar to me. It's very similar to me. It's like a vegetable. It's very instant. It's very delicious. Let's go. Let's do the rating first. Out of five. Oh, what's that? Wow! What's that? Four. Four. I'm going to put this in the middle. It's about 1.5. Now, the second one is sweet and spicy. Okay, try it. Sweet and spicy. Mmm! Mmm! Mmm! It's a little spicy. But this is also good. Oh, really? This is also good. It's delicious. Oh, it's delicious? The oil flavor is also a little bit spicy. It's a little bit spicy. But I think this is less salty. Mmm! Okay, yeah, I'm good. I'm hungry, but this is better. Way better. We're because it's much sweeter. It has so much flavor. I think this is better. I think this is better. I think it's about 4.5. 4.5? 4.5. Okay, okay. I'll buy this. I'll buy this. I'll buy this. I'll buy this. It's all it for. For? Now, the spiciest. It's called extra hot chili flavor. So try that one. The chili pepper is a typical chili pepper. It's called Cheongyang chili. I heard it's called Yeopbae. Oh, but... I'm going to eat it. It's supposed to be really, really spicy. It's a little spicy. Oh, I love the spice. It's things your tongue a little bit. A little bit? Yeah, this is my favorite. I think it's spicy. It's spicy. It's spicy, but it's not spicy. It's spicy. It's spicy. Oh, it's spicy. It's extra hot. It's spicy. Oh my god. This one is really salty. It's like a spicy one. It's like this. It's like it's going to taste better. It's like it's going to taste better in Korea. Then, extra hot chili is 5.4. I think it's like a 4.9. I'll say 3.5. I'm waiting for the best and the best. Solid, carbon-seed flavor. How was it? I was thinking. I didn't think. I didn't think. It's not enough. Oh! Oh! Oh! What is it? It smells like a snack. A snack? Oh! Oh! It's a pizza. Oh, it's a pizza. It's a clip. Oh, really? Try it. Try it. You're gonna take it. You're gonna take it. Take it. You see how exotic the carbon-seed pang-seed kkansang is for Koreans? I really can't understand why you guys are eating this. I can. Oh, you can. I cannot understand why they're finding it. Oh! I can't understand why they're finding it. Oh, you can. But I cannot understand why they're finding it. Oh! It tastes like a snack. I think it's a snack. At first, it's like a snack. It's like a snack. It's like a snack. It tastes really sour. Like lime. There's like no other flavor. It's a snack. I think it's a snack. It's a snack. It's a snack. It's an app-to-meat. It's an app-to-meat. How would you rate this one? I don't eat it. You don't eat it. I'm really sorry, but like one. It's an app-to-meat. Sadly, I think I'll give it a one, too. And then, we have our last flavor waiting for you guys. Chili manzi. So you can still taste the calamansi in it, but there's a little kick added. So hot. So hot. So hot. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. I think the calamansi flavor is stronger than this one. It's not that spicy. First impression? No difference. Oh. It's like spicy food. It's like you're eating all the calamansi. Mmm. How is it? I think this is really a great taste. It's a little bit more. It's a little bit more salty. Mmm. There's no difference. Really? I don't know. I don't think so. It's like zero spice. So like a lot of Southeast Asian food. You know how you drizzle some lemon on top? The lemon actually compliments the flavor all the more. So I think the idea of these two flavors came from that. But I know that for many Koreans, including me, it can be a little bit exotic. So how would you rate the last flavor? Why? It's okay. I'm also a little bit salty. These are the same. One. Okay. Oh you? They're exactly the same. One. We're here. Oh. Sweet and spicy flavor. I'm going to eat this. Mmm. It's a little spicy. It's a little spicy. The color of this one is just like Korean food. Then you can buy this at a convenience store. Right? Yes. I think I'll eat this. I think I'll eat this. I think I'll eat this. You're gonna eat it. No. Okay. But these were like really good. Alright guys. So that was the amazing reactions from my fellow Korean people. I felt so nervous seeing their reactions, especially with the Kalaman Siwon. It was I guess way too exotic for them. I mean, I understand it though. It was very exciting seeing all their reactions, them liking the spicy flavor, the original flavor. So yeah, I'll see you guys again on Korean up there next week. Bye bye. Bye bye. Yay.
