 2 na'belly. Oh, it's a good one. Ooh, dynamite. It does not eat rice here. Where's rice? It's a rice pan. Oh, I'm drooling. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Look. Oh. Oh, yeah. Crispy, chopped, baby. Welcome to What's up Philippines. What's up Philippines. Today we are going to react on a video that in all honesty. We have already seen many months ago and we love not only this video but the entire channel. We are reacting to a lot of Filipino street food at Rojas Night Market in Davao from the best ever food review show. One of my favorite channels on YouTube. Yes. And the reason why we want to react to it, I mean it's, first of all, it has been a world since we saw this video. Second, we miss food. We miss going to markets. We miss exploring new things. It's more a new thing. And we have a lot of food videos on our main channel making a tap of luck which will pop up right here. One of those videos is actually from this market. Yes. Should I link that to? Yes. Okay. Link. Yeah. And it is really interesting for us to see his reactions and he has a very, very funny way of explaining things. I think he's a comedian first and a food reviewer second. Fun fact, this guy used to be huge. Like, huge. Yeah, now he's just huge on YouTube. Now he's huge on YouTube. All right, so we jump into this video. He lost a lot of weight and now he's a food blog. I don't know how that works. We haven't figured a lot because we only gained weight. Before we jump into the video, if you're new around here hit that subscribe button. We're trying to reach 100,000 subscribers by the end of this month and you'll support to do so. So hit that right now and it's make it happen. Also turn on the notifications and get it to the channel. And kick every time I go to the Philippines, I try to find some balls to put in my mind. That's a good ball. That's a good ball. Yes, it's true. It's such a day. It's the largest market in Davao city. When the charm goes down, that is when the charcoal is getting lit up. People start barbecuing the kind of meat, smoke in the air and that's how you know it's going down hugely popular among students and locals from 6 p.m. each night. Yes. You can sample all the flavors. It's so cool. What I find so awesome is that that street is empty during the whole day and then all of a sudden it might boom all these food stands. In this market you can find robust sedal meals, barbecues and more. Yeah, the barbecues there is. A little bit of milk out for affordable street food and you won't believe how much we got for less than $8. My favorite was the quail balls that eat this one. Right, me and two. We'll try some Filipino classics. It's quite quick. You're at Rojas Market in Davao. It's going to be a protein packed sensation. Some foods that are new to me. Ooh, that's stomach-out-the-chicken. I don't think I've had a chicken stomach before. And he had it. He had it. A street food with some interesting side effects. I need a little more white. Oh, that's a chicken feet. It darkens teeth. It doesn't whiteen teeth. What happened? What's happening? Seeing? I've got my $8. Let's eat. Oh yeah. Good memories. Good memories. We were walking through and the smell. Oh. Out the van, I'm going to see if I can order some food from here. Hello. Hello. Hi. Can I order? Here, they've got some marinated pork sausage. Is that potato or fat? Just pork skin. Just pork skin. It's kind of like rice. Why not, right? This is just chicken and instant. Oh, that's good. We had the best one in our... Let me know in your hometown how much you pay. So I think chicken and instant. Can I have one of these? No. How's it going? I think it's from a counterhouse in Vietnam. Okay. We're going to eat it. Oh my god. Bam. There it is our... Oh, I'm getting hungry. I know how you guys must feel when you watch our main channel. We're talking about food all the time in the Italian. Which country? The Philippines. We have our pork right here. Try it out. Oh, that's one of the things that it's all about. It's hot. The sauce is very yummy. The pork is perfect. It's sweet. A little salty. Here. We have Iso. Now Iso is special to me because when I first came to the Philippines, we found some in the streets and it was my first episode. I didn't know what I was doing and I was like... It just tastes like barbecue animal. Is there anything in there? We should watch this other video. Yeah, we should. We should watch this description. Watch this description. Watch this description. Oh! No! Like chewy meat. It's like grilled meat. It sounds a lot like you. Last of all, I'm holding skin. The actual skin of a pork. Let's try it out. Wow. I don't know how to start that. How's your name? It is fatty, chewy, and crispy. It is yummy but unfortunately very unhealthy and it's... I get stomachache quite a lot of people. A lot of people I think just got out of school. One thing that I realized is it does not eat rice here. Where's the rice? Yeah, where's the rice bag? Dude, like you try a little bit of Philippines. Not a really good ony rice. I've been looking for Fuji. Can I have a Fuji? Oh! I've actually had one of those. Three for 20. And then here, the showmine. Both of these. Oh my. There's still less than a buck. They got Han Mani's. Oh, Han Ruleng. Oh my god. We are here in Shagawa Island and we have very limited food options right now. We're missing the street food. We are missing the street food. Guys, Philippines loves Shagawa. Take a look. I'm going to double it up. It's nice, warm and steamy. With some hot mayonnaise. Oh yeah. That is so satisfying. With a chewy outer part. It's very salty. On the median side. With some sweet hot mayonnaise. And the only way to cool off after that is with some dirtiness. I'm craving those shogawa now. Let's go for it. Fuji. No cheapo cheese. That's very yummy. It has kind of a glutinous rice fry. It's also so good. Yeah. It's also so good. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. And you kind of put it in your mouth and your mouth is kind of like this. Wait, come on. Where's the tuna belly? Where's the tuna belly? Yeah. You got to get in that tuna belly. We have some different kinds of fried and testin. What's that one? That is chicken roux. Is that ass? That's so fun. That's so fun. Let's try that. Right now, she's going to prepare it. The preparation is very in-depth. It takes a lot of steps. I mean, we had chicken roux. And here it is. Each of these sticks is five pesos. For these four, it's 20. And that is still under 50 cents. This may be one of the most cheapest markets in the world here. Some chickens. Yeah. I remember when we went there, it was so inexpensive. And we had this amazing tuna belly for like, I don't know. Contra, man, we'd have to check out the log to see what the price was. Yeah. Very nice texture, little chewy, little crunchy. And then we got that nice spicy ketchup in there. Oh my god. Thank you. Let me. Oi. Look, aw. Next food. You see this smile? This is what we have foodies. We are obsessed with food. Yeah. The flavor of it too is not just corn. Cheese flavor, sour cream, barbecue flavor. Wow. You're all over it. I love cheese. I'm going with cheese. Oh, wow. That looks healthy. Not. I'm going to eat it. I'm going to eat it. I'm going to eat it. I'm going to eat it. I'm going to eat it. Not. Check out this corny combo. We got the cheese seasoning and then a blob sauce butter. I want one of those butter squeezeers. Find my bed at home. Oh. Is that butter? Oh. It's a tough market. Not everything tastes like butter. We've got butter. We've got cheese. And we've got corn. Let's try it out. Oh. It's yummy. Not a lot of surprising flavors. I'm going to be honest. That is margarine and corn with cheese powder. How is your seasoning? I think you must work on after this. Yeah. How did you start bringing here today? Quick quick. Quick quick. Quick quick. Quick quick. Okay. Okay. Mike is not a huge fan of hot bold eggs. That's why quick quick is not his favorite. But that's like a fish bowl. No, this is quick quick. The fish bowl is the other one. Okay. Let's try it out. I have my first quick quick at capo market. Yeah. So remember it. My last hot bold egg had a cold duck in it. Balloped. If you missed that video, it will pop up right here. I like every time I go to the Philippines, I try to find some balls to put in my balls. It's so hilarious. I don't think I'll get any part of the fish bowl. One of the funniest videos I've seen from him is with highest chipney for the whole day to go to Tallinn. I think we should get this one. I like it. Yummy. They're squid balls. Wow. What's unique about these balls that they're not even balls. They're kind of flat. Like a half a pancake. Well, I'm going to grab one of those. Oh. It has a real squid essence. It's not too squid-y, but it's like the soul of a squid. It's so overwhelming when you go to that market. There's so much food. So many options. Yeah. And I think we should put the pie essence in the videos. We should do that too. Yeah. See, we're learning something new. Yeah. It's got layers of crunchiness to it. It layers of crunchiness. Look at us. Oh, look at that. Oh. Welcome to the nuts. The nuts are nuts. The last thing I want to see in the comments is like, oh, sunny went to the Philippines so he could put balls in nuts in his mouth. I don't want to see any of that. We can't hear the good nuts. And we can do it like adults. Well, these look yummy. Can I have one garlic and one sugar coated? Reading the comments is sometimes really funny when it comes to food videos. Okay, so first shot of peanuts. Oh, they got cheese. Nope. We went to Korea and Myeongdong market everything at cheese and everything here has cheese powder. Well, salt me away. I'm going to start with this piece of garlic. Oh. Oh, it's yummy. It's like burnt garlic flavor. Mm-hmm. Those are good nuts. Salt me, oiled and freshly roasted. And the best way to chase that is with some homemade sugary covered peanuts. Let's try that one. Oh, wow. That's sweet. So nice when it happens just as a little snack. We're going to have fun to beer. Actually, we eat the actual food. That's my chicken dumpling. We have it all going on here. This is kind of like a green roll. I'm so jealous right now. Oh. Is that hot? I want some dynamite, man. We're going to get one order of dynamite. Dynamite is so cool. You eat and then every now and then you have a super spicy one. Five or so are just like mild. And then one is like crunch. Yeah, and like flames out of your ears. Yeah, like ears. Ooh. What is that? Chicken dumpling. Oh. It's a hot. It's a wrap. It's so delicious. Crunchy, meaty, a little bit. I'm comfortably warm. It's very spicy. And now we're stepping up to the dynamite. I mean, it's an actual chili wrapped up and fried. Look at that monster. It's just a crunch. And cheese. Yes. Mmm. I'm really hot. You can see inside. That's just a whole chili there. Okay. It's a little spicy. Yep, spicy. It's so hot. Dynamite. Next time you're at this market, you got to get the dynamite. See, it's all done. Dynamite is that thing. Bam. What are you selling here today? Kalamansi. Hold on. Did you say cucumber lemonade? Why? Why does that exist? I'll do it. I'll take it. Okay. You can never go wrong with the pukuchas. It's really very sweet. Especially in the Philippines, best puku in the world. Oh, that's really delicious. It's like the treasure of near the equator, God. It's so creamy and delicious. I love it. Really? I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. Really nicely said. Guys, we cannot finish this trip in the Philippines without at least trying balut once here in the Philippines. Hey, what a day. Well, pesos for this little guy. It is 18 days of balut. It is 18 days of balut. It is 18 days of balut. It is 18 days of balut. I advise you, if it's your first time eating balut to kind of soften your eyes, focus your gaze a little bit. Because it is one of those foods with the most opposite, yuminous tasting to yuminous looking so there it is. That's the balut. We're going to throw a little vinegar on there and there is no way to do it. But to just toss the whole thing back. Did you put the whole thing in your mouth? No. No, you took a bite. No, I took a bite. You took a bite. It is the first couple of times the texture can be a little bit. But I definitely have it a few times. You just get used to it and you really start to enjoy the texture as well as the flavor. Very good. Yeah, I think balut depends a lot on the age of the table. We're going to drink rainbow. Yeah, yeah. It's crispy. It's so pretty. And this right now is limited to that container. But I can get more rice later if I want to. And 50 grams of pork. Putting it on the scale. Look, if you can eat it, you can eat it. I prefer a garlic rice. Yeah. Get that skin. Get that skin. Oh yeah. Thank you. Picture. Oh, this is included. I'm telling you. I'm going to eat it. I'm going to eat it. I'm going to eat it. I'm going to eat it. This is included. I'm telling you. This is the best value market that I've ever been to. So I'm going to say in the world right here. We have the actual park. I'm going to scoop it up. Oh, are you OK? Let me. Craving your chalk. If you're not in the comments, I'd be like, you're craving the chalk right now. I am for sure. She has ice cream. It's like a charcoal ice cream. I'm curious. We tried that. Chips are ice cream. I do. I know about this white ice cream. Did I eat chocolate ice cream? I'm going to help prevent hangovers. Which is going to be very useful for tonight. I think that's right. OK. Can I have one? Ooh, it's looking dark. It's looking very cold. Yeah, my shoes would get really, really bad. I've never seen this color in a long time. I get sick from my activity. It's a lot of alcohol. It's starting to drip. I want to get a good sip. A bite? Yeah. Huh? Oh. It's sweet. It's creamy. I don't have a good frame of reference for this. I like the little grains of sand. The flavor is good. It's kind of vanilla-y, a little bit. It's just sweet and creamy. Then the texture of the cream is... I remember it was creamy. It's like little bits of sand and like chewing on toothpaste. Oh, really half. What the heck? Are my teeth black? Yes. It says it whitens teeth. What is it doing? Teeth are not more white. It's a penis. It darkens teeth. It doesn't whitens teeth. What happened? Teeth? Oh, I miss like the smell of like the smoky... food markers, the chard. And seeing people sitting together. What I recommend this more. Anything. If you're a student, if you want to try a bunch of different things, they do serve more like robust meals. And like, aside from the food, is there just an awesome vibe here? Everyone's very happy. When we said done, we automatically set it up. And we said it was a smile. Also, for you guys, this video was made possible by one trip Vietnam. One trip is the highest rated tour. All right. Very cool. Very, very cool video. I'm just untied. I'm so excited. I'm so excited. And just untied my headphones. Run MTI. I have to charge my headphones. Yo, so much fun. This video, I love the best ever food review show. We have actually a lot of food reviews of our own on our main channel, making it happen called... Called Pailess. We have the Super Mercato video, which is very popular. We have a video where we try like a ton of bacoloured food. We will actually both playlists into the description down below. I definitely highly recommend you head over there and binge watch all the videos. I mean, such good times. I don't want to say my videos are so great, but such good times are great. You are really good. I mean, we have the unedited, uh, Nellies unedited food review show, which is every now and then in the food blog. But Mike is... Just a quick sprinkle then? Mike is the actual... How do you say it? Connoisseur. Food critic. Yeah. I'm more about how the food makes me feel and he's more like... He can express it into words. Yeah. So for me, you see it in my face straight away and for him it's like... Oh, like this umami hits you right at the end of the day. You know, like he's... He's doing this thing. And like, yeah, that's good. Okay guys, that was it for today. Yeah, we decided spontaneously to react to food videos because we are food lovers. So, I think we are going to have a video about this video. We are going to have a video about this video. I'm going to have a video about this video. I'm going to have a video about this video.
