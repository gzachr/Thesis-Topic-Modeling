 Beach Friday. Diffreshes. My proof that Filipinos can also speak English is Spanish, continuous, but this time it's not in Igual Pasqual, but it is BGYO and they are doing a song of a cover of Sebastian Yatra and Break. Sebastian. Sebastian. What the hell did I say? Sebastian. Oh, the English will be good. Sebastian Yatra and Break. Ongaño, which means one year. Now, I've always said Filipinos have the language deactivated. Spanish language. You just have to flip the switch. Here is evidence, exhibit number B. Oh yeah, it gives the English. Inigo did it. Yeah, inigo has done it several times actually. He is Latino. He is Latino singer. Anyways, I was also excited for this because I love this song. Okay. Oh, what? I mean, I'm worried that's on the perfect. I adore the set. Can we have a look at that beautiful set with projections in the background? Those projections become very popular. I think they create a fantastic atmosphere with very little. What did we see them again? That I really like. A set that will glow under the barren. That was amazing. Those projections. We also saw it on Buguay's latest music video for impossible love. That's right. We also saw them with G-Dragon back in the day, didn't we? Also, good point. I think he like in 2014 he was like behind me. It was one of the first two. Yeah, to do that. But then we also saw it on those Dingo freestyle studios. No, no, no, Mirony and the H1. Mirony, H1 as well. And they're becoming very trendy. And I think it's so smart though because projections create such an atmosphere. You only need a blank canvas. It's just great. Because the perspective lighting is manageable. You can manage brightness, contrast everything. Look at the outfits. You can focus on other things. And look at the outcome. This is the outcome. I mean, perfection is beautiful. I love it. Ooh, okay. I think I look like a... So is the S's on the C's? I think it's the C and the C combination with a vowel with an I. That might be difficult. That might be difficult. That sounds like a cha for them. Right. Similar to how Italians do it. But I have to be honest. This pronunciation is pretty freaking smart. Most words like en amore. That would be a really difficult one for someone who doesn't speak Spanish. That's right. But for them is the easiest one. The phonetics. So what? Very clean. I mean, this guy's good thing to be in Spanish anytime. Yeah, and if I wasn't really paying attention to each pronunciation, I wouldn't be able to tell that much. That's right. But that's normal. This is such a beautiful song. It's just an accent. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good point. I'm not kidding. Yes! Yes, first. What the fuck? Yeah, he's mixed Spanish, didn't he? Okay, more easy. I'm obsessed. Well, the last two lines were absolutely insane. But like, what can I go back? Yeah, yeah, what's my... That's ridiculous. He was so good. Okay, I'm losing my mind. What range? That's ridiculous. He's fluent. He actually speaks it. Do you like the leader? Oh, I fuck off. He has to be Spanish. Like, he has to be from somewhere in South America, Spain. He wanted me over. That's brilliant. That's how you weave me over. Big fan, a lot of these a lot. I want him to make more Spanish covers. Me too. I actually want him to cover, let he... If anyone's watching that nose and... I love him to cover. Pablo López, Camila, Sin Banderas. I have el pintos. I have el pintos. Who else would I actually... I would say they would suit some Luis Falsesos. Camila. Camila as well. Camila. Camila. Camila as well. The solo artist, yeah. I love him to cover... Maybe Travis, the baby's ball. David's ball. He's the crazy. Give it a go. You have the lads. But the Spanish... Like, the Spanish from Spain. I think it's trickier than the Latin Spanish. No, because they have a natural... Sure. So maybe the third wouldn't be as difficult. No, it is. It is because I had problems with the THs here. The tha. So I feel like if you're... What, zapato? How the hell is that? Yeah, well, you said that. This... I don't think that would be difficult for them. Do you know what I think? No, I actually think that might be easier for them. I think Latino Spanish is easier. But it's the best because I'm biased. Also, Spanish from Spain is the proper one. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm just biased. Yeah, that's like actually the proper pronunciation of stuff. Because Zeta is different from anese. Zeta. Yeah, but as in Latin America for some reason the same thing. Just saying, Roxy. She has it and Zeta. Yeah, and Zeta. What is that freaking name for that letter in English? Zeta. Zeta. Zeta or Z? Zeds. Yeah, that's... What happened bro? Spanish English, bro language. Oh, oh, oh, oh. I love it. I love it. It's brilliant. They're good vocalists. What, that's it? Give me five minutes, dog. No, Zeta, look. Check it out. Yeah, it's over. That was it, dog. No, what a tease. It's like a one minute and a half tease. No, bro, what a tease. Put the little bit again, at the end. It's brilliant, dude. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. The smell of it, put it in the morning, let's play it there. Cool joke. Oh, no, what a freaking tease. Oh, I want a whole Spanish album by... I want that, maybe this is like a series that they do. I do know they're actually becoming very popular in places like Brazil. C&C Co. The CO would make such a freaking great collab. No, C&C O. C&C O. Yeah. Right. Is that how you pronounce it? Yes, they would make an amazing freaking collab with BGYO. That's true. So good. Dancers, both of them, both of the groups, freaking visuals, both of the groups. They're getting on dance, that's true. I mean, thinking about vocal qualities, they're both of the groups, stick the box. I mean, it would be iconic. Well, let us know what you thought about it. So maybe if there are other bands or maybe other artists, maybe BGYO have other covers in Spanish, I would love to check them out. That is brilliant, truly, it's good work. It's not easy to sort of bang out songs in another language. Oh, I know you did it. We're seeing from a lot of the world, people, I don't know. There's so many talented people out there that can do this stuff. Like in Indonesia, there's Russia and Miriam, they're doing songs in Japanese. And they're in Spanish sometimes, Tagalog and Eastern. You're like, what the hell, bro? You know, and you're getting BGYOs, speaking in Spanish, they're flippant. It's unbelievable. I only joke around. They're like, obviously, not everyone can do it. It seems everyone can, free of your own filipines. So let us know more about them and maybe what else would you check out next? Absolutely. The freaking fire.
