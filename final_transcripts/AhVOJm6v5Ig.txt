I enjoyed the Tupen because they were completely different, but that is a tradition. So, that's so nice. It gets me to know a bit of the tradition that is fantastic. And that was in 2018. So, I will leave the two videos down at the bottom. So, please go check them out because they are great. They're really, really nice. And I did like the way they were dressed up as well. So, that's so nice. Is there any think about what they have to wear? What are the colours? And what tradition is it? What kind of tradition? Any information down there, but I'm not sure that would be fantastic. So, yes, I hope you enjoyed the video.
