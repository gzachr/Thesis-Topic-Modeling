 Future Friday. The freshest. Great. Okay, funny game by this one. Yeah, I actually have to confess, I've heard this song, but we're going to go into a little bit of a rock rampage, because apparently this song is one of the people's favorites. Okay? It's Kamikaze, right? Yeah, it's Kamikaze. I've never heard this. The fact that people sing rock like from the top of their lungs. It's about the video we saw after lunch, after dinner. He's a famous rock artist. Oh, yeah. Well, it's one of the famous John Resteson. Yeah. So, let's have a final show. Oh, good. Oh, the final show. Maybe that's the last show they did. Yeah, this is before they retired or took like a hiatus or something. Oh, my God. What the hell? Salam al-Salaam. Salam al-Salaam. Oh, I remember them singing with that Kyla. That was a Kyla that they brought to the stage. That's right. Salam al-Salaam. Spicy lemon. How good? How good people! Kera! I'm a movie game. I'm a movie game. I'm a movie girl man. Yes, sir. I'm a movie game. I'm a movie game. That one is tired. Thank you very much. That's the last song. Oh, my God. The security people are at least. Please move away. Can I kill you, dude? How cool. Oh. I love live concerts. I love live concerts. I love live concerts. Oh, wait. You just get sang in karaoke. How fun. You just get sang. What a win. Salam al-Salaam. I love how he's so celebratory about me. Yeah. Well, it's the last concert, right? Oh, yeah. True shit, dude. Everything means a little bit more. That's so cool. That's so cool. That is so cool. That's so cool. That's so cool. That's so cool. That's so cool. That's so cool. That's so cool. That's so cool. Look at that, it's fashionable hangout. It's his name. Oh yeah, shit. It's a very impressive thing. That he is singing after sounding like he could go crazy. Yeah. That was really easy song for that. This is the last song as well so he's been singing and jumping around and shouting I was there a whole night I don't know how long they're constantly I'm sure maybe someone watching right now What's there? Yeah, definitely the chances of that happen Crazy to say but I can guarantee you that yeah correct someone's gonna be that end the comments be like I was actually there I was singing It was amazing I gotta go squash the bro and his Oh That's so freaking cool Okay, lets play denominator girls Okay I love rockists Oh my god, everybody knows it was amazing. This is a proper karaoke session right here. What? That's so cool. My heart's smoking. It's so cool. then just on the other side, then on the other side, Oh no. Oh! Woo! Woo! How crazy, bro. It's insane. It's a really cool set up for a stage as well, isn't it? This guy's like, oh my god. Cool! Oh, you can feel the energy in the air. That's a really good air. Thank you. Yeah! Wow, wow. It's probably sea lemon. That's crazy, bro. It's so fun. I think that's an artist that's probably the most... That's the biggest compliment an artist can get. Oh yeah. For people to learn their songs like that. And when they go on, they put the mic out. People actually sing it. I know. That's like the biggest compliment. It's actually the arrangement of the song in this particular... This particular part of the show. Like they literally let the crowds carry it. Probably the biggest hit they've made maybe at some point. Probably, I would think so. Like I will presume. Right? That's like the biggest thing they made. How freaking cool is that, though? Oh, that. Oh, that's one of those concerts that you can just fill the electricity in the air type of thing. Narada. Yes. Salt. See how many, like... Oh, because usually it takes you like to Spotify or something. But, um... Yeah, I don't know. I would presume is one of the biggest ones. I would think so, right? Only enough if you put like kamikaze, Narada. The first one that comes up is chords. Everybody was like, good people. Maybe a lot of people sort of cover it or something. Yeah, that's pretty cool, man. I like that. I like that. Again, I think it's one of those songs that you... You just... Because of the easy melody that you just kind of catch really quickly. I know. Yeah, I know. I mean, it makes you feel quite like... Like elated. I don't know what the lyrics are about, though. Maybe it's not really a sad song. Well, I like to see it. Let's do that. Let's check out the lyrics for... I don't know if this is it. Narada, English translation. Like a bird when you fly. You go with the wind. You caught my eye. The girl. Rapting mystery. Will you ever notice me? You're too busy saving everybody. We're all rivals for your attention. Will I ever get the chance to know you? This song's a plea. I hope that you hit me. That you'd hear me. I love that's riddle. I can only send it out to you in a song. I'm waiting in the sky picking through the clouds behind the stars. You'll never think this guy has like this... Like he's writing this nice fucking lovely song. I know, right. I thought you were saying I'm gonna cue you, motherfucker. Oh, yeah, Fra. It doesn't have that undertone, though, either. It felt like... No, it felt more like... Like my heart is broken and now it's bleeding. No, it felt more like, oh, tomorrow's a new day. Sing out with me kind of thing. Because the chords are on the major key. They didn't give me... They didn't give me... I thought I was gonna be in a bad situation, you know. No, they did feel like... Okay, fair enough. Will you ever notice me? You're so busy saving everybody. What else? Come on, come on. Yeah, so the song's a plea. What if I jumped off a cliff? I wonder if you'd save me. That's the angst that I'm sort of receiving. That seems to be the... There's inspiration. Because that seems to be the only way I can put my arms around you. Maybe she's like a nurse. Will you come to my rescue? You seem to be too busy saving the world. Yeah. Or maybe she's like a police woman or something. We're all rivals for your attention. I wonder what will happen. I just think... Maybe she's a mother. Maybe she's... I thought, yeah, do you know what... Do you know what I... Do you know what I... Why would she be saving the world? Well, just being practical. Because I think... No, because I think she's one of those people that are like... Put others first before they put themselves first type of thing. Like... No, she ain't got saved the world, huh? No, but it's more like a whoever's in need that she will... Go to... Go to that aid. Exactly. So he'll be like, okay. She has to put myself in harm's way. So maybe you'll finally notice. She has the hero complex. Exactly. You'll get away from those people. Don't worry. Oh. That's crazy. Okay, yeah, but like, you know, she's barely one of those girls that thinks she can fix everybody or something like that. She's there. She's there. Fix the upper. Yeah. No, she's not a fixer, Oprah, because she's not the one who needs fixing. She likes to fix. Exactly. She's the mechanic. She's bumping her in the mechanic. The mechanic. The movie is great by Jason Statham. Okay. That's actually a great movie. He kills someone with a screwdriver. I know. I watch that scene and he marked me. Okay. Let's go to Parokia Niadgar. That's right. Obviously, Chitomiranda is popping at the moment because of idol Philippine. Correct. But also, he's also always popping in those buttons of the karaoke machine that 88431. Oh my god, you made that up. I guess. And it's actually only four digits. Oh, okay. It's like 8803 or something like that. Okay. I was gonna say, like, the previous song. Lovely. He's so adorable. Like, you guys even send us not only the name and stuff. The code. I said, we're gonna sing this shit in the karaoke machine. We don't have one. We should get one. Plus, they're huge. They're fun. We should get one. Where is this guy? Where is this guy? True. Maybe when we get like a big studio. Yeah.
