I'm just going to leisurely graze their way over. They're going to stop for some grass. Then walk a little bit. Is it going to be like a fish race or a turtle race? Or like somebody tries to walk their cat? I'm not somebody by the way. We got up super early. So we hadn't had our coffee yet. So we're going to get ourselves a coffee here. Right across the street. Oh, the anthem is going on right now. There's so pretty. I want to walk. There's so pretty. I want to walk. There's so pretty. I'm going to walk. I'm going to walk.

It was very nice. I love how every area has their own anthem. Right. I don't know that. Every time we go somewhere, we hear another anthem. And they just are so beautiful. Well, it started raining. It's going to be an intense and muddy rain. Yes, it is. It's going to be definitely muddy. I think the cariboules are happy, though. They're like, I can cool them out. I think they're more than happy to have a little rain. I'll do this, starting rain. You just said it's wet. It's a size workshop. Ah. The gold or basmati is the most beautiful place in the world. It's the most beautiful place in the world. So this caribou race is actually the oldest event in the province of Ilo-Ilo. Which is really cool to see. I believe it's 51 years old. Maybe lower.

And the run in like 17, 18 seconds. Some of them are so bad. No, that's me. We did a reaction to it. And we were so surprised. That's awesome. Yeah, I was actually blowing away. I was using the drone. So I couldn't see from your perspective. Oh, you got to watch one. Because it's a head. Yeah, well, we're about to start on it. And now I know you can actually ride one. Because he's grown men are. So I want to ride one. Maybe one of the losers can let me. Yeah. Well, he won't be as muddy too. True. We'll have to go over there before. Yeah, let's watch this one. And then make our way over. Yeah, down the red to me. Go! Oh, there we go. Oh, here we go. Oh, here we go. Look at it. Yeah, I have it in there. Go full. Come on, come on! Go give up, it's not over!

And he's like, this is the best thing ever. That was hot and sweaty and now I'm chillin'. Well, the good news is water buffaloes love water! And so they got a lot of it.
