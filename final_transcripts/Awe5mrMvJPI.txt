Yeah. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey, hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. It's crazy. Boom. You're good. You're good, you're good. But even when they did that, I visualized the bass, too. Yeah. Boom. You actually can imagine the sound just because of the boom. Yeah. Yeah. Like, keep our words and listen to songs by itself. Like, on Spotify. No, no, no. No way, bad, I quit. I get so bad. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Hey. Hey. Hey. There we go. Word plays also. Hey. There we go. Oh. Hey. We have good words. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Oh. Where the hell is the point? What? What? You know me, you know, this is like the first time I've actually been sitting down with these intentions that I have. They are good. Like, what else? It's like, what are you doing? You're already in a family with me. I think chips, because I think, how much I am. Well, I like to, like, be cooking continue. I mean, I wish that was for me that I could still dance even more. I mean, I'm still dancing so much. Like, you know, competitive-wise, still be an answer even when I have my own family. Yeah, for never even judge all I have. Yeah. Yeah, mom and I, you're also, you're more than, more than, more than, okay? Yeah, right. You're offering them a thermometer, five, six, seven, eight. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. okay. Wow, you're seen. I'm sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, I was a mistake, I was gonna pause your foot. What I was gonna say is that I didn't even notice that it's boys and girls because the girls are just as hard as the guys. And only now when I saw that hair flip, I was like, bad at that day, but I am when I was like, when it comes to nads, sometimes. And in the female, they can be overshadowed by nails. And crowd. Yeah, happens, yeah. It's not always that happened, but we can see it. And I don't want to say the majority, but there's a lot of group or whatever is a guy and a girl. Guys are one of the pants that I'm supposed to wear. Yeah. And walk out. However, in this group, like, it doesn't happen. That's what I'm saying. Like, I didn't notice that girls were here until I saw the hair flip. If you're a girl. If you're a girl, you gotta stand as hard as this. Exactly. What would be the front? You gotta stand as hard as this. Because the notification that makes the group, you know, the, what is so beautiful about mega-cruise is that even though there are 50 people, they look like one. That's what I love about that. I'm gonna become a big company. I'm gonna stand. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yuck. Exit actually. Oh I like how they have smooth buy-seek. Like soft, not expensive. Oh my god! Little girl. Hey! Why? Hey! Hey! Woo, woo! It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Let's go! Hey! Woo! Hey! That's it! You know what? You're the kind of Yovina Suta! Hey! Woo! Hey! Hey! Hey! Wait, honey! You sound like a real guy. And I know he had a good soul. That's a little low. I don't know how they do it, but that's another level. It is, and it's like, okay, you're strong, but they have their moments where they're like, they're chill, and they're like, chill. But even while being relaxing chill, they're getting an energy. It's like having a conversation with a choreography like, you know, train properly. I think it's like having a conversation. You already can see that the dancer, energy is down, it's down. It's down. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The community is doing the boi-ji. It must be the same level. The whole... It is. So the same energy. It's a matter of reading, exercising, a good part of your health, a lot of stuff. That's what I love about that. And normally for carbuses, I don't like seeing one. It's like hard-hitting, and it's hard to get into the end. It's like, you can't see one. You can't see one. You can't see one. You can't see one. You can't see one. You have to be sure to like, be called like texture. I think it is texture. When you do that, you make the audience want to keep watching and want to see what's going to happen at the end. So to get to the end, I need to go through the whole set. So I'm going to be staying here watching. That's what you need. That's how you bring in an audience. If you watch and we take the time to watch, if you need to have the HRD at lot, you'll also see those tiny, because the good thing about them is that they pay attention to teachers. Like fingers. Fingers. And most of the time, not most of the time, but some parts of their feet forget about their feet. Like if the hands open, if they explode, it's like this. Those details, they care about the details. Okay, so for everyone to do it together. So like what you were saying about one and two, you'll see one have two, and then someone at the other side of their like crap. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. I love that the travel is. Mm-hmm. The way they're traveling on the stage is really good. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hey! Hey! Let's go! I think she's in favor. Hey. Then I guess I'm the only one who says she's playing favor. Yeah! Mm-hmm. Hey! Oh my god. Oh, he's too hot for me. Yeah, you beat me. Go, go, and... She got swag. Woo! Oh! I'm gonna beat you. Oh! Everyone, everyone. Mm-hmm. It's like a belief that in details, the details that you were talking about. The details. The details. Yeah. Yeah. So. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Mm-hmm. Hey! Mm-hmm. Oh, mom, mom, mom, mom. Oh! It's time to get her to go. And it's the same song. It's the same song. Woo! Hey! Is that Van Gluff? Oh my god. She's in favor. Let's go! Oh! Hey! Hey! It was the isolation that the guy had before. Like, all the things that they were doing there. And stuff. That was really cool. No! Hey! It's like they're gliding! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Oh! It's fun! Hey! Let's go! Hey! Hey! Yeah! Oh! Oh! Hold on. I gotta see. I love moves that take you from the top to the bottom smoothly. Okay, that you weren't expecting it. Yeah. Because you know, like, as a dancer, you can tell when someone's going to go to the ground to the movement. And that has always been my favorite move. And I used to use that a lot in choreography. And the last part of the song is the same. And the last part is the same. Thank God. Hey! Oh! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! I do a lot of isolation. Mm-hmm. Oh! And many footwork. And I know that. So, you guys see, in your country, you were the first one, then? Pass. But you don't get so... This little girl is tripping. She's laughing. And she's laughing. And I know that you're the one who's trying to make the travel in the nature from front to back to the side. It's... It's... It's so slow. Like, you're not expecting from you. You think that you're just going to do it there in that spot. It looks easy, right? Yeah. It looks easy, right? Yeah. It looks easy, right? Yeah. Hey! Ooh! Woo! That's a lot! Hey! I love it. Oh! His, Chris. He's Chris? I've seen him before. I've seen him before. I like how he dances. I didn't know he was from this group. What? I didn't know he was going to sing that song. I didn't see this guy before. And what, what makes you about the expression? Look at that. Yeah. Out the master. Okay, let's see his intro again. Papa. Hey! Oh! Hey! Oh! Yeah! Woo! Papa! He can dance that! Oh my god! It's a bit of a... What? What? Okay, okay, okay. Oh! E-tool! Let's go! You can't be us. Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! Yeah! We can't be us. Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! Yeah! Wow! It feels a bit, a bit, a bit. I can't sit up hard again! Yeah! Woo! I love the swag! Okay. Oh, wait! Yeah! Let's go! Hey! Woo! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Oh my god! I thought they were going to end it there! I thought they were going to end it there! No, no, we're not. We still have a few more sequins to go. Nice! Oh! Yo! Wow! I love you, sir. This is Christ. Now I'm going to be like, uh, I'm going to say, I know that you are. Because you got this group in the country. Like, for real. You see this group? I've seen, I have watched it be group like since I don't know. 10, 6 years ago. And the level is always international though. I saw them at the H.H. Child. For the first time. This is it. I love it to be honest. Wow! That's why I wanted to reason that I actually danced. I like to see those cut-yeah. Nice! Will you speak if you ever see this for a reason why this guy right here needs us? Please, this Christ. I want my pants! I'm going to retire dancing. Now I know why I'm tired. Just you go to this. Yeah, I'm going to go to the Philippines and I'm going to audition. But you win! Mr. Chris Beltran, whenever you see some audition, like whenever you have some audition, you can probably say we will fall. He's the leader? I'm not 100% sure, but I think he's the leader. Because he is an interesting, usually the leader of a group needs to have the energy that the other dances can feed off of. And he has that energy. He has that energy that he can see the expression. He dances clean, fast. That's why he terrains. There is a, I don't know what name it is, it's peeps. It's like the junior teams. They went also, they went to the World Dance. They went to the World Dance. You can see the same thing here that you can see on the kids. I don't know how they do it. I mean, he traded that from buffers. Every time I see it, I'm like, you know, it's a surprise. I'm 30, I don't do things. Yeah, I don't think they do. You can see people dancing, you can tell if they have knowledge in dancing. So yeah, guys, this is it. This is awesome. You really love this. I love this. He's a really good fan, but today it's on 27th of March. Mark is my fan girl, like, 40 feet.
