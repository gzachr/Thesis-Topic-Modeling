 Take care. Hi everyone, another video at no work today we got very strong wind, this has broke everything, drop of your wire, anyway I work it there because I'm sick, it's this lady up there, it doesn't stop. Talking having fun there. Yeah, I've been sick for the last two, just for days. Just to reiterate this, I've been empty myself, I feel just a little bit better to them, out of bed to them. Yeah, so tomorrow we're going to have to do some shopping because we haven't gone anyway since we come back from the mountain house, it's not much happening, we're going to start with. It's finishing packing up the weld received, it's the wrong one, 450 out of 500, tomorrow we'll send it back to them. Just to click at that on my car, everything's been painted. Just like I've been soaked with all the windows in, the entire parking. That's the paint out. That is looking good. That's going to have a little bit of closening. All right, so it's really white, white. All right, this could be really next week then. You have my phone number? You have my phone number? My phone number you had? Yeah, yeah, I give to you. Yeah, I thought I forgot to give you the phone number. Next municipality for a bit of a shopping. And I saw this line broken by a branch tree or something. And still not fixed. I got a hundred of houses here without power. Two days now. It does look like a complex thing to fix. Just put the cable back. So I can't do any upload. Can't do any work neither because I need the power to cut things. I need to material my handrails battery charge. I can't use it because I need to charge the batteries. They all float. And I can't do my editing and uploading video. That's affect my earning. It's crazy. I know I should buy your backup, but I don't want to buy a little PC thing for 20,000. Yeah, it's been a while now. I can't charge my phone to a GM and I. We're going to run out of phone. We're using the fan solar power fan to charge our phone now, but there's no sound. So it takes a while. Yeah, that's the Philippines. Since we don't have no power for two days now, GM is bored. Me too. They all live in sick. So she make a sure rock. Yeah. Yeah, good morning. Beautiful morning. I don't see the rain for nights. So it's good. I really need to finish this wall. So that's probably the plan for today before anything else. And then after that, we will see what we do. Hello you. Good morning. GM still making a sure rock. This needs to dry. I think it's not dry yet because it's so humid here. We already got those two climbs. So actually to do two of those or four of those. Anyway, I'd like to do that. Is the other one ready here? Is she is just wake up. I think it's already dry. I don't think it's still dry here. It's still wet. It's okay. As long as. It's okay. No, it's not. It's not dry. Don't take the the climbs off. See? Still wet. Stick together already. Maybe we can put this somewhere else. And then do this one maybe. But I will, if I were you, I would have the sun come up. And put this under the sun. So what if the sun come up next week? What next week? Haha, you probably right maybe. No, I'll say you will come up today because I can see. Well, only. See? It's coming. Look. It's coming. Still early. It's at 6am.
