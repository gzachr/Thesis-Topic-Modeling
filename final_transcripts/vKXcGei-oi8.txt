 Hello! Hello! My name is Kano, not Joe. Kano. Kano. Good morning guys. It's 5 a.m. beautiful sky in the background. It has moon of the moon and look at the colors. What a beautiful start of the day with this spectacular sunrise. And the local life of the island, the sailboat, the fisherman, parallel. Unreal. Today is going to be a little bit different from the previous ones. The fireboats are going to go split up and experience the island on our own. Maybe in a group of two or three and then at the end of the day we're going to come back together and see what we found or what we experienced. But first of course the boys are making breakfast, energize, then we get this day started. See the geese. Alright so here's what's going on. I noticed a couple of fishermen out there and I believe they were holding a spear gun. And I've never seen them hunting. We're fishing with spear guns here. It's almost life here. People are everywhere walking on the beach, hunting, gathering food. Getting the day started. I'm putting on new socks that I've rinsed off that sand before you put them on. Alright, let's see what we can find. Where there is holding a fishing line. Try to catch one. You catch any? You catch fish? Yeah. Small fish? Only with a fishing line. Simple as that. Oh I can see here. Oh I can see here. Maggot? Yeah. Oh big worm. We actually do the same one with fishing in Iceland. Worms is the best bait. Worm in the sea. Yes. Oh it's a sea worm? Wow. I can see the sea worm. I can see the sea worm. I can see the sea worm. I can see the sea worm. Oh it's a sea worm. It's like a snail. The livelihood here guys fishing. How old are you? 68. 58. You look like 28. I don't know what that is but I don't want to touch that. That looks scary. I just showed him a video of the jellyfish and he said yes burns a lot. Let's go back and dry up a little bit and then we start exploring the island. That is the strangest crab ever. His shells turn into like three pieces. The name of this is Sakloban. Sakloban. Is this a crab? Yeah. Look at that. You see the ice. Tahong. This is a crab too. It's this. Oh it's a shell thing. You don't boil it? Let me. Let's set up. It's a home. Alright here's what's going on. We're going to go a little bit north and drive around the whole island. Today is a driving day. And you're enjoying the wind in the face. Alright we're driving through the west coast of the island and we're at the most furthest out of the point of the island. And apparently it's a huge, hey! Long stretch of white sand we're going to check out. If we try to find some food I'm starving. We won't have breakfast. I love that quits. Alright guys, had a hot day. There's no better option than halohalo. Yes, here we got all the ingredients. We got... What is this? Coco. Beans. The goko jelly. Hello, can I get one or halohalo? 20. 20. Yes, it's cheap. Yes, it's only me. I'm only one. Stay in healthy boys. Yeah, practice English with me. What is your name? Princess Mac Derral. Mac Derral. It's hard to say. Mac Derral. My name is Pintin.

Search a friendly people here. It's just everyone that is drive by is staring at you. Like they're seeing a person like me for the first time. It's so unique experience. It's probably not many places in the world where you can get this kind of interaction with everybody. And then everyone like understands you and speaks English. It's just unbelievable. Look at this place. It's so nice. That's so funny. Everyone says Kano or Americano. And also, if some of these videos go into this remote area, it's inspired you to do the same. I highly recommend you guys to tip whenever you can. It means the world to them here living in these remote areas. For example, it was 20 pesos for the halal. 20 pesos. So again, 50 and that just makes a whole difference for them. Because they might be living in a place like that. Look at this area, guys. How stunning is this? Look at that. Another rock formation too. Look at that. They're always curved up here. Nice. It's perfect. Fun to win, please. We're buying lunch now, because it's hard to find food on the island. So fish is the best option. I decided to just drive around the island. So came back. And as you know, we were searching for a little bit of food. But apparently there's like a birthday party here. They're invited because we're lunch. So guess if we found lunch. Come on. Don't be already eating. Hello. Hello. My name is Kano, not Joe. Kano. There's even a massive lecj√≥n. That's a big one. I was searching for food on the whole island. Come back and there's this. Alright Kyle and Mike just came back. But we just woke up from awesome nap after a hot, hot day. And we're re-energizing.
