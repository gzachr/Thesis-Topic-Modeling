 Oh my f**k. That smells amazing. Oh my god my mouth is literally watering. Let's get a little bit of this. It smells like vinegary. Right. It's like so soft. Oh my god. I'm not being dramatic. That is one of the nicest flavours and that felt so good to bite into. That literally dropped. That was so juicy. Oh my god. So is this crevice? It's one of the bigger cities. So let's see how it is. Wow that is intense. There's so much flavour packed into this thing. I don't even know where to start. There's actually kind of different cuts of meat and the version we ordered is spicy. So I'm kind of sweating right now. So there's two different cuts. Skin has never looked so delicious. Let's try it on. Oh my god. Unbelievable crunchy. Hold on let's have another bite. Crunch scam. They like when I crunch into the mic so then they can hear it. I don't know if they really like that. I like it. Some of the lechon. Oh my god. You know me guys. I'm not a huge fan of pork but this is my new favourite pork dish. Really? Oh my god. That's a very strong statement. I'm usually having no idea. It's so filthy. You try that. You bite the bite now. Let me see. Try the bite. Right now? Just the scam. Yeah. How crunchy it is.
