Nanaiko didn't take the money from the house. He didn't want to go there, but he just wanted to get the money. Nobody here uses the belt. You're not a takeoff. Oh, okay. You're like a sand dog.

You can't see but it's amazing. Oh. Crushed with Katriona Grey. Good choice! She's going to make it to the finals. She's got a great dress. She has a volcano on her dress. So, she's got a crush on Katriona Grey. She's very pretty now. She's sexy. I love her that dress. Oh my god. I love her. I love her. I love her. Crushed with a girl. She's got a girl. But if she's in love with Katriona Grey. She's got Angel Loxin on her face. Yeah. Number one. I don't think you're the real celebrity. Oh. Yeah. I'm a girl. I'm a girl. I'm a girl. I'm a girl. I'm a girl. I'm a girl. For the team, Takia. So, since we just talked about celebrity crushes, who are your favorite love teams? I just want to say Claudine and Sereko. I love teams like huge things and different things. I know that team. Team number two? It's too old for you. I'm glad you liked Moira and her... but she's an unexplored one and so on. I'm glad you liked her too. For me, I'm the vice-president of the team. For James, I'm the name of the team, the last three. The sexist. That's the question. I love the break. Broke up too. You need many bro cups. All of you guys are. You're not either. You're just team Catherine, but not Catherine. I liked your answer, but number three, I don't think you're the real Filipino. Sure. Sure. The answer is, Bung. Bung, you're good. What is a go-to karaoke song for you? For you, but for your titos and titas. I like the titos and the titas. I like the titas. I like the one. Number two. It's not a real Filipino. I see. I don't think. I don't think. You're the top three. I really don't know. Number one. Tell us about yourself. How was your life in the Philippines? I was just kidding. I was just kidding. I was just kidding. I was just kidding. Okay, Rika. Who are you eliminating? Number three. Number two. Oh! You're the best. We are not saying the many pack-out song too. Of course. Of course. I'm so sorry. I thought he would make it to the end. I'm only waiting more towards one for sure. But I guess one of my last questions is, what makes you the most proud to be Filipino? The Filipino song is the most beautiful. The other people are very proud of it. The Filipino song is the most beautiful. That's a big mistake. It's not a big mistake. It's a big mistake. I'm thinking about it because if you're going to get a lot of money, you'll get a lot of money. And you'll get a lot of money. Those are great answers. I want to cry. So for the final round, Rika, who do you think is the imposter? Number two. She guessed it right. She guessed it right. She guessed it right. It's a song. You think of your blindfold? Wow. Rika. That was such a great video. What was the biggest giveaway for you? What did you say? Claudine Bareto and Rika Yap. Rika Yap. Who knows those people? Nobody knows those people. But I know them. I don't know. Rika Yap. Rika Yap. It was honestly a lot for me than I thought. Everyone's accent was pretty dang good. But yeah, it just made me really proud to be a Filipino and seeing my fellow. Yeah, fellow, something to be known. It was just really cool to see. Ah, what a sweet video. Really enjoyed it. I hope you did it as well. What is with us speaking today? It's so good. It's such a good video. Great questions. Because it has a lot to do with the culture and how people are in general. And of course the accent. It's also with celebrity and pop culture. It's just so on point. Really enjoyed it a lot. Yeah, I hope you did too. And I'll see you guys next time here on Wooddox Philippines. Bye.
