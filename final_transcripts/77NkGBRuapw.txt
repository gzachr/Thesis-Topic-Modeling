We're so excited to be in the Philippines. So today we're going to do... We are going to the Kawasana here as we call it. The Canyon Earing. The Canyon Earing. I'm a little nervous. I don't know why I'm. Maybe I didn't know why. It's quite a high to jump. You don't have to jump. We met some people and they said that they were in a group that couldn't even swim. So I think you'll be. Yeah, I think you'll be fine. We're going to take the GoPro and take you along with us. So yeah, stay tuned. We're just going to go grab some food as well. We're in a rush. In a rush, as always, you know. For 50 minutes to get food. To get food and walk into towns. Yeah. It's windy. It's super windy. I'm wetty still about. I'm wetty still. Yeah, going away.

We're only in the front of the instrument. A few weeks. Maybe just over two weeks. So... Yeah, we wish we were here for a like a month. But we are only here for two weeks so we're doing everything pretty, pretty quickly. So we're on like a tight schedule. We've actually planned where we're going for the whole time. But normally, we literally just get to a place and then look at the day before. So... Come with us to be an all crazy rapid journey. We have got our breakfast guys, the smoothie balls here aren't insane. Look at that presentation. It's exciting. You don't want to eat it, so pretty. No. Home it's on. Wow, mate, that is a look. Look at these beautiful cramps. Oh, I'll put the link in these down below guys. So we've got a 45 minute walk to the waterfall in our helmets. We were going to dwell, there's a zip line that goes straight down to the bottom and it looks actually really sick, but it was like extra. Yeah, we didn't pay. We have like 10 hand extra, but we've done so many zip lines while being away, so sweating so bad. I'm 30 minute walk. We've made it. Oh, there's a butterfly. The water's so clear. Like a living room. Wow. Go! Woohoo! Yeah. Okay. Jump! Okay, here you go. Six minutes. Yes! Go for that head. Go for that head. Alright. Okay. You can do it. Ready? One, two, three, two! Woohoo!

So, guys, we have just finished the best. But most exhausting day ever. Absolutely. We had such a good time, honestly. So good. I cannot recommend it enough. It was so good. It was such an adrenaline. It was so scary. It was so scary. It was about four hours. I went in saying, I won't do stuff that I don't want to do. Like, from two scares, I'm not going to... I probably won't jump. When I tell you I'm a instructor, he was so funny and like the best one. He was like, off you go. And I was like, no, I'm really scared. You go. I was like, I'm really scared. He was like, no, off you go. And I was like, yeah, I'll go. And then, yeah, we jumped off everything. We did the highest one and... 10 meter jump. 10 meter. We didn't turn down anything, actually. We even swam. Yeah. Under. You see the video, but under a waterfall, which was actually really scary. That was really scary. Because it was a really big waterfall, as well. And it was like, you know, when it falls on you, it's so heavy. And then you get a drag to under in the current. So you have to swim out. And it's like you're swimming against being pushed under, really. It's a bit scary, but we made it alive. So... It's 20 to 6. 20 to 6. I had some food there. Yeah, that was so nice. We're going to have a chill for maybe like two hours. Get rid of it. And then we're going to go out for some more drinks. Yeah, we're going to go out and see what party like is party party and life is like. And maybe do some karaoke, as that's really big here in Philippines. But yeah, honestly, we absolutely love it here in Philippines. We love it. I don't want to leave ever. Absolutely love it. So yeah. So we will leave a link down below to tell you anyone who's in the Philippines travelling if you want to come and do the water can tanning. Yeah. So I literally just found them. I literally wanted to talk and I was like, ten water canning in here. Yeah. And this was the first place that came up. Yeah, it was a good review. It was like a safe restaurant. It was like an official canning in website. So I just messaged them and I literally booked it this morning and they were like, what time do you want to go and we were like, I'm going to cry. Yeah, so we're looking up. So they picked us up, gave us food, did the whole tour, all the rides there and back and it was £20. Yeah, so we're leaving in the link below if you want to do that one because it was absolutely brilliant. We are ready to go out for dinner. We've had some nice ice clothes on. I'm wearing this shirt again because I absolutely am obsessed with it. I'm wearing a skirt. Who am I? I'm wearing shorts. We're going to go to a Greek that we've seen that looks really nice. So yeah, we're going to go to a Greek that we've seen in it and have a few drinks, maybe some cocktails. And yeah, just think of it overnight. I'm wearing this shirt. I'm wearing this shirt. I'm wearing this shirt. I'm wearing this shirt. I'm wearing this shirt. I'm wearing this shirt. I'm wearing this shirt. I'm wearing this shirt. I'm wearing this shirt. I'm wearing this shirt. I'm wearing this shirt. I'm wearing this shirt. I'm wearing this shirt. We're going to go to a Greek that we've seen in it. Good morning everyone. Right and Shine had a bit of a lay-in today because we ran out last night and we actually had the best time. We met this guy who follows our YouTube. His name is Roman. Roman. He was French and he was so nice. He literally just saw us and it came up so I was like, oh my god, I know that he was from YouTube. He was like, yeah, and he bought us a drink and we tried it in the whole night didn't we? Yeah, it was really good. He literally ended up spending the whole night with him and went partying and yeah, it was so nice to meet like you guys who follow us and then meeting you like in countries and it's so so cool to see. So yeah, it was so sweet for him to come and say hi and he bought us a drink as well. So yeah, but we thought we'd give him a little shout out. Woo! So yeah. But today is raining. It's usually so cloudy. So we wanted to do the sardines. Yeah. Basically today is our last full day and we want to do the sardines which is where you go to smoke and you can see like massive shells or sardines. I don't think we're going to be able to do that. No, it's not looking great for the weather but I think we're going to go grab some food. Have some, have a milkshake. And walk around. We look, we absolutely. We look awful. Yeah, we do look awful. But we absolutely love it here. I don't want to leave. I wish we had so many more days. I wish you had another week in the Philippines because we just stay here. We absolutely love this place. Everyone's so friendly. Like all the locals and everything. We went from the bar to the party bar. With the guys that were running the bar. And they were like, I'll come here and we were like, okay. And then they were really nice. They were almost so friendly. So good. She is so excited for her sardines. I mean, she's sardines. She's running. She's packing her bag. We need to be quick. Oh, sir. To get her sardine running. We need to be quick. Sardines are going to still be there, don't worry. No, they won't. She's off. Bye. We are go-prowing time and going to head down to the beach. And hopefully seeing loads of sardines. Yeah, we're excited for this one. We're so excited. I am so excited. So hopefully there's loads and loads. If I don't see a sardine, I'll be so excited. I'll be going to work. I'll have the most upset girlfriend in the world. Anyway, let's go. Oh, snorkels. It was about £5 to rent the snorkels in life jackets. We are actually... Oh, that's calm. It is cold. We are actually good swimmers, but we thought we'd get life jackets because you can do it for way longer. So you get really tired. So you can just float around here. So we'll take them off. Play how you're looking with yours. It's really shallow, but the sides are really far out. There's loads of people up there. So hopefully they've seen some sardines. Sardines. Sardines. We're coming for you. Sorry, you're going to have to be here. We've actually kept our crocs on because it's so rocky, but I'm not sure if this is a good idea. I hope you're loving our look right now. So we're see. Okay, yeah. I'm glad we got a shrieks on. Yeah. Crocs, gans. Basically, we'll just go out to wherever everyone else is. Okay, so there's like groups everywhere. So they've all got tall guides. Yeah, we're just going to... Hopefully, five on. We must be able to see. There's loads of people out here. Right. See you in a minute. Hopefully with the sardines. Guys, as of yet, we have not found any sardines, but we found a massive turtle that was sick. We'll try to find the sardines now. Hopefully, we'll find some. Okay. I'm getting... I'm thinking about like, I don't know if I can find some sardines. Oh, it's going to stop this thing. I think of my life as a little... I don't go. I've been sardines. Oh, it goes down to the same. It's the tons of them. I don't think the GoPro shows how sick that is, guys. Like, there's hundreds of sardines. I can... I don't know how to have the GoPro. Yeah. That's so sick. I've had a lot of good luck. I don't know why I find it so hard. I can't hold my breath at all. So we actually forgot to say anything about the sardines yesterday, but we saw... I mean, you can see anyway from the video that we saw absolutely million sardines. We just looked at the millions of them. They were just like... Like, we... Our first, we saw the turtles which were so cool. And then we were like, where are the sardines? And we just swam a bit further. And like, when you look down there, it was just like literally millions of them by your feet. It was really cool, wasn't it? It was so... So cool. Tegan stayed afloat with her like... I stayed up the top because I was looking after all the stuff. She was scared that the sardines were going to nibble pecky. No, I was actually more scared of the turtle because that was huge. It was big. Yeah, it was really cool. We want to do it again, but we're depending on the weather. Yeah, the weather as we just showed you is stormy. So hopefully it can't sound them if you're going to it again because it's a really good activity to do this. It's also free, apart from like hiring a life jacket. Guys, it was so, so hot and sunny. And it's just... I'll give you the camera mate actually and you can show how windy it's gone. It was actually like bright blue sky in there ago. I think the end of the tornado is still hanging about. This roof is about to fall off. Wooo! May is trying a Filipino dish, what's it called? Chicken or doby? Chicken or doby? It looks banging. That's a jar. Big puff. I just tried that one and it is insane. So yeah, really, really nice. Really, really nice Filipino traditional dish. Maze on the beer. I'm on the coke as I'm a bit of an o益. I'm happy. It seems lively tonight, aren't there? So we are actually going to close the video out here just because we've done so much in this video. And yeah, we're going to start the next one. We're going to do a good two days. Yeah, it's been two days. We've been doing a lot really good few days. And we also have extended our stay here for a bit. I don't know if we said that one day. We were supposed to go to a lot of island to see Quichero. Or we were going to go like, someone like that for two nights. But it was working out, it was going to be too exciting. It was going to be like 20, 30 pounds to like each to get a ferry over there. And we're going to have a taxi in the state. When we really like it. We love it. We're like, we'll just stay here for a little two nights. And yeah, we'll move on whenever we do. Yeah, so thank you guys so much for watching. We hope you enjoyed this one as well. It's been a really fun, really fun vlog. It's probably one of our favourite vlogs actually, because we've just done so much in it. And yeah, it's been really, really good. We're so tired now. Anyway, we're going to see you in our next video. So, like and subscribe and follow our Instagram back packing gowns. And we will see you next time. See you! Bye!
