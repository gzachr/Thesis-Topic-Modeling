 Good morning world from the jungle we're here in Shagal. In the north part of the island and we are driving up to Jungle Cafe today. It is coming up to the wetter seasons and it is getting tricky to drive up these roads but we managed to make it okay. I do feel like if it was super rainy we might not have been able to get up very easily. But here we are. We have a Ryan. We have Stowe's already in. She's just run straight in. She's run straight in. It's even what's just going to order so you might even go and place the order for us. When we first arrived here it was complete silence up in the hills. Now I can hear stories sweet voice. I'm going to check now. Yeah you go out the car and it was just silent. No noise at all. Lovely, so peaceful. You can actually hear the wind rustling through the leaves. Let's see if we can pick that up. Stowe's already gone into the restaurant. Set up the tables. Move some chairs around. She's such a sweet kid. Stowe's very excited about her birthday. She's talking about it to everybody. I'm just going for a wander up the road here. Beautiful property here on the hillside. It actually reminds me a little bit of Europe. Sometimes when you go to a vineyard it looks a bit like that. This whole roadside has been cleared. A lot of grass cuttings been done here. Not many people come up to the north of Shagel so it's always peaceful. Can I have the... Can I have more swan? You put in them big jungle lights. Yeah. Always be worried. The other lights be around. I see how that every time I come here. Yeah. I'm going to come here. You always order that almost and... Yeah. The AC. That's what we're going to do. It was quite your eye there. It's one of those slacklines. Can you help get on it? I'm going to like... balance myself with my knees. I'm going to try doing that. That sounds impossible but maybe you can try it. Can you help me get up? I'll try. Quite high. I'm fine. You walk like same thing as in case I fall, okay? Just try it without my... It's hard enough to hit with the... It's not like the show. Every time I got to this edge bit here, I normally do it in a dance. So I'm going to attempt number one. Hello. You didn't even try. I did. One day. I like this table set up. It's very Japanese. It's only two cushions. I'm going to sit on the stool. You put way too far. It's big enough for two butts, isn't it? Yeah. Massive cushion, isn't it? Slow down. This. This is the three. Store is fair for it. What are you drinking there, Storie? And drinking. Ginger jungle juice. It's really nice, isn't it? It's so nice. I love the spice. It feels like you're drinking health. Thank you. Yum. That is good. It's for health in you. Yeah. This was 250 pesos. Not pounds, pesos. Goodness, that was 250 pounds with the brook. You never need money left. This is my ginger juice. And this is my yummy hummus. 120 pesos for this. Yeah. I have my yummy yummy collection. Even got mint leaf. Oh yeah, I didn't see that. Well, I thought that was just a normal leaf. Look at this beautiful little coffee. From this perspective, you wouldn't know the size, but you could tease him next to it. You can see the size of it. It's lovely. This isn't espresso macchiato. It's a very Italian style coffee, isn't it? I already caught you, so I know you've had that here before and you liked it. Here's my first dish of the day. The wild jungle bowl, which is a smoothie bowl, made with mangoes, bananas, and there's some goji berries and homemade granola. We also got an iced coconut latte. Did you see you wanted to try a goji berry? Okay. Okay. Here they go. I'm going to finish this mouthful. Okay. It is time to try a goji berry. I don't really like it. Why? What's it taste like? Taste like weird. Yes. The remind me of green tea. I can leave. I can leave the berry, but like a raisin texture. I also have raisins in the granola. Ice smoothie bowl looks a bit more decadent, and it has pineapple banana and cacao nibs in it. Some sesame seeds on the top, and both of these smoothie bowls were 250 pesos each. Look. It's so yummy. You're going to miss it. Yeah. When you look at it this way, it looks like this smoothie bowl is a sky. The banana is awesome grass, and then this is how many leaves they minced, of course. And then this is like the grass. Yeah, you can see that. This. Very creative mind you have. Good thinking. Sweet puppies. It's trying to escape the step. It's probably the first time ever coming down the stairs. Oh no, I thought it was coming down the top. It's supposed to be the mum and dad are reckon with you reckon. Yeah. It looks a bit daddyish this boy. We heard that screeching noise when we first got here. We're trying to figure out what it was. And now it's seen the puppy trying to escape the room. It's daddy. Nice sweetie. I like this colour pattern. See it quite a lot on the island, don't you? A bit like a hyena. It's straight here. It comes to see me, look. And a face. Do you like that sound? Is that your kid? I like this dog. Much smaller than Poppy though. Hi. Is it nice and cool under there? It's the thing your feet set. Run underneath the deck. Yeah. Such as that for you. I'll let the mum. Does it go in story? Yeah, really good. Beautiful artwork. You can sell that. A kid can tell. It could be your job. The picture loves me. Do you like the puppy? Yeah. Is that a closer look? Can you explain things? So, this one working on is me. I'm going to like rub out these gate bits to put my head. Nice head. And then I did the puppy. This is tiny tiny, too tiny. And I did the other dog. The hyena. Hyena, yeah. That's what you're wearing now. You're making the pants look. I did the whole scenery here. And I did the palm tree thing right there. I've been appreciating recording the natural sounds of the jungle today. Every time I come here, I think about the sounds of nature. And because it is nature. It is. I like the fact that it's jungle cafe. It's up in the hills. Not many people know about it. It's not public. Here's public. Oh. Yeah. How the people can come here. People staying in the rooms here as well. Not many people know about it in the shop. It's because people don't come up north enough, do they? Yeah, they don't. Because we know about it. Because we live it in the north. Yeah, we do. We live in the middle of the north. Yeah, like at the bottom of the middle of the north. Haha. It's a bit too much, isn't it? At home today, actually, we ordered a new microphone for our camera. So yeah, it should change the way that we record sound. Looking forward to trying it out. And yeah, I'm excited, actually, to change the way we record the vlogs as well. Like to capture what we're seeing and what we're hearing in a different way. So hopefully it's arrived when we get back to the house. You check it out later. Yeah, maybe there will be like a parcel right outside the door. It's possible. Okay, we just paid the bill. How much is the total, Sash? 1,200. 1,200 for everything. And we're going to go and check out the rooms, yeah? 17 days. Story's so excited to tell everyone about our upcoming ship to Japan. We're checking out the rooms now. Yes. We have stayed here once before, which I'm sure we say every time we come here. We've stayed in the room before and Jay's mum pop our stadium is from here. And we're going to go and check the maps. We haven't been here in the room since the storm. So just see if there's any difference from before. Yes, the big typhoon that destroyed the island. There's cute steps here. Cute little logs. She's off. Yeah. Yeah, we actually stayed in the serene story. It's been so long. Story's grown up a few years since she can't remember at all staying here. Yeah, it looks the same. Did this get damaged during the storm? Same, same, but you know, the other typhoon with it that's broke. That's why it's very... So mostly the roof was damaged, but otherwise the walls and everything's still the same. All damaged. Okay, so you lost the roof, but now it's the same layout like before. I remember it. It feels like the same like last time. There is a big bandage. Yeah, it's been repaired. It's looking good. Oh yeah, that's cute. And the bathroom, everything you need. Very cute. It's a very nice room. It's a vlogger. Yeah. It's nice to have a new one. Yeah, this is new. Yeah. It's all there was to squeeze. A lot to squeeze. This is nice, though. Nice deck. So we need to cut the grass to cross it. So yeah. So very difficult now that it's ruined. Yeah, it's cool. Oh, how cute. Now you can see how small it is. It's the one. Oh, it's so small. How old is she? I think no. I don't know. I think one more. One more. One or two months. So small. Hello, baby. Look at you. Do you have a knife? Do you? Do. Yeah. Do you have a knife? Do you have a knife? No. Yeah. Do you have a knife? Yeah. We do this thing. This thing. No, baby pops up. He likes to always follow the mother. Oh, yes. He's done a mist dump. He's always crying. He heard that. He put the coffee with the tea. I don't know. She goes. She goes crazy. It's got like two brown bits around the eyes and the chin. Look. Nice patch. Yeah. Nice white patch. He goes. Should we get another puppy? One dog is enough. Dog is enough. Oh, she. Very sweet. No. We'll see you next time we see Gio's to commit this big. Yeah. No. Yeah. We should try and remember her size now. And then we'll see her next month. Is your comeback again? Yeah. We'll see you now. Did you take a picture of her with stories now? Yeah. Do it now. Take another one. Hi, not Gio. It's like a gift. Hopefully what you're doing. What are you doing, puppy? That's not yours. That is my phone. Like that. What are you doing, puppy? I'm not sure. I actually got the full thing in the mouth. Can you get an opening for me? Go ahead and put your hand box to the microphone for us. Actually I really, I feel the whole thing. No, I don't want to actually damage the microphone. And I go get some scissors so you can help get it out. And I'm going to snatch it from you. Snutch. Oh yes, puppy. I'm boxing. This is the new microphone. I'm buzzing. We've got it from. No, soda. It was one of the cheapest microphones you could get online. So we're going to take it out on the beach and see if it improves the audio. These are the, the, the, the, yeah. This is the wrong one. No, sorry. This is the one. Are you ready to take some subtle spots out? So apparently if I just plug this into the bottom of our phone camera, it should improve the audio. So let's give it a go. This goes in for me here somewhere. And this plugs into the phone. This is the audio without. And then this is the sound with it on. Let's go over here and see if you're getting a nice clear sound. What if I go behind here? Come back again. So we've got two microphones on now. Story, do you want to give it a chat? Yes. Can you hear story over there? Hello. Story is all the way over there. In the kitchen. Oh baby, I've never seen you before. Oh baby, when did you come from? What do we mean? Yeah, guess that's it. Oh baby. I'm really far away from you now. So you go test it on the beach? Yes. All right, let's do an outdoor test. Story is over there. In the distance. Are these just going to be singing constantly now? I just now got an actual microphone. Yeah. You're a real singer. Actually, I could actually do that on the beach. You could do that. Yeah. I'll do it before I fill the beach. Poppies out for her evening world. And it'd be good to see if this works well or gets winded as well. Because normally this beach walk is quite windy. That's true. I actually think that your audio is going to be quite muted now. I mean to be honest, in normal circumstances, Sasha and I would be wearing the microphones. And then we would just talk freely. And if story was nearby, we would capture. Just like we do normally. Yeah. Okay. What can you see down there? In here, McLean. The waves are actually quite big when you're over here. Yeah. And quite wide too. And quite wild. We've got our microphones right under our chins. See if we can improve the kind of all over experience. Of the vlogs. Especially when we go to Japan, we want to focus on what it sounds like there. That is going to be a completely new country for us. Whenever we go somewhere new, we like to record the noise so that we can remember exactly how it was. I think it's still saying something. This is a problem actually. Because I've got no idea if she's just like making random noises in the distance. Obviously watching this back, you guys know exactly what story's saying. Woohoo! Were you saying something? Yes. Hello. Oh, just hello. I've heard as well that with these microphones, if somebody's facing the other way, it won't be too good. It might have to invest in the third microphone for you. Oh no. Hey! Hey! She's probably sitting there. Hey, drop your bees. None of that. She's actually dug a hole right underneath you. Look at that. Oh, the whole bee. She digs a hole. She's trying to dig you into the ground. Hoppy, you are a bee. She's not open to the distance and it was a little bit... Oh my goodness. Madness. Hoppy. Are you having the most fun ever? That is funny. We're going to go inside. What are you doing? What are you doing? Today, this shelter is going to... Rose Johnson! Yes, I think it's becoming a member. And like I said, if you want to become a member yourself, click on that drawing button down below. Good work. Sorry, amazing. Now I can do like a performance. Okay, we've changed microphone position now. Sasha's got the mic down here on her waist. It's still here. Why don't you have a little chat as well? So we can see if it picks up your voice. I can't keep that microphone. Well, it is right next to you. That's what we're testing, isn't it? To see who can wear it, how far away we can be from each other. Yeah. Hello, my name is Storie. And today, I am going to do a performance just for you to see... two, one. I feel too high. Please come back, yes, let's say... Oh, it is! You're not afraid of performing, you see? Oh, it is! Please come back. Good performance. Well done. Thanks. So we are going to end the vlog today, aren't we, Storie? Yes, we are. The story said she wants to end it far away. Yes, let's do that. Come on then. Oh my goodness, that's really far away. This is the end of the vlog. Hope to enjoy that. So, bye! Hey. Eight miles from home, bye! We're all those credits. Oh! I just wanted to get him to make up his mind.
