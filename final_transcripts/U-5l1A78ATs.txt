 Did you find any Filipinos? Oh yeah, I'm actually... I didn't even know, when I was like a club eating, like a first day in college. I don't remember it, but I actually signed up for the Pina Club. What club? The Pina Club. There's a club called the Pina Club. Really, in university, in Hawaii? Yeah, my university. Well, really. And then you sign up, but you're not Filipino. Oh, they're like, oh, come here, sign this sign. You don't have to come, you just sign up for the sign, did it? Then, like, three days ago, I realized they took $50 from my car. I've got to show up, next thing. Because a lot of my friends are actually in it. It's pretty fun. It's like most fun people. Everyone said, like, Filipino. Like, crazy, most fun. What does the club do? I think they're like making Filipino food, like learning languages. and I don't know if they learn English.
