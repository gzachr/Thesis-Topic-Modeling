 This is totally different. It's like a Jinnu. Hi everyone! This is Jessica and welcome to the very first episode on Korean Atte series here on Thomas Club. So in the Korean Atte series, a lot of different Koreans try a variety of Filipino cuisine starting from Filipino snacks, Filipino instant noodles, to authentic Filipino dishes. And for today's episode, I'm going to let my fellow Koreans try the one and only Pinoy Spaghetti. There are lots of variations of spaghetti out there starting from the original, I guess the authentic Italian tomato spaghetti, to Korean style spaghetti. You know, there is a Korean version of spaghetti and the Pinoy Spaghetti. And I would say it's very unique on its own so I'm very excited to let a different Koreans try it as well and see their reactions. So let's go ahead and see how they react to it. So beside me, I have two Korean male guests. Can you briefly introduce yourself? I'm a professional Chinese actor who is currently in the musical actor's field. Ma Gan Gang, Ha Poon, Ako Si Subia.

It's a joke. I'm a joke. And one of their main menu is the Pinot's Look at it. Pinot's spaghetti is very different. If you have spaghetti, there's a lot of Italian and traditional spaghetti. There's a Korean style spaghetti. It's a classic style. But it's a very unique style. It's a very, very exotic style. So we're just going to try it right away. Yeah. Okay. Wow, look at this.

Of course. The meat is very crispy and the sausage is chewy. It's like a half-salted egg. I think it's delicious, but the sauce is good. It's sweet. Really? It's sweet, but it's very different from Korean. It's like kimchi. I like sweet things, but I don't think it's a good idea to give it to a stranger. Is that so? Yes, it's good. It's like kimchi.

It's called party food. If you go to party, there's a lot of people. That's it for me. I like parties. Never mind. You guys all have that party food. Possibly.

This is like not dry. It's good. I think this is better than the meat. Oh, right. Because when you come here, the noodles are very... It's very soft. And the sauce itself is just... It looks a little stiff. It's like a regular western-style sauce. But the sauce is soft and soft. It's soft and soft. It's soft and soft. It's very soft. It's not like you're going to eat it. I'm going to dip it in the sauce. Do you want to buy this at Jolly Bee? I think I want to try it. I think I should try it. I think I should try it. I'm not. Yeah, I'm not. How much?
