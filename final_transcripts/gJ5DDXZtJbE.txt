 Vitya Friday. Differently. Let's take TikTok challenges to a new level. So I've told Bala about this video. You guys have sent me plenty of this video. She has not seen it. I've seen bits and bobs. But I know where he's capable of this. Jason Thief is like a tiny god. He is a big god. And he's going to try Riff and runs from all over TikTok. This is going to be cake for you. And I want to see what Baleska had to say about it. And I don't understand much of technicalities that much. So let's go. I'm going to just pick random videos. Random videos. Try this one. Bruno Mars Riff. For reals, oh just. Done. That was pretty good. I know he's going to tweak that ending of that first riff and to get it super accurate. But he's like the king of accurate. But you're, you're, I'm pretty sure he'll get it. For reals, oh just. Told ya. Yeah. Broom. Correct. That's pretty good. Check my count. Oh, so from Indonesia has that really good take on this. That's very good. That's very good. Oh, this is a blazer. Pretty. Yeah, yeah. Oh, you know what? Yeah, I would be pretty satisfied with that too. Yes. Because you know the difference between the first riff and the second riff is that the first riff you have glottals to actually work with. So the glottals will allow you to find your path through the riff quite easily. You have an actual physical anchor there. But when you're working on an open vowel like an A sound, you have no glottals to close into the note. So you're kind of gliding through, through nothingness. And it's quite hard to get those type of runs, open vowel runs cleaner than a close glottal run. Oh, we love her. Yeah. Okay, I remember when this movie came out. How do you remember that? No, the first few were like, colon response was quite easy. That's really actually really easy to remember. The last run though, I remember when this movie came out and everybody was doing that. And I was like, I can't. That's crazy. Christina Gulerra. Yes. Funny. Funno is it again, time. Let me hear you say, yeah. We be, we be. Yeah. We be, we be. Yeah. We be. Yeah. We be. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is like, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm suffering. You know? Yeah. I was like, yeah. Yeah. You know. That's just it. That's why I'm like, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Why are you here? Yeah. Oh yeah. Hi. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Bye. You know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I love the reverb. I love the reverb. He's mashed it. He knew he smashed it. Oh, I need it. I'll be next. That's very nice. Okay. Jason, Jason, Jason, my man. Can I just say that is clean. Also, it's a very good approach to how you can map out a really difficult run. Because in this, you have a combination of up of miles and and and glossos because of the Y. You have like a little bit of a closing like a closing environment to start off the riff. So it's it's a combo of the two the first two riffs that we were seeing. Right. So those are two techniques coming together. But what he did really cool that will help anybody that's trying to learn how to do riffs or sing overall is like map it out in a more comfortable key if you're singing a capella to try to figure out what the dynamics of the actual path of the riff will be and then try it in the actual or ridiculous. Yeah. Hard. Yes, bro. Tough. Did you see that moment of like the stupid? Am... Is that your style? It's a little bit more relaxed. Okay. Nice, nice. Nice. That was way better. Yes, literally. That deserves it. King, king, king. Also, that is just king behavior. I adore the fact that you can actually hear the break in his natural register, which is so human. It's so cool because a lot of people try to hide that or like find a way to modulate through it. But I think it's so cool when it goes right. Which is so difficult. This dude is the master. Love. Next. Oh my god, he also finishes in the seventh. There's no resolution. I have no idea how to do that. Less impossible. Yeah, you didn't last no. Okay, yes. Okay, it's immensely quick. Oh, wait, he's so good at that. That's a really good riff. Yeah, yeah, okay. Yes, what? Yeah, that's pretty much. Basically, fuck it. Did that. That's where you put that like a sigma male meme into. Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing. Hi. Hi. Hi. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, wait, stay. Hey. Hey. Oh. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Tori Kelly is no joke, bro. She's back. She's back. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. They asked you how you were. They asked you how you were. They asked you how you were. You're not really. Hey. Hey. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. You know what's funny? You know what? You know what? You're also, you're also seeing a little bit of a tig here. Riffing takes a lot of mental power more than he does. The map of the underground system in the Philippines. I do not know. She looks like that. Rando. So doing riffs is a mentally taxing thing. It's quite difficult. And also when you're being so specific with listening and repeating in terms of a precision, it's one of the most difficult things to do. And they're really demanding in a lot of ways, not not not physically. But you know, when you study really hard and then you hit like a point where no matter how much you repeat the same phrase, it won't go through your brain. That type of mental exhaustion happens when you're trying to learn or practice riffs. So this is the point where being tired mentally would actually be. Right, because there's done so many reps of different stuff as well. Yes. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's a bit. It's not bad though. It's not bad though. It's not bad though. It's not bad though. It's not bad though. It's not bad though. It's not bad though. It's not bad though. It's not bad though. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Try it out then you want to know. You're an octave. Oh. It's still. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Yep. Yep. Yeah. You know, you know the beauty when he went into the falsetto register there is that his vowels became very rounded and so he opened more of this like a resonant space in his jaw. So a lot of it was really warm and open in this manner. So it's easier to also maintain some of that smooth sounding element of it all without losing without losing the edge of a falsetto because a lot of the times when may also go into falsetto, it can sound a bit twangy. Right. You can pierce through that one's nest. And this is a really good way to maintain the sound really warm up for Jason. He's no joke man. He really is. He's like a good photographer. Sounds like I'm real. And an amazing fashion style. Like let's just put it out there. King behavior. So I just thought we'll share some love because this we got sent so often and I was like this is fucking ridiculous. This is stupid. That's amazing. So let us know what you guys thought about it. If it's any other videos you like my list or me to have a look at will be more than happy checking. It's super cool.
