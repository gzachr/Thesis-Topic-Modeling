 with your Friday. The freshest. So it's graduation season. Is it? It is. It is, everybody is graduating. So congratulations to all of you who have made it. Congrats, everyone who graduated. I think it's because of that reason that I keep getting sent these types of videos. Yes, yes. So in the Philippines, they don't do things sort of a normal way. Where you do sort of it, you go, may it your diploma, throw your heart in the air. And later. Now in the Philippines, I think they sort of, I don't know, truly believe they live in their musical. Ah, rightfully so, like everybody should. And everyone sings. But you won't believe me when you see this shit. Okay. This is what it looks like. This is the soloist. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. What do you mean? What do you mean? There's a whole band. There's a whole band playing. There's not a playback. What? I think the first day of the week, I call my home. I think the whole world, who organized this, this is rehearsals. What? They can say it all sounds great. They can say whatever they want for you, rock Philippines. Oh, girls in the top, okay. It's so obvious that they had to sing. Like, it is great. What is the soloist? I think the whole world is going to be a great song. And now, you might think, Oh, you know, this is probably just one of them, right? It's one of them. What? What do you mean? What is that? That is so cool. I'm going to get pulled over there. Brother BTS Army likes to sing. It's like a musical, right? It is. It probably is like a musical. Some may say like a high school musical. What? It is high school musical. What? What is this gymnasium? Why does everybody get graduated? What is happening? It's like a fran from the Philippines. I respect anyone who learns this choreo. That is red. It seems the same sort of school, right? Is it the same school? It was the same gymnasium. You would think, right? No, how about you do something a bit more trendy? We are the dreamers. Look at that shit. Look at the teeth. Look at the teeth. Look at the teeth. Oh, yeah. The little girl sitting in the audience. How is this a thing? I'm just trying to pass. 2022, 2023. People, these guys are going forward. Who organized these things? And these are high school graduates. It's not even university graduates. They look fairly young, right? So, I would presume. I know, I'm fairly gop smacked. Yes, on fairs, some people leave the dream I wanted to have. Literally, we would be graduating. It's the lamest shit ever. Please, please, never come back. But you see, it's always here. Oh my god, but this is so many people. They definitely pack so much more people in there than the other ones. Where is the band? Where is the live music band? Oh, I can't see. Where are they? How do they not hop? They're slack of here. I'm sure it happens. I remember back home, those freaking gymnasians are hot. We once did a performance. It was with a choir, actually. We was in a choir, these. And I would be the percussionist for the choir. You remember when the girls started passing out on stage? We were performing in this sort of, I don't know. Like a gymnasium. A lot of people fit in there, but the oxygen was like... A minus one. And these girls, she was standing right behind us. This girl just fucking went like this. This is her. The presuming name was Catherine, right? This is Catherine. The Catherine was singing. And everyone was singing. And then all of a sudden I just see her. And he's like, boom. Yeah, that was... Gunsky bro. She had them on by-o-ones. He was very very fortunate. Dude, she went like... And we were like, oh my god. Did someone die? No. She got knocked at the fuck out. But she was like that. And then here, she was like that on the fucking gonkery bro. She was like, oh my god. She's dead. Oh my god, I just witnessed the murder. Yeah, yeah. It was really bad. And I remember when you had like karate, like... Competition. It was sort of an environmental thing. It was like similar to this place. And I remember being like, I freaking hated it near. It's so hot in here. It's proper damp. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like... Just, yes, feet. You're just breathing carbon dioxide the whole time. But yeah, this is what I found. Everyone keep ordering me this stuff. And I wanted to share it with you. Congratulations to all amazing graduates who not only graduated and since I have high school, but also performed so well. I think you might have been as well like just uni.
