So, essentially, all I have to say is this just excites me more and more mainly because of the fact that you can just see how people kind of get excited about it. Some people just have a very plain answer, which is just great. Just fantastic. I feel like maybe that's just enough. Some people, they always have very, very certain complaints, but from what I can see and what I've, all the things I've seen, actually, there's not really complaints like that. It's usually just nice people. They're very welcoming, which is important. In some countries, they're not very welcoming. They'll take you, right? If you go there, you pay for a flight, you get to the country, but they're not going to necessarily just welcome you open arms. Some people are very, very close to their own, like, kind. That's just how some people are or some cultures are. The Philippines, as it seems, is like very, very, very sweet people. They enjoy family time, karaoke. These are all things that I know, right? And it's just so amazing to then hear it from other people experiencing it for the first time, their first impressions being so great. I love that. It excites me.
