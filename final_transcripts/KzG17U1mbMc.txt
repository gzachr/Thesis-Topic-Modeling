 Thank you! Good morning everybody! Good morning! My boy, which one? I got that from Laga or Maya? Maya and Aga. Did you guys get that? I didn't call me the Laga. Look at that! Call it your color, Louis. Hilarious! Yes, what? This morning we were heading to Manila. But we're not at the airport. Nope. Nope. We are going to travel by boat. But we're not just going to travel on a regular boat. No, no, no. We're going first class. We don't know what to expect just to be very clear. You're knowing that. I'm going to have low expectations. That way it will be hopefully surpassed. We are here at the Togo ship. And we're leaving from Iluilo and in 22 hours from now. We will be in Manila. This is going to be really exciting. So when you first come in here, you got to pay 20 pesos. I'll be in that. For a monthly fee, that's correct. And we got a stay room, okay? So I believe it's about 8,500 pesos to do this. But think about it. It's like a hotel room for the night. As well as two people heading to Manila. So, you know. It's a decent place. All right. This is an experience we've been excited to try. So I'm really excited. But anyway, so after you do that, you go through the normal security checks. Like you imagine at an airport where you have to get your luggage checked and stuff like that. And then after that, you head over here and they will check your ID. All that good stuff. They're very friendly, by the way. See, this is not like at the airport. Everybody here is very friendly. Very nice. Yeah, so really check out your documents, everything. And that's it. You wait to be boarded. Yeah, I'm excited. I'm really fun. It's a big show. I am, I am, I am, I wasn't expecting how big the ship was. It's massive. Yes. I've only seen it from like a distance, right? So it's big. But it's like, I put them being right beside it. You're like, okay. It realizes that. It's massive. May I see it? And we got a great day. I guess I'm sweating. So you know, it's that kind of day. But it is, it's not cloudy. It's not overcast, not pouring rain. So we kind of lucked out. This is a great day to sail. Because there's not going to be a ton of wind and waves and stuff like that. But I don't know. Let's see. Let's see how this goes. I'm really, really excited too. Okay. Yeah, let's do it. Let's get on the boat. We are going to board now. We're going to sail. Yeah. Look how big it is. Look at a strong hand. It's a hot one. That's going to be fun. It's so pretty out today. Look at how big it is. Yeah, that is huge. Look at, you got to climb those stairs, guys. There right there. I wonder where you are. Holy. What are you guys? There isn't wheelchair here. So they might have a way for handicapped people. I don't know. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Look at this stairs. They're kind of funky. Yeah. Yeah. I'll look down. No, I don't want them. Wow. That's her bee. Made it up. Okay. Yeah, and you were carrying a suitcase. They do a porters by the way. We could have taken a porter. And hindsight, I would have taken a porter. It's like 50 pesos. Thanks. Look at the little one. Look at this. Look at this. Oh. Let me see. And there's the cockleong. You remember the cockleong? I know, I know. Oh, and there's a friend Kyle. He's filming us filming him. Let's get in here. No, I'm sorry. We've waited for the lady to move. There we go. All right. I don't want to show you too much. I don't want to. We're going to show you in a minute. So when you have the state room, you go here to the front desk, hand them to get the hand they hand you. A key. There it is. All right, let's go. Whoever they take you. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Are you guys ready? This is crazy. This is amazing. Very fancy. I'm very like, oh, okay. Can we say you're longer than a day? Right. More than a day. Is there any longer ones? We'll definitely stay on that. Look at it. So we have state room number 302. That's just getting more comfortable. Don't come visit us. By the time you watch this, it won't matter. All right. Let's go in and check this out. And so many amenities. Welcome to my MTV print. Welcome. We're going to brighten it up. All right. Okay. Start over here, young lady. So of course we have a little cabinet for all your clothes. Yeah. We're here for less than 24 hours. So we probably won't be doing that. But you'll never know. You're like jacket. It's okay. So you don't die. Maybe. French, of course, nothing in it. It's ready to go. It's okay. It's ready to go. But it's okay. Because you could order in room service. And now you have a fridge to put it in. Yeah. Yeah. And you can have it in room service here. Okay. That's where literally it's a hotel room. Like a nice hotel room. And you can have them bring you hot water. And then you can have coffee. Exactly. Exactly. Okay. So of course one of the the state room like what is what's the word? Like extras is it comes with a bathroom and a shower. I'm pretty sure the other ones are communal. So you have your own private bathroom here. I'll fill on the bathtub. Wow. Yeah. That is pretty nice. Oh look at that. It's got the music. Yeah. It's got the music. That is a booty toilet. It is got all the washing, the heating. I'm going to do that. Yeah. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. That's pretty cool. The major pan. The toilet game is like. Make your butt sing. Okay. So now we're into like the main room. Of course we have a working TV. And apparently it works throughout the whole trip. So that's cool. I don't know how sad it like works. So I guess like that makes sense. I don't know. Maybe it's not really cool. But either way TV. We have a TV. Okay. Obviously you have a little office space or makeup area. If you want to do that, that's your thing. You have a table to hold a meeting on your little trip. Beautiful. Look at that. Oh, it's somebody stands there. We can just create. Somebody can stand out there and watch us. It's good. It's good. And we have a table. It's a table. It's a table. And we have two of those windows. So we have really amazing views. I know. Like we haven't left yet. But you can just see like. Huh. You know, this is like the perfect view. If the weather was crazy. And you know how like you see videos. Sorry, sorry. There's lighting. You know how you see videos of like massive waves and stuff. Like hitting along the window. This would be the best view for that. Hopefully though we don't go for that. That's not going to happen. Because I feel like that is not something you actually want to be in the middle. You're not going into the middle of the ocean. You know, maybe we'll go off course or something. You know. By the way, you're going to smurray here? And it works. So cool. It's freezing in here. Even though the sun is literally beating right in us. In us into this room. The AC is keeping up. Perfect. Okay, so now of course we have beds. Separation because. No funny business on this boats. Okay. So you have two different beds. Anyways, it also. Star Trek command satir. You basically drive the boat from this. Like you get to decide where you want to go. I don't know. You got a bed lamp. You got the night light. Oh. You got a footlight. You've got speaker controls. You got an alarm clock. Oh, this is. Sealing light. Bed light. All the same thing. And a charging port here. For you to plug in. And then you have your telephone. Yes. And you can call room service. Oh. Yeah, there's nothing to ring. Of course you're going to get to. Yeah, automatically. Yeah, there's no buttons. I said, I didn't know. They're going to call back now. Way to go. Way to go. Okay, well, it works. It works. It does ring. I don't like talking on the phone though. So we're just going to protect it rings back. We're not here. So yeah, this is a room. We've got space for it. Time for your Pilates. Well, that was not Pilates. So yeah, this is the stay room. At to go. This one is for the trip from Elo to Manila. So there's different boats. And they might have different lengths. Like different amenities. This one's the. It starts with an end. The Mara Mara Sa, Sana Boat. And it's here. Okay, so for now, there's not much available yet. They had some fried chicken and some rice. But wait, anyway, we just got a couple of these cinnamon rolls. And then there's a copy copy. But they give you, you can buy three-in-one packets and hot water. But you know, it's very economical this way. So it's not a bad thing at all. And later on, we'll see what kind of food they offer. But look at that. Beautiful view of Garamond's right there. So if you get sick while you're on the boat, well, there you go. They have a full clinic. And look at this locker. So if you are not booking like we are, the stay room. And you have a very big room with many, many people staying in them. That's what you can do. You can get yourself a locker. Let's go say I don't see if there's any doors open in those big ones. So we can actually show you. With invading people's privacy, you know. But there you go. Those are the mega value green rooms. Yeah, there's a lot of bunks in there. But it looks like maybe 20 people, something like that. 20 people can stay in those. And they're right there. The hot water is right there. So they don't have to go very far to find it. Diapers probably. That's a good one. Hello. Hi. And so you know an interesting thing is as they said, one of the FHUs was, can you bring livestock onto the boat? And it said, no. But there is one exception. You are allowed to bring your fighting cock with you on your cruise. Not kidding. Check this out. There it is. Not making this up. So I guess they'll be kept over here somewhere in the livestock and excess baggage area. That's where they will keep your fighting cock. So the best door is right here. You can go show it off. I'll keep walking by it. Do you know, do you know, be on good? Do you know, be on good? Then you know that she likes chocolate. So they've got a mini soup store on the ship. And as you can take a tumbler, it's a damn old. It's good because they have like a lot of useful things. Oh yeah, you can sell some stuff. You can pull a headphones. And then obviously be more useful things. Oh, oh, oh. More useful, is it? I can put sushi. I can get... I put a bigger... I know that I'm like... You get a pig. Well, pig and a dinosaur costume or an alligator costume. Right up your alley right there. Or a baby, yay! This is a pig. I'm excited. Wow. He and P is going to be coming after you, girl. Alright, and I got some more over on this side too. Yeah, you do like everything. And if you need flip-ups, there are only 130 pesos. So they have you and yet they don't purge too bad. That's a good choice. And a souvenir shop. Yeah, that's right. So you can get like... Oh, yeah, see, go back a lot. And then we're back here at the front desk. And then I see that there is some stuff coming up over here. Oh, this is the truerist premium. I don't think I'll be able to show those. The obviously the big ones. You can get right in there. Oh! They do have a quick mark, but it's closed. Not sure if it's going to get open later, maybe? I don't know. Where's our eating watch? That's my thing. Okay. You got beef with me. You know, you know it's funny. I mean, people who thought they were addicted to chips? It was really beef. It was really beef. Like, you're so healthy for that. Alright, let's go over here. There's a salon over here. Oh, wait. Your favorite. I got KTV going on. See if there's any KTV. I think you probably have to go buy the key. Like, go pay them and then they'll let you in. Let's find it. Yeah, that's what happens. But hey, I can show you guys. Snake me. Yeah, they got a couple of microphones on stands there. TVs, big speakers, air conditioning. They got everything in there. Oh, that's what it used to be. I was wondering why. Yeah, why is everything in Japanese? Japanese. Yeah, we know why. Because of that, so it's an old Japanese fairy. A little lore there to go lore. I like that. Hence the KTV. Yeah, it makes so much more sense of the day. Yes, and the day. Alright, more rooms are down there. Tourist premium rooms. And we have a salon here. Hello. Hello. Can I come in for a minute? Sure. Alright, fantastic. Thank you for joining us. And so yeah, they got spa here where you can get facials, get nails. What else? I, if you want to, let me translate to doento, muscage, water gear, medic gear. Okay, fantastic. And you can see they can even wash your hair here. Wow, that's amazing. Did you imagine this on the camera? It's on the Kigou fairy. Kigou fairy. Sorry, I need to ask you. I just want to make your... And we're going to be taking off soon. But look at this. They even have an elevator here. So yes, they are equipped for people that have disabilities of any kind. I somehow get you up here. All I saw is the wheelchair down below on the main floor. So somehow they got you up. And then from here you can take the elevator access. Sounds like really wicked. In addition to what? Is that the fiesta over there? Yes, the island fiesta. You've got horizon cafe. And this one here, a little quieter in here. I like that. And seating for about, maybe 10 families, some like 12 families. And from here they have all of their milk teas and coffees. I'm not sure what's going to be in here. Is there anything in there now? Oh, the house looks derling. Look. Free meal. Free. Yes, this is free? Yes, sir. Wow. Who doesn't like free food? Hey, do you like free food? You love free food. I was just looking at their main dishes and everything. I just thought crispy fratta. I was like, what? Wait, wait, wait, crispy fratta. Chicken wings, yeah. So you can also order other things there. Can you describe what's here? This one is... This one is... This one is... Oh, wow. It's bitter gourd. It's bitter? It's bitter gourd. It's bitter gourd? It's bitter gourd? It's bitter gourd. This one is... She can be paid apple and beef curry curry. Beef curry curry? Wow, wow, wow. Yeah, she loves it. And this one was chicken... Beef brain apple. Oh, beef brain apple. Chicken brain apple. Chicken brain apple. All right, chicken brain apples. Wow, this is amazing. Thank you so much. We'll be back when we're done filming. The island Fiesta is actually quite large. So this is where you're going to get the bulk of the people. And you can see over here, they seem to have some live music. Maybe going on a night here, I don't know. I'll show you food. Hi, Benny. And it's like a cafeteria style. You go up and you order what kind of food you want. And they have seating all the way through here. But then there's also seating out this side with window view on this side. And it makes it a little quieter. It's called the extension. Oh, this is a Verizon Cafe extension. Excuse me. So actually you can sit over here and order your cafe. Oh, with the free food. And so they have set it out up here too. So if you stay in business class, they have shared restrooms. See the mail in female there. And a shower room. So you miss out on that as well as you have to rent the wedding. But you do get a dancing model girl. The sound you get walking on. Don't walk that way. That's a thing. Well, this is the final sign that they're going to be taking off soon. The doors are being lifted up, which are also obviously the platforms for the big track, the trailers, and all the cargo that's underneath here. I believe embosses are under there. The other ones are already up. Stairs are already up. This is the last one to go. And so if you want to move from one island to the other here in the Philippines, that's what you do. They bring you one of these containers to your house. You fill it up, then they come and get it. They drop it here. The next ship that's coming along, that isn't full. We'll get that container. It'll be dropped at the other side. That truck over there will then deliver it to your new residence. It's reasonable, I'm told, by other people that have moved from Manila to Borci. They experienced it. I don't think they filled a full one, by the way. They just brought a certain amount. But you can buy in different sizes, obviously. You can even buy a whole tractor trailer. You don't need just a small 20-foot container. You could go 40, what is that? 45, 46. All right, there they go. They're pulling the ropes off. Engines are started. All right, here we go. We just noticed that there's actually only in four state rooms on the whole ship. So, book early, because they might sell out. Oh, hi. All right, so when we left the, we call that the railing, watching push away. We came back in for, they announced on the PA that it's time for the free food. And wow, the light just got incredible. So, the beautiful advantage of staying in this gorgeous state room is you pick up that phone over there, and they will bring you the free food to your room. Yeah, and they'll bring you anything, really. Yeah, they'll bring you anything, but they offered right away, which of the free foods do you want. And then they're going to bring us beer with it. So, why not? That was good to me. Yeah, this is well worth the extra thousand pesos. 500 pesos per person. We did not have to rent any linen. Yeah, they come with it. That was the thing. I don't even know how much they are to rent. Yeah. And in business class, they have different types of business class. They have one with four beds. So, if you book two of them, maybe two other strangers in there, they don't get a bathroom. Then you said there was a two beds. Oh, we saw. We saw a bunk bed. There is a bunk bed, which is two beds. And I guess it's a different price. One, but yeah, yeah. It's so far I got to tell you, state room guys. Very, very nice. Yeah, this is nice. Very, very nice. Just chilling out and relaxing in here while everybody else has to line up. Very, very nice. Kind of worth the money. All right, thank you so much. Thank you so much. All right, so guess what guys? Look at that. There's the room service. Ready to go. Get your Apple beer. All right, thank you. Don't keep it. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. Thank you very much. All right, they just brought us our dinner. And this is a chicken curry. I believe this is a mushroom soup. We still have the plastic on it. We haven't opened it yet. No, this one's different from the other one. Oh, it's a different soup. Oh, it's a clear soup. Yeah, yeah. Okay. And some shrimp tempura. Yeah. And yeah, and then we have waters, but we have, of course, we ordered extra a couple things. Yeah, so this is the free meal. So this is what the portion size is. Anybody on the chicken? Yeah, everybody gets this. And so if you want extra, it's 100 pesos for an extra meal. So that's what we did. We got, we're getting another chicken curry. And we're just split in a shot. So yeah, and San Miguel light is coming. Visiting us for our stomachs. Good old Sam. I can't live without you. I can't live without you. Oh, it's a good entertainment here. Wow. Keeping everybody really, really an entertainment. Trying to go over here. All right. So when you get on the ship, obviously, get everything you need from the store before, well, dinner. Let's just say dinner to be safe because we're down here now. They have me realized everything is closed, including the convenience store. So yeah, if you need anything, get it early. And that way it's all taken care of. Well, before we went to bed, we thought we would talk about our first day experience on here because we have to get up at 6 a.m. in order to watch us approach. We really want to see that because 630 is supposed to be arrival. And then after that, we're going to go and meet up with Pauline because we had nowhere to put our bags until we could finally check in. And so Pauline's like, yeah, it's my day off. It's fantastic. So we're going to put our stuff at her house or apartment. And we're going to go have breakfast together, which will be on another video. Okay. So we showed you here what it's like to stay in a state room, which is the top level tier that's available on to go on this boat. We did notice that on other boats for much longer trips, there is a three person state room. These are maxed out at two people. And you think you could just sneak them in? Well, they do have a roll call sort of thing where they have security man every door. And they go from door to door checking to make sure everybody room has a ticket. So you can't really get away with that and probably not probably should try. Another thing we noticed is they actually have a really low cost ticket, which is for going from Yolavila to Manila, not to Patangas, but directly into Manila, was 2,390 pesos or something like just under 2,400 pesos. To give you an idea, you're probably not even going to find a flight for that. So that after you have the taxes and everything in. So that is a very, very low cost. But you don't get anything. You get the free meals, but you get a chair. You get to sit your butt in a chair, which we saw about it. And we were like, that wouldn't be that difficult. No, it's not like the longest boat ride ever. You know, it's 24, less than 24 hours. Exactly. So you can keep yourself pretty occupied here on this ship with all the shows going on. And that's karaoke. And if you're with a different company, I guess your phone. OK, we have no that out here. But if people are FaceTiming, we say, or like, stuff. Yeah, outside. They go after go outside to do it. Yeah. Yeah, if you're with Globe, you're likely in many places to get a good signal if you go inside. Or a good enough signal. We're not getting that. There is no Wi-Fi on the boats, OK? Elon Musk's Starlink is not yet over the Philippines. So I guess that's why. So there is no Wi-Fi. There is, like I said, their entertainment. They do have a television outside for everybody else. We have our own TV in the state rooms. You can watch, but there's only three or four channels, five channels, something like that. Don't expect it to entertain you. You could download some movies to your phone. Yeah, that's what I recommend. That kind of thing. And then just watch them during your trip. But yeah, you could keep yourself pretty occupied. And then just stay up all night or just kind of pass out in a chair. Totally, you can see that happening. And then go home and go to sleep if you live in Manila or Yulavilo. Then kind of makes sense, right? You're just going to arrive at 6. Get yourself back home and just pass out and have a good sleep. So I could see that being a reasonable option, especially for your stuck. And you're on a real-type budget. Look at these guys. It's like a jeepney, but it's not. Hello, guys. Look at this. Come on.
