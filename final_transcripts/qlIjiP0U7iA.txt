 Vancouver is a coastal city known for its stunning natural beauty and cultural diversity. But did you know that Vancouver also boasts Canada's second largest Filipino community with nearly 134,000 Filipinos calling at home? So my girlfriend Nicole and I decided to hit the streets of Vancouver to speak some Paralogue and to explore the Filipino markets and eateries that the city has to offer. We ran into some awesome local Filipinos, spoke tons of Paralogue and tried lots of new Filipino food. I hope you guys enjoy the video. I want to eat a dobo one. I love a flavor here. Look at this.
