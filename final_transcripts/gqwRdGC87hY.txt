 What's the deal, family? Welcome back to the realist's rastin channel on YouTube. This is Bushson. We here with another banger for y'all, Mace. Look. Filipino singers that we in viral in 2020 updated version. So this one, first time it was sent to me was a long time ago. And it was only sent one time. But then recently a couple more people started sending it to me. I was like, damn, I remember somebody requested this like when it probably when it first came out. It came out like March or something. Yeah. So it's probably around when it first came out. Somebody requested it. Never just, you know what I'm saying? I give requests that a lot of stuff. But then recently people were sending it to me. I was like, you know what? I do remember somebody sending me this. That's just do it. Well, before it's 2022, let's just make it happen. So we here Filipino singers that we in viral 2020. Man, it's a 20 minute video. So I'm a later rock. If you guys want me to do some more stuff, let me know in the comments below or the best place to send me anything is going to be Instagram. Sean W. Tyler is my Instagram send it to me over there. Because that's mainly nowadays. That's mainly where I go to from my request video. So we got something you really want me to do. That's where you want to send it, man. Let's get to this. See what these singers got, man. Oh shit. At the restaurant, just chillin'. I want to do it. But death tread that? I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose you. Just to have somebody by my side. She over here teaching math equations. Man, she need to get, she need to go, she need to get her a mic. She need to get her a mic. And start posting on YouTube or something. She over here doing math equations. Man, where the voice like that? Come on. And I don't want to hate you. I don't want to take you. But I don't want to be the one to cry. Oh, you got the vibrato. And I don't really matter to anyone anymore. But like a fool, I keep losing my place. And I keep seeing you walk through that door. But there's a danger being loved and saying that I can't do that. She's fine. And it's said when you know it's your heart, you can trust. There's a reason why people don't say where they are. Maybe sometimes you're just into us. She got a pipe, man. What? She got a pipe. I can never change you. I don't want to blame you. Baby, you don't have to take the phone. She don't even sound like she's into Philippines. She sounds like she's a Filipino that live in America or something. But I'm based on the voice. I'm probably wrong to hear. Yes, I may have heard you, but I did not deserve you. Maybe I just want to have it all. It makes us out like the thunder. It makes me feel like a rain. Yeah, she's going crazy with it. Yeah, some women are oblique with them. A marriage. No, I am just having fun with them. I have to have them fall. A couple who will never see the truth. I keep thinking somethings gonna change. But there's a danger being loved and someone too much. in a good way and I was just like, I just keep singing, babe. Just babe, just keep singing, babe. Like, what? Oh. Baby sometimes love just ain't enough. And there's no way home. OK. When it's late at night and you're alone, all the things that you want to say. Do you feel me beside? What? No, they have to carry Yokey with it. What? They're in the Philippines, oh, listen. They're in the Philippines, oh, listen. Yeah, the lead. Yes. I hope I lie. I lie, I hope I lie. What the hell? Is it a coincidence or these people with viral in 2020 or in Philippines, y'all really got singers like that. Y'all out here got wind pipes up in the Philippines, man. Is something in the water? Is there something in the water? I'm just asking. I don't know. I know there are singers everywhere in the world. But they're, I don't think I've seen a video like Mexican singers like Noah Finns, the medicine, African, Mexican, Russian. I don't really matter.
