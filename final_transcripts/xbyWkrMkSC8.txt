 They're all fashion. Wow. Eric and I, it's my love. Wow, we got an outfit. Oh, that's history. Very much a salon. Yeah. Guys, it's just here. And today, we have a very, very special guest for a video as I'm introducing very trendy Filipino food. So we have a very, very wanted only Eric. Hello. Hello. Wow. Eric, that's me. That's me. I'm Jessica. Eric. Hey. I know you have visited the Philippines a few times before, right? Yeah. So this is your, I think 5th time. It's great. I think, yeah. You look great with your baron fashion. It's very much amazing. Wow. Wow. So much. And it actually fits our theme today so much, because I'm going to be introducing you some trendy Filipino food. I know you tried the Filipino food before, right? Yes. But this restaurant is actually added some modern touch in their food, so it's kind of like trendy. It's like fusion. Yeah, kind of like, yeah. So you have some modern touch. So let's go have some food. Sorry. Let's try it. Let's try it. So we actually already chosen some meals for this shit. OK. But you can choose your own drink. So we'll get the menu. I will do a triple berry mango. We're not allergic to mango. I'm not allergic to mango. Really? I used to be. But I am now allergic to apples, pineapples, kiwis, and peaches. So it changes, right? And I'll get one peach mango. How well do you eat? How well do you eat? Pretty well, but we've been eating a lot of this trip. Yeah. Actually, there's like my top three favorite Filipino food, the sea sig, senigah, and adobo. OK. We're going to try their mix. And also, I actually wanted to ask you, so you've already tried sea sig, you already tried adobo. So what's your favorite Filipino mango once you have tried? I mean, this is kind of like a cop out of it, it's your favorite. I think it's very homy, and it feels very cozy. It's like a comfort food. And so I feel like I can have it anytime. Yeah, that's right. So that's probably why it makes you feel a lot warm inside. What about you? Yeah, that's actually adobo, as I said, adobo is my favorite. Oh, is it? Yeah. As you said, it's really comfort food. Yeah. And creates a kimchi stew game for Filipino's as well. Adobo is my favorite. I'm waiting for our food. I actually just prepared a small little section, a little game, actually. Let's do it. Guesting game because this month, August is one week up in the Philippines. One week up. One week up. One week up. One week up, which means language month. Month of language. Wow. Wow. Oh my god. OK. You're. That's like your own language. Yeah, OK. So it's a language month. I'm pretty sure you've already learned like different sorts of new phrases, right? And I just picked some that's like trendy Filipino slang. Got it. And I don't know, maybe some of it. Because you've already learned a lot of Filipino slang. OK, here's the thing. I have a horrible memory. So my fans are watching. They're like, air-turted. Learn that. There's a good chance that I have, but I am like a goldfish. I remember almost nothing. I guess the meeting. Yeah, you guess the meeting of each plan. OK, so the first one, lords. Lords? Eric now is my lords. What? Ever since. Really? Ever since I was young, you were my lords, the lords. Lord of the strings. Ah. Is it an abbreviation? No, it's not. Give me one more contact. When I was younger, I dreamed to be a K-pop star. OK. And so now, looking at Eric Nam, I really thought to myself, OK. Eric Nam, I'm going to be like him. Oh. Eric Nam is my lords. Is it like role model? Yeah. Oh, wow. And actually, it is short form for Loddy. Loddy. Which is the opposite of the word idol. I-D-O-L. So L-O-D-I. So Loddy. And we just call it like lords. Which means idol. So it's not lower to the string. Ah. So it's lords. Oh, lords. Wait, so you wanted to be a K-pop idol? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I did. Yeah, I did. Did you audition and everything? I went through a training process. I did. Then I quit. Knowing back. OK, actually, it really, just like my emotional album, that's face I mean, right? It relates to next word. Ow it. Ow it. A while ago, right? I tried becoming a K-pop star. But then it was just too tough, like the reality and everything. So I quit. Ow it. Oh, it's a shame. Yeah. Really? So it's actually a short of the word Ow and Suck It. So Ow. Need it Ow? No, no. But it's not like Ow, right? It is. And the full piece is like Ow, Ow, Ow. Suck It means painful. What are you saying? Ow. Suck It means painful. It's like Suck It's a puso. It's like, oh, my heart hurts. Suck It's a puso. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ow it. I got Suck It would be like whatever. Suck It. Like, hmm. But now it's like, oh, it's all. I like how they're all like. Oh. This one? This one? This one? This one? This song. Ow it means song. And sing. Ow. How would you say sing a song? Ow it. Ow. Ow. Ow it. Ow it. Ow it. Ow it. Ow. I have no idea what I said, but I think it means sing a song. Ow it. Ow it. Next one. We have Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Yeah. Is that right? Yes. How did you? Oh my god. You know? The pain here is a living in the Philippines. It is a language month, everybody. Yeah. Pick up your game. Let's go. Last one. It's also an easy one. SKL. It's your smart. You'll get it. So I'll give an example. You know what? Yesterday, I listened to Eric Nam's new song. Oh my god. And it was so good. Like I was just lying down in bed. And like the voice was like so good. Like literally. Like I was really idolizing him ever since I was young. So it was just an amazing thing. Like yeah. SKL. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Yeah. Is it that? Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. The color of the nail polish of my pinky is pink. SKL. Flex. It's an abbreviation of Cher-Polan. Cher-Polan. Which means I'm just sharing. Let me just share. Oh. Yeah. I'm not sure. Yeah. Yeah. TMI. Today I had three coffees. SKL. We can't just like. So those were all the no-strendy, Filipino slang. And I think what really fits you most is this one. Because he's really my Lord of the strings. Lordy. I know. For album. The cool album is not out yet, right? It's not out. It's not out yet. But one of the songs, how is it single? It is out yet. It's a new song. It goes perfectly with your voice. I think so much. And you share to us about your single that came out. Yeah. I'll sort of tell you what the first thing was about. It was more about wanting, finding happiness. And what do we value? Human nature about. No matter how many good things we have, we always want more. And then I just released a new song called Don't Be Good. And that is about. I don't know about you, but every time I go out with friends, there's always something that doesn't want to go home. There was going to be one more drink, one more bar. But I wanted to write a dance song. But do it in a way that's a little bit deeper than just like just dance. So if you really don't want to go home, you don't have to go home. Let's have one more dance. Whatever it is you're going through, just forget about it. Let's have a good time. That was the inspiration of the song. And the music video, Jot, has like, crazy, dinner party scene. Oh, I have to be absolutely incredible dancers that we shot and like a hundred minutes. So that is also out. And you're the result of your dance. I am. You'll have to watch the video to see what's going on. Oh my god, oh my god, I'm so excited. You actually watched that. Like wow, dancing every now. Well, we'll see if I'm dancer. I don't know. I'm just sad. Salt bread. Do you all Spanish? I speak Spanish. I don't know if that helps. Does it help in learning Tagalog? It does, right? It does. Find the salt. So which means salt bread. It's salty. It's hot salt. Try it. You can just grab it with your hair. Okay. It's a cooling thing. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. It's a cooling thing. It's a cooling thing. It's a cooling thing. It's bread. Usually people have it with just butter or they dip it in coffee or they have it with my lo. My lo. It's like that. Butter is a perfect mix though. But even without butter, it's bread. All the potatoes. Do you know what potatoes mean? Potatoes. Potatoes. Antis. What? He knows everything. Potatoes. Oh, this is really good. It looks like a piece of meat. So they put seasick inside. You like this type of food. Like fried. Like you know. In full pino, I learned it. It's called makasalana. Makasalana. Yeah. What is makasalana? Is that like fried food? It's sinful. Oh, I love makasalana. Yeah. It smells delicious. Yeah. Go go. It smells delicious. Yeah. Go go. It smells delicious. Yeah. Go go. It smells delicious. Yeah. Go go. It smells delicious. Yeah. So you can feel like the seasick flavor that you know of, hook in a wrap. It has a crunchiness from the wrap. It has a crunchiness from the wrap. Then you have the pork inside. Then you have the pork inside. It has a savory, aromatic. The sea sick is actually also one food in the Philippines. It's like very punchy, very salty. It's like, kind of like, you know, in Korea also, like we have. Even if it's like the same food, they have the different ways of cooking, depending on the province, right? Yeah. So this food originates from Pampanga. The original sea sick, they don't put egg and mayo. But in the Tagalog version, so in this region, they put egg and mayo. But I think this one doesn't have egg, but it has mayo. It's a mayo, yeah, yeah. So it's like regional pride. Who is the original ones? Yeah, yeah. That's the iconic thing. Well, this pretty good. Yeah, really nice. It's really good. Yeah. Now you're an ordinary sea gong. And me too. Wow. Thank you so much. Okay. So sea sick was one of my favorite rings. Yeah. This is my other favorite. Adolo. And sea gong. Sea gong. But actually, sea gong dish is actually soup. Gugunji Kimchit, kind of vibe. Oh. It's very sour soup. But they need it into a... A green tea potato. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. A special version. Yeah. But I'm pretty sure it's still going to taste like the sourness of the sea. You're going to try it. I'm down. Oh, thank you so much. So we got green beans. Sitau. Sitau. Sitau is green beans. Yeah. So. Sitau. Well, this is language mark. We're learning about vegetables and all of them. So, have you known this right? Is it okra? Yeah, okra okra. Do you like okra? I like okra. What is okra? You never tried okra? I like okra. What is okra? Oh, okra. Okra is Filipino, right? That's like a... That's kind of dish where it grows on here. You have to... You have to get used to it. It's good. It's good. It's good. I get what you mean. It's probably being sour. But it's not like a sour. It's just like, it has a little bit of a twist. Really? It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good. It's like, it has a little bit of a twist. Really? Yeah. It's really good. So, it tastes exactly like masunigam soup, but really in a dry form. The souring agent of this is tamarind. That's why, like, when I first tried this before, I thought it was soil. Oh, really? Because, like, I'm not used to, like, super sour soup, I feel like. In the Philippines, there's really a lot of sour dishes. Do people love spicy food here? People think that Filipino's pan and those spicy food, because, like, in Tagalog, I think we did not comment. But if you go to, like, different regions, like, B-co. You want the spicy chili? Yeah. They literally eat this, like, oh. They're really good. Oh, no. I would die. I can eat some, but, like, I'm not going to eat a pepper. Nope. Wow. Have you tried this? Is this coconut rice? It's... Sinangag. Sinang? Sinangag. Sinangag. Sinangag. Oh, there. So, Sinangag, or garlic rice, is my favorite. I don't think I've had it. I don't know how to speak. So, if you love garlic... I feel like garlic. This is the best for you. It almost looks like backwards. Yeah, it's like kai-bic-jim. You know, a little kai-bic-jim. Very tender kai-bic-jim. Actually, yeah, those boys really though. If I would explain it to you in Korean, I'd say like, three-pinshik kai-bic-jim. Really, the old flavors are there that we know of. But it's like, altered in a modern way. So, it's really a trendy-y-use mixture. What do you think? Five sour. How do you say masha-sa? Masha-sa-da. So, over on Masha-sa-da. You're right. Everything has kind of like a sour, little twist to it. Viko Express is actually a dish. I mentioned it a while ago. You know, the province that's famous for eating spicy food. Yeah. It's biko. Okay. So, this is biko Express. So, it's supposed to be spicy. It's spicy. Let's see. A thin area can handle biko Express spice. Oh, I smell the peppers. So, this, I would say, compared to the first three food tried. The most exotic. Yeah. So, usually, we eat it with rice. So, it's just penta. Oh. But they added pasta in here. So, they're all the thing also. Bro, that's spicy. That's good. But it's spicy. I'm gonna be okay. I'm gonna be okay. How spicy is it today? Five or six. It's not crazy. It's like enough. Ah! Ah! And then the base of this is pork and cooked. And coconut milk. The closest thing I can relate it to is a Thai coconut curry that's really spicy in pasta form with helicopters. Exactly. Oh, you're good. I mean, you have your own food show. We keep it like small, all the dishes we've tried. What was your favorite again? My favorite was it's between the adobo and the sissy. Very different, but both very good. I think the city guy was good, but if I was like, you're gonna order one thing I would take between those two. What about you? The sissy guy was also good, but then the season, it's just perfect. It's very makasalana, so it's fried and then it's fried again, but... Very makasalana. Yeah, you're good. You know it's hard, the full meal. That's makasalana. Oh, wow. Wow. What are you talking about? What are you talking about? He should like hold his dessert. Anything you'd like to talk more about your upcoming album? Well, I was supposed to bring you a signed album. I'm left. So, I'll bring one for you. We'll send one to you. But no, the album comes out September 8th. Massive album with four music videos, short film, and the most ambitious project that we've ever done. But I wanted to do it because it's like my 10th year of being a singer. I was able to collaborate with songwriters that I've worked for a long time. Some of my favorites in the album as well as some artists that I really, really love and wanted to work with for a long time. So, one of them is Dino Han, H.O. and Chor. Yeah, so we're pretty bad. Yeah, so the title song, oh really? Yeah. Really listened to him a lot. Oh yeah, the focus track for the album is called Only for a Moment. So that's with Han. It's a lot of, I think, beautiful music individuals. So hopefully y'all check it out and enjoy the videos and music. Wow. So, I hope you guys enjoy today's video. Again, check out Eric's new album and the songs that has already been released as of now. So yeah, thank you so much for watching this video. And I'll see you guys in the next one. Bye. Bye.
