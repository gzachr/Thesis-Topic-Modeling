 They do not have grab me, do my get-to. So I take a trice call. Ow. I just can't wait to get to the new place. And I can't wait to show you guys what the new crib's gonna be like. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. My bags are packed. It is time to leave, show our beach and sip a lie and head over to do my get-to. It's about 7am right now. I woke up nice and early so that I can get to do my get-to nice and early. Two. Really gonna miss this little lodge. It was really very comfortable living here. The ski don't net. Did absolute wonders. We're gonna carry this bad boy over the beach to the boat. Alright, thank you very much. Thank you very much. Good morning sir. Hello. Hello your boat. I check out. You are building a boat? No. We just prefer for the up and down for diving. A diving? Yeah, for this part. The back for the diving boat. Oh nice. Nice. Alright, good luck. Yeah. I'll take a seat. Ah, so I'm carrying this bad boy. All along the beach. I'm sure if you've seen the videos up till now, you'll know that I have to walk all the way down this beach. And I even have to go through some water so that's gonna be fun. Anyway, I'm just stopping for a moment because sugar beach is absolutely glorious at 7 a.m. in the morning. It's just beautiful. What a day. And away we go people. And away we go. We're gonna nice little bench over here. Perfectly placed. Let's take a little rest. Re-coupere, regain that energy and then keep going. Isn't it a beautiful bag? Let's take another little pit stop guys. We're almost there. Check out this really cool resort. Oh, we're almost there guys. And for those asking themselves, why are you not traveling with a big backpack? I used to always travel with a big backpack. I didn't used to take these types of suitcases on trips like these. But I really noticed that when I'm traveling with a big backpack, my back starts hurting after hours of wearing that thing on my back. So I started traveling with these. And honestly, it's always been perfect except for now because I have to go over an entire beach. I can't roll it along. But I personally prefer traveling with these because it doesn't mess your back up. Oh guys, no way. It's a lucky day. The tides are low right now. Thank the moon. I could walk right past and I didn't have to go into the water. It's my lucky day. Hi, yeah, we're at the boat. We're gonna survive. We're gonna survive just well. Good morning. Who's crossing? Yeah, okay. Thanks. Nice job. We made a bag. The hardest part of the journey is over. Now it's just a chill bus ride and a tricycle ride before that. These kids are going to school. These kids have to cross like every day to go to school. Look at that. I found one perfect little bag stand right there. I still have to walk this all the way from the boat. I'll check out this view guys. Sugar Beach man. It really is very nice. I love these like hilly mountains out of the sea. You see them all over the place here in Sipa-lie. Really beautiful. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm back on the tricycle with my friend over here. Oh guys, the hardest part of the journey is complete now. Now I can just sit back and relax. We're filling the truck up nicely. More and more passengers. This is gonna be a party. No, not a single band. This one? No, you're right with the band. It's much better your ride than the band. Thank you. All right ladies and gentlemen, so this is the plan. Right now we are here. And we're not gonna listen to what this is. We're gonna listen to the song. We're gonna go to Pinobat on right there. And then from there, we're gonna take the bus all the way like that. Straight here to do my get the date. That's where the party's happening tonight. Get the sand out of my shoe. I'm gonna go to the beach. I'm gonna go to the beach. I'm gonna go to the beach. I'm gonna go to the beach. Get the sand out of my shoes. How much is the rice?

As you saw these two cute little kids. Loving the vibes here. Such a cool bus ride straight along the coastline. We've just stopped at this bus station over here. We just passed the border from Nagros Occidental to Nagros Oriental. Because the whole island of Nagros is actually divided into two different provinces. And we're now in Nagros Oriental. Capital City. You might get that baby. The bus is slowly filling up again with more people. More of the merrier. These are my neighbors. Thank you. And I got my take it. That's important. Oh yeah, it's a full bus. It's a very, very full bus. This is a longer any guys. I got the first bus at 8.30. It's 12.30 now. Been on the road for four hours. My ass is turning into wood. Looking very much forward to arriving to my dad's end. Oh, it was red. I'm making a little pit stop here at this bus terminal. And there are a lot of people selling stuff here. And a lot of people are getting refreshments. I should probably do that too, but I'm too tired. I'm going to get a bus stop. I'm going to get a bus stop. I'm going to get a bus stop. I'm going to get a bus stop. We're driving into Duma Getter right now. It's been a very, very long journey. It's two o'clock. Left at 8.30. But we're finally here. And it looks really nice. We're here. We're here. We're here. We're here. We're here. We're here. We're here. We're finally here. Oh, that was a five and a half hour journey. It feels so good to walk again, guys.
