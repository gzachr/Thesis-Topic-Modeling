 What's up guys, my name is Miles. My name is Fez. And this is the commodity. And today we're reacting to first time trying Sipak, Takra, and Badminton, most popular sports in Malaysia, Kelantan Travel Vlog. This video was requested by a few people. We see back in July, cheap, cheap suggested this video. Back in August, Linda suggested this video. And a few days ago, TTVVTT requested this video. So thank you so much for these suggestions, all three of you. Sorry, Linda, and cheap cheap that we're just now getting to you. But we got there. Yep, for sure. So I enjoyed watching the Sipak Takra videos that we've watched before. Learning about the sport and everything. It's an insane sport, like super insane. Yeah, I feel like I would rip my growing every time. The amongst other muscles and ligaments and stuff. Yeah, I would definitely need to stretch more before starting this. Stretch. Yeah, it's the least of your worries. We'll lose a little more weight soon. It's been a lot of things. Guys, before we open this video, if you would, go ahead and give us a thumbs up.

You know, I was kind of, I'm thinking like, what makes, like, why do some countries soccer become the most popular sport in this situation? What do we do? It's so blue. What was that? I don't know. Badminton CPAC Tecraw. Tecraw. Sipac Tecraw. Sipac Tecraw. What makes a Sipac Tecraw anyway? You're stupid. You're so dumb. Why is the Sipac Tecraw? But like in the US baseball and basketball and football. I mean, a lower extent, or lesser extent hockey and soccer sometimes. I'm depending on who you talk to. Yeah. What do you ask? Dude, that's not even like soft ground. No. Bro, that's so amazing. Lauren, could you imagine just skinning your knee on it? Come on. Check this out. Sipac Tecraw. Essentially, it's kick volleyball. Sipac Tecraw. I guess it only is really popular in Southeast Asia. I think it's one of the most popular sports in Malaysia. These guys here make it look easy. And it's like acrobatics high flying gym nap. So do you remember these guys? Yeah. So they're the ones that did that tour at that resort slash museum thing that we, that they said it was like $100 a night or something like that. Yeah. We completely missed out. Yeah. Astics, check this out. This dude already looks like he's got a bandage over a skinned up knee. Yeah, I could imagine the injuries in this sport. That was gonna go out. You gotta let it ride, bro. The talent. So these guys are nice enough to invite me to play, feeling very lucky. No experience, obviously. I've never been seeing the game before. I'm excited to see this. This is gonna be so good. We should play it when we go. Oh yeah, 100%. We look so dumb. At least we won't be as fat. Notice he says as fat will still be fat. Yeah. No doubt about it. Did you get a point? Yeah. That's so awesome. It's just happy. Yeah, it's like letting a child throw a ball to you. But they're more supportive because they're right. Right, right. Because when you got kids, as much as I love my kids and stuff, when I'm throwing the football with a friend or something like that, my kids are there and they're like, let me throw it. Let me throw it. I'm like fine, fine. But when you're teaching an adult something new, that they kind of generally know how to understand what's going on. Right. And they can learn and, like this seems like a hard pick up. Like he's gonna be able to kick the ball. Easy concept. Just very, very hard execution. Yeah. Like very hard. Awesome guy. And then you've got to think about how small that ball is. Right. So much. Ooh. He's enjoying it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I did. I did. Hey. He's catching on a little bit. Oh. That is awesome. He is actually doing what? Way better than I thought. Look at that. He's earning the respect. I hate staying in too. He probably kept it in. That's awesome. That is awesome. I'm so impressed. I don't know. I'm not teaming lost. Whoa. I'm not gonna get small divin. I got like three points. Our team got like three points. Oh, was it hard? Yeah, I get to learn the basics of how to kick above your head. I only have one week, which is right for the off. These guys are going left foot, flipping over, landing on the ground. Oh, you, you. That's crazy. They're broken up. The ball is made of wood. Everything about this board is amazing. But I'm not kind of for it. I think I should stick to Badminton. We tried Badminton first time, pedisical. Although I was not very good at it, at least I could play. He looks like a bad man. I'm not. We were hurt. It looks like a professional tennis player. Yeah, exactly. That's what I'm saying. It is little socks going to the court. The one that was serving from the league. All in this bad man. Olympic Bradman. Hey, he drilled it. No, no. I was even thinking to myself, oh, this is going to be way easier. Ladies like, I think you've seen her on a video before. I don't think so. You don't think so? Get her out around. She's not giving him any slack though. Ran, yeah. 20.8 in twice more points. OK, introducing two 50 plus Badminton players who have not played in a couple years, but played twice a week before that. And this is the first time. I've already covered his foot. Let's see what we can do. So he hasn't played in a couple of years, he said? No, they haven't. Oh, but they used to play a lot. Do I feel like my hand-eye coordination is shot? Yeah. And I could not do this. It was in. In. Oh. What's crazy is like the Badminton, uh, bads, they're so light. The, uh, the brackets, yeah, they're so light that, or at least the ones that I've used are super light. So it's like you, you can't really, unless you're used to playing it. You can't really control your swing when you first learning. Hey. They're giving them every serve. Uh-huh. Oh, no, they get a serve now. Oh, I think it's after five. Five, yeah. Same as tennis or volleyball for that matter. No, volleyball's threes, I think. Hey, they got a point. It's getting real. And that's another thing that's weird about this is like, it's like, well, like the harder you hit it, it's like it catches the wind. Yeah. And it goes slower. Are you okay? Badminton injury. Badminton. Who says what on the bracket? Badminton. Who says badminton is not rap? Look at that. Sports. Oh, that's from diving at the ground. They've got awesome personalities. Yes, they do. You know, the backhand and how to place it, but in the second match, we lost that more. Badminton, not for me. Maybe they put a bunch of water here. It's a Pock to Crab, not for me. He's on badminton. Nice. Maybe I could do that. It's like going to not. I can hit it. I can hit it pretty good, but I just hit it right to the middle. The skill is to hit it at the corner at another corner, and other corner, I've been short and over. I just hit it right back. So, anyway, I'm about to play some football. Yeah. Feeder about to catch on fire. But yeah, this one here, I'm not even competitive. These words are amazingly good. Amazing. These are just some guys. There's like a flashback. I think you need to be flexible, Steve. You're like flexible. And it's like the guy doing full splits. Yeah, they can do full splits for sure. Your leg is up here all the time. It's like acrobatics. It's like gymnastics. And amazing. These are just some guys like in a village. To me, looks like professionals, right? Yeah. Yeah. No joke from what I've seen on TV of this sport. It's amazing. You need to do more stretches on your leg. See, it's all you got to do is stretch. And then you're becoming an Olympic gymnast. It's crazy. So maybe I'll wait around and try to play another game. I'd like to get a ball over here in the grass and practice a little bit. They don't let them play again. And the spike is the coolest thing. Like I'm not going to do one cool spike where you actually, you jump up so high, you kick the ball downwards. All right. It seems to be a lot of fun. I can't even, it's not even feasible. I'm five foot seven. That doesn't exist for me unless I can do a backflip. Well, most of them are short. That's what I'm saying. Unless I can do a backflip, like those guys can do what I like. What I was about to say is it's not even feasible in my head to be able to make that kick. No, I'm what you I could. I like I can't even think about myself doing that. I'm a ham trip or my growing to rip. Yeah. I'm just thinking of kick like when I'm trying to think of doing it right. I'm imagining myself bending my knee with my leg going up like that. Like he's doing it. It was actually coming up and going. At the last second, they actually kick it. I'm just putting my leg in the air. I played a quick lesson. I think it is. Maybe I'll have to do it. Yeah. You don't know what I'm referring to. No. T-t-t-t-t. Oh. The shirt that you sent me. Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Inside the foot. Inside the foot. Inside the foot. Yeah. Step one here. Okay, learning. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Okay. Ah, that's good. Ah. One. Two. One. Two. One. These guys. Foot coordination is insane. Yep. Oh. Am I the first white guy here to play? Oh, wow. Oh, no. Oh, no. Am I the first white guy? First messily. First messily here. First ever messily. In history. Ever. Is that kind of the second hit, though? When it hits your stomach. I don't think so. Wow, that was awesome. I'm telling you, like these guys, like, they don't put a lot of force into it. It's just like they catch it with their foot and just lift it back up something. Wow, that was a pretty good rally. That was like 20 kicks in the rally. I think next game I can play, Loubert. Wow. Okay. I always got you at the point to me. I'm like, are you sure you want me? I'm the first one. You want me? Okay. Thank you. This is so entertaining. Like, I am so happy for him to be like. Okay. This guy is ready. Oh. Okay. Look. And this kid looks young. I think that's a kid. Yeah. Oh, yeah. That's definitely a kid. Yeah. Oh, he even went with the hate. Yeah. I'm just trying to stop it from going out. Ooh. Look at how much he's sweating. He is sweating profusely. Okay. Quick intermission for prayer. Which I could use. I'm about to have a heart attack, I think. Oh. It's nothing like hockey. You want to? I can play hockey really well. And these guys are probably not even sweating. Yeah. Or like some sort of. Well, you got to think of the temperature too. Yeah. And he's into hockey. That means that he's probably from nowhere near weather like that. Wow. He might be Canadian. He's too nice. Yeah. Yeah. So between Badminton and Sepak Taprull. I would say Sepak Taprull is way more exhilarating and way more fun. I do like Badminton though because that's a sport you can play with your 60. It's not going to hurt you. This sport is for young people. I mean, let's be honest. This is for super athletes who can do back flips like gymnast. Yeah. I wonder how old is the oldest Sepak Taprull player. I'm sure somewhere in Malaysia there's a 50 year old guy doing flips. And that will be cool to see. Yeah. I know where all over South East Asia, but I think it was in front of the Malaysia. Actually, one of the first recorded games was in Malacca. Oh, really? Yeah. Amazing story on Wikipedia about 15th century, I think. Like, 1400s. I knew it was an old video from the videos we've seen. Or an old sport. Yeah. I think it originated in the videos we've seen. Yeah. In the same way that ice hockey is a Canadian game, we invented it. And that's what I played about four years old. He's Canadian. That's why they're 10 years old on back flips. Yeah. So two. Kind of amazing. Most popular sports in Malaysia, Sepak Taprull and Badminton. You covered it all. And also football. Oh, football. Football. Football. There you have it. The trifecta. In terms of what's more fun, Sepak Taprull is exhilarating tons of fun for about 20 minutes until I'm happy. It is also super fun to watch. Yes. It's super. It's super entertaining to watch. It's amazing to watch. And people are doing back flips in other guys blocking with his foot. It's like volleyball. Sepak Taprull is like volleyball. It makes with football. It makes with acrobatics. Yeah. It makes with yoga. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly right. Wow. I say we get Sepak Taprull in the Olympics. Woohoo! I agree. That would be a wee down the wall. Yeah. Well, we're going to see Canada. I'm talking about Africa. But I want to see like three on three. Not like five on five. Right. Okay. There you have it guys. Thanks for watching. Time for me to go have a shower. Who's this? There you go. We can end on that right? Yeah. Okay. Life style. There he is. I'm stuck inside. I don't even think it's like on a leash or anything. It's just chilling with its owner. That's awesome. Yeah. That was really cool. Yeah. Jetlag Warriors. Definitely if you're not. I think he even commented on our last video. I can't remember. But if you guys are not already subscribed to them. Do so. Subscribe. They stay. They are entertained. This is only the second video I've seen of theirs. Like I see here in Lime. Like I watch every video. I've seen a few of their videos. Especially they've got some food videos that I've watched. Really? That I enjoy. Yeah. We need to get into that. Man, that's the downfall about dieting. You can't be as like, go get food to like. To be fair before we started our diets. We hadn't done a food video in a long time. Yeah. So that's not an excuse for any more than anything. And we haven't done a Malaysian food video in ages. In forever. It's a long drive to go pick that up too. Yeah it is. So. And a complete opposite direction from where we drive to work or anything. It's not like it's up. Yeah. I'll just stop by on the way over there. Doesn't really work that way. Guys, if you enjoyed this video, go subscribe to them. But if you enjoy watching it with us. Through us.
