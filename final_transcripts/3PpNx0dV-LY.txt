Last time maybe I know Vembir. I'm going to disco with my friend, drinking this one. Okay. So first drink there and... Boulevard. Yeah. Drinking hard. Oh you want this? He's talking about the hot liquor? Yeah. You drink hard and then go to... Rambar. Rambar. You cool down? Yeah. Drink this one. This one. Okay so now we're drinking the Sen Mig light. Oh. This is very easy. Yeah. It's very smooth. It's not like a cider but it still tastes like beer. But I still prefer this one. Yeah it's better. The excess one. Yeah. Yeah. Okay so my favorite is first I like red was the most. This one is second and I didn't like this one so much. It has a very funny aftertaste so that's it. You agree? Same order. One, two, three. Yeah. Yeah. Okay let's move on to the hot liquor. Okay which one is your favorite? This one? Yes. Okay so let's drink this one last and then second. This one? Yeah. So we first gonna do it Tandoay. So I heard this is basically gasoline. You know like what you would throw in the scooter? Yes. If you throw this in the scooter it will run? Yes. It will run? No. Did you notice they don't say a percentage of alcohol on this? It's like no percentage. I should move this. It's like no percentage of alcohol so you don't know how strong this one is. Also this one. There is no percentage of alcohol. Yeah I'm not. Huh? How much? 80% 80% This one is 80% alcohol. I bet you this is not. 80% Is it what is proof? Yeah, proof. 80% proof. Is proof percent? Yeah. Okay so I don't know because I don't know proof. Proff is the alcohol. So it's 80% alcohol. Yeah. That's a lot. Not this. It's the good taste. Yeah. And this one? This one is your drink base. It's not good. Okay. Okay we're going to start with this one first. What should we mix with this? Um... Sprite? Sprite. Yes. Okay I'm going to go get the Sprite. Take it. You get? Okay thanks. And second later. Okay you got the Sprite. You're going to open this with your mouth? No. So now we go tan the why? Mix with Sprite. This is what it looks like. It smells just like gasoline. Are you sure this is not gasoline? No gasoline. It looks just like gasoline. That's a taste caramel. Caramel? Yeah. Okay let's try it. So... It tastes like caramel. Right? It's sweet. It's very very sweet. Yeah. Because we have this Sprite. Yeah the Sprite is probably making it sweet. Okay so this one I paid 45 pesos for. And it is 80% alcohol. So I think that's a bargain. 45 pesos for bottle of 80%. I think that's dangerously... Yeah that's dangerous. You drink one bottle? One bottle? Yeah. You're asleep. We're going to sleep good off to this? Yeah we can sleep good. So did you see the video I made about this one with the egg, the sugar and the tan the why? Did you see that one? Yeah. It is a challenge they do inside Africa. So you have like glasses like this. You put one with egg, one with sugar, one with either brandy, general... This is the only one I could find because it was alcohol ban. Yeah, alcohol ban. So then I drank it. But if you drink the sugar, the sugar takes the alcohol quickly to your blood stream. So you get drunk like that. You put the sun rocks. What? You drink the sun rocks? No, half this one. Yeah. And then half the sun rocks. Yeah. Is that like a mix for the earthworm? What did you drink? I get the sun rocks. What is that? Pour alcohol. Yeah. Wash. Oh, for COVID. Yeah. Okay. Oh it's like... Can you get the bottle? Oh it's bleach. So you mix this with bleach and then you get an enzyme. Okay. Because it's as strong with alcohol. Yeah. I don't know the cat drink that. I got this one video. I should show it to the people. And then... Huh? Is this one? Yeah, this one. Give me the chicken. Give me the chicken. Never mind. Never mind. I'm just coming in. Okay, so we are done with the tandoi now. I think I'm already feeling it after the itype. My head is already running. It's like, you're fucking itype sin. Which one are we gonna do next? The bread? What do we mix with them? This one's water. This water? Yeah. It's good with water. How many percent is this? 55 percent. Yeah. 55. This one is 55 percent. And we're gonna mix it with water? Yeah, just only... This one? Small? Small? Of? Half? Yeah. What? Not enough. This one has a nice... You don't throw it too much. Tandoi, then, okay. You can just throw too much tandoi. It's mine? Is yours? Yes. And then... I drink and then... We take a shot? Yeah. Oh! Is this how you normally drink it? Yes. You take a shot of... of brandy... And then you chase it with the water. You see, luckily I have a local to teach me. Oh, it's more water. That's little bit. Oh, you say... I don't see you take so much. I can give you more water. We're gonna take another one? It's up to you. Yeah, I'll take another one. That was too quick. Okay, so this one was 150... But you mixed this with lime, right? Yeah, the lime. We should mix it with the lime. Should we mix? Okay. Yes, you will. Yeah, okay, okay. So I paid 150 pesos for that. And it already tastes better than the tandoi. I mean, the gasoline. Maldon is just going to get the lime. But what are we gonna do with the lime? This is open this one. Okay, you take that out. What was this? Bubble. Okay, and then? Open this one? Yeah. This is the lime that's included with the brandy. Hmm. See? Yeah, I see. It's moving. It's actually moving. Yes. Wow, that's so this mixes with that. So you can drink from this bottle of that bottle? Yeah. This is same, same same? Yes. Wow. Along this it takes to mix. Five minutes or six. It's still moving. Yeah, it's probably. This is interesting. I'm going to market. Oh, by the peanut peanut. Yeah, good for drinking. And then? Okay. Five minutes later. Yeah, pretend. What's peanuts? Peanut. And then? Nova. Oh. This one is this one. That one there. A water? Yes. Okay, so this is the brandy and the lime. Yes. Strong. Too hard. That's fun. Too. Why are you giggling? Because my head is too more drinks than we switch off the new tea. And you can go to sleep. You can drink. It's a matter. Okay, so far this brandy with the lime. I think was my favorite. I didn't really like taking a shot with pure brandy and water as much as I liked with the lime. I think this is really good with the lime. And then, so far, second is standard wide because we haven't got the gin yet. We're going to take water first. Yeah. Oh, we're going to take it in this. Okay. Clean? Yeah. We're water? Yes. Okay, so we're taking the gin now. This costs 65 pesos. And then we're going to mix it with... We're not going to make it. We're going to take a shot of this. And then we're going to just drink water. Yes. That's right. Okay, so here it goes. Good? Good? Yeah. It's good, Jen. Okay, so what would you say? What is your favorite between these? This one. Favorite second? And... I like this. Yeah. But one, two, three. Yes. I would say this. Oh, me. I like this one. Yeah. And I don't like this one. Then like, um, turn it to a gasoline. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. That's what gasoline is. It's like, it's the same type of gasoline. This is gasoline, this one. Anyway, that's the end of this video.
