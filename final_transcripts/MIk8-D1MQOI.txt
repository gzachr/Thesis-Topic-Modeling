 The Philippines, home is some of the most beautiful islands in the world. And some of the most amazing food and culture you'll ever experience. It's also home to the most friendly, humble, Filipino people that live day by day with smile on their faces, regardless of the challenges they may face. As a Filipino American, they grew up in the USA. I wanted to humble myself and experience what life is like living like a Filipino in poverty. The goal is one month living in the Philippines province on a 200-pacel with day budget, which is $4 USD. I must live like a Filipino in experience every day just like my ancestors who still live and still living to this day. So join me on this new journey of becoming a true Filipino, Paramount. Welcome back guys, the day 17 of living in the Philippines. Today guys, we're doing a simple life, living a simple life in the Philippines province. So I'm going to take you guys around just a simple day, simple life. You know, we got rock star with us. We're going to start this vlog out with actually doing a tick inspection just real quick. I just want to make sure he has no ticks because we found a tick on his head the other day. So you got to make sure he doesn't have any hidden ticks. So they're usually hidden in like ears and stuff. And then pause. Yeah, pause. So let's just make sure he doesn't have any. I already checked him, but I just want to double check real quick. But besides that, rock star has been good. He hasn't been causing no trouble. Only bad part about having a puppy is you can't sleep because they're always barking and crying. But we'll get used to it. But now, what are you feeling today? What do you want to eat? I'm feeling like I want to make some mongo beans. The green beans. Yes, it's a soup. Yes. So I've never tried mongo beans, but I've heard about it from Jokoi. You know Jokoi, the comedian. No. He talked about mongo and his comedian. Well, not you will be able to eat it. Yeah. So let's go try some mongo. But before that, guys, we did some laundry. This is the Filipino style laundry. You just really hang it up and then air dry. You just wash it. We got some clips of us washing the laundry. But yeah, so this is a simple day in a life of living in the Philippines province. Now let's go buy some mongo. Can we bring rock star or...? Yeah, you carry him. I'll do the vlog. Alright, sweet. You're good at it. You're really stressed. You're really good at it. You're good at it. Cheek Chorong. Oh, here it goes. It's very different. It's very different. It's very different. It's not mongo.

Are you sure? I think it's not enough. But when you boil this, it's a rumor that you might get it. It's a lot. But this? I've never had it, but it looks like just regular beans. Green beans. Do you want some meatloaf? Yeah, yeah, let's try that. I've never tried that. Meatloaf goes with the mongo, right? Or do you just eat it plain now? No. You eat it plain. Oh, that's not part of the dish. What do they all have? That's fake, fake money. Fake money? Yeah. We're gonna get some ice cream. This one. For the pesos. Okay, let's try. Meatloaf. I think it's not like American meatloaf. It's kind of like spam or something. Spam, no? Yeah, no. It's like Filipino bread. But it's like spam, basically, right? Yeah. Okay, we can try that. It's like basically different than spam. It's probably way better. Yeah. Okay. That's all you need? Yes. Thank you. So we got everything? We're all good. To cook.

Yeah, the baby bugs aren't supporting poison. I've never seen that type. So you put this in the mango? The leaf is spicy. Yeah, it's not really spicy, but it adds to the flavor. So you're going to use some chili, too? Yeah, if you want it to make spicy, we're going to leave it. I'm not sure. I've never seen this, bro. You're shocking me so much right now. You never asked. You never said you had a chili leaves. You didn't know you had all these vegetables in your... Whoa. I didn't even know, too. It just grew up on itself. Yeah, it just grew on itself.

You got to wash all that? Yeah. All right. All right. Oh, this is the mango. It's done. Yeah. I just felt the smell. Hmm. It smells like nothing. I thought it was going to smell like strong or something. I might have to sneak a cheater on the man. No, we're using that. I'm hungry now. It's a little cheater on. Hmm. Whoa. A little stale, nah? Oh, better. Mm-hmm. It's so good, though. It's still got a boaco from yesterday. What's you going to do with that? I don't know. So much work. Oh. So stale. Stop eating that. We're going to use that to the mango. Careful with your teeth, huh? Just spit it out. Hmm. I'm going to crack a tooth, huh? It's so hard to work. That was stale, bro. Hmm. I just have to wash this. All right. We're going to season it. How do you season it? Just throw this Cuban? Yeah. Throw the Cuban. Can I throw it in now? Yeah. All right. Here it goes. Here we go. We are. Enter the pool. I can't. I need help. Hmm. It smells good. Should I be eating the bro? Oh. It tastes like nasty. So salt the taste. To salt you don't make it too salty because you got the Cheecharone still. Yeah. Just boil it a bit. Do you boil the Cheecharone, man? Yeah. Cheers. Actually, let's add the Cheecharone. Nice Cheecharone. It doesn't matter if it's hard, right? Because it's going to boil. Yeah. It's going to make it soft. Since we don't have a fork or a spoon, we're adding this. Hmm. It doesn't know how to learn how to do this. But we got the meat. Where's the meat? The meat. The meatloaf. Oh, the meatloaf? Yeah, it's here. You can't add that in here. What you got to say for them, huh? I don't know. What should I say? I'll see you when we try the food. Oh, you guys. Hey! I heard you guys see when we were done with the food. And I'm just going to put everything in the plate. Cheers. Stop it. Wow. Wow. So, guys, dinner is served. So you can see here's the mongo. Got the mongo. What else we got now? We got some rice. I don't think you can see the rice, but it's just what? This thing can see a little bit. It's okay. And then we got the beef loaf. Meatloaf? Meatloaf. With egg. So this looks amazing, huh? You did your thing. This is good, so nice. I'm so hungry. It's been such a long night because the rocks are kept waking everyone up. Yes. But I slept good last night. You slept good. I was taking care of them. Actually, I woke up at 2 a.m. I don't know why. For real? I was sleeping? Yeah. Oh, you changed the laptop? You changed the thing on the laptop, didn't you? What do you mean? Oh, yeah, because it was playing a different video. Oh, let's get some rice. Oh, my gosh. I just ate the rice. It's not praying for us. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry, God. Let me do it for you. Because I was so hungry I've been cooking. It's okay. Hey, we got a kitten friend. I'm so hungry. I'm so sweaty. It's fine, though. They're just admiring. Alright. This is not just eat guys. We still have a lot of mungo outside. There's a lot left. We'll probably give it to the cats, the dogs, and the frogs. Frogs? I realize that's a lot. I'm not sure if I'm going to eat this. I'm not sure if I'm going to eat this. I'm not sure if I'm going to eat this. I'm not sure if I'm going to eat this. Alright, let's go for it. You started now. Why me? Exhausted. You're exhausted. I did everything. I need God's energy. God, Lord God, we thank you today for today's dinner. And we are praying for our pets, Nani Mosque, to be healthy again. Lord God, please bless them. And for our viewers, just well, please bless their life. And I pray that the viewers who are watching our videos will have a personal relationship with you, Jesus. We thank you so much for everything you have done for us, for all the blessings we have received. And Jesus, name my praying. Amen. So now, let's try this famous mungo. Can you do it? Can you put someone or should I do it? I don't know if I'm going to do it right. Can you put your anohari so hard? It's hot. It's hot, obviously. Whoa. It's too hot. No, you shouldn't just do it with the spoon. Oh, oh, oh. You could have literally just did this, bro. But you're going to spill it. You just spilled. Alright, whatever. So first impressions of mungo. I'm smelling it and it's got a lot of flavor. When I smelled it at first, it had no flavor. And now it's smelling like you did your thing, huh? Mind you that mungo is supposed to be soupy, but he doesn't like soup. So I made it sacred. I don't want it. I don't even want it. This soupy. I really want it. This is not even soupy at all. I really wanted it just straight bean. Let's try it good, but I'm going to blow on it because it's very hot now. You do your rating first. This is your cooking. Spacey or hot? Hot! Can you put the fan? It just burned my tongue. Up. It doesn't go up, huh? It does go up. Oh my gosh. Just burned my tongue. There you go. You're done, nah. You're done. The rice is hot. The mungo is hot. Everything is hot. And oh my gosh. Alright, there's impressions of mungo. This cheer is not. Then you got a good bite. You got some cheater on. Yeah, that's not true. Do you have them to turn? Mm-hmm. Alright. You have the blowing. It's the one. Whoa. That is so good, huh? I'll be honest, um, it's got a lot of flavor. It's very good. Let's rate that right away. That's a solid 8.5. But I will say, if you wouldn't made it any superior, I think I would give that like a 6. Because right now, it could be better. It could be better just because it's a little too soupy for me, but the flavor is amazing. What? It's not even soupy. Are you like blind? But nah, this is really good. It's always good. You never made me this. I never made this because it's so hard to cook. It takes a long time to make the mungo being so too boiled and then make it soft. Wow. Let's try this meatloaf. I never tried this meatloaf. Actually, this is my first time eating this meatloaf. I never really ate meatloaf. I just ate the, it's fun. It's good. It's good, but it's got a weird taste. It tastes. Yum. Mmm. It's like, oh. Nah, I say this every time. I'm supposed to make it more saltier. Mmm. It's perfect. Perfect. I think I need more salt. Nah. I literally say this every time you cook. I think this is the best meal you make. Yeah, right. Just eating it like constantly, it gets better. Because now I'm getting more flavor. I'm giving the teacher-own flavor. The vegetable is healthy. Mmm. Wow. Mmm. The, really taste like spicy. No. Nah. I really don't taste some spicy. I think it's perfect how it is. I think I taste spicy. Mmm. Let's go, guys. Let's show them a close-up of the mango. That is the mango. Mango. Mango, please. Mmm. Actually, I just tried that tomato. Mmm. You should up the dose of the tomato in the onion. It's a baby. Mmm. Mama's. Mama's. La bus. La bus, Mama's. La bus. Mama's go. Rockstar come here. She's not gonna hurt him. It's just- She's scaring him. Yeah, scaring him. Mmm. No. We're talking about that tomato. Yeah, you need up the tomato. Do me. Because I just tasted it with the tomato. And I want that flavor again. But we don't have enough. I should've put a lot of tomatoes. Yeah. But it's okay. Next time. You know I don't like tomatoes. Mmm. Let's try it straight up. No rice. It's gonna be more tastier. Yeah. You got the chicharind here. No rice this time, guys. Straight mungo. Oh, sure. I made a mess. This is hot. Hot. Hot. Hot. Mmm. Hot. Whoa. It's so crazy because the chicharron returns into meat. Mmm. That's why. I'm chasing meat now. I know. That's crazy. I actually forgot to say. Aside from chicharron, you can also put shrimp or pork. And then this little fish is called delis. You have to fry those and then you add that to the meat. I'm trying to make it a little more delicious. I'm trying to make it a little more delicious. I'm trying to make it a little more delicious. I'm trying to make it a little more delicious. It's delicious and then you add that to the mungo. To be honest, though, I don't know if I like that flavor. It's a thing you'll overpower it. Oh, that's so I like it. It's like a dried fish, but it's like sorpresino. I really like how it is. Yeah. My favorite one is the... What I call this, the chicharron. Mmm. I think it needs chicken or something. Chicken. Yeah. You never put chicken in this. chicken chicken with soup oh here here go that cheeseroan looks like meat we still got more right yeah we still have like a almost full of fats in there wow I'm gonna definitely eat that I thought you wouldn't like this this is so good and this was less than two dollars it was so crazy I told you the two bags of mangoes are already alive boy we're actually out of the bus we're bus drivers are next time I want some mango rock star does it eat me yeah you did that is a day living a simple lifestyle in the province good food good people good animals good energy and just cheap cheap living can't we can't get all many better than that so this day it's gonna be a 10 out of 10 for me last bite for me and we're gonna be out of here guys don't produce it don't eat sir i'm not
