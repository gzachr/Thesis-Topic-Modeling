 You and you are conniving. Now I know why you sent Kumar with me. This was meant to be just another journey back to Mindanao. This guy had other ideas. You know why it's raining today sir? Why? Because you washed the car yesterday. Maybe that wasn't logic. All good things have to come to an end. Today we're leaving East and Samar. East and Samar is an excellent, excellent province. Really enjoyed it. Northern Samar too. Actually the whole island of Samar. Whole island of Samar is awesome. I'm going to come back to this right at the end here. I'm going to come back to all of it in the future because just the insight I've got. I love it. I love these kinds of places. But now we're going to head back by a tackle band all the way down to the south tip of Pannata Island. The southern end of the late island. It's got out of here. Sir? It's got a sir. I see a little emo doctor. Baby not emo. That's an emo. I don't do emo. Sir does emo. Sir. He loves that emo. If I try to be emo it just turns that off on my satellite myself. This is the best way. You're so rude. You're so rude sir. Wow. We're real. What? The best reveal. The best reveal. Whoa. So we left the end of the world behind. For Broulade. For Broulade sir. For Broulade sir. For Blood is like for Filipinos sir. For Blood is like for Filipinos sir. You forgot to unlock the door. I need any. I need a few. 400. 400. Can you? Yes. I need a few. Can you? We're placing the smell of Chuba with Broulade. Broulade. It's Broulade, right? That's a heroic one man. That's fair. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This guy is my hero. I wanted to pause at one time on the way to Tacloban. Somewhere very historically significant. I was passing through Balangiega on the way. And I really wanted to stop here because this place has such big historical significance. So these are the Balangiega bells which were finally returned in 2018. After more than 100 years overseas. So on September 28, 1901 it was towards the end of the Philippine-American War. And the Americans mostly, especially given a general taft, I was going to do the explanation inside there but then a new battle broke out. So I think over pop plants or something like that. Something very important. The Balangiega bells were taken as war spoils. September 28, 1901. It was really towards the end stages of the Philippine-American War. And the Americans thought, oh, there's not so much resistance left. Stations in this town in Balangiega was one unit. And this guy, Captain of Manadur, and then a commander of the Philippine Republican Army called Eugenio Daza, decided to attack this regiment one day and they killed 54 of them. And wounded 18 more. None of them escaped. But in response, General Jacob Smith, who was in charge of this area, went crazy. He raised this time to the ground and then he said he told his troops, make Samar a howling wilderness. Every man childed over the age of 10 who was capable of bearing arms shot on sight. And many, many other atrocities that was in discriminative. And he got caught marshals for it in the next year because the American forces back over in the States realized that this wasn't good and this was actually against their own orders. He was caught marshals and forced to retire. A horrible piece of Philippine history, but the bells were returned in 2018. Balangiega today is a town like any other, but the past is not forgotten. This mobile sits right in the centre of time. At this point, Kumar was trying to slow us down. I was enjoying the scenery. The White here. Right now. Right now. Right now. We're in western Samar or sometimes known as just Samar province. And Samar province is one of the three provinces on Samar Island. There's Samar, Eastern Samar and Northern Samar. We've done all three of them now and this landscape is majestic. Wimestone casts are on the ocean. Beautiful, beautiful place. This is very much. Wow! A few months ago, first time back in late 8 or 6 years, I crossed over this bridge, stood in Samar and said I'm going to explore this island more in the future. And I've done that. And I'm going to come back again. I know I am. We're leaving Samar now on the bridge. We're going back over to late 8. This island is a big reason I'm still here. He is San Pani-Coloured Bridge, I missed. I missed the... F***ing stupid f***ing... I got a video of the bridge instead. Maybe classic, the unveiling of the bridge, the reveal. You got the aim off. A great traverse, a very dull art speal. But we're back in Tacloban. And as we hit the diversion road, I had no idea what was in store. And this is why we use ways. It's min work, does that mean minimum work? I cut this shot two seconds early. Wait, wait, what? Wait, what? For dinner shocked by for dinner. In the Philippines, you didn't expect this. You just be glad in this, haven't you? I just rolled up right now. You and you are conniving. Now I know why you sent Kumar with me. And let him make him drive to your keeping me under control. This plan happened literally at like 10.30 last night. I missed his coupons and I thought, oh my gosh, you guys are in G1. Dude, I'm gonna go and blow Commander's mind. They'll never expect this. It was so shocked. There'll be a foreigner, surprised by a foreigner, in the Philippines. I knew something was up. He wouldn't tell me his plans. He was very interested in my plans. And then he stopped. I filmed this excellent restaurant before. This time, Tonkoulas is vlog. Boy, first time. I thought you this. Because you know it's gonna be a motor vlogger soon. Legend, boy, first time. That's for you. It's a bag. It goes around your hips. Oh, thank you. I don't know what this is. That's for you. Thank you boy, first time. I was meant to meet boy, first time in Malagondon. It didn't happen. I'm gonna see you soon, mate. You can never leave me. I'll always find you. You know, if I can copy you, you can pop me better. I love followers club. You're so happy. You know it's so funny. I was just thinking about this. As I was walking over, I was like, oh, I feel like a jerk. Like putting the things in the car. And I was like, wait a minute, that's my car. You are so Canadian. By the way, the third man still here with us. Look. Dude, that's so creepy. That's where I creep. That's where I creep in the thing I did on camera earlier. Are you bringing it to freaking... We are. We're bringing it. To be honest, we were going to hide it. Now it's just going to be funny to take that to check point. Imagine they open the door. What the? I don't know. Now I know. Now I understand everything. He was being so quiet earlier. I'm usually quiet. And driving much slower than usual. I was wondering, what are you doing? Are you tired? The sabotage. The sabotage. Don't trust this man. All that man, they're sneaky. Now I've got to get him back somehow. Right, only sneaky on our new friends. Now we've got to get him back somehow. Yeah. I think I think I think I... I like it. The creepiest thing. Oh, one lane. One lane. Illegal. Illegal turn. Heading south. We retreated to a whistle stop tour of Latest landscapes. That's a player game. A fine cool ass. He disappeared in the distance while I was at the ATM. And he was shouting in public. American, give me money. He's ahead. We've escaped the city traffic. We're heading south. We're heading south. We're heading south. We're heading south. We're heading south. We're heading south. We're heading south. We're heading south now. I really want to see Panat on Island sunset. This guy's shown up to ruin it. And now... Good old plans. You were working with him. Savotage. Savotage. Savotage. Is this a wonder? I don't know. It's the municipality of something later. We don't know where. It's not the municipality of Latest. He's next to Bilaver. I hope we don't know where we are. It's a mystery. We will never know. And also cool asses somewhere. Along, way away. Stand. Stand. The gatekeepers. Are the exit gatekeepers. Oh, there's more! And as we got closer and closer, it seemed like we were going to make it. I just tripped over that. No, it was just that on before. We're going to put the fast cat. We're going to stay in some regards tonight but forget that we're going to put the fast cat. We have time to go to the saddle and come back. Hello, fast cat. Fast cat's the best. You know why? Because it's fast, fast earring. Hello, it's your turn. Hello, it's Taron Fie. Okay, we're going down to the saddle. At least cameo. Ninja moves. Calculated move. That's a risky ninja move. Oh, that's an ninja move there. We can do it, Corvader. What else we can do? Prasso Baru. Yes. Future Subaru athlete. Okay, we're not going to make the saddle. It's a bit too far. We got stuck behind a truck but this view of the saddle. This is what I really wanted to see. I'm going to have to come back again and actually drive this road again in light. But this is for the future. That's for the future. The slandall. The slandall. Sorry. That's an end here. What a beautiful place. Damage but not destroyed by Odette. It was totally devastated actually after the typhoon. But it's going to come back. What a beautiful, beautiful part of the world. And we need to go back so we don't miss our boat. Which is we were told to be there in 20 minutes. We can do it. Yeah. Sometimes we just have to accept. It's got to wait for another time. And this time we need to rush back to the port. The cold-colding continues. It's a fast-cap piester. I'm going to use my speed to be a allocation of one go. Do it. Yeah. What we said about it. All the travel. Same. Subaru athletes coming up. Happy piester fast-cap. A lot of fish. Mascana Hansa, bass bass earring. Bass bass earring. Bass bass earring. Bass bass earring fast-cap. Is that it? It's a fast-cap. It's a fast-cap. It's a fast-cap. Alright, push that. You say push that? No. Push that. Viva, Viva, send your fast-cap. A night trip with the most out-hard and beer. The Subaru Go City. I didn't expect this. Dude, I am so surprised and shocked right now looking at the boulevard in Suriga. Good luck. We have Lambanon. You are naked. Put your headband on. Hold on, hold on, one second. Mr. Duh, what are you doing? Reminding myself of last time I pulled this out. The reason that there's some missing is that I drank it early in the morning and think it was water. This is Lambanog from somewhere in Keson province. Go back, cephalvlogs and you'll find out where I forgot. What was that? It smells like coconut vodka. Sorry, I pointed the camera at us when you were talking. It smells like Nike, it's 1972. But the problem is... Good boy like that. I can't beat them. This was banned by the Americans because people used to have met an op. And now the FDA recommend you do not buy in unsealed. That's what we did. You really do look like Leonardo DiCaprio. You do? Side to side view. Leonardo DiCaprio. Leonardo DiCaprio. Leonardo Capoico. Leonardo DiCaprio Tango. Capoico. This one for you. Shut by. Straight. Straight, straight. Look at this. Chaser it? No, chaser. I've only got three cups and I've already called them once and got over there. Don't be excited if you're doing it. So we're going to drink it straight first and then I was thinking we could mix it. After, after a British style which is... You know, you get that. I'm going to hold my camera so I can laugh at you. Especially you. You'll still make it. I am naked because... What? Do you do? Do you do whatever? Put this on your head. Yes. Go. For you guys. It's like in the morning. In the morning you put a dirty t-shirt. So you don't walk around top. In your commander I'll do anything. Ziggy down. Where's the chaser? Do you do such chaser? You won't. I know I'm going to cringe after I eat this. Very feminine. Worse. Ziggy, man and boys. It's pretty good. It's pretty smooth. Yeah, actually it was pretty smooth. I thought there was going to... Actually, it's going to be bra. Yeah. Actually, there was a lot smoother than I expected. I was thinking there was going to be like that evil kind of tequila after taste, but no, it's good. No. I like this a lot. It's very, very good. A doubt of it into the finished shape. Come with me. I don't think you can handle it. Look, look through this door. Honestly, let's look through this door. This is the mouth out balcony I've ever been on in my life. Oh. I told you. It's the prison balcony. Fakes. Fakes. Fakes. Fakes. Fakes. Fakes. Fakes. Fakes. Fakes. Fakes. Fakes. Fakes. Fakes. Fakes. Fakes. Fakes. Fakes. Fakes. Fakes. Fakes. Fakes. Fakes. Fakes. Fakes. Fakes. The only thing I script. Is everything. The truth comes out. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Lamb and all brings the truth out. Lamb and all brings the truth out. What the hell is going on today? Please try one and save this. Save my video and get rid of it now. No, I just need a whole short power and chicken. We need to try these, these are the best. What the hell is going on today? Please try one and save this. Save my video and get rid of it now. No, I just need a whole short power and chicken.
