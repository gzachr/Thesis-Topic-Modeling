 The broskies are back in town baby. We're back. What's up gang? Oh man it feels so good to be back guys. We've been gone for pretty long but we're back in the Philippines. This time we're in Manila. Where is it? In Makati. All right guys so our plan for today is today's vlog is we are going to try these legendary Manila french fries that we've heard about so much right? Legend has it this french fry is a legend and apparently you can get all of these french fries in a bunch of different flavors so we need to try this out and that's what we're gonna do later but now we're going to explore the real Makati because from what we've heard like Makati is all about like big high-rises, big luxury buildings, the money, moles. We ain't about that. No man we want to see where the people of Makati are. So that's what we're gonna do right now. But first let's grab a snack around here because Prosi's got to eat and this looks like a pretty good place to start. This is looking pretty damn good. You got like a purple exiting with it. I didn't know you could get purple eggs. Check that out. Dude that's the purple egg it comes from a purple chicken. You guys still have one chicken? No two flakes, two right. Yeah, one is. It's a purple chicken egg. No, I'm not. The purple chicken egg. Why not? Yeah, yeah, why not? Why not? Not purple, right? Purple? Okay, okay. Good. Like I'm already for another balloon right now. We're gonna take it easy. We just arrived. Me? Yo, chicken curry. Chicken curry, delicious. Let me have a chicken curry. So let's give what we got. We got some rice. We got an extremely tiny portion of chicken curry. And you have a purple egg. It's nice, it's nice little taste, you know. Yeah. First taste in vanilla. Or um, purple egg. Oh, purple egg. Oh, purple egg. This is. Wow. And it's all brown inside. So good. Delicious. So delicious. Wow. See, something is here. Why is the egg purple? This is uh, inside the soul. Ah, in the ground, say what it is. Karatung manbargisya. Alright, try this chicken curry out. And I've missed this so much. Let's try out this vanilla view. I'm so excited. This is the only adventure. Alright, Nina. We had the chicken curry in Sibu. You have a lot of the dog team. Ooh, that's really good. Manila. Chicken curry is so good. Alright, let's try out the purple egg. I have never seen a purple egg in my life. So apparently it is. You can put into the ground. I don't know if I have it all. And it's salted. Put in the ground so it won't soak up. Karatung, that's very interesting. I'm not sure, I'm not sure how I feel about that. But it is an interesting experience. Alright guys, we are so satisfied. And I'm ready to continue our Makati Exploration Adventure. And here we have organization at its peak. It may look like chaos, but it's all-gryce chaos. Like they say, don't fix what ain't broke. Alright, and that works. So it's perfect. I love the place. How are you? I'm good. We found a little central place. Yeah, this is cool man. This is where everything is happening in Makati. Look at this, Mr. E. No, thank you. Jeep knees man. They got the Jeep knees. Oh, he slowed down to go past us and be like, I like this man. This place looks really authentic. Eat, sleep, live and work. You can do it, it's bustling. It's just bustling. Yo, let's go down there. Yo, this area looks cool. This is really cool. This is really cool. This is honestly one of the coolest areas I've seen. So maybe, this is literally houses are still on top of houses. I like build out of like stuff. Look at this. Hello. Hello. I love the Philippines. The vides just people are so friendly around here. The Philippines man. The vides are just good everywhere you go. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Oh, it's sad. It's sad. You just don't know what you're going to see. You might have caught when you see pigeons in a cage. The dog doesn't seem to like us very much, risky. Here we have the authorized pineapple salesman of Makati. What's wrong with it? That's being like me. Hey! Hey! Hey! Everyone in the crib! Three babies! Three babies! Happy family! Far away! Hold on. Europe! Yes! Okay, goodbye! Three babies in the crib! Exactly! It's a happy family man. Hey! What's that? Jazz! What's your name? Nami! Nice to meet you. Nami!
