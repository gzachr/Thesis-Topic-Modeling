 Hello everyone, welcome to a restaurant idea. Today we are in a buddy's. Forget what comes after it, but buddy. Something with something. Something. It was a recommendation from a viewer and it seems pretty good so we got a ton of stuff. We're going to be trying it all for you guys today. Thank you. Clean table. Yeah, so we're going to be trying some breakfast foods and some non-verkites, but two breakfast foods. So we got a long salon, a type salon, a lumpy ang sheng pie with rice, two p.j.s, pineapple juice, and a kisavakite for dessert. We've got just ordered random things. That's a meal. It is a meal, it cost us $753 a peso. 14 bucks, I mean $7 a person. It's a lot of food. It is a lot of food. We'll see how much it comes out to be too much of an important stuff. Yeah, it seems like a lot. Both of them come with rice. We're trying Filipino breakfast here on our second day out. Let's do it. Are you only ever testing a Filipino breakfast? Jalabi. Can't do pie. Let's see how this is. I'm excited, I'm so hungry. I already see it over there. Oh! Yeah. Pineapple juice. Let's go with it. Better fill the whole glass. Okay, so we got some breakfast things that you're trying. Let's try some breakfast. Taste like pineapple juice from pineapple juice candy. Perfect. It tastes good. Oh my gosh. No masks? Alright. What? You can dig into these? There we go. Dig into this? We'll see how they are. Well, it's very hard outside. What about the procession? It's almost good. Is it right here? Why are you using a fork? It's easier. You have to use them all at the same time. Like this? Yes. It's a little bit good. They are pretty good. They are little bit good. They are really good. They are not as good as the other ones. They are good. They are good. They're good. They are good. That's awesome. They are good. They are good. Thank you. You're welcome. I'm so hungry. Look at this. It's good. It's good. I don't know. It's good. I love it. It's good. first sauce. Alright, I've gotta go. This looks like the thing we got at Giolabit, the sweet looking stuff. It's pretty salsa. Definitely better than the Giolabit one. It's not as sweet as that one one so I don't know if it is the same thing. Sorry, sorry. Oh, sorry. Sorry. It's the most right with the rice. It's really good. It's like, this kind of tastes like beef turkey in a way. It's a salsa. So you know how beef turkey is right in the middle. It's like that. It's actually very good. Yeah, it's not that rough but it's more like a little bit of chewy version of that. It's much better than beef turkey. Oh wait, it tastes like beef turkey. It's like, is it better than the deni's eggs? Those were pretty greasy. They were very, very tasty. That tastes like an egg. Oh my. Yeah. Alright, we just got a little bit of thing here because why not? Why not? Oh, it's a sweet sour sauce. Oh, that's a sweet sour sauce. Oh, that's a tasty. Is it the mango one? I'm not sure. That's pretty tasty though. Oh, spice. A little bit of a nice sweet spicy maybe. Try that. I mean, like, you're getting really good. That's really good. It's like a dumpling filling. That's like a dumpling filling inside of this place. I mean, I was like, no, I'm looking at the ones I'm showing. And we get some more rice. We have a lot of, we are becoming Filipino. Maybe even, I've eaten so much rice in the last three or four days that I think it's my month like max. I usually eat rice like two times a month. Maybe three. Back home. We've had it at least six times. Three days. No, I eat time. All four. They're playing meals. Game of the... Wow, those are really good. They're really, really good. Like, no, they should. Okay. How about you, Kim? Take us, take us a little bit of this. The beefy? The beefy bowl? The beefy bowl, hey. Just reminds me of Kokouji meat. The one that I got at the creator of Friends Georgia. It's very similar to that. Not as good as the one I've been holding. No, since I don't have a cool, as cool as my name, it's called Tapsalong. Tapsalong. I thought it was actually comparable to one of the best. I will say. That's really good. Let me try some of this soy sauce. Wow, it didn't give when I stuck into it. It's outside. They... What? It's really good. When you bite into sauce, it's usually the outside, like, kind of pop. That's one of the outside skins, pretty toss. The inside is... I think, adding a little bit of the cake. It tastes good, though. It's got good seasoning on it. What did you see? I have last but not least, just salt. Okay, look at this. Whoa. So, that was one. That looks... Galoutinus. That was one of the answer I was just to salutate. Oh, well, that is... Very good, I'm just going for a big bite. Go bigger, go home. I hope we get stuck in the road. Hopefully it's not hot anymore. I got a... What's it called? Garlic ones. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that is 100%... Little watery. Wasn't the most ripe pineapple, maybe. That'd be a big bite. No, really. It almost reconnected. Just gonna... mush all over. I'm seeing if it's hot, though, so I don't burn my... Burrant and mouth open. It's steamed at one point, but I don't know what that is. Here we go, here we go. Have a little bit of radio. Thank you. It's so good, it's really... It sounds like it. I don't think it's like a pancake. Really? It's like a pancake. Jello. I just feel like... ...onnie. I don't know, it's like a bunny. It kind of tastes like the sweetest of a pancake. I mean, like the... ...part of whatever. Riddle? Yes, so like, it has like the brittle taste. I'm not gonna put honey on it, and then it's the nice texture. It's pretty delicious. Give me a go, buddy. I did... I said, buddy, I just realized we're in buddies. What about you, Josh? Oh, man. Look at that. All right, I've been for the food challenge for this video. Somebody will eat this until they're excited when they bite. Wait, for good luck, you gotta pat it two times. Wow. Amazing. All right, another big bite here. Big bite. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. It's... I think I dropped some cinnamon in there, too. Yeah, maybe a little bit. It had an interesting taste, because the rice with the inside doesn't necessarily have a... ...super amount of flavor, but in the outside it's... ...chittery. Wow. That really goes out. It is really good. I did a big portion. We can definitely do this pretty easily. It's a big meal. We didn't know what we're doing, really. Is this gonna be like a small meal? We get more later? This is a big meal. We will be full after we eat these. Oh, shoot, and he's gonna pour. Oh, dearie. Not now. There's not back to the bowl. It's all clear. I don't really know. There's vegetables, I think. Is it more fried? Maybe there's some pepper on there. All right. We ate the rice. All right, now, best rice. I think of my rice in the back. Are you sure? Do you even try my rice? Wait, let me try. Your rice is the best? Yeah, okay. So, my rice was the best. My egg, I think, was the best, too, even though I didn't even try it. How dare you disrespect my egg like that? I didn't expect you to put the whole egg in your mouth right now. Big challenge. This is so gross. There's so water. So, after that, if your egg is still the best, no. This is much less for the oil. So, my egg is the best egg. I agree. These are amazing. Really, really good. So, okay, what's better? These or the sauce that I think is? I think these made it. I think that like goes better. These are really good. I really like sauce, as you do, too. Like, sauce is one of my favorite, like, correct the title of these. That's good. I literally like the bowl of gold you meet that I had in that. I like the taste of the best dessert. Good job, you're one of the dessert category. And you went to appetizer category. category. That's the sauerkraut right now. Sorry. We got bonus lemon-eating thing here. It's definitely a lemon. No, it's got a nice little top. We, wow, it smells super sour. So, how are you going to do it? Are you going to squirt it? Oh. And, like, bite down. Oh. Betuch-Milk. Can I have a mancy? Possibly. Yeah. I feel like that's right. You should just find a cut in your mouth and spread it right in here. It's a very sour. Wow. I would do mine as well, but that's how we discovered this time. Here's my real love. And now. I don't want to. I don't have any more drink. Oh, wow. That's really tart. It is really. I still feel it. It would be 30 for hours now. It's a coating of my mouth. I'm going to be able to do it. I'm going to be able to do it. I'm going to be able to do it. I'm going to be able to do it. I'm going to be able to do it. It's a coating of my mouth. Yeah. We're done. Look at all this. We ate all of it. We ate it. And now everyone said it would be like, oh, you guys, we're in here. That's why you're sick. In India, the Thai got food poisoning. Real food poisoning. And the real food poisoning. And everyone was claiming that it was going to be over eight. You don't even know. I had as much fruit as him all the time and that didn't get it. and you don't have bloody diarrhea for four days straight unless you have food boys very well I've never overeat and they're like ah sure here comes a bowl of water and try it typically before it would eat more than me too so you think you'd be more accustomed to that than I would yeah a lot of food in Georgia and Dubai Yikes the Yikers indeed let's hope that doesn't happen again anywhere Philippines okay so that was buddy I was good good food a lot of food stomach is full very full a lot of rice didn't right up here that is the thing we're not used to that much rice and we're just pound and rice I don't know if it's good for the digestive system probably not probably not that much of a change but it was good good job good recommendation person I recommended it it was really good that was really good we'll see you in the next one we're going to go explore Eastwood city
