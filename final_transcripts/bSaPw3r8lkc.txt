 Maga dang, umaga guys, that was probably terrible. Pronunciation, but welcome back to Moral Bowl. It's like 8am now. It's very early. The boys aren't even up yet. I just thought I'd go for a little morning stroll along the coast and get some food. Go to this cafe that I've been recommended called Shaka Cafe. Apparently it's really good. Smoothie bowls and whatnot and I love my smoothie bowls. So yeah. This doesn't really give you the best impression of Moral Bowl, but trust me, it's nice. It's extremely touristy, probably the most touristy place in the Philippines, but I still not touristy compared to other countries like Thailand. So I like it. I really like it. And the thing about, like, Marlboro is, there's just so much to do here. Like, so many different activities. Or just chill out. Or just explore. So I love it. And I've been thinking about like how much I've been enjoying my time here in the Philippines. I was just like, one of my favorite countries to date, whether I could live here is a different question. And we were talking about it with the boys last night. And I'm not sure whether right now it's got the infrastructure for me to be able to live here. If I was going to live here, it would need to be somewhere like, you know, Moral Bowl or somewhere on the coast. But the issue is the infrastructure, the Wi-Fi, the things like that. It's not good enough yet. So maybe in the future. Let me know when they have good Wi-Fi here. Because the Wi-Fi is terrible. The Wi-Fi in the city is good. So I do city is good. Manila is good. So good morning. As we come across, we've got lots of souvenirs. This is the Sardine spot. Good morning. Good morning. We've got a food spot here. Good morning. How are you? Good? Hello. All right, we're back. This is it. Shaka. Looks like a bit of me. Good morning. Come to the car. Come to the car. You speak Tagalog? You speak Tagalog? Yes. OK, good. I'm fluent in Tagalog. No, I'm taking. I wish. Huh? I don't want to give you more. I'm being a pilot. You put me on the spot here now. No, I said one day I will. OK. But not today. Anyway, I've heard this is the best coffee in all of mobile. Yeah? I didn't know. Didn't tell me. OK. Can I take a seat? Yes. OK, thank you. What's your names? Rose, you are. Good day. Everyone, Filipinos, always have very nice names. Very unique names, not just boring names. Here we go. We got smoothie bowls. That is all the way up my street. Yes, sir. We got juice, smoothie, and a bliss cup. I've never seen a bliss cup. But I think all of us are just, you'll never look. Please, could I have the smoothie bowl and coffee combo? Yes, sure. Could I have the Cloud9 Cook? Cloud9 Cook. Because I'm a cook. And then, the cappuccino as well. cappuccino, half cappuccino or cold cappuccino? Hot spills. And also, please, they're two fighters. Thank you very much. You got a sore throat, guys. I think maybe that will sort me out. Yeah, it's all with a lot of genres. OK, perfect. That's it. Thank you. So 580, no? Thank you. I'll just give you a change. Perfect. OK. Perfect. Thank you. Oh, is that the smoothie bowl? Oh my god. Decoration on point. So this is the vibe right now. I feel like I'm back in Bali with this. We got a nice silk cappuccino produced deliciously. And look at this, the presentation. Look at this. This is some point. Cacao, coconut nuts, peanut butter. And then we've got a nice, so juice mixed with ginger and things like that. Because I've got a sore throat, like I said. That's actually really nice. Sometimes the health boosts the juices, and actually, it's not very good. That one's good. That is good. Next up, I got a room in the presentation. So good. Smooth bowls are incredible, guys. On the set, I can come on every day. And then to learn how to make them. So when I go back to the UK, I know I'm still just so, such an easy meal to eat. And then when you get the mixture of the hard bits here, really nice texture. Oh, you need to get that. And then obviously the coffee. Coffee by the end of the ride. Oh, that little shot of caffeine. Perfect. This is a great meal. It's going to be a little bit expensive, but this is like the only Western place in the whole of all of our food. I was prepared for it. As you can see, guys, all finished. Actually, we're sitting there for quite a while. I really like half an hour. Just enjoying it. Thank you so much. Bye-bye. What's that? Little T-card? Yeah, T-card. Yeah. If you're going to visit our shop in Shagal, Bohon. Oh, there's multiple. Oh, manila. Yeah. It can also be a tea. OK, perfect. And you get one check on this. OK, there we go. Perfect. This one, I've got a coffee. OK, five, four to go. Yeah. OK. Thank you so much. Have a good day. Bye. And then the other thing I was going to talk about was like some of the stuff I've done here and whether I'd recommend it. So the Sardine Run, which is the issue just there, that is also very good. You don't need to talk like that. You can literally just go and swim. You just need to snorkel. I would definitely recommend that. Not as good, but it's still a very cool spectacle. Yeah, you literally just ask around and just go up there. Hello. Hello. Welcome to your black. Thank you. Late for school. Thank you. Then there's turtles. I didn't see any turtles. I'm not that bothered because I've swam with turtles those before. And then the last thing is the Well Shark Tour. I didn't do that because multiple reasons. Time is quite a little bit far out the sides of the island. It would take like an hour to drive there, which is not bad at all, actually. But that's not the main reason. The other reason is because it is very controversial. And animal welfare is something I take very seriously. I didn't really research, like I tried to research and find out whether it is good for the animals or bad for animals, but there was very conflicting information. Some people say that they are badly animals because they are supposed to be migrating, but they feed them every day. And then some information says that only the ones that would not be able to migrate anyway are there. So I don't know. You guys maybe tell me in the comments. Good morning. Good morning. How are you? Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Oh, here we go. Hello. Banana. I've just eaten. I've tried these. I've tried these. Very good. You usually put sugar. No sugar on. Yes. I've tried these.

I have. I know turtles just saddens. Oh, okay. So you like it? Yes, I love it. But I leave soon. I don't want to leave. Oh, just extend. Yeah, shy just live here. Nice to stay here for a couple of weeks. I would love to. I would love to. I would love to have me more. How much for one? Just one thing. Just one? Just one. The one is real pearls. Real? Yes.

Nice, right? They're like a vlogger. They're like a vlogger? I am a vlogger. That's right. Haha. That's what we mean. This is beautiful. Oh, you've got the well-shark. You don't need to... You don't need to do the well-shark toy. You can just help get one of these and say you've done it. I've got a lot of English. You're from England? Yes. How did you know? You're the first person to guess. People usually get it wrong. Because you're just eating your scent. They usually say USA. Oh, because I talk quick. It's a slanger. But you understand me? Yes. Your English is also very good. Thank you. We're just learning English. Very good, very good. Okay, I don't have any money on me now, but I will go to my house and come back a bit later. Okay. Okay, thank you. Bye. I'm going back to the shop with some fresh pesos. And I'm ready to buy a gift. Maybe for my mother? Or maybe for me? First we've got to navigate through the roads. Woo! It's a little bit bumpy and I'm also driving with one hand. Safety first always. I'm a professional. You seem like a lovely lady. So I'm a man in my world. I said I'd come back. So I will come back. Okay. Let's see if we can find it. We've got a nice little hotel. All the Koreans I think? All right. Just a short walk back to where the Sadin run was. I'm back and you can see here. It's a lot busier. It must be like six or seven boats here. Full of tourists doing their fishing. But here we go. We're back at the stall. Let's see if the lady is still here. It's been about three hours so maybe she's not here. I'm not sure. We'll see. Here we go. Hello. I'm back. How are you? Good. No, I know. Oh, I buy now. This is lovely. The most from the shirt. Yeah. And this one is the putt car. This is beautiful. And you got this? Wow, look at that. It's huge. That one is from this one. This is real? That one is a oyster. Oh, it says you find the... Somebody get the pearl. Okay. I don't want to get it. How much for everything? You want to buy everything on this table? How much? It's for sale. It's for sale. It's for sale. I'm not sure. You want to buy it? Yes. I want to buy it. This is it. Which is everything? All table? Yeah, how much for the whole table? Just like this? Yeah. You pick up $5000, yes. I will give you $5000. But I just want just what this? Just what this? Yeah, yeah. Are you sure? Yeah of course. Who you? Who you and your family? Really? Yeah, so everyone, yeah, yeah, no problem. Because you're working hard. Because since when typhoon, all our shop is much better typhoon. And also all our subanar, also much better. Really? These souvenirs will lend money in the bank to survive. That's good. We can have a bit of business. I know. And I see you working in the seats all day. So, yeah. And even until now, we don't have door for the subinner. We just cover it in the night time. This is for our subinner. And in the morning, we start selling again. OK, well, very happy with the gifts. And I hope you enjoy. I'm going to give you one. No, it's OK. It's OK. I will give you the nice one. That's very nice for me. No, no, no. I don't want the nice one. You keep yourself. This is only for you. Are you sure? OK. Thank you so much. I will give to my mother. Yes, that's nice for your mother. OK. Thank you so much. OK. Have a good day. Bye-bye. All right. We got a nice little gift here. They seem to be very... Hello. How are you? They seem to be very grateful, which is nice. Sometimes they are a little bit shocked. She was shocked. But these are my favorite videos to make, especially when they're very surprised. I'm going to wear it now, actually. I actually know, because it would be hard to put on. But those are my favorite videos to make, like, literally, that will make my day. That will make me feel great. And I'm only able to do this because I get donations. Some of it is also my own money. Some of it is donations. And so if you want me to carry on making videos like this, then be sure to use the PayPal link or the Patreon link in the description below. Every penny that I get sent, every dollar I get sent, goes straight into the hands of these people. So it's a charity. I guess you could call it. But 100% goes to people. And none of it goes to me. And literally, my heart is so full when I do these types of videos, because you know these people need it so much more than I need it. Going to a hotel. I could stand like a five-star hotel for one night, or I could give it to these people and change. Not change their life. It's not that much money. But make their day, make their week. And hello, sir. I'm OK. Thank you. I'm OK. I spent too much money today. But yeah, super interesting video. I love to see the people. I love to see how they live and learn about them. And she was a really lovely lady. And so yeah, I thought I'd give her a reward. Hello. Hello. Good to have you back. Thank you, sir. And I just went back actually. Just they were asking what my YouTube channel was. And they were the whole family had come. And they were like asking questions. And they said they're going to treat themselves and buy a whole month supply of rice, which is just like that makes me so happy that they're able to use that. Put that to good use. And yeah, hopefully, I didn't actually realize that Sebu was one of the areas that was actually targeted by the typhoon. So it's really been impacted here. And so anything that I can do to help, I'm going to be making a few more videos left of these. It's still got a little bit of money just on these people. So yeah, super fun. See you brother. Nice to meet you. Yeah, we're also friendly here. And so yeah, anyway, that was a super fun video to make. My favorite video, if I've already said. And make sure that you support me. If you can't give any money, that's absolutely fine. Just try and like the video in return. Maybe subscribe. But yeah, I'm just really enjoying my time here. And for me, in the future, the direction I want my channel to go in is obviously I'll always do travel. I want to do way more off the beaten path travel, way more solo, or not necessarily solo, but wild adventures, and documentary style. And probably will stop doing the daily videos soon. But my favorite thing to make is these videos. So I'm going to be trying to make more videos in the future, but obviously they are only possible because I view guys and your help. So yeah, I'm going to finish the video there. Had an awesome day. Thank you so much for watching. And I'll see you in tomorrow's video.
