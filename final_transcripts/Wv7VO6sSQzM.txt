 Things that I've only seen in supermarkets in the Philippines, ketchup that's made out of bananas. They actually love this stuff. There's more than one brand of it. All of the cola drinks are normal, except for phanta is royal, truly the king of drinks. If your kids won't eat their vegetables, you can always sneak it in in broccoli juice. That sounds delicious. And who doesn't love carbonated milk and yogurt drinks? And after that, you can wash off with minty body wash. They also have minty wash for down there. Even these are minty, which I've heard are way too strong. But then you can warm up with k-pop themed hot brew. I'm sure the ladies get hot just thinking about it.
