They're not allowed But they do it It's not allowed? It's not extra just the judicial killings Oops In Lego drug They got caught Slaco, is it a song that gives warning to those who take drugs? The police is like a cemetery It's a big car Yeah, they're all under arrest They're showing that I think they're talking about something very deep I'm so scared It's so frustrating because I don't understand lyrics It's like killing a criminal I think this is something like under-heat pop Jang Ra Oh, yeah, I thought it was a rap The police is giving chasing him Run Run Oh, what's that?

I get it, drugs is bad I know that drugs are bad And people who's taking drugs are not good But you can't just kill them because they did something wrong I guess if you're in the lower class in the Philippines It's easy to get drugs It's easy to get money It really all boils down to what happens in the government There's employment rates, safety, and you know, poverty people Do get support from the government Every element, every aspect you see this on boils down to what happens It's in the legislative and executive and judicial system And how it's so unfair That people get treated like this Just because someone did something bad Someone did drugs or someone, you know, dealing Just because they did that They get killed for it That's inhumane because it's taking someone's life away Dude, it's not therefore that they have to run the drug sometimes It's family situations It's government situations, they're employment It's a deep dark circle of unspoken things And complicated situations It's just very painful They tell us, oh, like, it's the people who have to fix themselves But no, we can't Because some people they don't even have a choice to fix themselves Because they don't get that support But there's from family because maybe rehab is too expensive And they need to pay their bills, they need to pay their rent And they need to support their families So they need to get money from somewhere The last resort is drugs Which is really, really, really bad Horrably bad Oh, it's not just them who are affected by it It's us as a country who's affected by it Because it affects our moral standards Our ethics Because it's killing people without justice There are justice If justice When you arrest someone for illegal drugs or possession of drugs You arrest someone on a charge Then you take them to jail, then you take them to court when they have a lawyer They have to have a lawyer present to talk But no, they go right away to killing someone and it's so unfair They can't get the help they need It's just really bad It's a really serious topic That no one really talks about Because they're actually really scared to talk about it There's censorship in media It's really hard to talk about it If you're not in the situation itself So you have to have empathy on those people Who actually are in the situation And find a way that you can help the society grow And the country develop and build a moral standards It was at this point that we've realized that Mishie may have offended certain people Because of this, we asked her to further clarify her stance on this issue No, no, no, no, I'm not against the government Yeah, yeah, I'm just stating the facts that are present right now As also from a foreigner's perspective Because I grew up in a first world country I grew up where obviously drugs are very illegal We have a government system that supports people who are go through rehab or who are elders And who are going through hard times in poverty Going from that perspective and trying to empathize I'm trying to see what's there and what can I do as a person As a student to help those people who are in need Who are suffering in that situation So I'm not against the government Yes, she's not She's not the case of her I'm supporting the people who are in need Like I want to be their voice Oh, oh I want to be their voice So I can't be that kind of person Yeah I'll vote for Mishie That's one of the biggest problems here in the Philippines Especially for the slum areas I think the third video is my favorite since it is with the governmental problems and intervention Especially on the ones who are living in the bottom of the society Is that real? It's real Ah, so it's not real There were even news that the police just shoot people who were even taking drugs And then the family of the victims are like, you know It only happens with the poor Like those who are rich, they get away with it And it's always the poor people who get blamed for you some drugs and stuff First video, I'm just saying this not just because I'm ready enough grown up to say this But like, it's true, like the message of the music video is like, take a slow kid You're still young, enjoy your youth Because when you grow up, when you go to like college and after graduation when you go to society I mean, in the real world, you're gonna get so stressful Like there are a bunch of responsibilities You really have to take for like your family, your wife, children, or something like that So yeah, that's true It's very stress-free when you're in elementary school or like kindergarten Because yeah, I was like that too I really like the first video for our space It's so they have their own style, their own union Their color of doing music is so defined already The more you listen to it, you won't get so offered, man And I like the idea of bringing in children who can participate in their music video Because it's gonna stay in their memory for a long time Even when they grow up, you know when I was young I was to be gay, it was more in a mixture of boys For me, when I grew up, when I grew up as a kid, I played in the sandbox I played the toys Like like plant, plant Right right right이라고ity, Creeps and those those things Hanging 12 years, for like three years половish hands Like target What to say, what Friends these days look at theершono hablaéquacy students don't go to hatch I want to be honest with you.
