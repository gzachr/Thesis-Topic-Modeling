People fear what they don't understand. That's why our family has always been the bridge between Malaya and the Supernova. And the Supernatural! What the hell are we doing? No! It's so gross! What is that? Yeah! Brat! No! I image of the Philly Bee. It's fun thing. Everyday I go to the Philly Bee. I have so much fun. But this anime is totally different from my experiences. So they are Philly Bee, no? Yeah, I don't think so. But they speak English. You know, Philly Bee can speak English, but usually, many people speak Tagalog. So I'm not sure they are Philly Bee, no? Keep going. Okay. The drives are an age-making party. You have quite a poke. That balance you and your father have tried so desperately to maintain. It's out there. You're a trash. You have me picking up. Can we do sure how the underworld these days? What happened? What happened? Actually, I really love Philly Bee. And I love Manila, but I don't like Philly Rao. So, for me, it's still scared. Me too. Really? But you look so tired. You scared me. What? Oh my god. What happened? Okay. I'm not a battle. You are born ready. I think the creature is a China. Do you hear it calling for me? You want my advice? Keep your heads down. They're coming for revenge. If the luck comes, get in the realm. Kill her. There's something bigger going on here. The drives need to be united. Oh my god. I'm so curious. Go ahead. Let's put an end to this. Let's put an end to this. I think it's totally different. It's the way my image is. And this one. I'm so curious. Because you know, I have watched Philly Pena movies a lot. And I think almost Philly Pena movies are like romantic. I'm so sorry. But I'm so curious. Philly Pena people are really like horror movies. What not. Ooh. The screen is so beautiful. And so. Where is Mania's point? Oh. I'm so curious to check in the world. City. This one? Ah, you have a lot. But I can understand you are meaning. Because Mania and Tokyo is similar. Please let me know which point is like Lely Mania. Yeah. So right now we searched the anime on Netflix. And we can find like Lely Mania's point. Lely Mania's point. Oh. Oh. Oh. Where? My name is Philly Pena Restaurant. Oh. And now Mangui Nasaka is everywhere in the Philippines. So it's really like Philippines. Because we don't have Mangui Nasaka in Japan, right? Yeah. But I want to see like Mania's view. Ah. I find it. Yeah. This is a so hungry Thai mother. Wow. So mania. I always hungry, you know. Not only in the Philippines. So terrible. And this is so ugly. Oh. And we watch only like testar one. So we cannot find which one is Mania's point. If we watch all of this anime's, maybe we can feel Lely Mania's point. Actually honestly, it's little bit sad. Because you know Mania is happy images. But this one is little bit sad and scary things. Sooo. So Philly Pena like this anime. Yeah, I'm so curious. So please let me know. I really love Philly Pena. So I want to watch it. But little bit scared. Yes. But now, COVID-19. So I cannot go Philly. Yeah, that's true. But I watch this anime. Can't feel Mania's. Atomospheres. I already will see you. But if I have time to watch movies, I want to watch other YouTubers. Who live in Philly Pena's. So, we are in Philly Pena. There are not monsters. Yeah. Oh my god. Oh my god. But I don't know. I'm so kidding us. If I need people watch this one, I love Philly Pena. Do you like it or not? Maybe I don't want to watch it. Do you like it? But if you recommend I to watch it, I should watch it. So please let me know. That's all. I swear I want. I swear so hard. But I'm so glad because Netflix focused on Philly Pena's and Manila. I hope Netflix make the fun things about Philly Pena's. Thank you so much for watching. If you liked this video, please subscribe.
