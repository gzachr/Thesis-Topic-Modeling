We call it Chupaculo
It's called what?
I don't know if you also like rice with almost all the dishes
Where did you get that?
It's very surprising that we're actually having a conversation
Is it your first time to hear it?
It's my first time to hear it, yeah
I attempted to learn Spanish when I lived in Miami
Didn't go very far with that
What's up Philippines! Welcome back to another video
Today is a language day
You know, I want to keep it a little bit interesting on this channel
A variation of topics and something that I'm very interested in are languages
And especially languages that have similarities
You know, Germany for example
I speak German but I speak Austrian dialect
I can understand Swiss people but I sometimes have trouble even understanding Austrians
Because the dialects are so so different
So yeah, today I'm reacting to a video of Spanish versus Chavacano
Can they understand each other?
So fun to do these kind of videos
So I'm just going to jump straight into it and enjoy
In Zimbabwe we have this dish
But I don't know if I should say it
What do you mean?
We call it Chupaculo
It's called what?
Papi papi, papi culo
Hey guys, my name is Paul from Rice Squad
And today I'm joined with some of my friends
One speaks Spanish and the other speaks Chavacano
And we're going to see how similar these languages are
And we're going to see if they can talk with each other
So let's go see how they do
I like his videos by the way
My name is Jonathan
My family is from Peru and I speak Spanish
Hi, my name is Dearly
And I was born and raised in Zambuanga City
Which is in the Philippines
And I speak Chavacano
Which is a Spanish Creole
Thank you
Interesting
How are you?
Very good, very good
You too
Cool, yeah
I can understand right now
And my name is Jonathan
What's your name?
My name is Dearly
And how old are you?
I'm 29 years old
What's your favorite food?
Interesting
I like something from my country
Which is called aji de gallina
And it's like rice with chicken
And it has a spicy sauce
And yellow pepper
Okay, why is he
Has nothing with his own language?
Yeah, interesting
Yes, we also
We like to eat
Pita, food
And we also like to eat
Rice in the Philippines
Okay
Yes
For me, I love rice with almost everything
I don't know if you also like
Rice with almost all the dishes
Where did you get that?
I don't understand
Really?
How many
Sisters and brothers do you have?
Okay, brother, you can make sense of it, right?
One sister
And both of them are older than me
Where are the older ones now?
Again?
Where are the older ones now?
Oh
They are 12 and 14
More than me
Yes
Are your grandparents still alive?
Okay, grandmother
I have a grandfather
That is still alive
And a grandmother that is still alive
But they are from my mom and my dad
Do you know
That I am from the United States?
Or is this a different country?
Only my grandfather
My dad's grandmother
She is in Peru
From Peru
And my husband is from Peru
Okay, she can speak the language
Okay, so do you speak Spanish with him or not?
A little
A little
He doesn't know that I speak Spanish
Okay, it is very similar
The language
Because I can understand almost
Most of what you are saying
But not everything
There are words that don't
I can also understand
I can also understand a little bit
I wanted to learn Spanish when I lived in Miami
I didn't go very far with that
Did I?
But you know when you get older
Your brain is just slower
I should have done that when I was younger
So John, how much of that
Did you feel like you understand?
What is your reaction to that language?
So I feel like I understood maybe 80%
To maybe a little bit more of it
There was just like
A few words that I lost meaning on
And I was confused
And I just kind of filled in the blanks on what I thought I said
But for the most part you could understand everything
For sure
I think there was only one or two questions that I 100% didn't get
And I was like, can you say it again?
I don't know what you are saying
Alright, so do you really have a reason?
It is very surprising that we are actually having a conversation
Like literally understanding each other
And he is answering
Okay, I mean like I said earlier on
If you have the basics of the language
Let's say we are talking about
Roman languages
You kind of understand
It is like the same with Slavic languages
If I speak to people from Russia
I can make sense of a few things
When I focus a lot and then also from other countries
On the Balkans for example
Same with German
So if it is in the same language family
I think it is easy to understand, right?
My questions
That was crazy
I know
But you could understand everything you pretty much said
I did, yeah
What is the language you speak?
So I am actually speaking Chavacano
That is what the language is called
And that is a Chavacano
That came from Zambuanga city
But in Zambuanga city
Southwestern part of the Philippines
We still speak that
Is it your first time to hear it?
It is my first time to hear it
I knew about a place
Where they only speak a very specific
Spanish language
Closer to Manila, not Zambuanga
I have heard Tagalog
But I haven't heard Chavacano
Oh, I see
Was it very surprising?
It was surprising that I could understand so much of it
I know because it is
So our city is called Asia's Latin city
It is trying to make people
Know that we have that
Spanish Creole language
Which is the Chavacano
It is Chavacano
I also think that a lot of Spanish words
That are said in the Filipino languages
I am saying languages because
Filipino is not just Tagalog
That it makes it way more easier for them
To understand Spanish words
Right? It is crazy
So I am going to give you a couple of phrases
And then John, I am going to have you say it in Spanish
And then Deirdre, I am going to have you say it in Chavacano
Okay
Oh, okay
She is very beautiful
The woman is very beautiful
Yeah
I love listening to K-pop
I want to listen to K-pop
It is so different
Wow
How old are you?
Or how old are you?
What?
How old are you?
When is your birthday?
When is your birthday?
Call me on my phone
Call me on my phone
