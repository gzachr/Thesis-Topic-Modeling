 Future Friday. The freshest. Oh, this is a good one. You know that song I got? Holy night. Holy ghost. You know that song? What? That's right guys, right? Well, it's been sung by all iconic names from the Filipino music industry, including Mori said, sir, he only more less long at Regina Velasquez. And I think I knew a couple of new names as well. Oh, it's right. So let's give this a watch. And they're pretty much just focusing the whole video on some of the most difficult parts of all Holy nights. And yes, I know what song it is. I think it's going to be a church. I'll be home. Oh, for Christmas. Yeah, I sat down with Michael Bubley sat down yesterday, guys. Just wanted to let you know. Ah, hahaha. If I was very proud of that moment in this live, yeah. So I'd like exactly the same seat. Sure. There you go. Lea. A long time. The climates of the song. Those plays are church. Yeah, but not like this. How clueless the Guzm√°n? Where is the dangerous woman? Hey, how do they say good boys? You send this, aren't you? Yes, I do. Yes, you have to work with them. You sing it as well. You have to work with them. Go react to it. At the end. Yes, I do. I do. I do. I do. Go react to it. At the end. Please, please, I love that song. Is it even we were in a red dress? Yes. What a banger. Go on. Okay. The audio is so great. Oh, there you go. And F5. I thought it was a very different, just different. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, is she the pinnacle of when sort of genetics? Meet talent. Meet talent. A technique and talent. Yeah, definitely. She's like, yeah, absolutely. Because she was, right? A freak of nature. I think that that technique is also... She's also mixing a lot of different styles in there. Because towards that ending, she was also bringing back that classical training. So a lot of that upper, soft, pallid lifting. The pallid. Yeah, creating that really classical, rounded vowel sound. How do you spell it? Is it same as palette? Like that? I use some. No. That's not something that I'm... No, no, no. Pallid is like... The palette is like where you get your colors for. That's with double L and double T, I think. Okay, so she's got a good palette. All right. Moving on. So, let me go in here. Oh, my. Oh, my. Let me know you're a pop girl. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh. Oh, Sarah. And her anymore. Oh, she's several versions. Oh, she's several versions. The Martin is... The Martin is... The Jean Velasquez. She probably had some pastilles in her mouth. Oh, yeah. So mint, like chewing gum kind of thing. It's like candy. Yeah, it is. It's a sweet. And while she's doing that, in throat, it's like frozen cold. Yeah, she is icy. Anyway. That's a two, she had a tattoo. I don't know. Maybe it's just wonderful. Look at those stick on tattoos, you know. Fair play. I was gonna say something when you told her to go on the ground. Don't make apologies, I'm sorry. I forget it. I don't know what I was gonna say. I hate when I do that. It's beautiful. Every time. One I see. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Okay, look at that beer. Talking about the soft palate. It's not with its thickens. I don't know if she had done that song in that yellow dress called Butterfly. And then it became so famous when they thought, let's market it this way. Probably sure. Whatever. Very nice. What were you saying? What's about the technique? Oh my god. You're all over the place. Point. Okay, here. Here. Just like this, y'all. You see all the space that you're creating here. She's so lifted. Also, she's like a little bit of a weird mix between like twang. And actual full fold. So she is belting. But there is a lot of sustained help with that twanginess. She's also lifting the larynx further up, bringing it closer to her cheekbones, the sound itself. So this space that you're seeing here in the soft palate right towards the back, allows for the sound to round itself and not sound so caught right. So it's a little bit of a cutthroat because when you add a lot of twanginess into the picture, it cannot come across a little too irritating. Like it's hard to listen to it. It doesn't have that roundness, that warmthness that you probably are striving with a song like this. But, you know, people are struggling with a D5. She's out there doing like A5s and whatever for no reason. F-shop. G5 for no reason. She stays on the E5. And E5. Of course, Gigi girl. Okay, the outfits. Still touring. Jesus Christ. This version. Yeah, that's not the version that blare my church. This is the song. Oh, it's a little bit of a cutthroat. Oh, it's a little bit of a cutthroat. Yeah. Oh, Gigi. Oh, Gigi. What the hell? I want the vibe, boy. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh. No, that's not a singing my church. No, I'm sorry, but why not? What the fuck, what is this girl? Oh, it's going with the hell are you doing with your life? Chloe Redondo. Wow. Redondo means a round in Spanish. No, but that's right, correct, yes. But it actually will be Redondo, wouldn't it? If it was round for a woman. No, did you say Redondo? Well, like a little woman. Speak like a little woman! Okay. Yeah, exactly. Okay, okay, okay. Do it. What have you been doing here? Something crazy about Redondo? Wow, yeah. What speed? What have you been doing here? Like, Lily, Landora has the best cover to my list of irises, the climb. Yeah, she does. Oh, when I look at you, genuinely the best covers of her songs. I think the covers in her room? The best one. Are the freaking best covers just for me. Yeah, it's unreal, that. If you haven't seen that reveal, I think you were sat there, yeah. Oh my god, she just has one of those velvety voices, but she's so powerful as well, and she's out here, building G5s for her reason. I like her. I like her. She's got key, man. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Never. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. What are you talking about? That is so stupidly great. What? What? It was nice meeting you all. Honestly, what? What the fuck? That is insane. I don't know. I don't know. Because it's about the thin folds, isn't it? The thin folds? You thin fold them like this, and then you whistle. Well, you don't whistle like a missile of balls. Go ahead. Ah, sure. Catherine, I learned the next one. No, that was stupid. Go on. That was ridiculous. Oh, no. So that's like a popular tape. No, that's like a popular tape. Go on. Elaine did that run as well. And so did Regina. So I guess they'd all come from Regina. I don't know. We started it. Chloe. She's very old as hells. Oh, you say like that. Oh, I never seen that tape. Oh, yeah. That's right. Oh, you're right. Oh, yeah. Why? Why? Oh, no. Never. Oh, no. Oh, what the hell, man? Where are we? What the fuck is going on? I have to say that that whistle sustained that she was keeping on, that she was like coming in, in and out of that section there. That was so impressive. You know how hard it is to even modulate in that whistle register, and she's out there hitting the notes and coming off of it, like giving you a little bit of a riff, but it's not a riff. It's like, you know when you rev your bike, well, she's basically doing that on a whistle register like you know. I get sentiment. I get what you're saying. Ah, it's kind of stupid, I need to see that again. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. You know how hard it is to maintain that she actually had a hard time coming off of that because the, the, the, the, well, hard time, what is the hard time for her for Catherine like really? It's all subjective, subjective. But in her, but in her, but in that particular movement there from maintaining that tension, the right amount of pressure, air coming through the thin folds to kind of come down of that. It's quite difficult because you lose the whistle register really quickly. So to keep a hold of that as you're coming down is like, how? Oh, no. See, it's like a popular tape. Why? Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Oh, my God. Mori said, girl, what? Because that, that, yeah, that F5 towards the end. What? What? What? That F, yeah, that F5 towards the end. Dude, what the fuck? Wow. Wow. Wow. And they go gospel. Who started this? Yeah, what? For what reason? It's the Philippines shit. It's just weird, bro. Like everyone's like, see, look, cover, right? Everyone is always going to basically one up you. Oh, yeah, basically. There's so many singers with such great ability all over the place. So at some point, you're going to have to start pulling fucking tricks out the back. And you're lost. I mean, that's the entertainment industry at the end of the day. Can I listen to you all? But now I don't want to show you. No, it's not comparison. I just like hearing it. Yeah, sure. And I know it's your channel, but I also I can do what I want. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can type. Well, it's nervous. You can be a singer. Just go on Instagram, bro. Listen to it. What's the different part? What's the different part? I mean, you can be a singer with a voice. Yeah, it's 2016. I have a microphone there. You have no mic. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. That's good shit, dude. That's good shit. Oh, there is this good shit. Yeah, good shit. This is what I'm talking about. Wow, I nearly tear it up. This is what I'm talking about. You know what's funny? It's like, say you do that right. And then you go to like the Philippines, right? That's not it. That's like, that's good standard. I'm serious. That's like, that's a good fucking take. And then you have like, like, Elaine Durand comes next. Yeah. And then you're like, what the fuck is this? It makes a difference. Then you go like, Regina Blaske's go's after. Yeah. You're like, what? God bless you, yeah. Jesus. Yeah, but I spank still fuck. But you have no mic there, that's pretty good. And a mic. A cappella. Yeah, that was a joke. Jesus Christ, dude. Well, it's not a cappella because there is a crack. There is a crack. But you know what I mean? Ro. Ro as a dog. Oh my god. You were all talking that song, dude. There was an even an overhead mic. Nothing, bro. There's a microphone from the phone. Yeah, but, yeah. That's to put it into perspective. It's like, and I think it's also quite cool because it puts a lot of the commentary you say about these singers. It puts it into perspective. Because if he say it was coming from me, right, I don't know how to sing. Yeah. At that level. No way near, right? I don't think I do either. No, I mean, at that level or at the level of the ladies and stuff. It's like, I'm no way near that level. So my commentary on vocal stuff is only limited to, however much I know. But then when you listen to it from a singer, I think that's what people really enjoy. Because it's like, oh, fuck. Well, I just say, I wonder if other people really think she's that good. Well, at least you have a point of skill to execution comparison there. Yeah, of course. Like, whether it's like to that standard or it's not, you still have that base of effort equals the value of the song. Oh, we were talking about this to KZ, actually. Yeah. We were discussing Jaya. And one of the things that she spoke to Jaya about this, I don't mind if you say this. And it's like, you have to figure out stylistically what works for you as well. And it's like, that's why when you look at this covers from all these other singers, it's like, stylistically, this may not be the things that they excel at. Of course, I think in that curated video, you've, you've, the video has chosen the singers that stylistically do do well in this environment, you know, ballads and, and big belters. And, and big on the vocal like, the bandit. Approbatics. Yeah, I'm surprised you means not on that bloody, thank you, Mika Pili. But, stylistic choices, obviously, you know, you have singers like Jaya or like KZ, and Stagom and Jaya is a bit of a freak of nature, because she can do pretty much both things, but she seems more so. But, you know, and then you have like the moda de la torre, and you have like your Jenny and Tenozo's, and then you have like your KZ's, different stylistic choices completely or through them. So it's just a matter of like styles, but it's always interesting to me when I listen to other singers' takes, and then I listen to them speak about it. Yeah. But yeah, that's a bit of fun. I hope you enjoyed. If we look a bit tired, it's because, like we did a black pin concert, and ballast back is fucked, but we had commitments, so we still have to go. Hopefully you enjoy the content that's going to be put up in the future. Oh yeah, look up, look, look out for it. It's going to be really great. If you went to the concert, then you show, we got your videos. Adios. Goodbye.
