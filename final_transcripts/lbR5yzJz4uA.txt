 Girls? Are they ready for planting our garden? So here is Adam, the farmer. I'm just going to get complicated and fun. So it's right up the time. We got rid of one that. We believe it to be the female. But there's another rat in the roof. And less of that is a human rat. I'm just a male rat. So I've shut myself in the guest bedroom. I've opened the loft hatch. And I'm waiting to see if it comes down. But the female rat did. It's very big. It's making a lot of noise. I think it's trying to find its mate. Oh dear. Not good. This is a nice day today. It's sunny. I am Buntag. Mangahigala. Good morning my friends. After a weekend of adventures with the rats, we have a plan in place. Mr Fluffy in the house. Now. It's rumour. You shouldn't actually call these animals by their names. In the house as they come back to take revenge on you. I'm not sure if I believe that exactly. But Mr Fluffy has been renamed. He's now known as Homer. But we have a plan in place. We're looking at all the ways to that. I mean, Homer might get in the house. And also, we're going to go somewhere this afternoon. So I think we'll be doing. Now if you know me, I love cats. I used to have free cats. Leeta, Lily and Suke. And I missed them so much. Never wanted to replace them. Never stopped loving cats though. And Jane likes cats. She's maybe not as mad as I am. She's definitely no cat lady. Maybe I'm a crazy cat man. But I love cats. Always have. And we're going to go somewhere this afternoon. And we'll take you along with us. And we might have a new addition to our family. Someone we can love. Look after. Give a good home. But also, they might help us with our problem with Homer. To get this. I'm not mistaken. That would be rat. All my drop-ins. So we've been trying to find a cat. We had a look through the adoption pages on Facebook. As we want to give a cat a second chance at life. We want to give a cat that's been abandoned. A chance to have a good home with us. But we can love it. Give it all it needs. Hopefully make it happy. My in-bun tag. A Guinness hour. A Guinmiganda. A Sawa. Can I have a must-a-car? Okie-lan. So Jane's ready. So what you're feeling about Homer? I know. You can't call it by what it's called, can you? Because it might hear you and take revenge. Is that true? That I feel like he's a Filipino thing. I think it's a Filipino thing. So we just called that rat Homer. So we may have a home of problem. And I don't think a donut or a duck beer is going to help us here. You might remember from a previous vlog. We bought four pineapples from the plantation in Omaha City. We put them in the water. They've established some boots. And they're ready for planting our garden. Jane, you can barely see Jane. Look at those who's lost in the jungle. So we're off one our way to finally home. Animal sanctuary. So we're here, no? Hello, Turg. Hello. This is our mini shelter. We have 28 dogs, four puppies, one hit and one picked them. Adog, the Bruno and then 45 cats, including the kitten. So we're going to have a look at the kittens. They haven't got any bat yet out. But these three kittens, this one are the clean. These are females. The females? Yeah. They haven't got any bat yet. But I will be warm them before you will pick them up. These are the females. We called him both eye because he only got one eye. This one has still pleased because these are new kittens. They don't know who they are. I'm watching you. I'm showing them the blood because they said they will subscribe. These are the female. This one is male. This one is female. These are the female ones. This one also. The male ones? No. This one is female. This one is female. This one is still feeding bottle. But then I already gave him a Wisconsin one. I gave them so that they will be adapted because the impact of the animal that I rescued is not really good in my health. It's not really good because I need to wake up at 11pm, 2am, 6am, and at 10am just to bottle feed them. If they die because the kittens, new born kittens are so in that of spirit. But then it will make me feel guilty because I cannot take care of them all. I need them to be adopted. You can choose. Do you like them? I can suggest you this and this one. This one is really the sweetest. If I will clean, she will climb here and then she will be cleared like that. You want to play for that? This one is my favorite. Very calm. She is like the biggest sister of this male. That's cute. That's cute. I wish we could. I really want them first but then you can update that they won't after 2 weeks. There are so many kittens here that need homes and we are going to take 2. We will take them all because they run the charity here, they run the rescue and they sell sweet potatoes and support it. They really do need investment and help. So we are going to do what we can to help them. It's sad that there are so many cats that are abandoned. They are so sad that they are abandoned. We are going to work hard to be home as many as we can. We can only take 2 ourselves but we are going to ask a vain and see if we can try to be home as many as possible. It's so hard to choose so I love cats. I will tell you a bit more in a minute why this is so much for me. It's so hard to choose. So I just bought a separate car in Tonguei, they go finally home and rescue shelter in Omox City. I think the name for them is why I need your help for these guys. If you can think what you want us to call the cats, what you think might suit and drop us a comment let us know what you think. They really really love our help so we are going to donate some money to help. I don't think it's normal. Yes it is. So I hope no. With our guests we have our... Hello. Got some news for you. You might not like this. You've got sisters. And they are cats. So I don't think cream shoes are cats. We are going to have to introduce them slowly and carefully but we are back home now with our 2 little girls. They are only a few weeks old. They were abandoned in a dumpster. They will help us with our rat problem. They will hunt but more importantly the smell of the cats will deter the rats. But they are not just here for that reason obviously. We are here for family pets. Part of our family now. We are going to name them. We need your help for this by the way. I am going to go upstairs and have a bit of a clean as well. They were messed but it was ok. Offer good cause. They will help our many girls. We are here for a few days. We are going to have a little bit of a clean as well. We are going to have a little bit of a clean as well. We are going to have a little bit of a clean as well. We are going to have a little bit of a clean as well.

What are their ones here? They are all disinfectï¿½. What are their ones? They are all disinfected and disinfected andtuides. What're their things there? They are all disinfected. How long does it take to get room for this, to get room for this to get room for this, to get room for this offer. I love cats. I used to have cats back in England for very many years. I Really love cats. always there, they show you love, unconditional love. Some people say cats have no personality, it's not true. These cats I had had huge personality and they're always there, I miss them so much. I didn't want to replace them, I didn't want to have anyone cats ever, it's so hard. But living here in the Philippines, we decided that cats would be a good dish into our family as we're missing them but also it will help to keep the vats away. And it's not going to be easy, it's going to be a challenge but then we're always open to challenges. I don't know what we got ourselves into, got two little furry things, is a bed that's playing mummy to the minute moment, it's going to give us some responsibility as she's going to be very responsible for them. It will help her, it will give us something to focus on here. And it is a problem here in the Philippines, there's not many cats and dogs that have been neutered or spayed so you do get a lot of unfortunately unwanted kittens and puppies. It's very sad, we hope it changes, we hope we can help, we did donate some money to stay to help. It's only a small amount, saying it's a start with but hopefully over time things can change. In a post in the video description details of where they can be found. If you're looking for a cat or a dog, please do consider adoption. Without it, a lot of these cats and dogs don't have a chance at life, it's not their fault, they do need good homes.
