 Hello everybody, welcome. Hello, hello. This is going to be our very first reaction video to Filipino singers. We have been asked, oh countless times to react to Filipino singers. We didn't think much of it until we got to the Philippines. Yeah, exactly. You know what happens at 7 a.m. when we step outside the door? Filipino singing. Filipino singing. You can hear karaoke pretty much anywhere anytime of the day, all day. And that is why I'm sure why there's so many amazing singers here in the Filipinos. You start very young, you learn how to sing, you're not afraid to sing, and you get up there and you belch it out. Yeah, unfortunately though, I was raised in Canada. So karaoke is not my thing. Maybe one day. Maybe one day. Maybe one day. You never know. So today we're going to react to this absolutely popular YouTube video, done by Lumuel Lyons official. The link is over there so you can check out their whole channel. But yeah, here we go. Are you excited? I'm excited. I'm really curious. All right. The setup. The setup looks very casual. So just like, what's going on? karaoke. There's beer. There's some tapas. Like, what's going on there? All the essentials for great singing. Yeah, alcohol makes everybody sing really great, right? That yes, and it sounds really great to everybody who's under the influence. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. All right. Here we go. The camera work. 100%. I like it when it's raw like that. That's nice. It's like you're there. Right away. Right away. That was perfect pitch right away. I can't believe it. He's in a bucket hat. Just chill and do. He's like, God, don't worry. She can throw it out there. She can throw it out a little, you know, give you a little sample of the good stuff. Unbelievable. All right. Let's keep going. Yeah. Yeah. She never gone away. It's hard not to sing with him. Well, it's going to last time. You feel the way. Dude is just beside him with his on his phone. Oh, what's that? I was like, he's just on, he's not even looking. He's not used just like, oh my god. I think, I think he's used to great singing. He's probably like, this is just another Tuesday, man. Like, stop showing off. Come on. Can we not just drink some beer for once? Why do you guys have to belt out and like, symphonies, you know? Like, come on. Right. So great. Wow. Wow. Usually when you, that was right, that was so good. The high pitch like that and it's perfect. Yeah, I didn't break. And this isn't a studio. Like, they're literally just hanging out. Looks like in a restaurant or something. Just hanging out. Yeah. Uncarry of key. Wow. Holy, holy, holy. That's just so casual. What if Gave me an open me? Oh, I like his voice. Grasspeed. Look at that soul in that voice. Listen. Okay. Just casual. It's a casual pass over. Each one of them have their own tone, their own sound to the better, all fantastic. Yeah. But they're all, like, it all works. It all works. And then they have the guy in the yellow hat being like the height man. Yeah, exactly. He's actually, at least he's the one like standing there. He's jiving a little bit and he's actually paying attention. Yeah. Meanwhile, everyone's kind of just like. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh, he's going. He's going. Yes. Yes. He's got, he's got the passion. He closed your eyes. It's like you're in a live concert somewhere. Wow. He went really high. He went really high with the other, like, they, like, meshed really well. Okay. I don't know anything about like singing or like, you know, like, the, like, technical aspects of it. You do right. So when you're like, so like, when I'm pointing stuff out, please, I don't know. But he was really good. Yeah. I believe. Able. That's all I got for you. Yes. You're beautiful. Wow. Oh, I got to say that's my favorite voice. Yeah, I like him. Oh, I like him. Oh, okay. Okay. I see that. Look at him go. What's up, Greg? I would want to be eating at this restaurant right now. Free entertainment. I mean, my you look at everybody. They're kind of just like, oh, no, that one guy there. He's really enjoying it. I don't know. He seems like he's like, and the girl in the back, she's like, I think she just looks bored. I think she's just, wow. I wouldn't miss. Obviously not. That was good. That was good. Oh, to maintain control of your voice at that pitch. I just So entertaining, too. I just want to know how many beers deep are in. Right? Because that's great amount. That was really good. That was absolutely amazing. That was really good. But I like, I feel like I've been there and I would have been like, where's my phone and like had the flash. Oh, oh my gosh, yeah. Like the fact that look, the guy in the blue is still on his phone. The whole time he's just been like, yeah, wake that guy up because maybe maybe they're that good. They put him to sleep. I took a lullaby. Casual. Yeah, unbelievable. I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like, I'm going to be like, casual. Yeah, unbelievable. And so this is what I mean. Like Filipinos are absolutely amazing singers. Not going to say every single person all the time. Just the area type to have, I guess. Yeah, I'd write exactly. But that's because so much practice throughout their whole lives. Absolutely amazing. Yeah, remember when we were at the birthday party and they brought out the karaoke machine, you got like 100 pesos if you got 100. Everyone better just hand it out bills like it was. Yeah, yeah, yeah, everybody's getting 100 to 100. Yeah, it was just happening a lot. They were just like, okay, okay, let me like just give me the mic. That's basically how it was. Yeah, and it was so casual. Like, like, you know, if I ever got 100 and karaoke, I'd be like, you recorded that, right? Did you all watch? Like, I would be so happy about that. Meanwhile, it's like getting 100 is like a daily thing. I promise you I will record that guys. It won't be 100. There's the day I get 100. It'll be the day that I become a singer. Maybe I get 100 lights. No, that's not good. That's not. No, I don't want 100 lights because it's hilariously bad. That would be hard. Come on, come on. I don't want that. You sing better than that. Don't worry, don't worry. How would you know? I haven't done the karaoke before. My gosh, my gosh. All right, all right. So that was absolutely amazing. This will be one of many to come. Check these guys out. That was so cool. And thank you for joining us. Wow. Yeah, thank you. That was really cool. I wonder if they've done like other ones. Oh, I'm sure. If they've got like a record deal from that. Or see how it works. I would. Yeah, maybe they write their own songs. That would be really cool. Yeah, it's a challenge. So it's like, might as well not waste it. Yeah, and exactly. Thank you to our members, by the way. We're going to list them after this. We appreciate every one of you.
