 Thank you so much for your time. Shout out. If you say yes, then yes. This is why I missed this country. I just got back 30 minutes ago. I landed. Came here. And I met them immediately. We'll talk in a minute. We're going to finish talking over here. You want to say goodbye? Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. I love it so much. I just landed here. And I can't check into my hotel. So I came to the mall to kill a couple hours. And this is the first piece, some of the first people that I meet. And I know I always say this about Filipinos. But I'm telling you, that doesn't happen. That doesn't happen in other countries. It really doesn't. Hello. Hello. I will come back. Okay. It does look good. That is real. It's alright. Sorry? I would do a pinky swear. I would do a pinky swear. I would do a pinky swear. Do you want to be on the video? Yes, sir. I got it. Alright, I'll do a pinky swear. I don't have to come back. I don't have to come back. It does look good. Thank you. Alright, now I have to go back. There's a place called Hashi. And it does look really good. I got to stay focused. What am I talking about? I've never made a video in this area. BGC usually when I come to Manila, I stay in Pasi. I have this video with the kids playing toonbock. I have this video with the kids playing toonbock. So that's in Pasi. I have a video in Makati. But I've never stayed in BGC. So I decided I would try it out. This is the Venice Canal Mall. This is really nice. I will give it that. But I'm not going to do a whole video on that. But you can apparently ride in a gondola right here. I'm so excited. I'm so happy to be back. Alright. Hello, everyone. I got distracted. This isn't my initial reaction to here. This is the only place I have actually been in BGC before. It is warm. And I love it. I was just snowboarding a few days ago. And it was freezing. Yeah. The good thing about this mall is it's outside. It could be good. It could be bad. If you want to be warm, it's outside. So there's no air conditioning outside. They've got a dog. Hi. Hi. I like that you have a dog. With a diaper too. Let's go see what kind of trouble we can get into in the next hour and a half. While I'm waiting to check in my room. Because I have a shower. I just took three planes from Bulgaria to get here. The last flight was nine hours. The one before that was four hours. The one before that was one hour. Didn't really sleep last night. Very well on that plane either. Juan's bistro. Fun fact, my nickname is Juan Casa. You can get a swan, which is good. Swans are good. Swans are actually quite aggressive. What geese are? Be wary of geese. Don't get too close. These are plastic swans. So you can go indoors. But I want to go outdoors. Because that's what's unique about this one. For those of you who don't know me, I've been living here for six months. And the Philippines. And then I left for a month and a half. Essentially to visit family. But made some pit stops along the way. And it was all very cold. So I'm so happy to be warm again. I might change my mind up here about a day of the heat. But we'll see. All right. I've got one more hour to kill. And since I did make a pinky promise, which is binding. And I am hungry. Have an evening today. Let's go. Right there. Let's go check it out. I think they said it's new. Yeah. Let's do. So let's go give that a shot after that. Then maybe it's time I can go check in. Do you want to say hello on the video? Hello. Welcome to Hashi. What's your name? My name is Ren. Ren? I'm Jonathan. So Jonathan, welcome to Hashi. Hello. Hello. Hello. It's your Jonathan. Thank you. Sorry. You'll be all set. Okay. Thank you. Nice to meet you. And I'll show our better than the beverage. Beverage is our perfect. All right. Thank you very much. I'm going to give you a new hair. Hashi. Okay. So she's... Rice. Green. Green. Green. Green. Green. Green. Green. All right. This one's actually torched. So it's not completely raw like sashimi or a giri. So it's a little bit of a different thing. If you don't like the raw sushi, if you don't like the raw fish, then you can have this. I like raw fish, but I also like cooked fish as well. It looks great. It's giving a shot. First I'll try it without the soy sauce. Mmm. Mmm. Yeah. That's great. Very different flavor. You taste the...what's the word of market for? You taste the torched. And this...you taste the torched. I like it a lot. Cheers. This is a hogard. What's the third? Because you said what? Hogard. Hogard. What is hogard? Hogard like this means... That's a cute fence. Oh, haggard. Haggard. Oh.

Let me try one this way. Oh yeah. That's good lighting. All right. Thank you so much Pikachu. Nice to meet you. this book. Alright see you in Pikachu. Bye. Pikachu just brought so much happiness to me and that little girl. That's the happiest human I've ever seen on earth. That little girl who just got to meet Pikachu. Let me go check in my hotel and we'll say goodbye to the Venice Canal Mall for right now. Do you see why I'm so happy to be back in this country? Hello. Hello. Do you want to be in the vlog? Okay. Shout out. Okay shout out. Shout out. See you. Inga. Sorry? Yeah yeah yeah it's called Travel Escape. I'll show you. Hello. Hello. Hello. Sorry what did you say?

Oh I was in Moa Ball for a few weeks. Moa Ball and Subu City. My own hapon. My own hapon. My own auto. My own auto. Have a nice day. I'm ping. Io Io Inga. You're always going to run into people who speak Bessiah. In Manila it's of course they speak to Gollar but there's a lot of people from Bessiah's regions living in Manila or other places so sometimes so I'll randomly accidentally say a Bessiah word and then they understand it. What was I talking about? Pikachu. All right stay focused. We're talking about Pikachu and people that right there like what you just saw all of that just doesn't just doesn't happen in other countries. Now it's time to check in my hotel. I haven't seen it myself yet either. I think you have access to the facilities of the building which would be a gym and a pool. All right so here's the tour of the room. This is 31 dollars a night and again right across the street from Venice Canal Mall. Got a fridge, microwave, water heater, cuddle, got a hot plate, TV, couch, two beds and here's the bathroom for solo traveler here for a couple nights in this area. It's perfect and I think as I said I think I have access to a pool in a gym. Let's go look at that. Then I'm going to shower and then probably go on an excursion. This could be a journey. This could be an adventure in itself but the staff here so far. Everybody here is so nice. This is the last time I'm going to say this for a while because I know it gets I know it gets old hearing the same thing over and over again from every channel. Filipinos are so nice. Filipinos are so nice. But they are. I don't want to get locked up here. I don't know if that locks or not. I'm scared to touch it. Honestly I'm really bummed that I didn't book this for a week because I've got I've booked a couple nights and then a day later I went back to extend. I changed my mind and wanted it longer and saw it booked up. So you really got to luck out. There's two pools. I just wouldn't saw the other one but I didn't film it because I was chatting with someone but I got access to two pools and the gym all included. Thirty one US dollars a night. It is still the first day back. I had a shower. Feel much better. Here is a market of sorts. I don't know the name of this market but let's go check it out. Let's do it and eat. We have a drink right here. Oh, quail eggs, sir. Oh, I have these. I'm ready to get some quail eggs. I've had this once before and Passai in the video with the kids playing Tombock Preso. We were talking about school until I turned the camera off. I ate some quail eggs there. They're good. I kind of want some more. Are these deep fried? The quail eggs? Yes sir. Yeah? What's that? Fish balls? Squid balls, sir. Squid balls. What did you put on there? So what? So what's on the sauce? So it's an spicy. Okay, spicy, sir. So I'm going to put you in my mouth. So you're going to put it in the sauce. So you're going to put it in the sauce. So do you like three? Just these. I guess these three. Oh, there's four. Oh, there's four. Oh, that's fine. Yeah, just some quail eggs, please. Quail eggs. Macarono? 35,000. Oh, okay. 35 pesos. Anything else? That's all. And where do you want from? You got a steak? I want to know. Yeah, are you from Manila? Yeah. This is quail eggs. Sorry? I guess quail eggs. Quail eggs? Yes. Quail eggs? Yes. Quail eggs? Yes. Quail eggs? Yes. The name is Quail eggs? Yes. Quail eggs. Quail eggs. Quail eggs. Quail eggs. How much does it cost to you like a sweet and spicy egg or a big egg or even mixed in? Let me try a sweet and spicy food. A big egg, spicy food. Yeah. This is a spicy food. Right, more? Maybe that's a big egg. I want to know. Spicy. Do you think it goes? Is it good? Yeah. Do you like this? Yes. Do you like this? Yes. Yes. I like it. Let's do a little bit. Quail eggs. Quail eggs. I need a water as well. We're going to eat these fish balls. I'm going to get a water. Did you say these are called quack quack? I think I've heard something. I don't think it's quack quack but it's something similar. It sounds like that. All right, so you want to get, I've got the mixture of the vinegar sauce and the sweet and sour sauce. I think I had that last time in this other video. Let's try her version of quack quack quail's egg. I guess it's a full quail egg. I'm going to get one at the bottom. Sweet. That's live music that you're hearing right now. I love these. This is heavenly bread at, though. So I love eggs. I eat eggs every day. That's not true. I eat a lot of eggs. This one is soaked in the sauce. I love this. This is one of my favorite street foods. It's heavily breaded on the outside but you can clearly taste the egg on the inside, like a hard boiled quail's egg. It's not spicy spicy. It's got a little kick but it's not too spicy at all. This is great. I'm going to sit down. I had to walk away from the music room because I don't think you can hear me. We're going to park her right here. Let me see if I can crack one open and show you the inside. I mean, you get the gist. It's going to look like a hard boiled egg. There's not much of a point to show you that. This might be my favorite Filipino street food. It's far something that you can easily buy on a street or a stick. You want to get it drenched in that sauce. I almost want to drink the sauce. Get the mix. Get the spicy vinegar with the sweet and sour sauce, with the sweet sauce. Maybe this is the same spicy vinegar that they put on that ballut. Probably. I went back to clarify. I think it's called quick, quick. Not quick, quick. Awesome ending to the perfect first day back in the Philippines. You have no idea how happy I am to be back here. With this energy that I always talk about, the Filipino energy. Plenty more to come. I've already got six months worth of videos here in the Philippines. I'll put a couple of those right here. Thank you for watching and I will see you in the next one.
