 Hi, welcome to a foreigner in the Philippines. I just want you to show the beautiful views here. That's a barangay border, the main border. And this is our place, which is our little paradise. Right? Darling, say something darling. Honey, yes it is, but you're going to have to learn to drive and what you should be doing is looking at my feet and you're not. Hey, no you're not. It's really annoying because it means I'm wasting my time trying to teach you. And if I don't teach you and you can't drive, then you're going to have to walk, which is doing the camera. Are you serious? Walk. Are you serious? Yeah, again, not taking it seriously. I look. Yes, you are. You are making fun of it. It's all a big joke to you. This way, from the from the house, I look at your foot, the gas, which one is which? The brakes is in the center. Oh, that's a good start. The gas is on the left side. And no, not the right side. It's on the right. And what's this thing called here? The what? The steering wheel. The steering wheel. That's not too bad. How many gears are there? Four gear. No, five. Five gear. This is? And what else do you know? First gear, second gear. I love it. It's a second gear. It's a second gear. It happens that every time I drive like yesterday, we like yesterday, I just have a little mistake. And usually, yeah, no, you didn't have a little mistake. You crashed the dead truck. You reversed and you crashed it into the other side into the environment. Because you said, come on, do that. Do that. No, I didn't say stop. No, oh, I have to tell you to say. And then when you said stop, don't I think you should walk. I think you should walk. I think you should walk. I think you should walk. I think it's the same thing. Get out. The last. You're laughing. You're laughing. You see, nothing serious. I think you should walk. And maybe when you walk down, and I'll meet you down, the sick you can. No, this is the way I... No, no, no, no, no, no. This is the way you're going to walk. No, no, no, no, no. When you touch me, I will tell me. You're going to walk. You're going to walk. I'm not just a driver. I'm also a wife. You're going to walk. Are you sure? Go. Go. The one walk. Enjoy it. Listen to the sound of your own footsteps. Bye. I know you're joking. I know I'm not joking. I don't know what you can say. She thinks I'm joking. So it's paper time, okay? I've been... I've... Oh, no. Look what she's done. Look what she's done. You can see in the mirror, yeah? So what we'll do is we will... we'll start and make a thing, but I've forgiven her. But then when she gets here, I'll speed up. Her avenges served cold. I don't know what you can see. Can you sail the back there? Is she coming? Oh, so now we have to go. We're in a sudden we have to go. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. I'll try and hold it a little. I'm going to try it over the hill and then I'll hold it a little. She won't melt the amweight scene for her on the other side. So... Incidentally, she did do the whole joking thing and it made me mad. So I got to say I did get really mad with her because she doesn't take anything seriously. So if she doesn't take anything seriously and she's in a vehicle that could kill somebody, I got to get mad with her sometimes. Let's see what she says down. Ha ha ha ha. She's going to be mad. I'll just do a little bit. Ha ha ha. Stop hitting the truck with your slippers you wally. I'll tell Nana and Nana to video. Isn't it strange? When you pranked me, how is it in a wonderful mood? I thought it was funny but here you are. Yeah but I'll tell you that you're pranking video. At least you didn't try it in my prank video. The next time I do prank videos on you. Now we're finding out who has the good sense of humor and it's not you. Look up my foot. Well don't forget to like, comment, subscribe, revenge is so cool and... No, Marisa. I'm both and now I don't forget to like or... Yeah, don't forget to like, comment and subscribe.
