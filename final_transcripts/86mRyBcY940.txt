 Alright guys, okay today this video, cancel Korea in f*** shut up Alright guys, today I'm reacting to this video cancel Korea movement in the Philippines Well, I've been very curious about this issue but I didn't really care because you know I thought nothing related to Japan but one picture changed my mind completely which is in a short, that picture showing us a tattoo of Japanese flag symbol under thought oh is this something Japan related or some history related and now I'm really curious about this issue and now I want to know this issue more so what's going on exactly or how Japan related well let's see If you enjoy the content give it a thumbs up and consider subscribing if you're here so let's get into it Hey guys, Jessica here this morning I woke up reading a lot of comments, messages, emails, and emails from Korea requesting English to very fairly about this issue that arise from the so Pino Tiktokr Bella Port she's a lot of people she's a team right and that also led to the formation of cash tag cancel Korea in the Philippines asking for apology from Koreans and also I guess to raise awareness towards racial discrimination against the Filipinos When I first heard about this keyword cancel Korea I was like what yeah yeah I know I know it was such an surprising issue word cancel Korea thank you so much to those really aggressive about this issue as well to give you a summary of this issue yeah that's what started from the Filipina Tiktok star Bella Port and the netizens noticed that on her arm there was a that's what I'm talking about that's Japanese flag symbol I hope you guys all know what the rising sun flag is all about and it is especially traumatizing for Koreans because that flag about a few stories during the forceful Japanese occupation here in Korea which lasted for about 35 years so that flag is associated with Japanese imperialism and due to the imperial Japan's mistreatment during that time of occupation the flag can be very offensive for many Koreans that is why we are especially sensitive about this so I took a look into her tattoo if it was really similar to that rising sun flag and I noticed that it really reminded me of that flag no wonder why many Koreans were reacting quite negatively about this I do understand where they're coming from so Bella has made a public I see I think this is a fact Japanese have to know what she said was completely right absolutely right so let me explain about the rising sun flag a bit so that rising sun has a very good meeting for Japanese it's called the kyo kujisuki in Japanese we call something celebrating like waiting is a good example we call it sunny day yeah harinoki in Japanese so in our culture the sun brings us luck as you can imagine our national flag it's it represents the sun so now you know how important the sun is for Japanese but the flag used to be different it was like rising sun like she said why we changed it because people recognize that it is a symbol of impire Japan as you can as you guys know they colorize the many countries of Korea and if it means a one of it so of course people have that image for this rising sun flag especially Korean so this girls behavior you know showing the touch of a symbol of you know Japanese rising sun tattoo it's going to far yeah now I know this went to such a big issue yeah I get it public apology regarding her tattoo she has said that at that time I didn't know the history but when I found out I really had it covered and scheduled for removal I am ashamed of myself for not doing my research I sincerely apologize in addition she said that please educate yourself and learn more about it because it came from a terrible history now it's good yeah she learned the lesson she learned her lesson yeah she was just you know she wasn't really educated so that's why she made a mistake but now she learned her lesson so yeah that's okay great please learn from my mistake oh but the problem started by how some Korean netizens were attacking not only this tiktok or bella but also the full pinos as a whole leaving comments that are basically very offensive revenge and I was also very offended by that so I will read to you guys some of the comments that I saw or a country non-educated people short people the Philippines is like a state no wonder you have no to much that's why your country will stay poor and won't grow stay that way small mine that's why it's getting worse it was getting worse unacceptable it's unacceptable any form of racial discrimination is unacceptable for me and pretty sure with many of you guys as well so about this and to those people who got offended by these comments of some of the netizens I would like to apologize from the bottom of my heart I'm very sorry for you guys I feel uncomfortable because I also grew up in the full pins for around same amount of time that I went in Korea and so I do feel very sorry for you guys I would like to apologize on behalf of those rude Korean participants so this issue will be helpful Korean she's apologizing wow that movement uh hashtag cancel Korea started on Twitter and that hashtag movement only started today but it has garnered over 200 tweets already I could definitely feel the anger of these people so some of the Twitter users are sharing their own experiences about this video from the Koreans so the first tweet starts with the hashtag and it says it was 2018 when I last visited Seoul it was a five day trip and not a single day we didn't encounter a rude Korean every night we went back to the hotel in the way happy there's that little sting in my heart in the heart sometimes I want to go back sometimes I don't next one is I may like your songs or cultures and I even wanted to study in Korea but I love my country I'm going to put my life stick down and proudly raise my flag this is the time when I felt like okay I kind of can see where this is going and I literally stopped myself in the third post I saw which is some Koreans saying that Filipino or ugly but look at these queens do they look ugly I don't think so and they put some pictures yeah yeah some rude people that's what it is yeah this is the time when it gets a bit confusing because the whole point of this movement is to raise awareness about racial discrimination that Koreans or any people shouldn't be racist right but this post some Korean saying that Filipino or ugly well I don't think so I know many good looking for these I don't think reacting to this situation is so easy is effective or is the best thing it's just an extreme way you have expressing and trying to deliver a message next one you could also see can somebody tell me is there a Korean who has crowned as misuniversed this world or misinternational this is off topic it's not very popular I mean the idea of a hashtag movement okay that's like how many things work nowadays but when it becomes like this emotional and just attacking and not really straight on point and it can really just buy more anger well yeah I think it happens a lot you know especially for this kind of conflict between the countries some young guy just get you know very sensitive aggressive you know saying the things that they didn't meant to in mind density world creates nonsense conflict that's all right but they they can't help it because you know they're still you know immature so they they don't make a you know reasonable decision so I think this kind of person has you know who has a very good influence in the world you know apologizing on behalf of the you know country that's very good solution yeah she's very big girl anger many people are also mentioning about the war the Korean war where many Filipinos came to Korea to fight for our side and that is such an honor yeah yeah yeah it's about your tombattle right yeah that was a fantastic contribution wasn't it I also got comments from some of the families of those war veterans and yeah that is the reason why I'm also trying to really see the positive connections between Korean the Philippines instead of you know focusing on the negative it is very saddening how this is really like I said issue that we can never get rid of you know starting from the spark of the coronavirus where a lot of people around the world were being racist to any person that looked Chinese followed by the BLM movement yeah yeah yeah well that was critical issue wasn't it now it doesn't matter because you know virus everywhere in the in the world right man these kind of issue is really an issue and it's very daunting to encounter this but one thing that I would like you guys to know is that please do not judge the whole of Korea by these few netizens that you encountered online yeah yeah yeah yeah netizens they are just saying whatever they want to you know there was from such a people just you know nonsense too bad comments with you know in matureness so guys being mature you know revenge is nonsense just you know shame is shame I really do understand how it feels to be mocked or insulted because of your race or because of your nationality that is why I do understand why these people who are joining this movement seem to be expressing their anger in a very emotional way and seeing that kind of Twitter posts honestly is not that new for me because a few years ago I also uploaded a video titled racism in the Philippines and in that video I shared about some of the discriminational experiences that I got when I was in the Philippines as a young student and the whole point of that video was for me just raising awareness about the issue of racism and reducing it as much as possible and really taking it away in our generation but a lot of my viewers left hateful comments full of anger saying that oh Korea is worse oh you guys Koreans are such a blah blah blah and it was yeah it was very hurtful for me and I and that kind of comments is not new for me because I always get those constantly and I know it's very hard not to make any generalizations from a personal experience that you encountered but that can lead to very very dangerous social issues later on but I know my apology on behalf of those rude Koreans or this video won't calm your anger and the pain that you received but I hope that we could get through this together with a positive and very good as much as possible to really race awareness and to eventually solve the problem all right guys so that would be the end of today's video I hope you guys I hope you guys enjoy it that's what I always say behind you but this video is talking was a rather heavy almost falling love her wow well she's nice is she beautiful good person I don't talk that trying to solve international disputes wow I'm almost being fun of her anyway this issue just that it from a serious thing from you know just educated young people but it's surprising that you know you got to be such a big problem in the end that's surprising and it we should be more careful in this age right that's what I realized from this video well speaking to educated think oh there's a surprising effect for you guys actually we Japanese are really not educated that in a rising sound flag has the bad meaning offensive meaning for foreigners yeah we realize it is when we grow up you know watching some news or you know asking foreigners or you know hearing some impression from foreigners or something but in now school we don't usually if you guys don't believe just ask young Japanese friends your young Japanese friend what's the meaning of the rising sound flag if you have one though they must say like this is just an old Japanese flag what's wrong that's it yeah well there's a reason this is because rising sound flag is just an army's flag it is still now actually it's self defense force now though but they're still using it so some Japanese using it you know shaking the you know rising sound flag with television day or you know Olympics yeah that was that was went to very big issue you know Korean was really offensive about that so yeah that was quite big problem but some people still using that you know because it's cool you know army is using that so it's cool right but this is the fact that I want you guys to understand so we didn't mean to be offensive to foreigners we just didn't know that so yeah I think this video is really good for Japanese to you know love all the history to know about the you know meaning of the rising sound flag yeah this will be a good opportunity for Japanese well that's it for today thank you for watching my video hope you like it do make sure like button and subscribe please so my dowel you
