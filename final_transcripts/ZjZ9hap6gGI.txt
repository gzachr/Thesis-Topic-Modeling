 music These guys, have you got a few hundred thousand? If I'm dying... They come with the icon. If I'm dying for it, I won't like this. Yeah? But I'm sure that I'm in a lot of trouble. Now I'm pretty sure you'll be around longer than I will now. Look, they've even got the icon. Did I say the icon? I did say the icon. Yeah. It's lovely. You can not buy new party. Party party? Cool. You can bring me joke. My mom. Yeah, when you come to see me if I die first, then bring the karaoke, okay? No. Now this is the X-May of Nagasaki. Nagasaki, yeah. One of the nice people, nice man. He was very good. And his wife is the vice president. Vice president. Yeah. He was really well liked by the people. It was a big shock to them because he died in a plane accident. Yeah. And it's really nice what they've done for him here. Yeah. Very nice. And the good thing to him every time there's a penia franchise. Yeah. He always join the procedure. There's no flip-flops. There's no two seats. He joins but he has no flip-flops. Yeah. Procession. I thought it was dead. Before my gun. All right, calm down. Before. He always joined the process. No, she know. I can't even joke with you. Please listen. There's no guard or police. Yeah. All right. It's a simple man. Yeah. I thought it really, really good things about the man. That's why when he died, all the big colonos and all sad because of what happened to him. Mm-hmm. It's a good man. What do you think of the X-Mayer? Yeah. The previous X-Mayer. Yeah, it's all right. You liked him? Yeah. Yeah. He was nice to us when he was very kind. Every time we saw you in the last hour's center. Yeah. He'd always wave, yeah. Look this one. Yeah. I know. What's it called? Mussolini. No, that is one. Spiral. Spiral staircase. That's in case the one's having a look at the view. I know swimming pool. There's a swimming pool. Well, they can have a swim and the swimming pool at night. I'll just sit there with a drink. No, I think obviously all the air can't melt. Don't walk over the graves. Pay what? No. Because it's a bit disrespectful, isn't it? Sorry, we're in the Philippines, I forget. It feels like that. All right. I'm just saying, if somebody sets something to you. The good thing is, in private, there's a clean list that's all public. Yeah, well, that's what we're going to show them. We're going to show them a contrast. I pray, some Paul, if you put a flower, they got somebody's soul. The stale of flowers and the seldom, don't they? Yeah, remember before we found them? Yeah, remember that we were talking to somebody in the cemetery. And there was police there, and I said, why is the police here? He says to stop them stealing the flowers and the candles. It's like a sea. Yeah, because they saw it. I thought it was a Catholic country, and you know, they didn't do that kind of thing. But desperate people, Mal. Desperate people. You remember when my sister Melanie Wedding, not been right before. You may not be married by that time. And you lived your helmet. You remember that? Yeah, we're at the church at the sister's wedding, and it was raining, and we were late. So every time we parked, Edward would say, just leave the helmets there, they'll be all right. I said, no, somebody will steal them. And then I thought, well, we're in a church yard. They're not going to steal helmets, surely. Sure enough, we've come out the gun, the brand new helmets. Yeah. You can't get out of the helmet. You can't get out of the helmet. So nail it down, guys, simple as that. There's no difference in the West. It's beautiful. It's beautiful. It's beautiful. It's kept really nice. They should be very proud. And then, and also, the good thing here also, you can bring like a flow, so you can put on that lock. Yeah. You can sit down. Well, this is where I come for that visual, were you, and sit? Was it here? Was it this church? Well, what? I think, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, with Edward? I think. Well, do you want to debate with me? No. Well, you know you're going to lose, don't you? Yeah. If you try and debate. Yeah, OK. You can debate. OK, I'll debate you. Let's go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So here you are, guys. This is the difference. This is a public step, cemetery. And you can say it's not maintained. Yeah. It's dancing for destiny. Yeah. There's no security on it. It's not maintained. Yeah. The only benefits, so I've been told, is it's cheaper to be buried in a place like this. It's the thing, that when like, I don't know, also today, that's the time. Then they, they get the family. And you can see they've got these in tune and things where they stack them up. And from the information we've been given, now again, it might be different in different parts of the Philippines, but here. And I'm sure I saw something on them in Nagar, in Nagar, in Manila. Most of the family is there. Most of your family. Erm... It's only for five years, like I said before, and then the, uh, remove year. Huh. You gotta be so careful on this road, because I've just run the over. We just had a near miss. It was a bit scary. Car come to overtake me, and it was like an inch off my handlebars, and he's pipping it me like it's my fault. So this is what you've got to be careful of, guys, when you come here, if you're riding a motorbike, if you're driving a car, especially if you're driving a car, it's... It's... Yeah, it's not when you're gonna get hit. Sorry, if you're gonna get hit. It's not... It's not if you're gonna get hit, it's when you're gonna get hit. It's scary to come here. Why are you scared? Like, for example, it's there's about people, you're gonna grab you, there. They're gonna grab you? It's either. Oh, it's the one that grabbed you. Nobody can see you. This is what the public lives. Yeah. Do you want to go better here? Not really, but you see, look, I mean, I'm not afraid to die. I mean, everybody dies when you... Yeah, when your time's up, your time's up. I mean, look at it. And these are the entombments I was on about. Now, after five years, they'll break it all down, take the bones out, and then somebody else will go in it. It's crazy. Because in Manila, the stacked up even higher, you've got to climb. If you want to pay respects, you've got to climb up these to see your family. That looks pretty recent, look, Mal. It's different if you're gonna come back to private. Yeah. So, I mean, it goes without saying private's gonna be better, doesn't it? So, this is what Mal's on about, about people walking around and it's pretty dangerous. Yeah, someone like someone. Yeah. Let's go up now. So, let's go. Because my baby's getting scared. She says I don't want to go in there. It's scared, huh? No. It's daytime. If it were nighttime, maybe so. Because in Manila, people's living in these tomb things. Yeah. Manila. Yeah. So, I've found my parents who like, I know the videos. Yeah, I hope it's been informative. There's not really much more you can know or you need to know. If you're a foreigner and you go private, you put the land in your wives' name, you can be buried with her. Yeah. There's no point in really asking about the public. Because I certainly wouldn't want to be buried here, and I'm sure nobody else would either. So, that's the massive difference between private and public. So, it's over to you, babe, because I don't want to get run over. Please hit the like button and please subscribe and share our videos. And I'll see you guys in the next video. Yeah. See you guys. Bye.
