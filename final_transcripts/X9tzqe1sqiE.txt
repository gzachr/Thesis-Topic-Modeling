I mean I've never seen Philippines from this point I've been to many Philippines many times, but when it comes to this kind of thing, you know that difference between Philippines and You know world I have absolutely no idea. I mean for Japanese we think you know all East Asian countries are really similar We can't really tell the difference between Philippines and the rest of the you know East Asian countries Philippines, you know they have beautiful seas English or you know they have many kind of kinds of cultures. They means itself. So yeah, that's it We're not really queer about this kind of you know topics.

Yeah, this is what Philippines is What if I told you there is a country where over 175 languages are spoken people text more than anywhere else in the world and Boxing fights directly influence crime rate. Oh really it sounds pretty much unbelievable But it's all true in the Philippines 14 there are more than 175 spoken languages. Wow official languages in the Philippines Filipino based on Tagalog and English Filipino is the most commonly spoken in pop culture language and the government of the country uses English in their work By the way, the Philippines are number five on the list of the world's top English speaking populations after US, India, Pakistan and the UK All this sounds pretty plain and ordinary But in fact the diverse linguistic groups living in the country use over 175 languages for their internal communication Since many of them exist only in spoken form. It's impossible to calculate the exact amount I see 13 their capital is the most densely populated city in the world Oh, the nation's capital Monella and its 16 surrounding cities that make up the metro Monella area have a population of 12.8 million people During the daytime this number gets way higher since many people come here to work and while the number doesn't sound that crazy Take note that all these people live and work in an area of 16.56 square miles This makes the population density equal to 111,000 two people per square mile And that's five times higher than in Mumbai or Paris Oh really yeah, that's why yeah, yeah, now I am listening that makes sense total I mean you know traffic jam in Manila especially the metro Monella really heavy Yeah For Filipinos you guys can imagine that but you know for in Japanese most of them cannot expect this you know how Hard how heavy the traffic the traffic jam in Philippine is You know, I usually go to Manila for business. I stay I usually stay in hotel in Manila and And I usually go to you know You know north area like on helles or south area laguna area from the Manila but took me like about Two hours from Manila to Laguna, but you know the distance is not so far, but it takes a lot. It's crazy, right? 12 they have churches in shopping malls Shopping malls aren't merely a place where you buy stuff for Filipinos They are safe air-conditioned community hubs with gyms, health clinics, concert halls, night clubs, parks and even churches inside Yeah, so it's no surprise that they are the favorite place to meet up with friends for so many locals And three of the world's 10 largest shopping malls are located in the Philippines They are mega fashion mall of SM Megamall SM City, Northe dsa and SM, Mall of Asia 11 Filipinos are the number one texting nation in the world I already know Filipinos love meeting up with friends at shopping malls and when they can't see each other in person They text and when they do it they rarely limit it to hey, how are you? In fact, they send about 400 million texts a day and that's around 142 billion texts a year It's more than the US and Europe put together Really? Exactly a little number for a country of 107 million people I would never know about this if I didn't hear this didn't watch this video Wow, I thought Filipinos, you know like speaking better than you know texting but Wow, this is interesting fact 10 they have a unique form of transportation If you visit Manila, you'll notice some interesting looking vehicles called cheapneys Yeah converted US Army jeeps and stayed in the country after World War 2 Filipinos adapted them to transport up to eight passengers who jump on the jeepney going in their direction and ring the bell for it to stop There are about 50,000 jeepneys in Manila and they all look different with basketball stuff There are cartoon characters inspirational quotes neon lights and whatnot on them There are two major problems with these safety concerns and pollution They produce huge amounts of black smoke so yeah, if you want to ride before they get replaced with a rapid transit system Nah Yeah, I think one of the reason why traffic jam is really heavy in Philippines is because of you know Zipney it's really slow and you know stops all the time It cannot be helped for the you know Civilian people living in Philippines, you know they have only Gipney is on the option for their you know commute to the you know school or workplace so it cannot be helped but yeah, this is should be resolved By governmental something in the future I One of the islands has more volcanoes than towns the Philippines are Down the super scenic location Among all the islands that are a part of it Camigain sure stands out with more volcanoes per square mile than any other island The island is 14 miles long and 8.5 miles wide and has seven volcanoes and five towns And even the earthquakes and eruptions shaped it Volcanoes have been deep asleep since the 50s so thousands of tourists can safely visit the island these days Yeah, their national flag has a secret meaning oh National flag of the Philippines has two bands of blue and scarlet and a white triangle in the hoist with a yellow sun and eight race Each of them standing for one province of the country the yellow star stand for the three largest island groups Luzon viseos and mending out what makes the flag really unique is that again? The first to the place state of the middle this happened during the Filipino Revolutionary War of 1898 to 1901 and during World War 2 in 1941 to 1945 Seven boxing directly affects crime rates in the country The Latinos love boxing and are crazy about their most famous boxing manny pakia Whenever he fights the whole country is glued to its TV sets and according to the Philippine National Police BNP crime rates in the country drops significantly when he's in the ring during his 12-round fight against American boxer Floy made with her junior that went from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m Not a single crime was committed in the whole Manila metropolitan really if this is true. This is a really interesting fact For Politan area it was basically the same during other major fights with the participation of the people's champ manny pakia So you guys agree this effect so like doing boxing makes you feel like you want to commit crime or just you know makes you feel like aggressive or something wow if this is true I think you guys should You know stop doing boxing yeah, I know crime rate in Philippines is really high Yeah, this is really Interesting fact six a lot of Filipinos work abroad It might be because of their flexible and reliable character or the fact that they speak great English as a second language But more than 11 million Filipinos work abroad. Yeah, it's around 11% of the population And a quarter of all overseas nurses in the world come from the Philippines Five their rice terraces are the eighth wonder of the world But now a rice terraces are the oldest and more and we're so smartly designed that they still bring a harvest of rice and vegetables Most of which get exported and it is believed if all the terraces have been built into end They would stretch halfway around the world today These places bring the country more money as a tourist destination than rice plantations And thus they play an important role for the economy of the Philippines Four they produce a lot of coconuts Years the Philippines had been the number one producer of coconuts in the world And even though the leadership now belongs to Indonesia 153,532,000 tons per year No, is it? Three the first European to visit the Philippines was Ferdinand Magellan The legendary explorer made the first record of the archipelagio among the Europeans in 1521 He founded the first settlement in Seaboo and thus most of the area became a Spanish colony This explains the fact that around 90% of the population are Christian unlike most of the country's neighbors In 1898 the Philippines went under US rule and later in 1946 became an independent republic Two a Filipino made the first karaoke machine. Oh, if you You could to be kidding me. I thought karaoke was Japanese culture, but wow This is incredible. It's surprising. I'm happy for Japanese. I guess Along you ought to thank Filipinos for your favorite pastime The first karaoke machine in the world was created in 1975 by Roberto Del Rosario He patented as the sing-along system and even though there were some attempts to claim his creation He still remains the only patent holder for the karaoke system What you guys have patents for the karaoke wow did you guys know about this fact? I thought karaoke was absolutely Japanese culture, but yeah, I know karaoke in the Philippines really popular like Japan, but Wow, this is a really interesting fact One the population is extremely good looking a long vanilla for boxing texting and shopping Filipinos are crazy about beauty patches It might be the years of American rule that gave them this love for competitive beauty But the fact remains a fact they have one in all major international pageants 15 times There were four girls crowned Miss Universe one Miss World six title holders of mis-international and four mis-earth grounds The first official magenta was held within the country in 1908 and since 2001 it's not just about beauty But also for the promotion of environmental protection I see yeah for my impression of Filipinos, you know like They exotic really beautiful like a Spanish looking But I think they got their face from you know Spanish blood or American blood So it's kind of mixed you know blood. So I guess their core organization Made that you know they are looking now more beautiful, but yeah, I know of course This is not the only one the reason some girls obsessed with the beauty and making a lot of effort for their beauty And also I know some of god love Korean culture, you know people say korean is the you know what is that like a High sense of beauty country So someone been I following the korean's why and keeping their beauty I guess Would you like to visit the Philippines or maybe you've already been there? Let me know in the comments section Well, that was good video actually. Yeah, most of the things were really surprising for me Especially the boxing matter like I mean boxing could have Effect on you know high-crime ready in the Philippines and that thing. It's really Interesting, but I think this is controversial matter. I mean In other words, it means you know Filipinos who do all the boxing have attendance it make a Commit a crime. This is what it says in other words, right? Yeah, I think this is kind of describing discrimination It says because there is a scientific evidence, but I think for their boxing lovers. I think they feel like insulted. So Should be really containing this kind of YouTube video But I hear you yeah also Japanese who do boxing Usually bad boy because I'm troubled sometimes.
