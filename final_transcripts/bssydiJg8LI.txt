Hardest Tagalog words
One, the first word is
Like this
And it goes like this
Putong hiningka
Yeah, out of breath
Like when I come from Cafe 1919
After eating
Okay, next word is important
Kinakailangan
Kinakailangan
Kinakailangan
Kinakailangan
I noticed a lot of foreigners
They like to say
Not kailangan but kailangan
Because they think that the G
Is like a G in Europe
But it's kailangan
Isn't it? Kailangan
But I noticed a lot of foreigners have that problem
I don't even remember if I had
That problem when I first started speaking Tagalog
Let's see
Kailangan
Kinakailangan
Yes
Komo
Koti
What?
Aina ko
Mahirap
Like one word in a bunch of languages
And then it's like normal and then it goes
Tagalog and it goes like this
Komo kuni ti
Titap
Mahirap yon
Nevermind
Okay
Let's see the next video
So I'm going to make stuff
To pronounce Tagalog words
Bula klak
So both of them are mixed
She is Scottish Filipino and the other guy was
Belgium mixed with Filipina
So what is the first word?
Bula klak
Second one
It's a sentence
Dika panipaniwala
Dika panipaniwala
Dika panipaniwala
Which means like unbelievable
That word
Kumuku
That's the same word again
Kumuku ti
It's actually really hard
Kumuku ti tap
Which is like twinkling stars
I didn't know that
Next word
Lamping
This is you
Pican
No read it
Picon
Picon
She didn't tell what it meant
Ang aarte
Ang aarte mo
An bahay

Like you're wearing clothes for the house
That's nice

Ay nako tangi na
Pinakana ka

Pinakana ka bag
Papapag abag
Dandamin

It simply means the most emotional
Of certain things

That was fast
There's going to be a lot more words in this video edition here
But that's okay
So anyhow
What did you think about
Foreigners speaking Tagalog?
I think I have another video with foreigners speaking Tagalog
I'll try to find it again
And see if we can put it up
Sometimes
If it's in my market
It's really no split
It's embarrassing to speak Tagalog
On the spot
Sometimes a little bit is okay
It's okay
It's okay
If it's in my market
It's okay
I think
It's okay
Maybe
I'll try
If you see me out there somewhere in Manila
Come up to me

At least a little bit
