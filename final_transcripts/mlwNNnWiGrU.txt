 Why am I even doing this? I definitely don't like Bulad, not my thing. But a trip to Lake Met in it and an impulse buy later, we've come full circle. This is the way to do it. Random internet stranger, thank you. Hey, you, see you soon, huh? I need a trip to a new step. Which is a very dark off end. Thank you so much, you're welcome. I'm going to be seeing Matt Guy in Bizzling again, aren't I? Nails and tyres, number one problem here. We're going to go to Bizzling via a few other little places. The quickest Falcon icing in the world is in Bizzling, telling you. So we're going to go there eventually. Fire, I've got a plan. So I'm just taking a detour at the awesomely named Badass. Because I've always been in cheese, I wanted to check out the Lake Met in it. And yesterday, without the camera, I went and I found, there's a hot spring which, of course, went in it. It never clicked there yet. So we're going to go up to really where the source is. There's a volcano, a Hacobalcano. Awesome name for a volcano. My curiosity took me here. 400 metres above sea level, at the hot source of Lake Met in it. I love these random little adventures. I've just driven up the side of a volcano, and back, going all the way back down now, towards Lake Met in it. just driven up the side of a volcano and back going home, back down now towards Lake Metinet. This is the Paco volcano, all of us with Google Maps says. Timberwangaic back, those are what we're going to say. We're going to go down to the shores of Lake Metinet. It's the fourth largest lake in the Philippines, ancient lake, 150 square kilometres, one outblood, about 20 inlets. One of these is from up here. I went there yesterday, there's a hot spring, which of course gives the name to the town of Metinet. The lake itself, I don't know, has 20 sources, is it warm I don't know. It has fish, I know that, that's definitely, I think. Let's go down there, I'm going to stop talking now. Metinet is a small municipality of 28,000 people on the North Bank's, a Blake Metinet. Today was a quiet Sunday. Hello, I'm sat on a park bench on the boulevard of Metinet, which is much smaller than I expected. This town is right on the link. We're right here, Metinet. I don't want the waters hot, because I can't work out. I can go down to it over there, I'm going to find out it's the water hot. This is a peaceful place, and we miss the fiesta bite to raise. So, that's later. These are indeed the world's steepest steps. Quite amazing actually. The quiet steps is Lake Metinet, innit. No, there's kind of a little bit lukewarm here. It's also a very deep lake, so it's like 200 and something meters in places, so it's probably very, very cold there. Lake Metinet is a scam. It's not hot, now I'm going to climb back up here. The evil Camberman. So, having determined the tour Metinet only applies to the nearby spring, we set off around the lake and south. I keep seeing boulevard stalls. I don't like boulevard, but I'm agreeing with myself. I'm saying this to myself now. If I see one more, I'm going there, I'm buying boulevard, and I'm going to just try it. If I see another one. Ah, there's boulevard there! Okay. Feline going, this is packing. 100, he's saying, try go, I'm going to try it in tight. 100 to the pack. Testing for one. Dakan. Oh, go out of the way, who's it? Oh, yeah! Hipon. Hipon, ah, hipon. Hipon, it's a good easy. It's fine, nah. Ready to eat. Ready to eat? It's a good, ready to eat. Ready to eat. Ready to eat. It's a good, can't run. Oh, thank you. No, I smear it, but it's okay. I'll deal with it. I give you the lake meat in it, so I may as well try out the various types of fish that may or may not be from in the lake, but I guess it's from in the lake. I hope it is anyway. I should have asked that, shouldn't I? Maybe doubted vlog. Happy. Ah! That's close. Look at this. There's a car in front that's trying to get through the checkpoint. Why the truck was in the middle of it? That's close. Of course, checkpoints here. They just leave them out. They leave them out on the roads just in case they need to come back and do their thing. That's their thing. But, ah, I've seen this. This has happened to me a few times. There was one checkpoint on a corner. On a curve, and I came into the checkpoint, and then there was a truck in front of me. I went, ah, where do I go? That's life. And we're almost at the coast. This place looks familiar. That's because it is. We're going back. Guess the place. I'm having Biviyani pizza. It's happening. We're going to have a dinner. I have a deep and all day, and I'm having unhealthy food. I need really, really healthy for three days. Two-story. Biviyani pizza. Really unique, but it works. I'm going to have a dinner. I'm going to have a dinner. He's going that way. He's going that way. I'm going this way. He's going to this. Oh, no. I'm not going this way. I'm not going this way. No, no, no. I wonder. I wonder where he went this way. I know, I know. I know. Ah! Well, that failed. It might be laughing every way. Probably, probably. He's just like, ah! That bridge is, ah! Yeah, that bridge is really straight. Oh, well. Overnight in Bizlig. Tomorrow's the big day. We're just going to have to land for the start of that. Let's go to the world's fastest volcanizing. What's fastest volcanizing? But there's other people here, so let's hope. Let's see. That's a big deal. Okay. I'm going to do a good night at Lanseng. I told you you can't keep it. I'm going to do a good night at Lanseng. I told you you can't keep up. Even the camera man can't keep up. It's stuck quick. Go for it. It's a long time. It's a long time. Oh, are you? I literally have a collection of various nails that I found in my tires. Some of them are small. This is one of the bigger ones. Yeah. Even these tires are heavy. I've used them for like 7000 kilometres and that's going to pierce anything. My skin as well. How's everyone? He's at owner. He was so quick that two lug nuts fell in the drain. Hey, can you move on? Keep going. Keep going. What's people doing? The fastest volcanizer in the Philippines. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. Then I went across time to banit and rotate my wheels. Any puppy on out in your... My friends say... I'm going to America. I'm going to America. I'm going to be so mean. Time to go back to that, man. Team. Hey, man. Nice, man. Military checkpoints are so scary. They fist bump you. Do you like dry fish? Why am I even doing this? I definitely don't like all that. Not my thing. Maybe I'm going to convince myself. I don't know what I'm doing to be honest. First thing I'm going to do is to make it a bit more pletable. I'm going to make a little spiced vinegar. I'm going to put just white vinegar. I can't find any interesting vinegar. Onions, garlic, ginger, bell pepper, chilies, and some tomato. I don't know why tomato, but it seemed like a nice idea when I saw tomatoes in my fridge. I probably do it this wrong, but there's no wrong way. There's the thatot way. Wait, I know what YouTube means more of. Slow mo onion cutting. Yeah, I've got to wash my hands after that. I also added some cardamom because I have some cardamom. And I can. Right, vinegar. That's most of the weight. I have this much stuff. That's a lot. That's going to be like the whole bottle. Maybe I should put this first before I put vinegar. There's going to be like this much vinegar and this much other stuff. I'm going to wash that again. I'm just going to say it into my height. That's not actually as bad as I thought it was going to be. That'll boot you. Not me. And there's hardly anything left for anyone who wants normal vinegar. Sorry. I can put it up my house. Sorry, nature's spring. You've been replaced. If I can work out how to get this label off. And that's already getting a bit of colour, which is what I want. Look at that. That's beautiful. I'm going to let this sit for about half an hour. And then I'm actually going to try cooking. I'm impressed with myself. I don't normally make things that good. This is my bag of doom. It didn't stink out my truck. So this stuff, we might be lucky. I'm going to try one of each. And we'll see. Let's see how it goes. I realise I actually have some ready-to-eat stuff as well. My appetizer is ready to eat and wrap. This is how I'm breaking my fast. And always keep on some milk. Actually, that smells pretty good. It's not so bad. I feel like if I dip this in vinegar, it'll be better. I'll try it. It's not so bad, you know. I have a big feeling this might be to do partly from where this came from. Which is late-mouthing, which is a large freshwater lake. Anything. I have no idea what any of this is called. The lady told me that I forgot. I know this is pusset. I'm actually quite excited for the pusset. It has a nice texture to it. It smells pretty good. This one looks like an owl. Just... Do not eat me. Mmm. You look harmless. And that's tiny. You can have tiny. I need a little heatball. I need very posh. I'm Kirk with Olive Oil. This heatball nut. I've got a few of this heatball nut. They were only in the oil like five seconds. I chod them. This is going to be very important to the next five minutes of my life. The snopes get to the things I do. Just test myself. The first one, the small one. I think I've overfired it. I can't taste it. Which is better than tasting what I smell. But... Vinegar makes all the difference. I'm going to save this to last. I'm excited about it. Apple fish. I have no idea what it's really called. Apple fish. Sir, give this a go. Head first. Get the eyeball. That one's got some depth of flavor. That's like a little bit sweet. A little bit salty, but a little bit sweet. I can really taste how it's been salted. But the after effect is actually quite good. I want to eat this every day, unless I was really trying to lose weight. Right, what's this? I don't know. It's the other one. Hello, whiskey. Hello, you want dried fish, don't you? You can have some... Right, you can have this piece. Whiskey. Good boy. You know what's to sit. Right, which one do I just dip in the vinegar? This one. Sit. Sit. Good boy. It's Teddy. You said... Yeah. This one I'm actually really excited for. I've never actually... Oi, you have. I've never actually seen dried squid before. Maybe I'm just not looking and just avoiding it. It's when I see it. I see it in the polenta and I just go... Never mind. You're going to hurt yourself a little, aren't you? I can't describe that flavor. It's unique. I don't know how to describe it. I was looking on the internet about recipes for this. And what I saw suggested I try to do escapecchia. So I prepared some ingredients. This tomatoy sauce will surely improve the palatability of this fish. Excuse me, Teddy. Excuse me. Excuse me. Teddy, come on. Come on. I need to come... No, can I sit here? Okay, can I sit next to you? Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. You said if you jumped down, huh? Come on. I've got a fly, you Teddy. You're going to go down? Huh? Okay, down we go. Down we go. Down, down, down. Good boy. Down we go. Come on. Ah. Daddy's little boy, yeah. Good. From the way he dispatched that, I think it's good. This I think was the fish. It's a pie. He is a piece of fish. I don't know which one. I'm actually really good. The squid is still very rubbery. Very hard to cut. And... Good try. I've found a way that I can enjoy, try fish. Yes, escapacit. This is really the way to do it. This squid is good by the way. Random internet stranger who said escapacit is a good idea. Thank you. It is.
