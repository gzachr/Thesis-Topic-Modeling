That's really scary. Can I give it to you? So, how's the day been going so far? A little chaotic because I got my nails done and I was scared because I thought I was gonna be late. But it worked out fine. So now I'm just chilling. Yeah. Not much longer until you go up? I...it's sort of a poor soul. And that's every performance. Yeah, I think we're the fifth one. So we shall see. I'm not nervous yet. Once I change. And like, because when I walked in I came here by myself, right? And I saw the stage. I was like, oh, oh, oh, no. Now that I'm here, the energy is good. And so I'm just waiting. I'm just waiting. So we'll see. 15 minutes until she comes on. People are starting to arrive. Feeling good now?
