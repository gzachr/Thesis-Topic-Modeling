 I'm excited for this. Whoa! Hi guys! I came to Jolibi for the first time ever. Literally, I passed my Jolibi so many times and I don't know how it tastes. I'm gonna try it. And there's local Jolibi shop in Manila. Thanks to Paola's suggestion, they all have family set combination. It's gonna be very, very classic that everybody knows. Kind of that. Wow! We are waiting for rice. I have no idea what it is all about. Ice cream? I've never seen ice cream in this small container. Wow! Sweet, high-spirger spaghetti. So my expectation about Jolibi is like just a franchise with rice and gravy sauce. I heard about gravy sauce so much. This is gravy probably. And I tried it for shooting. Last time in Korea as well, but I heard that it's kind of different. So I'll just tell you the differences. I just saw the character so many times. I feel so attached to the character. It looks so cute. And everything is like that character. It kind of looks like me when he smiles. Oh! Like... So just because it's gonna melt, I'll try it first. Ice cream first. It's just very classic. Nothing special but very good. Cheesy burger. Cheesy burger. Wow! It looks like Membousha. It looks like Membousha. Or like fried mandu. Fried mandu and Siddita. Oh, wow! It's a jali. Okay. It's sweet. Oh, they don't say? Oh, yes. That's so close. It looks a little different than what I expected. Chicken joli. Wow! Let's start eating. We've been in that team. Maybe because... What? You have to get this food in the door. No. Ah, you always need... Yes, eating it for you. Even for chicken? Yes. Hi, Apple juice. It's actually so different than I expected. Yeah. It's very sour and it tastes very organic. I don't know if it's organic. It tastes really healthy. It's not... Probably not. So the main is chicken. Yeah, chicken. Okay, I'll try to open it first. There's nothing in it. I think it's very good. Okay, I'll try to open it first. There's nothing in it. It's not inside. There's nothing inside. I think I got it from the convenience store. No difference. But I like that it's warm. Regular size, pretty. Easy to eat. The burger was... I wouldn't buy it. Like, I'll just be speaking. Maybe that's the other burger. Other burgers would be nice. Champ J.R. Jinyoung. Champ Jinyoung looks good. The main food is getting liquid. So, the rice is not here. I'll just try this. Actually, if you give me this, I'll probably think it's dumplings. Fried dumplings. Yeah. Come on, go ahead and eat. It's harder than I think. It looks hard. And it's actually really hard. Okay. My peach dumplings. Peach dumplings. Peach dumplings. I'm kind of into seeds. Oh, really? I'm excited for this. Mmm. Whoa. It's just a culture factor. Oh my god. So, the outer part. The outer part is like so food. What's the name of it that you always roll and limpia? Limpia. The outer part is like limpia. But inside, it's like mango plan. Mango, we have only hands. Because first, I'm very expensive. Mangoes are expensive. But it feels like they stopped some hands food instead of mangoshah. Or like fried dumplings or limpia. They made it thick limpia. It's good. Yeah. More burgers. I thought this was the only burger of this rice. No, that's right. Yeah. That's why I got fooled in the convenience store. So, in the convenience store, I literally chose this because I thought it was too much pop. You know, we never sell just love you. But you. I saw this in the convenience store. And I automatically assumed that it's going to be burger or rice. But like rice stopped inside. Like a lot of stuff inside, like tuna, kimchi, or like, you know. But when I opened it, it was just like plain rice. It was so hard to make it. Take the chicken. Oh, it looks so fat. It's so good. It's so fat. The gravy. Here comes the gravy. All right, I'm going to cut chicken. But why only the spoon and fork? It's so fat. But it's too big to. Are you just grab your chicken? 2000 yeet. I got it, I got it. Did they do the gravy sauce? The local authentic gravy sauce. And then rice. Should I eat one bite? Yeah. Okay. This gravy is not cheesy. It's so hard in there. It's like a good guy. It's chicken joint. Mmm. What about the sauce? It's different from that. The gravy is way better than I expected. The chicken itself is so fat and juicy. So it tastes really, really good. Just because I'm Korean, I feel more comfortable with that rice. Chicken and rice still really good. It's really good. Yeah. But only this is kind of salty. That's why everything is a reason. Oh, I like it. Protein, fat, carbs, everything at once. I really love that it's so big. Giant. I'm trying the fries too. It's going to be the same probably. Not here? Very nut spacious. Yeah. Don't eat everything. Oh. That looks very unsavable. Yeah. The fries are just normal. It's like Korean McDonald's. It's not just salty. I thought it was going to be really salty. Okay, I want to try the spaghetti. I should be going to say it right? Yeah. It looks very red. I thought it was spaghetti. I thought it was spaghetti. Hi, Julie Spaghetti. So, by looking at it, it looks very spicy. Like, oh, it's just on. Yeah. I know it's going to be sweet because I have some experiences in Korea. But, if you'll never know. I'm going to try it with Pinoy, hot dog as well. Mmm. Just because of cheese, it's so much thicker than I expected. It's not spicy. No, no, no. But I wish it was spicy. A little cheesier than I expected. Very creamy. Very sweet as I expected. I'll like it without foos. Yeah. Mmm. The hot dog is so soft. I'll just do a back to gravy sauce. gravy. I think I'm getting used to it. It's an interesting taste. But it's actually really good. You have pasos. They have. But do you usually eat pasos on top? They have more. But it's my style. I feel like I'm ruining the style of the Pinoy. The spoon and fork is so small. I can't eat it together. Just pick up the chicken and gravy and rice. Kind of like salty plain. I want some sweet. Yeah. Is it usually like that? Yeah. Spicy chicken is popular too. Oh yeah? Really? Thank you for. I got pasos because... How much is almost like my manager? Passos here. I can't show you because I'm going to spill it chicken. I'll dip it here. Oh, it's so sour. It's hot. But it's really sour. Like, pasos? I think I like gravy better. There's always a reason why you eat like this. I'll try house sauce. That big. I can't hide it. Oh my god. Try me to get some taste. Is it how you do it? Yeah. Oh really? A little bit of pasos and ketchup mixed mix. I've never tried this. Oh, it's really good. But don't they be chicken is so good. Like, the quality is like, it's not as good. I don't know why. I said it's like really classic and basic. But I just keep it. I think I'm going to be finishing this burger. The burger was out and bite. Out and bite. Out and bite. Out and bite. Out and bite. Ah. Eating the new guys. No gravy sauce already. Wow, so filthy, you know. The sugar. The gravy. The sugar. Oh my god. I heard it like, I'll cut it off now. So, I'm going to pour it in. Too much broth for gravy sauce. Yeah, too much love, chili. Love, you're mother. This is literally like, kids would like it. I have a front edge with the gobbia. Wow. This one chicken makes one person really cool. I haven't got a hat. You really want to get one? Yeah, this kind of like, little plate. This is so cute. I feel like I became a baby. In Korea, if you get this, it's probably for kids. Like, little kids. The pepper, pepper, taste is so unique. I love it. I thought it was kind of cheesy and salty, but the pepper makes it very well balanced. Okay guys, so I tried jolly meat for the first time in the Philippines. Is it a post-word? It was a very good experience. However, still like having rice with chicken and burger. And like, this peach mango pie was... What is that? So, if I need to rank them, chicken was definitely my number one. And second was the burger. The burger was out and by it. Out and by it. It has nothing special. What I really liked it. You constantly keep eating. And the third one is fries. Yeah, fries. And the fourth one is spaghetti. The fifth one is the peach mango pie. But gravy sauce was very great. Water right? Everything was very interesting, including this bowl. And this little plastic. I wish it was not plastic, honestly, but yeah. Anyways, that was it. Thanks for watching. Keep watching my next episode. See you guys next time. Bye!
