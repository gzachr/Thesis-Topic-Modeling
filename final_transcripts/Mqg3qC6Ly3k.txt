 Hello and very good morning world. I'm Vanessa. I'm Fernando. Welcome back to our channel. We are having a crossing. If you want to travel the Philippines guys in today's video, we will show you how to get to this beautiful place with just a city hall island, how to get there, and how to travel it on a low budget. Woo! Now so, watching to the end of this video because we have a special surprise for you. We did an amazing collaboration with all the travel vloggers and it's just fantastic. Let's start our day from the beginning. Shall we? I want to go. I want to know. Do you want to follow? No. Do you want to follow? No. Do you want to follow? Maybe. Do you want to follow? Do you want to follow? Do you want to follow? You can't when you want. This is our place for our island. You okay? I'm okay. You can be idle. Good. Good. Harrod. Thank you. Two terms up for you. Was everything amazing? We had a great experience. Let's go to Sikimu. There's something in the air. I can explain it but it's there. Ain't nobody gonna find us in us. As we are ready and steady to go, today for some reason, I don't know what happened, but we are on time. Baby. What's up? We don't know. We didn't arrive there yet. All that we know is we have to go to the Duma Gettipoy, which we can walk from here. The ferry, the slow ferry, they want to take is going to departure at 10.30 a.m. Hopefully. And it's still around two hours to get there. So I have the Montenegro here, Alitha and Cheeping Line. They've arrived at the prices. The difference is like 20.30 pesos. So just come here and see which one suits your time and your prices. And get your ticket. That's the first one. It's 150 pesos. There's low fare. It's 120. And for 30 pesos more, you can get the first ferry. And only going to take one hour. Bye bye Duma Gettipoy. Guys, another reason why I am so excited to go to Sikihua is because it's called Isla de la Fuego. De la Fuego. De la Fuego. And that means basically an English island of the fire. And that's not because it's a volcano island or something like that. It's because it is a mystic, spiritual, which crept island. That was scary. Imagine it's a leap with her every night. So not only does this island has beautiful beaches, it also has a really spiritual connection and we are really excited to see that. I want to go. I want to know. Do you want to follow? Check this water, guys. All this water is so turquoise. That's insane. Hello! Hello everyone! Hello! I'm home! I'm home! Thank you! Buenos días! Buenos días, amigo! Thank you! I'm right. Oh, nice! We have a motorbike. Oh, yes! 350 pesos a day. That's actually pretty cheap. I'm going to the other places. Thank you. Thank you so much. Go,朋友. Let's go. Baby, we want to follow. Come with me. We want to follow. Baby, can't you see that? Guys, we are arriving in our accommodation for the next few days. It's good vibes in here in Sikihor. Let's check it out the room. Vanessa is waiting for me already. I love. Hello, my love. Here. Oh! Ice cold. Hi. Hello, guys. I want to show you around. Oh, my God. Can you guys hear it? Oh. It's 1000 pesos a night. That's our bed. And that's our balcony garden. Look at this. So simple. And this. Oh, my God. We have a hammock here. We're going to sit down here and enjoy a little bit this view and rest a little bit. And then we will take you guys for lunch. I love. You've got me waiting. We're these I love. It looks going. Get some lunch. It looks so hungry. So for another one, I lost my bikini bottom. Yeah, good. No, but you did because you picked the bag. And you didn't pick it properly. You lost my bikini bottom. So now I have to wear this one again and it's still wet. So I have to try it somewhere. Nice lunch for you. It's good. It's amazing. It's amazing. It's amazing. Oh. So, the 500-ton for this amazing lunch was really good. Thank you. Now we're going to have an hammock. We went to bed pretty late yesterday and woke up pretty early this morning. So we're going to go home and have an apiece. Little. Woo! Sunset time! Wow. That's one of my dreams. I never had the opportunity to be dead close to the ocean as I have now. And I'm so grateful. It's more fun here. This is our spot, guys. Two coffees, two cheeses. Growing up in Germany for me, to a really serious country, everyone says, oh, you're German. Oh, okay. So you must be a serious person. And it's just crazy when Fernando and I drive on the scooter through the village this year in the Philippines. And you just see everyone smiling. They don't have the newest phone. They don't have the best shoes. But they're still smiling. They're all laughing. They are smiling from their hearts. And they're happier. Maybe it's not the best phone that makes us happy. Maybe it's freedom. Maybe it is to share the happiness with other people. We also think of two plastic chairs here and we are just the happiest people of the world. Wow, guys. What a sunset. It was so crazy. It wasn't crowded. It was just me and Vanessa. Yeah, on the sea. I want to see you. I want to see you. I want to see you. Just catching some fish. Guys, I think that's it for tonight. We are super tired from all the troubles. Yeah, we're so excited for tomorrow. And we're going to explore a Sikihwari one day. We're just going to be tomorrow. And we're going to do as many sides as we can do it. And as you promised, we promised you guys in the beginning of the video. We're going to share something really cool with you. We have a friend that we met on Facebook and he's also a travel vlogger.
