 Um, the first online date, to the very first meeting. We met 3D streaming platform called Twitch last March of 2021. From that, we started to get to know each other from our night and day talks through FaceTime. And of course, the hour gaming sessions. Both of us, we started to develop love this really special. Which you can say from 8,222 miles away, specifically. And of course, with that, after 16 months of officially being in a long distance relationships together, that's the time we... We love us. Corey, especially, decided to visit me in Philippines last December 21st, 2022. And this is how we met. Update on my life here. Um, made it to Minila's safe. Unfortunately, my bags didn't. So, I guess all I got is my area. Still haven't got to see my girlfriend yet. Don't know where she is. She told me once I leave to go right. I went right. She's nowhere to be found. I don't think I can go any more right than I am right now. No, you go away. No, you go away. I'm so glad that our videos in Minila were all gone because my phone got on. We had some good content. Yeah, we had our first sleeping video. I asked Lady Gard to film me. To film my baby first time. It was so funny. It was so funny. She was laughing on the video too because it lifted me. And when we were like finally seeing each other, it was a funny video. We were into it all. And during the time he had a delayed light too. Like probably a minute. Like an hour. Like an hour. And then after that, he also stopped for a while on the luggage channel because some reason they're lying. Lost his luggage. So, he had a hard time finding it. Waiting for it. I still have my luggage here. It's in like a week now. Still no luggage. Screw you airport. That was a bad experience. After three days, we had a really nice day, Tenerine. We enjoyed it. We went to a casino as well. And the first night what we did is we just chill in our hotel, to try the Lichon Kowali for the first time. I filmed it as well, but I don't got that anymore. It's with the phone. So whoever got my phone, please. Don't be format. Give it back. Our content is there, but it's okay. We have really good memories in the month. And on the second day, we went to McKinley Inn's brand, Tenermole. It was so much fun too. I filmed a lot of videos in there. We had some what we drink. We had some drinks. Yeah, you had a conge. And you got cool drinks, and others, and you were so good. And after that, we went to a casino. I didn't film any things. You can make this video. Well, first we went to the Italian place. And we split a margarita pizza. A 12-inch margarita pizza. You had a mango shake. I drank a glass of red wine. What's good? No. No. But it was, you know, let's try to be authentic Italian. Then, we took a ride on that. It was crazy. It was a crazy time. I was embarrassed because I was about to go to the toilet. Because I really need to pee. It was so traffic and many like, you know guys, it's so traffic. And we're about to go to the studio of Triggas, you know. But I told them I really can take it. Yeah. Very convenient. Halfway through the cab ride, she made a stop. Pay the full cab fare. And then we had to walk and find the nearest bathroom. Just so she could pee. Yes. I was so embarrassed. Only that go have to get another cab for the rest of the way. To the casino. I was dying. I couldn't take it anymore. To like, buy. To your pee. Your pee is so short. I know. I'm the captain of my mother. But you need to control that better. Yes, please. And after that, what? We got some piss because we got to take another cab ride. And they, because it's so traffic, they add like $2 more of the fare because of the traffic. So it might be a ride and see the dreams you're also placed because of... It's been so much money. It's been so much money on the cab. Because of me. And my bladder. Then we get there. Then we get there. We don't know what to do first. We've spent so much. We're looking for blackjack, but the blackjack's getting different. Yeah. When you get to a casino, you don't want to just start betting right away. You want to walk around, you want to get a feel for all the games, get a feel to flow. But it was a great night for the public. It really salvaged everything. Because we ended up winning like $200. $10,000 pesos. Yeah, $11,000 pesos. $11,000 pesos. Oh, so good. My baby got so lucky. I got under Lucky 27. I'm the roulette. It was so fun. I didn't know it was my first time playing roulette. Playing an casino. I got her. She's hoping now. She loves roulette. I want to get... I can't. I'm thinking about it sometimes. I want to teach her more card games and show her all the fun things you can do. Because she's a poker player. Poker Blackjack. Crap. So much fun. It was so lucky. I only got one correct number. My life. But I always thought the... Right. That's why we got the correct number. Our bad ones. How much? We were just put in the 20. Yeah, 20. 25. Was it 25? Almost $40. Each chip was worth 25 at the end. Our biggest win was like 100 bucks. It was so fun. On the third day we went to Mali, with so much walk walking around. There was some... In another building, it's cyberdome, so I wanted to go there. Oh, great. So we want to get the SP card for this camera. Which she gets into. Yeah. So it's good that this one we were able to use this. And now we're official bloggers. Yeah. So this is during the first day in Manila. And Cori's mom gave me a gift, so I opened it. I'm so cute baby. She's so cute. She's so cute. Yeah. I was thinking that'd be perfect for like all your makeup and stuff. Oh yes. She said. Hmm. She said when she saw that she thought okay. So this was during our launch. And we went to a yellow cap. Maybe we're thinking we should be. Thank everyone for watching us. And supporting us. Make sure you subscribe and like if you like what you see. That was nice. That was awesome. Take care.
