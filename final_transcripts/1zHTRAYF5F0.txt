When people go here and they leave this place, they're not going to eat for two days. Because there's so much soup. But I would say that it's not that traditional taste. You know what I mean, Grace? Yeah. This is... It needs to be more... What should I say? More gooey, more thick. So I think for me... We can find a better thing in another face. That's my honest cooking for today. I'm going to have a big bite today. When I eat this, I wonder how it's going to be. I wonder why we don't eat this much. I'm going to eat this. I'll try this. I'll try this. I'll try this. I'll try this. I'll try this. It's good. I only have one place to go. I'll try it. Today, how was your best pick? Best pick. First, Cicci. Second... Cicci? Oh! Third. Oh... Okay. Focat. Third. Okay. Yeah, for me, guys, first is to say it was really good. I didn't expect it to be this kind of taste. It's the mixture of Korean and Filipino. Oh, I see. I don't know if that makes sense, but yeah, it was really good. And the second is Adombo for me. It also has a mixture of Korean and Filipino taste. And the third is Nihagang. For me, Nihagang wasn't that good, being honest. But I think this is okay, but I taste much better in YG. And the Philippines, so yeah. She sings the winner today. I'm going to cook the meat. Okay. I'm going to cook the meat like this. I don't like that kind of meat. Oh, what? Adombo is not that good. Okay. I'm going to cook the meat. It's a mixture of Korean and Filipino taste. Okay. Okay. So, guys, I guess that's it for today's episode. Did you like it? I hope you liked it because we'll... I'm going to come back with another restaurant review. I'm very excited to go around here in Korea and taste all the Filipino restaurants because, you know, it's interesting. And today, I also got to learn that Korean chef who learned how to make Filipino food. Opened the restaurant here and it's been 20 years. And his wife is also Korean.

Look at the heat point. It's just money, Chonan. But how was just the scenicang before Greece? In another restaurant? I can't even remember. Yeah, it was very expensive. I wanted to go to that one a while ago, but it was good for 4. Yeah, wow. And this link is also only money, Chonan.
