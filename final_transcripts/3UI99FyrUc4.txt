You get the application on the screen. It is a very good name. So, if you download the application and ask for the bike, you can go through it quickly. It is a very good place. And for that, we talked about the accommodation. There are many options here. There are many hostels here. This is the main area of Makati. So, I have taken this hostel of the Akrivan North Island. And what is inside this? This is the breakfast being included. And this is the center of the Makati. The nightlife is inside the center. It is a very good hostel. I like it. But I will go ahead and check it out. If I am here, I will go somewhere else. I will go to the hotel. The beach is over there. And the first thing I want to do here is I have a currency exchange. I have a 100,000,000,000,000 money. So, if you exchange currency, you can go to the shop and see that there is a little traffic in the area. So, the best route you get is exchange currency from there. And then I have purchased the same card. Here, the same card is normally available in Akrivan. It is a 100-pays, which is 2 dollars. So, there is no balance in it. The data is available on the internet. So, what I have done is I have put the data in Akrivan. The 5 GB data is also available in Akrivan. The 5 GB data is sold in Akrivan. Basically, after the package is sold, I have 5 GB data. I have used it for 10 days. And I have bought this from Akrivan. And here, I have tried to get a garden in the area. It is a beautiful place. And it is a very convenient place to see the landscape of the village. So, here, the area of the village is very attractive in it. You can visit it. And then, the whole Manila city is there. And there is a lot of tourist attraction. You can visit it one by one. And here, I have come for 10 days. I have come for 10 days. I have a lot of time to explore. And then, I have come for 10 days. And then, the second city of South East Asia, is in the country. This is Thailand, Malaysia. It is called Vagra, Singapore. So, it is very nice. There is a room and one way of flights is very easy. And it also takes less time. But here, the system here is very expensive. Because I have taken flight from Singapore. It was 4 hours of flight. And the thing I have read, I have read it from 40 to 50 rupees. But in the end, it was very expensive in Singapore and in the end, it was very expensive. So, I thought, why not go here? There is a lot of traffic here. And there is a lot of traffic. So, I cannot come here again and again. This is a country where all the cities are located, and you have to take a flight. Because, it is a sea-boost city. And there is a sea-boost. When you cross the road, you will think that this is also a Pakistani system. People who are in Pakistan, they do not think that they are crossing the road. They do not think that they are crossing the road. So, think that if you are not going to cross the road, you will not be able to cross the road. And the road is very unbalanced. The road here is very unstable. People are coming from this. Because this is the two-way city. But, the road is very difficult. You think that it is a two-way road. You think that it is a two-way road. You know, when you cross the streets of every place. So, let's talk about food. There are many Pakistani restaurants here. First, I have told you that there is only one restaurant in the country. But here, you know that there are many restaurants here. And you will get to know the place. So, I will show you now. What happened in the morning? There is also McDonald's in the first-foot. There is also a McDonald's capsule. McDonald's had a dinner there. So, I had a breakfast there. I had a coffee in a burger. And I had a cold drink and chips. So, I had only a bowl of rice. But, here in Pakistan, there is a restaurant. I will go there and eat there. And, I will tell you again. This is the area of Makati. There are many places. You will find out if you are in New York or Jakarta or Bangkok. There are many beautiful buildings and parks. There are nightlife, all the things here are available. There are other things here. People are also good to be very honest. Friendly people. Wow! That's the beauty of this. That stage in Pakistan is great. What a place to be in India.
