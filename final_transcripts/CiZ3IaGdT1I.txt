 It's me, San, Jada! This one, right? This one, right? Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Yay! We're going to have special guests! Wow! I'm going to express... Yay! She's my friend and she has study in the Philippines as well. We got a little bit of a full walk-in, or a walk-in. So she knows about the Philippines so much as well. No no! We've expressed into a study... Isabelle! Isabelle! Yeah! Woo! That was so sweet! Oh? Today, we're going to talk about eight reasons why you should not date with Japanese girls! What? We've got eight reasons. You're on the video Japanese, and today I'm going to tell you about eight reasons why you should not date with Japanese girls! Before watching this video, please subscribe to our channel and follow our Instagram! Let's go! Go! Number one, we don't say honest opinion. In your case, it's different. Maybe, maybe. You always say like, direct opinion. Me is like typical Japanese person. I don't want to say like my feelings. And I think so many Japanese girls also, as me, maybe I say so. But because we are so shy and we want you guys know about our feelings. We don't want to talk you like direct opinion. But in the Philippines, it's totally different. I think I got so many messages and you say so many like your opinions, right? In my case, it's so hesitant. For example, I think we've someone and he said, I want to eat. Actually, I want to eat Filipino food. But maybe he wants to eat yakimi kuu or like barbecue. So I want to say, I want to eat. Oh, I'm like that. I guess girls say, I'm okay. This is not okay. Oh, I'm okay. Because I have something. Yes, I think you talk to you. So, please not. Japanese say, I am okay. It's not okay. Number two, we really care about the time. Oh, yeah. An extra time. But you know, it's a Filipino. I was so shook because if I'm hanging out with friends and it's like we meet at like nine o'clock. But they say, it's on my way. One hour ago, it's on my way. Oh, OMG. Japanese people really care about the time. So we are really punctual everything. If you want to date with Japanese girl, you should really care about the time. Number three, we have Nankage program. You're a friend. You're me too. No, she can speak like Japanese and Chinese and English. I'm still the winner. But her skill is so great because Japanese and Chinese is so native. But the almost Japanese people can speak just what? Just like Japanese. We study English, but teacher Japanese and we have Japanese accent. We don't have enough opportunity to speak English. So we usually use Japanese. Japanese and English are so different. But I know like Filipino people can speak like Tagalog, Suburano, English and so many languages. In our case, we can speak Japanese only maybe. So it's difficult to talk to you guys because you know our language are different. And maybe Japanese people are so shy. So I'm so shy, I can't speak English. So I hope you can speak Japanese. Nasao, we don't reply. I know like Filipino people, they are really like Tagalog. And I was so surprised because you know when I talk to Filipino, Filipino people's reply is so fast. So fast. This is a big culture show. For me, if I have boyfriend, it's okay to talk to the boyfriend like once a week. And the calling is okay. So what's the week? Meeting is what's the week is okay. Friends, yeah! What's your name? Maybe was a day. Was a day? Yeah. Or to my phone. Was a day. Wow! Too much, I think. Filipino people say like, Ah, three times so far. Four times in a day is okay. And it's like, wow! It's like a culture show. Nasao, we don't say I love you so much. So shy, I'm so shy. Our personality is like so shy. So it's hectic to say like, I love you. Even my family, I don't want to say I love you. For me too. Right? Here's my father said to my mother's I love you. Or second, never mind. This is like a huge style. Yes. But I heard so many Filipino people say I love you like, Able to be gay. So much. Yeah! I love this style because I really want to say like, I love you but I'm so shy. Even you know, my father said to me, I love you. I feel like so hot. I just want to say thank you so much. And I should say like, I love you so much. I love you. I love you. Nasao, six. We really love Japanese food. Ah, yes. We are born and raised in Japan. And we really love Japanese food. But if I go to Azatkaki, there are so many American style, Western style. Oh, us Western food is too heavy. That's right. Like hamburger french fries. So I really love rice and miso soup. So sometimes I go to like foreign countries. I feel like I want to eat Japanese food. But for me, I don't know why. When I go to the Philippines, I don't think I want to eat Japanese food. In the Philippines, there are so many rice. And the food are so delicious. So I don't think I want to eat Japanese food. How about you? I went to the Philippines before. I bring so many Japanese food. And because I don't like the Philippines so much, so maybe some time I will be Japanese food with my Japanese friends. I think so. But I like Juri. Yeah! Everything I like Juri. Juri. Yeah, Japanese. Japanese girls like Juri. Two. Number seven. We really like drinking alcohol. Ah, yes! I like alcohol. So many people really like drinking alcohol. So that's why I think in Japan, there are so many kind of alcohol. Yes. I'm so afraid because many people are surprised. Because our drinking alcohol style is too much. What kind of alcohol do you like? The most beer. And sake. And sometimes drink Korean soju. Oh my god! I like it. She is really good at drinking alcohol. I'm so curious. How about drinking the people? Do you guys like drinking alcohol? Please let me know. Number eight. We don't want to make up. You know so shak. We are really like making up. Everybody likes it. And we don't want to people see our normal face. Normal face. Yeah, normal face. Because we are so shy. But I would so surprise because in Japan, some people don't make up. I was like so shy. Because in Japan, all Japanese girls should make up. If I date with boyfriend, and we sleep over, I don't want to make up. Really? I don't want my boyfriend to see my bare face. So that boyfriend can see your bare face? Yes. So please don't see my face. Get up. Number eight. Eight reasons. My youths should not think with Japanese girls. I think there are so many culture differences. Yeah, I think so. And so today's work is the most surprising for you. So please let me know. And thank you so much so much. Together all Sakura. And so happy because we talk about Japanese girls. And so happy right now. And everybody thinks it's okay. We want to go to the Philippines. We're looking for it. Thank you so much for watching.
