 The Philippines, home is some of the most beautiful islands in the world. And some of the most amazing food and culture you'll ever experience. It's also home to the most friendly, humble, Filipino people that live day by day with smile on their faces, regardless of the challenges they may face. As a Filipino American, they grew up in the USA. I wanted to humble myself and experience what life is like living like a Filipino in poverty. The goal is one month living in the Philippines province on a 200-pacel with day budget, which is $4 USD. I must live like a Filipino in experience every day just like my ancestors used to live and still living to this day. So join me on this new journey of becoming a true Filipino, Pyraman. What is up guys? Welcome to day 8 of our 30-day journey of becoming a Filipino. So guys, for today's vlog, it's going to be a day in a life of a foreigner living in a tent. So guys, if you don't know, this right here is my home for 30 days. So as you guys can see, let's go over here and get a good view. I don't think I showed you guys a whole tour of our tent. So that's going to be the start of this vlog. And guys, I haven't showered yet. So I'm going to show you guys how I take a shower here as well. So stay tuned and let's go show you this tent. Pepele, Pepelepo! Pepele. Oh, shoot! Alright guys, so we're finally in the tent. And I'm going to give you guys the official tour of our home for the next 30 days. As you guys can see, we have a nice little couch. This couch can actually be folded as a bed as well. And then over here guys, this is where I do my editing. And you know, this is like a little living room slash office area. We also eat our meals here. We just eat our meals here. So yeah, that's... oh yeah, this tent fits 8 to 12 people. So it's a pretty big tent, to be honest. It does a really good job for us. And walking into this room, this is our bedroom. So we got our bed, we got some essentials, you know, we got some lights. And I like this room because it comes with two pockets. So you can store some stuff. And it also has ventilation. So guys, if you want this tent, it's on Lazada. I believe we paid about 6000 pesos for this. So, so far so good. It's waterproof. It does the job. And you know, I've been living here for a week. And I've had nothing but good... good sleep and a fun time in here. So yeah, guys, that's where we're staying. And today we got some special plan. We're probably going to go to the market. And I think, what do you want to eat today now? Pantset. She's going to, she's been telling me she's going to make her famous pantset. So, let's see how much this pantset usually costs to make it. Or, um, around 100. We can make a pantset, right? 100 pesos? Yeah. Oh, okay. So... If it's just vegetable, no meat there. Yeah, well, it's okay. We're on a diet. We're on a budget. So, yeah, guys, let's go and we'll see you at the market. So, guys, it actually started to drizzle a little. So we're going to put the raincoat on just to be safe. So, the cool thing about this raincoat is this one. It's got like, um, these things that can go on your bike. So, let's go see if it actually works. Ah, just like that. You got a nice little raincoat bike. So, three weeks, uh, you can see the back. I can fit in here. Oh, you're not? Okay. I have to open the anadorit at the gate. Hello. Thank you.

They got some eggs, squash, halva. Yeah, basically they got everything you need. If you want to make Filipino food, but I don't think they have meat here. If you want meat, you have to go to like the meat market. Oh, they got potatoes. I don't know. All this stuff is fresh. I think it comes like every day, too. So, yeah, guys, we're going to see how much everything is. So, what do you all got? This cabbage, carrots. Okay. Just need the smaller one. Yeah, let's go weigh this out, guys. I don't know how much.

So yeah guys. Mmm. The liver is so good. This is also a good tasty punset now. So guys, I want to touch on some of these comments. From my last video. Some of you guys said... Dude, how can you be a foreigner if you are part Filipino? I don't get it. You should be entitled since you are part American. Which part is Filipino in your genes? Your father or your mother? So I'll touch on that real fast. So, dude, how can you be a foreigner if you're part... If you're part Filipino? So guys, I'm half Filipino. I'm half American. So when I say foreigner, I grew up in America. I never grew up in the Philippines and my mom and dad raised me as American. We barely had Filipino culture in my life. So when they decided to move to the Philippines, you got to understand all this stuff was new to me. Like the food, the culture. I was raised in the USA. So this girl right here, she's helping me adapt to the culture. So she's showing me how to be Filipino. So let's get to the second part. It says, what part is Filipino in your genes? Your father or your mother? My dad is American, my mom is Filipino. And it says, it seems like you are not homeless. Are you camping in a private property? So, no, I'm not homeless, guys. So, what I'm doing right now is guys... I have a house in the Philippines. And it's in a nice subdivision. It's got a clubhouse, it's got a swimming pool, it's got a nice area. I eat like an American all the time. So this whole point of me camping in a tent is for me to humble myself. I'm humbling myself because when I'm from the US, always see his nice cars. We see nice cities, we see nice food. But when I came to the Philippines, all I see is, you know, poverty, you know, people struggling. So, as an American, I wanted to see how that felt. I want to see our Filipinos truly happy. Are they a happy culture, even though sometimes you have to struggle. So, I gave myself a 200 peso budget so I can experience living like a Filipino. And guys, I'm as happy as can be. I'm peaceful, I'm eating great food, I'm enjoying it. I'm enjoying the culture, it's amazing to me. And I recommend if you're a foreigner living here, go meet Filipinos. They're the nicest people you can meet. And sometimes you want to humble yourself because you got to get in touch with reality. Sometimes it's not all about nice things. It's all about finding your purpose. And that's what we're doing. So let's go touch on this. Oh, this is... You have a bike, a home, and spending money. Did you have a job or you just have longer traveling with your girlfriend and pet? So, guys, that... My pets... There aren't my real pets, but when we went on this property, this is our sister's home. So, she has area where we can camp. Yes, it's a huge lot. But her sister doesn't live here. She lives in a whole different country. So, it's being occupied by real Filipinos. So, when I came here, I asked them, could I use their property and, you know, experience how to be a Filipino. And that's exactly what it is. But the pets that are living on this property, they are stray dogs. I just take care of them because I like dogs. And another thing is, when I first got here, they were super hungry, super skinny. And, you know, I want to give them food. I want to take care of pets. It's just who I am. Is it American pets or like, a delicacy in the States? So, guys, the memory on the camera actually got full, but to answer the last question, guys, did I have a job? Yes, I had a job back in the US. I saved up all my money. And I came here to experience vlogging and the Philippines. And that's why I'm here right now. Will I go back to the US? Potentially. Will I stay here? Yeah, I probably stay here for maybe, you know, maybe close to another year. And then we'll see how it goes. But, so far, I'm loving the Philippines. I want to stay in the Philippines. And hopefully, you guys, you could just keep joining me on this journey of becoming a, you know, a real Filipino. Because I'm half. So, guys, I appreciate you. Let's take a look at some of the food we have, the pan set and the liver left over. I actually really want to try the pan set with the rice, like she said. She wants to go buy some calamansi, so let's try this pan set with the rice. It's really good, guys. So, yeah, guys, I'm going to show you how to be a Filipino. I hope you guys like this content. I'll be traveling. I'll be doing all, you know, just a lot more stuff in the future. But for now, I'm humbling myself. I'm going to become a Filipino. And I'm enjoying the process. So, appreciate you guys for watching. Like, comment, subscribe. I appreciate all of you guys. Have a blessed day. And I'll see you guys tomorrow on day nine. Peace.
