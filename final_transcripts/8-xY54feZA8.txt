 I like until the people is how they can sing and dance everywhere without thinking what are they singing. It's really amazing. Even secure with the guard singing, cashier singing during the work. People in the lane and supermarket also singing. In my country it's not okay. You should always keep your mansions inside, because people will say that you are sick or crazy if you are singing supermarket. But here is like a diverse situation. Nobody never will think that you are a strange person if you would like to sing during your work time. Everybody can dance, even teachers in school, and it's so amazing. Singing in this and dancing is definitely the way how people express themselves. I love it so much. Number three, what I really love and I'm happy to sing to the pianos is that in all circumstances they are happy and smile. It doesn't matter what happens in their life right now, if somebody needs help, they will help with everything that they can.
