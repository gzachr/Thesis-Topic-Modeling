 But you're Friday. The freshest. Gigi the Lana and the Gigi vibes baby, we're back and we're checking out what we missed. Because obviously the Gigi vibes always gives like a new twist to whatever the cover might be. And this is going to be... It's a hot logo actually. They're cool, it's a tri-ton studios. I actually saw this performance by Sun Smith. The Brayton Awards. Literally like 10 minutes ago. There we go. Turn up. Ooh! It's like Lincoln Park even though it's a picture. Ah! Oh! Ooh, alright! Also they're doing this shit live right there. We are doing this. The cool thing is like I love the upgrade. Can we talk about the studio upgrade? That is freaking fire. That's fire? It looks so good. Also quite weight entry for Gigi. I think she missed it. She missed it. She literally just go back 10 seconds and you'll see that she's like... You see? She did it all. Dang it. Oh, it's fresh as well. Oh, man. Yeah, okay. Here we go. That's good. That is good. It's low, but I think... Ooh, that is good. I think they're giving it an extra dramatic, extra-geno, extra spark. Goals. You're wild. People forget that this is actually their style. Yeah, yeah. This is what the Gigi vibes does. They're taking it to their realm. If you want to cover, they do fantastic jazz. They do great jazz, but the rock stuff that they do... Yeah, they're actually, essentially, they're an alternative rock. Actually, I would say rock pop band. Yeah, but rock, I totally agree. Yeah, and you could argue they do punk as well sometimes if they want to. Yeah, because they are Lannys Morissette, like, effect into a lot of the stuff that they do. Is the heavy-distorted guitars with a really cool, texturized vocals. And she's so... she's so able. If she brings so many textures into the picture. If you listen to the work she's put out with, like, ABS, star music, and, like, her album... Well, yeah, the debut album that they did as Gigi vibes. Like last year? Yeah, the music videos and stuff. This is essentially what they do. This is what they do. Oh, they're so talented. Oh, they're so talented. Oh, they're chemistry. It's also a lot of real stuff. Yeah. Oh, they're chemistry. It's a great idea. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She knows the lyrics. No, she's reading them. She's reading them. I thought she had aä¿—. No, no, no, no, she's reading, she's reading the lyrics. Because they do so many requests in the moment. Like, this is the cool thing about their live streams. live streams that they do a lot of like, live-in requests is literally what's happening in the moment. She has her phone and her iPad, like in a little stand in front of her. The cool thing about this part of the song, because I literally just saw the bridge award performance of this live for the band and it's freaking fantastic. You shout out to Sam Smith, sorry, Sam Smith. Sam Smith from Korea. I don't know, it's because I'm thinking of Kim Petra at the same time, so whatever. The point is that in that part of the song, you kind of have to keep up with the dynamics, because it's like, wrapped, it's like spoken a little bit. So the dynamics are quite demanding in a live music stage, but when you're changing the genre and you're bringing in the rock element to it, you can't utilize the wrap essence of it. You have to like, texturize it. She does such a good job at that without losing its original dynamics either. I've never heard the original. So now I'm in a composition, boy. I think this is like, this is it. Come on, let me know that it's getting back. Everybody's sitting there. The baby I know you've got to come on. And when you need a baby, just stop it. Come on, let me know that it's getting back. Everybody's sitting there. Back, sit. He's sad, bad, but she's sobbing it. She be sobbing it. Yes, she pull it down slowly. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. You just need to sit. I think how we don't know that it's getting on. Everybody's talking. Here we go. We're shopping online. Only don't know how that is getting on. Everybody's talking. And I'm so down. It's freaking cool. So you'll be popping. Here's your boy. Slowly. Now we don't know that it's getting on. Everybody's showing us off the wall. It's a self-proclaimed, self-proclaimed, self-proclaimed. It's not like Paramore sometimes. I think you've got it. Yeah, that's awesome. Yeah. Oh, it's getting on. It's getting on. Yeah. Oh, it's getting on. Everybody's shopping. There's something on. Oh, it's getting on. It's getting on. Oh, it's getting on. Oh, it's getting on. Oh, it's getting on. Oh, it's getting on. Oh, it's getting on. Yeah, this is going really well. I'm sorry. This is what they did. See, see whatever you wanted. But this is what they did. This is it. And I think, again, they're so versatile. Romero in the drums. Oh, yeah, he's freaking cool. Yeah. The thing about him is, again, they've proven to be so versatile with so many different genres. I think they do really good funk. I think they do really good jazz. Yeah, their funk is really good. Their funk is really great. Yeah. But what they excel at, really, like it's my favorite thing they do. I think Gigi as well, she's like, yeah. And that type of letting go and just being taken by the music and Rocky, such a good genre for that, just the quirkiness, the aspect of things. Yeah. She's a proper performer. And also, she's like, she's really pretty and easy to look at. So when she does all her shit, you're just like looking at someone doing what they're best at. Yeah. I'm not surprised. Oh! Can't you guys choice it? It's broken at length? Oh, it's so good. Yeah. I'm so glad they actually did this cover. I think a lot of people forget that this is their realm. Rock is their thing, man. I do wonder what they feel, because what we perceive from an outsider, they could have really good strong, but I wonder what they enjoy doing the most if that makes sense. If you listen to their... It's pop rock. Pop rock. Yeah, they wouldn't go as heavy as that cover, usually. Yeah, that's their bread and butter. So I would be more surprised when they do jazz and funk, because that's further from rock. I feel like they're really good at performing this genre live. When you see Gigi on stage, I saw some videos from Las Vegas for her performance in Las Vegas. Oh my god, she absolutely murdered that stage. And I think what she came alive the most was with the rock essence of the covers that she did. They're no joke, bro. They are. They're really nice. Everyone was telling us, oh my god, you're going to be so impressed. It's like, yeah, yeah. But this is what... This is in their DNA, bro. It's next level.
