 I'm so tired. I'm so tired. I'm so tired. I'm so tired. I'm so tired. I'm so tired. Stop taking on on. Stop shooting because I'm TRIEIED. I'm so tired. Happy Margonneaule come. I'm tired. Where's my photo shoot? You saw the clip you're doing that time and I feel like I wanted to cry because I'm so tired. Okay, you survived. And I still have so many things to do. I'm so full. I'm so full. I'm so full. But I have to bow around because people are counting on me. The morning was quick for us. We're going to the marker again this time. I hope for us it's 7 p.m. this morning. Love small town runs. I'm kind of just going through a couple of back alleys and number other people. I never actually, oh, there you go. I'm gonna explore that much on the American one now in the cemetery. So, yeah, before I might have found this awkward and broiled for a run in the cemetery, a bit tough, realizing the Philippines. There's no such thing as, you know, awkward in the sense as long as you have good intentions and a good attitude. So I've had to find a Philippines in the cemetery before I can end up jogging through the cemetery. No bad vibes whatsoever. Just being healthy, starting the day right. And of course, almost 400 years old when you're running here, all roads lead to the plaza of the incredible church. Well, if you haven't run in the mornings in a small town, you share there's a lot to see. It's just kind of cool to watch. It's different when it's up and starts the day. Little side street pooto and spaghetti shops. You know, people getting ready for tricycles. People making their morning talk like those guys there. It's a cool time to run in the Philippines. And I, who was your own home now, shower, shave, and stuff like that. Okay, I'm really getting used to this now. The e-bike. It's our final few hours to see what America has done. We're just going to pack our things. We're actually popping out of the market since we're going to see what's in the market gaps up in this morning. So off we go to the Palenque to get a snack. It's really hot this morning. Doesn't matter if you've been before or where you go in the Philippines, you must always go to the local Palenque. No matter what, that's a must because you get to see what they have and you never know. Things always change in the Philippines. Back into the Palenque and we're going down I go. I'm really hungry. We haven't eaten anything yet today. Which is why we're going to the Palenque to get some snacks before we head out. Back to Manila. What is that? What is that? Karyoka and Karyoka.

We're trying to flex right now. I think I should. I think that people in Canada don't take photos of food as often as Filipinos. I don't think people around the world take pictures of you. Filipinos take the most photos. Yeah, I agree. Thanks. It's just a picture. Okay, ready? It's about, it's about. Wacky. It's about, it's about. It's about, it's about. It's about, it's about.
