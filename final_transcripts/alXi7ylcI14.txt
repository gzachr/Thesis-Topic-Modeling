We are back with another reaction video today is a very special video because Filipino food is exploding worldwide More and more cities, especially around the US, are discovering Filipino food as the ultimate comfort food. It's what I always say, Filipino food is the ultimate comfort food. What Mike says is Filipinos are the kings of comfort food. And it is so true. Code him on that. Well, today we are watching a video where American kids are trying Filipino food. And I think it's most specifically, is it candy? No, it's just the general food. American kids try food. From around the world, Filipino food. Oh, okay. So in this video, they're going to give the kids different Filipino dishes and their film, the reaction of the kids. We haven't seen it ourselves yet. I have seen it with other cuisines, but not Filipinos cuisines yet. But you kind of know what I mean. I know that theme. I know the theme. But what do you think they're going to get to try? I'm 100% sure it's going to be jolly beast spaghetti. Okay, I think they're definitely going to get a hollow, hollow. Okay, yeah, let's, yeah. And maybe pullover on. Who? I hope they eat pullover on. So the first time when we ate pullover on, we put it in our mouth and then somebody said try to whistle. Try to whistle, yeah, it's kind of like a challenge. It was impossible. It's mission impossible. By the way, if you don't know us, we Mike and Nelly, our main channel is making it happen vlog. We bring a lot of good vibes from the Philippines and around the world.

They definitely check it out. It's me going through the whole process of eating ballads. And then- Like was very diplomatic of saying that I was really badly to eat it. It was so hard for me to eat because I don't like hardboard eggs as it is. The only eggs I like are softboard eggs or salted eggs. That's what I like. But hardboard eggs, not my thing. But I didn't want to be like, ugh, in front of the ballad vendor. Because she's- that's her job. That's her product. So I like, thank you, I did this is so good. But at the same time I was like, mmm. I think you really struggled with the- The beak. And the claws. Yeah, it was hard. It was hard. But what I did enjoy was the soup. Yeah. I had taho, we both had taho. I did a whole breakfast video about like three staple Filipino breakfasts, which will also pop up right here. And- Or actually all of those dishes we've tried before. And we actually love all of those dishes besides the ballads. I haven't tried ballads. I said I'm going to try ballads when we hit one million subscribers. One million subscribers.
