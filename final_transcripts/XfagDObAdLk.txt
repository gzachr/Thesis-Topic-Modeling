 It's gonna be a party in the mouth. Hey! Hey guys, and welcome back to my channel. Today we have a special guest star. I am joined today by my cousin Tahong Lelaki, Kevin! Molleux! And we're gonna be trying a ton of Filipino snacks to set up. Keep inserting, Rind, Tengala Gorgas. Lies! Come on, kid. Let's do it! Wait, this feels a little plain. Yeah, we need to like fancy it up a little bit. I agree. Wow! Much better. I think we gotta like these. Ah, yes, mood lighting. Alright, so we're gonna be rating all of these snacks on a zero to a hundred scale. And these points are gonna be called... Pinoy points! So let's get started. So a few of you guys recommended piottos, and there's a few different kinds. So the first one is sour cream and onion. Cheers. Cheers. Oh, we're really good. Oh, these are nice. They got a good crunch on it. Like, I would eat these all the time. Oh, really good. Wow. This is fun. These are really good. Pinoy points. 94. 94, wow. We're really good. Wow, we're starting off real high with 94. Like, I would eat these all the time. I'm probably so high. I'm not gonna start high. I'm gonna give it a solid 85. 85. Okay. Solid 85. Cause I'm a hundred is like, I'm going to live off of this for the rest of my life. That's how I'm seeing my point. I stand by that. Alright, we're gonna go with 94, and what was yours? 85. Next up is the cheese piottos. This kind of looks like stranger than me. I'm gonna go with 84. I'm gonna go with 94. I'm gonna go with 94 and what was yours? 85. Next up is the cheese piottos. This kind of looks like stranger things. Like, it's very, yeah, it's like a very 80s. Oh, with the neon lights and everything. Oh yeah, 100%. These are the ones that I remember. Cause I remember the blue packaging. Moist, fresh, like some cheesy American snack. Yeah, it's almost like if you took craft macaroni and cheese, put the cheese on a Pringles original potato chip. That's what this tastes like. I don't know if that's a good thing. It's never good until you said that. Well, I mean, you don't have to take my video. Try yours at home. Go to the Philippines store and do a taste test to give your own. Tell me if you think it also tastes like craft macaroni and cheese cheese on a Pringles. It's all I can taste now. Okay, next one. I kind of want to try that. But wait, what's your... Oh, my Pinoy points. Before the craft mac and cheese comment, 85 after 50. No, you're going to go in your own taste. But what do you think? But now that's all I can taste, we'll give it like a 70. 70. Yeah, I'll agree with you. It's a 70. Next up, piados nacho pizza. Who does this like between nachos or people? So what are they together? Or potato chips? They look like Doritos. Right, cheers. Cheers. I can't tell if it's getting to like a spicy flavor and then it just stops. What it says on the back is you'll definitely enjoy the flavor that is distinctly pizza. The tangy tomato sauce and rich nacho cheese. I love it. It's mostly pizza. And then they're like nacho cheese. I want to give that like a 14. Wow. Pinoy points. I give it at least a 20. So the texture, 10 and a 10. Great. It's the indecision with the flavors. Yes, totally the indecision with the flavor. And I can't quite pinpoint what flavor it is. A solid 20. 14 for the indecision. All right. V cut. I've never had V cut. Never had V cut. And when we saw this in the Filipino store, I honestly didn't even know that this existed. I know Jack and Jill. Jack and Jill is a huge snack food brand. I can't say. These are onion and garlic. And it's great because it's a potato wrapped in an onion, like wearing it as a hat and a sash and then juggling garlic. It's going to be a party in the mouth. I do like that these are ridges. Are you going to pick the biggest one? I always go for the big one. I like when you go for the tiny one. What are these? They're like not, you know, we started off really strong. But they're still like pleasant. Nope. You won't like them? They don't prevent it. You definitely taste the onion. I feel like you taste the onion more than the garlic. I feel like it tastes the garlic more than the onion. I taste only onion. Onions? I'm an okay relationship with them. So, I think that's a chip flavor. I got to rate this lower than the nacho pizza. The nacho pizza gave a 20. This is getting like a 10. Oh wow. I did not. I did not. Okay, so you give it a 10. Yeah. And I give it a 70. Yeah. I like that. Next up is chis curls. So, I already like these because I feel like she kind of looks like me. I love cheese. I love cheese. I love cheese. I heart cheese. I heart cheese. It's like the I heart New York, but it's the cheese. Now, these, these I remember in small. These are the cutest things ever. They're like little rainbow. I'm dying. They're tiny versions of cheese curls. These taste like mac and cheese. But it's so cute. I'm okay with it. Yeah. You know what's even cuter? The girl's name on the back. It says, Hi, I'm Kirlette. Kirlette. And this is my cheese world. Kirlette. This is my cheese world. Want to pick some cheese flowers or cheese cheese butterflies? I'm sure whatever we do with Jack and Jill cheese curls, we're going to have a cheesy great time. Like, how many cheese buns do we get? Cheese butterflies. Cheese flowers. Not very creative, man. Cheese bench. Look at that. One thing is, the flavor isn't overwhelming in each little bit, which is great because then you can have a bunch of them. Like, I could eat this whole thing and not be overwhelmed by how cheesy it is, or am I eating too much cheese. How much cheese is too much cheese? No, it's no such thing. Any amount of cheese is too much cheese. Yeah, you're lactose intolerant. So maybe, what? No, it's fine. Okay. Real cheese. This is my cheese world. Ah, my cheesy girl. And a cheesy world. That's her song. I give that 90. Ooh. Wow. It's just so cute. I'm going to give this another solid 85. All right. Next up, chippy. These look like fritos. Yep. Oh, yeah. These are legit fritos. They're a little more peppery, I feel like than fritos. But I'll get sweet. I think that comes from the barbecue. Yeah, usually I don't like barbecue, but these don't taste so barbecue-y that I don't like them. They're not like how Lays champs and all of them have barbecue, and it's like, mischeeed barbecue. This is like Filipino-banished barbecue. I was a little worried about these. Really? What? I don't know. Sometimes I don't like barbecue flavor. You're right. I was worried about these two, because any barbecue flavor is like chips or even like on meat or ice cream. Yeah. Continue. Or an ice cream. I'm like not a fan of. But these are nice and like light barbecue. A lot of these chips do the really savory ones, but definitely a beer companion. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I have some extra points for being a barbecue flavor I can actually enjoy. So I'm going to say 72 in my points. I'd give this 80. They'll not the highest, but surprisingly that I can definitely eat a ton of these. I feel like that's just what you say about each of these chips. Yeah. All right. We have. Mr. Chips. Is this curlette's boyfriend? Or husband or partner or whatever. Yeah, yeah. And then their kid is chippy. Cause he kind of looked like chippy. Yeah. I'm kind of boring. Yeah. So they didn't even taste like natural. Yeah. My Pinot points, I think I would raise them if I had a beer with these. Because they're like light enough that if you have kind of a stronger beer, but I think on their own, I think they need a beer. But by themselves, curlette, you probably could do better. Don't settle, girl. Don't settle. Get yourself a piato. I'm going to give it a 50 Pinot points because it's so middle. Hey, I agree. I give it a solid fifth. This is the middle ground. Yeah, it's like middle ground. This is the middle ground. Roller coasters. I'm a fan. Our friends are a fan. It's just a solid good time. They're good. They say they like, um, skateboard wheels. Bugles. No, no, you can't do witch fingers. What's the perfect ratio of cheese and piato? I think I've accidentally gone through like a whole bag without realizing it. And I've just been like, oh, that's the bottom of that. Oh. And the circular shape gives it a nice crunch. You need to like this. You get like several crunch. You need to like this. You get like a different kind of. I'm sorry, you need like this. It's a little dangerous. Why would you, you don't like that? Why do you need anything, anything, anything other than that? There's going to be my highest for the 95. I'm going to give it a 94. Just because I think that's what I gave to piatos. Roll the kosher, you're at the top of the hill. The clover loot bag. Let's start with the barbecue. Now, the fun parts about these chips are, they're kind of like scoops. They feel like shrimp crackers because they're the like fluffy. They have a nice barbecue flavor, but it is a little bit more on the skeet side for me. Yeah. Ah, it's a little bit more peppery. I like wouldn't reach for them, but I can see how they would be popular. Okay. Next, the ham and cheese. Oh, you can smell these. They smell like ham. And tastes like ham. That was the face I was waiting for. I tasted it first of it. Wow, that literally tastes like a slice of ham. But this literally is like a slow roasted ham. Yeah. Like a honey roasted ham that you would have on like a holiday. Yeah. That smell and taste is exactly what you taste from the ship. Can I attend for representation? Like if you like ham. Yeah. What's up? Chili and cheese. Oh, these are really good. Oh, these are good. These are what you crave. Like when you land in an airport and you're just like getting something. Like if you have a drive after landing the airport, it's like an oddly specific time. And it really does taste like chili. Like it has that chili aspect to it. Like eating like chili in the sense of like soup chili. Like the stew chili. It gets that spiciness. And then the cheeseiness is great. These are really good. All right. So you can keep going on that one. This is cheese the day. Cheese the day. This is the original. This is like what you would eat. Have you been swimming all day? Like in the ocean. You have your mom brings you out of towel. Out of snack. Like this is that snack. These like kind of feel like a warm hug. Yeah. I think it's because it's a solid chip with a nice cheese. It's not overpowering. It's not like eating Cheetos or those are like super cheesy. And then when you have a bunch, yeah, your mouth gets that awkward cheesy artificial mouth. This one. No. Now shrimp barbecue. It feels like the flavor starts off as nothing. And then you look big. Yeah. Yeah. You start eating it. And there's like is there shrimp? Oh, yeah. That's shrimp. And you do not like shrimp or any kind of seafood. You're not going to enjoy any of the shrimp flavors. Starting off from the ham and cheese. What do you give that? It's so hammy. It's accurate representation. But like I wouldn't eat them very often. So like a 37. What would you give it? 35. Barbecue. No points. I give that one actually a 65. Yeah, I don't remember it already. So 65. Thanks for the coffee. And then going down the list, we have the shrimp barbecue. It was very shrimpy. And like I don't know if I would have it. So 37. 45. All right, chili cheese. 95. It's so good. It is. So I'm going to give it a 90. So that this is just jumping ahead. So that the cheese easier. You can get a 95. Cheeses and 83. Yeah. We can send it. Jesus with 80 for me. Sorry. Shrimp chips. So these are actually Japanese. However, these shrimp chips are huge in the Philippines. Cheers. I like these because they have the french fry look to it. See, I think these are less of a shrimp taste because you have that like nice fluffy texture. It's kind of like, it is like a french fry, but if a french fry was a chip. Yeah. And like, it's a nice like the shrimp flavor doesn't just like pop out. It just kind of like sits with you. These are the chips that would always be in my parents' house and that I'd always have. And there is that story that I fell down the stairs and didn't cry because I hurt myself. I cried because all my shrimp chips were on the floor. So shrimp chips. I fell down the stairs for you. I give this. I give this in 83. I give this a solid 90. So picnic, which is made in the Philippines, somehow I ate growing up in the US. And we would have them like with ketchup, like actual french fries. Oh yeah. I do like these because they leave this skin if you have the little matches and everything like that. Yeah, and you can see like, little rings of the like potatoes. Potato eyes, the eyes. You call the eyes? Yeah. Look at that. Fun fact. So like a 95. Wow. 90. Again, solid. I would eat this all the time. And I love the container. Pringles. Make a container of this bag. Well, if you see my hand, I can get in there. Come on. Do you think they'd be good at a picnic? No. They'd, why would they ever be? All right, folks, for those of you that have been following along at home, you'll know exactly who's won. But for everyone else, the time has come for the final results. First up, with Kevin's scores. Coming in second is a tie with both shrimp chips and picnic scoring a solid 90 Pinoy points. And in first, with 95 Pinoy points, can you guess it? It is also a tie. With rollercoaster and Clover chili cheese coming in at a solid 95. And now, for Marissa. Coming in second with 94 Pinoy points is also a tie with rollercoasters and piottos, sour cream and onion. Because apparently we only like to use like four numbers for scoring, that means you guessed it. Coming in first is also a tie with 95 Pinoy points for a Clover cheeseier and picnic. Let us know what your Pinoy points would have been for the chips. Maybe we'll use more numbers the next time around. No promises though. All right, that is going to be it for the chip portion of today. We've got too many things, so we're going to have to do the sweets in another video. So if you want to see that, don't forget to hit that notification bell so you'll be alerted the next time I post a video. Thank you to my wonderful guapo, Cousin Da Hong La Lache, Kevin. Thank you guys so much for watching and I'll see you in the next video. Bye! I'm losing my mind. I think it's over here this f***ing thing. Oh, Kevin. Kevin! I couldn't even rip off my tongue. Magonza! Magonza! What the heck? All right. I don't know what to do with my hands. It's just a little... Okay, so I ordered four different I love cheese shirts. They didn't come in time for the video because I wanted to surprise Kevin and dress like was it cheese debt, clodde, clod cheese, but they just came in and so I'm going to pull it on and surprise him and see what he thinks. I feel like this is the one that looks most like her, but I feel like this one is just the cutest with the little cheese. I don't know where to put the camera. Kevin? Yeah. Can you come here for a second? I would like her let. Oh my God, you actually buy that t-shirt. What did you buy that t-shirt? That's amazing.
