 Hey guys, I think traveler here. What is this divine or the film? Oh my god guys, we're finally here. Let's leave. I don't want to hear you. BGC sucks. It's breakfast time in BGC baby. Breakfast in BGC. What? Is this just like Dubai? This mall up here looks pretty sick. Just kind of like the entrance. Okay, so some of the places we've seen from breakfast, according to a website. No nose. They got chicken and waffle. Randy's donuts, yes, is over here. Pancake house is over here. Hello. How are you? Good work. There's a fracking of Randy's right there. That's not quite the same donut size as the Randy's back in LA. Already Philippines, you're lacking on the Randy's donut thing. If you watch the Randy's donut vlog in LA on our journey to the Philippines, you will see that you will have seen the donut side. Very large. Look at the uptown mall, that's so fancy. Very fancy. Look at this whole street, it's very fancy. Very fancy. Thank you very much, Philippines. Dang, this place is pretty snazzy. Pretty snazzy. It would be very similar to Dubai, but it has a lot more trees. Dubai has no trees, really. Well, Randy's donuts has an outside shop and an inside shop. That's fancy, Randy. Thank you, Randy. Very happy. How could a Randy afford? And... Did we just meet Randy? Randy? All right, you can meet Randy right now. We met Randy. This is the title. Big ounce dies. Randy's is pretty popular. Oh look at their point, Iron Man beat on the Randy's donut. Really? Huh. Parade seems to be so active and looking at all those empty parts over there. Very... Oh, I see all day breakfast right there. Yeah, we're looking for breakfast right now. We just happen to be looking for breakfast. Oh look at all the colorful. What is here? Wow. The uptown mall. Wow, very, very fancy. This is quite fancy. We're looking for the cheesecake housey. The cheesecake housey. I wish. The pancake house. We can go to the pancake house where we can go to no-nose, which has waffles and chicken. Both of them are on the list. I feel like no-nose was on two different lists. So we gotta go to no-nose then? No-nose. But we have also seen pancake house. Have unlimited pancakes. I don't think they do any more, which is very sad for pancake house. It would be nice if they had unlimited pancakes just fill ourselves up. I then feel absolutely terrible. Yeah, that would be great right now to start the day. No-nose, chicken and waffles. Never had it. Never had it either. It's a nice southern staple. There's some comment that always says, close us, boys from the south. We are definitely not from the south. It's pretty, I... If you are from the south, it's pretty easy to tell that we're not from the south, by the way. Oh, wait a second. Is, uh... Hey guys, uh... Let's just put it in our bag here real quick. Oh yeah, you betcha. And, uh... Yeah, very northern accent we have. There's a terrible tragedy going on here. All of the waffles are non-available. Stop, crack. Not available. Not available. Bings, please. Non-nose or no-nose? You're gonna be good. No-nose for me. Zero out of ten. Thank you very much. It's kind of their call to fame, it seems like it's bit. It's on their front picture. BGC, starting off a real bad. I like it better in Qui-Gon city. Qui-Gon never disappointed us. Never, we never were like, come on, Qui-Gon. The whole plan was to get breakfast in BGC, but we are getting early lunch in BGC. New title of the video, breakfast in BGC, in parentheses, gone overall. Non-nose, so disappointing. We're getting half of the chicken in waffles. Only the chicken. Mine comes on dinner rolls, so... You might not have to do it. So that means it's the same as waffles, just not waffles. It's BGC. Gone right. Let's go to Randy's for dessert. Teraffle cream cheese, wantons with honey. Our appetizer here. It's gonna be sweet, but it also like and smell the truffle from here. Is it gonna be Philippines truffle? Where a commenter said it's super strong because they're... They got the MSG in there and make it extra truffle. Oh, I tune my taste buds to the MSG right now. Ready? They're ready. Now, I love cream cheese wantons. They're one of my favorite things ever. I guess smell the truffle. It smells like... It's just very truffle. It's not gonna fit off. Okay. It kind of reminds me of the Korean hot dog we got with sugar on it, where it's like sugary on the outside and sweet. And on the inside, it's more of like the cheese. It's very similar to that, just in a different fashion. It's pretty good. I can consider myself a cream cheese wanton connoisseur, of course. Because they're the best things top in the world. Here we go. That is interesting. The truffle isn't really... I really taste it. I feel like I smell it more than I tasted. Yeah, you don't really smell it more than they. Like, it's not even there at that strong. We hit the honey sweetness on the outside. It's like a cream cheese. It kind of just ends up tasting with the saltiness. And the sweetness cannot go in together. It just kind of ends up tasting like a normal cream cheese wanton. They're honey, they're cheesy and crunchy. But those cause you want more than your little basket of fun. Ah, waffles. Just get them. Yeah, I'm not even eating anymore. Honestly, we'll just eat them to that dog over there. But we cut and don't know because of waffle shortages. There's a waffle drop in BGC. Oh my God. We're gonna start a go-bunney to help feed the waffle drop here. It's really serious, is it you? Is this the Philippines or California drought? Philippines. What's up with your awesome for appetizers, dudes? Always do evens. So then do biscuit boys can split it? Yeah, always even. Come on. Whoa, I got a mango strawberry smoothie. And it's literally strawberry rainbow. Are you gonna mix it or you're gonna keep it so you start with the mango and then end with the strawberry? Well, I could get two smoothies and one. Plastic straws, no no. What the f***? That's a big no-no for me. We're just gonna trash no no's because they have no waffles. I mean, it's possibly the worst event that's ever happened on this YouTube channel. I think so. Where did I get the last mango shake? Where have I got the mango shake last? It tastes good. I think I got that. Where are you gonna taste the mango first? There you go. Mango-y, taste the strawberry. Strawberry? Is it gonna be strawberry? Strawberry? Well, wait. It's full to mix with me. It didn't mix very well. I like the strawberry one more than I think. Oh, really? It's more sweet. Dang. Tyler throwing out a shot here. Started all the mango lovers. I don't know. Is there like a gang of different fruits? The American being the strawberry gang? I'd hoped of, but you never know. What's the strawberry sign? It kinda looks like a heart. It's a gang's. Oh man, that's so... I had chicken sliders and it's a surprise, but it came with chips. Are they also running up chips? They're out of waffles and they're out of chips. And all their resources or fries. And all their resources, apparently. No, no, just not doing duos. You know, those were tasty. Maybe these chips? They all... They're just all thong. They're not the amount of gravy we got on there. Nice go. The chicken has good flavor. Okay. The chicken has good flavor. Look at the crispy on it up there. Yeah, I mean, you got corn. I got duplacorners. Oh, you're just gonna eat it like a real man. That's how many chicken. The brain on it is pretty good. They just gave you a square waffle. Square waffle. Do you think that? Well? Do you think that's a whale waffle? No, actually, I just think it's a good bread. Harder than I expected. You just scored it all. Initial rating of your meal? 7.2. Oh, baby. What's your original rating? Oh, 6.5. Oh, maybe. Let's see what it is after we eat it. Well, that was no-no. I mean, the chicken was pretty good. It's just important they didn't have anything. It would have worked so well with the waffles, I think. And it was like, they were like stickers on the menu. It wasn't just like, oh, today we don't have it. It looked like they haven't had it for a while. It looked like they were struggling. So I don't know what's going on with no nose, but half their menu did not exist. Literally, every single one of their main courses was not available. And they didn't have fries. They only had chips. Potato chips. But the chicken was pretty good. So, I mean, half of the thing they advertised chicken and waffles was good. So, does that only warrant them a 50% or 5 out of 10? I think so. Starbucks? Miranda's goes hard with the donut size. There's still much, I got the same smores one in the L.A. The original location. And it was not that big. Miranda's just like baked signifies it's from Miranda's. We need to get a box so we don't get the Randi's donut box. We can't go into an elevator and go, RANDY! We should have the Randi's donut? Iron Man was in that. How did they fit it there? Iron Man's smaller on screen than he is in real life. Yes, or this when he goes to the Philippines, he just gets taller. He was in the Philippines? Yeah, I mean, the donuts right here. When they went to kill Thanos? Yeah, he did. Let's see how Randi's is in the Philippines. They're going to be very intrigued by the size discrepancy of our donuts. And keep in mind these were only 15 pesos apart. So I should have just gone to one of the other. Oh my god! Ready to do this? Wow! Look at that, for our first. Very epic. Oh wow, very sprinkly. Is this a cake donut? What sprinkles? Wow! Whoa! Is it taste like something you can get from covers? Yes! Wow! Try to eat it all in one bite. My stony style. Oh! It's like there was so much effort, then it's like the size of one bite. Oh! I feel like you always, you never regret doing my stony every time you do it. Never once in my life have I regretted doing that. It doesn't fill my mouth and then I have to sit there and chew, chow down. Mastony a long job? I'll get an actual taste first. Really soft. Look, the laser's nice on there? Oh no. I expect you to get that whole set of, it really hurts the jello. Yeah, I like the taste of just the bread. Or even with the glaze in the bread around it. The bread is so soft and fluffy, it's really tasty. I put a good randy. Yeah, this one they have some icing right under the sprinkles, so it adds a lot of sweetness. So it is, I guess, a little better than one you can get at co-verns. Well that's randies, let's go walk around BGC and see where we can find. Randy? Well that was randies. And now we're in the uptown mall, our can. Uptown, oncua. Uptown, funky love. Uptown, funky love. Alright, now let's do a flash mob of uptown, funky love. Up and thing at the same time we got this. I'm down to car on apartment 8th. Are we gonna get all of the great name stores like Straight Forward? I mean it's a pretty straight forward name. That's true. Nature Republic, partial, what cold? They really have some great brand names. Is that a store? Coco. I got milk tea there once. Alright, well the uptown mall is very similar to the other malls, it's just tighter. And a little less busy. True, it is less busy. You have to, less people go to the upclass. Morning guys, uptown mall. Where you can shop with itsy? At the finish. And the stray kids. Wow, very epic. There's a lot of them. There is, they take up a lot more. They build more. And these two guys. Nice job guys. That's pretty fancy. Uptown mall grocery store update. They have bowling crisps and cinnamon toast churros. This might be one of my favorite cereals. These are good. These and honey spacks taste exactly the same and they're both delicious. They have honey comb. I love honey comb. And most importantly, they have choco balls. I feel like exactly like that dinosaur. Thank you. It's crazy, this place feels like it's like own downtown of its own city. It has a downtown feel. But it's just BGC. It's not even downtown Manil. Which is actually crazy. Sure, Manil will even have a different feel to it. Definitely. This is really, really interesting. It kind of reminds me of like a downtown, like a midwestern downtown. Yeah, I can see many ablos compared to it. Yeah, it's pretty similar. Like the amount of skyscrapers are not as tall. But the size feels the same. There's a lot more people on bikes here. Yeah, there's a lot more bikes. That also gives it the downtown feel. It's the bikes. I even saw a few people on the scooters. They have more cars. Like the whole make cars. Not mopeds and bikes and stuff makes it feel a lot different too. It makes it feel a lot more like an American downtown city. Which is very interesting. We've been in Klaigon City for the last month. And this is a very, very, very different feel. It's interesting to me that this is 20 minutes away from where we are. 30 minutes away. It is pretty cool. I mean, some of the taxi drive on the way here too. We saw some really interesting looking places that I wanted to go walk around. It gave me like what I would think like Bangkok or Chinese, big Chinese cities like downtown would be like. And I saw those and I was like, oh, I want to go walk around this area. But the city is just so big. It's really big. It's so much harder to just walk. Like we can in a European city. Like people easy, we'd walk just the whole city. But here. It was a nice temperature there too. It was. It's really hot. We could walk. We do walk. But walking in 10 miles in a day, we're going to literally be drenched. Especially when it's sunny out. When it's sunny, we also burn. Sock reveal. It's good little boy football pitch. Brof. Oh, he would play British. Oh, we've British, brof. We've played British. Hello, Governor. Oh, yeah, bro. Should we get to find a British man and go up to him and see? Hello, Governor. I think this is a good British accent. It's a very good bull. I think this guy can just keep going now. They do. It's a really, really big. It does the other area kind of reminded me of me. I mean, we're saying maybe this will be more like Singapore-esque, maybe. But it really looks American right here. Like really, really does. It does. It does. We were mocking all the like, whoa, water fillings, but this does really look like a marinated area. But they do deserve to be mocked. Is this Italy or the Philippines? Oh, we're going there. I think it's different. It's the skyscraper architecture. I feel like a little more boxy or like the way the things come off. Yeah, yeah. Slightly newer buildings than a lot of the US cities. Yes. More of the Asian twang. Pretty cool. Oh, look at that. That armor vehicle. You should try to break into it. Let's find out. What's in so long? So this is right around the high street area. I don't know exactly where it is, but a lot of the places around this area claim to be high street. Nice. So. That's all. Quite the building. Oh. That is some nice balconies for only these rooms right here. The other ones, for you. You don't get any balconies. Frank, you. I'll see if you're good to the environment or not. Good job, buddy. We're just kind of walking the streets getting the feel of this place. Well, there's the Shangri-La through the head. Oh, very tall. That's like the man's heel kind of like thing. Is it jungle themed on the inside? It better be a collidered ambies. Well, monkeys steal your drops. They will. And then you have to shoot them to get it back. And then sometimes it will change into a hurt bottle. Oh, that's pretty epic. It's a very hard map. I don't like it very much. The Shangri-La. Very tall. One of the tallest buildings in this whole fracking place. Hey, let's make it into a fancy hotel. Should we stay there tonight? There's a shaky's right there. I haven't heard of that place. Shaky's that doesn't have shakes. We were trying to go to Shaky's like two nights ago. And it said milkshakes on the window. And then we got there and they were like, sorry, we don't have any milkshakes. We don't have milkshakes at Shaky's. What the frack, Shaky's? We're really having a rough time with things with restaurants here being out of food. What's the deal with that? We went to the frazzled cooking. They didn't have milkshakes either. Come on, Klaigon. Not epic. Klaigon, N. I don't know another name for Bonafocio. Bonanasio. Bonafocio. Bonafocio. That's definitely going to translate to the Philippines audience. I'm sure. But yeah, I mean pretty much first impressions of this place so far. The malls are slightly fancier. The streets are definitely fancier. There's lots of people walking the street. A lot of people walking. A lot more cars. There's a lot of restaurants. A lot of seemingly high-end stores. And a lot more foreigners indeed. A lot more compared to Klaigon city. There's so much more. So we fit in a little or we don't stick out as much as it gets. Very true. Okay. BGC. Is that Lalisa? Lalisa. Lalisa. Lalisa. Lalisa. Lalisa. You guys probably can't see her. Zoom in on Lalisa. I ride. Me ride. Wow. Lalisa. Is this San Francisco or the Philippines? Oh my gosh. What the heck? Have you ever seen anything like this? Is this better than anything you can get in the U.S.? Literally. I literally watched a vlog before this. This is the most insane, amazing thing I've ever seen in my entire existence of my wife. They go hollow. And that's like their intro's always do. Guy, you are not going to believe this place. Look at the most modern place ever. Holy nuts. Hey, that actually does remind you of Minneapolis right there. Oh my gosh. Except here, it's because it's hot. And Minneapolis, it's because it's cold. They're basically those are like, they connect like most buildings around Minneapolis. Isn't that fancy? They have a fourth street here, a fourth avenue. Who do they have those in the U.S.? It's so hot. Oh man, there's not a crosswalk on this one. We're going to fracking die. Not modern anymore. Not modern. They don't care about safety here. Come on, quiet. Oh no, come on BGC. Not epic. Come on. Going to Fauci. What is this? There's a lot of exhaust coming out of that building right there. Is this the Shangri-la? The Shangri-la is just pumping pollution. Boycott Shangri-la for pumping pollution. Shangri-la bad. We're going to take down Shangri-la. If it's the last fracking thing we do. This architecture on these ones looks more like the Dubai one. Yeah, it really does. They're just taking it from everywhere. They're like, oh, this is cool. Ooh. Like the Dubai one. They don't have the beige and then they have those like blue glass windows like that one does. So, and then a lot of them over here are more like a slightly Asian American building. Then these glass ones, when you walk through these glass areas and the trees on the street, it's very many Apple or very Midwestern downtown which is quite separate this. They don't have this in Midwest. No, they're a bit too tropical. Dang, Nabbit. Oh, you know what I mean? They have a KFC here. So modern. So modern. Okay, one bad thing about this place. The crosswalks take for fracking. Okay. Thirty-seven, thirty-six. Even though it looks like we can just go on that one. We do have to get to this side. Please don't kill us, my arm and serves. We just broke the law in BGC. We're hitting executed BG. What? Does this make it go faster? Wait, wait! I didn't improve the tough. Every time you click it, it should make one second go down. Sure. Alright, let's go. And then you only get 15 seconds. This is so... This is not pedestrian friendly. I feel like the cars and the drivers are discriminated against us. I think they are. That's not very epic. Not epic BGC. Alright, how do we get into this place? There's nobody in there at all. It is very clean here. It is. I mean, pretty bad city is also actually pretty clean. Yeah, they actually clean the streets. There's just like some areas where there's like just a pile of garbage. I think that's just because that's worth it. The garbage is really nice they can go. But I mean, oh wow, the pink color. Oh, is this Milan or the Philippines? Oh! Milan's one of the cleanest cities I've ever seen. It is so clean. That like shopping area by the Duomo is literally... It's very bright at every night. That's pretty nuts. The mind museum? Wow, very epic. This Jolaby had an amusement park connected to it? We went to the most modern Jolaby in the world. Is everything in this video? Modern? Anytime anything that we make with the tone is a joke by the way. You can place this mockery on any of your favorite travel vloggers. Including us too. Including us? Oh no. Will I limbo? Oh, I thought it was gonna latch on and hook you up. I don't have a flexible enough bag. Is this the mind museum? What do you guys do with the mind museum? I don't know. It's gonna blow your mind. Let's see what this is. The mind museum seems to be for children based on all the pictures of children on the advertisement. Although we may act like children. It'll be weird. Yeah, for the big boys there, a giant children with all the little children. We are giant children. Very sad. Into the forest right here. This is called Instagram Forest. We're all... The Instagram girls take their pictures. My gosh, was there a giant children here? Is it leading to the mind museum? We go to the dinosaur in the pool. Are you freaking kidding me? The most modern dinosaur? That's the title of this video now. Very epic. Wolfgang, I'm a day as a Mozart. That's the one day out there that was super adventure. It's a very packed. They're making their money. Oh, look at this guy. Oh. He's got an M16. He's fully loaded. What is this supposed to be? I like his boots. His boots are very realistic. They do. Good job on the boots thing. The gun looks really realistic too. Looks like it has poor stuff or a real gun. He might have. He's very chrome like. He could be in the terminator. Oh my gosh, he does look like a terminator guy. Very epic. Let's continue. I see what Lisa did. What Lisa? Bonobon? Oh my gosh. Oh, there's a dog going to cart. Well, I think we're saying that everyone here dresses a lot for a repier. So, it's very reminiscent to the type of people we would find in the Dubai Marina. So, once again, in the Dubai Marina. Which we did not particularly connect with when we were there. No, we had a much more... I feel like we had a much more adventurous time in India than the Dubai Marina. Very true. That's the type of traveling we enjoy. Most of the memories were made in the Marina. Not the Marina, but the India. Yes, true. Lisa Bonobon? Wow. The alley by Vikings. Oh, Frank, a new Viking music. I'm hungry. Hey, they got these all over the place too. I'm fighting back home. We tried to get... We're looking at one of these in Milan. And it was so expensive. It was absurd. You could literally take up a taxi and you'd only try to little more. It's kind of crazy. Oh, there's a bunch of pots over here. I love pots. Welcome to pots. Very nice. Generation Z Park, baby. I want those. Everybody there makes TikToks and thirst trap videos. Oh, yeah. There's a nice area here if you'd like to sit. Oh, look at them. They're very nice sitting here. There's a snake underneath there. It's definitely hot out today. There's a nice breeze, but wow. This place is really popular. That way it's hot out here. Chiwami Ramen. I think everyone's here for the Hokkaido milk ice cream. Oh, there's another Korean barbecue place right there. If you couldn't get enough, there's just one on every corner. Every fracking corner. That's crazy. I guess that makes sense. Why? When we were in Dubai, every person in the Korean barbecue place was Filipino. Very true. They really love it. It's not as cool as pop street. Pop street would have been way cool. What if we went on to pop street and it was just filled with pop. Then we could be like, oh, hey, we're on a little puppy. And then we could pet them all. How do you know there's a milk bar right there? What's up with Japanese milk? I've never heard of it in my life. And I just saw two places praising Japanese milk. Those dang Japanese cows. What kind of cows do they have? I think. Dang. Very unfortunate for all the other cows. Never going to live up to that hype. Japanese cows are racist to other cows. Wait, wait, really? Is this confirmed? It is confirmed. I am a cow. Show me your otters right now. Yeah, Fridays. Is this a five star TGI Fridays? Let's remake that video. Let's do it. Oh, the top just ends. No. Ty, oh, you're only time zone, baby. Let's go. Wait, time zone. Time zone. Time zone. You have a time zone in Cardi. I know it. Ty, let's go. No, just kidding. Bottomless mojitos. Bottomless mojitos. You're not going to time. For a cue. I want bottomless mojitos. What? 18 and love for all. Does it mean something different? Where is Josh's abs? I tell Accord this is when it's on a T-line. Yeah, apparently you're like 64. I'm 64 now. Wow, I think credible. You're a sixth. Wait, you're 5-11. No. Is it a tiger? Oh, yeah. Fire tiger. Oh, they started. I voted the tigers of mouth. That's amazing. Let's get a tiger drink. There's a crispy cream. They have the conveyor belt. But it's not like in the US, the conveyor belt always moves. You're serving it for eight? Oh, yeah. This is the lightest one. Ah. No, it's like the US. That's a big one. Whoa. It's like the US. They have that in the US. Where they give out one freak lays donut. There's the lights on. It's very cool. Bench Cafe. They have a restaurant food. I don't know. You can eat benches. You can. Walker. Oh, somebody said vlogger. That is us. We are vloggers. Chef, I feel like we're out of our element here. We're just like walking through a mall. Everything is just pointing out different brands. Wow, wow. Tempor. Wow. Well, we've seen where the others end the burgers. Seriously? So basically this area is just a nice green area that nobody likes to walk in. It's too friggin hot in the sun. And then a bunch of shops. It's like a mall, but it's outside. It would be cool when all those light TV lit up. Oh, it would be cool. And our GoPro would look terrible. So, it's very interesting. Very touristy. Very, very. Very, very touristy area. It literally feels like we are. I don't know. I like that area in San Francisco. Where we got the crepes. The... I don't remember the name of the little city. Me neither. There's some city in San Francisco where they shut down. They street around dinner time and then all the shops bring out the tables. And that was both. Oh, hands of Lambert. And a stormtrooper. Oh, that's creepy. That's very creepy. How are you? Well, we kind of watched the high street area. Oh, what the building. How much like some of the things that go over there? Are we about to get on Lombardi Street? Oh, oh, oh. Yeah, that is interesting. It kind of looks like something you seem like Hawaii, too. Is this Hawaii or the building? Oh, my gosh. Oh, what? We didn't make it. Now we're going to burn. Now we have to wait 58 seconds. We're going to burn. Oh, burning. Oh, it hurts. Oh, look at Bonifacio High Street. Very cool. That's where we just were, guys. Thank you very much for your cooperation. Look at it. It's got purple, red, and yellow. Well, we're about to go into a new area of BVC. We just did our first impressions. Uptown, high street. And we're about to head into the market market and the SM Aurora. And we figured we stopped the video here. The video is in two hours long because we still have two more malls. The memorial area. There's a park down there. There's food for us to eat. Lots more food. And of course, the Venice Mall. Is this Italy or the food? Yeah, as much as we like joke about areas of this, it is a really cool area. It is cool. It's not our area. But it's definitely a cool area. It's very touristy. And you don't like to get into the nitty gritty of a new city and a new country. Maybe this is the place for you. There's a lot of food and shopping. That's probably all it is. It's pretty much like a fancier version of any other touristy area in any other country. Yeah, very true. Especially like developing countries like the Philippines, where modernization has been happening the last 10-20 years. So it's more like pocketed, like all the sudden displaced. It's like crazy modern than this place. Yeah, it's like one of the most modern places. Like in the world you can get. Like a Dubai or a Singapore just right in the middle of a massive city that's been around for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years. But it's pretty cool. But not our cup of tea generally. We'll be heading out to the provinces and getting into nature here in the next few months. Hopefully when the dry season starts to roll. Yeah. Because that'll be a good time. But I'm sure we'll be back in BGC if there's stuff we miss. If there's good restaurants that we have to go to here. The little restaurants have some big lines on here. We might be back for the little restaurant. Let us know down in the comments. We got a lot of Manila to explore. And a lot of like Luzon just in general to explore. Because we'll probably, that's probably the area that we'll be going in the next two months. And then dry season is when we'll get out to the really nature stuff. So we can actually have a decent weather as we go. Yeah. And you guys don't get to see the behind the scenes of how many days we wake up and we have a plan to go somewhere and then we're like, Oh, it's raining. We won't go here. We get our pockets like today. It's beautiful. And then we go to BGC. And look at how beautiful it is. It's really hot though. It's hot for us, biscuit boys. We'll see you in the next video. Hopefully you enjoyed the water. The water.
