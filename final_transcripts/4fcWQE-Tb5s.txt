It's no different for a fellow painter than it is for anybody in the UK or any of these other Western countries. Any woman will assess the suitability of a man as a husband based on more than just do they feel dizzy every time they look at him. They'll expect that he can support them and their children in times of need as well as they are in times of luxury. So they'll expect that wherever they are and that's part of the makeup of a woman as she's looking for an ideal partner and the ideal partner must be able to support them in reasonable comfort. And once you have that then a Filipina is, I think it's fair to say, is probably much more likely to be faithful and loving and caring about you. I did read the results of a poll that was taken of various people. It was found that Filipina couples, Filipina to Filipino actually were very, very caring about each other. So you come in as a foreigner and you go right into that as your luxuries. So no, you can't come an own land but you can come and you can live here and rent a nice apartment for not very much money. And then you can look around for someone that you can live the rest of your life with and probably you will be very successful in a relatively short time. And then you can go through all the steps that we just said. What? You finished? It's took so long. What should I advise you? You already advised? You're not allowed to. You know? Well, I'm sorry. Did I take it all? Just a little and give me some. Okay, you can have the rest. See what I have. You know, so my advice to you, sir. You know, my advice to you is, you know, what's my advice? I can only think I said it all day. My advice to you is come and visit the Philippines. Don't buy or purchase any property, you know, besides you cannot purchase yet. No, but there are ways around. Yeah, there's a ways because there are others. There are others. Another one is circumcising the law of that kind. Why you laugh? There are other do that circumcising the law. Honey, you're not circumcising the law, okay? You're circumcising the law. You're not circumcising the law. What could be worse than the circumcised law? Go on. So, circumventing the law, but it's not right. You know, but my advice to you, sir, clearly, professional and very, very, very serious, okay? Visit the Philippines, tour the 7,000 island. You know, go to Manila, go to Bahu. All of them of course. You know, no, no, but go to Manila, go to Bahu, go to North, go to South, going to other places. Menda now, but Menda now are safe, okay? There are just some parts of Menda now that are better than to go for your more safety, right? Go to some parts of Menda now that are safe, go to Daba, go to Bahu, go to Maggatay, or other parts, other parts that you think find and choose it. Choose it where should I, where should I, uh, retard? Where should I feel that I'm comfortable and I can work with it? You know, the environment I could accept it because I like to, I like going in the beach and this is a good area for me, right? No need to rush, no need to rush to get a property, get a, build some farms or whatever you want to do on your property, don't rush it. You know, because selling property also, for example, you sell, you, for example, you buy a property and then you're gonna dispose it. You know, it's, it's also difficult, it's also a long process. I love the paper. Yeah, a lot of paper works to do. It's better to be, uh, to be careful, better to be established in that area, if that's your final destination in that area. And at the same time, when you find a girlfriend, don't find a girlfriend just because you want to own land. Find a girlfriend, you know, because it's not bias. It's not good on the side of the girlfriend because the girlfriend says, I love you so much, I love you so much. But then in your mind, you're gonna say, yes, I love you because I use you to be the owner of my land, you know, not right? Right? So in other words, when you find a girlfriend, find a girlfriend that you love and at the same time, you know, the girlfriend that you could be possibly lead into a marriage. Yeah, you need, you know, you need to know a little bit about the culture so that you can find out how you are going to navigate the various cross-cultural problems. But that's a whole other... Yeah, there's a whole other scenario. But that's our advisor, come and base it on the Philippines and understand the culture, understand roaming around different places and having a house and friends. You know, the Philippines are very friendly and they will help you. What do you want to learn? You know, there's no need to rush on making, because on making some decisions when it's coming here, because you are in a foreign country. And if, and let's assume that everything goes wonderfully, you find you're happy ever after, lady, and you're coming, you have children. One word of advice, as we've now seen about words and the English language, make sure that if you have boys and you are of that persuasion that at a certain age they will be taken in and have their bits and pieces shorten the little, make sure that the surgeon knows the difference between the word circumvent and circumcise. And on that note, we would say, thanks for being with us. Don't forget to like, comment, and subscribe. Not circumcise. Yeah, simply like comment, then subscribe. Thank you so much, surgeon. I'm not the intelligent one here. She's intelligent enough because I don't know the Vesayan word for either circumcision or circumvention. Who's the intelligent one? Don't listen to him, but listen to my advice also, you know because my advice is from my little heart and my little mind. Right? Yes, still.
