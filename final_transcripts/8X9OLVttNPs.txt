 Foriner shocked by Foriner in the Philippines. You didn't expect this. I'm going to try once you let me. Yeah, better, fiddle, get inside. You know, you know, maybe things are going to be alright. Cause I just want to see the fly. Nice little reflection on the water there. I'm going to open an aga from Calbioc City. Good morning. I've never actually tammed by it here by the river in the day either. Last night it was beautiful just up there. I had barbecue this morning. It's refreshing. The weather's looking good. And something's happening guys. 10.30 pm last night, Commander Dot messaged me, hey, I think you're an hero seen in Beekle. I saw somebody posted you. I'm actually here at Sabar. And then I messaged Kumar. And he told me that they're in G1 right now. I'm planning on driving across Sabar through Takloban to southern lady to the port that would take them across to Mindanao. If I leave and I, you know, drive it a pretty solid pace, I think I could actually surprise Commander Dot out. And it just blows his mind a bit. So that's the mission today. Drive across Sabar, maybe across Lately. And see if I can surprise my British friend here in Visayas. Good morning again. Mo Pena Aga. Let's go. I don't want to run. I don't want to run.
