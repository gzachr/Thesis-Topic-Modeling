 I'm Flying Kill and I am the Filipino Christmas Walker. Let's roll! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! What is up ladies and gentlemen? It's Flying Kill here and I am in the nila baby! I just arrived. I'm staying here in this beautiful luxurious penthouse suite. I'll show you in just a moment what it looks like. We're going all out this trip people. I am about to head over to the victory liner here in Monella in Pasay because today, day one of the Filipino Christmas series, we are going to go to Pampanga because Pampanga is the Christmas capital of the Philippines people and the Philippines is known to have the best Christmas in the entire world. What is in store for us? I'm going to definitely do Simbang Gabi and today we're going to head over and see the giant lantern festival which is super famous as well. So without further ado, let me show you this beautiful mansion of mine. Check it out! Here's the door. It's where you come in. So this right here is the top bunk bed but I'm not sharing the room with anybody so I just used it to like store all my stuff like my Elmo underwear and my bags. This is a little desk area. I've been doing some work over here. This is the bed, but I was just leaping. This is luxury living. The only thing I don't like about it is that there are no windows so I don't get any daylight and I kind of lose track of time being here. But it's super cheap, only 400 pesos a night and I needed to save some money because we are going crazy for Christmas people. We're going crazy. I'm flying kill and I am the Filipino Christmas vlogger. Let's roll! We're riding our learn. Check it out, man. Thank you. I will see you at the Christmas party, yeah? Bye!
