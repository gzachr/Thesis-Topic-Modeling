 It's been clean ladies gentlemen. She's worried much worried against you only has so many dresses for the uh return of the thing. Good afternoon 26 October 322. It's not by this afternoon so I'll give it a little bit more progress for the fellas to go get to. We just came by a couple of hardware stores had to pick up some light receptacles and four pen lights. It looks like the window for this bedroom went in here looks like. Yeah and the other one as well so we'll get a closer look from the inside there. Oh screen doors up. Is it the wood panel? No no where's the wood panel? You need to call it right away supposed to be a wood panel there. Look on the inside. Well yeah call them out of way. Need the wood panel. Here's the varnish door. I think it goes good with the color that's out of the house. Yeah we wanted a wood panel that was almost this color here. On the bottom part down here here. I believe it's both sides that's what we saw in there. So we got to go and mind them. These windows haven't been put in yet because we got to get the cement frame on the outside to go on the outside over there. You see their varnish and all the doors. You can't miss it. Is that primer? Okay that was like that's a white looking brown. They're just so cute. Wow. That come out good. Look at that. Wow. That's your profession huh. That looks good. Well she's gonna like that when she comes in. Look at this. Wow. That's beautiful. And there's Chloe Ferdinand. Ta-da. Get out the number. Don't be shy. It's only been six months. So you first the primer then it does this. Wow. Look at that. Oh goodness. Got the door too. That was awesome. Where do books on? Not no door here yet. My long screen. Okay. Babe, give me a minute. Come here babe. Close your mouth. go home you hear the door? this way how can it be a long walk?, you know where have you been?! You should push the big SDR. That was not a big SDR, but I was a little bit mad. No, who put it here? You know, babe? Babe, who put it here? Oh, that's a good one. Well, we have to tell him no. In the detail. No, no, no. He put the whole door. No, no, no, no, no. Glad, babe. It's my wing, baby. That's not the right size. Oh, my goodness. This white door, folks, is what we're talking about. It's supposed to be on the CR. The CR door is supposed to be white. Okay? This bathroom is shared by the whole first floor. Oh, we got a little crack in there, one of their trees. That's not completely going out there. We'll get it back here and we'll take a look at that. I'm sure they need to go here. Oh, it's my fault now. Well, they got the wood panels wrong. Yes. And we need to talk to Christina. Babe, we're not paying for this. This is nothing CR. Okay? And plus look. Look. We're not going away. Plus, also look. Yeah, and this. But we're not paying for this door. This is not what we... This is not a CR door. No, I don't think this is right. I know babe. That's what I wonder. Is it on the paper? I called my last time. He said, yeah, I changed it. Well, you're going to have to talk to him. Here. Got the window in over here. Over here. Over here. You got a screen, mate. What's the screen? Well, maybe they're not done. Maybe they're not done. Well, this... It looks real dark. The room color. Oh, no, no. You don't like it. It's just this floor. It was... But it's not that dark in actuality. It's more like this color. Just the lighting or the camera here. The camera. See? This shade's different. It's not as light and as light as dark. It's somewhere in between. It's kind of like that way. Look at the... Oh, oh, oh, oh. Yeah. Okay, so... Yes, I'm getting used to this. I've got to correct them. Okay. I'm going to talk about this. There's some gaps here. Between the windows. That's got it... Well, maybe they know that. And maybe they're just going to feel the hands here and see up over there. Look right there. There's gaps. They came in and took measurements. So, one of those have always been the same. So, they're going to have to close those gaps out. The window people. The clock is a something that's going to be put in there. I'm going to be the same thing for this one. Okay, that's the wood. That's like what was that. This is going to be framed out, initially. Oh, I've got some peans. He says, there's the color. Well, Koei and Jimmy, we called him again on the way over here to see if he was here today. He's pushed it off till tomorrow. It's Koei and Jimmy, the well guy. Welcome to the Philippines, folks. Those of you who haven't been here. Just because someone says they're going to be a certain warrior, certain time, or certain day, it's probably not going to happen. You get somebody that is, consider yourself the most fortunate. Well, Jody at the time. It just doesn't happen that way. This is the Philippines. The whole culture, expectations, everything is different. You can come over here, you can say I'm going to be a part of this. I'm going to demand, you can demand all you want. This guy is going to work for the schedule. They're scheduled. So, be prepared to be frustrated. You've got to be patient. You've got to insist and then come over here. It's something. I love it here. You can get lots of time to have some food. Obviously, it's not finished here. We're getting there. So, they're talking about some other things. I'm going to go upstairs now. It's on my deposit. I get up there because nothing's changed here. Oh. And we pause it. I'll be at the place. Okay, I'm going to just start this one here since we had a pause. Well, we're going to get the paperwork, we're going to check the paperwork out. And what the paperwork says is what we're going to stick by. Okay? I'll tell you folks in a minute. Let me go out here and just look. See? This is what they're at so far here. They just started this this morning for the Veranda. I'm probably not going to walk out there because the CRs are about the same. Hi. It's a nice little design recommendation, but this is the outside Veranda. I kind of like it. Baby. Hi. Okay. Take a photo. See you, Archa. I just told you business. Okay, so I'd say and we've already today. Let's see what we're looking at. And then stuff out very briefly. There's land. You've got the house and good day. Coffee. Hi. Sorry. Oh. Tripped on the wire there. No, no change here. Okay. So give you a little scenery when I'm talking. What we're talking about in there is they put the white bathroom door and I'm going to pass this way from the hallway. Okay, that's not what we wanted. We wanted a white door with the full length mirror and the CR. Okay. Just everybody knows that. So we're getting a different story from the people she's talking to. But we're going to stop by there and get it cleared up. We also ordered two screen doors with the wood furnishing panels. And I believe that is on the paperwork. I mean, check it when we get back in the truck. Because now the ladies trying to say, oh no, that's more expensive. No, no, no, no. When the orders you that, we pointed it to you the very first time we stopped by there. So here we go. A bit on this merry go around before. Let's see where it takes us. There's Tatae walking in the distance. So anyway, that's where we're at with that. We're also going to talk to some gaps in the windows. We're going to wait and see when they finish. Nelson's shoveling the, doing the mix. Rebars there. And Jay's over here. Hopefully today's Wednesdays, we've got Thursday Friday side. We're through more days. Hopefully they can get this whole thing done by the end. Like our design, we took out. It's nice for outside. There's a different look. We'll see. So anyway, another issue to deal with. And then also the electrician who can't come back. So he's requesting 20,000 pesos. The remaining balance is 36,000 pesos. So the foreman said he will finish the work. We just pay the electrician to give him the money to get to the electrician. You know, because they call us out. I bet they can use the speech while we can't work. You know, he has to make the living. He's really them too, what they do. So probably tomorrow we'll come here with, outside of the day with 20,000 pesos. And then the remaining balance won't score your Jesse's done. That's just going to make it a little bit longer. And I'll work with James. This is the third day he's hasn't been here. Apparently he's doing tiles at his own home. So I've asked Slady Jazz. I'll talk with everybody. We're not going to find somebody that would play somebody. Somebody that's going to be here every day. I know people have things going on in their life. These projects have been going on. And we're trying to get it done for a little bit. It gets here at least to where we can move in. Oh, well, you know. Let's see if they... The wall is inside of the walls. How did he realize he did that? Rendering. That's cool. Rendering. So they did that. That's cool. I'm glad they did that. But, um... So anyway, we got some issues to talk over Lady Jazz and I. And then of course, the coil mic is delayed. He's in the middle of another job. So he was supposed to be here today just to him and... another guy. Start digging the septic tank and getting it prepared. We're going to go to the three chamber septic tank. Actually two of them. I think I told you one. On that side of the house, the larger one for the two CRs. This CR here, one over here somewhere. We're bringing it out here. The septic tank over here somewhere because I'm going to pull it. Granny flat, mother and mom house, y'all y'all house. So something eventually over here. So I'm going to tie it into the same series that this one's going to be tied in. So we're going to have to set that one up so it can connect. And we go over here somewhere in the future. Digging ahead. So anyway, that's what we're looking at. So I'll go ahead and stop the video here. There's no more updates for now.
