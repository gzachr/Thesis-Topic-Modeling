 Just breathing in that fresh, fresh egg. It's just so tranquil, so beautiful. I feel like I'm going to be saying that quite a lot. That's so cool. We have our own little lodge. But the views are absolutely astonishing. The gateway of the tea plantations here in Munna. I should really be drinking tea. I feel like I'm cheating drinking a coconut. Just breathing in that fresh, fresh egg. Good afternoon and welcome to Munna here in Kerala Gods own country. This morning we got up bright and early and embarked on a five hour drive from a leppy to this beautiful hill station. Over 1500 metres above sea level, I'll be honest with you. We slept most of the way but we did get out and witness one beautiful waterfall. This is why we decided to get a taxi to take us to Munna rather than get the bus because we get to stop off at spots like this. This is incredible. This is Valera. The waterfall is now surprising that it's Munna season but it hasn't been too much rain so a lot of the waterfalls on the road are driving. This one's definitely flowing. You wouldn't expect it. It comes out of nowhere. You're just driving along the road and bang. A huge waterfall in the middle of the jungle canopy. You would miss this. You would miss all of these waterfalls if you got the bus. There was another one just up here that we stopped at but it's meant to be Munna season. There was no water at all but we have now checked in and had the nicest greeting. Hello. What a welcome. Oh, me thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Oh this is lovely. Look at this. You always get such a beautiful welcome here. From the Rivillette River Result and look at this. This is our balcony. We are right on the river surrounded by lush green hills. We have the next day to two days to explore as much as humanly possible of this hill station. But first we need to show you our room. This is unbelievable. And the activities we checked in, the hotel has a blimin activities board. There's like 15 activities. We don't even need to leave. We are not leaving this afternoon. We need to appreciate the resort, the views and it took us a long time to get here as Matt says. So we might as well make the most of it. The area itself is just so tranquil, so beautiful. I feel like I'm going to be saying that quite a lot but this is our balcony. A beautiful, beautiful view out onto the hills, the forest, the river. We have a place to sit so we can enjoy that view. I don't know which way of sun is going to set. Maybe we'll try and catch it. We have our TV which I'm not using. I'm here. We have a big bed and actually they've put a little person made out of flowers. I always think that is so, so clever. We have our bathroom through here. And then as if we needed any more space. We have a whole living area. Again with that little, a little annex view. But we are starving. After that long journey I need to eat. And probably get on with. I will show you when we have lunch. And he's eating though. That's so cool. We have our own little lodge overlooking the river and this. Look at the hills. It's so green. It's unbelievably green. It's almost too green. Which way are we going? Is it this way to the restaurant? Thank you. You know me. We can drop Molly off. While I go out exploring, Molly off in the little kiddie's part. Like Molly said, lunch first. I'll show you the board of activities which is outrageous. I don't know how we're ever going to get out and actually explore the lush hills, the tea plantations, the waterfalls, everything in between. And this is it. Look at the board of activities. They've got nature walk, cycling, archery, babbling and piranha tree. Catch your own fish. You can go fishing. Horse ride in, tea harvest in. I'm going to have to get involved. We'll get involved with some of them. If not, like I said, we will never leave this place. Oh wow. This place just gets better and better. Lunch was devoured. Thank you very much. Nanny. Thank you. That's okay. This looks good. Thank you. Cheers. Cheers. We have all the cold coffee. I don't know if it is about cold drive, but they just take all your energy out of here. We also have a lot of food. We haven't eaten since very early this morning. And we're very predictable. We have a clear match of salad. We have to cut these. I should have a can of my vegetable. This looks different though. It looks much darker. Makes me think it's spicier. It's good. It's very much. I'm having a coffee in the land of tea. And was extremely needed after that long drive. And we also found out that at the resort here, we weren't sure we thought we might have to pay extra. To do some of the activities on the board. They told us that apparently every activity is included within the price of your stay, which I think is so good. But look at this. This is Munar. I'm in an infinity pole. Overlooking this. Wow. The lush green hills. And I think we might have an appointment with a horse at sunset. I think we've decided that from the list, horse riding at sunset by the river. Sounds the best, like. As Munar as it can get. You're only in Munar once. Appreciate it. Take it all in. Wow. We're actually really high right now. Look at that drop. It's... And the views. And that's the rest from what we just... I told you. We're doing it right here at the Rivulet Result. You're in one of the most beautiful places in the world, with some of the most unique sites in the world. Not that you can care about leaving. Hello. Who's there? Nira. Nira. Hi, Nira. So one of the activities is to ride Mira the lovely horse. Okay. What have I been doing? It's only my second time riding on here. Are you ready to fall? No, I'm not. Hello, Mira. I'm here, Rana. Give her a strike, please. Hold this. He's gone. Bye. This is your new pet. Oh, you're lovely. I don't know what to do. Hello. It's such a nice touch, isn't it? It's a really nice thought to have. So I can basically ride on the river and just enjoy it as the clouds take over. This makes sense. Now you can get on. This is a good idea. Okay. Right. This side? Okay. And then put one foot on either side. Oh. Oh. I can't jump on. Careful, Moli. Careful. Like this? Oh. Over the top? Over there. This is not very pleasant to you, Moli. Right, sorry. You look good. Okay. Mirror. Oh, these gentle. Wow. How do you hold on? You good? Yeah, she's a little bit wonky, don't you? This is such a lovely touch. Although I must admit my balance is off and Mira wants to run. She wants to run very fast. But look at this. The clouds are taking over. I'm on the river. Hello, I'm riding Mira. Woo! This is hard to hold on. Vlog and keep my balance will look the same time. But the views are absolutely astonishing. Thank you, Mira. Thank you so much. You were amazing. Thank you, Mira. You did a good job. You did a good job. Thank you, Mira. Thank you, my friend. Thank you so much. I think having Moli on your back is enough punishment for Mira for this evening. I didn't want her to go through the pain of having me as well. But you can see at the moment we've just walked down on to where the river runs parallel to the resort. And normally this would be flowing down with scenic cascade all the way along. This is monsoon season and we haven't had, well they haven't had much rain at all so far in Muna. So this is as good as it gets. Good morning, I mean is it okay if I get in the front? I can sit in the front today. Thank you. Good morning and welcome back to Muna. We are upright. And only this morning we just had a couple of doses for breakfast and we were in the car. This is a mean our driver who actually took us to Muna. If you're only coming for a couple of days I'd highly recommend booking a taxi or a private taxi because obviously 4 or 5 hours to get here and there aren't any trains. But we are off to see some tea and hopefully we see some elephants, wild elephants. What is that? This side we hope. We've been going barely 5 minutes and we've had to stop. Already the views are out of this world. Lush, green hills, the clouds hugging the mountain tocks and wow this looks like a postcard. This supposedly isn't even that great of you but I mean look behind me I've never seen anything like it. You have like rolling hills, you have the in twining roads, you've got the beautiful mountains. I've never seen so much tea. Honestly I've never seen so much tea and this is unreal. Fun fact for you, this is the second mile viewpoint and it's actually the gateway of the tea plantations here in Muna. So if this is the first thing that we see then it shows that we're going to have some ugly photos. This is going to be fun. Look at it, it looks photoshopped honestly. How was that just the gateway? That would have done me. I could go back to the hotel and say yeah you know what I've seen some amazing views of tea. But we've been told by a lot of people especially at the hotel that we need to go to Gap Road. It is a whole road that goes for like 50 kilometres that is just surrounded by tens and tens and hundreds of different tea plantations. So get this area to yourself, you can see the actual viewpoints, a sort of a little bit touristy. You have people coming up to you saying can I get a photo of you, do you want to buy a coconut which is nice. It's even nicer to get your own into tea plantations yourself. We have just made it on to Gap Road and I mean you said this is the best road in the whole of Kerala. Number one, the most beautiful and I can see why we're just going through lush again. Lush, green and beautiful, giving my three words today. Look at this, look this is just a normal part of the road and we are surrounded at these tea hills and then the mountains in the background. And this road Gap Road is actually the road that is built between the two mountains hence the name. Gap Road, just enjoy. I don't think we have ever driven on a road where you could literally just stop. Anywhere there are specific viewpoints which we will check out and then these ones just pop out and nowhere. Hello. Do you need a bit of slow person? Okay. Two is good. This is good. Do you have a judge? No, we do not have a judge. We have a judge. We have a judge. Only card. This is a first in India. In India only card. Okay we'll pay by card. Do you accept an international card? Yeah, let you play this. Okay we try. Thank you and we can just walk around. Okay. If you were anywhere. Anywhere. Ah perfect. Thank you very much. Happy honour. Happy honour. That's really cool because a lot of the places you're not actually allowed in the tea fields at all, whether it's a factory or anything. The tea field is blocked off. It's really cool to have stopped off here which isn't like a... That's the thing to do. Don't go to a designated viewpoint. Just pull up. Chance your arm. Go for it. And now we are in. Wow look at this. We're in the tea fields. This is so cool. I wasn't expecting that we're actually getting to go into one. If you were to visualize heaven. This. This. This. Would be it. We have made it in. I didn't think we'd make it in today. We were told. Look at it. Look at the road. We even ran. We were told at our hotel that it's really difficult to actually get into the plantations itself because, obviously, people are growing them. And if locals are cutting them, it's difficult. They don't want you in there. Get in photos and the actual factories don't let you in. So we're very lucky with that guy. You can see not many people have ventured in. We can just get lost in the plantation. Amazing. And one thing about the tea plants is, I said it to Matt, they look like a maze because they grow in a way that's so winding. It's just beautiful. So all of this. This postcard picture setting started back in the late 19th century when the first tea plantations open. I'm going to give it a smell. I probably shouldn't have picked it, but picking up one. It doesn't smell of anything. It's just a leaf. It's just a leaf. I expected it. I don't know what, but I expect it to smell of like your cup of tea in the morning, but it doesn't. But here in Munar, all of this. And so much more, actually, equates to half of Carol's whole tea production. And I mean, you could stand here and take it all in for hours. Hello. How much is it coconut? I'll check to the big one for you. Can I have one please? Are they good? They fresh? Are they sweet coconut? They look really nice. It can't get much fresher than here. Oh, machete is out. And what are locations to cut it in front of the tea terraces? I don't know how everyone's so good at it. I know. Whoa. We have leakage. Thank you very much, Nandri. Nandri, is it Nandri? Yes. Nandri is Tamil, no? That's Tamil, yes. That's Tamil. Oh, they're from Tamil Nadu. Yes, Tamil Nadu. I Tamil every place is Tamil language, Tamil Munar. And Malala. Not Malala. Can we have a straw please? I'm interested. Amazing. Thank you very much. Wow, that is expertly cut. Thank you. Look at that. Thank you. We'll have a review. Oh, that is so sweet. I think they taste nicer when you get to look out at this. So good. A fresh Munar. It's very good. Do you want a coconut? Are you sure? Are you sure you don't want one? No, no, no, no. Are you sure? I can not. Look at this. Coconut. Hmm. With that tea. I should really be drinking tea. I know. I feel like I'm cheating drinking a coconut. So tomorrow it will open. Tomorrow it will open. Tomorrow it will open. Okay, thank you very much. Happy on them. So we were just about to go to the Lockhart Tea Factory to see how the tea is made, how it is produced. But unfortunately today is a bank holiday. So hopefully we can find somewhere else maybe in the Munar town. But if you are coming, I definitely recommend it. It looks really cool. You can go in there. Watch the tea production. Probably drink some tea. They describe Munar as misclad. And you can definitely see why the clouds have just started to roll in. We're actually on our way to the city centre because we have a plan B. We need to try some of the famous tea but again we have to just stop off. You just stop off everywhere along the road. And taking some of the best views you're ever going to see. This looks like a little island. A little tea or a little tree is coming out the top. But yeah, everywhere you stop it's just wow. The only problem today being that it is on them is normally all the way up to the top. It is normally all through. These tea fields you would see the... they call them the tea ladies. The ladies that are out harvesting but obviously as it is a day of rest it is a holiday. It is a celebration. There are no tea ladies behind me instead. They're probably on the Kingfish or celebrating on them. We have made it to Munar town. It's given me a mountain town by the... It reminds me a lot of Baguio in the Philippines. We're hoping to actually try some tea in one of the cafes here. There's not loads. Hello. Hello, another's going. Happy honour. I think it's here but we need to go in here. We don't know if it's open. Is it open? Tea tails? Oh, okay. It's open? Okay. Thank you. Nanny. We hope. We hope. It is open. This doesn't look... No! I don't know. This doesn't look too open to me. Excuse me? Tea tails? Right there. Thank you. Oh, look at the rain. Oh! Oh, no! Is it open? Yeah, I think. This is so funny. It's just like a cafe. Dirty along those little... Oh no, is it not open? Hello. Hi. Thank you. We want to try some tea. Do you do the tea tasting? Yeah, do you do. Is it on the menu? Which one do you do? Do you do? Insegi. Inside you have. Can we come and have a look? Woo! Oh, you have like an office. Is it open? This is so cool. Oh, wow. So this is actually the tea that tastes the room where they normally have a programme, but today because it's a holiday, there is no staff. So what we've done is we've picked two teas that are famous to Minar. We have the Minar Orthodox. And you can see, look, there's just so many different teas. And this one is... Oh, I know. Exoticer. And I need organic tea, do you get the exoticer? No, it doesn't smell as strong as this one. I'm excited. Okay, one of each, please. That was a little bit confusing. The guy didn't speak any English. So he called the owner and the owner explained to us that there isn't anyone there today to explain the tea to do the full tasting process. But in the end, we were going to go for two, but we've gone for three of the most famous teas here in Minar. And we are sat. And this little balcony overlooking the town is pretty cool. Wow, thank you very much. I want a glass of... That's it? One billion. And the other one. Okay, great. We got it back. And then you get to see the third one. Yeah? You do. Okay, great. Right. This is really cool. So this is classic tea. No, thank you. This is classic tea. Now I actually wasn't expecting it to be yellow. So this is classic tea. Now I actually wasn't expecting it to be yellow. Yeah, look at the colours. This looks more like your typical... Kind of. This really does it. You can see the leaves are in the bottom here. And we're basically going to you learn it in few. This looks really hot. And weird. Why is it yellow? I don't know. Which one is this? The classic. Last night. It's probably blind. I really think. This is not the food you might have flavour. No flavour at all actually. Right? It's no flavour. I can't lie. I'm not the biggest fan. That would need a lot of sugar. Just because the chocolate tea looks more like the colour I was expecting from... That's it. The more like the colour I was expecting from tea. So that smells more like tea as well. That one had no flavour. Oh, that's quite strong. Not as strong as I was expecting. But... It's nice. It smells much better. That's nice. Bit of sugar. A little bit of milk. Mmm. And you're good to go. Exotic. I think the guy here has actually forgotten... ...a third tea. But that doesn't matter. We've tried two. You couldn't come to Moon Art. I'm not trying the famous tea. And I very much like. Very much like. I like a lot. The exotic art. I can say a little bit of milk. A little bit of sugar. And that would be perfect. But this really is. This is Moon Artown. It's actually recommended. Not to stay in Moon Artown if you come to the area. Stay in one of the hotels. That has an amazing view itself. You come here to be isolated, in paradise to enjoy the views. And the town definitely isn't there. Within like five minutes, the heavens have well... ...entrually open. We're lucky we got the tea just in time. But now look, you can't see anything. You can't see any of the plantations. So, chocolate. Chocolate factory. Chocolate... My coffa. My coffa. What is my coffa? No that's the name. Okay. We've heard that not only tea is famous in Moon Art, it's also famous. Or Carol as a whole. The chocolate. And there's no way that we're going out in this to see anything else for the meantime. So I don't mind stuff from my face a little bit of chocolate. Here we are. I am very excited to try the complete chocolate experience. Not all of them, but actually open. So we've managed to find one, the macosa. Looks like it's a roastery as well. It's huge. So can they make it here as well? I don't know, but I just want to eat some chocolate. Hello. Hello. Oh, it smells so good. This is heaven. You eat it every day because I work for this one. Amazing. Do you have like a tasting that we'll do? I think you're a little bit more simple. It's bigger balls than we can. That'll be amazing. Thank you. Can you see this before? No, it's the first time. It's coconut, right? Yes, 80% of the chocolate is grown here. And this is not a metronome. It's a metronome that becomes like yellow color. And you see the food like sea sun. The sea is to mix chocolate. One food is having like 22-30 sea suns. Now 100 kilo chocolate making. We have two, like 250 kilo sea, 400 kilo sea. Oh my gosh. It's really complicated. It is really complicated because inside this is those sea. And it's the sea that I think that they use to make the chocolate. So here they actually shape the mold and freeze all the chocolate. They have a factory that does all the roasting and the fermenting. But my eyes are just on this. What should we try? Yeah, what funs? It looks so good. It looks like mad light. Oh wow, thank you. I'm going to use black honey. And then here. Mango. What do you think? I'm not sure. And this one is black currant. Oh wow. This is the dark chocolate we gave over the local market. Oh my gosh. 80%? I mean heaven. This is a healthy. This is so good. Mmm. It's a truffle that is kind of real. It's 100% chocolate. Wow, that's going to be quite strong, right? Yeah. It just tastes like health. You know? Can I eat it in one? Oh wow, it's quite bitter. Wow. Wow. Oh my god. I've never had 100% chocolate before. Oh yeah. Oh wow. It's a little bitter. It's quite bitter. Wow. Oh my god. I've never had 100% chocolate before. Oh yeah. It's quite bitter. Wow. It's like a real... I've had like some bantanati, crunchy caramel. Oh, some cashew. Rosicarsho? The stascio. The stascio. All of them basically. And then can we also get which ones did I like here? I really like, can we get the pineapple and the mango as well please? Oh, that looks so good. Okay, I think that's good. Thank you. Thank you. We have a quarter kilo box of chocolate. I know what I'm going to be snacking on later. I feel sick. That was a bad idea. He ended up giving me like 15 different chocolates and we've bought a quarter of a kilogram to finish for the rest of the day but in the land of tea, it's a difficult task to find a cappuccino. They don't even do a cappuccino in our hotel so we've come into it. You know what, I don't even know what the name of the hotel is but the view. This is helping us. Taking away the sick feeling. Yeah, this is helping us get rid of the sick feeling and the views are absolutely unreal. You know this is 100 rupees, so 1 pound for a cappuccino. And our hotel I think is somewhere down there at the bottom of the valley but if you want a cappuccino, come up to... No, there's no one here to ask. Excuse me. Hello. Hello. If I'm ignoring me. I don't know. You can find a cappuccino for yourself but this is stunning. Look at the views. They don't just have the valley, they also have the tea fields there in the distance. We've got to drink this quick because... Hmm. I've got a special lunch at the hotel being that it is on them. By the time you see this, on them would have been. A long time ago. Thank you, I got back. Thank you. So for lunch, we are actually having this idea. Often not having it at all and now having this is our second time of having it. So we have salt. Salt always comes first. And apparently everything is going to be a different colour. Oh my God, so now we have... Sweet. Sweet, this is going to be for our dessert. So, this is a dessert. It's a dessert. Thank you. This is so cool. There's like a line of people coming and adding each particular dish. And there are so many colours going on here. Oh my God, look at this. Thank you. And we don't have feedbacks, it's pink. And we're in the overflow room. Yeah, there's too many people next door. I have a message. So we're in the overflow. Here we go. 26 different dishes all in different colours. And it's a nice stop. I'm left to right. I'm going to start with something sweet to have the colours. Very crunchy. I have no idea what that is. And then we have banana tin. Look, there's salt in. And then you can boil them. The pickles, the duck in, curries and the rice. With your hands. That's good. I have a lot of salt.
