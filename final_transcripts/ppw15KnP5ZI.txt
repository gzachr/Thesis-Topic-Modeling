 What do you loved Philippine? I love hei that song can exist in Sendom to earn money The consequence of a nearby Nobody can survive In Nigeria if you do not have money, northern of Sudan you have your face You can't earn any other insults Thank you to my own channel To this video I have my friends here so I'll be asking them some questions about their best impression of their team. So I have here in Skinsai. So here in Skinsai, in Matsuhima, say hi. So here in Yunis, say hello. So guys, this is the day to be fun. So grab your popcorn and join us as we discuss. So the best question I have, why do you move to the food room? Why do you decide to move here to the food room? So I said it's a study here. My friends, not even my friends said, as you can see, that we have good standard teaching here for us. So that is I mean here, which I don't know my decision, studying outside. Okay, so the main reason why you came here is just to study. Because the school has good standard. I was in the study outside. So looking for me, I will see. So I still came here with the rest of the lesson. So move out of the rest of the lesson. Okay. And I came here to study. I also came here to flex. So I had to add island. I got to ask for this. Yes. Okay. So again. Okay guys, that was nice. So they came here to study. So the next question, what can you say about your experience in the Philippines so far? Have you liked, and can't talk anything? If you know your experience with them. Um, Filipinos are nice, but not all. Like in my neighborhood, she's very nice. But once in a while, I don't like about them. They are laughing, they do laugh at people. So I don't like it. If you are going on a really, they are laughing at us. Yes. So I feel so embarrassed. I think you have to get to history because maybe school. Maybe because they are laughing, they missed a fair people. That's like it. I don't like it. What about you? I think they are cool because I've been with my friends. They are not okay. They are all because I'm full of cool youths. They are all cool. And I'm not. I'm not used to any bad impression about them. Well, that was nice. What's that about? My friends bought the first ones when they grabbed my hair. Oh, man. When I came here, okay, I want that to go to the market. I mean, it's a nice market. For the first time, you don't have to see my hair. Okay. I mean, you are. But this one, she grabbed my hair from the back. I was long. Oh, my God. I was like, huh. You started with this. And let me back the hair. For you know, not with this thing. But the ones I've seen, my brothers friend, young guys. And they like, they like, out. Yeah. But you pay. Yeah. You pay. We pay. You don't get to let me go. Yeah. Just know that you will be the ones to pay. Yeah. That's true. So what can you say about that language barrier? It's terrible. Because most times, like on our group chat now, like, I don't like you. They are speaking their tag. I want to buy a third of English please. They are just, I don't know. They just ignore you. They don't speak the language. And I think it's bad because we are classmates. So they are meant to be speaking English. So all of us can get a lot. I don't like the language. But I want to learn. What they are. You learn. You think. Yeah. I have a book chat with my dear Natu. I'm speaking in a catalog. When I say English because I'm really learning. And I was asked to speak English. So it's not that I'm out learning. Yeah. Yeah. I know what to learn. Right. But I see both. But I don't know. I'm out learning. And I'm out learning. I know I learn tag. I mean, yeah. No. You really know why I want to learn some language. Because if you go to market. Yes. Well, he doesn't have a right now. He shows me my junior. But we want. We want. Basmatic rights. No. Just explaining them different things. Because if you had to do well, you can't hear. Looking to the Joe. You know. I know. czy 맡 went to Lamai o suet ga se esai definidipan yap gerandド ...at the next place, how long have you been in the Philippines? Today it's in Switzerland. This is my one, I stayed like one month a month. So I'm enjoying the state because of most of the out-of-body food. I'm not that terrible situation that I'm into now. I don't like the food, but as time goes on I'm getting used to the food. Okay, that was a nice one. I'm in the city of St. Petersburg. Okay, I've been here for one month, say months. Wow, so she had been here for a month. I mean she came last month right? Oh gosh. Wow. And it's quite interesting. I guess it's very relaxing. I'm just like trying more meals. But it's quite interesting for how long have you been in the Philippines? What's about you? Two months, two months. Three weeks. Wow. So what can you say about the weather, the Philippines weather? The Philippines weather, I just equivalent to Nigerians. Really? Yeah, I think it's very cold. I think it's very cold. It's not cold. It's not cold. It's not cold. It's not cold. It's not cold. It's not cold. It's not cold. I was saying in most states. So the weather, but there's some somehow. The weather is so harsh. It's harsh. And yeah, the weather is not good. I don't like this. I don't like the weather. What about you? I'm saying really good. Yeah, I mean like what do you have to say about the Philippines weather? Oh, look at the weather. It would have been a change from time. So sometimes it's hot. Sometimes it's cold. Or less it's raining. That's not hot. It's raining. It's raining. Most people are going to fall asleep. Yeah, it's really raining. That's why you have to get to umbrella. It's really raining. I came here at June. Do you know how to do it? Yeah, do it somewhere. I can do it somewhere. Jesus. It took me while we changed my clothes. While we're by shots. While we're by single-edged. See, I have a few spots. I was like, it's very good. I'm going to enjoy this weather. It's when I came home. It was when you came to do so much. So yeah, I did do it somewhere like June. It was a big city. Yeah. So what's your expectation? We're coming here. I started to see like, you know, you and they like, let's say the village part of Philippines. Because you arrived and money like was like good in the night. So it was like both right and right. We were great. We saw like, you and me. We were small. Actually, I never planned to study in San Fernando. When I came to San Fernando, when I arrived, I was going to San Fernando. Not money like study. So, I was about to study. Any special way we were coming. I shouldn't have liked it. You say like, good to be... All of the people from the village part of the city. But nobody knew about this. But nobody knew about this. You know, I'm going to the part soon. Yeah. Yeah, it's so much. But this is a very disappointed. I was not in mind that the other part, but nobody knew about this. I was supposed to study in the first time I came here. It was actually a coup, it was in a winch. So, that's my expectation. Yeah, my name is Vettor Paul. I'm a capital. What about you? I was not in the second place. I told I expected it. I expected it. Because when I was in Nigeria, when I was like, I was saying something like that. I think it's because we have a brother in here. That's why. You said that I was going just to check my steps. When I was in, I was like, I'm coming to see God's sick culture. When I was coming to know what's going to be my uncle in Badge. In Badge? No, Badge is cold. So, I was like, okay, I'm seeing my uncle in Badge. Maybe I'll get used to Badge. Then I'll stay while I head. I'll go and do transfer. Oh, and I saw the school people in Badge. So, I'm thinking, yeah, yeah. So, the name here is Fernando is Les's Chipper. On Pets Manila, all that place is against. I have a home boy. When I arrived here, I was sitting there because I was expecting maybe. This is like Switzerland, Canada. When I arrived here, I cried. I caught my mom. I'm going home, I miss my return. I was crying. Maybe it was my first time to leave my parents. I don't have any option. I just have to adapt. That's all I have to do. So, let's move to the next question. So, any cultural show in the Philippines? Any cultural show? Okay, the grittiness bits. How? Okay, Nigeria is a much too grittier. The only one who was with me when you were a person. Even if you don't know the person. But here, this is Italy when I was coming here. I had to grittish someone. He didn't even respond. He just smelt me a sea. He didn't like his cultural business. I don't like it. Because I'm already used to grittiness. Everyone you have to grittish and I once said, yeah, you just have to like, mind your business. What about any cultural show in the Philippines? I think that she's actually cheap. I must say cheap ones. Is it good? Like the cultural. Yeah, it's the same thing. Because they're good in the middle of the year. There are some people who respond to the right. I don't know if they're going to do something. You don't respond. Yeah, nice. Let's see who would be grittish. Yeah, I don't know. My own is this one. I think that's the form of grittiness. I don't know. To me, no. It's a very big name. For in New Zealand. Yeah, they are on this stage. You know, in 90s, most times, that's the black. That's the black. Yes, in the G.A. He's not compulsory. They're choosing if you want to be. Especially the police. That's when I went to church. Almost study. She went straight to the other. When she was coming to the church. That was all. I was sharing about this guy. I don't know. I think I've only attended a church once. Okay. So the next one. Have you tried any flipping of foods? Yes. I tried the Steward Fried Spaghetti. Okay. But I was omitted the year like, it's so terrible. Well, I like the chicken. I don't like the Steward Fried Spaghetti. And I had the indoo. Not the sensing. It's not the sensing. It's not the same. I know this is totally different. It's not the same. I don't like the food I like here in the arise. I don't like any of that. I never thought. What about you? I'm going to try any flipping of foods. I'm going to try any of the foods. I'm going to try the other foods. Most of the time, I don't like the rice. I don't like the chicken chips. Okay. There are many goodies. There are so many sweets shops. And I like the food. Sometimes, I try any sweets. But I like some of the foods. Wow. What about you? I've eaten a lot of them. I think you like trying sweets. Yeah. And I was impressed. Very nice. Nice markets. What do you spend a lot? I'm not a fan of rice since from Nigeria. More like rice. So, they are rice swacking like more like this. But they just have to add that because I think they made food before they came to rice. Nothing on their face. Nothing on their face. Okay. So none of you have tried once the tadobu. Aha. You have tried it before. I don't know if it's from another. It's from another. Yes. I don't know if it's from this market or a school place. Like, they said it's from Iran. Maybe they will not try this one. Yeah. That's not it. No. It's from the market. Yes. So, why do you love the Philippines? I love that song and it is from the Philippines. Wow. It's a month of money because in Nigeria, I knew my... Delia Launcia is like... Apart from my house rents, my Delia Launcia is 5,000. 5,000 pesos. I'm sure from school, 5,000 one-hour-long grief from the Philippines. And for the house, I want to know how much they can survive. They need to survive. In Nigeria, if you don't have the money, go and see the money. Go and see the money. Exactly. Yes. What about you? I don't know if it's from the Philippines. Yeah. Especially from the Philippines. Yeah. They are like... They are like... They are like... Of course, that's life. You have a revelation with Dich. Because sometimes you do this with Dich. You have to know. I don't know if it's from the Philippines. I don't know if it's from the Philippines. They are straight forwards. What do you get? Yeah. And then they are moved. I think you don't have to judge people in Nigeria. People judge. Nobody judge you for what you get. Maybe I should move every year. And they don't judge you. Nobody judge you. The Philippines are very... Very happy. I was shopping and I used to get to buy one. I was happy. Yeah. I think that. They are like... They are like... It's better. So... Have any of you visited any cities? I've never seen any cities. Manila. Do you like Manila? Yes, I love Manila. I've been to school. I don't think so. I don't think so. Maybe between my house. I don't know. I also like Manila. I think it's very big. I think the view from outside was... Very nice. I think it's about a year or so. It's time to do the meetings. Manila just decaptized soon.
