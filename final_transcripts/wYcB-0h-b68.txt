I've breakfast from this little cheesy sausage. Oh, it's like a sausage in the cheeseburg. That would be good. But, nah, I think we're good. I think we just needed a drink. Nah, I think we need to start drinking healthier. Let's just get some water. We need a big cold one though. What is that? A soup. Oh, you like that one? Okay. They got plenty options for you guys. Oh, it's 25. They even got power in them. Wow. We're not gonna get the juice today, but here are the options for the juice if you guys don't know. They got your sodas. I heard that the American mountain dew is way different than the Philippines mountain dew. I never really had the Philippines mountain dew. They got red bulls for you guys. They got all this coconut water. That's pretty good. Let's go. But we just got the water right here. And then they also got alcohol. Now, you drink? No. Just a can. Yeah, guys, let's go check them. Huh? It's all right. Don't struggle now. You got enough sugar. 177. Very affordable, guys. Excited? Yeah. I've been eating the date. Yeah, we have not eaten anything today. Very thirsty. It's so thirsty, guys. It's so cold now. Look at how perfect this is. Oh, you guys. Oh, my God. Look at how perfect it is. Now, we got hot dog water on the hot rainy day in the Philippines. So, this bad day is actually starting to turn out to be a good day, no? What did you just say? Hot rainy day? Yeah, hot rainy day. Oh, well, yeah. Like, it's like a six-kinda weird. Earlier, you know, it's sunny day. It's sunny rainy. This is the 7-Eleven hot dog. This is definitely not a 7-Eleven review. We're just hungry. So, let's try it out. This is the cheese on Gary now. Yeah, I believe that's cheese on Gary now. I don't really taste cheese, but it still tastes good. They even got sauce, too. You don't like mustard and... No. No, mustard, huh? Can I put some mustard in it? Yeah, you can. I don't want it, though. Oh. Can I see the mustard? That's mustard? Yeah. Mustard dressing. It might happen. Same thing. Can you open this now? Try that now. Not too much, though. Oh, my gosh. Looks disgusting, no? Oh, no. Yeah, try it. A little bit on it. Yeah. Is that like, Heinz ketchup or banana ketchup? Fine. Yeah. Actually, I like Heinz. Is it good? Yeah. Okay. So, guys, this is the barbecue show-pow. I'm so excited. So, guys, if you get a show-pow, they put some ink on there. You definitely want to take that off. Do not eat the ink. It's toxic. It's not. Let's get inside this show-pow. That's not barbecue. What is this? Oh, no. I thought it says, can you barbecue? You taste it first. You taste it first. I think this is bola bola. Yeah, bro. I got my hopes up. You see the heat. You see the heat. You see the heat. Does it taste like fish? Fish in there? Fish kind of the egg is it. Alright, let me try it. Let me try it out. So, it does smell like egg. I don't smell fish. I just had to make your eating. So, because I'm allergic to fish. Do you want to eat the fish? Or are you seeing food? Super. Mmm. It's good, though. Mmm. So, guys, those will give you so bad. Let's try it now. What is Shopao sauce? I don't know what's the maple. I guess it's like sweet. Yeah. I think it's honey. Sweet honey? Yeah, it might be honey. It looks like honey. You guys can see. It's giving it a try. Without the sauce, it was good already. Uh-huh. Good, right? I definitely recommend the Shopao guys. Super portable. Less than a dollar? Mmm. Very good. I'll make it in one minute. Mmm. Mmm. We are probably the same. Getting the medicine, guys. So, they have an eye infection. So, we need to buy some green tea. Is it yellow livid or stargurl? I'm not sure. Just all natural green tea. So... This one. They don't have this more than one. This one works. It's expensive. Yeah, well, how much is green tea? Here. How much is livid? Two or five. For all this? It's a good deal. I guess we'll go with the livid in there. I think we should just go with this. That's not green tea. It's just yellow label. Yeah, they need green tea. I don't know why you keep saying it. Alright, we'll go with the livid thing. Yes. 71? Yeah. How much is the livid thing? Yes. Well, we're going with the Japanese. So, we got the Japanese green tea. And guys, make sure not. When you look at green tea, you see the ingredients? It says 100% pure Japanese green tea leaves. Make sure it's 100%. Because sometimes it won't be 100% it's going to have addy. So, I don't want to waste money and I want to get these dogs healthy. So, it has to be 100% green tea. Huh, buy me that. Joke. It's very rainy out, so we did a quick stop because we found some pizza at this local culinary area. So, nah, there are double looks good. Yeah, there are double looks good. But, I'm not here for the Filipino food. I want to try this pizza. Here we go. It's called Hermalus pizza. I think we're going to go for a $2 pizza. So, let's see if it's any good. Go try it, guys. Smells very strong. It's got a very strong smell. Whoa. Guys, are you here? Yes. It's actually very good. It smells worse, but it tastes good. Like, I was expecting it to taste not that good. For 99 pesos, I think it's worth it. It's not that strong. The back home, I have the green tea. And, we have the water boiling. So, nah. I got this from... Oh, nice. You washed them too, huh? Ah, a bit job, nah. Yeah, let's make some tea. Oh, money cup. Nah, you got that money cup. And then... So, this. Nah, these necklace.
