 You know that this video is titled Filipino Singers Attempting? I have a feeling that after this video, this entire title should be changed in my opinion. I feel like it's gonna be like Filipino singers destroying international singers high notes. That's how I feel about it. You know what, my experience with the Filipino people and singers especially is different. Okay, and if you watched my videos, you'll know what I'm talking about. Thank you for clicking on my video down on the thousands of YouTube recommendations out there. I appreciate you for that. And let's just watch this together. Don't wanna be all by myself. Silindion. That breath. That breath, that breath, that voice. Oh, it better be Shariz. Oh, by myself. And how was she at that time? That's the question you should need to ask yourself. Because when I say destroyed that note, you should take in consideration every aspect there is. I don't know how old she was, but I'm sure it all ended under 20. And that itself is sick. Oh my god, Tori's the same note. She's a bit even higher. I'm not wrong. Oh my god. You notice this is the same note, but she actually took it higher. And she said in lyrics. Hi. Whatever that would. A Virginia is an insane belter, phrased and normal, insane. Oh, no. Oh, no. And she could hold it forever like. Okay. That's a very funny thing. That's the whole part. That's so nice. Oh my god. That one. What am I listening to? That's crazy. I'm really slow with all. That's a cow with a rato. Whitney's a rato. Oh my god. That's a cow. That's higher. Oh. She took it higher. So that's the thing. She took it higher. They didn't make it as long, but took it higher and then took it on low. And then added russian runs to make it more dynamic. I love what she did. That's a perfect technique. Christiana, look at that. Oh my god. That was a rose of her. I'm going to have more of that. Why have I never seen this before? How many of us have seen this before? Oh my god. She can't sit up for more. She has that around. That's from a real era. Oh my god. That's it. Wait, hold on. I just hate when good videos are over that quick.
