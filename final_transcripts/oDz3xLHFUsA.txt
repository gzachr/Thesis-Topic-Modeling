 Hi everyone! Welcome to Tampi Club and I'm Jin from K4TV. Hi, my name is Janela, 26 years old and I'm the only Filipino here. I'm a full-time social media manager and part-time UGC creator. Hello, everyone! Hi, I'm Jin. Welcome to the sunbathe club. Thank you. This episode of sunbathe app, you're going to be acting too. I feel like we're making a face mask. Oh, wow. I'm going to wear it. Let's do this. Oh, it's a K-pop inspired makeup. Perfect for you guys. And very nice eyebrows too. It's really thick and full. I can't plump lips. Me too. She's so pretty. I agree. What do you think about it? I think it would look good on you. Imagine your face like that. I agree. I want to see the whole thing. It's a K-pop inspired makeup. You can transform into a K-pop idol. It's K-pop inspired but I think the model really matters because she's down. And did you notice that before she applied makeup, she kind of put a skincare? I think it's sunscreen. Yeah, a moisturizer probably. You know what actually I just knew about sunscreen really protects the skin. So even if you're at home, like you need to put on sunscreen to help you be protected from the UV light. Right now we're always on our phones, always on our laptops. Yeah, I've heard her about that. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't really understand but yeah. I agree. I think I've seen her also when they talk. Oh, you're so pretty. I like her outfit. It matches her eyeshadow. Actually, I've never thought of putting on blue eyeshadow because I look like a peacock. But you know, down. I don't know what that's in here. Yeah, it's ugly. I feel like with makeup also, it's nice that you compliment it with your outfit. So if you notice she's wearing blue blouse. That's why the blue eyeshadow really matches her overall look. Yeah. So I think that's something good to note also whenever you put on makeup. The color of your outfit. Too much. I'm not too. That's right. She has to have to point. Yeah. She has a new learning today. She has a very healthy skin. The skin look is so... Oh my god. She's so beautiful. She's so beautiful. She's so beautiful. She's so beautiful. She's so beautiful. She's so beautiful. She's so beautiful. The skin look is so good. Yeah. It's completely... Glow. Yeah, it's really, really good. What kind of skin care is that? Maybe she has a good base. It's like the sunscreen maybe before. Maybe before. I like sunscreen. Of course, sunscreen doesn't last. I actually put on a Cosrx sunscreen because I recently got to know it and I changed it to that sunscreen. The reason why is because I used to have like white cast when you put on sunscreen. So I always always have that stress. Like, you know, I have to apply sunscreen but I just can't get rid of the white cast. What's wrong with my face? Maybe my face and my skin have the problem. But now the product is really the problem. I'll take that recommendation. I'll take that recommendation. I highly recommend it. Cosrx. It's a must for a sunscreen. Yeah. So now for the makeup transfer and the coat. Okay. Let's do this. Yeah. Let's do this. Put on two. Yeah. Just like she said. You have to remove your makeup first. Okay. I mean, I'm a clean cleanser. Oh, we have the product you recommended earlier. This is my solar cleansing water. You got that nice feel after you have a lot of makeup. Oh, thank you. I'm going to do it well. Okay. Let's do this. You have some more. Oh, you have to make it more moist. So, I'll apply first on the first half of my face. Oh, you're sure? So maybe they can see the difference. Yeah. I'll try to do it. Yeah. I just love how the Cosrx cleansing water is like so different from the other products. Usually when I use like the other cleansing water for the other products, it hurts my skin. But then the Cosrx one actually soothes your skin. And like it says, it moisturizes together. Look at that, guys. The huge amount of makeup is really removed and just one application. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. It's really pretty. Yeah. You still look radiant right now. Oh. You're so good. You're glowing out, girl. Thank you. Okay, so what do you apply next? I think it's toner first. It teaches me how to use this. I already have a toner, so I just need to use it. I have to use it. I have to use it. I use it to take it out. It's so comfortable. It's so comfortable. You can just use it to take it out. It's so comfortable. It's so comfortable. Yeah, it's my first time seeing a toner in the form of cotton pads. Wow. So it's really a treasure. Treasure. Wow. So it's really convenient. Yeah. It's really removed that skin. It feels cold. So I think that's kind of the effect that it suits your skin. And it doesn't sting because it's usually toner sting when you apply it first on your skin, right? Wow, it's nice to hear something. Yeah, it's cool. It doesn't sting. It doesn't sting. It helps you even out all the makeup. Yeah. It helps you even out all the makeup. That wasn't removed earlier from the micellar water. Wow. So this one really helps. What do you think? Wow. Can we do a run of paul? Thank you, thank you. Now next, it'll be the patches. It's one of my favorite products of Couserites 2. Can you tell me how to apply? Well, like, Korea has used this a lot because you know the stress of acne and you don't really want to show it. What do you have like, bad days that I have? It's perfect because I have it. Wow. It's perfect because I have it. Korean people are all like this. I'm a little bit. I have to put it right away. It's not that bad. Oh. It's like ASMR. It's like ASMR. Yeah. I don't think I can do a T-gam. Okay. That's a big point. I'll apply it here. Yeah. And you can see it easily. Yeah. It's your T-gam. Yeah. Can I see? Where is it? It's like it's transparent. Yeah, really. You almost didn't notice. You're a part of a T-gam. I'm not kidding. It's like it didn't apply anything because you know it really blends well with your skin. Absolutely. Okay. Next, it will be of course the lotion. And guys, this is oil-free cause Rx lotion. Nice. Oil-free ultra moisturizing lotion. Oh. But with cause Rx, what's your experience? Like how was it differ from the products you've used before? I've got to say it's really just from the title oil-free. After you put it on, it dries up easily. It seems like your skin just absorbs it. No oil, no glowing like because of the oil. We put on this amount that's applied evenly for all sides, I guess. I think it depends on the amount for each person because for me I have dry skin. I kind of tend to put more. Ooh. I love the feeling of how it suits your skin. And yeah, I agree that it's really being absorbed fast by this skin. Come on, you have to smell it. Yeah. It smells really nice too. It's a nude wall. These are like the main reasons why I kind of like transition on my products to like cause Rx. It started from the sunscreen and now I'm like a whole fat. I think I'm gonna switch to cause Rx. It's right after this video. You can't help it. Look at that. Okay, so what's next? Ah, the last one. Oh, okay. Getting important. Scent screen. Which is amazing. Also the sunscreen is smooth. I think that's one of the main reasons why it doesn't have a white cast. Mostly other sunscreen for me, I think it's a bit like taking hard and sticky. It's not like lotion. It feels very different from lotion. But this one is kind of similar with lotion. It's a bit smooth. It's my idea. It's because it's a little bit of a ton of it. Yeah, it's much smoother. It's super thin and foundation on the lips. Yeah. You can mump a lot with your lips. Yeah, I do that sometimes just putting on this one. I don't need other foundation. And can we just reiterate that sunscreen is really important. So it protects you from the sun. And even if you're staying at home, it also helps you because it's helpful when you ever use laptops. You're self-phone. It protects you from all the UV lights. I'm actually kind of on waist right now. No, I don't. It's such a cool one. Because of that, I'm going to take this with me. Bye guys. Bye. Are we done with our skincare? Yeah, you're absolutely ready. I mean, you can just go out right now. It wouldn't matter. I don't know what it is. Yeah, no makeup is needed. I love it. It's mesmerized. Okay, so now we have the perfect face ready. Cause you're ex-ready. With the natural makeup. You're already pretty and ready, so we're just going to do a minimum natural look.
