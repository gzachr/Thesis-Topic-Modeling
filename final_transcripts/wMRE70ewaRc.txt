 Good afternoon from BGC Philippines. I am in an area that I have actually intentionally avoided for the entire time I've lived in the Philippines over a year. The reason why I've avoided it is because everyone's already done it. Every other channel has made a video here or a series of videos in this area of BGC because it supposedly is one of the nicest areas in the Philippines. I thought since they've already made those videos I can go off the beaten path and do something a bit different for you guys. But after after a year in the Philippines I thought maybe it's time that I actually check it out and see what's so good about this area of BGC. So we're gonna start today's video with a room tour and then explore a little bit more of this area of BGC. I think it's called uptown. I'm not really sure. Hello. Good afternoon. Thank you. I only speak gamaai beside you. Yeah. Gamaai long. Yeah. Yeah. Which areas were you from then? Me from Nidanao. Mindenau. Okay so they speak the same Nidanao and we're from... Mindenau also? I went to Davao in Davao and Somal Island. Davao and Somal Island? Somal Island. Yeah next to Davao. Now we've done the online check-in so we're gonna head over here to the security...no no the mailboxes and find our room. I'm not gonna tell you which room it is because that's just not a good idea. I got it. Hi Kamostha. Okay long. Is this this is Tower 1? Yes sir. Okay all right it's the La Maha Ball. I'm ping. I owe I owe. So many people speak beside it. I always actually speak beside it so it's good. They speak to Gala here instead of beside it but some people speak it. All right we're gonna go up Tower 1 and do a full tour of the room here. Oh I thought you were saying my...oh the swimming pool is on the fifth floor. Fifth floor swimming pool. And there's like a gym in a swimming pool. Yeah gym swimming pool to that fifth floor. All on the fifth floor. Okay. All right thank you Selamah Ball. We got a swimming pool and a gym. Oh how long should I go for? Actually I'm gonna talk to this. This is fancy guys. My elevator is arrived. Okay for whatever reason the buttons on this side don't work. Not working. I'll figure it out. 49. 49. That's the top. Okay let's go look out the 49th floor then since we can't go to our floor. Ooh okay I'm glad we took a detour. Wow. Look you can see the ocean over here. I think there is a beach in the nila. Actually I know there is. I don't know why I said I think. Wow. I really don't know much about nila guys. I'm always in the besia and a lot of other channels can tell you more about it. I'm a nubi. But you can see all of these skyscrapers over here on the horizon on the other side of this river. But I do think this area is called uptown. But first we need to figure out how to get to our floor. Let's go back down. Let's stay focused. Let's try to get in our room. Let's try this again. Nope. Hello. I can't get to the eighth floor. I- oh I have to go to a different elevator. Yes. Oh. And the great guys high base. Oh okay. All right. Thank you. We're in the wrong elevator. Just anything on this side. Okay. So I'm out for a walk. Ooh. Wait a second. Let's take another detour over here. Ooh. Fancy. Open air breeze. You've got this view over here that I already showed you upstairs. But we also have couches in a lounge area. Table and stairs. But let's go- let's go into our room. This is perfect. All right. Let me set these bags down and then give you the grand tour here. We've got two chairs on a table with water included over here. Behind us we've got kitchen, stove top, hot water heater, rice cooker. Ooh. All the plates and cups that you may that your heart may desire. That's about it there. We've got a fridge, a microwave. Yeah. This is perfect for especially just one night. But even longer you can stay here. It's an apartment. Right here we've got a couch, a TV. Let's see if it's a smart TV. Yeah. It says Netflix. AC. We've got whatever that is. A work table. That's great. You can do some editing. And then a bed. Let's see if if you can separate the bedroom here. That's what I'm talking about right there. Let's see if you can go even farther with it. You can close it. You can create a full bedroom here. And then let's give it to her the bedroom and then we can look out the window. Like a dog. But this is kind of perfect. This is a little nook with the bedroom area that closes off and then a living room area. I love this. Light. An iron in there. Got a pillow up there for our closet. Let's check out the bathroom. Very important. Ooh. Very nice. Pomeranian flavor. So you know it's good. Strong water pressure. And of course, guys, the most important thing of all, our bum gun. Oops. Let's open that again. Let's test out the bum gun. Yeah. The last thing you want is a weak bum gun. I'm not the first to say that and I won't be the last. Our toilet paper folded into a triangle so you know it's fancy. And let's check out the water pressure in here. That's the wrong one. Let's make this come out enough. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. But is it warm? Not yet. It's quite cold. Huh. Oh yes it does. Yep, that's warm. But we're not done. We've got to do the bed test. Of course. I'm just getting everything wet. First we're going to look out the window. See if this has access to. Yeah. And look, guys, we've got a pool. So we're going to have to go check out that pool here in a second. This could be a full video with it itself. I don't know how to shut the window now. It's locked. We'll figure that out later. But let's test out the bed and then we'll figure out a close the window. Oh, that's soft. Yeah. I can't say there. I'm going to fall asleep. I didn't sleep much last night. Awesome. Really. Nice artwork. I love this room. Really. This is about 70. I think the price on Airbnb was $66 for today. But you've got your fees after that and these prices fluctuate all the time. But I think Airbnb is the way to go if you're wanting to stay in BGC area just for a few nights. Instead of the hotels, I think the hotels are quite expensive in this specific area. We're going to test the Wi-Fi and then check out the pools. Let me figure out how to close the. Oh, there we go. Rocket science, guys. I'm a rocket scientist. Let's check the Wi-Fi. We're in. We're connected. Let's do a speed test. That's not good. That's the problem. See, that's the thing. Come on. Wi-Fi is so important. It really is. That's going to give you bad reviews if you don't have good Wi-Fi and you're in an area where you can definitely have good Wi-Fi. It's getting better, but that is still not good. Oh, we found a flaw. Yeah, I'm not going to be able to upload anything to megabytes per second. Let's go check out the pool and then check out the city. Actually, I'm in the middle of filming a different video, flying from the Philippines to the United States and I'm filming what that long process looks like and then in the middle of that video, I decided to make this video. Pool is on fire. Oh, function hall B. Not a lot of functions going on and function hall B. With something's going on in function hall A or C. C, no. A, yes. There's a function. And here's a spa and a gym as well. But first the pool. Yes, sir. Wow. And look at the view you get when you've got the pool and we've got two hammocks over here. See, I wish I had two days here. I wish I could have planned this trip a little bit differently because really, I just landed and tomorrow morning I'm going to leave here about 5 a.m. and then fly to the United States. The reason I'm making a video there is because it's four planes in a long trip. 49 hours if you can move this. So let's give the temperature a test here. Little chilly. But that's what you want on a hot day in the Philippines. You don't want a heated pool. We've got a nice breeze but I love all these open air areas around here. Look, we've got a few everywhere you're at. And this is the condo unit or just condo. 49 floors of glory. And then this, I think that might be uptown mall. So we're going to go check that out. I see a Starbucks. Wow. Where's the uptown mall? Uptown mall, this is our left side. Okay. And then high street. And high street. This street you can go. How far is high street? Maybe 5 to 10 minutes or more. Okay. And then we'll see the other one. Parade. Is that any parade? Where's that? Okay, I'll get on Google. I'll just look on Google. The staff here are awesome. Okay, look at this though. I don't know what this is right here. But it looks like a giant eye of sorts. Screen. All right, I got to save focus. Hello guys. I just showered. I'm feeling fresh, clean. But here I'll give you a shot of the condo that we're in from this side. Really nice places all around here. If I could have, I would have at least given myself two nights here at least because there's so much to see and do here. And it really is from everything that I've seen, the nicest area probably that I've seen around. It's really nice. That's for sure. But hey. I think I've made it to the center of the uptown area. Hence the the word uptown right there, uptown mall, uptown parade. I just bet a subscriber in the lobby is she was telling me that this uptown parade area has really good nightlife. It seems to be very modern, clean, plenty of upscale high-end restaurants and cafes. But I don't see anything Filipino really. I don't see the street barbecue karaoke quick quick by loot vendors. It doesn't seem like the Philippines that that I've grown to know. But I can't say anything bad about it. It seems to have all the amenities you could ever want. So we've got so much and I'm hungry. I haven't eaten lunch today. So I'm really excited for dinner. But we've got a million options. This is uptown mall. I don't even know. We're going to explore over here. So this seems to be somewhat of an outdoor mall up here. And then we've got security. Hello. Do you need to check the bag? All right. Thank you. And then here's an indoor side of the mall as well. Let's go this way. First let's look at some prices. I love Masha. Masha love a pancake. I'm not eating that but that would be good. That's $4.25. That's like $8 for pancakes. And the salad is $375. Yeah. That's more expensive here. Of course. It's not surprised. Sorry. I've got to walk around and see everything first. All right. Thank you. What is it? I actually like crab. Oh. I do like crabs. How do you say crab into garlic? Taliban is always sure. Ali Mongo is crab? Yes sir. Oh okay. Maybe. Maybe. I do want food but I've got to go see everything first. Yeah. I got to go make this video. All right. Looks yummy. Let me know. Masha wrap. All right. I keep speaking Gassaya. This one's Filipino. Kelly J's. Easy tiger. Anything you want. Really. You can get here and these everything's pretty empty. Everything's empty. For the restaurants, let's see if the mall is empty. Nice and air conditioned. In the mall, I'm not getting close. Ooh. Look at Christmas decorations. Very festive with Philippines. Filipinos love Christmas. Yeah. I'm not going to do much of a mall tour because I just don't know how to talk about it in the mall. I just don't know what to say. You know what a mall is. I can only say that it's really nice so many times and then it's going to get old but it is really nice. Ooh wow. So up here, we've got more food and drink options but it's an outdoor type of area. Got some jamba juice. I didn't know that was international. Starbucks. I did know that was international. This is really... I told you I can't keep saying that this is nice. I almost did it again. But it is. Wait. They have buffalo wild wings? No. This is... no. Are you kidding me? I'm sorry guys. This is even... I think I have to eat buffalo wild wings if this is... if this is actually buffalo wild wings unless it's a knockoff. Are you kidding me? You have buffalo wild wings in the Philippines? This everything just got put on hold until I figure out if this is buffalo wild wings. Hello. Is this buffalo wild wings? Yeah. No. Really? This is the same one as the US. Like the same menu. The same owners. Yeah. No. You have this in the Philippines? Yeah. Same thing. What? Same... same wing cooking recipe? Everything? Oh my goodness. Okay. Okay. I think... yes please. I think I need to. Okay. I'm sorry. We're gonna have to get some wing. You have no idea how happy I am. I live here in the Philippines. I've been here for more than a year. I love it. I live in the whole. Thank you. Yeah. So I'm out, Paul. I can't believe you have this here. I didn't know this was in the Philippines. Is this only in Manila? Yes. Only Manila. You have buffalo wild wings. Okay. All right. Thank you. We got a fan. It's a lot of my cool. I understand how ridiculous this is that I'm here. A, because I'm in the Philippines making a video and I'm eating American food and B, because I'm going to the United States to visit for Christmas tomorrow. But I have to give a review on how it is. If it is American, I think that's very important. So yeah, I'm gonna go wings. I'm so happy. It's my favorite food in the world. Wings. The problem is tomorrow I've got a 12 hour flight and then two other flights. It's three more flights to get to Alabama. The problem is if you eat spicy food the night before, that is rule number one before a long flight is you don't eat spicy food the night before. Asian zing is really good and I don't see the the garlic one that I usually get. I don't see it. What's it called? It's orange and it's something garlic. I don't see it. Yeah. Awesome. That's awesome. Yeah. Do you want to say hello in this one? Yeah. Hello. Yeah. Where are you from? The Val. The Val. I went to the Val. I made a video. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. You went through the Val. Yeah. Yeah. It's a mall in the Val. Yeah. Awesome. I mean you have the yeah the face paint video. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Have a good one. Nice meeting you too. Why are you so excited? Thank you. Thank you so much. Oh it's so cool. I didn't think I would oops there you are. I'm pointing the camera up there. I didn't think I would see subscribers in Manila since I never make Manila videos but I've run into three subscribers today here. It's awesome. Okay. We have to get weighing some not even looking at a burger. What was I saying? Sources. We got to go mild which is very unfortunate but we got to do what we got to do for the stomach. We're going to go traditional. We're going to do 10 and that's 695 pesos. So we got US prices. Yeah. I'm not just visiting here for a week from the US and eating American food. I've been here a year and a half. I'm allowed I'm allowed to do this if I only have one chance to to eat the wings here. Hello. Who's the? Stafford. Do you have potato wedges? Yes you. Oh you do. Okay. Do you have potato wedges but cheese? We cheese. Oh awesome. Okay. And how much do those calls? Here's your potato wedges. What are you doing? Okay. Yeah. Let's do potato wedges but cheese please. And do you have ranch here? Yes sir. Ah that's not like some of them I've seen ranch here. Okay. Can I do 10 wings? Small but these should not serve our bonus. Traditional? Yeah. With two can I do two different flavors? Yes sir. Okay. Can I do one sweet barbecue, one honey barbecue, do you have soda water? So the water. Yes sir. Okay. Can I have two soda water? Yeah. Do you want beer? No no. It's soda water. I think we can order dessert for the eat the wedges with cheese. But it should not smell sour. Sweet by the way. And two soda water. Yeah. And does that come with ranch? No sir. It's a traditional. Okay. Can I have the ranch also please? All right. Thank you. I cannot believe they have ranch. I've never I don't think I've ever seen ranch outside of the US but they have the American menu. I'm the first person to admit a million things that we do wrong in my country in the US. We do a lot of things wrong. However, one thing that we do right is wings, is buffalo wings. I'm almost always disappointed when I get wings outside of the US. I know exactly what I'm looking for and I'm going to give an honest review of the wings here at Buffalo Wild Wings. Okay. Thank you very much. So that my first I'm going to taste it without any ketchup. I'm going to go ahead and say that these are cooked perfectly well. Super crispy on the outside. Not too crispy, not super crispy but perfectly crispy. Warm and then soft on the inside. I'm going to put a little ketchup on there. Perfectly crispy on the outside. Thank you so much. Which ones are these? All right. That's all of them. Okay. Panic by review and see you guys. Perfect. All right. Thank you. The moment of truth guys, we have our wings. I don't care. Even which flavor is which? I have high hopes right now. I really do. Just by the look of these wings, it looks to be done right. This is the perfect size wing that you want. The skin is not redded but it looks crispy, deep fried, doused in sauce, which is exactly what you want. I'm talking. Let's eat it. They did it. Let me give it another try. This is an American wing from Buffalo Wild Wings, Uptown Ball, BGC, Philippines. If you don't know what ranches, you haven't lived. These wings passed the test. 153O. Can you find the user? Yeah, of course. Yeah, most of the time I post it on YouTube, but I'm sorry to post a lot more on Facebook. I got to show the prices here. So potato wedges, 195 cheese, this is 30. 6.95 for 10 wings. I got three soda waters, so 480. I spent most of my money on soda waters and then 35 for the ranch. Soda waters were almost as much as the wings. That was officially the most I've ever eaten in one meal in the Philippines. I really think it was. That was for you, so thank you. That was the last thing that I expected would happen today if I'm honest. I was not expecting that. I'm a bit ashamed of myself there, but it was delicious. Hold on, let's go for a walk right here. I know I'll give you my final thoughts here. And we go check out this other area called the Uptown Parade, which looks really impressive. A lot of people, but a lot of these little cafes and restaurants kind of in the middle here. You've got a you've got a dinny. A beer station right here. I mean, this is... everything I've seen is really high quality here. It's very impressive without it out. Everything I've heard has been true. And then that's a nightclub I've heard of as well, called Zylo. But I'm waking up about 4am. I'm not trying to go to sleep at 4am. Got a long flight ahead of me. Oh wow. I haven't walked down this area yet, but look. This is even more. We've got another Starbucks, of course, but more stores and kind of restaurants. Wow, look at all this. I like these little stand-alone spots. Every single one of these is selling booze as well. Hello! But no thanks. There's more. Wow. Okay, we've got Barcino wine restobar. Yeah, this is the parade. So this is where you would want to go out at night, I guess. But they're right. Everything they say, guys, I'm going to stay over here. This is pretty much the end of it, it seems. But this is kind of like another outdoor mall area. But the verdict is, yeah, the stories are true. However, it just, it doesn't feel anything like the Philippines to me. But it just feels like you're in a different country, honestly. So again, if you want to experience the Philippines, this isn't it. It's, it's also not denying that whatsoever. But you want to come to the Philippines or live in the Philippines and have the Filipino culture, or I guess the culture might still be here. But the real Filipino experience, it's not here. But really nice for what it's worth. I just said it again. But I'll probably, what I would like to do is come back and spend more time here. I'd love to spend more time here. A lot more time and just try everything. Hello. Coffee is too late for coffee. I just ate so much food. Try our vegan. But I already ate. Yeah. I have no more room. I just ate 10 wings and then potato wedges. I'm too full. Next time. Okay. So next time, what is the name? Sorry? Wild plant-based kebab. Wild plant-based kebab. Okay. And you've got waffles, and you've got chicken, but vegan. Yeah. Okay. It's all vegan plant-based, but you've got coffee, and you've got foods. Okay. Next time. Next time. All right. Bye. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. That's what's it called? Wild. I'll get it some coffee at wild next time. I want to come back here and stay several nights and give it a proper tour to really see what it's all about. But that is it for the BGC Uptown Tour. Here's a couple other videos from the channel. Thank you for watching this one and I will see you in the next one.
