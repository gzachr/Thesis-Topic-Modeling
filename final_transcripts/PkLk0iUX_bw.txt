 What do you love the most about the Philippines? This place is nothing like what they say it is on CNN or Fox News. Super developed, super clean, super safe. People, people are very friendly, lovely people. How would you rate the BGC Boy's party? But when I came here, I was surprised, where everybody showed me so much love. I know you're not going to want more of the DOSA Filipinos, but... Ah. Be open-minded and definitely just respect the local culture. I'll be taking a wrong DOSA boy's party. And of course, I'm going to ask some foreigners about the Philippines. Let's go. I'm here with, Kev. Where you from and for how long here have been in the Philippines? I'm from New Jersey. I've been in the Philippines for about two months now. Why do I want your first impression of the country? When I came here, I didn't really know what to expect. Like being a black man in the Philippines. But when I came here, I was surprised. But everybody showed me so much love. They welcomed me with open arms. You know, they showed me so much respect there. Did you encounter any culture shock? Yeah, definitely a lot of culture shock. But I've been rolling with the punches, but as far as culture shock, coming here is a slow pace. So coming from America, everything is go-go-go fast, fast, fast. And here is more relaxed. It's chill. So dealing with being so relaxed, I had to get used to that. And then the traffic, you know, stuff like that. What do you love the most about the Philippines? Since you have been here for two months, for two months. I love that everybody is, it's a family. The family culture is really strong here. Everybody is relaxed. They're not. Everybody is chill. It's pretty much the opposite of America, bro. Okay. And actually, I would like to invite you for the podcast and street interview.

And the people are incredible, but I already knew that would be a big. What do you love the most about a country? About a country? Yeah. I think the amount of organized chaos that he has. I like it when a country is like orderly and clean and nice. But I want a certain level of like disruption and craziness to it too. Did you encounter any culture shock when you moved over the first time? The biggest culture shock is I think Filipinos, especially like employees, they aren't really willing to negotiate on anything. Like they won't budge. Like if this is what it is, they won't say hey, I'll go beyond this. Like I have to talk to my boss, my boss is probably going to say no as well. That's probably the biggest culture shock. Because I'm used to like always negotiating and working through different things. But that does not exist at all. It's like Japan actually. And to any foreigner that wants to come to the Philippines, it's either to visit or even to stay. What advice would you give to them? Advice? I don't know that advice, but I've been to over 30 countries. The Philippines is a top three country for me. You need to not walk here, you need to run here. Because this is a gem that's going to get exploited fast. And it's going to be super busy packed and expensive. I'd see in the next decade like no doubt. In this 48 days that you've been here, have you learned any Tagalog word? I've learned Sige. I've learned my inet. It's hot. You know, it's because you know what I'm going to say. I can feel it.
