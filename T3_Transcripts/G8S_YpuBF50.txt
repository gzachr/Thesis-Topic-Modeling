 When you're sleeping you don't have a fan? You have? Let's look out the window here. What do we see? What does your husband do for work? Surbising the pandemic. The House of Luciao and Christine It really is something. Today we are visiting the houses of Luciao and Christine and this is obviously on the poor side of things. In terms of areas that you can live in, actually I wouldn't be surprised if a foreigner has never been to has never been in this area before. There is one thing that I did notice here and that's just how happy and friendly the people were. It's amazing. It just blew my mind. Now we all know Filipinos are happy and friendly but I mean this shocked me. Okay. Just an idea of where this area is. It's in Mandawi near the Guy-San-O-Mal. I had a hell of a time getting to this area. Because there are two Guy-San-O-Mals in Mandawi. So when I got a grab from Lappu Lappu to Mandawi, Guy-San-O-Mal, I had picked the wrong Guy-San-O-Mal on the grab app. So once we arrived and I realized my mistake that I'm at the wrong Guy-San-O, I asked the grab guide to take me to the other Guy-San-O. You know, I just pay him extra. But he couldn't because he had another ride waiting for him. So I thought, okay, I'm just going to go into this Guy-San-O, which I think is the wrong Guy-San-O. That's gasoline. Wow. Cool. And I'm going to make sure 100% sure that Lu-Shell and her friend are not here before I go to the other one. Because obviously if I take off to the other one, I realize she was there. I'm going to kick myself. Anyway. So I got a trike to the other one after realizing it's definitely the other one. So after talking to her on messenger, I kind of realized that this is not the right one. Okay. So anyway, I went outside. I got a trike. And it was 25 pesos. The trike guy brought me halfway to the other Guy-San-O. And then he said he can't go any further because it's a one-way street that we're on. I said, you know, well, you're the trike guy. Just find a way. Bring me there. Right? He said he can't because it's a one-way street. I said, then why did you bring me this way? Anyway, you know how it is in the Philippines. It is what it is. So I gave him his 25 pesos and walked to some bus stop. About a 10-minute walk to find a bus stop. I got on the bus to the proper Guy-San-O. Now this whole time I've been keeping in touch with Lu-Shell because I've been apologizing. Sorry, I'm late. So now I'm at the Guy-San-O, the proper Guy-San-O. And I message these two girls to ask where they are. As I was an hour late, due to the whole, you know, well, the grab said it took 15 minutes to get there. But they weren't anticipating how much traffic there was. And then it brought me to the wrong guy-San-O. And then the trike guy only... Oh, I got some water down here. I'm going to go say hello to the water girl. Here, I got water down here. It was only 15 pesos. I'm going to get one more water down here. Okay, cool. So that is the water girl. And... I met these people. These are really great people. They always say hello to me. Hello! Hello! Hello, right now. Nice to meet you guys. Yeah. Cool, cool people. The trike guy only brought me halfway. And yada, yada. It was such a mess getting there. So anyway, I did arrive at the right place an hour late. Okay? So I go inside the mall and I ask the girls via messenger, where are you? And they said to me, well, where are you? I said, I'm by the supermarket. They said they're on the way. I assumed they were in the mall waiting for me. And they were on the way going to walk to me. But it turns out they weren't even in the mall. I forgot where is Lucel. Hello! Oh, nice kite! Down here, no? Oh! And see, where was her house? I forgot. I forgot where she was. Lucel was down here somewhere. And we're basically going to see Lucel's house. Was it this one? No, not this one. I think one more. I wish I had asked her to wait outside. I can't remember which road she's on. Oh, there! Oh, sorry! Yeah, there you are. I forgot. Oh, there! Thank you. So this is the furniture that Lucel had. I forgot. Oh, there. Thank you. So this is the furniture that Lucel had. So this is the furniture that Lucel's father is making. Yes. Amazing furniture. It's not wood. It's like titanium. This is what her father makes. Yes. He is a specialty. Oh, my God. But it turns out they weren't even in the mall. Wow, this happens to me time and time again when meeting girls. Like, when you arrive and you tell them you're at your destination, they will then leave their house. This happens again and again. So yeah, they hadn't even left their house yet. Here I am apologizing to them. So anyway, you know, I meet up with the girls outside the main entrance and, you know, I asked where their house is. And one said, you know, she lives in this direction. Okay? And the other said, she lives in the opposite direction. And I said, I thought you guys were neighbors. Hey, what's inside here? Is it Buko? Buko juice? No? What? La la la. Well, the man is a drinker eating. Is it drinking or eating? Eat? Oh, okay, okay. Wow, hello. Oh, you're so cute. And I said, I thought you guys were neighbors, you know, I'm thinking, huh? This is weird. So anyway, it was a sizzling, hot day and a typical Filipino style. They dressed up like it's an Antarctic winter because they don't want to get dark. Okay, let's go down to the cell. We got some...look who's following us. It's karaoke, man. Yeah. Oh, yeah, this is the furniture that Lucia's father is... Lucia's father? Oh, Lucia's father. Yes, it's okay, okay, okay. You're so young. How old are you? How old are you? 43. Wow, same as me. Oh, you look like you're 23. 23. Okay. Filipino. Oh, here's Lucel. Here is Lucel. The amazing Lucel. We're going to come in with the camera and then we're going to go back outside. The two pretty girls are here. Okay, okay. Oh, they have a river. They have a river down here. Hello, baby. Oh, she's so cute. Is this your sister? No. Oh, okay. You have a little sister.
