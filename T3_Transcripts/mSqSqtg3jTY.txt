 Today I'm going to be talking about why people move to the Philippines. I'm here with my friend, Salam. And we're eating in Kashmir. That is very damn good. So today's video is about why people move to the Philippines. And I think people move to different countries for the same reasons all the people move to different countries. So, for example, people that move to Ireland, usually the same reasons why I would move here. A better life, a simpler life, usually because either you're unhappy with the country that you're from to be depression, to be your job, could be a lot of different reasons, right? So the reason why I moved to the Philippines, it was mainly to have a better life.
