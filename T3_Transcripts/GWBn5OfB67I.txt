I'm going to show you just how far away it is and see what's there Last time we were there I had something for some sort of allergy or something Now there's a geothermal plant up in the mountain It could be from that But who knows, I'm better than her I guess the baby is better than the protechne I will protect her So as you can see the plant isn't very far away at all We're just coming up on it now Finally we have a bit of some of our really bad weather this week So here we are So this is 300 meters squared And there's a small little dog here You're protecting it, good boy Good boy And then we have lots of gecko plants And there's a calamansi plant just down here Cattlemanse is a little lime Little lemon, little lime, it's greening colour It's quite sharp, quite bitter, but really tasty It's got some really nice calamansi shakes Look at that We have one That's quite big that, it's almost ready to pick isn't it Yeah No, they just fall off, you have to pick them Yeah, it's a big thing So those two need a little bit longer to go But that one at the bottom looks like it's ready to go isn't it? Yeah And these are the ones that can, these are long way aren't they from Juicin Yeah But they're getting bigger My cacao is chocolate obviously But it needs a lot of processing to make it really edible Because the cacao is very, very bitter Normally it makes it with milk And you normally find it as dark chocolate And then you just get different milk contents Depending on how much cacao content you want How bitter you like it, how sweet you like it You can add sugar to it, but we can have it naturally It's really good for your blood pressure though, walk cacao Now this one's getting bigger, this is like cacao as well It looks a bit different that one Yeah, it's bigger Ah, okay So these plants behind are obviously not on the land That's bananas, is it? No, that one No behind you, the big one Ah, that's a banana This one here, is that on the plot or off? No, that's what I did But it might grow over Yeah, but this... Yeah So from there So from this corner here To this corner over here And then we go all the way up to the back Three and a square meters, it's good sized plots You can always build on this as well Now you need planning consents to build a house in the Philippines You have to apply to somebody and pay money to register the land so you can build on it But you can always build a good one-two bedroom bungalow here Even free bedroom Even free bedroom, but if you just wanted a guest house here somewhere to stay What are you going to do with this cacao? Well, you can just dig it up and move if you want it too But I could always... I'd say probably move near this top end I think there was one top only but died Oh Yeah, that was almost gone Nice Yeah I could always put some bananas in here, plan a tree in here as well By the swan down you can always have a...
