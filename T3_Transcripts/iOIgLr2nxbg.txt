Philippines Ayala mall and as you can see I'm a pan around so you can see the excitement is in the air
people are here shopping and
people are having a good time with their family and friends and
Relatives and LisaD is here she's so cute haha

time here today
and LisaD and I we hang out a lot together and uh
We just have fun we sit down we talk chitchat
We talk about our family we talk about some of our friends and then we talk about our relatives and
Then we talk about some of our neighbors like today for instance
we have a neighbor that's having a christening yeah a christening now for those of you that don't know what a christening is it is
when you have baby in the Philippines and you know most of the Philippine peoples are what?
Catholics right? so Catholic Christians believe in christening now
When you christen a baby a baby usually Christened when their small , a little kid and if they go to the Catholic uh
Church and the priest they call them priest they don't call them preachers, the priest will take a little
holy
Water and he'll wipe it he'll rub it on the baby's temple or sprinkle it rather and that's called
Christening so that means that that baby is dedicated to a Christian Catholic Christian life
And that's what these people believe here now as you know or don't know 90% of the people here are
Catholics and the rest are some some are Muslim and some are Christians are
Protestant Christians LisaD and I are not Catholics we are Protestant Christians but just know
LisaD is getting ready to go to christening today after we get back home
And we have to go get our gift so that's why we here, uh we
Also picked up and I told you on a previous video live stream
we had to pick up our vehicle we had to get a tune up y'all and in the Philippines if you gotta do some car maintenance
Man guess what? you don't think we don't think you're gonna sit there and wait on ah ah haha
They really backed up and the best thing you can do is take yourself home
and try to get it the next day or maybe that later than later on that evening
but we had to pick it up this morning we left it overnight and we came and got it and guys it's running tip-top condition
and I only had to pay what did I pay? How much I paid? Three thousand
Huh?

follow me
excuse the
shakiness of the camera but I don't have a camera stick
but I do want to show you how busy it is here in
This mall so if you guys are planning to come to the Philippines Ayala mall
Is a place that you definitely want to plan on visiting
Now as you can see?
There is a lot of traffic here. I we're up on the fourth level so. I'm panning down
so you can see
What's going on they're having a big presentation over to you. I don't know what that's all about but
usually on every saturday you can expect some type of uh
___ presentation singing dancing acting a whole lot of stuff going down here
and the people here in the philippines are
mall hoppers hahaha
yeah, what I mean by mall hoppers is that it's know you know that it's very hot here in the Philippines so a
lot of people don't have aircon then we have AC so what do they do?
They go to the malls and they hang out a lot um buy things
Many of them go many of them don't, but they hang out
And they get relaxed and cooled off and then they go home and it's just a nice family way of spending time together
and cooling off at the mall so uh I
always want to
come to the mall with LisaD cause
For some reason she loves ayala, Ayala is okay for me
It's not one of my favorites one of my favorite, malls here is SM mall
I love that mall and also have there they have an SM mall seaside
I love that one as well they're huge bigger than Ayala
as you know or may or may not know, ayala mall had a huge fire uh in
the first part of this year actually in January of this year 2018 and one of the
major, things that was damaged was to called the metro
Department store , and so that that's not been back up
Yet, they're still building on it it looks like they're going to be opening within the next couple of months so
When they open up. I'm going to take you guys on a tour of it so you can see
but yeah man I do want to hang out with you guys
let you know what's going on with BobbieD where we're at what we're doing as you can see I'm panning around again and uh

Par so guys
I'm always happy and I always that love talking to you guys as you can tell I try to keep an upbeat
spirit at all times because there's no sense in being down I mean hey anybody can get angry and
Mad but it takes a pro it takes a a person with character and strength to keep up beat and
Motivated you know when you don't feel like sometimes I feel down and out but guess what?  I always keep a what? A smile on my face, hahaha
That's what you do man
You got to keep on moving and keep on living ain't no sense in holding your head down and crying a whining
Oh they did me wrong, yeah they did you wrong,,  it's okay
Recognize what happened to you but then realize that you have to keep going and you have to move forward
never let what anyone tells you or say about you
Cause you to get down on yourself because in the bottom line is
You're better than that and you can overcome any obstacle if you keep your mind focused
Derek have a best day. Buddy always a pleasure to see you man and for those of you guys

We talk about the Philippines that's a primary goal but we also talk about worldwide videos
Viral videos things that's happening in the world, and we're talking about motivational videos because if you don't know it by now
Motivation and being upbeat is what I'm all about and so if you are here for again if you're here
first time
welcome how's the weather there all the weather is fine man it is
whats called The rainy season and in the rainy season sort of cools off a little
Bit so we're in the 80s pretty much most the time when the summer time comes the summer time starts here in March
Okay, and when that comes man you talk about hundred plus ,, hahah
90s is normal most of time so
it's a beautiful country if you like warm weather climate and
For those of you that are in New York City I heard that was a really really bad time with the ice and so forth
Hey, Philippines is always a good place to take a break
Where's a good place to stay all right it depends on, where you going are you going to Cebu
Ransins are you gling to cebu?
depends on where you stay if you're in Cebu area I
suggest you try
Something that hotel used to call it the tune hotel
But it's different hotel now
There's, also a place called to Tokoyo T O Y,,, Tokoyo,, Tokoyo Inn
its near SM Mall actually is near Park Mall
No it's near jmall
It's near JMall their charge is about 50 us 45 US dollars a night
It's an excellent rate and they're clean and they have free breakfast
So that's one thing that's one place you want to look at if your coming to Cebu
another hotel
I'll go over there and ask Lisa D what it was I forgot the name I just used to call it the tune hotel
tune hotel t u n e but they changed the name.
It's a budget hotel so if you're on a budget that's an awesome place for you to go
Basically they don't have free breakfast. There but their rate is a little bit cheaper their rate is about
$35 US dollars a day
Hey LisaD, What's the name of that hotel, they used to call it the Tune Hotel.  What do they call it now?
Red Planet
All right that's it she just refreshed my memory. Memory it's called the Red Planet hotel and it's located in
It's a good location cause
it is actually
located right across from a Ayala Mall you can walk to Ayala Mall  from from Red Planet hotel and that's an awesome place to
stay as well guys
If you're on a budget
They charge you about 35 a night okay so also guys if you're looking for hotel options. I recommend you go to
AGODA.COM that's I'll spell it for you
AGODA
Capital like Apple
g.o.d a a
ADGOda.com
You join AGODA and they'll search for your hotels for you you just have to specify the rate you want and where you
want to be located and that's why I normally go to
book hotel and I normally get a very discounted rate and they will if you can find any hotel rate that's better than them
You give them the proof of it and they will give you a discount of the same amount but AGODA is great guys. alright?
alright guys
Anybody got any more questions before I have to leave?
cause we're getting ready to go ahead and go back home
And we're gonna go to our first christening I'm not sure if I can take pictures . I might try nd take a few pictures
let you guys see if they allow me I'm not sure I've never been to one before
but
it's been a pleasure
Okay, you're going to Cebu. Okay, yeah check out Red Planet hotel check out the Tokoyo Inn
Okay
so many Americans well
One of I don't think it's so many Americans I think that one of the issues is
How you carry yourself in the Philippines if you carry and behave in a manner that's respectful
to people and
that's
not overbearing and
Not trying to be snobbish and treat people mean you're going to be fine
the instances where those things happen are usually
usually  people going out of their way to be mean and that's not good but anyway that's it for now
This is BobbieD. saying Take care, God Bless, and PEACE!!
