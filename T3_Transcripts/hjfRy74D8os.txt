So guys, welcome to a new video.
Today we are here at Sugbo Mercado,
and guys, I didn't eat all day
because I want to try so many dishes here!
So, let's do that here in Sugbo Mercado.
Let's go!
So, Mads, what will you try here today?
Chicken.
Only chicken?
You're not going to try ballut here?
Oh, we'll try the ballut.
Yeah, maybe I will try it as well.
We will see.
So since we are in Cebu,
the first dish we need to try is lechon, right?
Yes, lechon.
So let's see where they have some good lechon.
So many options, guys.
Incredible!
Oh, ramen.
Ramen.
Look at this.
and it's a really lovely atmosphere here as well.
Seafood.
Yeah, plenty of seafood.
I really cannot believe how many food stands are here, guys.
I have no idea where to start,
but maybe I should start with the lechon, right?
So I found the lechon, guys.
So look at this beautiful piece of lechon, guys.
I'm so excited already.
Thank you so much!
No space at all...
It's a Sunday evening, guys,
and this place is packed.
You know, we had to look very hard for a seat,
but we finally found some,
and here is the lechon,
which I will try right now.
No spoons, no forks.
Just eat it with your hands.
That's some nice piece of pork, guys.
And you know what is best?
If you put some pork skin with it.
So good!
The meat is so juicy,
it just melts in your mouth.
You should try this lechon as well, Mads.
It's really, really good.
It's a really good one.
Very tasty.
Yeah, yeah, very nice, very nice.
Very juicy meat,
you can take some rice and put it in the gravy.
A really good first choice is lechon.
Could I have some pork sisig, please?
Yeah, thank you.
The next dish we're going to try is pork sisig,
one of my favorite dishes in the Philippines.
Thank you so much.
So this is the pork sisig guys.
we're going to try with an egg,
so no ballut in this market.
That's quite disappointing to be honest,
but we have some from sisig here.
I'm here.
What did you buy?
I tried to find balut, but it seems that there's no balut here.
What is that?
Sisig.
So this is one of my favorite dishes in the Philippines.
Sisig!
Really nice.
You can really taste the spices.
Very well flavored.
Yeah, the sisig is really good.
You want to try Mads?
The sisig?
Yeah.
it's good, but I know it's not your favorite,
so I will eat it.
To be honest, there's not much sisig in it;
most of it is rice, but anyway.
This sisig was amazing as well.
Now I will get some ramen for Mads.
What kind of ramen do you want, Mads?
Chicken.
Chicken, okay, I will look if they have,
let's get some ramen for Mads.
Hi, sir.
Hello, hello can I have some ramen, please?
Chicken if you have.
We don't have chicken.
You don't have chicken. Oh, okay.
Only pork and beef.
Okay, okay.
So no chicken.
No chicken for Mads.
So yeah, I will ask her what she wants then.
Mads I don't have so good news for you.
Why?
There is no chicken; they only have beef or pork.
Pork.
You want pork ramen, then?
Okay, I will get you pork ramen.
Thank you, love.
So one pork ramen it is.
Hello again.
Hello again.
One pork ramen, please.
Which one?
Pork.
Classic or spicy?
Classic.
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.
Come back in 35 minutes.
Okay, I have one question.
Do you know if I can find balut here somewhere or not?
Grilled balut.
Grilled balut.
There?
Yes.
Okay, thank you so much. Thank you.
So let's check out if they have the balut there.
And it seems here they have grilled balut.
Hello.
Hi.
Could I have the flamed grilled balut, please?
We don't have it, sir.
Oh, you don't have it.
Oh, that's so sad.
Thank you anyway.
Next time, sir.
Yeah, who knows?
Ah, not lucky; no balut again.
So sad, but there are a lot of other good options to choose from.
I'm so disappointed, Mads.
Why?
There was no grilled balut; they didn't have it there.
But it's in their poster.
Yeah, but they don't have it at the moment.
Yeah, so no balut.
When I finally want to try balut, it's not available.
That's my life.
Thank you, guys.
Here is your ramen, Mads.
Thank you.
You're excited. You're going to eat.
So how is the ramen, Mads?
It's a good one?
7.5/10.
7.5/10?
So it's not really good?
What?
I think I'm looking for spicy ramen.
Yeah, they asked me, spicy or original.
And what did you say?
I said original because you always say you don't want spicy.
It's okay.
See, you never can do anything good for a woman.
They always say they don't want spicy,
then you say original, and then they want spicy.
But thank you.
So what is inside there, Mads?
Pork.
Pork, yes.
Eggs.
And a lot of spices.
And onion leaf.
Yeah.
It's good.
So I will change 8/10.
8?
Okay, 8/10,
that's a better rating, but if it were spicy,
she would say 9/10 for sure.
So while Mads is enjoying her ramen,
I will try to find something else
while she will keep this stable for us.
Okay, Mads, enjoy your ramen.
What will I eat next?
Let's have a look.
Hello, you don't have mango pizza?
We don't have mango, sir.
Oh, you don't have? Okay.
I'm actually looking for mango pizza.
Oh, we don't have mango pizza here.
They don't have it here?
Yes.
Okay.
We only have pizza here in Sugbo Mercado.
Oh, okay, okay.
Yes, sir.
Okay, thank you anyway.
Thank you.
So not lucky with the mango pizza.
So, not with the balut, not with the mango pizza.
Hello, can I have four from each?
Pork?
Yeah, pork and octopus.
Four pieces?
Yeah, four pieces each, thank you.
This also looks delicious, guys.
You know what this is, Mads?
Takoyaki.
Yes, there are two with pork and two with octopus.
Looks delicious, guys.
So let's have one.
This is the octopus one.
Oh, really good!
So I guess this one will be pork, then.
Yeah, this is really good.
Anything else you want to try?
Sweets.
You want something sweet?
Buying sweets.
You want an egg tart.
Egg tart?
Portuguese egg tart,
or, as they call it in Portugal, pastel de nata.
Try it.
I will bring you one, and you want something to drink as well?
I will find something for you.
So our task is to find something sweet for Mads,
and I have a cool drink or something like that.
I already have an idea in my head.
So here they have some drinks.
Oh, cucumber pineapple,
this is something I would like for sure.
I hope it's not sold out as well.
Could I have a cucumber pineapple and a cucumber carrot, please?
A large one two times.
I love that, pineapple and cucumber.
Huh, great combination.
So enjoy your pineapple, cucumber.
The carrot one's nice too.
Cheers, Mads, on a great evening in Cebu.
I will try yours too, Mads.
Good.
Taste like four seasons.
I will keep this one with me.
Really good shakes.
Now let's try to find Mads sweets.
Hello, Miss, can I have two Portuguese egg tarts, please?
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Thank you so much, Miss.
Thank you, Sir.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Have a nice evening.
Here they are the egg tarts.
Cheers!
Cheers, enjoy Mads.
Really good.
I will try one and compare it to the real Portuguese one.
Mmmm!
They're actually quite good and crunchy.
Yeah.
There is a little bit of difference, though, with the one in Portugal.
This one has more the taste of an egg,
while the ones in Portugal are much more sweeter,
but it's really nice.
It's the first time you've eaten an egg tart, Mads?
Huh?
First time you try it?
Just here.
Yeah, and you like it?
Manilla is better than here.
What do you like more?
Manila.
What is Manila?
Egg tart of Tinapayan.
See, that is why I love Mads.
She's always so honest.
All bloggers go somewhere, vloggers,
and say, Oh, it's so good, it's so incredible.
If Mads doesn't like it, she will tell it to you.
She doesn't like it as much as the Manila one.
So if you are in the Philippines, eat an egg tart in Manila.
You want calamares?
Yeah, we will taste.
You want calamares?
Yes.
And I will buy tempura.
Here's your food.
Thank you so much.
Thank you, thank you.
You're vlogging, sir?
Yeah, I'm vlogging.
Oh, what's your channel?
Robbie Travels.
Robbie Travels?
Yeah, it's like this.
Okay.
Yeah, thank you.
Thank you, thank you.
Bye-bye. Thank you, take care.
And now my dessert!
Yummy.
My favorite tempura!
The tempura is really good.
Now let's see the calamares.
Quite good, but I like the tempura more.
This has to be my favorite, along with sausages.
But after this, I'm so full, guys.
I cannot eat anymore, so this will be my last order.
So, I will enjoy it.
Cebu Festival.
Sinulog!
So the last one, guys.
Trying to get all the sauce.
Really good sauce.
It's like some shrimp sauce.
No, actually, I think it's lobster sauce.
Yeah, really good.
I feel the taste of lobster in there.
Bye-bye, Sugbo Mercado.
I'm so full, guys.
We tried so many dishes over there,
all of them were so delicious.
I especially liked the lechon, which was astonishing.
So guys, I guess this was the end of this video then.
See you again soon on another adventure.
Take care, and bye-bye from Robbie.
Bye from Mads.
Take care, guys.
Cheers!
