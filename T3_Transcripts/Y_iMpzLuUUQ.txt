i'm sure you have one or two foods that remind 
you of growing up and your childhood no matter  
what country you come from or where you are in the 
world food can remind us of things from the past  
since traveling we have tried a lot of different 
food that people would have grown up eating  
7-eleven snacks from thailand murder back kaya 
toast and mango sticky rice while we have tried  
jollibee and curry curry in the philippines today 
we'll be trying some filipino snacks hand-picked  
by a filipino who has grown up eating these snacks 
they're awesome they're awesome they're so good  
i've selected none of these i have no idea what 
they are but before we get into the snacks michael  
needs a haircut not too big more but to a local 
barber in a local community can i show you let's  
explore this local filipino community in the heart 
of manila and then i will show you my authentic  
reaction to some filipino snacks they're all 
right not my favorite let's go like and subscribe
so welcome back all welcome if 
you're new here my name is josie  
welcome to my channel right now we're just 
walking on the way to a local barber for  
michael to get his hair cut i had a cut with 
this guy when we first got to manila weeks ago  
weeks and weeks ago it's like a normal barber 
it's not like it's a local two dollar bubble  
or anything like that it's a proper barber shop 
but it's in this really cool local neighborhood
we're walking through this like a really local 
street and we're seeing like kids like playing  
with their next neighbors on like the second 
floor and stuff and everyone's here saying hello
have a good day they asked me for 
my channel that was the cutest thing  
we got some puppies on the street here
all right so we're here at 
sleek farmers let's go in  
fresh out the barber looking looking 
snazzy he does a good job here he  
has a really really good job yeah looks 
good he makes me look 31 instead of 32.  
i don't normally this is my channel i can't 
plug people but i reckon if you're in manila  
if you're looking for a barber it's hard 
when you travel to fight above so somehow  
you stumble across this like a vouch you bet 
okay it's my first experience to a barber shop  
actually is it actually yeah you want to be 
on yeah come say hello hey again hey again  
so if you've been following my channel 
for a while you know that michael has had  
a business for a really long time now and 
it just so happens that he has employees  
from all over the world but a few 
of them are from the philippines  
so he's got one named sam and she's been with 
him for like almost five years now which is  
crazy so hi sam but we got given well she 
bought all of these filipino like snacks  
for us that she thought that might be really 
cool for us to try and there's there's so many
so we're gonna go through and try all of 
these snacks chosen from sam who lives in  
the philippines she thought that this would be 
good for us to try let's go oh and drinks okay  
okay whoa whoop don't turn it there's more there's 
more start with let's start with a coffee shall we  
so first of all thank you sam for sending me all 
of these things to try here in the philippines  
this is so exciting this is so cool and if you 
watch this and you have any other recommendations  
of what you think i should try or anything that 
we missed let me know in the comments below but i  
think sam has pretty much everything covered here 
by the look of it so we first we have this cold  
brew coffee it's black no sugar so this looks 
right up my alley i am not a big fan of like  
sugary coffee so oh yeah oh that's good that's me 
that's me every morning ice americano i like that  
but here we have mr brown cappuccino iced coffee 
ready to drink and this is 110 calories this  
looks pretty cool there is some sugars in this i 
think it's gonna be sweet but the can is so cute
got it
oh okay it's a bit watery it's a nice coffee it's 
it's slightly sweet um but it's a little bit more  
watery than milky it's really interesting because 
normally when you get like iced coffee in a can  
or something it's usually quite milky but this 
one's a little bit more watery than milky this is  
definitely another winner pretty much on the basis 
that it's coffee iced brew macchiato oh this is  
bose coffee so many of you were telling me to go 
to bose coffee you were saying that that's one of  
the only stores that do like local beans i think 
from the philippines i don't love sweet coffee  
but i can taste like the caramel syrup in this 
this is delicious below are you bose ice caramel  
macchiato or are you starbucks caramel macchiato 
first one i grabbed was this one it's the chippy  
flavored barbecue corn chips i don't think i love 
them so this one says product of the philippines  
i don't know i like the like crunchiness and 
everything they're all right not my favorite okay  
next we have these breadsticks this one also says 
manufactured in the philippines so let's try these  
okay these look like a little baguette a 
little mini baguette i kind of like them  
that's fun so these ones are jack and jill 
chippies flavored chili and cheese corn chips  
also made in the philippines i think this is 
like the pizza ones but uh chili and cheese
i can't open them either this is like what the 
other ones look like as well they're kind of like  
really thin swirly things okay they smell like 
chili i'm so scared oh okay i got nothing it's not  
chilly i actually like them better than the pizza 
ones there's no chili in that at all i got really  
scared there they're fine oh i'm so excited we 
have ube pillows from ushi enriched with vitamin a  
ube filled crackers they look like a little 
square that's like hollow on the inside
it's like soft but it's like crunchy and 
then in the middle there's like this like  
sauce like custard of ube i must 
love ube and i really like these
they're awesome they're awesome they're so good 
they're so good so next we have picado's roast  
beef flavored potato crisp roast beef oh i don't 
think it tastes like roast beef a salt crisp or  
something they're kind of flat they're really 
like long um flat really thin as well because  
they're actually pretty nice i don't think they 
taste like roast beef but they taste good things  
like roast beef you reckon now this i have to 
confess i can't lie to you guys i've actually  
tried this before the apple green tea brewed 
and bottled on the same day cool and clean c2  
i've tried this we're on the way to report 
a princess so and we pulled over the side of  
the road and i was like i really needed a drink 
really bad and i tried it and i was so surprised  
i loved it mmm this tastes like apple juice 
but better quite sweet so obviously there's  
a little bit of sugar in that but that is my 
favorite drink that's not coffee all right  
let's try the lemon version now i am a little 
bit scared because i don't normally like lemon
it's like a sweet lemon that's not actually bad 
it's not like citrusy salary okay so this one's  
super heavy i'm not sure what it is but before we 
try this one i've noticed that 87 of you who watch  
my videos aren't actually subscribed to my channel 
i know so if you can take two seconds to subscribe  
to my channel like this video if you like my 
content that would mean so much to me and it  
would really help my channel so there's 87 of you 
out there who haven't done that yet make sure you  
do make sure you do that for me before you leave 
and then let's try this one click choc nut king  
this is a product of the philippines as well i 
just saw so this is exciting this is super heavy
okay they're in like little
they're in like little um i can't stop dropping 
them so it's a little like like bar oh it breaks  
apart your mouth it's like a reese's pieces 
cup have you ever oh that is rich very flaky  
pretty good very rich you only need like one of 
them that's for sure all right before we go on  
let me know in the comments which one of 
these has been your favorite so far but let's  
see the roast beef ones like the roast beef ones 
yeah pta piatos cheese flavored potato crisps  
so just like the roast beef ones but cheese 
and i love cheese so i'm excited for this one  
it smells like cheese they're cool i like 
those ones standard crisp or chip really nice  
this is the chucky my chocolate buddy nestle 
number one kids favorite and if you watched any  
of my thailand series you know that i'm obsessed 
with milo which is basically like chocolate milk  
i love chocolate milk so do you like give these to 
your kids when they go to school or something like  
this looks like like something you'd put in like 
a lunchbox let me know in the comments below this  
has no flavor on it so it should just be plain 
breadsticks little baguettes yes little baguettes  
hmm yeah it's just like little like breadsticks 
sam he sent me so many things nova multi-grain  
snacks country cheddar flavor generally oh okay 
they're like like wavy kind of things oh very  
cheesy if you're from australia or anywhere that 
has grain wines this tastes just like a grain  
wave they're one of my favorites they taste like a 
cheese grain wave wayne wave grain wave i thought  
i'd gone through all the drinks like the coffees 
at least and i found another one she's giving me  
another mr brown caramel macchiato this one's a 
little bit way too sweet for me almost like a like  
a like a packaged um sort of like not real coffee 
coffee flavor if that makes sense but it does say  
100 coffee extract that's really interesting 
jack and jill cheese curls cheese flavored corn  
curls this tastes like twisties but these no not 
twisties the cheese and bacon balls oh they're  
pretty good there's a lot of air obviously around 
them so when you bite them they kind of fall apart
chili flavored corn snacks these 
ones look like like tortilla  
like chips it kind of looks 
like a mini taco little taco  
they taste kind of like a corn chip almost like a 
dorito i like the corn chip like i like the corn  
chip flavor and texture only natural shrimps and 
we call them prawns in australia so that's really  
cool they have prawns in the packet oh i got i got 
a whiff when i opened that and i did not like that  
that smells like the sea they're like a long 
stick with like like stuff on the edges like  
grained on the edges or something but they're not 
they're not bad once you eat them on their own  
pa toes again but these ones are sour cream and 
onion i don't mind them can't really go wrong  
with them they're really good they taste like sour 
cream and onion pringles and they're my favorite  
one so i like them now these are i'm not sure uh 
juice drink and this one says guyabano guayabano  
which i've never heard before i might try this and 
it does say filipino flavors um homegrown fruits
oh i like that
i like that a lot oh that's nice that's 
real nice i like that a lot all right let's  
try the calemancy now i've never heard of a 
calamansi before we came to the philippines
oh no it's a sour one i don't like it i'm so 
upset to be losing this when we do leave the  
philippines might be somewhere else if you know 
if calamansi is anywhere else elsewhere tell  
me because i love this clover chips leslie's 
cheese the day cheese the day like season day
they are super cheesy they're not full crispy 
and they're not like fall apart in your mouth  
they're in between not the best not the worst 
i'd say i like some of the other things better  
than that i'm obsessed with eggnog they're like 
little like crispy things they don't really look  
like cookies i kind of get the eggnog it kind 
of just tastes like a plain plain cookie to me  
kind of delicious though i like cookies so there's 
a big packet and they come with like little things  
inside it so it's like a little like round flat 
topped like chocolate obviously not my favorite  
kind of chocolate um it doesn't taste very 
is it milk chocolate it kind of tastes like  
cooking chocolate you know when you get cooking 
chocolate and it kind of like breaks apart part a  
prop breaks apart more easily than the other ones 
not not too bad not my favorite kind of chocolate
