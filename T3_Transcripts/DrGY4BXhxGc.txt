Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Ballots are in the basket. I saw it for the first time. This is 15 pesos for a piece and it is such a young and Japanese young.

I don't know how to eat because I try it for the first time. I'm baking chocolate eggshell first. I'm going to try this. Inside is a bit hard. It's very hard. It's very hard. I heard a friend from the Philippines saying I'm going to eat this soup first. Oh my god, it looks like a flower. I may not be able to eat it. It's very simple. I'm trying to taste its soup at first. Delicious. This is barely very simple. In other words, it's just a chicken block. I think it tastes similar to our shellfish block. I heard a lot it's usually served at night, it's also a pure loss. And the Philippines also enjoy night time. The appearance is a little bit gross, but it has a very good taste, especially the soup inside. No way. It's impossible to eat at all. It's not a good taste. It's not a good taste. I'm going to try it at all places in the world. Next, I'm going to try out of its egg here. It's a kind of a long way. It's not a good taste.

To add some taste, we can put some salt and vinegar. Thank you for watching. Thank you for watching.
