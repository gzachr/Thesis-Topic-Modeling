milestone and know when we drop our next
video
so today suzu and i's relationship is
going to level up once more
because she will be putting on makeup
on this 6.5 of her face
so some of the viewers told me in the
comment section that they want to see
my everyday makeup and i thought hmm our
channel
is about us not just about me
so i thought it would be fun to do my
everyday makeup on alvin
so i'm gonna use exactly the same makeup
product
on alvin even foundation
our skin tone is not the same so this is
this is my everyday makeup
so the first thing i use is this
moisturizer from corel
i'm gonna be just like a makeup future
oh that's cold just put a lot before you
apply
i have notoriously dry skin guys during
the winter
i don't want to waste my moisturizer on
this face
just for this video you're being so rude
wow it's so moisturized someone also
said that i could be a 12 out of 10 if i
do my eyebrows
so susie is doing my eyebrows
[Music]
does it look like a 12 dang my forehead
is huge
let's foundation right here i use bare
mineral
right light naturals or an eye so i did
just one push
i think you need a little bit more
because my face is a bit bigger oh my
god here we go stop smiling
oh my god i don't know how women do this
it feels so foreign
a few moments later
and after you apply i use the sponge to
remove the extra foundation that's on it
you don't want to look like you put it
on foundation
you want to look natural right i think
it's pretty obvious
i'm just toning
and just put no more chopstick on his
lips
my god so i use the eyeblow liner
from anastasia i love this it's just so
small i don't want to waste my eyebrow
liner on him so i just do a little bit
so basically you just do a straight okay
wow suzy is the best makeup guru around
very informational very pretty i love
it okay next eyelash curler i hate this
part
no don't be scared trust me
and then i use this japanese makeup all
book so i gonna use
the top one
[Music]
and then i use this brush that comes
with it
and what i like
about this eyeshadow is it's so easy
oh my gosh it's so pretty
oh i forgot of course you have to do
little on the bottom too
[Music]
and then i put the brightest color
how do i look everyone pretty much wow i
look like a thousand bucks
and then i use the brown eyeliner so i
used to
apply it my whole eye but then i stopped
it i just do it on the end
you see the difference wow
and then next one is mascara i only use
this maybe mascara
the best thing about getting makeup done
by yours i get to look at you really
close
okay next one is cheek and i use the
japanese one
i think this is soft bread
and then you put chips then the next one
is shading says
i bought this in japan oh you just use
all of it together so i mixed the
three color and i put it so it makes
your
face a little smaller i guess yeah and
you definitely need that
and then i use these two and you do here
[Music]
and then you blend it in with the
brightest color
[Music]
this is the highlighter that i kind of
use like balls in there
yeah it's like small powder balls so you
just
and apply the part that you want to be
highlighted
and then you do your chin
on top of your nose and then here
between your eyebrows and then nose
bridge
to finish it up i love this lip it's
from
i love this skull i need to buy a new
one
oh my god your lips are very dry
and then that's it
let's take a look wow
look at your eyes wow
wow close your eyes
[Music]
thank you gosh obviously guys
the skin tone and the foundation does
not mix
whatsoever it's the same color now
if you want to do the same makeup please
pick the foundation color that matches
your skin tone yes or else you end up
like me
you look like a drag queen to be honest
i like it respect them
yes i do too you know what what could be
my drag queen name
if you have any suggestions please
comment
down below and that is it my makeup is
as simple as this
is it's crazy just because i definitely
tell suzu that i like her with less
makeup because she already looks so
beautiful without it
but if she wants to wear makeup go for
it if she wants to feel pretty
with makeup i'm not going to say
anything
but to me she's always pretty even when
she's sleeping but when she's sleeping
she looks like an angel but she just
always has her hands raised like this
let me put on my glasses let me see how
it looks
okay everyone we hope you enjoyed this
