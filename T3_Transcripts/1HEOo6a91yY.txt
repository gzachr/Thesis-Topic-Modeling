the Philippines home for the next five weeks
we'll be backpacking around these Paradise
Islands together
we're here for some special reasons the main
one being to visit some of the most beautiful
islands on planet Earth
as well as attempting to climb Mount Apo the
highest Summit in the country
we'll also explore the historical streets
of Manila we'll go on week-long Expeditions
on traditional Filipino sailing vessels let's
have fun all right all in the search to find
out is it really more fun in the Philippines
[Music]
thank you [Music] and because the locals here
love to sing and obsess about karaoke we're
probably going to be having a good old sing
song along
I'm so excited to share with you the backpacking
scene here this country has opened up a new
side in me and it's a side I really like [Music]
welcome to the next level searching Paradise
in the Philippines
[Music]
[Music]
thank you
welcome back everybody Welcome to Cebu don't
worry we're gonna see more beautiful places
than a gray ugly car park I've rented a motorcycle
it's a Honda click it's covered in dirt it's
a bit dirty and it took forever to get it
it's like half past one in the afternoon already
so we have a motorcycle we have our freedom
bag and it feels really good it feels so good
to actually be back on the road yeah it felt
good to be leaving Cebu I'm sorry I didn't
share much of the city with you apart from
singing karaoke actually it was a karaoke
competition the night before in the hostel
they actually had a 15 000 peso prize cash
prize that a Filipino won so this is how serious
guys they take karaoke here and yeah I spent
a day walking around Cebu but it rained it
was miserable and it's not the prettiest of
cities and I was quite happy to be on the
road heading south no real destination just
me this new crappy rental motorbike the open
road and that feeling that I love of just
going in a general Direction with a general
idea of where I want to get to
it's raining
in the distance the direction we're driving
big black clouds so just pulled over here
gonna see if they've got a rain jacket 380
okay let's have a look thanks
what do you think
it's got a little window
I don't know why
ah okay
okay look at me okay let's continue
so this rain jacket looks like it's actually
gonna do a good job fingers crossed it keeps
me in my bag nice and dry and the window that's
built into the design I think it's so that
you can look at my sexy legs guys okay
if you do want the unedited raw footage of
my legs I head over to my only fans foreign
it's cold it's wet and I'm in my happy place
right now oh yeah babies back on the road
[Music] damn it feels so good to be back on
the road
been way too long since I've been back on
the road
I've missed the wind in my hair I've missed
the Roar of my engine don't know where I'm
going but I don't care I just wanna drive
anywhere the open road is my home and this
nothing that I traded for [Music] back on
the open road
true love back on the open road My One True
Love back on the open road My One True Love
back on the open road
foreign
[Music]
[Music] back on the open road
looks like a nice little Viewpoint actually
I would love a little drinky poos can I have
a water well yeah yes please a small one yeah
I've changed my mind three times since I left
the city about where to go I've just been
kind of reacting to the weather so heading
south wasn't really an option because there
was just so much rain um but then up towards
these mountains it looked clearer which it
is so I'm just gonna head over to the other
side of the island first and there's a really
famous canyoneering place called kazawan Falls
so we'll head there we won't make it today
by the time I got this motorbike and by the
time we got through Cebu traffic I mean it's
already three o'clock in the afternoon and
we've got two hour drive to go but like I've
just been singing I don't care really you
know it doesn't matter where we're going it's
just good to be back on the road you know
it might be a rainy miserable day but I'm
loving it so I'll just enjoy the rest of these
turns and I'll share with you where we end
up soon but yeah it's good to be back [Music]
so yeah it rained and it poured the whole
afternoon and I didn't quite make it to kawasan
Falls or the area that the waterfalls are
at instead I pulled into this town in the
pouring rain I was cold I was wet I was miserable
when I found a place to stay and I just explored
now luckily the town that I pulled in was
actually on the traveler on The Backpacker
route it's called mobile and there was restaurants
there's lots of hostels there was quite a
bit of nightlife live music and it was a cool
place for me to just pull in dry off and have
a couple of beers and enjoy some food luckily
guys luckily we pulled into this town because
well as you'll see the next day this town
has something very incredible up its sleeve
that is just absolutely next level foreign
[Music]
welcome to mole bowl and the sun's come out
and this place looks really nice it's actually
quite popular because it's a very famous natural
phenomenon here which we can check out which
is a bonus so the town of mole ball itself
you could probably see that back in its day
it was really popular and thriving unfortunately
I think it was really heavily damaged by the
storm that blew across the Philippines last
year at least the front of the beach everything
seems to be destroyed now the star of the
show is the crystal clear waters and there's
a reef and the natural phenomenon is there
is a huge ball of sardines that you can swim
with and you can go on tours you can see people
out here going scuba diving scuba diving in
this sardines would be incredible because
you'd be able to go underneath and swim through
them or you can go snorkeling and just swim
around them and maybe swim down if you can
hold your breath and they're trying to sell
you tours all around here but I've just flown
the Drone and I've seen where everyone's swimming
thankfully the Drone I sort of saw a group
of people swimming flew the Drone overhead
and then as I went up into the sky I could
see the big ball of sardines so we know where
to go now so what we're going to do is we're
gonna rent a snorkel get some flippers for
like 200 or 300 pesos we don't have to go
on a tour we'll come into the reef I've seen
some Filipino people being dragged because
obviously they can't swim and their tour guide
is just dragging them along with a boy they're
swimming along the reef which looks beautiful
in itself maybe we'll see some beautiful animals
some tails and then we'll make our way to
the big ball of sardines we'll swim with the
sardines for as long as we can and we'll swim
back and we won't have to pay to go on a tour
we can just do a DIY sardine tour so let's
go rent the the equipment we need back in
town
[Music]
you can get your snorkel you can get some
nice rubber shoes because of the rocks are
going to be Sharp and you can even get yourself
some nice Filipino food here spring rolls
sausage is it yummy yeah I'll have some after
I'm I'll be hungry after my swim 100 yummy
use this oh you think that's better yeah because
you drop uh it feels drop is all this well
yeah I don't want to lose another piece of
gear
yeah
the second that I got into the water I could
sense that this was going to be a great experience
the visibility was immaculate and I swam out
about 10 minutes to get past the reef break
into the deeper ocean which was a little bit
disconcerting once you see that drop off it
goes from five or seven meters deep down to
well I don't know you can see the bottom once
you negotiate swimming past a few groups and
a few other free divers and swimming around
the bubbles of the scuba divers deep below
and eventually swimming out to the deep ocean
and heading towards where I could see a few
heads bobbing onto the surface I found the
outer rim the giant bowl of sardines and the
slightly chaotic but unbelievably magical
experience started to unfold [Music]
of course the sardines were the highlights
and after that it was watching the free divers
going deeper than I could ever imagine swimming
down to 10 12 15 meters sometimes and coming
back up taking awesome photographs they were
just Majestic
hmm and every now and again you'd catch up
with the crowd and he'd be surrounded by people
but because I was on my own and because the
ball of fish was so big you just swim away
and you get a little bit of space and time
to just be with the fish and imagine that
you're some kind of mermaid
after about 45 minutes I'd had enough and
I was tired but there was one more magical
experience waiting for me on the way back
to shore as I was swimming Across The Reef
this little fella popped up foreign
[Music]
[Music] just wanted to quickly mention today's
sponsor Squarespace these are the guys that
I use to create my website now making a website
can be very difficult and stressful especially
if you're trying to set one up for your new
business or something like that and I don't
know anything about coding you don't need
to pay somebody to do it for you you can just
go to Squarespace they have these professional
portfolio templates I personally chose this
design here and I think it looks great and
I was able to really easily add my own pictures
my own videos I've got different tabs and
I can link my social media accounts so people
can just see what I'm up to within an instant
and I've got membership areas coming where
I can start to sell products that I'm making
so yeah I really recommend Squarespace I think
you should head over to their website and
if you do need a website start designing one
for free right now and play around with your
own images and make it look how you want and
I promise it's not that difficult and then
when you're ready to launch it head to squarespace.com
forward slash Paddy Doyle and they'll give
you 10 off so enjoy and let's get back to
the video
so yeah the next day I decided to leave mobile
and push on and head towards kawasan Falls
the famous canyoneering and beautiful waterfall
of Cebu where many many people including many
YouTubers come to jump off cliffs and push
your boundaries have fun and have a real Adventure
in the canyoneering and a beautiful waterfall
as a finale however I can't quite share the
same experience because as I was driving around
and enjoying the roads I could see a lot of
damage and a lot of Destruction and it turned
out that a few days before my road trip in
Cebu there was terrible flooding and a huge
storm and when I arrived at The kawasan Falls
turn off a few locals had told me that unfortunately
it's closed today
so since it was closed and the official reason
was the flooding had caused too much destruction
and so the kawasan canyoneering had been canceled
completely and that the waterfall was now
um yeah shut now don't worry this is not an
indefinite thing but if you do go to Cebu
and it has been heavily raining for a few
days just yeah just be warned it might not
be open at this point I was just driving around
thinking well what should I do now and then
it dawned on me that my good friends will
and Jose lived on Cebu for about six seven
months I believe so I quickly text them I
said hey guys I'm in Cebu kawasan Falls is
closed I don't know what I should do I've
already done the city I've already done mobile
any recommendations and they sent me a Google
map link to some Mountain viewpoints they
said it's gorgeous up there and I had to drive
up and I had my motorbike so I thought hey
let's just turn this around let's head up
the mountains let's use will and Jose's directions
and hopefully we'll find something incredible
to challenge and I was having quite a nice
time for the first 20 minutes there was a
paved road and it was winding through the
mountains and I could see the sea behind us
and it was quite nice but then I've just arrived
here and the road has seemingly been destroyed
by a landslide I'm not quite sure what's happening
so I decided to fly the Drone from this point
just because I I know with my little Honda
click there's no way we're gonna make it on
this I mean look at it it gets ridiculous
so I was thinking okay is there any way I
can get up here and I tried a little bit and
I thought no no this is stupid I mean I'm
on a little rental Honda click you know this
is not the kind of bike you know it's a rental
it's not doesn't belong to me if I tip it
if I drop it it's going to scratch the Bodywork
if I had Zelda and I didn't have this big
bag we'd head up there no problems but that's
a rental and when I flew the Drone this road
continues to be muddy continues to be extremely
steep it winds up into the mountains and it
kind of seemingly just goes up into a almost
a vertical and eventually it gets spat out
on the plateau and I think that's how you
get to the summit but on a little Honda click
um there's a rental and the state of that
road there's no chance we can do it so we
aren't going to have much luck on this road
so I'm gonna have a little look at Google
Maps and see what we can do because I'm not
going to give up yet casaban Falls wasn't
an option this road is no longer an option
I can hear a motorcycle let me ask this guy
are you going to awesome awesome
this road is so bumpy yeah it's impossible
no it's very bumpy yeah but you gotta you
gotta a good bike I have a rental I can't
use this that's why they're over there so
which road do I go uh going to bed
in town yeah 
you turn left okay thank you yeah okay safe
journey up there yeah thank you you're welcome
Russian let's get on the old Google Maps here
okay there's bad Yan
Bajan Highlands okay so we do need to go the
other way so we're gonna head back down to
bazyan Market and we'll try again and according
to Google Maps we turn left here
and hopefully this is the road wish me luck
slight delay
that machine up there is digging away at the
rocks and then they're falling down and smashing
onto the road
so I think we just wait here until he's finished
oh that's a big one
so yeah I just think we wait here until they've
finished destroying the dangerous rocks otherwise
the road's been fine they're behind me this
is the road this is the road
so they've cleared away the rubble
and cleared a path so we can continue our
journey
[Music]
this is definitely my favorite thing I've
done in the Philippines so far just driving
along in the provinces up in the hills getting
lost problem solving trying to find our way
to somewhere beautiful this way have you got
food there is that yummy yuff is that chicken
adobo oh okay that okay I'll go up there I'll
come and eat with you afterwards okie dokie
thanks buddy high five
getting to the start of the trail was an adventure
in itself but I wouldn't expect anything else
in rural Southeast Asia you know what I mean
okay so when you start the trail there's a
little house and you pay 150 pesos for your
entrance and you get a guide so I've got this
lovely lady called Anne and she says there's
a 20 minute walk to the highest point there's
a sign that says it's the highest point of
Cebu there's beautiful flowers fresh air you
can't beat it
okay nearly there it's got to go up onto that
Peak there is that right Anne yes here we
are The Summit of awesome in a peak just a
few more steps to the top one two three four
okay this was definitely worth it hello Anne
getting lost in the countryside fun little
problem-solving mission trying to find our
way around and up to the toll but we're here
and look at the geography of this place all
these spiky Peaks thousands of them in every
direction I'm not quite sure how they were
formed but it's it's Unique extremely beautiful
great place to take a picture a great place
to catch your breath feel that breeze and
look down upon the beautiful Bays of mobile
and Cebu Island itself and it's obviously
a fantastic place to fly the Drone
[Music]
okay so from the top of awesomeena in the
distance there's another Peak called Casino
Peak and it's another Viewpoint so we'll go
over there as well so first me and Anna just
got to walk back down the way we came and
then we'll go find our way over to the next
viewpoint [Music] foreign
[Music]
thank you [Music]
[Music]
[Music] thank you
[Music]
now awesome Mania Peak which is behind my
left shoulder over there that was lovely that
was beautiful but here you don't get a guide
so it's a bit more of an adventure if you
ask me in the trail actually at the very very
end of the trail you do have to sort of climb
up some sharp jaggedy rocks to sort of peek
over the top so it is a little bit more challenging
but much more rewarding I think because you've
got this beautiful Filipino flag here just
flapping in the wind and the views here are
much better because you've got a much more
360 View and you feel a bit more like a real
climber getting up here especially at the
end when you're clambering over that rockety
cliff and it's just gorgeous you know it was
a shame that kawasan falls in the canyoneering
something that Cebu is so famous for isn't
available for us to experience but that's
okay we came and we searched for another paradise
and we certainly found it up here in the highlands
of Cebu I mean this is gorgeous I saw this
on will and Jose's Vlog you guys did a great
job and you tempted me to come up here and
even though you gave me the wrong directions
I still love you guys for sharing with me
and via my channel to my audience now there's
more to Cebu than just kawasan Falls and oslob
which is where you can swim with the whale
sharks it is on my way home I have to drive
back to Cebu we haven't quite finished the
adventure yet because I want to tell you why
we won't be swimming with the whale sharks
because well let me get down there and I'll
show you why
[Music] foreign [Music]
[Music]
okay we've made it to the east coast of Cebu
just up the road from oslob which is where
they have this very famous activity let me
explain a little bit and then you can let
me know what you guys think so basically what
they do is you go out on a little wooden boat
and you don't go very far out to see and there
are huge whale sharks the largest fish in
the world and they swim in a circle and you
can interact with them swim next to them take
pictures near them and on the surface it looks
incredible but here's the thing a long time
ago someone decided it was a good idea to
go out there and and feed these whale sharks
that swim here throughout the year on their
migration around the Philippines because whale
sharks migrate constantly to mate to feed
and their fish right so they they need to
move around and here in oslob they started
to feed them and they got accustomed to getting
fared they liked the food and it was a lot
easier for them just to sort of swim in a
circle come back every morning get fed every
day and then they sort of started selling
these tours where Backpackers and tourists
from all around the world will come here and
they'll go out on the boat trip and there
are rules in place you're not supposed to
touch them you're not supposed to hit them
but I've seen quite a few Vlogs of my friends
going there I remember when Carl Watson went
there and he documented it for his channel
when he was sharing his Filipino adventures
and well look this is what happened when he
went the thing is they sort of say to you
or you've got to keep your distance from the
whale sharks but the water's so crowded with
so many people and there's so many boats that
you get in the water and you're like try not
to bump into anyone else try not to smack
your head off the boat and before you know
it there's a whale shark come underneath your
feet and your depth perceptions officer in
the waters you don't know if you're going
to kick it in the head or in a bin and there
was a part of me that wanted to kind of still
go and still do it to see if it had got better
if things had changed but just looking on
Google Maps you know I click on the link to
head down there and the first picture I see
is this poor whale shark covered in Barnacles
because the issue is is because they're not
migrating because they're not moving around
they're not getting cleaned they're not getting
the right skin care you know there's little
fish that come and eat the the bacteria off
their skin or whatever and they're getting
covered in Barnacles they're getting scars
from flippers and boats and other things and
it just looks like a bit of a cluster [ __ ]
and not really something that I want to promote
because I love whale sharks and I've swam
with a whale shark inco PP and it was an incredible
experience to see it in the wild and I just
think seeing them in that state it might be
some good footage it might be wild it might
be very outrageous and certainly interesting
but I just don't want to promote it on my
channel because I just don't fully agree with
it so you can have a different opinion to
me that's fine but this is just my opinion
and why I'm not going to oslob to share something
that the Philippines is very famous for and
what the Cebu is very famous for so Sam was
going to call it here guys I think I'm going
to keep driving up to Cebu get back tonight
rest up and the Adventures Continue in the
next episode
next time on Next Level Adventures [Music]
thank you
