 As tiempo quesco Yep. Good morning another day another dollar to span. Today I only got Jason so he while you do he is preparing the concrete work. Let's see if we can get somebody else tomorrow. But in the meantime I will ask him to do the skim cutting or around the house as much as possible until we get some help for the concrete. Okay, where do you think? So many problems. I always have to put the tiles but I can pull this out easily and put the tiles in but just for now. But I'm very lucky because Jim is cooking a nice adobo here. And we are going to sit properly on that table because I'm going to chop off the trees now and add a lot of work already so far. So let's chop off those legs. Yeah, I put the mark there already so that we can sit properly. Let's do it. Yeah, no, not like this. Maybe you can try like this like this and just run the cyclos along it. Where is it? What a pan. I don't need that. I don't need. I mean you can mark if you want but yeah that's it. I just follow. Okay. It's just over now. I just make sure. The view is nice. It was okay. Nice view that I add the back. Okay, ready? I took two loads. Nice. Nice and square. Here we go. It's good. Alright. Okay now we can sit properly on this table. And this adobo is wet in for us. Anyway, cheers. Oh, senti. I'm going to fill up. World Blackberry. You want some? World Blackberry. Shit yeah. Cheers. I'm hungry. Can I eat? We're getting there. Cheers. Put it up a little as often. I don't eat rice. I eat daddy. Yeah. Go for it. You get the legs. Yeah. Beautiful. I'll wet for my chips. You wash your hands. I did. Of course. Oh, it's about time we get this table like this. And then of course we lie to give it a little planning on top. Give it a little planning on top. Some vanishes. Every way. Sorry, this is solignum. Every way. So it's pretty well protected. That's exactly what I love. French fries are running egg on top. And my wife, beautiful chicken adobo. She's plenty more to it. So on a comfortable chair and table. A class. Slowly, slowly. Free pretty cure. Well, this is our watching. Huh? Boom boom. I'm really having hard time here. How about you're going to charge me? Free. Oh, oh. Wow. It's been running quite a fair bit. So we got all the tanks. Oh, trash bin full. Which is good. Okay, just finished those rebar preparation. Ready to pull the concrete on. But there's nobody only him. So I'm going to wait for reinforcement. Hopefully tomorrow. In the meantime, he's sharpening his blades to do a skimcoating of the house. So not much happening today, I'm finitely. And Jim and I will be tired from the trip yesterday. I'm sorry working on the video yesterday of Kageyandeoro. That trip. And that's probably most of the thing I'm going to do today. It's going to be a bit of a quiet day today. But. And the other problem. Jason will come back from lunch because this big rain coming up. We'll see how we go. We picked up a lot of rubbish here there. But it's so hard to burn it off because it's always humid or raining. Okay, Jason has skimcoated the whole wall now. Especially the upper section wasn't done. He found the way of reaching it. Hmm. It's darker this way. But. So tomorrow morning. Rough polishing. And I will start painting three coats. Two flat white. I want semi-gloss. Then I'll be able to close all that down. Although I still got a lot of work. But I like to do this because the baby can then play around here. And we don't have to worry. So that's it for today guys. See you in the morning. Jason will come back from lunch because this big rain coming up. We'll see how we go. We picked up a lot of rubbish here there. But it's so hard to burn it off because it's a lot of rubbish. And I'm going to start painting. I'm going to start painting. I'm going to start painting. I'm going to start painting. I'm going to start painting. It's so hard to burn it off because it's always humid or raining. And. Okay, Jason's working on this side of the brand. So it's good. I can't get it done. Okay, Jason has come caught the whole wall now. Especially the upper section wasn't done. He found a way of reaching it. Hmm. It's exactly the sole. But tomorrow morning. Rough polishing. And I will start painting three coats. Two flat white. I want semi-gloss. Then I will be able to close all around here. Although I still got a lot of work. But I like to do this because the baby can then play around here. And we don't have to worry. So that's it for today guys. And see you in the morning. Hey, good morning everybody. Another day. Another peso. Today we're going to restart again on the concrete. Junior is back. So we're going to continue making some more concrete. And put it all that. And then we're going to start painting. And then we're going to start painting. More running coming up. Okay, given idea, two people that saw they're done half of that. It's not too bad considering the heat. So I'm going to need another probably three days to go down there. So probably by the end of the week. We should be just past the gate area. I hope so. That's having good time. I don't know. A few minutes ago we had a big torrential rain. So the boys went home. This small rain coming for sure. So I think they did the right thing. So it's not much done lately. I'm going to do the euro and rain. As if I can do something inside the house. But I'm having issues with the sink accessories. It's all I install everything. It's all leaking. We can't put any glue because you need to. And do those things from time to time to unblock it. I need to do the hard way. I see if I can find the right stuff. I just make it very simple. So yes, it does to thank a full anyway. No problem. That's a good thing. I went to the nearest town to buy some more cement. And the boys will come back on Saturday. Because Jason's got his little one. He needs to take to the doctor tomorrow. Probably depologues. It's going to take the day. So he's not going to show up tomorrow. And Julius is not going to come neither. It's very hard to work on the me. So nothing till next Saturday. So I was going to say before I did the assemble everything for the kitchen sink. And test it. It's leaking just about every way. I try to make sure the seal is right on the rod position. I don't know what's happening with this thing. It's probably so cheap that I don't want to put any sealant and glue. It's not a way to do it. So I'm going to run something very easy. From the strainer I'm going to put a flexible hose which I'm going to bend it. Make the peat drop if you like. And then we just go through that hole. That's it. Let's make it cheaper. Easy. We use the system in manufacturing engineering. It's called KISS. Keep it simple. KISS. Okay, today's a very quiet day. Tomorrow's going to be a very busy day because I'm going to start putting together this 13A visa. I have 13A visa application. I have all the things we need to do. Tomorrow we will go into many places. Immigration to ask a couple of questions. NBI. Printing paper. We need many things. PSA. For birth certificate, minor certificate. You get a copy of the lab. So anyway, we'll go through it more thoroughly. I'll probably do a video about it. Just let you know that we're not going to do it much in the house. I'm stuck with a sink. I got some parts missing. So I can do much. I like to buy some tiles. I can do some better timber work all around. Install the tiles. Then I will install the sink properly. That's probably the way to do it. I thought I could do a quick fix for GM to wash the dishes here. But I've got things that doesn't fit very well. Licking. I'm not happy with that. I want to do something much easier. That's why we stuck here. The bathroom is something. I need extra income for my tiles and things. I can work out the position of the hole and drill. But that's not a... An hour or two work. That's not much at all. I will do when we get the tiles and things. We will get into it. When Justin is available. I think the boy did well to go. We had another big round few minutes ago. So no much we can do today. They'll be back on Saturday. The little garden is going well. All those plants. I'm going down. But I think they will go okay after. See how we go. The story of the day. How about His reputation? Very good. Because of his parfum. Very good. Very nice. Yes. Yeah?true this one. This one is very ready, let's go some problem. Okay, well my kitchen bench, this is what we're gonna pick. We can't get anything better than that. So that's the towel and that's the edges. And I will do some scurting as well in the front. Not big, just about maybe three or four inches. And I will do also the wall one for the wall. We'll do the same, same towels. I don't wanna mix anything, just all the same, I guess. So we'll see, they want to get all that for me. And I bought a thing for the sink as well. The pipes. All here. Just temporary drain. We will have a strainer so it's nothing big going there. And very easy to unlock, unblocked because it's under the house. And we can have access, easy access. That's it. Am I too darling, I'm waiting there. She's been so popular, I'm at least 20 people around her. But they all get out when I come back. That's gonna get a drink, huh? God, she's very popular here. She will go with anyone, she loves walking too. She knows how to do her steps. She could just... Okay, here's our stuff. So, three boxes of 60 by 62 bags of cement, glue. One for the grout, anti-bacteria. So I will tell you how much is all that. He's already wanted to leave deep below in busy hours. Everybody going home, it's terrible. Thank you for watching this video and to the next video. Take care, God bless. Thanks for watching.
