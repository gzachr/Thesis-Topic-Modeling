 Oh, I can go out and put it there. I'm trying to improvise. I thought that was champurado. It kind of looks like an... I will admit it does kind of look like an... But what is it? It's the leftover that I made yesterday when I got loaded. And then it's a tablaa and sagging and a little bit of coconut sugar. Mixed together in a bowl. Cinnamon and cinnamon mixed together. And that's getting up in a bowl. That's going to be a... Snack for the day, buddy. Snack for the day! There we go! I'm gonna eat it. I'm gonna eat it. It's going to be awesome. Uh, sure. Where is this one from? Oh, dude, it's just... Here, smoke. This is the one we got yesterday from your buddy. Okay. What was this? Hold on. Hold on. The corn syrup. I learned a lot from the next one. Here we go. This is from Davos on North Day. Davos on North Day. Oh, actually, dude, I can smell it from here. Give me a sniff. Smell it. Yeah, okay. This is really top notch. Bro. Are you making that one? I already touched those ones. I can smell it. I can smell it. I can smell it. I can smell it. Yeah, it's good. Crazy good. Davos, what's the name? What's the name? Selingen. Silaghan. Ever since I went to Mexico, I'm obsessed with your gal. The active compound in Kakao is steel bromine. It opens up your arteries and makes you feel more alive. That's a fact. Back to my ketals? No. Faturo. Faturo. I don't know how to do it. It's a medical. It's going to bubble over, man. I think I've heard rumors that the key to making tablia. You need to allow it to bubble like that. No, it depends, honestly, it depends where you're from. Like every country has their own way of doing it. This is definitely not the way to do it. This is like the short, easy way to do it. But in Mexico, for instance, you don't actually boil the water. Like the water doesn't get your boiling liquid. So what do you do? They steep tea and the water after it gets to a certain temperature. They strain the tea. It's like a viscous flower, ginger, cinnamon, some sort of citrus. You strain it and then you add the Kakao and then you stir it. And then you let it sit. And this sit here, we go bacterial. Yeah, bacterial. And then they, in Mexico, they blend it. And it gets nice and frothy. And then you see all the rainbow color bubbles from the fat and liquid cow. I'm going to do it one day. We're in Almasche. Is there no rice in here? No, it's just cold shredded coconut. It's good, right? Wait, is it...no, hold on. Are we eating the grinds from the Kakao good that have already been milked out? No way. You're not tasting it. This is awesome. Put the old grinds from the coconut he cagurated yesterday that have already been milked out. Into this bowl. That is awesome, dude. Because yesterday when we were talking about a chopperado it inspired me. Because I know you used rice, but this kind of... That's why I thought it's cheparado. This is a genius, like rice. This is a genius idea. This is a genius idea. This is a genius idea. This is a genius idea. This is a genius idea. This is a genius idea. This is a genius idea. This is a genius idea. Can you hear the chainsaw? Momarose with commander. Actually, commander went with momarose to Davao. She's not around right now, but I think Mike's working on his house. So I can hear the wood being a chainsawed over there. What a morning. What a unique breakfast with Brett. I'm headed to... Well down the coast to see how the surface for the guys.

It was really nice. There's been a straightening guy around. He's actually been here for quite a while to come friends with a lot of people in the area and he's telling me about how when he was going around on his motorbike and exploring. A lot of people were like, call him Kulass sometimes or they think that he's friends with me. And the cool thing was is when they were talking to him about me and talking to him about like my name and stuff, the vibes he said were so positive. And it was like, yeah, cool, your friends with Kulass are, hey, rad, like, oh, it's Kulass, like, and that was super nice to hear because, you know, I hope that, you know, the vibes that we're bringing here and I hope, you know, I feel that like at least the vibes of myself here in this community are super positive and I hope that's carrying over to other people and I hope that the locals as well as foreigners both continue to respect each other in positive ways. And yeah, just stoked to hear that. Also kind of funny. Golden hour, I think Brett is going swimming. We're going to chill and I want to go to the hot spring tonight because hot spring rules.
