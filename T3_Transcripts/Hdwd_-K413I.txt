 AHHHH!! I'm a mystical creature. What is your name? My name is Alfie. Oh... Welcome back everybody to another Philippines reaction video. As you saw by that intro, we're ready for this one. We're going to be reacting to the Metro Skyline. Yeah. 10 Mythical Creatures in the Philippines, part one. So they're just gonna go over like urban legends or something in this video of like creatures that lay in the jungle. And are they only gonna go over five of them since it's part one or they maybe go over 10 and then do another 10? I don't know, it's quite intriguing what this is gonna be like. But we're gonna find out right here, right now. So hopefully you enjoy this one. It's a little bit of a different kind of reaction, less about like geography and more about like myths and stuff. And scary. Yeah. But it kind of sounds cool. So let's check it out. Here we go. It's gonna be an English. Hmm. We'll look at that in Hongcur. Beautiful. The real facts presents omg oh boy to Wendy. Uh oh. Very small. Oh, that's a nice picture. Interesting. So scared by this music. What the heck. Take a palang. Oh, I feel like a horse thing. Whoa, what the. Oh no. We're gonna die. All right, we're gonna remember to wear shirts and fed up. You used to do that all the time. Oh boy. Okay. That one was freaky. Oh, this one's even better. Oh. Oh, gankers. What the. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Looks less scary right there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we're being a kid even. Yeah. Thinking that that thing's gonna walk over your house. These are so freaky like them. Yeah. Be good or this thing's gonna eat you. It's not just a Viking. A team and tree. What the heck. Oh, that's good. Oh, not a bird or a sponge. Yay. It's a fun point. It's been having a tree friend. Yeah. It'd be like Lord of the Rings. Oh, Lord, little Lord. Oh, yikes. I want to be friends with that one. Oh, that would be evil. Yeah. Yeah. Yikes. What if you become friends with him? Oh, it's Reagan. Oh. Yeah. That one looks like you're riding. It looks like... I'm not a dragon. It's number seven. Oh. I'm not a dragon. I'm not a dragon. I'm not a dragon. Oh, no. Oh, no. So if we find a baby in the forest and we're like, oh, no, it's a baby. And then we're gonna be like, wait. Now we're not gonna help before the baby that abandoned out there. Because they're gonna be seeing a murderous. True. And then we get a new story later that a baby was rescued. It was a minute from being saved and it died. We just have to save all babies. We just had a wrap like a muzzle around his mouth. So it doesn't turn into that thing and bite our neck. The sun. Oh. This is... There's a lot of these creepy women ones. Yeah, like humanoid type things. Yeah. So short. I got away. Oh. Insects again. Interesting. But people really hate insects. I don't know how people do anyways. It's like, like, elders' squirrels characters. Yeah, true. I don't know. Number 10. Oh, the acres. That's muscular. I just see that thing in the forest. Oh. Why do they always want to eat prey that women? So if we ever see any of those things, just stay away from it. Yes. And we can have our liver. Ooh. What is? Oh. Ooh. All right. Well, we... You guys always said how nice everyone is in the Philippines, but now we can't trust any of you. No. Because you might turn into one of these sheep-shifter creatures at night and murder us. And bite our neck, so turn into a little baby. Yeah. You'll take a walk of our hair and then wrap it around a bug. And kill us. So we're not coming anymore. Yeah. We're just going to go somewhere safe, like... with a very northern, most part of the world, the North Pole. And then see the hollow earth. Yeah. We could just go inside of a glacier. It's the only place that's safe, and then we'll find the troll queen. Mmm. Anyway, that actually was pretty cool. It's kind of crazy, because you don't really hear, at least in the United States, we don't really hear much about anything like that, other than, like, Greek mythology. Mmm-hmm. Yeah. And like, this is, like, fleshed out, like, Greek mythology. They all had origin stories. They all had, like, things they did. They're almost, like, these, like, the Greek monsters. They all had things they did and certain things. And there's probably people that hunted them. There's, like, a lot of themes behind them, like, what, like, you can learn from the monsters. Yeah. Don't do this. Or don't do that. It's very interesting. Urban legends, or mythical creatures, are very cool. I want to learn some more. There is a part, too, so if you enjoy the video, this looks like a, what's it called, white doctor? Mmm-hmm. The, um, yeah. If you want us to check that out, let us know. And if you enjoy the video, subscribe. Like the video. See you all later. Let us know what you want to see in the Philippines, in the comments below. Or other countries as well. More stuff is coming soon. Bye.
