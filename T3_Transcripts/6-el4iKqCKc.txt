Let's get it. Boom. That's what I give away for the end of this video. Okay. Guys, make sure you watch the end. I'm going to be giving this to some honest person. Yeah, make sure you watch till the end of these videos. Don't skip. Because I'll be sharing about my experience here in the Philippines. Excuse me. Excuse me. Can you help me? Do you have change for 100? No. For my parking. Wait, let me get his blind, right? And probably he has a driver. He wants to pay for the parking. Maybe someone else is driving. Okay, I'm getting that. Oh, this, no, this? No, this one is $100. Okay. I'm just taking the 100 person. Okay. Are you okay? I'll give you two people. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you so much. It's $100. Oh my gosh. Did you guys see that? So the guy was giving $100 US dollar. But the Filipino guy told him like, okay, you are blind, right? So you were like, you're giving me a wrong money. I'm going to give you 250 pesos, which is like 100. Wow. And he took the other 100. Wow. I mean, let me just to show you guys how kind and how honest people here in the Philippines are. Okay. And then you came, I give you 250. Thank you. Thank you so much. For 250. Put your bag, put your money in the bag. Okay. Let me, let me do it for you. Wow. Sure. Otherwise somebody will cheat you and then you will do. Oh, no. People are very honest. No, not only the Philippines, my friend. The honest video, I came from the other country. I live in Hong Kong for 33 years. And I'm okay, two years ago. That is the price. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, how much? How much? I mean, if you don't stay in the Philippines, normally this queer, I mean, here queer is like, it's like a sign of respect. You know, when you're talking to elder, when you talk to someone, which is older than you, it's either you call, if it's a guy, it's a queer and if it's a lady, it's atter. Like if it's your sister, you should call her by atter. And like, probably that queer selling book is I think Buko, Buko juice, Buko juice, which is like coconut water. I think coconut milk sometimes. Meets with sugar. With some fancy, mmm, masarap. 40 pesos each. Have you tried Buko with bonnet? Buko and bonnet. That is the best breakfast. You can never have Buko and bonnet after college. Okay. I'm from Syria. I'm in the list. Yeah. I got stuck here. We're neighbors. Oh, you know. From the Bible. Yeah, you've been there. And one thing about the Philippines is, well, if you're not here as I mentioned before, they're very religious. Like they know, I mean, they're really religious and respectful. So just one thing you should know about the Philippines again. Let's go. You're not a Bible? Okay. Some. Yeah. I come, I walk from UP near UP. Okay. Yeah, I, you're in the first couple of days. I got stuck here because of the COVID. I have no money queer. Maybe you can give me one. I don't, you know, I, I didn't drink for a long time, you know. I'll keep you one. I'll take you. I mean, can you see? I mean, you know, although he's selling, but he's generosity as you guys, I mean, if you don't know, generosity is a big, is a big part on the Philippine culture. And the kindness as well. So if you get, if you notice, the guy came to him and taught him, look, I haven't had the drink in a long time. Can you please give me a drink? And he didn't even hesitate. He said, okay, I'm going to give you, I'm going to give you a drink. And he didn't even ask for anything. He did, I mean, they're the queer or they're the men. He didn't even ask for anything. It is just like you feeding your neighbor, you feeding someone that is in need. Wow, is this crazy, bro? They are so kind. No, except Philia. I have nothing. Hello, good morning. Hello, what is that? I would do. Thank you. Thank you, one, one of a thousand. That is true. This is the system. You're so kind, do you give me for free, really? What the, what the dishes are? I don't know, what did he say? My memory is not working so good because I had no foot. You should feed the hunger. You should feed the hunger. You should feed those I need. You should give water to those that need the drink. People, I mean, you know, I have lived in other countries before. I have lived in two countries before coming to the Philippines. And here, here in the Philippines, even if you come. I don't have a family like a brother in here. But I have been here since I have been here for a long time. I mean, I graduated here, I did my college in here and I'm still here in the Philippines. People here, they're really so kind, you know. If I, if I like, if I just can tell you all the experience, all the hard time that I went through and my Filipino friends, they were always there to help me. They didn't even care if I was a foreigner because probably people that will be thinking, oh, okay, foreigner, like, okay, foreigner has a lot of money. But when you get to know them, some of them will care, some of us. We don't even have that much money. And he's just like, we here for better, maybe like for better lifestyle. You know, as this guy said, okay, he's here. I mean, he came here probably for tourism or for something else. And he got stuck, you know, because this is just a social media, or how do you call it, a social media experiment, right? But this is to show you how are the people here. Because like, what I'm saying right now, I'm not saying this for views. I'm saying this out of experience because I have been here for like for a long time to know how are the people here, you know. So you're going to give me kind also. This is kind and drink. Yeah. Okay. What is your name? My name is... But there was one thing that I like. I like it with sugar. I like when he texts the water from the coconut. I like it when he adds some sugar. For me, it's sweeter. I got a paper. What is this? It's the Hasle of Heaven Okay. Okay, like this, ok.

Thank you salamād, like when you say salamād it means thank you. But when you say salamād Paul it is a sign of respect. You see when you're talking to the elders like okay, when someone did something good, or salamād Paul, that is a sign of respect. And the foreign already got it. So when you're talking to Philippino and you know that he is older than you, you should say salamād Paul. And trying to put the Paul in the end, or in the end, or the time. Okay. Wow, this is beautiful. That's your fault. This is beautiful. Hi, say good bye. Say good, say good bye. Thank you. Oh, oh, oh. Did you guys get that? He was going on, I mean, I don't know where he was going. That guy is so that he was talking with the other choir. And that, I mean, that a choir gave the food, right? While he was on his way, that a choir is the calling and gave him water, like too big, the gave him water. Just to refresh him and he didn't even ask. And he didn't even talk to them. But it's so the condition that he is right now. Probably he is in need. So he took the water from the store and gave to the foreigner. I don't know. F***. He dropped something, right? He dropped something. Oh, okay. Okay. Where did you find this? Did it fall? Did it fall? Thank you. Did it fall down? Here. For you and your own. Enjoy. Thank you. Enjoy. Enjoy. Enjoy. Enjoy. Enjoy. Enjoy. Enjoy. Enjoy. Enjoy. Enjoy. Enjoy. Enjoy. Enjoy. Enjoy. Because you are honest. Tell me if it was you. If you find money, if someone dropped the money, what would you do? Would you keep the money? Would you return the money? The guy just returned the money. Is he stupid? No. He knows that he didn't work for that. Someone else worked for that. So what is the use of me keeping something that is not mine? Hmm. Wow. Oh. I hope you guys. This is my first. This is a part one of Filipino generosity and kindness caught on camera. I would like to give shout out to Foreign German. We know that he is everywhere on YouTube when it comes to the Philippines. He is doing his job. He is doing himself. And he is doing great. I am going to tell you this. For everything you have achieved. You guys can see days like his Instagram and Facebook. You can watch the full video on his channel. As I said, I would also tell my experience here in the Philippines. I will try to be brief so that I won't attack that long. I have been here for a long time. In 2017, I think my mom was taken. I was going through hard time and my country was in crisis. Like really the hard of my parents that couldn't even send the money just for me to pay the rent. I assume I remember my landlord, she came to my house like, oh. When are you paying? I just thought I am a situation. Okay, mom, I am going through this. And she told me, I never forget a confagate. This is what she told me. You don't need to pay no. Pay whenever you can. It can take months. Pay whenever you can. Don't sacrifice your pay. I mean, don't sacrifice yourself just to pay the rent. If you have money, use that money for your food. You see? And imagine I stayed three months without paying the rent. Three months without paying the rent. She didn't even come to me. Like, even days, she would invite me to go to her place. Just to have a lunch or on weekends to have a lunch with her family. She is like a mom to me. And I still talk to her. And whenever I can, I still go to her house. This is just for you guys to see how kindness and how hospitable the people here in the Philippines are. If you are planning to come to the Philippines, if you are planning to visit the Philippines, I would advise you come to the Philippines because in here they will treat you like a family. They will treat you like a brother. I hope you guys enjoyed my reaction. And if you like this kind of content, please leave that thumbs up. If I have at least 100 likes on this video, I would know that you guys like this kind of video. As you guys know, the logo, I won't say nothing. I won't talk no more. We go and drop us. See!
