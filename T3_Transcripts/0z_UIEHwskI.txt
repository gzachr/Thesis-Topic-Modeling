 Guys, my name is Aaa depicted E attractions Dear gehen los 8 Tunisian canal Good morning guys this morning we are heading straight out to Synologue Festival. We're so excited. We haven't done this ever before. We're here with Finn and Mike and Nelly. Hi. Finn is very experienced when it comes to Synologue. He's going to show us around. This is burial. He's been once. That's good enough. One more than us. What can we expect? Well, first of all you're going to see the classic Filipino culture with all the street dancing but it's a Christian festival with him. They basically move the mangella cross to Sebu. Wow. It's like the holiest place in the country. And later on after the parade we're going to see a lot of street dancing and perhaps some face painting craziness. We've got the water proof bag with us just in the way we want the pad. You guys excited? Yeah. Are you ready? Let's go. It is crazy here already. This road is super, super busy. We're trying to get a taxi right now with this five of us. So we can't get a normal taxi. Who's going on the road? There's two taxi's. Two taxi's. All right. Sweet. We've got one. So Synolog is probably the most suggested thing we've ever had commented. Minus a bullet challenge. We've done that. So logically number two is to be here in Sebu's festival. People were crazy yesterday. Like we went to the mall and there was so many people everywhere. People were so excited by T-shirts that we heard it's going to be absolutely crazy. So make sure I know it's too late now by the time we're watching this but hopefully if you've seen us comment say hey because I want to see as many of you because we can today. You know what it feels like? In the UK, if you go to university we have something called the Summer Ball every year. The whole university campus gets together. It's good vibes, good music, people in a good mood. People dress up and they're paying. I don't know. It feels like summer ball morning. Well, I've had a festival of the big in the UK as well. Yeah, like a real festival vibe already. I don't know why but yeah, we're very, very excited. Okay, we've actually lost Finn Mike and Nelly. Already. Good start. There's no service today anywhere. That's taxi drive. The first taxi we've been separated and now we've lost them and we're in his massive mall. I saw them in front of us in a car. We've got out and now they are literally nowhere to be seen. Ready to watch it, it's out there. Not five minutes for the same thing. Nothing's wrong with it. Awesome. There's only one thing we need before we get this day started and that is... Coffee. That works a way. Yeah. Nelly and I have decided to match our outfits this morning. I know. I know. Pizzini. Pizzini. Woo. It's in the look parade. Woo. That was a great vibe in here walking around already. Oh, thanks. We're just on our way downtown to Sipa. We're going to catch the parade over there. Yeah, man. Go. Yeah. The girls want to find some kind of traditional headwear or outfit or something like that. Outfit. Full outfit. Accessory. That is the word Nelly. Thank you. They're selling it all along the streets. We're also going to try and pick up a little bit of street food for breakfast. But we're heading out down to the main parade. So busy already. Actually, it's a rain, but luckily I'm on the run of Rela somehow. We're going to head further down the parade just here. There's so many people here. We've got to stick together, guys. It's so proud of you. Yeah, you're going to be a corpse. The rain has started. We've come under this little shelter to get some shelter from the storm. We're going to go in this, I think it's pretty good. And we might go out to GoPro because it's really raining. But just behind us here, it's some lecture. The girls are getting kitted up. You want one? I'm just going to go with the wetlock. Yeah, exactly. Very, very rainy here. We switched to the GoPro. It's taking loads of photos with fans. We're just waiting for them. Hours have passed. This is great. The parade's kind of going along over there. Good atmosphere. Even though it's raining, everyone's still just enjoying having a great time. We're from Boston and we've been coming. Hey, amazing. Thank you. Nice, Lucy. 100,000. Yeah. Right, this is my first accessory. We're on the Hunter Mall, though. All right. 80,000. So many of you guys are ready. Ready, go. Yay. Yay. Yay. Yay. Yay. Yay. Yay. Yay. Guys, this is crazy. This is literally insane. You know what I'm going to say. I'm going to get my car back. This is insane. I'll be in the lane. And make it lose control. Do the safe and serve every race. It's getting on very low. Insane. I'm going to scout for one to ten. How much are you synahlogging? Synahlogging. Synahlogging. Synahlogging. Synahlogging. Yeah. So all fueled up after a bit of chicken. Oh. I like it. And we're going to head back to parade now. I think the sun is... Oh. Where's that coming from? Oh. I'm jealous that guy's going shot. We're going to head back down now to parade. I think it's getting warmer. The sun's coming out. Whoa. The rain was actually nice. It's a bit cold up down for a bit. I think it's going to get very hot to get in them. And it's going to get back in the car. It's going to be so much fun. Everyone's such a good man. Yeah. We've also met so many of you guys who watched our videos. Thanks for coming up to us. I'm saying hello. We love it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Oh. Shit. Shit.気 tight. It's really kind of overwhelming almost. Yeah. You walk through the end. There's so much going on, helicopter flying parts. People taking selfies are amazing. So, so cool. Such a good bite. Yeah, definitely. Got another accessory for today. Oh, I'm going to say, thank you. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! Thank you! Nice, we're adding to it. I think I look great. You look great. You both look great. So there's a security guys, I've got one little parade bit on the floor down here. The huge crowd behind us and they've let us sit here for a second just to get close to the action and then we'll be headed back into the ground. We've got a great spot here right in front of the rail. They're coming around like giving us sweets and everything. We're loads of people are cheering and we're not sure at home. It's cool to basically be there. The parade keeps going for hours and it's like they'll stop, they'll do the performance, they'll keep going and there's a little gap between each one. But it's cool. I'm hanging out of rain here. And it's just quite raining, that's bad timing. Oh, god. That's a lot of people. Oh, that's lovely. It's really nice. We made a little gateway for us to walk through. We made a little gateway for us to walk through. We made a little gateway for us to walk through. We made a little gateway for us to walk through. Just about. That was crazy. I'm going to make a short stop now for some coffee. Had a quick review of the coffee shop and we're about to head out into the magnet. This is round two and apparently it involves pain and it gets even crazier than before. Let's go. Oh, it's been done. So crazy to walk in through the trees. Oh, my goodness. Make all the way. Wow. No way. Film that. I love this view. I'm not sure about that. There's just people everywhere. There's so much random stuff going on. I don't know where I am. I'm doing that. So yeah. I'm full of coffee. I'm covered in feathers. I think this is the kind of things to come. It's paint time. What happened to you? Nothing on my face. It's a very nice and black. Let's create. It's fun. It's fun. It's fun. It's fun. It's fun. I didn't say it was about to get crazier. Yeah. The further we go in this direction, the crazier it's actually getting. So. Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay!
