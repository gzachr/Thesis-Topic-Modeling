 Good afternoon world from Shago Island here in the Philippines. Today we're going to do one of those trying Filipinos snacks videos. This is Stories First Time trying any of these things. Today I'm going to drive you. You want to start with that one? What? These are corn chips. Have a look. Did you choose these ones from the store? Yes. So these are super crunch. Be fee barbecue flavour. All-time favourite apparently. So here we go story. Let's give these a go. Yeah. Can I have one? What? Let's have one. Thank you. Okay, they're like little circles. Don't taste a lot more like tomato than beef. No, I'm definitely getting a meaty flavour. These are nice. I like about these because they're super tasty. Super tasty. Gosh, they're all cool. Give that a rating out of 10. 10 being the best one being the worst. 10. 10. 10. 10. 10. 10. 10. 10. 10. I'm going to eat it now for the super crunch corn chips. The story has chosen the pre-food black chilli barbecue flavour corn chips. Is it only a little bit? Yeah, we're going to have a few pieces of this. Is it only a little bit of chilli? All right. I don't think it's chilli flavour. I think it's barbecued flavour. Yeah. All right. You're not afraid of chilli are you? No. All right. Oh, look at that. I can't do it. I can't do it. No. I can't do it. I can't do it. There are any scissors. They're me smell like. Like what? What do you smell like? Chippies. Chippies. Chippies. Oh. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. This one. This one to me tastes a lot more like corn than the other one. I like those. They're actually much nicer than the other crisps. Look, this is what it looks like. What does it taste like? These likes pepper. Pepper. Yeah? Pepper. So these ones are do you like the first one first? You like these ones too? Yeah. All right. So if the last one was a number 10 and this one is better, what number is this? Ten. Another ten. Okay, so they're on par with each other then. Which snack would you like to try next? This one. A story has now chosen this big bag of chips. These are... Chicharron. Chicharron. Quite chips. Quite chips. You man won. You man won with a... I've got no idea. But it does say at the bottom, no pork flavour. It says on the back they made from dehydrated green peas. So let's give these a try. Get your nose in. No nose. Did I? I'm not sure. You don't like you just say everything is nice. Yeah, your reaction looked a bit bad there. Did you not like it? It's no. I did. Yeah, you like this one. You want to taste it? War, that's big. Oh. Oh, it's it in. Oh, it's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It was through. It's got a mouthful. Let's try one each. I like that. They don't taste how I thought they were going to taste. It tastes like lemon. It is a bit spicy. No. It was a bit of a chilli kick. No, but you think it tastes fresh and lemony at the end. Oh, I'll hang on, I'm getting it now. Right at the end. Can you get any chilli taste? I like chilli. I like chilli too. Would you like another one? Yeah, come on. This is one of those snacks that you would never be able to guess the flavour just by looking at the picture on it. It looks like a pork crackling and it tastes like a fresh lemon, like a tide-ish, if anything. It tastes like a wool pack. Yeah, it needs a bit of water after that one. Now a big spice today. Yeah, is it too spicy or do you like it? I like it. Right, next up, the story has picked these. These are Oishi Martis crackling. The salt and vinegar flavour. So go and stir it. Go for it. The square. Oh, the square, Chris. Hi. Hi. Hi, it's the Ken. These are vegetarian crackers. It says they're guilt-free as well. How are they? I don't like it. No. No. Why? It's got like a kind of a fishy taste. I like it. Yeah? Yeah, fishy taste. Do you want another one? Yeah, there's no fishy taste. Really? This one reminds me a lot more of the pork crackling. The story seems to like this. I think we're getting all this nice reaction because the story is a big fan of crispy, crunchy, savory snacks. Yeah. Everything is just nice and good. You're enjoying this. Yeah, I want a crunchy one today. Okay, grab it. Oh, it'll be pink. It's a fluffy pink. I can see peace. Peace? It is a crunchy peace snack, that one. It's called Muncher Green Peas Original Flavor. I've got it. Eat it. No, here we'll start on this. It's human. A human. Yeah. Gonna space ship. Alright, this is it. This is it. This is it. We're gonna try it now. I'm not sure if it's been marked it towards kids or not. It's marked it. Put a little superhero on there. Oh, there you go. What do you think, this is going to be nice. I think they taste like any old dried pea snack. Yeah. They're not too salty. They're not sweet or anything. I would eat these in the car. They used to make a good car snack for me. I don't know. They kind of get lost in the car. I was going to pick it up to one. You'd never get that back. Next up, we are going to try this instant pancit canton. It says sweet and spicy flavour on the side. Now, you're going to help us cook it. Yeah. Alright. Stay with me. We're going to do it here. I'm going to get some water. Just like any pot noodle or instant noodle, it just looks like that. What? One square block. Can you put that in there, please? That's it. Right, let's pour in some water. So this isn't really like an instant noodle, is it? No. Maybe in there, but it doesn't work that way. Pop them on the plate. Oh, I'm so free. I'm so free. It is also free. You've got noodles in your dress. And so this is the spice mix that comes with the noodles. Now, let's do it. Yeah, tip it in. It also comes with this little juro. It's an oil and soy sauce, I think. So just like that, it's a little bit of a bit of a sauce. Juro is an oil and soy sauce, I think. So do you want to pour that in as well, Sturry? Yeah. That's it. Ooh, all of it in. I think this is the worst way to make. He's never done that. We should've just done it all in the past, you know? I think we've really messed this up, but... Anyway, we just want to taste it, don't we? Okay, we ready to taste it. So let it. Yeah. It tastes like it's got a sugar on it. Oh, yeah. It's got a slight chili pig right here. Oh, chili is as well. Was it spicy Sturry? What? Try it. Ooh, that's a good mouthful. Mmm, mmm, mmm. It's mouthful. I think you're going to get the chili hit on that one, if you didn't on the first one. Is it not spicy? No, wow. I'm surprised you don't think that's spicy. I quite like it. It's got a bit of a garlicky taste to it. Yeah. But there's a bit too much sugar. If they reduce the sweetness, that would be really nice. Hang on a minute, this is sweet and sour though, isn't it? Oh, yeah. It should be sweet and spicy. It is sweet and spicy flavour. So it's perfect then. It's exactly what it says on the packet. Pansing can, sweet and spicy. Oh, we need all of it. We do like that. Yeah. More slowly. Well, thank you. Yeah, but I'm really excited. Yeah, it's quite a bit. You guys have some more, too. Yeah, because when I have too much, I would have tummy ache. Yeah, that's true. You might be a bit too spicy. Yeah, I kind of think so. Yeah. Right, that's the third one. Right, after that spicy noodles, I think we need to try a drink now, Sturry. What do you think? Not bad. Yeah. So we've got these packets of tang. It's a drink mix. 100% vitamin C. And this one is Dalandam, which I think is orange, Dalandam flavour. What flavour have you got, Sturry? Pineapple. Okay. We have a jug of water here. And it just says pour contents into cold water. Pour all of that into this jug. Oh, it's... Oh, wow! It changed. It's a bit colour. Give it a good stir. Oh, we need some glasses. You turn around to start. How much do you want, Sturry? Ah, 200. 200. 200. I'm just going to do it. I'm just going to do it. I'm just going to do it. I'm just going to do it. I'm just going to do it. I'm just going to do it. I'm just going to do it. I'm just going to do it. I'm just going to do it. Tantres. Yeah. Salty. Salty. Salty. Salty. I said taste like that. That is not salty. That's sweet. It is sweet. It tastes a bit like a sweet, like a candy sweet, doesn't it? It's nice though. It's quite refreshing. It's really lovely. You really like it? Yeah. Tang is a hit with Sturry. This is what I want to try to push crunch. You've been waiting for this one, haven't you? Yeah. Why do you want to try this one? Because I really like it. How do you know? You've never tried it before. I know. This is actually a breakfast cereal. This is chocolate covered wheat curls breakfast cereal. Mama! Oh look at it. And it's got a koala bear. It's called koala. It's called koco. It's called koco baby. Who? Pilly. Pilly. Yeah. Okay. This is Jane's name for koala. The koco crunch. Oh look at what she's made of. Yeah. She's heavy back. Yeah. She's heavy back. The koala bear. The koala bear. Oh. I like it. It's like a koala shape. Coco. It does taste a bit like cocoa. It's actually interesting. They're not too sweet. No. I expected this to be really secretly sweet. I could see it real quick. It's not. Yeah. It needs a bit of a good for you to take out with us, wouldn't they? In the car. Yeah but it might jump on out to bed and you could never get it back. And then all the ants will come and get it right now. Oh yeah. It's only a one. It's got one here. Yeah. Oh no. It keeps eating that koala while I open the QYC square bites coconut flavour snack biscuit. Okay. So. How many did you get in a pack? Oh it smells a lot like coconut. Six. Six. And little ones. Fish. Oh, three likes. It smells like coconut, isn't it? Oh wow. Look. That's what it looks like. Oh, they're really young. Mmm. I like that. I'm losing. This is my favourite thing from the whole thing so far. These are my favourite things. They remind me of a biscuit that I would have at like my grandparents' house. Yeah. When I was little. I'm a baby little princess. I was about to do really, really. She just put the entire thing in her mouth. So you must like them, right? I like these. These are definite thumbs up for me. They're really nice. So this is going to be a bit of an experiment. This jelly mix. Unflavored green. So I don't know what it's going to taste like or how it's going to set even. We've tried to make it about half an hour ago. No. I didn't mean you wanted to take a taste like this. You don't want to taste it. Maybe you're a bit scared because Sturry has never ever had jelly before. Have you? No. No. So this is going to be a new thing for you to try. We've heard quite a bit about this. It's actually made with seaweed powders. What can I try it out? Normally jelly probably don't know this. It's made with beef jelly, isn't it? Yeah. So it's like maybe cow ribs. This is the first time we've seen a plant-based one. Are you looking forward to the seaweed jelly? I don't want to eat it. Come forward. It'll be fun. I'm going to put the jelly in front of here. Okay. This is the jelly. Incoming jelly. Right, then open your eyes. Go. Ding. Ah! Look how green that is. Here's a spoon for you. One, two, three, two, one. Whoa! Oh. Oh my god. Jelly all over the screen. Oh my god. I'm going in. I think Sturry hasn't got any history. You have that bit. Looks really sticky. Eee. Oh my god. Oh my god. I'm going in. I think Sturry hasn't got any history. You have that bit. Looks really sticky. Oh my god. Jelly went on your face. I'm going to try it now. Yeah. Oh my god. Sturry. Do you like it? Yeah. Before is it more fun game? Yeah. Before is it more fun game? Yeah. I really like fun game. So it likes it. It's kind of, it's exploding everywhere. Also, it has its taste. Do you like how it tasted? Yeah. Have you had a little piece? Try it. And tell us how you really think. That would be better. Be honest. Tell us what you think it tastes like. Fuffi. Fuffi. So you like the texture? Yeah. I don't think it tastes like anything. So we've only got two more things left. And one of them is just from my dady. It is this. Copicote. 3 and 1 black coffee mix. You probably know that Sashara and I are quite big coffee drinkers. We love really good coffee. So we've never tried this powdered mix before. Never. Because normally the three and ones have milk powder in them. But this one is a black one and it's made. It does have a non-dairy creamer in it. So this is new for us. You never had this before. This is it. Strong and rich. It says. Story is going to be eating Oreos because this is one of the snacks we can find all over the Philippines. That's one of our favourites. And the Oreos are also the last thing that we are trying today. You're an expert at eating Oreos, aren't you? Yeah. And they're also tasty. You like to take them apart don't you? It looks like it's not free. It's definitely not normal instant coffee is it? It's quite a lot of powder isn't it? It is. It's nice. Yes. Story likes this kind of coffee because she's grown up around it, haven't you? Yeah. I mean Daddy have always been drinking coffee to get through parenting. It looks alright. It looks like quite a nice coffee colour. Okay. Cheers. Coffee cheers. Oh. Goodness me. Oh that is so sweet. Way too much sugar. Woo! I think it's like 50-50 sugar that. We don't add sugar to our coffees so this is ridiculously sweet. It's quite a nice taste but I could not drink a whole cup of it or even half a cup. That's party sweet. It smells good though. And how was your Oreo story? Nice. Of course it was nice. Goodness me. All these chum foods. Yeah, I don't. I can have that. Thanks for sharing. I haven't had it yet. You can have it. You thought about it. You can have it. Thank you. Thank you. Everyone loves an Oreo. And the story would say. Nice. Okay that's all the Filipino junk food today. So as many of you might know already we are a vegan family which means we don't need any meat, fish, dairy, milk, cheese or eggs. So it was quite hard to find Filipino snacks that didn't have any of that stuff in it. We got quite a lot of products and we only went to two little stores in our local village. So there was actually quite a lot of stuff that was accidentally vegan. I feel like we got a good selection and it was fun. I enjoyed it. It's good to know that if you come here you don't eat animals that you can still find Filipino snacks to enjoy. So before we end today's video we've got some shout outs to do.
