Let me see. Is it like some kind of... What? He like... Big black... Oh, it's the business podcasting corporation. Okay, okay. That BBC is okay. Angco Roger, not into the other BBC. Let's play the video. Egg-fried rice. Don't be afraid. This is really simple. It's cheap. It's delicious. Really satisfying. Rice. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. Who afraid of egg-fiery's? Is it a no-bombe dish? Everybody eat egg-fiery's. Who afraid? Why are you afraid of egg-fiery's? Where are you, courage? Angco Roger's scared ghost. But you scare egg-fiery's. Favourite. It's really simple. It's cheap. It's delicious. Really satisfying. And it's like a takeaway. But you haven't paid a quid for it. Who paid eight pound for a takeaway? Egg-fiery's my god. They think money go on treeping egg-fiery's. Hiya. So a lot of people get afraid of cooking the rice. But you can follow a really simple rule, which is for every one part rice you have. You need two parts water. It's as simple as that. Agreed? Who? No. Why you measure water with cup? Does use finger. Finger. I took water. Until finger. First joint finger. That's how you measure the water. Not with British tea cup. Hiya. First step all wrong already. I am not confident. Okay, in her defense. That's how I measure. That's how we learned it. Yeah. That's how it works in Europe. I guess. This video is going to be good. Enough rice for around two people. So now the rice is on. Wait, so you don't wash the rice? How you don't wash the rice just cook the rice? Now the rice is stinky. Where you learn how to make rice? Some white people cooking school or something. So now the rice is on. It's time to crack on with the eggs. Oh, ha ha. Crack on. I see what you're doing. So punny. So humorous. I dying laughing. I dead now. I got a frying pan here. Get that onto a medium heat. And then just add a little bit of oil. So let that heat up. One. Okay. Egg and egg five rice. We're trying to do this 100. Oh. Okay, that pretty impressive. Pretty impressive. I can't believe it. Pretty impressive. I give you that. Bit halfway. Once it's... Not supposed to crack in egg on the side of a bowl because that might get contamination from the outside of the egg into the inside. You're supposed to crack in egg on a flat surface and then... Just putting it out there. Just putting it out there. On a simmer. You want to cook it for around 10 minutes. You know what? I don't like Uncle Roger. I don't like induction stove. You know those don't have no fire. Uncle Roger need the fire. Who use induction stove? It's so lame. So not satisfying. You go camping. You set up camp fire. You don't set up camp induction stove. Oh, come, everybody. Come, come sit around this camp induction stove. Let's tell you this for a little. Let's make marshmallow. 10 minutes. Wang Yuexin. Wang Yor... What, what did she say? What did she say? Wang Yuexin. Wang Yor X in. Don't put Wang anywhere near your hip fire ice. Don't Wang anything in kitchen. Okay. That's how I got fired from Chinese restaurant. On to play. Lee Tong's side. Okay. Okay, rice. We are looking good. The rice is not looking good. You lying to people. Soul wet. Drain it. Drain it. What's she doing? What's she doing? Drain the... Oh my god. Drilling the woman. Hiya, Drayne. The... She... The rice. She's draining rice with colander. Hiya. How can you drain rice with colander? This is not pasta. I've never seen anyone drain rice. If you're rice too hot, you'll find out. Don't bring colander into your rice cooking. Hiya. Get advice rice cooker. Don't mess with saucepan. Like this lady here. Don't mess with colander. If you're rice too hot, you'll recook the rice. No way to save wet rice. Has quite a start in it. Which will make it... What the hell? What the hell? Okay. That's why... What the... That's why I have an viral. Because, first of all... I don't know why she drains the rice. You basically cook the rice until the water is gone. You have to have the right proportions. But who I am to say something like that. I burned rice many times. So... Yeah. And the... Many, many things cooking is just like being creative and just doing. Cooking is all about recipes and knowledge and knowing the portions, knowing how to do it, recognizing differences in the food. It's not just like... Yeah. Hell? Uncorroder. So upset. I put my leg down from chair. Why you run? You run. You ruining the rice first. You use colander to dry the rice. And then you put water. Then why bother drying the rice? Who cook rice like this? How did this woman get a PC food? They never asked Uncle Roger. Uncle Roger, teach master class on making rice. But this woman, colander on the rice, then water through the rice. This is all one... Oh... Uncle Roger said now. May now, let's just add your garlic and ginger. Garlic ginger. Okay, classic, classic Asian seasoning. Okay, this one, okay. And then you put all the other ingredients in. Rice. Oh, the set, gloopy rice that ran through colander. The egg. Spring onions. And... Okay, open. And then you just want to stir it all together and cook it through. For about three to five minutes. This look okay, but look too healthy. Wear your MSG. You don't use MSG how to make good egg fire rice. It's just white people egg fire rice. MSG is the king of flavor. If you said in life, use MSG. If you're happy in life, use MSG. MSG in everything. It'll turn it better. You just get a baby, put MSG on baby. You better be smarter. And that's done. Time to plight up. Your toes are still... Oh no, no, no! You're using metal to scrape your saucepan. Hiya, this is non-stick saucepan. Cannot use metal. Hiya, your parents never teach you. If I use metal on saucepan at home growing up, I will beat this old. No more parents. Why are you all... Okay, hold on. Mike is the same. I used a spoon to... Just take something out of the pan and Mike was like, what are you doing? What are you relatable? Often, I use metal on saucepan. Manto won me anymore. Very few people break Asian people hot. One is when your rice run out. Number two is when you scrape pan with metal spoon. First, my wife leaves me. Now you scrape pan with metal. Hiya, Uncle Roger, one of the superstars. Very different. Oh my God. Why you part of yourself? You messed up everything. You scrape saucepan with metal. Try the rice and wet the rice and try the rice at the call center. You don't use MSG. Why this woman part of herself? Egg fire rice, Uncle Roger, no one to make egg fire rice and Uncle Roger 3 year old. And this lady, I don't know 34, makes egg fire rice on induction hob. I'm so proud of myself. They were good fans. Yeah. BPC good food. This is not good video. People use this video. Make egg fire rice, editing egg fire rice disgusting. Not good for Chinese culture. BPC good food. Next time you want to make egg fire rice video, ask Uncle Roger. Uncle Roger teach you proper technique. The Asian way. Follow me on Instagram. This is my Instagram. My nephew, Nai Jo, he set up Instagram for me. He managed my Instagram. Follow the Instagram. Bye bye. Oh, hilarious. Not your fun reaction. Yeah. I have to say, because when he mentioned the MSG, we have something in Bosnia as well. It's called the getter. And you put the getter into everything. Soups. Everything. I don't understand why why Westerners are so against MSG. We want to trip once with a friend in Indonesia. And we're getting like Naziko Ring. There's like no MSG. It's like, what? This nothing MSG is just salt. It's a natural product. It's nothing chemical. It's salt that is less salty. It just brings up more flavors in the food. Huge discussion we had. Monosodium glutamate salt. It's salt. That's what it is. This was such a fun reaction of him, like, reacting to her. But I also saw the back story. How like this affected her. Because of this video. You have to be like, we had a good laugh. But she got some serious. Yeah, I said I feel bad for her. I do feel bad for her. I can't cook rice. I mean, not properly. Every time I want to cook rice, Mike is like, no, I'll do it. There's a reason for that. I'm so happy. Ankaroja did not react to my cooking rice technique. Fried rice is best when you use rice that was cooked the day before. Mmm. Yeah. So, uh, yeah. Um, please, if you see videos like these, don't go onto her socials and spread hate. There's no reason for that. She made a mistake, obviously. She's not accustomed to Asian cuisine that much. Obviously, um, and yeah, it's just no reason to threaten someone. But she recovered from it. Yes. And she recovered and she took it with a portion of humor after a few weeks.
