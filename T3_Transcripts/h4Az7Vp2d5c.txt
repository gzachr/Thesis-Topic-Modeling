Today is the day
We are leaving Manila
And we are going to
Yeahh, let's go
You might wonder how we are going there
Yes, you guessed it right
We are not taking the flight
Instead, we are taking the ferry for
Terminal fee
Terminal fee?
Ah okay okay
Ah we have to go to the terminal fee
I think we have to pay something
It's going to be so long but
Yet interesting
Yeah, we wanted to do that
Really
To live this experience
We have never lived something like this
Before
Never
I never sleep on a boat
On a ferry like this
We
Saw
Some information on internet and
And it just gave us
This envy
To live this experience
Yeah it inspired us actually because
We wanted to go by plane
To Cebu it's only 1h30 flight
And actually it's kind of
Similar
Price
It's not that
Yeah, we will tell the details later
I am so excited!
Before buying the
Tickets
We of course had many questions
Oh yeah, that's true
We were not sure
if it was a good decision
because we
don't know if we will get bored
in the ferry
for 24 hours
What can we do?
Do they have wifi?
Will it be comfortable on the boat?
Will we starve on the boat?
Will we have things to eat on the boat?
So many questions
Is it safe?
Don't panic, don't panic
We did the check in
Now we are in the
waiting area already
And it's 3pm
The ferry leaves at 6pm
So in 3 hours
We have plenty of time
We are going to do
our best to share
this first time experience
to share how we live this
and all the interesting information also
so stick with us until the end
to live this 24 experience in a ferry
Lyn got us some snacks
just before at a ministop shop
Already hungry
Bon appetit
Are you ready for 24 hours?
Yeaaaah
Okay, this is it
We start to board
It's
2 hours before the departure
And we start to board now
Look at the boat
I'm not sure you can really see
but wow
so big
so huge
It's so huge
I'm so excited
I can't wait to see inside
I don't know how to describe
how we are excited now
The ferry is so huge
I have never seen something like this before
Yeah, me neither. First time, first time.
it's like a cruise. Yeah, I
don't know how it's like for the cruise 
But yeah, look at
the stairs. We have to climb all of this
There's so many stairs.
This is so high actually. 
You can see just behind.
Wow, it's really a unique
experience now.
They are so strong.
You okay? 
Huh?
You okay?
I'm already tired.
But when I see them
I feel okay.
There are many stairs huh?
Yeah
Oh look at the view
We are so high right now.
We are entering to the ferry now
Yeah super excited.
I wonder how it's like in the room.
If he will give the key now or later.
Yeah, I don't know yeah.
I don't know how is the organization here.
But there is someone greeting us.
Stand by here?
Okay
Wow. Check this out guys. Check
this out
The guy just told me that wait here, stand by here
He took the ticket and he he's
going to call my name, our name
Okay. And he will he will bring us to the room?
I don't know
I really didn't expect that
There is a miniso inside the ferry
So incredible
You can just do shopping here.
We are going to do a full tour later
We just deposit all the bags in the room
and then we are going to take the time just to show you around.
This is pretty well organized.
Yeah. There's a lot of people
just waiting here in this area
And we're just waiting for
people calling their name. Yeah
I am so excited
Ah yeah, here
Okay, so somebody just called our name
And now, I think she's leading us to the room
Not sure but I guess
So we just follow her
Okay so I think that the lady is explaining to Lyn
where are the different kind of facilities or 
so I think that Lyn will recap for us just later.
Oh so it's quite nice.
There's a lot of different room. Ah there is the restroom here
But yeah. I feel really good here.
Super nice
Yeah so just for information we took the business class room
There is different class, we will tell you all the details later
But yeah we have our room. Yeah
And we have some bed. The key. Sorry. So super nice
Okay
Lyn, you just have to do a little room tour for us now. Yeah
So this is the entrance. Yeah. And just next to the entrance
you have a salon with a table
Oh nice. Wow
I didn't notice the table. Yeah this is so nice for us. Oh yes
Or maybe the AC no?
Maybe
Ah yeah yeah it's cold. Ah okay. It's AC
Nice, so we have a sink with a mirror here
Wow. Just this. It's so nice
It's a sitting area and just to refresh your face
We have a tv
Nice!
Just over there
We have two beds, twin beds. How nice is this?
It looks so comfy. Wow
It's like cloud
Lyn is so happy right now
You have a charging station here I think.
Wow it's writting in Chinese. I don't understand. Or Japanese.
What is it? Japanese? Japanese yeah. Volume controller
Okay so this is the alarm
This is the light
And look the look at this.
Oh nice. Ah yes. Okay we can see directly outside
Super nice
Oh I wonder if some people can walk here
Yeah I think so
Maybe we can say hi to some people. Yeah
Okay this is the emergency yeah. Safety and yeah.
And now it's like
4.30pm
So the boat is leaving in one and a half hour.
And the lady told me that the dinner will be served from 6pm till 8pm
Ooh there's a dinner coming soon? Yeah. Nice
We have such a nice impression of the ferry and of our room
we are so happy for that
and
actually this is why we decided to take the ferry to go to Cebu 
and not the flight
because with the flights
obviously it will be way shorter
it will be only one hour and thirty minutes
but we don't see that just as a mean of transport
we want to live an experience here for 24 hours
and I think that we will not get bored at all. Yeah.
This is my first impression now
I think that we will just have fun for 24 hours 
and maybe some sleep too
I think we will just have fun and then we will just be at Cebu. Yeah.
For any inquiry assistance, please don't hesitate to approach
any of our front office personnel or hotel crew. Thank you
I don't know if we can go on the deck like this.
Yeah. We'll figure it out. Yeah.
Okay we are going to go
outside of a room now
It's almost sunset. Mm
So we will see if we can go to the deck.
Yeah, I think the sun is setting already
Okay. Woa let's go then
Ah nice. So here you have some chair and table
where you can sit 
and just enjoy the view
I wonder if we can go outside
Maybe not
There maybe.
Oh, you can have bubble tea here. Oh, nice.
And it's only
one hundred and twenty.
No thank you. Not for now. May be later.
Thank you
Oh, we can go outside.
Oh, nice.
Okay yeah so we have to go upstairs
just before it was a smoking area
We saw some people upstairs so I think that
from there we can have a view.
Ah nice
Ooooooh
Super nice.
Beautiful color of the sunset
Yeah. And you have a lot of chairs where you can just sit and enjoy the view 
and we are lucky to have a beautiful color of the sky 
so maybe we didn't miss the sunset.
Yeah we didn't miss it. I'm happy.
The ferry will leave in 10 minutes so we will just wait here
and see the departure
and meantime we will enjoy
the beautiful color of the sky
and then our adventure of
24h hours will begin.
Okay, so now it's already 6 PM and 40 minutes.
and we are still here
Still in Manila. Yeah, the ferry didn't leave yet.
So, I think it's delayed. I
think that we will just go have
dinner first and then we'll see.
So, I think that all here,
all the windows
are from the different room. 
So, actually you cannot access this way.
Yeah. So, we are not supposed to see some people from our
 window
It's actually open
Okay, it seems that there is two kind of restaurants
and I'm not sure which one we have to go.
Two people. Sorry?
Two people
Share table?
Share, oh it's okay
Yes, good evening
Ticket boat?
Ticket?
Ticket, yes
available for dinner
Chicken afritada or crab stick
hm we can share so we can take one...
one of each?
One of each yeah
Just to try.
Thank you.
so we have some water. Nice.
So this is the starters
Yeah. We have a mushroom soup
So we order
one chicken and one crab stick to try
And the service is pretty nice here
I am not sure but I think we are moving
Ah maybe not
I'm not sure but I think the lady she said that we are leaving at 10pm?
Okay guys, it is not a twenty-four hours ferry experience now
but
it is a
28 hours.
and fortunately we didn't wait for
the departure on the deck
the departure has been delayed
So, at 10 PM instead of 6 PM.
So, how is the chicken?
The chicken is good actually I like it.
Yeah. Very flavorful. And I tried yours the crab stick. Yeah.
It's good too but
I prefer mine. Yeah me too.
I prefer mine. The chicken is better.
It's delayed because they are still loading cargos
We finished our dinner. What should we do now?
Maybe we can just see around
what kind of shop they have here 
I'm very curious
we have three deck
a quickmart. oh yeah
you can go to the salon Dan
you can go and cut your hair
oh there's a salon?
There is the wifi here?
Ah there is no
Ah it's from Miniso okay. Thank you
Going to the Miniso for having the tote bag.
A free tote bag
Oh, nice.

Everyone can get this beautiful pink tote bag
You are doing some shopping?
Yes if I'm feeling alone tonight
So cute. What is it? 
Ah c'est un avocado?
Looks like so avocado and I like avocado, you know it
So I think this one is for me
Oh I like it
But I don't have space
Okay, so this is the charging
station and you have to pay
5 pesos for 10 minutes charge time.
There are choco-pie here. Oh.
For 85 pesos.
What is the T-shirt? 2 go?
Ah Manila. Manila Philippines.
And they sell this for 199 pesos.
Oh it's a cheap. And quite nice
Ah, these are the car jeep
Cebu
We are coming
In 24 hours
Oh we found the KTV.
Let's go and see
There are nobody
Nobody
Singing all the night
I went to ask someone at the front desk and
ask what is KTV
and she told me it's a karoke room actually
There are two tables and one TV
Wow look at that. There's even a salon.
If you want to have a haircut
You need a haircut?
Wow it's 20
That's why it's so cold
I can choose it
I think this one was was built by Japanese
because there is many Japanese signs
okay 29 is good no?
Dan went to have a shower and I'm alone in the room
I'm going to read a little bit
about Cebu what to do there
because we haven't planned
anything yet. And here we don't
have Wi-Fi
Luckily yesterday before boarding
I sent interesting articles to
Insta paper
This is an free app that works even though you
don't have internet. Just I like this app so much since I discovered it
Everything I want to read but I don't have time.
I just sent to Insta paper and then I read it later.
The sound is pretty loud
Okay we are going out because I think that we are moving now
Let's go see
It's already 10.30pm. 
10.30 and we start to move now.
Bye bye Manila. See you soon.
I think he's pushing our big boat.
It helps to to turn
I don't know.
We are back in our room
and the music is still going on.
It was super nice
Everybody is there just listening to the good music
But now we are a little bit hungry.
Oh nice. So we have this.
What is that?
Chicha
rron
Chicharron
We got a lot of chocolate sandwich cookie
Presto
Ah yeah we have one cup noodles, bulalo
the favorite one of Lyn. Yeah. The best one for her
I took the jjamppong
This is so good
Mango marshmallow. 
Ah yeah. Mango marshmallow. This is Wow. Amazing.
A local woman just advised us
To buy this because it's so good. Yeah
And luckily we we follow her advice
and since then I really like it
My favorite one
And we have some leftover Oreo. Oreo.
The classic one
Nice
We have a lot of stuff
Yeah I think we won't starve and we have one minute maid
Cool
And that's all and it's empty
It was only snacks
Ah yeah, it was only snacks?
Okay. I told you. Okay. It was only snacks.
I needed a bag for snacks
So yeah as we are
Now eating our snacks
maybe we can talk a little bit more about this ferry
I think you know now but we took
the 2go company
With the ferry Mali. Maligaya. The
The 2go company have different kind of ferry
And we took the newest one
This one depends on the days you you take the ferry
Yeah. So once on Wednesday and one on Sunday.
And to book it's quite easy
In Manila
there is different shops
Mm. Where you can directly buy the tickets
as we prefer to pay by card and not by cash
we
prefered to book online
And you can just select the
the date and the category of room you want
mega value, tourist, business class, business class and then state room, state room yeah
Right now we have our private room
where we can put all of our stuffs
because in the mega value, you have a big room where there is a lot of people
Yeah there is no AC also
You don't have a charging outlet too so this is little bit
Yeah we can survive without this but it's better if we have like now
where we can charge everything
For the business room it's
700 something without the tax
but with the tax and everything
it's around 1200 pesos
and for the ticket flights
The last time I checked it was 1400 pesos
so no big difference
yeah the difference between the flight and the ferry
here on the boat you can bring up to 50 kilos of luggage. Hm.
Ah yeah just for info also here
for today anyway we don't have Wi-Fi. Yeah I don't know why
you have to pay for the Wi-Fi it's not included in the price
But even now if we want to pay we cannot have access to it.
and also
In the business class what is included is the linen.
And the pillowcase.
For the blanket it's 50 pesos
and for the towels is 40 pesos.
We didn't take it because we have our
own and for the blanket it's
okay we have something to cover
ourself. Yeah
You have also the three meals included
Yeah. And as it delays the ferry
I don't know if we are going to have another like
snacks or dinner
And right now the boat is moving.
And I cannot feel it. Mm.
Can you? No.
I was a little bit concerned about this
Yeah, we just put the mic here
on the top of the sofa and yeah, it's not moving
So for the people that have seasick
I think you will be fine here. 
And maybe, we will wake up for the sunrise
I want too but I don't know if we are going to make it
Woa, we are moving fast, actually. Mm.
I wonder if we can go. Yeah, let's go.
Good morning
We had a quick nap. It's 7: 30 AM now.
And we're going out to to have a breakfast
It feels so great
We didn't tell you but yesterday
I woke up once and Dan too. I woke up
because it was too cold
so I went to his bed
Actually here there is there's a little gap.
And the AC can come from here. Hm.
From here I can I can feel it
It's really cold
And outside on the corridor the AC is really strong
So even if we turned off the AC in our room.
We can still feel the AC coming
It was really cold because I was
wearing like two pants. Yeah.
Three shirts I think.
With my yellow yellow jacket. Jacket yeah.
And you you wear one pants with one leggings
One shirt and your jacket too
Yeah I had to take
out my heat tech. Uniqlo heat tech. Extra warm.
Yeah... pretty chill
You want to rent one. You want to have a good night sleep
And the incredible thing is that we can
witness the many island of the Philippines
We are surrounded by the island here
looking on the left, on the right. We can see islands everywhere
Just beautiful
Yeah and it's really amazing to see all of that.
As the Philippines is known to have
more than 7000 islands.
Oh yeah. We can at least see few of them. Yes.
On the way to Cebu. Yeah. Just amazing.
I'm going to take a nap. I will see. And you?
Yeah maybe a nap too
Okay, see you at noon.
Going to lunch.
Going to lunch.
Eating again. Yeah.
We are always the last one. Yeah, I don't know why.
It was really delicious for this lunch
And I'm full 
Yeah, really full
Big cloud here
And nobody on the deck
Only us
Crazy hair
the ship are conducting an emergency drill. 
Please remain calm. This is only a drill. I
repeat, this is only a drill.
Thank you.
Yeah, they announced that they will have emergency drill here.
I wonder what is going on
outside
I would like to go outside and
see but
yeah they are working so
we will bother them. It will be disrespectful to them
Ah maybe another announcement.
Attention all officers and crew, all officers
and crew. Call Bravo at Rescue
Boat Locker Deck four. Code
Bravo at Rescue Boat Locker
Deck four
This is only a drill, this is only a drill, this is only a drill
Attention all fire fighting team
All fire fighting team, proceed now to your muster station
They are doing some exercise for the security
Yeah. It's good. Yeah.
I I feel really safe in this ferry actually since we start the journey.
We know that they are, they pay attention on all of that.
We are not the only one that looking like this.
At least we are not disturbing them.
Yeah. And yeah just for the
curious. Yeah sneaking around.
Just sneaking the the little head.
But there are some people that walking in the corridor. Yeah.
This is only a drill. Don't
panic. Don't panic. Thank you.
Thank you for your cooperation.
Salamat.
Dan
I was outside and I saw so many people queueing for dinner
so I asked somebody and it's for everybody
ah we can have dinner? 
Yeah so we can go and have dinner. Ooh
Maybe we should pack our stuff first.
And then after dinner maybe we arrive.
So yeah, we just finished a dinner and we just heard
an announcement that
it's time to
give back the key
and check out. 
Nice, we don't need to leave the room immediately.
The agent just came and took the key
But we can stay here. Yeah. Just waiting for the boat to arrive
So we will take this time to summarize a little bit
about our experience here.
Because now we lived more than
24 hours here inside this ferry. Yeah.
I really enjoyed the ride
The 26 hours actually we didn't even see the time here
It went by so quickly. Yeah.
And before taking this ferry we thought that we
will do a lot of works because
we thought that we will get bored
and yeah. We didn't even have time to watch movies
Yeah we didn't
A lot of singing. Beautiful singing. Oh yeah.
Yeah. And it feels...
And it's nice just to enjoy the view
each time like this morning when we wake up and see the sunrise
Just by our window or going out and at 6 AM
there were already so many people outside.
And in the meantime you have lunch
that's why the time goes so fast actually
Yeah. Breakfast, nap, lunch 
and then enjoy the view, walk a little bit, then dinner and now it's time to leave already
Yeah already
We already arrived in Cebu
Will will you recommend this?
If you want to enjoy a journey and experience
and you have a little bit of time
and travel slowly
And travel just slowly and
I think that the ferry is definitely worth it
And they offered us a meal because of the delay. 
This is really nice because thanks to them when we arrive in Cebu at 8pm
we can go directly to the hotel, have shower and then sleep. Yeah.
This is so convenient. So thank you 2go for this
I think it was one of the
most pleasant
transportation mode I took in my life. Nice. So yeah
I even saw on internet but if you are super lucky
you can see some dolphins or
or even whale but we were not but
but yeah, if you are lucky, super nice. Wow.
If you see some whales or dolphins
Just let us know. Yeah.
Tag us somewhere
Hope it will help you too if you are
planning to come to the
Philippines and want to know
how to book, how much it cost and
how to yeah. But if you have
any question anyway you can
just comment in the video below
just ask question and we can we will reply it.
We are at Cebu, Cebu City. Yay.
Safe and sound and we are glad
that everything went smoothly. Yeah. So happy. 
And really excited to explore the city.
Definitely happy. Yay.
