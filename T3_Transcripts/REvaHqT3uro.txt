My friends and good afternoon welcome back to 
another video here in the Philippines. Guys in  
this video we are in El Nido so it's my first 
full video and I'm gonna tell you guys straight  
away that this day is not gone as planned because 
the weather can be pretty moody when you're out  
here on the islands, our boat tour was canceled so 
my brother's actually at the hotel doing a couple  
of things and I decided I'm gonna take a walk 
we've got some very dark clouds coming in so all  
morning actually we were surprised that the boat 
trip was canceled because it was so sunny but I  
guess probably some of the islands where we would 
go to take the boat to like the waves are a little  
bit dangerous so that's just something you got to 
keep in mind and if you're on a short itinerary  
you might be bummed out because you need to have 
a couple days of leniency depending on when you're  
here and what time of the year you're here if you 
want to just ensure that you're not going to have  
one of your days completely ruined and you won't 
be able to make it up on a future day because of  
the weather. So we're like the big thing to 
do in El Nido besides kind of cruise around  
explore like the island life is to go to all of 
the surrounding islands do boat trips, so there's  
like four different types of boat trips you can 
do and maybe I'll explain that to you in another  
video but like you know they're all like full day 
boat trips because there's so many islands in the  
El Nido area. So basically unfortunately because 
we did not get the opportunity to go on today's  
one that's one of the full sets of islands 
that we won't get the opportunity to explore.  
But anyways guys on a more positive note we 
are here inside the marketplace and we are  
going to be exploring this area. So we're gonna 
enter in we've got some markets here [__]
Okay, lang. All right very good very good so it 
looks like we've got ourselves a nice Marketplace  
over here and inside what can we find it looks 
like we've got some fresh hats on this side
all right some really nice looking hats 
there but I'm looking for something more  
that says the Philippines so we're gonna keep 
looking a little bit more though see what else  
we can locate inside the markets as you can see 
they've they're preparing themselves for the rain  
so we will head on in here 
we got El Nido shirts in here
Okay lang
all right okay those looks similar to my 
uh Birkenstocks I'm wearing right there  
well I'm Gonna Keep Looking here guys I'm looking 
for something custom to El Nido most likely  
but uh yeah lots of swimwear in there a 
few different types of designer Brands  
I've seen like Adidas I've seen Nike and uh we 
shall see what else we see over here oh it's  
got the shirts hanging low all right [__] some nicer shirts there swimsuits  
looks like it what do we got there El Nido 
Beach oh a red horse tank top that's one of  
their favorite beers around here Palawan so 
we're on the island of Palawan? We're on the  
island of Palawan? Yeah. This is Palawan? Yeah. Okay 
so maybe one of these tank tops might be nice yeah
okay I need a nice tank top that's 
gonna look good for me brother  
so maybe this one Palawan Philippines El Nido 
okay that all needle looks kind of cool too  
then we have gray same options in Gray oh and a 
nice dry fit that's super comfortable all right  
but I think I think this is gonna be the one if 
it fits okay is that a big size there do you have  
something bigger brother a large large yeah 
large no do you have any large size tank tops  
are you only have medium no we're 
right right oh what you have large yeah
Philippines okay so probably one of these 
ones that are hanging down lower than the rest
I do like this one but I think that's a medium 
too it looks like the one behind it's a large
okay oh that's a huge bummer I really like these 
but uh there's no sizes that are gonna fit me  
oh that's a bummer brother I 
wanted one but uh it's too small  
you can see I got I got a big belly 
I gotta cover so it's not gonna be  
possible salamat you sure you don't 
have any other options back there
all right well what else do we have here 
some good looking stuff some fresh bags there  
we did get a little money purse there we've got 
oh some fresh shoes yeah what about sizes for  
shoes 45 per week place oh you have multiple 
options 45. it's kind of a fresh pear plastic
yeah those are kind of nice but not certain  
size 13 so that's pretty big then 
so we've got Adidas all white
oh these look pretty nice
all right so we've got those as an 
option these right here Nike zooms yeah  
uh what size are these ones
44. what is that in U.S size Euro oh 
nine and a half oh that might fit and um
750. Do you have uh any special deals going on
because I got a pair in Manila for uh 350. no 
we are on an island how about the what's your  
best price 650 650. I could walk away with 
them for uh 500. no okay Barbies yeah yeah
I would do for 500 but that's the most I'll 
pay because when I was in Manila I bought  
a very similar pair like this and after four 
days of walking they broke so I don't know if  
these will break see for this 500. 500 okay 
do you happen to have a change for a 1000  
and I can try them on real quick try them on yeah
all right go ahead and try these on guys
they are 44 which I guess is 9.5 
in the US that's exactly my size
Nike Air Max shoes
so they do fit nice it feels 
like kind of like the ton
[ __ ] go for a run in these yeah I will take them 
and uh change please is there is there a way to  
make the see how that liner comes out is there 
glue no blue yeah because as you guys can see  
this is one of my big hesitations because 
when I bought the shoes in Manila they  
immediately like kind of fell apart I 
put my foot in there and took it out  
seems like those are pretty sturdy but I guess 
we'll have to uh settle for that quality because  
this seems to be the the common standard for this 
um price range well I think we can always find a  
shoe repair guy to put new Bottoms in because I 
do like the design I'll change please thank you
salamat thank you very much
so we are a proud new owner of the shoes so I 
usually face uh some people who have an opinion  
where I shouldn't have negotiated the price 
and some people where they say I should have  
negotiated in more the reason why I negotiated 
it because honestly 700 for like a really high  
quality pair of shoes is a great price right 
like 700 is probably like $15 or something like  
that close to it fifteen fourteen dollars but the 
reason why I negotiated down to 500 which is like  
eight or nine dollars is because I'm literally 
in Manila and if you guys watch my videos I got a  
pair of like Air Force Ones there and within four 
days of walking around and I did walk like four  
miles but like at the end of the day if it's a 
high quality shoe you know it should last a while  
and I paid 350 for those and so as soon as I put 
these Nikes on already the Bottom's like crunched  
up and they like broke right off so you can tell 
they're they're really just shoes more for show  
they're not meant to like last a long time or beat 
them up like you would with a pair of athletic  
shoes which is exactly what those are. All right so 
let's see what we've got over here in the market  
burp milk tea and snacks yes okay long yeah 
perfect perfect my name is James. James, all  
right James nice to meet you James uh what's 
the uh delicious food you have here are the uh

you're from El Nido yeah I live here and born 
here nice very nice oh wow it's raining a lot  
so you guys this is why the boat tour was 
canceled and see it is pouring outside right now
all right that's the uh what are those things made 
out of here okay and those are like it's like a  
chewy gummy thing yeah which one's your favorite 
out of all of these my favorite dispatcher  
oh Macho yeah oh okay I've never had matcha I 
almost died oh the coffee oh that looks delicious  
too I almost always get the cookies and cream 
because it's just you know like a sweet dessert
all right so there we go oh yeah nothing better  
than that sound of the ice 
mixing in making an ice cold
there we go the Shaker right there that's gonna 
be Ayos. Yes. So do you guys speak Tagalog here?  
yeah or a different dialect of it sometimes
wow look at this you can hear 
the sound of the rain coming  
right now guys that is exactly 
why the boat tour was canceled
wow all right and this is it 
let's look at maserat yeah
oh that's perfect
and so this is the labeling machine yeah yeah so 
you put that thing right up like that and then  
oh yeah uses the fork to push it right on 
down there presses the label right on top
and what does it burn it on uh 
it feels like uh seals it yeah
and that makes a delicious 
tea wow fantastic presentation
all right perfect
uh maybe yeah just a small one yeah
thank you all right we're gonna go ahead and 
uh Pop That Thing open three two one damn
oh yeah James very well done that is delicious
bubble tea is almost like a mini meal guys because
you're eating the gummy things while 
you're also having something that's  
like so similar to a milkshake and it's 
so good honestly before the Philippines  
excuse me I've only had like one or two of 
these in my life and I absolutely love them
thank you sweet thank you very much and that 
one's for you James thank you very much thank  
you sir thank you thank you all right how 
long do you think the rain's gonna happen  
uh or it comes and goes yeah all right well 
see you later James nice to meet you thank you
guys very delicious about two dollars for the 
large one it's a really good price fresh and  
delicious and we've got to wait around a minute 
or two because the uh rain is still coming down  
but it seems like it's just a quick quick drop and 
then it slows down a bit guys just finished the uh  
the last sip no more bubble tea James 
mother up thank you very much do you  
have a garbage I can put this in very Ayos 
maserat brother nice to meet you goodbye  
thank you, brother. All right I think the uh rain 
has slowed down enough where we can head back  
into the streets of El Nido. So, guys I'm walking 
down the road right now and yeah I mean you can  
see some pretty big name brand uh gas stations 
over here caltex and then I'm more of a I would  
guess a local gas station called biscuit or biku 
and of course the rain's starting to pick up again  
so looks like we're gonna get soaked but I think 
just a little bit further up here back towards  
the main part of El Nido is where we're gonna find 
some markets where maybe we can take cover problem  
is I have my drone in my backpack so it's probably 
gonna get destroyed right now maybe I can hide on  
under this little Pavilion right there all right 
we gotta run across we don't die and we made it
all right we got a little cover we can hide under 
here for a minute or two ah and now guys we wait  
so some of you guys are gonna ask why I didn't 
uh film a lot of videos in El Nido and this is  
part of the reason why guys this looks like one of 
those rainfalls that's not gonna be giving up easy  
so we probably need to uh locate ourselves one of 
these guys to take us around this could be our guy
kuya nope
now we got some tourists there 
cruising through the rain let the  
rain jacket time this guy's 
definitely gonna pick us up
kuya oh you got someone all right
well seems like everyone's already taken everyone  
we might have another guy coming down 
this way I'm sure everyone's taking these
you know uh here we go we got one I was gonna 
say what's he up to if he's uh skipping us
all right we are hopping in oh 
yeah just somewhere uh that way  
all right it's raining here a lot cool yeah
nice to meet you oh Gilbert Gilbert nice to meet 
you Gilbert we got we've got Cruiser we're taking  
here number three one three and as you can see 
we are inside here the views are a bit harder  
to see because we've got the rain right here 
but uh you know it's still cool to be cruising  
through Palawan today just hope I can show 
you guys some more stuff my original plan is  
I walked all the way down this side and started 
the video and I was gonna take you to some of  
these restaurants some of these markets right up 
here but I guess it's raining on the parade today  
all right as you can see guys we are 
almost back into the main town area  
but uh the weather's not fully cleared up yeah 
it's getting a little better I know kuya all right  
that's a Local's price I'll give you 100 
since you gave me the lowest price thank you  
all right guys we have made it and 
we're back now we gotta find my brother
okay lang thank you
all right we found the bro we're gonna 
get ourselves some motorbikes here
how much for uh mopeds here with our bikes
foreign
we might look we might look around brother 
all right guess everyone's got their mopeds  
today I didn't go to bed till like 
one so probably when you went to bed  
all right looks like this yeah exactly looks like 
this is the motorbike spots oh you only have one  
you have to get the other one all 
right are these are pet chickens MO
right there
the Big Daddy over there
nice so you have a two available
500 yeah for how long
10 o'clock in the morning for 500.
or 9 p.m anyway what is your 
thoughts it's a good price
yeah for 24 hours
uh 24 hours
for 12 hours
about uh 300 for 12 hours wow
foreign
they're giving us a deal of 350 for four hours 
uh you're Matthew no uh you're Matthew uh so  
it's your shop ah nice nice that's awesome 
got ourselves a fresh move at salamat kuya  
Let's test this one out here all right ready 
bro got myself a fresh pink motorbike here  
guys I'd say I look uh look good in this one 
so they gave it to us on uh at below empty gas  
so we've got to locate ourselves a 
gas station here and then after that
after that we can go cruising
all right bro
yeah yeah oh cause he's drunk well at least she's 
safe you spend all the money you just made on beer  
yeah both of the this is below empty oh
the pro almost got himself a crash 
there wild drivers around here
all right we're cruising through the uh area 
here the brakes are not great on this though  
guys so at the current moment we are cruising 
through looking for a gas station here but I  
guess that's uh one thing to check I mean I think 
we got a pretty good price four hours for 350 each
for us to get these for the evening but 
no gas included I guess that's uh normal  
or we just have to return it on an empty 
tank but in order to make it through here  
we need to fill this tank up first so 
we're cruising through the Village area
and it seems like there's more like Resorts as 
you drive further up oh that's a gas station
all right and let's fill them up
we need some fresh gas here brother
okay lang
a liter and a half yeah three liters 
total 1.5 liters 1.5 liters all right
see how this thing opens so guys we paid about 
83 pesos for a uh one liter per liter and we got  
about 1.5 liters per person and basically put 150 
so we almost got two full leaders in here as you  
can see that gives us about a quarter tank and so 
we're gonna be cruising up this way see where we  
end up in the El Nido area all right guys we're 
just cruising down this way sometimes it's nice  
this is like a such a great way to see the island 
is just get on the bike have no destination in  
mind and go for a nice cruise like we are not 
sure what we'll find going Inland like this but  
you'll never know unless you try 
it out you know what I'm saying
maganda hapon all right we're arriving to a place 
called Leo I'm not entirely certain what Leo is  
outdoor chilling spot maybe it's 
a resort or an area okay long
the local guards there Sito Uno looks like a 
bunch of like restaurants and stuff there tricycle  
terminal oh wow that is literally a terminal 
of tricycles but these ones all look the same
oh we got the Bros speeding up Full 
Speed Ahead oh we got a speed bump oh
all right turn right to Leo Beach  
that was a nice little cruise to get 
here and it's just a little pocket
I recognize this we're right by the airport so 
this is like a hangout spot you go left you're  
at the airport you go right I think this gets us 
to the beach got some major jungle Vibes though  
like a Wood Bridge that's bringing 
us through like I guess the swampland  
kumusta kuyo jungle this looks 
pretty epic that's for sure  
wow guys you just take a deep breath and 
you can smell the sweet smell of nature
a little [ __ ] yes sir just this 
because this way is okay yeah
can we check to see if anyone left excuse me sir
thank you
all right Full Speed Ahead
oh
yeah probably
all right looks like this is 
one option for parking Maybe
oh there's plenty of parking over here
no worries I see two spots brother
not allowed why is that
restricted okay
oh oh maybe it's a covid-19 camp
aign 19 camp which way kuya right turn we 
uh what about to the right to the right
all right
all right he's radioing him salamat
thank you Po all right so let's see where 
this brings us it's like a big nature area we  
got people taking a walk over there just need 
to find a spot to drop the bikes around here
vehicle park and motorbike parking right here 
all right and let's find ourselves a spot
we made it looks like we have made it to the Leo 
area some really exotic palm trees I mean look  
at how tall this thing is and it's not until the 
very very top probably say 50 feet maybe uh 10 to  
15 meters something like that high so insane palm 
trees but it gives it such an exotic look this is  
an official welcome to the Philippines. Oh! it looks 
like they're building a brand new Spa right there  
and it seems like a pretty decent sized Beach 
Grill to the left a nice little food truck  
right there to the right some good Tunes 
I'll get some tacos that's one thing I'll  
tell you in El Nido everywhere you can go you 
can find Mexican food in the Filipino version  
not as white of sand as like the main 
beach in El Nido but like or maybe it's  
because it's wet at the moment but still 
a really nice Vibe here a lot of like  
tree coverage leading up to the beach 
which gives it more of that jungle feel  
and one thing I've noticed in the Philippines 
all around they have like a dedicated smoking  
area you can't just like smoke outside anywhere 
have you noticed that too bro that's the first  
time I noticed it all over the Philippines 
they have dedicated sections for smokers to go
yeah guys so this is another perspective of seeing 
the area of uh El Nido this is the beach if you  
remember in the previous video when we were 
flying in that was the uh that was the dock  
right there the pier that we were looking out at 
and the plane basically flew right in there all  
the way down and landed as we're really close to 
the airport here oh actually this will be my first  
time touching the water bro Let's test it out see 
if it's any good all right oh yeah nice and warm  
so guys if you want to spend some time at Leo 
Beach if you got a lot of time in El Nido this  
would be from what it seems like a good place to 
spend like an afternoon in there's like shops and  
other areas that line this way and it's one of 
those beaches where if you're trying to enjoy  
the outside yet not get as much of a tan the 
tree coverage is is perfect for that I mean  
there's not too many beaches in the world I've 
seen that actually have like all these different  
types of trees that close to the beach so it is 
definitely what kind of sets this place apart  
and all down there I want to say there's like 
shops and things want to loop back this way bro  
so lots and lots of nice like uh cafes here 
it seems like giving up their smoothie bowls  
yoga classes and a uh a lot of like places to 
lounge around good digital Nomad working space  
to be close to the beach yet also close 
to a fresh delicious coffee in this area  
so yeah it's it's really nice guys you obviously 
been watching from the beginning of this video if  
you're still here and there's a lot of rain before 
but it can be moody here the weather and so you  
know you can just wait around for a couple hours 
and then well it's not like perfect beach weather  
right now it's at least not raining so it's still 
worth coming down if your part of your day gets  
rained upon and check out what's going on in this 
area. And I'm not sure if these are like hotels in  
these areas seems like there's some lounging areas 
up top bars on the first floor but it kind of has  
given me that Resort style vibe that first look 
definitely plenty of options if you've got a few  
days to do a little bit of a restaurant hopping 
in the area but yeah guys we only have a couple  
hours of daylight so we're probably not even a 
couple hours at this point probably one and a half  
hours so we're gonna keep cruising on the mopeds 
a little bit further to what's uh supposed to be  
an even better like Beach area so knock Pond yeah 
all right not fun as what is like 15 minutes from  
here uh yeah nice all right so we'll cruise over 
to the knock Pong guys and uh you'll get a small  
little tour with us of today's uh excitement 
exploring the different beaches in the area
good all right we're heading back out this way and
looks like we're gonna be going to the uh right
let's get this bread
all right we're about 15 minutes away and as you 
can see this is some of the nature here in Boracay  
more of those beautiful palm trees and just a 
really wet feeling climate around here I will  
say I love the island but you're hot sticky and 
humid all the time during this time of the year  
I like it because it's Island 
line been cruising for a bit  
uh very rural is a better way to say it 
not too much except more and more jungles  
but a nice peaceful drive especially now 
that the sun's coming out. Hello El Nido.
Guys we've got a rainbow in the distance I 
don't know if you can see that on the camera  
but we've got a knife rainbow 
way out there in the distance
from making progress we got local 
Filipino traffic right there
is it
one back uh over this way and we're 
gonna take a left we're actually at  
this house right here at the left 
of the corner and they told us to  
go this way so we just retraced our 
route spent 30 minutes going this way
all right all right we have located the beach  
after uh passing it there it is 
not fun beach oh it's muddy as hell
let's hope I don't crash
that's what bumpy ass road 
going down this way my friends
foreign
all right it's definitely a 
more villagey area over here
that's a good sign
whoa we got the Ducks hanging 
out here down boy down boy sit
yeah this is one muddy ass Road holy [ __ ]
wow it's literally sludge oh definitely if you're  
riding around here go real slow I got my 
feet on the ground almost what a mission
you know which way bro all right we have made it 
what an adventure all right it's a interesting  
arrival spot here park the mopeds there right 
here we've got some really thick barbed wire you  
think they're keeping like a T-rex or something 
inside of here it's like the longest barbell  
I've ever seen so we've got some cows in there 
a little baby calf right there too and this is  
going to be the very commonly spoken 
about Beach that we're going to show  
you guys we're only up just a little bit of time 
here because unfortunately with a couple wrong  
turns and confusion on the directions we only just 
arrived about 45 minutes before the Sun is setting  
and it looks like we're hitting a super 
high tide too from the distance here
oh bro I'm thinking about 
getting a coconut you want one
uh your coconuts coconuts yeah can 
we have two coconut please kuya  
two fresh ones with the slaughter device 
there we go chopping that thing right up
so this is uh from Philippines 
coconut yeah locally grown  
El Nido coconut oh look at 
that spraying everywhere
landu nice to meet you landu  
oh so we got one Delicious coconut right there 
oh don't want to get hit with that dagger and
all right you're really just absolutely smashes 
that thing how many coconuts you sell per day  
what how many coconuts do you sell per day
and magkano kuya 50 okay all 
right oh I got it bro feeds

family one extra coconut too salamat kuya enjoy
oh thank you bro hey so we've got two fresh 
are these King coconuts King coconuts all right  
here we go we're gonna go 
ahead and test this thing out
drink about two-thirds of it right there delish my 
friends I do love the king coconuts when they're  
able to get them uh hold right out right when 
they're like ice cold you know if they keep them  
in a cooler but honestly this is so refreshing 
after a solid hour drive here right at the sunset  
we got a little Misty rain in the distance here 
but waves crashing a very light sunset in the  
distance behind that little mountain right there 
in this couple looks like tourists showing right  
there so it's really like it feels way more like 
a local beach than the other Beach we just showed  
you but still you know like definitely designed 
for the tourism but like not as like overrun as  
some of the other places we've seen in terms 
of like amount of development I just tasted  
this one and it's got like maybe it's not ripe 
or something it's got like a soury like bitter  
app never once had a coconut like that before all 
right so we're getting to a little Isthmus here as  
you can see we've got water on both sides coming 
in here and then coming in here and then we have  
both sitting right up there in the middle and it 
leads to this then there's like one little house  
sitting out there on that island in the distance 
and a couple more that just surround this just  
goes to show you like that's how there's like 7000 
different islands in the Philippines they're  
just kind of like pop up in every direction you 
look you're gonna see all these little Islands  
oh look at this we've got a couple calves right 
here cruising around the beach pretty good life  
this little uh car right there is drinking a 
coconut Yum Yum Yum yeah a little one went for  
a little run got the Zoomies in them there's 
my brother's future house right there right  
yeah no it's a really really beautiful 
place it looks like it's someone's home  
hard to tell but yeah gate leading right up to 
this beautiful palace of a house surrounded by  
palm trees such a vibe so yeah guys a 
pretty quick look at the side of the island  
yeah I'm hoping to visit El Nido again 
in the future because obviously some of  
these videos have been pretty fast paced 
through here and I haven't like fully dove  
into the culture of things to do and you 
know everything in there but it's like a  
nice little highlight both to get me excited 
and you guys excited when I Explore More of
