Hello good looking!
Have you ever seen a whale shark in person?
Well, in today's video, we're taking you on
a cool adventure to see these amazing creatures!
And here's the kicker - it's also Dan's first time experiencing this.
 So, buckle up and get ready for some mind
blowing underwater action as we dive into
the world of these giant and graceful whale
sharks!
If you don't understand what I'm saying, please
turn on the subtitles.
Whale sharks are incredibly massive beings,
reaching a size comparable to that of a school bus.
They're actually the largest fish in the world.
But guess what's on their menu?
You won't believe it - despite their massive
size, they chow down on teeny-tiny stuff like
plankton, small crustaceans, and little fishies.
Imagine a five foot wide mouth with these
filter pad thingies inside – that's how
they eat.
They gulp water and then filter out the munchies.
Dan's diving into the deep with these giants
for the first time, and man, he's stoked!
Seeing his excitement is a blast because I
was here like 9 years ago with my buddies.
It's like reliving the fun through his eyes.
Watching him all pumped up and swimming alongside
those whale sharks is pure joy.
He's like a kid who just got the coolest present
ever – grinning ear to ear at the sight
of these massive fish.
Now, about the whole Oslob whale shark thing.
There's been talk that it's not cool 'cause
they get trapped in nets.
But let me set the record straight.
I was right there, and I saw no nets below
them.
These whale sharks are basically free to swim
off whenever they feel like it.
So, it's not like they're held against their
will or anything.
Just wanted to clear that up!
And who doesn't like free food, that is a
good price.
Quick heads up: skip the sunblock, perfume,
and tan oil before you dive in with the whale
sharks.
A lot of these products have chemicals that
aren't great for them.
We got you covered – just like we did.
We hopped on the first boat at 6 AM, no need
for any sunblock hassle.
So, remember, get here early and go natural
to make sure those majestic creatures stay
happy and healthy!
And that's a wrap, my friend! 
I really hope you had a blast on this tour with us. 
Oh, and if you're curious about the nightlife in Moalboal
don't miss the video in the corner. We had an absolute blast and shared some crazy fun times there. 
So, until the next adventure, take care and catch you later!
