We actually spent the last three months stranded in Shagawa. I'm just going back to Manila very recently. So, it's stranded in the video, right? So, before we start, I just want to give a shout out to everybody who gives a new language try. I know how hard it can be to overcome your own inner insecurities. So, yeah, I'll get back to this maybe within this video, but I know how hard it can be to put yourself out there to say something in a wrong way. So, but I think that Bull and Alloria are doing... They are putting out a funny vlog for the viewers, so can't wait to see that. Let's jump in. Cotton. Cotton. Cotton. Cotton. Cotton. Do you hear this? Yes. So, lately, my Usong meme going around and there's all these articles about the Filipino accent is named the sexiest accent. Have you seen those? Yeah. Have you guys seen those? All of it. I thought about it. What could be my own long? How come only right now they're noticing Filipinos have the sexiest accents? I always thought that. Especially, do you normally say that love your accent? It's so, like, sexy. Yeah, what accent? Even when she goes to the US, they buy your coughs, play friends. They say her accents are really cute and everything she goes with. What accent? I remember when I first met the Aya Han or the Vampi. I love your accent. Like, what? The Filipino accent is, it's subtle. It's really subtle, but it's distinct. It's subtle. So, yeah, let's do it. This is a trend. We didn't start this trend. We don't roast if you hate it. We'll set up what langanapito. Okay, wait, wait, wait. Oh, oops. Sorry. I just want to stop quickly. I remember when we came to the US, a lot of people said, oh, you sound like Arnold Schwarzenegger. So, like, okay. And especially, I was very shy to talk to people because I felt like I'm not 100% aware of all the words and all the things that people are saying. And I wasn't sure if anybody understands me. So, I just talked and a lot of people did the same. They said, I love your accent. It's very cute. So, it's like, it's cute. What? What? I think it's about time that I drop a little bit of story time on you guys. Before we got our own washer here in the apartment, I used to bring my laundry to a quaint little place in the neighborhood. Now, I would like to go to Yardstick, order myself a cup of coffee, go to the laundry, drop it off, pick up my coffee from Yardstick, and they found it hilarious every single time because I'd go in there and I'd say, hey, can I get a flat white? And I'll pick it up later because I'm going to the laundry and then I get asked, I said, cool, I'll be back. And I was like, ah, you did it, you knew. And I was, I first was like, why is this so funny? I'll be back. What's so funny about that? I, I realized now what they found funny. Maybe I'll find a clip and insert it right here. I'll be back.
