 Future Friday. The freshest. Bali has shown me like two seconds actually. She hasn't shown me anything. I just see the picture. Look what I'm looking at. What the f***? This is a music channel. She has a mic. She's already giving a lecture. Well, I don't know. Painting someone's lips with a knife. No, it's microblading. I think you know how people can like microblade their eyebrows. You can do the same for your lips. Painting. I like the sound of the metal. Yeah, the answer is something. Wow. This is the part where I was like, this makes no sense. She's actually so good. How is she doing? I'm like, I broke my leg or something. And I'm the doctor. Oh, please. Go stop connoble. I don't know what I'm like. I did not answer. So, go stop connoble. I'm in doubt. And then, so what am I? And then, in an exact way, go stop connoble. Working on the f***ing key change. She's like one second. One second. Oh, that's hot. What the f***? What the hell, Philippines? What is this? She's actually like, she's murdering that. She's just murdering that. She just didn't know what the f***ing thing was. She's murdering that. She's murdering that. She just didn't know what the f***ing thing was. Awesome. Hi. Oh, yes. What you want to do is just make a film. Yes. Well, it's nice to be with you. You gotta tell the people how to get to the far behind our embassy. SUPER photos What a rest of my videos! It's a revolution! Where is the rest of that video? Also, can I just have a moment? Can I just have a moment, please? Because this makes absolutely no sense to me. The fact that she is so good, technically speaking, you can see her jaw really working through that expansion, like that space for the belt to actually technically work. But her whistle register was so good. It was so great. And then you're like, how are you doing your job? And the girl that's getting her lips done is literally got a concert for free, for no reason. Maybe she's on a steacher. She paid for the treatment. But treatment comes with this song included. Maybe she's on the anesthesia. How do you not react to this? I think I should. Say you're like that. I'm not getting my lips done. You only have a local anesthesia. I should be in the middle. Oh my god, you're like, you're like, you're like, you're stuck. When you go to the dentist, you know? Because people think this is like, you know, maybe because we're recording, you know, it's like this big reaction. It's not me. No, guys. No. It's like, it comes out. You know what? You just have to do the key change. Yeah. I've won the full version anyways. Oh, thank you. Oh my god. This is like, this is like, this is like, this is like, a proper like serious establishment. You got Grammy Awards. Shit. Mori said version. No. Yeah, she did the Mori version. She did the Mori squeak. I don't look like this. This woman decided to do the, the harder version of this. Wow. Yo, the comments have to chill on this though. People are saying they're requesting songs for this woman to do. Well, okay, relax, bro. She is a dog. Oh, I don't know which one she is. I'm a petition. I'm a petition. I don't know what that means. What does an esthetician? What is that word? What is that word? They do the microplating and like, what's microplating me? Okay. So like, I just explained it at the beginning of a video. Oh, they pay your lips. Yeah. Basically, basically, but you also have other, other treatments like, um, facials and the hair is in your hair, in your eye. They don't bother me. What? How does that know what they are? They're literally right there in your, your ears, your iris. No, so I was saying, can I explain or do you want to like be more annoying? Pixively behavior. I guess not then. I just got some thinking about that. Get that girl in the studio. She obviously, something about the lips, you see? I love other patients. I get a comedy show. This is mental. Everything about this video is so bizarre, extraordinary. Like, it's so weird. She's a great singer. She's incredible. It's not a meme. Like, maybe, because if she's bad, though, then it's quite bad work ethic, isn't it? It's like, fuck, you're just belting in my ear. But because he sounds good. Because it's so nice. No one's going to care. No, I actually, here's the thing. The fact that she... Also, it is like, it's Filipino culture is different. It really is, but listen to me, listen to me. There is something so cool about the fact that she is at her day job, doing what she has studied and practiced and is awarded for and has a reputation. She's like an absolute, like, better than singers that I have seen in paid venues. Wow, that's quite awesome. Isn't that wild? Is it saying? She's better than... What, what? She's better than some of the people that we might or may not know from the top 50 in the UK. That's what I'll say. I'll say that confidently. Because like, there's no... Honestly, there's no post work, there's no studio, there's no nothing. She's just singing. And this song is in hercible ear. Yeah, this song is so crazy. And the fact is that she didn't even, like, if she would have done this song exactly how it was in that record. She would have been like, wow, incredible, amazing. She went on ahead and did like her own spin off, wet whistle notes and crazy runs that only work for her because she's an amazing singer. Yeah, well, giving her a continue to do her job. Well, giving some woman some Kim Kardashian lips. Like, what the f*** did this is crazy? Is she a surgeon? Is that what you said, an aesthetician? No, a statistician. They're not surgeons. They do microblades, yeah, yeah, yeah, I got that. What is an aesthetician? A Googler. Googler. A statistician. I don't know how to spell that. A statisticians. Our skincare professionals work in a cosmetic or salon environment. So skincare professionals. Did you learn what he was? No, I have no ideas. I'm back to zero. Google didn't do it job. A school didn't do it job. One of the people who did it by a good time. I'm going to vomit out.
