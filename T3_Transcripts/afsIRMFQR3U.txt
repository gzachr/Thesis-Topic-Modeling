 I hope you can see it. I hope you can see it. We're back home, back from the mountain. And we really hope the bridge gets fixed soon. It's very difficult for them, everybody in the community. But things like this, the community comes together. Nobody goes with like food, everybody makes sure that everyone has what they need. It means going down and collecting groceries, going to the market, or sharing vegetables and fruits that have been grown, eggs from chickens. Even me and the people in the province will do this. They look out for each other. It's the beauty living in the Philippines. People are so nice, they're so kind and generous. Can't explain it really. It's a bit like the UK used to be, in my opinion, in any way. Back when I was growing up, people used to share a lot of things. They friendly to each other. As times gone on, it's not always the same everywhere. Obviously, it depends where you live, it turns on your neighbours. There are some fantastic communities in the UK. But speaking from personal experience, where we were, it wasn't like that. And it was a shame. But coming back here to the province, back to the Philippines, it feels like going back in time. There they are, there's Mr. Cream. And a creamy boy, there's Mr. Cream. Now, his nice green collar. It's not too tight as a cream. Nice, nice, nice fine. It's very fetching. Very handsome with it on. Very pokey. It cow guapo, but tango la lacquie. Oh, but tangaso. But tangaso. Is it, is it not a young human? It cow pokey, Mr. Cream. It's not a young human. It's not a young human. It's not a young human. It's not a young human. It's not a young human. It's a bit warm, isn't it, my darling? I feel early, but it's already 9 o'clock. 9 o'clock still. Every in the province has been up for four hours already doing their work. And we're just getting started on ours now. I folks are a bit crackly. I think the change of season here is giving us a lot of time. I think it's a bit of a change of season. I folks are a bit crackly. I think the change of season here is giving us both a little bit of a cold. First cold in two years. It's really the first cold we've had in over two years. I think it was a change of season. It went to the hot season, but then we had that storm. It really was cold here. It may laugh at me, cold in the Philippines, but the seasons changed. The seasons changed and it got cold down to 20 degrees even, 22 degrees. For us in the Philippines, it's very cold as we're used to. One more weather now, we've acclimatized. So what we've got here is we have bamboo and papaya. They sort of got a bit joined together here. Bit of a mix really. You've got the bamboo there. And the papaya as a result is been a bit displaced. Now this papaya is the one that we planted. It was only very small. We transplanted it. We put it here, as you can see, unlike the other one, it's not flowering very much. Nothing's growing. So really this papaya has got no chance of fruiting at the moment. It's not really in the healthiest condition due to being a bit crammed in there. Crammed in there with a bamboo and a mullungae. So our intention still is to get some grass over the next week or two. Now the storm's gone, the rain's gone. It's a great time to get some grass. We left a water it daily to make sure it doesn't dry out. So Jane's going to cut the bamboo out and we can replant it. I'm going to get some bamboo to support it. So I need to put some bamboo to kind of like that. I'm going to put some bamboo in there. I'm going to put some bamboo in there. I'm going to put some bamboo in there. I'm going to put some bamboo in there. I'm going to put some bamboo in there. I'm going to put some bamboo in there. I'm going to put some bamboo in there. I'm going to put some bamboo in there. I'm going to put some bamboo in there. I'm going to put some bamboo in there. I'm going to put some bamboo in there. I'm going to put some bamboo in there. I'm going to put some bamboo in there. Jane's making a bamboo support for the papaya to hang on to. To try to straighten it out, try to help it. So we're going to try and have two papaya trees in the garden, bearing fruit this year. So we're going to start planting some fruits and vegetables. We're going to have a nursery where we can start from seeds. I don't really have green fingers, so to speak, but I'm going to give it a go. It's always good to learn. Cookie, come on, you and your girlfriend. Cookie's got a girlfriend. So there he is, Cookie. I think he's got a girlfriend. Cookie, set your girlfriend. Cookie, let's Cookie, let's cream the other white dog. Let's go friend, look at them. We're going to run. Cookie, your girlfriend. Cookie, your girlfriend. Come back. You're too young. You're too young, you have to finish your school first. Come on Cookie, who are you? Who are you? You're Cookie's girlfriend. Cookie, you've got something to tell us. Cookie, you've got something to tell us. But dear, let's dog's two youngs, nothing to do with you. Oh yeah, he's already got a girlfriend. Dear, what would the neighbours think? Cookie, come on. So there's the flamera kitchen up there. I don't know what they're doing, but they're barking at the owners. Maybe that's where I get it now. So Cookie's girlfriend belongs to flamera kitchen. That's what he likes, so he's after the free food. Come on Cookie, come on. Boy, you've got a girlfriend, eh? You've got a girlfriend, eh? Is this blue column, is it? Let's go, come on. Let's go. So Jane bought me these. 59 peso, gardening gloves. 59? No. It's native plus. Life is expensive, probably. 96 peso? Yeah. Probably on par with what you're paying the UK for, pair gloves like this. Oh, but they stick together soon. Oh, my hands are stuck. There we are. You've got to not leave them into a hot place. They're always sort of melting to each other. But they're nice and padded. So, I've got these from gardening. We're going to try and start planting some of our seeds. Going to create a nursery for plants. And seedlings. We've got some pots. Lots of seeds. This is something I've always had an interest in. I've never been good at it. Back in England, I would try to plant some things. Sometimes a little bit of success. I managed to grow blueberries one year, but they didn't last long. Apples and pears. Mustard diet. Yeah. They didn't really work. Strawberries. No. Why do you think it? I think, probably because I was a bit too lazy. Looking after them. You don't love. You need to love. But when you were in England, it rained a lot. It was a different environment where we lived. It was noisy. It was busy. A lot of cars had gone up and down. A lot of silence. The garden was never really a relaxing place. So, I didn't have much interest staying outside for long. Growing up though, my mum was always in the garden doing this sort of thing. We were out with kids playing around. It was quiet. It was peaceful. I moved into my own house. It wasn't quite the same. But moving here. It's boiled all back. It's quiet here. It's peaceful. You encouraged to go outside to do things. And I may not have green fingers, but I'm willing to learn. I want to give this a go. See if I can grow some stuff. So there's no snows and stuff in here. Yeezy wiggly in here. Yeezy wiggly worm. No, no, no, no, no, no. James, are afraid of anything there. Wiggles like that. Even jelly worms. OK, so we have some seeds. I have two jalapeno peppers. I'm going to start them in these pots. I probably need to learn a bit from gene. Gene's much better at gardening than I am. It's the Sacor receive, the bonsai. It's the Japanese cherry blossom. And I hope it grows. I have a proper cherry blossom tree here in the Philippines. It's a Sacorva tree. There's nothing quite like it when they bloom, something really special. My mum used to have one in England. I would love to grow this. It was to grow into a tree. Probably will take 15 years or so to really get big and blossom every year. But we're not going anywhere. We're going to stay here forever. So we plant it now. And in the future. Who knows, maybe we'll have our own. There he goes. His favourite sea. His lookout. It's where he can see. See the mountain. You can see the sky. The clouds. And he can just stay dream. So this cubo behind me. It's one of my favourite places in the house. It's nice to be outside with nature. You can hear the birds. I feel like a nice coral breeze. And it's really peaceful and quiet. Really nice here. I like to go in there. Sometimes to meditate. Sometimes to pray. It's nice for some quiet time. Be outside. But it's still inside if you know what I mean. And the boys like it too. They love this chair. They get a great view. And they like to wait for me to come out. They're very loyal dogs. But they're more than dogs. They're pets. They're part of the family. We love these boys. We love these boys. We love these boys. We love these boys. We love these boys. We love these boys. We love these boys. We love these boys. We love these boys. We love these boys. We love these boys. We love these boys. We love these boys. We love these boys. We love these boys. We love these boys.
