 Hello, hi, my name is Dylan, I'm here at the book for lunch, yeah? Yeah? You would miss this place so you could so easily walk past this, like I can't believe it's just this such a hidden gem. Wow. Right guys, so we've got an air-noi, as you've seen from the outside, it looks like a normal high-syn stuff like that. Yeah, we'll go on in in a minute, I'm gonna get my coat and stuff off soon. See you soon. Alright, so hello, yes, nice to meet you. That's class in here, it's so nice, like. Wow. So guys, we're here now, I like like, oh my goodness, look at it, it's just so like, so filipino and stuff like that, but all the decorations and stuff, look at this. Look how nice sleep-oos tables are night and stuff like that. I have just been offered to sit here, but I'd rather you guys get to see some nice stuff from the back room and stuff like that, and then the kitchen is back there and stuff too. But this is so cool, so we're in Belfast, United Kingdom. You may have seen the offer of filipino street food, videos that I've did, and like, Kanye Bangor and stuff like that, but this one just looks very posh and stuff in here, so y'all get sat down here not. What's your name, anyway? Hey, my best. Best. Yes. Do you work here, like, or? No, I'm not taking an order. Ah, okay, cool. For takeout. For takeout? Yes. I'm like, have you known about this place long then, like, or, yeah, like how long has it been here? No, I love your opinion, not long, isn't it? No idea. But it's been before, it's supposed to be before a puppet. So guys, look at this cool seat over here. Like, it's like basically just a big chunk out of a tree and then carved into my seat. And the fame of like all the wooden and like bamboo and stuff over here, the Satsang Kingdom Kong, and all the loveliness. But yes, nice look. And we'll get, look at another menu soon, this is a boost. See what cool things that they have on offer. And we'll hopefully get some new things. And we have... They have seats. Yes. ...tried the C6, so we have in the upper places. So maybe we should try it here to see what it's like. And Ben also tried maybe a few things that we haven't tried before anywhere else. And it'll just be nice to experience that. And for those of you who don't know, I am planning on getting my flight booked over to the Philippines at the end of the month. And planning to be going sort of mid to end of August. And so, yeah, I'm looking forward to come in to see everyone over there. I'm trying some Filipino food over there. But this is the closest I think I can get while I'm here in Belfast waiting to do the... ...village. So I'll see you. Yeah, yeah. That said, that she's a very good group. Like, so yeah, they're looking up the menu soon. Did you try the magnet, the crispy pork? What's it called, bagnet? That's the pork. So it's crispy pork. It's roasted crispy pork. Okay, roasted crispy pork. You get salivated or we can have it with rice or you can have it with us. So, leave it vinegar. It's the love that you make it. What's it called again? Bagnet. Bagnet. Bagnet. Alright, I have to try it off then. And back. You like the pork crackling? Pork, I do like pork crackling, yes. So you think I'll... I'm gonna stick in the nice thing in your bag. Oh, you think it's the next level. Okay, okay. Well, if that's just recommending it, then we'll get to... That's like, will you pour it all at the time? Yeah, then you are in here all the time you're saying. It's getting all the cake looks, so... Yeah. If it's being recommended by Filipino, then of course we have to try it. And definitely. That is the best of it. Yeah, this is our famous... Okay. So this is the best of it, Bagnet. Yeah, so that is... I don't know about that. Okay, okay. So... I'll take away... We'll get ours on a plate and stuff them. But yeah, I don't think we're gonna get it. Hi, Vermeer, how's it going? Nice to meet you. Your place looks lovely. So it does like, really, really, really nice. And it's so hidden. I know I've said it above, but yeah. And once you're naming it, it's very... Very memorable, right? Very memorable. Yeah, right, right. Are you wearing it? Are you wearing it? Are you wearing it? Okay. Oh, that's bad. Ray, Les, and I don't know how to... Okay. It makes sense, no guys. That's the name of our name, right? No, I'm not a person, but I'm a man. But I'm a man. Yeah, it makes me feel really nice. If you ask it down there or... Because you said that he wants it, because the bottom of the window, because when it's going to the bottom, he's... Very authentic, isn't it? It's mostly Filipino people who come here or for some people, maybe from here. Yeah, there's some people that come from here. And actually, they love our part, Lianpo. Big Lianpo. You know, like the one that part Lianpo, but we call... Oh, oh. So we're going to taste that later. Yes. And the fish people... Shanghai. So people from here, they love the national. Oh, from Shanghai? Yeah, so... So everywhere, pretty much. Yeah. So I'll give you that one later. And Tories. I'm Tories. From England from... If they can find it. If they can find it. Yeah, just like a sick one. So what we're going to do is, well, just going to bring you food. Is that okay? Yeah, and you just... Oh, does it come out? Yeah. Oh, cool. And I said, goodlady, see this? A moot's in the water. Oh, look at this. It's a bit like a sea of dirt. Doesn't look like it's going to come out. And then it just comes out. As interesting as bad as I thought it was interesting. Like so. There you go. So it seems pretty much guys. But this pork bag net is called by different names then. So in Kaliya, it was left on Kuala Lai. And back in with the mang tamas. And maybe that's because it was called that. Maybe that's what makes it different. But this one is called something different. But it is still the same sort of like basis of being like the lightly tried pork. But this one comes with like a vinegar, a favor saying anyway. And then anything that I get after vaat is going to be like a complete surprise. Because I haven't really ordered anything. I'll let you guys look at the menu actually. Anyway, just in case you want it to see. But everything that I'm going to be getting is like surprise. So yeah guys, it's showing basically different types of stuff there. Like chicken lollipop and what does it say? Tampura. I think Tina, my friend Dean's wife, she likes that. She got a button like a street food blog that they did. And then let's see. Me and Korra. So that's the bag net that I'm getting with the cucumber onion salad in a great bit. And then there's also stuff like a chicken cut to salad. And stuff like that, grill chicken. What's that? Tampura chicken with sweetened sour salsam cards. And then like fish menus and stuff like that. I'll continue looking guys. But there's quite a big menu here actually. And it's lovely, presented and stuff. There's beef stick. I think I've tried that. So it's like the BISTIK, the stick. Which is like, oh, it's not about, sorry, it's just beef stick. It actually is beef stick. But the stick is then beef with the onions, isn't it? And then there's like, tomatoes and stuff that we're showing. All like different combinations and stuff that you can get. I'm also seeing here the sizzling menu. We made it get at least one thing from that. Because I do like sizzling food. But first there's sizzling, sea sick, sizzling, pasta. I can't even pronounce these things properly guys. I'm pretty sure we're all good anyway. Anything that's on a nice sizzling plate. The sizzles, it's got to be good. And then there's like a spicy mix of seafood and stuff like that. Also a few desserts, banana, creamy caramel. Fresh, pretty popular, but in stuff like that. So yeah, big range. So that's the menu. As I said, we're getting a surprise. So we'll find out. Putting away the menu and I've just seen this cool thing. Like, what does this guy doing? So it's Campa Wano, Sa Belfast. What is it like a comedian or something? Some sort of show that you can go to. That's cool, you just wouldn't know about these things. Unless you came and found out if I filmed somewhere right here. Oh good, this. Right guys. Something's already got right. So this is our Borg Shanghai. Here. Okay. So what is this? Sorry, like... Borg Shanghai is a means sport. We are the vegetable. Okay, means sport. And that's it. Thank you so much. Thank you. Let me know if you guys better over in the Philippines. Like it looks similar to what you would get. I think possibly this is like straight food, isn't it? It's like... Here guys, would you say this? Would you get this like on the street? I was like straight food? Huh? With this like on the straight food, do you think? Yeah. Yeah, you can find us as well. So you would get this sometimes on like the stalls and then like they would be like that. So yeah. Yeah, it does look like straight food, isn't it? Yeah, I'm just getting a bit of a special lunch again. Yeah, yeah. So in here, it's just like a starter. A starter, yes. Yeah. But not going to be a hot, hot, hot, and then. So this is the first time you have a place that one? I think so. Probably there's here, but it's different. It's different. I've tried similar things to it. So after, yes, like a spring roll, but it's different than a spring roll. And I think it's like a bit darker. I'm very like smaller than some of the spring rolls that I've tried before. Yeah. And it comes with rocket and stuff, I suppose, which is different than I would usually help my spring rolls. So yeah, lovely. Thank you. Thank you. It's like we test two things there. I pulled them for, what do you call them? I don't know what they're called. I do, but it's not in my head. I just noticed we're here too, guys. This is the first thing I love Baracka. We have been to Baracka before, and that was about 10 years ago, wasn't it? We'll be back, I'm sure, anyway. Continuing to enjoy this. This is our... Whoa! This is our crispy butter. Guys, look at this. Whoa, that's amazing, like, so big. So big, yeah. Wow. They have a customer here before, from here. Yeah? And you can able to finish the whole thing. You was able to finish all of it. Like, guys, I don't know if I'm going to be able to do that. Like, look at this. What? So that's like the poor crackling thing on the mass of big stick things. That's class, like, look at that. When there's the vinegar at stuff in it for afterwards, or for during it to dip in and stuff like that. And I'm going to make sure you guys can see this properly. I'm not going to get a car if there we bit here, but I'm... Right, guys. Let's see. Let's try and tackle this. See what it's like. I've got my fork here. I'm going to go in the light. Get the nice and nice suppose. I'm going to be just first actually. Oh, look at that. Alright, I'm going to get my plate over here and move on. It's like, where do you want to go? It's like where do you begin with this sort of size of food over this? Oh, guys. Oh, wait. Did you see? It's first like the inside of it and stuff. And then I can just like, rip it off. Set it on. Mmm. So, G.C. already. Look about it just full straight off like once you get that first cotton. And then inside, it smells beautiful too. Oh, my goodness, guys. This is class like. Right. Okay. Let's cut in the best and dip in there and I sauce here. I think I'm just going to have to pick guys first. First we've got a very little cotton. Right. First five guys. Let's see. Two more. Perfect. So, first pick. So, about like about tangy sort of like that really makes it like bit of it just fell out and bit of it actually. I'm going to like get a bit of sort of soup about going on in here. I don't know, I'll prepare. And that's just more of like the crackling part that I've got. Still to try to actually like really juicy part of the actual meat. Because I'm getting closer to it after cutting. Got a bit of hot my force. Mmm. Oh wow. So good guys. Just a little bit of theatricalness all but like like about a big massive bone. I'm showing it like my how I've never had it like this before. Right. I'm going to shut up and just start eating this now. So good. And I'll see if I can finish it. Oh my goodness guys, there's more coming. Sizzling. What is going on? What's best? This is the blacknet character. This is the blacknet. What was best? Oh, this is crispy butter. Ah, fork shank. Fork shank, right? Yeah. And that's the blacknet guys. Look at it sizzling away. I think it's all right. I think it's all right. Guys, I am so impressed by this. This is nuts like. I said just how nicely it's all like presented and everything. This is amazing. This is truly class like. I'm going to try a bit of a slide to see what it's like. It does look very hot still. But the pork also looks really nice and juicy and still. And it's all bubbling away. If I were like, I'm not going to be able to finish all of this. Like, but I mean, we'll do our best. So let's get a wee bit of a super onto the plate to cool down. Let's see. Oh, and it's came with another dip there as you can see. So we'll maybe dip it into that and see what it's like with that too. Okay, into this. I'm going to get a wee bite off the deer. It's been about a step forward. So it tastes completely different actually. That should look like something. Oh, wow. Okay. It's about price to come guys. That's hard. It's all. If you want eggs or something like that. And no of a hot, that's great, right? Yeah. Yeah. So this is like a sauce. Yeah. I did get this one into it. I don't know. Okay. Right. Okay. Right. Right. Let's see. Lip and hack. Amazing. Let's move this wee sauce thing over here to get a good wee dipping action going on there. Thoughts about this nice and close up. Goodness. Let's see. Running out of space here. I didn't think that was going to be a good one. I just used to see if we have to wrap them here. Oh. More guys. Just the C6 just arrived. What? Brilliant. Okay. Guys, flip. Look at that. Sizzling C6. We've got to try all this stuff just to like see what it is and we need to get this thing which is a different flavor of it. Like, I mean, oh my goodness. Look at all this food. Amazing. Okay. I've got this. I'll dip it into this soup thing now. Let's get it completely soaked in to see what it's like. And we'll see how this is. Snoy and comparison. The what it was always second to go. Before I could even describe it, everything just came actually soaked. The initial thing, it was like more, more like slightly sweeter with a bit more of a saltiness too. That's about one there. That was on this one. And the C6. I don't know yet. We need to do this snoy after trying it and this different soup thing. So let's see. Okay. It's like a, like a nuttiness too or something. It's very morish. It's about a lovely like background nuttiness too. It's the best way. And creamy, it's very creamy. It's like a lovely soup that you would get. Like, sound like a cold winter's day or something like that. It reminds me of something like that. It's just like really like a warm, warm for hard up. Kind of the bones up and stuff like that. It's really nice for about making it into it actually. Let's get the C6 over here. Let's just go in full of it. Look about. Nice golden spins and everything through guys. I'm the steam. I might keep up. In fact, no. That's a bit too warm still. Believe it on the spin bar guys. I'm going to try a bit more of that soy actually. I think I'm going to dip this into this soup actually because I quite like the cream in the soda. Let's see. Mmm. Absolutely beautiful. Right guys. C6. Oh, for those of you who don't know, I've actually ordered my salt phone at those dishes. It's arrived today actually. I'm going to be attempting to cook my own C6. So I've got my chicken liber for the chili and stuff over. I'm going to try it myself. But let's try this one. Let's see if it's the same as the last time or if it's any different. I'll try it on some first. Right. So immediately. I think that this one is actually called. Yeah. I think it is for calamansi. It's like more of the orange flavor to. I do remember trying when I was in the Philippines. Over here, we can just be with black lime or lemon. That's got the orange flavor to. So I call that citrusy sort of burst of sinusoid kind of like it touched my palate. So the sweet and stuff like that. All right. These are famous lemon eggs. A famous lemon. Yeah. Why is it famous? It's not that spicy about what's in it. So under you like to tell what's in it. No. You're not. So it's a secret, the secret famous lemonade. Guys, we've brought over. Thanks for having me. All right. Let's try this. It looks like it's good stuff. That we got mint in it. So let's see. Just cucumber at the top first. So I just got like a bit of like jelly sort of like cucumber. Like that nice fill of water stuff. Really nice guys. It's super fresh in between everything together. They do. Which I need to do more of is we're so much of it to get to get into my system and get up a nutrient some goodness to benefit from. So let's see. I'm going to do this big massive mouthful. No, I'm safe. I'm so Jewish. You can probably hear about here. Anyway, so nice like. I'll get you sat on and get get just tucked into all of this. Or let you sort of enjoy with me and enjoy seeing all this beautiful sights of lovely cuisine from the Philippines. Put some looking forward to trying. Close and over there. I think this is probably exactly what it is like if you go to like a fancy restaurant over there. It certainly looks like it. I'm just so impressed. Get a little bit. Look at the size of that. That's like the like red sushi. Something isn't it? That's close. It is nicely chopped. Make sure it doesn't just fall here. Actually like it's a suit and some of it is falling. Oh, that's going to back down. Guys look at the seasick. Big spoonful all of that. Okay, so completely fallen off. You probably almost saved this actually. Look just falls some nicely off. There's another bone there. We didn't see it on one there too actually. So if we get in there, then we can just get those lovely sort of meadow. Oh, it's hard to do this holding one hand and stuff like. I'll set you back down. Nice look. Wow. Try a bit like this one. We're going to get a bit of this one. A little spoon. Try and get one of these out. But there's lots of nice lovely ones. A bit of this lovely one. Goodness. Try putting it everywhere. It's two-tounder, the lift up guys. It'll just fall. I'll have to take off that. That if you know what I mean. I've just kind of like evolved into using my hands here. It's just a bit easier. I know that's actually not really how you're meant to be, but for me. I was like that. I don't know like tourists or the person that's just easier to be honest. If you're not done with the table, it's easier. And then all the bit of you and stuff like that. Apart from this, we can just use that as a bit of a bunch. Sure. Okay, number of bit of this. Dependent of that sauce. I wonder what this is. What is up? I can feel like a sweet potato, maybe? I think. No, but the crispy stuff like that's a nice stuff. Not like that. It didn't get the vinegar out, it's good. I'm gonna thought. Dip it in her head. Just dissolves. It's like pure energy about two, just like straight up energy. Whatever it's without the ability stuff. That's not supposed to break. And I'll put it over the top of the sauce. No, right? That's just side trial. It's really not. Okay, I'm okay. Very good, very good. It's extremely getting completely filled up here. Like if you fed me well, it's so nice. I think for someone else coming, I thought the lunch was for something. So do you come here often? Yeah. We find like comfort food here. Comfort food, see this. That is comfort food for the lunch. About the remind you of just like the lovely like soup. You look at on a cold winter's day. Definitely. Yeah. Not that it's ever really cold in the Philippines, but it reminds me about the hot air, you know the moon. I'm pretty good. That's good to hear just your life. Beautiful. So are you just having with your daughter? Yeah. Yeah. So I think we'd be sitting here. Yeah. If we could come here one or two times. So I can see a lot. I can't see a lot. And it's a side from the weekend. It's really like. Together. I know when I'm in my own God's book, but yes, it's a very, it's a together thing. Isn't it like whenever you're old together. It's the night and everything on the, you know, everything like that. Yeah. Maybe I think I'm big. You get also seen this. It's more on the show. I will have hot the show, but the beautiful stuff behind the post, you know, from here. And I'm a big bucket. This is where my soon-nice stand-up or thing went. Beautiful place to come with your family outside. We love their food. Every occasion that we have, like, food, about a piece and Christmas gathering. Just a part of the world. Take all the part, take away. I'll put the gathering sign here. Yes. Like a lot of times you may be like wearing a short shoulder or something. Yes, like that one. And then, like anything that she said, like, objects or anything. Any occasions that we have. That we need to have. And I would like, just like before, probably like we, we just don't have that to be so. Order, like, a week and a week and a week. People in our house. From the show. Since we get those, the barbell. That's cool. So, yeah. Yeah. Oh, right on that. I am definitely wrong. Thank you. All right, guys, so. Got a cool, we dessert here. Oh, thank you. Well, you know, I just. I'll just shake it in my hand. Yeah, that's fine. Thanks, right. So, guys, we've got a beautiful, we dessert here. It looks like some sort of like crispy thing with like a lovely syrup over it, I think. Let's see what it's like. Could we be the mint on top? Seven in there. And we will just dig in. Let's see. Whoa. It's banana. It's like fried banana. It's also nice and soft. It's like the butter. It's so switching. It's just a lovely beautiful banana. The version side. I don't know if you can see much of it. It managed quite like a nice therapy stuff around it. Just a sort of thing, lovely and sweet. I've really powered all this lovely savory food. So, like basically just kind of shit with. Really nice crust. That's it. Lovely banana forever. Beautiful. I'm just trying to know with ice cream. Ice cream. Ice cream is okay. Yes, yes. You definitely need a spoon. Yeah, I can't use my hands for this one, guys. Okay. Okay. So, it's only ice cream, guys, so I can, I can handle ice cream at this point. Let's see. So beautiful with a nice mint. What's that like a wee-paste-stroping on the outside? That's a nice guy's look about. It's like a lovely like crispy thing. I'll try and like peel a wee bit off here. Then with a nice wee sauce and stuff. Oh yeah. Lovely crispiness. Okay. Just coup, you could easily like wrap up and just like take a bite of what we tried on. I don't know. Okay, maybe not. That was a bad idea. I definitely do need a spoon. I think it's because I said I needed a spoon. I was trying to put some wrong one. Just by doing it before I put a spoon, but nothing's right. Okay. I think it's up on my nose now, too. Okay. I can't believe I'm honest actually just do it by before now. That's it. Wow. It's not the conventional ice cream I was expecting. I think it's the syrup I'm actually tasting. Like that one. With mango. That's what it is. That's a mango flavor. That's nice guys. Well, as you can see, I've had to complete pound of other paste. I've had all this for about soup, about some rice, about these two beautiful desserts too. Luckily, the world's famous lemonade is about two. Guys, I'm completely stopped now. I might see them the way I would, but if not, thank you so much for watching. I'll see you in the next one. Bye, bye.
