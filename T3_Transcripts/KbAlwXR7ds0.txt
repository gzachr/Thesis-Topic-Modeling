I saw Mika Angel do it on her channel which I will show right here what her tail name is, she is really cool and funny. Move to the United States and she gave some Filipino snacks to her American friends and I thought it was just so funny. I just came back from the Philippines and got a few snacks that I really enjoyed in my childhood though. Yep I am just on my way to school now.

Okay, she's scared of trying the fish cracker once, and she's just going to try it out. It doesn't taste too strong, to be honest. Not big fish person, and a fish cracker is really, really out of feelings for me. There's only words to be read. Yes, there are fish. Okay, okay. Okay, come here. I'm trying fish. It can really have any fish. Yeah, it's not bad. Hm, you go f-. Why did you insult her? It's ultra-bad-ic. Yeah, you know what taste like fish sticks? That one doesn't taste like vegetable sticks. But it's not bad! See, you and Tiu, you're about to take another one. It's good, but I just like fish mentally. Oh yeah, I got it. The fact that fish is really thrown in. But it tastes exactly like fish. Is there anything else that it can say? No. This looks better. It's better if you have it like like this and then you just kind of dump it in. It's like dry soup. It's really good. Wait, it's a leprechaun. It looks just like you. Not bad. It's good. I want you to eat again. I think this was delicious. Did I rate this one? I think the bread pan I think you said was... I don't think I've rated this one. I think you said 9 out of 10. This looks fire. This looks brutal. Yeah. You like that? You could keep it. No, I don't want it. Hey, guys. Bring some tomorrow. Say it's so for me. Alright, alright, alright. What's going on? Bread. I don't know. You tried the green version of that. Oh yeah, I thought that was good. We had the purple things. They're so good. They're like green. The purple, the ube. 4 to 6 is a 60. I was like, I was like, the elevator. I was like, the elevator. I'm going to bring some more tomorrow. I'm going to bring some more tomorrow. I can't tell if it was like a minute or a half. Peach mango pie. It was a little warm. That's good, I guess. It is, but it sounds like. Alright, what's your rating? Not out of touch. Well, you tried it before. Yeah. But then you haven't. She gets a bit of a little pee to start. They're called labs to chips. Or are they skinny? That's a shrimp trip. Yeah, I'm thinking of shrimp. Wait, wait, wait, wait. She's trying the boy bottle. Go ahead. Do you like it? I like that other one, so. No, you'll be in part two. It's good. What do you rate it? Oh. What do you rate it? 13 out of 7. It's okay if you don't, it didn't really like it. In a half out of 10. In a half out of 10. Wait, no, wrong numbers. Not in a half out of 10. Thanks. It's so hot. Anyway, that was Americans or my American classmates trying Filipino snacks. If you guys like that, make sure to ask for a part two. I thought it was pretty nice. I was kind of shy in the beginning because I don't know. I always asked for people's consent to not only be filmed, but to be put on YouTube. Thankfully, everybody I asked to review the snacks were 100% down and gave me ratings and everything. Or Jordi really liked the food. So, I thought it was really, really good. So let me know if you want a part two guys. I still have some snacks from the Philippines that I could drink over. Thank you so much for watching. And thank you to all my friends who agreed to do this. See you guys in the next video.
