yes i'm making filipino chicken adobo today but 
more tasty than before yes more tasty than before  
i hope so so this time i'm gonna do my best to 
make the best possible chicken adobo from the  
philippines okay so i love this filipino food it's 
one of my favorites and what i also like about it  
is that it's so easy to prepare so i've made it 
a few times not many times but still i tried it  
a couple of times and this time i will try my best 
to make it a little bit tastier so i'm using the  
drumsticks as they call it chicken drumsticks 
i'm not sure what is your favorite part of the  
manok to use in the chicken adobo but i like to 
use drumsticks and today i'm using one and a half  
onions one is a white onion and half a red onion 
also i'm using a lots of baa one okay and this  
time i'm gonna like i said i will make it a little 
bit more special than normally now it's really
what do you think of the chicken so far they look 
really tasty right but they will get even tastier  
yes i hope they will get more tastier so okay 
the sibuyas go in now it's time to fry the bawang  
and the sibuyas together in the oil and today 
i'm using a cane vinegar from the philippines  
so that is one thing that i decided to make it a 
little bit more authentic and now it's time to put  
the chicken back and then i will add the vinegar 
or sugar so i'm just doing this on feeling i don't  
want to measure it too much just feeling long and 
then also with the soy sauce i'm using filipino  
soy sauce here and we'll add the soy sauce in so 
again i'm not using any measurement just like that  
what do you think about it let me know in the 
comments if you do the same okay brown sugar i  
decided to use a brown sugar today because 
i know that many filipinos they will use  
brown sugar or muscovado and so today i'm also 
using brown sugar instead of a regular sugar
is really something that i like in adobo what 
about you together with some extra salt and  
of course black pepper now i wanted to add the 
whole black peppercorns i know that that is also  
often used in this filipino dish but i didn't have 
it unfortunately however i do have labuyo siling  
labuyo and i will add one to make it a little bit 
anghang okay so now that everything is prepared  
in terms of the ingredients i will cover it and 
soft boil or gentle boil for 20 minutes lang
after 20 minutes i just turn them 
around flip them over one more time  
and then repeat the process with another 20 
minutes okay and this will make the chicken really  
soft and tender as you can see and the sauce is 
so amazing the smell in the house unbelievable i  
wish you could smell this dish so now i'll take 
it out and then i'll put the sauce back on top
no
this is really a nice dish from the philippines 
and there we go our filipino chicken adobo and  
hopefully it is more tasty than before let's find 
out so i hope you like this uh series guys more  
tasty than before this manok was really delicious
