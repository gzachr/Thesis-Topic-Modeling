 Welcome to another day in Paradise! Today is a beautiful day here on Chagau and what we're doing today, babe. We're going to plant a lot of plants on our land. Is someone here? No, it's just the dogs. What are you? The dogs are fighting. This was a really nice start of the vlog. Yes, for the last few months we have been growing a children in a few vlogs ago. We have a blue edible flower and we're going to have that as a fence. They have been growing a lot lately so it's time to plant them. We had workers at our land this week so they are done with the first part of the fence. Today we're going to put these ones. They're going to grow tall and nice and hopefully when we are back from our little trip they will have the blue flowers. That would be amazing. I don't know if it goes that fast but let's see. We're just going to take some orangui does and also the rambutan. We're going to plant them there as well. We think it's good to plant a lot of plants now when it's rainy season and then when it's dry season everything will explode hopefully. And we will have a really green, jangli vibe on our lot again. That's what we want to achieve at least and that's what we're going to go for. We're going to go there but first we actually got our friends, Mama Surf, where we were last week. They actually have a big one of those blue flowers and they don't want it anymore so we're going to get the whole plant. We're going to go there, we're going to uproot it and then we're going to go to the land. So I guess you will come along right? Yeah, let's do it. Nakon Fidu, you wanna come with us? You wanna come with us? Oh, you're such a cutie. Isn't he the cutest dog ever that exists in this world? Look at him. Fidu. He loves cuddles. He's a really, really, really, cuddly dog. Like if you don't pet him, he will come to you and beg for cuddles. Alright, so another thing before we go to Mama is I don't know if we have told everyone but next week we are going to... Halloween! We're going to Halloween for a little vacation. I think we're gonna be awake for around two weeks. And we have never been to Halloween before and I probably pronouncing it wrong. Do I? Because I've heard someone say Palawan and as foreigners we are saying like Palawan. However, we're super excited, haven't been there before so we would love your tips and recommendations like what to do. Like nice restaurants, nice places to stay. And your favorite tours that you can do like whatever you can think of. Please comment below. We wanna know everything about Palawan before we go. So yeah, but not Mama. Okay, we're bringing the shovel. We need to bring a bag to put the plant. Or to have somewhere to carry the plant, okay? Anything else? Bike? Yeah, we're gonna need a bike. The weather is a bit unpredictable today. It's raining and it's sunny and it's windy and it's cloudy. But yeah, it doesn't stop us from planting our little jungle. No, let's go there this. Where is our fan? With Soto. I don't think they're here. Okay, so here it is. It's this one and you can see this one actually have the flowers as well. There you go. So you can actually eat those ones. Like our plants haven't been producing the flowers yet. But yeah, the fence is gonna look like this but much bigger. So let's uproot it. Let's get digging. You think it will be hard? Yeah, yeah, with this one. Yeah, it's gonna be hard. Yeah, and from the beginning that plant was really big. They had like an entrance. Can you see like an a-frame entrance? Yeah, a little like a triangle. Yeah, like a triangle and they have those plants like climbing on the structure. So it was really, really big before. It's still pretty big. So I guess the roots are really might be big. There's actually a few that sprouting out from the ground here. Yeah, and actually a lot of flowers. I'm gonna super happy about that. Do you wanna have one? No. You can have one. If they are not eaten by any bugs. Actually really nice decorations. Like to smoothie balls and stuff. If you decorate the balls with those kind of flowers. And I guess that's our idea in the future, no? Yeah, that will definitely be on the menu somehow. On our menu, hey. Yeah, it fits good to see that. Okay, let's uproot this one and then go to our land and put it in the ground again. Okay, now we are so excited because we just uprooted a small part of it. And it's so big. I'm so happy because this is gonna be growing much faster than the one that we have been planting. We're trying to grow. So yeah, look at this. Oh my god. This one is huge. This is gonna be so pretty. He is so concentrated digging out the rest of the roots. I'm seriously no gardener. I have no idea what I'm doing. Don't hate us. We are trying our best here. Okay, this is gonna be so pretty. Okay, so we are back home from stealing the plant from Alma. And now we're trying to bring them back to land. This is not a how to video. Nothing that we ever do is a how to video. We are just guessing absolutely everything. I'm sure there's so many more better ways of doing what we're trying to do here. But yeah, let's see what survives. So we have all these plants. We have more in the surf racket. And now we are motorbike. Yeah, we just could like, I don't know if all the plants gonna survive, but let's see. Okay, see you there. How's it going, babe? Pretty good. We have implanting. One, two, three. It's one, two, three. That's a sad little one. And for the old look, very sad actually. Yeah, they look sad, but I think that's what they're doing, right? Because they get a little bit of a shock. Because you're moving them. We're watering them a lot. We have pretty good soil, so hopefully they will just recover. And it's gonna be like a big green fence. Oh, across here. Oh, across. And this big ground thing, let me back up here a bit. That's the entrance. Doesn't look much like a circus some reason, but yeah, somewhat of a circus. Okay, so our camera died when we were at the land planting our plants. So, but that's done. Now they're just gonna grow taller. And then we will have a beautiful green fence. So I have actually been to the hairdresser now. And I got some highlights. So now I'm blonde again. I was getting really, really dark. And I haven't been, don't say to anyone. I haven't been to the hairdresser for two years. And that's so embarrassing. But now I went and I'm blonde again. So I'm super, super happy. But now we're actually gonna, I'm gonna try out some dog treats. I bought some dog treats for the dogs. So we have banana peanut butter, salami, and smoked bacon. Let's see which one they like. The most. We're gonna do a test. You do? You wanna treat? Which one? Okay, let's open up. I don't know if they have different shapes. But this is salami. Where do I live in? And I think this is you guys. We have smoked bacon. Oh, they actually look different. That will make it easier. Smoked bacon. No weight. You don't have any patience. Come on. Come on. No. And we have banana peanut butter. Okay. Okay, sit. No, sit. I don't even know how I'm gonna do this with four dogs. Okay. Maybe I will put them on the ground. Wait, sit. Okay, let's see which one he shoots. No. No. Feed though. Peanut butter. Bacon. Salami. Feed you. Huh? Just one. No. Which one? Or this one? No. Feed you wanted to go with bacon. Okay, so let's try with Freya this time and see which one she wants. So we have Freya. Freya sit. Freya. Sit. Sit. We're gonna put no. One bacon. One peanut butter. And one salami. Freya. Which one? Which one? She also go for the bacon. Come on, guys. Jorjor. Huh? This one? What's that one? He goes for this salami. You want the peanut butter one? Yes. Everyone happy? Freya. Are you happy? So I don't actually know which one they like better. I think bacon was a favorite for all of them. Salami as well. Do you want one for you? Maybe you can show some tricks. Freya. What? Good girl. Hi, Freya. Hi, Freya. Good girl. Up. Good girl. Sit. Sit. Lay down. Freya lay down. So, salami. Also good? Let's see. If they actually smell like a salami. A little bit. Has the same shape. The bacon also has the same shape. Actually tastes like smoked bacon. To be honest, it actually tastes like smoked bacon. And then the peanut butter. No. Doesn't. Doesn't really taste. Now I said taste. I haven't tasted the smell. This smell. This one doesn't smell peanut butter and banana. To be honest. But anyway. Okay, so let's wrap it up. I'm probably going to go and meet up with Johan. And I'm starving. So, we're probably going to go and go for something to eat. I don't know where. There's actually a lot of places that have been opening up now in Shrigal. So, I think if you're picking up this Shrigal island, you can't. Like, there is a lot of hotels that are open. There's a lot of restaurants that are open already. So, there is a lot of good food. You still have the beautiful beach. And good weather. So, yeah, if you're thinking about visiting Shrigal, do it. It's up and running again. Of course, there is a lot of places that are not open. I don't know about the tourist places to be honest. Like, the rock pool and stuff. But you can probably find that somewhere on the internet. And, yeah, comment if you see us here in Shrigal. But now, I'm going to eat. And I'm not going to eat this. So, what do you have for us today? No, I'm filming me. It's okay. Not you. You're going to see me here. Okay? That's all right. So, what do you have for us today? Say again, how much is it? And... Octopus. Oh, octopus. All right. I think we'll have... You have any videos, huh? I don't know. All right. Can I have two octopits? Right? Yeah? And I have a... Pilsen. Pilsen. I'll be sitting here.

This is actually my... Takiyaki. Takiyaki. Yeah. Yeah. And now it's bananas. It's only like the fifth time or something I'm trying this. But it's so good. I don't know why I've never seen this before. This is really nice. Yeah, we've never seen that in Sweden. Do you want to make me the last? And you can order them with like different fillings.
