 Okay, so before I asked all Filipinos about this question and I think the answer is very clear. Yes, I think I get it now. So it must just be something from here in my specific compound or barangay. But I have a new question for all of you. Something else that I have never heard of before until moving here to the Philippines is that if you go to sleep with wet hair, you will go blind. I have never heard of this before. I am super curious. Is this something that all of you learned growing up? Let me know in the comments below and don't forget to share this with other Filipinos so that they can answer to you. Okay, that's all. Bye!
