And now we're gonna have some drinks and relax here. It doesn't matter that it's not sunny. We don't care. It's all good here. And they have to cover the whole with some cloth. This owner can provide them breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Oh wow. So this is like camping. Yeah, yeah. Right, right. It's a boom boom swimming at night. Right, so he just... he offers camping and a beach here. And he hangs stuff on those lines. And that's why we remember when we went to the caves. Just put lanterns on it. Yeah, very cool, very cool. And they put out this little red here for us. Oh, that was so graceful. This girl is afraid of nothing. Look at the size of this thing. It has horns. It does have horns. It's so big.

And I gotta tell you, I had a good time. This was amazing. Honestly, I was, okay. It started off a little slow. A couple hours. Just sitting and waiting. But then once we got going, we got going. Yeah. And then the whole time is such a fun experience. Yeah, and it didn't matter that it's raining. No, look at it. It's still raining now. But hey, you're going snorkeling anyways. You're getting wet. So it's fine. It's totally fine. I didn't realize that until after when we were like, when you told me, because I thought, okay, it was 10 meters. And listening to that doesn't sound as bad. Because that one thing was like, oh, yeah, it's like 40 feet. It's like, I'm glad I didn't know that beforehand. I'm just glad I didn't know that. Yeah, because I believe it's 4.3 feet to a meter. But maybe it's 3.4. Either way, it was really fun. All I know is that I'm 530. So I'm a little over a meter. I don't know how that works. I'm 160 centimeters. So I'm 1.6 meters. There you go. There you go. A lot of math. It's a lot of math right now. It's a present. Education channel as well. Yes, congratulations.
