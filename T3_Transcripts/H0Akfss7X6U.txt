It's another city here in the Philippines. We've got a catch of light. Not a long flight, but one hour, one and a half. Yes, another late. Nice flight for me. But yeah, let's go man. Pinch will continue. We're not a good star. We ended up on the wrong terminal. Okay boss, I want to go terminal 4. Terminal 4? Terminal 4s. So it looks up again, another taxi. So I go. We're early, so it's good. Terminal 4. Terminal 4, yes. Okay. I'll be the smallest apple. I've been to literally on that side, pick that side, and that's good to see all of it. It's got a crispy cream here, but it's closed now. I'll drop some. Maybe that's a good thing it's closed. Same on money. Apple price is always high. I don't get fat. I'm hungry. Come out with fresh air. I don't know if you know. It's only about 11 o'clock man, but like two hours left. It's a whole lot of flights out, but you've gone in the last couple of hours. They've all been late. They've all been off 11. As you can see, it's just come out now. All the rain stopped. Probably the flights keep moving man and mind doesn't get even more delayed. It's already long enough for the eight. Yeah. Hello, this is Poo. There was a much option in the Apple, because it's more than stickers. And the... Panther, the Royal as they call here. So yeah, it should keep me going. And yeah, let's get back in the... Hello. It's what time is boarding? The time your boarding is one. It's the minute time is one in the morning. One in the morning.

You know? I don't know. That sir? Sorry? I don't know that area. I have direction. No, but it's very difficult to find it this time. Because it's already midnight. It's already a slippy feeling. That's the entrance of the bridge. That's fine. You don't know. How's the taxi? Taxi? What do you do? Here, South Pole Central Hotel. Third pole? Yes. Flungoro in a seat. How much? 60 bin type.

So then you guys see this video of us D2Lay when you see it. But you gotta spare bed. You gotta double bed. You gotta single bed. These are size, look at this space man. So much space. Nice mirror here. Nice desk here. Two work maybe. Got TV. No signal but we live. Let's see the bathroom. Bathroom is small but I'm doing the job. Shower there, toilet. A lot of places here in not just Philippines, Indonesia as well. They have the shower and toilet in the same place. It's pretty cool. Same space. Yeah. That's the room. Look at that nice decor of the back as well. Solid house. Yeah man, decent lighting as well. Concord plane, what was this? Like $15. I literally booked it. Watched with other Apple in Manila. How crazy is that? Yeah man, not bad. Not bad Concord plane. Let's just test the bed now. Let's test the bed. Are you ready? Whoa! Oh shit! Oh shit! Oh shit! Ah, see that sign all these on planes. Oh god. I can't believe it back man. Oh no. Oh, I've lived here. That was a fail. Was for the bed. It's alright, not bad. I've had my head zoom. I've had better beds. Maybe I need to sleep man. But anyway, let me put the show you I got from 7-Eleven. Never got time to show you. I've got a nice, healthy evening snack. Evening is 2 a.m. Morning snack. Corp. Another chocolate bar.
