 So guys we've got some wishing candles here, which is right outside the church. I'm not sure exactly what happens when you buy them. Maybe you can ask these guys how does it work once we get these wishing candles. It seems like each colour actually has a meaning. Let's see how it works. Hello. Hi, how are you? Good. Can you help me with this one? Yes, please. Ah, yes, please. So I just wanted to know what is this candle like? This is for wishing candles. Okay. You can have something to wish. Yeah. Then you're wish. Okay. So we say our wish and then we burn it. This one is for the one who makes bad the two. Like to keep bad away from them. Yes, really? Like the bad eyes. Yes. Okay, so the black one guys is to keep away the bad people. I wish you bad.
