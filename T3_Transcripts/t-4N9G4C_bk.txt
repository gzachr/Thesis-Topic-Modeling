 Jolly B did it again. Jolly B, you're hitting us hard with these emotions. I hope not all of these things will be of some emotional and sad. Can't take it. It's just too much. Merry Christmas and welcome to... What's up Philippines? Guys, it has finally happened. It is the first of September and the Burmans have comments in the Philippines, which means... Christmas has begun. Exactly. And a few of you guys have sent us a lot of Christmas videos to react to. So, we thought we'd do a series of Filipino Christmas videos reacting to Filipino Christmas videos. And we're starting with... We are starting with gifts from the heart. Gift from the heart. Very nice. By the way, guys, if you do not know who we are, I am Mike. And I'm Nelly. We are two travel food and lifestyle vloggers based here in Macatacity, the Philippines. Our main channel is making it happen vlog and we're sitting right here. Okay, without further ado, I'm so, so, so, super excited about Christmas already. If you watched our Christmas series last year on our main channel, you might know why. If you haven't watched it, watch it. I mean, it's a really good series. Yeah. Playlist, link. Yeah. Again, it's good ready. Yes. All right. Most wonderful time of the year. Oh, reminds me of... Reminds me of our, uh, airport experience for Christmas. Oh. Oh. Oh. Not good enough. Oh, okay, I see. Oh, it's for people who are stranded on the airport. Mr. Flight, so... I don't know what happened. No, no, it's hit a surprise to people who walk from one specific flight that have to leave a Philippines. Oh, okay, okay. Oh, so cute. Oh, it's getting emotional. Oh. Oh. Oh. My glasses. Oh, why does this music make me emotional? Yeah. Oh, nice. Okay. Very cute. I know why this makes me emotional. Um. So last year we had a little Christmas miracle. It was the worst day of the year, but at the same time the best day of the year. Um, we had our Christmas presents ready. We haven't seen our family for a very, very long time. And we were super, super excited to fly to them and see them and hug them. And spend time together. And we headed out. Yeah, it was the 23rd of December. Our flight was on the 23rd, so we could arrive on the 24th. And when we left our part, we had like three hours of spare time to get to the airport. And we went downstairs, ordered a grab. And we couldn't get a grab. No grab would accept the ride. So then I tried to run to the road to hell a cab. And they just weren't any taxis anywhere. So we had to drive ourselves and like find a parking at the airport. But then there was like the traffic jam was the worst traffic I'd seen. Yeah, it was really really bad. And we were actually arrived at the airport 10 minutes after checking closed. But luckily, a Filipino policeman, helped us. Took Nelly on the back of his scooter. Because I was still stuck in traffic, but he transported Nelly to the terminal. It was unbelievable. It was unbelievable. I had to go to the toilet actually. That's why I was rushing out of the car. So at the same time, we also tried to check in with our flights because we couldn't do anything by a phone or online. And eventually this guy said, oh, hop on to my bike. I will just drive you. And here is me sitting on the back of his scooter. And I was so overwhelmed with everything that I forgot to film it. I just took a picture as a quick selfie and made it in time. Made it in time. They opened the check and for us. The Turkish Airlines was so kind to still let us check in. And we actually made it out to the plane with just like seconds to speed. Door closed, airplane to go. Yeah, so it was a little Christmas miracle that we made it home for Christmas. That's why I'm a little bit emotional. I miss my family right now. So what is the next video? Okay. It's a jollybee video. Okay. We know those are weird things. Oh my god. Why is this? Wait a second. They got it. They got it. They got it. They got it. They got it. They got it. They got it. They got it. Wow. Wow. I'm going to go. Go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. That's me when I was a child. I was crying with my dad. He left for work. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. Daddy. Daddy. Daddy. Daddy. Daddy. Daddy. Daddy. Daddy. Daddy. Daddy, where are you going? Daddy. Daddy, your gift. Daddy, your gift is the only gift. But we have a lot of things to do. Daddy, we'll go to the library. Daddy. Daddy, we'll go to the library. Daddy. Daddy. Daddy. Daddy. It's not my gift. But a problem is the batter. Daddy, let me get it. I'm not going to get married. You're not going to get married? Promise? I'm not going to get married. I'm going to get married if I'm going to get married together. You're the best. You're the best. You're the best. Forever. I love you. So cute. Jolly B did it again. It always happens. Oh my god. Jolly B, you're hitting us hard with these emotions. I'm sorry. It was an emotional one for me as well because my dad is a truck driver. So every time he came back home, it was mainly for the weekend or once per month or twice per month. And every time he left, I was crying. I can feel her. I'm like this little girl. I hope all these pictures were so emotional and sad. I hope so too because I can't take it. It's just too much. It's too much. I don't want to look like this all the time. Last year we got to spend an amazing Christmas here in the Philippines. Hence the playlist. We had so many fantastic emotional, happy, touching moments. Joyful. It was the best Christmas ever. Starting from the Christmas lights at the Aalab Triangle to the Maralco lights. That's the Christmas village. The amazing Putu Bumbong and Bebink are so many great memories. Alright guys, if you enjoyed this vlog, sorry.
