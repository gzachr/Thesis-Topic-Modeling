 What's your name? Lenny. Where are you from? Greece. For how long you've been in Philippines? I've been here 10 days already. How would you rate your staying in the Philippines in these 10 days from 1 to 10? I think it's very nice. I just have a problem with the food. Some Filipino food or? I haven't been poisoned, of course, but I'm a bit difficult with new flavors. It's a bit difficult for me to try. I'm eating more like McDonald's and games. I think they have a variety of food. Or maybe when you go to a restaurant, you can try Karekade. I don't know if you had a bite. It's nice, but it wasn't really close to my flavors. But it's fine. I have a great time. So from 1 to 10? 8 is fine. The other two is probably because of the food. So enjoy your staying in the Philippines and good luck on the game. Nice meeting you.
