 Oh hey there guys! Hey! What's the packet? We are going to seek out the mystical creatures of Bohol Island, the Tarshares. These little creatures look cute as hell, so we are going to go to the Philippines, Tarshares Sanctuary and the Tarshares Conservation Area. You know you are in the right place, when there is a sign for it. That is a pretty good indication, right? That's what I was saying, that's what you are looking for. Guys, if you want to go somewhere, follow the signs. They will tell you where to go. Alright guys, we are here, it just started raining. So let's find some cover and wait for this friendly, sweet little rain cloud to pass by. I am so friendly, I love it. I love it. Let's go! That is terrible man. Alright guys, the rain has stopped. Tarshares time. It's Tarshares here, territory. It's a really careful man, they look really cute, but they will bite your head off. They get the opportunity. It's like a gang of Tarshares come over there. We do it in here, it's not there, it's over in it. It is. It is your territory, Tarshares here. How much is it? 160 per person. Okay, how does it work? We can just go straight in now? Yeah, it's okay, we can go straight in. I feel like Kelly hugged the Tarshares. No. Can we take one hug? No. Take a sin hand. Let's go Tarshares hunt. Is that your name? Kathy. Okay, nice to meet you, Kathy. Hi. Kathy is the Tarshares expert, so we are in good hands. We are actually in the Tarshares habitat now. Hi guys, those animals are so damn cute. I've never seen something like you. I like this. You put them in your pocket. Take a sin hand. How many Tarshares do we have here? A total in the whole sanctuary, it's more than 100 Tarshares estimated. But I just live in a wild. This is only for a viewing or a tourist who wants to see the Tarshares. And the ones that live here, they never leave. They leave during night time. Because night time, they will hunt their food. But in the day, she came back. Do you feed them here? No. It's a natural. It's not like a zoo, it's not like a cage. It's just like you're really in the jungle. So all these little Tarshares are literally just living. You're natural habitat. This was a really, really poor experience. Better than I expected. Yeah. Ten thumbs better. High times better than I expected. Very much worth it. Highly recommend. And this guy is where we come for the Tarshares physical activity. Here we can see all the Tarshares running around eating. Is this not a special Tarshares? No. All right, well, we might have been wrong about that. But it's still super cute. And I would love to take one of these times as well. And then eat it. Because we love chicken. I love fried chickens. And now we're off to first we're going to get some food, right dude? Off to seeing all those cute little Tarsias. Makes you hungry. Makes you really hungry. So you Tarsias sandwich. Tarsias. So now we're going to eat a Tarshares here. Burger. Hey. Don't leave it out, man. Don't leave it out, man. Don't leave it out, man. Oh, guys, I guess I'm going to have to start living with the Tarshares. I could be a good Tarshares, right? No, a ProSki is mine. It's going to be a Tarshares here. Get on. I don't want to be a Tarshares. I want to be a ProSki. So let's get going and find some food. Because food is what I need. Because I am hungry. So let's do it, guys. And then after that, we go to the Tarshares Conservation Area. Rock and roll. I've got a Tarshares here on the Scooter. Woo-hoo-hoo! That way. Off to the food place. Where we're going to do the eating. So hungry. I'm really excited, guys, because I do not know where we're going to be eating. But I'm sure we're going to run into something really, really delicious. I can authentically little Filipino Karenari on the side of the road, bro. Yeah. The beauty of our traveling around to the Philippines. You don't know what you're going to run into. But you know, you're going to run into something awesome. We're driving here on the side of the road. Look at that. Look to the side. What are you doing? Look at it. A whole fashion farming, baby. Beautiful. The guys just plowing through the land with this trusty cow. That hard work results in the rice that we feed ourselves with. We've got to appreciate that. Thank you to that off. All right, guys. The sun is breaking through for the two broskies. The weather is clearing up, and we're just taking a tiny little pit stop so that we can appreciate these amazing rice patties that we're seeing right here on our way to the Tarsir Conservation Area. Look at this. Wow, guys. That was an amazing view. It still is. It still is, and it was, and it always will be. We've decided to type a little pit stop. Exactly. Have a nice little snack here. Refuel. All right, guys. We have decided to order the pork sissick. You guys have told us for a very long time to try pork sissick. So here at this lovely little restaurant in the middle of the Buhol, among the rice fields, we're going to try pork sissick, which does that, guys. Have no idea what it's going to be, but it's probably going to be pretty good. I'm really curious what's happening in the kitchen. So let's see if we can go check it out. Hello. We can see the kitchen. Oh, yes. Should we see? Oh, nice. This is beautiful. This is where the magic happens. Making beautiful food. Yes. Yeah. Oh, it smells so good. Thank you. Oh, my God. OK. Let's leave the kitchen. Let's go to the table. Oh, yeah. OK, guys. I'm excited. Thank you. That looks insane. The first ever pork sissick for the broskies. We picked the right place to get it for the first bite. Wow. Sissley. And I'm just going to make some soup. Salam, Pa. Thank you. Ooh, we... Mmm. I want to eat this right now. I think we've got to do this properly. So first, we've got to put the calamans all over it. Oh, there we go. It's all over it. Put the silli in there. Bam. Amen. Try it out, Grisky. Try it out. Oh, man. Yeah. Awesome. Lame on pork sissick. This first pork sissick is making me drool. Because it smells so good. I'm going to eat it with a little bit of rice. Because that's how they eat stuff in the Philippines. We started off with a little bite of the chili. And then we followed up with this. And it's spicy. That is so good. That is like savory and porky and sizzly. Amazing. It's delicious. I should thank you for that. Lame it. You never know where you're going to find the place that does the best dish. But sometimes, you just be on the side of the road in Bohol. That was delicious. I'm all refilled up. Hi. Thank you. And away we go. People with a Tasiak Conservation Center. Guys, we are slowly making our way all the way up into the mountains. A little scooty here is doing a lot of work. A little scooty is doing a great job. I'm very proud of it. We are in the manmade forest. This place looks like a real forest. And it's a really good job. We're coming for you Tarsiers. You can run but you can't hide. We have arrived. This looks like the place. This looks like the place. I think I found why people like coming here. The creepiest Tarsier in the world. That is nightmare fuel. You would not want that big chase of your night. Run into that in a dark alley. Exactly. I wouldn't be friends. Good. I don't know how to do that. I wonder if they know how cute they are. They do, man. They use it to their advantage. I'm sure three drinks in a couple of hours. Yeah, guys, that was a very big Tarsier day in Bohol. We did the Philippine Tarsier Sanctuary and the Tarsier Conservation Area. Both of them were really good. Amazing. The first one is much smaller scale. I think it's less touristy. There's no bars or anything like that. You can just walk in between the trees and the natural habitat of the Tarsier. This one, the Tarsier Conservation Area is definitely way more developed. Way more touristy. Honestly, both of them are probably worth it. Check it out if you want. And we had Port Cicic. They didn't have that on the menu. They didn't have Tarsier Cicic. Unfortunately, I'm just Port Cicic. We hope you enjoyed this video. If you did, don't forget to like it, share it, subscribe, and hit that bell, people. And then we shall see you in the next episode. Peace.
