here it is the almighty the all-world 
loving inspiration of the philippines
hey you want to talk to the camera 
real quick oh come on say something  
just say something real quick just please
okay they were too shy they didn't want to talk 
okay baby we're back i'm back in the philippines  
my home away from home the philippines so 
this is my third time coming to this country  
and um honestly i don't know what to say but this 
is my first impressions video even though this  
isn't my first impression of manila i'm gonna be 
honest but it has been a while it has been a while  
since i've been here so right now i'm in the uh 
the makati area which is kind of like the business  
district of the philippines or of of manila and 
um i'm going to walk around i want to go want to  
go check it out maybe go with some street food 
do kind of like a first impressions video maybe  
go check out bgc i know all the youtubers going 
to bgc and you know talking like whoa it's crazy  
which it is honestly i went there and it is crazy 
and since the last time i was here three years ago  
i think that it's much bigger than it was before 
and honestly it's really really really nice so  
here we go manila let's do this baby okay well 
first of all let me say this country is extremely  
catholic so i'm just walking down the street 
right now i see a church there's jesus right  
there and i keep walking and then i see this 
monster tree in the sidewalk look at this thing
this thing is a monstrosity this looks like 
we're in the forest right now and this one  
right here too look at that thing this is one of 
the reasons so that's the first thing i'm loving  
here that's the first thing i don't think i 
saw trees like that when i was in indonesia  
so first let me say july and august is 
the rainy season here in the philippines  
so in the afternoons it just gets dumped just 
dumps these gnarly storms that just come and just  
dump a bunch of water so it is humid it's warm 
i'm sweating my chest off or people say my titties  
so like i said before i'm in the makati area 
which is kind of like i guess like the business  
district kind of place even though i think bgc 
is too but you got like these big buildings here  
and there's a lot of huge buildings here 
and actually um i need to find more like  
a local neighborhood to walk through 
that's where i need to go right now  
so for anybody who watches my videos i will 
say you know i love malls i stepped in here  
real quick it was hot i was sweating my chest 
off decided to come in here use the restroom  
real quick but i will say this nila is the land 
of the malls i thought jakarta had a lot of malls  
you have no idea i might go on a mall spree here 
honestly i might do like five malls because the  
malls here are crazy and they're everywhere 
and actually i think they have the largest mall  
in southeast asia sm asia mall or something 
like that something crazy you know so  
coincidentally i'm over by where i stayed at 
the last time i was here which is actually  
it was one of these buildings right behind me 
and since i've been here they built this place up  
a lot a lot and honestly i don't really know what 
to say about it because i mean it's nicer for sure  
i mean they did a really good job i mean it's 
like it's really growing here for sure there's  
a lot of development but you still also get that 
local flare okay well i have to say this this  
this one's pretty obvious so it's saturday traffic 
is just bumping right now i see it down there
goes all the way back  
it's saturday it's like i think it's like one 
o'clock or something like that two o'clock  
and uh it's just it's just bumping right now 
just so much traffic there's so many people  
jollibee jollibee jollibee 
jellybean jollibee that's like  
the jollibee is the philippines mcdonald's they 
have peop they have them from around the world  
there's jelly beans from around the world where 
i was living in america they had jollibees and  
two three different states that i've been in they 
had jollibees there and i'm sure there's more too
actually you know i'm gonna go in there and 
see if i can see the world map and see where  
all the jollibees are look here you go right here 
eleven hundred jolly bees worldwide over a million  
pieces of chicken and let me say this this is 
the craziest thing and a lot of people that are  
probably not even gonna know what i'm talking 
about with this and this location they got a  
jolly bean brunei for those of you that don't know 
brunei it's a tiny it's a tiny nation on borneo  
and it's actually there's three countries on that 
island there's malaysia indonesian and this little  
country brunei which is like an oil country oh 
they got them in saudi arabia dubai all over
bottles of water
all right i had to buy a water here at 
mcdonald's which is right next to the jawline
i think it was 30 pesos which is like uh 65 
cents but it's not a big bottle of water but  
still because i think i paid a dollar one 
time at one of the other ones so this was  
a pretty good deal yo first of all like i said 
earlier this is a ton of construction going on  
here there's so many high-rises being built and 
i'm here in makati and i think this is like the  
business like super district they got another 
building coming up there's another one going up  
i don't know if this i think this one's brand 
new too they're building this one right here
construction construction everywhere here so 
i'm kind of in a fancy part now i'm just walking  
around i've left where i'm staying i've been 
walking for like two kilometers three kilometers  
and this place looks kind of fancy 
look there's another building
building another one and there's just like 
a bunch of nice restaurants around here
but i need to find the local neighborhood 
i gotta go find a local neighborhood
okay so just hopped over and i came over to bgc 
i didn't know where else to go so here we are  
the infamous actually not the infamous the famous 
bgc philippines and manila which this place is on  
it's very it's honestly very beautiful and it's 
nice to see city like this in the philippines  
okay so let's see oh look my mom used to have 
that car z4 we could never drive it because we  
couldn't drive a stick shift so she couldn't 
we couldn't uh take it out on the street  
so this place is insane because man it's 
like it's it's a super modern city it's  
like it's like any kind of modern city 
you would go to that i've been to at least
you know it's just clean
it's awesome so i mean check it out look 
you can see it goes all the way down  
there to the end got these massive buildings
jp morgan chase you know that's the big 
business and it goes around right here  
and this is the uptown mall i've been to this 
mall before and this mall is sweet this mall  
is super cool so i don't really know what else to 
talk about so what i'm going to try to do is talk  
to some local filipino people that are walking 
around and see see how they feel about bgc because  
i mean this is completely different than 
other parts i mean even in makati where  
it's a business district they it's it's still 
kind of mixed even though it's really nice  
you know so let me see if we can find some 
people excuse me gentlemen excuse me can i

i know that's what i want to ask yeah 
okay okay okay okay so third time's a  
charm i ran into camille and casey they're 
right here here let me give you guys a frame  
okay so i want to ask you guys so what where what 
part of manila are you from uh actually i am from  
i'm sorry yeah we're part of the philippines 
um laguna oh laguna how far is that from here  
two hours or two hours so and then you 
oh laguna too so are you guys here for  
vacation or just traveling after him 
parking here are you working here no  
it's our best day for us oh it's rest day oh 
yeah saturday huh okay okay so what like i  
mean because bgc is crazy right it's so nice so 
what what like how do you feel about bgc versus  
the rest of the philippines or like the 
province or like do you like do you like it do  
you think like you would like to see more of the 
philippines like this or do you like how it's like  
you know maybe like more traditional philippines 
do you like that more me um well you're supposed  
to be in here too but she walked out 
yeah she actually she's not working here
it's her birthday today oh happy birthday happy 
birthday yeah happy birthday how old are you  
twenty
yeah it's crazy right uh it's like that we have we 
go in a different place yeah yeah like different  
countries yeah so do you like this back do you 
like back home more or do you like it here better  
um actually i like back home but 
for some time we want to have some  
time together in a different way like yeah yeah 
okay so let me ask you this just simple yes or no  
would you like to see more of 
the philippines like this or no  
do you think it's maybe too much it's 
too modern or do you would or do you like
you want both right yeah you need both you 
actually need both yeah okay okay all right  
that's it hopefully this works because the mask 
i didn't even think about it the whole time  
we're wearing the mask okay so i got the next 
group of people i got casey and michael and their  
local filipinos they're from makati 
which is like right next to bgc  
and um so i'm gonna ask you guys first so what 
do you think about vgc like do you like how  
developed it is and how nice like what do you 
think about it just over overall yeah they like  
bjc because it was so centralized and it is 
um catering all the levels of market uh-huh
so you mean like it's got like business and it's 
got like um like shopping it's got like the local  
like residential you can find everything here 
yeah yeah everything so what do you guys like  
it do you like how it's kind of like a modern 
more of like a modern city like kind of i guess  
because like they don't allow like tricycles and 
stuff in here right yes like do you like that do  
you like that do you think it's good or do you 
think that's bad because that's like traditional  
filipino you know actually it's kind of good 
because it's the public vehicles are kind of  
create more traffic but in more sense of 
businesses um more likely that people has  
the private vehicles which kinda accessible for 
bjp yeah yeah so you think it's better for traffic  
and stuff like that yeah yeah what do you think 
about it michael say for me it's better to uh  
don't have any tricycle or public uh two kinds of 
vehicles here because they protect the environment  
as well as you can see there's a lot of trees and 
more um more transportations like that causes more  
yeah yeah so so then would you guys like to see 
more of like the philippines be like bgc in the  
future or more kind of like i don't know like i 
don't even know what you compared to maybe like  
province life or do you like the mod like 
the modern city building you guys like that  
actually the modern city was so ideal but uh 
we can see that philippines needed to be more  
modernized but the transportation and such is also 
convenient for us like double dignica japanese  
tricycles are of the best for the philippines 
because like the pears are not too high yeah yeah  
yeah yeah because crabs kind of expensive yeah 
yeah i know i took it over here i was like damn  
that's what i was like okay so i think that's 
i think that's all i got okay and then hold on  
actually let me ask one more thing so what do 
you guys want to see to your fellow filipinos  
you want to say anything to them or no even though 
there's not going to be many people watching this
i don't know just hi and be happy okay hi 
and be happy okay thank you guys all right  
okay what was interesting because um they were 
they were all about it they thought it was better  
to have more of a modern city and not allow um 
some of the other types of transportation and  
stuff into bgc which i was kind of surprised 
by but um i think it's about to rain right now
and man when it dumps when it rains 
here it dumps i mean it like it's  
it's tropical rainstorms okay so i can't 
i can't end the video here this can't be  
my first and final first impressions video so 
this is gonna be the first impressions video  
part one this is gonna be part one of the first 
impressions video because i still have to go to  
like the local neighborhoods you know and go 
really go chop it up with the filipinos here  
um but first of all i gotta say it is beautiful i 
mean everybody knows it already i mean it's nice  
bgc has grown a lot since the last time i was here 
and it was it's a it's a really really nice place  
um so anyways i'm gonna be here in the 
philippines for a while i'm gonna be  
pumping out a bunch of videos here so uh let me 
know i think before i was in indonesia before  
i don't think i have too many filipino followers 
so hopefully i get some more and if you are from  
the philippines and you follow me thank you 
for the support and share your video share my  
videos with your friends and family so as always 
thanks for watching and we'll see you next time
you
