So yeah, if you want to check music reactions, it's all going to be posted only in that channel, not on this channel
So let's go ahead and react to this video
Alright
Loving the music
Very fancy
Very fancy, very fancy
Classical
Okay
Okay
Okay
I haven't seen this
Not here, but Dominicans they do that, palomuelto
Ah yeah, but like
That's what they sing, this is suffering to the spirits
Okay, yeah, but like that's like very in the province that people do this
Dominicans don't do it like this, but they do it like this, right in front of you, like you just put a chorrito, palomuelto
This is not done anymore, I haven't seen any like
No, this is not done anymore, but
They all main in the colmad√≥n, maybe the ones that are playing dominoes
Maybe really rural
Rural
In the province
Devil free
So if you don't do this, the devil is going to come
And ruin the drinking session, the inner one for everyone
Okay
I'm sorry, but this is his special expression
He starts pouring and he's very serious, right?
He's pouring and he's very like
The participants are not given
The glass has ice and now it doesn't have ice
It doesn't have ice, it's true
It means a show of trust, camaraderie, and in these days a united willingness to enter in a covid russian roulette
As drinkers to serve as a common glass passed in a round-robin sequence
Okay, this now is making sense from when we went to San Boanga
That's true
We actually
This is so embarrassing, now that I see this
We disrupted the natural order
Because when they passed us the drink, I stayed with the cup
No, when they passed me the drink, they passed me a cup, right?
I just drank everything and I gave them the cup empty
Yeah, but when he passed it to me, I stayed with the cup
He gave me a cup of this liquor and the other cup had Coca-Cola coke
And I said, no, I don't want Coca-Cola
And I stayed with the cup like this is my drink
Yeah, because if you're offering me the drink
I understood that he wanted the cup back for some reason
But I thought that he was going to pour more and pass it to everybody, you know?
So I just drank everything and then they offered me the Coca-Cola after I had the drink
So I'm like, oh no, I don't want Coca-Cola
I don't want Coca-Cola
I didn't understand and I stayed with the cup and he had to go look for another cup
This is embarrassing
I disrupted the natural order
It is frowned upon to take a pass
But when a drinker is excessively intoxicated
A substitute from within the group
Must consume the shot in the drinker's place without affecting his or her own turn
You see, he drank everything
So maybe I'm not that wrong
Yeah, embarrassing
It is customary, post-consumption, to return the shot glass to the center of the table
Or hand it directly to the tanguero to be refilled for the next drinker
Okay, yes, so they refill
Okay, so you did well
The ruin was me
I never returned that cup
And he had to go look for another
So sorry
We are the foreigners, if you don't explain these rules to us
I wish he had told me, no, this is how we do it
But he didn't
Maybe he didn't want to make a loose face
I would prefer to learn
I don't care about losing face, guys
I'm shameless
So I prefer to be corrected and to learn how to do the things properly
According to the culture and the traditions
Instead of, you know, not knowing anything until I see a video on YouTube
I get embarrassed
Every drinking session varies
However, it is important to familiarize oneself with these characters
The drunk master, allegedly gifted with immunity from inebriation
Usually left with the task of cleaning up after all is said and done
The walking dead
This creature's will to stay conscious
This consuming overwhelming amount of alcohol is commendable
And allows it to continuously engage with the group
Albeit from a half-dead state
That's me
That's me
I'm the walking dead
The bad thing is that I am so lively
That people think I am not drunk out of my mind
And the next day I don't remember no shit
I don't remember what I said, who I talked to
I don't remember what I did
I don't remember anything because immediately I got drunk
It's like everything is a blur
But I continue to be engaging with people and talking and sharing
Enjoying and continue drinking
So people never know when I have had enough
So they continue to offer me drinks
I'm the walking dead
I think I'm not a walking dead
I think I could be the drinking master
Because I always drink water in between my drinks
And try to stay sober as possible
Because I actually like to remember
I believe Sol is the one who falls asleep
So I don't know what is she talking about
Is there one that falls asleep?
They haven't said anything
I don't know, but there's probably going to be
Wow
Okay, that could be me too
That's you, that's you
My friend
My friend, I don't fall asleep
Early in the session
I fall asleep if I am really really drunk
But as you have hung out with me lately
And you know that I am not falling asleep, right?
I don't know because I am the walking dead
So I don't remember anything that happens
My friend, I keep myself hydrated
So I can go all night
And excuse me
Honestly, I was before in the past
I was the sleepy beauty, not anymore
Oh, those cookies, crackers
What is this?
The sausage
The meat that you don't like
Is that kawari?
It's pica de rata
It's easy
Well thank you for telling me
Because
I've seen people eating the pulutang with rice
Oh my god, so that's the reason why there was no rice
That day that we went to a bar
And they ordered, they ordered sisig
And I was like, walaang rice?
And they were all laughing at me
First of all, because they were like
Oh, she's Filipina now
Cannot eat anything without rice
But for me, like the sisig goes very well with rice
So this is why when we went to this bar
That they mistreated us
Which bar?
The bar that is around this area
That we asked like, is the sisig comes with rice?
And they didn't understand
And they didn't bring any rice
And we had to order extra rice
Since it's a bar and it's not a restaurant
They are not going to serve it with rice
Because it's not a meal
However, we went there to have dinner
Yeah, we were hungry a year
Because there was nothing else open
So we were like, they maybe have pulutang
So let's go there
Oh my god, now everything is making sense
We are realizing so many mistakes
That we have done in this country
Oh my god
The grease or fat is unavailable
Expensive nuts and chips
Ah, these are nuts, okay
Including some born out of creative ingenuity
What?
Tuna and canto
Ah, this is tuna
Okay
I don't think so
I've never seen this in a French restaurant
I don't think so
I don't think so
I don't think so
I don't think so
Is it good?
And he had to say all this putangina
It's not bad words
All this putangina
Just to say that it was delicious
Sarap
Sarap
Sarap to
Sarap to
Kanpai
Kanpai
In Japanese, it's the Filipino way of saying cheese
Oh really?
The clinking of glasses and the party
Well, I have never seen any Filipinos saying kanpai
Everyone always says cheers
Cheers
And we say salud
We say salud
Yeah
And they understand when we say salud
Yeah
A shared beverage containing every participant's DNA
Is meant to honor old friendships
Celebrate new ones
And in certain situations
Possibly avert oneself from being violated
With a sharp piece of metal designed to break up ice
Don't make rice with our pulutang
Go home
Am I understanding Tagalog?
Didn't he sing that there's no rice in this pulutang?
Yes
In our pulutang
Yes
So since this is kind of like a tutorial
Oh my god
I'm understanding Tagalog
Okay, this is
Careful
You can see something
You can see
That does smell
The strong smell
Young man
This
Wait a minute
They're supposed to be
According to the video
One cup that has the alcohol shot, right?
And there's another cup for the Coca-Cola
Which is what Filipinos call the chaser
I learned that by drinking with you guys
The chaser is supposed to go after
I think he didn't mention that in the video
Yeah
He did
I don't remember
But the chaser is supposed to go after you drink the shot
Oh no
So this is why
In Zambuanga when they were giving me the alcohol first
And I drank it all
They were like, now the Coca-Cola
And I'm like, but why you didn't mix everything?
Because like
The logic is that you mix the Coca-Cola
Not the logic, just the way we drink
The way we drink it
Is that you mix the Coca-Cola and the alcohol together
And that's it
Yeah
With you
Tagay, hangan, mamatar
Hangan, tagay, mamatar
Tagay, hangan, hasta, mamatar
You did
I thought it was the opposite
It was hangan, tagay, mamatar
The chaser, the chaser
Cheers
Cheers
Oh my God, you drank all that
No, that's too much
I had a little drink
I cannot drink this pure
Absolutely
Actually, it's not as strong as I thought it was going to be
Okay
Well, she's really the drinking master
Wow
Wow, stop, Tangina, stop
Tangina, stop
Tangina, stop
Tangina
