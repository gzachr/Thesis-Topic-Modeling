 Then Adam after that during the night Adam was really young. So my embuntag must have my friends, we can't hear what harvesting up heats. An experiment if we can grow them seems we can. So we planted this peanut pretty much four months ago to the day even. We planted this peanut about four months ago in the spare. It was a bit of an experiment at the time. And well we're going to try and harvest it today and see what's what. The sweet potatoes here. Oh really? Oh my goodness, have a look. We've got some peanut. Do you pull it? Yeah just pull it out and shake it. It's not mad but maybe it's more time. More time? I'm not sure. I think four months is about life, you know. Obviously these stalks if you look at them they haven't got too big, they haven't got too healthy. They'd be okay but this started from just one peanut didn't they? Each one of these is just one peanut. Yeah. I think we harvest it. Straight to them. They're going to plant something here. Yeah we've got plants for this bed. It's a good position, it's got a lot of sun, a lot of rain. And you've got this back wall here which is just empty. So we can use the end of the bed for climbing plants. Probably going to be some like cucumber. Or who knows what. They take up quite a lot of ground, you don't get too much out of it but it's fun to do. It takes about four months from start to finish. These peanuts we've got doesn't look a lot but we don't plant many to start with. Just a few. There's quite a few small ones on here still. We've got a lot of them to grow if we left them in the ground. So this experiment seems to have worked. Can you grow peanuts easily in the Philippines? Absolutely you can. It should take about four months but it looks like these are ready mostly in three months. Here we have a dog that thinks it's a cat. It's been copying me. I'm pretty much doing a part on the wall. You're not a cat. Stupid dog is what he is. I think he's a cat. He's been watching the cat. He's been copying me. He's been doing it. This dog really doesn't know what he is. One minute he's eating the grass at the goats. Next minute he's walking along the wall like a cat. Ah creamy boy. What we're going to do with you. What are we going to do with you? I'm going to get down, eh? Are you going to get down? You know cats land on their feet? I'm not sure of dogs too. What do you think of him cookie? Which one brother up to? So when you know they're ready these long beans? When they are just enough size really, just like the one you pick up. That one is over a little bit. That's a bit matured but it's still OK. But that's if it's dry then you can plant it that type of one. That's quite thick that one isn't it? You look at this one for example. That one is ready. There's a different, definitely different size. It's supposed to get bigger and bigger is it? The older it gets. And a bit more dry and it loses its goodness really. Still tastes OK I'm sure but not as good as the thinner ones. That one is ready for planting. So this one here is what happens if you don't pick them. They go like this. But that's good. If you want to grow more you can just take the seeds out and plant them. And they go really quickly from the seeds. Lots of ants on these. Are you alright for now? Yeah. I have so far to the peanuts, baguettes, long beans. Hopefully soon, hopefully soon. Some of these. But many, many pods up here as well. It's not. And so it's just gone in which is nice. So it looks a bit better, bit brighter. Still needs to do these realions again as I said in the last vlog. Jobs to do. Lots of jobs to do. The house has been painted on this side at the moment. There he is. Cream your not a cat. Please understand you're not a goat. Don't need to eat the grass. You're not a cat. You don't need to climb the walls. You're a dog. Okay? Just a dumb dog. Just a dumb dog aren't you? Creamy boy. Oh, the creamy. You're a good boy. You're a good boy. Just don't climb the wall. Okay? It's dangerous for you. Oh, it's dangerous. Ah! Ah! Someone's got power breath. Cookie boy. Good boys. Good boys. Okay. Hi. Hi. I'm going to get some fire leaves. So this is what I'm going to make. So that I'm going to mix some papaya leaves juice. So papaya juice made of leaves. Yeah, papaya. It's quite noisy today. We still have working going on. Still have people who are doing some work. We did gardening the other day and it was really, really sunny, really hot. Adam, after that during the night Adam was really ill. He's like a hub high-pain fairy chore. Dama fein and just fein and a fein. He might have a dinghy. So I decided to mix some papaya leaves juice. I'm going to pick up some leaves. Obviously it's getting worse. Then we had to take him to the doctor. At the moment he said he just wanted to have a rest. And just keep giving him lots of fluids. Okay. So we get the papaya leaves there. So we make the juice. We're Adam. We really suspected that he had a dinghy. And the same tom's that he has having now is exactly the same. So we're worrying. Hopefully it is just a mild one. Because obviously it's dangerous. I'm going to check him. House is still there. Wait, it's still a bit better. What are you doing? Me, what are you doing? Me, no, it's me. This is because he's still a vacuum. I'm starting to get... Ah! I'm sorry. It's too much. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, it's coming from the first 37. So, it's good, 37. This thermometer is very useful. I have this for a while. It's really hot. It's a bit better than the Master's working. Oh. Oh. Oh my goodness. Oh. It's not working. Is that... Yeah. Oh. It's going to be good. I'm going to be fine. It's too tired. Oh. Oh. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Oh, it's quite high. It must normally be high. High poles. The rush to wait. It's not much. It's not working. It's not working.
