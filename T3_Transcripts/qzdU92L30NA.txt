 with Pennsylvania and Hey YouTube, welcome back to Tribal lifestyle. It's your boy Chris Havier bringing you another YouTube video and today I got my boy Joey back in the building. Guys, what is going on this boy? She made his Zoui and I'm back with Chris and we all bring another Banger reaction video welcome on. I cannot wait to check this out. You know why? Because I had two of my family members request this. So I had Angie and Garnet Spine. They both told us that we need to react to this. They actually told me but I had to bring my boy Joey in this reaction video so we can react to this amazing artist. They told me that this girl is just as beautiful as Morrison and her vocal skills are on point as well. Her name is Julie Ann San Jose and she is performing this Pasito which if you guys know that is a Luis Fone'sy and Daddy Yankee song. She's doing a cover on this and I am going to react to this today. So I cannot wait to check this out. I'm excited. Are you doing? Bro, I am definitely excited because I know this song this Pasito. I don't know. I mean I was like a global sensation. I can't wait. I saw Luis Fone'sy and Daddy Yankee where number one on the Billboard's floor. A while. So I cannot wait to check out Filipinos own Julie Ann San Jose which I never reacted to on my channel before. He never reacted to on his channel before. So this is our first time ever reacting to her. So I cannot wait to check this out. Guys, enough of this talking though. Guys, get to react. But before we do, what I need you to do is go over to Julie's channel and check out both of his channels. Julie reacts and Julie because he has a lot of content coming up. So you guys stay tuned. Also what I need y'all to do is also subscribe to my channel. If you enjoy this reaction, hit that subscribe button below and get your E-D so you can get to subscribe. Right? But guys, enough of this talking. That's good to react. Julie Ann San Jose, this Pasito cover. Let's go. She's cute. Yeah, she's. Hey, you guys were right. Beautiful. Come on, let another reaction. Has a never-go-lan session where I'm standing here. It's a never-situational vision in the havin' yeah. Oh, oh, you're blind. Messing rice on the dark history. Got me feelin' some kind of... Oh! Holy damn. Oh man, I like Oh god, her is 40 seconds of this man. It's like an ear gasm And then when she said it, when she's more on the nibble in my ear, I'd be like, oh yeah I'm like, whoa, hey, I swear at it man. I swear at all those artists that I react to are females from the Philippines. They're all gorgeous. As you all know, more of a set of mone, she's one of my favorites. But Joey N. San Jose, she gave me a good first impression already. Fire first impression first off, I've never asked you heard this song, you know, like rendered in English. So they actually, they have an English version of the Louis Fondsidus Vasito as well. They made it, they made it Spanish and I never heard that. I always heard this Spanish version, which was fire already, right? But hearing the words in English, and how they trans, you know, trans were so well. My damn, bro, this song is fire and broke my ears. I love the way she sings too. And I was like, she came off and you're like, whoa, like instantly you're like, gravitated to the way she's talking and singing into the song. I like the way her voice sounds. I was vibing. I got to go back a little bit man. I got to go back and hear her and let's go. That's Spanish. She sings Spanish and English. And she's one of Philippines. As she's Filipino. So you already know she probably speaks Tagalog. Man, Tagalog. I'm telling you, just Philippines is way the talent at. I'm going to have my kids over there. I'm going to have my kids over there. So I need to tag the kids. Her real bro. If I, you know me, I'm a personality. That's all I do on YouTube. I'm a personality. I don't think I have like even an inch of her talent, you know. I don't have it. I'm sorry. It's so much time. I'm talented when it comes to speaking and going on in front of the camera. Hey, believe it or not, this is harder than it looks. But when it comes to singing, oh, actually, I can dance. So I guess I got a little town. But the way she sings, you guys told me already, Chris, stop singing, man. When you sing, I want to turn it off. It's in that's you. It was in that's I stopped singing, Chris. I would never, I would never. I'm never going to sing again. Right? I want to sing with this. I want to sing with her. And to this song, I don't ever want to sing ever again. I'm not chubby, man. You're a real bliss. I'm like, oh, that's my family. I thought we family. You know, I thought, you know, you will have your family. I like what you sing. You know, Chris, turn that shit off. All right, let Julie and San Jose sing. I'm like, okay, man. That's all I'm exactly doing right now. But guys, let's get back into her, man. Beautiful vocals for a beautiful girl like, Just the first Russian song in Taranf√∂r Yes I Do My I Do My I Do My I Do My I Do Do My I Do My I Do My I Do My I Do My I Do My I Do My I Do My I Do My I Do My I Do My I Do My I Do My I Do My I Do My I Do My I Do My I Do My I Do Your favorite You I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I
