Your problem seems to be serious
It’s nothing
I just want to breathe
I just want to escape
from everything for now
I really looked for Nanny Zeny
She’s the only person I'm comfortable with
and the only person who understands me.
By the way, this is my grandchild, Caloy.
You need to decide
You're the only one expected to
follow your father's footsteps
as the leader of our Libulan tribe
You went to the right place
It's fun here
I agree
I really envy this place
Everything is just easy
No, it's not.
Don't take life too seriously
But it looks like you're the one
who's really serious.
What if, we just swim in the river?
What? Let's go!
Hello John? Where are you?
Why did you suddenly disappear?
How about our wedding?
You have to shout everything to be free
I don't want this anymore
I'm already tired
Please set me free.
What's the problem?
I DON'T KNOW!
Ever since you locked me up to you
There I freed my true self
