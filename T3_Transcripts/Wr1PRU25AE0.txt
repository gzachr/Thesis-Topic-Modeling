Mother!
Did you open the ceiling?
What are you talking about?
I didn't.
That's too high...
Ask the helper...
Dear Wade,
Whoever you are,
I don't believe you.
This is not real.
We are not living in the same house...
but in different years.
It's 1974 now,
and not 2020.
If you don't believe me,
go in front of a mirror
by midnight...
Are you for real?
That's exactly
what I want to ask you.
Is this real?
There are
mysteries we can't explain
because of the supermoon.
Maybe who you saw in the mirror
is the one that's meant for you.
It's quite impossible...
You know who I saw in the mirror?
A man...
So what's wrong with that?
Isn't it possible for a man
to be in love with another man?
I don't know what is this I'm feeling.
I long for him.
I miss him.
Are you in love with him?
How?
We're in an impossible situation.
He lives in the past,
and I'm here.
I'm confused!
Just follow what you feel...
Remember what I told you?
The supermoon may grant wishes…
Let's try it.
Ours seems to be an impossible case.
But nothing's impossible with love…
Do you love me?
