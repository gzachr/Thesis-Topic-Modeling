okay we have a little bit of a problem now because 
Joseph's motorbike key is inside the bike yeah and  
it's locked so because the key is inside we can't 
open it and we obviously can't start the bike
today Joseph and me are going to 
an island we just left Iloilo took  
a ferry and now we are going to 
guimarius what is the name again
humorous Island we have our motorbikes with us  
parking down there and we're going to 
explore all around the island today
foreign
ride coming from Iloilo there's 
Joseph Albert yeah I think we can  
just go straight and then turn right 
on the main road yeah yeah and then  
there should be some beautiful beaches 
along this Coast yeah okay let's explore
and unfortunately so far it's not 
the best island weather you can  
see it's a little bit cloudy but 
hopefully it will clear up more  
later and hopefully no rain in the 
morning it also rains a little bit
here we should set the map
no signal let's make a quick stop because 
yeah we are like three minutes into the  
island and the roads already look like it's 
a deserted island you know maybe we should  
take another way like all the cars going to 
the left yeah you know all the cast uh took  
the left turn right and we took the right turn 
yeah but I remember I checked the map earlier  
and I think we had to go on the right side 
but well it looks like a deserted island  
here absolutely zero that's like an adventure 
now absolutely zero signal on the app here  
man I have not downloaded the map here but 
there's a beach if we continue the road here
yeah no problem with this bike
oh it's getting steep here 
now maybe I need both hands
sunglasses I dropped my sunglasses oh oh you saved 
my sunglasses oh I didn't notice that oh thank you
okay almost I lost my sunglasses here
hello we're looking for a beach  
we we saw on the map there's a beach 
there yeah we can go right here oh yes  
I left and then and then just straight yeah the 
highway not not here then uh elementary school
so at the school left okay 
okay thank you thank you
okay so you said going back to the highway
huh how about they said we need to go 
there ready and then she said something  
about going back to the highway huh 
at the beach yeah yeah it's there
yeah yeah I think it's that way okay
over there okay thank you
yes we have a proper Road here again
do you think it's here oh yeah this is 
the end of the road so it must be here
let's see
yeah there are several beaches around the island 
we're gonna check out a few of them today probably  
did you hear something yeah
yeah unfortunately they don't seem to 
have monkeys here in the Philippines I  
think I haven't seen a single monkey here 
yet and I usually like to see monkeys
you know the Christmas tree in the 
middle that looks interesting it  
would be great to shoot some ball and 
Seashore what is what is on the trees
yeah this is a beautiful location 
for a basketball court I I agree  
this is interesting like I'm wondering what 
this is there's some some liquid inside  
huh that's interesting do you have any idea 
what it is it's like a like water or something  
like this inside like color with water maybe 
what's this I don't know that's interesting  
it would be nice if you have somebody to 
ask here of any one of you in the comment  
section knows about this uh please feel free to 
explain in the comment section oh hello hello  
we're looking for the beach yes this is we can 
go down here okay okay thank you oh well okay
[Music] you know not really 
the the most exciting Beach
um well this is not really a 
beach that we were hoping to find
okay it is now almost an hour later we drove 
around the island and uh yeah so far we are not  
that impressed to be honest and uh yeah we saw a 
beautiful looking Beach on Google Maps and then  
we arrived at this beach and uh this is the beach 
looks different than on Google Maps to be honest  
so we drove like almost an 
hour away from the main road
hmm I also think it's low tide probably it looks 
more beautiful when it's high tide you know  
okay maybe the island has more to offer maybe 
another Beach will be better to be clear like  
this is not a touristy Island I think so you 
can't compare with places like bodakai or El  
Nido these famous places so we came here 
without high expectations of course yeah  
but let's not judge too early the day is still 
long this is just our second stop so we will see
well and it started to pour down on us 
heavily raining now and yeah we found  
a little cover place and actually I 
think they sell drinks here as well  
I can see oh it's really windy now 
hello you have drinks thank you
yes please you have a cold 
water do you want water as well  
yeah yeah oh they have a 
little uh oh thank you [Music]
oh there's a dog hello how much do you get 
15 now we're also stuck in the rain here
ah but you have to stay positive 
even in situations like this  
uh always stay positive you know 
things like this don't ruin my days
okay we found a new place and the beach here 
looks much better than the previous one yeah  
maybe this island has a beautiful place as well 
what do you think you want to swim over there  
there's a little island like 50 meters off the 
shore do you think we can swim over there can we  
swim to the island over there it's too low we can 
walk oh hold it even better we can walk over there  
yeah just over there now we can walk okay easy are 
you from here no no from Manila from Manila I'm  
staying here three days a holiday let's go on a 
little Adventure crossing over to the island over  
there and one of the friendly ladies over there 
just gave me her shoes because she said it's very  
uh uh not safe if you go without shoes because 
there are many uh sharp rocks here in the water  
so she uh brought with me her shoes 
very nice but the many rocks here  
yeah oh good that I have the shoes yeah you 
have your slippers right yeah yeah okay okay
because now I don't know five minutes to get 
over here yeah you have to walk slow there are  
many carvels but they're all dead actually so 
all that covers but you kind of have to walk  
around them no trespassing private property 
guests not allowed I think it's closed yeah  
the ladies didn't say anything about that 
they said there's a nice Viewpoint here
oh there's a proper chain here is a nice Viewpoint 
yeah and I also I saw the Viewpoint with the Drone  
so up there there's a viewpoint
here you can't open it oh no 
now we came here for nothing  
oh they're even spikes here so they 
don't want people to climb over  
see it okay thank you so much your shoes were 
really helpful without the shoes not possible yeah
you want to try oh yeah sure sure it's uh
[Music]
oh yeah that's perfect we don't have four you can 
do it like this yeah maybe just with your hands  
it's maybe easier no worries oh you don't have 
a knife right no so I need to take a big piece  
it's okay yeah okay so this is a pork right yes 
I tried chicken adobo before but not the pork one
how is it it's very good oh Masala yes
it is
hmm you want something that's really good 
oh what are you drinking whiskey [Music]
yeah just a little bit because 
we are driving and it's hot here
kind of dangerous
one of our colleagues and also oh you can 
tell your colleague it's very good yeah  
to do the Foreigner proofs
thank you so much electric oh 
a lot of big ice cube in here  
oh that's nice let me shoot the 
pork adobo first you can join us
like breakfast afternoon read this for breakfast 
time oh that's nice okay okay whether I'm just  
having some eggs right yeah but you mix it with 
something yes our lime juice okay okay [Music] are  
you joining yeah in Germany it's unpolite to drink 
alone you always have to drink with somebody else
okay
is it uh some some local drink or yeah
any mixture just straight pure right yeah
thank you so much okay let's give it a try
they're really good oh I like the lime 
juice yeah really good very limey taste  
like me flavor are really good but 
how the Ice Cube is kind of enjoying
I told it like this
that's actually very good
that's really nice like dinner 
so you stay here all day
I'm curious how much you have to pay for a 
cottage here but you can stay with all four  
people yeah okay okay but it's not too 
bad okay like you drink red horse here
that's a very popular video I'm drinking 
wet horse with some locals in Cebu yeah yeah  
they invited me they had a little 
birthday party they are yeah that  
was a nice experience yeah very nice people 
very nice people okay we have a little bit  
of a problem now because there's motorbike 
here inside the bike yeah and it's locked
oh my God so because the key is inside we can't 
open it and we obviously can't start the bike yes
today is not holiday
okay problem solving skills we need to 
solve this problem find someone who owns  
also this this bike it's like it's not 
not many people drive with this bike here  
this kind of motorcycle this is yeah kind 
of expensive motorcycles and I think even if  
there's another person with the same bike 
you can't just use the same key and yeah  
okay after some discussions here the plan is 
now we're going to uh drive around the Villages  
here see if we can find a mechanic we also just 
called the rental company and they suggested oh  
they can't come here because it's on an island 
so they can't bring a second key so they also  
suggested to find the mechanic and ask if they can 
help so the friendly locals here just offered they  
can regards the bike here they also stay here 
overnight so they can just have a look on the  
bike and uh Joseph is coming oh yeah today is 
really not our day start in the morning when I  
woke up and I saw that Germany is out of the World 
Cup that was already a bad start into a day okay
you think the motorcycle rental there they have 
a duplicated key I'm pretty sure they have here  
so yeah the the worst case 
is we go back to the mainland
okay luckily I got my phone oh the phone is not 
okay are you sure the key is inside here I'm 100  
saying sure not if we get someone break it up 
and then there's no kids let me recheck again
I'm sure I put it inside yeah  
and I checked the game but I didn't find my key 
so double check that's not inside your third time  
checking okay okay then let's see if we can find 
a mechanic okay you can jump on the back yeah
okay also like uh we are a little bit of time 
pressure now because it's four o'clock now and  
the last boat back to Iloilo leaves at seven that 
leaves a Time window of three hours now and make  
sure it is inside so I'm and yeah you don't even 
have a shirt now and also the ferry from here is  
like almost an hour away from here but it means 
we the latest we need to leave here is six or  
maybe a little bit earlier even okay let's go all 
right we drove to the next Village and we asked  
there's a mechanic here and the lady over there 
told us right here so somebody here oh hello  
we're looking for a mechanic we are looking 
for a mechanic mechanic yeah for motorbike  
yeah I think she will get someone
[Music]
they're discussing something
upstairs maybe in another Village all right 
we found some more guys who are trying to help  
you the whole village is 
trying to help us now basically
they're discussing some options here
you think foreign I want that before I think 
they're discussing some some ways how to help us
so there's a mechanic over there 
but do you think they can open it
but we try already they say no no no no no 
that's the one where we just went through
okay this guy here wants to have a look at the 
bike and see if he can help we're back oh yeah  
he says maybe he can uh can help oh we need to 
bring it over there ah out of the sun yeah okay
well at least we can move the bike 
at least it's not locked you know  
at least you didn't lock the bike so we can move 
the bike at least yeah so that's a good point  
never gets bowing here in the Philippines
oh no yeah I think it's it's made for 
not being able to for people to just  
so it's designed for not being 
that easy to open without the  
key so I would be surprised if 
it's that easy to open you know
how to open there's a YouTube video 
which shows how to open the nmax models
okay
how to become a chief  
that's everything on YouTube usually it's crazy 
you can find videos how to break open the bike
okay let's see if it works [Music]
okay we have a new idea uh this guy just 
suggested that he can he can start the  
bike without the key which is also interesting 
and then we can at least drive it to the rental  
shop yeah and just on the ferry you will yeah we 
cannot turn it off but that's okay I think yeah  
I guess I have to stay with the bike on the 
ferry just to make sure yeah but that's okay  
right yeah better than returning here 
tomorrow definitely yeah because our  
other idea was to go back to the rental shop in 
the evening yeah pick up a second key and then  
come back in tomorrow yeah but we can start 
the bike that would be uh way better yeah
wow thank you so much
oh my God
what was the secret a YouTube you know the YouTube 
video was the helping thing oh my God look at me  
I got it oh man I was so nervous man thank you 
so all you need is a few guys a YouTube video  
and just tell them you're uh I don't know like 
30 minutes time and then you can break into a  
bike like this they're amazing they figure out 
how to do it like watching YouTube videos yeah
wow but also scary that you can run into a 
bike like yeah yeah yeah you're definitely  
from no one we know that like definitely yeah 
don't leave your value bills on the bike all  
you'll need is a YouTube video to break 
into it the key the keys here oh my God
oh today will end with a happy 
end definitely happy now I feel  
so relieved it's like happiness is so simple
yeah it is the key don't 
leave it inside again anymore
everything working ah you can 
put on your shirt again as well
everything working oh thank you guys wait I want 
to give you something yeah thank you so much
thank you so much you really have 
saved our day now thank you very  
much thank you very much thank you you're 
a legend man thank you thank you thank you
but like the whole village came together to help 
oh very nice Filipino Hospitality saved our day  
I love Filipinos I love the Philippines we're 
actually very happy now but I think now also  
like the time is pleasure we need to go back to 
the Fairway theater thank you guys thank you very  
much okay bye-bye okay I won't say this I think 
I will not come back to this island for a second  
time because yeah it wasn't that spectacular 
right like the beaches driving around here  
it was maybe I'm also like too spoiled by too 
many other beautiful islands like bordakai or  
shiagao but this island I mean I don't regret 
coming here but I don't think I will visit this  
island again but I really have to mention again 
the awesome Hospitality of the people today not  
only the people that helped us uh opening the 
bike again also before the guys who invited us  
yeah having drinks with us so this day perfectly 
showed again the awesome Filipino hospitality  
people from Universe awesome and because of that 
I will always remember this island although the  
whole experience like no beautiful beaches 
new stunning no stunning views so but still  
we won't remember this island so we are back on 
the ferry now going back to Iloilo and if you  
haven't seen the video where we explored around 
Iloilo together and check out the previous video  
right here it's a healthy stay positive 
and then see on the next episode ciao guys
