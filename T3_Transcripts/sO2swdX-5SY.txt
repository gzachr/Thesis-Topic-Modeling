 The Philippines homeless some of the most beautiful islands in the world and some of the most amazing food and culture you'll ever experience. It's also home to the most friendly, humble, Filipino people that live day by day with smile on their faces regardless of the challenges they may face. As a Filipino American, they grew up in the USA. I wanted to humble myself and experience what life is like living like a Filipino in poverty. The goal is one month living in the Philippines province on a 200-pacel with day budget, which is $4 USD. I must live like a Filipino in experience every day just like my ancestors who still live and still live into this day. So join me on this new journey of becoming a true Filipino. Good morning guys. Welcome to day 24 of a foreigner camp. I'm going to show you a simple life on a budget of a simple life in the Philippines. But before I show you guys that I want to tell you guys we're going to be doing a surprise. What is the surprise for the day? Who are we going to surprise today? And what are we going to surprise them with? Filipino pizza. So guys, we're going to be trying Filipino pizza. Filipino pizza? For you? Yeah, for my first time but for you. I've been eating it. You've been eating it. So if people don't know what Filipino pizza is now, what is Filipino pizza? It's a cheap pizza that has Filipino sauce in it. What is cheap though? Is cheap? Does that mean it's bad? I mean it's good for the Filipinos. We appreciate it and we like it. I don't know about you. So we'll have the photo. But what's the difference between Filipino pizza and American pizza? It's like the pepperoni and the meat in there is different. Aside from the real pizza. And then they don't choose real mozzarella. They just use some cheese. They hold it like eating or something? Eating or something like that. Okay, well guys, these kids I've heard that they didn't eat today. So I'm going to be excited to feed them because aren't they very hungry right now? Yeah, they went here earlier and they told me they haven't eaten anything yet. So let's get the surprise guys. I've grabbed it. I got it. You cannot run from me, mamas. I'm going to run. So guys, before we give the pizza, we're going to give her her medicine. She knows she needs to take her medicine and she's trying to run away. But you're not going to run away, mamas. Winnie already took her medicine right now. Okay, mamas, you better not run. You better not hide. Winnie, excuse me. Wait, mamas? Let me grab her. Why me? I'm feeling you feeling? I'm feeling now. I'm almost. You got her the anti-back, right? This is the vitamin first. I'm very good. Don't shove it down like that, man. Relax. It's okay. Just on the side. Mmm, good job, mamas. So guys, when you live a simple lifestyle in the Philippines, three dogs are known to have ticks and we have to give the medicine for their ticks. So, that is just one challenge of living in the Philippines. Chasing street dogs and giving the medicine. Mamas, go get some water. Go get some water. Oh, she's run away. Alright, guys, let's go get that surprise. So guys, we just arrived at the Filipino pizza place in guys. If you guys can see, this is what they all have. These are the options.

Check the undercress now. Check the undercress. The undercress is very cooked. But it's been sitting for a while, as it's not hot. Cheers, no. What is that? Hot sauce. Yeah. Actually, I'll try a little. Mmm. No. Mmm. Not bad. This Filipino pizza is the dough. I think the dough is the best. The dough is good. Mmm. Mmm. Carbson hot sauce, huh? Mmm. That's it. I like a lot of pastas. Is it American hot sauce or Filipino hot sauce? We've been eating. Mmm. The cheese is very good. There's no hot sauce. Mmm. That's ketchup. It's not hot. It is hot, right? Mmm. I know when you eat hot sauce, you always get sweaty. Mmm. No. It's really just not super spicy, but it is unhotsy. So they also got a green pepper on there too. You taste the green pepper? Not yet. It's not only your own peppers, but I'll try. Let's put the pizza one down. That was a dollar, guys. One dollar pizza.

So now let's get into this amazing looking curry curry. And guys, when you saw the video, it was crispy, so hopefully it's still got its crisp. Probably not, because it's been sitting, but I don't even care. I'm so hungry. So this is lichon with curry curry, please. Mmm. What's the difference between lichon? Isn't there two pork dishes? Leachon and whatever. The duck pork is called the chon kawali. What's the other one? Lechon roasted beef. That's what we had at Barriotic. This is different. Yeah. This one is fried lechon. Okay.

I don't really like celery. Nah, it's so good. I love broccoli. Mmm. Try some of my mouth. I'll get some water. But yeah. This is incredible, guys. This is why I honestly love the Philippines. It's so cheap, but such good quality. And you don't even have to cook now. For five pesos more expensive, it's better than the other ones. I like their pizza. Because you usually spend 50 at the barong guy. Yeah, I usually spend 50 or 60 at the barong guy. But this one is more. No. It's like five pesos more. It's really the 60 pesos. So this one is 65. But it's a better... My gosh. But that one was 60? How much is that? Same. Yeah, same. What you think, no? Would you order that at a restaurant? Would you pay 350 for that? 350 for all of this? A huge pot? Yeah. Exactly. The quality is amazing. The pork is still... That's crispy. Yeah. Well, some parts are... Let's try this. This is the crispy part. This is amazing. Let's just pat the fat in the skin. This is fat? Mmm. No. We need to do a boodle. A boodle bite? Yeah. Explain what a boodle is, no? A boodle bite is like... When you eat with family, it's like... You put all the foods on top of the banana leaf. And just have a lot of rice in there, a lot of different types of food. And just a boodle bite. Just eat with your family. And you just get the bite over food and stuff like that. So... If we just buy Filipino food, like where we bought, we could just mix it up. Yeah. You can just put it on the table. Yeah, we need to try that now. That would be so good. One more. Mmm. That's so good, no? I got you, no, I got you. I got you. I see if you want more or not. Don't worry. I got you, no? I got you. You got pizza, no? It's okay. I'm just kidding. Why is this? To get back my own. It's just okay. You can have it. You promise? You're not just saying that? No. Yeah, I just can have it. Mmm. No. I love the Filipino. It's really like I regret that much. Go take some. I don't like. I don't like the sauce. What? I like the pork itself. But I'm not really a fan of curry curry. This is why I love the Philippines now. Don't get me wrong. I love your cooking. But... I think this is a chef's cooking. Yeah. 65 Bezo. A day? That's a dollar a day. And I can get food like this every day. I'm so impressed. I want to taste the broth. But I don't have a... I like their bowl for them. You got to eat. Eat your food and then taste the broth. What's that? What's the broth? I love that. Look how healthy that is. You get broccoli, you get all that vegetables. Broccoli and they have some baguettes. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Come on, boy. Alright. Okay. No? There's not no meat. I'll give you mine. I'm done. One. I can have mine. I want to kill the pizza. Okay. Go get that pizza. That's a fair trade. God. No one can eat that is. Mmm. No. What? We need to go back there. What? Back? Mmm. Here we're going to have mine too. I want some water. We have a lot of water. Mmm. I'm choking. You can throw that thing. Pork soup. You're careful. Is this sour? I'm not sure. Vinegary? I don't think so. Mmm. It smells so good. It smells good. Whoa. That's amazing. Wow. And it's easy. What is this called? Nelaga. Nelaga babori. Babori. It's not too salty. It's pretty, it's like, yeah. Could use a little more or something, but it's still good. It's good. It's free. I appreciate the owner for giving that. Free soup. I always give free soup. Excuse me. The comments of the chef. The comments of the chef are them. Mmm. I'm so full, guys. Gosh. You like it now? Yeah. Very good. No. Who wants so full? You get so full easily. I don't think I can do more. I could, but. You're just as low either. So, guys, we want to start a series we're going to do. The verse of the day. What's your verse for the day? My verse for the day is Job chapter 1 verse 22. One, two, uh. Or 21. Let me do it for you. So, our first verse for today is Job chapter 1-21. The Lord gives and the Lord also takes away. Praise the Lord always. So, touch on that now. What does that mean? What does that mean? Why me? You. You're doing a lot of that. Well, that's the verse of the day. The verse of the day, the Lord gives. But the Lord also takes away. So, guys, that's basically telling you to stay humble. It's telling you to stay humble just like we're doing. Because, guys, the Lord can give you blessings. Like he just did. But he can also take that away at any time. Like this. So, we are just thankful for this journey. We're thankful for this journey. Touch on what we're saying. So, basically, we're saying we're thankful for this journey. We're being humble about this journey on YouTube. And, basically, we understand that this journey can get taken away from us like that. So, we have to be grateful for all the viewers that is watching. And we have to understand that this might not be forever. So, like the verse, Job, chapter 1, verse 21 says, the Lord can give, but the Lord can also take away. We understand that nothing is guaranteed in life. But we appreciate when we do receive the blessings. So, that's all we really wanted to say with the verse of the day. So, we appreciate you guys for watching. We're very thankful for you guys watching. And if you do decide to keep watching us, we will love to have you on this journey. So, we thank you guys. We appreciate you guys.
