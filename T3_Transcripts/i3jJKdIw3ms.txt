Squarespace [Music] if you're thinking you're
thinking about coming to Coron here in the
Philippines I hope this video will be useful
for you not only will I show you where I stayed
and a great spot for Sunset but I'll also
go on one of the most popular island hopping
tours and show you the Magnificent sites so
sit down and relax and enjoy this little escape
to one of the most beautiful places in the
world
[Music] good morning and welcome to the final
the final installment of this Philippine series
we've been backpacking around the incredible
country of the Philippines for the past five
weeks and you know we started off in Manila
where we got to know a little bit of the history
and we met some of the locals there we had
a great time in Boracay I enjoyed the sunsets
enjoyed the sailing and scuba diving great
time in Boracay then we had bad weather in
Cebu and we still made some Adventures we
made some good memories there and after that
we went to Mindanao and we climbed Mount Apo
the tallest mountain in the Philippines and
ever since then we've been in Palawan in El
Nido and on a Tau Expedition for six days
across the ocean here to Coron which is my
final destination I've been hanging out for
a couple of days here at Hop hostel which
is a very beautiful hostel it's done in the
Greek style beautiful flowers a nice swimming
pool here where there's lots of bean bags
and hanging out great food however I will
say that this will be the last hostel I think
I ever stay in even though it's really nice
I just can't handle it anymore there was a
bloke snoring his head off last night smelly
shoes people coming in at all types of hours
drunk you know usual fun young hostile backpack
alive I'm 37 now I'm 37 I can't handle it
anymore I'm too old I'm officially a miserable
old bastard foreign
for the final episode we could explore this
town of Coron it's a small town that sits
on this Bay and there are lots of beautiful
places today I'm going to go on a little tour
around the local area I'll show you some of
the beautiful sights that this place has to
offer I'll show you some more of the town
and some more of these sites and we'll just
sort of take it easy today and we'll just
go at our own pace let's go enjoy Quran and
see what we can find today so the lovely people
at the front desk at the hostel recommended
that I couldn't be in Quran without trying
one of the many island hopping tours and they
recommended the best one was the ultimate
package and I paid 1600 pesos and I was picked
up that morning around eight o'clock and we
were quite quickly shipped off onto a little
boat with 15 or so other Backpackers and we
were heading in the general direction of paradise
[Music]
thank you
[Music] it's starting to look like Avatar
again there's quite a few boats here already
which is surprising because it wasn't that
busy when we were leaving to see it better
over here look at this
wow wow wow wow wow
I want to swim right there see if I can find
some fish [Music]
okey dokey so I've flown the Drone and got
a perspective of what's going on it seems
like because there's a lot of boats you can't
actually swim here because you'd just get
hit by a boat so what we have to do instead
thank you
is make our way along the train of boats go
past everybody else's tour hello
paradise and head to another one I hope hi
can you give me a hand sorry I love to not
fall in here
the water visibility is unbelievable
but that's kind of normal here in the Philippines
looks a little bit like Southern Thailand
with these jaggedy Limestone Cliffs except
for these outrigs on the sides of the boats
that's the very Filipino touch isn't that
beautiful look at the color of that turquoise
bow in the turquoise Waters
this first stop had a quick hike up to about
350 steps or something not difficult and not
lengthy up and over a little mountain to reveal
the freshwater lake
[Music] thank you
okie dokie here we go [Music]
it was fun to swim around they do enforce
the life jackets which means you can't really
go underwater and you know you're swimming
with a bunch of other people so if you need
a professional looking website for your business

slash Paddy Doyle to get 10 off
welcome to the second stop Barracuda Lake
and we were told you know bring your life
jacket you're not allowed to snorkel and I
thought to myself let me fire the Drone let
me just see if it looks any different and
of course undeniably beautiful you can see
people swimming in a designated area and everybody's
got a life jacket on and no one's allowed
to snorkel and I'm absolutely desperate and
on the edge of our boat here you can see the
fish and there's this huge Coral shelf that
surrounds these beautiful Limestone Cliffs
and you know it gives you a depth of about
two or three meters and then there's just
like a sheer wall and it looks like a really
fun place to go free diving a really fun place
to go snorkeling and I've asked the captain
I said can I just skip Barracuda because I'd
rather just have a little bit of an alone
time just me and you with the fish in this
and we'll swim along this little wall of coral
and see what we can find that sounds way more
fun to me
[Music]
and yeah it was way way more fun as you can
see
yeah I mean to be honest I wasn't really vibing
from going stop to stop with so many people
and the crowds from all the other tours and
so just by asking if I could swim off and
have my own little space and have my own little
mini Adventure it was such such a good idea
and so if you're feeling the same as me just
ask a tour guide I'm sure he'll let you swim
away and do your thing and then the tour continued
to a few more places that were just undeniably
beautiful and as this drone shot shows you
it's just it's part of the world guys this
part of the Philippines almost felt like it
was saving the best to last and instead of
me just trying my best to put how beautiful
this boat tour and this part of the Philippines
is into words I think I'm just gonna let Mother
Nature do all of the
thank you
[Music]
[Music]
thank you foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music] foreign
[Music]
so this is the secret Lagoon and most people
come here by kayak you can kayak around or
you can swim and then climb up the ladders
like we just did
man
[Music]
and yeah as I was swimming under the water
and I'll show you some more of the incredible
footage not only of the reefs but of the Limestone
Cliffs the places that the boat was sailing
across the amazing turquoise waters I'll share
it all with you right now visually but um
I just also want to quickly talk about the
thrill and the joy that I get from traveling
solo this has been a five-week trip around
the Philippines and I've been making YouTube
videos about it and I've hoped I hope you've
enjoyed them I've had a lot of fun expressing
myself and trying new things and just having
a laugh and just enjoying travel and expression
because there's something about the thrill
of hitting the open roads that you just can't
you just can't replicate that thrill the freedom
the independence and you just truly experience
things when your solo traveling and for one
thing you know it's very empowering I feel
you're forced to rely on your own wits and
resourcefulness
I mean yeah it can be scary at first the prospect
of solo travel but honestly once you're out
here you can navigate these unfamiliar areas
and figure out what public transportation
is how to interact with the locals how to
navigate an entire country whether you're
on the back of a motorcycle or in a chicken
bus or on a little boat sailing across some
Paradise Avatar Style Waters here in the Philippines
for example these can just boost your confidence
and help you in all aspects of your life I
promise [Music] foreign
[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
[Music] foreign
must go on a trip completely on your own at
some point in your life if you have done many
solo travel trips before leave me a comment
I'd love to know what you guys benefit from
when you go on a solo trip please let me know
in the comments below
and we're going to finish this Quran exploration
and this Philippine series with one last cold
beer at One Last Sunset Viewpoint it's been
a pleasure thanks for watching and let's enjoy
the last scene together [Music] engage the
calf muscles
Ash for a lovely day let's see it's time to
do something that Quran is very famous for
which is walking up 700 steps to that beautiful
sign and a Jesus cross and a gorgeous view
overlooking the whole of the karambe so we've
grabbed a couple of cold beers and we're going
to try and finish our exploration of Chron
in style
and it's going to be a nice timing yes
our plan came together 700 steps we're nearly
there just at the bottom of the sign I'll
show you the view in a second don't worry
what 12 15 minute walk not too bad looks like
they light it up at night with these light
bulbs that's cool One More Level to go not
quite at the top yet 720.
we made it have a look at this
we made it

up here not the best for you but but follow
this path and there seems to be a viewing
area
