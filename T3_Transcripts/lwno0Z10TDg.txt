 What's up guys my name is Miles and my name is Fez and this is the commodity and today we're reacting to our Filipinos Asian Hispanic or Pacific Island So before we hop into this I got I saw a comment about me not kind of reacting to the Spanish names in the Philippines and I already have seen names in the Philippines. So I didn't like overreact to it or you know, I like I think there was a I was like I Mean I've already known that there were some Spanish Names to him. So I just didn't react to it. Yeah, there's a lot of Spanish ties in in the Philippines. Yeah And I had already seen in some other videos that Some of the areas are named after Spanish and I don't know about Pacific Islanders But I know for I almost said Pacific Highlanders Specific Highlanders. I don't know about Pacific Highlanders, but I do know Obviously the Philippines has ties with Hispanic and Asian. Yeah, and then Pacific Islanders I believe places like Hawaii Yeah, yeah, well, let's go ahead and hop in check this out and see what This person thinks What are you? What are you? Just picture somebody like poking them in the face. What are you? All right, so the Philippines recently won Miss Universe which means once again The Philippines is an international spotlight and how many of you Filipinos out there have gone these questions Like our Filipinos Asian Our Filipinos Hispanic Our Philippines for the Islanders Short answer yes, yes, and yes The long answer That's a little tricky This is where it gets a little complicated So first Our Filipinos Asian Honestly, I'm surprised that we still get this question The Philippines has officially been listed as an Asian country since forever I feel like it's to be in the island Geographically it is Asian People cite Filipinos for not being Asian One are a connection to the West and two the country's religion Yes, the Philippines was Spanish and US occupied and well because of that Spanish occupation the country is mostly Catholic So I'm going to break this down geographically ethnically culturally and linguistically Geography Look at Taiwan which is the closest country to Philippines We are 100 miles from Taiwan you could literally swim from it by that To orchid island We're also 400 miles from mainland China. In fact, we're closer to China than Japan is Hmm, so the Filipinos that you see every day like me and your friends are not how the original Filipinos actually look like Ethnicity this is an aboriginal Filipino and because of their separation from the rest of society and the rest of the country There lineage has been mostly untouched by Spanish Chinese and other visitors So they would most accurately represent how the original Filipino would look like So the Filipinos you see every day like me movies tv's your co-worker that's really good at karaoke your milk Like kpop What are the results of generation and generations of mixing? Mainly Spanish Chinese and Indonesian So one of the most popular theories is called the out of Taiwan theory Which was popularized by an Australian anthropologist by the name of Peter Bellwood It states that the first settlers of the Philippines came from Taiwan and China you know We always got comments that you looked Malaysian But I could see you more in the Philippines Well come to find out. I'm a huge mutt I did one of those DNA tests. I came out to be about 50% uh South texan northern mexican Like native and then the other half is Spanish and portuguese Okay, so no Asian in my no Asian blood around Spanish which is our relationship So if you go back far enough I'm sure most Filipinos can trace their lineage all the way back to China And since C migration has become viable the Philippines has always been a destination for Indonesian Chinese and other Asian immigrants Culture Filipino culture and her traditions are in line with a lot of other Asian countries We have the same kind of values We teach you know higher spec for elders, thriftiness We celebrate the same festival It seems like they're very mixed much like that Yeah, where we enter the house How Asian is that and another point Food I mean look at this we have very similar cuisine Yeah, I I might be related I might be a little show pal tofu and I mean pretty much everyone drinks boba Yeah, that isn't evidence enough. I don't know what is Hala holo. There's a boba place right next to where I work Language which means it has the same so in the learning it's expensive though. It's like six dollars for a small And soon the news and in addition to that a lot of the garlic is derived from Chinese Mandarin and Chinese Hokkien which is a southern Chinese language in Tagalog tea is ta It mangan is ta Gold is ginto It mangan is ding tiiao Soy sauce is toyo And hokkien is dao yu In Tagalog, ki is suci And hokkien is suci Your age is hikou And hokkien is hikou So pal It's very summery, yeah Ethnicly It's just an unsubstantian seems to be the main difference Our asian without a doubt Anyone who says otherwise I don't know probably hates Filipinos You're not asian. Oh, Prapula Pinos is spinning Nations and cultures that have a historical link to Spanish language or country of Spain More commonly it applies to the countries once on their colonial possession by a Spanish empire Spain occupied the Philippines for a really really really long time Usually the first country when you think of the word Hispanic is Mexico But never to Philippines. Why is that? So if we go back, Spain occupied Mexico from 1521 to 1821 Which is exactly 300 years However on March 31st 1521 a man named Vernon and Magellan Suddenly planted across on the summit of the hill Overlooking the sea and claimed for the king of Spain Possession of all the islands he had seen This is my Especially and by records mark the beginning of the Spanish colonization of the Philippines However Magellan died only a month later So people like to cite February 13 1565 Which was when Miguel Lopez de la Gaspi conquered Seguro That looks like an old picture even though obviously it's not That's 377 years or 333 years if you go by a second date Spain occupied the Philippines longer than Mexico Hmm if anything Filipinos or more than the Mexicans that was a joke don't hurt me Yeah, we still speak Spanish to be fair Hernandez Garcia Santos Sanchez you can't get any more Hispanic than that With all of your years of Spanish occupation you can be sure there was a lot of Spanish Filipino mixing and intermarrying now whether this was by choice of the Filipino or not is irrelevant But because of how inconsistent and unreliable Filipino records were in the 1600s There's not really any accurate number of how many Filipinos have Spanish ancestry The number is very depending on which report you look at but I've seen the number as high as 50% of Filipinos now I doubt the numbers actually that high but it just gives you some perspective of how much Filipinos have Spanish ancestry Link way linguistically is so do they have a like a 24 and like a DNA test do they have those that y'all can do I mean I don't know if you are able to do hours. I don't know if it's like an international 23 and year whatever. Yeah, it's a 23 24 me. I don't know 23 and me and then mine was ancestry dot com or something like that any and me but I would like to know like with the percentages because I'm a high percentage of Spanish Yep, influence and then of course I already have Mexican influence in me as well so I mean I wear it on my skin you can let us know if you guys have done DNA tests before and and like what you were Overall overall is yeah because I have like small I have like 1% african mm-hmm. I was like that's kind of cool It doesn't help me in my athleticism Come on what 1% is it but Yeah, let's go and get back to this. Yeah Spanish has been an official language of the Philippines since 1565 Aside from Spanish itself Tagalog has heavy Spanish influence in fact 40% of all Tagalog words has their origin in Spanish and even uses Spanish outright So yes, Filipinos are Hispanic Our Filipino specific Islander our Filipino specific Islander I don't copy me this one's tricky if you just want to go by the definition that a Pacific Islander is an inhabitant of an island in the Pacific Then yes, Filipinos do live on an island in the Pacific But if you want to go deeper Pacific Islander usually refers to the inhabitants of islands of Micronesia Melanesia and Polynesia Polynesian sauce is really good I agree from Chick-fil-A Here's a map of Micronesia. If you look at the owner of Polynesian sauce is really from Polynesia Polynesia. That's a good question If you're watching from Polynesia Or if you have friends or family in Polynesia, let us know if the Chick-fil-A sauce Polynesian sauce is from Polynesia These guys are idiots like It's a good question though. I'm curious And Palau was actually technically part of the Philippines back in 1885 I couldn't tell you anything about so according to the same theory I mentioned the Polynesian settlers of Micronesia actually came from the Philippines and you can see on the map migration started here in Taiwan Then to the Philippines and then from the Philippines our ancestors migrated eastward About 2,200 BC from the zone to the Mariana's islands and Guam and then later in 1,000 BC From Mindanao to Palau And later spread through rest of Micronesia around 200 BC and being only 600 miles away Continual migration was shared between the Philippines and Micronesia even until today Meaning modern Micronesian Filipinos would have the same ancestors In fact, almost 40% of inhabitants in northern Mariana's That's beautiful. And Palau are ethnically Filipino and an even bigger percentage have some sort of Filipino ancestry It is theorized that the first settlers of Polynesia came from the Philippines in Taiwan They then migrated south through Melanesia in 1300 BC So technically Micronesia Melanesia and Polynesia are Filipino Not the other way around it quite possibly as well uh From Thailand as well. Oh, yeah, but That region of the country is what is what I'm understanding is there the theory in yes Then later to Samu and I don't know if there's Then to Tonga guaranteed right to the rest of the islands in 700 Simoa This would mean that modern Polynesians and Filipinos would have the same ancestors linguistically the connection is also evident in the language Take the word mata in Tagalog mata means eyes And it's also the same in Samuans, Tongan and Tahijian Sky is Langan in Tagalog In Samuans it's Langan Counting from one to ten is basically the same in Subwano and Samuans In Subwano and in Samuans it's Usa It's Tasi Duhat Luah Tu-lo To-lu U-pat Fa Lima Lima Uno Uno Pit-to-lo Fitu Wall-lo Valu Sham Iva Ugg Napolo Se-Fulu Actually All the Filipino, Polynesian, Micronesian and Melonian languages Are all classified as Astronegan languages because of their shared origin and their similarities I wonder where this size comes from because the What's it called? I came with the the the second the Hawaiians the Samuans Samuans They're huge yeah They are not small people in general. They are gigantic freaking people. Well the Spaniards were short people Yeah, but I'm curious of what the How they got so much bigger big Then the rest of because I bet you the average height for Samuans is much closer to six foot than it is five foot Six or five foot five whatever it was for yeah Southeast Asian countries so No So our Filipino specific out of there well we definitely have shared ancestry But it depends on your definition and who you ask since definition clearly states Polynesian Melonian and Micronesian I don't know maybe you decide to summarize our Filipino specific out of there Depends on your definition once again our Filipino Hispanic Yes Our Filipino Asian That's five foot five actually one million percent yes All the Samuans I've met are tall. I hope this cleared things up If you like what you saw get subscribed follow my Instagram. This was a good video If you guys enjoyed this definitely I'll leave a link to this video in the description subscribe to his channel Super well put together It was very informative as well. Yeah, no it was really cool like uh I didn't I Know several Samuans I just Have never because most of them are very Americanized. Mm-hmm, and they don't like know their native language or anything like that So it was kind of cool hearing it like that and comparing it to um Tagalog I believe it's how they say it So I thought that was really cool But according to this it says that their average height is five foot five So all the the I know three Samuans I believe in the shortest one is like five ten Well, I'm like at now it could they could be mixed with other things right that make them so tall Yeah, I know I enjoyed listening to the different languages kind of Mingle together kind of mesh with each other Obviously we knew Filipinos were Asian And we also knew that yeah, yeah, yeah, and we knew that they had a lot of Hispanic ties um Pacific Islanders, you know, like he said it's for you to decide by definition technically No and yes because they have the same ancestors, but yeah You know, yeah, it leaves I mean it leaves a discussion to be had yeah let us know in the comments After you subscribe to his channel our channel give us a like then let us know in the comments If you think they're Pacific Islanders yeah, and with that being said my name's Miles and my name is first Thanks for watching guys peace out
