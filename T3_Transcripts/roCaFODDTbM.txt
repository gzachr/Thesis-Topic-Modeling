that should be it ta-ra today my parents-in-law 
in the philippines will try dutch food two types  
of giniling baboy at baka kilo oh it's so nice 
to cook in the philippines again can't wait to  
see the reaction of my parents-in-law this recipe 
is not completely dutch because i wanted to use  
ingredients that you can find in the philippines 
so that you can try making this one yourself  
konting toyo na lang also konting asin just a 
little bit make sure not to overdo it remember  
that we also have tomato ketchup and other 
ingredients which add flavor to the dish  
tamis anhang version isang tablespoon 
na lang white pepper cayenne pepper one  
package i like these tiny packages from the 
philippines these are really handy and also  
a some package of garlic powder this is 
a must for meatball recipe now i'm adding  
breadcrumbs i'll add one package 
of breadcrumbs it looks like a lot  
but this will really make the meatballs firm 
the amazing mascovado sugar from the philippines  
it's about isang tablespoon you might wonder 
why i'm cooking so much for my parents-in-law  
but you know every time i cook in the philippines 
there's like 20 other persons joining us so i'm  
gonna make a little bit extra because we might 
get a lot of visitors i added one tablespoon  
cornstarch you can also add one more egg to 
make it extra firm but it's not necessary  
because we already add the bread crumbs you know 
i don't like to measure things exactly i always  
do it on feeling you know 
that's much nicer in my opinion  
so we're adding four cloves of 
garlic as well i wanted to leave the  
just the garlic powder but i know filipinos love 
bawang so we're going to add a little extra bawang
i made sure to wash my hands of course so 
now we're going to grind everything mix  
everything mix lahat just mix everything 
together just mix lahat and we're gonna  
shape these into balls and they're actually 
gonna be pretty big make sure to mix it really  
well so that all the spices and two kinds of 
giniling and mix then just shape the balls  
meatballs and like i said pretty big just use 
approximately the same size just shape them  
like this you roll it and you're done 
pffeww sobrang iniit dito sa Pilipinas  
but i love the init so here's uh probably 25 to 
30 meatballs that should be enough for a filipino  
gathering diba we're gonna peel the potatoes 
i'm cooking it's a dutch recipe with potato  
yeah it's potatoes and meatballs it's simple 
simple food in the netherlands you eat simple  
that's food dutch food so i hope you're gonna like 
it so now i'm doing all the potatoes and onions  
and carrots nanay is already curious peeling of 
the potatoes is easy but it takes a little bit of  
time nanay is helping me with cutting the 
potatoes ah this is pinoy style with the knife
delicious iced coffee for me  
wow so now it's time for the carrots same thing 
as with the potatoes i'm just peeling them nice  
will you use this also for the halaman yes 
that is nice for the halaman right here you  
can just sit up here so we just chop it like this 
small pieces like you would make a pancit canton
the rest of this dish is pretty simple 
just wash the potatoes in the dirty kitchen  
same with the carrots and the onions give them a 
little wash we're gonna turn it on the potatoes  
first it has uh about one and a half times the 
amount of water in the meantime we're gonna fry  
the meatballs here in the other pan oh this 
is going to be so brang sarap if you have not  
seen the grocery shopping yet i'll put the 
link in the description for the other video  
i'm going to put a little 
bit of salt on the potatoes  
are you also excited to see nanay and tatay's 
reaction how will they react to this dutch food  
because it's so simple lang do you have magic 
sarap i think that is really it's totally not  
dutch it is very filipino it should be very 
sarap see it needs to have a nice color like this
is
the potatoes are half cooked at this moment
normally in the netherlands we use a masher for 
this but i'll be creative like pinoy so we just  
mash everything i removed the water as you can see 
i just left a little bit of water carrots patatas  
magic sarap
we mix the butter and this is low heat so that the 
final moist can go out and it's pretty much done  
we put it like this we'll add one of the 
meatball in the middle it's like a doughnut right  
the sabaw goes on top like that 
kain na tayo tatay this is uh  
food from the netherlands from the netherlands
