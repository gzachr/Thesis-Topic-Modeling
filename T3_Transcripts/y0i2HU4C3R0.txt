hi I'm Korean Oppa
Who love the Philippines
Today in Philippines
I came in Makati, P. Burgos
Where people are discriminated with their jobs
And they are also normal human beings
So i came, to share my heart
This is my first time to see like this
So, what did you think of free hug guy? In a first sight.
it's good.
This is your first time to see free hug guy right?
Yeah.
So what do you think of free hug guy, in a first sight?
Maybe he loves the Philippines
What did you think of free hug guy in a first sight?
Compare to another guys or tourist?
I think it's the first time
I’m very.. So shocked because of what he’s showing
Free hug that I saw here.
And I have a second thought to hug him
Becuase I’m so shy, that’s why.
What is your first impression?
When I saw him, with a placard of a Free hug
So I think he was a good guy
So good looking and seeing him alone in a space
So I wanna hug him.
So I feel good.
What did you think of free hug guy in a first sight?
Compare to another guy and tourists?
I think not all guys is you know, not so harassment
Because in this street, many Foreigners and Asian
I mean, when they talk in the girl in the streets
”So hey!” like that
He is not (Korean Oppa)
So I felt curious for him
That's why, I wanna feel his.. how his hug.
So I had feeling, for his hug
So I feel comfortable in a few minutes
So after I hugged him, I saw his eyes
He's a formal person not unlike other guys
Who came here in the streets
to get girls or talk to the girls
Sometimes they are naughty but he is not.
Although he is not talking, but
I know in my mind he is good
That’s why he deserve a hug.
He deserve it.
