 So how is going to feed the cat? The cat that is always staying here at McDonald's. Every time we go to McDonald's, he always brings food for the cat. Is she there? Yes, she's waiting. So this is the McDonald's. And the cat is here. So we bring food for her. Is she's pregnant? So this is the McDonald's just opened. I think it's two months now. So this is the McDonald's close to us. Right here at Kelino. So this McDonald is close to the McDonald's. So this is the McDonald's. The McDonald's is just waiting and still not done. We are supposed to open. But I think because of the COVID, it's not open now. It's not open right now. This one I think so. Because they were planning to open this month. Then they changed. Now they are using it as a vaccination site. Even the Manila be the Dolomite Sun. They are also using that for vaccination sites. And also the native park. So the few days ago they used to do the new hospital. So yeah, we just walked in guys. We are really our daily routine. We love to walk. Walking around here at Malati. And every time we walk in, how is always being cutboard or the food. And every time he saw three cuts, he always said them. Yesterday we went to Manila. So how are we doing cut food like to kill us? Cut food. Today we are walking here at Kowino. Feeding the street cats. Do you want to look there? No. Just the street now. Okay. Yeah. This street, I'm trying to be walking on this street. This street is not safe for you to walk. It's usually nighttime. This is close to the slum area. And that over there. There's a lot of people sleeping there. In the corner. It's not safe. It's a good thing you know they have fully some time, you know. Standing over here. So yeah. So sometimes we'll be walking here. So we are walking, going to the market. The market which is close to us. So that's the Manila tomb. Hopefully it will open soon and we will go there. We will bring my sister and my son. And also my love. Oh, that one is. I haven't been there. Yeah. For almost 60 or even 60, right? It's like we are close to Manila's door but we never go there guys. That's what it is. If you like the place that you know like far away, then you will go there. Because we want to see that place. But then it's a place close to us. It's like it's close. It's like it's okay. We are close. You can do any time. So until this Manila, so it's close. And because they are innovating. Then we don't have the chance to go and see that place. We've been made. It's like it's only my one time to see this Manila's door. And they never go again. So now because they are innovating, so I want to see how you know look inside. So yeah. It will open. Then we will go. They have entrance. I don't know how much they have entrance. Before, it's like 100% so you eat when we go inside. And that is long time ago when I went there. If I remember, I think it's like six to seven years ago. Six or maybe eight. Maybe eight. I'm not sure. Maybe like seven to eight years ago when I went to Manila's door. So imagine how long.
