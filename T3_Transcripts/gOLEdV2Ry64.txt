welcome back to the channel so if
you're new here I'm Jimmy and I am Tah
and we are in the process of running
through all of our Mexico travel content
yeah and once in a while, we would like
to actually throw a bunch of
informational content as well to better
give the value to all of you here so what
happens in our Mexico travel vlog
series is that you would probably see some
comparison and some Filipino comment on Mexican VLOG so there's a lot of comments
below that catch our eye and we really
wanted to touch subjects on that so it's
all start from Manuel. He has been
subscribing on our channel ever since we
were in the Philippines that's all the
start of all the hype of Mexican and
Filipino talking about how similar it is
like Filipinos say that Mexican just
like Filipino in terms of Value, culture and thing from what they see in our VLOG Series and...
Mexican said oh you are my brother and
since we traveled both recently we
wanted to touch subject on what we
found very similar I think it's so
interesting also because Filipino
culture not only just similar to
Southeast Asian country in general but
also North America to Mexico as well
yeah so that's why I think it would be
like hitting 2 birds in 1 stone if
we just compare and talk about the
culture for both countries to get you the
general idea and the glimpses of what you
can expect when you visit both countries
Philippines and Mexico so when we first
arrived in the Philippines it was kind
of a big shock for me coming from the US
because in the u.s. you don't really
have this as much and you don't really
see it like really anywhere
unless you going into a bank that's when
you'll see it there's armed security
guards everywhere so it was like kind of
a pretty big shock when you know they're
standing at a gas station and there's a
big shotgun a machine gun in their hand
I'm talking about ' BIG GUN' you're like
what is going on in here like why
they're armed security guards everywhere
but it's really good when we were
talking to the locals and everything we
really realized that you know the
government is giving jobs to the locals
and that's like a way because there's so
many people in these cities it's a great
way to give more jobs to the locals yeah
yeah for what I heard is like it's
like a big business going on with like
the agent that supply all the security
guard but you know what is
the good thing about this is because
both Mexico and Philippines are the
country that the media just portray
to be danger to be dangerous but in
reality like you feel so safe because
there are many guards and police. One thing that set Mexico a
little bit different from Philippines
that I'd see the great amount of police
car yeah better than in the Philippines
in Mexico at least police car
everywhere but there's also armed
security guards in Mexico so like what
we were getting at is like there's a big
similarity between the Philippines and
Mexico in the terms of security yeah
both countries are very strong
at showing providing jobs and giving
security to the people that are in the
country yeah it's really amazing
oh talking about providing jobs in
Mexico if you go to the grocery go to
the supermarket like Soriana you will
see that actually the person who put
everything in a plastic bag in a
shopping bag are all old people and 
I don't know if this is true but one of
my friends family has a house in Mexico
and because he's a foreigner that owns
property in Mexico he is required to
actually have Mexicans come work on the
property he's not allowed to hire
foreigners to work on the property
so I don't know if that's true but if
you you know if you know anything about
this in Mexico let us know in comment  below or in
the Philippines as well because I don't
know anybody that owns property in the
Philippines if you explore the Mexican
culture and the Philippines culture by
the Hofstede cultural dimension so basically hopstede
dimension is like the 6 aspects of
cultural dimension so basically this
thing if you take a look here I compare
Mexico with the Philippines and one of
the outstanding cultural dimension that
you can see is about the individualism
Mexico got 30 on the chart
and Philippines got 32 on the chart so
meaning that Mexico and Philippines
are collectivist country they're very
very similar in this aspect that's why
their scores are so similar.
for example in Philippines and Mexico
one of the most common
characteristic is that you will see in family
 big group of
family go out and eat together and so
it's more about 'WE' more about gathering
like a group of people go
together in Mexico in Philippines what
we realize is that like everything is about sharing and Extended family
for example the family
run business you see a kid sitting there
with their parents. The Extend of 
family is huge and one thing
though when you visit. when you go
inside the house either it be
Philippines or Mexican house
especially outside the city not like in
Manila in Mexico City you will see that
people with tons of family members live
together in the in the same area
it's just like if you watch movie Coco
it reminds me a lot of
Indonesian - in Bali oh yeah one house yeah one
house and then like next to it will be
like the aunt's house next to it'll be
the grandparent house it sounds like it's a
community of family members that live in
that one group actually it's like gated community in mexico
and  you can expect to see
like grandpa grandma
first Airbnb we went to it was like his
grandpa owned the house and then It was
separated by bedrooms for all the family
members and then everybody that rents
from them there's like two building like
uncle Aunt Tito Tita all right this one
Festive People...  both
Mexicans and the Filipinos they love to
party yeah they love to party but I feel
like Mexican
are a little bit hardcore ...
especially being in Mexico City actually
when it comes to business a lot of deals a
lot of business transaction and things
go like complete when you are drinking
and sipping tequila
together I can believe that well but
anyway in both country is like if you
are a kind of person that love to party
you will not regret no there's some
points in time we're like we would wake
up in the morning at 5 a.m. to start
work and like they would just be
finishing up and getting ready to go out
and have street tacos yeah it's pretty
crazy but in the Philippines it's the
same way just I feel like it's not as
hardcore because they still love to sing
they still love the dance they still
love it actually it's from that karaoke
of course you land in the Philippines
and the first thing you get is a red
horse welcome back to the Philippines
and you hear karaoke in Mexico they have
they start dinner really late and
they start party really late around like
11 p.m. which in Philippines
Filipino are not like that.. They
party earlier yeah the party earlier
from what I notice is
that like even though your neighbor party
really hard and singing nobody gonna
complain no they are used to it yeah
it's like if you have a neighbor they're
gonna party I really I think in America
the cops will be called oh yeah second
there's like loud music coming from the
house next door
call the cops in South Korea as well and
in China too but like in Mexico we
experienced this several nights in a row
our landlord which is our apartment in
it it didn't really complain we didn't
do anything I think that they perceive it as
the way of John we said the one time she
threw something like that in Philippines
I realize people sing more especially
I'll get okay
yes in Mexico I realize that people
actually dance more whether it be in the
tackle shop oh it's everywhere
I'm missing mariachi that's duck da they
dance everywhere yeah so that leads to
the next thing I feel like people in
both countries they are not trying to
perform something yeah I don't do
karaoke so but this one
a classic example you receive and you
ask for the direction in Mexico and in
Philippines
people are not gonna say that no I don't
know where it is and walk away they're
gonna try and ask somebody else for you
like especially if you don't speak the
language in Mexico like  if
you don't speak Spanish at all they will
ask somebody in Spanish for you like how
do you get here show them your phone
trying to help you they'll literally hop
on a motorbike and drive you to the
waterfall that is what we experience so
that they incredibly go out of their way
to let walk you to a place and show you
how to get there yeah so it could be
either first of all they would
just look up from Google Map
trying to find the answer for you or
secondly, they will just like take your
there. or thirdly they will ask somebody there, ask somebody else and then give you the answer so there's no way
that you don't know how to get there. There is no way that you get lost especially when
you ask for the direction I think
they're really willing to help oh this
is really really obvious difference even
though there are so many things that
Mexican is similar to Filipinos but in
terms of PDA public display of affection
there's a big difference so I don't know
it was like really shocking to us that
when we were walking through Chpulthepec when we were
walking through that park like there was
people like straight up almost
getting it on in the park like making
out hardcore in the middle of the park
where in like the Philippines you won't
really see that  unless you go
to the red light district but you're
just gonna see you know maybe hugging
maybe kissing but Mexico they have a
strong PDA like they don't really mind
PDA they're not shy let's say that
yeah I think they are not shy to show
the love. LOVE IS  beautiful thing
in Mexico you can kiss your heart out
and the way they greet each other...
this is one thing that I
made a mistake when I met our Airbnb
host for the first night hug and
then they kick ass cheek and I don't
know what to do you like I'm not used to
it huh next next thing this is something
that we heard we never experienced this
but we have that a lot about this issue
we've heard it in the Philippines and in
Mexico yeah actually yeah they basically
call it like marrying up is what we
heard about in Mexico marrying up too but
sometimes it's not just in the aspect
of marry but it's like the way that they
classify the group of people if you're
marrying or dating somebody on a lighter
skin tone
you're basically leveling yourself up in
the social world I should say in Mexico
I don't know we never experienced
something like this by ourself but just
from what we heard people has lighter
skin people who look white is upper
class and then the lower classes people
who is kinda like tan and things but in
Philippines from what we heard is
about the language barrier so if you
very good English yeah so they JUDGE
the upper class or lower class by the
way that you can't speak the language
but now again this is a very iffy
subject and it's not like something we
think it's something we've heard yeah in
Thailand is it is something that is
there like it's donek does exist and we
have heard it in Mexico and the
Philippines as well now if you have
heard anything about this please feel
free to let us know in the comments let
us know what you think of this it's like
some people might not think like this
I don't but this is
something that exists and I want to
speak about this because also I feel it
as well for example in Thailand
Alright, next topic is about food and the reason why we need to talk about food of
course is because food is part of the
culture in both country there's a high
consumption of rice yes but in the
Philippines it's way more surprisingly
there isn't as much consumption of rice
as I expected there to be in Mexico oh
yeah I expected them to eat a lot more
rice like burritos with very soon side
dishes with rice in it you can get rice
but it's not as common as I expected it
to be is this something that you will
see in every restaurant the policeman
yes in Mexico you will see more tortilla
and tacos and tequila tequila taco
Mexico you hungover saying
Dorji like oh it's like that voice
then they have like something called Chi
diet because they're like taco tamales
but the thought oh there's so many T so
many T so anyway yeah sometime you will
see the store can si the store that
people make tortilla they make that it's
like a tortilla factory okay but it's
like just one machine and they throw
don't and corn there's so many kind of
food involving tortilla where is in the
Philippines it's mainly just rice and it
just use a side dish of rice and then
they give you your needs and your main
course it's a small like southeastern
Asian country but if you don't also love
fast food like burgers and things so
instead of seeing tortilla things in
balloons you will see more burger stall
which is more like the family-run
business as well in French it's so she
then associate to is starting from like
30 pesos yeah they call pay so that is
another fun fact both Mexican and
Filipino they called the currency
patient is Filipino peso and there's
Mexican peso one thing for sure in terms
of spiciness and give it to Mexico but
in in Philippines the side dish of spice
it come into mother French pepper like
the Frenchman chili but in Mexico you
receive more of the salsa yes absolutely
that gives you the spiciness and also
cilantro and lime Mexican lives line the
calamari and calamansi for Filipino like
for example about here on the stick you
see in both country in Mexican for
Mexico it's way bigger but I feel like
it's more like yeah it's more like
American sized we're in the Philippines
it's more Asian Cizek the portions are
smaller so they say they have this thing
called you know Filipino time
Mexican time Oh Mexican time good thing
so they're basically referring to them
taking their time to either go places to
get food eat things like that but we've
noticed that it's like Filipino times
like extra for example if you go to the
bank in Mexico you see such a long line
or light when you go to crochet and we
have to be in a long line and we're not
around I feel like people are ok with it
like nobody complained nobody showed a
sign up because they used to yeah nobody
showed a sign of dissatisfaction it
seems to be the type of person that has
the great amount of passion when they
have to wait for something so for
example when we were in Mexico we
actually have appointment to go to the
night market with a bunch of Mexican and
the appointment is what like seven
o'clock we were supposed to leave at
seven o'clock we didn't leave till 8:00
so we were in like quite a rush to try
and get there by seven o'clock and we
got there and they're like pass around
shots in the skull yeah and they weren't
in any rush which is okay we're on their
time yeah yeah so during the meantime up
waiting as we said earlier Mexican love
party so they were drinking drinking
beer miss kau tequila Tom waiting Thomas
like tequila or walking around the towns
and the cities both in the Philippines
and in Mexico you would get such a warm
feeling from all the locals yeah some
one they're cooking and getting
breakfast ready for everybody but
they're like saying hi to you and you're
walking by they say hi for you
wanting to ask how are you isn't this
like a lot and it's nothing but it's
more like then they're trying to
interact with you like in Mexico it's a
little bit different because not as many
people speak English as frequently as
they do like in the Philippines it's a
second language but like they're still
trying so hard to like have a
conversation but if you can speak
Spanish in Mexico
I think it's game over however this one
actually some people comment in other
Mexico travel in los and say that they
realize that Mexican smile on and that
is true in Philippine as well as my a
lot to the apperance like interestingly
if you look at the bandage scenery to
give a definition to Filipino as the
Mexican aphasia yes because Mexican of
the East even move it I believe it has a
lot to do with Spain and like expanding
colonize colonize New Mexico and the
Philippines as well even um some people
comment in a world video and say that I
look about alike Filipina and Mexican
Laura our friend in Mexico and she's
from America basically she's from New
York she was mistaken all the time as a
Mexican and I was mistaken all the time
as Mexican to I and her as you see look
totally different
she's from America so meaning in Mexico
yeah you can definitely see like some
people in Mexico they look just like you
know
you know European like white light I was
like Asia I look like the Citizen of
Mexico yeah guys so that's all based on
our thoughts our perception our a sprint
we just want to give you guys the
general idea on what to expect as we see
the difference and similarities are in
different types yeah things because you
know you never know traveling like if
you'd always we've always traveled Asia
so for us to travel Mexico was
completely different than anything we
were used to neither of us had been to a
spanish-speaking country especially
Mexico you know and it's beautiful it
Mexico and it's beautiful in the
Philippines we hope you guys like the
video and we hope it's helpful to you in
some way if you guys did like the video
