 "... me up early in the morning early in the morning. Say hello buddy. Hello. Hello. no Morning 11, 44 Am, Fod December, Saturday Sunday, morning, Seam. Everyone has back from church. Hiya. to San Antonio to the property. Got to pick up the chair and meet the brother Jay, family and JC and I, Jocelyn already went there. We're gonna go to spend a few hours at the beach. Our target is to put in a duck at beach, but we'll see where it takes us. I got Mr. E.J. sent me, still wrestling with his seatbelt. Hi. There he is. It's kind of hard to drive and do this. Lady Jazz has a little bit and Sabrina's helping her in the back. And we're going through the capital of Sink, my house, or something, little white. It's the both things you seek people with sometimes here, but we'll add on to it. This is just our journey. Getting ready to go left up here. Um, see where today takes us. Alrighty then. Let's just follow through to the curb. Follow in the bus right now. Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun. They owe the Sink Mons. There they are. They sell them there. Okay, I'm coming Mitsubishi. Scooted the lady. I'm coming. I'm coming. They got to understand this is the main road. I'm on. They have to give way yield. We have to stop coming on to it, but sometimes they forget daily life here. Alrighty. Until we get there. To the looper. To the land to the land to the land. Here we go. One of these days, I'll get this smoothed out a little bit more. Here's here. Well, did that somebody clear it? Missly this side. Okay. Well, good. Maybe somebody finally for the whole time we've been here, cleared it on the right side. Now I have to look at it on the way back. Because they had cleared over here too. See that over here? That used to be all. Fueled in full of debris and bushes and all that mess. We're sneaking back. Here's the roadway we got to fix for the new subscribers. But in due time. In due time. Looks nice now. That's why it even though it's skimcoed. Yes. Looks nice. Yes. Yes. Almost over in my head. Okay. Oh, he's smiling. Oh, yeah. He's going on. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's going on. Yeah, we hit the bumps and he's in the back. Whoopsie back with mama. Here's the cubo. Here's the bridge covert. Yeah. There's none. Lita. All right. Okay. We're over here in San Antonio now. We're on the on the way to pull the duck at. Boom. Nucket beach. That's about the J up ahead in the tricycle with the red cooler. So we're just following. Dillard is gently behind. Night Jocelyn's in the back. By all J.C. is riding the scooter. There's Jay and his crew. Thank you, Po. Appreciate it. I forgot. I forgot. He's straight but let us know we can send me the right. Yes. Okay. We've been here one time. So I think we came here twice, babe. I don't think we stayed the second time. We're just making our way back here. These are the roads and the back way. It's a Sunday so I'm not sure if this was the best idea to come on with Sunday. Because I'm thinking that maybe challenging to find a parking space with a truck. Yes, Koiya. Thank you for slowing down and looking. There we go. There we go. This is the way we matriculate and fill things. And if you fill football fans and know what I'm talking about, who has the right of way, we don't know. It's a four-way. And with no signs, no yield signs, no stop signs. So we all just drive. And we always have to be careful. That happens a lot here, folks. There's a ladder with no man. So yeah, because a lot of these roads, there's no signs. And some people drive and some people come flying through their own scooters and tricycles and cars. And everyone thinks they have the right of way because they are who they are. And it's just, it's always have to be on the lookout, always. We're approaching this here and there used to be an old bridge here. I don't know if it's still there, but they built a new bridge, which I'm glad. I don't know if the old bridge is still around. I don't know if they tore it down. We'll find out when it's certain of later. It was only like one vehicle could go across, whether you were a car or a tricycle or whatnot. Was it here? It was somewhere. Maybe it's up here. We can see a little bit better. Maybe it's still on one of the sides. I don't know. Yeah, I think it was there. I think it was a little right. We're going to find out here in a moment. And you show you the stop and wait. Yeah, there it was. There it is down there. You see it. That was when I was here in 2018, that's what we used. I can't see it very well here. That's how we got over. You can't really see it. Sorry about that. But it was just like one vehicle. Now they have this here. This is fairly recent, even though you can't tell by the looks of it. There we have over there. Sorry, I'm trying to drive and do this as well. Lady Jazz has a little bit in the back. By the thought I could have swapped them and put it up front. And she could have helped the video. I didn't think about that. You can't really see it. Sorry. I had to move it over there. Let's just see where we go here. Anyway, this is the back way. Well, this is the only way that I know of to go to conduct it. Be each and also. Monty's river resorts back here. And it's maybe one or two other places here. Just taking them home for the ride. You can speed through it if you want to. But... Taking up anything I don't need to follow in the whole room. Riverside, that's what the sign said. Stone here, a farm resort. This is more tells. River Pool Resort. Never been there. Maybe somebody checked out. Right there. I'm sure a lot of these mountain palm places will be opening back up. Now that the so-called pandemic is behind us. If you're following local news, you're going to see just how frivolous it all was. Just open your eyes, folks. Yep, it was there. Yes, I lost some folks. But they had underlying issues along with it. So it was just like some of the other things. But it's not the here and the there. Stone here, a farm resort. If you're saying Antonio is an ambulance. Here we go. We're still just... Just this is not way through. Okay. Let's just see. Just keep it going. Like I said, you can speak through it if you want to. If you're not here, we'll take you along with a little fruit sandwich. A mango's there. A sharp curvehead. It's really a nice day. It's not super hot. You're made of these very low. I say that because I haven't gotten back out into the sun yet. When we got in the vehicle, the sun was behind some clouds. It was cool. But usually the December weather is pretty good over here. I haven't been over here in this time of year and 40 years. 1980. No, what even in 1983? I was on a ship in 1983 even though I was stationing. So it was 1982. The last time I was in the Philippines actually laying on the soil in December. So there you go, 40 years ago. I'm still a young man. I'm a old man, my old heart. But why kids are glimpse in the mirror and I get this shock in my life. I'm like, whoa, where has the time gone? So anyway, hard focus. This is all you get when I'm trying to focus on driving and everything else. Vigil and trying to narrow it. Just roll it that along. It's not far from our place but it's just, you have to go this slow. It just goes to the traffic. The roads narrowed and they widened and they get rough and whatnot. It's nice here. Philippines is not for everyone. But if it is for you, it's the place to be. It's the place to be. You've got to have a certain kind of mentality, certain kind of spirituality, certain, be emotionally stable, mentally alert, focused, relaxed, very, very relaxed. If you're a tense person, this is not the place for you. Because you need patient school or just not the USA. It's not Australia. It's not the United Kingdom. It's not anywhere but the Philippines. It's kind of nice to see my side. My trial signal out being used. I need to, once I get on the land, I need to get on it some more and practice some more. Because it is a bit different. You've got that side card to think about. It is a bit different. The tricky leap. The tricky leap in yourself down the highway. Oh look, we got some. We got a, what do you call those things? I forget. I have to lower my foot. Strikes. Look at there. I'm surprised. That wasn't here last time we came here. A little checkered mark soon down the highway. I had a way hostile. What is this? What is this over there? I don't know. Another resort or some sort? Beer garden. Salt beer garden. Me, bar and grill. Car wash. Oh to the left is the car wash. See you soon. The famous car wash. Another local drinking establishment. I shall visit what we're over here. Here we go. I'll be better. I just meet my voice and put music on. Welcome. Welcome to the river. Really? Govick highway again. This whole place is, yeah I noticed that. It's a, every way you go there is a govick. It's confusing because if you go to San Narcissia, there's govick highway. Yeah you got to say govick San Narcissia, govick San Antonio, govick Pronducke, govick Castile. But if you go up here, you know that. It's a second nature. Buffalo never came over here. Buffalo was down in the whole way. Oh Bob, Bob, yeah Bob. We still haven't passed this place. Buffalo was my native buddy. He passed away a year ago, 2021 in June. Larry Barnett, aka Buffalo. He's laying a grass down in the hole. Later jazz and I visited him back in May. His place of rest there. There were a few candles for him. Barangay Ponducke. San Antonio Zambalas. Okay, so I'm going to stop it here soon because you see the road deteriorates. And then I got to pay attention to where I got to get some parking soon. I'm going to let it go for a little while longer. I can go ahead and let it steal, I guess. Not sure what they're putting here. Wave song resort. Straight ahead. Marahu Yo-Kov. Island Hoppers. Nice man. That's kind of what I need. Okay, oh, we got some cement road. Okay, pay road coming back. I don't know what's that wave song. I don't know, I think it's just name of a place that was here probably. Either he is or current or passed. Longer's convenience store. Norse Beach Resort. Now Harden Resort. The Hard Jump Up Point. A little resort here next to each other. Can it be resort? This is all for the locals here. Like I said, you got to have a heart for the Philippines. Appreciate this over here. And if you're looking for some fancy. Immaculately cleaned, well-kept, resorted stuff. That's not the Philippines. Not here. Let's put it that way. This is for the tough folks. Okay, what's the fellas? Because they're not watching me. What's the eatabities? Keep on going. Yeah, it's getting closer. We're getting close because it's getting more narrow and it's going to be more challenging to park. So I'm going to have to do a drop off and then come back and get everybody. I'll walk back to the airport. We'll figure it out. So somehow another I passed my buddy Bob's place and didn't recognize it. It lives about a hundred yards in the beach. That business has been here. I got to make a point to go see him. It's crazy. And I've seen him a few times once in the car wash. I saw him downtown walking somewhere at one time and another time so another place I forget. We're running each other again. Stomper. Let's see here. Yeah, we got behind this guy here. Oh, watch out. We got to squeeze through folks. I know. Oh, brother Jay, don't turn around. I can't turn around like you do, brother. Oh, parking with pay. All right, let me stop here. Okay, as you can see, we made it. There's not Jocelyn there in the blue waiting in the water here. I'm not sure about the cleanliness of that, but this guy seems to be doing something. I don't know if he's picking up garbage. Just a little bit. I don't know. There's a man and Jocelyn women. Lady Jazz and I told Sabrina and DJ not to swim there. But then Nina got in the water. So we got some explaining to do there so they understand. They're over there with Tito's and friends. And DJ there with a stick on the other side there. So we got some adult supervision over there on the other side with them. Lady Jazz and baby Sky is here. He's enjoying the fresh ocean air. Like clothes on, we changed him out of that. He had like a body suit on. He was sweat and so now he's got license. A little bit here. We're just keeping him off everything. Keeping him covered up when we're near the sun. He's checking everything out. It's fine when my children in the States were young. We took them out after two to three weeks outside. You just don't take them to certain places. You know, obviously not out in sunlight. So he's looking up. You get that snows going. There's Sister Cell and there's Jason Kim. He's a hero. So Brother Jay's wife and son. There's James. Nope, not so James. There's James. James is here with us but there's girlfriend. So he's out there somewhere. I think he's the adult supervision we have. So this is Punducket. We got the barcabots out. Very people here around the corner of the cold. I'd like to find out how much it is just to run a bottle of oak for the day. Just howling hopper. Trying out the different beaches just going around the corner and just spinning the day or half the day. Whatever. Get somebody to ask me if I am when he comes back and ask them. I know if I ask, he's going to triple the price. I've been here long enough. Years, 40 years ago, in the same way. It's like when you go to Mexico. You go south of San Diego and Tijuana and Brownsville and the Mexico. You know, they see you coming. Triple the price. That's on the stage too. Everywhere we go. Why? It's like. There's land waving to everybody. It's taking a little video here. EJ, he's scared of the waters and he won't go in. He'll just sit there and run back and forth. So bring us the one that we have some adult supervision for. We should jump in there and try to swim out to the barcabots if you'd like. This is our day at the beach. Punducket. Some ballas. And San Antonio's in ballas. So. I'm sitting here in the shade. My long white pants on and my long sleeve shirts. I'm a German Irish white boy. Dalianos as well. I burn. Where does that guy's hat? Balls off. So I stay out. I learn to stay out. Stay the shade. I have not been in the ocean since. Trying to remember the last time I got into swim. Hawaii. In the whole time, the 26 years I was in San Diego, California, I did not venture into the ocean. I took my kids there. I sat on the beach and watched the play by the go in there. You start my thing. When you're a sailor and you spend 20 years in the Navy, you see enough ocean. It's water's water. But everybody enjoys it so we go to the beach and everybody have fun. Three weeks for post-partum. Three weeks, yeah. Three weeks, yeah, this is Sarian. Three weeks ago tomorrow. There's a little bit. Skyloon, La Rock. Skyloon, La Rock. La Rock, La Rock, I... La Rock. That's my father's first name. He's nickname was Rock. Short. La Rock, I Rock. So I put the two together. I dropped the K. I dropped 20. I put La Rock. It's mad. It's mad. It's mad. The first name is Skyloon. Karata. Okay, we'll stop here until I have some other footage to show you. It's a nice beach. Everybody's out. Joining is gone out today. Don't let that sound to see me. We'll find you. Brother JC and brother Jay want to get them some beers. I said, I pass. Not when I'm driving the fam. When I get home, different story. I'm sure they'll make their way back around here. All right. Somebody's getting the video on there with my mother or a picture. I never get in those anymore. She actually when he's sleeping with us now, she'll put him on the other side. He's closer to the wall, not in the middle. So I tease her. I said, I'm trying to keep my son away from me. She goes, no, you should be. I'm pretty just question. I said, I've been through four children on my own, my grandson. I know how to, not roll over on the sound. There they are. JC in the blue shirt. Jay's in shirtless. Coming back with a couple of bruski's they're going to enjoy what they're sitting here. It's all James' there, James' there, and his girl from the house bill. I got a photo taken. All right. There's Jay. There's JC. I see a red horse. I see a sandman like that. Baby sky. It is afternoon meal for mama. Everyone's moved over here. Later, Jazz finally said that their mother went out and checked the water. So it's okay. It's kind of the swimmer. So that's the kids, and that's EJ, sister Jazz and the white horse. Lynn, he's Jason Kim. He's in the blue shirt after with his daddy. There's the bring on his back. Jay, Jay. So everybody's coming out and jumping in and having fun. It's safe of you anyway right there. Bill and Ken out earlier and did a bit more cleaning over. Kind of jumping up some of this stuff that comes out with the creek and picking up the garbage and hauling the arms. So that's good. It makes its way in here, but it's a good area for the kids to play. And this right here in front of the cottage, we've rented here. So cottage is a little kubo thing here. 500 pesos here. I'm not sure if that's the going rate. That's what the parents, and it's okay. He keeps that body out of the sun. And they've got some lumpy air they've bought some positive, and my coat. My payouts will do just a couple of red horses. But there he is. Woo-ha! I don't want to drink because I'm busy, but it's gone. You can drink the water along. Yeah, but your brother, he says, wow, quick. But it's not a whole thing. Better to do the... Oh, good. Do you want to drink? No, no, no. There's another porno over there, the blue shirt. Pouring down towards the water. That's the place here. Sorry, sorry, I'm still here, but the guys have to go over there somewhere to get the survey set. I'm going to send one of my ass, one of my brothers, to go over and find out how much it is to rent a market boat for the day. Maybe I'll get the local price when I'm going to price. We'll see. Come out here one day when it's still cool. Well, once baby Skye gets open up to do it, then we'll go on a boat ride. We'll see. It's nice out here. It's not really that hot, as long as you stay in the shade. Alright, I'll let the family out there have fun. They're taking photos now. Hopefully the camera's warm. Want to move a look at Jojo. She's like in there, swimming. Look at that. They need you. He won't, that's about as far as you'll go. Ask his mom if he ever had a traumatic experience with the water. She says no. He's just awkward, scared. Is it okay? Well, whenever one of these days, maybe I'll decide to get the water with him. Easy man to it and get him to work. He's okay and comfortable with it and get him to learn how to swim. That's all it is just getting in there. Oh, and then they could chase him. That's why Nena's got to watch him. Oh. See, he's brave. He's going out there. He's like, yeah, we got a little 2D head under. Submerged. This is dead enough. Alright, I have more later. We got a lot of vendors coming around. Two seven things. They came from upstream. Pretty sure they're going to pick it up and take it to the water. Doze. There we go. There we go. There's another super-near guy there. Going in to the left. Take a break. We're going to do a beachy. They're going to take it to the water. Turn around. And there we go. There we go. That's it. I thought they were going to take it to the ocean but it looks like no. Give it a moment. I think they're going to take it to the ocean. The man's trying to push it himself. Let's see. Oh, I got this land up right because the screen's dark. It's hard to see. And there they go. Into the water. Okay, she's wondering. Baby skies are unhappy. Mom, I got them again. It's kind of hard. It's a hard surface. So I don't blame him. I don't blame him. Okay, guys. It's 3.39 pm. We're done for the day at Pum Duckett. We're loading everybody up. We made our payments for the Kubo. How much the Kubo cost? 500 pesos. 500 pesos. We're worth it for three hours. Keep everybody in the shade while everybody else was swimming. How much for the parking? 160 pesos. 100 pesos for the truck. 100 pesos for the truck. What about that? 20 pesos for the truck that can scooters. Okay. When we came in, it was 50 pesos. You know who stepped out of the truck and they go, oh! Yeah, I was like, what happened to the 50 pesos? No, it's 100. It's okay. Buhay go nito. You know? Tamako? Oh, it's still hot. Okay, folks. We're going to head on out. Ciao, baby.
