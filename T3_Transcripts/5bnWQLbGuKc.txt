Let us know what else we should check out from the Philippines and the comments below. Yeah. This video was sent to us on Instagram, Instagram DM. If you want to follow us on Instagram, we post all of our travel pictures on there and stuff. I know, yeah. Shoot us a DM if they're doing any videos you want us to get to. Yeah, anyways, let's do this food. This is insane. Hey. Today we are on Sebu Island in the Philippines. Now, Sebu is famous for its parking zone. And if I'm going to try a lechon, I want to try the best. And that's why we are at Rico's lechon facility. Rico. Where they're preparing 2,000 to 4,000 pigs each month. And I'm lucky enough to be standing next to the man. It's like a pig massacre. Thank you very much for having me. Basically, I want to see the whole process from beginning to eating it. And the first thing you do is stop the pig. Yes. First, we put spring onions inside. We're putting a little green onion even into the neck cavity. Basically, anywhere there's space inside, we want to stuff it full of delicious flavors that are going to permeate into the meat. So here we have crushed garlic. Oh, that's awesome. Put the inside. It's not bad. I'm the first one who will discover the first spicy leeks one in the Philippines. So of all the people making lechon, nobody thought to put some chilies inside. Now. So you're the first one to put these chilies inside the lechon. Yes. Wow. There's a lot of peppers. This pig is definitely going to have heartburn after this. Oh, no. So salt. OK. Let me know if you want me to help. I can put my hands in a pig too. OK. OK. OK. OK. All right. Cool. I feel like this is like Martha Stewart. I think this is all for the spices inside. So now we have our sewing kit. This is a big needle. Let's see the master at work. It's probably good practice for a nurse or something. If you had a nurse and she's like, well, what's your experience? Well, I worked at Riko's for about five years. I sewed up all the pigs. That would work for me. I can never be a seamstress. This is not straight. Then we're going to kind of cross-brated. I'm going to make sure it's like white cloth. That's so much. It's going to be so thick. Oh, my God. I feel like I'm in a battlefield in World War II. You're going to make it. I'm almost done. I have not stabbed myself yet. I'm sorry. There's any pig lovers watching this video. I'm also a pig lover, but for a different reason. Bam. The end. What is the next step? Gullowing. Is it a coloring? Yes. I thought that was a Coca-Cola. Soy sauce. Soy sauce. Oh, soy sauce. OK. Soy sauce. Soy sauce. They have the candles out there. Just keep the ambiance. You put your hand in some soy sauce. And you just kind of just kind of misogies. Like it's your girlfriend. Hey. The ambiance. Do you have a long day at work? Bam. Soy sauce, ladies, is great for your skin, by the way. If you want your skin to be delicious and crispy, ladies, try some soy sauce. Take a note. Roll over. Yes. Good pick. Are you afraid we're showing your secret recipe? Are you afraid of that? No, no, no. Just a fast. OK. The only thing we don't eat is the oink. We're going to cook this. One, two, three. It's all right. I lift weights. You're going to show me how it's done here. So what are the spices like? How much flavor are you getting from this? Gochon. So just on a rotisserie. Just so good. I need to do this. Do you want to do this? One hour and 40 minutes. One hour and 40 minutes? Yes. Oh. So you used to make it this way when you were young. Yes. We are using now machine. But obviously, this is the old style of doing the rotisserie. This place, they're putting out so many pigs, so much of the chon each day that they don't do it this way. They have machines, which we're going to go see in a second. So long. At least they have the umbrella. We saw how they used to do it. And we're going to see how they do it now. Oh my gosh. This is insane. T-O-S-O-S. So they've got the machines here. These skewers are different. They're obviously steel skewers, so they can just clean them and reuse them every time. And they've got them attached to this machine, rotating them at the precise speed. This is between 100 and a bajillion degrees. The skin is turning brown. And you can actually hear it crackling as they turn, by the way. To the vegetarians, thanks for your patience in this video. There's something interesting that happens, because when we go from the raw white pig, it is a little disconcerting. It's a little strange looking. And this is where the pigs start to look like actual food. The pig is like this perfectly designed vessel to be roasted and cooked in its own juices. The skin keeps everything in. What a life, great. The fat adds moisture. And then it's just adding and sending all that flavor to the protein. So every layer of the meat is delicious. Whether it's like meat, meat, fat, or an ear. OK, look. We don't want the lechon getting dirty. Sometimes you've got a mop and mop a little bit. Rico, my man, I notice he's mopping the pig. Is that a sauce mop? Yeah. It's a sauce mop? Yes, like the other one. Like soy sauce? Yeah. Wow. The same. That's how insane this level of production is. That's how insane this level of production is. Yeah, it's a little gosh. It's got so much flavor. From here, going to the restaurant. Just going right to the restaurant, and it's ready to eat. It's always up, putting to me, when places that eat, like, pigs, like a farm to your restaurant, their logo is just like a happy alive pig. Yeah, he's just chilling. Oh, look at me holding some chilies. Those chilies are going to be inside my dead stomach. Yeah, they murdered me. And then they stuck me on that steak. Wow, what's going on here? What are we doing now? We're going to like a portioning of the lechon. We're in our chopper. We'll cut it first. She will do the feet. Do you have to be strong? She just falls off to the door. She'll all take out of there. Oh my god. The skin, it just comes right off. One, she makes how many portions there? Yeah. She's just chilling for people. Around 28 kilos. 28 kilos? 26 to 28 kilos. So that for me, that would be lunch and dinner. I'll put this head, and then right off. It's some of the best meat. That's what I always say. That's where we get also for the sea sea. That's mean like special ingredient of sea sea is the head part. The head part. Oh, good, good. You guys have sea sea here? Yes. Can I try it? Yeah, I'm going to try it. Definitely. And then I can pour stuff through it. Hi there. Hello. First of all, thank you for the hat. I saw the chef like a master, like a virtual host of the sea. He's fantastic. He took Red bell pepper, green pepper, onion, oyster sauce, extra special seasonings, and then real chunks of pig face. Pig face. Maybe there's some nose, there could be some cheek, there could be a little forehead, cheek. All together. And here. Yeah. Do not forget the ears. Honestly, I've never seen something that looks brown. It's not just because it's 3pm and I haven't eaten yet today. They brought me a bowl. Can I have it? I've never eaten it off a ear. Yeah. This was cute. This was cute. But I'm just going to eat it right off the hot pan. Oh, and then before plating melted some butter down this hot plate and then just dumped everything on top. Oh. A lot of people in the US think that maybe eating the pig face is strange, except for they also eat hot dogs. I believe this is my first time having the C.C. in the Philippines. Plenty of meat on there. There's the crispy skin. Voila. I could go right there. There's making me emotional. All these chefs, I don't want to cry in front of the chefs. The meat is roasted so perfectly. With a little extra butter, I like the extra butter. This is one of the best things I've ever eaten. Really? Wow. This was absolutely amazing. I'm going to start eating so the camera guy can try some and now we're going to try it on the plate. One of the best things ever eaten. Okay, right now this place is easy and a lot of things. What was it? Rico. Rico's in Cebu and then we can see the pig logo. Yeah. The real cats in. They're going to kill that dog. Colleen Judd, the Nelly Chong. Stop them. How to rotissarize them. How to cut them into little pieces. And now the reason we are here, the king of Cebu, Rico's Lechon with Rico himself. Are you ready? Perfect. So we have this beautiful little tita rice. Yeah. Scoop some on the plate. Yeah. We're going to make our sauce. We're going to put in some vinegar and some soy sauce. And you're going to squeeze the calamansi in there. Like that? Is it good? Yes. Yes. As good as Filipino? Yes. Thank you. So I've been looking at the skin all day. Hearing it crackle when it was on the rotissarine and I saw this nice woman cut it over here. She was hacking it into little pieces. Pig skin has never looked so delicious. Let's try it on. Oh my. So unbelievably crunchy. Hold on. Let's have another bite. Crunch game. Cheese. They're like when I crunch into the mic. So then they can hear it. Out there. I'm sorry. It really is. It's like I don't care. Some of the Lechon's so tender. I put the meat in here. Yeah. And then just eat some rice with my hands. I like it. All right. Oh, this is so soft. So soft. So fatty. It's good. Oh my God. That's incredible. Super juicy. It's soft. It has a ton of flavor to it. Then you put the vinegar on there too already. It adds a different kind of pop to it. And a little bit of freshness with the calamansi. With that citrus. Unbelievable. Nice big hunk of meat. This is the spicy Lechon, which was essentially invented by this man right here. I was thinking the chili is inside of the pig. Yeah, that would be very interesting. Wait, by the way. It was like. Yeah. It was not like a whole chili or anything, but it's the chili juices. It's a fiesta in my mouth. This one is great. It's just a little bit spicy. It's not really spicy. It just adds a different kind of flavor to it. Mainly, that's really flavor. This is probably one of the best foods I've had in my life. Wow. And absolutely my favorite thing I've eaten in the Philippines so far. It goes beyond culture. It's a pig. So many cultures eat pig or eat pork I should say. And if done correctly, it transcends borders. Okay? We're bringing nations together today, guys. I'm going to end this video so I can eat without looking at a camera and trying to think I'm interesting things to say. If you find yourself in Sebu City, I promise you you will not be disappointed if you come here. The experience goes well beyond the food. The hospitality here is amazing. Just shooting with these people, they've been nothing short of generous helping us in every way possible. So I'd like to say thank you. I would shake your hand, but it's full of pig fat. So can we pound it? No. Okay, we still. All right. Pork fat, handshake. All right. Cheers. Thank you so much. I'm going to go to the market. I'm going to go to the market. I could go to the market. Eating around in Vietnam. I don't know if I want to do that. But that food that we just saw in this video. That looked tasty. I would definitely eat that. Mm-hmm. It was a seed. That looks so good. The shown was definitely interesting because that's like pig skin and skin is not something I have eaten much in my life. I don't think I've ever eaten it. Only on chicken legs really for me and then it's usually fried. So it's very, very different for me. But the sissin kind of looked like an Asian food that I've had a little bit. It was a little different because usually the Asian food that I have has sauce on it. That one did, it was more like different ingredients inside of it. It was like a fried rice type of, I don't know how to explain it, but it looked good. It looked a little more familiar than the dou wa chon. Mm-hmm. You have a dou wa chon. Still the meat. It probably would be so good. It looks super tender, super. It looks super juicy too. It's a bit of a different thing. It's very juicy. I never had a roasted pig like that. No. So it would be the way to try it right there. It would. We got to go to Sabu now. Yeah, I think it's the Sisi getting that. And the Lee Chon. At the murder pig place. Wait, I'm just off my way. Shove a stick. Shove a stick. Yeah, I mean more. Hope you guys enjoyed. If you did, subscribe. Like the video, more Filipino videos coming soon. See you the next one. Bye.
