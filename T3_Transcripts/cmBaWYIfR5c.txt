Christmas hey guys how's it going yet it's like two days before Christmas so million i decided today it's time for us to try the savory Filipino Christmas dishes that are traditionally eaten on Noji's food yeah not just green no charts no charts no charts I hope I got it right so we have an Instagram story and ask you guys what kind of dishes you usually eat for Christmas so we had a few recommendations and yeah we're going to try all of them today whoa so the first dish that we have here is the quesare bola umba dish then oh sorry no this is the umba we just switch the umba and this is the lengua is the is tovana i think it's the one very difficult one yeah that's so difficult for us aww aww some i made pizza yesterday we had some pizza no i was just making pizza cut just that we can eat with the cheese of course it has some garlic rice garlic rice as always it's for her protocol and what's that? slide that thing it's just like a like a like a few two oh someone telling us super hungry already we were waiting for this for it to come together we actually wanted to have one more dish which is more firm more more firm um but we couldn't get it anyway we tried but pizza did it everywhere together i think we'll start off the kills with the ball up because so many people was telling me that they love this kills with the ball up but first we got to figure out how to get it to the shoot aww yeah how do you do oh the ball card oh my god wow very tight in two ball corner practice what are they doing? it's like ice cream it's not so but it's not very familiar it smells like yeah goda yeah like a goda goda it's gonna peel this off a bit of white and yellow it's just a bit fresh i guess and they were selling so many of these at restaurants oh oh i just thought the one that seems to be the most popular first to get a peanut Christmas dish say a breeze wow how it tastes no what yeah it is it's like goda just a little bit of salty oh salty and it has more flavor and more premium it's like a it's like a mozzarella and a goda and a cheddar i had a baby wow wow this is a yeah i really like this temperament for it cheese oh temperament wow that's a nice temperament right on the next what is the next to be a team of things and goals for Christmas so this is the last thing to come what is this what the normal is these are telling like common goals if you know it's a little bit sweet but sweet that's a lot and yeah so we went to the supermarket and we had no idea what actually we should get so like if we had some people the supermarket helping us out those gave us some recommendations how to prepare the food wow this is our first time trying the ham on the border the one is the dish with border then it's fried so i'll fry it up to pieces between right fry this for the second one fry the country so yeah it has a lot like the Austrian and she just a little bit sweet only she which is honey honey honey honey honey honey honey it's really wow this one is nice very thinly usually so and it's like a daily thing this is something that like i'd say the the general Austrian does like what's a day yeah let me put it on bread with some cheese and just eat it as a yaw it's really nice so here's the fried piece wow just a little bit weird a little bit yeah it's weird i like this one maybe a little bit it's like caramelized yeah it's caramelized no weird and it's not it's not as juicy so please if you know just just eat it like this or you fry it or is it like a completely different dish that you can make with it or you just we're not going to finish those today we're still going to be eating the tomorrow sauce and then they all look tomorrow yeah just yeah as a guy see we are cheese people so we're going to master we know the what cheese and our wine cheeses clothing that's what the song of cheeses cheeses yeah chees wow these dishes are retriming so which are nice just because the other dishes are very hot so i want to start with a nice one nice one garlic and chili one oh it's chili one garlic and chili garlic and chili because it's full of cheese wow mmm mmm that's it these are very delicious it's got the right yeah it's so good it's so good you know what I think there's this one was very nice with the bread that you made or even just the garlic chili oil on the rice oh yeah it's so tasty oh yeah wow I don't know if you like this oh when the rice is good it's so tasty we make it tell that it's free of this free of this then we make our vlog how to cook this good they have good looks so tasty and so delicious and we never had before these nams and these dishes now i'll see like jabs it's like the more garlic the better if you agree give me the thumbs up yeah it's the best the best okay so we try next what's next yeah uh lingua is uh um one is um which is um um so i try cong with the fish and see it's kind of like great wow whoa that's delicious lingua is a big and and already perfect i saw this i saw it very delicious yeah joy jabs wow wow amazing there's a very nice view very nice yeah this is really amazing but it's really nice so it's very painful so very nice i'd use the knife and see it's better though it's because the knife doesn't has pain so what whatever they ask to be sitting and and and and most of the knives make lots of these wonderful bones this also one that's for the super monster we have a very open name is not so super monster monster this one and i think it's in japan and super monster is usually um sweet and slice and then a lot of bones a lot of onions and so very nice so it's a very similar sauce and it's like useful yeah that is the looks like crazy guys the kids are this wow he really like this he's also that we didn't eat that much today because we have made i was together this food that is yeah that's a next next wow next stage which is the bottom okay kuma yeah next kuma next water okay it has all the kind it has tomatoes olives olives sash has a unsy Spanish and all the things in friends jails very tender it's a can be chamonero and a gravy almost like a stew like a british stew almost that's like he'll then so I think you're fine maybe it just could cold
