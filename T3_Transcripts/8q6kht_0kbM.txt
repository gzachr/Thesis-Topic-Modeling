 Good morning guys from the Gipte in Mandelando, Kratkis. Hungarian ladies experts of riding the gym. Welcome back to Molof Asia guys, good morning. We always stop by here every time we bring our visitors to the airport. Yes, because it's cold in San Marians, lots of day in the Philippines. It's actually also cold in Berder. So be sure to have a good day in the comments guys. And their flight is already leaving like after noon so this is the like Jonathan said the fix. Stop. Stop. Every time someone is going to the airport of course Molof Asia. I never said. Another must stop whenever we are in Molof Asia is Ikea. We mostly came here for the baggage counter but of course looking around all the things we already here and going found her crowd. Yeah. The dinosaurs. The biggest Ikea in the world world here in Molof Asia feels everyone. Everyone will enjoy every time we are here. Oh that's so cute too. Like Pixar because it's a small house. Yeah people actually say Pixar is a small house so this is pixel also. She found her perfect pasalubon. Oh that's such a piece of shit. Stop at shop please. You just have to get an airy and alive. Like a boob boob. Perfect. When we will have kids they will love it. No it's like this. Like wait. The story is getting real. The rocket went to space the astronaut went out and so I'm in there. And there's another one that you slasped. I'm glad everyone found something they like in Ikea. I like this. No you are the puppet. You can bring that under plane just as a hat. She will be like what it's a fashion choice. Yes. That was what I imagined. I love how all of our visitors point out different things like impressed by different things in Molof Asia for fun. It was all the international brands for Korean and Marianne is the existence of a whole carousel inside of the Molo. Molof Asia is very beautiful. Yes. Very beautiful. Beyond the sea. I think Molof Asia is the best representation of like how modern and beautiful a Manila can be. I'm in Molof Asia. Morning, Paul. Now we are in Kuala Tura which is the best. Like local shop to get all the local products and I will just pick up some from a pasalou, one for my parents that Korean can bring home. Wow. Milk chocolate adobo. I'm showing them what the strange things we discovered here before never tried it. But milk chocolate with adobo. And I first saw it. I was like there's no way that it's actually adobo flavor. But in the ingredients it has soy sauce and black pepper. So there's me and see pojigu and adobo. And again. Next up. It is and you must, since follow f exemplo.

I don't know We are feeling the Christmasfront I want to go without you I like food court resembles the first time I'm here with fondly so crowded because it's a holiday today we can't so look at this crowd and the caurine picking which one to get from the cake that is all the same no not all the same no actually there's Christmas song and Christmas decoration every time this mid-boil and veggie mid-boil and mashed potatoes so Christmas it to me even though cake and the mashed from supery Christmas birthday Christmas good bye lunch let's go to the river the chernanita is also a good land and I'll go by this they are changing to go to the airport the the important green piece not as much as got beaten to the back quickly tarali I'm can see some special rolling set there's one more month to the student to make it pass the lubong of my parents this is what my parents are getting they are getting some local imid Christmas decoration and some work a shot bag organizing on the beginning of this trip we were wondering how they will fit everything to go home since they brought just a backpack I can see all the crux that was shoved on the first day are hanging on the outside the upper one got badly going to be hanging on the outside there's special technique to everything this is the special tight rolling we are going to the airport guys we have said interior questions to finish finish the journey so actually they have been here three weeks you could see two weeks of that on this channel like going up north, going to Sikki Harb but they were so into boh-haland-sabo so this is the interior question what do you think is the best way to go? the first one is to go to the airport so far so far so far so far so far what do you think is the best way to go? I think it's a very important way to go to the airport you know the tourist who is going to the airport you are always there you are always there but you are the biggest ocean lover and yet it's still a banal wind up north but one hur heart it's a very important thing to do to get the best weather and it's a very important thing to do to get the best weather to get the best weather but it's also a very important thing to do that's a very important way for locals to come to these plans but if they want to stay at home, then they don't know what you say about the people from a life spot since they come to these 귀여 ones so again it's the first reason to go when you can stay for a while guys, don't they use culture and they lacked culture or haven't finished their work okay, let's termур as a gay my mom you will get played Mom is life. I think it's the same thing as the old one. So, we're going to see the show. We're going to see a little bit of cultural and research. Yes. We're going to see a lot of things. We're going to see a lot of things. We're going to see a lot of things. This is the next question that everyone will have if they are coming back. But it's already on the road. They didn't even leave the Philippines yet. The next trip is already getting planned. We've been saying since the beginning of their trip they wanted it to be more like a authentic experience. They wanted to really experience the Philippines not just go on a holiday. They tried avoiding the really, really touristy places. That's why during this trip they decided not to go to Palau one, but they also want to go there. So that's going to be for their next trip coming up. Coming up. So, yeah. So soon. But now we are going to the airport, we're not knowing where that won't stop us. Okay. Flying if it doesn't start the bus and if it doesn't, seeing it and going. It's first. We, for some reason, don't get excited. Maybe when they go, it always feels natural that even it wouldn't stop you going to the airport, maybe even to the taxi.
