and this one the ham and cheese scroll
what is up guys welcome back to another 
video another vlog today's mission is  
to visit a very high pastry place here in 
sydney they've opened for a few weeks now  
i think it was in early december when they decided 
to open so this pastry shop that we're about to  
hit up is by one of sydney's most popular fine 
dining spots um lumi dining been there before love  
their food i've heard mixed reviews but there's 
more good reviews than okay or so-so people say  
i think they're called laude or lo i'll ask them i 
really don't know how it's pronounced let's get it  
okay guys now i'm lined up here at lorde  
i don't know it's called load a lot it's like 10 
something now it's 10 18 now here we are lined up  
finally so it's all good i remember a few weeks 
ago when they first opened there were like lines  
like there's a long line all the way down that 
way it's a short line today it's a good day i mean  
it is still a public holiday a lot of 
people are probably out of town works for me  
an overkill if you like  
okay now the line starting to build up okay 
so my friend kana just arrived back from japan  
over a month ago and she's got 
some omiyage from japan from me  
going to meet her quickly and exchange 
some pastries with the omiyage
also before i forget this cold brew that they do  
beans are from little marionette another 
boutique roaster here in sydney pretty good  
as i said earlier that before i made my way back 
home i went to see my friend kana gave her her  
pastries and look at this a lot of my favorite 
japanese snacks are in this bag and it will be  
a review for another day two of the pastries 
that i got from lodi earlier i gave them to kana  
because i haven't eaten yet so this 
will be lunch brunch everything
let me just slice them up
okay so we're starting with 
the savory stuff and this one  
the ham and cheese scroll which i didn't 
know that they had in store today this  
one's actually gifted by loaded to me today that 
looks amazing flaky pastry look at all the cheese  
so it's got ham jalapeno parmesan chives 
it's caramosa i can't wait to have that
you see like the layers of pastry in there 
it looks amazing flaky that ham in there
the pastry is buttery it's flaky the pastry 
alone is super good i love how flaky it is  
love the layers in it ham's amazing not 
salty so next is the chicken and leek pie
i don't know how to do that
cross-section mixed seeds and grains on top of 
that pastry too i don't know if you can see that
wow that feeling is super 
flavorsome you can taste a leak
mmm there's definitely definitely 
fennel in that and some vegetable  
that's like soft and sweet otherwise it 
adds some sweetness in there the leek acts  
add some sweetness it carries all the umami 
flavor that's in that it carries it really well
all right we're now moving on to 
the sweet pastries this one is the  
jean they're called the genius i 
think this one's seasonal as well
so this one's a genius it's got roasted 
white chocolate almond marzipan raisins
oh hot damn that's so good um
i thought it was gonna be overly sweet with 
the raisins and the roasted white chocolate
mmm it's not it's got the effect 
of um like a butterscotch inside
pretty good
all right the last pastry i'm gonna try and  
i feel like it's gonna be my favorite one 
it's got pistachio and i love pistachio  
so this one's called the pistachio pro because 
it's a pistache it's a croissant pistachio  
it's a pistachio croissant so pistachio crow it's 
got pistachio frangipani apricot and vanilla cream
that's innards wow wow that looks amazing
oh my god
the buttery pistachio the nutty flavors 
in that oh man and because of the frenzy  
panty part it's a little bit floral it 
offsets all that buttery pistachio goodness  
and the apricot is worked so well with it
this is insane this is freaking insane hands 
down my favorite croissant that is insane
also know what i just realized the 
pistachio croissant it tastes like baklava
it's amazing man i feel like that's a good way 
to end today's vlog i get it it's by lumi lumi  
is popular just really expensive pastries really 
expensive pastries i gotta say that but if i'm  
just gonna judge the taste the flavor and quality 
of the pastries they are high quality pastries
