 Î¥ê Good morning. Another video. Another 10, another dollar. Let's see what the champs doing. Can I borrow your heart? What's that? Spring onion? Lemon grass. Thanks. It's really grow fast. Where's Chica? I don't know. I walk here. You've got so many things planted everywhere. Everywhere. You just show me a path or something. I've got my gardener there. She's thirsty. I'm going to mando's refraque on the vine. That's come with a protection pad. It's pretty good. One here all the way and then one here. Which is... Those one here. One here, one here. Let's do that. This one's done. Another one to go. I got that's it. Refraque in. Good bye, some timber next week for the porch entrance. Alright. I'm feeling we're going to enjoy the porch entrance more than the veranda. Nice here. Just did a drink. More chairs too. Yeah, the car looked different. Maybe it needs some wool covers. I'm waiting for Ransys to fix the tank for the second time. Let's see what happens. You watch your car too, my love. You like your car too? Yes. Okay. Smiley? Yes, some filming. I just give a warning. I guess she does something naughty. What's in my love? Oh, burger. Where you are? No, I'm going to make burgers steak. Bigger steak. Okay. I didn't know we had steak. Today's Sunday, I want to take it easy. I fix a leak of the car. Well, I think I don't know. I'm not sure. I have to wait for the drive. I'll see what happens. I'll show you. Later. I don't want to go into the car now. And I install the roof rack. That was easy. Next week I can buy the rest of those Mahogany spindle or vertical pieces. What do we call it? And I need to do this. I feel lazy today, I don't know. Maybe after lunch, I have a look at how I'm going to put the timber here with the doors, a one door. Why are you lazy? Well, look at this. J.M. Burger, mushroom, white sauce. Yeah. And that's my drive, so I got my bread. Beautiful. And I got a glass of white wine. Oh, I love it too. Everybody enjoy. Come here, my love. Come here. Come here. I can't be sitting. J.M. has gone out doing some gardening. Yeah, almost all the stalling just now, but I wanted to use my Australian curly cut. And then repair a stalling. But I'm thinking this is going to be very expensive at the end because the fact that exchange rate that the bank is going to give me is not going to be a very nice one for sure. And then there's going to be some fees, etc. Because they have to do an exchange rate. So they charge you a fee on top of that plus they give you a poor exchange rate. So I stopped it. So I'm waiting maybe next week or next month. I will put some money in my Filipino bank account. And I will transfer some of my pension to my Filipino bank account through WISE. So I will get a good exchange rate. No, he didn't fee, special fee exchange rate fee blah blah blah. So that will be cheaper. I probably sell a fair bit of money there. Maybe I don't know, just 3000 pesos for sure. I'll see you next week. Yeah, I'm going to stalling because I really feel... I feel no good. Those love streams should be very successful, should be very entertaining, should have a good time. And I really owe that to all my viewers. Because I know some of you get really frustrated and I'm very sorry. Yeah, and Bella just agree. So we're going to do that. So we see if we can order next week and I will take 3 to 5 weeks to receive stalling. I'll just have to not do much in the house, I guess. To compensate at least for a month. And yeah, we'll do that like that. The stalling could have to be a master. I mean, I've been working hard and trying to get the best WIFI possible. But it's so... So irrelevant, so poor here. We're in the countryside, you know? That's the way it is. Like many countries, Australia is the same. I don't think it's any better. We're in the countryside WIFI. If you're far from the man's city, your tower is far. Of course, it's going to be hard. And... Well, maybe I can get my antenna about 300m high. Maybe I will get good WIFI, but imagine the money has to spend. May as well spend 30,000 pesos in stalling. And the advantage is that there's no breakdown. So I will buy a little power generator. Not just a small one. Maybe 300 watts would be enough. That they're not too expensive, maybe a few thousand. Just to make sure that that thing runs. And we can have an internet. At least on our phone. So we'll see how we go. Anyway, that's what I want to add to you on that. So we keep you posted on stalling. Okay, sometime baby seating is quite easy. Cast the apple leave tea. So we already bought it. And got the juice into a cup. It's good, you know. Tea is very good for you. Antimifamilitary stress, back pain. Many things. Blood pressure, blood sugar. It's all there. I'm going to have this before going to bed. There's been time. Bella can carry a car. Can you carry it? She's been lifting it. Good morning, beautiful day to the day. With a bit of a run. She's good. That may be run out of gas. Jam was making some beautiful pancake. A yellow Southern, no more gas. So she's been chopping wood. BBQ to the rescue. Let's pancake maybe going to test even better. People from the gas supply free delivery. But we're not going to wait for them because it's going to take half a day or so. So on the way to the Apollo, which we need to go anyway, we'll pick up. We'll replace a new gas bottle. In the meantime. The pancake has been done. I'm a new fry pan. Let's hit them. Okay, let's do the dishes now. Bella, she really loves Mandarin juice. Just give this morning for the first time a little bit. She loves it. Oh yeah. Oh yeah, a little bit acid. But this Mandarin, the very soft and not acid actually. The sweet, very nice. She's be sticky. She's going to be sticky. Yeah. Yeah, my voice. Hello. Yes, well, yeah. Yes, well, yeah. Yes, well, yeah. Yeah. Charlie V. I'd have to do some Russian. You will sap your hair, baby. You don't like those things. You don't like them. Oh, second one is off. I'm going to pull it back. That's enough. That's enough. Well, mommy, mommy buying bread of that, you see? Look, mommy, a bread. Yeah. Yeah, it jumps up there by some bread. We call bread, but. Yeah, I want this one. And I want this one. I'm so good. I'm going to drive the car. No, leave that. Oh, my God. Get to me. She touched everything, everything, everything. She's so curious. She's so alert. It's so hard. So what else? What else you want to play with? Huh? Oh, who's that, Bella? Bella. Hello, mommy. Are you living? Yeah? You should have mommy help me out there. She's happy. She's been very naughty. She's naughty. Yeah, both her. I guess we're supposed to work on the house, but. I got a problem with the band. I got a gas leak under the car. I don't know exactly where I come from. You need to dismantle up things. I don't want to get involved with that. I'm going to chip here so I get some people to fix this. I'm going to town. I got it fixed. I'm going to get it fixed. 62 pesos a litre. Here are days that I will fix my scratch with the small accident I had the other day. And across the road is fun. Do a mechanical group. So anyway, I'm going to have a look at it and see how much. OK, they need to take the tank out. So a big job. So what I'm going to do, I'm going to live with them. Somebody's going to take me home. This gentleman. Too late. OK, let's go. OK, I'm home. I'm happy. It's my wife. OK, well, the car is getting fixed. I need to do the entrance here. OK, well, the car is getting fixed. I need to do the entrance here. So I need to find some 3x2. Maybe bolt down the side of the stairs to use the support. Let's see how we go. OK, I want to put some of those timber for support. And bolted on the side of the stairs, concrete stairs. First of all, I give you a bit of a beauty with this thing. OK, let's go. OK, today we have banana and sweet potato boiled. Noodle with vegetable and saline. This is very healthy. I love it. Let's hit. Enjoy the lunch, baby. You love fish? Yes. Yeah, you're going to show me your fish. Mmm, yum. Fish, more fish. Mmm, yum. Mmm, beautiful. Yum, yum, yum. OK, the baby's back. All good. Can't see any more leak. I have to take the tank out to fix it. OK. It costs 2,000 pesos. And free delivery. OK, I hope all good. Today's been very, very hot. And we almost used up all the water we got stored. So we need to go and buy some water from the neighbor. Sarri's store has got a well. And we can buy the water from there. So I'm going to put all my container in there. You can see me filming. And I'm going to get some more three more container. And that's OK with our mind. It's fun. Just around the corner here. So it's now fast 300 meters. Maybe 400 meters. There it is. Mmm. And that will last about three days. That's the tank I was talking about. It's leaking everywhere. OK, I just saw before I got two of those nets. And I'd like to probably bolt them there. With this spin bolt them. I think connect to the top rail. You can see there. Anyway, something like that. So I need to go to the dipolec tomorrow. And buy some bolts. I want to bolt them. I want them to be really strong and rigid. I don't want screw or nail. I don't use nail here anyway, guys. For some of you think I'm using nails. I'm not. Everything with screws or bolts in disguise. So yeah, it's it for today. I mean, that much today. It's been a very hot day. And my car has gone for repairs. No much to do. You
