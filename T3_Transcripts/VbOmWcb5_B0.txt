i have a beautiful rice here it's called 
koshihikari so actually in the philippines  
i often ate sushi i've eaten it many 
times in manila as well as in pangasinan  
many nice sushi places never have i seen this 
version yet so what i'm going to make today
with filipino food rice is one of the most 
important ingredients or actually the most  
important ingredient in sushi but also in 
filipino cuisine we'll wash the rice thoroughly  
until the water is almost clear 
this has been washed three times
the tricky part is always how much water to add 
but i will add same amount of water plus a little  
bit extra we'll put the lid on and bring it to 
a boil i hope you can see it so when it starts  
bubbling lightly then i'll reduce the heat and 
we let it simmer for 15 minutes 15 minutes lang  
now after 15 minutes i waited another 5 minutes 
okay so i cooled off the heat so i turned off the  
heat and then now it's a it has been another 
five minutes and the rice looks really good
wow
look at that wow it's the next day making 
another batch of rice this time a little  
bit more because we're gonna make lots of 
sushi to marinate the wonderful sushi rice  
we are going to add half a cup of sushi 
su which is a sushi rice vinegar to this  
we will add one tablespoon of sugar as well as 
one teaspoon of salt okay and then we'll mix it  
then we're going to heat up this mixture in the 
pan i have a kombu here which is a dried kelp this  
will give a really nice flavor to the sushi-su 
or the marinade adding that into the mixture  
but we're not gonna boil this just heat it up 
this will give a really nice umami flavor to the  
sushi rolls so the first sushi that we will make 
will be a vegan sushi i think with the cucumber  
seaweed and also uh avocado so 
i'm taking out the sushi rice
the rice is still warm so i'm just cutting 
through with this spatula next step i remove  
the kombu seaweed from here so we're gonna 
pour the sushi soup vinegar on the spatula
and then we're gonna just go over 
it so that it will spread evenly
then we continue to just cut in it and we also 
gonna use this fan to cool off the rice quickly  
so it's kind of difficult to do at the same time 
but this will help to make a really nice texture  
so i'm cutting the cucumber like this 
okay so half a cucumber just like that
and then i'll remove the seeds here
so one more time like this 
and another time like that
the next thing we'll do is put the seaweed here 
and we take some rice so i put a little bit of  
water on my fingers so it's wet and then 
i'll spread the rice carefully but i don't  
really press hard you know just just spread it out 
evenly next we'll put some wasabi but not so much  
just a little bit of wasabi  
in the middle then we'll add uh cucumber 
in the middle and now we're gonna roll it  
and then press a little bit like that now 
i'm gonna take a little bit off from the side
first sushi roll this is just with the cucumber 
next i want to try with the spicy tuna so i have  
a spicy tuna mixture here let's add some of the 
spicy tuna in the middle after this one we're  
gonna try with filipino food inside just gonna 
cut it up now it's time to add the filipino food  
in the sushi roll but first i'm gonna show 
you which filipino food i made so the first  
filipino dish that comes to mind thinking 
about filipino food is always chicken adobo  
i think this could be really nice in sushi 
so today i'm gonna try making a chicken adobo  
as a filling for a sushi roll we'll start 
with adding some oil i use a white onion
so we'll brown the onions a little bit and in 
the meantime i'm going to cut the bawang i made  
sure to cut the bawang fine now why adobo in 
sushi i think it could be really great because  
you eat you eat adobo with um rice diba so sushi 
is rice no so you have the rice and adobo and then  
maybe only thing will be added is like a little 
bit of seaweed but for the rest the the basis is  
the same you know basic uh basic ingredients 
stay the same but i'm still very curious  
how this is gonna taste by the way how do you say 
curious in tagalog let me know in the comments  
okay i'm curious we're gonna use a beautiful 
chicken thai today so these chicken thighs  
have to be cut a little bit fine since we're 
gonna put them in the sushi roll manok goes in
so now i'm increasing the heat a little bit
paminta so we brown the chicken a little 
bit bawang so to finish the chicken adobo  
i'm gonna add the soy sauce
and then the white vinegar
and a little bit konting
asukal
and then i'll cover it leave it on for 
a bit we're adding the chicken adobo  
and i'm really curious how this tastes will be  
so i will not put too much i'm still going to 
roll this let me know in the comments what you  
think of this okay let's roll it up so we'll cut 
a piece of the side first and then our adobo sushi  
okay there we go looks pretty nice instead 
of putting this up i'll put this on the side  
so it looks a little bit nicer right we also 
have sweet egg i made the nice marinated egg  
this one has medium and sugar and a little bit 
of soy sauce as well it's going to be really  
nice for the nigiri sushi that's the next one 
that we will make rice with sweet egg we have a  
beautiful piece of salmon here so the next sushi 
will be with fish this is very nice salmon it's  
actually smoked salmon so it's not completely 
raw but it will be really nice on the nigiri
so that's our salmon sushi so there's the 
sushi we have salmon tuna chicken adobo  
sweet egg more salmon and some other 
varieties there including cucumber
