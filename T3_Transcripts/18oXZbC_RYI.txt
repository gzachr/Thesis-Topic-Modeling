 Welcome everybody as you can see a little bit of a different setup today We're gonna try this for longer videos. It's a little more comfortable to sit on a couch I don't know if our faces are too far and they're like a kid's faces the audio is hopefully better though With this setup as well. We have these microphone Look at our microphone looking. They are this is what we do on like our patreon and stuff K-drama stuff, but we're gonna try it for one of our Channel videos. Yeah, so this should be cool. The video will be able to be very large very large But I don't know if YouTube you want to see more of us or the video needs to be big So let us know we might be able to use the mics and just make the camera closer as well if that's preferred Let us know what you think Anyways, we got an interesting video that I scout recommended It's called how the US stole the Philippines. Yes, we are from the US Yes, we are and we react to the Philippines and the US likes to steal stuff they do sometimes It's a black liquid Oh oil oil yes we We know a lot about the US stealing things yes, of course they like to you know hop into places They're not supposed to be and you know destroy countries for the black liquid, but how did they steal the Philippines? Oh, it was this is actually we actually did a history. This is kind of a history reaction We did a history of Philippines reaction and I think somebody in that video was like commented a big paragraph under the assumption that we somehow supported the colonization of the Philippines That is an accurate. Yes a lot of people very Very like they miss judge our ideology a lot, but let's do this Johnny Harris the most intense man on YouTube will be an intense video especially with the title. Yes We enjoy subscribe like the video. We got a more Filipino content on the channel. We have a travel Channel just open check that out right down in the link below There's a blog's on there you might be able to see this duck in the vlogs too. He's pretty cool. All right, let's do this Duckie Black Thousand years traveling between these islands trading with each other and with the region and developing religion Identity and culture it eventually became a country called mai and while all of these advancements were happening here on these islands Another group of humans had been evolving in another part of the world over here in Europe Spain But this other group had a different culture a different religion Many of their advancements were achieved through expansion not collaboration Oh When they stumped out others They wanted to conquer I can't see these people these people this culture would soon be swallowed stripped of what made them Them and soon their name would be changed after the name of the king of their conquerors This isn't a story just about a big powerful military taking over new lands We know that story pretty well the story of these people offers a new perspective to anyone who will listen It's a perspective that has been wiped from our history books because of the inherent discomfort and tension With this fact that the United States once a colony that heroically threw off an empire to become independent soon became An empire itself. It contradicts our founding belief that it is quote self-evident that all men are created equal and this story is That's also doing include People of color during that time It's all wrapped up in the story of these 7,000 islands and their people So I want to tell you this or a whimery of how the west stole the philips There are still American citizens today who do not have equal voting rights. These are citizens of americans island territory All right The dawn the other dawn Throw in paper towels like basketball How do you us the old if it should be interesting very The first time I had part 8 because I want to tell you that is one downfall of this it's gonna be very difficult to pause All right, sorry Johnny if you want to support Johnny go look at his ad so let's get back to the video you saw the link This video could be called how Spain stole the philipines since Spain was the first nation to conquer and control these islands like Actually exactly 500 years ago and indeed Spain left a very deep influence on these islands Not least the name itself, which is named after king philip Spain brought their religion their language their culture Which is why the most common last names in the philipines are like Reyes or del Rosario de la Cruz del de los santos but the heyday of the Spanish Empire came and went and by the 1800s It was kind of crumbling, but it was the arrival of a new superpower that I believe had a bigger imprint Not just on the philipines, but on the US itself It established rules and behaviors that we still grapple with today And that's why this is the story of how the US stole the philipines. So let's go Right all right Johnny take us on this journey Guys we don't even need to travel to the philipines anymore. Johnny's going to take us there Tired Okay, so it's the end of the 1800s up until now US expansion sort of looks like this It's all happening on this mainland and at this point There sort of became a big debate of like do we keep going some people wanted to keep expanding the US outside of this mainland The president at the time wasn't a big expansion guy, but he was surrounded by people who loved war Specifically this guy and these people who surrounded the president had their eye on this Spanish colony right off the American coast called Cuba where the locals were rising up against Spain Wait a minute isn't this a video about the philipines? Why are we talking about Cuba? We're getting there in just a second Okay, so anyway, okay, thank you Johnny. I was wondering Johnny come on They're like we don't need more war, but thanks to the explosion of an American submarine in Cuba, which was probably an accident And thanks to some highly unethical journalism that blamed the explosion on Spain and a big thanks to again this guy Teddy Roosevelt who at this point was just a peon he was literally the assistant secretary of the Navy But he somehow could jolt his boss's boss the president of the United States to go to war in Cuba Teddy is this that kind of man he will get his fingers in everything Yeah, the little teddy fingers, you know, and he'll get his face on a big rock you will you will with other with three other people Yeah, and I've heard too that the The whole like thinking of this ship too was possibly not even like Actually the Spanish or if it was it wasn't like the Spanish's fault really Oh, no, I don't I think that I don't think it really was it was like uh, what's it called? It's where something goes wrong. It happened in Vietnam too Yeah, it's where they like bomb it and like they just did that we have to invade them now the America has never they have never started the war, but most of the things they do Ideology wise or like they set up an event that causes the other person to start the war But they really started it basically even if they even if the people didn't actually blow it up Yeah, like there's no way the like a lot of things I think the USS Tonkin The Vietnamese didn't really have the capabilities to blow up a US ship, but they still blamed it on them So Yeah, then they're like oh well, I guess we're gonna go to war. Yeah, I don't want to do it Guys even though they may have not but we'd have to Teddy Teddy wrote a Roosevelt's an interesting one too because he was like mr. Trustbuster mr National Parks, but also he's like yeah, I want to kill people. Yeah, we are going to take land. Yeah To like liberate the Cubans from Spain. So the US declared war on Spain in 1898, but this begins a new era of war in the United States no longer can you just go into war and just like take over land You need an angle you need to sell the war to the American people So the angle on this war was liberation. We're liberating the people the people you liberate Will witness the honorable and decent spirit of the American military no no no no no that's that's later. We're talking about 1898 But yes the whole idea of selling war to the American public didn't really go away after this Why did the US go to war in Iraq? New early stages So anyway the US is now at war with Spain Which is an empire that is deeply in decline as I mentioned It's not going to be hard to win, but soon it's not just Cuba the US really meaning Teddy Roosevelt who again is just an Assistant Secretary of the Navy. He's like not a big decision maker He somehow maneuvers the situation to say like let's liberate next door portorico and while we're at it Let's go into the Pacific and liberate all the way across the world from Spain as well Teddy didn't even ask his boss to do this He literally sent off a cable to the Navy commander in Asia that was like George. Do we go attack the Philippines? We're Spain. What the heck Teddy now and George do is a rough writer. I mean told They call it a rough or with Spain in the Philippines Teddy was sort of of the mind like better to ask forgiveness than permission. I mean I get that but Come on not 30 pull it off Anyway, and now because of Teddy Roosevelt who we literally named the teddy bear after Side note we're at war not in the Caribbean only but also in the Pacific The US arrives to the Philippines and sees that the locals had already been fighting against the Spanish for like years The Spanish were weak and were totally declining So it's like the top of the ninth inning or like the fourth quarter of the Spanish in the Philippines You're like oh you're welcome. Yeah, I mean you can't do without us Yeah, let us liberate fighting this bloody war for years against the Spanish So yeah, I guess United States if you want to come help us deal the final blow to Spain like sweet So George Dewey this Navy commander and his fleet show up to Manila meanwhile back in the US people are like Wait, weren't we just supposed to invade Cuba? What are we doing in the Philippines now? And the US government's like because the Philippines is a perfect hub for commercial opportunities in Asia And we think that if we don't take it Japan or Germany might take it Which would clearly diminish our geostrophysics advantage in the Pacific? No, they didn't say that They said we want to liberate the people of the Philippines Liberate the people you liberate will witness the honorable and decent spirit literally what they always say So that's really what they're saying about Venezuela Like this year they're like Ah, we got to go down and save all those starving people in Venezuela We got to overthrow that government It doesn't end it's the same thing over and over Spanish see the US arrived to the Philippines and they're like great We're done. So the Spanish military commanders ask to meet with the US military commanders They meet in secret and spains like listen, I know we're losing But we really want to save some face here. We don't want it to look like we lost to the Filipino revolutionaries And I'm not kidding the Spanish commander literally said that he would quote be willing to surrender to white people But not to the Philippines The US commanders like okay, there's an opportunity here We said we were here to liberate the Filipinos, but we haven't promised anything yet So we would much rather it looked like the US defeated Spain instead of Helped the Filipinos defeat Spain much better for our brand said the United States So together the United States and Spanish militaries organized a fake battle a fake battle in which the US would fight the Spanish in Manila and the Spanish would intentionally lose and the climax of this whole theatrical battle According to the plan was that at the end the US would storm towards the inner walled city of Manila The last stronghold of where the Spanish are oh and the key detail in this whole plan They would not let the Filipino fighters the ones that had been doing all the actual fighting against the Spanish Join them as they stormed towards the walled city to deal the final blows The Spanish Empire and this would mean that the Filipinos technically didn't gain their independence It was actually the US who conquered the Spanish and then the Spanish are like oh can you give us 20 million dollars for our troubles? And the US was like yes, sure So now the US wins the war and they Yeah, it's very interesting over the Philippines So yeah, this happened they did the fake battle they won the war instead of liberating the Filipinos They just say hey where you're new colonizers Psych meanwhile back in the United States they got to keep up this white savior liberation narrative that they created to justify going to war with Spain So you see a lot more theatrical PR by the government they staged this giant military Create in New York City where this military commander who did the fake war George Dewey Marches down they called it Dewey Dave was like a two-day parade in New York City They created a big like military arch for him He became like a military hero for having like that graded all these people from the Spanish and then you start to see these like crazy advertisements like this soap advertisement that has George Dewey the commander washing his hands with the caption quote the first step towards lightning the white man's burden Is through teaching the virtues of cleanliness? Oh and on the side you have soap being offloaded in the Philippines Even at the closing industry the US had to frame this not as conquest But as the honorable duty of the US Civilize these people or in the words of the so bad quote to brighten the dark corners of the earth. Oh geez This is insane and was not that long ago. Okay, so this is where things really heat up It's 1900 now Spain loses the war obviously and the US now owns Puerto Rico Guam and they claim the Philippines But the local Filipinos who have been fighting for their freedom for years are like no no no no no You just walked in here on our rebellion and conspired with the Spanish to make it look like you were liberating us No, this is our country. We don't need another colonizer and this is where things really heat up When if they said it exactly like that like Johnny like really sassy. Yeah, probably I would assume so because you know you're mad You know, yeah, you gotta get sassy about it But okay, I actually die right there I can't but it's very state and this time against the United States It is a pretty horrible bloody war one that I never learned about in school It include massacres of men, women and children by the United States and hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths But the US eventually won and they established a government in the Philippines back in the US The appetite for expansion continued to go down and people sort of just forgot about the Philippines They forgot that there was a war there one newspaper summed it up by saying Americans didn't know if the Philippines were islands or canned fruit but the fact that the US went to war and now owned the Philippines in addition to Puerto Rico and Guam so this baked a very important question one that hadn't been asked before Which is is all of this land America? Are these people Americans? This was a huge question and the answer to that question affects how we see these territories still today Okay, so a few years after these wars There's a guy in New York City who's importing oranges from one of these territories Puerto Rico and he's paying tariffs on these imports because you know, that's what you do when you're importing oranges from another country wait a minute Hey, let's make it a territory This guy was like Didn't we conquer Puerto Rico and Guam and the Philippines? Isn't that America? The constitution says that you can't put tariffs on stuff coming from other parts of the US like New Jersey can't put tariffs on like Avocados from California so he's And his case and a bunch of others like it I did my pictures different joys Must decide is this land where we just won a war is this America are these Americans if they are do they get all the same rights as other Americans do they get to vote do they get to participate in the US economy without tariffs like any other state does And honestly this isn't a question about oranges and tariffs the real question at stake here is is America the land of the free where all are created equal imagine them are we an empire back then they're very late Hmm Is there any way that we can make it so we get more money off of it, but they don't get any right now We don't want to give the non-white people any power Yeah Yeah The Spanish are just like yeah, we don't want to lose to the people that are white so we'll lose to you Yeah, I did not know that that is very interesting. That's crazy. Yeah, they just Uh-huh, and then they like get the money out of it too still Gosh That's crazy The US it's all Teddy's fault The other Teddy was a good guy because he went and he was trust-busting and he has teddy bears and he was setting up yellow stone national park Save in the environment, but no he did some bad stuff Teddy Teddy Come on man Scoops up colonial possessions in war and rules the people who are usually black and brown as subjects Not fully a part of the country That was the question that was a stake and in this series of cases in the early 1900s the Supreme Court decided that America Was the latter Is the latter they created a new category of land called unincorporated territories where the people don't have any representation in the democracy But where congress could create laws on their own particularly laws dealing with revenue Which would not be allowed by the constitution for states within the union We can think of the reality was stuff that's totally unconstitutional for other parts of our country. The other word The exact thing they revolted against it The point for revenue but whose people don't get to vote and Don't get the right to trial by jury So yeah, the Philippines in addition to Puerto Rico and Guam remained unincorporated territories A place that the US could kind of just ignore without a lot of consequence They weren't important enough for strategic enough to be considered to become states like Hawaii or Alaska So they sort of faded from American consciousness like this is why we never heard about this in school Like it didn't make it into the history books in any salient way and how far the Philippines had faded from people's mind became very clear in December of 1941 during World War II the US had owned the Philippines for like 40 years When a fleet of Japanese bombers flew across the Pacific and bombed an American naval base in Hawaii But what we don't really remember is on that day Japan bombed Guam and the Philippines two American territories as well as several other American and British territory Well, don't even imagine that. Yeah, I've never heard of that This is the original draft that FDR spent the day marking up before he gave it zoom in a little bit and you'll see on this draft that it mentioned the Philippines originally But FDR crossed it out. He crossed out the mention of Manila Yes, the Philippines was on some map somewhere. Yes We technically owned it But the people really didn't want to hear about it because these people were Americans The Supreme Court had decided that then we're going to become states anytime soon So why mention them after that day Japan actually fell on invaded the Philippines. They didn't do that to Hawaii But they did to the Philippines until the end of the war at which point the Philippines were finally Granted independence in 1946 fast forward to today And this we own you but you're not really Americans precedent established by the Supreme Court Still applies to four million people who live in unincorporated territories Or let's just call it a spade a spade. Let's call them what they are These are colonial possessions the people who live here don't experience the full rule of law They don't get trial by jury They don't have full representation in our democracy And they don't get to vote for the president This is why when a hurricane hits Puerto Rico the government response is not nearly what it should be The way Trump talked about Puerto Rico as almost another country is not a part of us The mirror is exactly how the Supreme Court talked about these unincorporated territories They're for revenue not to compete with American farmers We conquered these places But we didn't want to bring the people fully into the American project We left them out And there they remain today Yeah, it's uh And Puerto Rico, I don't know if Filipinos That are watching this follow anything about like American politics But the Puerto Ricans voted that they wanted to join the United States and be a state But there is a particular political party in the United States That is very against that because it would hurt their chance or it would hurt Their status in the Senate Yeah, because Puerto Rico has got a lot of people And most of them would not vote for that party No, so it would create two more Senate seats Which would most likely go to a party that Is not to let the other party wants them to go to so they're like no they cannot be a state And uh yeah, everyone else like they're fighting Whatever Yeah, everyone except for the Puerto Ricans So currently they want to make Puerto Rico a state and Washington DC a state Because currently one's a district and one's a territory and they don't have For they have more population than many states do But They don't get the same representation in the government has Some of those states like Wyoming that has 500,000 people It's really interesting and we saw it With the Philippines here Obviously things are better now the Philippines you're all out there doing your own thing And apparently you like Americans now Yay Or at least like us Please Oh my god Johnny He's so serious on the top All right, thanks for watching everybody hopefully enjoyed hopefully you enjoyed the videos really interesting. There's a lot of Like information like the new information about That I haven't heard before you kind of just hear oh yeah, then America bought They beat Spain in the war and then they bought the Philippines from Spain or they took it over That's all we ever hear yeah, they didn't say oh yeah, they uh just did it like a little scheming and they made a deal To not give it to those Philippines because they're not white. Yes, and Spain did not want to lose to the non-white. Oh no No, so interesting really interesting racism Poor race bad bad thanks for watching everybody hopefully you enjoy subscribe if you did we'll see in the next one bye You
