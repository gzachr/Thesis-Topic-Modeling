 Good night. It's our first time going to bed spot. Yeah, it's the same. You're full? Hello. Oh shit. We're going to go by where that fire was in Mandawi. We've decided a bridge in the squatter area and it burned a whole bunch of homes. Yeah? Yeah, I have. I'm good. Thank you. You're having a pretty interesting day. Little big ass. Little big ass. Yeah. This is all you need. So would you think of them two vlogger girls? They were pretty cool. Yeah? Nice. Yeah, we saw the comments you were making. We had a big little smile on our face. Oh, full of merch, you. You too. Yeah. The temple of Leia. It's a tourist track, but it's good to see. That's nice. I like the view. When you get to the top of that mountain up above that, you should see the view up there. I don't know how good the view is going to be today because it's a little bit cloudy. But I was impressed. The day we went up there, I was telling the real. I said, surprise me. It's take me where you would want to take somebody for the first time. And we went up there and I was impressed. I was like, great. That's the lovey. Yeah, lovey. The view up there is incredible. Is that a battery? That's the receiver. I got it. See, I got it. I got a microphone. And I didn't have a cold shoe mount. They got a cold shoe mount there. I don't know. And that cold shoe mount there. That's a lifetime. Is she driving you crazy? I like? No. She's good. She's good. Always good. Good. That's good there. One was drug. I lose drug. Me crazy. I got the top of thing going on. And finally I started yelling. I said, you need to tell me what's wrong because communication is everything in a relationship. It was about the dirty clothes. And I'm like, well, you need to tell me. And we couldn't, the wash machine wasn't working. All the lights are blinking on and off. And she was stressing out because you can only wash somebody clothes by hand. And I said, no, we'll figure out. Yeah, but we figured it out. Yeah. We got it. And then you were good. You just got to tell me when something's wrong because I kept thinking I did something. I'm like, yo. It's dressing up the water pressure. Yeah. I don't know what you're... It's a pressure. It doesn't wash the washing area. It doesn't wash the washing area. Yo, I got the top O treatment from a hell to other day. I, the drain was walking around all mad with this crazy look on her face. And I kept asking her, you know, what's wrong? Just tell me. She wouldn't say anything. And finally she started crying. And I said, oh man, I said, here we go. It's because of the clothes and there's so much wash to do. And the wash machines broken and the lights are flashing. And then she said, I'm not a wash machine mechanic. I said, no, well, we could figure out how to fix it. I said, we got to reset the wash machine. I said, I don't think the wash machine broke. Oh man, I get it now. Till it's really fixed. Yeah. Right here, here's the... What's the name of this bridge we're going over? Asmenia. Asmenia bridge. Asmenia? Yes. Before it's called Maktan Mandawi. I want to change the name. Yeah. So is that the metal over there that we're going up? Yes. The scrap metals. The palm in there. The real name. The real name. The real name. The real name. The real name. The real name. The real name. The real name. The real name. Benny, was your dad in the Air Force? Yeah. He had a few two years in the Air Force. He was a pilot. Aircraft mechanic? Okay. The real name is an aircraft mechanic. Here. There he is. That's where the fire was down there. Yeah. The whole... Oh, there he is. There's a bunch of scrap metal down there. Now the... The ones that lift behind the post of their houses. You're right down there, yeah. We're still doing all part. This is the right thing. You can see all the brand new blue torques. Yeah. Wow. Okay, so that's where all the stuff was on fire. How many months ago was that? Maybe two or more months. Two and a half months ago. Like in the bridge. Imagine how the bridge knocked out. You have the bridge like a weak in the iron and the bridge. There was like stuff under, I'm shorter. It's water stuff under the bridge. Because these the bridge is shelter from the weather from the rain and everything. Because if I was going to build a temporary shelter, I would try to get under the bridge to use the bridge to cover me from the rain. I used to drink with people back in Portland, Oregon. There was a whole community of people living under the bridge. I used to go down there and get drunk with them. You're city and all kinds of people in the tunnels. Subway tunnel, right? Yeah. A tunnel, rats. I ran out of gas. And that's a pretty good way to go. Do you believe? As we got closer, I realized that was a fake statement. What do you mean? More people because we do need for that one. It's bare head. See that van over there? The tunnel was saying the van were in as more leg room and it's wider. So for like foreigners, or taller, so your knees aren't like hitting the backs of the seats and you don't have to like sit sideways in the seat. So that's another good reason to hire a drill. Ladies, what are you doing back there? Isle, what are you doing? What's going on? Well, it's one thing good about a bike. You can make time and traffic. Yeah. And run up the side. Pants everybody. Like they say, if you don't like my driving, stay off the side. Yeah. This guy's half on, half off. Wee! I have an American guest also last month. He says, I learned a lot from you. Because he's driving in Takaya also, Mari Dovelovino. We learned a lot from me. From driving, yeah. He said, there's a lot of guys coming you off. They just don't find it. This is nails. You got to have patience. Yeah. And what would be a mistake if you were a foreigner, you came here, didn't drive around with somebody like yourself, or a person that's used to driving here, and you just rented a vehicle and tried to drive. That's a big mistake. It's better to drive around with somebody like yourself to rail and see how people drive in then renovable. But just to get to the airport and rent a vehicle, and you've never been here before, that could be a huge mistake. Because they do not drive here. Yeah, I just hope that, right? Exactly. We missed it, babe. Sino- Sino-lo, we missed it. Yeah, we missed it. It will be every third Sunday of the month. Yeah, it wasn't feeling good. That's what's slowing me down. I try to do the best I could do with the vlogging. But every, I don't know. I can't really make plans, because sometimes I make a plan and then I got a cancel, like this morning, the rail was waiting for like an hour. I said, be there at eight, and then every couple things started going wrong, and I'm like, oh, here we go again. It took me like three, we got up at 5 a.m. this morning. Three. No, but it's all kinds of stuff. I got a big ass sore on my right ass cheap, because when they lifted me up to put me in a wheelchair, I got my shorts, which tore the skin off my ass. I got this big ass scab on my ass. So I had to put a bandage on that and then tape this catheter to my leg, and it was just one thing after another. Then I was having problems going to the bathroom. Doesn't end. When I just put the gun in my mouth to get that move. Boom! That bottle of whiskey out. I don't want to upset my wife. I don't know if you're about to. So Darrell, everything he just said about it, but in America, we call it TMI to my typical mission. Exactly. Nobody wants to hear about the big scab on my ass. Unless you're up by you. Huh? Well, are you going so that far? Everybody's there? Um, Bruno's. Bruno's. Same as last night? Yes. The guy was sick, and he called in yesterday, because we called to see if he was going to be there tonight. And the lady said, well, he called and said he was sick. He wasn't sure if he was coming to work. So now that I told him, I'll let him. I said, oh, that's great. I go get my haircut. Maybe I can get sick too. I'll take a chance. I'm not worried if he's sick. I just hope he's not feeling sick or he can't cut hair again. Like, it's serious on the Philippines, man. You're asking me to go on a work with her, sick or not. Not liking the United States. No days off. So where are these two vloggers from originally? We're still in a little bit of Toledo. Toledo, Bethlehem, Toledo. Toledo. Province, now it's not a Toledo city. How far is that from here? Is it on this island? Yeah, maybe it's South-Eastern part. A little people. Maybe one hour and a half drive around to Bozign. That place became a city because of the Goldmine. Oh, yeah, wait a minute. We were driving one day and I put it in the vlog and some guy made a comment. He said, that was in Japanese Goldmine by that bridge or something. Really? We were driving. Somebody made a comment about a Goldmine. Japanese Goldmine. Strap on. And that generator strapped it back in the flight. Sometimes you'll see people carrying. All right, we're here at the mall. There it is. Starting to rain a little bit. That's what that lady had her purse like that. This is snowing because of the construction. Before it's one way, it makes it. The rail was saying they're building a school. SM, all is building a school all the way through like college. Right on this property. The name of this school is National University. Wow. And you. You know, this is our price building. Helping most her in the school. Oh, yeah. The United States, the malls used to be really popular in the 1980s. And then from like the 1980s on, they became less popular. People started to shop it online and then it just killed off the malls. The malls aren't crowded like they are here. That's all BJ. You want to meet a woman? Go to the mall. What's my favorite mall for women? Isla? No, that brasianos or... Isla? I had the girls checking me out. I thought that we were looking at Nixie. So what if you want some girls here? Yes. Go drink. Go to coffee shop. There's a lot of girls here. You heard it. That's how you do it. There's no secret rhyme or reason to it. Say, I have noticed you from afar. Can I buy you a coffee? Oh, I already have one. Well, how about a dessert? What's your name? See all the cranes and stuff? You can see the booms for the cranes. They're doing a bunch of construction down below. You can see it down there. That school is going to be big. All down below. I'm going to get a parking garage over there. I'm going to get a carata. It's going to be serious, eh? Can you drive the Bruno's label? Yes, I can. It's a lot of money. Bruno? I can't drive it. I can't drive it. You can drive it. This is the label of your... Fabricium. Imagine getting stuck. Maybe I can get stuck in a slip. Let me see what this thing is. Let me see if I can... Hold on, I want to check this out. Maybe I can get stuck in this? Look at that. Woo! Should I take a chance? Babe. Let me try this slip. S... S. I want to try this slip. Try something new. Does this work? It works? Yeah. Oh yeah. Is that a rubber band? Hello. Oh shit. Alright. Alright, we're... We're in. This guy's leaving. He's leaving. Alright. Hold on a minute. Hold on a minute. Now I understand. I understand. That's all? It's time to go find Bruno's hairstyle. Hair style. That's time to go. And then Benny's going to go find a two-logger girl. It'd be cool to be on her channel. For a New York minute, just introduce myself. So check out. It's always good to stick together. Today. A couple people ask me, can I be on your channel? Absolutely. Because they didn't have a lot of soap. I'll help. I ordered it last time. It was better than 90% of the pizza I've tried in the Philippines so far. The Bruner's here. Babe, later on. Yes. We're going to go to SNR pizza over there. Okay. Get a couple slices. Right over there. This is not playing. We got to find out. Big shirt. Big shirt. Anything on the floor? We're... We're going to wear the electronics. Down this area. And try out my accessories. Yes. What was that floor? We got the SIM card on and all the electronics and everything. Second, level. Yeah, this level? I forgot if it's third or second. It was second. Is this the second level? Third. See? Oh yeah. Is this the second level? Not yet. Okay. Turn your back as open. It's hard. It's cool. The Jokey, the Karioky. Freshest best. I agree. Mmm. Mmm. Very delicious. Here we go. So what do you put in this massage? Gen. Oh, here's that music. Let me shut it off. Who would have said it's going to go ask? The security officer. Where are Bruno's hair salon? Is that Bruno's barber? I forgot about Bruno's hair salon. Hopefully, Colin, the guy that cut my hair last time, is there? Third news. Oh, third level? Downstairs, boom. Downstairs? Second level. Maybe I could go down the steps. We got to find an escalator. I'll put an escalator. Huh? One chest. Left, boom. Thank you. Right there. Huh? There. My chest heat. Is that where the elevator is at? Yeah. Where's the toilet? Oh, check, basically. This mall's pretty big. There's a lot of what they give you. That's what I always look for, but I think they do. But I have no idea where they would be at. You would think they would be in the entrance when you first come in? I'm trying to find a video of your partner today. Chinese food, we love. Because she's so busy. I could go for some Chinese food today. For sure. Some beef broccoli? Oh, yeah. Allo, allo. Yeah. I don't know. I don't like that stuff too much for some reason. I'm not really a sweet person. Like, like, sugar and stuff. I don't need a lot of sugar. I try not to. I don't know. Elevator. I know. The Bruno says downstairs. Maybe here. The bone. The quest continues. Babe, find out where the Jolly B's at. Jolly B? Jolly B? Jolly B? Jolly B? Jolly B? Jolly B? I don't think so. Jolly B should ask that guy. In case of fire, it's right about me. It's just one of the boring things. I hope Glenn is at work today? Yeah. The barber. Hope Glenn is at work today. I got an elevator operator. Second mom. Second mom. What does that Jolly B?

You would think they have more directories? Huh? More directories where you can like a man with all the stores. I think they have their actors. And their locations. In the first floor I think. Lower ground. They should have it on every floor. Is that it right over? Maybe they look here. You're right. I'm running over here. Huh? From the Sly CR. I'm going. I'm going to use it. I got to shut it off again. Yeah I like the connection between my environment andグラ! I was thinking that there were slums in the middle of my head but our구나 was popular. And there was not a single thing where the horn came out. The horn back ininky cars. All my photographed stories said there were rumors about the cars so I thought they were a horn that came out while I was driving. Yet now I'm tired. The adults are chasing me. In the last few years, the kids should have was food and food. Here we go. It's gotta be right around here somewhere, but Do we walk right past it? Here we go we found it.
