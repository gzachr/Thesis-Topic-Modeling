Welcome to my vlog

From the bottom
Hello guys, so this is another travel vlog here in the beautiful Samal Island in Davao del Norte
So in this video we have a visitor from Cagayan de Oro
My aunt April and her son Shan
And my two other cousins
Carl and Mayumi
So from Cagayan de Oro
They traveled for 4 hours in a bus going to Davao City
And from Davao City
They took a barge ride going to the port of Samal Island
Which we waited
And we picked them up
By the way guys, it's their first time to be in an island
They live older life in Bukidnon
Which is mountainy and far away from any beaches
I've seen them like 3 years ago
So I was very excited to see them and tour them around the island
It's so dark
Let's take a photo
OK
Let's take a photo
Spicy
I haven't take a picture yet
You look dull
Why?
Let's take a photo
Will this be our next vlog
This is very dirty
So where is the other camera over there
Other side
Can you take a photo
Let me get it
Huh?
Where is it? Where is the path?
There
Okay, let's go bro!
I'm so excited!

I'm going to tell me now, I guess I've never known
Losing almost all my energy
Organic
F**k
I'm really scared
Now guys, we plan to go to this nameless falls just a walking distance from my stepmom's house
Only the local people know this place and it's not that famous in tourists
But I heard now recently that there's a lot of tourists visiting the falls
And so we brought the local kids with us since they know the way
And I just called it nameless because it doesn't have a name yet
So if you're planning to visit Samo Island, you might explore these falls
And I guarantee you it's going to be quite an adventure
It's so cold
I'm injured
We're going to the falls
You don't like it?
Ouch, I hurt my head
Wow, it's nice here guys

Very beautiful
It's still nice
