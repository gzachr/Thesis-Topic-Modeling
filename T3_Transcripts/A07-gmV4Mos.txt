 Good morning guys and welcome back to another day. Good morning guys. Thanks for coming back to the channel. We appreciate it every single day you guys have shown us. So much support. I would have to be here in Sibu. We had a great light last night. Today we've got a fun day plan today. We're off to the other murals. They've got two branches. We've kindly been invited by the owner there for breakfast. Hopefully coffee. And then we meet a coffee. Yes, we meet a coffee. And then we meet a lot of people today. We meet a birdie. We meet our graphic designer. He lives here. So we're going to meet up with him because we've been working with him remotely online for months now. Haven't met him in person. So taking the opportunity as we're in Sibu to meet him. Which would be great. And then we've got an actual meet up with you guys. We should roll some TV intro music. Yeah, they're going to be like, coming up on the show. Tonight. Then we've got an actual meet up with some of you guys. We told you that we're doing a meet up here in Sibu. And I hope you will see some of you later. Yeah. We're excited for that. Then we'll start with seeing Claire again. Oh, drop my ring. We're seeing Claire. We're seeing Claire. And we're going to do something fun with her. So we don't know what, yeah. Let's see. We're not sure, but we want to vlog. Thanks for clicking on the video. Yeah. Today is like a lot of people are still going to the cemetery and everything. So expect no traffic. It's not good. But most of the malls are going to be open again tonight. But not a lot of restaurants be opening. But the shelves are a lot of things closed. Yeah. But it's like Sibu's becoming a tourist destination. So there's going to be the night places that are going to be open. So we have arrived at Murals. I've noticed straight away that they've got a daily grind here. There's a coffee shop called the Daily Grind. It seems to be one on our Murals hostel. It seems to be linked. So we're going to quickly eat there. Then I'm just going to run off into here. I hope no one notices. I really appreciate it. Oh. It's hot. It's really nice to be here. This is hot. We'll see you in the next one. Have a good day. This is the Corsair Corrie. We got it. Next to me too. Nice place. Very cool. It looks really cool. I love the mugs. I love the mugs. They're like cats. I love them. Some pick up the mugs. They're like three-nose. For you I'd make it a rainbow. I think I would be holding on to. I think that I know this all. Love is blind and no one's perfect. Climb up and seem so shallow, shallow, shallow, shallow. But you were bright, why I go. We call off logs a day in juice. I think it's like similar. So you should like, that's where we are. I'm drinking a coffee right now. So the daily grinds are coffee shop here. Where there's a murals, there's a daily grinds, right? That sounds like where there's a world there's a way. For you to say the phrase. We love that because we call the day in juice. Really good coffee. We're in everyone's suboo now. Reliable coffee spot. We know you guys like to hear about where we're drinking our coffee. The day you grind. Make sure you get that. I'm going to order another one of these straight away. Delicious. Hi buddy. How are you? Good to see you. Good to see you. Good to see you. This is the day already. I haven't seen you before. Have a seat here. You two meet. Exactly. Finally all together. Very productive meeting happening here. 11.13 a.m. We're heading off to our meetup in about 20 minutes. I'm very excited for that. We're here and what the meetings about. Yes. We're talking all things graphic design, all things colour things, all things new projects, which we'll be sharing with you guys very, very soon. But very excited. 2020 is going to be a big year, very big year. Loosen our considering cloning ourselves. So we can get it all done. We need like two of us. Birdie is very kindly driving us to the meetup in styles. It's nice ride. I'll just drive, yeah. So we are looking forward to meeting some of you guys. But we do have a slight issue because. We do this every time. Where do we? Oh yeah, Illinois. There were two fountains. And we fit for meet at the fountains. And then some people went to one fountain. Some people went to another. We've done it again with Abaka Baking Company. We said meet at the IRL Centre near Abaka. Realises there's two Abakers at IRL Centre. And the meetups in 30 minutes. So we're going to get there, take pictures, put it on our stories, put it on the community to have one YouTube and hope that people see that. And don't think we've not turned up for our own meetup. Fingers crossed, fingers crossed. Sorry if you went to the wrong place. It's a good day. Tonight, the guys here have also invited us to an acoustic night. So Boo's known for guitars. I really want to get, hopefully we'll get time to check out a guitar story or two, whilst we're here. But you're going to jam tonight, aren't you? It would be cool. It would be cool they would be invited us down. Apparently some of the guests play a guitar and stuff. So we'll see what happens tonight. We're very excited for that. We can invite Claire to that as well. Hello. Bye. Thanks for having us. Thanks for having us. See you soon. Thanks, my lady. Thank you. Let's try and find Abaka. See? So I'll just say, there's one of the tickets around. There's one of the corners. I think it's over there. Got you guys. Luc and I have just arrived at Abaka. If you're coming down to say hi to us, we said we'd be here for like an hour. So if you're in the area, fans are coming along to say hi. Make sure you make it this place. I, Alistair, Tarrist is Abaka Bakery. It's one of our favorite little coffee shops here in Suboo. Abaka Bakery Company. Mike told us about this place. I'm here every time we're in town. Hi. Hi.

Yeah, we got the yesterday. We're in your right yesterday. Yeah, yeah, we're enjoying it. Really, really cool. We like Suboo a lot. First little wave of people. Very nice people. So sweet. We love meeting people at what's up. It is a real life. We're the same to Rory. We read comments and we speak to people in the comments. But it's nice actually putting a piece of the name. And we like to actually have a proper conversation with people. We see the numbers and we see the comments and the DMs. And it's like next level means someone in real life who enjoys what we do. Even if one person enjoys our videos makes it worth us making them. So thanks so much. If you can say hi. My girlfriend is a big friend of yours. Oh, thank you. Yeah, she's working in Ireland. Oh, Ireland is a nurse. Yeah, I would love to meet you. Yeah, I would love to meet you. Hi, Nicky. Sorry you can't be here. Yeah, sorry we couldn't meet you.

Yes. I'm thinking it's a play between your names. Correct. I got it! You're right. It's really, it's a joy to see you. Juicy, exactly. People don't realise that. Actually my little sister Jasmine came up with that. Yeah. Because we started YouTube like four years ago, four or five years ago. And we needed a name. And she was like, Oh no, we had the name before we had a YouTube channel. Because she bought us a little teddy. And we said, what are we going to call it? She said, oh it's called Juicy. And we said, why Juicy? She said, oh Jordan Lucy. Oh those two. So then when we said, she was like eight years old. Yeah. And when it was time to make music names, people were like, oh you do see it. Let's use Juicy. Juicy, the Juicy vlog. The Juicy vlog, okay. Oh, okay. And then it just started to start to stuff. So you were right. Yeah. These guys bought us this. Kalamanzi and honey, right?

So that's what I love about the vlog. And Mike and Nelson's one way. Yeah. Okay, be right. We just talk about what we see and what we experience. Yeah. We just love it. It's just, yeah. We love the country. It's a favorite country in the world. Anything you thought was loving for that reason. Yeah. It's very different if you see somebody just using the idea of traveling, just for the likes of what they're going to be. Oh, yeah. You guys, you really enjoy being here. Yeah. We really enjoy meeting people. So we see that through. I think you can tell on YouTube if people are really happy. Yeah. We just love it.
