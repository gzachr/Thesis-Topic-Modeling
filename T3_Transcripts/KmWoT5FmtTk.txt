welcome back to pinoy planet today I
will make coca-cola chicken let's start
okay so let's start by marinating the
chicken I'm using chicken legs
ginger, garlic
and some other ingredients that I will
be showing you. We are using this bowl.
okay so first let's chop the ginger or
luya in fine slices
so the marinade...I recommend at least one
hour to marinate the chicken if you have
the time best is to marinate it
overnight so today I will marinate for
several hours so we're also chopping up
some cloves of garlic I'm using five
cloves today for four chicken legs
and we gonna chop it up very fine
okay so we're gonna use four chicken
legs
there we go I'm gonna add the ginger
and also the garlic
okay so we're gonna use a good amount of
black pepper
oil
this will help with getting more flavor
next will be the juice of half a
lemon
bit of himalaya salt not too much
because we're gonna use soy sauce as well
next is soy sauce
and finally of course the coca-cola
guys this is the marinade I will massage
it in and then we're gonna leave it for
several hours and we'll be back see you
soon
OK the chicken has been marinated for
several hours so in the mean-time I
chopped up some onions
let's add the chicken legs
while the chicken is getting nice crispy
golden-brown we're gonna add the rest
of the marinade
some extra salt
lemon
we gonna cover this,
reduce the heat leave it on for about
30 to 45 minutes or so
it has been 20 minutes so I'm gonna add a little bit more coca cola
then we cover it and wait for another 20 minutes
I'm going to add a bit of corn starch to the
sauce
this will make the sauce really nice
and thick it's time for plating guys so
I got some nice white rice, chicken
then it's time to add the sauce
nice thick sauce
okay guys
