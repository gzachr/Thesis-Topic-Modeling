 So one of the things that is just great is snacks. And we've heard that Filipino snacks are delicious. So we're going to pop over to the King of Corn convenience stores and get some snacks. There's loads of 7.11s dotted all around Manila and we're quite lucky. Literally right by our hotel, we've got a decent size one. It's always a little adventure getting to be 7.11. And this is how we do it. Yeah, there we go. There we go, the kareos. Let's go and see what lovely Filipino delicacies for snack delicacies we can find. You keep your servant saying honey bone. So first things first, we need to keep him entertained so we do our shop. Thank you sir. Sorry, we're going to try out some crisps right. We know that Jack and Jill is a local brand. Sour cream and onion. Thank you. Ooh, looks like there's some chili cheese flavour here. What is traditional Filipino snacks like Chris which is like a Filipino brand? How does it taste like now? This one, I'm sorry. Okay, we've got a big bag of sour cream for 63 pesos here. So we've got this small packet so that'll do right? What chocolate is Filipino brand? Loan. Cloud night. Oh yeah. Thank you. Cloud night nom. Ooh, that looks good. It looks like a masper. Oh yeah. Choco mocha. Oh, chocolate mocha. Oh, nice. Thank you so much. I like the sound of that. We've got nips here. White chocolate. Ooh yeah. Ooh, they look good. So we've got chocolate mocha. Cloud night overload. Jack and Jill nips. Yeah. Looks like M&Ms. Oh, this one's caramel. Not Chris, that sounds good. This one, Kit Kat Chunky I think this is. So this was made in Philippines. Gaya, mint milk chocolate. That looks good. Yeah, cake. It's good. Okay, let's get that. Let's get that. Let's get that. I think that's everything. Let's pay and see how much this will cost. Oh, wow. Ooh, girl. So a whole basket full of snacks cost 443 pesos. There's a lot of sweets. A lot of sugar rush. And maybe an onset of diabetes. But let's go and check the snacks out. Let's go. Wee. That lady in 711 was absolute sweet arch. She kept coming back towards the low the different recommendations. Absolute legend. If you're watching it, thank you so much. Come on, wee. Time, time. Walking past with my Filipino snack. Eee. Eee. Three weeks later. It's snack time. Oh, we're so excited. That we've all gone on time. I think the ice cream is not feeling too well. Oh, he's a bit poly, isn't he? To get him feeling a bit better, we've got a whole load of snacks here which he is going to eat now. Which one do you like to drink? Dr. Mocho. It's got a halal written on it. We like that. I am so excited by the way, guys. To try these Filipino snacks. Here we have it. It's Miller. You go, he's giving it a good bite. Okay, I'm going to go in for it. There's a bit like a lion bar that we have in the UK. I like that. That is very close to a lion bar. Really love that chocolate. Should we go in for the Fudge Bar next? Unfortunately, it did get a bit flattened in the bag on the way here. So let's just give it a try. Oh my god. That is, I mean, this would have been a bit more fluffier if it didn't get flattened in the process. Look at that. Wow. Right. What is soft? Proper soft. Very, very, very nice. Right, next one on the list, we have some crisps. With that. This is what I mean. I'm trying to pick it. He's going through the gym this guy. Let me give it a try. That is soft. That is so nice. So what we have here is sunshine, crunchy green tea. What is that natural? So what I think these are, you should basically carry it from the fallen like this. You have a little opening there. Oh, nice. Oh, they are like just peas. Yep. And they've got some sort of like powder on them. Vegetable oil and garlic flavour. Oh my god. These are very, very nice. Hmm. Let's go for the coconut. Oh. These are the ones that were like, smarties. White and orange one. Oh, white chocolate. Orange orange one. White chocolate smarties basically. Yes, of course. Very rich taste because of the white chocolate. Chili and cheese flavour chipy. The American's called this pig. I think it's a pretty decent. Hmm. Oh, should be nice. I feel like I need to go for these ones. Yeah. The lady at the tail, she was selling those to make sure you get these. And they're called Paul Baron. We're going to go for the classic first. Classic first. Oh, I can see what he actually smells like. And let's see if he can taste any good. Do you want to try? No white inside. Hmm. Very different texture, very interesting. Oh, it's vanilla. It's kind of like mousey mouse. It's got an interesting crumbly creamy texture to it. Sort of like a dry, creamy texture. I think compressed milk powder, that's what it is. So, it's about a few weeks later after that last scene. And what happened was the karea, all of a sudden, felt really, really poorly. He came down with a fever. He was really ill and we literally spent, I think the next two days in bed was it. But now... I hate the karea's bed. And to be honest, I was getting a bit of a sugar rush. That was the last beer, that you tried. The rest of the sweet sandwich, we've got a few left. I am going to go in with this sauce. Take it. Take it. The wrapping is very tough. When you come to the Philippines, he wants it. Right, go ahead and try it. But it's very similar. Take out chokyum. Never white you. I really like that. Hmm. I'm trying the next next. He not the last one. Hoping he's the like, evidently the mousey mouse with wolf face. Oh yeah, exactly. Okay, I'm going for a cloud nine meal. I'm going to say it's very similar to a snacker. Not even a hungry cloud nine. I even got a good time there. So we've got another pole baron or pole baron I think. And this time it's the ube flavor. Oh yeah, it is. It's very crumbly and this one is... Oh yeah. Ha ha! Purple is... Definitely got like a taste of ube. It's actually been nice. So this is goya... Winter chilled. I love air off of the menu. So if there's anything like that, I... I love it. Oh, as soon as you open it, you get the wiff of the mint. Ah. Hmm. Oh, I see those bits in there. There's little bits inside it. Oh wow. With every single snack that we've had so far. It has been really, really, really nice. Last one we got now. Oh, we got normal snacks left. Last one we've got here. Cloud nine gold. There's a chocolate in the UK that's very similar to this. But I don't remember what it is. Okay, don't say it. Let me try. I'm not adding anything like that, but it's been able to eat. Oh, look and say it to me. I'm putting in chocolate looking at my black trousers. Otherwise, you'll see all the stains. The case is not even long. It's been able to put a good time. He's just over there right now. Hmm. No, what? If you have good slip Philippines, do you not? Miss out on these snacks. I'm glad I didn't find out. I think that because I literally could have bought unsan pound if I knew. Really got me enjoyed this video. It's like, I'm so curious. And I should have brought us. Oh.
