starting off you know Mikey register starting off his channel I wanted to take the time to talk about my humble beginnings for those of you that that don't know I know I've gotten a lot of new subscribers throughout this last year and you might not know my backstory so I want to share I too like Mikey Rogers started off my channel wanting to share my experiences with food my life I honestly started it as a hobby just to distract myself from the anxiety and depression that I was dealing with at that time and I never ever imagined that I would be doing this as a career oh my god I know a lot of the haters are gonna be like career yeah why you sitting here laughing at me thinking you're hurting me honey I'm laughing all the way to the bank baby to the loop anyway so yeah I just got into the groove of it in the beginning when I first started my channel I had maybe 40 40 subscribers over like six months my channel was just not getting out there and I honestly got this motivated so I took a break off YouTube I started my channel in January 2017 and I stopped doing YouTube for like six to eight months I started off as a hobby but I kind of wanted to turn it into something more you know during the partner program nobody was really watching my videos I was coming into myself and I remember the first time I went live I think I still have it up I went to on reddledo socials maybe like two or three people popped in and said hello and that was it now we do these live streams and we get anywhere from six seven eight hundred people on a good day you know so it's a it really you know things changed but I just had you to give it a second chance I said let's do YouTube let's give it another try so the second time I came back and my videos started doing good I started doing lots of live streams mingling with other people networking I've been a good time you know and then I will give credit to someone that believed in me in the beginning when no one else did I don't really mention her because and again I'm not trying to start drumming anything I have love and respect for her but views on the road if you guys go back you can see that we she was my first ever collab on my channel and at the time I think she had like 45 thousand subscribers I had like 1200 and she you know came into my life stream one day and wanted to do a collab in high-wast floor because I looked up to her and I was super excited I'm like this is a huge youtuber and she's taking a chance on me wanting to collab with me I was like what oh my god so then yeah we coordinated and we did a collab and after that my channel just took off from my 1200 I was already at like 2500 within like a week or two and then it kind of plateaued a little after that but it was steady still gaining some momentum but yeah I had to give credit even though like I don't know what happened shortly after that you know we were cool we would you know talk to each other here and there through VMs and and hey I mean that hey I mean go you know this and that after that I got so busy what my channel that I didn't even notice I hadn't heard from her for a while so when I go to message her one day to you know just see check in and see how she is I was I don't know if I was blocked but I was removed off I gee we were no longer friends never got an explanation never know why I really admired her and her sister and I have to say I was really hurt I don't know if I said something she didn't like or if the vibe was off after that I was in a very different place than than I am now you know so I don't know she's something just rubbed her the wrong way I don't know but I have no ill feelings for her I don't know how she feels about me but at this point I wish her all the best and I give her a lot of credit and kudos for taking a chance and believing in me because after that collab she changed a lot of things for me so Stephanie from views on the road I know you probably won't watch this but thank you girl appreciate you I if I never said that before which I did thank you I want you to know that I am grateful anyway aside from that you know other people took chances on me big channels be loves life if you guys didn't know I did a collab with her like two years ago again at the time I only had like 20,000 subscribers and she had like two million so you know all it takes is just someone believing in you and taking a chance to kind of lend a helping hand and with you guys watching I would love to do that for Mikey Rogers if you guys can really go show him some support and and love I
