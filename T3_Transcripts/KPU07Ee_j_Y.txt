so today we're in mulbaugh and we're 
gonna go head out i was driving earlier  
and i ran into these beautiful country 
roads this is my first time out here in  
the country so i'm gonna go drive 
down some of these country roads
okay so here we go i got my handy dandy new 
microphone so hopefully the noise works out
but yeah i mean look at it it's just so 
gorgeous so this is gonna be a little  
bit different of a video i'm just going to 
drive and try to talk the whole time just  
to kind of make it somewhat entertaining 
man i hope this camera i mean look at the  
contrast between the yellow arts between 
the white and the and the blue skies and  
beautiful countryside nice pile of wood you can 
smell that wood it smells fresh oh crossing goat
some other goats here hey  
say something to the camera please goats are 
just grazing we must keep the shrubs back
there we go got a dog up here on his patrol
k9 unit flirt
you know it's funny some of the police vehicles 
i've seen here they're they're they're police  
vehicles see k-18 they don't say k-9 they say 
k-18 so i'm wondering if those are just like  
some super bad maybe they got double dogs or they 
got like a super dog so it's not canine it's k-18
but personally this is actually my first time 
driving out on the roads like this i i kind of  
stumbled in this way earlier and uh got a nice 
tricycle coming up and i was like man i turned  
around i'm like i gotta i gotta go and grab the 
microphone and just make a video about it you know  
it's just so nice it's always best to give a true 
honest first impression too because a lot of times  
you know you're kind of having to pretend 
we got mary there nice little shrine
i think these are like banana banana trees
got a local scooter here
so yeah these roads are nice it's 
funny it's like ironic because these  
country roads are nicer than the 
city roads beautiful house there
and i wonder why that is i wonder if this is 
just coincidence just because of this area  
there's a lot of tourism here so there's a 
lot of resorts maybe up and down this road  
like dive resorts and stuff so maybe 
that has something to do with it
not too sure though we'll 
see where this road leads
you got a little gambling spot there
so i'm really hoping this mic works 
out because the wind's blowing  
there's another youtuber that i like 
to watch his name is patty doyle  
he's based out of thailand and he said and he does 
a lot of these motovlogs and and rides around he  
said the best setup he's gotten so far is these 
little lavalier mics that you clip onto your
onto your body and they um and it keeps the 
noise muffles that all the the wind out and  
picks up your voice nicely so i hope that's 
the case hope you're right paddy doyle
yeah anyways if you're watching my videos i 
appreciate it uh youtube's very difficult uh  
it's hard to keep getting views and 
there's so many youtubers now and  
people have done all these things a million 
times so you really have to make good videos or  
you got to be consistent and my videos are 
pretty much basic about as basic as they get  
so oh we got a fork in the road here 
let's see if i remember where to go  
should i go left or should i go 
right oh i think i'm gonna go left
i think i'm going left
oh nice little bar or something 
here bb b12 triple b12
wow nice view here
so anyways like i was saying um yeah so i'm 
almost at 3 000 subscribers wow look at these  
clouds look at these clouds here i hope this 
camera picks it up look how nice that looks
i don't know but i'm almost at 3 000 subscribers 
and i'm going to go live once we hit 3 000. i  
figured maybe it's not really worth it until then 
because i'm enough to be too many people that'll  
watch it so i've never done a live anything on 
social media so i'm curious to check it out so  
if you watch my videos and you're not subscribed 
i would appreciate it if you did subscribe this is  
actually my first time ever saying that in a video 
i never say hit the like button hit the subscribe  
i just never say it maybe i should leave in the 
comments if you think i should or if it's even  
honestly effective we'll see i think maybe 
it is at some points but it's hard to say  
i've watched videos of youtubers talking about you 
know they're like just make good videos and people  
are subscribed if they want to because because 
i'll be honest with you i've been guilty myself  
i've watched a ton of youtubers and not subscribed 
so now that i make videos though whoever i watch  
consistently i always subscribe because uh 
it really is the one thing that helps out hey  
here's the one thing that that uh 
that that helps out you know um  
so man that was a guy that dude was from america 
i just passed by so i saw him on these country  
roads um but anyways yeah it really it is 
the one thing these videos are free so that  
is the one thing that helps the youtuber is like 
the video and comment and subscribe because it  
it it um it adds feel to the fire it messes 
with the youtube algorithm and gets it you know  
gets it interested say ooh people like this 
video and you know they want to watch it so
so there's this beach i think i'm going to run 
into this beach it's called white beach and it's  
supposed to just be an amazing amazing beach i 
was thinking about maybe going there today i'm  
not sure though i might go there tomorrow we'll 
see i kind of i don't really have too much battery  
for my drone and my camera so i hate to go there 
and then not be able to film it got a coconut tree
oh we got a gentleman here coming 
up here he's got some chicharrons  
and some rice cakes cakes 
yes sir let me ask him here
is that pig sir pork pork 
skin yeah yeah nice nice okay
yeah oh yep uh chicharron pork skin i 
grew up eating those i like the spicy ones  
i actually love the spicy ones oh we got 
here we got a little community coming up here  
something going on it's like the local store 
oh the local basketball court hello hello  
hi guys hey what's going on
it's the local uh i think 
that's a local basketball court  
if you didn't know looks like a nice 
lady maybe coming home from work there
if you didn't know philippines national sport 
is basketball they are avid basketball fans  
they love the nba they're all up to date they got 
their own nba here their own professional league  
and they're up to date on the nba here 
steph curry is is uh is the man here in  
the philippines and i think he's probably 
the most nba popular nba player right now  
i'm not sure though let me know in the comments if 
that's the case where the filipinos watching this
yeah you know what's funny um for all the 
filipinos watching this or even everybody  
else there's a lot of the jeepneys if you've seen 
the jeepneys here they got like cool designs you  
know they they paint them they customize them 
oh we got a cow here grazing nice see look how  
nice that is a little sorry sorry store and uh 
they personalize them and they make their own  
like styles like the one i saw one in cebu city it 
was the the chick i think it was the chick carrier  
like that was the name of it the chick carrier 
like carrying women i don't know it's funny but  
then they got like different designs and some 
of them have religious paintings on them and  
and and i think there and they're everywhere by 
the way so you know they have those those channels  
on youtube where they they commentate all the 
flights that are flying in and out of the airports  
and i think it'd be really funny to do that 
with the jeepneys just kind of stand on a busy  
street corner and say like you know here comes 
christy's carrier coming in and here comes uh  
you know uh jesus ronaldo the third coming 
in from whatever wrong guy you know just  
just yelling them out just like flights how they 
come in and being like that's a full low today  
you know or the driver looks tired today 
maybe he was up late drinking sand mcgills  
and i think that would be really really funny 
um we got some beaches our club serena resort  
a couple kids walk in and i think that would 
be hilarious there's probably a filipino that's  
done that and if there isn't they should do that 
because uh i think that would get a lot of views
so where are we at we're at 10 minutes now so
we'll see i'm gonna be amazed if anybody 
watches these videos i mean honestly i mean  
me talking for 10 minutes i don't know who's
