 I'm going to the market. I'm going to the market. Are you selling the kitten? It's me, big boy. 200 pesos for the kitten. Yes, you're selling it? Yes. Okay, let's go. It's coming back to Australia with me. Me? Yeah. All right, we're at the famous Old Bull street markets. I think the first thing we're going to do is find a beer and it's quite these girls are laughing at me. You laugh at me. Here's the first! Twin! I'm not sure this. I'm going to have it. It's full! Give me your money. You want food? I will buy you food. I will buy you food. They've got everything here. I need to see food. And it's so much cheaper than in the city. The skin is following me. What do you want to eat? What food? Which one? Which food? Can I get one of these? How much today? 20. So cheap. It looks beautiful. We're going to see how much. How much is the pork? So 20 for one? And what's this? Chili oil? I'm going to use it. She can still have my friend following me. What is this? It's like an eating snack. It's spicy. Do you want one of these? Does he want one? We didn't get that. We don't have any. And this one. This one? This one. This one. I want some. These are fine. So as I said, I was going to look for a beer. And what differs this sort of night market is in Thailand. There's beers everywhere. There would be a lot of little store selling beers. But I guess because you know I'll add a drink walking around here. And Phil means it's against the law that they don't have as many drinks around. But you know me, I will do my best to find one. Hopefully I can find one somewhere. Yeah, we're going to try out our kebab. I should have got something a bit more weird like this. This intestines, whatever it is here. But I'm just going to put a standard pork today. We're going to see what it tastes like. I think I'll be in time. I know it's going to be really hot. I will wait for this one to cool down. There you go. Please. Okay, time to review it. The pork skewer. Good? It's good. It's really good. Duck. Duck. That is duck. Yeah, it's one of the black ones. Like the baby duck. Oh, like a duck fetus. Yeah, I knew it. Wow, okay. Are we going to eat it all? You can try it. Try it. Okay, okay, I'll get one. Okay, baby. So, apparently it's duck. Yes, I've never seen duck look like this before. Okay, so here is my baby duck in a cup. This is absolutely boiling and it looks disgusting. But, you know, I'm here to try new things. I can't do it actually. Well, is that normal? Yeah. Swallowed. And you just put that whole thing in a chewy. Mm-hmm. How is it? No, I can't. I can't do it. This is crazy. It's disgusting. It tastes like duck. It's like duck. It's like duck. It's like duck. It's like duck. It's like duck. It's like duck. It's like duck. It's disgusting. It tastes like duck. I'm done. Get me something nice in my mouth right now. It's disgusting. It tastes like chewy, rubbery egg, but then it's got little bits of the duck growing in there and duck feathers growing in there. See? There's a hair. Yeah, there's hair. I'm done with that. But I did try. I've always wanted to try one of these twisty potatoes. I've never done it. I've always seen it on vegetables. I've never tried it. So we're going to get one. So I need to get this duck feed. It's OK. Out of my mouth. Yo, yo. Can I please get a twister? Tater twister? We bought some food for one kid. The word is out. Dan, I look like Jesus and I'm here to feed everyone. We're just going to go hide. I can take a little here and try this. It's an inshieldal taste. It's just like duck. It's just like duck. It's just like duck. It's just like duck. It's just like duck. It's just like duck. It's just like duck. It's just like duck. It's just like duck. It's just likeismo duck. It's just like pubgara and I'm going to have plenty of analyzed dishes. This is going to be the best signals I've had for dinner, happiness and peace. I'm going to have a snack too. I'm going in the afternoon, waiting or so I'll feed everyone. That'll be a something really big and a social puntos that everyone has a colleague who likes to have flights in one backpack when he likes it. With quilting and<|lt|> we'd say Myï¿½ting a nice morning breakfast that's been mommy's breakfast. This is going to be nice for my uncle. I'll have some groceries as well. It pretty much just tastes like this sea salt flavor. Really good. A more crunchy. Oh cucumber, rock melon. Never seen this. Never seen this. Dragon fruit. Dragon fruit. Oh watermelon. We got watermelon. One watermelon. It's a good thing. 65. Alright we're going to try the watermelon juice. I'm scared because of the ice in it. Like what if that is just tap water? Made into ice. I'm going to get really sick. So what we're going to do, we're going to trick it really quick before we get a chance for the ice. Actually better still. Hold this. This is what we're going to do. We're going to strip the ice out. Yeah we're going to scull it. Before we get a chance to get sick. I'll tell you what. We have the beef liver. I just had one of the most disgusting things ever. Hope I'm not doing it again. I'll just pretend it's normal. Oh it's my house. It's alright it's just a lot more chewy. I wouldn't get it again. I'll eat it. I'll eat it because I've got it but yeah not not a fan. Actually you know what I'll probably just eat one more bit. Yeah. No it's no good. It's going the bin. Alright I'm done. We've been eating all these weird foods. I've had enough baby duck. I've had enough liver. It was time to get something more nice. Some ice cream and the ice cream here looks absolutely crazy. They've got crushed up Oreos. They've got snickers crushed in one or kind of things. But look at this. This is crazy. Go everything here. I'm thinking of brownie maybe or probably our love Oreo. Or Kit Kat. Alright we're going to go for the Kit Kat. How much are they? How much are these? One hundred and three with the magnet and one hundred and three with the ore. Oh what's this? About something else. Ice cream. Okay. It's getting pretty serious. What else we got? Okay. Got the Kit Kat. But it does look like a picture. We're going to do it. We're a little bit up. Okay. It's getting close off. Yeah. Okay. That looks pretty good. We're just going to go to a comparison. Yeah. I think that passes the test. This is the moment of truth. How do they stuck up? We're just going to lean this over here on the table. Too taught. Is this yours? Too taught. It's too late. It's too late. It's too late. It's too late. It's too late. It's too late. It's too late. It's too late. It's too late. It's too late. Good. Let's see. What's this? It's bulky. It's sticky. Yeah. Do you wait this? Red stick with the chocolate. Oh. I thought that was like a cabab stick. You can eat it. It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good. It's good. So, yeah. Definitely check out this food market. It is next level. Why did everything just go quiet? But that's good. Get here. It's better than sitting down and eating dinner. Because you can taste everything. It's cheap. And then, yeah. And then finish off. Have a nice Sunday.
