We are in the depths of depths. We are in the deepest depths of the depths of the depths. This is as deep as that. What the f*** is this show? Oh, it has to be GMM, bro. GMM is different. Someone showed me once some GMM memes compilation or GMMA series telenoelas. Oh, f*** is... Why was somebody like me? I was somebody. It was meant, bro. GMM does things differently.

He is the coolest man alive. He's got a new song called the Lulu. It's a song. It's a song. It's a song. It's a song. It's a song. It's a song. If I had to live a life without you, me. Can we talk about that sound of quiet relaxation, though? Oh, so great. Oh. Let's take us where we wanna go. What song is this? I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't.

But nothing's gonna change my love for you. Oh, my God. He needs to do a classic's album. This is how I describe that cover, mate. He's like, top ****. Here's Saloon. This is where you hear him playing in the misinformed marketplace. Seriously?�� cô ? Han dec е ? This isダ so that's I love my She was made to sing soul music. You know what's meant to her? I feel like what happens is they get bored. They start experimenting with so many things. Back home, what happens is we don't sing with karaoke like what was South American Latinos from it. We will dance. You can't dance with stand-lapse, so you will dance with the whole ball that's been drinking for the last three days. And he's like, hey, dance the ball. You know, you would live with the carers through that, because if that was you, you would probably dance it. And every time, you could even walk into the shop, you know, fucking banging something in some salsa, and everyone would actually reward you for that. Like they did here to me yesterday. Because they get bored and stuff, and it's just so culturally intertwined. It's like, what's the thing to do? Sing. Sing. But people don't understand, because some of you might beat from the Philippines. Maybe you're connected to the Philippines. Maybe your mom Filipino, you know, because we got viewers from all over the world. And like, we have a lot of second generation people, like our age. Or like, you know, they're half Filipino and half of European or whatever. And so this thing normal, though. It isn't, though. Even if you grew up like this, it's still not normal. Not normal. Because the fact that it's so common doesn't make it normal. Let's just put that into perspective, yeah? Fuck. Next. One, two. Oh, acoustics. Yeah. I love this intro. The heavens. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.

Teacher. They got them like things back home. We used to wear them as well to write to. Yeah, why don't we call them? We call them carnets in Spanish or in Venezuela. I don't even think that's a Spanish word. What is it called in English? I have no idea. It's a cool idea. Yeah, probably. Yeah, that's the word. Yeah. But it's fantastic because they really are able to like encapsulate that magic that you can do a lot with very little. You don't need like perfect studio settings and stuff or that. Take advantage of your surroundings. There's very good acoustics out there. There's a lot of now hacks that people have discovered through TikTok, you know. The whole ways, the school hallways, the car parking lots, the parking lots, the staircases and certain buildings. Toilets, closets, there's different acoustics in different natural environments. You'll be surprised. Yeah, a lot of people are looking for acoustics in different natural environments. You'll be surprised. Lissima Calpino, you know the girls are ceilings blasted. Ceilings blasted. You know that girl? She made that f***ing the first album. That doesn't have ceilings. But at first they have an album that gets her a little bit of attention. She needs me a minute in a bedroom. There are possibilities out there. Change your dreams. Next. What do you like? Oh, he understands people. He's so familiarized. Oh, he's so familiarized.

Not a paid sponsored ad, but you got to admit. You know your... Hello, yes. You want to deliver it? Thanks, sir. They've really understood the idea behind acoustic music. And the reason why acoustic music was necessary. Still king. Exactly. And especially during the 80s and 90s. Even to the 70s, where you had these big rock bands that required something else. They had to show that they had something else in the bank in their repertoire. Because it wasn't enough to connect with the audience. Labels figured this out through statistics, data and, you know, data's king, I guess. And this was the best way to exemplify that. To showcase that you had turmoil. You had lights and darkness and you had shades and you had new ones. No, and the thing is like everybody wanted to see the bad boy be romantic. A little bit. That's why the romantic rock balance became such... There are biggest hits ever. And it gave way to this. And this, you know, this is awesome. Coach. He sounds a bit like T.O. from Exo. So, my house. Do you hear this? The O's. Like the O. Yeah. He's here to sing. Do he Exo's the O? Oh, what's the name of this song? I forgot. Oh, what's the name of this song? I forgot. Little shy boy out here doing his thing. Oh, the girl next to me is melting. She's melting. She's melting. Come on! She's melting. I don't use the name. She's melting. What? Okay. I love that he was so shy and so like reserved and the whole time he's like you don't really know if he's gonna belt or not or... He's so good. Spotify, Philippines is like we still have this. We also have this on repeat. What? What a cover, mate. Registraria. He's here. What's the name of this song? That is so good. He's got a hair color. Oh, my god. God bless them, larynx. Blessings to the whole of the Philippines. Oh, my goodness. She broke. He went out. It's a good party drink. Because they're in the same register. Very paratrooper. But he sounded cool. It just... He's got a headkynel. He's got a headkynel. He's got a headkynel. Wow. It just shows how comfortable he is singing. And that he's experimented a ton. Because most people think that he showed more of his range or increased the note. He actually hasn't. But it shows like... What do you call it? A chromastic... Dixterity. How fimble you are.
