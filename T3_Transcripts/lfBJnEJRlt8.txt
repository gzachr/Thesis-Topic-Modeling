 But you're Friday. The freshest. These are the moments that are so magical that can only happen in the Philippines. Like there's no other place with this would happen. So this happened a couple of months ago. It's one of the fans at David Foster Concert decided to sing along with a proper mic with David Foster. Well apparently he's got a reputation of like just giving the audience a mic and stuff. He knows his crowd. And I don't know if this can only happen in the Philippines, but I can definitely know that the likelihood of it happening is definitely higher in a place like the Philippines. So let's give it a watch. Hi Gwen, what's your last name? Hi, Dorado. Dorado. Oh, she's going to be an alto. Well, you never know. Translator, she's a pro. She's a pro. She's a pro. She's a pro. She's a pro. Yeah. John Alienstein. Oh. Oh. Oh. So she's not going to sing. There we go. Yeah. This high, right. I sounded good, Jar. Yes. Well, believe me, I guess we met back then, but this is not a set up. I just picked you randomly. Oh, they met already. Oh, my God. I just picked you a random. Oh, my God. I just picked you a random. Oh, my God. That's you. What a voice. David's got. We have done this before. Guys who worked to be a real man. Yeah, no, there's no way. I remember you. I remember you. You were a 10. I remember you. Busted. Busted. I remember you. I remember you. Busted. Busted. Busted. I will do not. 18. No way. 18. 18. Okay. I don't know what to say. They're all laughing backstage. Well, it's nice to see you again. What do you want to sing? Is it okay if I sing it? If I ain't got you. Yeah, girl. Yes, you can. I don't know that song, but. But who do you know that song? Sorry. This is crazy. This is absolutely crazy. One you can pick it up the song you know. Oh, you don't have to know it. No way. Or you could just sing it like a fellow. What would that do? No, please. Oh, my dear. Oh, my dear. Oh, my dear. She's gonna sing it like a出. Do you go? Do you go? You can do it. Please, sir. Oh my gosh, he said she's gonna sing it at the capella. Ah! Yeah. Diva. You put Diva here, sir. You just need to leave her. I'm gonna listen to people who carry her, you'll learn that. Yeah. OK. You know what? You kind of put her here. You're the key. Three, three, three, so many people sing. Freakin' hell, my god. I knew she was gonna be. Oh, come on. So ready. Let's go. OK. Go, go, go, go. Go, go, go, girl. So be good for the pound. Oh no! Oh no! You just came to her concert. Where has she been? She's just attended her concert. What happened? You kept singing. What is this? Go back. OK. You ready the key? So we'll be performing people sing. Yeah. For the fans. So we'll be performing people sing. So we'll be doing this for the fans. Ooh, nasty, nasty girl. So we'll be doing this for the pound. So we'll be doing this for the pound. Just baby, just. So we'll be doing this for the pound. Just baby, just. Listen, listen to me. That is her concert. Give her a percentage. That is her concert. Wow, нетain. And I've been at Burnuth pre. Brownie. And I've been at Berwick. Look, and she's performing Menra! I'm just a shot at her inability to sing at David Foster's inability to know Alicia Keys' songs. Oh yeah, that's actually a great point. That's the main thing you don't know that song, sir. But not that. What's his name? What do you mean, Pinoi fans? She has a name. She has a name. Is it Gwen Dorado? She said it's Seri. Gwen Dorado, that's true. That's true. She's that thing. Should I go go? Please, please do that. Gwen? I'm from the Philippines. Look at him. He didn't even have a clue what that was going to be. I'm 10 years old. I would never know. Oh, we need to. It's never known. She looks. Your 10. She's a child. You've got a lovely guitar there. Thank you. She's, she's, she's, she's, yeah, she's one of the spice girls. She's one of the spice girls. And hold my breath. It's getting water, but we may feel less, so I sit quietly. Don't move me down. What's going on? Hey! Get ready, because I had it off. I see it pull, I see it now. I've got the eye of the sign. Girl, why don't you dance? Loki thought it was Tae-yang. It was Tae-yang, didn't it. Yeah. Wow cool, I like when when he's fire Mad full circle full circle moment. I wonder if she still wants to pursue it or what's going on Maybe she made she want to maybe she focused on education Sing it sing it when She's matured as well a lot in her takes That placing is so nice That is so great that they only clip that clip has a million views do my god when door to have the when is a superstar No bro, she's not just a Filipino fan bro. That's a singer right there. You know what's also interesting like seeing the evolution Instead of causing the previous in her first decision she rushes literally have goosebumps 10 years later She actually learn how to drag how to move back how to sit in the uncomfortableness of the environment Girl she's got that under her belt fantastic And I hope if when and so watching this or someone send it to her when you're a rock star Social media or she is singing or whatever I'll be more than happy to review her songs There's the no-pin invitation I guess and they let us know what you guys thought about it. That was fabulous at the house
