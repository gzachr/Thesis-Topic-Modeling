welcome to night time here in Manila temperatures
are finally cooled off and uh you know what's
a cool fun thing to do at night time in Manila
Star City baby we made it the old amusement
park it is looking awesome so many cool figurines
on the roof there I see all types of copyrighted
pirated images that we're gonna thoroughly
enjoy and not even feel bad about it so all
right avoid the line buy online tickets well
we didn't do that so we'll head in and see
what it's all about all right so just based
on what I'm seeing it really looks like star
pass for 6.99 is the way to go they also have
something called snow world now I think we're
gonna bypass snow world because uh you know
I think for us it's really just all about
the rides but you can see uh this is where
the line skip uh buying your tickets online
might have been helpful oh priority I guess
we could have gone there with the little kids
but all right we're queued up we'll kind of
see what the price is with how they charge
for kids but from what I can tell it's 6.99
for the Star Pass okay so star passes 6.99
is that for all right all of us okay including
him for us how do you want me to oh here oh
I think he's not free go go here lean back
here first yeah over so 6.99 per person okay
once you get past like the little security
bag check nothing's strenuous at all uh immediately
into vendors so there's some flip-flops for
sale you just bought a pair of flip-flops
yeah oh there's a fire wallet oh a magic man
nice like some good Cena you want a burning
wallet yeah tempting tempting so a lot of
times I like the carnival stuff now we are
just looking there are tons of rides for forests
all these in pink right are Forest rides so
we have plenty of plenty of entertain so we'll
head outside see what rides we can find uh
looks looks like it's pretty much a woman
pass you know you're pretty excited to ride
some roller coasters are you gonna go like
extreme or are you gonna go more like Forest
friendly Street ah it's so tempting yeah lots
of people tell it was that cool yeah nice
yeah lots of people uh definitely selling
stuff okay so without really knowing where
we're going I it looks to me like we've just
entered a food court so you've got all this
stuff getting set up for Chinese New Year
uh and then a bunch of yeah a bunch of food
court stuff Steakhouse I see obviously Filipino
cuisine restaurants so we might need dinner
there Cedar are you hungry oh snow whoa I
can feel like the cold air I'm that's all
from snow world so I don't know actually how
we get to the rides I wonder if we went the
wrong way snow world but there's the outside
yeah we got to get out we gotta get outside
sitter somehow oh yes great oh wait hold on
you guys are Saturday oh you got a little
stamp come on oh yeah that's one of the extreme
rides okay now we're definitely like to the
amusement park so we got rides a water log
ride maybe a ferris wheel okay wow great question
is it in order no that was random okay should
we go Lolly swing first guys let's let's hit
the Lolly swing we can all do it together
so why we're kind of chewed up for the Lolly
swing now this might be a pretty intensive
Forest I
I'm not too crazy but it's a little fast yeah
as long as he's sitting with us he'll probably
be okay so you can see they've got some pretty
awesome rides over there wow tons is spinning
I think there's even a roller coaster here
somewhere we'll find out but yeah you can
kind of get the idea we got this oh the cue
is huge actually it goes all the way around
that's the and we're in the end of the queue
that's the beginning of the queue so wow all
right it is uh 6 11.
we'll see what time it is when we uh get through
this it's been 20 minutes uh but we're definitely
getting in on this round Forest you get a
ride with me
okay here we go focus focus I'm thinking we
gotta cut right in this situation yeah cut
right and we're just gonna grab these next
three in a row all right all right all right
got it bar comes down the man's helping from
America yeah pretty excited to be here okay
for us we got it you guys ready okay good
times you ready for this Forest yes and you're
scared you saw Daddy's Hand okay
we can do it we're ready to ride baby
fast
we got this
yeah baby
a good first ride I would say uh next a little
Nostalgia here classic carousel plenty of
uh horses and all that to ride ooh that last
one though made me feel a little queasy we
flew on the airplane so there's a bit of open
right I hope I don't lose it all right here
we go this way okay all right boy here we
go grab some horses
all right boys you take this one
all right guys what do you think
Kelly how you doing back there I'm doing good
classic baby I don't think I've done a kick
so ride for a long time yeah nice amount of
I can't arrived sooner yes
[Applause] I just like when I was at age I
can ride all of them yeah no problem nowadays
I just can't handle that spinning too much
I think do it all the way up until 35.
yeah now I see now that I'm above 40 I can't
do anything like I said like inner ear or
something I have no idea but anyways with
them yeah they're loving it [Applause] so
on that thing you could actually spin that
cart I don't think they know that he grabbed
them yeah yeah is anybody doing that honestly
they're doing it but uh so it's a good ride
tornado yeah I thought like the spinach sauce
like this there's no way I'm out on that but
the answer like roller coasters I can do that
I think I can do that sir I can do upside
down I just can't do around and around over
and over and over and over
how was it really really oh God Peter are
you sure you want to ride that bad boy
wow that's way more intense than one-way Road
11.
I'm not
oh really
here let me adjust your neck ready okay now
go try it that's good all right oh well that's
okay we got some popcorn uh 75 pesos each
bucket and then a water 30.
try cheese all right well that's the way it
goes sometimes Granite do you have your heart
set on it are you like I had to skip forward
strangers
do you want to do it no I'm not afraid for
them oh my gosh
all right I'll go Granite really yeah Granite
let's go I'm sorry Cedar next year next year
one inch you know we measured her up there
and I knew she was like that close but good
on them for following the rules you know that
actually makes me feel like safety minded
that like they're like you can ride but no
no uh know her we'll be like hey buddy oh
you better back up all right so I can't believe
it I'm hoping I don't lose my lunch yeah I
felt a little a little queasy on that with
that little baby ride
this is so scary I was feeling so different
my heart's racing I hear you you're all locked
in yeah okay well we're gonna start any second
[Applause]
okay
oh wow all right turn it off baby
wow that was intense yeah I closed my eyes
for like half the ride wow
keep it together just keep it together wow
you got it yeah for now we are focusing a
little bit more forests and oh where is he
okay he's over here oh I see he's seeing the
dinosaur he's cutting in front of people's
photos
you see the dinosaur where behind my hand
oh you want me to pick you up well let's go
in here and see these dinosaurs as far as
what do you see pterodactyl
here Bud he's gonna run around in here this
place is pretty great oh my goodness it's
fun
or even I mean like I said the whole park
man this is Way Beyond expectation again it's
like a whole range of age levels and skill
level and so it's cool yeah
[Music] it's only charging force it might
bite you
you like that you like this part yeah
all right so we'll spend some time here just
enjoying oh there's the aircon ah it was great
upstairs is a whole nother School rides now
I believe this is the area that's catered
more towards Forest demographic age group
all right
[Music]
here we go you ready okay we might go really
and we're off [Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Applause]
here we go
[Music] how was it wait I'm Cedar tell us
about what just happened [Applause]
to me so too too small for the big ones it's
too big for the small ones oh my goodness
he's so brave he's on the kitty wheel
oh my God he's like oh all right the old Kitty
wheel Good Times there good time [Music]
what was it for us was that fun right by yourself
all right well there's a few more kids zone
kind of rides this way we'll have to check
those out
good time spent a few minutes here after the
little bit of time on the playground now we're
at the ferris wheel and then this big one
here wow it happened again in High Cedar yeah
what's the story little
yeah well the Tippy Toe trick didn't work
uh you know it's so sad because you're one
in Short so close oh wow that's all right
too too small for the big ones too big for
the small ones I'm small for everything my
life I can't even reach the top of the airplane
overhead overhead yeah wow ah it's all right
that's all right well that's okay I'm sure
this summer you will do rides yeah and I'm
sure we can all ride the ferris wheel there's
probably no height on that hopefully yeah
in fact I bet this guy falls asleep okay so
there's two carts here Granite yeah um should
go pretty quick this queue somebody had ice
cream yeah I mean we can go find a treat while
they're uh waiting in the queue all right
so here's kind of a cool concept it's like
a coconut drink they pour in a bottle and
they poke a hole in it with this like poker
it's good sugary definitely some artificial
sugar in that but tasty Forest you want a
little drink [Music]
thumbs up all right here you can hold it you
go see if granite and Mom want some of that
while they're waiting in line so yeah food
here is fairly inexpensive that little coconut
drink was 50 pesos all the water bottles are
like fixed prices 500 milliliter uh 30 pesos
so yeah it's all like a reasonable it's fare
for food all right it's a coconut it's it's
got a sugar in it it's kind of sweet I almost
like a vanilla cook it's pretty good
you guys getting closer and closer getting
closer and closer what's the time [Music]
against on the ride okay well it sounds like
you can handle it I think we can handle it
these fast ones I like because it's like crazy
then it's over yeah they can handle it like
not get too yeah now granted are you gonna
want a hot dog or anything oh yeah please
okay now you're probably gonna not want to
eat it right now so maybe we'll wait so we'll
grab a couple of dogs uh and eat those while
we're in line for the uh Carousel and you
see the no well I mean carousels it never
stops it should be a pretty Quick Queue this
one I think is slower than the carousel but
I was just reflecting on the price of food
everything's pretty cheap oh
no yeah so we've got two two Reds on a set
on a stick with ketchup okay cool this is
your Prime over in front of us is that Casey
there yes
all right so what are the downfalls of this
place is sort of lack of chairs wouldn't you
say see there it's like a big bench area so
we're just gonna pop a squad here granite
and Kelly will eventually work the way passes
they get in line how's the hot dog kind of
hot and a lot of miscommunication with the
lady but we ended up with a uh extra hot dog
which I just slammed but we got the uh cheese
dog and then I think that must be a beef like
the Red Dog or chicken or something but they're
both they're pretty good hot dogs so again
uh 50 each of the red and this little cheese
one was only 40.
so pretty inexpensive in terms of queso spent
okay well we'll hang here until uh Kelly and
granite show up but we should be pretty pretty
soon the queue's going pretty quickly what
do you got what do you guys think two more
two more two more and that's your turn yeah
it looks like it's gonna be a pretty epic
ride yeah
sweet it's your first upside down ride much
taller always you're standing on the rail
way of course eater yeah one inch t-shirt
for the big ones
not fair do you want to donate one inch to
her I'm not giving up anything I'm way too
short that's true all right I bet you guys
are on it too yeah all right they're starting
right about now oh yeah they're in the front
row it's an eye on the GoPro not so great
but there you are they're in the front row
now going up oh yeah
there they come scream when it goes on I have
a hot you guys gonna demo be screaming okay
here they go the big drop
hello oh yeah
oh my goodness yeah so lucky [Music] yeah
there they are hi guys
oh yeah oh man Lucky Ducks huh yeah all right
how was it you guys did you guys scream you're
not screaming and we were first and it was
like going down first before we could see
just the ground oh yeah and we can see the
buildings oh are you freaking out it was cool
to be first though oh yeah that was the first
roller coaster that I went upside down and
that you were the first in the cards
come on you guys live in Manila yes nice it's
our first time in Manila it's awesome what's
the best food in Manila [Music] adobo what's
adobo like pork
chicken I thought you'd say lechon yeah yeah
but you say which one the dollar yeah yeah
okay we'll have to keep an eye out for it
what grade are you guys in you school yeah
eighth grade seventh grade your eighth grade
nice are you brothers or just friends that's
awesome well your city's very beautiful it's
a nice city okay see there you go first and
granted [Music] we got it okay we made it
so all those guys in Lima is like super friendly
so they look like they're going every other
cards they're starting to close it up I think
yeah yeah it's uh so we got about 25 more
minutes before the Park's officially closed
okay
definitely and I like that it's open at three
o'clock so it's already like it's past the
hot yes now we got here at at six that was
awesome yeah now we could have in theory if
we wanted to hit all of them you definitely
need to come a little before six because just
because they cues up so if you didn't come
around like that oh yeah there's like fireworks
and like oh yeah well there we heard like
eight or nine fireworks I don't think it was
this park but we were out of the line maybe
one of those hotels could be a hotel but okay
well we will uh just enjoy this year the last
time anyone remember the last Ferris wheel
we were on yes yes Dubai yeah we had the Lego
pod yeah it was really cool so I'll link that
video right here there oh check out the views
of the city yeah it's looking pretty gorgeous
you can see the Waterway on the World Trade
Center yep they got the glass it's a bit reflective
but it is opening up I mean so just give you
an idea of like like that the whole uh Carnival
area but the water is just beyond that it's
a beautiful city I have uh wow yeah right
yeah I'll say I've been thoroughly impressed
with Manila and that's a cool City yeah yeah
it's walkable people are friendly the food
is amazing there's an awesome like uh Street
culture street food and just people out doing
stuff exercising biking running hanging out
picking you know a lot of people sort of bypass
the big cities like Manila to get to the islands
and that's like totally understandable but
I would certainly budge at least four or five
days in town because there's so many different
areas and neighborhoods to go to and we just
barely scratched the surface of what you've
seen thus far uh but yeah I like the rules
this is okay and this is not yeah don't don't
jump out the window don't go crazy cool okay
everybody well we're almost in the top maybe
we'll check back in the water yeah it's a
beautiful city we are just about at the peak
now because of the light and this kind of
this reflective glass you can't really get
great views but from what we see we get the
whole city light we got the ocean Bay behind
us and this is the peak Welcome To The Top
on top of the world yeah we are yeah definitely
looks less crowded though yeah I think they're
clearing them out so we'll probably hop up
this we were gonna try to get on the log ride
the the water one but it's just not gonna
not gonna happen this time uh Cedar I know
you're holding out for a milk tea so we'll
see if we can't get that done but they might
have closed it up so if they close it up we're
out of here but if not everyone see you in
a few minutes see you well we might even just
see in the next episode we'll see if Nelson's
opened up
foreign [Music]
