 Good morning. Good morning after the run we had. So a lot of thing we could do. I'm going to send a message. It's probably low, got a kidney issue or something. So he's been admitted to hospital so he won't be able to come. So we see what we do after breakfast. Okay, back to the bathroom. Just here a bit of a came up first. It's messy. Great lunch again my love. Yeah, good for side almost finished. We had some french fries with running eggs. Beautiful when I'm a little rest. Cos my back is a bit so scratching, scrapping the plate from the floor. Okay, everything's good now cleaned up. Next step is to do the floor. At first the text on measurement. Yes, who's here? And you're on my door. You're going to help the baby. Okay, nice of clean. You can come in. Peace. Okay. I bought it. I bought it. Okay. She almost redone the bedroom. We got the curtain we had before. She got some new bed sheets. Clean the floor. My desk is still messy. I need to cut the led to size. I need to cut the led. I need to cut the led. I need to cut the led. I need to cut the led. I need to cut the led. I need to cut the led. I need to cut the led. I need to cut the led. I need to cut the led. I need to cut the led. I need to cut the led. I need to cut the led. I need to cut the led. I need to cut the led. I need to cut the led. I need to cut the led. I need to cut the led. I need to cut the led. I'm going to go about this. The 9mm piece is very very heavy. I think everybody is going to go on a fast. Nobody will be reliable. We're going to cut these in two pieces. We're going to cut the led. Everything is going to be screwed on the board. We're going to put this piece here first. We're going to drill all the holes and cut it. If there's an issue with the join or anything, I still got my 4.5mm Hadiflex, which I could put on top of everything, still fit under the door, no problem. That's something I'm contemplating doing. First of all, let's drill all the holes around, especially here, and then cut the board and then we go and place it. Before we do that, I need to sharpen my drills. They're really way very, so quickly it's not funny. I'll show you how I'm doing this. I've got a new one here, just in case. I'll sharpen those two. The cobalt, that's the only drill you can use cobalt for Hadiflex. You can probably use some bronze or whatever you cut it, but they're very expensive. I'll use that and then we'll sharpen. This is what I use. It's a pretty bad state, but that's the one I use, which is to cut steel. I'm going to sharpen with the side of this. I haven't got anything else. Scat your rod. Not the best, but... OK, Robert's visiting again. I'll get a little breakfast. Sammy Gell. It's good. I didn't feel like working today. The Christmas thing happened here. We had a few stops. We went to Russia with you. We were invited by friends yesterday. We don't feel like anything. What do you do? Sorry, the night of Friday night. Saturday night? Yeah, we got the family. We got the family. Only a new year. A new year, nothing? I'm making something. I'm making a buffet. No, no, no. You make your buffet. When? Saturday night, we're not here. If he doesn't run. If he doesn't run. I put a big car park. Me and a motor. Where do you do that? Nightdays outside. The table is built already. I put a roof. Everything is outside. Are you going to invite just friends? Too many. I don't want to live in a family. Good guy. You if you come. I hope not. If he runs, we may come. That's the only problem. We're not sure. If he runs, we can't go to the mountain. We'll stuck here. Anyway, it will be a nice buffet. You don't want to do that for a new year? We'll here for sure. A new year is too far away. I bring the firework. A new year is too far away. We'll take a decision there. No, no, no. What are you going to do? No! She's far away from here. You want to drink? No! She will! Oh, Robert! So bad! Okay, we're going to have a look at Robert's house. I think you'll be interested. Let's go and have a look. Far! Oh, everybody stop. Sorry. No, we're going back to here. We have a whole block all over the way. Actually, a lot of spin-dons is they come back squid. Okay, so we're only doing the full work. Yeah, but this is the second floor for now. We just started doing the playwork for the second. Yep. Oh, hello you! Okay, this is building just stays here. It's a two-floor house, two-level. Two stories. Yeah, that's the floor and the second... Okay. Do you have to do the same thing? I think they will do some scenery. I'm going to shoot. I'm going to shoot. I love this smell of cutty rebar. Nice house up there, the back. I wonder who's in the leaves there. Oh, I always working there too. Oh, no, you're working hard. She's working hard. Wow. Yeah, but they have to put the cement down there. Down there, about eight feet down for the foundation. Yeah. Yeah, that will be the plumbing pool there. A monster foundation. Soon we'll pull here. Good. Ah, a few trees here too. Yeah. That's something somewhere, eh? Is there a road supposed to go there? Yeah. Is there a road supposed to go there, no? No, is there a road there? No. Yeah, there is a road there. But... This used as well, yeah? No. That land on the back is used? No. You see that? No. All the one there. Oh, the end. It's the one on the back there. Okay. Oh. I didn't know it was raising... Cook. Yeah, all those things. A meter. I took over that one too. This is water spinach. You saw the pineapple? It's getting really good on the other side. That's all the cement this... in the play wood. Looked the pineapple. Oh yeah. Nice to be gathered there. Excellent. This is huge. We invited to a buffet at Robus Place, but we're going to the mountain. So, a lesson runs. You see this place here? All this up to the fence of the... Robus, no, on the whole thing. It's gonna be Maya. But from here... it's got your little land up there as well. And everything up to my house up there. Spot the rich people. And this is Royal and Jennifer land. Yeah. They haven't been anything yet, but one day... It's nice. Oh, they bought everything there. But good, good. So I'm going right to the fence there. Okay. So, he went up to the fence here, and then the other 400 square meters up there, done. But... It's not a road here? No more. No, no, no more. I purchased a road, told you. He purchased a road, too. I feel like spewing, but no, I'm not like that. I'm happy for him. He's such a nice guy. I love it. I'm so happy for him. So what I will do, I will do a fence here. Yep. And the fence this side, and at the end, will be another fence. Yep. But it will be a private road, nobody is supposed to come here. There's another land there already on, but nothing's happening. This. This is for the dog. That's for the doggy, yeah? Yeah. I got plenty doggy, if you want some. The male. And the female is at that window. Okay. In the back, the white little... But you know how much wood? I'm up the 2000 piece of wood now. I'm going to put it on the ground.
