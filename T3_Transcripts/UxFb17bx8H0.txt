So, are you planning to go to any island here in the Philippines? No idea. No idea. I don't have a plan. Okay. But I think you should also check the islands. If you come to the Philippines, be some Manila, they have beautiful islands. If you like cold weather, you can go... I mean, this side of the... I mean, Baguio. But if you really want to enjoy the beach life, you go to Boracay. If you go to Shargau, like all these Palawan, actually El Nido, you're going to love it. Trust me, you're going to love it. When you go there for the first time, for me, as a foreigner, I don't really stay in Manila for too long. I prefer to go to the island. And if you get a chance, you can just go and look for it, brother. Thank you so much. Enjoy your staying in the Philippines. Thank you so much. What's your name? Tom. Where you from? Lithuania.

So, I did have some... Sisi, I believe, that's how it's called, yeah, in the past. No, it's good, yeah. I've been... I'm a meat teacher. A big meat teacher. So, I've been enjoying the meat here in Philippines. Okay, okay. Are you willing to try any Filipino snack that we have here? It's just a snack. Yeah, it's a food. Okay. Okay.

Yeah, something I would eat while watching the basil again having a beer, yeah, definitely. Okay, so... So, the last question. Since you have been here for a month, any advice that you would like to give to the foreigner that want to visit the Philippines? Just be open to try new things. Like this one. Yeah.

Okay, guys. See you guys when we have the next group. Let's go. Since you have been living here in the Philippines, what advice would you give to a foreigner that wants to move to the Philippines? Oh. You will love it here because people are very friendly. The place is nice. It's a good place to live. To live. And you know, like a lot of stories that come here because of Ireland, right? Yeah. For you, which one is the best island? Oh. Baraka, Baraka by far. Or shall I go? Or shall I go? Actually, like, shall go for me is the best. Yeah, shall go, man. I love shall go. Okay, brother. Thank you so much. Thank you so much, man. Thank you. Since you have been here before, any advice would you give to a foreigner that wants to visit the Philippines? Are the Philippines? So, before I was coming here, actually, like, there has been a lot of, let's say, false information in regards to the safety here. And I believe that the Philippines is just to save us any other country in Southeast Asia. As long as you take some precautions. So, this is something that I think that the Philippines doesn't drag, doesn't bring the massive crowds with people just because they're safe to concern, right? Yeah. And it's a big deal as long as you take precautions. So, yeah, just, it's a lovely place. You'll be taking care of. There's nice people, beautiful people around here. So, I believe people shouldn't really follow the media and just follow the instincts and enjoy the time here in Philippines. Okay. Before it island in the Philippines. I've only been to one and it's a booth. So, I enjoyed it. It's all you want. You have to check some like Boracay, Palawan and any message to Filipino that are watching us, 20 Filipino that are watching us. A message. Just keep enjoying life. Smile. Keep on smiling. That's it really. Keep the good vibes up. That's it. Thank you so much. Thank you so much. Thank you so much, man. Thank you. And that's how we do. See you guys when we have the next person. Let's go. Make sure that you subscribe. Let's hit that 100k subscribers. I'm pretty sure that we can do this because everything is possible to those who believe. So, let's go. Any advice you would give to foreigners that they want to move to the Philippines or just come and visit the Philippines? My advice when I try to have everything is just embrace the culture. Embrace the people. Embrace the culture norms. Kind of just settle yourself in and follow the people. That kind of thing. That's what I would advise them to do. What about you, brother? I would say have an open mind. Just leave all your preconceived notions behind you. Enjoy the culture and embrace yourself once you get here. Okay. And last one. In message to any Filipino watching eyes right now? Thanks for welcoming us to the country. We look forward to having fun and meeting some Filipino people and just having a good time.
