 I think they took all money I had. The Philippines got the two good, the better, the other can't face them. The whole world. I like the way that I just love this place. Hi guys, Judy here from Philippines. Welcome to my YouTube channel. Tonight let's talk about living here in the Philippines as a foreigner. So tonight I'm here in the street of Makati. And we will ask questions about their experience of living here in the Philippines as a foreigner. So let's go and let's find out. So what was the experience of living here in the Philippines? Very good. Very friendly. I saw. There was many different countries in Asia but you know I think there are a little bit different. Really? Like how? More friendly, more open. Hello, how are you? How are you? I came here three days ago. But I came here for four times. I truly really like this place. People are very friendly. I can speak to you a bit. Because there is no English. And the hospital. So nice. I just love this place. Yeah? Nice? I like it. The Philippines finally has gone. One here? Yeah. So how was the experience of living here in the Philippines? Actually it's too good. So good. How did it still go? It's everything it's good. I'm staying in the Philippines finally. I'm the very sensitive student. I'm the talk of the Philippines. Also you granted already? Yeah. So as a foreigner, what are the pros and cons of living here in the Philippines? We talked about the country. China, Germany. And the other side is too much traffic, too much noise. Too much noise. We had the city. But I was on the island there was... Which island do you... Overkite. Overkite. Can you speak to the Philippines there? I think so. Yes. I wish there were more cats open. Oh, alright. When the people are nice. I like the weather. Because the temperature doesn't change. Yeah. And I like the temperature. And what else? Actually I don't have to pay that much because my voice already has the house. Only when I go to visit places then, what about the hotel? I think it's cheap. Yeah, it's cheap. Yeah. It's cheap than other country and better service. So it's... We are part of the city. But actually, it's very good. Not too much to stay in the Philippines. Very good place. As a legend, it's very peaceful to stay in the Philippines. Anything, hate about Philippines? Hate. Yes, people, if you don't have this one. I think the fruit is... It's... Fruit is in Thailand better. Of course. We said also, like Thailand, like more fresh fruits and all that. And pineapple is the... Maybe. Maybe. Any hate, actually, one thing happened between the last night. I want to go pick a massage for a woman. Just bring me to that place. And then, just bring me in the room and ask me for sex. I said, no, I didn't want sex. How much do you have for it? First, even with good offer, 500. But they took them all money I had. They were like five fruits for the guy. And they look so scary. So, should I go to my wife's house? Should I go to some old place? Yeah, yes. So, it's just like a house or a hotel? It's like a hotel. It's a condo. They were far apart. No, all three of us. All three of us. All three of us. And they were trying to bring more people. Oh! And I got scared. So, I don't want to get hurt by them. So, I had like 10,000, I just given them. No, no, no. Only thing you get about going to the gym. Nothing, nothing. This is very fantastic. You know, all the sweet garlic. Yeah, I can split my garlic very fluently, but not really. Any advice to those foreigners who want to visit here? I might. Yes. Yes. To those foreigners. I want to be in the gym. Okay. Everything here, what else do you want? What else do you want to do? Enjoying the bar. I want to advise the foreigners that they must, because it's Philippines, it's nice. It's very nice here. But they should be careful. Carefully places. And get information before you should go somewhere, go to some food, especially these burger things. Yeah, it's very careful. Especially this place. Yeah. So, places like this, it's so good. Yeah, because this is our red light district. Yeah. Red district. So, other other sites are very good. They can, very good experience with this garlic. Also, the culture of Philippines is also good. I think it's a big English everywhere. So, why you haven't tried the Khenefino cuisine? Maybe I'm gonna try. I'm not being. You know that most of the foreigners always go on a try. But you know, but look, the chicken egg, but with embryo inside. I know. I don't think I'm gonna do that, Lord. No way. No way. I'm enjoying the coconut. I wanna say that they have to take care. It's safe. You walk in the street at any time, late at night. No headache, no household. Wow. Okay. Nice. Really nice. Yeah. Everybody is happy. Actually, I will advise the foreigners to advise the Philippines to see very beautiful places. But the Philippines is too good prepared to other countries. But not so good. But it's good for the whole country. No, yeah. The places in the Philippines are very, very good. The food is very good. I like the chicken. No. I'm chicken, silo, kaya, kumar. Actually, I visit so many places in the Philippines. Like Tagaday, Patanjas, Parcrio and Sabo. I visit so many places. But Manila is too good. And it's very pleasant place. We can visit every place. Yeah. It's so good. Actually, I like to stay in the Philippines. But I already come to my graduation. I already done my graduation. I'm going to travel my country. I already done with my license. But I'm so sad that the Philippines and the culture is too good. And all the people are so happy. They feel free. Like a breath-spreadful. And the food is too good. Very, very simple prices. That's it, guys. If you have any experience of living here in the Philippines as a foreigner, feel free to comment down below. Thank you for watching. See you in my next video. Bye.
