 I'm in Davos City and we have a car. There's a tracer going right there with a legend. Look at that guy, all in the end of Philippines. I love it. One of the best things about driving in this country. You just never know what you're going to see. Bring it on. Come on, it's got two surfboards. We've got a car. Things are going to be really, really good. Let's do this. Oh man. Welcome to Tagham City, Dumbledore Norte. Welcome to what is going to be an awesome five day. Come on, I just pulled a trick. I'm hearing you, soft-spoke. We rented a car using Hertz. Check it out. Dumbledore Norte. Yeah, Tagham City is a really cool highway here. Now the reminder is that we're going to turn off soon. We're going to spend five days exploring the coasts. We're doing it in a car. We're rotating driving. Now we're on, yes. Let's do it, bro. I guess. I guess. That was awesome. Jamming on a tracer. Welcome to Dumbledore Norte. I think a couple of kilometers is a funky little mosque on the south of the road. I want to check out the mission mosque on the road. I'm going to go ask somebody if I can go inside. I have one. Okay, let's go to the mosque. Let's check in and make sure I can go in. Let's go to the mosque. Let's go to the mosque. So this is really cool just along the side of the road. Namara mosque. I think it's actually something I really appreciate about being here in Minna-Oz. You get this mix of beautiful churches and beautiful mosques. In this case, I love the green color and the white. It's just on the main road. Actually, the caretakers are super friendly. They've been chandising over here. This is Jumar. Jumar. Salam al-Nah. Thank you. Thank you. You see, you hand on the heart. You always put your hand on the heart, no? It's been love. Okay, we're going to power on back to the car. Head towards Mati and see if we can catch a sleeping dinosaur or something. I'm going to have a little bit of a ride.

It's basically a landmast that looks like a dinosaur. But there's a lot of forest fires going on in Indonesia right now. So it's kind of hazy this evening. The sun's been going down. Let's check it out. There's a lot of forest fires going on in Indonesia right now. So it's kind of hazy this evening. The sun's been going down. Let's check it out.

We're going to find a place to stay, make base camp here for the night. I think we're going to head towards the weekend, but we'll see if we can find. We're in the deep snapping shape. We're going to head towards the weekend, from the back and head, and take off. Can I stay here a second? Come here. Come here. I can do it. I can do it. It's not worth it. You have to do it. It's not a surprise. It's not worth it. Come on. You know what's coming. You know what's coming. It's a bear months. Hey So it's the Burmans. Christmas Carole is already begun in September for the beans. The Burmans have begun. The green scare thing isn't full effect but that wasn't a Christmas carole. That was just a song. They were singing Christmas carole at the other table but it's pretty good. They're really good actually. Pork chicken batches. Super super committee isn't full effect due to the market today. It's good for the seed. Then we'll sort of bring the seeds. Not thank you. Chili powder. Chili powder. Thank you. Chili powder. I've never been handed chili powder ever in the Philippines. It's going to be so sick. I'm going to be still. What are you going to do with that one? Mix. It's here so salad. You're going to grab the chili powder, really? Oh! The spice of life. It's good. Kick back. I remind you everybody, if you ever travel with Kumar, he's going to make the salsa on spicy. Look how long. This is a fact. Never trust the salsa. It's true. You know what it's too, man. Hey, good day, you guys. We're still getting mission versus success. Now, sleep in mission. What you're not seeing right now is probably taking about 50 to 100 pictures. It's been pretty wild here in Matthew. Back to the car. We're still going to name this car. We haven't come with a name for it. Part of the place to stay. I can't go on. Tinky. Nothing's wrong. Yes. Aha! We're going to place this day. I'm just working the editing right now. The hairband is off. It's like 9.30 a night. This is a really cool place. I'll show you the room before I go to sleep. Until then, back to editing the video before. It's kind of a solo as well. This is where we're staying. So cool. This is not amazing. Cool little bhai kubo. Kinda hanging right by the ocean. Here we come on everything. And all I hear here is sound waves. Good night from Matthew W. Ranto. I'm excited to wake up in the morning next day. See you in the course.
