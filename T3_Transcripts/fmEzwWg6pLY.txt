Hello, I'm Roomi from K-POP. I'm 24 years old.
I'm CJ from K-POP. I'm 21 years old.
For this episode of the Sunbae Club, we are going to be reacting to the Philippine adaptations of Korean drama series.
K-drama is very popular in the Philippines.
We've taken some really famous Korean series and adapted it.
Wow, that sounds fun.
I'm really looking forward to it.
We'll start off with Broken Marriage Vow. It's the Philippine adaptation of The World of the Married.
Let's go, let's go.
Let's go, let's go.
Let's go, let's go.
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.
Just a second.
Yes, please.
I need more.
I need more.
This wine is so good.
Oh.
I'm so stressed lately.
Well, you seem to be holding up very well.
How are you now?
I've been through a lot in these past few weeks.
The unwanted negative attention.
I'm so nervous.
And now, my husband has grown.
I haven't seen this drama.
Right.
It's so new to me to watch it for the first time.
I haven't been watching it.
So at first, it was very attractive.
At first, people were like, I'm thirsty.
I need more.
But it was very focused.
Right.
Actually, we have a problem.
Did I really understand that?
I keep asking you this question, but you keep saying the same thing over and over again.
What did you lie?
My husband lied to me.
And his wife.
Ah!
Ah, okay, okay.
Ah, so...
Ah!
You knew about it?
No, I was cheating.
Yeah, I knew about it.
How could you know?
I'm so nervous.
I'm more nervous.
Wow, she's such a good actress.
I think we should call it a night.
Mrs. Lucero, no.
We're just getting to the exciting part.
We're just getting to the exciting part.
Mr. and Mrs. Lucero, your daughter is sleeping with my husband.
Gee, enough!
David, your daughter, went to America to abort her child.
Oh!
Oh my god, I'm so nervous.
This is so...
It's like...
The tension is so high.
It's suddenly going up.
What's this?
She's acting like she's born.
Oh, acting!
She's good at acting.
She could be doing this to me.
They're fighting, they're fighting, they're fighting!
It took some time to understand,
but it felt like I got hit.
Your daughter.
Have you seen the original version?
No.
Do you think there's a specific acting style that Filipinos have,
as opposed to a drama?
Yes.
What I mean is...
That...
How should I say this?
The facial expression.
The facial expression is...
It's a little different from Korea.
It's very charismatic.
Charismatic?
It's very charismatic.
It's very charismatic to suit the situation.
You saw the doctor earlier, right?
Yes.
The doctor was walking around,
pretending to be chic and walking around.
It felt like I was falling for him.
I know.
It's so funny.
Now we'll move on to the next, which is Start Up.
It stars Rhea Alonso and Alden Richards.
It's based on the Korean series that is also called Start Up.
Okay.
I think I need to memorize this line.
I forgot.
It's touching.
I know why this scene is so famous.
Why?
It's because of the atmosphere.
It's raining, and they hold hands in front of the umbrella
and talk as if they're confessing.
I'm sorry.
It's more like saying sorry than confessing.
It's so cool.
I'm so happy.
So does this mean you're still mine and I'm still yours?
Yes!
It's so romantic.
They put the umbrella down.
It's raining.
You're so manly.
My nose is about to burst.
It feels like listening to it in Korean.
It must have been cringy.
I agree.
When I listen to it in Korean,
it feels cringy.
It feels like that.
There's something cringy.
It feels cuter this way, right?
It's cute, but it's still touching.
It's really touching.
Look at her smile.
What are you writing?
What are you writing?
Here!
What are you writing?
Nothing.
I already said everything.
Look!
I'm happy now.
When I do speech-to-speech,
in Korea,
when you say sorry,
sorry,
sorry for making a mistake,
can we go back together?
Are you okay?
I don't think I've heard this kind of lines before.
It's like my eyes are going down.
I don't know why.
It's so real.
But when I watch the kissing scene in the Philippines,
it's not too much pressure.
It's not too much pressure.
It's like we're laughing together.
It's like we're laughing together.
It's more...
Should I say it's more natural?
That's how it feels.
I don't know.
The angle of the shoot is...
I think it's a little more free here.
In Korea, it's a little more immersed.
Like you said you were going to lower your head.
It's a little more free here.
It's like taking a picture here and taking a picture here.
I don't know if it's just because I saw this.
But I think it's going to be a lot of fun if we do it this way.
It's based on a Korean series called My Girl Again.
It's starring Lee Dong-wook.
But this time, it's a Philippine adaptation.
It stars Kim Choo.
Kim Choo!
Which you know.
The Gundam.
I'm looking forward to it.
I was surprised.
I was surprised.
Again.
It's lively now.
But it really looks young.
I heard it's an old one.
It's an old one.
But it's still pretty.
I don't think I know this game.
I think this guy likes it so much.
It's getting smaller.
But this actor, Kim Choo.
It's so young.
Really.
I already feel like a celebrity.
It's already a celebrity.
It's so cute.
It feels like honey is falling from my eyes.
But this guy looks very warm.
This is so cute.
I can't help but laugh.
I lost on purpose.
I came down on purpose.
It's too loud.
I know.
I can't stay still.
Longanisa.
I really like Longanisa.
It's so good.
Are they making me eat fast?
Isn't it like food fighting?
It's cute.
I know.
I think I'm going to eat this well.
Look at the side.
It's not a big deal.
And I think I'm going to win this drama.
Didn't you shoot this ad?
You're eating so well.
I won.
I won.
I won.
I fell in love with this guy.
They look good together.
I like the way they changed.
They have different charms.
This is really...
Do you know?
I saw Lovey Poe.
At school?
Yes, at school.
It's really the same.
The buildings in the Philippines are prettier.
No.
I'm surprised.
There's someone there.
The muscles are the best.
The scenes are really similar.
Good job.
The details are alive.
I think I can see everything.
I want to open it for you.
It's hard.
Of course it's going to be hard.
I got a call.
As expected of a drama.
It's really the same.
Really.
The scenes are very similar.
Really similar.
The details are alive.
It's a thriller.
And it's the same drama, the same scene.
There was a little blind.
There was a flowerpot.
It's different.
That's right.
The sun.
The sun.
I'm married.
Are you really married?
It's so pretty.
I know.
Ding dong.
Now I know.
Swag.
Song Song Couple was a real boom.
Ding dong.
I really liked it back then.
Really?
Did you cry?
Did you cry?
It looks alike.
I know.
Why does it look alike?
Why is it so similar to the place?
It's really amazing.
I really learned this OST.
That's right.
Isn't this song the same?
I'm really looking forward to it.
That's right.
This is a little different.
I think I changed the OST.
Cool.
Save me.
I got goosebumps.
This is a little more powerful.
Cool.
Cool.
Ding dong is cool.
It's over already.
I know.
It would have been nice if there was more.
The Philippines is really cool.
That's right.
I didn't catch that.
I was walking and I saw the backboard.
I'm a soldier.
That's right.
Because Ding dong is a little bigger.
That's right.
I think that's a little better.
I think I did a good job casting.
And Jingu is really cool.
There are a lot of things that the Philippines copied a little bit of Korean dramas and made them new.
But I think I'm going to watch a lot of these.
I think I'll watch a lot if I can.
Because I'm interested in the Filipino culture.
And this is listening.
You can study.
You can study everything, but you can learn more about the culture.
Because of course, it will make it a little different.
That's right.
So I think it will be helpful to learn more about the Filipino culture.
And it has a different charm.
That's right.
The charm is different.
I think I'll see it if I'm a fan.
I can't help it.
That's right.
I hope you enjoy it.
Thank you for watching.
Bye bye.
