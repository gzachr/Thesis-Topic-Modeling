Yeah, we have a few updates on our main channel, which is of course we got engaged in case you missed it. Yes, we got engaged in Boracay. It was a very emotional moment. We both were crying, sobbing. I was ugly crying. We were ugly crying. I feel like at the end of this video, we're probably going to be ugly crying as well. And that is also the reason why we actually missed Valentine's here on the channel. We're a little bit late to the game. Yes. But you're never too late for a beautiful love story. Yes. So I decided to go with a reaction video today with the legendary Jollybee Valentine's ads that we have here in the Philippines. Because you can't miss it. You should not miss it. It's something that is so embodied into like every year's... How to say it? Schedule. Schedule. You have to... Everybody's looking forward to it. And the reason is, these ads are all based on a true story. Yeah. And they're all very emotional. And I think one of our most popular videos on our main channel was us actually reacting to one of those ads. This was like many years ago. And we were not prepared. We're like, yeah, whatever. Jollybee brought us an ad. What's it supposed to be? Ugly crying. Yeah, it was a lot of crying. And yeah, I'm not sure if I'm prepared to cry today. But I'm... Oh yeah, let's just jump into it. All right, let's go. Yes? By the way, as everybody subscribe to the video on this video on our main channel. Yes? Yes. Yeah? Okay, okay, let's start. It's by a true story again. Oh yeah. Oh, this one has long distance relationships. What do I think of long distance relationships? Definitely not for me. I mean, is it even a real relationship? Oh, let's see. Okay, okay, I'm done. Senior, we're not going to be able to do something. No trust. Because you don't have to do anything. No matter how often you talk, it's just talk. No actions. And if this happens, it's just another thing. Oh. So I promised myself, never I'll ever do LDR. But what's the but? It's always a but. No, it comes. Yeah, right. Because of what I like. I'm LDR. No. Lockdown relationship. Oh. Who said that comment on the post? She's just a co-worker. Why is there nothing to worry about? I love you. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. What if you don't like it? I miss you. I miss you. I miss you. I love you. I love you. I love you. Wait. I'll try this again. May and jolly be delivering more wine. No. We may know each other. What does our favorite meal? Oh. Where your favorite is? Surprise babe. You can come in and I'll be. Cheers. Cheers. Babe. May I have a stance? I must be so good to talk, huh? I said, babe, what's wrong with you? You're so good. You're so good. You're so good. I'm so good to meet you. You're so good. Shut up. I'm not crying. You're crying. I'm so thankful we're not. Yeah. We're mature. We had a lot of subscribers messaging us during this whole worldwide situation. And a lot of our viewers are actually forced into a long-distance relationship because they were abroad and they couldn't return back to the Philippines or couldn't meet each other anyway. But even just like not even that far, we spoke to friends just a few days ago. And he was in Tagayta and she was in Makati, which is just one and a half hours apart. And they couldn't see each other for months. Yeah, they couldn't meet each other because the restrictions were so strict. Strict. Which, you know, it's difficult. But yeah, I think we live in a time where staying connected by a face time and video calls is something very valuable. And even when we dated, we used to email each other every day, right? Every day through the whole day. We weren't even texting. We just had to put so much text into one message. We had to do long-distance for like two or three months. Yeah. We had to go to American business and Nelly was in Australia. Yeah. Then like it at all. Oh wow, good video. Yeah, it's very relatable. It's very relatable. Very relatable at the time, current time. Guys, you really should check out our very first jollybee reaction video that's on our main channel. Nelly will link it right here. So you can see how our reactions were back then. That was actually the first reaction video we ever did. That's like three years ago. We didn't even have an idea. We were like, what is a reaction video? Yeah. So definitely check that out.
