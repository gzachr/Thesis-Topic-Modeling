 Aduh, kembali di Youtube, balik kembali di Youtube. Aduh, kembali di Youtube. Aduh, kembali di Youtube. Aduh, kembali di Youtube. Hey, what is up Youtube welcome back welcome back guys. All of us are here. I got a Leslie, the time I make a surgery and Michael here. Santu Michael. Santu Michael. Anyway, for today's vlog, first things first, we're going to go to the pot area to pick up Tassilajah. It's on his way from Sibu. He was supposed to join us yesterday, but we couldn't get him on the same ferry with us because there was no space for the ticket. So yeah, he's arriving now. Castuntingan chief. Bargay kembali. Bargay kembali. He's actually married to a Filipino and they live somewhere around Mandawa. Okay, the small barangay is called Castuntingan. So yeah, that's what we're trying to do. It's just like a joking manner, we're trying to write up something. Is this the side? Okay, so someone will hold it and wait for him to come out of the boat. I'll hold it. Okay, that's making it dark right? Yeah, yeah. Shade it, shade it. Barangay kembali. We need more editing. Castuntingan. I like cast. Yeah. When he walks out of the ferry, Michael will just hold the paper like this and stand and wait for him to come out. We have a cassette player and CD player here. In case you young people don't know. Yeah, in case you two thousand kids don't know. Those of you born in Blake 2000s. Yes. Hey! Hey! Hey! You're talking about me? Yeah, for those of you, the new kids, Blake 2000s. How do you turn this thing on? Oh, yeah. Maybe you need to plug this thing. Only the 90s kids know those things. Back in the day, every family has this. So we used to play a cassette and also DVD. Watch movies. We liked it to the phone, not the phone, but TV and watch. Oh! We got a tricycle. We got a tricycle to the pot area. Hello. Hola. Hello. Shut your neck. This is the main road from Luka now. Yes. This is the main road from Luka now. This is the main road, but let's traffic on the road. Hey! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Yes. Yes. Yes. There's a ferry coming in, Ozenjert. That's probably a tricycle. There's actually houses on water. There's a port going down into the water. Sir. So we are here in the pot area already. One thing I noticed about here in Tagbilaran. There are no taxis here. Not like in Manila or Sibu. The taxis here, instead of taxis they use tricycles. There are tricycles all around the city. So the one that we got on, that's a modern tricycle. All around the city, parking in front of the malls here. And just anywhere in the city. Meki, you ready to all the sign up? Yes. Oh, okay. Hello. Who was that? The four. This is our friendly Filipino. Okay, coming. Yeah. Friend coming. Coming up somewhere, huh? Ah, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh. Oh, no. Holy, holy, holy, holy, holy, holy. Oh, no. That's just a little bit. That's just a little bit. Oh, no. What? What? It's just a little bit. Oh, no. What? What? What? Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. I was wrong earlier. I thought there was no Texas here in particular. You know that I can fit the Texas here. But they have. They have still here Texas here. But there's not really a lot of Texas here compared to the Sikun Manila. Understand, Sikun Manila is big. There are two big cities here in the Philippines. So they have a lot of Texas caps on. But for the particular, I'm, I... This is my first time I'm sick of Texas caps. This one. Tak vilaran. Tak vilaran is clean, guys. Clean and organized. It's going up to four now. Four PM. Almost four PM. And we are adding to the market. We go on this guy's order. Here's the one who's going to select the food that we're going to cook tonight. So, yeah. Yeah, Mikey, you're going to be the chef, right? Yeah. We want to select the food, huh? Yeah. Guys, we're heading to Tak vilaran main market. So, I don't know. I don't know if it's the main market, though. Yeah, we're going to head there. So, there are some dogs. This place doesn't have traffic at all, guys. Yeah, it's probably Sunday. We'll see it tomorrow. Very big difference from Sibu. It's the right, Sibu. Sibu is becoming like a second Manila. It's like everywhere. Crazy. But here in Bokal, you see the road is free. We are walking towards trying to find a tricycle to go to the market. Look at how free that road is. We are in Island City Mall. This is our island City Mall. There's a lot of friendly Filipinos here. This mall is huge. Not that huge like those SM malls. But reasonable size. I don't know if this mall is owned by guys and all. Which company is owning this mall. So far I've noticed that there's no guys and all SM malls here. That's the only... I think that's the biggest mall here in Tagbilaran. But trying to get some groceries. I'm following Michael around here because he's the one to get the ingredients on what to cook. This guy likes cooking, guys. You guys are following him on his Instagram. Yeah. Michael... My culture... So cool. Michael got these things right here. I don't even know some of these things. I don't even know how to use these things. This is an curry powder. What else we got? Two merry ground, S.C. So Mike said he's going to cook curry chicken tonight. Chicken curry, huh? No red dos. If you can find pills and then this is to go to here in a beer. What? It's Vincent. We were trying to look for ganado rice but they don't have any ganado rice here. So we just got this... I don't know what's the special rice. They call it special rice. Go again, go again! Woo! Alright, heading back home now. After getting all the groceries and... ...starts to cook tonight. Michael's going to cook first. Michael is going to cook for us, guys. Alright. Salamuah tu! Salamuah tu! Ya, kita dah buat ini. Guys, ...tidak untuk hari ini. Kita dah. Kita dah. Ini rumah.
