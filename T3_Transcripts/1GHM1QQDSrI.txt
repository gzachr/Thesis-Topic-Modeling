I've seen on the other side okay well I'm sure 
almost anything's here and as you can see man  
this place is just non-stop it is uh it's where 
all the action is and I think it's cymer gonna  
just walk right in and uh see what we can 
find but there's basically food everywhere  
everywhere this is a super condensed version 
of street food now forest forest are you awake  
okay it might be I might be this for Forest the 
entire night you guys excited yeah of course might  
be sleeping all right well let's head in there 
and get started when you walk in it's really  
almost overwhelming you're immediately inundated 
with like massive street food stalls tiny little  
vendors I mean it's like steaks rice coffee it's 
everywhere oh Kelly you want your potato to go  
first yes all right so for this guy woohoo now 
you gotta love music so I don't know my potato

I bet it all comes with it I'm gonna  
I'm gonna spawn my potato number one well uh bad 
news on the potato friend the guy's not there  
okay so we'll Circle back but instead our 
first meal will actually be Shawarma nice  
big hot Shawarma Granite you ready for some 
shawarma yeah I take one Shawarma why Shawarma  
uh with cheese yeah with cheese why not all 
right so that guy just sliced it right up the  
spigot spicy yeah spicy why not what do you 
guys think a little uh a little overwhelming
that is spicy let's find out
nice that's a good a good a good first meal  
all right so you don't want to get in on that 
Shawarma I wonder if it compares to say like  
what we had in India or even the Middle East is it 
within that same spice range a little spicier nice
way spicy he put on a ton of sauce
hmm
certainly uh tomato cucumber it's a 
good a good slice of shawarma meat  
all right so we're gonna kind of knock this out 
I think the potato lady's back so we're gonna get  
Kelly a potato right after this we're back at 
the potato lady okay we take one and it looks  
like small or large I'm not sure which one she's 
making yeah yeah that one okay all right oh well a  
foot long foot long potato it looks like it looks 
like um for the powdered cheese it looks like that  
mac and cheese powder so I'm sure it's delicious 
and um I wonder if you got the sour cream if it  
would be like a sour cream cheese sauce maybe so 
okay well all right well let's give it a try oh
it's like a chip almost
oh it is like potato chips nice 
looks amazing super cranky awesome
it's like a crispy potato chip with cheese
man we're after we're off to a great start so you 
got the uh Shawarma you've got the potato stick  
good for a start sure all right oh yeah cheese 
powder is nice you can't go wrong with processed  
cheese powder on a fried potato no yeah quite good 
warm and fresh agreed just freshly fried all right  
well I can't wait to see me we're just getting 
started the whole street is just non-stop street  
food next stop Pride Baga which I believe might 
be liver so it goes um oh you're looking it up
and it comes with hot tea okay not hot tea yeah 
I'm gonna go with I'm gonna go with fried liver  
is the way it looks to me but there's only 
one way to tell is if we taste it it looks  
like it's 10 pesos per stick uh we take 
uh two sticks our Cedar you want a stick  
yeah all right I see how it works we just take
two sticks vinegar wow it's perfect 
okay all right so you can't have  
any of this kind of fried meat without 
vinegar okay Granite you wanna go first
see they wanna try one you're fine okay 
tastes like liver yeah kind of taste like it  
maybe not liver I don't know except for 
a fried meat of some sort really dark
white tasty that was good yeah yeah right 
on again that easy just grab deer sauce and  
you're good to go now I'm getting a liver taste 
now definitely liver okay yeah no no pork long
according to uh according to the Google according 
to google not liver but lung who knows all right
do you want a pork along it's not too late 
all right all right good girl good girl well  
quite tasty for us so we're gonna pay the 
man should be 20 pesos it will uh Venture  
on down our next stop Korean corn dog yeah 
corn dog yeah now what are these octopus
how do you cook these bacon okay Granite take 
a look here so this is a bacon and cheese you  
want one of those it looks like good bacon okay 
how about uh what one bacon one octopus and one  
corn dog okay okay is that how you order one order 
and and this one the one order yeah one order how  
many pieces are one order for pieces four pieces 
okay let's see that differently can we do like two  
bacon two octopus for one order cool okay let's do 
that so we'll go two bacon two octopus one order  
and then one corn dog it's okay all right cool 
so we get a few more bonus pieces I'm excited  
to see how he cooks these things so you can see 
she just basically puts the batter it's almost  
like a pancake batter right on that hot Skillet 
in goes the cheese it'll be interesting to see  
how she does the bacon there's a little crab 
kind of that imitation crab there's the bacon
party party portion of bacon there's the calamari 
or the octave octopus octopus octopus stuck on  
my octopus and then a uh another just a plain 
cheese all right so crab bacon uh octopus and  
cheese see there she just added the top so she 
had that second row frying and she flipped it  
so it's gonna be kind of like a stuffed little 
Pita bite should be pretty good all right guys  
so here's the deal we have four of these little 
balls they kicked it up with mayonnaise sweet  
sauce There are one is cheese one is octopus one 
is crab and one is bacon but we don't know which  
one's which yeah it's kind of like it's rice 
oh and our corn dog just showed up a little  
corn dog too so that's gonna be good okay so my 
my best bet is this so I'll go grab their Fork  
and we'll kind of spread them out a little they're 
a little gooey I think this one might be bacon  
I'm just gonna stab this one and kind of go for 
it you can see she sprinkled our seaweed on top  
a sweet sauce and kind of like a mayonnaise you 
know what instead of me popping the whole thing I  
bet you could break it with your forks okay all 
right better so this one looks like it's just  
cheese see what you want to get in on that cheese 
one I'm gonna break could you break out yeah yeah  
go for it you just use the side of your fork okay 
okay so here is just cheese ah I think this is
Mega cheesy the sweet sauce is really outstanding 
the uh the star of the show I mean that sweet  
sauce is fantastic the batter very pancakey nice 
okay yeah see you guys that's okay so it looks  
like the approach is now turned into uh cut 
them all in half and just sort of Chop It Off  
all right so I'm gonna go with one 
of these little crab pieces here  
uh let's see if I can break it do you 
need help yeah I got it so you can see  
that the imitation crab the batter 
the mayonnaise and that sweet sauce

that's vinegar okay so a collection 
of different options for the uh for  
the blood and just like that our 
pork blood is ready so we're gonna  
go into the cup Okay add We'll add

me to go first or do you want to go first oh 
I'll go first okay coagulated pork blood oh

assumed it was like a piece of uh like a piece of  
pork it's not too bad okay yeah nice you like it

it just tastes like a pork product you sure 
you don't want to get one little nibble a  
teeny little corner bite all right you do or 
you don't you do want to try all right there
it's all right nice yeah I think it's 
definitely better with the vinegar than  
like say just plain but it's pretty good a 
few more Street treats really this guy is  
doing something quite interesting so he's making 
these homemade tortillas and this is the flour  
okay is it so it's got that orange color 
that is so unique so he dips in a little oil  
finds it with this pin I love when I roll stuff 
you're not cool yeah you know you try to like  
highlight the Stalls of doing something unique 
and this is the only guy I've seen actually making  
these kind of flat tortillas so in the tortilla 
let's see um maybe maybe lettuce yeah letters  
are Cabbage or some sort certainly he has a 
little bit of pepper in it and then sausage  
is this pork pork sausage pork sausage oh 
and an egg wow okay it's like a whole meal
all right so he tips the sides down  
okay this is the plate and I imagine I can see 
it right back on the pile into the fryer awesome  
how long does it fry for five minutes so five 
minutes that'll be great so again it was the  
sausage it was this was the flowery tortilla the 
egg the lettuce maybe cabbage Empanada it's an  
empanada oh yeah okay that Empanada okay cool 
nice I think we got I think we got the special  
Zone yeah it is and again the fact that this 
guy's making them uh fresh yeah that's that's  
great because there's a lot of repetition on this 
street and uh something like this at six hours
so like this yeah you look for those uh you 
look for those unique spots so four more minutes  
and we're ready Empanada has been served it's 
pretty warm but I think I think I can do it okay
first bite all crispy
oh yeah yeah I got to the sausage quite delicious  
all right now I'm getting to the stuffing um 
it's just hot from that like that deep fry
oh bam that is an all-in-one meal it's peppery 
it's kind of spicy and savory from that sausage  
you want to get it on this it's pretty good 
it's a sausage bite to the left and kind of  
salad to the right
gorgeous yeah that's quite nice the 
daughter I thought it was kind of  
savory a little peppery a little sweet a 
little bit of sweet pie from the sausage
what kind of flavors they get in there Cedar
sausage some some crunchy sausage and some 
like nice I bet that I bet the crunch is coming  
from the tortilla that was like deep fried 
dough like crispy Perfection it's nice huh  
yeah you can really see all the layers in there
take another bite and get some of this egg now
yeah the egg cooked all the way through
yeah that sausage is really
