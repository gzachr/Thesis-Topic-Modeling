 What's up, you FM! Today, we're eating the most popular Filipino dishes. This is part of our eating around the World Series and we're eating Filipino food every Tuesday. Today, we're going to be eating Chicken and Dobo, Pork Seasig, Letch on Kuala Lian, and Pansit Lang Lang. Now, let's show you guys how we got the food. Right now, we just arrived at our Filipino restaurant. We ordered the food online, so all we have to do now is just go pick it up. Alright, I'm gonna pick up order for Lily. I'm gonna go get the food out there. Thank you. Alright, got the food right here. Let's go eat. So, what do you want to eat first? I don't know. We asked for lechon and they say we only have it on the weekends. And they're like, but we have a lechon Kuala Lian. And I was like, okay, and it comes up and I'm like, what's the difference? Yeah, you guys are only gonna need to tell us in the comments below. And we also brought our own rice. Yeah, we forgot to order rice. But that's okay. Favorite part of lechon is literally the skin. Because this skin is like super crispy. Every time I've had lechon, I don't know the difference between lechon and lechon Kuala Lian. I think it's pretty similar. I think lechon maybe is just big, like the original, like maybe the full order. I don't know. What do you mean the full order? The whole pig. The whole pig. Maybe they serve in the whole pig. Imagine we ordered lechon and they gave us the whole pig. Yeah, that's probably what it was. You think so? Maybe. This piece just looks so good. I'm literally, Josh is not letting me eat without rice. Going without rice, go. Okay. I'll do what that was too. If you should, I get tears of peace for me. Ready? Cheers. Oh wait, isn't there sauce for it? There should be sauce. Where's the sauce? Is that what the sauce? Which sauce? Yeah, that's the sauce for it right there. For the sauce? For this? Yeah. I've never had it with sauce before. I'm half full of peanuts. I do know a little bit. I think this is the, um, forget what sauce this is, but it's like, mostly for this sauce. Multi-proo-paste sauce? I'm pretty sure. All right. Cheers. Cheers. It's sweet a little bit. Mmm. Mmm. That sauce is really good. It is. I've never had that sauce before. It's kind of sweet. It's good right? The last one? So crispy. That's good. Okay, now I need some rice. Mmm. Okay, let's see. I'm gonna get a piece right here. Dip it in the sauce. Oh, gotta get in the sauce. Get lost in the sauce. Get my bite of rice in the sauce together. Ooh, that's gonna be fire. That's gonna be so good. Mmm. Okay, I really wonder what that sauce is. Because that sauce is so good. Mmm. I've never had it before. Mmm. Look how crispy that is. Mmm. It is crispy. Pass me that sauce. Mmm. When the rice is so good. I like eating like the last, the skin last because it's just so crispy. Haha. I really enjoy this with the rice. You know what? This is so good. One more piece of the rice. Could finish this all. Do you guys hear my crunching? It's so good. Mmm. Can you see it? Can you get to that skin? The country, the country, the better. So good. I rate this. 9, 9, 10. Yeah. 9, 10. I'll give it a 9. 9.5. That must say 9. I think 9 is pretty good. It's like, really good. I really like the skin. I'm ready. You know the piece. Yeah, I want to go to the sauce. It makes it so good too. The sauce is perfect. I don't know what that sauce is, but it's good. I think it's literally called like a multi-purpose sauce. I've had this sauce before. I think you might have had this sauce before too. Mmm. I've never had that sauce before. It's my first time. Yeah, this sauce makes it so good. The sweetness of it, it compliments so well together. Like, so good. I'm looking forward to the rest of the food we have here. Because we're already starting off at a 9 out of 10. Isn't that so crazy? Can you put the sauce on the rice? Like, what is it for? Like, is it just for chirping? Or is it like drizzling? You put the sauce for whatever your highest desire is. I think I've used it with rice before. It's so good. But, like, are you supposed to drizzle it on? It's supposed to, like, dip it. Like, what are we doing in one? I think it's whatever you want. Like, I had it with rice and I mixed it with my rice before. It's just whatever your heart's desire. A double chicken. They asked me if I want a double pork or a double chicken. I think a double chicken is more popular than a double pork. And this is my first time having it with bones. Usually, it's not bones, right? It's like boneless. I think having the bone would maybe give it more flavor. Yeah, yeah. I know, like, when you cook it with bone, it's like juicier and not dry. I think something like that. But, let's try it. Yeah, right. You're going to have to get the sauce on the rice for this one. A sauce on the rice? Yeah. Can you hold the rice? I'll hold this chicken. Get it by the chicken and the sauce on the rice. Oh, there you go. Oh, I had a double chicken in a long time. Can I just try the chicken without the sauce? Okay, do you want it with rice as well? What do you think? I think you should do it with rice. Everything with rice. Everything with rice, yeah. If it's not with rice, it's not as nice. Is that what's that, Clover? No. Let's try this. Okay, rice and a piece of a double chicken. Cheers. I want to try that. All right, my turn. How was it? Good. I feel like, obviously good. Chicken's so good. Oh my goodness. We need some of that sauce. Let me try some of this. Okay, so. Just rice and the double sauce. And the double sauce. Oh, that looks good too. Mmm. I need some more. Oh, you say so for me? What? Not so good. Okay, let me try. I want to try that too. I'm not some chicken. Let me have some chicken. Let me have some chicken. I've got to have it all in one. My turn with the chicken and like the drenched sauce rice. Watching Josh eat his torture, I really need to eat my own. Mmm. Clean bone. That's when you know the chicken. It was mainly they cooked it right. I think I would really enjoy it. It was boneless. Okay. The bones aren't really interrupting me right now. I'm like, right? They were eating it. It's not really inconvenience. But oh my goodness, that is good. What's your rating? Yeah, usually we don't give ratings. But when the food is just so good, I feel like it deserves a rating. Okay, I think we give the double chicken an 8.5 out of 10. Maybe you're just too used to eating. A double chicken is that what it is? Like then you're giving it a low rating? Because this one's really good. That's pretty fair actually. This was really good. 10 out of 10, no doubt. Yeah, from since like you don't eat it as much, like. I'll eat it at all and I'm going to start too. Can't believe I've been with Josh for how long and he doesn't even give me a double chicken. That's crazy. Okay, I learned how to make it for you. The next dish we have is the pork seasick. Are you ready to eat this? Yes. I made pork seasick a long time ago. Maybe I feel like a TikTok. It was like a long time ago. This brand came up to us as like, hey, can you use our ingredient and make pork seasick? I'm like, okay, I can try it. I'm kind of scared. I see a pepper inside. Okay. This is a long piece of pepper and looks like it's going to be spicy. I don't think it should be spicy. You're eating it the first bite. Ooh, they gave a lot. That's good. So what else do they put inside? That looks good. You have to try to find out. I can tell you. There's a lot of packed it in here. Okay. So I think pork seasick is pork belly, right? I'm not sure, but I'm pretty sure in this. Cheers. Cheers. Mmm. Mmm. That's really good. Wow, that's really good. I'm going to my rating. That was a 10-9 turn as well. I've never had pork seasick this good. I agree with you. The Filipino food is hitting today. Definitely my pork seasick is not this good. This was really good. Yeah, this is so good. I need to have some more. And I'm so glad they packed it up. This is really, really good. I'm so like... I'm shocked. I'm blasted away. Is that the right terminology? Blasted away? It's just really good, especially with rice. Like, I don't know what is. They have a lot of different... A lot of different like... flavors into it. Yeah, it's like... It's not not dry. No. Mm-hmm. We have one more right here. You need to get all the pork seasick. No, I think pork seasick is pig ear. Oh pig ear? Yeah. Oh, you know what? That's what you write. I think it's pig ear actually. Mm-hmm. You just grabbed mayo. Josh literally just grabbed a spoonful of mayo and put it in his mouth. Yeah, you did. There's pork seasick in there. Barely. Okay, so yeah, I see some cardelage here. So I like that little crunch. Mixed things taste... I like cardelage. Do you like cardelage? Yeah, I do. It's yummy. Okay. After eating this, I really really like this. I'm gonna give this a 10 out of 10. This is so well made. Yeah, I'm gonna give this a 10 out of 10 and I think for the double chicken, I'm gonna give it at 9 out of 10. You're changing it, middle hand. You need to up the scale because like, the way the food, it like this made the double chicken taste better. Does that make sense? Like, I don't know. It's just everything is coming together. This is really kind of heavy. I had it like this before. Not like this. No, usually, I'm out of the pork seasick I usually have is all homemade. Most of the cooking food I use is homemade. Homemade and why is it not as good? This is the flavors. This is the flavors that are here so strong. And the consistency of everything. Like, you don't really taste it. Sometimes, cartilage can be really hard and crunchy. This is like a nice, it's like softer and more satisfying to eat. So is that a dish to your family's cooking? Or a dish to just homemade in general? No. Are you saying that you need to? You're going to eat full-peaned food. You have to eat it out. What are you trying to say? I'm trying to say, is this restaurant did a really good job. And I'm really happy that we're eating this. Last dish, you got the pan-set, Langling? Yeah, pan-set Langling. Okay, so they were asking me on the phone, what kind of pan-set is it? They're like, what kind of pan-set? We got three kinds. I have no idea what the three was. Something about egg noodle. Now it's just like, what's the most popular? And they said, pan-set Langling. I've only had pan-set from gosh's mom. Yeah, I think it's pretty similar, but maybe the flavors are different. Okay. I see, I'm really, I really like baby shrimp, so I'm so happy to see that there's like pieces of ham. Yeah, it's all on his side too. Look at the pieces. And he says a shrimp there. Yeah. Cheers. Cheers. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I mean, another bite. I want some, a bite with pork in it. The pork is good. Oh yeah? It's all. That's good. I really like, what I think pan-set is really special, I like the mix of different noodles. That's what I think is really cool, because every other dish, noodles is usually like the same noodle. It's the same noodle. This one is like, pan-set always has two different, right? And like at least a couple different, always a mix, which I really enjoy. I really like this. Personally, I think this one is a little salty. Yeah. Nothing so too. I think it's a little salty. When I get one my, when I eat like salty stuff, my face has to get a bit red. I think it's getting red soon. I think this dish, it's a good comfort food, but I think for, compared to the other stuff we ate today, this has like a lot less flavor. Mm. It's more of the noodle that you're eating. The noodle is good, though. Yeah. The noodles good, it's just kind of salty. Yeah, salty. The only other time I've ever had pan-set is with Josh's mom and Josh's mom makes a really good pan-set. So, this one is a little salty. I'm gonna have to give my rating for this, seven out of ten. Usually, the pan-set I've ever, that eight before would be a good eight out of ten. But this one, I got a downgrade, a little bit, two salty for me. Oh, yeah. Okay. I just had a really salty part. Really? Oh, gosh. Yeah, that's... Yeah. That's two salty. Yeah. Um, it wasn't so salty. It would get a higher rating, but I'm giving it like a six. A six? Yeah, I kind of finished that. I can't believe you weren't it. Yeah, it's two salty, something about it. I just, it just tastes like, there's a huge chunk of salt in like one of these parts. I just ate. That's close this, and go back to the seasoning. Oh, yeah, the seasoning. Dude, that seasoning's so good. But this, I'm kind of disappointed. Yeah, it sucks. It sucks, that's... We should just try again. We will definitely have to try again. We'll do a video where we try all the pan-sets. Oh yeah, okay. It's three, right? Yeah. Maybe we should do that. Do all the same. I can compare it. I don't know. Yes, I just know if you actually want to see that or not. Yeah, so you're gonna have a little bit of the, this? Yes, please. I'm gonna do my last bite of the luncheon. Me too, me too, put this one. Oh, okay, okay. But this is also one of the top ones today. That is a top one. I was really going to go home and demolish that. Yeah. But the luncheon, I'm just gonna have that taste again. With the sauce and the rice. With the sauce. With the sauce. Did I give this a 10? I don't remember. Nope. They give it a 9, right? Something like that. Yeah, it's definitely a 10. I gave it a 9, too. Oh yeah, I think I gave it a 9, too. It's definitely a 10. Josh, you know what you need to do? Do what I did. Like, eat the bottom point first and then eat the... Yeah. The what's it called? The crunchy part of the skin because the need really get to enjoy the crunchy part of the skin. Feeling nice? Mm-hmm. Oh, oops, actually I dipped the crunchy part in it, so it's going in first. I can hear you crunchy. I'm about to eat this crunchy part. It should come up close to the camera. Can you guys hear my crunchiness? Are you ready? So good. It is definitely a 10. With the rice and the sauce. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. So you name like three things 10? Mm-hmm. Oh, the soup. There we go. I'll find out what the sauce is and tell you right now. It's mang Thomas, all purpose sauce. Oh, so it's a bottle? Yeah. It's a bottled sauce. Cool. I'll show you guys, too. This is the sauce that I'm pretty sure it is. Would you search out? Yeah. I'll find out what the sauce is and tell you right now. It's mang Thomas, all purpose sauce. Oh, so it's a bottle? Yeah. Filipino all purpose sauce, multiple purpose sauce. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mang, that's that one. So good. And that's just like everything. Like, it's just eat that with everything. Pretty sure. I've only had it with... Lachon. Mm-hmm. But I'm pretty sure you could... If you want to. It says all purpose, so... And that wraps up today's video. Thank you guys so much for watching.
