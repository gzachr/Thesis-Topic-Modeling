good afternoon from downtown Manila guys 
I'm just walking down Makati Avenue today's  
video is going to be quite different than the 
videos that I usually do where I would show  
you you know some of the top places to see in 
a city how to get around very tourist friendly  
so in today's video I wanted to do something 
different where I actually hired a local from  
Airbnb experiences who's apparently a YouTuber 
as well I'm excited to ask her about that to show  
me around an area of Manila that I don't think 
most tourists should go to by themselves but is  
definitely a much more authentic window 
into how the average person lives here
foreign
yeah so we got chicken feet here and what 
were you saying this one was yours ears wow
wow
so everything's fresh to order here  
that's crazy because today today I actually got 
some bubble tea and I think I paid 150 for one
so yeah yeah definitely 
definitely a difference in price
oh interesting
expensive yeah kind of snack foods it's 
a busy at night time yeah there's no  
foreigners around in here yeah if 
you're here like uh tonight like  
you're the only one here yeah and they 
have a local band at night oh that's fun  
yeah I like this like tables everywhere you can 
just hang up each other because it's so loud
perfect
so Venus how long have you been uh giving 
tours here in Manila oh I started 2019 and  
then now it's about 2020 right yeah of course 
maybe like three years but pandemic came so I  
stopped for one year but it's sad yeah 
it's really sad of course and then now  
like you know it's back like it's it's 
crazy back like a lot of tourists from  
Australia like from America from Canada and 
Europe as well I did that before as well
here
perfect thank you the tricycle okay nice
yeah like of course like we don't have a air 
conditioned yeah so like our baby washing machines  
that they don't have so they will actually dry 
their clothes look at this through there yeah  
so they will have washed on their hands and 
then like they hide outside their houses yeah  
yeah what's the hottest that it gets in Manila 
like temperature wise oh my gosh it's so humid  
here yeah like we're actually using Celsius for 
example right now it's like 32 Celsius you know  
yeah so hot yeah but if it's like December we feel 
like a little cooler it's not like winter yeah  
cooler the coolest was like 15. so 
what I'm showing you something here  
yeah they dig this uh this one they're garbage 
they actually cleaned this River every day they  
cleaned this oh they clean the river every day 
because 20 20 20 they start to clean this area
yeah and like maybe 1 000 pesos per month 1  
000 pesos is like what 20 25 US 
dollars per month these houses
shared toilet just on the outside 
maybe 500 how and it depends like  
what how big is the room you know yeah so small
topic you're my guide
oh yeah a little business is all in here uh-huh
yeah
but people are working they try their best to 
like you know to have a living you know of course  
because like it's not like a you know maybe in 
another country they feel like okay follow me
but no like if people are trying their 
best to work to make the best of their  
situation yeah even though they're actually Four
like a big okay maybe like the government to 
support us because like you know we're like we're  
poor and we don't have education but yeah the 
people who was like outside the street they have  
their own like you know small like hearts yeah or 
small like stores so like yeah it's really good
no thank you thank you the 
kids are really sweet here
and say hi hi
so Venus what would happen if foreigners came 
here by themselves wow it's really crazy yeah  
like right now like you know the kids are like 
oh my God yeah I've never seen a porn I think  
have you seen like any foreigners around yeah 
yeah if they see you like around like oh my God
of course curious
I can still see like some 
like a very brave foreign yeah
we have parking spots after pandemic it's 
more popular popularity of bikes like single  
bikes to go to office because there's no 
transportation in pandemic sure it's kind  
of sad to you know some other people that would 
have like physical you know they will like of  
course not everyone can can afford you know a 
car or maybe a motorbike and it's pandemic yeah
it's a huge Market
oh I think I've heard of this place this is the 
divorcerya market yeah I saw pictures of this  
place yeah nice you can bargain the prize yeah 
because I think for me was like it's cheaper  
here inside the mall there's also have a mall 
like but of course it's air conditioned like  
locals love to check it out there yeah but here is 
like you know like everything is here like we can  
bark because the competition is crazy yeah so you 
need to like make your cries cheap yeah yeah sure
is this ice cream here okay
foreign
ERS are just also not used to like 
some of the normal bacteria so it's  
like a local wouldn't get sick but yeah 
yeah I didn't say anything for sure
oh the wet markets hmm
fish you have like seven thousand 
plus Island so we have lots of fish
grapes look at the grapes they look great 
yeah I love Dubai here but yeah it's so cheap  
probably three or four times 
mark up in Makati yeah yeah
I remember early I told you like they're 
unloading all the vegetables oh yeah yeah
it's so heavy you know that would 
be a hard job unloading all of that
so what would you say is actually the average 
wage in this area ah no it's it's hard to find  
a minimum wage in this area to work for it for 
example those bags of vegetables it's only like  
10 pesos per just to carry that one just for one 
bag but if the 10 pairs only right so yeah like  
maybe 20 or more to get something substantial 
yeah yeah because it's not minimum wage in here  
of course yeah so this area the street it will be 
like busier at night there's a lot of trucks yeah
in a way Manila actually reminds me a little 
bit of Bangkok yeah I spent about a month in  
Bangkok and I see some similarities yeah but 
this one because like some of the foreigners  
like they don't know where to go of course 
yeah my tour is all about like locals yeah
to survived we got through we
oh my gosh okay this is the one thing that 
I was shocked about that there's Christmas  
stuff everywhere and it's like the end of 
October and they celebrate Christmas so early
that's hilarious
yeah
and then there's a car yeah
foreign
so Venus we're gonna ride a tricycle you said nice
over here
I don't think I've actually ever been 
in one of these before I've been in a  
tuck tuck before but I've never been in a 
trip like this right yeah yeah those guys  
more like three meals yeah and the jeepneys 
these go like all over the city yeah awesome  
amazing love it fabulous so we're going to 
ride like you know this one and then cool
thank you
we're in Chinatown Manila
I heard that this is like one of the best 
places to go if you want to do like a food  
tour right there's lots of great restaurants 
there cheap they're not so expensive but the  
line is so long yeah it's like it's nice and 
good food and cheap but the time is so long okay
thank you
it's pretty
um
that's cool
do we need a mask
foreign
I like it so before 11 10 11 it's all 
because there's gas and it's very high yeah  
for sure and the train is like 20 
pesos so it's like half then yeah  
I have to go on the Jeep where 
are you going oh yeah but yeah
yeah nice
foreign
so like everything is difficult before it's a lot  
of homeless there like staying but 
now it's very deep now it's nice
the wall the students actually 
paint the walls in here cool
oh they did such a good job this is awesome 
nice and then you can see the main size for days
the horse yeah because this one 
is the black mask uh-huh and then
