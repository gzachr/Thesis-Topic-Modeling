 It's too cold! It's fun! I'm in the pretty face now! It's morning! I'm so hungry now! I really like Jorybeek! I think you already know that. But today, it's not usual Jorybeek's video. Breakfast! Jorybeek's video! Actually, I have never tried a Jorybeek breakfast because I always wake up 10 or 11. But today, I woke up aria and usual for Jorybeek's breakfast. I'm at the mall! I believe every Filipino mall has Jorybeek's right? Today, I'm gonna go to Jorybeek's breakfast! Because this video, I'm pretty satisfied with our channel and follow my Instagram and follow me! Let's go! I should eat breakfast because I had it's until the end. It's 2.50! So, I should call the aria! Look at this! I found Jorybeek's breakfast! And we cannot eat breakfast menu! So, let's go! It's morning, but there are so many people that I should go to get they have breakfast or in no menus. I'm gonna get three menus. Wow! It's so hard to pick menus. Some people would recommend me to drink pineapple juice. So, today, I'm gonna get pineapple juice too. Can I get beef papa pineapple juice? I need a pineapple. I need a pineapple juice. Cheesy, bacon pie, bacon, egg, cheese sandwich. Wow! It's a good one! Yay! Food is coming! Unfortunately, Zengahar beef papa, and a bacon cheese sandwich, I changed to the menu. This is home-beap, this is the salsa and cheese pie, go pie! It's a bit difficult to get a breakfast, right? We came from Jorybeek of a breakfast until KPM. We have to go to Jorybeek's aria. I'm so sad, it's been out, so I'm gonna drink this one, but this one is pineapple juice. Some people would recommend me pineapple juice. Next, please! It's right up here, but pineapple is a lot of fruit, but this is costly. I know it is from the island, so pineapple can grow up. This one is so good. Now, this is my favorite one. Actually, I eat this one. This one is colored before it from white rice. Home-beap rice, I'm gonna come out. Actually, we have from beef in Japan, but it's so different. It's more juicy, a little bit oily. I like it! Japanese Home-beap is more dry. I'm so surprised, this is so juicy from beef. Japanese Home-beap is a little bit too salty. Actually, this combination. What I eat is brown, it's not too much. Oh my god, I can eat 3 or 4 dishes. Because this crab is good. It's like a fried rice. This for me is not so salty, so it's a combination. Wow, pretty peanut people can eat. There is a crab, but I'm so jealous. This has a combination of rice. Next one. Fried rice, but I'm so happy. It's contain sour soup. I can feel the rich taste of oil. Look at this sausage. It's more soft than I expected. We can buy these. All the people can eat sausage and this kind of sausage. Everyone can eat this sausage, but it's so soft. I thought it's sweet sausage, but no, it was salty one. It's good combination. So, sausage and the sausage. Weston style. But the angelry like fried rice. It's like an angel style and western style. So, people can eat the style. Behind me is Jory Bix. Jory Bix, Jory Bix. I feel like Jory Bix. I'm so impressed. This rice. It's very good too. Morning Jory Bix has a special menu and breakfast menu too. You have so many options in the morning. It's Friday and it's week-week day, but there are so many people's even morning. Jory Bix is always hungry. I love it. Today, I came here to eat some menu. It's nothing. If you don't want to eat breakfast, you should come here. I did not expect to eat some beef and sausage. But so, it's very good. So, I think every Jory Bix breakfast is good too. How is your breakfast? It's good. Very best breakfast. Do you like Jory Bix breakfast? Yes. How about pasta now? I'm like McDonald's at the restaurant filling. Jelly beans. Just like, if you don't have any bread, you're not going to eat breakfast. Actually, this one is Cheesy Bacon Pie. Wow! In Japan, pasta now is a famous. When I say, I remember the upper five. Thank you very much. Outside is so good too. Inside has potato bacon cheese. It's like a jamang potato style. Wow! I love it. It's so creamy. I thought inside it's like a pastry potato style. It's like a stew. How many of you? Some of the highly recommended this one. It has so many bacon. It's not good too. It's like a home. This combination is also good because it's like a city. So, the combination is about the taste rice pasta. So, in my mouth, it's like a party style. Mix up! It's 10.50. We cannot eat breakfast menu. J-Ham, Kanki, Kui-Fan, So-Chi, Lu-Pia. I'm so surprised you guys. Lu-Pia from morning. Isn't it pretty pretty style? It's a different taste. I like Lu-Pia pasta. It's good with spicy rice. Some of it. I know Lu-Pia's taste. This is my J-Vis video. That was my very first time with J-Vis menu. I was surprised. It's really bit spicy. Look at this video. Wow! It's so hot! I was never be surprised that I want to eat different taste which I have never tried. Pia, they have pretty pretty style and also waist-town style. Usually in Japan, we try more. We also serve a great refresh. It's like a K-Pisaro Japanese breakfast menu. I think there are more options in the Philippines. Last one. What's your name? I'm a little long.
