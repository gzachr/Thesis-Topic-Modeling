no I'm not saying that America has done me
dirty or anything I love America I love Dallas
Texas that's where I'm from but [Music]
so I want to be clear as a black man in America
I was definitely treated differently but compared
to my father I was treated a lot better compared
to his father he was treated a lot better
so what I'm saying is America of the Democracy
it's just it's a line graph it's going to
go up and then down and get better and better
like a business but here in the Philippines
it just seems like you just get treated just
great just it doesn't even matter who you
are here in the Philippines I'm already getting
so much love got invited to dinner with this
Filipino family they this random Filipino
family saved me at the airport and took me
to terminal four they didn't even know me
and it just seems like no matter where you
look if you have to ask a question someone's
there to answer that question and figure it
out if you guys didn't know though today is
a travel date and we are headed back to Manila
thank you [Music] why are Filipinos so nice
warm-hearted and loving even to foreigners
people they have never met before you guys
probably won't just believe me so I'm gonna
ask a local because anytime you go to another
country you got to make sure that you actually
speak to the locals you go to where they're
living at because can you really call yourself
a traveler if you just went to the Eiffel
Tower you can't all right you got to tell
me why are Filipinos so nice they were Filipinos
Filipinos are all over the world I guess this
started because of our history like we're
Islanders and we were doing trading business
in the old days and we I guess got used to
accepting other nations coming in and out
of the country and then later on we were colonized
by the Spaniards Americans the Japanese with
that history we got so used with other people
coming in and out of the country that wasn't
good of course all the time but um yeah I
guess that's that's my answer like we're used
with foreigners coming in you know what as
a Filipino I I could just say that I'm very
proud Filipinos are very nice we're very hospitable
back when we were a kid we were like uh thought
that we have to be very uh responsible of
our actions we were thought correctly when
we were a kid um you know like there is a
thing as uh as what we call it as reprimanded
right where parents tend to like say they
stop that or don't do that because that's
wrong at the end of the day I should be very
thankful for that because that's one of the
things that really helped me to grow and to
develop myself over the time you know what
I really like about Filipinos is we're very
much hospitable and at the same time we just
don't really care too much about what's happening
in the world in a good way just to say that
we we learn how to jive with other people
we just learn how to you know communicate
and to feel what other people feel and you
know that that let us uh connect and to continue
with life and just be happy about it you don't
need to really like judge other people by
their preference but by how they look by their
color by their preferences it would be really
nice to live in the world without judgments
and it's really something that I would really
love to uh to Showcase and to tell the world
and you know what to be honest I used to live
in the America before back in 2014 I used
to study there for a year so I stayed there
for a year and then after that we had to go
back here in the Philippines for some personal
matters when I bought to America before it's
really hard to adjust my culture to their
culture it's like being in another world my
culture here in the Philippines is so much
different from from America and when I really
try to like fit into my when I tried to fit
myself in in America that's what I saw racism
discriminations and just to be honest about
it and then today this is my opinion this
is not showcasing the opinion of my friends
or the other people around me it's just really
what I felt when I got the chance to live
in America there are times where I really
wanted to like approach people to befriend
people but that's where I saw that people
would like you people won't well people won't
always always like you people won't approach
you if they find you like not like how do
you say that like they're not very um if you're
not like the type of person who keeps like
a party going if you're boring they don't
like you at all and then the whole year that
I try to be like an outliner in America I
try to get going with myself try to study
and you know like Inspire myself that someday
you're just gonna have to focus on your career
and you're just gonna have to focus on your
study your family and your inspiration in
life it's not really inspired me to get the
whole week this part of discrimination that
I was able to feel in America so yeah again
just to answer your question why Filipinos
are very very kind well it's an early shirt
to be honest it's really in it's really just
in a nature that we wanted to welcome every
nationality that will go here in the Philippines
and we just really wanted to showcase the
culture and how we really are here in the
Philippines so yeah after talking with some
of the locals and honestly hearing what it
felt like to live in America I just wish that
it wasn't like that and I know it's not just
like that in America but here in the Philippines
it truly feels like people are here to help
each other this life if you see someone's
very sad if someone's from a different country
and they're in your country go talk to them
ask them if they want to get a coffee or if
they want to get lunch we are all human beings
on the same planet we are all the same different
cultures but we're all humans with blood running
through our veins here in the Philippines
I'm not judged based on the color of my skin
I'm I'm just judged on how good of a person
I am am I nice am I caring am I being a great
human being and in America the one place I
truly felt like my skin color wasn't the thing
that defined me whenever I was in the Army
in the United States Army I felt like at that
point it was what can I do for my country
I was not discriminated against in the Army
as like an American I know it's not the same
for every minority and at least for me I did
not deal with that in the Army so the Philippines
the Philippines y'all have my heart here y'all
truly do and I hope more people can be like
Filipino people and not judge based on the
color of someone's skin where they come from
and just what's inside of them
