 Get afternoon. It's 152, 16 out of tow bird. In the front bedroom here, the boy Ferdinand is putting in tiles. These are the tiles for the bedrooms, all three bedrooms. Just looking good, just looking good. Yeah, I stepped. Okay, we'll go outside. You can see you got the ones that was in the living room area and the hallway there. We're going to go there in a minute. Let me go ahead and make my way around. Oh, yeah, this is it. That's how they did. I just want to have it going to do it. They said they had to cut them here. Just to get them the match. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Look at that all over the floor. It's looking good. If we get a clear floor, we can see it a lot better. I'm just zooming when I ask the question about the ground, too. Just following around here. Well, guess what's here? Fridge ready. Lens. What's going on? All right, we've got the railing up. Oh, let me check here first. See here? Obviously, he's not finished. It's now to be done and probably we'll finish up this. The hallway. It clicks to the rooms. We've already solved this. It's completed, but hey, never heard. This will be the next one on the presuming. Then the boys room. Go here. Now we can do it. Got a nice and smooth. We've got good planks going over there. Eventually, so I should be getting them going ahead to older those planks. Are you smoothing that out up there? That's nice. This high. Big smile. All right, that's getting sturdy. I'm pretty sure that'll hold me, right? Is this on the gut, Michael? I think it's all right. I think it's just right to add a two-pipe. Wait a minute, baby. I think it's just a second. Yeah, so you've got the railings up all. Just look on looking good. It's all right now. Cool. Perfect. Booking wood, what? I'm trying to catch up. Looking good, please. Got the towel here. Over there. Gonna get a shot of the floor. We got a little cabbage. We're gonna get that baby there. Over there. There's a little bit of blood. There's a little bit of blood. There's a little bit of blood. There's a little bit of blood. Over there. Oh, baby, we still got to get the droplights. We're gonna throw in the wells back. One, two, three, four, five. This needs young, strong, man in shape for this, because I think it's heavy. I got to get an update here, so let me start. Get an update for maybe jazz. They got two pipes. Plus this third pipe, that much of the third pipe. These pipes are 20 feet long. There's two down and it looks like we got four feet left on this one. So basically they got 20, 40... They're going to something. Anyway, 56 feet. That's not a very good angle here. Test the water. It's really hard. It's hard when we get the pipe in. So, you know, test the water here. You'll see what's gonna happen. We're pretty sick speed deep right now. There's typical foam, because they're using manual playing with that weight. They have a machine that would be an issue, but they don't have a machine. So, let this go for a little bit, and see what they say. I'm gonna go back inside and I'm gonna do what they're doing. Maybe jazz can not. I'm gonna check a little bit for the cables. So, right now it's a stance that is 60 feet. Let's see what we'll go for here. Okay, I'm gonna go up those steps. I'm pretty good here. It looks a little weird. They got the step way high over that one. It's a way. Man, not bad. Look at these chanted downpainted up. They're 56 feet. Deep, that's the third pipe. So, that's about 4 feet up, so it's 56 feet down. They're testing. They put that machine up, water up, so they want to test the water. So, if they only want to go 3 pipes, the price comes down. Okay, because the price was based on 4 pipes. Yes. But what am I gonna do with that one pipe? I can't take back. Is it what I was saying? This is why I was insisting on, hey, you were hard to do 4 pipes to do it. Because now I got a pipe. If that's all they go down, then I got a pipe. I can't take back. Okay, there's only 3 workers today. Boy, a Ferdinand Nelson. We're just James took the day off. He's just going to send this. Okay, brother Jay, we're gonna have to take the family to the beach. Guess you've problem with some last week, but then you couldn't do it, so. Same here, no changes. No changes. Alright, just trying to wait to see what that was blowing the wind blowing something. Okay, but that's about it. Another additional thing that crews, small, we're getting smaller. We'll see you find out what my criticism is going to be about the day of tomorrow. I just opened the airs back already. So we can move forward on that. They definitely make a progress on the floors. But the Ferdinand is working like overtime, seems like. Alright, folks. Alright, just second. I'm gonna find out later why they're wetting. I'm not sure why, but they're wetting this before they're using. I'll find out and add a little bit here what's going on. Let me go talk to the world guy right now. Okay.
