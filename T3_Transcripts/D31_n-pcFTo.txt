"canned-SISIG is much better when sauted"
so we're gonna make sandwich with sauted SISIG

i'm not sure, but we're gonna make it our way
fusion style?
right, Korean-Filipino fusion
Frist, just SISIG sandwich and......
second, korean style SISIG sandwich
with...this...BULDAK sauce (SUPER SPICY)
I will spread this in sandwich
at first, let's cook SISIG

no-buffet today?    - I didn't go there
                                 -why?
things like that happen, too...
SUBS ask us
"why did smith go to buffet everyday?"
and they are wondering about your formal-suit
but that's a secret
we will answer all of you
when 100k Q&A
(+why just KIM & LEE? not KIM & LEE & WOO )
well-sauted
well-cooked

let's do the magic that becomes delicious
-except Smith, he's not good at magic
dont do that                        (ma...gic)

ji-ki-nae (awesome)/Busan slang
it looks delicious
no salt?
- Woo already add it
hey thats rude
