 Alright, today I'm with Francis and his daddy Mook and then Raymond is coming behind us eventually and we're going to find some bamboo today. Hey bro. It's a hot day today. Woo! That sun is in full force. Hot, do you like this? Huh? Yeah, it's a hot day. Good thing we got our hats on. No good. You can eat this but not today. Me like. Oh! Oh! Mmm, mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Do you eat it or are you stuck on it? Mmm, doesn't know. Do you swallow it? Mmm. It's hot pop, it's hot pop. It's hot pop, it's hot pop. It almost tastes like black licorice. But not as good. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. No, I don't want more. I think we've gone in that one. Wow, he's got a mouthful. Mmm. Wow. Mmm. He likes it. I guess everybody has a different kind of taste. Has anybody out there tried this before? I'm not sure the exact name but. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. I can't see it. I can't see it. I can't see it. I can't see it. I can't see it. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Look at all these. We got prickers here, prickers here. Look at these prickers down there. Mmm. Every where you walk, get to be careful. Mmm. Mmm. Okay, that's the tree we just cut down. We just cut down. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. So we're trying to get up there and that tree is going to help them get up higher. That was a smart idea. He's going to clean all that out first and he's going to get to the bamboo. There it goes. You can see that's the big bamboo that just fell down. So we're going to go over here and try to get it. The hardest part is trying to get it out of here. All that brush. There's thorns everywhere. It's really hard to get to. You muck it up there right now trying to clean the bamboo and get it down. It's a long process. Okay. There's one long piece of bamboo. Father bamboo. Father bamboo. That's not even all of it. He cut it a lot of it off. It's going to be a long process. It's going to go off. It's going to go off. Brilliant. Mind. Raymond, you're a genius. Oh! This is what the bamboo looks like with all these branches on them. We're going to take them all off. Be careful. I'm going to bamboo graveyard over here. Oh, this way? Cheers, buddy. I love to ants on me. Do you have any ants on you? Oh, thank you. I was about to blow it off and you've got it. Raymond is using his genius tool to get that bamboo way up there. As you can see, this is not an easy job. Okay. Oh, yes. There's no way we could have got those if it wasn't for this. Raymond, you've been working hard in there. You want me to sing a song? Yeah, I'm tired now. I'm single, single. You want me to sing that? Francis, will you help me sing it? Yeah. All right. Twinkle, twinkle, little star. How I wonder what you are. Your picture's shoe? Yeah. Nice. How'd you do it? What'd you do? Oh, look at that. His shoe was ripped and he put some sticks in there. That is brilliant mine right there. Bro, are you bleeding? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, ten. So this is not Raymond's land. So what we do is cut down, Raymond is actually going to pay for these bamboo. For three of them, it's 100. 100 pesos. How much did you get to pay for these? Only 100. 100 for three? Yeah. All right, cool. Let's go. Okay, see we got three all together, but some of these are in pieces. Yeah, these are small, so we had to cut these. And that one is going to be for the fruit picker. All right, we're just going to take one. It's not too bad. I think I need to scoot it up just to dead. All right, this is kind of hard to videotape and carry this at the same time. So I'll see you back at the house. Oh, you're in our Filipino. Hey, hey. Hey, what's this guy? Hey, how are you? I got a bamboo pole. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Raymond. What do you guys do now here? Yeah, five feet. Knees are going to be for the roof? No. Oh, for the side. Okay, cool. Yeah. I think the piece of the high-peer to why it'd be happy. You're the hardest working guy, you know. All right, we're going to make five feet pieces with the bamboo. Yeah. Yeah, he'll grab the helper. He'll grab the helper. Yeah. Right here. Wow, really like mine. So I give you now five minutes, five minutes and one week. While you're cutting that song for you. A song, okay. That'll help me work faster. This song is for my future wife also. Okay. Yeah. You got it. You got it. Let's start. You. I never get bored of that song, Raymond. I never get to sing this song. I think it's that same song. It'll be copy. Can't let that you. I can't believe that you are here. How did I ever find you? That's enough. Wow. Are you crying? No. Thank you. See one song? See one song? Yeah. All right. Right now. I took her out. It was a Friday night of Wokalon to get the feeling right. We started making out and she took off my pants. But then I turned on the TV. And that's about the time she walked away from me. Nobody likes you when you're 20. Teng Teng. Wutia kabali li. Wucabagali. Sakata hukata huk. Pingaska saputi ngabai bayu. Wow. That was a good one. Yeah. I can't remember all that. Tingaska. Tingaska.
