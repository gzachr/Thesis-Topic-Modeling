I heard this so much because of my friends who sing this in the middle of the school. Sounds familiar. Yeah. It's one of my friends. He's like a lot of people. He plays it in the middle of the school. When you're in school, you listen to the music. I've seen this song for a long time. I don't fancy it. I'm really into Korean. I said it's finished. I hear this often. Like in taxi. Yes. It's kind of dramatic. I don't know why it's so happy and funny. Is this kind of a happy song? What their face is like. Or maybe because of the genre. It's rock song. They have to do that kind of song. Well I cannot understand the lyrics but I like the song. It's my type. Even his action. He's very mad. It's so early 2000s. It sounds like he's heartbroken. And he's screaming in the song. Wow. I'm just so amused with the motion. Yeah. They're doing it so big. They shout that I can't understand what they're saying. It's so hard. This music video is just like this. I don't know what this song is. Yeah. It's like a movie. It's like a movie. This is like the classic Filipino rock song. It makes my body move like that. I think I can sing to it already. Really? The lines are so... Oh really? You understand it? No. The melody is easy. Maybe it's the same. Just for the glips of the girl. Oh. So who is this character? Because there's Dean and Darna. So I get it. The girl is Darna. Like she's not yet a superhero. Her name is Narda. And then Dean gives her the rock. When she swallows the rock, she becomes Darna. What's my good love? I can't only send it out to you in a song. It's about Darna, right? Darna's the superhero character. I know Darna. No, no, no. It's not... What's his name though? Guy, the side character. Dean. I know that one. He's like a calling for.

Is it a song called Old Song? I mean, the music video is a bit like Old Style. Yeah. I don't know. But I don't know this song. I don't know this song. I know this. But like not that deep. You've heard this song before. Yeah, it's cool. They played it up there. I think I kind of hear the lyrics more than the one I love. Maybe the song is about friendship. I'm trying to understand this song. It looks like friends are all staying in a single house. Like home-stay. But is it the love song? Love song? You know what Tarana is? It's like Sarah Day. Yeah. It's a love song. I think it sounds like they're childhood. They're going back. I think this is the first time I ever heard it. Sarah Day, they're like, where is like God? Yeah. I like the way he sings. It's really like natural. I'm really trying to understand this music video in this song. I've seen the part. I've seen the part where I'm singing. The three of them is like Old Song. Yeah. But it's so famous. It's so clear. It's like... It's the connection of... What's the connection with the snake? The chest, the word, the guitar. And that... The song? Wheel, the grass. It's so fast. It's so fast. It's so fast. It's so fast. It's a bit... It's about Sarah needing someone. Yeah. But then he's asking, Is Sarah needing someone to be a popular? But then I don't get it. How does it match with the music video? Yeah. Because it's about Sarah needing to a girl, right? In the song, she's going to be a big girl. But the tension and this song is so sincere. It's like this. I thought it was about friendship. Yeah, me too. Aren't you this star? And I'm reading men. It's a really typical series. Sarah and Abby. Oh, this is called Sarah needs. I love the song. It's like very cheesy. Yeah. It's like a very cheesy romantic thing. Perfect for Valentine's Day. Yeah.

Growing up. So it's like reminiscing their old days, like their childhood. Yeah. Walaang asawa. The girl. So she got pregnant. But she doesn't have a husband. Oh. Oh, what? Oh. Oh. It's so hard to understand the story. What? It's very sad song. Yeah, it's just believing. What's that? It's like the opposite of their childhood. What? Wemboin. I think Filipinon, Adeside. They're like this song. Like when they're having innokin. Yeah. What does that mean? What does that mean? Oh. Song is relaxing. The music video is so creepy. What does that mean? Is it like a ritual? She passed away. She got killed. She got killed. She got killed. She moved. What? It's scary. She's crazy. Maybe it's their childhood friends. Childs' friends? Like that girl is their childhood friend. Stop romantic. Yeah. Like the candles? Yeah. Oh, damn. It really looks like a ritual. It really looks like a ritual. Like, he regrets not saying I love you. What? I mean the title is the whole name of Wembo. It's like the last name of the dance. It's scary. I think it's a bit scary. What the song is nice. Oh. How? Her spirit is gone. It's like a ritual ritual. Very sad. Hulling. Elbimbo. Elbimbo. So it's a type of dance. Elbimbo. The last Elbimbo. See this? They were like two young people. Yeah. My body's different when the record plays. I'm caught between the swing of your hips and your tenders there. What? I heard that you have a child already, but the knees post is gone. Oh, okay. So her life was a bit like Ms. Rubble. Yeah. One night you were ran over on the dark lane. See? Goosebumps? You were right. It was kind of a... Yeah. See Goosebumps here. So cute. Oh. Elbimbo. Elbimbo. The other one they were dancing. Like, like, like, they saw this like this and this and this. I saw the first child. Did you have a child already? They were dancing right with the candles on. So the girl was already dead and... I like that last night that you have taught my heart how to truly love. I think for a couple of months and after this I believe you. Yeah. When you listen to the song at first, it doesn't seem like such a dark, like, sad song. And you actually read lyrics and like look through it. It's like, oh, okay. Yeah. And one evening you were hit by a car in a dark alley. All of my dreams doesn't amount. Oh. I guess my dream is to be the only place where I can dance with you. I don't think I said that. Yeah. Like, it's just like, oh, you learned the truth of the story. What are your thoughts on both classic OPM in relation to current OPM now that you've watched and listened to a number of music videos and songs through our series? It has, like, a story. Like, from the start to the... There's a storyline these days. You should eat up music, focus more on the... I see. ...the rhyme. It does not have that meaning and stories, but like the classical OPM. It's the same. Just very good. If I were to understand the lyrics while watching the music video, it's so easy to catch the story. But then the videos today, you still have to dig. Like, what's the... What's so feel of the dark? The dark color between the... Why does she have red hair? Like, what's the meaning? It's hard to find out the message, but then this classic OPM music videos are much more easy. But for us, it's hard because you don't understand the lyrics. I like the mood of the music video because there's this retro feel. Yeah, you will remember a girl on the day of the morning. Yeah, you're a girl. So I remember my old days. I thought some like, for a space, their songs are like influenced by those songs. Because also the four space was like something about rock. Somehow a cassette, a very diverse genre. They all are familiar with it. I think it's a bit embarrassing to come here and make a good song. I think it's easy to make a good song. For sure, the music here in the Philippines are influenced by the past, past, and singers. You told us a while ago. They were the first people that were awarded in New York. And of course, young Filipinos who were listening to those songs were influenced and inspired them. I think the music scene now is going back. It's starting to go back to that kind of trend from what I've seen. Yeah, the Mabaka. Yeah, like certain songs, certain bands, they brought that style back, which is really cool. It's keeping that generation up and not letting that culture die. I think news and errations are just trying to follow the trends. Like, what can make the music hit? But there are also songs that we should follow the trends. I mean, the traditional Filipino songs and which is good to hear. I don't know why, but it's keep on stuck in my mind and keep repeating in my head. So I think it's good.
