Yeah, yeah. Oh, okay. And yeah, look at these the nose. Mm-hmm. His very nose again. Yeah, the nose. He looks like idols. For me, he looks like more of a... Not an idol look.

Yeah, Chinese and Filipino. Yeah, actually, there's a lot of Chinese Filipino. A really, yeah. Yeah. I think you'd be really, really, really popular in Korea. Yeah, it's like broad shoulders. I think he has the hype. If I saw him in the street, he's worth two glasses. James Raid, oh, he's also famous, right? He's also very Western. Hmm. I have a friend who looks like him. He's taken, sorry. No, he's not. He's not anything. You know what? Oh my gosh. Tom, from Philippine Idol, right? Yeah. He has a lot of the judge. Because my friend was there. And so, Gussian, he looks more Western. Does he have contact? Yes, I think so. He looks like a typical Filipino guy. Uh-huh. I think it's because of his shade and growth. And also maybe double eyelid? Yeah. I've met him before in real life. Yeah, as in... No, no, no, no, not me! No! I like Chris. I didn't know that he's James Raid. I was with my friend and she was like, Jenny, that guy. He's James Raid. So I was like, okay. Not that tall, but his handsome. He don't know me, but I know him. One side is, one side is friendship. Fresh. He's actually like the hard throb in the Philippines. Oh, it's a bit of model. He's a model, actor, singer. Singer? Yeah, he's a singer too. He came out from PBB. It's like a reality show in the Philippines. Australia and Filipino. Pretty face. We can call him as the flower boy too. He has idol looks. Yeah, and especially the... His skin is really good. And the hip face. He has a nice skin. He looks like those heighting guys. Among the six Filipino celebrities featured, who would you consider as your ideal type? Or who fits your personal preferences? One, two, three. Out of the year. It's so lucky to have a friend like this. Because we never match. Especially when it comes to guys. So why out then? He's hot. That's like everything. I don't like friends in fairy tales. I like the bodyguards of the princess. Oh, okay. So we're so different. Because I like friends and elves in the Philippines. Fairy tales and Daniel Patila looks like an elf. And I think his personality would be like fun. I thought Shen Lim. I don't know. Shen Lim. He has the skewedness in him. I really like wild hot guys. Like, out and rich her. Daniel. For me, and Rick, when I just see the picture, he has more worrying, gentle, but... But I have to choose one. I'll go with the, what's his name? Al Den. Yeah, I really have to choose one. Shen Lim. 61, 26, I cannot. I like it, you know. When I see this picture, faces his shop. No size and draw lines. That's why I like it. Me? I like C&Lan because it looks like he has muscles. And before he can draw, he has a very sexy look. He has like that Asian vibe, but also the same thing that European vibe. He looks charming. Like I said, he's worth two glances. I think he stands out. Among the six, who would fit the generally accepted South Korean standard of beauty best and why? Al Den, Coco Martín, for Shen Lim. They're more of He U Sang. Ah, actor, field, and for them. James Lane, idols. And Rick. Daniel. They look like idols. Yeah, that's him. Yeah. For younger generations, I think they would like, idol type of guys. Like Daniel, but Daniel, for like 20, 30 years, for the actor, like, like, Dynasties. Ah, yeah. So this is all. So this is all. I think they know. And Imino. Daniel. Daniel. Yeah, Daniel. What? Because he's handsome. Right. It's more of the Eastern, not like the other guys. I mean, he looks cool. Like we can't deny that he's handsome or cool, but he's handsome. And then I went out, or so his commercial, I felt that like, oh he has a similar vibe, but he's right. I'm. C&Lan, because it's half-changed. So that's why. Maybe? Yeah. And then also. Sanctum. Okay. Actually, my Korean girlfriends also think that the Pinot guys are handsome. I think it's dependent person. True. So that's why we cannot choose exactly, yeah, it is. But if Liky comes to Korea, maybe a lot of Korean girls right, right. Like he. I agree with you. For you, like, yeah. I think C&L would be really like, now that you've seen these Filipinos celebrities, what do you think are the ideal physical standards for males amongst Filipinos? You like handsome guys. Like, be their faces really attractive. There's no need to look at the hide if your face is this handsome. All of them are so good looking. Yeah. Anyone who looks like Daniel but you have a out-and-reachered cohort to give us contact through LCMail. First sharp shape of the face. Sharp jawline. When they smile, there was kind of like a bright energy, like charm, something like that, especially for Daniel. Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah. But I think Filipino doesn't really mind about their height. Because I sold some of the actors. But they're not really tall. But there's really handsome day, most focus more on their facial expression, how they act. Double eyelid, thick rose, sexy jawline. Someone looks mature, something like, amoeu guy. If the man has everything, high, good skin, sharp, it's perfect. If you just walk, that's it. Based on my experience living in the Philippines, the ideal physical standards among Filipinos is like to have this manly look. You know, you gotta be like, strong, rather than flower boy, or idol looking looks. Well, here in Korea, there are like different types of guys. There are like slim, lovely boy look. But I don't think those kind of look would be ideal in the Philippines.
