Good afternoon everyone!
As you can see, I'm not with Desiray
I have a plan.
We will buy groceries
I will buy dried fish
salted egg. Eggplant.
and then white rice
I will make Desiray eat this food
Then vinegar and tomato
She always cooks for me
Today, I will cook for her
Still Filipino dishes
Everyone watch this new cooking episode.
I'm here at the store
We will look for that dried fish
Eggplant
Of course, this will always be included
She liked this one
I think this is the one
I'm going to get this one for me

I think she will like this one
This is expensive
five dollars
Eggplant
Big Eggplant
I do not see any dried fish
I'll buy this in case we cook adobo

Everyone, I do not see dried fish
They have different types of fish
It's still different if they have dried fish
