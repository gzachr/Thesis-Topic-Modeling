The only thing you see in the home... ...is that I can't play the top of the street. I'm not producing anything about... ...getting a lot of stuff. Yeah, that's... If they get large numbers of drunk people, all of them... ...in the future, which is a really good culture that I'm looking for. Americans may have drinks on their street. Sure. So... ...somebody joins. If somebody joins, say, the nationality... ...they're going to face me again, the Chinese. The nationality will be there, if there's a majesty seat. It's a big culture.
