 They have a special shake here in Ube Shake, which is a Manila exclusive, and then they also have a Christmas hot cocoa shake. Ding dong, I got some hot cocoa. Ding dong, Dante's. I thought his first name was Ding and his last name was Dong. Oh, that's pretty sick, Mr. Dong. Sit by the fire and have a nice hot cocoa. Well, this is a cold hot cocoa. How can something be frozen and hot? I don't know. Shake Shacks, usually pretty thick. This is not looking too thick. Very festive. Whoa, it really tastes like hot chocolate, but it's really strong. It tastes like cocoa powder. Just straight up. Let me get a marshmallow that's supposed to pour in. That's epic. The Manila exclusive shake, the Ube Shake. Whoa, it's purple. This one's thicker. Good. It's amazing. When you're craving it, you just gotta drop the pesto you know what I'm saying? Drop. The pesto's dropping all these pesto's.
