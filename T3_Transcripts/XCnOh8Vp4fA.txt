good morning everyone welcome back to manila 
we are currently on a bus headed south to  
target we just got on the bus now i think 
it's gonna take about an hour and a half  
the time is currently 10 53 so should 
be there by half 12. yeah so far  
so far so good everything's going 
smoothly excited to explore a little  
a little is it a town it's a civilian it's 
another city yeah oh okay but yeah it looks  
like there's exciting things to do all night so 
yeah nice to get a little day trip up to manila
welcome to top7 we have just arrived even though 
there's 85 000 people here it doesn't seem very  
built up it seems quite spread out from looking at 
google maps and on the bus ride on the way in so  
obviously that means the attractions are spread 
out as well so hopefully we will be able to get  
around and see what we want to see because 
we are only here for a few hours saying that  
we haven't had anything to eat yet so we're going 
to head to a jolly beach it's very quick and easy  
yeah shouldn't take long and then we can start 
exploring targeted and see we won't see yeah  
we've got a couple of stops uh on our list so 
hopefully we'll be able to hit most of them today
there's a nice little shopping mall to 
be fair the shopping mall culture here  
in the philippines has got to be unmatched i've 
never seen anything like that no neither of us  
so different desserts every place you go 
there's just like big shopping malls and  
big food courts and they're always just very 
impressive so many different types of restaurants  
and stuff but anyway we're gonna head to our first 
stop now what i've noticed so far from the city it  
seems to be split into two so you've got a bit 
above the mountain or on top of the mountain  
and then down by the lakeside as well yeah 
and we're currently on top of the mountain  
seems to be like the main sort of center of 
the city uh and we're gonna take a walk about  
half hour to our first stop of the day and we 
should be able to get some pretty good views yeah
i can't believe this view was from a starbucks  
car park this isn't even where we were hiding we 
just spotted it on the way we're in a starbucks  
car park and that's the view i can't see 
is the volcano the big one in the middle
i think this is the volcano just here i'm not 100 
sure but i think it might be from the google maps  
direction it looks like it is yeah yeah it's 
very small isn't it yeah it is actually the
one of the smallest active volcanoes 
in the world well the tarvo kit yeah  
well fed do not know that i don't think it is 
the smallest but i think it's definitely one off  
one of the smallest 4k i've never seen a volcano 
neither i i did read that you can actually take a  
hike up the volcano or the tall volcano however 
it's currently closed for tourists it recently  
erupted in like march oh is that why it's close 
to tourists yeah probably it wasn't a very bigger  
option this viewpoint is classed though and this 
isn't even the view probably would go into also  
how more done is this starbucks right there and 
you've got a view of the lake so we've made it  
to a picnic grove which is this big area like a 
big park there's a bunch of activities you can do  
you can do ziplining horse riding and there's also 
a big lockout apparently so i'm gonna take a walk  
around and see what we come across there's 
also a ferris wheel just through there we've  
been done two ferris wheels in our times in the 
philippines so we probably won't be doing that but  
we'll see we're gonna just head in here 
check it out it seems to be a lot of shops  
so we're gonna check it out whoa okay there's 
a big group we found the viewpoint wow  
you've got this cool little like picnic area 
that's why it's called picnic grove i guess  
and then the lookout is over here with the skywalk 
just up here but yeah this is the awesome view  
and you've got i don't know if you can see just 
right by there that's the volcano the smallest  
one of the smallest volcanoes one of the most 
active volcanoes in the world really cool  
okay we've got the skywalk now and it's even 
better view up here you can see like the whole  
lake pretty much yeah the picnic area down 
here is absolutely massive it stretches like  
so unique as well isn't it like tiny little 
hats and this view was just incredible
they've even got loads of these barbecue pits  
just popped it around so uh you can 
make your own barbecue that's good
another little fun fact about the volcano not 
only is it one of the smallest active volcanoes  
in the world there's an island on a lake which 
sits inside the volcano the volcano itself then  
sits on a lake which sits on the island the island 
of luzon of luzon which is in the sea which is an  
island in itself so it's like a body of water and 
i learned a body of water and either on the body  
of water an island that's pretty cool it's really 
cool it's crazy to think that there's there's a  
little island inside that volcano because although 
the volcano looks small from here when you go over  
on a boat it's probably not yeah it's probably 
massive yeah it would be cool to do like the the  
hike to the top and you can like see inside can't 
you then yeah that would be really really cool  
to do one day i'd love to do some sort of volcano 
hike one day yeah i'm not sure if this is the one  
that you can like camp out as well really yeah 
i've seen i've seen videos of people camping a  
volcano in philippines but i think there's a field 
so that would be pretty cool imagine like waking  
up to a volcano on that one on a lake as well 
that'd be sick that'd be awesome we came around  
these steps to walk back up there's actually of 
like a metal wooden walkway all the way around  
and it heads over here somewhere so we're gonna 
go and check it out it looks as if this bit is  
closed off because it's a bit sketchy looking 
there's some green stuff on the bridge ah yeah
for your safety this area is off-limits
yeah probably not best to go across there isn't 
it yeah that bridge does not look safe the rest  
of it looks fine i think there's a little 
detail though i think it's just this bit  
yeah you can join back on there i mean if this 
is anything to go by bear in mind that's metal
yeah definitely not if that's metal 
that's just the bridge is wood  
yeah not a good idea also this tree's 
been damaged as well i wonder if  
the tree and the bridge is caused by the typhoon 
in december it could be it wouldn't need a lot of  
wind to push this tree down because it's a pretty 
big tree and it doesn't look as if it was like  
dead or anything it looks as if it was quite no a 
pretty healthy tree that's just being taken down
in southeast asia it seems to just start raining 
randomly and we have a massive downpour and  
it really comes down but it was literally just 
sunny now it's pouring down so we've taken cover  
underneath these trees i'm gonna wait for 
it to pass we got stuck in her down before  
it's still raining lords it stopped 
for a bit we started leaving  
and i was hammering down i think we're just 
gonna try and get back to manila but we need  
to get to the bus station uh it's like a 40 
minute walk it leaves in half hour we probably  
won't make if we walk so we're gonna try and 
flag down one of these little tuk-tuki things  
hopefully they'll stop and they'll see us we 
literally just made the bus he was leaving  
as we were getting on and we got soaking 
wet and the air comes on it's very easy
you
