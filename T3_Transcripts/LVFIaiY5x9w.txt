brought to you by Squarespace
these days when we're traveling it's not so 
much about ticking off a list of places we've  
been countries we've visited it's more about 
experiences the experiences that last forever  
and build amazing memories that we can look back 
on with fondness and shape the lives we live  
going forward paddy never forget this feeling 
this is beautiful magical experience so if you  
come into the Philippines and you're researching 
your trip right now and you're looking for cool  
experiences things that will maximize your trip 
and maximize your experience in the Philippines  
then this video will be very useful for you 
if you're new here my name is Paddy Doyle I  
just got back from the Philippines I've been all 
over southeast Asia and we're soon to head into  
some new and exciting countries having Next 
Level Adventures so subscribe and join the  
adventure and let's begin the best experiences 
in the Philippines number one The Tao experience  
we're going to start with the best experience that 
I had in the Philippines and something that you  
should build your trip to the Philippines around 
and that is a Expedition from El Nido to Quran or  
you can go the other way from Quran to El Nido 
you'll be sailing across the ocean for at least  
three days now there are lots of different 
companies the company that I chose was Tau  
Philippines and I'll link them in the description 
I paid 750 US dollars for a six day Expedition  
now there are shorter cheaper Expeditions and 
there are other companies to look at I chose  
them because they had the most incredible wooden 
vessel called the balotick and when we set sail  
and when we were on the open ocean we just had 
an incredible time and you spent six days going  
to beautiful islands incredible beaches camping 
in bamboo Huts every night and we had some of  
the best food I've ever had in my entire life 
all cooked aboard the beautiful boats and yes  
this was by far the best experience I had in the 
Philippines when you think of the Philippines in  
your mind and you think of those turquoise 
Maldives style Waters and white sand beaches  
and tropical palm tree islands and who would have 
thought you could come to somewhere like this and  
have it to yourself and just live in a postcard 
moment and like I said before a great reason and  
an excuse just to come to the Philippines for 
this some of the best snorkeling some of the  
best sunsets and memories made and definitely 
the best experience I had in the Philippines  
hands down I do realize that this travel Vlog is 
ridiculous but this is a ridiculous experience  
and as you can tell I highly recommend it number 
two climbing Mount Apo my second best experience  
in the Philippines was climbing Mount Apo now 
again there are different ways you can do this  
basically Mount Apo is the tallest mountain in 
the Philippines it's actually a semi dormant  
slash little bit active volcano there's sulfur 
coming through the ground I don't think it's going  
to blow anytime soon don't worry it is a real 
Adventure it's getting to the top again there's  
a few different ways you can take a I think you 
can even go up and down in one day if you take  
the VIP Express hike I heard about that one most 
people do it over two days I did the Mount Apo  
circuit which was a three day two night hike and 
at the summit you're just above 3000 meters this  
isn't climbing Mount Everest you know at the 
summit you will need a jacket and a little hat  
and it does get quite cold in the evenings but you 
know there's no snow there's no ice and you don't  
have to worry about altitude sickness you'll be 
sweating at the beginning through some of the most  
beautiful Mossy Forest environments the volcano 
itself sits on an island called Mindanao which  
is in the South and you'll need to fly to a city 
called Davao and then from there you can organize  
a hike make sure you find these sites online I'll 
link the company that I used in the description  
and make sure you give them a notice of about two 
to three weeks minimum so you do need to go on a  
trek with other people with a guide and eye groups 
up with about 15 local Filipino people we went up  
to the summit and had an incredible time difficult 
yes but we're talking about experiences the second  
best experience I had in the Philippines 
and something that I will never forget  
top of the world or at least on 
the top of the Philippines anyway
[Music]
if by the way you're in the market for a great 
professional looking website for your business  
then I really recommend the company that I use 
and the sponsor of this video Squarespace I've  
been using Squarespace now for nearly two

professional looking website using one of their 
templates you find one that you like replace your  
photos and put your own videos and your own text 
Squarespace have loads of other things that you  
can do you can link your social media you can

products behind a paywall and there's so many 
other features on squarespace's website head  
over to squarespace.com right now stop playing 
around with building a website see how easy it  
is and when you're ready to launch it head to 
squarespace.com forward slash Paddy Doyle and  
you'll get 10 off number three sailing in 
Boracay at sunset this is a gorgeous little  
island easily reachable from Cebu or Manila 
by a one-hour flight or a ferry once you get  
to Boracay and the reason people come is it 
looks beautiful it has these beautiful beaches  
there's lots of nightlife and there's kite surfing 
there's lots of things to do it's very busy  
because it's so popular because it's so beautiful 
but the best experience on the island for me is  
going on a Sunset Cruise with these sailing boats 
that are wind powered 100 wind powered the sun's  
going down so I'm thinking guys we should try 
and organize one of these boats behind me here  
they're all kind of just like parked up here and 
there are maybe a hundred plus that line up on the  
beach every evening around 5pm and just as the 
sun's starting to go down you can negotiate to  
share a boat with some of your friends other 
strangers I saw strangers grouping together  
to cut the cost or you can find a captain and 
negotiate a solo price and just go out there on  
your own with your captain and a few trusty crew 
and you just set sails and you head out to sea  
and the Sun is sitting in front of you and it's 
just amazing it's very quiet it's very peaceful  
I thought that they would you know I know they 
have sales but I didn't I thought they would have  
an engine and it was just like a pretend Sailing 
Boat but this is a hundred percent powered by the  
wind you just set sails and the wind's blowing 
and it's just a real cool sailing experience
right still with us at teamviewana with 
Captain Chris yeah let's have fun all right
number four swimming with sardines in 
Mobile in the island of Cebu there is  
a town called mobile this place is 
famous for diving and snorkeling  
and there's quite a few things to do but by 
far the best thing I did was the Sardine run  
which is basically a natural phenomenon where a 
big group of sardines swim along the reef when I  
flew my drone I saw obviously the shallow Waters 
and then that big dark blue drop off and that drop  
off is where the sardines go up and down every day 
I believe you can go on a tour and pay a guide and  
we'll go out and you'll follow him and they'll 
know where to take you to find them but I just  
thought I could fly my drone and I did and when 
I flew my drone I saw some people swimming and I  
flew the Drone high up in the sky looked down and 
I saw the ball of Sardine so I knew where to go I  
landed my drone rented a snorkel for cheap and 
just swam out there and on my way back I saw a  
beautiful turtle and swimming with the sardines 
was an incredible experience swimming with  
millions of sardines in the turquoise crystal 
clear waters of Mobile in Cebu don't forget
foreign
[Music] number five the ultimate tour in karon I 
did the ultimate boat tour now there's three or  
four different boat tours based in Quran and this 
is a touristy thing guys you know you are going  
on a boat with other tourists other Backpackers 
and you're going to be going in groups of 10 to  
12 other boats going to the same destinations so 
there is that element to it you definitely feel  
like a tourist because you are but you know it's 
one of those when you get clumped together but  
you cannot deny how good the experience is even 
though it is a bit cramped because the places  
they take you to there's freshwater lagoons where 
there's no corals and these lagoons are surrounded  
by Limestone Cliffs and it's just incredible 
there are reefs that go around the Limestone  
Cliffs and you can just go snorkeling Do Your Own 
Thing get away from the crowds like I did and have  
a real intimate beautiful experience in the ocean 
it was really Unforgettable and you just sail from  
place to place you have lunch in Paradise you swim 
in Paradise you snorkel in Paradise you hang out  
you're with other people enjoying yourself and 
you can fly the Drone and get incredible footage  
you can swim again I swam with fish a big ball 
of sardines not as big as the one in Mobile but  
still really magical experience on the way home 
drinking a beer at Sunset I thought to myself yes  
this was quite touristy but I'll never forget how 
great that experience was and yeah when you're in  
Quran going on a boat tour is a must you can do 
it privately and ask your captain and organize to  
go away from the crowd or go in a different 
order I was at the end of my trip and on a  
budget so I just hopped along with all the rest 
of the Backpackers so this is the secret Lagoon  
and most people come here by 
kayak you can kayak around  
or you can swim and then climb 
up the ladders like we just did
man
[Music]  
number six exploring the Spanish quarter of Manila  
I had a really great experience in a certain area 
of Manila now a lot of people Overlook Manila they  
land they hear bad things and so they don't spend 
much time there and I really enjoyed my time in  
Manila you can check out my Manila Vlog in full 
but the first couple of days I stayed in the old  
quarter or some people call it the Spanish quarter 
because of the colonial history and this part of  
Manila is so unique compared to anywhere else in 
Southeast Asia if you've been going to Vietnam  
Lao Cambodia Thailand for example and then you're 
coming to the Philippines you should definitely  
come and walk the Cobble streets see the horse and 
carts see the cathedrals and the old buildings and  
the historical forts there's a real atmosphere 
there it feels like you've been transported into  
this tropical Spanish Colonial Town and it's just 
got a really cute charm to it and all the locals  
who live in the old quarter they hang out on the 
streets they eat street food there's kids playing  
there's people playing basketball you just walk 
around no cars so it's really nice and pleasant  
to walk around definitely at least spend a 
full day exploring the old quarter of Manila  
it was a great experience and something I'll never 
forget do you know where the fort Santiago is yes
that's useful
7. exploring El Nido next up was renting a 
motorcycle and just going and exploring the  
area of El Nido El Nido is very famous it's got 
beautiful islands and lots of beaches and it's  
famous again because people go on the group 
tours the boat tours that's great and I did  
that and I've got my El Nido video here for 
you to watch and you can see me going on one  
of the tours but the second part of the video 
details this experience which was for me one  
of the best experiences in the Philippines just 
rent a little cheap motorcycle easily done in  
El Nido and just go around the area it's a 
huge northern tip of the island of Palawan  
and you could spend two to three days going to 
different beaches different little Villages go  
up to the mountains there's waterfalls there's 
viewpoints there's beaches with beach clubs and  
places to get beers and restaurants or 
there's tiny little coves you can Trek  
to there's so much to do once you get out of El 
Nido town which is a great town in itself it's  
karaoke there's lots of good restaurants 
and that's where the hustle and bustle in  
El Nido is but just getting on a motorbike 
setting sails for the open road have a list  
on Google maps of a few places you want to 
check out but in between just enjoy one of  
the most beautiful islands in the world which is 
Palawan and just exploring El Nido freestyling is  
I have memory I'll never forget look at this 
one of the planes coming into land to El Nido
a flight from Manila it's a lot more expensive 
because it goes directly to El Nido town and you  
skip the five-hour minivan from Puerto Princesa 
now it's time for some honorable mentions  
there's a couple more things to mention you might 
be sitting here saying wait a minute he missed  
this place he missed that place I only was in the 
Philippines for five weeks I tried my best to see  
some other touristy places and get off the Beaten 
Track and get that mixed varied experience I will  
be going back I have a list just quickly some 
honorable mentions that I didn't go to but I've  
heard are incredible there is the two bahata Reef 
sorry if I said that wrong it's quite difficult  
this reef is out deep far away from Palawan and 
it's apparently one of the marvels of the world  
another great experience I was recommended to 
do but didn't have time was go swimming with  
whale sharks in Don Seoul very important that 
you go to Don Sol and not to oslob because in  
my opinion oslob is a manufactured whale shark 
experience they are wild and they swim there but  
it look and swim the best way to do it is go to 
don'sol and there was the Mayon Volcano this is  
just an incredible looking mountain again you 
can go trekking up there something I missed but  
doesn't it look incredible so if I go back to the 
Philippines The Reef swimming whale sharks in Don  
salt and this beautiful volcano they're the three 
experiences that I'll be chasing now my Series  
has been fully positive I've touched on things 
that stressed me out and shared little moments  
that you know the Philippines will throw at you 
just like anywhere okay travel is not perfect  
but very soon I'm going to be doing a Philippine 
debrief and I'll be doing it live so make sure  
you are subscribed if you don't see the live as it 
happens it'll be repeated and shared on my channel  
somewhere but I'm going to be doing a Philippines 
debris where I go over my entire trip from start  
to finish and I'll be sharing with you all of the 
raw difficult uncomfortable stressful moments from  
my trip and it will be yeah live stream with the 
audience you're invited to join have a great time  
in the Philippines stay safe and I'll see you 
very soon from Singapore bye for now [Music]
