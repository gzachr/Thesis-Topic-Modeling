But we've always called it Moon Cafe. Oh, so they have not only coffee cakes but also like pancakes. Maybe it's called Cafe because it's not that there's a really small business. It's a winehouse and it grew into a restaurant because it was bought by a business. Wow, I see. So today we cannot ride to... Moon Cafe!
