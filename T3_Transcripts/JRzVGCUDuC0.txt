current area also a comparison video over a  
convenience store Fried Chicken critter review 
of one of the best food holes in vanilla and  
of course only rice challenge at the Hmong 
innocent this is really nice so make sure to  
watch the entire five-part series and today 
we'll get to know more about our guests from  
Sweden a hungry tiger well that's that's very 
broad I think if you're gonna question me like  
that my name is Tiger I come from Sweden and I'm 
a chef and now I'm making youtube videos about  
food yeah and I'm today I'm also collaborating 
with my friend Eric who is holding the camera  
food mama and I mean Philippines now for a 
month and I've been travelling for ten months  
why did you name your channel a hungry tiger 
because my name is tiger and I'm always hungry  
[Music] what do you do before doing YouTube I 
already told you I'm a chef a very good chef  
maybe even the best chef depends on who is my 
competitor what did i do i went to chef school  
for three years and then i started cooking in 
during and after that time so mostly been cooking  
all during that time what are the countries 
you've traveled here ten countries so far I  
think if my math is not bad I think it started 
in Thailand and I went to Malaysia Indonesia  
Singapore Vietnam Japan Korea Taiwan and here as 
well other countries but you know what my list is  
for beyond those countries I want to go to as many 
countries as possible how would you differentiate
are usually spicy sweet and 
there's a lot of rice noodles
and Asian people are very passionate 
about food that is what I like most  
and that is also why I'm here 
traveling alone seems difficult
that's a good question sometimes I ask I ask 
myself why but the thing is even if you're  
traveling you won't be that lonely there's 
people everywhere you go and I would say that  
I was more lonely in Sweden that out that I am 
here traveling alone travel budget of course I'm  
not made of money I usually stay in hostels which 
costs very little money compared to hotels I try  
to live very cheaply so I eat a lot of street 
food I don't buy anything I'm very minimalistic  
I would say so my budget is maybe like 50 US 
per per day so maybe less actually maybe 40
what are your travel essentials my travel 
essentials have a small backpack as you can  
travel when you don't need to check in your bag 
so you don't need to pay for that and you can  
just grab your bag and go so travel lights is my 
essential have a good backpack just don't bring a  
bunch of stuff you can buy everything here I would 
say travel as local as you can explore the culture  
try to eat local food research where you want to 
go and what you want to do and just don't stress  
about where and what you should do just enjoy life 
have any food poisoning story I of course I do of  
course I do I had a lot of street food and when 
I was in the beginning of my trip that could be  
like four five times per day I eat street food 
and I went pretty crazy so in the beginning I  
think I've had like food poisoning three times 
over ten month period so I would a wooden flag  
suggest people not to like go eat street food 
because obviously any food can be pretty unsafe  
but just look at the food look does it look good 
you know it's there does it smell bad and just  
precautions you know nothing crazy how do you 
maintain your shape while eating honestly I'm  
blessed I I can eat a lot and nothing happens 
I don't know what magic that is but it's true  
you forced me kidding I know Filipinos are very 
friendly people I know they have one of the best  
beaches in the world there's a lot of interest in 
street foods around here and I want to go as many  
countries as possible but your favorite Filipino 
foods no don't I've only been here a week actually  
I knew before I came here I knew nothing about 
the Filipino food but you showed me sitting which  
is really flavorful and nice and then like just 
generally like barbecue chicken and then thinks  
that it's barbecue please favorite Filipino food 
Oh least favorite I already told you I haven't  
had that much I have to give a compact but for 
the dishes that we've tried what's the least
[Applause] right yeah I mean crickets 
crickets probably I mean it's not that  
bad but it's not your lighter it's just it's 
not I would eat crickets for breakfast like  
we did in my video on my channel potato 
why I don't know because it sounds funny  
[Music] if you're to cook for your 
channel what digital you prepare
our to cook something crazy 
like a whole kangaroo maybe  
I mean if I were to cook on my channel 
I don't that's the way that's a reason  
I started traveling and make food videos 
was to separate myself from the kitchen
the whole kangaroos my other are these years he'll 
five years from now five years oh my god that's  
far look my dream is very simple I don't have any 
big dreams per se but I would say that I would  
love to have a channel that I can be developing 
over time and has it as my job you know like  
that would be awesome what are your plans after 
the Philippines what my plans are first of all  
I need a little bit of a break so I'm gonna hit 
those nice beaches here and of course I'm gonna  
try to eat as much local food as possible so stick 
to stay tuned on my channel for more free to tweet  
videos I mean after the Philippines after the 
Philippines I was gonna go to Hong Kong it's a  
little bit messy there right now but I think China 
is on my list for the next destination so there's  
this segment that called booty mama flatstock so 
we just have to answer real quick Sweden or Japan
did not work I won how I can't give out 
my favorite countries I would say they're  
pretty equal Malaysia or Singapore I think 
I can't give up my favorite I think both are  
great especially when it comes to food I think 
Singapore has the it's they're very intertwined  
they're very mixed Malaysian and Singaporean 
dishes they're both great sunny or snow
that's this in Asia ride crispy pork skin 
with chili and garlic which is a Thai dish  
which I don't remember the name of with 
rice but he's insanely good oh I mean  
I love burgers but if we're talking 
about local food fried rice for and  
nightmares fork and knife come on I'm from 
Sweden chopsticks or barehanded potatoes  
or right potatoes beer for white white 
copy our TV YouTube our Facebook YouTube
I haven't tried balut but I would 
probably say stinky tofu hogs or  
cricket yummy or shut up shut up 
let's go or faster or delete delete
in the future I think it's gonna be a while I 
mean first of all I'm not that big fan of big  
cities and big cities that are crazy when it 
comes to traffic so maybe in the future it's  
gonna be a while I would be so grateful if you 
could consider the fact of taking a look at my  
videos on my channel which is also about 
food about street food and travel take a  
look and see what you think about it and you
