this is my treasure guys oh i'm so
cringe so cute is me
do you remember okay so i don't remember
the whole situation
but let me just explain if you haven't
watched our previous videos i explained
this
a while back ago why i was always
overprotective about her
suzu is literally less than a hundred
pounds she's like five one
and being in new york city small asian
girl
that was kind of like you know that was
kind of like scary for me
i don't know what was going to happen to
her literally i could pick her up with
one arm
and like just throw her in a van right
so that was i was always
over protective about her because at
that point you know she just came here
i didn't want to have to call up her
parents and be like hey your daughter
was with me for this time but something
happened to her that was like my worst
fear
and but now i could care less no i'm
kidding guys i'm kidding
i i still care but now i know she can
handle herself
she has a mean kick and a mean punch her
out her chin
is super sharp so she could just dig
those in anywhere and somebody would
just let go of her
and yeah she can handle herself now but
before then
yeah she's a big girl but before i was
definitely over particular about her and
i i apologize to her and i think we've
we've gotten over that but hearing this
situation is just
oh but you're so cute though it's okay
okay so we brought two love letters from
alvin
and we have two more but i think we're
gonna leave these for
future videos what do you think thank
you please stop it right now i'm
so cringed right now it's oh
he needs some time to rest up and think
again how much he loves me
and wrote another love letters
guys if you have sent love letters to
someone you love find them and burn them
you don't have to go through what i'm
going through right now okay well if
it's from your ex and burn it that's
fine but if it's from your significant
other that you're still
be with don't burn it just cherish it
because i really really appreciate he
made time
for me to wrote this and put it in the
envelope
and wrote my name it's very pretty
i was very creative with the names but
anyways guys thank you so much for
watching we hope you enjoyed
me super cringed out it was fun it
reminded
me of the memories that we had
previously and it's fun it's always good
if you have received any interesting
love letters from your exes or from your
current boyfriend or girlfriend please
let us know we want to know if it's like
extravagant or
maybe somebody wrote something in the
sky with an airplane i don't know
or maybe some like a little background
like you can share with us
