You will always notice that when we finish eating, Sophia and Hannah are shouting,
What's the dessert?
So now, what I'm going to try for them is I'm going to make a Filipino dessert.
Our fruit salad.
That we always prepare for birthdays.
Or I always eat this on New Year's Eve.
My mom always makes this on New Year's Eve.
Fruit salad.
So I never saw Czech people making fruit salad.
So now, Hannah and Sophia will taste the fruit salad.
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to mix the fruit cocktail.
The fruit in can.
And the fruit that is fresh.
The fruit that is still fresh in the market.
So I will show you how I will do it.
And let's see if Hannah and Sophia will like it.
Let's see if they like it.
Let's see if they like it.
So Sophia and Hannah are just going to eat this.
But this is a bit spicy.
I don't know if Sophia will like it.
Anyway, Sophia is having lunch.
If she can't eat it, it's okay.
I will just make a new food.
So now I will prepare the fruit salad after this.
I need to sterilize it first.
I need to wash my hands.
So no rice.
Just a bit of chicken.
Wow, what is inside?
I put...
Lemon inside.
I put lemon inside.
What did you get this recipe?
I got a new recipe.
But it's a bit spicy.
So Sophia just arrived from school.
Why did you make it so spicy?
It's not really spicy.
I'm just putting it on my truck.
Just give Sophia this...
I feel like I've tried this already.
Did you wash your hands, Pinky?
Yes, I did.
It's spray fresh.
Can I squeeze lemon on it?
Yes.
Squeeze lemon.
But you don't know if you're going to like it.
Please, Pinky.
Sour.
I'm going to eat it.
I'm more excited if they serve the fruit salad.
Sour.
Let's see.
Thank you, darling.
So sour.
It's so sour because I put lemon on it.
Spicy.
No, it isn't.
Sour.
Thank you.
It's really delicious.
Sour.
Sour?
Sour.
Sourness.
Sourness.
Hanna doesn't want me to eat what she sees.
Do you know what is that?
Always eat what you don't like.
See?
Chicken breast.
She doesn't want to watch.
Sour.
No, it's all yours.
Good, huh?
Very yummy.
If you get the correct marinade, chicken is good.
So where did you learn this marinade, this sauce?
Secret?
Invention.
Secret?
No, I put all the herbs to be honest.
Did you put it in the cupboard?
Every egg one has herbs in it.
Just mix it quickly.
Big bite of chicken breast.
Good.
I feel the spiciness now.
Is it good?
Is it good?
No?
I'm going to wash my hands because I don't want anymore sour.
What's this dessert?
I don't know.
I'm not going to eat it.
It's a dessert.
It's a dessert.
Dessert.
Okay, I have dessert for them.
No way.
You have a dessert for us?
Yeah.
This time?
Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah.
So, I'm going to take this.
I will give you the dessert.
The dessert of the Philippines.
Filipino dessert.
Filipino dessert.
I think it's something that looks like munchkins.
This one?
Yeah.
I think it's something that looks like munchkins, but I don't think so.
You have to use this.
Dessert.
Dessert.
Is it ice cream?
I hope so.
I hope it's Filipino ice cream.
I hope so.
This is my Filipino ice cream.
I'll try.
I'll try.
I'll try.
I did it.
Filipino ice cream.
Dessert.
Wow.
Oh my goodness.
Dessert.
Oh, dear.
Filipino ice cream.
Oh.
It's not ice cream.
It's fruit salad.
Fruit salad.

Please, will you get the fruit salad?
You gotta try first.
What's that?
Huh?
What's that?
Fruit salad.
Look.
The fresh fruits.
This is fresh fruit.
From Philippines?
From Manchester Republic.
From the Manchester store.
Try.
If you like it.
Try.
What's that?
Huh?
That is the magic fruit from the Philippines.
What's this one?
Huh?
Cheese.
Cheese.
Yeah.
We used to have this at school.
Cheese.
Cheese.
Yeah.
We used to have this food at school the time.
You have cheese in the fruit salad?
Yeah, I'm just trying.
Yeah.
Sweet.
Sweet.
You didn't like it?
What's this one?
No.
Huh?
It's a wheat with the cheese or what?
No.
It's okay.
It's okay?
This is my fruit salad.
Our fruit salad in Philippines.
Usually in a night.
Mm-hmm.
Every New Year.
She made this.
Mm-hmm.
And yeah, that's every New Year.
What did you find out to put the cheese with the fruit?
The sweet.
You have to put cheese in the fruits.
That's how they make it.
Right?
Yeah, it's really weird.
Really?
No, I'm just trying to.
Trying to?
You've never tasted this before?
It's not bad, yeah.
It's really weird the taste.
Yeah?
Yeah.
If you're not used to the food.
How about your finger?
Do you like it?
Yeah, I do.
I just feel weird with the cheese.
I like it, but I just feel weird when it has cheese in it.
This is the exact same cheese that we have at school.
And the fruit, this fruit that I used to have that at school.
Mm-hmm.
What is it?
I used to love this at school.
Yeah?
Now, what can you say?
Delicious.
Delicious?
Yeah, but what fruit was that?
Just tell me we used to have it at school as a...
Fruit cocktail!
Cake!
Just tell me please.
I don't know the fruit that's been going.
Is it milkshake?
No.
I don't know, I've been going.
I don't know what kind of fruit because that is in the canned fruit.
This is a fruit cocktail.
This is a fruit cocktail, and it's mixed with fresh fruit.
And cheese.
And with the cream.
Cream, conditioner, and mango puree.
Mango, I made mango puree.
We don't have strawberries and raspberries in the Philippines.
You put mango, you put coconut.
Mm-hmm.
I used to have fruit.
Pineapple?
Pineapple, yeah.
Cajun, or coconut.
I like it, but I just filter it with the cheese.
And why did you put the cheese?
We always put cheese, yeah?
No!
It'll be better without cheese.
At least you know now the taste.
Oh, you have tasted already how we made in...
My nana made the fruit salad.
This is how we made fruit salad.
I like the fruit salad, but I didn't...
So maybe it's new to you because you just tried it.
Can I just have some more fruit?
I guess with...
No, without cheese.
Okay, just leave the cheese, big guy, leave the cheese.
Just fruit, okay?
Leave the cheese.
It's very, very sweet.
Very, very sweet.
I would also prefer without cheese.
Without cheese?
Probably, yeah.
Or maybe less.
You put quite a lot.
But it's really nice, the fruit.
Maybe if we gonna blend it...
Because I remember...
Now I remember there was an American there in our village.
He tried this one.
First he didn't like it.
No?
But...
We keep on giving him.
Then he started liking it.
It's not really the food, it's like...
Because your taste...
You will not get used to the taste of the food.
But when you get used to the taste of the food...
When you realize you like it, it's delicious.
But you don't have a cheese in Philippines.
They're gonna be upset with you.
When I asked for cheese, you said that you don't have it.
We have cheese in Philippines.
So much cheese in Philippines.
But when I ask you for something more, we don't have this one.
Maybe you ask me different kind of cheese.
Maybe you ask me Italian cheese.
What about the creamy cheese?
Do you have a creamy cheese?
Like Philadelphia?
Yeah.
Really?
So when I asked Ronald to make a cake and I asked for Philadelphia...
You said that you don't have it.
Because you asked instant.
We live in the village.
We live far away from the town.
So if you ask me, I don't have it.
I don't have it.
We live in the village.
We live far away from the town.
So if you need this kind of thing, you have to go to the town.
But you didn't want to take me.
I live in the town.
I live in the village.
You went to the town?
Two hours travel.
The village where I grew up, two hours travel to the town.
Motorbike maybe one hour.
Yeah, that's what you always say.
I'm going to the village.
No, no, no, I'm going by motorbike.
One hour only.
You like it with cheese?
I like it.
That's why I put cheese.
I presume that you would like it because I like it.
But I saw...
Pasta.
Do you put pasta also?
That's macaroni salad.
Macaroni salad?
You want me to do make it?
I'm going to make macaroni salad.
I should not eat it anymore.
Maybe...
I will need the toilet soon.
But the fruit is delicious.
Now what we offered you then
was macaroni salad.
Was it sweet?
Of course.
When I eat this now,
it flashes back to
my younger years in the village.
Do you remember?
I only eat this if I'm not mistaken
during New Year's Eve.
New Year's Eve,
my mother always made this one.
With corn.
With coconut.
Boko.
I put Boko.
Coconut.
But since we don't have coconut here,
I put strawberry.
I put raspberry.
I put mango.
I made mango puree.
Mix it.
Mix it.
It's really nice.
Cheese macaroni.
Chicken wing, chicken wing,
hot dog and bologna,
cheese and macaroni.
It's time for...
Sophia, it's time for...
Piano lessons.
Thank you for cooking.
Thank you for the
dessert. Thank you.
It was really yummy.
Who's gonna eat all this one?
Me!
Put this in the fridge again.
So you don't spoil.
Put this in the fridge.
Fruit?
Take a spoon
and eat just like this.
Like this, huh?
That's mango.
Okay, that's all for today.
So...
That's my cheese fruit salad.
This is our style.
It's our provincial style
fruit salad.
So next time I will make without
cheese.
What?
Bye!
Bye!
