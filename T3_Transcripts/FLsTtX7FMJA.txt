 Filipino listen, Mike sharing challenge. 400K likes since 24 hours. Now let's hop into this video. So is this like a karaoke thing? Oh, and he's singing in English, okay, okay. Oh, my god, they have a whole single foul line for this. You tell me that all these people can sing. All these Filipinos can sing. Falsing this line. I would have them cracking up if I had to go next. Let me tell you. If you live from singing in a deep voice. So a high pitch voice. That's what depends on. What are you killing it so far? What the fuck? With ease. Oh, my god. Ain't no way they all can freaking sing this good. And this is my song. This is the song you listen to when you deepen your feelings. Same like I told you. I told you. I told you. I'm the largest bass player. So like that. I don't know what I'm talking about. I know he can't sing. Let me hear him. Let me hear him. I died so long on the go. What? Oh, he's stretching for his neck for his time. Hold up. Hold up. He wasn't stretching for no reason. This man was behind the other guy. He was like this. And then he just killed us with his voice. This man sound like a freaking woman with his vocals. Kind of like Stell from SB19. I still can't believe I still can't believe Stell can even sound like that. I still can't believe it. So this day, I still can't believe it. Oh, I can't. I can't with y'all, man. I just can't. I can't. There's like. There's no competition when you bring in the Filipinos doing this karaoke stuff. There's no competition. They don't have any because this right here is. You don't know what to say. This whole single file line can sing their heart out to this song. And this song is not easy to sing. Let me tell you that. This song is not easy to sing, but they make it so easy. Make it look so easy. Sounds so easy. I like how they're having so much fun. That was good. That was good. That was good. Next song, next song, next song. Oh my goodness. I'll sit ahead and next song in this video. I feel like this video was way too freaking short. But 400K likes in 24 hours. I'm really not surprised. I'm surprised it's not on board because y'all freaking did phenomenal on this song. That song is really hard to sing. I can't remember who sings it, but that song is very hard to freaking sing. And they just all killed it together as a group. I don't know what I'll say. I mean, I guess the only thing I'll still say is more Filipino reactions are on the way. First single of Sh transparence Yang coffin It's fascinating. It went really more. Yeah. There's no ordinary story of what you're talking about, you know. Let's全部 go on. It's like piglets and Garib maybe. Okay, I like that sound.
