we're at the main terminal here in Manila now 
and the sun is shining unfortunately we left  
Cavinti yesterday and it was pouring with 
rain well actually it stopped kind of right  
as we were checking out and then it started 
again hopefully when we get to Boracay which  
is the place we're going to today we'll 
get some more Sunshine maybe shine good vibes  
hopefully we've seen a lot 
of rain lots of rain we have
here
9.50 yeah he has all the information
one each do we have seats together hey [Music]
which way this way you excited yes shall we head 
into a lounge yes please I would like a coffee and  
some pastries if they have some yeah [Music] hi 
mom you can check inside first because it's only  
available we were about to go sit in the lounge 
there but turns out it was tiny tiny and she was  
like you could sit here there's like a chair 
right by the door I think it was just really  
full they must just have a lot of people traveling 
through right now so I think we should find maybe  
a cafe or something or somewhere to get something 
I mean we get those Lounge accesses for free with  
our credit card but I still don't want to just sit 
just in the middle of the door uh salted caramel  
ice can I please have first of the caramel hot 
so one hot one ice oh yeah and the red velvet
thank you and this airport is so busy we thought 
oh we'll just grab our coffees and sit down on  
one of the other chairs somewhere people sitting 
on the floor and there's people sitting on the  
stairs finally found a quiet part of the airport 
if we just carry on walking to like the end Gates  
there's literally nobody here over the last week 
so we've been exploring Manila we started off in  
Metro Manila and we ate loads of delicious 
foods we definitely got some sunshine and we  
saw the most epic light shows then we also took a 
little road trip down to the outskirts of Manila  
where we went to tagaytay and then we went to the 
glamping capital of the Philippines even though  
I was pouring with rain the whole time so now 
we need some peace and quiet some sunshine so  
we're heading to Boracay driving around Manila is 
something I never want to do again it's fine you  
know we didn't crash or anything no bumps at 
all but there's a lot of traffic pretty much  
all day long loads of people warned us and they 
were like oh yeah you're in Manila the traffic  
and we were like it's not going to be that bad 
it was pretty bad but we had like music we were  
vibing in our car it was still super fun but 
I'm glad I wasn't driving but we have enjoyed  
Manila it's been really busy which is what we 
kind of like in a city yeah but time now to get  
some sunshine and some more calm life yeah and see 
some Blue Waters oh yeah I'm really excited to see  
the Blue Waters out of the airplane we haven't 
seen any of that yet we've literally just seen  
this Metro side of Philippines yeah and when we 
flew in to Manila when we arrived it was in the  
middle of the night we didn't see anything no 
so yeah I'm excited everyone that we've spoken  
to any staff anywhere and everyone we've come 
across has been like oh you have to go to Boracay  
we're like yeah that's where we're going next 
and they're just so excited they're like oh  
you will love it and now I'm really excited even 
now when we were waiting to get into the airport  
the lady was like oh where are you going and 
we were like oh Boracay and she was like oh  
I'm super excited oh no I 
think that's the only icing
it's a good way to start the day I've got 
loads of coins they keep just building up  
in this country so I'm gonna go to the shop 
one of these shops and see what I can find  
he says in this country but everywhere we go 
that they have coins we have like sacks full  
of coins towards the end and then we have 
to spend them all at the airport and it's  
super embarrassing I got some Sesame something 
Brittle and some peanuts brittle oh nice yea
wait is that what we have then 60 pesos no we 
had a little bit more but the lady was like um
[Music]
this airport is way warmer than the airports 
we were in in Phnom Penh Cambodia but I had  
to put a coat on it was so cold you hopefully 
won't need any sleeve tops where we're going no  
sunshine all around it better I hope so better 
be it better be [Applause] does anyone else get  
that feeling when you're sat to the gate and 
it's meant to be open but it hasn't opened  
and you're sat there thinking have I missed 
this flight or you know is everyone else in  
the same boat so we're flying with AirAsia 
and they changed the terminal last minute  
from terminal four to three so there's no signs 
or anything for AirAsia we have to kind of find  
the only there's only one notice board that AirAsia 
flights on it but there's no AirAsia staff all of  
the staff seem to be wearing yellow at AirAsia 
is red isn't it yeah we're in the right place  
at the right time all right everyone's 
standing up so I think it's time to go
well we've just seen our bags on the plane so 
that's good yeah that's always a good start so  
we know that they'll make it to the same place 
that we're going to yeah see you in boracay
sun is shining
the views from the plane were so nice you could 
see the blue water and the sand and loads of palm  
trees oh my god I've missed it we haven't had it 
for a while now no we haven't this is like serious  
holiday Vibes I am so excited to be here I'm so 
used to having a baggage claim belt but I think  
here they just come and lay them out in front of 
you on like a little deck it's a small airport  
what did you say these words Sesame I asked them 
what it's inside and she also said Sesame so it's  
squishy something in the middle but it's like 
chewy Sweet it's really tasty oh there are bags
it's so much heavier
nice so the island we're going to is Boracay 
and this airport is not actually in Boracay  
so we have to somehow find the way 
over to the island I think it's very  
close though very close I'm assuming 
there'll be people here selling boat  
tickets uh yeah I was just gonna say that 
I hope there's someone here oh maybe yeah
to maybe get rid of more of these coins now
thank you we just took a transfer taxi and boat 
and the taxi to a hotel and the way back for 3  
400 pesos I think that's a pretty good deal he 
says it's about an hour so per person 25 pounds  
I think my maths is correct yeah are we 
the only people in this map I think we are  
the only ones here I just saw him counting
the seats only but there's more
there's definitely not more people coming if 
you close the door it's always like scary to  
buy things straight as you land in the airport 
we should have done some research to be honest  
I haven't had time yet I feel like that's 
a good deal and on the way back she gave  
us like discounts because we worked for the same 
company I think out of Simplicity it's just nice  
being able to jump into one van and just know that 
they'll bring you right to your hotel they'll tell  
you where to go which boat to get on and all that 
kind of stuff Peace of Mind peace of mind [Music]
you actually have to have a booking etc etc 
this is very exciting thank you
whoa
ah thank you oh wow made it I you this was 
like the simplest most straightforward trip  
ever I think as soon as we paid for the transport 
these guys and galss in blue t-shirts have been  
escorting us like quite literally almost holding 
our hands to get to our hotel yeah so nice and it  
looks very busy this island yeah boat was packed 
there's loads of other boats going as well yeah  
I'm excited oh my God look at the water in the bus 
I was like I got confused for a second I thought  
I was in a different country because coming from 
Manila yeah very built up City you go on a flight  
you think did we just go to a new country but no 
it's just the islands this is this is kind of the  
Philippines that we've been seeing you know like 
growing up yeah it's like the blue Blue Waters and  
the Beautiful palm trees I think it's time for 
some Island some smaller Island life  
we just arrived at our hotel we didn't realize 
how big this place was it's called Fairways and  
Blue Water Resort it's a hotel with a golf 
course in the middle we like arrived in the  
hotel and we still were driving for about 
10 minutes until we reached this reception  
just gonna go check in now all right let's 
get our paperwork and then we can check in
okay there's loads of desks that was not the 
check-in desk that was just another desk now  
we're heading to the check-in yes hello 
thank you how are you yes please [Music]
thank you what about um golf
we stay here yeah you can sit for a while 
okay thank you thank you our room's been  
upgraded yeah someone came from my premium to 
Premium Plus or something I just heard upgrade  
and I got super excited this hotel is massive 
huge there's four swimming pools there's like  
five restaurants and you're saying that to get 
from one place to the other you need a golf cart  
we'll have to show you this place properly 
in another video but we'll show you where  
we're staying in our room when we get to our 
room we'll give you a sneak peek of the hotel  
yeah but then we'll have to get a little bit 
settled then we'll show you around probably
look at that that looks really nice [Music]  
so this hotel is definitely out of our normal 
budgets our first time having like an actual  
holiday the first few days we will be doing 
some filming and stuff but after that I think  
we'll have like almost a whole week to do nothing 
but this place looks awesome there's like pools  
everywhere yeah there's like golf course in the 
middle there's a Vibe here there's loads of people  
here it's a serious Resort there's a spa but what 
comes with a place out of a budget is also more  
expensive food so we're thinking of just like 
sharing a pizza or something for now while we  
wait for our room to be ready but it just feels 
so different to Manila you know it's like miles apart  
yeah I'm so excited I'm very excited for 
me I think they're just putting our luggage in  
our room and getting it sorted so we can just eat 
our pizza and then everyone's ready yeah holidays
oh yeah Coca-Cola tastes like holiday like from 
when I was a kid whenever you went on holidays  
like you're allowed one Coke a day oh yeah but now 
I'm an adult I can have as many as I want now this  
is when the holiday starts you got a mango shake 
I can hear the water I can hear the pool holiday  
vibes holiday food starts now let's be honest 
we travel a lot we go to nice places but we  
never really go to a resort no I can't remember 
the last time we had a pizza either no cheers  
happy holidays it tastes like 
a holiday cheers it's fresh
room's ready somebody with our bags already 
show you how that no worries okay your room  
will be in the next sixth floor oh where 
are you from sir I'm from the UK Sweden you  
um from here sorry we've brought our whole lives 
with us I like it yeah whoa we have two beds?
here oh this is so nice is that oh my God there's 
a view of the golf course you're facing our front  
nine wow wow that's amazing definitely having 
a coffee here watching some people play golf oh  
wow this is so nice
oh my goodness okay okay wait 
why is it so big it's so spacious  
look at this look at this look 
at me you don't need a gym
I got very very excited to our upgraded 
rooms Fairway and Blue Water Resorts in  
Boracay first thing you see when you come into 
our spacious room is our bathroom with a very  
large vanity mirror shower toilet everything 
looks and smells very nice then we have not  
one but two double beds yeah in case we have an 
argument in case we want to push them together  
and just sleep across the other way mini fridge 
oh stocked oh nice that's the first kettle so we  
can make our nice little budget instant coffees 
massive TV space for DylDyl to do some work but  
but this oh this here officially this is the golf 
course but this is like the piece the resistance  
of this view the grounds of this Resort is so so 
so so so so big there's like you could have a pool  
view you could have a view to the other direction 
but we have a view of the most glorious huge green  
grounds a little Lake Golf Course Palm Trees 
surrounding it blue skies I have looked at the  
prices of the golf it is quite reasonable actually 
they do also offer the shoes clubs and the golf  
carts as well nine holes or 18 holes and I think 
with the golf course being right here I think  
it'll be hard to say no to I'm not a golf 
player but but Dylan is I can't keep him from this  
this is definitely his time to shine you can be my 
caddy no that's the other thing comes with a candy  
so someone will come with us and show us around 
and tell us where to hit the ball we'll show you  
more of this place and Boracay in the next video 
but for now I think we're just gonna probably sit  
here a nicer coffee right right here yeah yeah and 
just oh I'm so glad it's not raining, yes!  happy holidays bye
