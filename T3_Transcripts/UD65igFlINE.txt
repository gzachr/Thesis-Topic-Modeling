family in the philippines is everything
yeah
it means everything
more than the filipino or filipino
themselves family is everything okay uh
you know i'm talking about the
legitimate filipinos in filipino family
is the foundation of their world
okay it is the foundation of their life
family in their minds and this may not
be right
but it comes before a family comes
before god
you talk about you in a lot of the minds
and
look at the pills
because that's how strong family is so
in the last
live stream if you recall ladies and
gentlemen i talk to you about
uh knowing the players when you have
problems in the family and i talked
about this right here and we talked
about
how to how to how to help understand and
solve problems in the family with
filipino family and uh we covered a lot
of ground as far as as far as naming the
what players talk to you about the
trader we talked about the inflators
haters the raiders all that man and i
identified those
players to you because when you get
involved with a family in the filipino
family
guess what
right
they gonna take it out
all
you as american or you're a foreigner
you know and the farmer both have all
the answers and the foreigners supposed
to know better and honest or to do
better and then there aren't supposed to
be better okay so you better get ready
get ready get ready
yeah for the big payback because they
finna pay you back all the time they was
talked about all the time they were
taking advantage of all the time that
they they would look down on they're
going to take it out on you because you
now you and the family you need to get
your piece of the pie a piece of the
hate pack
and they want to give you the haters you
know you got to get you got to drink
your [ __ ] you hate already right
well look
i'll tell you something man
whenever you're involved in a family
relationship with a filipino
you need to understand some things okay
and you and when you deal with them you
better know them you better know you
better have a strategy so today we're
going to talk about family strategy
dealing with your filipino family a lot
of y'all
will eventually come to the philippines
after the pandemic is over
and you get involved with your filipina
and you'll be lovey-dovey for them for a
little while okay you said [ __ ] you what
you mean for a little while we gonna do
this for a lifetime okay
that remains to be seen doesn't it huh
there's nothing you can't guarantee
nothing in this world but you all find
taxes in that right okay so you will be
involved with your filipina for a while
and and next thing you know
the issue and the topic of family gonna
come up
you don't go with my family we haven't
cooked out anything
it's all that all that stuff so what
happens is also more often than not
the american or foreign or whatever you
want to call them to get involved with
the family they don't know how to deal
with them they don't know what uh
the cultural aspect of the filipina they
say things that the filipino family
takes wrong
and it's a mess it's a night freaking
mirror okay you ever heard a nightmare
on elm street that's what it is it's a
night freaking mirror
nightmare man and so what happens what
what happens is after the philippine
american
after the marines involved in a filipino
family then filipinos begin to put up
with walls
barriers
because they don't like the kind of but
they got to deal with you know why
because they're so still married
so when they get around the condo or an
american or farmer they showed up like a
drunk
they don't say nothing they just look at
them crazy
so some you gonna find all of that all
of that and more i'm telling you man
i've been through i've been i've been
with
lisa d for a long time
i've been dealing with her family
uh ever since i met her
i they have they made me they go they're
gonna make it part where you want to
beat or not okay but just keep this in
mind you will never be a filipino i
don't care what
you gotta act like i'm talking like a
walker i can eat like a sleep like i'm
on the floor like i'm you know you'll
never be a filipino because you don't
have the blood okay so they won't talk
about strategy how you deal with these
people man
filipinos are so
it's like jekyll and high
you know
sometimes
they can be the sweetest
nicest most generous
kindest person
on the planet earth i'm serious
that's why that's what draws a lot of
people to them
than the nice side of them
but when you flip that card they don't
see the bad side okay and they try to
fill the field try to hide that part but
the bad side of the way works
way worse than you have ever seen man
when you when you get on the philippines
bad side filipino bad side they're
coming after you okay
it may be with their mouth
verbal attacks it may be with their
fists come on man let's go
it may be with a two by four when you
ain't looking
but they're gonna find a way make a way
shake away take away breakaway to get
you back let me check and that right
yeah that's how they do man
two sides jekyll high jekyll high
okay and it depends on what side you get
what kind of treatment you're going to
get
so i'm getting strategy man we real
quick we're not going to be long real
quick fourth thing fourth thing fourth
thing coming up for today
let's go
playing today man we're gonna run this
quick we run this quick we run this
quick this day and i gotta go someplace
but we're gonna take you out with us
when we go i'm gonna do live streams
when we get there all right
i'm loving that man spam filipino family
strategy yeah you gotta have a strategy
man
if you have no strategy you asking for
tragedy you hear me
when you're dealing with anything in any
endeavor in your life i don't care if
it's family relationships i don't care
if it's business i don't care if it's
christian your church or church or
social relations i don't care you better
have a strategy even if we're dealing
with your son or your daughter your
mother your wife your girlfriend your
filipina
strategy man when i dealt with lisa d
first time i met i had a strategy
i was checking her out
i had a list of things
you know i had it written down but i had
it in my mind things i had questions and
things i need to check with see how she
see how she says about with this about
that but that you know
i was testing out that strategy
and my strategy revealed to me that i
had the right one way back
so when you have a strategy man you can
get things accomplished huh it's a god
map guideline it's a map like a road map
and it helps you avoid what the bumps
along the way
i don't know about you i don't like the
bump in the road
i'm turning around what's the man what
you're doing
let's go here but we got four things for
you man uh i got i gotta uh
i gotta what was focus sheet it's all on
one sheet i ain't got a lot of i don't
know i don't know how like four or five
and i'm gonna start doing that more
because it's more simple and it's more
efficient for me to do it that way so
okay so let's go focus sheet folks you
will not have this pocket yet i guess
falcon first right before i get there um
i'm gonna do a recorded video
hopefully tonight before after you get
back
and it's got some good news uh an octa
research group in the philippines and uh
has just
advised
that the delta surge will definitely
be over by december okay so what does
that mean for you and me
i don't know
could it be
should it be would it be that they may
open it up
i don't know
but they this this is the research group
that does all the research on kobe 19
and they give the trends all like that
they know what they're talking about
okay they're saying it's gonna be over
by the surge for delta
it's gonna be over by uh december so i i
i i'm hoping and i'm praying that they
begin to open up some stuff but i'm
gonna do a recorded on that and let
y'all see what's going on with that but
uh
things things are changing here guys i i
can tell you for a fact i see things
changing here every day okay and since
they went to this uh
different type of lockdown they got to
call the granular lockdown
uh it's changing more rapidly quicker
quickly they haven't opened it up to
tourist yet but eventually they will
okay and so you guys out there ladies
and gentlemen of the jury
get yourself red day right there okay
because it could be like a blink of an
eye you see
we going to accept turret now
the floodgate everybody but right now
they got a cap on you can only have 1500
people coming into the country at one
time okay but when they when they
eventually when they another thing
another clue is this
the bi which is the bureau of
immigration for the philippines they are
hiring big time if you go to the bureau
of immigration uh website or facebook
page you see a big notice we are now
hiring okay that means they're hiring
for what for you
they got to get ready for the surge and
that means that they're preparing people
to handle a huge crowd a huge intake
that means that within the near future
they're going to open this thing up okay
that's just that's my don't say well
bobby they said they're going to open up
on january but don't say that don't
don't tell the lie okay i said in my
opinion okay everybody's entitled to the
opinion right
huh
yeah
i can do what i want to do
filipino family strategy yeah man
if you don't have a strategy you in life
and anything you do
you will be
in a big big tragedy your life will be a
tragedy because you didn't plan nothing
and when you don't plan nothing
you plan to fail you don't plan you're
planning on failing
i've always had i've always been a big
planner
and sometimes my plans have never went
correct but i had an idea what i was
getting into okay it may not have been
worked out fine for me but i felt better
because at least i planned right i just
didn't jump into with no clue what was
going on
so plan
well and a lot of people don't like the
plan i don't know why
to me that's just common nature it's
just
natural for me to plan a lot of people
you know i live i literally like take it
as i see how you have let's see what
happens you know what say that right
orange man let's see what
[Laughter]
flying eliza got an appointment and she
don't want me to make victory late for
her day she got a date she got a date
but not with no man y'all gonna get that
at your mind okay not what
that she got to be somebody let's go
ah since this [ __ ] man focus for the day
you know
you got a big family over there on the
right see those people right there all
of those are filipino family and for
those of you that live in the
philippines you know who that guy and
lady is right there in the middle you
know who they are right
that's
that's uh uh cargo you remember cardo
from provogno
that's cardo and his wife
julia montes
and uh they are big stars here in the
philippines i watched this show
regularly lisa d and i are fanatics
there's a show guy uh for those of you
that don't know don't live here there's
a show called provisional remember that
and the star of the show is cardo
teleside that's his tv name
his real name is coco martine coco
martine
but that's his real wife right there on
with him with his hand around her
shoulder
and that's the people did you see in the
background
let me talk for a minute please i don't
know what i don't know
i don't know what it is
she always got to feel she got to
correct me but i'm gonna tell you
something i'm gonna tell you
his name is coco martin ladies and
gentlemen
that's what they called him
she tried to give me his real real name
but the screen name his tv name is carl
carlo but his real name is coco martin
and she said well that's what they call
him on that that's his actor name
whatever i didn't know that coco martin
and his
tv name is uh
[Music]
all right but yeah uh so that those
that's his fit tv family in the back and
those are all familiar faces to me and
lisa d because we watch this show five
nights a week
they come on and they have the best
stories and the best it's action full of
action if you're an action show kind of
guy like me you will love this show but
when you come out here tell your ladies
look here what time what time uh
provisional cardio come on i got to see
that so bobby dude
bobby you said it's a good show yeah but
they speak serano but you can pick up on
the story lines because you could just
watch they have more action than talking
okay that's why i like it i like action
shows okay all right that's enough of it
so uh the big family they have a lot of
things going on in that family and
that's that's where every filipino
family is always feel one thing you
gotta understand one thing gotcha
whenever you're dealing with a filipino
family expect
the unexpectable
of that word i don't know is that a word
expect the unexpected okay because it's
gonna happen
yeah things you least wouldn't ever
never expect it's gonna happen you know
why because filipino families
yeah filipino families are full of
yeah drama y'all saw you man
every kind of storyline you can think of
is in a filipino family
you may never see it but guess what it's
in the background not in the foreground
things are going on behind the scenes
that you know not of and some of the
time you don't want to know that up i
remember one time i went up we went up
to lisa d
uh
we went up to the hot tub family house
in medellin
and and i got there
we got here everything's fine and then
all of a sudden a little girl came out
one of my nieces or nieces and she had
her arm like
i said what's wrong with you she said
i i feel as good but she fell feels cool
i said let me see your arm
the arm was broke y'all
yeah like she couldn't hardly i had to
at the whole armor again when i found
out
it was that way for two weeks
i said what it was you've been like this
for two weeks the mother didn't take the
time to shake the time break the time to
take the girl to the hospital
she couldn't even use the arm
that's the kind of stuff i'm talking and
i ran into that
and then when i got involved i should
listen here
you need to take this girl to the
hospital immediately so her arm is
broken
her off she can't use the arm
and i was upset and that that's that's
what that's where i went wrong right
there
i wasn't yelling
but i was like you need to take this
girl now because i don't like you to be
messed up
so long story short
they took the girl and she had to have
surgery on the arm the doctor told him
you waited too long man
you should have brought this girl as
soon as her arm was broken they have
free they have free medical care that
was not the issue they got free medical
care because they know no poverty family
and they didn't take the girl so i got
involved with it man
and that's why to this day they don't
want me to come up there right now
i went i didn't go off crazy with them
but i i gave it a ride there i said
don't you ever let me come up here and
see you have a child with some problem
in your arm like that you need to take
care of your family that's your daughter
and when i got through with her she was
peeled with me
you know and i didn't care
because you never uh a neglected child's
care like that the little girl to this
day to this day they put a steel rod in
her arm she cannot lift the arm above
her shoulder she cannot extend the arm
all the way
that's due to neglect that kind of stuff
you find in the filipino family all the
time so when if you like me and you
don't hate you don't like you're gonna
be abusing you're gonna say something
and that but when i said it i should
have had a strategy and how to approach
it i didn't okay and you know what when
i reflect on it i don't care the child's
life her her well-being was at stake
okay so
the things i'm telling you now i broke
the rule on that one because that was to
me was a very very uh critical issue
that needed to be resolved immediately
and i didn't know no other way okay but
i'm sure you the right way to deal with
these people because right now since i
did that man
i got a bad name up just
they don't like me the guy do you think
i care i don't really care but i'm going
to get that result because it's
important that you always try to
maintain a family relationship so this
year is my year to go up there and get
it resolved complete okay but that's
what that's what i'm trying to tell you
there's always going to be some uh
background thing that you know not of
okay that's how filipinos are they keep
a lot of stuff
to themselves it's like even though
you're a part of the family right
you'll never know stuff they don't want
you to know okay even sometimes you're
filipina she would she won't tell you
everything she'll tell you part
but some of the stuff you will find out
on you and you you you'll be just like
all right
so yeah whenever you're dealing with
family man i always try to have a
strategy sometime in that particular
instance i blew it man
i blew it because i became so
emotionally involved with that situation
when you see somebody hurt like that
a little kid man
it gets to you you know what i'm saying
it got to me big time you know but i'm
gonna get a result let's go
all right so first thing i want to
always remain calm and that's what i
didn't do
okay remain calm when you're dealing
with family situation okay you're gonna
have filipinos that say stuff about you
behind your back
okay number one man call you got
philippine to talk about you uh family
members will talk about you and
filipinos in general are very very uh
gossipy nature i don't know what the
best term to say they like the gossip
okay they like to tell about this one
and this one and they like to know about
your business okay
so uh when you keep them and that's how
i did i'm like that's not your business
man
they don't like that did they huh
you know that's what they're gonna do
and he said i'm sorry
they get offended you know but i know
now i said well i work at a very nice
place just tell them that you don't have
to tell them
but tell them something that will
satisfy them that's what you do
yeah but remain calm remain calm
whatever situation you come in because a
lot of times they'll tell you there's a
lot of back back behind the scene things
that you don't know what's going on
their family and they won't say no
because they want they want to put
give you a good impression about them
and they don't want you to feel bad
about the one of the things that they
always feel bad about when they're
introduced to
american or foreigner is the fact that
they you're more up here you're elevated
and they feel like they're down there
okay so when you get into the family uh
uh they're gonna like honor you honey on
you and
so you won't want to
over uh you don't want to talk to them
in a delivering fashion or condescending
manner you want to be honest and over
with them and treat them with respect
that's the number one thing you do when
you remain calm you treat them with
respect no matter what the situation is
remain calm because when you go off it's
gonna make it's gonna make a problem
it's gonna cause a problem they already
have they're already apprehensive about
you being a part of the family and being
entering into their little circle
because the filipinos families are very
circular circular circular type
tightness type mesh
huh
the big what yeah
okay
okay i don't know where all that was
about but
i'm going off all right lucy we talk
about the video right when i get through
okay
oh she said she's the rat she'll be
telling stuff
okay now i get it
and then next thing you know they all
looking at you when you come in there
they're like
you don't know what they're doing there
for but she know and she ain't your
gonna say one word to you because she
don't tell them everything you do in the
bedroom all kind of stuff
so you got a lot of things going on when
you're dealing with family uh
relationship and so the best thing to do
man is be like i do i normally most of
the time sometimes i like i just
mentioned it since i blew it don't blow
it like i did i'm telling you right
remain calm okay whatever you do when
you're dealing with families and if they
present you with some kind of anger or
whatever always you men come don't cuss
them out cause they cuss you out don't
slap them cause they slap you don't uh
don't no don't don't don't don't tip
don't do no tiff attack with them people
okay don't do that because as soon as
you turn your back
you hit you and they'll hit you with a
42x4 across your head blunt force trauma
you ever heard of blunt force trauma
that's the weapon of this choice here
weapon of mass destruction for you
filipinos don't filipino will never
fight fear there's no such thing as a
fair fight with a filipino you make them
man they'll smile in your face and
you'll never know it soon you turn your
back get your fire
that's if they got if that's how man
they got it they'll take it out i mean
and this happens all the time that's
what i said philippines the nicest
people in the world but when you hit
flip that switch when you touch that
button
they go they explode like dynamite and
ain't nothing you can do to hold them so
you need to remain calm whatever the
situation is when you're dealing with
your relatives whether you feel uneasy
uh whatever the situation is remain calm
relax okay
because when you get upset they're gonna
get upset okay the man come no matter
what the situation is when you deal with
when you deal that's your first strategy
and then whenever you come into a
situation
recognize the player
i told you to play as the last time
remember
you know i told you to play the last
time not to go over that again because a
lot of players but remember the player
remember the family member remember the
person you're dealing with
and if you don't know who the players
are before you get there you need to
talk to your filipina look here tell me
something about your film
which one like to talk a lot which one
like to eat a lot which one like the bed
you know i think i'm saying that there's
there's always a beggar right it's
always a big eater
there's always the one that always want
to bang everybody okay
uh what else there's always one to
compliment you there's always one that
want to sleep with you okay you think
i'm playing with you
i told you drama right
drama there was a there was a story
years and years and years ago on tv
called peyton plays you remember peyton
plays there's always a paint and place
type drama when you deal with filipino
family i don't know why
that's why you know some people just
don't deal with it because it's so much
myth but i deal with it you know but
last last year i had i got to back off
but i'm getting back i'll get i'll get
that serious result but yeah you know
there's always drama man so you got to
be careful whatever and know about the
family know where you're getting into
know what you know who's who to be nice
to know who not to say much to i always
did that i always do that you know and i
still do that to this day because
sometimes when you be on your family a
lot of things change you know so lisa d
keeps me oppressed who's doing what and
who is saying what and what they do i
know all of them so when i go down and
i'll be planning on going down there and
these eat something
we're going down in december and we're
going to bring them a lot of food and
stuff so they're going to be nice for a
little while and then
and but anyway but yeah always know your
background of the family and family
members let's get it from the
philippines yeah and sometimes what i
used to do when i first moved here guys
i would remain calm i wouldn't say a
whole lot
and what i would do is we went to their
family and
i would just observe
i would just look you can find out a
whole lot about people whether you speak
the language or whether they speak your
language not by their what actions
they look how they walk how they treat
people how loud they talk how soft they
talk their facial expressions their
voice vocal tones you can tell a lot
about people
that's what i did i did that for the
first few times they said you don't talk
about it
because i was observing i told you i can
read people
i can feed people man when i meet you if
i ever meet you
the first thing i'm going to do is
what's up man and then because i would
normally shake your hand but in the
pandemic i ain't shaking
what's up man
when you when you be saying i'm alright
i'll be
and i can see some stuff in you but it
will shift your hand to tell even more
but yeah uh but yeah that's what do you
know
if i see something good i'm gonna tell
you something good if i see something
bad in you i ain't gonna say nothing one
word because i don't want
the bad in you to grow i'm gonna just
let that go and that right okay but i'm
gonna if there's something good i said
let me see it
but if something bad i'm gonna put that
on a little angle because i don't want
to hurt anybody here but anyway um
but yeah you gotta know you gotta know a
background of who you're dealing okay i
told you whenever you i failed a plan
you plan to fail so if you don't have a
plan when you're dealing with these
people but you deal with filipina family
you're going to be in some straight up
bull baby
because they gonna have their way with
you
someone gonna get a little dog baby you
know what i'm saying you know little dog
baby and then they get the penises
that you say
i got it don't say
and they don't have to be in the
problems being enough i'm telling you
man all kinds of stuff you better be
ready for he said well
uh i'm a christian and i don't believe
in that
yeah lord protect you but there's a
devil out there too
yo you know you never heard the devil
and his imps he got them all over here
and they do that
stuff okay so you better be ready man
i'm telling you man you know and before
i went up to their house you know
my people told me this
was gonna eat up i said what you need to
eat but they may have some in the food i
said something to food
then that was awesome but all my people
told me that when i went up there man
first thing they did they offered me
some food
that's
i'm i'm fine
oh i'll take some of that
and it gave me some more was it a salad
salad
a fruit salad they gave him a bowl of
fruit salad he died i made it
and i took the bowl fruit shallot and
when they know why i'm looking i said
hey
you're good man
i ate a little bit of it but i said i'm
[ __ ] yeah but yeah ah you have to be
on the lookout for everything anything
and everything
she said i thought it was a witch no i
didn't i thought i was going by the
rumors i heard and some of the rooms i
heard actually were true
filipinos when you go into progress you
better be ready for the hoodoo and
everything at least you know what i'm
talking about
she know they out there don't play that
game with me so you know
kinda you trying to add like they don't
do that
okay all right let's let's go
she trying to get me distracted uh so
yeah remain calm because you're gonna
you might be approached with anything
recognize the player know who you're
dealing with man
you don't know know who you're dealing
with some of the players let's go back
to some of the players
i talked to you about the players last
time
okay
haters somebody just hate on you
couldn't i don't know my
fears y'all heard she said she said she
know why that's why i let her eat first
okay yeah i didn't need to i didn't let
her eat first
i did let her eat first i don't know i
don't know how you remember that lisa
[Music]
yeah let me if i'm crazy let me be crazy
and let me be lazy
spells they're out here
looking [ __ ] you gonna play with you go
ahead and mess with somebody and see
let's see you ain't never heard nobody
had a spell on them
a lot of people have spilled on i was a
kid man i remember creating charleston
south carolina okay there's a lady
and i we used to walk past the lakeshore
going home going to school and come home
from school
her name was i thought man i think thank
you thank you i think any news
name is ann
and every time we went past miss annie
house
watch out watch out mrs
manny
i said what
she put she put them on you know the
mouth was right i don't know what the
mod was either but i knew it was bad
i know if she spoke something bad on me
it's going to be a spell on me and i
won't be messed up so every time we got
past miss annie's house guess what we
did feel
i think
you where's annie will put the model on
you and when she put them out on you
they'll be out on you and you'll be in a
spell she put a spell on you yeah tell
me man ain't playing all right i forgot
what i said all right but uh
you got to be careful man we talked
about the traders we talked about the
haters the raiders the gators huh
gators uh what the waiters the waiters
are nice people they always want to wait
on you they'll always ask you do you
want something to eat you want something
yeah they treat you nice i like the way
it is in the filipino family very very
accommodating very nice people there's a
translator there why don't they always
want to translate something you say it
what did he say oh he said that
and then there's
and then there's the dictator the
dictator's all i
can you give me five and all kind of the
debaters inflated traders all of them
man but the best one on all that is that
waiters they'll love to wait on you they
love to be accommodating to you and they
love to help you all right so those are
some of the players we talked about so
you got to be ready man recognize who
they are recognize who you're dealing
with and you can recognize who you got
the wheel with i'm saying you're dealing
with you're wheeling it okay and then be
careful number three real reaction huh
yeah be careful man whatever comes your
way when you're dealing with the family
members don't act the food up in here up
in here okay don't do that
because they're not like american
families the least little thing you say
to them could hurt their feelings okay
if i just told you they're like jekyll
and hyde
they're very very emotional very very
sensitive in a way
they are somewhat
have a somewhat childlike nature when
they are when they are hurt they revert
to a childlike state and in a childlike
mentality you know they just that's the
way that if you don't you don't believe
me if you're philip you're mad you're
you're engaged you're filipino you go
into the film you're dating the
philippines then you know she reversed
this child i stayed too when
she was in tampa
huh
when they're in town
same thing so whenever whenever
somebody's emotional you can't do a
whole lot with it the best thing to do
watch your mouth watch what you say
watch what you do and try to get the
heck out of there in a nice way until
you can come back and get get it result
okay last one last one we out we out we
you gotta react watch your reaction and
then last one reach out baby
yeah after all the craziness okay after
you've remained calm after you recognize
the player after you uh made sure that
your reaction is not crazy then you can
begin to do what reach out teach y'all
peace out okay what you mean about me
reach out what you mean by the reach out
yeah reach out man you gotta try to
resolve it
they think they cuss you out or whatever
they say something like whatever and
then he mad
and when filipinos get mad
they mad as h and they don't care who
knows about it okay so sometimes you
have to back up okay like i did
i had to back up with the last i told
you about the situation i had a
beginning program i had to back up
you know because that whole
the whole family was against me man and
y'all y'all think i'm playing with you
but i'm serious very very serious the
whole family was mad with me
a
surprise gift
cece i just had something delivered
y'all this he said
she said i bought us yeah i bought you a
surprise gift i don't know what it is i
forgot what i ordered anyway uh
the whole family was mad at me because i
did the right thing
that's what blew me away
i did what was right
and i told him what was right and
because of that i was persecuted
they told they talked about being like a
dog man
and i did the right thing
in my mind in my heart and i have i had
to do it over again i'd do it again but
i
i'll do it in a different way i remain
caught falling straight but uh
does this thing you know why they don't
like people
uh
uh telling them stuff that's right they
want to do it their way
whether be involves injuring their life
as a child or whatever they don't care
that's their way and you will find that
out when you deal with the filipino
family okay
i never do that part of the family until
like that incident happened and to this
day people mad at me up there you know
what i'm saying
at least these right here but you know
what
but you know i'll get a result but let
them know man you know i'm sorry for
telling y'all to take her to the
hospital and that she needed to get
surgery i'm sorry for that but you know
that's that i'm american and when i see
a child injured i have to react that's
from the top you know and if they deal
with that fight
but
they're angry because even though the
child needed help she needed surgery and
i brought her to the attention
they didn't like me telling them that
she i needed she needed to go to the
hospital this even the girl was just
sitting there they were looking at her
for two weeks and she walked around
the first time i saw some what you need
to go to get this here to the hospital
that's what i'm trying to tell you
there's gonna be some drama when you get
in the family so don't sit up there and
act like well you know i love your
daughter and i love y'all too
now you better if you know what i know
and i'm gonna take this strategy out for
one second don't worry about this
strategy here listen to me playing today
when you get in that family if you get
around that family keep your mouth shut
don't go around your mouth cause you
don't know who you talk you don't know
where the players are first of all and
you don't know who's gonna say what what
you said sometimes twist your word
keep your match up
don't be uh being don't be mean be
pleasant and be polite but don't give
them more information than they need to
know
okay just give them basic simple short
words and smile a lot that's the best
bet that way you can stay out of trouble
and even when you do that when you get
home your philippines gonna say
something that somebody said about you
behind your back that's just the way it
is okay
but
if you use the strategy i'm giving you
you help yourself in resolving issues
and trying to prevent issues from coming
up i'm gonna use this strategy to
resolve the issue i had i did the right
thing
god knows my heart and he knows my
actions were right and my intentions
were right
i came into a situation where i knew i
didn't know about which was they have
the backdrop going on at all times
one of the things in the filipino family
is
they don't like any outside person
what they what i would use the term i
would use meddling right or interfering
with their personal
uh you know especially on the mountain
you're dealing with the province they
have uh special codes you know i'll say
special um
they have special
laws or behaviors that if you violate
that you're in trouble not illegal stuff
right but uh morally in their con in a
little circle and that's what i ran into
i didn't know and and the circle was
that if you say something about their
children they don't they don't like you
you can't say nothing bad about you or
say anything to them about taking care
of they didn't like that at all to this
day
they hope they hold them and but i saved
the little girl's arm she that arm could
have gotten infected and it could have
messed her whole body up you're saying
she had to get surgery two days later
she was in the hospital getting served
and you think they you do you think
somebody said thank you
thank you for letting me thank you bring
me bring it to my you think they said
that no
not one word
to this day they hate my guts okay
that's what it is yeah
and i have to deal with that but i'm
gonna get that resolved when i get there
to december i'm gonna sit tomorrow down
i know this there's four players no
there's three players that that did the
dirt on me they talked to me at least he
told me everything
i know everything i know and that's to
this day man i have helped them people
continue we bring food up there i didn't
get because they talked about dirty
badging me you think i turned on didn't
don't want to help them do it i still
sent money released you help them pick
up like you know because you can't do
them wrong even though they did you
wrong you can't do them wrong you don't
you try to treat them right and so when
i get there i'm sitting down so look
here
um if i meddle in your little family
cold
and told you to take your daughter to
the hospital what you should have done
without me telling you i'm sorry
it'll never happen again
but if
if you it'll never happen again
if you keep your children and take care
of your children but if i see you don't
take care of your children again and
something like this happens i'm gonna do
the same thing
i'm telling man and it'll be over let's
say y'all going bout to get
all right y'all that's it with that

all right let's go right to everybody
easy one nation they're reflecting
i have never experienced the public
relationship like that i wanted my
helping my lady out as long as i'm not
used okay let me tell you something when
i first when these dean the first hour
on our wedding day on our wedding day at
the reading reception we had a reading
reception
and
the first you know when you in the
filipino style whenever you get married
at the wedding reception then the cop
the couple have to get up and say stuff
so lisa d oh first i got out of csf
right
and then the first thing i said it was
no one other thing that's i don't know
the first i said
i'm not going to be used as an atm
machine
and everybody
they were mad at me
oh lord you can see the stairs on their
face
because that's what they do they will
use you and abuse you for your multi
answer if you let them and when i set
the stage when i set the stage i had
nobody begging me
because i already said stay you got to
set the stage okay and when you do that
listen to me good ladies and gentlemen
when you do that you're not going to be
uh they're not going to be thinking good
good of you because you already set the
stage that you're not going to be using
abused financially you're not your atm
you're not the financial clear financial
plan you're not you don't want nobody
begging so that's what i did and when i
did that man you know they didn't like
it but they understood where i was
coming from and i
got respect respect know that don't come
up on me begging me and that's what you
have to do you have to set the line i i
talked to y'all a few days ago about
boundaries what i say
boundaries you have to set a boundary
around yourself and when you carry
yourself and the way you talk to the
people that you are to be respected and
obey me okay and that's what i did and
very suddenly what people beg me uh and
then i made another rule when people beg
i said i wouldn't ask them i said go see
go see and i already told this d i'm
gonna give him nothing
no i i would tell you if it's an urgent
need somebody sick dying whatever it
will help but other than that nothing
and so that's how you got to do you got
to set around parameters around yourself
and a boundary and a guideline and a map
so so people know how to take you man
and if you don't do that they're going
to take you to the cleaners clean your
clock out
you say oh sure there you go there you
go there you go and you ain't never next
thing you turn around your wallet is
empty your nickname next you turn around
your water's empty and you got no money
you got no haunting you got nothing
nothing but regrets how do you want to
live your life filled with regrets do
you want to live your life filled with
regrets no i don't want to do that i
want to live my life my way the right
way the tight way the long way in a
strong way and if that leads me to
regression then so be it but it's my way

people
is a tough one for people to deal with
i'm saying you gotta remain calm okay
and sometimes
i have trouble with that when
according to the situation
like i mentioned a problem i had when i
first opened the show
i got that through me man because i
i'm a kind of person
you got to have when i deal with you you
got to have some type of sense okay
common sense common decency for me to
deal with you and when i see you don't
have common sense and decency it's hard
man
it's hard for me to deal with somebody
you see somebody's arm messed up take
them to the hospital man
and so when i saw that man i lost you i
i didn't cuss them out
take that nurse you know anyway yeah you
gotta you gotta remain calm man that's

right here
you can find angel hope you are as well
doing good in the house doing good in
the hot rod train bobby lee see one nice
shot
i hear you mystery sand
and mr sandman
perfect
sir terry
miss your last two lives due to blood
pressure problems just check that 166
over 105. okay 1661 okay i'm sorry to
hear your blood pressure was high that's
too high what i would what i would
suggest you do my brother is chill just
relax
calm down have you ever thought of if
you heard ever heard of meditation i
want to get you some meditation tapes
and sit down and go through some
meditation uh that will help you relax
your body relax your mind and uh when
you relax your body
it'll walk you through it's called
guided meditation if you can find
someone on the internet on youtube free
and relax okay drink a lot of liquids
smooth if you if you don't drink a lot
of liquids i'm not talking about no
liquor
i gotta talk about those slits okay
leave the alcohol alone that's not good
for your pressure
drink a lot of water
tea
don't eat a lot of sweets yeah these are
sweets it's not going to be fresh oily
food
salt leave that stuff along
you like i see you like to cook a lot
when you shouldn't cook with no don't
put any salt in your food leave that
alone i don't eat i don't put
you know easy don't put no salt in my
food sometimes you doing i can tell it
immediately because i look cannot say
enough she i don't know it but when i
taste it i can taste the salt she can't
tell and she don't think i can't taste i
said i tasted salty you couldn't tell me
we go through that a lot but uh don't
put no salt in your food man how you eat
and how you rest get a lot of rest as
much rest as you can you need to bring
your pressure that's too high 166 is too
high okay
the always the under under is okay i
mean 105 80. you want to try to bring
that down too but the 166 is the one
that you need to drop that down you need
because you already got pressure you
probably take your medication you take
your medication uh and and get that down
to at least 140 150 that's a good range
for you but that 166 is too high if
you're doing what i i'm doing what i
tell you to do get you some rest eat
that salt alone stop eating all that
grease and sugar
and uh eat a lot of vegetables and fruit
and get you some guided meditation close
your eyes and relax think about the
goodness of god
relax and let the person on the
meditation take guide you through
relaxing your body
uh you you will wind up lowering your
pressure the more relaxed you are the
more lower your blood pressure goes but
one thing just keep with the blood
pressure
drink a lot of liquids
water primarily on teeth you want to
drink at least 12 10 to 12 glasses a day
or one gallon a day i know that's a lot
but i drink that every day not at least
i drink that every day and there's
nothing to it that drinking the water
floods and lowers your pressure okay and
what hap what happens when you drink a
lot of water you gotta do it
come on man think think what happens
when you drink a lot of water
you get hype you get hydrated properly
and then you have to do what let that
out you have more direction right so
when you every time you go to the
restrooms called diuretics diuretics
you're letting the water out and when
you let the water out of your body
you're releasing you're lowering your
what blood pressure are you with me
the more water you let out of your
system the lower your blood pressure
goes so those of you that have high
blood pressure and you're not drinking
liquids and water constantly you're
causing part of your own problem if you
were to drink liquids constantly and
that would lower your pressure you would
need no pressure medicine okay one of
the things that doctors recommend for
people with high blood pressure is a
diuretic okay they give you a pill just
to make you go to the restaurant because
they know that when the more you pee the
more you let that water out your
pressure's gonna do what drop and you
can do it yourself with no medication
just drink the dog on water
drink tea and water i dropped 10 12
glasses a day every day sometime i
forget or we go out i might miss you
blast but
that's how i do let's go round trip who
we got murphy hayes happy early birthday

doing a story i'm just looking at a
story i'm about to do on thailand you're
right they're getting ready to open it
up on november 1st they're trying to get
monetized back in that country they lost
a lot

so they opened it up and they're opening
up to vaccinated people okay that's why
i told you guys out there you better go

the lights up round train bobby lee see
one night sean murphy hey
that was
to let the child suffer
i mean you got the same idea on that and
i that's why i got so
perturbed about it and and it just
bothered me man i can't i can't stand to
see somebody senselessly senselessly
letting something happen that you have
control you can help okay she had no
control when the child hurt herself okay
i understand that she came home from
school she saw her arm like that and
then she took her immediately you know
and she did she failed that child
and then she was in the united states of
a dog in america that's called neglect
child neglect and you can get locked up
for that stuff here
whatever they don't care
so i'm telling you man when you come in
this world when you come in the
philippine world and you deal with these
family people you better look out for
craziness okay and when i say craziness
i mean uh things that you at least never
expect that took me what hit me hard

i have found out that filipinos are very
sensitive and they hate to be
embarrassed when
even when they are wrong saving face is
very important to them very good point
athlete say they call it saving the face
they don't like to be embarrassed
uh whether they are wrong or whether
they're right they don't like nobody to
call them out okay they don't mind like
them we call it in the usa loud talk
they don't like nobody allowed to talk
to them let's put the spotlight on them
especially if they're wrong
they will go crazy and then they might
not show their hatred to you for it
right then because they'll be and then
as soon as you turn them back
you get hit with a two by four they
could cut you it they don't they won't
try to get you back in some kind of way
they don't like it okay let's go around
