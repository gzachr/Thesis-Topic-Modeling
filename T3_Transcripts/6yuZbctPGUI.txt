I'm not even looking at anything right now.
Is it?
Yes.
So right now, I am looking for inspiration for a couple workouts.
Like this, for example.
So the idea is that today, me and Ava, we're gonna do a couple video blog of exercises you guys can do in your living room.
I know Ava doesn't like a couple of working out, but I thought, hey,
if me and Ava do it into a fun thing, so it doesn't feel like a workout, then it could be something.
So I've found 10 to 12 different exercises that we're gonna film and show to our followers on my YouTube channel.
So if you haven't yet subscribed to Martin, head on over.
Link is right here.
It's important to keep your love exercised.
Okay, okay.
So let's go.
So let's go.
For you.
Let's go.
Thank you.
But, okay, wait.
What?
Wait.
Before we exercise.
What do you mean?
Let's clean up first.
What is it?
Did you get it?
Yeah, I know the word clean.
I don't like that one.
Okay, let's get it.
Wow, thank you.
Woohoo.
So you have a good feeling about the place you're messing with.
Yeah.
Oh, you're going to go away.
Go away.
You know what go away is?
Scrubbing.

Yeah, yeah.
One step at a time, love.

It was fun.
On his channel.
Make sure to subscribe to Martin if you haven't done that yet.
We are done with exercising.
Wow.
It was really fun to do the exercise with you and I'm really proud of you for joining in.
We don't normally do this.
It's our first time.
If one positive thing with all these things is that we do and challenge ourselves to do
things we normally don't do.
If I can do it, you can do it.
Anyone can do it.
True.
Shout out to Mama Lovin' It for influencing me to exercise.
It's Mama Lovin' It.
