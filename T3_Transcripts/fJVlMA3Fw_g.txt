 Big Migs, Biggie Travels. Good afternoon to all my carbo up out there. London is so hot it's literally on fire. Wildfires are starting to occur across the country and smoke is in the air. Blazing hot temperatures reached over 40 degrees Celsius here in the UK. Fans paddling pools, ice cream, even burgers were getting sold out like crazy as Britain prepared for the heatwave. My friends went to the gym just to enjoy the aircon. It's the hottest temperatures ever recorded here in the UK. So what we're going to do is we want to see if we can cool London down. We want to give Londoners Filipino ice candy. So do you think Londoners are going to like Filipino ice candy? I have no idea. Recently there was an earthquake in Philippines as well. So we wanted to give back. We wanted to donate. A powerful 7.0 earthquake has struck the Philippines Island. Luzon is the northern island of the Philippines and located there are a lot of historical sites and monuments. Here is the Bantai bell tower in vegan city that is crumbling people running for their lives. People's homes have been destroyed. Some people have died. Others are injured or are missing currently being located. So I wanted to give back and give money to a charity that is active. Here's the Philippines Red Cross. Let's go and donate some money to them today. 2,000 pesos. Donate with PayPal. Love from vegan travels. Donate thing. And whatever money we make on this platform on this channel, we want to use it for good causes. So if you hit the like today, if you hit subscribe, you'll be helping the channel out. For every new subscriber I get, I'm going to donate an extra peso to any good cause charity. So thank you so much for your generosity. Thank you for always supporting my content. I really appreciate you guys. Arah, let's go. It's way too hot. We need to think of ways to cool down. In the man drinking session. Shot a thunder door. Come by. No, don't drink. Oh, unsaroud. Tabo, shower time. Look, follow, follow. Aray, time I buy. Chill your eggs. Oh, check the ear corn. I love me. It was so hot you could fry an egg. Tabo, I need it. I'm going to use it for the egg. Okay, enough monkey in a round. Let's make some ice candy. I realize we don't have any ingredients, so we're going to go buy some awful quarters. And we're going to pick up some alcohol. I'm eating it. Talk about alcohol. Have to get those ingredients. Gonna make it, hopefully, in about 15 minutes to the shop. So I ran talk about alcohol for like 1.9 miles. Run here and we finally made it to Pinoy Mart. I'm going to go get the ingredients. Okay, I'm literally sweating. I'm like a madman. But yeah, we got the goods. Let's get ready to make. Ramiesalam. Literally, it's so hot today. I can't run anymore. But I got all the snacks that we've been up to. We need to pick up some other quarters and we'll be all good. Yo, it was mad hot, brother. I needed some help. So I was walking down the road and I saw my guys going to help me go get some other quarters. God damn, look at the ride. Yo, you're new and you're ready to ride. Let's go. We're pulling into a little now. Oh yeah, in a bit, bro. First, we got to match these other quarters. Or if you cut it like that. And one condensed milk. Can you add some water on top? Once it's blended, we add the macapuno. Bussing. Then you go to halohalo in the mix mix. Push it back. Hold your closed down. Let's resolve it. What do you do for status? Take the air out as much as we can. And then you take it out. Ayan, ta da! Insan. Angda me! So it's so hot. There's a fire on the track. So we just want to put it off the train.
