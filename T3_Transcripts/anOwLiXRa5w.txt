good afternoon everyone and welcome to the 
Philippines so this is our first episode here  
in the Philippines and we are here in Manila 
so we're just roaming around the street and  
see what's new and first thing first I noticed 
already cars here actually drive on the left  
side so you can see driver's seats on the left 
side and it's completely opposite of Thailand or  
any of the last few countries I went to but I know 
Korea they drive on the left side as well I think  
but anyway we are back in the main street here 
so now after the chaotic night last night we  
only slept for around maybe three hours or four 
hours just then so now we're hitting the streets  
to hopefully find some food because we're really 
hungry we haven't eaten since last night I think  
it's okay yeah Alina is so sleepy but as you 
can see this very interesting Transportation I  
don't know there is a seat on the side of 
the driver and we're back on Main Street  
right now we don't really have a goal we just want 
to find food so randomly let's go on this side
and also our goal today is to find food and try 
some new Filipino food and also we need to find  
a good SIM card as well and we don't really 
know what the price should be but luckily
a police motorbike oh no baby everything 
is okay don't worry oh man after last  
night we are not having it we don't have 
enough sleep and wow this is not really  
anyway my first impression of Philippines oh 
[ __ ] did I step on it there was a vomit in the  
middle of the floor oh no I hope I didnt step 
on it but my impression of the Philippines I  
yeah what is this yeah so so far we've been seeing 
a lot of like really old architectures but I guess  
we haven't actually fully explored City but so 
far when we were driving past this town there  
are lots of old old buildings we're here in the 
district of malach Malaki is it Makati in Makati  
so we're here in this Makati I'm not too sure 
if this area is an old area but it seems like  
most of the buildings here they look pretty old 
just are honest opinion no offense no offense
and just then when we're driving to our hotel I 
think another thing that I noticed is the traffic  
here is pretty insane traffic here is a bit 
like Bangkok quite chaotic what do you think the  
difference between here Bangkok traffic I don't 
know I think there are so many scooters as well  
many scooters oh there's food baby see this time 
on this trip to the Philippines I really want  
to eat ah we've got laundry here okay noted 
so later we'll come back to laundry because  
we've got a whole big loads of clothes let's 
see how much it is to do laundry here as well  
oh 60 peso per washing 60 peso am I saying 
the right peso 60. anyway six peso for one  
load of seven kilograms Max so what are 
these transportations called? so cool
surely they have a name that's bus I don't 
know I think this kind of low-key reminds me of  
Malaysia hello
Filipinos are all so nice
so chaotic my God being in Makati there is a mix 
of tall buildings and short buildings as well  
let's go to ask police where we can buy 
SIM card okay yeah right we'll go and ask  
police since everyone is so nice here oh 
Crossing it's not easy so chaotic my God
crossing is not easy not easy enough
oh my God
let's see how long we'll be stuck here
endless amounts of cars I 
think we just follow the locals
okay
alright oh bank maybe we need some cash as well  
yeah all the Filipinos here are so so so 
friendly so if I haven't met one that's  
like unkind to us wait is that a word 
unfriendly I guess anyway we're heading  
to 7-Eleven so maybe that's our first reaction 
of 7-Elevens here in the Philippines as well  
alright guys so now that we've got cash we're 
heading into 7- 11 to do a reaction let's see
[Music]
thank you so guys many of you have been asking me 
Justin what kind of insurance do you use for your  
travel so see I've been to Malaysia Thailand 
Singapore Korea the last few months and what  
kind of insurance do I use so there is actually 
Insurance here that's specifically for digital  
Nomads it's called Safety wings so compared to 
other insurance this insurance is super affordable  
it's only 42 US dollars for 28 days and you can 
pay a minimum of five days and you can cancel  
anytime as well with no reason and the best part 
of this insurance is that it's covid coverage so  
it covers your madatory quarantine costs apart 
from that it also covers lost checked package  
and also travel delays and the awesome part is 
you can buy this insurance very last minute so  
super last minute you can even buy it even when 
you're on the plane so no pre-approval no complex  
form super easy to find online so there you 
go that's my recommendation for insurance now  
let's jump back into the video okay let's see how 
different it is here in 7-11 here in Philippines  
mm-hmm what's new I have never seen 
this before this looks very interesting  
that's your favorite chocolate do they 
specialize in chocolate in the Philippines
mushrooms I think this is your favorite 
aisle already chocolate but again
so many chocolate options because it's like same 
like a Russian money exactly the same uh it's  
the exact same if it's 32 like in Philippines 
yep in Russia it's 33. so it's very similar  
then and good they have marshmallows because in 
Thailand they don't have marshmallows like never  
so good okay let's look at the other aisles  
snacks what's new here cheesy this 
looks interesting I like spicy food  
oh I like it it's like Australian Style I think 
that's 81 for a big pack of Oreo oh they have oh
I love these bbay it's price exactly the same like 
the price in Russia does that remind you at home  
even cheaper oh they have different 
flavors wait no baby look at this  
birthday sprinkles that's pretty cool I like it 
whoa so nice I've never seen this flavor before  
I like it I like it oh here in the Philippines and 
7-Elevens they've got hot food here as well it's  
it's exactly like jollibee fried chicken with 
rice wow hot food and they've got some is it  
dimsum oh no that's hard boiled egg right there 
and they've got some what is this fried bread  
fried bread chocolate bread inside interesting 
very interesting what is this this looks like I  
think it's rice baby it's like Indonesian style 
oh this reminds me of the food poisoning I had  
last time in Bali this is what I had let's see 
what they have for hot food as well what is this
real liempo or with bangkong it's like some pork 
ribs kind of thing and we've got chicken drumstick  
and what's yeah omelette tuna omelette French 
toast whoa they have good options yeah wow they  
don't have um you know like Thailand sandwich 
but yeah good options your favorite I was like  
cheese melts yes it's like Thailand style and I 
think they're making for you yeah they do have  
a toastie there so friends in Thailand if you're 
missing your toasty you come to the Philippines  
you won't be missing out oh your favorite you

we we're not sharing okay okay okay okay okay okay
alright let me have a look at other columns 
as well so Let's see we didn't finish the  
aisles here so we've got lots of can options 
beef love I think it's pretty standard cereal  
options not too many you know they've only got 
Frosty here Thailand has more um let's see what  
else got different flavored chips here and for 
drinks let's see what their famous beer here is
I can't see what's new here and next column 
they've got milkis Korean milkis love it and  
I don't think I've seen it before apple flavored 
soda and what else is here it's got some energy  
drink Gatorade um got collagen as well yeah 
they've got pretty standard drinks nothing too  
too too too outstanding alright so for me today 
I'll get one of those toastie sandwich here and  
this one right here is two cheese pepperoni so 
I'm gonna grab that and see compare with the ones  
in Thailand and see how differently and they've 
also got French toast here as well egg drop Korean  
Style one thing I noticed here in the Philippines 
7-Eleven is that there are so many Korean options
yeah it's like a cup for drink water oh 
yeah it makes sense doesn't look like a  
cup yeah pretty cool smart design smart 
design and you've got bananas as well
I like 7-Elevens here they're cool yeah thank you
how are you alright so all that costs 167 pesos 
and they give us paper bag as well which is good  
in Thailand everywhere it's plastic bag but yeah 
maybe a bag not bad not bad I like it and let's  
see uh how colorful the other notes are as well 
thank you oh oh the coins are relatively bigger  
as well I think the cockroach okay that's five 
thank you yep am I toasty so we've got different  
notes there as well no sit outside okay notes 
purple 100 and the red one is 20. delicious
What? so delicious marshmallow
but one thing you should notice is that in 
the Philippines the coins the ones and the  
five they look exactly the same size because 
the coins and the design is almost identical  
the only difference is if you actually look at 
a number then you will see a difference okay I  
think it's time for us to go back to get my 
toastie okay so guys we're learning uh for  
Filipinos here very Filipino salamat 
PO is for foreigners and salamat uh
uh is uh pertaining on your generosity
in Korea are you in your in your in your 
country in your grandma yeah oh it's like  
when you have respects like your respects 
ah then you say salamat po yeah I see ah  
gotcha I like learning I like learning 
Filipinos thank you all right thank you
teach me another word teach me 
how do you say how are you foreign
I like learning languages it's like learning Thai 
when I first started this backpack trip I like it  
I like it give me more words guys hit up in the 
comments and I'll learn all of them got two cheese  
pepperoni it's almost like a pizza in the middle 
so let's have a try so here it says mozzarella  
cheese and cheddar cheese and you've got pepperoni 
slices and we've got Italian bread as well pizza  
sauce so tomato sauce basically it looks something 
like this inside now let me show you more it's  
softer compared to Thailand I think Thailand it's 
like crispy always very crispy okay let's see
to be honest guys it tastes very 
much just like a pizza pizza slice
a bit hot baby yeah okay yeah this is crispy  
it's like pizza now is it oh not good tuna Mayo 
oh okay how was your dessert though it's nice
you finish up oh you didn't give it to 
me but anyway Filipinos you guys know it  
your 7-Eleven is Alina's favorite now is it yeah
wait so many flies here yeah if what means there 
are many big like really big flies guys honestly  
these I don't know what they are called but maybe 
they are buss but I think it looks really cool so  
if you guys can tell me what the name of this 
bus is called that would be awesome and also  
how do you catch one of those do you just like 
wave your hand and they would just stop for you  
let me know in the comments because I really 
want to try to take on one of those bus in  
another day and also those bikes I know what 
they're called but it's pretty cool next to  
the driver there's a passenger seat I know 
what they're called but like these ones so  
cool hey uh do you sell SIM cards here these 
have SIM cards here for phone yeah yeah yeah
oh only blue what does that mean blue oh get up 
to nine gigs only ah globe globe I see ah how  
much is it 40 40 for okay okay nine gigs can we 
like put inside another like unlimited internet  
can we put money change like change internet 
can okay okay yep so we'll get we'll get  
through then I guess we've got two how much 
is this one 40 pesos 40 pesos okay 80 pesos  
in total for just a SIM card and nine gigs 
or no no no internet just just the same  
adjust the same access it's a new top 
up on top okay okay alright cool yeah 40  
pesos sounds fine guys I'm liking this Vlog 
already learning quite a few Filipino words  
balan po means goodbye all right so we've 
got the globe SIM card and now we are just  
figuring out how we can top up the amounts and 
you can see many different options here foreign
guys so now that we've got the SIM card but 
we're not quite sure how we can actually get  
logged in into uh to start using the mobile 
data so we're going to head to McDonald's and  
hopefully we can get Wi-Fi and set up the app 
and I think from there you get top up but uh  
yeah right now let's see we've got SIM card it's 
called Globe I'm not too sure if it's a good one  
but I will be here for around two months so if 
you've got any better recommendations let us  
know alright so what we realized is that you got 
to grab one of these apps here but for example  
globe one and click on it and uh there's like 
a surprise you can click on it and you activate  
your four gigabytes or something so finally got 
it done so we've got our Internet working now  
and we're ready to hit the road again alright 
guys so that concludes our first episode in the  
Philippines our first impression of Manila and if
