The sound of the song is like The sound of the song is like It's like a natural Interesting All right I can feel it It's so weird Yeah, I get it but like It's so deep It's like a natural high It's so deep What he's actually trying to say is Instead of the person getting hit with drugs It's more of like the country Being in a festival with chemicals and pollution and stuff And the Philippines is getting sick Oh It's so cool It's like a cool dream I like it, I like the message Can you mean the lyrics for me It's like a style of the music It's like colorful It looks like you're kind of on like high Yeah, natural Natural, natural I like him Shantido Shantido Oh The last video is the highly requested music video of Sartre On the most 2016 hit entitled Bala What's Dala?

I love the first one It was really nice The voice of the singer And the video was so classic I really loved it For the second one When I found out the meaning That's the way I realized Also, that's why the movie is hip hop The video is epic-friendly But it's not my style Last video, it was hard for me to understand The concept But I liked it also The song was interesting I think it's very varying You see from the classic OPM music videos To the hip pop music videos Then to the traditional Traditional, trendy at the same time So it's nice to see a time line of Filipino music There were some cultural events And traditional things Traditional, trendy There were some cultural events Yes, when I watched the music video I didn't know I could And then the cultural events And then the traditional events And then the music video That's not shown The music video The music video That's right That's right The hidden message That's the fun to watch music videos That's right But rather, K-pop The singers are fancy But sometimes I can find that They're really And they're thin Or the meaning of the song Is sometimes big The funny thing is when I was K-pop I can understand what they're saying But I can understand what the song is about But, although when I was OPM I wasn't able to understand their language But I could point out their message They're really good Chemicals How Alerics or music video relate to chemicals It's meaningful Shady dope Shady dope I know Koreans really don't make a lot of rap videos I know Korean American people Like J-Port They make a lot of rap videos They make a lot of rap videos I think that's like it's kind of an influence Like now, you see J-Port And all these rappers coming up And the colorful scenes They have a lot of color schemes I think that's something similar But the first video, the This band video There's a lot of similarities with the Korean music videos Where the first piano and the guitar And there's a love story Exactly Was the Samsung screen The game music video That's the end of a video You guys hear that I mean, the songs That us Did you hear the回 on the LORD?
