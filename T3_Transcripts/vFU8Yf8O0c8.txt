we got some questions from our subscribers and viewers
are you ready i don't know if i'm ready it depends on the questions
you didn't want to share the questions with me i think i saw one of the questions
so it's nice it's a surprise yeah so if this conversation turned violent we'll do the r18 on
this vlog if he will have a black eye later anyways watch out for next video to see if i any
abuse of scars or not yeah um first question yeah who sent the first question is from
ma'am jula may jula may yeah shout out to you ma'am jula may hi jula um so jula what's your
question her question is how you guys argue does he used to talk slang africans if he's mad
so i guess that question is for you how you guys argue so it means guys so he's a guy so guy
i'm just joking i don't know what do you think do i ever use kind of slang when i argue with you
do i ever say something that you don't really know well africans we don't use africans when
we argue but you kind of big slang in a way and sometimes i have to say huh like that say that
again just making sure i heard it right no she usually say say that again like she's challenging
me to argue more oh i said say that again are you sure yes well i think i'm not a very vocal guy
when it comes to arguments yeah so it's not like i'm swearing that much i must be really angry
before i start swearing or very frustrated so maybe when i'm really angry frustrated i might
use a few slang swear words african swear words but hopefully that doesn't happen too often
i try and hold my tongue with this one yeah normally when we had an argument he doesn't
talk that much and sometimes i will feel like are you listening to me that's the cause of another
argument that's when i'm too quiet yeah i'm talking and talking and talking and he's just
sitting so i'm allowing her to vent feeling the arguments but i think that's good though
that's good because as a woman if we get with this enough temper or we are angry and then
the guy will talk back more and it's just in mind it's good that you are quiet
okay remember what you said i'm quiet but sometimes it's also nice if you get responded
like acknowledgement yeah as long as they like the response yeah all right so yeah so arguments
is something every couple has i guess everyone arguing their own way depending on your personality
i am an introvert she is like somewhere in the middle she can be an introvert sometimes but she
can be very extroverted yeah so i guess depends on their personality so if i don't really
don't feel the anger so i would just let her vent and just listen all right let's go to the next
question okay i hope you like our answer ma'am julemi next question is from roselle violet roselle
yes she's very curious what is roselle's question
actually she has three questions what yes her first question is when is the date you guys met
oh my god okay so date there is a i mean that depends the first time we actually made contact
like we had a conversation or when we had a real chat because okay actually we haven't made a video
about our story how we met yet but i think many of the viewers know that we met online
yeah we met online a dating site called date in asia actually i'm the one who saw him first
i'm the one who messaged you we're not telling the whole story how we met that's another vlog
but the point that we're trying to make is that she messaged me and i think i replied after a day
or two when i got the message but it was yeah but it wasn't really excuse me you replied to me right
away so you did okay that's a lighthearted argument because i remember in the beginning
there wasn't much of a conversation yeah that's true making a comment replying to the comment
or answering one question something like that but i think the day we started we know for sure that
we started really conversing and having a good conversation was on the third of november so
that's also the date we chose as our monsery of course uh yeah the filipinos like to celebrate
monseries uh something we don't do in western parties i've never celebrated well maybe the
first few months we'll celebrate yeah it's now now it's two months but i've noticed after like
four years she was still so happy monsery yeah it's true though we celebrate monsery
but the third of november yeah it's our i would say the day we really met because that's when
we actually have a good conversation yeah we talked until morning that's right yeah we really
started eating it off once we really started chatting uh what's that next question the second
question is what do you like about each other what do you like about each other everything
i like everything about your aunt
uh the thing that attracted me most about uh grace i would say um when we started chatting
and i started to get to know her better was uh i think she was very sincere in the way she spoke
i could feel the sincerity the honesty behind her words
and uh and yeah the longer i get to know her you know uh she has a very good heart yes
a very innocent heart uh that's well that being said that innocent heart very sensitive person
sometimes yeah but i mean her sensitivity is admirable in a way uh just show the kindness of
a heart so um so i think yeah that if i have to pick uh two characteristics it's your sincerity
and your good heart really attracted me a lot about you and of course your beautiful appearance
yeah i found it very attractive yeah once we started the first time we were on camera together
i remember thinking i said well it's actually very attractive her photo her profile picture
didn't do much justice
in my profile before that was like wow seven years ago stick to the question what do you like
about me honey this lovely guy that you met well what i like and love about him is he's very again
sincere loyal gentleman and honest and he means his words and of course guapo
oh
and yeah um i think from all the you know what woman wants is he have it and i always feel lucky
every day and yeah i'm gonna blush are you are you but that's true though because every every
woman dreams about a humble man a gentleman a responsible man anything and you are 99 percent
yeah that's why she feels that way i know i have qualities that are lacking
that's what i said that's what i said there is no such perfect ingredients when it comes to a
person and when it comes to a relationship so the other part where it's not included in the
ingredients is you have to what you call that in english you have to compromise
yeah sure that's what makes the relationship work yeah you have to accept the good qualities
and the negative qualities that the person carries at the end of the day i feel like
the good qualities is what initially attracts us to the person and i think that the good qualities
overshadow the bad negative qualities and we have really good like good connection
when it comes to talking about anything and that's very important in a relationship connection
the chemistry the chemistry yeah so for the third question
who's most annoying
definitely
okay who's most annoying yeah i think it's me uh well i think uh i will begin by saying
what do you find annoying because the different people have different qualities that might annoy
you depending on what annoys you um i mean in general i don't find you annoying uh to be honest
i mean i like her company i feel always were comfortable in grace's company so i don't easily
get annoyed by her i think what annoys me sometimes if i have to think of one thing
there's one more than one
if i have to pick one and like i said it's not it's not a serious and a serious annoyance
but it's like that can sometimes annoy me is when she said something and i didn't hear the last part
of it so she would say remember when we went to coconut bay and we had that coffee milkshake
and then when you spilled the milkshake the cat came and licked it up i said the cat what
and she would start the whole story again she would go back to the beginning and say you remember
when we went to coconut bay and we had that milkshake instead of just telling me the last part
you know it's like i just want to know that last part that's the only part i haven't heard you know
well i don't realize because i didn't realize that i i jeez i don't know if i'm doing that
do that a few times yeah i guess in the beginning things like that you don't really
really pick it up but after seven years together and it happens more often then yeah sometimes
there's little things i don't even realize i'm doing that i don't even realize it i think it's
well of course you're not gonna annoy me on purpose i hope
and i'm gonna do it more often than all right anything that annoys me about you yes
well same way is like how you respond to me you know when i like maybe i'm saying it right away
and again and you i still don't understand your response and you maybe you get annoyed by that
and that's the time i get annoyed by that response like i told you actually that's true yes so
actually me being annoyed annoyed yeah i think yeah so what is it the connection the vibration
so yeah it can be a chain reaction so yeah so i i don't like repeating myself too often so if
it comes to the third time she asked me to repeat myself i'm like my god this this and this just
listen and then i will respond like then why are you talking to me like this and then it changes
the whole mood of the conversation but it's normal for every relationship it's normal well i guess
it's partly my fault i mean i have a problem of mumbling and i said it two times why haven't you
heard me and also the the difficult one of the most difficult in a in a two culture what you call
that is the language barrier it's i'm trying to speak in english and then trying to let him
understand but i use a different english word and then he get it wrong because he doesn't
understand it the way i want him to understand yeah i guess that's always gonna be there you
know i mean she's pretty fluent in the language uh but yeah her way of expressing it maybe some
small grammar mistakes you know i might understand it slightly different than i should have let's go
i don't think we really have that serious answers for who's most annoying because mostly we talk
about it and we yeah i think every relationship the longer you stay together the better you get
to know each other and the more comfortable you get with each other you know this oh god now i
just fought uh but i won't say it i don't want to embarrass you it's something to do with toes
oh yeah that's honestly can i say that yeah sure
or watching a movie and i just hear this
and it's her busy picking her toes the dead skin from her toes
i find it so annoying especially when i can hear it but i also catch up on
the peripheral vision of my eye i can see something going on there but when i can hear it
i get really and then the next time i know i just hear that stop that yeah i'm trying to get it out
of that habit it's just a habit yes and apparently everyone likes to like bite or whatever
everyone was like to like scratch her everyone has a habit forward i hope
russell violet you like all the answers and shout out to you my pretty knees
and next question is from roje and la vita and that's her nickname
so it's in bisaya so i want you to really yeah and say it louder jeez there's so many lights
the flash and this is your light is so bright
where is it yeah that one yeah not there oh this one this one
um
what is what yes what of the two of you
dua what's something the two of you i don't know what's is like
something like who likes to argue who likes to argue most who likes to argue most
we all know it's you me no one's gonna argue against that
i think she's the one that's always up for argument
but you just admitted that i will keep quiet well i'm just saying what i wanted to say
as a woman she feels she needs to say what she wants to say this is my advice
this is not about arguing this is my advice to all the women out there sometimes it's good to speak
sometimes we are not arguing we are just we just want you to know how we feel
they want you to know how angry they are
yeah okay so uh i think so that's the question who likes to argue more between the two of you
yeah yeah no i'm uh actually i don't enjoy that much unless i get offended and i will say what i
think um she likes to express her feelings like i would guess most women actually like to i guess
men in general we tend to keep our emotions more intact women are more expressive with their
emotions so in that sense i would say that women women are more up for arguments sorry
well maybe i'm a stereotype i'm saying that not all men would just focus on the questions about
us because i we don't want to offend you feel that oh not all women likes to speak up that's true for
their own reasons so and i agree with grace in that sense it's good for women to yeah let your
man know what you're feeling what do you want so there's no confusion yeah of course but that
being said even if you express all your emotions i'm still confused sometimes why are you feeling
that welcome to the woman world yeah it's one of those life mysteries yeah i hope roje and
you like our answers and the next question is from mj pahing that's your sister yeah shout out to
my sister because she also wants to ask a question so her soul gonna ask so didn't ask
so you're sitting right there why didn't you ask
so well okay her question is what is the memorable moment that the both of you cannot forget
can i go first yeah because i noticed you keep on going first
just joking well the most memorable moments that i will never forget is when we were in china i was
working in china as a singer and then we found out that i was pregnant yeah that was like a month and
one and a half month pregnant and then i had this mood swings and i i hated him
i don't know why but i every time i see him i i don't like him because i don't know hormonal
whatever so i caused an argument again with him and then i just went because it's two rooms in
our apartment so i went to the other room i locked myself in and i was just crying and crying
and crying there inside and you know what he did all i heard was a guitar playing and he's on the
outside the door but he's singing there and he never stopped singing until i i'm okay
oh that's to me i will never forget that moment because that is so romantic
i didn't realize i'm such a romantic yeah yeah that's that's why i remember that
well okay that's i decided to open the door so yeah um those memorable moments
yeah we had a few memorable moments uh i would say the first one that comes to mind is the first
time we met in person so i remember getting off the airport and collecting my bags from
the baggage claim area and walking outside trying to scan the crowd where is grace but actually i
was carrying a mobile phone for someone else so i worked with a colleague and her daughter came to
the airport to pick something up that she was sending to her and i came out and i tried to scan
or where is this woman you know it's like i can't see in the crowd so i wasn't even sure she was
there to be honest but then yeah so i arrived there and i'm like almost in the crowd and actually
my colleague's daughter recognized me first she came up to me like oh hi hello kieran and then
i said hi how are you doing and then i gave her the package from her mother and
while i'm talking to her just being friendly saying hello and then you came up to me i said
hey and then yeah that's the first time we met so it felt a little awkward because my focus was
shifted to the person the other person there collecting package and then she just suddenly
pop up there and we met and i think we gave each other a hug that was very awkward isn't it
the first meeting to all of you who have long distance relationship and then you plan to
you know meet for real i'm telling you it's the first awkward moment is in the airport
yeah the very first moment you meet was quite awkward but yeah so that's the first time i
realized exactly how tiny she actually is i didn't realize you are that tiny
and so yeah and then we got into the taxi i said goodbye to the other person and said yeah now we
need to go the taxi is waiting for us and then yeah once we got into the taxi we started chatting
and yeah suddenly all those nerves and awkwardness just dissipated yeah disappeared
and we actually had a great afternoon at coconut bay that day that's how i always remember the
first day we first met so what else there's more there's one more uh it's from anna tabasan my
who's that it's actually the mother of roje and who works abroad all fw as well
no anna anna tabasan is the one who's working abroad which country kuwait i think she's in kuwait
hi anna yeah shout out to you marin
so he wrote the questions in bisaya so again yes you have to learn this looks so long
um
wow is this like a texting style are these words actual words or yeah yeah it is but i mean the way
it's written is not actually the way it's spelled like what that did
good uh yeah uh messing with oh and then no yeah okay i find it confusing i don't know those
acronyms for for the text slang okay what is you can translate for us i have no idea it means uh
wait wait i'm gonna read it in bisaya on so my gusto good nia
samut kamahegugma
he's she's asking
so the question is what does she like that makes you fall in love more what do you like
it makes me fall in love
um well i think yeah actually now i think about it not such a difficult question i
talked i mentioned i mentioned uh anna that something that attracted me from the beginning
was her sincerity and her good heart so actually yes um i think her kindness to to other people
as well as strangers yeah just really giving and very generous to people i think that's something
very admirable about grace i can tell you just have to eat carrots yeah it comes very natural
to her it's very admirable and i think yeah i admire her for that i mean i like to think of
myself as a good hearted person but i mean to her um yes her generosity is just amazing um so yeah
that's definitely i would say and something really admirable about her that make me love her
much more can you see it there's a big heart heart
right okay i think i've answered that question yeah so that's that's all the questions and yeah
