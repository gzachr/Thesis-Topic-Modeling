 Okay good morning folks 1015 am 9 October 2020 to load it up getting ready to go to the land over there for the world diggers see if they need anything else that's Sabrina in the back there's EJ over there all right they're all buckled in there's Lady Jazz over here I don't know why she's doing that where okay anyway we're getting ready to head that way it was just getting started here kids with the church this morning my LJC's in church now so he's gonna give him some private time but we got the kids loaded in the back and head and west or north northwest all right so you there okay see the growth over here really what's the association would come knock this down I don't want to keep doing it myself it's not my property it's the people's to the right's property but everybody I guess just let it let's it grow because they don't have cars most of them and then I guess it eventually will some dies but we need to cut it I had a biol J come down here one time all the way down here just trimming up the south roadway I may have him do that again soon or maybe call your mic tomorrow just because it's starting to scrape this out of my truck again so not clear it totally but just stuff like that where it's hanging out in the road here this is Sarah Vista subdivision here in Nagbonga so this is it's not well cupped up they got mentioned in previous videos that the association was coming on over a month ago now and they were cleaning there was some cleanup efforts but then they stopped all of a sudden they got right down here to the right they cleared away this one house and then they stopped there's a house here you can't see it the foliage this house right there the green looking one greenish whatever aqua colorway that was completely covered in weeds and grasses you couldn't even tell there was a house there this got cleaned up over here and they were doing just along the roads here but then they stopped so anyway this is our one way in and one way out we have other ways this is just one way and then but where we we reside over here so as you can see it's now as nice as where we're going to be living but it is what it is all right folks it's gonna make a turn here then there's the local they cleared this out too these wave of events are too to my horn it's the void that we had working in the yard one day force a couple of months ago all right ciao getting ready to get on the highway in our back for day two they should be finishing it today I'm just getting ready to set up their tower here they just actually just finished it they're getting ready to start pulling up and dropping the heavy weight down or drive the pipe in and it's supposed to finish today it's a beautiful day today as you can see blue skies white clouds and just confirmed through by all Jay that performing when they come back is going to have the guys start working at Varanda getting it ready for tile yet so the most recent update I've got current update is a plan to be finished with the inside of the house which will include the Varanda by the 5th of November there's a distinct possibility that at that point I am going to call a stop workage until I can pull in some more funds to finish the house on the external portion there may be some time that needs to go by before I can do that I'm putting much exhaust to the immediate resources I still have properties that haven't moved yet so we're working on that as well again this was all brought on by the embezzlement activity I'll call it of the person we hired to be in charge of this project so lots of other stories in the earlier videos but um so yeah that's what the plan is right now just showing another view is there's really there's only uh brother Jay because the other workers went home for a couple days to talk like to spend some time with their families so and I'm also going to call a halt to the overtime we did a week's worth of overtime so I just need to make sure I have enough funds for us I'll carry you through the new year okay hi folks thanks for joining I'm just sitting outside of my pump porch here and I got the layhors listen to tunes just got down grillings and uh pork and chicken and watching the kids playing go where digging a little bit of dirt we got in our front yard here so we'll just let them have fun once we're done we gotta go inside and clean that take a
