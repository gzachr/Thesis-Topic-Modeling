[Music] 
good morning good morning and what are we
doing today today we are going on a private
boat trip here in Panglao Bohol and we're up
super early today because we're getting picked
up at 6 30 a.m it's too early is it raining
no it's not actually raining no yeah yes but
I think we need to get ready to be picked
up yeah get out of bed
doesn't feel like it though because it's bright
outside this is what happens early in the
morning we just don't see it
yes let's go good morning thank you thank
you Edgar again yeah thank you thank you bye
good morning bye
imagine trying to sleep here. It says no shouting 
I don' tthink that's the biggest problem you need to be worried about
Should I be rolling my trousers up? yeah probably okay hold on
 uh okay how do I do this okay
you look good the sun is just coming out now
looks like a decent day actually so this boat
tour is about a three or four hour boat tour
where we go to two islands yeah one's called
Virgin Island one's called Balicasag Island
oh yeah second one is just a sand bar in the
middle of the ocean here that we're gonna
go and see and then the other one Balicasag
island is a it's really circular Island it's
a really popular diving and snorkeling spot
on the way here now we should be able to see
some Dolphins along the way so that's really
exciting the last time we went snorkeling
was a disaster in Koh Samui in Thailand where
we went to one of the most popular snorkeling
spots and there was absolutely no fish at
all so hopefully we'll see something more
today these flip flops are probably gonna
break you know that might take them off I
don't know
we have to walk out in the ocean to our boat this is
kind of a fun way to start the morning we're
not normally up this early and it's like well
like six six thirty six forty five and we're
like wading our way to a boat in the ocean
in the Philippines it's amazing this is our
first boat trip in the Philippines first boat
trip in a long time yeah. Since Thailand
yeah very exciting let's try and get there
first yeah because were a bad idea
sorry I made it dirty nice we have this whole
boat to ourselves did we actually well apart
from the drivers yeah yeah can you imagine
now we have to ride this boat wow what's the
name of the boat? Sand Dollar. what does that mean?
sandals I mean no it means sand dollars yes
yeah keep that safe where's the backpack?
On my back. Oh okay
you have covered everything in wet sand with
your flip-flops flipping up at the back show
oh good morning okay that's fine it'll it'll
dry won't it yeah it's the same on the back
what did you do to my backpack our backpack
now
This boat is so much bigger than I expected it to be yeah
I expected like um one of those little things
this is just the two of us yeah so this boat
was way cheaper if you had more people but
we're only two so we just booked it for the
two of us
we just came across loads of dolphins
there's also loads of other boats here as
well where they've gone now though I could
just see the fins sticking out you didn't
see them yeah no but because we're going in
the water I didn't wear my glasses today I
didn't want it to like fly off on the boat
or get lost or go underwater or something
so I'm like this scanning
There's loads of them! I could see them!
wow they like properly came up I don't ever
think. I think I've seen a dolphin once
or twice next to a boat if I could hear them going 'woo'
so it must be
over there. You didnt need your glasses.
 no I was like this though oh that's so nice to see
I didn't think we were going to be
able to see like proper turquoise Waters today
I'm not gonna be able to hear you yeah it's
quite loud hope you can hear me yeah but it's
like constantly shallow you know it's just
so clear
Crazy blue starfish. that's so crazy I didn't think they that's
like such a cookie color wow that boat is
loud now we've made it to the first island
Balicasag Island there's a lot of boats here
so nice to have a private boat though yeah
oh but what a nice start to the day to see
the dolphins yeah did you see me get tear eyed
no it was like super emotional I don't know
why they're just so pure and beautiful and
I was like maybe I'm tired
just started raining now as we were
finishing off the snorkeling we started off
we got here and we had to pay the environmental
fee which is to you know keep the place clean
and then we paid for a snorkeling fee but
I think that included like a guy taking us
out so it took us to two sites and the first
one was just like um Turtle sea turtle yeah
loads of people there though just like surrounding
the poor Turtle I don't know if we knew exactly
what the snorkeling would entail I didn't
not necessarily know that it was that it was
kind of cool to see the turtle but we didn't
want to hang around for too long yeah but
then after he took us to see the turtle we
went a little bit further out and it was like
it was like a cliff underwater reef and then it was
just like yeah exactly it was like a cliff
it was just like boom Darkness it was so scary
it was actually kind of cool but as soon as
as we got there someone was like free diving
pretty much all the way down to the bottom
honestly I saw this like kind of Shadow and
I was like that's a human down there I don't
know why I tried doing that I tried to do
something similar towards the end but I couldn't
get like half as deep with my face like everything
started going like you know when your eyes
and your ears started pop yeah like I wasn't
even halfway down oh he was probably trained
surely he was trained yeah now we've dropped
off our snorkels and goggles our life vests
are back at the boat this is way too hot to
sip it now so yeah we got coffee anyway we've
got some coffee it's still really early in
the morning we got a new camera the other
day because we were planning on doing some
stuff in the water like this and yesterday
we realized we didn't have a floaty thing
so about 8 P.M yesterday we went on a massive
Mission around Panglao which is not a very
big place but it's a big island but the touristy
place is only literally in like one corner
not that many shops yeah so yeah we went around
for ages to about five shops and the end we
found one guy selling like exactly what we
needed phone cases and floaties and this was
only 150 pesos yeah yeah we also bought this
towel because turns out the hotel doesn't
allow towels to be taken off the grounds and
we don't have towels and we don't we obviously
don't travel around with our massive backpacks
with towels inside so we had to buy the towel
but it's quite cute cheers it's hot though
yeah it is
this is our first coffee of the morning even
though we've been up for hours already I don't
even know what time it is no maybe eight it's
so nice yeah I'm surprised we actually got
to see so much fish and turtles really yeah
because it's not that clear of a day but the
water is so clear crystal clear actually so
beautiful right next stop Virgin Island
This sand bar is called Virgin Island does have an actual
name Island I think it is the sandbar is basically
just a piece of land in the middle of the
ocean because there's lots of sand yeah pretty
cool I would assume that when it's high tide
it's not here or is it always here that's
a good question it's super fun anyway there's
like a tiny little kiosk which almost looks
like a bus stop but that floats so if this
does submerge that would still be bubbling
about yeah there's a couple of trees or mangroves
sticking out it's a few tourists here obviously
because it's a very much a tourist spot yeah
so the tour we're on is an island hopping
tour and this is yeah
pretty cool to think they were just in the
middle of the ocean yeah this is very much
like kind of Jack Sparrow on a deserted island
kind of Island yeah except that there's no
palm trees on it and definitely no rum
[Music]
thank you very much bye
oh oh my god oh deep that's why I made a little
yelp. didn't expect that to be as deep as it is
so it's about 11 o'clock in the morning now
and we're gonna go ahead nine o'clock in the
morning look no at 11 o'clock in the morning
and tuk-tuk Driver should be here because
that now we're gonna show you somewhere we
had food the other day and it was fantastic
Filipino food no but it's still fantastic
like if you're ever in Panglao or Bohol
you should come to this restaurant we haven't
had breakfast yet it's still early normally
we would have eaten something at this point
but there wasn't really any food and we've
had a coffee now on one of the islands so
perfect time you good yeah so head back in
and have something to eat yeah yeah
these flip-flops that I've got these are also
new that I bought in the Philippines so we
bought these flip-flops that floaty a towel
and I feel like the merchants they don't like
inflate the prices I feel like like these
flip-flops obviously not genuine were like
three pounds for just things you wear every
now and then when it's wet they're like if
you went to Beachside I don't know Spain for
example and you want to buy some flip-flops
on the beach surely they would not be three
pounds no Edgar is here to pick us up I
think oh good old Edgar yes you know maybe
we'll um ask Edgar if he can take us to like
the main island of Bohol tomorrow that's
a good idea yeah that's a good idea we should
ask the hotel if we can book him for the week
yeah totally would if we needed it but maybe
we should get a bike once we get to Main bohol
yeah hello
thank you enjoy yeah it was so much fun you
know the restaurant toto e pepino can we stop there yeah
yeah okay thank you
Two calamansi, cold. and then one half Margarita half pepperoni
pizza please
calamansi juice is so good especially with extra sugar
sour, sweet
enjoy thank you
so as you will have seen we have come to a
sort of Italian Pizza restaurant called Toto e pepino
I was thinking of pepperoni anyway we came
here on our first night and pizza was just
fantastic you know like proper Italian the
base super crispy the crust is just enough
and you can eat it it's we just had to come
back and if you are in Panglao seriously
you have to visit it's about a five minute
walk from our hotel as well right in the heart
of Alona Beach I'm just sat here with my one
slice of pizza waiting can I eat it
we're gonna devour this pizza now go back
home have about five different naps and then
we'll see you in the next video thanks bye
