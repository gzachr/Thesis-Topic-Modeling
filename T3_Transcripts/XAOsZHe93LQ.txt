 This is what I got today from the local store. Little snack. My little snack. They have in the food. They're all having the food. What's going on, y'all? We back again with another video. It's day one of Vlogmas, so we're going to be showing content every other day, every other day until the 25th of December. It should be about like 12 or something episodes until Christmas you guys. I hope you're ready. I hope you're excited. That's going to be so much fun. Yeah, guys, so we got to go to Mercury Drug. They get some medicine facility. It's basically like a CVS in the States or like a Walgreens. So we're going to go there first. Then what, 7-11? We can check 7-11 to see if they have her water. Yeah, I'm just going to go to the room. I just felt the rain drop and then I hope I don't start raining while we are here. We're actually not getting her medicine. We're picking up her vitamins because she takes daily vitamins, you guys. So they're from Mercury Drug not too far from where we live. They're actually everywhere in the Philippines. They are all right. We're going there. It's a lot going on out here. It's a stain around the corner. We went to the other day. They got like, can't elope juice. We might go there right now because it was really good. We got in the last vlog, you guys. We got in the last vlog and it was chef's kiss. Yeah. It's really nice out right now though. You guys are not actually too hot. Usually it's so hot. It's like unbearable but it's just human out here right now. Yeah, it feels fine right now. Yeah. City vibes for you. Hopefully we don't get lost trying to find this Mercury drug. We're not going to get lost bro. I only seen it once. I haven't even been to it. Yeah, that's what I'm coming for. No, we'll see if we find it. I'm good with directions. It's only around the corner from our house. She'll get lost going around the corner. Look at the dog. He's so cute. You know what? We could even try this coffee for the first time. There's another coffee shop nearby. That was a foul. Oh, no I'm good. I don't want to try that coffee please. You want to get the one that I like. It's only one coffee place I like near our house. I didn't even drink coffee like that before I came to the Philippines. The only coffee I really drunk was like, don't get donuts. And I only drink that because it's sweet. Basically the flavor but now I'm a real coffee drinker. This is the... It's the coffee. The blue. I don't want to try it. I'm scared to try it. They're selling bananas over there if you want to guess them. I don't want the lady to over there to the right. What the one there for chicken for your mom? No, I never met her. It's my mom's other friend. This is my mom's time. Thank you. My mom has another friend. I think she's somewhere around here. She's really pretty. She's so pretty. She's so pretty. She's so pretty. She's so pretty. I don't want to get in there. Hello? She's the poor one by the bus. Hello. Hello. Hello. What else do you want, Khal? Khal. Maybe I'll be hungry. I can't wait for my meal. This one's good. Looks like it's good. This is what I got today from the local store. These are my mom's favorite banana. She's spoiled them. And then I just got three onions because we use onions a lot. But I only found 130 people who got it. So what is that like less than $3? That's like $2. All right, come on let's go. This street is so busy you guys. They're only so busy. Oh, we're so busy. Yeah. If you can see it's super super loud, there's so many people so much going on. But it's actually kind of fun. I kind of like it. City vibes video. Yeah, right there. We can go to wassons instead right? Well, I don't think they have her vitamins. It's a fun commercial drug. Do you know where it is? I was talking about wassons. Oh my gosh. That's why I was like I hope we don't get lost you guys. You guys can see they might have it. But not every wassons, I don't think so. Okay, let's go to wassons. The first in the street here is Hecklick sometimes. But right now we've got lucky. What? We can try it after we put the wassons. We'll look for the side of the window. We're over there. So now we've got to go on the wassons. Thank you. Hello. Let's see if they have a window. We're in wassons. I hope they have it so they can have to go. So she's behind there. So the vitamins they've gone behind the counter. These are nice wassons. I don't think every wassons has a hole on pharmacy. And this is walking distance. We could have been coming here. It's a lot of stories. This is from us. So now we've got to go on green witch. It's a piece of spot around here. We've got to try it out for our first time. I can't believe it. I can't believe it.
