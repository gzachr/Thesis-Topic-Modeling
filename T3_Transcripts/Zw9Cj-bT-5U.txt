Wow!
WOAH!
Look at that.
Good afternoon, guys.
Today I'm still in Manila.
It's my 10th day.
And I'm in this neighborhood called Tondo
What’s up brother?
which is supposed to be,
I guess, the rougher part of town.
I've been here before.
And it's not been scary
or anything like some people say.
The only thing is you do see a lot of
inequality 
like you see in the city of Manila.
So you see some poor people
begging for money sometimes.
I hope you guys can hear me. This is so loud.
I just took like a Grab
from Makati to here, which took an hour.
And it costs like more than 500 pesos,
which is a lot.
Which is I think, 
more than what I'll be spending
on street food the whole day.
And which is why I'm here.
There's this place called
Sorry.
Ugbo Street, which is supposed to have
some really good street food.
And was recommended by my good friend 
Luke Damant.
And...
-Vlogger!
-Hello.
Vlogger, yes.
-Hi.
Hi.
And the reason I took a Grab is 
usually I take a JoyRide,
which is like another app
that we have a scooter which is faster,
and which is like way cheaper.
It can go for like 170 pesos when I saw,
but it just wasn't showing up.
So I just called the Grab and got in it
because it is already like 4:30 p.m.
and it’s going to get dark
like in the next hour or so.
And the GoPro is like not the best in
recording in low light.
So I just wanted to like,
get here as fast as I possibly could.
What’s up, bro?
So now I am in Tondo and I think 
the street food place should be right ahead of me.
Yeah, I actually see like,
a lot of street food carts right there.
I see some good old full court basketball.
What’s up, brother?
Kamusta ka? (How are you?)
Can I see it?
You know I used to play basketball,
when I was a kid.
Like that's all I did back in the day.
Should I go shoot? No.
I don't want to do this with a backpack.
What's your names?
-Generio.
What was that?
-Generio.
Generio?
Ok. And yours?
-Gankol.
-Gankol.
Gankol?
Okay. Nice to meet you, bro.
-Nice to meet you.
Man, I want to like to shoot.
Oh man, that was bad.
Okay, no one saw that.
-Go for one more.
One more, ok.
Fast-break.
Dunk it,.
-Do you play basketball? 
I used to. I used to, like back in the day.
Aww shiiit.
-Shoot, shoot.
I hope I got that.
See, the second time's a charm.
The second shot went in.
Alright.
Thank you, guys.
See you.
I used to
love playing basketball.
That's all I did
for a big part of my life.
Unfortunately, it's not what I do anymore..
Okay, so here we have Grilled Spicy Balut,
And this is like...
Oh, you're not cooking yet, right?
But this is very interesting food. It's like...
Balut is quail, right? Or what kind of bird is it? 
-Yeah. 
Okay.
You see the half like boiled
baby bird inside it and it's like, crazy.
Like, I am adventurous with food,
but I don't think I'm that adventurous.
Kamusta Ka?
-Hi
-Hey, sir. 
Hello.
But I think the main street food place is
like one more minute
walking distance that way.
So hopefully I'm going to get 
like some good food today.
I am hungry but I want to 
try out different kinds of food.
So instead of like trying different solid meals,
I think I'll just have snacks here & there.
Oppa foods.
This is Korean food.
-Yes Po.
Okay.
-Korean food
Fish cake.
Fish cake.
Corndogs
Kimchi.
Hello
This is...
Hello.
What is this? Is this sweet.
This is like sugar or...
-No, no, no. 
What?
-Seafood. 
Seafood.
-Salmon egg. 
Salmon egg.
I don't really eat fish but... 
Thank you. Salamat Po.
I don't know what I’ll eat less: balut or fish.
But like neither sound like my kind of food.
Which is, I know funny 
because I'm, you know,
in all these islands all the time 
with a lot of good seafood.
Some reason I just can't eat seafood that much.
But not to worry, there's a lot of other good food here
except for seafood. So we'll be fine.
Look at all these stalls.
Like there's like so many of them.
Cheese bomb.
Crabs.
Shwarma.
Hello brother.
Kamusta Ka Kuya
So this is just Shwarma.
So they just cook it.
Ok.
-Would you like to take one?
Not right now.
I'm just... first I'm just like looking.
How much is it like for?
-This is Large.
Large. Ok.
-This one is 100 pesos.
-Jumbo is 120 pesos.
Ok. Maybe I'll come back 
and get a shawarma later.
But let me like, look at the rest.
Is this the Ugbo Street Food...
-Yes Po.
Okay. I feel like I've come a bit early.
I was worried there wouldn't be enough daylight,
but I think this might be more of a...
night food place because a lot of these places look like
they're just like setting up shop right now.
Fresh mango shake.
This is a bit more pricey.
More seafood.
Mukbang seafood.
You see, they're like cooking it right here
on a pan.
Kamusta Ka Kuya
That's what I like about street food.
You see it cook like right in front of you.
Sorry.
-Sticker.
Sticker?
-Yeah.
What does that mean?
What? Oh, sticker.
What is that like?
-You have a sticker?
I don't have a sticker. No, no.
I should get a sticker like that.
Thank you.
Salamat Po.
Oh, what is this?
Master fruit shake.
-Yes, how may I help? 
How much is the lychee fruit shake?
-80 pesos.
80 pesos?
Can I... Can I have a lychee fruit shake?
It’s strawberry.
Sorry.
-It’s strawberry.
Lychee or...
-Strawberry.
Strawberry? Ok. Ok. Sorry. Yeah, strawberry.
I am not good at recognizing fruits.
Can we see how it's made?
What's your name?
-Kalim.
Kalim. Ok.
Nice to meet you.
So she picks the strawberries right out of here. 
It's in the blender.
Ooh, What was that?
Is that like...
-Cheese
Cheese. Ok.
So this is strawberry cheese.
And that's sugar. Brown sugar, right?
I was not expecting cheese to be a part of this.
I'm not going to lie.
Oh, is this milk?
Some very...
Is that milk or syrup? What is that?
-Condensed milk.
Condensed milk. Okay.
Get every last bit.
And use a lot of ice and shove it all in.
Plug in the blender.
That looks so good.
That is a lot more than what I expected.
Salamat Po.
-Thank you Po.
Thank you.
You can keep the change. It’s ok.
It's okay. You can keep it. Thank you.
This is much bigger than what I expected.
So what are we going to do is 
like, drink a little bit of it.
What is that?
Let’s try to shake first?
Creamy strawberry shake.
This is amazing.
This is really good.
Thank you.
Salamat Po.
I don't want to get greedy, though,
because like,
I have to eat other stuff.
So, I just put this
in my bag.
Oh, man.
Brain freeze.
Major brain freeze.
So cold, my head hurts.
Oh, man.
I'm getting like the biggest brain freeze ever.
Does this looks safe?
I don't know.
We'll find out in a bit if this stays or not.
Hello. How are you?
-Hello.
That was a brave move. I might be going back with milkshake
but I don't want to throw it away.
I can't eat all the cool stuff right now.
I wanna see what they're cooking over here.
Oh, is this octopus?
Or squid?
-Squid.

Okay, I'll eat that at the end.
So, like, I have some snacks and that I have space.

Look at that.
I'm from Bangladesh.
-Wow!

A lot of noodles.
I'm going to go try to find some cheesy stuff

and I'll just take the rest for take-away, whatever I can.

It’s like the orange sauce we have.
Let's see how this is.
It’s a bit dry.
- (Foreign language)
-How it tastes?
-I told you. It’s very tasty.
This is really good.
This is actually tastes a lot like
Shwarma in Bangladesh where I eat it.
It's more dry
but it's still like pretty nice
It's not spicy which has been my experience with everything 
that's supposed to be spicy in Manila so far.
It's not spicy to me at least.
Might be spicy to like some of you,
but not so much to me.
We have our own audience here, like...
very focused.
So it’s funny for me,
when I'm looking into the camera,
I'm like looking at these two kids.
They're standing behind the camera.

Kept it on the side of the bag.
The safer place to put it.
I'm still pretty hungry, but I want to eat the squid.
I don't want to, like, eat the squid

And what's this? Is this like chilli?
It’s chilli, soy sauce and Calamansi.
Calamansi?
-Yeah.
Okay?
-Would you like some soup?
I think this is enough.
-Ok.
No, no, I think I don't like shrimp so much.
Now, I’ll try without shrimp.
You don’t want some?
Do you want some shrimp, Paulo?
or squid. Sorry.
Oh, man, I'm going to make a mess.
I can tell I'm going to make a mess.
Okay.
So I’ll take like, this squid.
Mix some rice inside it.
I don't know what the right way to eat with your hands is here.
I'm just doing it the way Bangladeshis do it.
This is really good.
No, I like it.
This is really good.
You want some, Paolo?
It's amazing.
Do you know where Paolo is now?
He is right behind the camera.
Is this common Filipino food?
What's the Tagalog name for it?
Like in Filipino.
What do you call it? The name.
-This we call pusit.
Pusit? Ok. Ok.
This is as good as chicken.
Paulo is my director now. He's like holding 
the camera and fixing it for me.
We have a new director.
There you go.
Oh, he's like, literally making sure I'm in frame.
Man. This is amazing.

Hello.
