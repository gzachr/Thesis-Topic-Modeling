 Is that your mega hit? Wow. Never look better. Whoa, they are double parked. Somebody used a ticket that time. Are you hitting me right now? No. Okay, we are here at the ferry. You get one of these when you are out there. And then you get a health declaration form. You have your vaccine card. And then you can go to Garamon Island. So without the vaccine card, you can't go over there. But it's a basic form that you have to fill in. Provided by the government. Just like on Burakai, there is, if whatever sticker they give you is the boat you will be get on. It costs 30 pesos per person to get on the boat. We are excited. Finally going to have some of this fresh mangoes everybody talks about. All right, papers filled out. Then you go and you fill in some more paperwork on a clipboard here. And then they will let you into the boat. And then you can go into the boat. And then you can go into the boat. And then you can go into the boat. And then you can go in there. And then you can go in there very far. It's just right over there. All right, so I'm going to provide a little bit of a correction from what we said earlier. So only foreign-born people are required to have vaccine cards. So the locals were not asked. They were anybody born in the Philippines. They were not. So just us and the Koreans that were with us. Yeah. They were the only ones that had to provide. So if you are a Filipino, don't worry. You don't need anything. You just come in here off to go. It was 30 pesos right now. But it says it's like a summer special, student summer special sort of thing. So I don't know if it's normally 50. But yeah, we got to tell you though. It was really neat because you don't see a lot of palm trees here. You see a lot of mangroves. You see a lot of vegetation that you would kind of see in more northern climates. Right. And it's really, really beautiful. And it's just because it's unique and a little bit different, right? No, we're just going to walk around. Yeah, we're going to do a little tour first. Then we'll come back. Thank you. Jordan Proper. That's what somebody had told me last night on Facebook because it's a municipality of Jordan. And so when you first land, you get in this one little spot here. But they have different shops and I've heard there's a lot of mango products that you can get right here in one spot as opposed to a resort or something like that. We're here. There's many, many businesses in one area. So we're going to take a look around. Oh, it looks like sky red. Look at that. The things that you feel like pilfer through. There you go. Find some treasures. Yeah, so I think these boats have seen better days. Just say the least. One or two. Yeah, it is very, very pretty here. We found a little goat here. So she's really excited. Can I pet it? I don't know. Is that a rule? Have you ever said that before? I don't know. It's like a BGC. It's not a real quest. It's something BGC. We don't pet cats. Oh, yes. First time. We can. Look at that. Look how it's staring at me as I was talking about cats. Okay. There's always animals involved in our logs, yes. Oh, always animals. Yeah, well first. Hello, baby. Hello. Hi. Oh, my God. Yes. Hi, go. What the heck? Look at him. Look at him. He's like, he has a rugby. I was eating grass, but this is better. Yes, you're good. You're so good. You're the goodest. Oh, my gosh. I'm so lucky. This trip is already being amazing. That's it, guys. Okay, let's go. Let's go. If we were to review the island, it would already be a top score for sure. Let's just move here. Okay. Let's walk along these banks here. Making our way up. Most people just take a track by now, but we're still exploring. Look at that guy. Look at him jump. What the heck is that? Anybody know? They're walking fish. Yeah, they're like walking fish. Yo, evolution. What's up, bro? Oh, my God. They're actually sticking to like the rocks and stuff. Yeah, they're like catfish. Yeah, no, they match too well. Oh, yeah. So if you want to explore, you gotta explore. Don't just go where the tourists are going. Hello, everybody. Good morning. That's where you find all the fun. We've got to talk to several people. Oh, yeah. Look at they've got all the water dammed up over here. I'm going to go in the sun for a second. It's 9am, by the way. They've got the water all dammed up in different areas. And I don't know if it's because they're like fish ponds. And that's why. And so they just dam up parts of the river and feed it in. Yeah. Cause this one's flowing. Yeah, this is the parking lot. Somebody's parked their cow. Of course you do. Hello, cow. Whoa, they are double parked. Somebody used a ticket that cow. We love animals. So bring them on. Almost into the town now. You guys all I am. Look at this architecture. Isn't that beautiful? He's a little big, but you know what? It's so big. Yeah, it's very beautiful. Now, if you're looking for a fixer upper, I think we found you one. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I think so. I think we found you one. Open concept. Open concept. Yeah, but look at how colorful those tiles are and everything. I bet you looked really beautiful one day. Once upon a time. Hello. We are here at the Gameris Mountain Resort. We want to do a little bit of exploring in the beginning. Just to get a feel of the local life, that kind of thing. But then we wanted to try a resort. Now, Gameris is a much bigger island. Yeah, it's quite big. It's quite massive compared to Florida. Right. So I... So the beach resorts are like 45-minute drive each way. So we don't really want to do that. Let's try something a little closer because we have a lot of plans for today. So here we are. And this place is gorgeous. And so far we are not disappointed at all. And so the entrance is so beautiful. It sure is. I mean, it sets a good start. Yep. Let's go on in. And just look. Look at this. This is the restaurant here. Very well shaded. The buildings are much cooler. And they are far over here. Oh, they got a whole kids' play area up there. And then we have... That's where we have these beautiful pools over here. So we are going to be hanging out here, enjoying ourselves. Having a good time. So our first impressions of the island. Very lush. Streamly lush island. So much shade. And less palm trees than other trees. Which I really do help with the shade a lot. So it has that different feel. Like a mountain type feel. Really beautiful here. You'll notice that they also have a highway running right through. With two lanes on each side. And it's really smooth, clean. Really beautiful island so far. Here at the resort. It's only 150 pesos per head to use the pool. If you want, you can sit here in the restaurant. And you can use the pool. And there's no extra charge other than the 150. Obviously they want you to eat and drink. But you do have to, you know, get dressed back before coming here. Even if you're wet, she said that's fine. Just cover up like men can't be topless. Or you can get the small little huts here for 250 pesos. They have the larger ones. Here for 800 pesos. And then the really big one for 1000 pesos. And you can rent that for the day. So if you have a family and you want to all have lunch together, that type of thing, that is available. Of course there's overnight cottages as well. But these are the daily ones. And for lunch we got some pork barbecue and some garlic rice. A lot of garlic rice. That's too much garlic. That's the rice. That's why. We found it. We found all the rice. It's going to be good. Garlic rice is yummy. But yeah, pork barbecue, mix it in. Good meal. Of course, the mango festival is all over now. And so the options of buying mango items here are very limited now. So this is a mango pandam. We had no other choice. This was the only mango dessert. It has a little like you're just... It looks a lot like it. Roll it back. And it looks delicious though. I'm excited to try something the ice cream. Oh yeah. It's good. Although, ready? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Did you just take the cherry? I just popped it, sorry. Oh. Are you kidding me right now? Look at this. Look what he just did. The less. The audacity. Oh, there's a piece of mango. I got a piece of mango. Sorry. Look at this. He's looking at everywhere. Don't take him out the dinner. It's okay. You love mango. The ice cream is frozen though. So I can't even like nicely scoop it. This ice cream is frozen. It's made for an entire family. And they don't have a smaller size. Who's coming over? If you're trying to cry. So who's coming over? Who's coming over to eat? I'm sure I got that. Excellent. So like a hollow hollow except... ...tunks of mango. Really delicious. Green jelly. A hollow hollow. I think I ate all the mango though already. Sorry. Yeah, oh somebody else might be guilty. Just saying. We eat more rice so we're still eating. We gotta love that rice. And of course we get them mango juice. And mango juice, firstly squeezed. And we make a beer mango float. With this. And this is what it looks like. And it tastes delicious. We're gonna start a new trend here. In ilo ilo anguimeras. For weddings, birthday parties and other events. You can book these halls here. Which are really beautiful. And you know, just walk across. The children can play here. And it's just on the other side. What do you normally love that? Stingray. Yeah, look at these guys. Not the back guy. He's cool but come on. Look at it. He's like yo, get my good side. Wow. That's quite the fish tank. I tell you. How would you be able to eat all of them? I don't think it is just for sure. Don't think you can order an eapum. I would order an eapum. I feel like everything has a price. If I wanted to eat them, I could. Alright, alright. That was a good time. But it's time for us to head back. We have some subscribers meeting us at the Esplanade later today. So we got our gift back to the mainland. It is a really, really beautiful island. You know, gorgeous lush. Oh yeah, we have a perfect day too. Wow. Yeah, highly recommend. It's a good vacation destination. Totally. I wouldn't live on it only because you have to take a boat to get anything other than a story, so we could sell you. But otherwise, very beautiful. Very, very beautiful. Here we are at the port. You get your tickets. You can grab your tourist things here. And of course, they got a story, story. Oh, it's a beautiful, beautiful island. You would love it. Hello. I wasn't even pointing at you. Now I am. This is the most fun port ever. Just saying, everybody's wonderful. I took it by a bottle of water. Yeah, please. My way of change also for the ferry. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You go by mushrooms here. I don't think they're the same mushrooms they sell in Canada. It's the same. The picture. All right, we're taking a picture. There you go. Good to be in the video. There you go. Good to be in the video. Oh, there's so much fun here at this port. I like the port. Gomeris. The best. There you go. You want to fight them? Yeah. I said they don't want to picture you. Where are they? They might bother. Yeah, get a picture of the better. They watch our vlogs. Very cool. Is that your mango face? Wow. Never look better. Never look better. Huh. Okay, go with this side. There we go. There we go. Okay, they're waiting for us. Okay, we're going to take number five. We're going to take number five. Not worried too much about the number. Oh. Almost fed the fish. Not as many coming back. There's a risk going there. They're going back. Sure. Maybe a little... A little like that? Yeah. Well, well, well. Which do you think of the island? I really like it because there's so much shade. It's so different from other like like on bar guy. No shade. Okay, here walking here in the sun. So it's really nice to have shade and it's so lush. It's crazy. Like there's so much forest area. If you really have it fun to hike through and like explore. Oh yeah, definitely. Yeah, if you have time, you could definitely let me know. And obviously you have to come during the mango festival. Because that's when you're going to find the most mangoes. And a lot of people here to buy them, which is a flying demand. That will be a ton of them. So yeah, we still really loved it very much. We'll definitely have to come back for a mango festival, which I believe is the middle of May. But for now, we had a wonderful little trip. And yeah, we're so glad we came. We'll see you all the next time. Bye bye.
