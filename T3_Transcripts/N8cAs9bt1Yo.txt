 What are they doing? They're fishing. I thought they were netting the river. I thought they had a net inside the river, but they're... It looks like they're current fishing with small hooks and a stick. I'm not sure. I think that's what they're doing. Looks like they're like fly fishing with sticks. And they will do it on it. We're using the small fish as bait. I don't know. How are we going to find that? I'm going to catch them. I'm going to catch them. I'm going to catch them. I'm going to catch them. I'm going to catch them. I'm going to catch them. I'm going to catch them. I'm going to catch them. I'm going to catch them. I'm going to catch them. I'm going to catch them. I'm going to catch them. I'm going to catch them. I'm going to catch them. I'm going to catch them. I'm going to. I'm going to catch them. They are flying. It's so much... It's so cool seeing the people just fish from the middle of the channel with them growivers onto the shore and catching them. You did it!

There's something truly refreshing about seeing people find joy in the small things in life, like gathering with friends and family to fish with improvised rods. Sharing each other is a happiness as they catch small fish. It's a reminder that sometimes the most meaningful experiences in life come not from material possessions or grand achievements, but from the connections we make with one another and the simple pleasures we can find in our surroundings. Thank you for watching and until next time, thank you.
