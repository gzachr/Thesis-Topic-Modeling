 Ha, how are you? Ma buti, ikaw fuk. Wow, you're speaking Tagalog. Just little. I just know, makantanumaga, komustaka. Magantan hapoon, magantan gawi. That's the common greeting. Salamat, rollang anuman. So, but we will move on some other Tagalog words. Why do you want to learn Tagalog? I read your feedback and I saw that you are learning Spanish. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, this Spanish because Tagalog, the Filipino words, is very from Spanish. Most of our words, it has really related to the Spanish. Exactly. Because we have hundreds of dialects in Filipino things. So, basically, when you say Tagalog, because we only have 20 alphabet. And when you say Filipino, we have 28. So, the eighth letters is really, we call that, Hiram na letra. So, we borrow eight from the foreign that includes any ex-Z. So, I am older than you. So, I am your Ate. I am 35. So, kuyya, basically, that's what we call older brother. And Ate, older woman, older women. But in, okay, what about father? You know, how do we call father in Tagalog? Tatai. Tatai, very good. It's nice. What about mother? Mother, maybe Nana. Grandmother. No, I don't know the grandmother. Okay, that is Lola. Lola. Okay, so grandmother is Lola. And then grandfather is Lolo. Ah, Lolo. Okay. What about ankle? You know, what's, we call the ankle in, ankle at, I don't know, it's, it's Tito and Tita. Tito would be an ankle and then auntie would be Tita. So, have you heard saying, I have you heard saying, Mabuhay in Filipino? Mabuhay, I just heard on that video, the meaning of a gun. Mabuhay. It's, it's, it's basically saying hello or long leave. Mabuhay, because it's long leave, the legality. Literally. From Philippines. Because only Philippines say Mabuhay. Ah, okay. That is long leave. Okay, so. Okay, what else? Uh-huh. Our Merry Christmas. You know what's Merry Christmas? Yeah. Maligayang pasko. Wow, that's kind of difficult. What? Maligay? Maligaya. Maligaya. Maligaya. Great. Maligayang pasko. The Christmas is pasko. Pasko? Like that? Yes. Very good. So, Merry, because it is happy, right? Merry and English is happy. So, in Tagalog, that is Ligaya. Okay, Ligaya is happy. Yeah, Maligaya. Ah, Maligaya. Yes. Maligaya. Happy, Merry or Yain? Maligaya. And then Christmas is pasko. Pasko, okay. Okay. And then we say condolences. How you say condolences? I don't know. It's Naki Kira Mai ako. What? Naki Kira Mai ako. And then congratulations. How you will sing. You know what? How integral of congratulations with this integral? Congratulations. It's Bina Bati kita. Ah, what? B. Okay, Bina Bati. Bina. Bati. Bina Bati. Bina Bati. Yeah. Okay, that's it. That's Bina Bati kita. And then thank you. Salamat. Salamat. And then you're welcome. Walang Anuman. Walang Anuman. Okay, very good. Oh, how can I say come here? Ah, no. That is Halika Dito. Ha, as an age. Halika Dito. Okay, how will you say wait in Tagalog? It's wait. You know, wait is that the integral is sandali. Sandali lang. Sandali. Sandali. Sandali. Sandali. Yeah. Like that? Yeah. You're so good. That's it. Sandali. Okay, so that is wait. But you know, if you heard saying them with lang. Yeah, it basically that's the common way how we say wait with lang. So when we say like this. Like this is ganito. Ganito. Like that? Yeah, that's it. Like this. That's ganito. Okay. Okay, you are Halika Dito. Sandali lang. Dali ganito. Oh, you're right. Okay, later I will I will ask you again. Okay. Yeah. Let's forget all this. Okay, let's see if how how good is your memory. Okay, that is, that is, ganito. I will say it in Tagalog then. You say it in English. If you remember that. Okay, so when we say it should be like this. Ganito. Dapat. Ganito. Dapat. Yeah, canina deba like this is ganito. Like this. Like this. Ganito. But when we say it should be like this. We will just add Dapat. Ganito. Dapat. That's it. Dapat. How I Dapat. Like that. Yes. So you you add ganito and then Dapat. Ganito. It should be like this. Yeah, that is it should be like this. Ganito. Dapat. Okay, and then. Like this is ganito. When we say like that. Ganyan. It's the same. Ah, ganyan. Oh, different. Not like a Spanish only in a Spanish is just like. Like this like that is just. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah, it's why. Because if you're saying this is. You are really referring near to you, Dapat. Yeah, exactly. That you are something you're pointing somewhere else. Yeah, so that is ganyan. So there's a difference. Oh, I don't have to any. Ganyan. No, no, no, you change a gun and then why. Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, remember. Ganyan like that. Okay, yeah. Oh, sorry. No, I remember. Like that, right? Yeah, that's it. Yeah, I've heard that only using in names. Name and place, right? Yeah, me too. I don't know where to type any in laptop. Yeah, keyboard. Oh, better yet. He used why because these sounds sounds. Like, no, man. That that makes that gives. To do it and the motive it to do it so that you can. You can become so if you are going to communicate with the. Filipino people, it would not be so hard because. Filipino people speak English like that. Yeah, exactly. So. You will learn the guy look. If you hear the guy, you know, I'm not going to say that. You will learn the guy look. If you hear the words every day, if you hear the words constantly. So when you are with. Okay, now. So I'll say in Tagalog. I will say the word in Tagalog. You will say it in English. Let's see if you remember it. Okay, so I will say. Halika Dito. What's that in English? I know it's that it's come here. Oh, sorry. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. I have heard of. Kiss me sounds like. Okay, Halikan or Halik. The road where this Halik. Then come here and what is that connection? That would be the that would be some. The problem of the Filipino. The Filipino language. It's really far when you say Halika. It's really saying come here. When you say Halik, that's literally meaning kiss. And Halikan, you kiss. I mean, you're doing the kissing some or kissing thing. That's it's Halikan. The Halik, it's the kiss itself. Halika Dito, it has nothing to do with the kiss. It's just say come here. Okay, so the Congress. It's been a bad day. It's been a bad day. It's been a bad day. Okay, when I say son, the Lee. I reached. The lenses is not key. I'm. I'm. I'm. What about this one? I will say, the Lee. I did not say paladiano. It's hurry up. Sorry, sorry. I skipped that one. Hurry up is the. The Lee. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. It's ha. It's saying hurry up. The Lee or the Lee and the Lee it's the Lee it's already considered. Yeah. Okay. If I will say, what is in English, what? Yeah, just. Just. Like that. Like that. Okay, like that. Okay, so yeah. Okay, that's it's okay. I just. Because if I will, I show you how you will think. Okay, yeah, you have to scrutinize your mind. What's that? Okay, share my mind. Okay, so what is Merry Christmas? It's Maliga yang pasko. Sorry, say. Okay, it's okay. Okay, now I'll go to. Okay, so I'll go with this. Okay, when we say, you know what's aso? So no, it's dog. Dog. Okay, it's a dog. Okay, so. So like that, right? Yes, that is. So you will, you will read it as in telegong. Later by layer. So. So this one is. Pusa right? Yeah, what about this one? Baka. Baka is a, I think, I think is a cow. Very good that this cow. It's very similar to Spanish. Okay, I think this one also. Baka is like that. But when I say, Baka. Little different. Baka. Baka that the faster one would be it might. It might. I got it. It's we call that tul dig in Philippine. But you don't use it, right? Like a Spanish. No, not really. So if I will look this. Baka, I will just read along the, along the sentence. So I will, I will already know if it is referring to animal or. To the impression of it might or are not sure. Okay. So in my class, because I am a teacher. Yeah, it might. So it means you're not sure in my class. So I will show you that. Yeah, you are referring with the. Tultique we, we call that. Tultique so that you know where to stress. The sound. Yeah. Okay, so if you are going to stress on the beginning of the. A vowel or at the end of the vowel. So it might be slash it might be it's like. Parang paka upia shang ganon. Parang. It's it's it's. Any. Any. Any. Any. I'll just read between the lines and I'll get it if it's about. If it is referring to animal or the other way around. So this one basso you know what's basso this is. I think, glass. Yeah, that's a glass. What about that, right? In. The galok, right? Yeah, yeah, that's correct. But within. Spanish like that. A, so it's more on B using V. Ya. Even there is another way, it's like comma. Kama. Oh, it is fine. This one is I will go into Astu. Like that. Actually in my screen, the next word that I'm showing you is comma. Really?
