[Music]
welcome back to my youtube channel today
i will watch
seven filipino values we should be proud
of
today i chose this video because i
wanted to
show this video to my countrymen
who don't know well about philippines so
this video will help to my countrymen to
understand
filipinos culture personality kind of
that so that's why today i choose this
video
and then even if now i speak english
after finish edit i will try to use
youtube subtitle system so i will try to
edit korean
subtitle in this video to spread
my countrymen so now let's go together
okay let's go
every country has different values and
stereotypes
yes that is true every country have a
different values
of course our country the philippines
has no exception
we filipinos believe that we have
perhaps one of the best values in the
world
it is kind of festival parade videos
right
came from our ancestors
this is talates right they just tolerate
this
right bring them even up to this day
filipinos are not perfect but we have
great characteristics and qualities
that we pinoys should be proud of yes
so here are seven filipino values we
should be proud of value number one
is hospitality hospitality one of the
most popular qualities of filipinos is
being hospitable
foreigners love this warm hospitality
and not just foreigners
maybe foreigner feels like very
hospitality to philippines and then
filipinos cause
their faces is usually smile faces and
then
that's why they feel hospitality to
philippines
i guess filipinos had held high with
this positive trait
yes
that is buddha fighting right value is
freedom and love of country
filipinos are freedom loving people they
can sacrifice
everything this is shinola festival
right
i think this is shinola festival videos
freedom's name for them freedomless life
is a state of meaninglessness
for filipinos it doesn't matter whether
they are wounded
brutalized or salvaged as long as we can
preserve
our freedom then we will fight for it in
the name of our country
the philippines yes i also watched it
kind of dead videos before so i know
that
they are very hard to try to get freedom
[Music]
the third value that we have is religion
religions in general are god centered
and god conscious religious cultures
such as the black nazarene
fiestas honoring of our patrons and car
blessings and house blessings are just
some of the acts that we value religion
so much
yes catholic is the most biggest
religion in philippines right religious
catholic
[Music]
when i searched filipino trevor's spot
kind of dead
a lot of trevor spots show me like
catholic churches
so that is very impressive i think
the fourth value that we have is human
labor and work
self-development we filipinos value this
trait so much
because by working hard a person can
attain his desires
and fulfill his dreams from our
hard-working ofws
to our greatest and strongest laborers
yes
yes in korea also have a lot of ofw
so they did a lot of work hard and then
they send money to their families so
this
is very good to care their family and
their country also
so this is very good this is very proud
of point
you guys
the fifth value that we have is family
family asians were naturally
collectivists
and us filipinos are well known for our
family-centeredness
filipinos give so much value to the
family
that they labor so hard and sacrifice so
much for their family
the family that sauce goodness rips
fortune and the one that sauce
evil rips suffering
so yes so i i also think
when i see my friend my filipino friend
picture
inside instagram kind of that have a lot
of family pictures so that is also very
impressive
they care their family a lot so this
point
also to me that is very also impressive
the sixth value we have is personal
dignity
personal dignity is the most important
wealth on earth
worldly reaches can be bought but once
good character is lasting and priceless
we impose this value through different
self-improvement
and by showcasing different skills and
talents yes we can do everything
yes they do dance a lot and sing also a
lot
so it means they have a lot of fun
a lot of excited heart so that point
also very good and then also they have a
lot of talented so
they can do everything so yes
as a filipino
last and definitely not the least number
seven value
is human fellowship in human fellowship
filipinos are known to have good
relationship with each other
according to the ilocanos if you don't
like the person
you should not shame or embarrass him
man finds himself
a human being in relation to another
human being
oh this part i can't understand well so
oh if you guys can explain this part

this part is very difficult to
understand so
if you can do it leave a easy word

values we filipinos have
and there are hundreds of good
characteristics we can be proud of
