 But you're Friday. Differishing. My I love musicals. I love musical. Get down. Has come musical 2, 1 and 3. My favorite musicals of all time. Sorry that this set is different. The other ones I'm not gonna stretch at the moment. This is actually a sneak check for the new studio. But we're gonna check out TikToks from the Philippines that you guys keep sending us. Disney. Disney fucking edition. Yeah! If we don't see any Has come musical here, I will punch through this computer. You know, you're like, song goes, bed on it, bed on it, bed on it, bed on me. I don't even know what he says. I remember because we didn't speak English that much. In Venezuela when this movie came out. Well you didn't speak English. Alright. I don't know. True. And I was just watching. Watch what you're doing. You watch what you're doing. You watch what you're doing. Yeah, it's delicious. But let me also, we're performing at The One & Mix. We have some dates. First of October. VIP tickets have been sold out. So shout out to everyone buying tickets. But general admission is still available. I think last time there was like 10,000 people. Like in the last event. Yeah, we checked out and we were like, what? That's fucking a lot of people. So there's still tickets available for general admission. Just use this code here and you can get like five pounds off. Correct. And we will see you there. Oh, what song? I love her games. He's fantastic. He's fantastic. He's fantastic. Hello, baby. No. Papa. Papa. Toton. And then he makes it. Well, that's fucking me. He makes it. He goes from a temi-corro. Half a god. Whatever the fuck. He goes to Olympus. Yes. And then he chooses not to stay there. What a righteous, what a good man. We didn't want me in like, okay, let's take a time. He's like. Actually, it looks to be like. It's skinny. Wow, what a voice. Imagine if one of Hercules's power was just, you know, because I don't think he ever did a falsetto in the movie. You know, but he read you. I don't even imagine that guy with a fucking, but he's like, you know what, I said, fucking, I don't know. I can go to this. Well, the fact when he's a whistle note. Okay. When he sings that song in the movie, it's like lifting the rock. He gets his powers back. What a movie we have to watch after this, I mean. Okay, no, definitely. I agree. One point eight million views. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's so cute. He's also got his hand like in the piano. In the piano. Oh, it's a piano. Yeah, he's like trying to when he hits the key and shit. You're all suppressed down, little. Hit the note, baby. Hit the note. I don't know. I love how he held that last. How far out. Wow. Wow. The stab of it is always amazing, obviously, for obvious reasons. You know, it's fucking adorable. But it's also, I think it's an underrated way to sort of encourage your children to sing and let them be free. Because essentially, the more the more the freer you become with your voice, the journey towards singing becomes so much easier. And you become so much more cultural from what everyone tells us. It's like Filipino people are really welcoming. They're really warm, sort of similar. Like, you know, Latin people are, I think it has to do in South America because of the dancing culture. Physical touch is such a normality. And you really notice that it isn't fucking normal when you're in Europe. Correct. It's actually so distant and cold. It becomes quite relevant. To a lot of Latin motherfuckers become depressed. Because you're like, oh my god, what the? Where's the warmth in the people? But then it seems like in the Philippines, the warmth comes from the intimacy of singing. It's what they shared. It's such a vulnerable thing to do, though. Right. I think the bonding comes naturally because the expression of singing is such a human thing. It's so vulnerable. It puts you at such an exposing position. And a lot of people that struggle with perhaps confidence or confidence builder. It's fantastic. And obviously it's such a judgement free environment that it really allows you to settle into whatever you want to do next. And dance is pretty big in the Philippines as well. Yeah, correct. So best of both. Big party culture. Come on! What is this? Oh my god! So beautiful! I love the galopo. Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh my god, how wonderful is this? You're like a ghost, pomsolo. You're like a ghost, pomsolo. I'm a madman. Was her name? That is freaking wonderful. That's hands down the best video, fucking. I don't even know what we're checking out next. That's the best video we've seen. That's from the... What is that sleeping beauty? I think so. In case you don't speak the galopo, what it means is love, um love. This is a blessed holy life. I am all... A glow. And now I know the key of heaven, darling. But if right, you don't know the original. I have no idea. What is that? What is that? I don't know, but it sounds nice. Well, it's... I think it's... I think it's... Oh. I'm a big and kind. I'm a madman. Beat wings, it's you! Of course, cause what the fuck? You got the guy in the chair like that? No, this isn't their right. I want one title, the voice of all people living alone. I love the sea. I think this is from a little one stitch. You know, I broke my wrist ones, yeah? I broke my wrist. And the... The story's... They gave me this drug. Um, I was a child though. So they couldn't give me more things. I don't know if I had to, but I dissnaped the fuck out of my wrist. And then I remember I had this dream. Well, it wasn't a dream. I thought it was fucking wide awake. It turns out it wasn't real. Um, cause I asked everyone. And I could see we knew the poo on the TV. Okay. And he kept calling me. He kept calling me to his land. Come, come. He's okay, come. And I was like, yes. Of course. We need the poo. He fucking makes sense. I mean, hospital. Um, I just imagine that there's someone in some bed. They're highest fuck. And he's like, the day he recovers. Oh my God. He's like, I remember the surgeon. He, he pulled out a ukulele. And then the other surgeon started singing a Disney song. And he was really nice. He just went like that. And then he was like, what's that real? You know, I mean, everyone was used to telling him. No, you were fucking high off your nut, mate. Yeah. But he was like, I don't know, yeah. Oh, yeah, that was. Oh, yeah, that happened. What the fuck? Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. That's so hard. You see what I mean? It's such a bonding experience. But that's okay. So that's really interesting. You got the kid on the far left. Um, and he, he's actually, he's learned how to monitor his own sound. Yeah. You got the one in middle, like, looks like, obviously, so far out zoomed in. So he looks smaller than he is like a little elf. And, uh, he's, he's really so aware. And I think this is, this is the best example of what I was saying. Look, it's like, it's family time. Everyone's just, well, they actually harmonically trying to work together. It's actually so hard. It's one of like the toughest things to do, working at different tempos, different speeds, all together and one, and they're doing it for fun. Yeah. Think about that. That's a crazy part, right? Like, this is what they do to, to like, chill out. Insane. It sounds good. Okay. I love this song. I have the tallest. Okay. I love this song. I have the tallest. It's such a heartbreaking, grimy, goodness gracious. That's fantastic. Her breathiness. It's so characteristic to a disney like approach of singing, but it brings such magic. Again, this is like such a contemporary take to songs that are already contemporary because Tangle is quite a new age disney movie. But, they're older, new, disney movies are shit. They're not bad. All of them. But, and can't talk one other. Oh my god. It's actually not that bad either. Music wise, actually solid. We don't talk about the proof. No, no, no. Fuck that song because I got so overplayed, but I mean, like, musically speaking, it's actually a very, very good song. And it's actually a very, very good musical score that the movie has. It's genius. Just the movie itself. It's like piss off. It's for losers. It's also for kids. Correct. And all kids are losers. Oh my god. Fuck. Really, really good. He's got the set up, the lights, the guitar. Oh, you know he's trying to impress the girls. Oh. Oh. It's too tradition. I'll say I'm in. Oh my god. No, come on. Brian never knew I needed an acoustic, I don't need a version of this. I'll say it now. You swore you would say. But I'm in the mood. It's too tradition. It's too tradition. I'll say I'm in. Oh, come on. No, come on. Come on. I need him. I need him. I need him. Do you like the whole cover? I'm killed to collaborate. Ah, 100%. 100%. You know that that's actually... That's the song from Hercules Megara. I smell her. I smell her. I smell her. It's Meg. Huh? Megara. You see? You see what I mean? When I'm not smirled. When I'm not smirled. Smirled is from Hunchback. Oh. Yes. Same old. What's up? What's up? I'm Johnny. And Jolly. It's father. Well, actually, Baleska was a very problematic child when she was growing up. So she never fucking slept. So this is VHS era. So my parents would get... They bought this library of VHS Disney originals. Is that what they're called of? Yes. And they had like, you know, Hercules, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Your Aristocats. Aristocats and Baleska, Oliver and Friends. That was a dumb-o. A Dumb-o always made me sad. I hated that stupid movie. And ballet. Because she would wake up ballet. I will never do that to my children, that it's a completely form of torture. That's a quote of fuck moving thing. It's a form of torture. Yeah. Because it talks about serious shit. It is so horrendous. Same as Bambi. Why would you do that? Fuck Bambi, yeah. I'm dumb-o. So ballet would wake up in the middle of the night, maybe 11pm. You know, this is a child. She's meant to be asleep. But she just didn't. Because she's a demon. And then she would wake up mother and father. And then she would go to the... You would just die. Get a little blanket, like in a movie. And then put on the VHS thing, just sit there in front of it. And she wouldn't fall asleep. I would watch movie after movie until the song came up. Yeah. I mean, my mother was with it next to her. And I'd be like, la la la, the sun's out, finally. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Beautiful. Wow. Wow. Yeah, dude, you get yourself a woman that sings like that, dude. That's what you do, isn't it? You find yourself a woman that sings like that. And it's like every day is fucking, is heaven. Every day is a blessing. You know, imagine you argue with her or whatever. And then she pulls up. And then she pulls up. Your pancakes are garbage. You know, and she said, you ask with them, we chocolate chips. I would say blueberries. You know, and then she said, someday it's a crusty ocean. You think of me? Yeah, you're like. What even are those lyrics? Yes. You start crying and shit. It's like eating the shit pancakes. Oh, you're not holding my heart. The sea is a secret song to you. It's maybe I'll probably remember me. Wow. You have to travel for me. She must be of a idiot type. She does, yes. Yeah. Oh, my God. You. Jesus. I have a question though. This is from Coco. What is Coco? They make, is the movie about the Mexican... What the more you're here? I'm more, I'm more, I'm more, that guy. That's the movie. Yes. I've never seen that movie. I don't watch any more than this name movies, because I think they're all garbage. And sane. It's ridiculous. That's so ridiculous. Insane. It's ridiculous. That's so ridiculous. It is. But that's your disinversion, yeah. Is everything. That's it. Well, there's gentlemen there you have it. If you'd like to tag us on anything else, add W and SK 15. We're obviously very excited. The tags are on the opposite way, by the way. I'm really sorry. We're sitting on the wrong sides, but that's the tag. Yeah. It's just new studio and stuff, but this is the studio for the movie stuff. It will change and stuff, it's still a bit more, still a bit left. And then the other one is basically, I don't know if I can 10% ready. Anyways, so but next figure should be all right. I will see you shortly. Goodbye. Bye bye.
