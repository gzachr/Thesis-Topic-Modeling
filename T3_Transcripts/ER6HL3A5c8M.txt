If you're a Filipino and you see this, you know what to do next.
Let's heat up some oil.
You know guys, it's my first time making this.
How come the vendor in the Philippines is on the left and right?
Brown sugar.
I put brown sugar first so the banana won't be overcooked.
Then let's follow the banana.
Then I just mix it until the sugar reaches the bottom.
There. For the first-timer, it looks okay.
And of course, the stick won't be missing.
Let's have a snack. Let's go!
He brought something I can eat.
Are you going to eat the other thing?
I don't know. Everything has meat in it.
Yeah, I ate meat the other day and it made me remember why I don't.
You know what I mean?
It destroys my body.
It's kind of like a dessert snack. Kind of like that.
It can be pretty good if it's covered in bakeries.
It's pretty.
Try it, man. Try it.
It's pretty good.
It's my first time making that.
It's not like rust. Do you put it in the oven or something?
No, it's deep fried.
I'm trying to deep fry banana.
It's my first time making it because back in the Philippines, it's just like Bender everywhere.
They sell that a lot.
Bananas.
Is that what you remember the long time ago?
No, it's different.
The one that I got last time was a little better than that.
I remember that one last time.
Those are pretty good, though.
That one looks like chicken tenders.
Yeah, that one.
They're not both fair.
It's like a little biscuit.
Sharer didn't know she likes it.
I'm going to peek at my tables really quick.
You want to look?
Yeah.
It looks professional that it's on a stick and then...
Well, it's called banana cube.
If I'm not going to put it on the stick, it's not cute.
People are going to bash me.
Chicken! Chicken!
Alright, so what have we got?
Bananas.
Banana cube.
It's banana coated with sugar.
Sweet banana.
I don't know, I'm thinking about like, whipped cream for the two.
Yeah, I think whipped cream would be good.
It's freaking delicious.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Whipped cream, I think it's a good pair.
Is that how they have it or do they put anything else on there?
No, that's it. We sell that for like 20 cents a stick.
It's that cheap.
Bananas.
I got more fans!
Yep.
I feel like bananas look pretty expensive in the US.
Yeah.
You knew I was hungry!
Bananas.
You knew I was hungry. What is this?
Oh, it's dessert.
Yeah, it's kind of snack dessert.
Yeah.
Thank you, chocolate.
Yeah, man.
Oh, how do you guys like it?
Yep, it's not fun.
It's different.
Yeah, it's different.
What was that thing around the thing?
Sugar.
Bad babies.
It was good.
You're a YouTuber?
I am.
Want to try my food?
Nope.
It's free.
Is it good?
I mean, they say it's good.
What is it?
It's my first time making it. It's called banana cube.
Banana cube?
Yeah, it's basically deep fried banana with sugar.
I love bananas.
Do you like bananas?
Yeah.
Want to try my food, man?
What is it?
It's called banana cube.
Deep fried bananas with coated with sugar.
Brown sugar.
It tastes like something I've had before.
Yeah.
Where are you from?
Mexico.
I cook Filipino food and let everyone try it.
This is Filipino food?
That's Filipino snack.
Wow.
It's good.
It tastes like a fruit.
I don't know how to...
I mean, it's a banana.
It's a banana.
But it tastes like something else.
Like something from Mexico?
Yeah.
It's confusing me.
It's confusing you?
Yeah, it's like...
Sometimes it tastes like meal and sometimes it tastes like fruit.
Really?
So what is the brown sugar?
It's brown sugar.
Yeah.
I thought it was going to be spicy at first for some reason.
It looks like meat.
It looks like meat.
No, I thought it was meat.
I thought it was a corn dog.
Corn dog?
That's good.
Some people, they'll blow up and they'll...
Yeah, it goes up and down.
That's epic.
Yeah, I know.
Well, congratulations.
That's awesome.
Thank you.
Yeah, yeah.
Banana?
That's awesome.
Yeah, I would never guess.
Did you eat it?
Did you try it?
Yeah, I tried it.
I thought it was dough.
No.
No, I didn't.
It tastes really good.
What's up?
I got something that is not spicy.
Now I can try it.
Yeah.
I'll be careful.
You're welcome.
