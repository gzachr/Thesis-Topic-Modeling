 But you're Friday. The freshest. Ah! Okay, super excited for this one because this is 18 Philippines and the mega crew. They were the gold medalists and winners of the Hip Hop International World competition. Well. But that was important. It is. It's like the biggest hip hop competition in the world. They were the guys that dance with Scuster. That's right. The crew that literally dances everywhere with everybody. Die! Die! Die! Hit me like a man. I'm not sure. Yeah. It was them. Yeah, it was them. But another dances as well. Yes. So, this is the winning battle. This is cool because we don't perform. We don't usually 12-digit deep into dance from the Filipino music industry. So, let's give this a go. That's right. Just disclaimer. Little disclaimer. I'm not sure if it's a super technical hip hop dance or whatsoever. Don't really know all the lingo but I do know a little bit of dance. So, I'll try to break it down. 2014. Last one. Last one. Last one. I'm out of that. Don't let this one fall. Oh, there. Oh, there. Oh, my God. What? For me. Make sure this is what I mean. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. So many. So many. Oh, my God. I think it's something that I can't. Woohoo. I don't know where to look. All right. So, in this particular performances, just a little tip. Look at the hole. So, don't look at an individual because then you're going to miss on the visual aesthetic of the whole of the whole. Look at what I just look at the middle. Yeah, just look in the middle and just pray for roles. Profit to roles. You said. Yeah, but it's all because of it. Try, can I appreciate everything? Yeah, because a lot of the formations create a lot of visual illusions. So, yeah, so they made like a thing. Yeah, so you have to pay attention to the whole stage. Just a little pointer out there. Yeah. Obviously, if you focus in one dancer specifically, then you'll be like totally mind blown. But it's hard. So you will have to watch like seven times. Well, in that case, like 35 times. Indeed. I don't know how many members there are. Yeah. Or how many members there were in this moment. Because, you know, crews, you can constantly keep adding people. Ah. Crews and dance crew. Some people leave. Some people come back. It's like a company. Yeah, right. Yeah. Oh, god damn. Whoa, girl. Huh. She's a flyer. That is cool. Hell yeah, we love the sass. This is definitely my favorite section. They're whacking in. Yeah. Ah. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Woo. Oh, my god. Nice to meet you. What a freaking free mix. Isn't saying. Oh, hell yeah. Oh, the mission formations are insane. They're just coming in so much energy. You're bro there's stamina dog. Hey, that was so cool. I missed it. Let's see. I don't know with the look. Oh, okay. Look at the guy. With the cap over here. Yes, yes, yes. That's the focus. Look at the guy with the cap. And if you see it with everything that's going on in the back, it looks like they had flew out of nowhere. So like you landed on his head by magic kind of thing. Look at the background. You see, it's like so when the guy over here, when the main dancer here, twisted his head, they had landed on the other guy's head. So it was like a whole visual illusion. It's really cool. Oh, bro. Well, I always saw, we saw the shame if you missed that. It's like a little ghost to win. You're out there and doing the chicken dance challenge. I was like, what the hell? Oh, my God. Jesus. This people will have. Fucking. All right, listen. That's what I already imagine they have to deal with the. Cool. Cool. Because I said you pop, bro. You lock or whatever. You can't. You tend some distance. I don't actually know how to pop a look whatsoever. You're just saying, but you know in the whole. You know the whole next section that they just didn't know. My God, my neck hurts. My neck muscles hurt just my looking at it. Good muscular endurance. Oh, freaking insane. I wonder, I wonder who helped choreograph because there's so many sections. So I would think there's like, this is just my protection. I don't know how this works. I've never been in a desk group before. But friends of friends, you know. I suppose that each section is choreographed by a different person and then kind of put together because each section is for a different type of style of commercial hip hop dancing. That's why you see them coming in and they come out. Exactly. And then it's like, okay, massive rehearsals where everybody comes together. That would be really interesting to see how they have a choreograph. And how big is their studio? Do they have a warehouse because Hollywood can move it? Well, we saw, do you remember when we did Philippine dance? They used to be a person in the street. Oh yeah, on, not in it. On the street. On the street because they said on top of it. Yeah, that's true. They love it. Or inside it. No, you got it. But yeah, they would still rehearse on the street because a lot of the time they would be so big. The bands, the crews, the companies. This is far beyond my area of expertise. So I just enjoy bringing for time. I'm actually having a blast, dude. Yes, it's really cool. I've never seen this live. I wonder why you like to watch it live. Oh, it's a blast. I've been to a lot of dance conferences and like... That'll be down to go. It's on my bias, man. I'll say yes. I'll be like, yeah, I'll go. I went to a hip hop battle a couple of times when I was like 16. I've seen battles. Oh my god. You don't understand. Intensity in the room, though. It's like, wow. It's like you're going to watch. That's what I think boxing is like. No, you have no idea. No, no, no. But the environment. I don't know. Because I've never been to a boxing match either, but I kind of feel like it would be the same. It's so freaking intense, bro. And everybody was like... And then, you know... Is there ever beef? Yeah, tons of time. A lot of times. Big time. Yeah, and I was with the guys. So that movie just dances real. I was with this guy's... Yeah. That's a funny. Yeah, not so traumatized, but definitely... Yeah, but real. ...beef, yeah, for sure. But actually, I was with this guy's that were coordinating the whole event. And they were like, you have to say like a little corner and hide there until the whole beef is out. Because you're going to get trampled on. But it was very funny, because at the end of the thing, they look, you know, all over social media where people like, you know, we got to be respectful of all the dancers, that's no matter what crew they come from, blah, blah, blah. Because, you know, what's the whole point of doing this if you're all going to be fighting? Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Yeah. But he was very fun. I never went back again though. Not my space. I have to be honest. Be intense. But as the years progressed, the competitions here in London and the battles got really like... Just a true honor. Yeah, yeah. And then there are like actual things in actual venues. You all will be very unfortunate. It's if you had beef with someone, that was in your own crew, which I guess he would happen every now and then. And then... You formed your own crew? No, no, no, no, no. Because that's just what used to happen. People will have beef in their own crew. So I'll make my own crew, bro. And then when the battle is like proper beef, you know, like you did to me. It's a derby much. But I'll be unfortunate if you're doing like a jump and then the person who's meant to catch you has beef with him. I'll swear it, whoops. Ah, yeah, bro. That's what happens in the cheerleading movies all the time. You know, cheerleading movies? No, I've seen that many. Just see one. Not many, I haven't seen. Just one. I don't remember which one, but it was one. Wait, and then she breaks her leg. You prick. Okay. Hey, you could kill someone. I didn't know what I was saying. And I'm sure they have a lovely relationship. But I don't know, God. Ah, this is bringing grander from memories. Yeah. Never been a real person. How cool. Yeah. Oh, my God. Cool. Hey, did you catch that? Sorry, the beat was fucking bent. Go right, go right. Baby, jump. God. Good boy. Those are legs. How cool is that? Yeah, they definitely want for a reason. Oh, my God. He's the sex. In fact. Oh, my God. That's amazing. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, my God. That's freaking cool. Yeah. Oh, look at the guy with his hand. How many moves are in per counts? Like, that's absolutely insane. You got it? That wasn't even a jasplit. That was like a spider. Like a spider. Spider-Man. I didn't even know that that was. Bro, your knees hurt. There it there. Look what I have. See, it's like, it even like landed on like, he's like, what? Who are you? My God. Okay, yes. Pop and lock now. You see, they're probably in a locking situation. That's... Ooh. I love these stuff. This is fucking hilarious. It's so funny. How cool. Oh. Wow. This is more... This was what was trending more in the movement. Yeah, more commercial. Oh, what the... That girl flew. Can we put the commercial stuff? Oh my God, bro. That's so much energy. I know. I know. They definitely won four of being so dynamic. Woo! Oh! My God. Oh my God, what Jesus Christ. Bro, I'm sweating and I'm only watching. Oh, the candles are insane. Yeah, that's an ex-level ship. Oh my God. I love watching. My watch thinks I'm working out. There's a tiny lady behind the main dancer. Time to get moving. Should I start your workout now? Yeah. Your heart rate is gonna be on one 20. I have a very low resting heart rate. Some people think I'm actually dead. No, I'm not. But, so this is rising. You know it's fucking because I'm having a blast. You know the energy. That's that. Holy shit. God, bro, I could... This is the level of coolness. I wish I could ever be when I was in dance training. This puts into perspective, right? Like what goes, can I was really popular in sort of groups? And you see pubs and you see, you know, sort of in the music industry, dance groups that are also singing groups. And, you know, I'm blown away by this stuff that they do. I'm not very technical on that stuff. So perhaps I can be as critical. But like then you look at this. And then you're like, oh, this is like a brand. Like this is a whole new level. It's cool though, because you see a lot of this integrated like energy and craziness and punchiness. The whole... They sound like a style. They sound like a style. Effect to them in their current work. Yeah. Which is so iconic. It's like, it's like their stamp. It's the A-team stamp, you know. It's like, they've got it. And that's what really captivates me in that... In this Guster's latest video. Because it really like, it really just literally drove me into looking what they were doing. Because they got this whole entity of, we're not backup dancers. We are the main character in the movie. You know what I'm saying? And that was freaking cool. Yeah, they have it, they certainly have it exsignated. Uh, indeed. Sick! 18, that would have been... Yeah. And that's how they won. 2015. That's how they won. Resort Southern California. Also the US. They do it every year. Uh, the World Battles are in August the 8th. That was in 2014. 2015. That was going to be in 2015. Oh, how does World Grand Prix... Hip-Hop International. Hip-Hop International. Wow, that's so brilliant. Yeah. And it's good to see them still be so, you know, popular and active and stuff. Bloody hell, that's a different fucking pedigree of that. Mama, I'm about to stop their Instagram. See what they're up to now. Well, they're like, That's so good. You don't keep getting better, didn't it? And when you think about it, I form in it medley. It's not actually that crazy. But at that intensity, with that amount of different styles, with that amount of flying and acrobatics and crazy stuff. Bro, that's like a whole marathon. Let us know what you thought about it. And also, what else do you check out next? Maybe, goodbye.
