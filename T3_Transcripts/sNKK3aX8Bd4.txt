2020 highlights
I'm very excited because it's another of the festivals that I want to attend
Oh there's another virgin
No that's not virgin
That's El Niño Jesus
Isn't it?
Yes it's El Niño
Divino Niño Jesus
Ok so El Divino Niño de Filipina looks very different to the Divino Niño in Latinoamerica
The Divino Niño in Latinoamerica looks whiter
Yes
It's white washed our Divino Niño
Yes
Which is not congruent given that Jesus was not white
It was from Middle East
Yeah yours is better
There you go
What are these statues they are holding?
Like I saw
This is the Divino Niño too right?
The kid is holding this one and then this other woman is holding this one
Let us know in the comments
Are they the same Divino Niño?
Because look they look like the one that appeared at the beginning
But this one is way darker yeah
And look this one is whiter than the first
I'm so confused
This is interesting
Oh my god
Aww
It's so cute
Wow
Cebu
Wow
Wow
Powder powder
Okay
Okay Dom
That's it
That's it
Oh
I like this song
Wow
Wait
That was awesome
Like how it matched with the music there
Ah it's because they were like the head down
And they were getting on their stand and then
Wow
Wow
Wow that looks so much fun
Oh I like this
But that movie is very hot
Why is he like this?
Oh that's nice
Why are they imitating him?
Adiós miquita
So the military has their own parade
Like their own thing
I don't know why but I feel they are actors for this series
Descendants of the Sun
Exactly
I never watched that
I loved it
There's a Descendant of the Sun Philippines version
So I feel like they are actors from that series I don't know why
I don't know why
I wonder what
Oh my god this is so cool
This is my favorite
My favorite attraction
Wow
That must be very heavy
Wow so beautiful
They are kids
Yeah they were kids
It's like an illusion
So beautiful
So is that the virgin and the divinanita?
They are saying T señor in Spanish
Did you realize?
Maybe it's not T señor, señor es señor
O algo
What is that they have in their head?
It looks like cotton
It's so nice
Wow there are a lot of people
So wait this was in 2020
So this was right before the pandemic attack
Yeah because it was around March
It was in January
Yeah this was in January
But it was around March that everything went into chaos
And people started closing
It was like the last celebration
Before everything happened
Everything went down
Did you see that?
No
Look at me
And this one over there
Why are they so funny?
Oh my god
Wow
Another virgin, how many?
It's not a virgin, it's like a miss
It says first runner
Oh yes
First runner up
There was maybe
Like a page or something
Yeah because she's like this
So cute
Okay these are favorite characters too
So they made it in 2021 too
What?
It can't be
Okay I understand
This was their usual
Sinulog party route
And now it's empty
That's what they mean
It's a sad video guys
Sinulog party
Yes
Very nice
Very awesome
I really want
Everything to go back to normal
So we can enjoy
All these festivals and more
You know
It's hard to see
People happy together
With no mask and like enjoying
Their lives you know
Because of the new normal
Yeah but
Recently it was our
Independence day here in the American
Republic and we are supposed to have
A huge festival
Like that, it's called Carnival
Dominicano
And yeah
It's not possible now
It's terrible
I never go anyway so
Our mother never let us go
Because she's dead
From the devil
And you are not supposed
Like as Christian family
We were not supposed to
Go there
But then after we became adults
And independent
We never went either
So like I don't know
Anyway guys
