 What's up, broskies and babe skis? Welcome to the broskie dome at 4.30am in the morning. Because today we're going to go swimming with whale sharks in Oslo. The biggest fish in the sea. This is our little setup for this day. I'm sleeping on the floor on a mattress. Anyway, we will see you guys after a 90 minutes good ride. In the next clip. Alright guys, so we are I don't know where to Oslo because we're staying in Volvo. It's about a one and a half hour drive. So we're going to be sitting on this little moped for one and a half hours. It's alright, look at the dude. This is where we're living right now. Check that out. Not a bad place to be living. Alright. The sea here is absolutely incredible. Never seen anything like it. So we got a scarf. Oh, it's not a scarf. Oh, it's really cool. It's a bit red. It's a bit red. It's cool. It's cool. How far away? Having a little petrol brake guys. A little scooty over here was dehydrated and very sad. I mean, look at how happy she is right now. Alright guys, we're filled up. We're ready to go. Let's see if we can actually make it to Oslo this time. Alright guys, we have arrived. We're at the whale shark place. Where's the ass look? Now to find us on whale sharks. This place is packed. It's absolutely insane. Let's hope we can see a whale shark between all the people. Hopefully there's enough whale sharks for everybody. See you guys on the boat. So we're going to put some black jackets on. Otherwise we'd rather not swim. We're going to put some whale sharks. We're off to see some whale sharks people. Guys, it's a beautiful day. Sun shining. The water's blue. The water is so blue guys. I don't think I've ever seen water this blue before. It's really amazing. It's so blue. I'm going to pull that boat in. It's pretty busy out here in the central. We found our first whale shark. It's not going to catch me a whale shark. It's pretty commercialized but it's because it is a really cool experience. The sea is so close. We're back on the boat. Two broski. We're floating on the boat. Back in the same boat. Alright guys, we're at the guest house that we stayed at. And this place is awesome. We have this little built out thing that goes right over the water. It's a beach. Oh, what's that? We are chilling, having a great time in our private little beach cabin. And look what we got. We got us some Filipino beer, baby. Rebels on the run around here. The boys have got a beer. Everyone, be careful. The guys got a beer. Run away, run away, they're going to be. Perfectly tilted at around about 45 degrees. Let the best, slowly pour into the glass, creating a small head on the top as you finish. Cheers guys. Cheers guys, cheers broski. Trying out Filipino beer, son, miguel, son miguel. And here's Tom. He has our amazing host Tom. Hello. He told us a lot about Filipino drinks. Did you just taste the alcohol? No. We can't find it. He's feeling it in this store. We're going to have a little drink. We're going to have a Filipino drink of people. I mean, that's hot. Add it again. With the white bands. What is this? Medicine alloy. First time to drink this one, you can smell it. This smell is not so good, but it's good for the stomach. That's what we call that medicine alloy. So you drink it when you have a sauce on it? Most of the look and the like this one. Yeah. Okay. And I'm sure I'm going to like it. Because I'm basically a local now. Coolafu.
