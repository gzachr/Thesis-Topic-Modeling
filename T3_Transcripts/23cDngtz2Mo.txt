 Hi guys, this is Seoul and welcome. Okay now. I'm just sending this quick message to let you know that last Saturday when we recorded all these week videos we realized that after we recorded the videos that the microphone was not working properly. So for this week, our audio is not going to be the same quality as it usually is. I'm just sending this message, this heads up because I don't want people in the comments section saying like, what's up with the audio? Why cannot hear properly or whatever? So yeah, the audio is going to be a little bit of a mess this week, please. Be patient and so sorry, this was an inconvenience that happened. It was out of our control. But I promise you the next week the audio will be as good as usual. Okay. Anyway guys, thank you for understanding. Bye. This is culture. So yeah, and today we will be reacting to a video of you. And there were many times this video is the video of Philippine National Anthem, Spanish English in Tagalog. Yeah! We are going to be reacting to the American Republic, which is also a little bit of a challenge. We are going to be reacting to the Japanese TV channel. We are going to be reacting to that video. But before we start reacting, listening to the National Anthem, I want to share with you the history of it. Yeah, because it's so curious that there are three languages in the National Anthem. Yeah, like our National Anthem is only one language. It seems Spanish. Why do you have... Why do you guys have it in two different languages? Lupa, Hina, Tagalog, Shows and Languages. It's the National Anthem of the Philippines. This music was composed in 1898 by Uliam Felipe. And the lyrics were adapted from the Spanish poem Filipina. Oh! In 1999, originally the Anthem was in Spanish. Exactly, it was a poem. Yeah, like ours, ours was a poem. Originally written as incidental music. In the Naja lyrics, when it was adopted as the anthem of the Revolutionary First Philippine Republic subsequently played during the Proclamation of Philippine Independence and June 12, 1898. So later, you received the American Columbia period, the Platt Law of 1907 Prohibilates, published in the late last Banners, Emplences or Divises, used by revolutionizing the Philippine-American War. Also, they kind of prohibited that. They used all these labels. They banned the song from the inflated. Wow! Yeah, wow! The Platt Law was repealed in 1919 during the Commonwealth Era, Commonwealth Act No. 3. In 2002, after the 15th, 1988, the Brazilian Anthem was the music cover of musical arrangement and composition by Uliam Felipe as the Filipino. The 18th National Anthem. The Spanish lyrics were translated into Tartala, beginning in 1940s. It was in the 18th century. And by the 18th version, from 1956 was revised in the 1960s to the present years. Several English version came into use on February 12, 1998. They said official, egaloblities, national anthem, abandoning the use of the Spanish and English version. Also, okay. Okay, so let's listen to the national anthem. I'm so nervous! Why am I nervous? I think he has the lyrics on it. So, which one would it play first as a Spanish version? Probably because it's all the lines. For a really nice Spanish version, it's a Spanish version. Oh my god! Oh my god! Oh, so cute! What sounds me the right? No, no, no, no! The small piece is... No, there are not as... but they fall in love with the sand. Why do I find this so cute? Use the music, you know? They find the use of the huge, it should have been because they said, yeah, it should be more epic. Or do you guys do this when you're in the national anthem? This was the most difficult situation to learn national anthem. So rude. Oh, I am eek though. But do you guys have rules for the national anthem? Like, we can add things to it, we can add cloth to it, and if you listen to it, whatever you're going, you have to stop doing whatever you're doing and put your right hand on your chest and your left hand on it. But the right hand left hand thing is... It's not common. It's in this use of that. Nobody knows that but they do it in the school. And some like the baseball games, the best player who's there. You have to remove your cup, whatever if you listen to the national anthem and also... Is that just a younger generation? They don't appreciate our national anthem as the... Awesome. Anyone? We are not old. Oh, I just turned 23. Oh, I got it. Anyway, let's continue in trying to learn to be serious. It's okay. I'm going to show you how serious the game is. Now, we only play two people, no one has to play half of our game. Oh! Wow. They pronounce it as... Exactly. They pronounce it as a real Spanish word. They should pronounce it. And your reggae. I love the lyrics. I love the lyrics. Now, let's see the official Comma Wars Irrangish version. 1938. 1938. 1938. 1938. I love the lyrics. I love the lyrics.

I just don't understand why they read them. The melody of the national anthem changes when it's in English. Yeah, it's so fast. Yeah, it's going to answer. The voice sounds weird. It's like they... It sounds weird. Yeah. La, la, la, la, la. All the sounds are down. The voice sounds weird. Okay, yes. It sounds like these cartoons from the 1940s or something that I'm so sorry. I might... We can't react. I'm in jail. Yes. I'm in jail right now. What is the voices of the singers? It's not the national anthem. It's not this respecting your national anthem. Please understand. We are biased and we think it's better in Spanish. Yes. It looks like it sounds really, really old. And it can't be because the other is all there. Mm-hmm. What does that mean? Yours. I think it's in English. Yeah, I don't know. Yes. Listen to me. Listen to me. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. But I didn't mention the song on the start. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.
