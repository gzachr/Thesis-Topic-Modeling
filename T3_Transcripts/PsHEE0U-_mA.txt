 Jan, and for how long you've been here? Six months. Six months, and how you find a Philippines? I love the Philippines actually. I've come here for work. I've been basically here since end of January. In January, okay? My work has actually made me feel comfortable. Filipinos have made me comfortable. If you look at those ladies, they're very curious. But yeah, what's amazing about this place is the partner people and their willingness to help you and to appease you in any way around fitting in. It's the diversity around the restaurant. So yeah, yeah. I've never gone to a place where you have one restaurant specialized in Italian, another one for the Filipinos, another one next door with regards to Cantonese. So it's just so diverse at your doorstep. So what is your favorite Filipino food then? I want a side-filipeida.
