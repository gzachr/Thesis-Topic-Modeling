Because really, we have to speak out.
you have to say all whatever you have inside  
you will not have this chance anymore guys.

I'm just joking 
no, I'm just joking, I find Filipino nationalities 
the best nationality
of course
they are very  loyal 
of course
and when they love, they really 
love  
of course 
when they hate, they really hate 
of course
but really guys, they have a special feeling inside , whatever they have  inside, they will speak it out
they don't have a double face
maybe, if ill say something, she will not let me sleep in the night 
they are really guys very dangerous 
last time catch behind TV !!!
what he's talking about!
he means that  they are very dangerous when they 
get angry
 they're throwing everything  
in the Filipino language, how I can say it?
I don't know
how you find it?
in the Filipino language 
Arab husband
I don't  know
first of all, they are responsible for their family
 and second of all, they  are straight, but !!! 
not all, we are speaking about our husbands
guys, we are speaking about our husbands only .to be clear
 
he is a good man , sometimes the things that I don't like about him 
especially when he comes from the 
work and he will remove his dress  
he will throw somewhere everywhere 
you are not the only one 
this is the thing that I really don't like.
how I find my husband? 
Hama is a good man, I'm not saying that is a 
perfect, okay, there is no such a perfect person  in the world 
they are responsible for you.
they will work, they will not let you work, they will work for you 
they will bring food to  the table
big clap guys, really very emotional 
it's going out from the heart 
she is talking about whom?
To be honest, when I and my 
husband started, in the beginning, 
we don't love actually  each other, right, huh, 
yeah, do you believe it!
you don't love each other !
no not love, there is like crush 
yeah after one year or more, we build our relationship
then how long you guys know each other  
and then you marry 
six months?

a beautiful, flowery love story 
I want to know now 
you want to know now guys? 
she's talking for half an hour but she doesn't answer
yeah, the percentage 
which one?
zero to 100, 
no , is the love getting lesser or more?
 it's getting more 
because I'm getting to know him  more than before
he is more open now than before
we can say that your marriage is perfect
