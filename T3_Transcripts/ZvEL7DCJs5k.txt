How are you?
What do you need?
You.
I'm kidding.
Because you're being too serious.
When was the last time I saw you?
When you left.
Let's end this.
There is nothing wrong, right?
We already talked about this.
That's why we continued this.
You said that there is nothing wrong 
with being more than friends.
But now...
... it feels like everything has changed.
You're a liar.
You said you wouldn't change your mind.
I love you.
Goodbye.
