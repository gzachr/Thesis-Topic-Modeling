I've been here for two months now and I wanted to 
make a video about what it's like living here in  
the Philippines maybe answer some questions that 
people might have I was doing that for a different  
reason mine was for travel and making YouTube 
videos but I should be able to kind of Hit the hit  
the nail on the head with other things too so the 
first big thing is it's going to be more expensive  
than you think now it is definitely cheaper here 
that's 100 much much cheaper for instance I'm at  
Starbucks right now I just bought a coffee right 
now now it was 175 pesos which is three dollars  
now that's cheaper than back home and the US would 
probably be about double that for that same coffee  
but the thing that what sneaks you in is you're 
probably gonna be taking a lot of grabs which  
is like the Uber of the Philippines um you're 
probably going to want to stay in certain areas  
right you're going to want to stay in a little bit 
nicer places so now it's definitely cheaper but  
it's not like it's Dirt Cheap like you would think 
it'd be it's gonna be more expensive than you  
think and after half spending a couple months here 
my expense is obvi honestly are about the same as  
what I was spending back home in the US and that's 
like with a car payment and things like that  
now and I was living at a nice apartment too 
the thing is is I'm also traveling now if I was  
hunkered down just working you know working all 
day just coming home maybe cooking something at  
dinner and obviously I'd spend a lot less money 
but it's definitely more than you would think  
at least at least bare minimum You're Gonna Want 
a thousand a month and that's if you're honestly  
I would say that's if you're a homebody that's 
if you're a homebody me I like to eat out all  
the time A lot of times also I've been eating 
alone so that's a major thing I'm not paying  
for somebody else to eat with me the second thing 
is you need to be patient so service here in the  
Philippines is a little bit different than it is 
back home in America it's like it's almost like  
the faster the service the better the service 
right so it's all about like efficiency quickness  
um you know like apologizing you know sorry sir 
it took so long I'm sorry ma'am now they are good  
about that here as well they are it's not like 
they're just completely blow you off especially  
with the big companies in here like Starbucks and 
stuff like that Filipinos are very hospitable and  
they have great customer service but things 
just move at a little bit slower Pace I think  
Filipinos are extremely patient so it's just 
in the culture to be more patient and relaxed  
well I think it's a great thing it's refreshing 
because people here are very very relaxed but  
if you're trying to rush if you have a rush type 
personality you're not gonna fit here you're not  
going to fit either you're going to get whipped 
into shape or you're gonna have to leave because  
you have to be patient here so that's the 
second biggest thing and let me say also I  
think it's a good thing it's just different just 
a different style I think it's more of a cultural  
thing Filipinos are very patient so they're like 
that with all situations they're patient with you  
let me give a quick example like let's say 
someone's trying to sell you something right  
like they'll like they'll just say hey 
do you want this and you'll be like uh  
and then you can kind of just stop and 
and just stare at each other for a minute  
and just they're just kind of like waiting 
there you know like and then it's like no  
I don't want it so make sure you bring a 
pocket full of patients because you're gonna  
need it and honestly patience is one of the 
pillars of a happy life I think anyways right  
so maybe come to the Philippines to learn some 
patience the third thing is bring as much cash  
with you as you can for to get it exchanged if 
you're coming from vacation especially if you're  
coming for a couple weeks a month bring you know 
as much as you can maybe a thousand uh or however  
much you plan on spending because it's most likely 
going to be cheaper for you in the long run I've  
been here for two months now and you know I'm 
constantly I don't constantly but when I have  
to pull out money it's it's five dollars from 
the Filipino bank and I my bank account I think  
doesn't charge me and I have a I'm lucky I have 
a good bank account but other bank accounts they  
might be charging you fees on top of that I know 
last time I came to the Philippines there were  
times where I'd pull out cash and I was getting 
charged ten dollars to pull that cash out 500  
pesos to pull out money so definitely bring as 
much money as you can or are comfortable with for  
the exchange rate or there's apps like remotely 
there's an app where you can send money and I'm  
pretty sure you can send money to yourself and 
they generally give really good exchange rates  
so you essentially send US Dollars online and 
you to some kind of bank or facility here and  
you go pick up pesos from there and I believe 
you can send it to yourself or maybe you have  
a friend that you trust and you can just send 
it to them and their name and then go pick it  
up with them so definitely bring as much cash 
as you can I've been traveling for four months  
now and through Asia and I've spent at least 
two hundred dollars ATM fees so make sure you  
bring an envelope the fourth thing is you can 
travel through the Philippines very affordably  
now there was a video where I traveled from Cebu 
to sikihor I stopped from mobile Cebu to demogete  
down to sikihor and that cost me about 25 U.S and 
so that was it wasn't expensive but I mean it was  
a little bit more maybe than you would think 
now on the flip side I use Agoda and Agoda has  
a great thing where you can book a flight and 
a hotel bundle and if you do that they really  
really whatever their system does really saves 
a lot of money for instance I was in Cebu City  
I booked a flight the night before it was I think 
it was 12 hours before the flight departure Cebu  
City to Davao it was actually Philippines Airlines 
which is the best Airlines here they came with the  
hotel for one night and it was 60 dollars which is 
about 3 000 pesos after taxes and that was the day  
before the flight and it wasn't even 12 hours 
I think it was like 10 hours before the flight  
now on the flip side of that when I went to 
the to the counter I didn't register my bag  
online and online it would have cost me maybe 
700 or excuse me 500 pesos to check the bag but  
at the actual checking counter they charged me 
uh it was 2200 pesos which is like forty dollars  
um just just under forty dollars for a like 
a little bag it wasn't even a big bag so that  
basically to check my one bag was almost the price 
of the whole flight and hotel bundle that I got so  
be careful with that make sure you you check the 
regulations here they'll get you good they don't  
mess around um there's any in every Airlines 
like that right but here they're not flexible  
with it obviously and generally what it seems 
like they do is they they charge you more at  
the airport versus if you were to check your pay 
for your bag online so that's kind of a pointer  
but definitely I recommend Agoda they have a 
flight hotel bundle you get really good deals  
the the flights alone were double without booking 
the hotel so that's been good for me so far the  
fifth thing is try to explore as much as you can I 
learned that you really got to get out and explore  
the Philippines prior to the prior to coming 
this time I had been here twice and I had only  
been to Cebu City and Manila and although they're 
great cities and it's you still can have a lot of  
fun and you know you still can enjoy yourself and 
relax it's a whole nother story when you leave and  
go out into the province and to the smaller cities 
to the beaches it's really really a different side  
of the country and I highly recommend it and even 
if you're thinking you know man maybe this is my  
first time coming to the Philippines I only got a 
couple weeks I would really try to squeeze it in I  
would maybe maybe you can fly to an area where 
it's pretty short travel time you can hop on a  
small plane maybe to get to some nice beaches I'm 
telling you you got to do it the Philippines has  
the most beautiful beaches amazing snorkeling 
I mean it's amazing it's and there's so many  
islands over 7 000 Islands you can come here you 
can stay at a beach resort for a great price you  
can just go out onto the beach you know a couple 
dollars for some flippers and fins for the day  
100 pesos and go and see like world-class diving 
I mean insane like National Geographic type stuff  
and actually the Philippines got nominated for 
the number one uh dive country in the world and  
end so and it's close with Indonesia you have 
to go and explore as much as you can and also  
if you're on a quick trip and you don't mind 
spending extra money you can take taxis and  
grabs they have plenty of van services you 
know that's really the easiest way you can  
you know pay three three to five thousand pesos 
like 60 to 100 and get like a four hour private  
van ride somewhere to like a beach or somewhere 
nice and it's really convenient that way too  
and the last thing that I find that I figured out 
over time is look up information on Facebook back  
home in the US they don't do business like that 
on Facebook they do but in a different capacity  
here they do a lot of business on Facebook and 
on WhatsApp as well so let's say you Google  
something and you can't find much information on 
it go on to Facebook and just use Facebook as a  
Google and you'll find like bus schedules um if a 
little Transportation uh information or different  
business information that you would find on 
there that you wouldn't normally be able to find  
and my final thing is this isn't even a number 
this is just my takeaway last piece of advice  
just be cool and enjoy it the Filipino 
is a real cool calm collected they take  
their time like I said earlier very patient 
so just go with the flow just fit it just  
relax and enjoy I hope you enjoy explored as 
much as you can bring as much money as you can  
and be patient as you can we'll see you here 
thank you for watching we'll see you next time
