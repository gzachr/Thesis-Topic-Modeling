A lot of mountains. Yes. Big mountains. And then my house in here to see. You know, it's about an ocean. Yeah. Excellent. Yeah. As soon as buddy said, it's about an ocean. That was it for me. Because I'm an ocean person. And if you could live body ocean, that is the best thing ever. At least to spend, I would say, thousands of hours throughout my lifetime. On the beaches in Hawaii, California, Florida. And not too much in the Philippines, but you never know that could change. So you are for New Jersey? New Jersey. New Jersey. New Jersey. New Jersey. Brooklyn. No, Brooklyn. Yeah, that's right. That's close by. Obviously. Where I grew up is 45 minutes to an hour drive. Right. From Scotch Plains, New Jersey to Brooklyn. Brooklyn. Brooklyn's a nice place. Yeah. A lot of different ethnicities. You got Italians. You got Irish people. You have Germans. You have Asian people. Different kind of people. Yeah. It's a good place. Yeah. It's a good place. So how many dishes are staying in hospital? I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I have a... So you've been... You've been admitted before that hospital? Yeah. Yeah. And same type of problem, buddy. Same thing. Yeah. It was the same type of problem. It's like a boil. Like a bump. You get a bump on your leg and then you get an infection inside. So you get an infection inside? Yeah. Can I actually do it? I fell. I fell off the sixth floor of a building and landed on my back. Oh my god. And that was it. I couldn't walk after that. I'm just lucky I live. So how many years now? I live. How many years? You get out of accident. 2016. 2016. 2016, it happened. So how many years you are being treated? I don't know. I stayed in bed. I think one time for... Wait, see, you heard this. No, well, to... Last week, I got out of bed for the first time in 90 days. Because I had a boil. It's called a bed sore. I had a bed sore. I had a bed sore. And I didn't want to move around and get out of bed. Because it was healing up. And then I decided to get out of bed, which caused a new one. So I didn't want to... I said, I got to go. So now it's better than before. Your... Your... Your... Your health... It's better than before. Yes, before I was really weak after surgery. Your feet... Your feet... Your feet... So maybe you'll be healthy every day. It's up to God. Up to God. It's up to God. You never know. Maybe technology or data to figure out how to... How to repair a spinal cord damage. So you ordered spinal cord? Was it nothing? No. It was shattered. Something. Thousands of pieces. That... That girl looks like Nixie. That's not Nixie, is it? I'm looking at her. But he's probably like, damn, look at Rob staring at that person. He's talking about... He's talking about... Okay. You know when you miss somebody, everybody looks like that person, alright? I'm looking at him. I'm looking at him. I'm looking at him. It's a nice day out today. Like, buddy was saying it's hot. It is hot out there. So you see, you have a better technology than her in the Philippines. Yeah, a little bit. I like the Filipino people better than Americans. Sometimes Americans can be rude. And I don't know. It's just... I went in a Navy in 1984. And I was... You're Navy? Yeah. That I met a Filipino person. And they were the nicest people. Oh, I think so. Wow, I started hanging out with them. And then I got a job after I got out of the Navy. And half of our construction crew was Filipino guys. And they were super good people. The best. Check out the fountain. They got the water shut off today. So... 39? Oh, so it's only at night, but... 39? The lights, the water and the lights. So as soon as I saw this new bedsoar developing, I don't want it to get out of control. Because I already have one. Pretty big bedsoar. And now to second small one. I started with the old school term, Nippet in the bud. Bud? Nippet in the bud. Before it gets wet, I control. Like my buddy, Marcus from the Coddy area. He said, you know, antibiotics help you heal up faster. And I was trying to avoid taking antibiotics. Because I do have a bacteria. An antibiotic resistant bacteria in my body. So I'll have to be careful about taking too many antibiotics. But sometimes you just get to the point where you have no choice. It's either that or kick the bucket. I don't really want to do that. So God will. That's about it. I got to put the camera down because I'm going to want to get in the car sick. I'm going to turn it over to AD. I live dream. Age gap marriage at 12 years. I thought it was just a baby. Yeah. So buddy has a 12 year age gap marriage. His wife is 12 years younger than him. That's one for buddy, all right. You got the cool driver. It's too expensive. Hey. Hey, good. You good in school. And if you're not in school, go back. I don't know. Make sure you stay in school. Give them 20. This is what I mean about poverty and the Philippines. Yeah. Usually I don't do that. What about other, you got both of them? They're all excited. Yeah. Bye. See, we never had a dude ever. He's a pro-working. Yeah, for working. Okay. Have a vacation. Because my wife had lots of blood in LA. Yeah. Yeah, it's nice and warm near to Los Angeles. You got to tell the relatives, hey, bring us over. We're going to get the expenses. Yeah, that's the cost. Cost a lot of money. Yeah, cost a lot of money. Yeah, cost a lot of money. Yeah, cost a lot of money. With the president we have now, I'd have somebody sneak over to her. I wanted to sneak my wife into the country, be the label. And force the... Obama or the president for sure. They're both the same. One's brown and one's white. But they're both Democrats. So right now Obama and Biden, they talk, they're good friends. It's the same team. And then they talk about the same thing. And then they talk about the same thing. And then they talk about the same thing. And then they talk about the same thing. And then they talk about the same thing. And then they talk about the same thing. And then they talk about the same thing. And then they talk about the same thing. And then they talk about the same thing. The most expensive real estate in Hawaii. And they closed the airport that day. And my friend said, we got to get down there to Sand Island Access Road. It's an industrial road that runs right along the fence for the airport. And all these planes look like military planes were flying in. And they closed the airport. And it was Marcos and his family. They loaded up a bunch of US military planes and got all their stuff out of there. So now his son is in charge. And Marcos, like the United States, to Turkey does not like the United States. But I think there's going to be a bunch of military bases that are going to open back up in the Philippines because of... Boom, what's his name? Boom, boom. Boom, boom, boom. There's going to be more American military here. Mid-A'Knowing H.S. They said six military bases that are going to open up in the next three years. There's a lot of people who are traveling for weddings, funerals. I felt bad for those people. Weddings and funerals. And then they missed it because they didn't really schedule for wedding. Well, we're here at St. Vincent Hospital and Ila. We just went out to talk to... We had to stop get... Ray Ray some coffee. She needed some caffeine to wake up a little bit, helping out. So here we are. This is my... Ila said it's my third time here. Let me see if I can reverse the angle on the dangle here. Could be weird times. Usually... Usually, do the paperwork and bring it to the vehicle and then they get me out into the wheelchair. And the thing is you... They want you to use their wheelchair, which is pain in the ass. So hopefully they got... They got some space because this place is busy. Well, we're here at St. Vincent Hospital. They got me surrounded. Nurse in the back. Are you single? Are you single? And what's your name? My name is the medication. Hi. I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor. I'm a doctor. The medication. Hi. I'm a driver. Go to the United States and be from the nurse. She'll take care of you.
