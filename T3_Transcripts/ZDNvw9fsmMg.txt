 And here we are in Manila. Wow, so hipster here. Oh my god, it smells so good. Awesome vloggers. I'm wearing it. I'm so good. Cheers. So here we are. We have landed in Manila and we got out of the airport quite quickly. And now we're waiting for our friend Kelly and Mike are picking us up. Which is so huge. So yeah. And Mike found us. After Mike and now we picked us up from the airport, we went to the bakery at a place called the Ellie. And went to a nice little bakery place called Pandelaia Toyo. We had some of the most beautiful sour doggos on to get ever imagined. Actually, I mean Pandelaia Toyo. Oh my god. Look at the dough action going on right here. Hi, how are you? Here we are. We went back to Mike and Nelly's place for a couple hours. We needed to get some work done. Mike and Nelly made us an amazing cocktail. All passions if I record correctly. And a beautiful appetizer with some cheese as well. How are we waiting for our friend, Avae to come. So we could go check out some restaurants in particular. The first restaurant we were going to try out was Le Chon. Twimi and I have never had Le Chon here in the Philippines before. And we were absolutely craving it. So Mike and Nelly took us to their favorite place to be chon. Smell bread. Bread and butter for the winds. Cheese kind of thing mushroom happening with olives. Salted butter. Okay. Oh my god. Best, best host ever. Is this spicy? It's rich dye. Is this spicy? It's rich dye. Do you have milk? It's correct. So look at that. Everyone is creating an amazing mural right now. Ooh, smoky. His life is over. Oh. Even the baby is crying. Trying to keep her happy face, but most of the food is served. As you can see, much to our dismay, we got there and the place was closed under renovations. Absolutely devastated. So we decided to go out to the bars and have a few drinks. But Mike and Nelly's followers that are measuring after it already left, saying that the brand new place actually just moved 30 meters down the road. And we didn't even see it. Okay, so Abby is bringing us to Knox Grill House. After our episode that Lechon Place was closed. So let's go through this place. See how it looks like. Ooh. This is one of the street food markets here in Manila. That's actually really clean to eat street food. So we're going to go and try and find some meat. We're going to snap down right now. Yes. Is it Lechon, babe? What is it? Okay, we're going to have a tour, see what's available, and then we will choose from there. So. Ooh. Getting hot in here. Wow, there are so many plates around here. Temperature prawns, calabarri, chicken, teriyaki, chips, giant, cocoa nuts. Oh my god. Look at the size of this bad boy. See where we're going now? That's the sign I've been looking for. Yeah? Now I've found the sign. And that's the sign we're looking for. So the bottom we wanted to go is actually closed. Yeah. Yep, yep, yep. That's so weird. I've been here a year ago. Really? Yes. Whoa. So this is another bar street. It's pretty nice. Look at that. Mrs. G. Hong Kong and kitchen car. That's cool. Still the setting where we're going. The police started because of our owners. They just partied. And they just decided to bring some. There's like so many places to go. Local, the left, the left. Local, the left. I love that. And we are their first people on this sofa. Yeah.
