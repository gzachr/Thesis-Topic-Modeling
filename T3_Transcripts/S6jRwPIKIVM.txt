so we're going inside i'm going to go in the 
kitchen and i'm going to make another lechon belly  
this time i will try to make it even more 
tasty than before yes more tasty than before  
so i'm using actually a frozen lechon belly you 
might wonder why would you use a frozen lechon  
belly well first of all this is the the fifth 
lechon belly ever that i made and i never tried  
to use a frozen one and i thought it would 
be nice to try because uh it's always good  
to keep a little bit in your freezer you know 
so if you have lechon belly in your freezer you  
can make it any time you like and also what 
i like about this lechon belly in particular  
is that the size is not so big it's 1.25 kilos 
so it's actually very handy to keep in your house  
and so i defrosted it overnight for 24 hours and 
surprisingly this lechonbelly was the crispiest  
lechon belly the most crunchy ever that 
i tried uh promise that was really so  
crispy and i will show you what i did uh 
first of all i just rubbed it in as usual with  
some black pepper some salt and some garlic powder 
and after that um i'm i steamed it for 30 minutes  
and the nice thing is that it really fits inside 
a small steamer so uh for the water i put some  
shallots and star anise as well some bay leaves 
and then put the heat on but what i put inside  
the lechon billy was also interesting i 
had some chives left over in the fridge  
and these were still perfect to be used for inside 
the lechon belly and it gave it really a nice  
flavor by the way i also added some chili flakes 
and um lemongrass so the tanglad i made sure to  
squeeze it a little bit and to make some cuts so 
that the juice come out then i roll it as usual  
and then i will show you um after putting the how 
do you call this thing not a rope it's not a rope
so anyway the uh the letchon belly uh as you 
can see is a small size and it fit perfectly  
in the steamer so that was really what 
i hoped for and look at that so it was a  
perfect size for this steamer i could still put 
the lid on like that and then after steaming for  
30 minutes the lechon belly look like this just 
put a weight on it so that the lid stays down
and i think the result was pretty good already
we go so this is the first step of course 
we still need to put it back in the oven to  
make it very crispy now the skin is still soft 
but i think it already looks looks delicious  
so the next step what i did was a little bit 
different than usual um i put some plastic  
around it first i let it go off put plastic 
around it and then put it back in the freezer  
for approximately two hours okay and i think that 
process really helped it make it more crunchy  
so then i put it on a tray and i added 
a good amount of salt and still i think  
that salt is the um the best one so far i 
find that uh compared to soy sauce and oil  
um the salt is really the best one by the way i 
was making some meatballs here as a side dish so  
put it back in the oven and now it's 250 
degrees celsius for one and a half hours okay  
so one and a half hours and then 
it looked like this super crunchy  
but there was a final step that i did and i think 
that was really something that made the difference  
see it's already looking 
good but one more step guys  
so here we go the lechon belly it looks amazing 
it smells amazing and now we need to try it of  
course and i think it's very crispy so then 
like i said one more step i put it back i  
actually after it cooled down i put it back 
for approximately 15 minutes on a grill setting  
and look at this it was super crunchy 
super crispy like i've never tried before  
and very delicious so i really hope you like
