So these are the workers here. There are people here cleaning up every time. So that's why this place is actually very clean because you guys are working. So I'm so out. Yeah I see one person there wearing the same uniform. Yeah. The workers are always cleaning up the place. That's why the place is very clean. Look here. This place is so beautiful. Look here guys. Oh my god. Look at this building there. It's kind of like BGC. It has the feel of BGC and Makati. Not just like I don't think it's that big equal to BGC. But anyways I've not been to everywhere yet. So first thing we're going to do is to find a place to eat. I'm starving guys and let's go eat. Let's find a place to eat guys. Ladies and gentlemen I was trying to find a place to eat and I just saw this cool every right out here. So look take a look here. There are a lot of food costs here.

Really? So you recommend a hot dog. Yeah. Are you sure? Yeah. I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. I'm sure. Yeah. Are you sure? Yeah. How sure are you? I'm 100% sure.

So we're going to try the hot dogs. So we're going to be good. All right. Looks good. This place is actually so beautiful. Is this the first one you found? Yeah. It's a blog. So I got this hot dog right here. So he actually recommended this. I'm going to try it. And I got a bottle of hot dogs to stay hydrated. And then after this, we're going to throw around the Eastwood City walk around to some places. Probably check out the more or the more is going to be another time. I just want to show you around here. So yeah, let's try this hot dog. Here we go. And of course, water to stay hydrated. Don't forget to drink your water, guys. Stay hydrated. Don't leave this place dirty. So get all of your trash here. And let's go. So bring the trash right here. And yeah. Drop it in here. So do not leave the place dirty. So it is time to go explore. So first thing we're going to check out here is this statue right here. I don't know the many of them. And I don't have a tour guide to actually tour with the many of these statues here. But it's fine. What's up, man? I'm good. So do you know the many of these statues here? No, I don't. All right. You work here. You work here? Yeah. Oh, okay. In the coffee shop. Yeah. Okay. Nice, man. What's your name? I'm a little bit of a success, okay? I'm a little bit of a... Yeah. Travel with success. Oh, we're in this little place right there. So it's a bridge. A little bridge coming from here. And you could go this way. Or you could go to the coffee shop right there. So that's a coffee bin right there. It's cool. And look here. Take a look at this place from here. It's about to rain. Oh my god. I don't want to rain. I don't want it to rain, guys. Yeah. So this is walking around a little bit. Ultimately reason why this place is always clean. These guys are always working. So let's just walk this way. Looking at this place, I figure out that this place is actually a business district. Because there are just a lot of restaurants, shops, and just anything like a lot of brands I'm seeing around here. And people come out here to eat. It's cool. Because it's my first time here, I'm not sure where to actually explore here. And I don't have a tour guide. Yo, what's up, man? I don't have a tour guide, but yeah. I'm going to make use of the time I'm going to stay here and show you around all of these places. So just check out this design of these buildings here. This should be kind of like a hotel. I'm not sure about it could be a hotel. Ladies and gentlemen, just came at the other side of this place. There's one major difference I'm seeing here compared to BGC. So check out these buildings, like this style of these buildings and not like the ones in BGC. And this is the reason people said this place is kind of like the San Francisco of the Philippines. Because the buildings are a little different. I mean, just the style. I don't know about the interior, like the interior of these buildings or the inner part of this building. But from outside, what I'm seeing here, like check this one right here. It's kind of really different from the ones in BGC. So that's why people have been saying this place is the same San Francisco. All of the Philippines. And you can just get anything here. Look here, there were a lot of restaurants, a lot of coffee shops. This place is actually a business district. The short time I've been here in the Eastwood City, I'm actually impressed by this place. It's beautiful, but it's not just beautiful. Like you could just get through here. You can get anything here. There are a lot of shops. There are a lot of restaurants. And there are even streets full. People are selling on the street. And since I love the street, I got to food from the street. I got to hot dog from the street. To at least patronize the people who are selling on the street. Because I love the street guys. And the street here is so very clean. The place is so clean guys. Look here. And it's about to rain. The weather is not in my favor, but I'm trying my best to, you know, get some vlogs for you guys. Hello. Hi. That's it. Welcome to the Philippines. How are you? I'm pregnant people everywhere. Those are people who are watching from outside of the Philippines. And probably you are planning to come to the Philippines. So they were also international, like our fast food restaurants. So this is my donut right here. At Yung Itala ang isa Itala meros Kadol ka Yung Kalo ang isa Ika Anakib yung pagmens sya uubukambay gemaakt n�� sayang, sya ca bod iwak Whewaw?

There's another mall here. So I thought there is only one mall here called Eastwood mall, but this mall is called Sabo Fashion mall. But I'm not going to talk more today. I just want to show you the exterior part of this Eastwood city. And we're here. So the day is Sunday and this road has been closed. So the cars cannot use this road today. I don't know how to do these other cars get out from here. But I think it's because they have some businesses there. People are selling right there. So that's why the cars cannot use this. But here, look here. I think I could go here. Honestly, this city is actually underrated. I was told to come here a very long time. But I've been like... I was just looking at the city like BGC, Makati. I thought they are just the best cities here. But Eastwood city is actually seen. It's beautiful guys. And those buildings I saw, they are not like the ones in Makati and BGC. They are actually extra. Yeah. Finally, this should be the end of this place here. So I just went to the other end there and another end here. So if I go back, I will actually be going back to the mall. So yeah, this is a beautiful city. But it is not big as compared to BGC and Makati. But actually it's still insane. It's clean, it's beautiful. And it has a lot of things here. Like if you live here, you don't need to go to BGC. You don't need to go to Makati. Because it's just kind of like the same feeling. So I'm not sure if I have to go everywhere, but I think I have walked almost everywhere here. And this city is seen as beautiful, it's classic. But it is not as big compared to places like Makati or BGC. Yeah, but it's still cool here. If you live here, you don't need to go to BGC. You don't need to go to Makati. You can just get anything here. A lot of restaurants, shopping malls, and everything. Coffee shops, they are all here. So like the sea breens, like Starbucks and coffee beans. I saw them here. So you can just get all of them here. And all the fast food you can think about. You can also find them right here in Eastwood City. Hi. You can also find like, or Imperial wine. And drinks here. Yeah. So I'm not sure if they have bars or nightclubs here. I'm not sure about... I think there are some little entertainment centers here. This should be... Maybe there should be some bars around here. Yeah. Because it's impossible to have a city like this without a bar or restaurant. But I can be sure of that. So yeah. So far so good. I've walked almost everywhere. Yeah. So I just passed here. Really? And I walk around. I'm back here. By the way, just before you go, we will be back here to do a proper tour of the mall. So if you want to check out the mall here, you want to see what's in the mall. Or how big is the mall. Make sure to stay tuned here. That's a subscribe button. I'll be coming back here to do a proper tour of the mall. And that's always a success.
