They say that food is a great way to 
experience a new country and what better  
way than with mouth-watering desserts 
today we are overloading ourselves with  
a tone of sugar as we wrap our mouths around 
a handful of traditional Filipino desserts
[Music] we're here at SM Cebu City mall to try our 
selection of dessert today and we've also Enlisted  
the local guide of crew again and she is going to 
help us navigate our way through the solution of  
sugary treats it looks like we have arrived at our 
very first stop which is a five-star coffee and  
they seem to be selling a lot of little Filipino 
desserts so first up we have got kuron which is  
apparently the number 21 ranked deep fried dessert 
in the entire world so this is um like a spring  
roll filled with banana plantain and Jackfruit 
there's a worker behind me is just loading up  
this a whole bucket of Turon it looks delicious so 
yummy I think we've just got it now it's actually  
quite a massive eh it's pretty pretty long so 
this is Tyrone with land card apparently Lanka  
is actually called Jackfruit so it's banana and 
Jackfruit inside oh very interesting here it  
goes [Music] the best way to summarize it is 
it's just like a banana spring roll you know  
it's delicious you can't go wrong very yummy so 
this is 25 pesos for this massive massive thing
[Music] oh oh very bananary having fruit inside 
like a spring roll that is a marvelous idea  
definitely rate this I want to go a bit warm but 
I mean I'm scared because it's got so much dessert  
to try today and this is only number one so tasty 
[Music] we're here at Cafe Laguna as they are a  
kind of specialized Cebu Cuisine Restaurant so 
this is and it's glutinous rice with coconut and  
then some sugar this is sort of what it looks 
like before it gets processed into brown sugar
that's really good it's like a few different 
flavors and textures the coconut is quite  
strong and really good the strawberry 
I love sweetness so the sugar is good  
and then the chewiness from the glutinous 
rice like that is really good oh I love  
like the colors like the purple was 
just like glistening looks tasty  
oh look at that brown sugar taste what's really 
odd is the this like um the sugar topping it  
smells like just raw brown sugar on top tastes 
weird like just eating it raw but it works really  
good so we've got the babinka this has arrived 
it is a glutinous rice coconut cream and then  
sugar and then we've got topped with a salted 
egg and some treated coconut to dabble on top
whoa so bouncy look at this 
thing so bouncy and fluffy hot
honestly tastes like the most juiciest 
pancake I've ever had really good it  
is a little dry on the dry side I think 
with the Salted egg it definitely adds a  
little bit more flavor otherwise it's quite 
plain this is the vinca here we go foreign
coconut pancake it's actually really really 
good The Salted egg is quite salty but it's  
quite a nice mixture between like the sweets and 
saltiness quite nice balance we're at home Bakers  
which is offering up a puto cheese not sure what 
it is but there's like a little stool here at the  
mall that is um offering up a bunch of cakes 
and desserts and to add to the mix we've got a  
yima slice at Yama it's means of condos meal uh 
eggs and sugar oh I mean that sounds delicious  
sign me up for condensed milk any day of 
the week so this is the puto with cheese  
it is a steamed rice cake I'm noticing a lot of 
desserts like to have cheese in them here we go
looks like a cloud and the trees the 
trees work it works so well oh wow I'm  
really surprised by that it's actually 
really good right my turn with this puto  
rice cake you can finally kind of see that 
slice of cheese in the middle I think it is
the cheese idea the cheese works I actually 
wish there was more cheese in this it's so odd  
that I just want to have more so next up it's 
best chiffon cake they're filling It's Made
of and it's topped with cheese look at 
the inside I just thought like it was  
going to be almost like a cheesecake but 
it's an actual cake and now I understand  
what Prue was saying by the outside 
is egg yolk and Mel's ah so excited
oh that's really yummy 
there's really really good oh
the outer coating is so sweet and delicious 
I can't really taste the cheese to be honest  
the cheese gets lost but the cake itself 
and then the outer coated coating with the  
milk and the egg is just so so good 
so hopefully her taste buds are on  
track and I'm gonna like it too a little 
like layer of you know give me some more
home so confusing I get a little bit 
of cheese at the end it's almost like  
caramelly not my favorite of 
today but still really good
so for the next dish we are going to go try some 
very traditional Halo Halo which is a kuya behind  
me but this is a more kind of fancier chainsaw 
so I think they've got their own version of hello  
hello so we're gonna jump in there and give that 
one a try so this is Halo Halo the most famous  
Filipino dessert it's flavored with oh my goodness 
the eyes are so creamy and soft it looks so smooth
[Music] the ice is literally 
like ice cream it is delicious
oh that's so soft it's like almost 
like a gelato there's some Wizardry  
there was that they've done 
there with that shaved ice
cold really nice and soft and delicate compared 
to what we had um yesterday on our tour that was  
a little bit more chewy I think this definitely 
is your more upscale hello hello but definitely  
worth it mixed up we have electricity plan which 
is just an eggy custard dessert that you kind  
of see at a lot of restaurants even fast food 
chains has this so it does look really delicious
salt sugaring that is really good that 
is delicious kind of like a Filipino  
katsu creme brulee Vibe so this is made from 
condensed milk and egg white and a little fun  
fact that crew gave us is that apparently the 
reason why the churches last so long here is  
that they used to put egg whites in the water 
I don't know if that's true but let us know in  
the comments our last dessert treat of the day 
and we've jumped across the road from the mall  
to Oi Tahoe to try some traditional tahu which is 
silken tofu with tapioca and brown sugar I think  
130 peso here so he's just in this little 
little setup behind us and we're gonna go  
now try some of this delicious dessert to top 
off a fantastic day so apparently you're meant  
to mix this before having a set I don't know if 
I have mixed it enough but we'll see this Tahoe
Filipino breakfast it's got silken tofu 
caramelized sugar and tapioca balls inside of  
it this one's actually hot but you can get them 
cold as well but traditionally it's hot [Music]  
there's by possibly the nastiest thing I've 
ever had this was Scott's idea by the way  
it's almost so warm I guess warm tofu and a 
drink surely it can't be that bad one's up
oh what oh no it needs more sugar oh it's just 
like I feel like I'm drinking bath water that's
I can see why Haley probably didn't like 
this this is what you call a pit stop  
oh my gosh oh wow my bet oh here we go how's 
that Haley it's like a little spaceship isn't it  
oh this is so oh whoa what a day of amazing 
mouth-watering desserts we are pretty full  
but my favorite dessert today was the Emma 
Cake that thing was amazing and what was your  
favorite I think my favorite has to go to the 
was it put a bombong which we had at the very  
start that thing really surprised me sugary 
coconutty layered goodness with that brew

these kind of confusing desserts which we would
