Actually we have the keto or the regular one where you use the regular one. You know what? That's fine. Let's do the regular one. Yeah. 140 pesos. No problem. You know what? We're going to go with the regular one because I've been walking so much. I deserve to be a little unhealthy. You know? Now they're flipping the burger over here adding a little bit of black pepper. You can see it cooking nice. Ah, this one is the salt. I can tell it's already going to be a juicy, juicy burger. Is it okay if I come and watch? Thank you very much. Ah, so this is how it's made right here. We got the bun. We got the mayo. A little bit of cucumber, tomato, and kind of a little red spicy sauce maybe. I knew you wanted a bit of ketchup. Yeah, sure. Actually you know what? It's fine. What is that one? That one is ketchup? Ah, okay, okay. My mistake. Yeah. No spicy. It's okay. Thank you so much. So now it's ketchup, not spicy sauce. Thank you.

Because you have all of these condiments inside of it. Look at that. Packed. They literally packed this with condiments. Fat little burger. Now I would say the meat kind of does get a little overwhelmed by the condiments. However, nonetheless, it's still pretty delicious. And I would say my favorite part about it was actually the price. It was 140 pesos for a quarter pounder. Very good. Very good, especially in a place like this. Final bite. Great purchase, guys. Great purchase. Onwards we go. What is this? Ginger ale soda.

Please. A regular size please. Yes. Thank you. All right. I kind of want to wash all of that stuff down with a nice delicious juice. Super hot too. I understand. I'm very crowded. It's just getting more and more crowded as the day goes on. Literally. Sweating. I saw this juice stand. It was super busy and you know the rule whenever somewhere is busy, that's the place to be. Right? And this is where they make their stuff. You have all the stuff prepared over there? I actually liked the suggestion that she gave us. She said dragon fruit with mango. That's like literally such an exotic flavor. Right? Hello, hello. Komostika po. What do you guys have here? Thank you. Thank you. What is this? It's a black jelly. Oh, black jelly. Interesting.

Okay, brother. Salamat Paul. Yes. Brother. Travel Chronicles. All right, then we'll subscribe. Oh, thank you, Paul. Thank you. Okay, salamat Paul. Thank you very much. We got our little mango dragon fruit sort of juice. Mmm. This is probably the best combination of juice that I've ever had in my entire life. Mmm. It's such a synergistic sort of flavor. You got the two exotic fruits from Southeast Asia mixed together. I would say the dragon fruit kind of overpowers the mango, but... Mmm. I'm feeling very healthy. I'm feeling refreshed. What an amazing day.
