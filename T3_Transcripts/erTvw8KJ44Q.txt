 Welcome back to What's Up Philippines! We are back with another reaction video today. We are reacting to a video I've seen oftentimes on YouTube, but I actually have managed not to watch it one single time. Today we are reacting to... Five reasons Japanese shouldn't come to the Philippines. What? Yeah, exactly. What does that mean? Everybody should come to the Philippines. It seems to be very controversial. Need a sip of coffee. Okay, but... We get started. Yes. You're not yet subscribed. You better do it right now. And if you want to see some lifestyle and find travel vlogs head over to our main channel making it happen vlog which will pop up, right? Here. We like something to add. Would you like to add something before? Yes, I wanted to add that the title of this video is very, very controversial. I think it's a reverse psychology. Must be. Alright, let's see what happens. We're hitting pay, right? And now. It's me, South-Daw. It's me, La. Huh. Today's video is not a usual video because I'm so... It's a matter. Very high energy, almost like me at the beginning of this video. It's a matter! It's actually South! It's so good. Okay. I'm really... I went to the Philippines over six times. I got so many exfoliants. Okay. After I go back to Japan, I feel like I should not go back to the Philippines anymore. Every time I go to the Philippines, I feel like... Why? Hold on! Hold on! I think it's the opposite. Every time I came to the Philippines, I was like, I want to come again. And then, I want to come again. And then, oh shit, I just moved here and I live here now. Yeah, so that's what happened to us. So many feelings. So today, I'm going to talk about five reasons. Japanese people, you should not come to the Philippines. So much drama. And not this is good. And follow my Instagram. Classic YouTube. Big thumbs up for that. You're absolutely really big change. Because Japanese people are very shy. When we do something, we focus on it. And we don't care about other people, right? We only focus on school jobs. Sometimes, we don't care about other people. When we do something, we do like so silly actually. We don't talk about so much, right? It's a Philippines. It's totally different. The stuff is so cheerful. Like, how are you? What's your name? We are from Philippines. We are from Philippines. It's very very cheerful. And the soft friendly. I was so soft. We can agree to that. 100%. I do like... How are you? Have a great day. I feel like my face is changed. May you come back to Japan from the Philippines. Friends and family will be surprised. Because your personal face is more cheerful and friendly. So be careful. Also, my mom is very cheerful. Yeah, be careful guys. I'm afraid of her. Say, say, you have personalities changed. I'm so cheerful. That is the one of the ladies. You should not come to the Philippines. Nambok. Yes. You know what? It's the same with like Austrians and Germans. I swear it is the same. Austrians and Germans and the Swiss for that matter are very very conservative. So when you first come to a country like the Philippines everybody is so friendly and happy and tripy. The Austrians and Germans are like, NINE! NINE is so friendly. So for us, the very first time that we came to the Philippines and we spoke about this already many times. So awkward. We were in Koran that was like the first place that we visited for a little bit longer. And first, Nelia, I was walking through the island and we were like, Why are the people smiling? What do these people want from us? Something is up here. Why wants this person to help us? Why does the other person want to help us? What are they up to? Yeah, exactly. So the natural instinct for when you come from Europe, you just generally have this mentality of distrust. Like what does this person want to do something to me? So for us it took like a lot of getting used to and we had to change our mindset completely. But once you go of this mentality, you just... It's so nice. And it's so revealing. We smile more every day. It's like a sunshine day. Yeah, and when we travel back to Europe, oftentimes we're like, Hey! What are our pines? People are like, NINE! And for us it's really hard, especially when we go back to Austria and we come directly from the Philippines. We are super cheerful and happy. And this high energy that we have is not really something that Austrians are used to. So they give us that look. That look. The Austrian look. Yeah. But don't get us wrong. Austrians are really good people, nice people. They are just very conservative to people they don't know. So you need to build... You have to work hard on building friendships first in Austria. And you have to break through the hard shell. Look at us. We chirp you happy. You broke our shell. That didn't sound good. I think it's in a good way. Yeah. Let's continue. You cannot stand for the Japanese weather in Japan. We have four seasons. Green, summer... Oh! Lots of green. The Japanese weather is so cold. Same in Austria. Yeah. When we got outside, we were there so many crosses, especially winter. But the Philippines... Yeah. It's called the Onion Style. Yeah. You just keep on building these layers. It is a Philippines on Christmas Day. I had so many crossroads. Oh yeah. That was very unusual for us. Baby cut. I did not use it because it's so hot. I swear. You should really like... Peasha's not green. I think I've never worn long pants in the Philippines for the first year, but it's one of my own. I feel like more cold. I think it's little bit. I cannot wear it. I agree. A green hundred percent. We had this topic in one of our prior videos where we talked about the moms, the difference with the Asian moms. And yeah, every time we go back to Austria, we are freezing. But it's gone even further. As soon as we're here in the Philippines, and it's like below 25 degrees outside, we are like... What is going on? It's cold today. I don't want pants on because it's not over 30 degrees in Chicago today. I like... I caught up this morning when I thought it sounded like... Yeah! I need some more pants. When I'm in the Philippines, and when I'm on the beach, it's nicer but a beach. That was like a speed village. Yeah. When I go back to Japan, I feel like I don't want to go back to Japan. One time you got the Philippines weather. You cannot go back to Japan if you really like summer season. Same goes for Austria. And also our last trip to Japan was very, very cold. Oh my god, it was so warm. And I think maybe, maybe that's why I didn't enjoy it that much. It was raining. I need my... I need myself that's Philippines' sun. It was cloudy. Yeah. It was not what we are used to. Do I miss the four seasons of the year? No, I like it warm. If I want snow, I'll fly some with a snow for two days and then come back to the world in the Philippines. Thank you very much. I like spring though. Yeah. I like spring onions. Say more. Number three. You can get weight easily. Gaining weight, I guess. Yes. This is the big problem. You know? We were in such a good shape. We used to be fit. We had abs. Six pack. We were looking like athletes. Picture here. Now, not so much anymore. Because we just keep on eating and eating. And eating. And eating. And eating. And eating. Philippines. So many delicious food. We don't have Jory beef in Japan. You get a bunch of Jory beef in the Philippines. It's because it's so reasonable. It's so addictive. Also, we don't have that. Yeah, you have to be really careful with the chicken joint. That's the barait. Philippines food is sweet thousand Japanese food. Japanese food is not so strong fray bar. But that is true. That is true. Very intense. Yeah. So, if you really like Filipino style and western style, Yeah, don't get weight easily. So cute. In the Philippines, there are so many delicious fried pre-pinappin. We started Japanese Korean. Every time I go to the Philippines, I really enjoy eating. I did not stop eating. It's so soft. That's what we just said earlier. So, the funny thing is, I like what she said because I can talk to you related to it. Especially when you're in Manila, you can have any food in the world. Literally, we have like little Tokyo. We have a ton of Korean barbecues. We have the best ramen restaurant in the world, middle-coronavirus. And of course, the Filipino food and western food. We have every we even have an amazing French restaurant in Makati. French one. No raffles. Oh yeah, that is really good. That is really good. But that was a pricey one. Yeah, yeah. That great restaurant where our French restaurant, where our French friend spilled his soup. Hmm. Lips here. Japanese people. So many Japanese people, really like mango. Papaya. But especially mango, it's expensive food in Japan. Oh, mango juice. Papaya juice. The best. And Maras mangoes are the best. It's got so reasonable. Three mangoes. Three mangoes. You should not come to the Philippines! Number 4! You cannot go back to the Philippines! See, I told you it's reversed psychology. Yes, so true. And you know what, it's not just the mangoes. Everything you end up in the Philippines food-wise is so inexpensive. If you compare it to where we come from. Yeah. I mean, you can get lobster and shrimp and fish and tuna. It's expensive. Everything, all the amazing food at such a low cost. If you go to the seafood market later on. I agree. In Japan. In Japan. Oh, one more thing. I just wanted to mention, they went a video online where I actually bought a whole tuna this big for 400 pesos. And I... Okay, that's it then. Do you say it like that? Yeah. For the first time. For the first time in my whole life. That was quite an experience. Video will pop up right here. Thank you so expensive. Can we go to Lestran for lunch? One meal is all over. I agree. One thousand yen. Even in Japan. Yeah. Not that much. It's just over 500 yen. But the ends of the Philippines. So expensive. We spent a lot of money on our Japan trip. You can buy three meals at Joribi. Joribi is so reasonable for rice. One meal is... Mmm. And the transportation is expensive. Then everything is expensive in Japan. Usually in Japan, I take money a lot. So true. Everything is reasonable for rice. So you can not go back to Japan. Every time I go back to Japan, I feel like... Yeah, that's how I feel about Miami. Everything they was so expensive. Yeah. My friends. Nice. We have to check all these videos out. Yeah. So true. You can barely enter in one thousand pesos. Seems like she's in heaven. Yeah. She's very cute. Number five. I actually want to subscribe to her channel. Okay. I think we can relate 100% when it comes to expenses. We used to live in Miami, specifically in Miami Beach. And oh my god! You go to Whole Foods and it takes your whole paycheck. Yes. So... Not only that for me as a coffee drinker. Here in Shagawa, which is not an inexpensive place in the Philippines, my flat white costs 105 pesos right now. If I drink a flat white in Miami, it's 7 to 8 dollars. And then where you go to, that is just crazy. Yeah. It's really crazy. So... Sorry, I had to yell at you guys. I'm just very emotional about coffee I really am. Yeah! More fun in the Philippines! I'm going to go back to Japan. I'm sure. Every time I go to the Philippines, I feel like I'm in a Philippines. More and more. First time I went to Vagia. You know? For a long-age school. I feel like I'm in a Philippines. I think so. I think she wants to move here. I think she wants to move here. I feel like I'm in a Philippines. I feel like I'm in a Philippines. Oh! She likes Manela. And she wants to move here. And she wants to move here. I feel like I'm in a Philippines. I feel like I'm in a Philippines. I feel like I'm in a Philippines. I got sweet heart. Yes, she should. I'm holding it in the Philippines. That is my typical Philippines. Everybody is just smiling. I feel like I'm going to stay here. To its origin. That's how we felt. So we did. Yeah. I was very cute. The more prices I have. Very nice place in Sibul. I think I will get more fun in the Philippines. Yes, definitely. Japanese people are like. There are so many nice men here. Yes, in the Philippines. There are so many nice men here. Yes, in the Philippines. There are so many nice men here. It's a fast-forward flight. Yes, much less. Nice. Because it's so addictive. So much fun. It's a Philippines. Such a cool, fun video. Love it. Actually, so many of the things that she said, I can totally relate to it because it was the same with us. And we just fell in love with the country so much that we decided to move here. We've been living in Manila for over a year now. Start traveling to the Philippines around three years ago. And actually, on our main channel, we have a goal to visit all the provinces in the Philippines this year. Unfortunately, it's going to be difficult because what's happening in the world. But we're still trying our best to visit as many provinces as possible. Right now, I think we already have two-thirds of the provinces in the Philippines that we've visited so far. There are so many diverse places you won't believe it. If you have never traveled to Philippines, it should be on your bucket list. For sure. And don't just go to the touristy places. Go everywhere. Just go. Yeah. You won't regret it. So guys, thank you for the support on this channel so far. I can't believe we already hit 6,000 subscribers. But we have a big goal this week.
