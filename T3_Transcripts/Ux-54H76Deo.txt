Jollibee Fast Food has a cult like following in the Philippines
They just opened in Manhattan, NYC
(Jollibee song playing)
They waited for 20 hours right..
The first ones
They were here at noon time the day before
We opened at 8 o'clock the day after
What's up guys
Jon coming to you from New York City
We're at the happiest place in the world right now
Jollibee
Right next to Times Square
Adriana it's the first Jollibee in Manhattan
You've tried it before in Queens
How pumped are you for this?
I'm so excited to try this one
Guys I love Jollibee
So much..
And it's been just two days
And look at the line
We are on a long line right now
A lot of Filipino people are here
Supporting the big fast food chain of the Philippines
And I brought a special guest
Jacob Carlson
I'm excited I want to get some Halo Halo
The only time I've had it was the one time you and I went to Jollibee in Queens
It was good
But I want to get a whole one for myself
To try it out
Here's the menu
This could be one of the most expensive Jollibee's in the world
We're not sure
What do you want to order?
Why don't you ask them?
They can write in the comments
Let's see its..
7.49 for 2 piece chicken with 1 side and a drink
That's not to expensive.. for midtown Manhattan
Okay I think I know what I want
Spaghetti
This opened under pouring rain on Saturday
And apparently the first 100 people  got chicken.. for a year for free
Would you have waited in those conditions
No.. I mean I had the chance
But I didn't
I stayed at home
I stayed at home I was waiting until Monday
But it's a nice vibe
Very local feel here
Everyones curious what we're doing
We're going to make a good video
There's a lot of Filipino people here
Which is cool to see
Thanks for waiting
There's so much customer service here
This is awesome
So you said one spaghetti
With a soda cup
And then you said 3 piece with two sides?
Yes
Ok your total is $18.91
Insert your chip
Here you go enjoy your meal
Thank you very much
That may have been the best customer service I have ever seen
At a fast food restaurant
We had employees everywhere telling us where to go
The food came quick
We spent like 20 dollars.. and I've got to show you how much food we have
I'm so excited to be here right now
Guy's look at this feast that we've got here
Spaghetti.. Their mashed potatoes buried somewhere under that gravy
Chicken
We've got a peach mango pie for after
Some rolls .. somewhere here
My mouth is watering
Tasting the Spaghetti
I think I made the same comment last time
But what I like about the spaghetti
Is that you might think it looks like the Italian one
But it's actually sweet
And I really really like it
A lot
The manager here was very impressed
That I liked the spaghetti
She said i'm one in a million
That most foreigners prefer their spaghetti not sweet
And i told her
I think American Spaghetti is a little boring
I don't mind it at all
Trying Jollibee Fried Chicken for the first time
Very crispy
And I agree with Jacob I do like this better
Than KFC
Got some gravy here I can dip it in
If i'm feeling a litlte bit adventerous
Just a tiny bit right there
I can see why its.. the favorite fast food chain over there
Just the customer service and the quality
Again we spent about 10 dollars a person a huge feats right here
Man they really nailed it in times square
I'm telling you
I was talking to one of the managers here
And she said I'm going to fall in love
With the peach mango pie
Very excited to try this shortly
Eating some of this ube
Here we go
I mean its good
It tastes different than the halo halo we had at the one in Queens
Because its like.. its a lot less of the different ingredients
Other than the ice cream
It's good
I like it
Her reaction to the bread
It's super soft and super sweet
I thought it was going to be salty.. and a little bit hard
But it's really really nice
It's like molten lava
Ready, 1,2,3 , GO
That is a lot of peach mango
A ton of it in here man..
I don't know how they stuffed so much of it into this little thing
Soft and crispy at the same time..
This might be my new favorite thing at Jollibee
Not the fried chicken
Not the spaghetti
Peach mango pie
I may just stop in here if i'm in midtown for dessert to go sometime
It's that good
You're actually going to shoot it out?
Crash and burn
Okay I tried
Jollibee Everywhere
Guys there is still a humongous line outside
Mr. Carlson is still here
And we had just the most incredible dining experience at the only Jollibee in Manhattan
