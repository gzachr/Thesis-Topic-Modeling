Few more days in the Lajuan. Oldest university in Asia. I mean, wow. Okay. That's amazing. I didn't know that the oldest university in Asia was in the Philippines. Same. Oh, yeah. You can see it there. The sun, the field. Oh, wow. Even the church and the house people, sorry. Oh, the campus. That sounds incredible. That sounds so exciting. It sounds bigger than the university I went to. You should have seen me. The university is I went to. Everything is bigger. Architecture. Bigger. Like my author is really big, but does not have very much depth. More nature. But not well kept. It's a very good university. Yeah. Wow guys, who would have thought? Yeah. Taxi driver's parents actually went to the university of Santo Tomas. Wow. Deeply. This is my first time using the grab app. Oh, the first time. Yeah, congratulations. It's a good experience already. Thank you guys for recognizing. How expensive is grab bill? Because it looks very comfortable. Which area does it look? And comfort doesn't just come by that. Okay guys, I think it will also be my first time going to San Paulo. San Paulo. Another first for today. The university is the university belt. It's university belt. Okay. The university belt. There's lots of university belt. I don't understand why do you like to have to go to a background music when someone has a start. Is it the university belt? I mean they're getting paid for it. I'm okay. So what? It's very long ride. Yeah, okay. Almost there. So you see that. If it's a long ride, I think it's better to take a grab or a cab. Okay guys. I think so. Driving right next to the campus. Okay. The university of Santo Tomas. It's right there. Okay. I can peek into the campus already. It's looking very, very nice. You see a lot of green, a lot of grass, a lot of trees. That's what I've noticed in all the full of universities. But well maintained. You see a tiny bit. So I'm really excited about it. Well maintained. It's getting in there and exploring this place. It looks like a museum. It looks like a wow university of Santo Tomas. We've made it people. You've made it. The university of Santo Tomas. Santo Tomas. It's very, very nice. A lot of very old, very beautiful architecture. Check this out. It is gorgeous. It's feeling more cultural already. It's just walking around. Culture. Alrighty. It's an impressive campus. A lot of green. Look at this. Beautiful little tree right here. Beautiful. Oh, see see how well maintained is this. A lot of activity here on Kansas. A lot of other children play in games. This is how our university was. My university was. It was like huge. I was all full of nature, but not maintained. What's wrong? Oh, but we did not have any incredible activities except for the days. That looks bad ass people. If anybody knows what that is, please do let me know. It looks like some type of martial arts. Oh yeah. I even I don't know what that is. What is that, Barry? Wow. They're playing like two different games. It's so beautiful. Just look at it. It looks like there's a whole different place. You just came in a whole different country. Soccer here. They're playing soccer there. And I think they're playing like volleyball. Wow. At the end. This is big. Why didn't we have any of them? I myself have studied at university as well. I've studied at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam. My university was. Working in university in Beijing and the University of Slovenia in Philadelphia. And this looks really nice. Like compared to the Dutch universities, this is big. Is he Dutch? This kind of compares to the to the University of Slovenia. Like a lot of really, really old architecture. Oh, that's very big. I love that. Since it's old, I have always seen that ancient buildings have always been huge and architecture is so much better than today for some reason. The square, the center of the university. Center of the university. This is a very, very impressive building. Show, oh wow. It does look like a museum, okay? It does look like a museum. In Europe. You know, in the European centers. Yes. Even we have a lot of old buildings still there in the old city. And maybe one day I can take you guys there. Lost. I got a library quite often sometimes. Library is really old. I probably can take it there. University of Spain. Wow. Now in the first university of Spain, he's found all this thing. Actually, I did not know that. Wow. It's not a no-no-no. The first university of Spain. I would love to take you guys on tour to the old city. Once this thing goes away, okay? We're going. We're going. Internment camp. During World War II. Oh. My Imperial Japan. That is crazy. Yeah. Santa Thomas Interment. Before I could read, he just like flipped it over. Oh wow. There's a tiger. All right. Look at that. Everybody's dangerous looking tiger over there. Oh. He's actually scary. Yeah, I've had the school. No. Masked people? I don't know. Wow. It might be. But I like tigers, but I love lions. My favorite animal is like, I don't know why. They just look majestic to me. And cute. And they're lazy like me. Naturally, it's a no-smoking campus people. Of course. The people here are very responsible. Pancake house. Subway in a university. Shocking. Shocking. Shocking. No, believe this. USD has its own fast food. I know. I have never seen a subway in a... We don't even have a candy. Pancake house. Only Molly. They even have KFC. Whoa. I can study again. Just like studying in New York. I was just like this. That's amazing. No, I can't study again. Sorry. Like McDonald's. KFC and McDonald's are on campus here. I've never seen that guys. That is so cool. Same. None of the universities I've gone I have never seen that dude. But I know there's one university in... like there are a lot of universities in India who have that. I think I know why do you need to know that. Exactly names. Sorry. It stopped as usual. Okay, great. Hospital. USD hospital. campus is literally guy. It is guy Gante. It does look like a museum. He's read correct on that part. And then here you have these 17th century beautiful architectural buildings. I'm loving the contrast. Oh, let's just watch this. Wow. Which is such a perfect land. You know, it's so nice. Mixing the modern with the ice. Yes. Ooh. Wow, this is a very, very nice little mini park. Yes. Not sure what these things are. Very nice. It looks really nice. It's this symbols. I think so. I don't know what. But you're still hospital. Another really nice and old building. Old hospital. They have. Minuses have their own hospitals. They have their own malls. Very old. This is so beautifully. Oh wow. Uniform. Is it? A lot of medicine students chilling there. Eating something. They need to eat. Studying for the next big exam coming out. They need to eat. These guys are going to be saving our lives in a few years. It's. I always love the architecture. It's ancient, the amortine and simple. I love that. You should have seen ours. So it's quite grand here. Yeah. Just come here and see. I'm not a comparison. Old American University. Like the Ivy Leads. Ooh. Beautiful little statue. Or I should say a beautiful big statue. Basically, yeah. Building. I couldn't read. All right people. That is the commerce building. Looks a little bit more like that. Which makes sense because I studied commerce myself. I was science student. For some reason they always put commerce in the modern buildings. We never get the nice old cultural historic buildings. Maybe arts people get that. I don't know. Because science people didn't get it. The UST has its very own church. Church. Which makes sense considering it is a Catholic university. I have seen that. The church is also in a very old. Xavier's here has its own church. Not filled up. Botanical Garden. They even have a botanical garden. None of the universities that I have attended. Yeah. I've had a botanical garden. We've had. Yes. We have a, we have a had it. Since the World Science College. You know what cities are. We've got gardens right now and it is so beautiful. But I was a zoologist too. So peaceful. This is a place where you can have a little walk. Unfortunately I did not just study botany very well. I took selfies in that lecture. I know what it's like. Believe me. It's done too many exams in my lifetime. Sorry. You're going to get through that. Yeah. You're going to get through my guy books. Just like I got through too. High school. UST has its own high school. And look what is going on here. They're having some kind of fiesta or something. Oh. We always have some curriculars going on. It's so much fun. Entrepreneurship. That's amazing. Nice. Senior. We used to have like food fest like that. I think it was a good job at gathering people. I don't know what. You know. Like there's selling some kick-ass pouches right there. Senior high school students. Yes. Already being entrepreneurial. Trying to start their own business. That's amazing. That's amazing. That's amazing. Everyone should be taught that. They're going to make it big. They are going to be the business man of tomorrow. I want to be. And just like that people. I have good. From one side of the UST. Wow. It's literally like he is in a whole different city. UST City. Spanish. Exactly. I had no idea about it too. Yes. All the statues and pretty sure they're mean. Exactly. They're meaningful. The university. All right. This was a really really beautiful. Just look at behind him. A leech university. A leech university. It gave me a very very good impression. Okay. It reminds me very very much of the universities in America. A really really nice campus. Oh wow. Very historical. A lot of beautiful buildings. So many facilities. I see that person in the back. They have their own botanical garden. I mean that is amazing guys. So anyway guys, I hope you're doing it. This little exploration of the university of some of the people. There's this guy in the back. I have already, before I started this video actually. Then all of them. But I have need to make sure you have done that for me. Fine. Wow. People. Peace out. Check you later. Just wow. Like. Wow. Universities have their own malls. They have their own hospitals. Insane. Insane. Is this, I know since there are elite universities. But are they like really expensive to study in this universities? Or there is a quote where you know, you get scholarship and some people who are like really intelligent can get it easily. Because I personally have studied myself in all government college and government university. So my fees was not even like a fees. Because well, I work hard to get into that kind of university that I don't have to pay much. I don't want to like get donations and stuff like that. And well, my parents already told me that if you want to study and whatever you want to study, you have to work hard and get into the universities and colleges yourself. We are not paying anything to you. And so I think I chose it that way. And maybe that's why I never had a good university. I don't know. Next to my university, there was a set of university. It was amazing. We had the same canteen like in college, in my college, but not in university. In university like it's pretty big, my university. But for the college thing, we had an accept university right next to us. And a lot of foreign students who were studying there, I remember that. They were really hot older guys and girls. There I just like think, I wish I can go to university like that. I am not an engineering or I took science but I took biology. So yeah, they do not have that course. So I couldn't. Anyway, I wanted to go to zeviors because that's much better than what I went to. But then again, zeviors did not have human genetics, which I wanted to take. So human genetics was only like in two to three colleges. And others were like where you have to pay donations and private colleges. LeRma was good. And you have to pay a lot. So I chose to study hard and get into a university where I don't have to pay much. But yeah. So basically maybe that's the whole reason I got a university where I have not half of anything here. But is it really expensive or you can get in one scholarship? Let me know. I would love to learn that. And if any of you have gone to the university and I'll see you guys next time. Bye-bye. Music
