(upbeat music)
- I can't see you.
No, I literally can't see you.
You can see me, but I can't see you.
At Delish Deli, grabbing
a bit of food real quick.
Gonna be heading off to run some errands
for Delish Deli and more, so come on.
Time to go find the car.
So on our way to the Good Cup
to get some more coffee beans,
no matter how many I buy,
they seem to keep running out.
You're a coffee drinker or a tea drinker?
Tell me in the comments below.
So I've been getting more
and more messages from you guys out there.
I know a lot of you want to, (chuckles)
of course stupid Google's gonna talk.
Bye Google, we got a vlog
A lot of you are wondering
when things will open up here
and I got to say, that's
one of the challenges is
that the Philippines hasn't
shared any information
for people that want to come
over here, either as a tourist
on vacation or for people
that wanna move here.
I'm hoping that things open up
soon, but I gotta be honest,
I've really given up any
hope of guessing on a date
when things might open back up again.
I know for me, I'm really
looking forward to being able
to do a trip back to California
for a few weeks to be able
to see family and friends,
and some of our clients there.
But I also look forward
to when I'm able to travel
around the Philippines more.
I've only been a few
places since I've been here
even though I've lived
here more than a year now.
I'd really love to see a
lot more of the islands
and some of the other cities there.
Let me know if you've
traveled to the Philippines,
where's your favorite
place that you've been?
So I've been seeing a
lot more YouTube videos
that are like Jollibee versus KFC.
I don't know if you've
heard of Jollibee before,
but in the Philippines, it's
as popular as McDonald's,
it's basically everywhere here.
And it's starting to show
up a lot more in the US.
I know when I lived in California,
there was just a few
different locations that I saw
and it was mostly by Mang
Inasal, or Red Ribbon,
or some other Filipino
brands that have started
making their way more
and more out to the US.
But if you haven't tried
Jollibee, I'm a vegetarian,
so I don't eat much meat,
but a lot of people say
that Jollibee is a lot better than KFC.
So I'd be curious if any of
you have tried both of them,
let me know which one's your favorite.
(engine revving)
So we're back to the Good Cup,
let's grab some coffee real quick.
(cars running) (horn honking)
I'm gonna check out what we're gonna get.
Hi, how are you?
(soft upbeat music)
What are you gonna get, secret camera man?
- [Camera Man] Beans.
- They're the magical fruit..
- [Camera Man] Toronto.
- Nice choice.
Let me get one kilo.
(man talking in foreign language)
(laughing)
So we got Sidamo today.
We'll check it out, heard a
lot of great things about it
and there's always free cup of coffee.
Let's keep going.
(car door shuts)
Trying to figure out how
to use the camera on my own
for a little bit for the first time today.
We'll turn down the air
conditioning so you can hear stuff.
So I was probably a little bit loud,
and I'm trying to figure
out the auto-focus
and a million other things.
Let me know how I'm doing.
You know, I've had this channel
for about six months or so
now, and I really want to get
to know who's watching more, who you are.
So if you haven't already left a comment
or if we haven't already
talked on Facebook
or somewhere else, I'd love it
if you would leave a comment
below and let me know
where you're watching from
and what you get most out of this channel.
It's really a privilege being able to live
over here now at this time.
But life, as an expat, life
as a foreigner has its own set
of challenges as well.
If you ever lived in another
country, you know, for you
and I, if we jumped in the
ocean and we start swimming,
we really notice we're in
a different environment.
We notice we're in water because
it's impossible to breathe
but for fish, it's just
another day in the ocean.
Moving to the Philippines or
to another country is a lot like that.
If you come from another
culture and then you step out
of the airplane and, you know,
you find yourself surrounded
by other people that
look like you perhaps,
or kind of like you, right.
There are other human
beings, but that's maybe
just the only thing you have in common.
There's so much to culture
while living in another country
that truly takes time
to learn and adjust to
and to really start to think
about alternative ways of
looking at the same exact thing.
(calm music)
Is this person from America or something.
Whenever I hear a honking drivers
I know they're probably expats.
I'm guilty of it myself
here a little bit as well
because Filipinos tend to
be pretty patient drivers.
Crazy, but patient.
It's always so busy before
getting ready to hop
on a plane and travel
somewhere, especially overseas
or at least that's always
been my experience.
And whenever I get on the plane,
I'm finally able to just kind of sit there
for a moment and gather my
thoughts and really take
in just the feeling of, this
is another chapter in my life.
This is another big change.
This is, you know, something
that once I step off
that plane, my life
will forever be changed.
What I didn't expect is that
three months after moving here,
the pandemic would happen.
I noticed that the way Filipinos react
to challenges in life,
seeing the way that they
go through those tragedies
and then comparing that to my own culture
in the US which was debating whether
or not people should wear masks in public,
and, you know, a lot of other things that,
really people here didn't have the luxury
to debate those things.
They were just trying to make it
through very real struggles in life.
And I think that was one of
my first highlights of living
in another culture and seeing
how dramatically different
my own culture compared to
Philippines culture would handle
something like the pandemic.
And I'm grateful for the
lessons that I've learned.
(calm music)
So we made it up to Busay area.
I always love to get out of the city
and see a new area around here.
So come with me, let's go check it out.
(car door opens) (calm music)
Not a bad view, right?
Sorry if you hear all of
the noise in the background,
they're doing a bit of construction here.
I had hoped to be able
to travel so much more,
but with the pandemic, I've
really been stuck inside
a lot more, so one of my favorite
things to do is to head up
in the mountains here, just
outside of Cebu city, as often
as possible.
See bit of green, see a bit of trees,
see a bit of mountains
and breathe the fresh air.
So one of the other things
about the Philippines is a lot
of people come here thinking
that the cost of living is
gonna be really low and
it certainly can be.
It depends how you decide to live here.
You could either live in
one of the houses like these
that are quite expensive,
beautiful, up on a hilltop,
or you could live in places
that are maybe $100 US a month.
So there's a huge
difference, obviously between
where you live, what you're
going to get, the amount
of space, how safe it is,
how comfortable it is,
whether it has air conditioning or not
but there's definitely something
in the Philippines for every budget.
(calm music)
So another thing to get used
to living in the Philippines is noise.
Right now I could hear a saw going,
I could hear a dog barking.
A short time ago I heard roosters
and Bon Jovi is cranked up
by the people over here, pretty loud.
You know, if you're a foreigner
living in the Philippines,
noise is a way of life.
So depending on where you live,
it's gonna be quieter or noisier.
You know, a lot of
people, one of the reasons
why they'll spend more
on a condo or something
that's a little bit more
remote on an Island is
because you can control the
noise a little bit more.
You don't have video karaoke going loud
until 3:00 AM in the morning.
But I think that here,
things like noise is taken
a lot differently than many
places where you might live.
So if you're considering moving
here, think about the noise
because it takes a while to get used to.
It is hot today.
It was raining earlier,
but you could really feel
the heat sometimes, once the rain stops
and the sun comes back
out, you really feel it.
Let's go back in the air conditioning.
Rover's taking in the views, smart dog.
(calm music) (car door opens)
(car door bangs)
So back at the office
now, time to drop off some
of the coffee beans at Delish Deli.
(whooshing)
Here's some more beans from the Good Cup.
Take care.
So one of the other things about life here
for me as an expat is
having a business here.
When I first came here, I just planed on
starting Purple Cow Agency and
then as the pandemic went on,
we started Delish Deli here as well.
So many other expats come
here and they're retired.
And so they don't have to
think about working each day
and different things like that.
And so I think my experience as an expat
in the Philippines is quite
a lot different than a lot
of other expats here
who are living the life
that I look forward to
living in the next 10
or 20 or so years, once
I'm able to finally retire,
but work and work culture
is a lot different
in the Philippines as well, there's a lot
of other videos that I've
spoken about this topic on
and I'd encourage you to
look at some of my playlist
if you're interested
about starting a business
in the Philippines.
(whoosh)
We just thought we got some quiet here.
That's us stopped and
now we got the one there.
Welcome to life in the Philippines.
I'm so happy to be here
with all of the craziness,
with the pandemic, with
everything new to get used to,
with the roosters and the
dogs and the size and the,
the everything here.
There's still nowhere
else that I'd rather be
than right here in the Philippines.
As always, thank you for taking time
to listen and take care.
(calm music)
