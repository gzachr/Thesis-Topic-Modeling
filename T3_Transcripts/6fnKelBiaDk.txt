 Good evening guys, welcome back to Juice React's late night reactions. In this video, we are acting to something big different. It's a vlog. It's five reasons why Japanese shouldn't come to the Philippines. Now this video has been popping up on our YouTube recommended. A lot of people are reacting. Weeks. Other people are reacting to it. Lucy actually has spoken to this girl on DM because we started watching some of our other videos. But we haven't watched this one yet because we wanted to watch it with you guys on this channel. We have no idea why Japanese shouldn't come to the Philippines. It's quite a statement. Or why anyone shouldn't come to the Philippines. I mean, I assume she's not saying it in a bad way. Yeah. But it's quite a statement saying an entire country shouldn't go to an entire other country. If you're new around here and you're wondering why we're talking about the Philippines, we actually are based in Manila. We're right here now in the Philippines in Manila. So this is like relevant to us. So let's see what she has to say. Five reasons why Japanese... She's so funny as well. Why Japanese shouldn't come to the Philippines? If you haven't checked out our channel, go and check it out. She's very, very entertaining. Ready? Okay, let's see what she's got to say. It's me, Salafjabal! It's Malar! Huh? Today's video is... I love the editing as well. I know me too. We're the cut. She doesn't see anger. No, I just do like cute and sweet. Today, I got so many X-Filiens. After I go back to Japan, I feel like... I should not go back to the Philippines. What? Every time I go to the Philippines, I feel like... So many feelings. So today... I feel like this is going to be a turnaround. Yeah. I feel like she loves the Philippines. Yeah. I think she does. Or you should not come to the Philippines. We've never had any bad experiences here, really. Before this video, please have a scribe. I'll turn there and follow my Instagram. Done. Done already. Manahalo. Number one. Your personality will be changed. Oh, okay. Japanese person is very very shy. Mm. Okay. Okay, okay. Cool. This is going to be a good video. We've been to Japan and we can tell a difference, actually. Yeah. We only focus on like... school jobs. Sometimes we don't care about other people. It's like a head-down kind of thing. Do your own things. We don't talk about so much, right? But in the Philippines, it's... ...today... She suits the Philippines. Yeah. She's really open. Oh, yeah. Oh, hi. Yeah. We are your friends. Sorry, true. It's why we love Filipina people. Maybe very chill. No. And a soft friend. I was so surprised. Camera friendly as well. And then, God, there's a Philippines. I do like... Oh, hi. Have a great day. I feel like... Oh. What did they change? Maybe you come back to Japan from the Philippines. Friends and family really be so friends. Interesting. Your personal views more cheerful. So she's been like... ...bought out of a shelf by the Philippines. That's so nice. So nice. Mommy's very surprised because... ...everyday I go back to Japan. She's saying... ...your personalities changed. I'm so cheerful, Pasa. That's so... So nice. So nice. I feel like we're... We're happier here, aren't we? Yeah. Look, Gem... Gemry. Are you open? Yeah, could you? You cannot stand for the Japanese weather. In Japan, we have four seasons. Same. We love to connect. Yeah, sure. We can't accept Tamah. Japanese weather is so cold. Sometimes you can feel cold. Same as you can. We relate. We can relate. We wear so many cruises. Especially... We were cold and we went to Japan. But it's a meaningful thing. And we didn't have any warm clothes. Yeah. Where's our old ear even? Pretty much. Because when I went to Japan... Who knows when that was it could have been one of five? Is this Christmas day? Yeah, I think. From Japan. Like, heavy cut. I did not use it because it's so hot. I see. I'm dripping. I'm happy she is. She's like... It's nice watching her videos. Yeah, it makes my own. Yeah. So much. Every time I go back to Japan... I feel like more cold. So I think it's a little bit. I cannot stand for the Japanese... She was really nice when she replied to her message as well, right? Really friendly. Summer season. When I... In the Philippines... I feel summer season all day. I feel like... Apart from rainy season. Yeah. So when I go back to Japan... I feel like I don't want to go back to Japan. One time you got the Philippines weather. You cannot go back to Japan if you really like summer season. This is second reason you should not... Three more reasons. That would be second reason. Yeah. Oh, that was right. Three. Okay. You can get weight easily. True. A lot of nice food. Oh, many delicious food. We don't have... I knew this was going to be a positive video. I just didn't think it would be like a TV show. That's right. She loves to live in a city. Oh, that's right. It's so addictive. Also, we don't have net market except for... She's like Filipino now. Yeah. I've driven not a long amount of time. Japanese food is not so strong-fraver, but the Filipino food is a little bit stronger-fraver for Japanese. So if you really like Filipino style and western style... Yeah, I can't get weight easily. But I don't care. It's a bit easier. Stay healthy, though guys. Yeah. In every food, we went to little Tokyo today. In Japan. I cannot stop eating. So fat eating. You're so funny, so what? You're really like mango. We got mango right there. Same with UK, isn't it? Yeah. Not yet, but we're on. Oh, she's been a baggy, oh cool. She is not saying that, is it? She's so funny. What? What? Okay. Yeah. That's true. Whenever we go back to the UK, we're like, what? We're on Japan. We're buying coffee. Oh, Japan is a bit worse. For you, yeah, yeah, yeah. But the Philippines, if you have 500 yen, you can buy three meals. I'm actually not sure if you can buy three meals. Her currency is jollybemills. One meal is 100 pesos. It's very good. Mango and a sourced cheese as well without the other name. Everything is expensive in Japan. Usually in Japan, I take money a lot. But the Philippines, everything is reasonable price. That's why you cannot go back to Japan. Every time I go back to Japan, I feel like, it's so expensive. If I pay. I'm supposed to stop title. That's a lot of effort. Yeah, fair enough. I wonder if she added herself. Maybe, yeah. It's great editing. It's funny. Yeah. For ABS video, which is 1000 pesos change. Look at that damn. Nice. And more. That was so hard to spend 1000. Oh, hard to spend all of it. Every single is reasonable. When I spend 1000 pesos at the night market, I put so many food and I get so 75. I love it. I need to watch some of other videos. So I'll make it. Enjoy it. Enjoy it. Yeah. 1000 pesos. Yeah. 1000 pesos. It's a lot. But if you put that amount of things, it's costable or... Hard prices. It's not that bad. Yeah, true. Same as you pay. That is last one. You have too much money in Philippines. You feel, don't want to go back to Japan. Oh. So it's more fun in the Philippines. They do say it. True. She loves Philippines. That's so hard. So nice to hear. Everything is good for you. You feel like you don't want to go back to Japan. I'm sure. Every time I go to the Philippines, I feel like I love Philippines more and more. That's how we felt when we kept coming back. I love you. For long-age school. You're okay. I feel so nice, country. And I got so much fun. And then, I went to Manila. I feel like I'm so nice too. And the south time, I want to eat more in the Philippines. I want to see more beautiful place in the Philippines. I got sweetheart from Filipino. I'm 49 in the Philippines. But the Filipino is so kind for me too. So I feel like, oh, I want to stay here. So it's so dangerous. Because she doesn't want to go back to Japan. So, Philippines too. You get all its so addictive country. I have never loved me to say something. She's got a lot to see. Has she? She's got a lot to see. I think I will get more fun in the Philippines. So scary! I think she's been scared. It's been 20 years people nearly like life. There are so many life menus. You can enjoy eating too. It's not far away from Japan to the Philippines. Four hours. I want to go back to the Philippines again. It must be like a greenery scene for us in the U.K. It's like a close country. Because it's so addictive. And you got so much fun in the Philippines. Flareus. That's so nice to watch that. Lucy and I have been through ourselves within the last year and a half on our vlogs. On our main channel and the juicy vlogs. But to hear it, we've never sung that up in one video ourselves. But here's someone else kind of sum up basically reasons why they love the Philippines. It's not really reasons why Japanese shouldn't visit. It's a good title it got us in. But yeah, really, really nice to see that she loves the Philippines so much. Because we're pretty much going to agree with every point she's sent. Yeah, it's just nice. She's funny. She's sweet. She loves jollybeer. It would be cool to know you. Yeah. Bump into her one day. Absolutely loves jollybeer. As foreigners in the Philippines ourselves, we can agree that people have been super welcoming to us. Yeah. Extremely. We speak about this a lot in our videos. And there's so many reasons that we chose to base ourselves here in Manila while we love the Philippines. We spoke about that before. We're going to watch some more of her videos but we'll do that maybe in a separate video. So thanks for watching guys. Leave a comment below on anything you want us to react to. Please give the video a thumbs up. Subscribe if you're new. Notification bell on. All that good stuff. And I'll see you in the next juicy reacts. Goodbye guys. Bye.
