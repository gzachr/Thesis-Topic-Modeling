Commonly kind of sold on the street. More street food, yeah. People go around with these huge like metal containers. Yeah, we tried it at the spiral buffet here in Manila a while ago, over a year ago. But with fans, we like it, so let's see what these strangers think of it for the very first time. Are you ready? 3, 2, 1. Oh my god, I'm so scared. Oh, what? Scared. Hey, we've just got one with everyone. Me, because of our fat. Let's look at it with my eyes. Like, maybe. That Cafe Angela called us back from the Howa Howa video and they said, hey, Shama, it seems like the strangers in New York City really enjoyed the Howa Howa video for the first time. And I was like, yeah, duh, it was great. So they were like, okay, well, how's about we make you some Tahoe and you bring it to them to try. And I was like, Tahoe, I've actually, you know what, I've never had that before. So, we're made up. This first time as well. And we've seen this guy's been a few times a few times. I'm excited to try this today because I've actually never had Tahoe before. It's really kind of rare here in City. Oh my God. It's so beautiful. It's really delicious. It's nice and like, warm. But if you didn't know what it was and it was handed to you, it looks unlike anything else. So I can imagine people might be a bit hesitant. What's actually made of, like, beans. Oh my God. It's good, guys. So we made up a bunch of little Tahoe, little, many Tahoe's and we're just going to take it to people of heart and see what they think about it. And if you guys like watching, see us filming, you're subscribed and let us know what are the videos you guys. We want to be featured on this channel. So, hmm. Alright guys, it's going to be us people to Tahoe today. Thanks, audience. Bye! And if you guys want to check out this, Angela's, they do actually make great actually. But let's go. Angela's.

We've honestly found Filipinos living in New York City. Yeah. Who maybe haven't had it for a little while. And they make it very action. Yeah. If it brings back any memories or. Hey, here we go. I like the texture. I don't know. Oh, shit. It's weird, but it's okay. Why is it weird? It has more like a texture to it. This is like a lot of people are saying the texture is not sweetness. It's not a thing in America. People are just like really. I felt like today we're very weirded out by the like the texture. And like, it's like, you know, it's not really like a thing in America. This type of food. But you know, people tried it and they actually were surprised by the flavor. So that was really cool. But then yeah, you give it to Chinese people. They're like, oh, we've seen this before. But it's cool that they liked it as well. See you next time. Bye. Bye. Bye. Cool. Cool. Interesting. I always love to see people's reactions. And you kind of, once you start watching stuff like this, you realise why people enjoyed seeing our reactions or doing still- enjoy seeing our reactions when we try new things. Definitely. From like their culture or a different culture or something that isn't our own. True. And also, but we found ourselves watching the other day. People try British food. Yeah. Yeah. There's a girl in Singapore trying British fish and chips. Yeah. And we were like, that's interesting. Now we get why people enjoy it so much. Food is such a cultural thing.
