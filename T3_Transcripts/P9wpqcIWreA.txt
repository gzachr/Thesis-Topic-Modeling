Okay, what was your motivation? The first time that you decided like, You know what? I can make it back. And then you just made it back. Like, what was your motivation? What is the process behind? Well, the process was really... It took me here before I developed my first ever product. But it was actually fulfilling and awesome. The first bag I did, I felt that you like doing it. That's why I named it Pakilig. So the Kilig is the first bag that you make it. The first ever bag, yes. I think as long as you like what you are doing, there is nothing really more towards it. As long as you like what you do. As long as you are not doing anything, harming any of it, any people with your dreams, just do what feels right, just do what makes you happy. What is your most soul back? The Kilig. Oh, Kili! Okay, what is the process? Can you explain in simple words for our simple murders? How to make it back? How do you make them? But don't give a lot of details that people can copy and reproduce your problems. Okay, so you formulated in your mind think of a really cute, awesome design. Where you create a design too, like you draw the design. Yeah, because... I took up fine arts in college. Oh, yeah. Because I like drawing ever since I was young. And then I knew in the back of my mind that I would be doing something with my hands, literally, when I grow up. So this is what I'm doing now. And I've never gone back to what I've been doing before. Yes. So everything is perfectly curated and done with your hands. Yes. Alright, so any questions are you going to answer?
