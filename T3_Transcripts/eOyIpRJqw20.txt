good morning everyone welcome back to this lovely 
day here in panglao island that's where we are  
exploring today we have found on google maps 
some food park so we're gonna go and check it out
we've just turned up at the full park now 
and it looks really new really modern there's  
some live music playing but we're gonna head in 
check it out and see if we can find some lunch  
didn't expect it to be like this
so this is like a big huge food park 
there's like a lake in the middle  
and then you can like walk around there's a bunch 
of different types of foods all the way around  
so we've come to paradise indian and mexican 
okay the music's just stopped but we didn't  
really film too much because music was quite 
loud i had a chicken and gravy and kelsey had  
a chicken chicken masala it was actually 
really spicy the woman did say to me or  
a little bit spicy and i was like yeah my chicken 
ticket with all the loads my mouth is on fire  
towards the end yeah i'd recommend coming down 
during the evening because i bet this place is  
absolutely rammed or seven eight o'clock we've got 
all sort of like fairy lights going across as well  
so imagine there's a bit of an atmosphere 
especially with a singer but we are going  
to head to the next spot now and check that out 
it is highly rated on the sort of list of things  
to do on the island so it should be good i think 
we're in a really nice area here where the food  
park is because there is a gated community just 
behind us and the house is really really nice
okay so we've come to hinagdan and cave
already we've just got some tickets 
we just come through the entrance and  
you go some down some steps 
literally to the cave into the cave
whoa
i was not expecting this like a 
proper property so quiet in here
you can hear the box
this is so cool
this place is awesome
let's test the water
oh it's not actually that cold 
i thought it's gonna be freezing  
there are people swimming you can't 
pay to go swimming but we decided
to hear the plan to see them
probably you can't see it on the camera 
i can't see on the camera they're tiny  
it's actually really warm here as well quite like 
humid i thought it was going to be a bit fresher  
because obviously it's enclosed so there's no 
actual sunlight or anything but yeah it's really  
warm in here and it smells a bit funny as well 
but we're gonna head up now i'm gonna see what  
else we can find nearby it's definitely worth 
checking out it's pretty cool it's very unique  
you don't really see that everywhere i think we 
came at the right time because there's loads of  
tour vans turning up and you're only allowed 50 
people in there at once and you're only allowed  
to stay in there for a maximum of 30 minutes 
even if you are swimming they could do putting  
some more lights in there if anything because 
the formations and stuff are really really cool  
if you couldn't see them that well i think if it 
was lights in there as well it'd be awesome yeah
so a quick four minute drive from the caves is 
pango beach and it looks like a little fisherman's  
beach got loads of fishing boats all the way 
down the beach and in the sea so definitely  
a local fish man spot maybe not somewhere you 
would come specifically for a dip in the sea  
just a quick stop at the beach we're gonna head to 
panglor town next just have a look around yeah we  
feel there's a market there too so we're hoping 
that we'll be able to pick up some nice fruit  
okay so we just checked up the market but there 
wasn't much there so we didn't didn't film  
anything couldn't pick up any fruit or anything 
no we've come to we've grabbed a couple of drinks  
from the 7-eleven and we've come to this spot 
which looks as if it's gonna lead us to the sea  
and there's a few sort of monuments landmarks 
there's a big church it's like a little park  
isn't it yeah it's actually quite cool 
pretty relaxing it's like it's a nice  
a nice change really since manila we haven't 
really seen any like parks or anything
just come back to our room now i don't 
think we mentioned as well that the  
electricity came on about two o'clock or one 
o'clock in the morning yeah the other day or first  
day here so and it's pretty much been on since 
i think it went off for a few hours in the night  
last night but apart from now has 
it yeah so it's actually been fine  
yeah now you can see it was really good value 
for money yeah really good value for money to  
be fair highly recommend this place as 
well it's actually a really nice place  
i'm sure once the electric is back stable it'll 
be a little bit more pricey than what it is more  
money probably yeah but yeah really cool we're 
just gonna have a chill evening tonight and since  
we've got this kitchen area we've just picked up 
just some noodles we've got some snacks and stuff  
we'll probably just like watch a film chill out 
yeah we'll see what's on this we have actually  
used the tv so we'll check it out see hopefully 
there'll be some english channels on there  
and we need to book yes we are gonna have a 
big night planning tonight we're gonna plan all  
the way up until the end of the philippines and 
book a flight out of the philippines to the next  
destination to the next destination a few hours 
of past since the last clip we've literally just  
been doing some work and chilling out i managed to 
edit two videos so catching up a little bit there  
but um yeah we haven't done much else to be 
honest we haven't even had food yet and it's  
what almost eight o'clock well it's one 
year later we've got one one one day left
and then we head to the next destination 
which i am really excited about because it  
was somewhere we weren't planning on actually 
coming or going uh during our stay here in the  
philippines but it's been recommended a lot in 
the comments so much so when we checked it out  
we were like yeah we are deaf and that they 
go go there yeah there's a couple of places  
that we've sort of uh decided not to go because 
although they were highly recommended as well and  
we wanted to go before coming to the philippines 
we've decided that it's a little bit hassle to get  
like there's there's different 
requirements you need or  
the flight days look ridiculously expensive 
so we've sort of changed our minds on those uh  
which means that we will just have to come back 
to the philippines at some point in the future  
just to knock those those few places off really 
we're gonna end it here thanks for watching give  
us a thumbs up if you enjoyed it subscribe if 
you are new around here and we will see you again
you
