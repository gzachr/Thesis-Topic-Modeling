 That's a 40 climb too big. Yeah! So I take out the safety piece, why? I'm sure it's not right. It's not all his or... It's a lot of getting angry. I'm getting moody. It wasn't getting jealous, but this is my woman. Hands off my woman. That is incredible. You be good girls and boys. My and my dad, I can be my friends. We're off on vacation. I'm back back to travelling again. This time without the car we're going to go completely from the house. To our destination using transport in the Philippines. Trices, bikes, ferries. You're going to get on it. You know the water, someone's water's sleeping. It's not ours is it? Our water pressure has been low after check. Okay, you're not coming, you ain't got a passport. As usual, we're running a bit late on the Philippineo time. No other time, but Philippineo time. Only joking, of course. I'm always the one that holds everyone else's attention. I'm not going to be able to get on the boat. I'm not going to be able to get on the boat. I'm not going to be able to get on the boat. Only joking, of course. I'm always the one that holds everyone else's attention. Up, up. I'm always the one that holds everyone else's attention. Jane and Isabella are ready. Long before me, I take so long getting ready. Must be driving my hair. This is like Indiana Jones or something. Step on the wrong one and dance fly out or something. Oh, I need my foot. You're trying to get business already, is he? What gives us away the backpacks? That high-good look. I feel like a sleep. I think everyone's in a bit of a grumpy mood. Much change. Hi. Hi. I'm Caram. I'm Caram. I'm just going to walk out from under the sky. I'm just going to walk out from under the sky. I'm just going to walk out from under the sky. Just a curly gate to go outside in the land. Let your work out. Let's ride that. Yeah. Sunny days, sunny days, sunny days. No clouds in the sky. A way feels like it's better for a compact. Sunny days, sunny days, sunny days. All the stress and doubt. Yeah, not today. Feels like it's better for a compact. Yeah, sorry. Don't call me, because I'm going to be on bread. I had a 40 climb too big. Yeah. So I took up the safety plate. Surely that's not right. That's not a little pizzer. Only joking. I did take up two spaces. My bags. Go ahead now. Over full mark. Okay. Okay. Go ahead. What's the quick then? Yeah, it wasn't bad. Not too late after all. It didn't actually cost the war because he knows that you were... Tampok. Tampok, you trying to say? Yeah. You trying to say I'm Tampok? Yeah. It's been two years. Two years came to Ormock from Saboo after poverty. Ormock. It's really nice park. It's really changed. Last time we did this, it was a face mask and face shield. Doesn't it? Yeah. Like Martin the Stormtroopers, you two. You're backpacks. A little bit less luggage this time though. Yeah, so we were here last when James sister went back to Switzerland. We didn't actually go inside the building before we used to go inside to say goodbye. And now you know what I mean. Unless you're actually going to be using the port. Nice day, thankfully. A lot of Venus today. I say it's going to be a good day for travel. Whatever happens in life happens. So, Terminal 3 is first day soon. So we're ready? In a boarding. Not yet. She will become one with machine. Witness in you. Three to terminate. I'll be back. To the hotel on the board. It's like coming back again in reverse. Gambats is the boorin. We're going to be back. We're going to be back. We're going to be back. We're going to be back. We're going to be back. We're going to be back. We're going to be back. We're going to be back. We're going to be back. We're going to be back. We're going to be back. We're going to be back. We're going to be back. We're going to be back. We're going to be back. We're going to be back. The end. It's a bummer. The end. The end. The end. The space of space is familiar. It's about a member to all but this is a... This is a tall and normal. We came here four or five years ago. No. Actually it's not tall and normal. We sent this to Boop. Five years ago we went to a hall. Remember we did this. Five years ago. You were 10. 10 stone. And it's easy. How many stone were you? 50. It was five years ago. Two five years and then 18. We went to a hall. Time out. Alone at beach. Remember to walk alone. There's really really busy here. First time we was okay. Just on three hours from almost Zibu. If you find here. I got pizza. I heard the Hawaiian. Hawaiian? The Hawaiian.

There's the butter's cooking cream. The center there aren't no. A lot of people have bored already. I just stay here all day and eat these to be travelling. I just have a break from the ferry. Before the next one. Good to travel by sea. The first time ever I felt a little bit seasick though. I think it was hunger. It was quite wavy. Quite a lot of rain on the way in. Maybe not used to it. Maybe I haven't got my sea legs. That's definitely wine, green. That's definitely Bucca Pandan. You okay with that? Let's go. Jesus, no teeth as always. This is Bucca Pandan. Should we all online? It's nice but sweet. That was really nice. I can be paying lots of dollars for this one though. I can kick that doughnut. The butter was white. This is better than dunking. The cheese temer is a butter basically. That's when we were here. I had a massage from one of my mother's life. I'm getting angry. I'm getting moody. I wasn't getting jealous but this is my woman. Hands off my woman. She's in a white room now. Are you American? I'm not American. German. I'm not German. German. German. Who's German? German. German. You're interested in fat.
