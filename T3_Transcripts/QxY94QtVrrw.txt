Lisa, Lisa or Jane Lisa is more idol type When I ask my Korean friends They mostly say that Lisa is the most beautiful girl in the Philippines She can learn to have a role in the Korean movie Not on drama But on movies and dramas Drama should be looked friendly In our real life Movie can be from the brain features Lisa, I already answered this right? Yeah, that's the reason why I chose K-FIN She is the one who fits best in the Korean beauty standard Mamein-dosa Actually in Korea, even though they had plastic surges before or not The entertainers, there are a lot of pretty girls Their appearance is, I think, confined to beauty of Asian So I think Mamein-dosa Different beauty For Korean standards Yes, right? In Korean standards Jane is more of a first-generation Like, their first song of Christian Yeah, that's right Cheongcheon Now that you've seen these Filipino celebrities What do you think are the ideal standards of beauty among Filipinos? Big eyes, big eyes Kind of curved eyes, from the silk hair Long hair I think it's personal Mediocre What? You're Korean? First and foremost, I noticed that their skins are all good So I think that's kind of a similarity with the Korean standard of beauty I don't know if Elle showed us so many variety They all have the distinct charming points So hard to summarize into one Because everyone showed different attractive points Even though the Filipino is located in the Southeast Asian part They have been influenced by so many western countries Like America and even from the Spanish I think their ideal standards of beauty is with big eyes I think the eyes is the most important Like, looks deep, could be tan, or could be white tan Long hair I don't know why Long street hairs Also sometimes the big wig Yes, they're the big ones They prefer the long wig Big and long wig Because in Korea, they're all good The first love of the Korean brand is long hair Long hair I'm not sure about skin But this one is in the Philippines Not in the Philippines But they're all good They're all good Because the Korean brand is all good They're all good They're all good They're all good Korean idols The Korean brand is all good
