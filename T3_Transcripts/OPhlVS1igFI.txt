Good afternoon my friends and welcome back to 
another video here in the beautiful country of  
the Philippines. We're going to be heading right 
in here to Cafe Roo which is open 24 hours. [Filipino] my  
friends. How we doing? Good uh good place to visit 
for Sunset. Yes. Can you see the ocean from here?  
Yes, sir. Okay that's perfect we came to the right 
place then so this is Cafe Rue you guys are going  
to Cafe Rue too it's a good place and you go

Paulo Paulo my name is Mac nice to meet you Paulo 
this is new yes sir okay just opened uh one month  
ago no uh open until Friday last February last 
February okay very nice well that's fantastic  
yeah guys I just ended up here completely 
by chance I was walking around in this area  
decided to go down this it almost looks like a 
pedestrian-only street and uh then I was like  
this place looks like a Vibe you can see the 
lights up top and you can see the ocean from  
here and I was just thinking like I only have 
so many days in Manila I gotta find somewhere  
with a good Sunset so it must be pretty busy here 
because the elevator takes a little bit to get up
what do you think go with the the black one or 
should I do avocado for up there you don't know I  
don't know either all right I'm thinking avocados 
to move then yeah thank you thank you very much  
all right so it looks like we got to select 
what do you guys think karaoke or Cafe rule  
I think I'm thinking Cafe Rue okay 
here we go do not press the red button  
welcome to Cafe I go again all right 
oh this is the most unique elevator  
I think I have ever seen it's basically a 
platform guys that brings you straight up  
is why it took us a little bit to wait for it
the avocados are more fitting for Cafe room
we're going out this way okay
push this one and we have a ride so we've got 
a cocktail bar over here oh this is a vibe  
and then inside it looks like we've got a 
coffee shop over there all right Cafe roof  
it's got a pH out there oh r-o-o 
pH wow that is creative Cafe roof
there's a doorway that you can take photos 
of we got the Marshall sign here photoism  
we can even take a little uh booth there and 
here you can take wow you don't want to step  
through that on accident oh but you can see 
the sunset right over there hello my friend
[Filipino]
all right so we're at the cafe roof
just like that one brother yeah there you go we 
got we're gonna watch salamat kuya here we go  
here we go so there's uh what's the good stuff 
to get here hey uh a coffee or food or what do  
you usually what do people get here yeah yeah okay 
maybe coffee first then food okay perfect you're  
going to have cocktails all right so we're getting 
a little bit of everything now yeah and your name  
John John the man from Manila yeah perfect perfect 
John well what do I I can sit wherever yeah No  
Reservations yeah oh perfect all right thank you 
so we'll find a spot right up at the top here  
we've got a uh a nice photo booth photo ISM and 
uh it seems like the good views are here como esta  
hello and let's see here maybe uh 
where's the best spot I'm thinking  
where's the best views my friend this one's 
the spot right down here perfect okay so as  
you can see here we've got views of Papa John's 
and hey ah a nice comfortable chair right here  
we've even got the outdoor air conditioner 
coming this way Carl yeah nice to meet you  
Carl my name is Mac okay thank you thank 
you brother um I'm thinking uh could I  
please have to start out just a mango uh 
smoothie or Manny oh sorry yeah same thing
and then a a bottle of water and then 
maybe I'll get something else in a bit
yeah yeah just a good still 
water yeah from the bottle please
oh is that the mango shake thank you very much 
oh that looks perfect wonderful salamat kuya  
okay we've got the starch side of 
the straw it looks like a coffee  
at first glance put that thing right 
in there and Let's test this thing out
wow that means very good delicious that is 
fantastic it tastes like pure fresh natural  
mango in here because you know some of the 
times the reason why I explain it like that  
you're probably like well of course it 
tastes like that it's a mango smoothie  
sometimes you get a mango smoothie that's like 
flavored like mango but it's not actually mango  
it's like a bunch of random stuff put 
inside that tastes like mango but this  
is literally like full-on mango with maybe 
a little bit of sugar in there and some ice
iOS iOS my friends very good but let me 
tell you that that is refreshing after  
walking around all day much delicious smoothie 
okay so can I pay with a card or only cash  
okay inset all right all right then 
I'll pay uh I'll pay for uh Hey Brother
all right brother uh there's a tip 
for you but I'll pay I'll pay this  
inside yeah all right thank

heading out we're gonna pay inside 
right down over there with the card

hello brother I just gotta pay the 
bill please Bill uh I just got a 115.00
350 okay
thank you
so guys the for me to get a smoothie and 
a water here came out to about 350 which  
is just about six dollars I would say with a 
conversion and look at this this is crazy it's  
literally Friday Saturday and Sunday it's 
open 24 hours uh hello waving to each other  
through it we got the fast moving elevator 
coming this way and we'll be heading down
very good uh yes it's very nice salomat
goodbye my friend take care 
Wesley thank you Merry Christmas
really nice people that was amazing 
okay we're back here's our buddy
my friends until next time 
hey brother see you next time  
okay we're back on the streets of Manila here so 
we're gonna head down this end see where we end up  
yeah guys so it is a Friday night here in 
Manila tonight so I'm sure it's gonna be a  
little bit more wild outside a little more energy 
at this hour I'm just surprised that some places  
stay open 24 hours so we got a big restaurant 
there looks like golf maybe inside of there  
golfing and eating some local spots here to eat at
oh good we got chi mac oh that looks good 
brother maybe another night Chi Mac right there  
I like that
salamatikuya
and nice people nice people but uh not sure 
that I'm gonna be stopping there tonight
all right looks like we have stumbled across 
Korea Town here so we got a nice big fountain  
in the middle and massages, restaurants, barbecue 
okay okay this is the place to come if you're  
nice and hungry then we got massages here too 
they've got the massage stands all over we got  
something going on here got the got the tree 
here brother well don't hurt yourself with that  
I'm loving the lights all around there hello 
hello okay ice creams shakes we are cruising  
through this area I don't recommend going 
down dark Alleyways but this is where we're at
guys I just stumbled across 
Robinson's Place Manila
not sure what to expect finding here but seems like 
maybe a big set of like malls or shops 
restaurants something like that so we're  
gonna go inside and uh check it out seems 
like it's really really busy hello brother
thank you thank you very much my friends we're in 
the mall so it looks like we're gonna have to do a  
little taste testing here some of these things we 
got going on in here are similar I've seen Jamba  
Juice all over and look at this mall wow we got 
Starbucks I think that's a Filipino classic right  
there and this place is just fully decorated ready 
for the holidays here wow yeah guys I have no idea  
what to expect walking in here I basically just 
saw this mall figured there might be some snacks  
or something I want to try and who knows maybe do 
a little shopping if I come across kamosa kakuya  
perfect perfect yeah you know slowly slowly 
getting better and better at interacting with the  
locals we've got the dessert kitchen we've even 
got some good stuff uh being cooked up over there  
I'm gonna survey at the whole place check out the 
mall first and after that then I'll probably get  
some snacks I don't want to throw up the stomach 
on the first thing I see you should never choose  
the first thing you see when you enter the mall 
so I'm just so surprised guys I say this every  
time I go to a mall all over the world like 
Auntie Annie's a lot of the brands we are like  
restaurants and things you just see them in every 
mall all around the world but I will say that  
this mall does seem to have a different layout 
generally than what I usually see in malls but  
we shall see because we're going to explore 
a fair amount of this I don't know if it's  
connected by like big hallways or how this whole 
place works but we're gonna walk through and uh  
have that question answered so we've reached 
another corner of the mall here oh that they're  
living the life there those massage chairs look 
pretty nice it all looks like most Romanus hello  
oh maybe it looks like there's a 
bit of a wait for the good ones
the big ones are already taken 
maybe I'll come back after food
I don't know why for some reason 
whenever I see a massage chair I  
have to do it or a massage outside 
oh we got someone yelling hey hey
a hey for a hay but uh yeah we shall see I'm 
thinking we're gonna go down this way and see  
what we see it on here I mean there's literally 
everything this mall is a maze when we first  
walked in guys there was escalators that would 
bring you to the top and then I walked through  
all these tunnels and now we're at a completely 
new area to be exploring so we've got food all  
along this area we've got the famous Jollibee 
right there I don't know when I'm gonna go but  
I'll tell you I will definitely go on this trip 
to Jollibee but I want to make sure that I got  
a nice big appetite for this spot and okay 
yeah guys you were literally getting a full  
walk-in tour with me right now because I'm just 
literally trying to figure out how big this mall  
is and then check out the shops we've got cakes 
right over there chocolate rolls yum yum yum  
and a little mini Wendy's to go honestly that 
little double right at the end Double Cheeseburger  
looks absolutely delicious for the taste buds but 
we're going to uh not have an American food here  
we got Pizza Hut there too wow Nick danklands 
I'm in McDonald's over there uh the world is  
becoming an absolute Melting Pot of Cuisines 
cultures and everything okay all right now  
we're getting to the discount stuff we've got 
some stands right over here socks oh some nice  
Rings it looks like see what they've got festive 
little markets over here uh-huh okay all right we  
might have found something cool here then we've 
got Gina's accessories hello okay okay I see you  
have some nice bracelets here that might match 
I'm looking for something to replace this one
okay uh how does that look s like okay 
okay I like that like this one but how  
about the smaller chain brother this one 
yeah because this one I got from Amazon  
and I like every piece of jewelry I have to 
be from the country that I'm visiting foreign
okay so uh what are we what are 
we charging for this one brother
okay all right well can I pay with a card no 
no card all right only cash then all right  
all right well I'll do 400 then if I can't 
pay with a card okay 400 we got a deal yeah
okay yes sir are you a future subscriber yes  
oh that's perfect I love that so what's 
what's that it'll be right there brother
You Can Count Me In oh thank you the man thank you 
so much brother yes thank you so much see you guys  
thank you very much I appreciate it okay okay we 
got ourselves a brand new bracelet right there  
guys 400 so that comes out to roughly I want to 
say almost eight dollars like seven dollars and  
it's gonna basically replace the other bracelet 
that I just got so good price I'm happy with it  
okay basically what I was saying guys is uh about 
my jewelry it's like each piece of jewelry that I  
have on my body has come from a different country 
like this one I made in Bali this one came from  
Egypt this one is partially Jordan partially India 
and parsley Lebanon this one is from amazon.com  
and then that's why I just replaced it with the 
new one which is obviously from the Philippines  
so that will basically uh conclude our jewelry 
here and that means everything I have is from  
a different country and there's our friends down 
there salamat my friends I really appreciate it  
yeah they've got this mall absolutely so so lit up 
so I'm happy with the purchase probably could have  
negotiated a bit more but uh yeah I decided 400 
that's a good deal as long as it doesn't change  
colors if it changes colors I'm gonna be upset but 
I think they uh told me it's not going through so  
yeah guys great purchase in here and we're gonna 
continue exploring this mall see what we find here  
can even pick yourself up an electric guitar okay 
okay you know we've got the avocadoria.ph I think  
we're gonna need to make a stop here you wanna 
know why guys because uh we've got the avocado  
okay okay so I think everything here 
is avocado wow oh that looks fantastic
my friend so I figured uh today was the the 
right day to go get the avocado because on  
the inside we got avocados oh yeah so I think 
we're gonna have to flip that thing okay I  
think uh what do you think would the avocado 
have probably need the avocado lover avocado  
lover today but I think we'll try the eight 
ounce it can still be an avocado lover with a  
smaller one yeah we've got a bunch of different 
options here the avocado mango Jackfruit Chico
Ah that's how you say it okay which one did you 
get avocado lover too did you get the big one okay  
it looks delicious so Filipino people love 
avocados yes yes it's one of the favorites  
yes brother can I please have the avocado 
lover eight ounce okay just a big one then yeah
uh Melvin Melvin yeah nice to meet 
you Melvin okay so we're gonna get  
this thing loaded up so that that was uh 
some sort of sweet milk okay milk and then  
we got crushed crushed biscuits yum and 
this is your recipe ah yes sir okay good  
man that's great and then we got the 
avocado ice cream where are you from  
I'm from United States oh and my first time 
in the beautiful country of the Philippines
it's a very beautiful country great people here 
so it looks like we're making a couple layers  
here wow we've got of course an avocado on top 
of the avocado I love that thing oh yeah it's  
nice Melvin's hooking us up and a little 
more cream up on top and finish it up with  
the United States roasted almonds U.S oh okay 
all right Melvin's taking care of us we've got  
Filipino United States partnership right here am 
I going to Discount because I got the avocado nut

oh this is tasty let's see if we've got a spot 
to eat it anywhere up very delicious enjoy
thank you
oh guys I'm gonna get the avocado all over my face
there was no seeds to eat it 
if I can do it while walking
okay I got literally avocado in my nose 
we shall nowhere to sit around here  
all right guys the avocado hat is now 
making me eat avocado ice cream so  
apparently Filipino people love avocado and 
I mean it makes sense the fact that I was  
able to find an avocado hat and then there's 
literally a full stand of everything avocado
that tastes nothing like 
avocado it literally tastes like  
just like a really sweet type of ice cream I don't 
even know how to describe it but like when you  
think of avocado you think of like avocado and 
toast or like you know like what Aussie brekkies  
have you know I'll just have for breakfast and 
then you also think of like guacamole which  
is like obviously a form of guacamole and then 
you taste this and it's like a sweet enjoyable
flavor and this is the big one 
because they didn't have small  
ones and this one cost about 120 which 
is roughly like two dollars and 10 cents
but it's super good because pipe and not 
only get that sweet creamy flavor but you're  
also getting that crunch from like different 
layers that are in the cup and it's so tasty  
oh I really like that crunch down there oh 
that's almost got like a a caramel coffee taste
yeah that bite literally tastes like you're 
eating an ice cream cookie that's so freaking  
good now that is g triple o d go uh guys once 
we get further down in the bites you actually  
have the cookie crunch in there and then you have 
like the little pieces that are like what's used  
in bubble tea so you get a chew to it you get 
like every texture when you have one of these  
ice creams it's literally almost like a meal it's 
so good there's our buddy Melvin Melvin Melvin
thank you brother
so guys it looks like over here you got virtual 
reality there virtual reality is taking over  
down here we have time zone taking fun to the
