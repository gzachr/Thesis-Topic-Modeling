guys welcome back to PINOY PLANET so
today I'm gonna cook tuna sisig!
Sisig is one of my favorite dishes and
this time I'm gonna try with a tuna
steak so for those who are new here I'm
a Filipino food vlogger from the
Netherlands and I cook and eat Filipino
food and I travel the Philippines so if
you did not watch the previous video I
made a chop suey Filipino style chop
suey you can still watch it here or in
the link below okay guys so let's start
I heated up the pan and I'm gonna add
some cooking oil okay so I'm gonna fry
these tuna steaks
so first I said I gonna use century tuna
from the Philippines but I thought let
me just use these steaks because these
are really nice quality steaks and I
want to try these for making the tuna
sisig. What part of the tuna do you like
most which one is good for barbecue for
example I think in the Philippines they
also like to use the tail okay so let's
flip them over I'm gonna just fry them a
little bit on each side
while these tuna steaks are getting
cooked I like to make a shout-out to my
friends in the Philippines
the Dutch Pinay Couple thank you always so
much for watching the videos and I look
forward to seeing you again in the
Philippines if not done yet guys please
check out their channel the Dutch Pinay
Couple they have lots of nice videos
they are based in the Philippines so
please check it out those tuna steaks
by themselves already smell good
okay I'll leave the tuna a bit raw inside
at the moment cuz they're gonna cook a
bit more ok so let's add some lemon
juice
I always love the combination of lemon
juice and fish I'm also gonna add some
salt or asin, asin pa more... okay
guys it's time to add the Chili Peppers
I have red and green chili peppers here
put them all in this dish is so nice I
really like it that's why I'm making
many types of sisig as you have noticed so
I'm adding in the garlic, Bawang somehow
the Sun is going away again and becoming
a bit more chilly here in the
Netherlands the weather is always
changing anyway let's try to finish this
dish soon before it starts to rain please
let me know which dishes from your
region in the Philippines so that I can
cook it next time I have already a whole
list of food to cook so the next one is
gonna be puto Calasiao and also
halo-halo but if you have any other
dish please let me know so that yours
will be next so next it's time to add
the onions guys, sibuyas
hey and there's the Sun again sometimes
we have four seasons in one day okay
guys so it's time to add mayonnaise this
time I'm using a full fat mayonnaise not
the yogurt base mayonnaise because the
tuna it's a little bit more dry has less
fat so full fat mayonnaise
almost done guys I gotta add a little
bit more lemon juice by the way is there
anybody here from the Netherlands I
think I did not ask that question before
it would be nice to see your comments if
you are based in the Netherlands
look at pogi and he's always there when I'm
cooking
hello pogi, pogi. I made tuna pieces a
little bit smaller so that they get more
crispy and now it's time for plating and
I like to taste it some nice tuna
sisig for you guys, green peppers red
peppers onion garlic nice fried tuna
with mayonnaise
there it is guys the tuna sisig let's
taste it next time I will cook the puto
mmm really good
different than the pork but also very
nice thanks a lot for watching guys see
you next time with more Filipino food
