all right I have moved to BGC in Metro Manila 
and in today's video I'm going to explain the  
five reasons why I made this decision and yeah 
well I'm explaining you the reasons I will show  
you around my new neighborhood I have just moved 
into an Airbnb in this street over here I'm also  
going to show you my Airbnb in a minute but yeah 
let's have a walk around and let me explain the  
five reasons why I made the decision to move here 
until the end of the year actually so for the next  
how many weeks are left like six or seven weeks 
so I'm very excited about this decision and yeah  
the first reason let's start right away is because 
I am missing having a daily routine when you are  
traveling full time and constantly being on the 
road your life is everything but not routined and  
yeah having a daily routine may sound boring 
for some people but if your life is without a  
routine for yeah basically for three years I'm 
traveling full time for three years now now and  
yes sometimes I have to say I miss having a daily 
routine you know like waking up in the same bed in  
the same apartment every day not in a new place 
every two three days knowing your surroundings  
knowing where you can go for dinner for lunch for 
breakfast where you can get good food where you  
can go grocery shopping all of this uh is part of 
having a normal daily routine and usually I don't  
have that so sometimes I really miss that and 
connected to that point is also and the fact that  
I miss having a normal life sometimes especially 
like things like going out with Friends Meeting  
friends when you are traveling full-time and 
you change to a new place every two three days  
it's really hard to like build a friend Circle 
meet new people and then hang out with these  
people build friendships stuff like that and the 
reason or one of the reasons why I decided to move  
into this street because I have friends who are 
living in this street so I can or I am able to  
go out with my friends here have dinner with 
friends have a beer with friends some days  
it's just like normal life you know without 
being constantly on the go every two three  
days and yeah you will probably see at least one 
of my friends in one of the next video probably  
and yeah let me turn the camera around so 
this is actually this is hello oh hello hello  
I think the policeman just 
wanted to say hi to the block  
um actually to be more precise this area is 
McKinley Hill which is right next to BGC so  
but still part of Metro Manila and what 
I really like about this area is we have  
everything in walking distance we have uh many 
restaurants here this is Pizza Hut not the best  
example but there are many restaurants around the 
street here we have some supermarkets here there's  
a Watson here there's a little food market which 
oh which opens up in the evenings and then yeah  
the city center of BGC is like a five minute taxi 
ride away from here so I really like this street  
so yeah my apartment is in one of these buildings 
there are several uh yeah big condo buildings here  
and over there is also a big mall the Venice 
won't canal wrong canal canal how you pronounce  
that canal in German the Venice mall is over there 
with also many restaurants shopping opportunities  
supermarkets stuff like that all right and let 
me show you my apartment before I will talk  
about the next reason let's have a quick look at 
my new home for the next weeks so welcome to my  
humble little home so all right yeah there's a 
small apartment but basically everything I need  
um I have a little kitchen area here I have a 
place where I can cook my own meals I have a big  
fridge right here sitting area Kettle microwave 
some instant coffee here and then the bedroom  
one double bed here little couch area there's 
Wi-Fi which is uh very good actually after  
spending two weeks in shiagao where the Wi-Fi 
was horrible like almost not existing it's very  
nice to have proper Wi-Fi again and then yeah I 
have a working area here where I can sit down do  
some work some editing stuff like that and then 
yeah The View to the to the main road here so we  
have just been down there walking down this road 
here and I can yeah see the the road from here  
and then uh a little bathroom nothing special 
about that just a standard bathroom with a shower  
and yeah we also have a gym and a pool 
right here and I can even see the pool  
from the window here so the pool is down there and 
yeah this is going to be my home for I rented this  
from Airbnb for three weeks now and then yeah I 
either will extend this room or maybe I will move  
to another Airbnb in this area and yeah most of 
the airbnbs in this neighborhood cost between 30  
and 50 US dollar per day and yeah let's talk about 
the next reason reason number two is I am actually  
a little bit tired of traveling um when you are 
traveling so much and for so long I'm doing this  
for over three years now and yeah sometimes you 
just get a little bit tired of it and I feel I  
am at this moment at the moment where I'm not as 
excited about it anymore than I should be or than  
I was before and that usually is a sign for me 
okay I need to take a break stop traveling for a  
while and then I will feel more excited again for 
upcoming Journeys because sometimes in the past  
weeks I was yeah exploring like super beautiful 
Airway us beautiful beaches or nice sceneries  
and I'm driving through there I'm walking through 
there and I'm like oh this is nice yeah okay but  
nothing too special and then a few days later I 
I look at the footage the videos that I filmed  
or I looked at pictures that I took and then I'm 
realizing wow this looks so amazing and I didn't  
really realized or appreciated that in the moment 
I was there and I had a couple of these moments in  
the past weeks and that is a clear sign for me 
that I am just a little bit tired of traveling  
so yeah I will stop traveling for a while now 
I will not stop making YouTube videos just stop  
traveling around I miss having a home like this 
for a few weeks and I'm very sure that then in  
a few weeks I will be more excited again for new 
Journeys I had situations like this before usually  
I take a little break and like every three year 
round every three months I would say the last  
time I had such a break was a in early August 
so yeah over three years three months ago and  
after that I was excited for the new journey into 
the Philippines so yeah that's reason number two  
a little bit tired of traveling but that will 
change after a quick break here and yeah before  
we continue with the next reason I would quickly 
like to tell you about a travel Gadget that I have  
been using for over one month now a sleeping 
mask and this sleeping mask helps me to get a  
really good sleep in the night I am someone who's 
usually a very light sleeper so for example when  
the room is not completely dark in the night I'm 
having a hard time to fall asleep and for example  
here they are not even curtains here so there's 
light shining in all night here the room is quite  
bright in the night so the sleeping mask helps 
me because it does totally block out any light  
and it's also very comfortable to wear no pressure 
on the eyes and to be honest I don't even feel the  
mask anymore when I'm wearing it and yeah getting 
a good sleep is very important for me because here  
I'm over 30 now I really feel it in the morning 
when I'm not having a good sleep in the night I  
feel that I'm not as energized as I should be and 
this mask is also quite helpful for example when  
you're traveling in buses airplanes trains and you 
want to get a quick nap and you travel during the  
day it's bright outside you can just put on 
the mask and it's blocking out all the light  
and the mask that I am using is from a company 
called Manta sleep and they are also sponsoring  
today's video they offer several different types 
of sleeping masks you can check it out all on  
their website I will link it down below and they 
also provided me with a special 10 discount code  
for my subscribers if you use the code Canada 
checkout you can get 10 off and they also have a  
60-day money-back guarantee so you can test out 
the mask without any risk if you don't like it  
send it back and you will get a refund click 
the link down below thanks to Manchester for  
sponsoring today's video and now let's continue 
with the next reason and yeah the next Reason by  
the way I really like to have a couch area are 
in my room sometimes just take a little break  
here from the day but anyway the next reason is 
I want to get back into a sport routine I really  
miss going to the gym working out feeling fit when 
you're constantly traveling it's not really easy  
to get a really sport routine many of the places 
where I stay don't even have a gym so I'm really  
happy that here I have a gym inside the building 
there's a big pool outside so I'm starting to get  
back to into a sport routine now usually I like 
to go working out in the morning even before I  
have breakfast so the past days I went to the gym 
at 8am did a little bit running on the treadmill  
then some very light weight lifting nothing heavy 
not trying to be a bottle Builder now just light  
weight lifting and after that I'm going swimming 
for like 15 minutes so I get like a 30 45 minute  
complete workout done in the morning and then I'm 
having breakfast and yeah I really miss going to  
the gym because when I was living in Germany me 
I was basically in the gym every single day I was  
really into this uh yeah Fitness mode working out 
every day and I really really felt good my body  
felt good during that time I felt energized and 
I miss having this feeling so in the past days  
I was trying to get back into the sport routine 
and I yeah I want to do this in the next weeks  
also trying to lose a little bit of rate a little 
bit of a stomach so that's my goal until the end  
of the year getting more fit losing a little bit 
of weight and just feeling more healthy and then  
reason number four which is actually connected to 
the sport reason eating healthy I wanna get into  
a routine of eating healthy food again so you can 
see here we have fresh fruits and vegetables over  
here which I can buy in the supermarket right next 
door and I really enjoy cooking my own meals these  
days you know I normally only stay in hotels where 
I don't have my own kitchen so I'm not really  
um able to cook my own meals most of the times but 
sometimes I really miss cooking for my own when I  
used to live in Germany I was basically cooking 
every day my own meals eating out in Germany is  
very expensive especially I was a student back 
then so it was way more affordable to cook my  
own meals which I really enjoyed every day I 
cook my own meals so I really want to get into  
this routine of yeah cooking for myself cooking 
healthy because yeah when you are traveling so  
much it's sometimes not easy to really take 
care about proper nutrition imagine when you  
are traveling a long day and you arrive at 
your hotel after Sunset you are tired and  
then I usually just go for the next best option 
and if it's a fast food restaurant next to my  
hotel then yeah I end up there and also if you're 
always in a new area you don't really know where  
to get decent good healthy food you don't know 
the restaurants so I have to yeah get to know  
everything new every few days and then sometimes 
it's not so easy to yeah eat healthy and take care  
of proper nutrition which I think it's easier when 
you actually cook your own meals so that's why I  
really enjoy doing exactly that so that's the 
next reason I want to take care of my nutrition  
of my food eating healthy and cooking my own meals 
hello hello shout out what's your name Paul nice  
to meet you nice to meet you shout out to other 
people hello hello okay I'm just saying I okay
shout out to all of you okay what's your 
channel it's Ken abroads right away on YouTube  
well I'm also on Tick Tock now yeah
I started my Tick Tock a few days 
ago where are you from uh Germany  
what's your Ken k-e-n-e-n and you should 
search for Ken Philippines okay yeah and then  
here we go you can abroad that's kind of broad 
here that's me and subscribe thank you very much  
okay have a good evening bye and here you can 
by the way see all these high skyscrapers here  
I think it's one two three four five six seven 
eight nine around ten different buildings here  
and yeah these are all um condo Apartments and 
yeah by the way if you are really looking to stay  
in this area long term you can get the apartments 
way cheaper than the prices of the airbnbs here  
um I know it because my friends have 
Apartments here so I know what they  
are paying per month which is way lower 
than the cost of my Airbnb for example  
so you can get Apartments here for like four or 
five hundred dollar a month which I think it's  
pretty good because I really like the the area 
here the location the big mall right next door all  
these all these buildings have a gym have a pool 
so uh yeah everything you basically need right and  
yeah then let's talk about the last reason the 
final reason and that is I want to get to know  
the BTC area more in a video like one month ago 
I already talked about that I'm thinking about  
maybe moving to this area next year so I made the 
decision to do this already now but still maybe  
next year whenever I feel like I need a break from 
traveling I think this might be a good area to to  
return to to yeah settle down for another month 
or two whenever I feel the need of yeah I need  
a break from traveling now so I also want to get 
to know this area more so in the next two weeks  
we will explore around I will make videos around 
this area not only BTC but also like Metro Manila  
in general I would like to explore new areas 
of Manila where I haven't been to before just  
getting to know yeah this huge capital region of 
the Philippines a little bit better let me know in
