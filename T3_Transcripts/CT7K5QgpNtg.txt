 There is one more bdj Shae! Diana looks like freey It's like, she talks about... Oh, it's nice. It's a drive-in. I have no idea. It's a bar, it's not a bar. Oh, it's wire. I don't know. I don't know. She's my friend. She's not my personal friend. I know her fiance. Where? I don't know. We have to try to figure out that Jason. What? Family? You know, I think so. Did you force? Oh, I think her daddy's leaving her. Here. Ah, her childhood, not the eye. It's not about the family. And it's about her dad leaving her when she was young. I just understood why. Back it means a lot right? She's super sick at the moment. She's so cute. She's cute at her chick. The scenes really touch us, my body. Oh, no, it's so pretty. Cute. Oh, she's there again. No, no, no, no. I think it's about her childhood, her childhood, her family. I think it's about her childhood. Childhood plus family. Maybe she misses so parts of her childhood. We should cry. The machine misses her dad. What? You do your dad? Oh, God. I think he just left her. And she was young. I think her voice is the melody for the metrics. Oh, it's a bit weird. It's weird, we can look at each other. Oh, he's so soft, oh, yeah. Sorry, I'm not really well-thought. We're different. I think it's all about her life. For her own sins. Childhood, till now. Oh, it's Jason. Oh, it's Jason. Oh, she finally got a crush on her. Oh, it's fun. Is that her husband? As no one wants her friend. Their relationship goes honestly speaking. They're their relationship I look up to. They're so sweet. And they're so pure. So cool. So pure. The piano loves the real sound of people instead of like music. Whereas it's not his one. It feels like it kind of breaks the rhythm. Is that the pro... I think he's for post. Are you steving on the mic? Maybe it's like a pro post. Okay. Yeah, I don't think right. I don't know. When you beat their album. Yeah. But it doesn't look like they're acting. It's like a real situation. Really? We have thought that it did redgrass. Right? Where is she going? No. Oh, yes. She's smiling. Oh, it's really a pro post, right? Pro post. Pro post. It sounds like our worship is so good after. That's why she's throwing back. It's like throwback. It's a happy story. I guess. Because in the first you thought it's sad. She found love again. We can do it. We can do it. It's not a real situation. I want to do it. Or they just say... I think it's just acting. It's like real. It's like doing a film. Maybe it's a real story. Like a real girlfriend. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. It's like that. I don't know. John Bratz. You want to dance there? Yeah. I like his proposal. He looks away all chat. It's like he's too. He looks like my friend. But now he's in high school. Oh. Does he look like he's... Maybe half. You're playing all my... All my OPM play this song. Oh my god. The voices bass is so different. Is this pen and pen? Oh, okay. I know. Because I saw them. For real? Yeah. This is... You see, like OPM? Yeah. I feel like... God songs, I don't understand, but it's cool. I think his friend is telling him to pick up someone. It's a friend? No. I think so. I recently found the meaning of this song. Oh, it's so slow. Like Young Gun-un. Like, in Palayun. But I don't know the title. Because that town is... It's like acoustic. Yeah. Baby-ya-ya-ya. Already, brothers. The two guys. I'm not sure. Do you have some? I don't know. Do you have some? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Oh, yes. Crush and the girl. What's this name? Ben and Ben. Oh? Yeah, they're the Ben Brothers. Yeah. I know one of them's Black Benjamins. The other one's Black Benjamins. That's what's called Ben and Ben. I think they're the same. They're the same. They're the same. Oh, yeah. They do look alike. That's the actual band. Yeah. Keep running. Yeah. But they're like the main sinners. What they travel with the band together. The bass is a screw. It's so... It's just so attractive. I think most of the music in the band is related to love, friendship, or happiness. It's right there is a band. Yeah. It's like a song you want to listen to when it's like late after. And you're amazing. Or like when you want to chill. So you just turn this on your speaker. Even though the music is like a play by the end. Very soft, very soft. The voice of the singer and the CD-spooling. It's very smooth. Like, wait, did they mention something? They're so good singing. Yeah, like it's a place. Yes. I'm so bad. Oh, I want to beat that. She's a singer. Why? Why me? It actually sounds like the part of the song. The part of the song. It's a violin. Maybe it has another girl. I don't actually get the story. I'm sorry. Sorry. Slow down the music. I think the girl has a boyfriend. I don't think so. So they're just friends. But the guy next to her. She has a mother. What is she doing? That's not her. It's just starting that we're thinking it's right. Oh, the song is there. Oh my god. I will kill him. If I were the woman, I would punch you. Why is she problematic? I'm not. I'm not. Hi! What is it? Oh, my god. Or maybe she has a boyfriend. But he likes the girl. Ah, the girl. They just had a... It's not a date, but they just... He thought that she's just imagining something. Maybe you'll find someone there. Grab share. Grab share. We... I miss gold. I like this song. Okay. You know, okay? No. It's like a movie. And the guys in trouble... The guy in trouble is the woman. It's a love song. Everything is love. Oh, you. Who's this? I think I'm just going to... For POOZ again? They're dating. So they're getting engaged again. They keep the restaurant themselves. Maybe he looks like a chef, right? Chef? No. Is he a moustache? No, no, no. Because of his costume. I love him. I love him. I love him. He's so high. He has some worries in his mind. Oh, I think. But the girl is very so happy. She's pretty. Maybe he thinks time is running by. She thinks that the man really loves her. But in the reality, he's just plastic. Oh, he wants to turn back that. Oh. I think he asked her to break up. Oh, something's happening. Maybe he knew something about him. That's why... And she couldn't control herself. Oh, he did something. What's happening? She feels disgusted in herself. Oh, he didn't... He didn't... He didn't steal it. She's so aggressive. Time has come. And I think it's too late to be back. Is she sick? Is she suffering from something? Is it a mental problem? I think something really hard to talk. Right? She's not crazy. Look at the scene. At first, she was happy. And so the way she got home, she was kind of... So scary. She suffered from trauma. It's like a real, right? And... The way she was. The end of the relationship. That's for... Pills? Oh, she's taking medication. Ah, that's a mental problem. What's her problem? Maybe. Maybe she has depression. Right? Is that why you also read the bio? Maybe I could hear something in the piano song. From now on. I didn't know that it was really good like this. Oh, it's a summer avenue. It is. My last opium song that I heard was high school. But that time when I heard opium, it was not that good. So I was like, what is it? My face is so beautiful. The rhythm and the melody. And even the words that I got low. Oh, it was not really touched my heart. So I used to listen to K-pop or pop songs. But after this video and maybe I'm going to find some Filipino music. Because I think through the music videos and the music really touches. And then I can see the similarities of me and Filipino. And even though it's different nationality, the feelings of love, friends and family, it's just the same. So yeah, I think they are making really good videos and melody now. It's my first time to see opium. I haven't seen any opium in Korean. No, not one of it. Because it's not worldwide. That's why it's not famous among nationalities. So I just know the Filipino song is only in Kal. And this is my first time to hear the whole Filipino song. And even the opiums. It's really different of what I thought about the Filipinos. They really like love each other. Even though we meet someone, they're so friendly. And they come first to say hi or what. When I saw the video, it really touches my heart also. When I knew the meanings, I really liked the song. For me, I like the first video. Because the video is the proposing. Yeah. I want to be the one. No, no, no, no. Instead of the proposal, I like the scenes in front. While she's previewing her childhood and then through her memories. I heard a lot of stories from my mother, my aunties. They said the same thing. While they marry, they suddenly see the scenes of their childhood, the family, like mother and father, they cry at the time. Even though I'm not married yet, I can still feel what she feels. So I really like the first video. I've seen their relationship. I guess kind of grow. I can't where Jason's boyfriend is. I saw what he posted about my nine months after I met you. I brought you to my parents. He knew that she was the one already by nine months. And their relationship, it's just really based on God that I got. That's super. Yeah. I cried. I cried so sweet. Looking through the past, like her father leaving her. She's reading all the letters that she used to write for him. Taking that and being proposed to. Now, I guess it's kind of symbolic in the song. There's a relationship that was broken. But somehow the fiance came and I can't fix it. Or at least try to fix it as much as possible. So by proposing, like he's starting a new family with her. Like he's trying to start a really health-near relationship with her. That's not gonna hurt her. You can see her process of building a lot of trust in people. Especially if a family member leaves you when you're a kid. That's a person that you trust that a lot. You look up, do it, and you just kind of left. So that trust is gone. It's so hard to build. But the proposal and how Maya trusts him. Actually, I cried when I was a kid. I watched the video last year. And when I knew that it was a proposal, I was like, it was really sweet. But then it's just not really a fan of her voice. I find them quite one-of-a-kind in their relationship. It's very part of the process of diary story. Story-in-early. Although it's realistic. It's true that they're very growing down in Indonesia. But I'm one-of-a-kind with these days you won't be able to find that much not gonna build a relationship. I like her songs, but not yourself. Not yourself. Not yourself. My favorite was the first one. I really like the cinematography. Because I didn't know that it's... I was gonna ask if it's O-O-P-N. Because it's too big. Like... No. All of the videos. Well, but among them, the first one was the voice. And the voice is so sweet. It's like a worship song. Like I mentioned. I think the first half of the story was like her dad. Her dad left her. And then there was something this kind of emptiness. But then she found the right guy. And the right time and the right place. Through God. Because of God. According to Elle's explanation. And then she got she overcome that, you know, emptiness. She was able to... But yeah. Find out how she wanted it. It's my type. I'm sorry. I didn't get the story quite well. But then... The story was about the past. I don't know if it's true or not. It's just an easy one. Imagine it. It hurts the most somehow. Like it's so painful. It pains like the picture of a perfect relationship. But you know, it isn't a relationship. It's all in your imagination. Even in the lyrics, I'm sorry. Because I love you. And then she's like, wow. That hurts. She was about us. It's kind of sad. The person you like is just right there. And you have to see the person you like be with another person. You just have to contrast with people. It's really sad. Can you relate it? Can you relate it? Yeah. Secret. Let's get the question. And then the girl, I can't understand. I don't know if it's something Korean. Like... She was like, you know, the guy that... She leads on the guy. And then she was like, kind of like, you know. Yeah. You said, you know, it's kind of like literally your skin. And it touches the other person's skin. In English, you're a touchy. Yeah. She was kind of touchy the other girl. I still don't understand. The very song. I like it. And like, we're in the end. And I like the... How the song started with your mom. Of course. It's very dramatic. Third video, I think. Because I talked about mental health a lot already. You have to have that. He's willing to go through her anxiety. Go through her disorders. What she did during those times is really sweet and really understanding. And the guy is super patient of her. Because there's a lot of people who think mental health is just nothing. And like, it's just out of anger. But sometimes people can't control that. I think it's really nice that he's really patient for her. And then he's really caring. Even after that, he gives her medicine. And like, hugs her and takes care of her. So, yeah. Everything made sense. Where did he get the medicine? He saw how the girl was suffering from something. And despite that, he still stayed for her. The story is like telling. There's always a person who will always be there in your tough times. Hard times. You're depressing times. Or you're mad at the table. Well for me, the third world. I don't know what to say. I'm not sure. Because I didn't really get the story. I didn't get what the music video wanted us to catch. I don't get the message. But then, music wise, his vocals is so high for a... Yeah, for a guy. I wonder what's the highest note that he can get. Ah! The last music video was kind of nice. Ash. I think Ash said that. I have a message that I can't answer. If I didn't explain it, what was the point of this song? What would you say that you didn't explain it? I think it was really bad. I thought the guy asked my break up. I thought he was mad about it. I thought it was like the final beat. I was like looking for the time to say. So what's your favorite? I like the first one. No, you have to look at the first one. First one? I think it's the first one. I was like the first one. I like it that they just use instruments, piano, and everything. It reminds me of being green. I didn't want to. I didn't want to. I mean, I like how these opium show originality. I don't know if you don't have to use all the tunes or those kind of backup beats to make a song. It's classy for me. I find it classy. I find it really. I find it chill. Of course, there are different kinds of music that people find it chill, relaxing. But then opium is really classy. Even if they use only acoustic instruments. It's still good to hear. Yeah, I really want to listen to these music in the late afternoon. You know, the cup of tea. Yeah, for every day. I don't know. Yeah, this is for every day. Yeah, it's really different. The especially the music video is so different from what I expected as of the opium. I thought it's going to be really clean. Yeah, it's not their story line. Especially the first one, their video and the cinematography. So delightful. Like the scenery so nice. I want to go to the place. I really want my professor to be so good at that. Oh, wow. So it was really a new experience with the opium. Yeah. Good job. Super. I'm going to say that I counted the music video seriously. As much as they took their songs. You can see their hard work throughout their video. Right? Because the thought of opium that goes in your mind is so different from what you see. So you think it's a level up to what you do in the Azure to be. Yes, oh my god. This is my reporter.
