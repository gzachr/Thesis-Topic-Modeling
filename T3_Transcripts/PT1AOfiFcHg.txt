Alright, so our first dish today is chicken adobo. The most popular dish in the Philippines. So guys, take some and dish up. Okay. You usually eat it with rice? That's okay. I'm excited. That's good. This is better than mine though. You cook good adobo. This is good though. This is really good. So adobo is literally just meat, marinated and soy sauce and vinegar. Garlic and onions. It's like the primary ingredients. Okay, yum. Bay leaf. So what is your guys' approval for? Very good. It's so good. I love it. Pangalua. We have called deretta. Dapa beef. Better. We just have pork. You can see. We have a lot of beef today. It's a COVID. Okay. Okay. Let's do this. I like it. What's it? What is it? Like, what are the ingredients? It's heard. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Okay. Anyway, so I know most of the ingredients in here is like, you got your meat, which is usually beef, but this one's pork. You got potatoes, carrots, peppers, tomato sauce, and liver paste. What? There's a little bit of paste inside. I'm going to start crying. It was good. I like the adobo more. But it was good. For our third one, we have beacol express. So ito yung mung hong. It's spicy. Just let you all know. This is a very popular dish in the region of beacol. It looks like... Okay. Let's dish up. This one for me. This is the one I like. I have a hard time cooking because I don't really know how to cook it right. So, we're going to find out. It's pink. I don't know what pieces are in here. I know. I don't know which one to take. It's pork. We'll say that. I'll finish. Okay. It's pink. I have so afraid right now on my gosh. It doesn't. Alright, let me make sure I taste the first one. I know what's going on for them. It's actually not that spicy. Okay. I can do this. It is pink. Oh my gosh. Taste. I would only do this for you, Kayden. Oh jeez. I'm afraid. Yeah, I'm nervous. Oh no. Oh my gosh. I'm going to take this one. I definitely had a different version of this than this one. Oh jeez. It smells not. It tastes like I remember the one. Oh no. I'm so nervous. I've catered with the plate down. I know. I wish I didn't see that. I wish I would have just... It's okay. I'm going to have to wait. I'm going to have to wait for it. I'm going to have to wait for it. I'm going to have to wait for it. It's okay. What is it? It will be called Express. So it's supposed to be spicy. Well, I guess it doesn't have any spicy, but it's better when spicy. You're going to taste the other flavor. What is it? The flavor of shrimp paste. Oh. So that's probably the taste you guys have here. Ew. I'm going to have coconut milk and spices. I'm going to shrimp. But yeah, the shrimp paste is very prominent in this one. That's why I need a lot of spices, like counteract the shrimp paste. So you don't taste it as much. At least for me, I like the spicy one better. So this one is... That's a part of the hand-decent shrimp. I'm tasting the shrimp. I should have guessed. Oh my gosh. Oh my goodness. Yeah, that's what makes it think of lines. For our next one. Round four. Round four, we have pork sea seagulls. So this is very popular with beer. Oh. Have a nice beer with it at late night. No, I didn't drink beer, but I was like, how would you do that? That's what everyone says, okay? It's really good. It's like one of my top favorites. It's very smelly. I regret it smelling the last one. It's kind of... That's a little spicy. I thought they had a lot of chili peppers on them. I really love this. Oh wow. It's like a little spicy. It kind of looks like the garlic parmesan sauce. A little wild wings. Oh my gosh. It's right. It's good. It kind of has an acquired taste to it at first. I like the spice. I like it. I like the spice. I know, the spice is good. This is good. Yeah, this is really good. What's it made out of? Okay, so this one is like... I don't know what they put in there, but usually it's like... It's like all parts of the pig's face. So all parts of the pig's face with some spices and onions and... Some other sauces. Comment down below if you know what was all in this because I don't remember. It is really good. It's great seasoning. But now that I know what it is. Yeah, the seasoning is really good. I would definitely... I would take more. I'll take more. Even though I know what it's made out of. No. This might be my favorite one. I think this is really good. This is really good. Whatever they put, like, spiciness on this. It's seasoning. I don't know how they put on this one, but it's pretty good. It's really good. I don't like this. Do you want some more? Do they use the snout? Comment down below if they use the snout. I think so. I will say maybe. I know they use the ears. I know for sure the ears. I would say the snout, but... If they use the ears, I'll probably use the snout. Ziggy, so for the next one we have... Letchen Koali, which is pretty much just fried pork belly. And you can dip it in this sauce, which is called... General Salad's Iver. No, we're not General Salad's. That's some duck Asian sauce. I was a piece of Salad's going to grab. Whoa. And you pick a good piece. Wait, this is mostly that. That's good. Do you eat that? No, it's your mouth. Oh my gosh. There's another sauce right there, okay. This is like all that. Is it mostly all that? Are these all supposed to be all fat? Well, the fat might not be... That was so good. Oh my gosh. I haven't had this in quite some time. And it's bringing back in. I'm afraid. Like this one, I'm going to get afraid of it. The first is take a little. That is actually pretty good. I think fried anything is really good. You try to mix the fat with the meat in your bite. Why does it all look fat? Oh, this is straight fat. Like this is fried fat. It goes down pretty good. This is fried fat. It's not like the fat here that we have. It's like white chewy. I mean, it goes down okay. Damn, I'm going to try to bite with all the fat. Alright, I'm nervous. It's actually pretty good. I just don't know. The sauce is really good. I like the sauce. Oh, it's called mung tamas. I know now. Mung tamas. Not general sauce. Next, we have pork sienic. I literally just made this last week. Really? Oh, we... So it's kind of like a soup thing, so you can grab something. Oh. Oh my gosh. Because there's some things you don't need to. Like, don't eat that big pepper unless you want a big pepper. No. I don't know what I... It's good. It's a little spicy. Okay, I see the green beans. It's good though. You can't really screw up something. Woo, it's kind of hard. It's good. Is this spicy? It is pretty spicy. This one is spicy. I'm like, do you want to eat it? Sorry, I didn't have this one. It's spicy. I thought it was a mini-grating going on. Okay, it is not vinegar. Since I got roasted in the comments last time, I think that's the first thing you've been to. It is tamarind. It's sour. I like it. It's good. I love like you guys. It's a special reaction. It's weird for it. It's weird for it to be sour and spicy. I know. I don't even know how that was possible to be sour and spicy. Exactly. Like, a usual one is more sour than this one. Even more sour than this. This one just like a spicy one. Sit up. Sit up. Yep. Alright, next we got... Punced beehun. So these are like rice noodles with like some vegetables. Oh, it looks good. It looks a nice, high-reset. And there might be little chunks in it. It's like pork though. Okay, it's nothing bad. It's a nice dairy. What part of it? What part of it is it? It's just eaten. It's just eaten. Okay. It shouldn't even say anything. I'm excited. This is a very like... This is a party food. You have birthday parties or any party. This is always... This is it. This reminds me of like ramen noodles. What? Oh, what are you talking about, man? I like it a lot. And it's way too. It takes like ramen. You don't need rice with it. It tastes like ramen. Okay, I really like this. It's really good. It's way better. Yeah. I have a doubt. So much of this. I don't want more right now. I kind of want more too. That's yummy. Another good thing is... Okay, some people think I'm weird when I do this. But lots of Filipinos do this. You get like a piece of bread. You just pour like noodles on the bread and then you eat it like a taco. Is that the Filipino taco? I don't know. I guess we can eat all this. We don't talk. But I do with this. I do with spaghetti and I do with like ramen. Is this cabbage? Yeah. Oh, I like cabbage. So for our last one, this is finally the last one. One of my all-time favorites. Pork de nougat. It looks like mole. Okay, it's brown. Like it's just straight brown sauce. I don't know how I feel about that. They have like a little like a little chocolate in it. Oh, so it is a lot like that. Yeah. They don't have like a chocolate flavor at all. I don't know what to play. So, I don't know what to play. What do you think? I like that short. Oh, I get it. That's a different taste for sure. I like it. What does it like to taste you like tasting? It's almost got a little curry vibe to it. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking. I love curry. I do like curry. Brown. No, I like that. It does have more curry vibes to it. What would you guys give us one out of ten? I get this one in eight. Probably a six. I like that. So, do you guys only know where Lily is in it? I was so afraid of that. So, um, it's not chocolate. I really like you guys again. I'm sorry, but this is pork cooked in its own blood. So, the sauce is just straight pork. I remember you talking about this. Oh my gosh. Are you kidding me? No, I'm not. It wasn't chocolate. No, it's not chocolate. I'm glad. I had to get you guys to eat it. I did think it was something to say I was brown. I'm like, it's chocolate. All my tress. And you. Shattered, gone. It's good though. No. I know, I'm really torn. And this is one of your favorites? It tastes good though. I cannot believe that. It tastes amazing. It's like I'm shook, but it tastes good. Okay, story. I'm shocked. So, first time I ever had this. Is that a member of a big good at a party? I literally just had a spoonful and no rice. Well, it's very good. Like, eh, something else. But apparently that was just like a bad cook of it. So the second time I had it, I was having like memories. I was like, it's not bad again. But I had it. I was like, this is awesome. And then I didn't stop eating it. And that's everything. It's just, it's all good. I came to my top three. So. But did you know what you were eating? Yeah, I did. They told you. No. All right, I needed to take a bite. No. No one would know what I'm eating. Oh my gosh. Now all I see is just a cup full of... We've only eaten a little black. With a leaf in it. Oh my gosh. So that's just a blood. That's a statement. For blood. I need my rice noodles. That's disgusting, but it tastes really good. You really can do. Oh my gosh. Mm-hmm. Oh my gosh! Yeah! You hit me! I can't. It's like grainy? It is grainy. Oh my gosh! This is nothing like mole. This is nothing like mole. Honestly, I don't own mole as long as I'm lying. I'm sorry. I just had to get anything I could say to get it to you. Because I could not say what I'm not so much. Okay guys, if you had to rank your foods in order now, what would you say is the best or the least best? Or let's say what is your least best? I think we can all agree on the least. The Shred-Haze! The equal express. Oh no! It definitely needs a lot of spice to camera that shrimp face. A lot of something else. I've had a good one for that one. The best thing. What is your guys' best? The pick face. The sea-sake. Yeah, that was good. And then the adobo. It was really good. I like this. No! Oh he got that this top! No! Yes! That's all I wanted. And then pork stomach. Wow, what a day. What am I eating? What is going on? It's good though. I like the rice noodles. I like the rice noodles. Those go above the pork stomach. It's the face. I know. The rice noodles are my top three. That... I can't even live with myself right now. I'm just thinking about what I just did. Okay, my top three. Probably the pork season. Because that's easy. It was really good. Good goli. This is two. I'm just blocking it. This is playing with it. Psh! And then number three. I gotta go with that spicy sinegum. I like that soup. Oh, the soup. I like that. But I'm in Salametsu and you will have lots of fun. And don't forget to subscribe, comment, or you'll be able to cook a puppeteer. Don't put a guy in the middle of the dinner. And go. You can't do this.
