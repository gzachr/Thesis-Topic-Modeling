 Good morning everybody we're going back to Ormock today. Today's the day I'm going to apply for a Filipino driving license. Hi everyone, I'm Mike Yara. Good morning my friends. Good morning everybody. So it's Friday, you know, Thursday Wednesday. Thursday. It's Thursday I think. It's so busy lately we don't know what day it is anymore. I think it's Thursday today. And James made us some breakfast. That's all my brother-in-law made it. I'm going to burn raw meat in that first. Yeah this is the Hachikolipramar gata. I'm going to see other fish. I've got a dry fish and woodwood sticking rice. I've got oats and water. It's still nice. Actually not water, it's matcha. It's going slow ways. So we're going to have our breakfast outside for a change. What do you relax after a few days? It's nice. You want anything in the forest? You want nuts? No it's okay, thanks. You sure? Yeah, here we go. It's too matcha-fi. Oh I think I've got a matcha green tea, Latin. Oh James got some fish. Cow. Hot chocolate made from arcao. And woodwood just did your rice. You dip that in hot chocolate. Do you want to fill a few days too? Yeah. I don't know if some people will dip it but probably do. I'll do that one. I like to do it. Put it with sick water. Mmm. It's so pretty. I mean, try this before. No, I don't think so. Yeah, sure next. Mmm. Nice. It's nice. It's nice. It's different than it is like mixed together with hot chocolate. I can't describe what it tastes like. It's a bit like vice pudding almost. It's nice. Oh dear. Our relaxation is over. You hear the noise from the neighbour. Their music is far too loud. Quite a common occurrence in the province. So many people play their music here in the morning. They're all volumes. Everyone's up early usually. Just got seven o'clock. So I have a British, a UK 4-5 in licence. Pass my test. Some many, many centuries ago back in 1997. And today I'm going to apply to convert my licence to a 4-philippineau non-professional driver licence. What's that mean non-professional? Means I can drive vehicles up to a limit of 4,000,000 gilioans. I think now when you come to the Philippines, your life's trying for up to 90 days on your 4-philippine licence. After which time you must obtain a Filipino driver licence to continue driving on the roads. So here now in Omaha City, I'm at the Medical Centre. I'm planning for a medical certificate which is part of the process of applying for my 4-philippineau driver licence. I'm going to go inside now. I'm kind of just starting. Hope you pass and get the medical certificate. And then off to the LTO to get the licence. The cos of the medical is 250pc. I'm not sure exactly what they're going to check in. But it's like a great pleasure. I don't have any more blood free shirts here. I love the red barrage of the LTO. Jean has my results. Do I pass? I think you do. You did. I can't show you all this, but here we are. I've got my medical certificate. On to the LTO. On the way now to the LTO. I hope you get a fill of enjoy licence. I hope so. So here it is. It's in here. We're finished with the LTO. And I have a fill of fill of driven licence. It's a very quick process. It took all of 20 minutes. So I passed on medical with a clean bit of health. Everything was absolutely fine. I went to the LTO. I went to the first counter. Very fair fight. All my documents were correct. I've got a fill of driven licence. I'm going to be a little bit off here at the moment. I'm going to get this. My friend, the goat. He's got an army now. There you go. Into the field. Where are you in the field? I can't beat them down votes. You're only one man. You're good because it's a stupid woman. It's not. It really buzzed up the thing. Hello, Cream. What are you doing? You following me? Cream. Sit. Sit. Good boy. Get some food, okay? Good boy. Sit. Cream. Sit. Sit. Cream. Sit. Good boy. There's a bunch of these. There's a bunch of these. Good boy. Sit. Good boy. So we're back here with the house. We're going to get a very good clean today. Getting to the installation of our furniture. Got the house. It's clean as possible before they can go and put it in. The tie-lapse there is 99% of the heat. There's a little bit of the fun. There's a few guys. They're doing dusting. They're quite kind of fun and not so. Did you clean the room? Oh! Did you clean the room again? Yes, we did. Yes, we did. Yes, we are here guys. Just cleaning up. It's really, really dirty. Pulled dust. I can't breathe properly so I don't take over. We check, check. Check, check, check. Check, check, check. Check, check, check. We got it! Oh! Oh! That's it. I'm so tired. Oh! I'm going to go back for a little bit. Clean up is still on the way. Lots to do. Not going to be moving two weeks to go. It's going to be September the 8th. Wednesday September the 8th. I'm sweating.
