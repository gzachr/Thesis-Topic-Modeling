Is that a song track? That song actually released in the 80s, like in 1985 or 1986 or something like that. And the song has gone viral on TikTok and is being hit in the charts again here in the UK as if it just released. And yeah, so everybody's doing covers of it. But there's a scene. It's on the trailer, so I don't think I'm spoiling anything. Well, one of the girls gets possessed and she looks like that. So that's the joke. You know, fun. Is that really good color? I like it.
