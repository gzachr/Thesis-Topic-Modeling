 Good morning guys, it's the early start this morning, 7.15pm. We are off to the airport. We're flying back to the Philippines. We're flying into Sabu. We're going to have a little bit of the Philippines. We're looking forward to seeing a brand new place. Clearly took a break. We wanted to see Taiwan, the flights worked out. Really cool city here. Really good time. We were going to miss the coffee here because it was very good and we're sad that we didn't get time to grab one more cup of a roast coffee this morning but sadly we didn't. Yeah, we're excited. Let's go. It's not a phone charger. I like that a lot. We always had stairs. Lazy. All through security and everything like that. All the other stuff out the way. We've just spotted the most. We've smoked the most incredible pastries and it's early this morning. It's not very healthy but they look so good. Let me show you. Okay, how good do these look? I'm starting to feel so good. I'm so excited to be here. We had loads of you guys in the comments saying, oh you're leaving the Philippines. I thought you should go for a swim. You must try it out. I'm from there. We'll do this. We'll be like, alright, we'll make a flight. It did tell you that it made sense to go out to Taiwan and come back in. The accommodation we've done it through is like the King.com as per usual. But we had a little message saying you're not saying I'm a hotel. It is like my home. It's kind of like the NBA situation but it's much more like family orientated shoes that I've got kids. Obviously your room's your room but like we'll be there if you want to come and have a chat with us. Watch TV playing play a game with chess. So it's so fun. It's so fun. It's so fun to meet them. They sound so friendly. The juicy vlog. Do you see them love? Yeah. Yeah, you see it? I'm going to subscribe with. It's 12, 13,000. Wow, look at that. Thank you. How many in your family? I ate. I ate 15. Wow. What's your name? I'm Neville. Hanabelle. Nice to meet you. Have you heard of Fin Snow? Fin Snow? Very popular YouTuber. But he lives in the Philippines. And yours and gotta follow yours. Yeah. Thank you. My kids will follow you. Yeah. That's great. Yeah, but look, because they like to watch what foreigners do. Yes. Hello. Hi. It's like my way. That's right. Yes. Sorry. That's my boyfriend from five. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Tara? The juicy vlog? J-U-I-C-Y. J-U-I-C-Y. You see. Like, Georgia Lucy, but it's about differently. Are you going to live in the Philippines? We love it. We love the scenery, people, things. One day, maybe. You want to go to the world? Yes. Thank you. No, hi, Chauver. Yeah, that's fine. Too high, anyway. Yeah. And this is your key, thank you. Thank you very much. So, Rin, here's our room. Got a key. Good size. Got view. Don't know about that, because they, they, it's very hot here basically. And they, they close the cans so the sun doesn't come in. We've got aircon, which is really good. But it, it's going to take a few minutes to cool down. It's hotter than where we've come from. It's about 32 today. But yeah, we're good. So we wanted to, if you watched our previous videos, you know, we've spoken loads about the Filipino people and stuff. So for this, for this state here, we didn't want to book into like a big hotel with hundreds of rooms, which you can do. There's a rather simple, here. And there's loads of other big hotels and stuff. We wanted a more kind of, I don't know, like a real experience. Yeah, almost like we live with the family. And this is exactly what we were looking for, that they're super friendly. May and her sister, we met and the kids, the girl princess. They're just very, very welcoming, very, very friendly. They said, obviously here's your room, but feel free to come downstairs and sit with us. How did they go? Guitar. Do you want to come out to know? If you're travelling and you have the opportunity to do so like this, and we booked it through booking.com so it's easy to do. It's easy to find. Highly recommend it. Yeah, definitely. Because you get to know people, we would just have no great chat in the car along the way. You get to know what it's like for local people to live here. Yes, so different to like hotel experience, isn't it? We've got a group here now. And we're heading to get some food. Filipinos are much kinder than English people. No. They're very kind. This one is very nice. Yeah? Yeah. Summer. Filipinos, very nice things. Wow, because... No, just black hole. Yeah. You know, Manchester, Liverpool, Liverpool. Yeah. Cool, Liverpool, yeah. Home of the Beatles. Oh, yeah. That's why I'm going to raise your accent. Yes, yeah. I'm missing. Oh, oh. I miss it. Yes. The first time I went there was 2007. Yeah. And it was... It was summer. Oh, okay, nice. And then in 2010. Yeah. It was winter. Oh, my God. Oh, very cold. Very cold. I think it's about two degrees there at the moment. Yeah, exactly. Breathing. Yeah. I wear my thermal pants. Wounds and deserts. Winter, jacket. Oh, my God. I miss that. Peace and tips. Oh, yes. We miss fish and chips. We miss it, too. Yeah. It looked like every lunch. Yeah. Peace and tips. Every day. Every lunch. Yeah, that's amazing. And then... That's great. Nice to meet you. See you later. Bye. Enjoy the fish and chips. Bye. Bye. Okay, that guy was great. So nice. We usually ask people from Philippines if they've been to England. The majority of them say no. I like that. Security checks coming in shopping malls. We need that in England. Yeah, we usually ask people from the Philippines if they've ever been to England. The majority say no. But he said yes. Ah, how are you? Good, good. The majority say no. But he had been to England. He'd been to Blackpool. He was saying like... I've probably saw it a second ago. I don't know how much that came out in the clips. But he was like, yeah, I had fish and chips every day. Every single day, fish and chips. He was great. We're now in a shopping mall. We've come... What is it? We're in Robinson shopping mall. We've come to get some food. It seems pretty big. I don't know where we're going. We're just going to have a wander round. That's a cool place. Had a nice warm greeting already. So, yeah, it's nice to call out of the heat. It's quite lovely in back here. The people are so nice. I'm not saying the people in Taiwan weren't nice. But they weren't. It's different. They say hello to you. It's different. People are very, very welcoming here. Hi. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hi. So, after our Jolly Be video is it, of Philip E. Newcastle food, we've been told we have to come to Chowkig and try their foods. We're going to have that for dinner now. Like Jolly Be, we're going to order loads of food. But, sorry to be the point. That's not in this video. We're going to put that up. Will it be for tomorrow night, maybe? Possibly, yeah. It's night after this one. I'm at the separate video because I think it's been normally a takes us quite a while to get through all the food and give it all a go and stuff. We want to do it justice. Yes, exactly. But, there's loads of stuff. It seems kind of less like a motorbike and more actual, like, living in all our Asian top-style food. So, we're going to order loads of it. We look super cheap and pretty tasty as well. We just finished filming the Chowkig video. I'm really full. We're finishing off. They kept ringing bells over there. We're trying to film something. We're finishing off with a hello, hello. Is it good? Hey, George has found a jacket he wants to try on, but I don't think it's going to fit him. Check it out. Oh, no, it's too small. It's too small, man. They didn't have your size. I don't know. It's quite small. We just ate loads of chowkig. So, I'm feeling fat. I'm not going to eat all of them. I'm not going to sit that up. That's too big. I'm going to order. Oh, thanks. Get the hair out. I'm going to order. I'm going to order. Oh, thanks. Get the hair out. Get the hair out. That's cool, man. I like the look of that, but... Do you know what? It also makes me look a little bit like a tennis player. That's the only thing I'll think of. I don't think anyone's going to take your tennis player. No offense. What do you think? Still. Nice? You like this? No? Nice. Yeah, you're wrong. I'm a big father. We are all the way from the money that we just gave him here from. That's it. It's all your... You're a big ass. It's amazing. We're staying. I can't remember what we're staying. Soon. Like 20 minutes from now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Great to meet you. Let's get up and come. Yeah. Cool. Thank you very much. Get some heat. Yeah. Thank you. Did you send your hat on guitar? Yeah. He hasn't played in a long time. He's been away. Mrs. It. Yes, sir. Thank you, are you sure? That's amazing. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. I'm sorry, I can't. Yeah. You were always on my mind. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Are you okay? Yeah. You were always on my mind. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Can I win the vlog? No. It's mine. All right. Let's... Let's change up a little bit. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's so chilled here. I've got my entrance time. It's time. It's time.
