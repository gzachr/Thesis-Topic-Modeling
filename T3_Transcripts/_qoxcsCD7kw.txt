Another filipino food experiment today i really 
wonder how this filipino food will taste i know  
that filipino food has many varieties but i have 
not yet seen the one that i'm going to try today  
will use limang itlog how to cut an onion please 
let me know in the comments how you would cut  
the onions i don't know in the philippines maybe 
there's a different style usually what i will do  
is i take the knife and just cut the outer peel 
i know it's syang but i just get rid of it and  
i'll take i'll use the the part in the middle 
then i'll just slice it lengthwise so there um  
there's like thin slices you know that you can use 
and if i need to make the onion smaller i would  
just chop it with two hands so that they get even 
more fine you might wonder what dish we are making  
but we're using itlog sibuyas siling labuyo
paminta
can you believe this will become 
a special version of adobong  
itlog? if you really like adobong itlog like 
me please make sure to hit the like button
egg mixture goes in
it really smells great and i 
know you're still wondering  
why naman sir why not uh use a 
boiled egg instead of a fried egg  
well that's the experiment we're gonna try and 
flip it over the purpose of this one is to make  
it like an omelette oh see it looks really 
crispy that's exactly what i want to achieve  
we're going to use two spatulas see 
it's nice and crispy on the bottom side  
smells so good we're gonna 
flip it over one more time
there we go
okay it fell apart a little bit but it 
should be okay we're gonna put it on a plate
i'm sure it is already masarap now the interesting 
part we're making a sauce from vinegar and soy  
sauce this is white vinegar mixed with a sweet soy 
sauce okay approximately the same amounts 50 50.
we'll put the eggs in a airtight container
oh it smells so good and now we're brushing the 
mixture of sweet soy sauce and white vinegar over  
the egg quite a bit i'm gonna use quite a bit 
it smells even better i flipped over the egg so  
also do on the other side walang asin this time no 
salt because the soy sauce is already very salty  
now we're gonna leave this overnight in 
the fridge okay so i'm gonna close it  
so that the flavors can really penetrate
magandang umaga po it's very early i'm 
still sleepy let's make some coffee
we have uh leftover rice so i'm gonna make some  
sinangag here's a nice collagen 
soup that i made with chicken feet
let's first make a salad cucumber salad 
okay we're gonna make a very simple one  
we'll cut these in slices i remove 
this this part tiny slices okay
we're gonna make the most simple dressing in the 
world a little bit of black pepper some sea salt  
a tiny bit of white vinegar some mayonnaise
done
so we're going to make a nice scene and you ask me 
to show beautiful places in the netherlands okay  
so don't go away later because we're gonna show 
you a really nice place in the netherlands okay  
first we make sinangag and we'll combine it with 
the cucumber salad and the egg adobo that we made
i really wonder how this adobong itlog would taste  
to complete this let's add a few sardinas
and there we go our almusal so 
this is adobong itlog let's try it
set up it's pretty it's still early morning but 
it's a beautiful weather today and there's lots  
of people outside and behind me here is the 
market hall but we're going to the other side  
oh this looks beautiful wow amazing 
especially today with the weather it  
looks really nice what do you think these are 
the famous cube houses don't they look amazing  
you can see the walls are slanting and the windows 
it's really strange right strange building now  
when you go in there is actually you know the 
floor of course is straight but the walls and the  
windows are slanting so it's really strange and 
you feel kind of uh dizzy you know inside now let  
me know if you would like to live in these kind 
of houses and why and also let me know of course  
if you want to see other beautiful places in the 
netherlands so these are the famous cube houses  
thank you so much for watching the adobong itlog 
and i'll see you next time with more filipino food
