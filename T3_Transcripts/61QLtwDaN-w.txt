Hey, bro. Hey, how's it doing, man?
Yo, your Tagalog's getting really good, man.
Sige, Tagalog na lang tayo pare.
Sige nga, go!
Parang tied lang eh.
Oh nga, ang puti ng ina mo.
An sabi mo?
Yo, wait, dude. Are you swearing at me?
What? No, of course not.
Oh. Good.
Dude, what is wrong with you?
I'm just saying, ang puti ng ina mo.
Don't say that. That's bastos. That's a swear word.
Dude, all I said is, your mom is white.
Oh. Okay, ang puti ng ina ko.
Cool. Okay, I get it. That's it.
Anyway, practice pa tayo.
Sige.
Mga kulay na lang.
How do you say red?
How do you say yellow?
How do you say blue?
Okay, bro, seriously, what is your problem?
What?
You just called me an a-hole.
Is that like a funny way of trying to say the color brown?
That's the word for blue.
Oh. Dude, no, no, no. Azul.
Ah, okay. Azul.
Yeah, man, be careful. You gotta say it right or else it'll sound like you're swearing, you know?
Oh. Sige, sige. Kailangan ko pa mag-practice.
Anyway, man, I'll see you later.
Yeah, yeah. Ingat. Ingat, bro. Ingat.
Good luck with the tagalog.
Sige, pari. Ingat.
Hoi! Matapaka!
Did you just call me a motherf*****?

Magaling talaga siya mag-tagalog. Nag-bangap lang siya na palpak siya.
Chamba-chamba lang.
Gusto ko lang sabihin na wag mag-rugby.
