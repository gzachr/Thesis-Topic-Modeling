 How do you say you're on in Filipino or Besaya? Let me know. Good morning. May the fifth. Get it add some cleaning liquid? Mask-washing morning. But there's also something sad about this morning. It's broken. The bottom is smashed. Can't make a big coffee. I got to make a baby coffee. It's the smallest little coffee press. It's all they got. One cup. I just wrote a Facebook page post and it has inspired me to do something today. Can you guess it? I'm going to make the most of these rotting green onions. Yeah I will later actually I'll cook them with eggs. That's all I'm going to do. First thing I'm going to do is shave. Second thing I'm going to do is something exciting. Okay. I got a fresh shave. Wash my hair and you're walking down the other little back house. Remember this? We don't really go in it often or show you it often but here it is. In here is just some of our stuff from our old place. Remember Boating was bringing it over? There's something in here. I just want to experience today. There's some good vibes and for a little bit of education on YouTube. So let's do this. Oh yeah. So those are old rice socks full of clothing that I've collected over the years. I was just going to do like an Uka Uka give away thing and be a hero here but obviously with the pandemic I can't do that right now. But look at some of the stuff inside. A chup boulevard. I got this shirt back in 2015 and Davao. A chup boulevard is like a slang there. Yeah a chup boulevard. The boulevard is a part of Davao. I got to go to these bags and find a few things. Sally Glove. Oh. If you didn't know the term bandaid actually just refers to Matt. And there's many different styles of them all around the Philippines. The ones I'm laying on. These are from Taui Taui. You may remember our trip last January. I'm starting to get a collection now because I think they're incredible. I actually commissioned the Badgeau women's community there who weaves with pandan leaves that's what these are made out of. And they said I could take anywhere from three to five months but I think they're making me about 20 of these. And just when I told them whatever the size they want just go and have fun and dream and make bandig and yeah I'm going to buy them all and then bring them back here. And I might actually give a few away or sell a few of them not for profit for me but you know through Facebook or YouTube because I think they're incredible and I thought it would be nice to support that community in that way. This wasn't why I came down here. I just got excited because I saw my bandigs rolled up and I wanted to lay on them. So beautiful and actually really comfortable. These are double the thickness. Let's get changed though. After taking that. Excuse me for a sec. Yeah. Okay. I know this is not going to be the correct undershirt but I can't find my undershirts. It's just got to be becoming for the peanut superpea. Oh my gosh. Brits are about to start his exercise. He's no clue I'm in here doing this. I wonder what he's going to say. I don't know if he's going to look through you. I can't get a whisper because I don't surprise him. Is that bro? You know, what if you were good today? It doesn't even care. Okay. Back to my expedition. That doesn't care at all. I failed. Brett doesn't care. Okay. Back to where I'm actually going here now. So. Oh my gosh. Okay. So my surprise. Yeah. Wrong to get along. There's a couple of reasons I wanted to wear this today. Number one, I just felt like it. It's been a while and I know we can't really go to events. So I just wanted to try it on and feel good. So I do. I'm wearing it. Number two. I just wanted to share some interesting stuff that I've learned over the years of both this. I actually prefer baron tagalog over a suit. I would wear this anytime over a suit jacket. And the reason is because it's so light. As you can see, this fabric here, bring it right up. It tends to be made out of apaca, fiber or pinia fiber. That's pineapple fiber. Making it really light and you can see right through it. I think the actual term baron tagalog comes from borrow, which is a term for dress or a peril. I think in Filipino could be wrong. Let me know. But the interesting thing about this as well is do you see how it's see through? They say that back in the colonial times, a Spanish actually wanted Filipinos to wear this because you can't hide a weapon. So yeah. Wrong to galo. I'm really sweating now. But feeling good. There's a few different styles. This is a great one. I just really wanted to wear a baron tagalog. It's been a while. I love it. Please don't judge me. It's beautiful. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. Yes, I have a pink mask. I just scared Jen. Hey, Jen. Hey, Jen. Hello. Jen was like, oh my gosh. This is cool. J.R.S is here. There's shipping shirts that you ordered. Thanks, bro. And Timo Pongalan, Kuyya. Alan. Kuyya Alan. Thank you, bro. Take care. That's a lot of that. Those little shirts, these shirts here. There's Jen again. Hey, Jen. Cool. Jen told me I have to autograph this one. So that's really cool. It's very inspiring. Thank you, Zervah, whoever's asking me to do that. Yes. Thank you so much. Thank you, Jen. And. I did it. I did it. Sorry. That's all right. There it is. Mark Barkahons, thank you. Holy smokes, that was stressful. I didn't want to ruin your shirt. Thank you, Jen. Take care. Shirts are going out. We can ship. Woo! We can order from anywhere. Just contact the hero outdoor center. Pink mask. Let's see what Brett thinks of it. Check it out, bro. It's a pink mask. He likes it. Wash my hands. All right. Butter, it's okay. Good news. I saw him boating on Instagram. I was going to get supplies for his tuna pies. And I think he's got something for me and Brett now too. So. Look at this pink vehicle. I think he's electric. I think he's here. Yes. How's the pie business going, bro? How's the pie business going? Fun, fun. SoulPy reach. You're going to give a new... What the heck? Thanks. I'm thinking of... I'm thinking of... Oh, I see. Where is it? Dingvo Factor. That's the dream on Instagram. You never know he'll bring you. Dingvo Factor. Take care, bro. Bye. Thank you. Yes. This is good. This is good. Can you guess what this is? Coffee? Yes. Just like that. Within 12 hours. The day is saved. Oh, amazing. Brandy coffee press. Thank you, bro. That's squash soup. That has fish in it. I messed the fish up, so I just threw it in the soup. Is there? Savo? And there it is. I had to show you guys. I'm going to use the green onion. I'm going to use the green onion. I'm going to mix it in with that calabassa. I'm going to switch it around. Meanwhile, Brett's cooking us some dinners and fish. Calabassa soup. Brandy's table. Every day. Every day. It's kind of fun. Let me jump into my bed. I miss being a kid. I was speaking to that earlier in the video. You might have heard me say I made a Facebook post. Yeah, I was just thinking earlier about how important it is for us to always remember to be a kid. And what I mean by that is, you know, a lot of us here, we're chilling at home now. And, you know, I can get quite dull. They're quite repetitive. Things can just seem so usual at the time. Whenever that happens, I always just think about being a kid and how, you know, being curious and just receptive to everything around me. And imaginative how that can be beautiful. And so, yeah, earlier today, too, when you saw me go and start playing on the banning and then dressing up in a brawl. It's because I just wanted to look at the stuff I have that I guess it might be usual, but at the same time, you can bring a bit of joy. That's what I did. I kind of enjoyed that, actually. I didn't expect that I'd be laying on a banning and telling you about it. I did expect, though, that I wear a brawl because I just wanted to share that about those bad English. I wanted to share about that with you because I love brawls. Now it's the evening and I'm going to go to sleep spoon. My English is getting blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Tomorrow's Beside lesson and another day. That was May 5th, 2020. Quarantine continues. And everybody out there just want to say, please do stay healthy, stay safe, stay positive, and feel free to message me on Facebook or Instagram or YouTube and let me know anything. And I'm reading a lot of comments lately because obviously I have time to... Oh, I might give away a shirt or two because a really nice guy named... I think his Nelson? I know that says I think his daughter. He bought these shirts and said to give him away. So, I'm going to give him away. Have a good night. I'm not going to fix the... and just get a sleep.
