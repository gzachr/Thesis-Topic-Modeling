 So the catch 22 of the Philippines is basically in the Philippines as a foreigner you will have elevated value People will treat you with the utmost respect because they think that you're wealthy and women will come easier than they will in the United States for you for instance It's just a fact, it's just the way it goes Everyone wearing Gucci out here but yeah, that's just the fact So you will have an elevated value and you will have an easier time people will treat you with more respect than they did in the United States And women will want you just off your skin color even if you're still ugly But with that there is a trade-off with men and women in the Philippines While these are the most friendly people in the world Basically, you are looked at as an opportunity unfortunately So basically a lot of people will look for you to buy overpriced items from them They will try to give you the foreigner price Women will want you because you're essentially an opportunity for them to get out of their poverty life And that's just the bonafide facts of the give and take of the Philippines So you'll never be treated better anywhere else but at the same time you will be essentially experiencing that treatment because of the wealth that you are perceived to have So that's basically the trade-off is that women are going to want you more And men are going to treat you with the utmost respect But it's mainly because they think that you're rich and a lot of them will be looking at you as an opportunity Whether that's brokering a deal from you selling you an overpriced item asking you for money Women dating you strictly for the fact that you are a foreigner and you are perceived as wealthy or for a lifestyle upgrade and things of that nature So that's just something that you need to understand I'd like to give the real on this channel and not give the fake and not give the politically correct answers and this and that I'd like to tell you the downside The downside is at every corner you will be treated as an opportunity, you will be overcharged for things The customer service is less than stellar People will have separate pricing, foreigner pricing and regular pricing And you will never be treated better and I don't say don't come here, I love it here and I'm staying here What I'm saying is be aware that you are looked at as an opportunity as the trade-off for getting the girl that's way out of your league that's 30 years younger than you As the trade-off for everybody saluting you and saying good morning and yes sir and really really envying you A lot of people also envy America or the West So they will also treat you good because of that because they want to be in the country that you're in They know that your earnings are much higher and they think that we are smart And a lot of people also like our skin color, eye color, African-American men are winning out here too So it's not just white people, it's black guys I have yet to see a Mexican guy out here but I would assume that they're winning or maybe Rique is Mexican but that's the only one I can think of off the top of my head But yeah, at the end of the day guys, just understand the give and take of being treated like a God You will also be looked at as an opportunity in this country Just period point blank across the board from the city to the beach That's just what it is, you know what I mean? People think I'm rich so they treat me well but they also look at me as essentially an opportunity unfortunately But that's the way it goes, I'm sure it's the same way in the United States if you're really legitimately wealthy And you're popping out of a Rolls Royce, everyone's going to be wanting to loan or wanting to get into business with you Or wondering what you do for a living or things of that nature So you're going to be in kind of the same boat here even if you're a whole nobody or you're just a guy that gets a social security check every month You're basically nothing but yet here you are perceived as relatively wealthy So at the end of the day, just keep that in mind when you're out here on these streets or on the beaches of Baraka Or anywhere for that matter and enjoy your time here but be aware of what it is and what it isn't Because those are just some cold hard facts I like to bring the truth on this channel and not give you some nonsense little water down thing It's all perfect, everybody loves you and you get half price on everything and all that And nobody ever wants to look at you as an opportunity or overcharge you or give you a bad deal Because they think you're wealthy and you can have it despair that is incorrect There's a give and take, your value will never be higher, you'll never be treated better But you will be looked at as an opportunity and possibly taken advantage of if you're not smart Alright?
