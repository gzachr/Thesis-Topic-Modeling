 But you're Friday. The freshest. Chocolate Factory, will you won't go? Ah no, it's actually a reggae groom from the Philippines. Oh, nice. And it'll be our first time, officially checking out Filipino reggae for the first time. For the first time. Boo one by Bugoi, that was that reggae. No, yeah, his version of it, yeah. But he's not a reggae artist nor a reggae band. He could be. I mean, that's one of my favorite sounds on Bugoi reggae. You sound so great. Never mind, but this is chocolate factory. Kung Ikai. What the fuck? That's the first time I've seen that. Ikai Akim. Ikai Akim. Because I think. Why are they apostrophe? Ikai, it's another word with, it's two words coming together, but they contract them so that they think they plunk them in together. And they use an apostrophe in the middle too. It's called an abbreviation. That is the word I was talking about. You use that in English as well. But you wouldn't use it with a white. Well, they do it like that. Wow. I've seen it. Cool. Ikai Akim. Cool. Okay. I'm excited. What the fuck? Go back sir. What the heck, man? What? Sound like the minion from the speak with me. What the heck, man? What? Sound like the minion from the speak with me. Oh, yeah. Holy shit. Hey, reggae in the drums. It's actually really fun. I wish I wasn't too lazy. I'm lazy. I'm lazy. I'm lazy. I'm going to my battalion. I'm going to my battalion. I'm going to my battalion. Ah, pause. So actually, that's great. I never thought of that. Take care, look. On reggae. Tagalog. And in like, yeah, in reggae. My sound awesome. But there you go. Tagalog. Tagalog. I think it's just from a bouncy. No, I think it is. It is from a bouncy. Oh, very nice. Come on, keep going. Keep pushing. Good mood, isn't it? I think if I just found his new favorite karaoke track. I hope you try. Back in his out. Every day, come on. And we got to redeem from his v. That's the mom. I love his vocal tonality. The main vocal is such texture, such personality. It's one of a part of Philippines. Freaking swag bro and it's so chilled, so laid back. This is the type of music that should play on the radio 6 o'clock in the morning as you're getting up for life. Chuk chuk chuk chuk chuk chung. It's raining out of time but you don't care because Reagan's playing on the radio. You know what I was saying? Maybe this will be a night my love for Reagan. I haven't heard Reagan a while actually. I'm listening to it all jazz lately. But we did have a face like a couple of years ago when everything was Reagan. You got some amazing Caribbean artists that are like freaking nuts in Reagan. They're so good and they create something so crazy. That's probably the genre that I've played the least. Really? Oh. Procution wise. Yeah absolutely. Oh wow, interesting. Very ready that I have a player. Very ready to do everything. Did you ever sing that? I sang a few tracks. I sang a few Reagan tracks. All the genres you think Reagan... No I'm saying it's in them on minorities. Yeah for sure. That's what I mean. But yeah for sure I sang Reagan often. You know like in the beach weddings and stuff they were always a scat. That's why. Yeah. That's why. I'll be there. Yeah you definitely played it more than me. Yeah. Absolutely. Because I was too young as well so. Yeah. But I certainly, the genre I know the least. I know very little of it. Freaky yeah. It's dope though. It gives you such a high mood. But it's fairly easy to play in the drums. I mean I'm sure there's levels. I'm sure there is. It's a fight that's a really fun kind of... Yeah. Yeah. It is. Yeah. But you're not going to get a good mood. Yeah. But I'm just obsessed with this vocals. What are you guys saying? Oh there's a saxophone. Maybe we're going to get a mannal section. What way? A saxophone. I heard this guy. What a crap. Look at that. Watch. He has got both marly in the middle. Oh. Look at the saxophone there. I don't know. He has got a little girl at the side, doesn't he? What a fight. Yeah. He'll heal you. That's a big eye yeah. The bass and the bass. Yeah. That's a big eye. I'm going to get a little bit more. Yeah. The bass and the drums are so married. They're so good. Woohoo! Bye bye. This guy though. He's such a fun genre. That's a nice. That's a devil's. Yeah yeah yeah. Oh this is so outstanding. Yeah that's a deswegen. It's great! So, I'm so excited about reggae. If you play it in Latin America, you have timbales, right? It's very predominant instrument over there. And the sound of timbales produces. But like that bumping bumping bump. Yeah, it used a lot for that. Reggae, yeah. Even though I don't know, if you go to a place like Jamaica, what they would do, I think they would use a drum that is slightly different. You play with your hands. I don't know what you'd call it. I have actually no idea what you'd call it. Never in Spanish or in English. But in Latin America, we would use timbales to reproduce that. But he's trying to replicate with the snare, not getting possible to do. There's a completely different instrument. Yeah, well, you would do though, if you can grab a snare. Check the snare out of it. And use it like that. Getting a ramp up attention. And then it goes, ping. And then he comes to me here. He sounds like a timbal, yeah. I don't know what to explain that shit in English. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He wants timbal in English. I don't actually know where. Timbo. Tim, I think you know. People say, hey, when I go to my shop, whatever, timbales, they're like, oh, you used to play that. I was like, yeah, how do you say it? How do you say it? I don't even know what I'm talking about, though. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. So I guess the name stays the same. He's like, Juan, what do you call him in English? Juan. Juan. Same thing, right? Yeah. Pedro, what do you call him? Peter. Well, you can also say you can also argue that Juan is John. Juan is John. What? What? She is, man. Really? Yeah. What the fuck? Holy shit, what a discovery. Oh my god. Well, San Juan, same John. Yeah. No way. The same person. What? What? Oh my god, that's the same thing. Yeah, it's the same thing. What the fuck is Juan, John? I don't know. English made it that. Joanne, maybe, but what happened to the who, man? Like Juan, you know, John. What's up? I don't know how to say it. I'm going to make it all the right. I guess Pedro, Peter. That's probably because it's who came up with it first. Who translated the name first, actually? Well, those names. America was in Britain. No, I don't actually know because it's, it's say, those are biblical. These are biblical names, all right? So is whoever translated the Bible from Hebrew to Spanish from Spanish to English? I don't know, or however, way it happened. Well, I hurt my brain. I know. So who was responsible for the John? What the hell, Juan, man? It's Juan. Well, the Hebrew, like, the original name must be pretty different as well. Yeah, I would imagine, right? Yeah. What a cool singorite. Love his voice. What a heist is not. Go into the beach. What a cool door. Play open. Love that. Woohoo. Yes. Play the way we like it. Let us know more about it. Maybe Philippine or Regan. What other artist is there? This is obviously chocolate factory. I'd love to know the name of the singer. And yeah, if they've got any other life performances that we should check out, like in an actual festival or something, that would be cool. Let us know that I'm below. Like this. It's just on festival. But off Regan.
