 Guess who is back after she correct her back? Yes, she did! Yes, she did! So, We're back. It's been like 90 days since we did a TikTok population. If you like to send us videos, you can do so at WLSK15, both on Instagram and Baleska's TikTok. Correct, correct, correct. Yes. So, let's give... Oh, you can also join us on Discord. That's right. Plug the Discord. Plug it. Is this what my life has come to? Is... Do you look violence? Is this what my life has come to? Is this what you want? Is this what you want from me? He won! He won! No! Bro, he is violently... He won! He won! He won! Holy... Don! What's his name? Jepebos. Jepebos! Joseph Javier. He's broke. You were just born to be Filipino. You weren't just born to be the lady. You know people that's multiverse and all that stuff. And in different dimensions, people have lived different lives. In all 13 universes, you were Philippine. And you are Philippine. You, my friend, carry the Philippines with pride. And you're winning. You're winning. He's winning. Next. You know what? You know people really think about it. Come on, I can't be... And someone like you come down... Yeah, get it, get it, get it. No! You should've just see a fool with flip-flops. He's standing like two relax and a microphone in his hand. Game-owned. But you know what? Do we completely honest? I think he was a little bit nervous. And his friend... Oh, hey. Oh, wow. Dude. He's like Kana. What do you call that in English? It's a gray hair. It's so boring. That's so boring. Oh, very good. How you seen in Spanish? But I agree, yeah. That word in Spanish has power. Kana. You say that to anyone? Oh my god. Yeah, yeah. Okay, moving on. Next. Me and my friends decided to cover. Pastelio by Stankus Ola. And I am obsessed. It's one of the best songs of the years. It's one of the best bands we've discovered. Sonalanto. Macjame. Oh, what the... Sir! It's just so necessarily good. Oh, this is the problem I find, though. Like, that... Like, Sankis Ola and those singers. That band is like really special. The problemo is that in the Philippines, dude, it sounds mean to say, but it's like... It's hard to impress, because you go into someone's backyard. And at seven, you know, 9 p.m. Say, in Uman's session, talk... There is a band there. That could be a world class band as well. But they just decided to pursue something else. That's right. The guy just sells... I thought, no, he's like a salesman, not telephone salesman. But he, like, sings at the level that some of these viral clips of the wish-bosses, this super-produced band from Sony, Universe, and stuff like... They're everywhere. I actually think that's the reason why the Filipino audience is so appreciative of things that are really well done, because they can do them themselves. I think it's also, again, this might sound quite ignorant, but this is just my perception of things. I think it seems the music industry in the Philippines, obviously, is led by the market, and you're the bloody market, is you watching the people listening to the music. Prouist and, like, technicalities may not be as impressive anymore, because, like, the internet, the sort of viral videos and all this stuff, now it's just more on how... What emotions does it create? What memories does it bring? How has it been packaged? Like, the overall atmosphere created, stuff like that, I feel like that's really leading where the market is going, and not only in the Filipino music scene, but I feel, overall, in the world, it's kind of leaning towards... Things are so starting to evolve in that manner. So impressive that this guy's are essentially at the same level that some of the prosing, is that everyone loves him. Ah. Wow, he's really good. Okay, no, but the harmony is what it... What is the love in the face is that? Oh my, you leave out, you know what it means. That's dangerous. I can't even... You know what it means. Oh, nice. That's the harmony word, bro. You know what it means. This second part. You know what it means. Oh, the accident is such a nice studge. Do it again, do it again, do it again, do it again. Do it again, do it again. He's just so good. Is stupid right? He's got that, he's got that bucket hat power. I knew he was going to be a geo because he was wearing a bucket hat. Their name, one of the names is, I don't know which one it is. His name is Mai Kiwi Yanwea. Shout out to Mai Kiwi, the brother, bro. My god, I honestly, more of this. Can you just drop the whole cover somewhere? It's really blew my mind, but it's amazing. Watch this. Oh, big baby. Come on! You're singing, dude. That is so pretty cool. Obviously, the superb level of skill is like, to sing and play. Mental. But she has such a good understanding of what she should be doing. It's so cool, what the hell? It's amazing. She's such a good girl. Yeah, dude. If you think she's good, I think she's better. I wonder where. Always with this band. Is it? Or no, the song is by this band. Oh my god! Yeah, she's not getting off. She's gonna keep playing. Or maybe... I don't know. Listen. Like, I want to see the comments. See what people are saying. Oh, I already did it. Yeah. This was from Puli Music Festival last November in 2019. Oh, okay. This video is old as hell, but it's supposed to be like a couple of days ago. Wow. That's unreal. That's unreal. It's absolutely freaking fabulous. It's like a team of mine to play and sing at the same time. But the thing is, you're seeing it in a child, right? So just imagine what she will grow up into. Monsters. Because, yeah, if you already have this level of comfort in such an uncomfortable environment, I can only just imagine what the future will hold for her. Whether it decides to pursue music or not, the level of skill and the development... She's going to be a genius. Anyways, next. Dentes. Are they Dentes? Yes. But she murdered that. Can we just have a moment? What, Dentes? I love that Dentes. That's really good. It actually makes you smile though, because it's so contrasting to the actual music. She's bloody OP as well. She is so good. 2.3 million likes. Yeah. Jesus Christ. Give it another one. Recognize this guys? Michael. They're just having a blast. I love this about them. They're just like, sit there and like... Something like that. Oh, God. Good. Sir, please. Too easy for them. It's so stupid. I don't want to be alone. I'm fooling around. I think I like this version so much relative to the original. Yeah. Just wait for Michael. Wait for Michael. He comes in here like, it's nobody's business. Oh, he's drunk. Girl, I remember it's just like it was on yesterday. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. It's just like it was on yesterday. It's crazy. That's how easy it is in four years. It's just someone's bringing for hope. It's been without you just leaving me. Nothing at all. Dude, this is the problem. Like, none of my girlfriends are ever going to listen to this guy sing. None of them, bro. None. Zero. Zero. Nada. Nothing. Yeah, no. You know what? That's a very easy thing. This is madness. This is crazy. This guy is good at singing. No, you're sexy, buddy. Damn. I know she loud, Michael. She loud, though. He brought me a new song. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. I'm not drunk. So's that what you are doing. Oh well, without 가격, no water. This is real bullshit. It's just silicon. Where is my wine? My wine has some juice on it. There is my lip on it. I think it's in the box. I think it's some fucking money. I think it's money. I think it's from 별vic Some Marais. That's the finished! I really don't think that I wanted it to be copyrighted. So who do I need? The president. kicking him in the back, but it's fabulous. At this age, you wouldn't think that at this age, he would be having to resolve problems of issues at this level. This is like in singing level, this would be like, let me put it in something that probably all of us can understand, like math, right? It's like, it would be like year seven maths or like primary school maths and this kid is trying to solve simultaneous equations. You know, it's like, it's a little bloody hell. How is he learned all this stuff? Correct. And the way he's learned is the way we say all the time. The best way to learn how to sing is to sing in an unjudgmental environment for fun, experiment, emulate, try, we will get pretty damn far. That's correct. You know? I love how these videos go viral because they deserve it. Nice. This is that same song that girl we saw in the live game. Gahit Sandali. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a good song. It's great. Next. I want to take a box you anymore I won't be the first one to fall Whatever I must say before No I don't want to take a box You're too much Yeah, but who dog? Do you know who I want to collaborate with? Can you tell me just a minute? Just a minute, just two of them I don't want to think too much You got to like Mickey?
