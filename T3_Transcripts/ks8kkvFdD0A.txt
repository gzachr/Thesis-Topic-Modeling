Hi kids! Today we're in Bohol Beach Club!
Yey!
This is the room
This is the beautiful lady. And
this is the toilet and the shower. Uh hmm.
The bathroom.
A little step down so water don't run away.
There's me. Hi!
Yes, our video says it all we love Bohol Beach club and we will show you
why we think it's a great beach resort
here in Bohol probably one of the best.
We have been to the beaches in
California and France and even in the
islands of Maui and Oahu in Hawaii but
this Beach Resort is definitely on the
top of our list.
This resort took my breath away and my
stress away
with its beautiful white sand, calm
waters and a quiet atmosphere
it's my definition of a perfect holiday
getaway.
This is actually a private beach resort
but the neighboring Dumaluan beach
resort could actually experience the
same shores for a more affordable price.
Just a lot more crowded than it is over
here but that is part of the BBC's charm.
(music starts)
Every morning we head to the restaurant
for a buffet breakfast
and there's just a wide variety of food
to choose from.  From fruit and cereals to
pancakes bacon and eggs or to just
typical Filipino breakfast. Sinigang
white rice with lots of viands to choose
from.  My favorite actually is the corned beef.
But they're all delicious.
They even have a kiddie corner breakfast stand
and our boys love that.
Are you enjoying yourself? Are you
enjoying yourself anak ko?
Time to go in the water and we will show
you why we think Bohol Beach Club
beats the heck out of all the other
swimming and snorkeling experiences that we've had
in other countries that we've been
to.
Next time on pinay mom's blogs...
