We are finally in the Philippines
and we're starting in the capital city.
It's crazy here.
We were here a year ago,
but were met with a huge tropical storm
and decided to leave.
But we're back and warmly
welcomed by the wonderful Filipino people.
We rode the jeepneys with the locals.
I don't know if it's
actually taking us in the right direction
and walk through the city's
beautiful historical sites.
And of course, we tried some food
comparing the hugely popular
Jollibee's with the famous fried
chicken of Max's restaurant.
Can you hear that?
Yeah.
Do you know where
we should go to get a jeepney?
Ahh.
You ride the Divisoria...
and then... 
Kalaw.
Thank you.
We really appreciate it.
We won't get lost now.
We're trying to take the Jeepney.
Basically, it just says where
they're going on the side of it.
And you have to know where area
you're trying to go into and then
you just get in and you pay.
There’s available seats.
You can site there.
Sit here?
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
My friend, you sit down there.
You sure? 
Yeah, no problem.
After your safety.
Thank you, guys.
We made it on our first Jeepney ride. 
For us, 
It's a very unique form of transportation,
but here it's just a very common
form of public transportation. Like,
they're everywhere.
They have physical and actual stops,
and it was 20 pesos per person
to get on this very affordable
way to get around
if you know how to use it. For us,
it’ll probably be more expensive
because we don’t know where we’re going. 
Real quick, we've been traveling the world
for the past four years
and we've noticed how important family is
in so many cultures,
especially here in the Philippines.
We partnered
with MyHeritage for this video
so we can learn more about our families
and their history. Before this,
I honestly couldn't even tell you
the names of my great grandparents.
But now I know - and this is really cool
because we're in the Philippines - 
Not only was my great grandfather's
name, William, but he was born in 1906
and he even lived in the Philippines
for a few years.
Thanks to the over 19 billion
historical records on my heritage,
I was able to find some of his documents
all the way back from 1953.
You can also even colorize old black
and white photos of your family now.
And this is a picture of my great
grandmother, isn't she

Now, back to exploring 
this crazy city of Manila.
Maybe I’ll find a half cousin
or something.
Thank you so much.
Someone got up., so Nate has a seat now.
That was fun.
A lot of fun.
Yeah, They were so nice.
So they're very helpful.
Good job. 
We just made it up the street,
and now we have to go,
like, across another street.
Population of Metro Manila is insane.
It's one of the most densely
populated metro areas in the world.
There's 111,000 people per square mile.
And according to a survey by Waze
a few years ago,
there's the worst traffic in Southeast
Asia right here.
That was pretty cool. 
Which one?
We're just going straight on this street.
All right, let's get on this one up here.
Rizal Park, Intramuros.
Okay, salamat (thank you). 
Okay, the person at the end, 
Right behind the driver
is usually like the designated cashier,
and they hand the money to the driver
and give change back.
Which is why we're not sitting there
because we can't communicate
with the driver.
Or figure out the money situation.
We’re staying safe on this side. 
I honeestly have no idea if we’re
on the right Jeepney or not.
We're just going in the right direction.
I’m just watching it on 
Google Maps the whole time.
We still have a ways to go. 
All right.
I think we made it.
All on Jeepneys.
I'm so proud.
I’m so proud of you, 
that was impressive. 
Thank you.
Think it’s a little 
chaotic here? 
Oh, my God. 
It’s crazy, here. 
And it took over an hour and a half
to get on the jeepneys
from our hotel to Rizal Park.
So we're going to grab a soda,
hopefully in AC.
at the most popular chain restaurant
in the Philippines.
Jollibee’s
I definitely expected it to be busy,
but I didn't think it would be
this busy at 10 a.m.
There's no breakfast menu that I can see.
It's just pretty much lunch and dinner.
Hi, can we get the one piece
with Jolly Spaghetti, with a Coke Zero,
and then a regular fry and cold water
and then a mini sundae. 
Super ridiculous for me to order 
this right now, 
But I can't go to fast food
and not get ice cream.
I have a problem. And it’s 
really good soft serve. 
I gotta try this spaghetti.
I don't know why I'm so excited to
Try spaghetti from a fast food restaurant.
But I am.
I guess it's what I expected.
It's good spaghetti,
but the sauce is really sweet.
Which we were actually warned
that it would be sweet.
Much sweeter than we're used to in the US.
So sweet.
It's like not even tomato.
Big piece of chicken. 
The gravy is nice and salty. 
Oh, I like this. 
So this isn’t the best fried chicken
We're actually going to be trying
some really good fried
chicken later in the video,
but this is pretty good.
It's nice and crispy and super salty
and pretty flavorful.
I like it with the gravy. 
Thank you ma’am, sir. 
That's one thing we noticed in Manila.
There is literally nowhere
that they don't have security.
Anywhere you go, they’re there.
So this is one of the 
few, rare parks in Manila.
Since there's so many people,
so little space,
there's not a lot of room
for greenery or nature.
But Rizal Park is the biggest
and the prettiest
since the Philippines is over
7000 different islands.
You don't really see the architecture
influence that you do like in South
America from colonialism,
because they didn't go to all the islands.
They went to Manila,
and that's basically where they stayed.
In the cultural aspect,
it definitely bled out to all
the islands.
You see a lot of Filipinos
with Spanish last names.
There's also a ton of similarities
in Filipino language
and Spanish. The numbers are all the same, 
random words like “como esta?”
A lot of it is similar, so we can kind of
actually get by just a little bit,
but probably not actually.
It’s so hot. It's 11:45 a.m. 
It's 90 degrees,
not a cloud in the sky today. U.V.
index is super high.
It's like eight, which is ridiculous.
And about 66% humidity.
And you feel every percentage of that.
This park is called Rizal Park
and it's named after the national hero
of the Philippines,
Jose Rizal, which is standing right here
behind me in a bronze statue.
This monument was put up in 1913
and his remains
were actually moved from where
they were originally laid to here.
He was executed,
but he really led the movement
for the freedom of the Philippines
from their colonizers.
So he is like not a national hero.
He's like the national hero.
And this whole park is named after him.
And there's like a little thing
we're going to walk through over there
“I have to believe much in God because I have lost my faith in man.” - Jose Rizal
Do you want to just add
like ten destinations
so we can stay in this air conditioning?
That was a very, very nice ride over. 
And now we’re back out in the heat. 
I think my brain doesn't work in the humidity. 
Do you want to get something 
to cool that brain down?
Yeah. 
Let’s get a cold drink. 
So I've been
really loving buying stuff for our home
and I like getting like souvenirs
from every place where we go, but
not the chatchky stuff that's like a wooden 
Jeepney because it's just going to collect dust.
What are you going to do with that?
So I’ve been getting useful stuff.
So in Portugal, we got a,
water container that I have
by my bedside at night
and then now I got a tray.
It's like a cutting board but it's
decorative and we're going to use it
for like cheese plates and stuff.
But it's made out of
wood from the Philippines,
in the Philippines by Filipinos.
Okay.
We're now at the most historic
part of Manila.
This is Intramuros.
It's like kind of calm and quiet
and doesn't
really feel like you're in Manila anymore.
So the Intramuros is
kind of a hub for colonialism
in the Philippines.
Originally built
by the Spanish in the 1500s,
it was used
just like defense and military barracks.
When the Americans took over,
there was a “battle” held here in Intramuros.
One fun fact about the Americans
taking over is that they didn't
really feel like they needed the defense
as much as the Spanish,
so they drained the moat
and made a golf course.
And the golf course still stands
right here behind me today.
And then during the Second World War,
the Japanese military occupied this fort
for about two years before losing,
at which point the Philippines
got their independence. 
It’s pretty neat when you can just
come into one of these places
and almost get lost in them
and forget about the city outside until,
of course, like you get here
and there's the driving range
and then
there's there's these big skyscrapers.
But other than that, I think it's really neat.
You get immersed in it.
It’s really good.
Well done.
We actually made it inside the fort.
Now, I kind of thought
the whole thing was the fort, but
it's just like this little corner part.
There's a museum here.
It's actually closed on Mondays,
and today’s Monday..
Museums at a place like this 
usually mean air conditioning.
So I'm kind of bummed, but that’s okay.
This area was built as 
a barracks
and a school for petty officers,
but is most famously known
for holding the chapel cell where
Jose Rizal spent his final evening
before his execution.
So 86% of the Filipino
population is Roman Catholic,
and this is the only Southeast
Asian country that identifies as Catholic
or Christian.
All indications of the Spanish
colonialism.
Behind me is a Cathedral of Manila.
Oh, wow.
Wow, it feels so good in here. 
We're at Max's, which is a chain
restaurant all over the Philippines,
and there's a few even in California.
Their slogan is... 
“The house that fried chicken built”
and that dates back to how it all started.
Max was a Filipino man who was cooking
fried chicken out of his house
and feeding into American
GIs during the Second World War.
It was so freaking good.
They just started to offer
and pay him money to eat there.
And thus he opened a cafe.
And then this house of Max was just built
and exploded all over the Philippines.
Let's dig in.
It's like juicy, crispy fried chicken.
You can hear the crunch. Wow.
And now the most important part.
We just got the regular fried
chicken platter.
They have spicy ones, too,
But you eat it with banana
ketchup, which sounds really weird,
but it's not like the sweet bananas
that were used.
So it smells like banana ketchup.
And then they're famous worcestershire sauce put it right on top.
Oh, man,
you rip off a little piece and then
dip right in
That’s so good. 
not nearly as salty as the fried chicken
we had earlier today.
But a nice, thin crispy layer on the outside.
Not too much batter on the outside.
It kind of lets of skin do it’s thing
when it’s deep fried and the chicken’s
so juicy inside
but it's a nice little sweet
addition to the chicken
which kind of leads me to my next point.
I think that Filipinos really like to eat, 
I don’t know if it’s sweet things in general,
but anything to do with like tomato paste
or ketchup, they like it sweet. 
because we just got our tofu fries
and it is served with a side
of white sugar, which I've never seen
and would have never expected.
I think the banana 
ketchup is actually sweeter
with the worcestershire sauce,.
It kind of tastes like sweet banana.
But I like it
We literally carry wet wipes with us
because napkins are hard to come by
and this is really in need of wet wipes.
So we got lucky because
they actually accept credit card here,
but that is not the norm in Manila.
Almost everything is cash based.
They have the peso here
and it's about 50 pesos for every U.S.
dollar.
And there it is again, a peso,
another Spanish influence.
30 minutes still?
Yeah. 
Jammin’ over here.
So the thing we keep talking about
today is just
how densely populated Manila is,
and just the Philippines, at large.
The Philippines are composed
of 7000 islands.
And all of that landmass
is only 75% of California
where we lived before we traveled.
But the big difference is
the population here
is 113 million,
and in California, it's only 35 million.
And there's 13 million alone
right here in Manila.
It's just mind boggling.
So we didn't know this until this morning.
But they are trying to deal
with that problem
a little bit as much as you can
by building
land on the water right here.
I think they're trying to like
dam it up first through the outside.
So they've already done
like a whole half circle.
That's crazy.
This is not something you see often.
Randy's Donuts.
That is big time California.
And we have never seen that anywhere else
in the world.
McDonald's, KFC.
Sure.
It's definitely not Randy's Donuts,
Is this, like, the real Randy's Donuts?
Yes, ma'am.
Thank you. Thank you.
It’s the real Randy’s Donut, actually.
It’s good? 
Yeah, it’s a really good donut.
It's like straight from 
a donut shop in California.
Can't believe it. But Randy's.
I guess I'll start looking for those
in all the countries we go to.
I'm trying to cool down.
And the laziest way possible
with the least amount of movement.
And I found a way.
Wife?
Husband.
We've been outside like,
I don't know, less than 5 minutes now
and we're already finding shade and a seat.
how are we going to make it through
this day, beautiful?
I’m trying.
