all right I woke up this morning here in Manila 
and I was like I want to go to a new place today  
a new destination inside the Philippines where I 
have never been to before so I'm very spontaneous  
I want to leave ASAP as soon as possible so let me 
have a look on Google on Skyscanner which flights  
are available I'm using Skyscanner usually to 
check for available flights and what you can do  
here which is pretty cool I just type in Manila 
airport which is the newest airport to me at the  
moment and then I put in today's date and I search 
for Philippines and then it shows me all the  
flights that are available from Manila to anywhere 
in the Philippines so the list is pretty long lots  
of available flights I want to leave like in the 
next hour so I don't want to wait until tomorrow  
or the evening ASAP so lots of options let me 
choose a flight and then we head to the airport  
foreign
yes I'm Ken
all right the flight is booked it's 
leaving in like two hours and 20 minutes  
how long do we need to the airport sir 
how long do we need like half an hour  
I think uh 20 30 minutes 20 30 
minutes okay yeah should be all right
thank you very much have a good day 
okay we have arrived at the airport  
still have let me check my uh watch uh one 
hour and 45 minutes to departure and yeah  
I'm flying with Philippine Airlines today which 
I threw with them like a week ago when I flew  
from Cebu back to Manila and I had a yeah not 
a good experience with them while I was already  
at the airport they told me the flight is 
delayed for like four hours and then like  
30 minutes before the new departure time they 
delayed it again for another two hours so in  
the end I was waiting at the gate for like six 
hours and they didn't even offer it like free  
snacks or water so let's hope today is going 
to be a better experience for them afternoon
do you need to see that ticket yeah okay okay  
you're a vlogger yes yeah welcome 
to Philippines thank you thank you
okay Sanchez you're wondering if uh you 
arrive at airports in the Philippines  
you always have to go through security 
two times there's always one security  
right at the entrance and then 
again of course uh at the gate
foreign
let me check in counter Philippine Airlines
13.5 today is the flight leaving on time today  
okay good so no delays today so far 
at least yes I make YouTube videos
thank you welcome to the Vlog yeah and 
you can see we have Security check over  
there and then a second one right here so 
you maybe need to bring some extra time  
in case the airport is busy yeah two 
Security checks ten can take a little while
but yeah today the airport doesn't seem to 
be too busy so arriving until here was now  
like five minutes so very easy today so I 
need to go to gate number 15 actually I'm  
very good in time now one and a half hours now 
so a little bit more even so no stress today
all right and while I was waiting here 
I was scrolling through booking.com and  
deciding for a place to stay tonight 
found a good hotel so at least I think  
it's going to be a good one I hope so uh yeah 
so Hotel situation also sold for today hello
thank you thank you so ready to board and by the 
way the flying time is two hours which I think  
is one of the longest flights that you can take 
within the Philippines so maybe that gives you  
a little clue where I'm going today and it looks 
like we are leaving on time so Happy Days hello
all right as far as I can see I am the 
only Foreigner on this flight there  
was no other Westerner on the gate and also 
here on the plane I see no one else foreign
space especially if it's a little bit of a 
longer flight I mean two hours is not that long
everyone's production we encourage everyone to 
craft a social differences whenever possible  
and avoid specifying fruits and Mountain 
View spider Laboratory thank you bye-bye
and I have arrived but yeah before I will tell you 
where we are right now let me head to the hotel  
first okay so the airport here seems to be small 
uh actually let me check if I can get it there  
It's usually the easiest option so we do have 
grab here as well I'm going to the city center  
let's see if we can find 
the grab oh photograph Taxi  
my guess would be that it would also be possible 
to find a regular metered taxi over there  
but I have a grab already okay it's gonna 
be here in two minutes this is my grab
okay hello
I'm Ken yes
all right okay yes right  
how long do we need what how many minutes 
uh 15 to 30 minutes 15 to 30 minutes okay
I have a question what what language 
do you speak here bisaya or Tagalog
little English okay no problem but 
the main language is uh bisaya here
okay so it's the same as in 
Cebu where I was last week  
same like in Cebu yeah okay so you say la me 
and not massage okay I learned that already
yeah like in different parts of the Philippines 
they speak different languages they have many  
different dialects actually so the two main ones 
as far as I learned so far are Tagalog and bisaya  
so Tagalog spoken in the northern part in Manila 
bisaya was also spoken in Cebu where I was at the  
last weeks do you say kamusta here kamusta so 
just kamusta is okay okay kamusta how are you
check it out there's a stall over there selling 
lots and lots of durian fruits I'm not sure if  
you can see it but all the cars going by 
now but yeah the Dewey and fruit which is  
also known as the world's smelliest fruit in 
case you don't know it's very popular in this  
area this region of the Philippines is very 
famous for durian fruits so I might have to  
give it another try I tried durian two times 
before in Thailand and in Malaysia and both  
times to be honest I didn't like it but maybe 
I need to try it again here in the Philippines
another
one and it is the next day now and yeah I am in my 
hotel room I'm having this little hotel room here  
with two beds it's basically right in the city 
center so the location is quite cool paying one  
and a half thousand uh pesos here per night but 
yeah I might ask for a room change today because  
yeah I'm looking right to the main road here and 
there were a lot of noisy Street dogs outside  
here during the night so that was actually yeah a 
little bit noisy during the night but yeah before  
we now go out to explore the city and before I 
will finally tell you where I am I would like to  
show you really quick a new travel Gadget that 
I have been using for a few weeks now yeah I am  
using a sleeping mask now from a company called 
Manta sleep and I am someone who's usually a very  
light sleeper so I sometimes have a hard time to 
fall asleep for example when the hotel room that  
I'm sleeping in is not completely dark for example 
this hotel room near the curtains are not totally  
blocking out all the lights and yeah because 
it's a main road there was basically light all  
night shining into the room and yeah sometimes 
when it's like that I'm having a hard time to  
fall asleep so this sleeping mask right here 
helps me to fall asleep because it does totally  
block out any light and yeah it's very easy to 
wear no pressure on the eyes and I almost don't  
even feel it anymore when I'm wearing it and 
you're having a good sleep is very important  
to me because honestly I feel that I am not 20 
anymore so when I'm not having a proper sleep  
I really feel it in the morning that I am not 
as energized as I should be and yet a sleeping  
mask is also quite helpful if you want to get 
a quick nap in like airplanes buses or trains  
where it's usually quite bright so I just put on 
the mask to block out any of the slides and here  
the mask that I am having here is from a company 
called Mental Sleep and they are also sponsoring  
today's video they offer several different types 
of sleeping masks which you can check out on their  
website which I will link down below and they 
also provided me with a special discount code  
for you guys for my subscribe bus you can get 
10 off if you use the code can at the checkout  
and they also have a money back guarantee 
so you can test out the sleeping mask for 60  
days and if you don't like it you can send it 
back and you will get a refund click the link  
down below thanks to Manta sleep for sponsoring 
today's video and now let's explore this town
noisy here let me get away from that so the 
streets are looking like this yeah let's have  
a first quick look around the area around my 
hotel and yeah where am I I am in Davao maybe  
some of you guessed it already right Davao 
one of the southernmost cities here in the  
Philippines it's located on the island of Mindanao 
so very south in the Philippines so we basically  
flew from the northern part of the country 
from Manila to the very southern end of the  
country I'm very excited to be here if you have 
been here before or you know the air we are and  
you have any recommendations let me know in the 
comment section I'm happy to to hear about it  
thank you and what I see a lot here is these uh 
bicycles so like tricycles but uh without a motor  
so uh like a like old school way you know 
oh we also have the regular tricycles here  
oh it's always exciting to be somewhere new a part 
of the country where I have never been to before  
and yeah hello all right now I'm looking 
for the the there's like a People's Park  
or something yeah the streets are this street 
yes but I looked on Google Maps it's here right  
or maybe I was wrong let me have a 
look oh yeah it's dead oh yeah okay
shout outs shout out
okay you have uh 10 seconds 
to shout out whatever you want  
promote your business your Instagram what do you 
want to shout out no shout out okay a joke okay  
no problem hello okay so I just walked here yeah 
okay thank you thank you oh I was indeed wrong  
was walking into the wrong direction yeah I saw a 
little Park on Google Maps and obviously you know  
I arrived here yesterday very spontaneously 
so I haven't done much research about this  
place yet but sometimes I like that arriving 
somewhere no research just gold spontaneously  
and see what's going to happen sometimes these 
experiences turn out to be the best hello hello
I'm looking for the People's Park
it's over there right yeah yeah I can walk 
oh yeah how many minutes 15 minutes 15  
minutes okay that's not too far okay okay you 
have your bicycle like it's like taxi right
how about to be honest I feel bad if I let 
you ride me around with a bicycle because  
I have strong legs I'm a young guy so uh 
I don't want to let you riding me around  
with a bicycle you know but this is like 
a taxi here right okay okay ah okay I'm  
going to walk use my strong legs where are you 
going I want to check out the people's house
thank you
yeah to be honest I don't know if I would feel 
comfortable letting an older man riding me around  
the town with a bicycle when I am young having 
strong legs you know I'm not sure but on the  
other side that's how they make money and by the 
way Davao is actually hello Davao is the largest  
city in the Philippines not by population but 
by the size of the land area the largest city  
and also the population is quite High one and a 
half million people live in the city which makes  
it also Yeah by population one of the biggest 
cities in the Philippines yeah I'm just hello  
hello oh I see you have fresh pineapples here 
how much is the pineapple hey can I get one back
I think this is a papaya 
papaya and this one mango mango  
oh yeah I like to eat fresh fruit in the 
morning but that's the pineapple please
oh that's already a huge bonus of this hotel 
that I have fresh fruits and walking distance  
are you here every day yes okay 20 pesos

it to the maybe I can take it to the park

Southeast Asian Street Suite vendors

as always so exciting to be in a new place 
for the first time I I said that in other  
videos before if you arrive in a new place 
in a new country in a new area where you  
have never been to before the best thing you 
can do is just go out walk around get First  
Impressions and yeah don't plan much just go 
out be spontaneous and see what will happen
oh this seems to be the the Jeep Nissan they look  
a little bit smaller than the ones in 
Manila and also different types of cars

Monday to Sunday is park rules no lettering no 
smoking no illegal drugs okay we have a lot of  
rules here what is not allowed in the park but 
I guess I won't be doing any of these things  
okay welcome to People's Park Davao City and I 
guess this is an eagle okay looks nice so far
I think the the roof is a is a durian hello
I always sometimes a little bit shy but 
they always say I want to say hello and  
wondering why they are wearing completely white 
I think maybe this is the school uniform here  
completely and right so maybe they're just coming 
from the school or having lunch break or something  
but where was I um I think that the roof is 
a durian and as I said earlier in this video  
this area is very uh known for their durians so 
yeah I might have to try durian here once again
so yeah it's actually quite a nice 
park you can have a walk around sit  
somewhere in the shade like I am doing 
here nice trees around here and yeah I'm  
just trying the pineapples here and I have 
to say they are actually very delicious  
quite sweet pineapples but very Juicy and 
Delicious so I really like the pineapples here
awesome snack I guess I will be getting 
these pineapples every morning now from  
from that guy over there yeah 
lots of families around here  
I would say it's a it's a park for families 
especially little shits little kids there's  
also I don't know if you can hit on camera 
speakers that are playing music the whole time  
not so probably too too quiet for 
the for the camera to pick up but uh  
yeah creates a nice atmosphere in the park 
here actually I just found these pictures  
here and it's from the kada yawan festival 2017 so 
that's quite a while ago but these pictures look  
like very happening cool Festival oh I would 
really like to see something like this here  
looks like like a traditional Festival 
probably wearing traditional clothings  
here maybe doing some traditional dances 
that looks actually very very interesting
I would really love to see something like 
this here anywhere in the Philippines  
not specifically only down south here 
but if there's any Festival something  
like that happening anywhere in the 
country in the next weeks or months  
please let me know in the comment section 
that would be very interesting to see
and yeah we have Christmas season in the 
Philippines already centuck sauce is also here and  
actually most of the music that is playing in the 
park and the speakers is a Christmas music which  
uh yeah to me it seems to be still weird having 
Christmas time when it's like 30 plus degrees  
outside sun shining like I associate Christmas 
time with like snowing and freezing cold outside  
but yeah that's just uh yeah in Germany it's like 
that so after all these years in Southeast Asia  
it's still not normal for me to have Christmas 
music and Christmas trees with like 30 degrees  
and bright sun shining and yeah if you are new
