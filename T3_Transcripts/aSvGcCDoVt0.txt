 What? What? This is what they call a multi-calve. But we would have called it Jeep name. We are heading back to Nagaro Island because our friend Andy is having a birthday. I'm sure he's going to be what, 69, 70? How old are you now, Andy? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I think he's not even... It doesn't even look like he's 30, my gosh. Anyway, we're really excited to go back. It is holy weekend. We wanted to do more of it, but we already had this book and oh my goodness, it's been a little crazy. But the island is all about holy week. When you arrive, they've changed everything just for this weekend so that they can handle a huge amount of people. Yesterday was the big deal where you'll see, I don't know, it'll be hard to show. There's a cross way up on that hill up there. And there's a pilgrimage that people take to go all the way up there. And so it starts down in the village and works its way up as a big parade. We missed out on it, it was yesterday, but we didn't show you what we did for holy week. And it was so incredible and you need different, it was a lot of fun. But now, look at this, we got this whole multi cab all to ourselves. They're digesting. To go to Negrow Island, they quickly leave what they were doing at the island from Grabas. And we said no problem, we got something. It was trike for this. It's trike with about 600 pesos, it's a 20 minute drive. Or 1200 pesos to take this vehicle. And we had a lot of stuff and everything, so it just made sense. But if you have a big family, you want to go to one of the islands here? 1200 pesos, you can put it in for everybody here. And we have to be by the road, isn't it? It's like you got bust here itself, it's really crazy. It really is, it really is. Let's get started. Here we go. Look at the luncher brunch, I guess it was waiting for us. Yeah, it depends what time you got here. We got friends visiting from Germany or family, actually, to say, listen, oh, you're ready now? Yeah, what? This guy is the birthday boy, okay? Tomorrow. Tomorrow he becomes old, an old old man. 29 forever, my friend. 29 forever, that's the way it goes. Beautiful lunch, are you ready? Yes, let's do it. You think the whole thing? Oh, oh, just the bottom, right? Yeah, do whatever you want to. It's fine, make him fun, dude. Happy Easter. That's, this is my... Yeah, I was gonna say, what part of that did you do? Is that polygraphy? Is it amazing? No, Julia, you know what? If it doesn't work out, get your school teacher anymore. We found you a new career. A child, a polygraphy. A polygraphy. Is that still a job that I don't know? I don't know. I don't know, maybe. Pinterest would love you. Yeah, Pinterest will definitely love you. Yeah, like a stand or something. Wow. Look at the last few. So professional. Yeah, because we're currently holding out. Easter in the Philippines. Easter egg update time. Look at all the beautiful eggs. Wow. Too much talent to this table, guys. Too much talent. I'm gonna put the Easter Bunny out of business. This is tank, by the way. Hello, tank. Is that tank? I don't know. We have seven dogs here this weekend. Everybody's here to celebrate. It is. Oh, maybe that's not tank. That might be princess. I don't remember. Everybody is down here that could come from family because it's Andy's birthday. So Andy is the first son that runs it to this day. And we're here to celebrate with him. And I believe he said it's gonna be his twin aunt birthday again. Forever. Andy and Resort is actually incredibly busy this weekend. A lot of families, big families, like 35, 27, that kind of thing. I have been coming here. So we had over 100 here yesterday. We're small and that's a big number. And it's gonna be over 100 again today. One of the guests here brought their American bullies and look at them. Hi. Hi. Oh, hello. Wow. Look at colors. Oh, my. You guys are so cute. Oh, yes. Hello. Hello. Don't have to pull on your ropes, Art. I can come to you. I can come to you. Don't worry. Don't worry. Okay. Okay. Look at this. What is a birthday in the Philippines without Le Chon and oh, my goodness. That looks most watering. How big is this one, boys? What's the weight? 60 kilos. 60 kilos. That's just for the birthday boy. What's everybody else eating? Hey. Hey. He's like, hey, don't call me out like that. It is too hot for me to stand here. Wow. I don't know how you're doing it. Say, boy, by the way. I'm vegan. Yeah. He's a vegan. Yeah. That's just hopeful. He's the... Hi. Hello. Say hello, by the way. There we go. I was in Nagarou Island, to the Britain and this birthday day. That's right. All the way, retired now from Singapore. Yes, retired here now. Fantastic. Yeah, this is a good time. All the guys hang out here though. Drinking the tan to eye, making the pork. Looks wonderful. What? What? What's up, baby? We're going to have a party. Good job. Good job. Good job. What? I think I'm big it is. No problem. No problem. No problem. Hey. Hello, everybody. Is it warm? Is the water warm? Yeah. Yeah. You got the amount of water in here. It's all here. It's all here. It's all here, but it's all here. Yeah. Do you need a fan squad? Are you doing it brother? Good? Awesome. Hello guys. See? This is the fun squad over here. Been here all afternoon. What is any of that blood pudding called again? Blood. Sorry? Bloodie. Bloodie. Bloodie, bloodie. Yeah. Yeah. All the attestats from the paper, correct? All the inner? Very native. Native dish. Over there? Ah, that's the head. That's the head? Oh, and the head. In the fish. And all the fish looks fantastic though. Wow. This is dessert. And of course, he's celebrating the fish. Oh. Very beautiful. This one is a native of Abu Dhamma. And there are enough Philippines to celebrate the Mood this one. This is a native. Yes. The pig's head. Oh, the nutrition. Yeah. In this.

I'm birthday. Happy birthday. Happy birthday. Happy birthday. One more time. Happy birthday. Happy birthday. Happy birthday. Happy birthday. Happy birthday. Happy birthday. Happy birthday. Happy birthday. Happy... Happy... Yay! Happy... Happy birthday. Happy birthday. Happy birthday. The Oh Ok sis Oh my god. There's no subtle things there. Not at all. Very blinged. I love it. Absolutely. I love it. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. How was the food? Really really good. Delicious? Yeah. And you were a great singer. Well, this is our final morning here on Nega Rao. And every once in a while, we get sent a product. And this product is called Fluent Talk. And we get these translator things sent to us. And the last one we got was from the same company actually, where it was Ear Pods that you wear in your ear. And then if anybody around you's speaking another language is telling you in your ear what they're saying. And it was pretty cool. Or if you give them the left and you hold the right, you can have a conversation back and forth. It was really cool. But they said, you know what? We want something that actually is a standalone. So this thing here, you can put a SIM card into it. Or you can just connect it to any Wi-Fi, or you can pair it up with your hotspot on your phone. Or there are certain languages that are available offline. And so I thought I'd give it a shot and try it out. It doesn't, it says Filipino on here. It doesn't do a long go. We've already tried a bunch of long go words. So it's Tagalog, obviously, the biggest language. Here in the Philippines. But I'm going to try the German out. Because my friend here, Mike, is half Filipino, half German. And he's down here with me at Nagarow Island, and he's even going to have a wedding here soon, which is amazing. And so we're here in Paradise. And we're going to test out this fluid talk here to see how well it does with German. All right, here we go. Turning it on now. It has also photo, by the way, it has a camera on the back here. So if you were in, he was mentioning the same thing. If you were in China or something like that, and you can't read the signs, obviously, you can actually take a picture of the sign and it will tell you what the sign says. Very, very smart and pretty useful in a lot of countries. So this has one, there's one click translation. You pick your languages, so I'm going to say English to German. Hello, my name is Michael. Hello, my name is Michael. Oh, that's true. Okay, okay. Now you say something different. Hello, zusammen. My name is Michael. We come on the channel from Mike. Hello, everyone. My name is Michael. Welcome to Mike's channel. Hey, look at that. That's pretty decent. Yeah, I think it's pretty decent. If you're looking for a way to go to a country that doesn't speak a lot of your language, it might be useful. So I'll give him a link down below because they sent me to me anyway, so why not? And yeah, back to Imparadise here in Nagarou Island. Are you excited for your wedding, though? I'm really excited. Yeah. But you were actually already married, but you're having your Filipino wedding. Yes, almost Filipino family here. And family from the US and everybody else. Yeah. And he was here, even as a child, he was running around here for like three or four months at a time, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, on the island here. And you've seen it like between different times that typhoons have taken it out, and basically changes how the resort looks because they rebuild, and it'll be rebuilt differently. You remember when these cabins were all made of bamboo? Yeah, that's true. Yeah, now they're all concrete. But yeah, it's a beautiful place. We really enjoy it here. It is like the back to nature and just tropical paradise sort of thing. Maybe the fact they don't have a lot of internet and cell phone signal here is actually a plus and a bonus, because you can't do anything, but just chat with other people and hang out, have a beer with them. You know, there's a very big positive to that. Going back to the roots. Yeah, going back to the roots for sure. And we had such a good time here. Oh my goodness. But today is the day we have to go back home, sadly. But we had such a good time, and it's only like an hour away for us from our house, all the way to the island. It's only one hour, so that's not bad. We can visit again very, very soon. Busy weekend here, by the way. Tons sold out every single day for a whole week, and we met so many great people here on the island. Shout out to all of you if you are here watching the channel that you were there on the weekend. Say hello in the comments. All right, guys. See you later. Bye-bye. Bye. Bye.
