 The Philippines, home is some of the most beautiful islands in the world. And some of the most amazing food and culture you'll ever experience. It's also home to the most friendly, humble, Filipino people that live day by day with smile on their faces, regardless of the challenges they may face. As a Filipino American, they grew up in the USA. I wanted to humble myself and experience what life is like living like a Filipino in poverty. The goal is one month living in the Philippines province on a 200-pacel with day budget, which is $4 USD. I must live like a Filipino in experience every day just like my ancestors who still live and still living to this day. So join me on this new journey of becoming a true Filipino, Pyramid. What is up guys? Welcome back to day 18 of living a simple lifestyle in the Philippines province. In a tent on a budget, what else now? They shoes now? Things. So guys, if you didn't know the Philippines is having very bad typhoon weather and guys, it kind of took a toll on our tent last night. Our tent was flooded. Not a trouble last night fixing the tent. Yeah, we had a lot of trouble. We still managed to sleep in it, but guys, you guys can see a lot of our stuff is ruined. There's a lot of sand everywhere. Sand on the pan too. Yeah, a bunch of sand everywhere. Hey mama, girl, what's up? What's up with you? All the animals are safe. Rocks are sleeping right now. So guys, to be honest, we don't feel like doing anything today. Work-wise, because we did a lot yesterday. So for today's video guys, we're going to do a ultimate Filipino food. So today's video guys, we're going to do an ultimate Filipino food experience video for you guys. So we are going to be eating at a Filipino buffet today. Yes, and some exotic food that they have as well. But it's not just any regular Filipino buffet. This is a famous Filipino buffet. Why are they famous now? Because they get a lot of customers and then they're very famous in Facebook. Okay, so they got a lot of followers. So is there food good though? That's the thing. I don't know, we'll find out. So guys, the buffet we're going to is called Barriotic Kitchen. Barriotic Kitchen. Barriotic Kitchen guys. So if you haven't been a Barriotic Kitchen, they're very, huh? You must try it, girl. Yeah, you got it. Well, we don't know. How do you guys feel when you're coming to the place? Yeah, so we're going to try it out. We're going to test if it's an authentic style for Filipino food. So guys, it is a little pricey. Well, actually, it's very affordable. Before our budget, it is a little pricey. I believe it's 250 pesos per person. So it is going over the budget today, guys. But like I said, sometimes when you're living in the Philippines, it gets stressful. So we're going to have to go over that budget because we don't feel like doing it. Yesterday was hectic. So it is what it is. So guys, let's go try this ultimate Filipino food tour. We'll see you when we get there. Peace. So now, I thought it was going to be more packed. Yeah, I think it's on the go.

We got all this delicious authentic Filipino food. So they also gave us some complimentary water. Or do we have to pay for this? No, it's not free. They even got their own logos. So that's pretty cool. Let's try the water, because it's so hot out there. It's so hot. Before we get to the food, let's get a quick sit. Oh, yeah. Oh, it's a perfect day to come here because there's not a lot of people. The weather is good, you feel that breeze? Yes. Yeah, it's perfect. So, take me through everything and let's try it. Okay. Let's try. What do you want me to try first? The lechon, obviously. Where's the lechon? Here. This is it? Okay, we're gonna need a fork for that. Here's the lechon. Is this supposed to be tender or fatty or what? Fatty, tender and crunchy. Okay, so we got the lechon. I didn't bring it. Oh, let's pray. Let's do it. We always forget the prayer, huh? Oh, thank you so much for this opportunity that we're able to eat and have a praying. We are so thankful and thankful. And also we pray for the people, the first time watching our video, this past our life, and I pray that they will have a personal relationship with me. You met? Now you may have to talk a little louder. It's a lot of ambience. Yeah, so here's the lechon fork. Let's cheers, not? This is your favorite? Yes. Okay, let's try it. So crunchy. Whoa. Oh my god. The dough is so good. It tastes like jichuron. It literally melts in your mouth. This is so good, but I feel like you need this. You have a heart attack. Mmm. No. It's a little high now. It's so oily though. Mmm. You need some rice. Wow. It's amazing. All right, we're going to rate that right now. Lechon? Ten out of ten. Ten out of ten. Let's get it. Okay. Sago with the fork barbecue. No, that's so good. All right. We'll come back for more. For the barbecue. Is this the same as lechon, but it's just not fried? Oh yeah, but it's not. It's just like it has barbecues. Cheers. I think it's so sweet. All right, cheers. It's not. Mmm. It's so sweet. It has got a sweet taste, but it's still like very tender. A little fatty, but tender. I'm glad we got more of that. Watch the downwards one right. Oh no, let's get into it. You give eating up? You're hungry? No, it looks so good. It's unlimited. Oh, the food is so fine with it. We're just slow down. It's unlimited. You can get as much as you want. Let's try it up. What else did we get to get there? Let's try this now. What is this? I don't have that. What is it? Oh, this is running upon set. So this is chicken, right? What is it here? What is the pancetta? Oh. How is the mouth full of bones? Where did you eat that like that? I suppose not too. Where do I spit it now? I don't know. We're gonna have to eat the bone, then. No. It's fine. I'll just eat the bone, it's fine. What is wrong with you? Go try the pancetta noodles. It's good. The famous pancetta, legendary. Did you make pancetta for me? Yeah, I did. But it's this like, I told you, there's different types of pancetta. Yeah, you did make pancetta. This is some mixed pancetta. It's like the thin one and the thick one. So this is the thin. This is all filled with the flavors. There's a philipinipilip that if you give pancetta, it's a philipinipilip. Really? Yeah. It's pretty healthy. I've been staring this one down for a long time now. Hopefully this is super tender. Look at this guys. For 300. You can get all this food on limited. And look at the quality of the chicken. It's right. It's so soft and tender. And the sauce is so sweet that it's very good. It's perfectly cooked. Can you rate that up? I think I would rate that it's solid 8.5. I gotta get that at 9. I'll come back for that. So now let's get into it more. Philipinipilip fried chicken. I'm so tired of fried chicken. This looks good to me. It looks crispy. Let's try it. I don't like fried chicken. It is dry. You gotta try that. I think coriander is supposed to tear off me. You gotta try it. Not a fan. I think it's good. 8 out of 10. Yeah, not a fan. Jolly be still better guys. Alright now. That's my noodle. I didn't get my noodle. So my noodle? It has pork liver, pork, and bacon. But noodle. What's the sauce? It's like tomato sauce? Tomato sauce. Yeah. Is it good? I probably won't get seconds of that, but it's good though. I'll give that. 7 out of 10. 7 out of 10. Let's try the ribs. You both got ribs. More ribs. Take our bowl of the ribs. This one looks like it's falling off already. It's spicy. It's spicy, but it's not too spicy. I think it's perfect. Sir, she does the people spicy. Good. Definitely need some rice with that though, not? I'll get that again. There you go. Yeah, very good. 8.5. It was tender, it was good, it had the spice. I think it was the spice. The spices were made at 8.5. So let's try this. The carbonara. I didn't get the carbonara. Oh, you didn't get it? It's got like ham on it. Pork. So let's give it a taste. It's good. But I thought it'd be cheesier. Cheesier? Yeah. What is it, tasting? I don't really taste cheese. I just taste milk. Milk? Yeah, milk. Oh, my God. We got good veggies in. What's up with vegetables, is not it? I just remember this bowl. It's all there. It's not for me. It's all up there. I'm not a fan. I'd look you like that. No, it's got a weird taste. The carrot's good. The other one I'm good. So what is this, not? It's got sticky texture. It's a sticky rice. I don't know what it's called. Is this a dessert or is this a sauce? No, it's not a sauce. Is this a sauce? It's going to be salty? I don't know. Is it salty? It's salty but it's got sweet juice. I don't know if that's a dessert or a... I forgot what it's called, but I know that. I had the big one. Ah. You don't like it. It's good. I just want to get it again. Six out of ten. Let's try the... The curry. You guys see my channel, curry curry is my favorite. So let's see how they have a good curry curry. Unfortunately, they didn't have a lot of meat. It was just... It was just pure fat. But it still looks good. You guys know all of it. What's the taste? What's that? A bone? It's solid. Definitely not the best I had. Mine is still better. Yeah, yours is way better. Way better. I'll get that a six out of ten. So... We'll try the sea steak. Where's the sea steak? I don't know. They're all on the side. This is it? Yeah. You put the veggies on the sea steak or... Oh, it's not with that? Yeah. You just got to get some rice with it. So this is the pork sea steak. Here. Try the pork sea steak. Oh, you got it too? Yeah. It's crunchy. I like it. It's kind of spicy. Yeah, it doesn't feel good in chili. It's good. I just... I'm not really... You're not bad. Yeah, I'm not really bad. We don't really put that there. I don't even like that taste too. It's definitely good. I'll get that a seven out of ten. They just have a different taste of that. I'm just... So definitely... This is the soup right here from my favorite. And then the leech on. The leech on you must get. And this you must get too. So we'll see you guys when we get the second. I'm super... I'm gonna get it. Oh, you did? Go get it. This is the pig's feet, guys. So I'll give it that too. This is a full pig's foot. Very fatty now. You like that? Yeah, I do. Alright, let's see. Okay. Alright. It's like super soft. I think they cook it really good. Pig's foot, it double. Huh? A double? Yeah, it's a double. Mmm. Hey, that's a lot of fat. Yeah, but I like that. You like it? What do you rate it? It's only 8.5. So guys, we are gonna destroy this. And we'll see you for round two. So guys, this is the final result of round one. You see? We're... We're offered round two. Yeah, round two? Deserts. Yeah, round two is gonna be the mixture of the dessert and the best foods we ate so far. And we also got another water. They charge us 25 for extra water. You get two on the house, but if you want extra water, it's 25 pesos. So I did not know, but now we know. So don't drink your water, no? You gotta save your water. Let's just live in here. Yeah. So what do we do to change these? It's a very chill day in here too. And it's a Saturday, so I'm very happy we can get, you know, good quality. So this is where you change your plate. You're gonna give you new plates? What about silverware now? You get new? Okay, so you gotta get more. So let's see, did they add anything new? No. No. Did they add anything new here? Yes. Was it all the same? Yeah, it's all the same. Nothing new? Oh. They got fish. You want to try the fish? We get unlimited fish. What if I want all of that? Well, then you can eat all of it. That would be messed up. You want our dovey? I don't know if I want fish right now, no? I'm so... You can get one. I might just load up on cucumber. I guess so. Here. So this is dessert. Oh, they give you another bowl for dessert. Yeah, for dessert. That's pretty cool. So what is that? This is cool. This is... I don't know. It's like yogurt. I know what it's called. Yeah, no, it's like... Oh, it's called pineapple. This one. This one looks like cinnamon apples. Is this cinnamon? I don't know. I don't remember. It's called lello. Oh. It's not apples. This is banana. Yeah. It's better than apple. You want one? Let's just mix it. Oh, I just mix it. What is this? What's in there? It's just pepper. Can I try? I don't know. It's just pepper. Can I try? It's a little. Is there no mayo in there, right? No. All right. Oh, I don't know. Just try a little. There. Don't want no mayo macaroni. Here. How about this one you want? What's that? That's like... All right, let's do it. Take a whole jelly. We can share. Yeah. Very nice atmosphere, very clean place as well. I must say. They do a good job here. So now let's get into the good stuff. Now, this is what we came for. Oh, you're getting some tuna? Yeah. I'm just going to mix it as well. So guys, this is plate two. We got more dessert. And we got more than 9 out of 10 things. I got the... Talapia. Talapia. So let's do the dessert now since we already tried the others. What is this now? Jelly. Jelly pudding. Look at that. It's good. Blame, blame. Oh, no. We just do that. You're out. You wasted. It's fine. We just still eat it. I don't want this so. I have to eat it. Don't so wait. It's good. It's good. Yeah. Don't so wait. It's good. It's gopher. Yeah. That's my good. I thought it was going to be cold now as well. It's good flavor but it's kind of warm. Let's try this. This one... Ooh, this smells good. This smells really good. This smells really good. Mmm! Mmm, it's a little bit more. It's warm. So, one is cassava. Cassava. What? It's hard to chew. Cassava. Mmm. I should have given it a napkin. This is banana or cassava. Cassava. Cassava. This tastes like banana. Let's try this. It's green. This is sweet banana. Mmm. Yep. This one right here. This definitely gonna be my favorite. So, let's try this macaroni. I don't want to go through it. So, this is the dessert. macaroni salad. I like it. It's not dessert, not it's salt. It's not that it's dessert, but it's like macaroni noodles. It's actually good though. Alright. We gotta get the famous... ...what we came back for. Because if you're just gonna spend the 300, this alone is worth it. Yes, because in Hawaii, the chon pork is so expensive. Quite a lot. Quite a lot. If you just give the chicken and the pork, your money is not wasted. So, guys, Round 2 was finally completed. I still have food, but I cannot finish it. Yeah, we're so full. But... I'm gonna force myself. I don't want to pay 250 for the left home. If you have leftovers, you have to pay a fee. So, that's actually really smart. But yeah, I think I'll have to go for one more plate and force it. Just because... Not really, I can eat all this in one bite. Go try it. Be careful, don't choke. Oh my gosh, no. No. That's a whole pig foot. You got pig foot in your mouth. You like that? Yeah. That's good. It smells in your mouth. Whoa. So fatty. But guys, I'm gonna go for Round 3, and then we're gonna see what else we can find here. All right, guys, as you can see, this is the third plate. Very excited. I don't know why they closed it, but all right. Ooh, nothing new. There's my chicken. There's my chicken. Funny chicken left. So, you know we got to reel up on the chicken and the leachon. And then we're gonna get out of here, because I don't want to overeat, even though I did. So, let's go get some of this. And we'll be back when I load up on this plate. So, we're back with plate number three, guys. And I don't even want to eat no more. I'm only doing it just to give my money's worth. So, guys, we had to go run it back on the barbecue chicken. You know we had to get the pork leachon. I added some carbonara, because it's a pretty decent carbonara. And I just got some white rice. So, I got three plates. And we spent 300 pesos for the whole thing. So, that means three of these plates were 100 pesos. So, that's such a good deal, guys. I got a limited chicken. I got two piece chicken. Oh, you got that one again? Yeah, I got two piece. Two piece, so guys. Do I recommend this place? The food overall. I'm going to rate that at 8.5. It's not going to be the best food. They're going to have some food that you want to avoid. And they're going to have some food that's at 10 out of 10, just like this pork and chicken. But overall, do I recommend this place? 100 percent. For the price, for the unlimited food, you cannot go wrong with it. 300 pesos. All you can eat. I got to give that this place a 9.7 out of 10. The only reason I won't give it a 10 is just because I had three of the same things already. If they had a better variety, I'd give it a 10, but that might just be my fault. So, let's go try this pasta again. It's solid. Can't go wrong with it. And not go wrong with the pasta. Unlimited. Eat all you can. It's crazy. You shouldn't eat all you can because it's not good for you, but if you want to eat, have a good meal. Unlimited. It's amazing. It's so good. And that's for me, I'm already done. Second plate, then I'm done. So, she had two plates, but I think it's still worth enough. Yeah, it does. But I'll just get so full, so easy. Let's do one more bite. So, guys, I'm going to end the video here. Thank you so much for watching. I appreciate all you guys. You're viewing for the Philippines. Stay safe. Type in the seasons coming. So, please make sure you guys be responsible. Stay safe. Did you get it? I'll see you guys tomorrow on day 19. Peace.
