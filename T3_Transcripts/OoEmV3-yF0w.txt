it's kind of like a mango pasta
hi i'm beryl and the theme for today's
video
is mangas the king of the fruits
the video today is sponsored by
hellofresh very excited to have them
back again
the artist today is vicki lita
she is an illustrator from brooklyn new
york i love her designs they're very
magical
i found her on instagram and she does
beautiful line work incorporates a lot
of
fantasy into her illustrations i'm
leaving a link in the description
to where you can follow her and support
her one thing i want to say before i get
started because i know that the comments
are gonna say this
obviously i live in the united states
and i only have access
to certain types of mangoes i don't have
access to
a lot of mangoes grown in india or in
the philippines or in indonesia
so you know be
gentle in the comments about using the
wrong type of mango
mangoes are delicious we all love them
there are literally hundreds of
varieties so
i think i'll be okay okay let's eat some
mangoes
hi i'm ananta and i'm from trinidad and
tobago
the dish i would like to share with you
all today is something we call chow
i would describe chow as a savory fruit
salad and it can be made with a variety
of fruits
such as plums or pineapple but i think
the preferred option throughout our
island
is makuu which is not surprising because
mangoes are delicious
there are a lot of mummy flavors
involved in chamo because it is a mix of
salty sweet
and spicy and i think that is very
typical of trenardian food and that has
a lot to do with a very diverse
background
to make chow you don't have to use any
specific type of mango
but it is very important that you cut
your mango at the right time
if you cut your mango when it is too
green then your chow is going to be too
tough to chew
and too sour and if you cut it when it
is too
ripe then it's going to be too salty so
you need to pick a mango that's just a
few days before it turns ripe just when
it's starting to get tender to the touch
the other ingredients are garlic hot
peppers
we use scotch bonnet or habanero peppers
and also the fresh herb called pandania
or shadow belly i believe
internationally it is called cilantro
and then you mix that up with your mango
and on top of all that you sprinkle some
salt and
black pepper mix it all up and that's
basically ciao
shower is meant to be a very spicy dish
so i make mine
pretty spicy chow is something that most
people enjoy when they're hanging around
with their friends over drinks
just chilling around but i most enjoy
ciao on a sunday morning on the beach
when the sun is out but i have a very
cold
day in my hand i hope this is something
that you all can make i will definitely
enjoy it
it is breakfast so we're going with the
trinidadi
mango chow and um i didn't make it that
spicy because
we all kind of know that i don't have
necessarily
the highest spice tolerance i just need
i just need a quick drink just
just one second oh my god my dog is on
fire
oh god oh my goodness
oh my goodness
oh it's spicy i don't understand it was
just one chili
but i mean this is
absolutely delicious sweet and sour
and spicy please get me on that beach
with you
with a beer and this
perfection let's just get that chili off
that mango
going into this i will say that i think
about mangoes as
a sweet dessert so starting off with
them as a spicy dish
i'm already blown away this is a really
easy
and fun way to shake up a traditional
fruit salad which
i don't know like if you told me that
you were gonna give me a fruit salad
i think i would probably be a bit
disappointed i'm not like a huge fan of
fruit salad i feel like first of all
it's a lot of cantaloupe i mean you know
how i feel about cantaloupe
it's like who cares but also like
there's just not much impact there
this however this is a party
this is 10 out of 10. love it
hi my name is andrea and i live in
quezon city in the philippines the dish
that i want to share with you all today
is called
mangangilao at bagong alabama or green
mangoes
with shrimp base this dish
is as simple as it sounds it's just the
flesh of a green mango
dipped into vago or shrimp base
and that's it for this dish we need to
use
green or unripe mangoes
green mangoes are best to use with this
dish
because they are sour and a little bit
firm and ideally a little bit
crispy so that they can balance the
other main ingredient
of this dish which is
a common condiment here which is used
for
dipping or as an ingredient in some
dishes
it's mostly salty and it definitely has
an
umbami taste filipinos are
known to be a very warm and welcoming
people
we take care of each other and we share
everything that we can
and this dish really reminds me of that
almost every backyard has their own
mango tree
and it's common for neighbors to go door
to door
to share their little macro harvest as a
child
i would hear loud thumps on the roof at
night but it never
scared me it was a sign that the
neighbor's mangoes were ripe
and starting to fall to the ground and
that we would have
field to eat soon here in the
philippines it's
polite to invite others to eat along
with you
so i hope you enjoy this dish let's see
i am
[Music]
okay i have green mango and shrimp paste
from the philippines
i hope that these mangoes are
unripe enough i am not so sure
[Music]
whoa that shrimp base is something else
it is
very shrimpy
i don't know if i love this shrimp paste
to be honest
[Music]
the mango is definitely a little bit
sweet so it doesn't have
what i'm imagining is supposed to be a
super sour
flavor to it i just want to know what's
in this what do we have
shrimp fry garlic onion chili salt
sugar flavor enhancer oil
i think that this shrimp paste for me is
just a great example
of trying something from another culture
where the flavors are so
foreign from what i'm used to that i
don't totally have the trained
taste buds to like appreciate it fully
for me i'm just tasting like
a lot of savory like really heavy savory
the shrimp is super forward for me and
it just
uh i don't know it's just not my cup of
tea
i feel bad saying it but i think that's
okay you don't have to like everything
but as long as you try it i feel like
you know you're golden
we'll try it one more time
it's just not my thing i do have another
filipino dish that is a sweet dessert
because so
many people commented asking for it so i
thought it was good because
this one was savory and this next one is
sweet
hi veril my name is alex and i live in
the philippines
so the main good dish that i want to
share with all of you today
is called mango float well the star of
this dish
is of course mango it's like a tiramisu
i would say
because of its alternating layers of
graham crackers
whipped cream and mango with the
introduction of graham crackers
during the american occupation and a
surplus of mangoes
the dish was born every filipino knows
this dish by heart
because mango is the unofficial fruit of
the philippines
so we take a lot of pride in it mango
float is a must-have for any occasion
birthday parties baby showers weddings
you name it
it is so popular during the christmas
season that it actually drives up the
price of mangoes
due to a very high demand whenever i eat
mango float it always reminds me of home
i remember clearly how my mother and my
sisters
would gather around a table and prepare
a mango float when i was still a kid
times were tough back then so we only
had to use
only a few mangoes but despite that
it's still the best mango float i ever
had
i think the versatility of mango is the
reason why it is
so well loved and popular so in filipino
we don't have an equivalent to bon
appetit
but we usually say kaina or let's eat
kaina
so i have the mango float from the
philippines and i know that i have
two filipino dishes but like the first
one all i did was cut a mango you know i
didn't really feel like that was that
fair
so well anyway it doesn't matter i don't
have to explain myself
[Music]
oh my goodness what it's so delicious
and simple this was like the simplest
dessert i've ever made in my entire life
even though there was what like four
ingredients it tastes
so much more complex than that you have
the flavor of the condensed milk and the
vanilla that went into that and then
kind of a spiced flavor from the graham
cracker
and the sweetness of the mango this is a
crowd pleaser
i it was so easy to make you have to put
it
in the fridge overnight and in that time
the graham cracker becomes
soft and so it doesn't have like a
crunch to it it's all just like a very
soft cake the nice thing about this cake
is that literally
you could make this anywhere in the
world these ingredients are completely
universal
and you could probably use like canned
peaches
or even canned mango any sort of like
soft canned fruit
i've eaten a lot of this i also haven't
had a graham cracker in a really long
time outside of
like a s'more but i also haven't had a
s'more in a long time
and graham crackers are good okay this
dish was amazing
very like definitely try making this
definitely try making this
so the dish i'm gonna make from hello
hellofresh are these plant-based
carnitas tacos and i'm gonna put a mango
slaw on them because
this is a mango episode they actually
have over 50 different menu items to
choose from so there's
definitely a lot of room for
experimentation here you really can cook
dishes
from all around the world i have these
beef meatballs with bugogi sauce so
that's kind of south korean inspired
dish
and these chickpea and spinach fritters
which have an indian vibe going for them
they have tons of other options so you
really can experiment with what you make
at home which is something that i know
that we all want to do
and i said this last time but i think my
favorite thing is that there's less
wasted food
if you need a bit of spice you only need
that much of a spice and you can see if
you like it and then if you do
you can buy a bigger one and incorporate
it into your cooking
and if one week you want to do
vegetarian like this taco dish that i'm
doing
you can choose only vegetarian options
you can even skip a week if you're like
ah i don't want to cook this week i'm
only going out
hello fresh has given over 4 million
meals to charity in 2020 and they're
continuing to help with food donations
and i think that that is so important
to be a part of the communities that you
serve this mango slaw that i'm making is
like kind of caribbean and mexican
inspired i'm gonna leave a recipe in the
description
and tada my vegetarian carnitas tacos
okay i have my plant-based carnitas with
a
mango salsa that i made up on the spot
[Music]
this is my first time having the kind of
like fake meat
wow it tastes like meat that's
surprising
so i have this story about hellofresh so
they sponsored another previous video
and
rajit never cooks for me ever one time i
asked him to boil a potato and like you
would have thought that the house was
going to burn down
it was so dramatic anyway i was working
a lot and he
cooked me the other two meals like on
his own
he cooked for me twice in one week and
in
all the years we've been together he's
maybe cooked for me twice
[Music]
it just made me realize that with
cooking
sometimes it's about empowering people
to feel like they can make the dish
and rugged felt empowered and i
thought that was awesome so i just
wanted to say also like if you're
somebody who struggles with cooking and
feels like you can't do it
like i'm just saying like this worked
for reggie and
so that i don't know i just wanted to
share that because i thought it was
really cool
it's kind of falling out if you're

okay next mango dish
[Music]
hi i'm akhila i'm from
india the dish i wanted to share with
you today
is called maman kai pakku which
translates as
mango dal mango dal is a savory dish
it's a little sword tasting dish with
um any kind of dal that you want just
add
raw mango to it and it has this distinct
salt
that makes it kind of special so for
this recipe the best
mango to be used is a raw mango which
can be a mature
big sized mango but it needs to be raw
and
hard and not soft i think most people
know mangoes
are very local to india
everyone all over india loves
mangoes generally it's used a lot for
desserts
but raw mango is also used in a bunch of
recipes that are savory
[Music]
generally in my family we eat it with
rice so when we eat it we
mix it with rice and ghee and eat it
with our hands
i think yeah i just like this dish
because it reminds me of the summer and
and i love the way that my mom makes it
enjoy the dish
thank you
okay mango doll from india this to me
was super surprising because
i have had many types of indian dal and
i'd never even
heard of mango going into it so i'm
excited
akilah did tell me that if i want to do
this the right way i have to eat it with
my hands
so just like
[Music]
oh my gosh this is so good so different
but also very
familiar at the same time i also love
any excuse to eat with my hands
not gonna lie there's a there's like a
slight
sourness to the doll that obviously is
coming from the mango
winner winner chicken dinner so a lot of
the flavor is actually coming from the
mango skin which is why
you leave it on when you put it in the
pressure cooker
but it's so soft and like you wouldn't
even know that you were eating the mango
skin
i will absolutely make this again i
think this is absolutely delicious
hi my name is jana i was born in el
salvador but
i've grew up most of my life in brussels
belgium
and other parts of the world the
mango-centric dish
i would like to share with you today is
called mango twist
or mango rayado fruit trees are very
common in el salvador and mangoes is one
of the most popular ones and we eat them
uh pretty much throughout the entire
year basically you need
one average size mango the way that we
prepare this
or the street vendor with preparation
would peel long
ribbons of mango and they would shove
everything in a plastic bag
they would tie it up and then you would
just eat long ribbons of
this mango coated in all these toppings
the other ingredients
are a couple teaspoons of lime juice
or lemon juice hot sauce and
also a brown sauce that
i never figured out but according to my
auntie it's
thickened worcestershire sauce and or
soy sauce and the last ingredient is
called aligwaste aguaste is a
powder made out of toasted ground pepita
seed so it's kind of pumpkin
from el salvador mangurayado can be
crunchy
sweet salty spicy
it's very nostalgic for me because i
remember i would eat this religiously
after school every day
it was just so refreshing so that was my
dish
thank you for listening to me and i hope
you discover
something new from a little country in
central america
okay i have the mango diada from el
salvador
which i struggled a little bit because i
couldn't
really find a recipe so this was just
kind of what i intoned from everything
whoa
this is very surprising to me i don't
feel like i eat that much worcestershire
sauce in my daily life when i was kind
of googling recipes i found out that el
salvador has
the highest per capita consumption of
worcestershire sauce
in the world like that's crazy
apparently it is used on pretty much
everything
i even saw on reddit that people put it
on their ice cream
there's like this sour sweet and spicy
and umami combination it's like all the
flavors
into one dish which makes it really
exciting to eat
i like it i definitely obviously did not
have the right tool to
peel the mango i saw the tool online it
looks like this it's pretty cool
i just used my peeler i mean you know we
work with what we have i wasn't gonna
like buy the machine
just for this but
eating mango like this is kind of fun
it's exciting that i've learned about
mango
as a savory dish i've literally only
ever thought of it
as a sweet dish so that's pretty cool
[Music]
hi my name is evelyn my family's from
mexico and i live in phoenix arizona in
the united states
and the fish i'd like to share with you
all today is called the mangonyada
mangonyadas are typically served either
in a clear
glass jar or in a small little plastic
cup and they consist of
frozen blended mango layered with chamoy
sauce
which is a sauce made of pickled fruits
and chili leoncho tajin which is a chili
lime seasoning
and the tamarind or tamarindo straw
so the best type of mango to use for
mango nala is a frozen mango
any variety works and the mangonyala as
a whole
tastes very sweet very tart and
can be spicy if you'd like overall the
flavors are very delicious
and those are common flavors found also
in mexican
sweets with how hot it is there it's
always so nice and refreshing and the
first time i had a mangonyada
i shared it with some my cousin so that
was just really special to me
so whenever i have them on mariana i
really think about
just my family something you know we get
on the street if we're going somewhere
special
you know kind of sightseeing in other
parts of mexico that is a common thing
to get
so i would say this brutal
which just means to enjoy it and if you
are making a mango yellow by chance
alcoholic
you can also do little cheers and say
salud
if you want that's what we'd say in
spanish but
by the way i hope that you like the
mango yeah
i am so excited for this one it looks
like it's from like a magazine because
it's so beautiful
my god it's so good
it's got like the sweetness from the
mango and then the tartness
from the chamoy and if you've never had
chamoy
i really recommend you get it because in
drinks
it is so good like it adds so
much amazing flavor and
i went on a journey to find the tamarind
stick covered in chili powder
mexican tamarind candies are some of my
favorite
wow i'm normally not like a smoothie
drinker but this
[Music]
is like 10 000 times better
[Music]
i kind of feel like
[Music]
maybe i need some rum
don't ask me what time it is right now
while i'm filming because it's nobody's
business
if you buy tajin you will use it on
everything you can put it on fruit
and it's delicious on fruit oh well i
guess obviously because this is fruit
but like literally you can just put it
on oranges
i put it on chicken and fish when i'm
cooking it i put on vegetables i mean i
literally actually put it on everything
so
i'm curious if any of these recipes
surprise you or
if i missed one that i really should try
i have a couple mangoes left in my
fridge so leave a comment and let me and
everybody else know
and with that a big thank you to
everybody for submitting videos for this
episode
and of course the hellofresh for
sponsoring it and before i do my casual
see you all next week
can you guess what the next episode is
going to be
because you all have been asking for it
for a while
i will see you in that episode next week
