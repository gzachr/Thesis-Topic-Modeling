 But you're Friday. The freshest. Alright! Hello! What's up people? So this is NUPEP Squad. And they're... PEP. PEP. Yeah, PEP Squad. Do you know what a PEP Squad is? No. Cheerleading. It's cheerleading. But I didn't know they had like international competitions worldwide. I didn't know it was a huge deal. It's like gymnastics, but like... on crack. It is really wild. I always used to want... Like, because I started doing gymnastics when I was younger. I was used to watch the cheerleaders in the games. Like the baseball games, they were always so cool. And I was like, oh, one day, right? Baseball. No one of people know what that is. If you're not from America or South America. Well, yeah. You play baseball like in... In the Philippines. I was thinking so. Nobody plays baseball with lachappas. Go on, here we go. Anyways, but only baseball had cheerleaders. Because football never had cheerleaders. Soccer. Soccer. Or football, as it's actually called. Yeah, like it is... Because American football is huge for cheerleading. It's different, yeah, for cheerleading. But we never played American football. I wonder why there's cheerleaders there in the Philippines. For what sport? And like, where did it all start? Because apparently this is like a really high level. Please let us know in the comments. Let's see if I look clear of music for a... Phoenix. Si. Phoenix C. Whoa. Look, it's huge. This was the completely... Oh, for basketball, maybe. Ah, for basketball. That's where he comes from. Do the basketball teams at back home have cheerleaders? They must do, right? Yeah, but back home, but back home. No. Ah, alright. I love the freaking flames in the booty. That's cool. It's a skirt. Oh, look at them legs. Those are tree trunks for legs. Whoa. Oh, oh, my god. We're about to make this ride yet. Whoa. What? Jesus. Oh my god, how? That's really cool, man. The wrong way around, though. Wait, wait, where are her hands? Oh, on their knees. Not that they're holding them. Oh, then. Oh, her hands are here on their knees. They're standing in stag. So they're holding... Okay, wow, this is madness. Sorry. What? So cool. The loses. Oh, cool. That's really cool, Ariel. Oh, my god. Ever, this is fun, mate. Oh, man. And they're so synchronized as well as mad. Oh. Oh, the people in black are the monitors. Okay, like the specific monitors for your specific team. Urzane. So they call the shots. So they is like count, you know how in dancing you've got count. But because everything is so physical here and you're all supposed to be synchronized in the same movements, you need a specific monitor for each group. So you know exactly in what count to propel the flyer. It... They must get a lot of bruises, don't they? Absolutely, tons. One of them, they obviously came down softly, but still I'd imagine. No, no, no, it's rough. Cheerleading is hard on the body. Not only for the lifters, but for the flyer. Oh, cool, what the fuck? They're the ones... I don't know. No, I'm sorry, the base people, the people that do the lifting, oh goodness, they have a lot of work to do with that. Oh, obviously, but I'm saying that the people that are... And they wait like freaking gym crazy people too, man. I would've guessed. But... The... No, no, my stuff was fine. But the ones that are in the air, I mean like the landing stuff, when they get in quarter stuff, you must get fucking bruised up to the gills. Oh yeah, the first, the first we ran, especially when you're learning something new, when you're being a flyer. I had a little bit of experience with, not with cheerleading, but with acrobatic, some flyer and crazy acrobatic like this, like where they make you fly, because I'm so small, it's easier. But uh, the white... But it's really interesting to see it also synchronized. That, that, that's, it means really wild. My Spanish came out there. But... That's so cool. And then see, you see, the monitors are gone. Whoa. It's insane. I suppose this is... It's a floral bouncy. Oh, right, because they have insane elevation. Oh well, yeah, yeah, yeah. They have insane elevation, but the floral read does help. It's like a springy... A bit, I imagine a bit, yeah. Yeah, it's like a springy mat. How sick! See now, that's the core and part. Yeah. Whoa. Bro, the stamina. This is wild. Yeah, they all do have tree trunks for legs. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You must do though. Even if you're a fly. You're a fly. Nice! That's so cool, man. Dude, this synchronization is insane. Oh, god, coolness. I wonder how the coach came up with this choreo. Because usually the coaches are like the ones that choreograph this stuff. But maybe they had some input in this as well. It's like the visual aesthetics. You mean the dancers, you mean the cheerleaders. They had some input as well. Maybe, that's my guess, I don't know. Maybe it's usually the coaches though that... And the dance captains that choreograph everything for them. I'll see. This is really cool though. What the hell, bro? Hey! What a cool reveal! Hey. Stop handslamps. Look, look. Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up. See, the money turns to such an important job. So they make sure everybody's elevated in the right place. No, no, no, no. And they're so so for safety. WHAA! They literally turned around in a needle. What is that? It's for safety too. Oh, wow! Do this mad. Whoa. Oh. What? He's like this. This is super cool. Yes, yes, yes. Oh, wow! Choo, choo, choo. They literally folded. Oh, that's so cool. Oh, do it but the choreography works. It's the same. See? Alamu. Oh, wow! Oh, wow! Oh, my god, that made it look so much better because they all went down. I love what people work with, freaking levels. Yeah. Bro, one tire and I'm not doing anything. The stamina. Whoa. Ready? Up. Whoa! Oh, no, no, no. Ready? Up. Whoa! Oh, no, no, no. Did you see how she nearly missed it? They went over here. No. Watch. Oh, she nearly missed it, did you see? Whoa. Oh, wow, cool! She happens. That's so sick. That's the name, she got the name. Whoa! No, my heart's about to rot. That girl nearly flew out. This one over here, she freaking dove into the hole. Yeah, what imagine that? That's just something that like shit must happen all the time. I would think so, right? I would think so. Yeah, I mean, you know, one little miscalculation of strength and she goes up too much and then it's a matter of real adjusting. So they're probably some of the most adaptable people you can imagine. How would think so? Need air, like it's insane. But yeah, I don't even pay much attention to the misses because it's like shit's gonna happen. It's not the messes, it's just like it's surprising how quickly they pull everything back together and the next thing is even more impressive than what they were before. I can't imagine like the horror stories that they may have as well, you know, in rehearsals and stuff. But this is going basically life's flawless. Even that, like that's still fucking insane. That is, that is insane. And I'm just like, I guarantee you, if you ask anyone in the crowd as I just see anything, now it's like, anything, anything, anything. Anything looked amazing. Yeah, that's good, that's because it is. This is the visual, wow. Yeah. Woo! Look at the way they buy it. The thing is like you got to carry on, that's the only thing. Oh, of course. There's no way of like... So performance. Yeah. Show goes on. Woo! Got it, that's so cool man. Wow! Oh, I like it. Yes! Oh. Oh my god, it's like synchronized swimming. But on people. Haha! Synchronized swimming is with people. No, but on people, not in the water. Oh, on the air. I think I have on the air. Okay. What do you do with synchronized air swimming? Dude, this is a Zanadido. Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Oh, goodness. Woo! This is like the e-c port. Nothing about that is e-c. Okay, here we go. More crazy stuff. They changed outfits again. They changed outfits again. Oh! Goodness gracious. Oh, sick. Oh my god! What a cannon. You can't think of the crowd go wild. Oh, shit! Look at the guy in the middle. Oh, yeah. Oh, whoa, bro. This is like fireworks. Go with these colors. Oh, my god. And a good amount of days, like you were vibing. They did it. That should make you want to cry, dude. Yeah, absolutely. What? Where did this light come from? Yeah, they're fans. Look at the people who are going wild. Oh, that's cool, though. That's amazing. That is incredible. Yay! I wonder what you call those. Like bomb bombs, or they're not bomb bombs. They're not really bomb bombs. They're like bombs. Oh, they're from an university. Woohoo! Why on earth was that, bro? That was absolutely amazing. There might be some things that are from an university. So it might be from a uni. UAAP, CDC with clear music. I don't know what any of those letters mean. Yeah. Uni, university of... Mugula. Maybe. I'm very intrigued. It's a little dance competition. Because that's awesome. Like... That's like a cool part. And I didn't know, obviously, cheerleading was such a big deal. Like, there. I mean, that stadium... Oh, I think it was like... Like a basketball stadium. I think that's what it was. It was absolutely packed. And everybody was like... Loving it. They're head-so-for-its. There was a moment there, you feel it. Oh, shit. No, especially when there's a human fireworks here, Rob. That was a little... Well, again, let us know what you thought about it. And if you have more information regarding them, or if, like, yeah, if any of the dancers have, like, other work and stuff, maybe other competitions. It's so fun. Obviously, ballet is a bit more well, what you call it, a verse in this matter. I don't know anything about cheerleading and a little bit of acrobatics, but that's it. But I'm not. But this is kind of just pleasant to see. And it seems a lot of you guys enjoy it, too. So I'll enjoy it with you. And then, hopefully, I can bring some knowledge into this. But let us know what you thought about it. And maybe, what else do you check out next? That's right.
