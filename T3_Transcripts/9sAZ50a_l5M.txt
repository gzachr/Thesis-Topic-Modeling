when looking into visiting the Philippines
it's easy to choose all the most popular Islands
to visit while destinations like coron El
Nido and Cebu are all stunning and unique
in their own way there's one more Island nearby
that has some of the most beautiful waterfalls
and scenery in the Philippines and that is
Bohol [Music]
[Music] yesterday we had a super long travel
day to get where we are now we are now in
Bohol in a city called lobach yes we are staying
in a very small village it's very local and
we're only paying like 12 a night for our
place and there are nine roosters that live
across the street so he takes them you lose
some you know but today we are going to start
to show you some of the best things to do
around the lobach area so one of the first
things that you need to do when you get to
Bohol is rent a scooter because it will give
you the freedom to travel all around to some
of the best places on your own terms and we
are paying 400 peso per day for this so I
think we're going to run it for like two days
that should be enough our first stop on our
two-day trip is to pahangog Falls or Twin
Falls which has two separate waterfalls falling
into one beautiful blue pool of water the
road is not good anymore so we're gonna have
to walk a snake just slithered on past us
we're not sure if it's poisonous but it's
in the weeds right now and we're kind of afraid
to walk by it
someone put so much work into this place there's
like little like Bridges and there's like
little ladders everywhere and the whole concrete
path down here insane but this place is beautiful
there's no one here [Music] thank you
[Music] here we go one two three
someone's the best doing things I kind of
scare you oh it's beautiful waterfall is great
but there's one issue and it's so slippery
to get in and out like really scary
I swear Kyle always does the craziest things
at waterfalls he'll go and swim around and
just like test How deep the water is just
so he can jump off of random High surfaces
it's like look at him right now
you could never catch me doing that
he's just a kid of the water [Music] break
in this video we're pretty much going to show
you a ton of amazing beautiful places to go
here in Volvo but honestly one of the best
things is interacting the vocals and buying
fruit on the side of the road I know that
sounds a little weird but seriously the fruit
and the Coconuts and everything on the side
of the road are some of the best you will
ever eat and it's also really nice because
you're supporting locals who are working really
hard to provide for their own families so
support the locals
[Music]
all right we just got to the parking area
of our next waterfall and we are walking down
to the waterfalls now we could not find the
waterfall on Google Maps it took us the wrong
spot and a local showed us here on his bike
he gave him a little money and now we're walking
down the place [Music] so we've made it down
to the second waterfall and again all alone
it is seriously so beautiful here it's super
like Majestic looking it's so cool [Music]
this one's a little bit different from the
last one because there's actually platforms
you can jump off of here so we all know Kyle's
gonna be all over that and it was an entrance
fee of 20 peso per person plus 10 pesos to
Parker Pike up there but this is beautiful
amazing all right I am going to jump into
the waterfall again he is showing me level
one and level one looks pretty high already
so I gotta climb up okay this is really high
here we go a little nervous for this one [Music]
hello Cherry that's local he just took there's
three levels he said he was taking a level
one he actually took me to level two it was
pretty high I was kind of scared but now he's
gonna climb up to level three which you climb
at three and then jump off of that
foreign
[Music]
all right it looks like Maddie is gonna go
and jump off a level one now we'll see if
she does it
[Music]
how was it a little bit it's good though it
was good I'm glad I did it but probably won't
be doing it again oh I smacked my hand hard
on the water I think it's a lot of fun so
I'm gonna do it a couple more times it's Sunday
today so some little local kids are coming
now and they're like no problem jumping off
oh then you look at me and I was like weenie
about it
[Music]
[Music] [Applause] [Music]
[Music] that was so crazy to get up here
cool this is by far
oh you okay
what's up guys
well we are getting ready to leave right now
and the local that was with us told us that
we're actually super lucky today because yesterday
there were 55 tourists here it's crazy we
had it all to ourselves for so long like yeah
it's so amazing right now there's only three
other tourists here and then the local boys
that we were just able to like hang out with
and talk to the locals and yeah this was super
amazing I absolutely 100 recommend that you
come here if you're getting a bowl this was
so amazing I mean just look at the Blue Water
behind us it's crazy also some of the best
like cliff jumping right at a waterfall that
we've experienced so ever yeah it's so amazing
cannot recommend this place enough
thank you
it's a new day and we're getting it's a new
day and we're getting back in our bike to
go and show you some more cool stuff to do
here in bovill [Music] [Applause] [Music]
I've been driving for maybe 20 minutes or
so and we're headed to a tarzar sanctuary
and the Chocolate Hills and when you're driving
from lobach to these areas you go through
something called the man-made Forest we're
not completely sure what it is it's cool like
you have really tall trees that kind of like
canopy over the road but would not say it's
the most like impressive thing ever but you
do drive through it and it's kind of cool
to see so you stop [Music] oh
[Music]
I guess we saw what you have to see here and
we're gonna head out let's go and hang with
some fuzzy Little Friends [Music]
one of the most popular things to do here
in Bohol is to come and see the Chargers I
think it's called the charger and we are at
a Target Sanctuary right now we're about to
go in but a charger is a small primate I guess
it's a mammal and I guess they're really popular
because they have like of all the mammals
they have the biggest eyes compared to the
size of their body so they have super big
eyes they're tiny little bodies and they're
nocturnal so we're gonna go and see them
[Music]
guys it's staring at us this makes you really
want to come and see a charger like look at
this thing [Music] all right we're walking
into the Chargers Sanctuary now and we have
to be really quiet because they're about to
go to bed since they're nocturnal maybe they'll
still be awake that's why we came in the morning
so hopefully they're awake still
[Music] yeah it's so cute
[Music]
there seriously so small oh you've seen the
team so far and I think there's another one
over here there's cute I think this is only
gonna take like 15 minutes but
[Music]
he takes a picture for you
look at us
it's so cool
[Music]
okay so I think both of us have a new favorite
animal because those little guys are sweet
they're so cute and they're so tiny we were
expecting like maybe double the size or more
and we went in there and they're just tiny
like the size of your fist maybe they're so
small and they're so cute you just gotta make
sure if you go there that you like respect
them because they are nocturnal so they are
trying to sleep oh they're so cute but we
are moving on to our next spot now yes so
gotta go foreign
[Music] [Applause]
so we made it to our final destination and
that is the Chocolate Hills complex located
up near Carmen and boho but we just paid uh
it's 100 peso entrance fee a piece and then
they are actually driving us up to the top
of this hill to see the Overlook so we'll
see should be cool yeah good [Music]
bro all right we made it to the top of the
Viewpoint here at Chocolate Hills I think
this easily is going to turn out to be one
of the most touristy things we'll do in all
the Philippines it is really cool but it's
also starting to rain and you can see the
rain actually like coming in so that's no
bueno but it looks really cool and they're
kind of like matcha Hills a little bit right
now because it's been raining a lot so the
hills are a little bit more green than normal
so
oh they have really built this stuff up around
just tourism they have ATVs that you can go
and ride they have a massage Booth back there
they have a souvenir shop so this is just
extremely touristy area but starting to rain
so we kind of need to get on our motorbike
and get out of here I would say the Chocolate
Hills is probably one of the least exciting
things we've done in the Philippines but it
is cool to see they are really weird the little
mountains of of dirt but that is our two full
days here in Buffalo we're sad to be leaving
but we are moving on to some really fun activities
so we hope you enjoyed and we hope this helps
you a little bit on your trip to Bohol see
you next time [Music] thank you
