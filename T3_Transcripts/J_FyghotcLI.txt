So as a Democratic country now I doubt it though Battalion combat team the Philippine expeditionary forces to Korea was the first battalion to arrive on Busan shores on September 1950 the 10th battalion made up of 1303 enlisted men and 64 officers was originally a motorized battalion sent to operate tanks from the US But when none arrived was turned into a heavy weaponry unit instead On the night of April 22 the 10th battalion as part of the US 65th Infantry Regiment of the US Third Infantry Division Was attacked north of Yunchon by a large force of Chinese and North Korean soldiers This would be known in history a great spring offensive right one of the largest Offensive by the 44th division of the Chinese people's volunteer arm and the communist North Korean Korean War in front of the Filipinos were four Chinese divisions numbering about 40,000 Wow, so he had Philippines were outnumbered but Know what it's ridiculous battle. It's you never gonna win You know in this different situation in this An equal situation, but what is gonna be in the end? Let's see Just after midnight the Chinese began their attack with a heavy artillery barrage soon after the Chinese forces advanced But had difficulty as the 10th battalion successfully defended their positions with mortar and artillery Wow, so they had a better weapon Oh, that's great However a massive Chinese assault pushed the Turkish brigade from their position Allowing the Chinese to surround the Filipinos eastern side seeing the incoming danger Lieutenant Colonel Junisha O'Heda immediately organized a unit of battalion Coksen clerks to 45 and defend the East flank This was not of M24 light tanks and artillery's court Lieutenant Colonel O'Heda's makeshift unit was able to hold off the advancing Chinese forces The situation only got worse when the Puerto Rican 65th Infantry Regiment situated on the West flank began to fall back from Chinese attack With the West flank now exposed the Chinese began advancing but were blocked by a platoon of Filipino soldiers situated on a hill overlooking I see you know shooting from the hell that worked well. Wow good strategy Commended by Lieutenant Jose Artyaga this platoon refused to yield held their ground This gave Lieutenant Artyaga's company commander Captain Conrado Yap Enough time to mount a counterattack The counterattack successfully extracted the trapped platoon from the hill and also stopped the Chinese from further advancing But sadly Lieutenant Artyaga and Captain Yap were killed during the fight Oh, I really morning of April 23 To Lieutenant Colonel O'Heda led the second counterattack using M24 tanks This caught Chinese off guard and pushed them away from the hill they were trying to seize The Filipinos fought until midday before it was ordered to withdraw and link up with the rest of the division in the south 15 Filipino soldiers died 26 were wounded and 14 were missing in action while the Chinese and North Koreans lost around 500 seats The 10th battalions in the Imperial Thong allowed the US Third Infantry Division to successfully withdraw from the battlefield Which would later on prove to turn the war in favor of the Allies Two weeks later the communists began ceasefire negotiations after suffering more heavy losses For the next two years the Korean War was mostly battled from hilltops until a ceasefire was finally declared Out of 7,420 Filipino soldiers sent 113 were killed 313 wounded 15 missing 41 held as prisoners of war Today Amoniumant stands inside the war memorial of Korea In honor of the many Filipino soldiers who fought for deliberation of the Korean Recently during the 69th anniversary of the Korean War The late Captain Conradoyap was awarded the Thai Guqmedal The highest military decoration given to a soldier for bravery in combat Reals awarded the Thai Guqmedal was fellow The Filipino soldier who was a pre-olded in the empire Major Maximum Yom for his heroism at the Battle of Niu Dong The efforts of the 10th battalion in the Battle of Yulthong was instrumental in turning the tide of the war in favor of the Allied forces South Korea remains a free democracy Thanks to the contribution of soldiers like the Filipino A name given by the US command to the brave men of the 10th battalion Comments Koreans, do you guys know about this history?
