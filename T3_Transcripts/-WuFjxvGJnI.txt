 Alright guys, the food is finally done. We got the tuna sandwich. We got the pasta at Canton. So let's say a quick prayer. And then we're gonna try out this delicious food. Our father who are in heaven, how beer name your kingdom come. We will be done on our cities in heaven. Give us a day or a day of food. Our daily food then forgive us our sins. As we forgive those sins against us. Do not bring us the temptation to deliver us. Lord bless this food that we're about to eat. We thank you so much for this another day to keep us going with this journey. Please look after us and bless our animals too. That continue giving us blessings so we can...
