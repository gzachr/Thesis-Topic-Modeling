 Good morning guys from Manila in the Philippines. Today is my first day, my first time ever in the Philippines and I'm so excited to explore. Obviously I arrived like 12 hours ago so it's very very fresh for me right now but very very first impressions. I think I'm going to love this place. The locals seem so friendly. Hello! How are you? Yeah, fine. Good morning. How are you doing? Good afternoon. Good afternoon. How are you? Good afternoon. What's the flag of it? Travel. Travel. What country are you? UK. UK? Yeah. Philippines.

Very nice. Nice. Yeah. Okay. Twenty monkeys here. Yeah? Monkey people. Monkey. No, I love you. Yeah. Yeah. We are here. We are here. Okay, brother. Yeah. Uh, security. Yeah. Yeah, but not with guns.

You've been here. Don't mess with this guy. Yeah. I'm Joker. Yeah. Patizio, one of the crocodile. It's a crocodile. Yeah. Me, please. That crocodile. What am I? I'm a penguin. Yeah, that's me. He's a handsome penguin. Oh, thank you, brother. It's a guy. Look at me. Fish, no fish. All right, brother. Yeah, nice to meet you, brother. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, brother. Thank you, brother. You're welcome. Of course. That's why I mean, guys. Friendliest people. We actually walked down this road earlier. And all the security guards, even like, they're all in the same place. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And all the security guards, even like, behind the bus, they're like, hello, good morning, good morning. So yeah, really nice, like, really nice impression when, like, people out of their way to be kind to you. And, uh, can't wait to explore this place. Manila is the second largest city in the Philippines with a population of like 1.7 million people. So it's a huge, huge area. And it's like, got a lot of history. And it's got a lot of modern areas. So I'm going to explore all the different types of areas. And in this video, we are going to be exploring BGC, I think I say it's a set. BGC, which is a very modern area. And then I'm going to go to a slightly different area and maybe get some food and show you guys different types of Manila because it varies massively from place to place. Yeah, we're going to get into the video. And also, if you didn't see, we are joined by Mr. Ali and Mr. Dany. So yeah, let's get on with the video. So just as we're walking down here in BGC, you can already see how beautiful and vibrant this place is. It kind of feels like we're in Miami, USA. Like, they've got a lot of American influence here. We've got like a block system. We've got like traffic lights. Very much like the US. We've got some sidewalk here. Gonna do some J-walking. And yeah, look at these skyscrapers, guys. We've got beautiful trees. This is incredible. I did not expect this. Honestly, I did not expect this. When I came to, we booked our flights like probably 24 hours ago. And I had no idea what to expect. I didn't really know anything about this country. And for this to be my first impression, it's a very, very good impression. It's so cool. And of course, we have to made it to the famous 7-11. I didn't actually know, I've tried to push into the other pool, but I didn't actually know that they had 7-11 here. I know obviously Thailand is famous for it, but it's cool that they have a 7-11. And I'm actually gonna get the same as Danny. We've got these pizza pals. Oh, it's just called Pow. But then they've got beef. I think cheese, tuna, chicken. I've never had one of these, but I'm guessing they must be popular here, so we'll go for it. It looks like a pudding. What the hell? So we're gonna go for the chicken. Let's go for it. Wow, look at that. So soft. Oh, god. Okay. Oh, there we go. Danny, you got the same? Yeah, pretty much. Yeah. I'm going off Danny's recommendation here, so if it's bad, then I'm gonna judge him. But I'm sure it will be good. Wow. Looks like a pillow. I just wanna sleep on it. 46? Okay. Thank you very much. All right, guys. Here we go. Look at this. Magnificent food. We'll have a look inside to see what's inside exactly. Whoa, okay. So there's a big, a lot of pastry. And then we got some kind of, it's chicken, right? Oh, thanks, sir. Chicken. And then some like red sauce. We'll find out exactly what this sauce is, but it looks. It looks very interesting. It looks quite filling as well. Like, it looks like it could fill me up. It's like a huge bun. Oh, my god. It's kind of like, tastes like similar to a pizza almost. Like, but the dough is so, so soft. Wow. Let's take a big bite because I didn't actually get much of this sauce here. Whoa. Oh, my god, that is so nice. So in Thailand, I've been having the cheese and ham toasties. But I think this is gonna compete with it easily. Maybe even be better, because it's like very filling. Mmm. That's so, so nice. Wow. I was not expecting it, because from now on, it kind of just looks like a snack. Like, just dough. But that inside is so good. So gooey. Kind of like a tomato-y sauce. Oh, my god. Every bite gets better. As you get near the middle. There's so much flavour. So juicy. Oh, my god. There we go, guys. Finished that in probably about two minutes. But if that is how the Filipino food is gonna be like, then I'm gonna love this place, because that was absolute delicious. I could probably have had another one to be there, so it wasn't really filling. But that was absolutely delicious. I loved it, man. So nice and soft. I have to be honest though, the chicken content is very, very disappointing. There's like one slid off chicken. Yeah. So to call it a chicken pizza pow, I think is a little bit of a mis-marketing. Mis-marketing from 7-11. Marketing, yeah. Oh, there you go. Got a whack on that 7-11? Come on, guys. Marketing team. Come on. So for that bun, it costs around 40 pesos, that's like under a dollar for a meal. I mean, I wouldn't say it's a meal, just enough to fill me up for the next few hours. But yeah, such a good snack for under one dollar. All right. And now we're back into the heat. It's pretty hot here, like 30 degrees humid. So we'll get used to it. Look at this, guys. I did not expect this. We got a huge, looks like a town hall. So it's the Uptown Palazzo. Not sure if it's, oh, there's like a apartment suite, I think. And we got like huge sidewalks with like really modern cafes and stuff. I'm not sure if it's a specific area, but wow, this is really, really beautiful and modern. And you can kind of see there's a lot of American, I've already said this, but there's a lot of American and Spanish influence here, obviously. The Spanish colonized, the Americans also, they didn't colonize, but they were here. They did have authority over the Philippines for a while. So it's nice to be in a country that wasn't colonized by the English ones. Although I know the English did have a little bit of influence here, but not like the Spanish and the Americans did. So we just walked up the road a little bit. We've got like lots of little food stands, nice little garden, huge high-rise apartment buildings. A lot of like American chains. Some American chains that I don't even get, we don't even get in the UK. It's really cool. I can imagine at night this is like really ambient lighting and stuff. I want to live here. I wonder how much it is for an apartment here, probably not a lot. You guys let me know how much is a apartment here for the month in like B-E-G-C. Ali, I've got a surprise for you. Oh yeah? I booked you in to get a tattoo, and you're going to get like and subscribe on your back. Did you have your jug up? They do it right here. You're down? Always. Second one, why not? That's crazy. You can get a piercing in the middle of the city on the street. Like as we walk to the next street, it just gets even better. Like I'm not even exaggerating one a little bit. This is nicer. Oh we got across. This is nicer than I don't think there's anywhere nicer in the UK than it's like. So clean, so modern. This obviously, this must be new. So here's the mall. This is so beautiful. And now we are looking for a mode of transport to the next area. We're looking, they're called Jeepneys. They're like very unique buses that kind of just pick you up and drop you off in a location that you want to go to. But they're really cool. But because we're in the modern area, there's not many around, but we're on the hunt for one. Can they keep me? They can keep me. Oh, they can keep me. Okay. Okay, all right. Thank you, Rilla. There we go. That just shows if you ask a local, then you'll probably find out the answer. There we go guys. That's what I was talking about. That's what we want. Look how cool that is. Oh my god, it's got the Mercedes badge on the side as well. I was going to say that's one as well, but. Let me hitch a ride. Hello. Oh, he's jumping on. Let's just jump on. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Oh, good job. Yeah, they got it. Lets get in here. Stop. No! Oh, that's full, I think. He stopped. Oh, he's going. Is he stopped? Yeah, they've stopped. No! Ah, nightmare. We don't know if there's a specific stop or we just jump on. So we're just waiting around. They're teasing us. Excuse me. Are you waiting for the... Oh, you just jump on? You just jump on? Okay, perfect. Where did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go? Where did you go? Okay, we'll just hop on. Please! We need a lift. Let's go! Hello! Hello! Come over to the car! This is going to find out, sir. How is everyone? Good? We're on. How much do we pay? 10 pesos? Oh my god, that's so good price. That's like maybe 20 cents. So we don't exactly know where we're going, but hopefully we'll end up near the Mall of Asia. I think we're heading that way. It's funny, these buses remind me of they have a very similar thing in Colombia. Where you just hop on and then when you get off, you just jump off. It's so cool. I've never experienced anything like this back in the UK. Oh, are we getting off? No, no, someone else. There you go, you just jump off when you're ready. That's pretty comfy actually. You've also got soft feeling. Very nice, pleasurable experience, isn't it? I would have got a special pleasure. I'll say this is first class. No, this is nice. You've got a nice breeze as well. Yeah, yeah. Alright guys, we're at the last stop, so I guess we've got to get off here. Where are we? Okay, that is nice. Whoa, where is this place? This is where are we? Guadalupe. Okay, we're in Guadalupe guys. Okay, thank you so much. Nice to meet you. Wow, look at this guys. We've got some food stores. We've got a very local area. We've got always power lines and these really unique taxis. It's like a Wallace and Gromit. Oh my god, we're gonna get one of them later. Oh, what is this? Banana Cube. What's the name in Philippine? Banana. Banana? Oh, so fried banana. That looks delicious. You just bought, wow, you bought loads. It must be good then. You must try it. I will, I will, I will. Look at this guys, it's just like a hole in the wall. And we've noticed it's like on this, just on this street. There's lots of like private sellers, like street food sellers. You buying banana cube? Oh. Yeah? Okay, everyone's buying it. Everyone's buying it, so it must be good. Thank you all for the food. Thank you all for the food. How much? How much for one? One? Twenty, twenty for one. Okay, just one please. I grab like this. Okay, whoa. So heavy. So it's just got banana and then it's fried. And I think we got some brown sugar on there. Ooh, baby. Look at this. More than one? Yeah. Is this going to be on your only fan's by chance? Yeah. It's wrapped in Harry's only pants. Oh my god. I've never had banana that sweet. That is so good. They've delicious. That's really good. I hate to eat sugar though, so it's like instant sugar here. I'm going to be crashing after all this sugar. Look at that. Is this going to be like dripping off? All that sugar. What's not to like? Banana. Not complaining. Sugar. Good. What about it? Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. And banana is one of my favorite fruits. So to have it as a sweet, can't complain guys. Can't complain. I think you could say bananas healthy, so I could say. Yeah. This is a healthy little snack. You're going to get so much energy you could probably run around the town after this. Now we can run with that pain. Oh my god. I'm going to finish all this, it's very filling. I've got an idea of how you can finish it. Wow. It's so good. I'll take this one. Alright. That is good. Wow. Mmm. Lovely. That sugar really makes it. Mmm. Nice and sweet. Also. The bananas here are so small. They're used to having bananas as small. Yeah, yeah, yeah. These are very different to the British ones, right? Mmm. Nice and small, but they are, I guess, even more sweet. Alright guys. Nobody finished. Got a little bit more. I'm going to take it to go. How much? 20? Okay. Oh, there we go. These are the bananas. Can I have a look? Can I film? Okay. So she gets the bananas. Wow. So many. And then, uh, peel some. And there we go. How do you fry them? Are you fry them in here? Ah. Very nice. Very nice. You buy these. Market? Market? Okay. Thank you very much. Okay. For you. No change. No change. Thank you. Have a good day. So I got a bad news, bro. Oh. You know you want to take it away. It's been taken away from you. Bro, buy your own. Ah. Joking, bro. Carrying your sharing. Sharing. Carrying your sharing. Sharing is caring. Right. On to the next spot. Kuyya. Kamusthaka. What? Good. Where are you from? Manila. Yeah. What a lovely. Is it a good place? Yeah. Okay. What's your name? Tony. Harry. Nice to meet you. Oh, okay. It's my first day in Philippines. Good place. Okay. Bye. Okay, bye. Just a short conversation. You just said hello to me. So I thought I'd say hi. Hi, Kuyya. Hi, Kuyya. Kuyya. Kamusthaka. Kamusthaka. This is the thing I love about being able to film my experiences. When I go home and tell my friends and stuff, like, oh, the locals are so friendly. You know, people, they just have to take a word for it, whereas you guys get to see how friendly the locals are. Well, most of them, mostly. 90%. I have to say, sometimes these more local areas are actually more fun than the modern areas, because you get the really vibrant people, the people that love to be on camera, and that's why I love about these places in Asia. Some people would find this area intense, but I'm starting to really become normal for me. It's really starting to become normal for me, and I love it. But yeah, we're the panoramic stand, vanilla, for a few days, and then we're going to head out to the islands, obviously, there's 7,000 islands in the Philippines. So I'm just going to explore. I can't wait to show you guys. I'm going to be having daily videos coming out, all the way through the Philippines. So if you guys are on camera watching them, just check in every day. Same time every day. I think it's around 6 p.m. Philippines time. Yeah. I'm going to finish the video there. Thank you so much for watching, and I'll see you guys in tomorrow's video.
