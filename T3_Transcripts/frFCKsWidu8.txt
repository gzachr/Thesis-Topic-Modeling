apple cedar vinegar
oh today i'm going to make
tupa using a few crazy
ingredients in front of me unfortunately
filipino drink tuba
is impossible drink in korea
because it turns into vinegar very fast
just
in a few days so i gave up finding tuba
in korea
and of course as you know it's very
difficult to visit
foreign countries nowadays so i decided
make duba by myself before i make duba
let's talk about process how duba is
made
duba is collected sap from coconut tree
and if it's fermented more it becomes
vinegar and to enjoy the stronger taste
of alcohol
people distill the tuba sometimes 40
and sometimes 80 percent abv
and it's called lambanuk good thing is
i could bring lambanok from the
philippines because this is a product
buttered so my idea is just like
tuba became lambano what if i
do some reverse distillation process so
i imagine if i put something
interesting ingredient this magic
ingredient
i think i'll be able to reverse to
do i know it's chemically impossible
but but i want to try it just for fun
so i prepared a few ingredients i'll
tell you
why i prepared that first this is lumbar
of course i need lamb this one is called
makgeolli korean rice wine
very interesting about makgeolli is
it's very similar to dupa first
it's very sour and it just lasts about
a few days after that it's expired that
means very short
life and this also becomes
vinegar and this time i will use some
transparent parts only
to avoid some rice taste on the bottom
and
fanta this is just for some sweet taste
and
the color um i think dupa has two kinds
of
colors white one and some
the red one the red color is from
mangrove tree skin something
and i want to simulate the color using
fanta
and this is coconut i think this one is
very important ingredient
tuba is made of coconut something and
this is the only
ingredient i can find in korea
about coconut thing yeah 15 ziggers
so along i called
about five abv and 40 abv
3 3 4 5 jiggers
1 2
3.
three four one two three
four coconut how can i open it
i don't know
one two three
four five
four shake shake
all right
if the
very beautiful color wow
okay before i taste uh let me confess
something
i haven't tried dubai yet so i don't
know
what the real tuba tastes like my first
two bar is uh fake tuba as you see this
is a kind of
cocktail actually so i would name this
yeah
every cocktail has its name on the tuba
there's no bulb actually someone
recommended that name
cheers
um not sour at all
i put three jiggers of this lambanu
so if i drink all maybe i'm quite drunk
um the color of sun yeah
i think it's better to put some vinegar
actually for
some sour taste
i'm back i don't think makgeolli goes
well with lampano so
i'll use vinegar apple
cedar vinegar but this time i will make
just
going to land just a small amount of
cocktail
if i do one one one one it becomes about
ten percent
half one half one okay let's try
this is half half
one
to avoid explosion i would put this for
the last time
half one half one one
and shake first
just half
and shake this very gently
even i haven't tried to but yet
i have watched it um some foreigners
reaction about dubai
i think this is like duba
my reaction is i think migration is the
same
i think i made it okay one shot
oh
ah oh
this is tuba finally i made it can you
please try
my two bar recipe and tell me if it
really tastes like two bar not the first
one i mean second one
this one this one this one and this one
not makgeolli bacon
is not a good idea now this is trigger
30 milliliter
half one half one [ __ ]
the day when i can visit the philippines

duba on the street
