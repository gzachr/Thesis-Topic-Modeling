 But you're Friday. Diffreshes. This was actually meant to be in the Filipino TikToks compilation. But this is on Facebook. So, welcome to Filipino Facebook, which is... Honorary Mentions. Which is mental. This place is a different place. It's a different planet. It's not Facebook. It's a very different Facebook. They're gonna cover Iqao Ayakor, which is that Clarisse, the Guzman and Mori Set song, right? Which is incredibly hard, by the way. HUBMEHUBMEHUBMEHUBMEHUBMEHUBMEHUBMEHUBMEHUBMEHUBMEHUBMEHUBMEH<|hr|> Ah! Yes! Yes! Are they at a club? I don't know anymore. Are they chilling at a club? It wouldn't surprise me if they actually are. Like the reception of every club over there it just has like a karaoke machine. Say, well, it's your weight. Can I just say the freaking alto? Gladys' spot here is... It's killing. It's so well placed up. You know that with the word delicacy. They really are treating the singing phrases with a lot of care and delicacy. Which showcases skill and technique. Dexterity, technical approach and ability. Come on, girls! You got my attention, champs. Wow! Wow! Yeah, she's eating that part up. Oh! You're so cute. You're so cute. You're so cute. Yeah, she's eating that part up. I'm so cute. I'm so cute. She's eating that part up. Nice. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Damn. Dude, I rate this chick so highly. Yeah, she's taking it the same. The girl in the black vestib also eating that. She's eating. Yeah, she's eating that's hard to do. Damn. Damn. Okay, what in the freaking world is happening here? Oh my god, the buildup, the layers, the absolute mastery. Okay, this song is not new. Yes, I know. Everybody sings it whenever you want to pull out and do it. That is freaking blowing minds away. You pull the song out. Everybody knows that, right? Yes, yes. What do you want the hardest to do what you can do? Definitely. It's incredibly difficult. But people always do the climax of the song towards the end. Right? This part where you can build your little heart out and you're kind of like a satisfying, it feels liberating because it's great. It's such a... What? Empowering part of the song. But then lead up here, people. Then lead up to this moment of climax. That really was what made that climax be so incredibly sad. It's what, it's wild to have this type of skill, bro. It is. It's unfair. That's crazy. And they're like chilling at a club. Mentally. What? That's so grand as doing parts. Yeah, she's freaking eating that so grand. Yeah, damn. She squeezed that out. Nice, nice, well saved, nice. Honestly, the harmonies were absolutely phenomenal. And you know what? Is that... I was with the... Stop it right now. Oh, Jesus Christ. What the fuck? I thought it was the end of the world, was it me? Is that the alarm of the end of the world? What is happening? I was gonna say ironically enough as well. They're sitting in very uncomfortable-esque positions. They have very little ground in Baleo's talks about this, especially when you're wearing heels and stuff like that. It actually does cause a shift. So they have things against them, aside from the Shady Video Key machine. And the bizarre reverb that all these machines always have. Sometimes they're magic. Yeah, in this particular case, they have so many things against them. You've seen them handicapped. In complete critical perspective. Is that ending part where the soprano, the girl in the black vest, is doing literally squeezing the notes out of herself? Oh, wow, Jessica Villarroin commented on the thing saying like happy million views. Her name is Nash and Paul. What? Nash and Paul. That's not a Paul. That's not a Paul, that's another girl. Jessica, I think it was her name. Nash. Oh, they're famous, they're popular. Oh, they've been to the voice. Very cool. Season 4. Very nice. Very nice. Excited to follow that. Oh, she's like a contestant thing. Oh, that's go up, go up, go up. That's what they were wearing. So I wonder what event was that? I think it was a miss thing. Miss Universe thing. It is, it is. It's a Miss Universe. It's a pageant. Oh, that's not. What do you call it when people pageant? Pageant ears? Pageant contestant. That's very good. No, I think it must be another word. I don't know, but she seems to be doing well. They seem to be singing a lot as well. I think that is Paul and that is Nash. Okay, so the alto part was like, or the metzo part was Nash. The other girl Jessica was absolutely squeezing a live out for that. For that soprano. Woo! And like I was going to say, back to the point. If the soprano was sitting in a more comfortable position where she could actually anchor backwards instead of anchor forward and literally pushing her abdominal wall into her spine, she would have actually murdered that without any effort whatsoever. I love the fact that even with all the adversities, this girl's absolutely murdered a monster of a song. The song is a beast. Okay, the song is so hard to do right. Yeah, so this is the soprano speech. Oh, go Nash. Yeah, and then the alto. I love that you're scrubbing through. I don't know, it is weird to do. It's a public page, right? No, I'm sure he's that. You know, she's only following two people and it's like a public thing. She's got 69,000 followers. What a number to have. Sixteen. Sixteen. The best number to have. And she has 14 million views in another one that she did so low of Ica. Ica. Oh, is that the girl that was singing at the wedding that we check? Yeah! It's her! What the fuck? It's her! The guy in the backer is like, to his taxes. Yeah, counting money and shit. Holy shit, what a fool! Circle money! Circle money here! Oh, so we've reviewed you before. Well, you rock, who in games we didn't know. That's awesome, and I appreciate you just commented as well. Gain, she rocks, this is sick! Wow, well, fucking no, wait, too. Right! Wait, because the video, goodbye.
