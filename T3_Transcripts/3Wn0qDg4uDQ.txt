 Look at this chicken, it's huge! The staff so friendly, so jolly, like that's what it is, right? It's jollybees. Now the right way to do this is of course you have to mix everything up over here. I've never had pineapple with my burger, that's crazy. It's got that brownish milky color. Yeah, thank you. Thank you so much, salam ala poe. Good afternoon from beautiful Mendele. Today I'm going to be trying the most famous fast food chain in all the Philippines, jollybees. As you can see it's already packed with a ton of people. Ready to start their day, ready to eat.

No meal, just a sandwich, thank you. You know what? Can I do one small fries? Yes, I do. No, do you know? Can I do a small perfect? Okay, guys, so look what we got over here. I don't even know what we got. I just ordered whatever I could. And it came out to 424 pesos. Thank you. Amazing, thank you so much, thank you. Perfect, thank you. Everybody's so nice here as well. Like the staff so friendly, so jolly. Like that's what it is, right? It's jolly fees. So people are supposed to be jolly. Oh, so this thing is buzzing here, which means our order is ready. So, I believe I pick up here. Maybe, I'm not too sure. They have maybe like 20 staff working, that's crazy. This place is so packed. Boomin, look, everybody's working so hard. Hello, how are you? I'm fine sir. Very good, very good. You guys are working so hard. Thank you so much. Amazing, amazing. What's your name sir? My name is PK, and yours? Uh, then then sir. Then then, very nice to meet you. Is this where I pick up my order? Yes sir, what's that spray paint? And, it sounds like, uh, deeper. Deeper. Yes. Okay, this is where I pick up my order. Okay, thank you. I'm not too sure which one is my order, but, I guess we're just gonna wait. Thank you so much, thank you. Thank you sir, I want to thank you. Thank you, have a great day. Thank you. All right guys, now I gotta be safe with it. You see, all this meal. Thank you very much. Thank you sir. Salamat poh. Okay guys, so here we go. We have the spaghetti right here. We have the rice. We have the jali chicken. Little bit of gravy. Pineapple juice. A float. A Coke float. Some sort of burger, not sure what it is, but hey, it's a mystery. Of course, we have to try the jali fries. And the chicken burger. Well, I'm excited for this. I am so excited for this. All right guys, I don't even know where to start. We have so much, but you know what? Let's just dig in. I kind of want to start off with the spaghetti first. I've never had any sort of spaghetti experience anywhere in a fast food chain. So this is gonna be interesting. Philippine Serves Spaghetti. Very cool. Very cool. And they gave us a nice clean fork and spoon for us to dig in. Now, the right way to do this is, of course, you have to mix everything up over here. You see the sauce? Oh my god. So I smell spaghetti. I smell sausage and a little bit of cheese if I'm not mistaken. So how do you do spaghetti the right way? Roll it up, baby. You roll it up. I have my sausage in here. That sounded so wrong, but you know what I mean. Oh, really good. Really good. I wasn't expecting this, but the spaghetti is actually pretty sweet. I think it's interesting. Sweet sauce spaghetti. A little sweet sauce. A little bit of... No, I don't taste the cheese at all, but the sausage is cook nice. Mm-hmm. I like it. I like it. Some of my friends told me they're not a big fan of the spaghetti, but I don't see anything wrong with it. It's really good. What I say I like the most about it is the amount of sauce that they put. Mix this perfectly with the amount of spaghetti. So you have a right balance of one to one. You know what I mean? It's not too saucy and it's not too dry. Next, I kind of want to try this little pineapple juice or mango juice. Whichever one it was. Oh yeah. Guys, this is pineapple juice and it tastes so good. I'm not too sure if it's an organic one, but hey, I'm not complaining, you know. It's not too sweet. We like it. Anytime something's not too sweet, it's good. Good. I could see myself having this maybe every day. Maybe every day. What I'm curious to try is... It's fat, fat. Chicken burger. Look at this. It's a bun. A little bit of maybe southwest sauce, not really sure what kind of sauce. But a massive, massive piece of chicken. Look at this chicken. It's huge, full of mullet. They blessed your boy. But no vegetables, no onions, no lettuce, no sort of cheese. It's just buns, sauce and chicken. Let's take the first bite. Look at that. It's like white meat. Oh, you know what I also realized? This is spicy. Very, very spicy. As I'm taking it down more and more, it's just becoming more and more spicy. Oh yeah. It's just getting... It's just getting hotter and hotter and hotter right in my mouth. My tongue is feeling all those flavors. But I'm not gonna lie. It's some delicious flavors. This is probably better than Popeye's chicken. Better than KFC chicken. I always get KFC sandwiches, Popeye sandwiches. At those places, but this one. Jolly Vs. Much better. I think I want to rate the chicken sandwich maybe 8.5 out of 10. The spaghetti, 7.5. The pineapple juice, 10 out of 10. And what's great about pineapple juice is that it takes away all of the spiciness from your mouth. You know what I mean? Okay, the next thing I want to try is the fries. I'm huge on fries. I think the best fries in the world are from McDonald's. But over here, we're trying Jolly Vs. fries for the very first time. Very similar to McDonald's. But it has the crispiness of KFC fries. I would say good. I like it. I like these little fries. 8 out of 10 for the fries and Jolly Vs. Okay, next up. Next up. Let's see. We have the champ goodness. Oh, look at this. The champ goodness. Here we have the bun. Look at that. Little yellow sauce. We have bacon, which I don't really eat bacon myself. So I'm just going to pick that right out. After that, we have the lettuce. We have pineapple. Little bit of cheese action. And the slight patty. I'm curious to see what the sauce tastes like out of everything. Hmm, think of this as kind of like the cheeseburger of McDonald's. Except they give you much more. They add on the lettuce. And the sauce. There's not enough sauce for me to know what it is, to be honest with you. But look, tiny little sandwich. Not too tiny. Decent sides. And you know what? This time I didn't get a taste of the pineapple. But now I'm going to take a bigger bite for the pineapple. I've never had pineapple with my burger. That's crazy. What a insane combination. Really good. You get that meaty flavor with a little sweet pineapple taste along with the vegetables. I like this one. The champ goodness burger. Not out of ten. Up next, we have our delicious little flow. If you know me, you know. Your boy loves a good flow, okay? And there's only one way to eat a full properly. You got the little vanilla ice cream this time. Vanilla ice cream. Let me put this in here. Here we go. We have vanilla ice cream right here. This isn't Coca-Cola. Usually they do Coca-Cola with floats, but I believe this is actually root beer. Interesting. Interesting combination. Everything's already mixed inside. If you can see. Look. It's got that brownish milky color because everything already melted. Really good mix. I'm so used to having Coca-Cola with my floats. And you know what? Roop beer. I don't regret it. Let's see. Now this one is one of their most famous meals. I believe this is the jolly chicken with rice. And of course, we have a gravy action. Look at that. We got to put this right here. Believe it's a little dippy dip. Little dip with our chicken. Have a little pink meat. Look at that. Listen. Listen. I'm not sure how I feel about it. It's for me. Personally, it's a little too wet. Usually I like my chicken a lot more dry, but you know what? Oh, look at this rice, guys. Look at this rice. This is hot. This one is actually steaming. I wasn't expecting this. I was expecting the rice to be cold to be honest with you. The rice is hot. The rice is cooked very good, but for me, the jolly chicken, I'm going to rate this a five out of ten unfortunately. But a burger? Very good. This spaghetti? Very good. The chicken burger. The spicy chicken burger. Amazing. Probably my favorite one. The spicy chicken burger. Cooked perfectly, seasoned properly. Very spicy, even though it's a bit too spicy, but I like it. It's a nice, risky adventure. Yeah. Thank you so much. Salam alaikum. It was delicious. Everything was so good. Everybody was so kind. Thank you for everything. I appreciate it. I appreciate it. Have a wonderful day. Thank you sir. In-gat. In-gat. Thank you. In-gat. In-gat. Take care. Very good. Thank you so much. Have a great day. Take care. And it's so kind. Honestly, like this Filipino hospitality. We're all done. Our food. We're all packed up over here. And let's hit the road, guys. Next adventure.
