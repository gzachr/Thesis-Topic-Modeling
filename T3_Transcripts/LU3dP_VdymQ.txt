It's dangerous? Yeah! Hopefully, there will be 
a lot of fish but, the sun is out and hasn't  
been raining today yet. We made it! The water, 
I've never seen it so clear before. You should  
all definitely visit the Philippines! Yes champs! 
Today is the day! We're gonna go island hopping.  
We are in El Nido. At Corong Corong Beach. 
And it's a stunning day. We couldn't get  
a better day than this. We had overcast, rainy 
days. Luck is on our side champs. I hope you're  
excited, let's go! We're booking this tour through 
Beachfront Travel Tours and we have four choices.  
Pretty much everywhere here in El Nido they offer 
these packages; A B, C, or D. They make it easy  
for you to choose from. We chose for C but, 
we only could do this if the weather is good.  
Typhoon season started already a little while 
ago. And we were really lucky with this weather.  
Really, very lucky with this weather. So we 
can do this. Tour C. We're gonna go to five  
different spots. We gonna show you the beauty of 
Palawan. The beauty of the islands around Palawan.  
We're actually walking to the boat. Our guide 
is saying that there might be white sharks here  
as well. I'm not sure if he's joking. This 
one is so dangerous. It's dangerous? Yeah.  
So if I touch this? It's not good? Not good. 
Let's just leave. Are you gonna leave it?
You can go this way. Okay. Hopefully 
it's just one. Can't believe  
we are walking around in the water 
and there's a "Box Jellyfish".
Hello everyone. Hello. How are you?
I'm saying hello everyone. But there 
are only seven of us on the boat. We  
have kind of a private tour. I'm sure 
we're getting along with everyone. So  
it's going to be a good day. First 
viewpoint Corong Corong. We're actually just  
on the boat right now. We're heading off. 
The motor is going to make some sound.  
It's going to be a bit loud. So uh yeah let's 
put some music on. Show you around. I'll show you  
around the ride. We're leaving Palawan 
behind to do this island tour. Let's go.
After a 40-minute ride, we are at 
our first destination; Secret Beach.
I almost fell in the water there. We 
have to swim for the last few meters.  
Because it's behind these rocks. It's not 
so secret anymore. We're not alone. There's  
not a boat waiting there. But we're 
going to check it out. Secret Beach.
Wow! Thank you.
We made it!
And we are at Secret Beach! No wonder it's called 
Secret Beach becaus, you have to go through that  
little hole right there. Especially when the sea 
is wild this is something that is quite dangerous  
to do. But were lucky. We're only here for a half 
an hour and then we carry on. Champs, if you are  
watching now and you're thinking of coming to 
the Philippines? This is the time! Because of the  
pandemic and all that. There are not many people 
here. You basically have a private experience  
at the moment. So that will hopefully change 
in the next few years again. Back to normal.  
But definitely right now is the time to come 
to the Philippines. Secret beach. This was our  
first stop. Let's go to our second stop. We still 
have got four to go. We were the only ones but...
Hello.
Welcome to the Philippines!
On our way to the second destination. We're gonna 
go snorkelling. We're taking the camera down into  
this blue water. The crystal blue water. Champs 
this is what the Philippines is also famous for.  
The fish, the water, diving. We're not gonna 
dive today. We're just gonna get some snorkels.  
Hopefully there will be a lot of fish. But the 
sun is out. It hasn't been raining today yet.  
So the water is really clear. A little bit 
later in this episode, we're gonna chat with  
Yesar. He's from Turkey. A tourist as well in 
the Philippines. I'm just gonna ask him if he  
enjoyed the Philippines. He's almost 
at the end of this trip and I'm  
gonna see also what his best experiences are 
here in the Philippines. There we go champs!
The water I've never seen so clear before. This 
is something else. We are in such beautiful  
surroundings as well. Not so many fish. I 
was hoping for a little bit more fish but,  
it's still a beautiful experience. We're 
glad we can share this with you. I hope  
you're still enjoying this ride. I think, 
I'm pretty sure we're gonna grab some lunch  
after this one but, let's crack on a little 
bit more. Maybe we'll find some more, new fish.
We're gonna have some lunch here. We're gonna talk 
to Yesar. The Turkish tourist I should call him.  
He likes to talk to us a little bit about 
the Philippines. How his experiences were  
travelling throughout the Philippines. I 
think he'd been to Boracay. He's been to  
Palawan and Manila. So we can learn a little 
bit of him as well. Hopefully, you hang out  
with us a little longer before we finish this 
episode. We've got chicken, fish, prawns,  
mussels, and pork. We've got the whole 
lot. Champs to let's have some lunch!
Why are you in the Philippines and how long 
have you been here? I have been planning this  
trip for three years ago. But after that, the 
pandemic started. That's why I postponed my  
vacation till now. I'm enjoying the Philippines 
so far. It's an amazing country really. There  
are many islands worth visiting. I have just 
been to some of them. When did you arrive?  
10 days I've been here. I've been in Oslob and 
Boracay. I spent my days there. Especially Boracay  
is one of the best. Yes, we are skipping that this 
time. This time we are in the Philippines, this is  
our first time, we're gonna have to come back to 
the Philippines soon. Just to explore Boracay as  
well. Definitely go to Puka Beach. Puka Beach. 
Okay, the best one is Puka Beach. This is the  
second time you're doing a boat trip from El Nido. 
Yeah. How have you been yesterday and today? Are  
you enjoying it? Yeah both of them are amazing. 
What's the best of your trip so far? What you've  
seen or tasted? I think swimming with whale 
sharks. That's the most amazing thing I have ever  
done in the Philippines. And I'm pretty sure I 
will come back to the Philippines again. It's  
not the last time. Hey mate, do you have a message 
for the world or some wisdom to pass on? You  
should all definitely visit the Philippines. And 
enjoy your time here. And greetings from Istanbul.
