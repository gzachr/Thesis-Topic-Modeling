 Future Friday. The freshest. It's Kim's getting sent to us. You know what we did, the largest crowds and stuff. And basically the Philippines is like some of the best crowds. They also have the largest gospel choir ever recorded in history of humanity. Because the Philippines does. Because that's just the thing you do. And how many people is there? That's a whole ass. It's thousands of people. Yeah, it's fucking... I've got different angles for you to have this. I think it's wonderful. I forget about gospel choir. I think there's a... Oh, I want to do that so badly. Not the gospel choir, I want a direct. I love to do that. I think you need an actual music library. No, you don't. You need to feel it. Like that kid in the church? Yeah, I love that. 8,600 88 for this music. There's no crowd. Is everybody speaking? It's the fucking space, mate. That's actually pretty cool. Yeah, it's the whole space. Achieve by a member's church of God International Philippines. She's not the maddery of people, right? How could they call it in this? They have choral graffiti. There was a crowd, yeah. I think these people here are crowds. So the bottom? Ah. These people here are crowd? Oh, I see. Oh my God, how crazy. There was a thing you need witnesses when you do like... Something like that. You do a world record. Yeah. You need like a witness or witnesses. You know, in this case? Glural. Yeah. It's a 360 show. There's people up in the bleachers, nothing God's. I can't get the lyrics wrong. Well, no one knows. Actually, no one's going to notice. Oh, I should have sneaked in there. I could have done it. I want to have a world record before I die. I genuinely do. I know like a hard one. I want to make for a world record. I don't know. Just someone who I can sneak in. Just a collaborative effort. A lot of just gospocchaya. I would be an effra. I would be an effra. I would be an effra. Man, the most I've ever seen. I have no idea. Your ideas actually scared me. You're an old lady. What a puzzle. I would love to try. They have screens with the director. I was going to say that. Like you see those screens. The director is beautiful. They could probably see it from their record. Like when they usually put a score in that. I was going to... Logistically speaking, I'm actually not in... I guess the musicians just need to be directed. Because actually songs are quiet songs. It's like a gospel. Yeah, but like, you know how like when you're in the stadium, things have delay. So like the version of the song that you're getting, if you're up in the gods, is a little bit off tempo. So you need the director. That's actually fair. Yeah, I didn't think of that. So they must have a director. This is the idea I have, right? Your ideas scare me. You see this? This is what you're seeing, right? But in the middle, right? Yes. It's me rapping. Oh. Yeah, you rap with the biggest gospel on earth. I think that could be more... Don't let Kanye listen to me. Oh no, no! Can't you wait for me to walk out? Don't do that. You've been weird. You've been weird. You're not still my idea. Or anyone who's watching. Why does that say publicly? I'm sorry, you could take it. I'll think of another one. I just want to come in and play the tambourine. I don't follow the news, but I know Kanye West has been in them a lot lately. I just don't click on what it is. I think he said some mad stuff. Really? I haven't read it or followed it any time. But finally he's been a bad man. He's been a bad man. He said some pretty mad stuff. Yeah, we'd love to be used to play this. Now, hey, oh, Kijaki. I want to know how they end. No, my question is, you know, my question is, where are the certified people from the... Ah, definitely. He comes amongst your plate section. That's nice. Oh, choreography days. Oh, that's New Year. That's fun. Look at that. From a choir perspective, that's actually so impressive. I know I'm taking the beat, but it's like a range of ways. That is so... I hate this one, record. I was wondering like... I think that's actually a bloody mad. They're like other angles. Logistically, that makes my sense to me. But this is another... Wow. I think they've tried it in several times. And I think that's the time they got it. Well, that's the previous ones, the gospel one. This one is the biggest choir in a single event. In the third place, as well. What event is this? What? Yeah, menta, right? And the name of that choir was... The name of this choir is... choir of the crescentle. The crescentle. It was in the... It was in the... Some bonks, some boanga times, some ship. Yeah, menta, right? What? Yeah. But it was... This was in the Philippine Arena worship service. I don't know, no idea. Heck done, that's what I think. Other people are also singing, because there's more worship here. I don't know. Wow, how big is this place? Oh my God. It sounds like an organ, dude. You know, there is an organ playing, right? But that is... But it sounds like... I don't know, it sounds like a mad instrument. It just... It's crazy. Say we lived in a simulation, right? And then the instrument... It would be an instrument made by people. The same way we look at keys, and we think of keys of like being... Not beings, they just things, right? Imagine like aliens, they just playing... What? I hate the fucking videos, because they make me feel so existential and bizarre. And I don't know what's happening to me. Oh my God! And that's all I'm gonna say. Imagine, yeah, imagine we were... What are you imagining, bro? Imagine we were the keys of a piano, a world piano that... I think that was the way. And that's what it would sound like. But it's just these big fingers. Just these big fingers. And then we sound... Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, thanks! No, it's so... What do you mean? You know, we look at piano keys, and they're being less than... They're not a thing, they don't have a song, right? But us! No, no, no, like singing. But you think someone's coordinating with a being, it's... It's like an alien being, it's the universe. And they're just pressing their big fingers on us. And then that's what makes us sick! Cuck, cuck, cuck, cuck! Oh! Just why'd you be... ...in the brain? This isn't... This isn't what it feels like. Just don't see my point, bro. Why don't you see my point? I think so, I think so. You have to see my point, you have to see my point. It makes no sense, it's like... I can't.
