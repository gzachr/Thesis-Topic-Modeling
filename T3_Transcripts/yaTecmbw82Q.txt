okay so this video is just gonna be the Daily 
Life of an American guy here in Cebu Philippines  
I'm here and I want to kind of make a video 
and just kind of show the cost of things and  
basically it's just gonna be like a vlog style 
what I'm doing in a day so let's check it out  
first thing I'm going to do is get a massage so 
it's gonna be the first massage I've actually  
gotten in Asia I haven't got a massage since I've 
been here and um I don't know it's just that this  
Thai massage spot here so I don't actually like 
the time the Thai massages are good but I don't  
like so much of the body bending stuff so I 
think I'm just gonna get it said Thai Swedish  
massage so I don't know what that is so we'll 
see it should be nice though so I'm going to  
continue on this video about making nothing and 
basically what I'm doing now is I just try to  
drop off my laundry at this place here but they're 
at lunch from 12 to 1 so they weren't there so I'm  
just gonna drive around and see if I can find 
another close spot to get our laundry done man
okay so I I thought I got lucky right across 
the street there's another place same company  
fortunate oh this lovely woman she opened it 
for me hello thank you okay now what time is  
it 12 30 right it's 12 30. yeah wow thank you 
so much I appreciate it um yeah I just gotta  
do these brush your regular Rush is one day yeah 
yeah how much you're gonna see the weight on this  
uh dirty clothes what do we got oh 1003 
pesos yeah okay so how many kilos is that yes
almost one kilo
oh you guys do dry cleaning too huh
okay there it was so 24 hours the rush service I 
think it's 60 pesos per kilo uh which is about a  
dollar per kilo and uh you get um like that's 
gonna cost me like 105 pesos so basically two  
dollars which is a great deal right so yeah I 
gotta get those cleaned up because I've been  
between me and you I've been wearing those shorts 
for like I don't know maybe nine days straight now  
I know okay so I think I'm gonna get my hair cut 
oh it's right here that's the fun you did it I  
just asked the gentleman I should have recorded 
it I said hey you know a good Barber Shop sir  
and he said uh what
so he said it's around the corner over here oh 
man it's so sketchy with the motorbike I said  
go around corner right here I think this is 
it right here I think this is the barber shop
foreign
how long have you guys been here for
so was that like because I went to another 
barber shop and it was like it was 350 pesos  
for the haircut so was that like the the 
price because you can get a haircut for  
like a hundred right yeah but like the good 
barber shops like 300 350. 400 yeah okay nice
oh what's up bro how you doing you 
couldn't you're gonna cut my hair okay cool

so I don't know I was just gonna get a regular 
haircut but it's a nice barber shop I think they  
do really good Cuts so maybe I get like a fade 
or something like that basically like how it  
is now but just shorten it yeah I don't know um 
I guess you can put a fade can you see how they  
cut it before oh can you can you see the fade 
before yeah maybe just like a fade fade yeah  
whatever you think looks best bro just like 
a fade and then like because when I put it  
down I just go like this you know what I mean 
because I'm like losing all my hair so maybe  
before yeah just you know just just like this but 
shorter you know what I mean yeah yeah thank you

a little bit all right I'll just  
probably make this fast forward so yeah okay yeah
