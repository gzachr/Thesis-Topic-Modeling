White people just refuse to buy rice cooker. They always say, Oh, rice cooker. We don't make rice that much. We use it a few times a year. But then they go back to La Cruzee. They don't use La Cruzee either. It's no garlic. The more the better, Asian people, we treat garlic like this. It never enough. Bay leaf, ground black pepper. Namo soy sauce. Dark soy sauce.

What a downgrade. I know. Keep Uncle Roger humble. Okay, okay. I massage properly. Look at this. Hit the pop belly. Happy ending. You know, happy ending. Nice, Leah. I heard it. That's good. But you think if your husband cur you, he could get happy ending. I mean, at least it's less work for me. That's how you can tell. They've been married for a long time. Yes, we have. Good feeling at home. Which one your favorite? That's all. But in cling film, in fridge for a few hours. We've been open for 11 years. We serve Southeast Asian food. Predominantly Thai and Filipino. But a lot of inspiration from Malaysia, Vietnam. Yeah, not all Southeast Asian country got good food, you know? Yeah. You don't want food from Laos. If you're traveling to New York, definitely check out that restaurant. Looks really good. I'm at travel back to New York some day as well. I don't know. My go-day just to try. I'm both there. I love those countries. Yeah, don't talk shit. Don't talk shit. Flowers food, like shit version of Thai food. I know I don't look it, but I am a person of, you know, and I am actually a total citizen. Mmm, yeah. I got some secret. If America go to shit, you can just fuck off and leave. That's a plan. Hahaha. Hi, and easily, why you give Uncle Roger instructions though? I'm trying to make it fancy for you. Oh. This looks like room. Make mistakes. You trying to wear a cube, your house or something? I, uh, come and pronounce the action for wear a cube. Is that correct? No. Wear a cube. Vacuum. Everybody understand Uncle Roger. Thank you. See? You got proper fire. That's fine. That's fine. Uncle Roger, you think Kenola oil? Don't use olive oil. Please not the Rachel Rachel. All right, here you go. No. No. Uncle Roger just used my hand. I got chef hand, you know? I know. I'm not pussy. I told you. Okay. I think you should use a chef hand. Just to make sure you're safe. Good food worth getting into hospital for, you know? Hi. Mmm. That's silly. Makes so happy. Don't need to cook all the way to just brown it. You'll look something like this. Good job. That looks good. Turn the heat down, put some water in there. That looks good. Put rest of the marinade liquid in. Let it simmer down for a few hours. Okay. Show us what you got on your induction. That looks legit, I must say. You like that, right? No. What? It's beautiful music. All right, I'm going to use tongs because you don't know I have kitchen hands. I have nothing to prove. So I'm actually doing... Don't, don't. Don't leave the chicken on. Because we're going to try. So we have bay leaves, garlic, same like you. Oh, yeah. You're bringing me food. I think I'll kitchen hand. I do, I do. Yeah? Is this kitchen hand? This is kitchen. You got crunchy hands that want you to cook. Whole black pepper porns, soy sauce. Do you use tamari H? No, we do not. Gluten free bullshit. For witty people. Some vinegar, Filipino brand, that's a putty. Mmm. That's Filipino brand. You see, with induction stove, you thought I wouldn't know if it's on. It's on, it has a... No, it does sound. Do do do do do. I think there's even an area in New York called Little Nila. The 90, a simmer is 318. It's a concentrate. Zero. Too complicated. This one, fire. Easy, you got big fire, small fire. No need 300, 400, 500 bullshit. The induction stove harder to understand than normal. For like an hour and a half. Yes. The adogosauce. All the same ingredients as before. And my secret ingredient. Coconut milk. No. Coconut milk. Ooh. Who says so? A lot of Filipinos are going to be very angry about this ingredient. Then why you do? Because in certain regions of the Philippines, they use coconut milk. Go into the common section. What region of Filipino you're spoken of in New York? New York, Philippines. Yeah, New York, Filipino. That's right, baby. I have actually a Filipino passport to prove my Filipino legit. Ooh. I know that I look very white, but I am a dual citizen. Like, Maksha, this look like the photo you take after you get to the art. I think that it makes everything well-rounded. Okay, I'm going to skip the code. Let's see how it goes. I think Joe Koi is going to come for you. Joe Koi has been here and he loves Maya Dova. Joe Koi. Next to Joe Lama. I'm telling lie or not. Surprise. This noise is not a part I need in my dream. My ex-wife is going to bite this for me. I'm going to chop and cut. And take all my money. Okay, so we're just going to have everything in the pot. So, it's all. No. Looks like he has been following. No. Yes, yes, yes. So, I'm going to just be in there to feed yourself some. Come on. No. So, my mom and dad are both at the same time. That means that they're too small. And then they got married and they came back to New York. Nice. Look at first sight. No, my dad chased out my mom for a long time. Really? Yeah. Or your mom just one green cut. No, but it's cooking down. Remember to taste it. I think I need a bit more to love to try that. So, this is the one that we braised. I cooled it down and then I'm just going to score the skin. Mmm. And this helps it. Just, it makes it easier to cut after you fry it. Now we deep fry it. This is low-budget production. See, Uncle Roger lighting guy also. Only Asian restaurant got neon green wine, you know? That's what I was going for when I chose that color. It's one, it's a YouTuber thing. No matter how much budget you have, it's always going to be a very simple budget. Let me just show you. Let me just show you my tripod. Always like that. Always will, whatever you have. Yeah? An Michelin star restaurant. There was not neon green. Well, we don't have a Michelin star here. Yeah. Wakada. It's okay, it's okay. Hi. I like this also. So spiritual. This the kind of shit white people get, other than vacation and parties for two weeks. And who, who these people? Uh, these are my family members. Oh, nice. No, I'm just kidding. I have no idea who they are. These are the ancestors who are crying after they see Rachel Ray of the world. Even go. Do you know how to use a knife? Yeah. How's your cutting skills? Not amazing, but possible. Okay. Or I just do have all my fingers. Oh, okay. That's good. I also still have my fingers. The knife's not sharp enough. Really? You're blaming me, Uncle Roger. Yeah? You're blaming me? I wear like an earring. Yeah? Yeah. Switched up the technique. I like it. Yeah. Change it. It looks like they're having another. The stitches are different, you know? Sometimes you want nice short strokes. Sometimes you want long R&E strokes. Okay. Very good. The day almost over. Finally. Pour your pop and pour the marinade out into the bowl. Sprinkle some spring onion on it. So this Uncle Roger version of a dough bag. Oh, I hear there's three of us. This is a chef Leah husband. Do you used to be my sous chef? Yeah, that's how we met. So you take your pulse? Yeah, I did. Yeah. It's not my way right to the top. Fuiu! The good old day. No H. Now, I think you sleep with your employee. They're gonna cancel you. I would have been in so much trouble. Look at the day. You know? Yeah. Get my microphone close to the, the KSM artist. Yeah. The split? Yeah. Yeah, baby. Uncle, the sneak one in. Yeah. Nice, Ted. Mmm. Delicious. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Dr. Truffle, I'm maybe more ready. Yeah. Mmm. Uncle Roger always think, or last the roll is the joy of life. That is true. That was a joke. That's why. Okay, at least you're not like Rachel Ray putting whole choreography in this. Oh my god. No, I don't think we're going to understand the way it's over. I'm sorry. Suvi Day. Nice. Wow. It's beautiful. Mmm. Mom has no lights on her speed. Breakfast looks sexy. Ground black pepper. Daily powder. Fried garlic. And these sexy scallions, someone cut. Yeah. That's it. Mmm. This looks restaurant-level. Yeah. This looks like some random guy, Joe Shit in Pan. I think. Is that what a tofu is? It looks good. Here comes the taste test. Moment of truth. Regular, poor bowl version. A tofu. Mmm. Sweet, salty. I can taste all the vinegar. Oh wow. You said it properly. Inquish, improve. Yes, after one day with me, not even. Give me a week. No more accent. Oh no. I'm glad that nobody going to watch my YouTube Rachel. Time for yours. Can I break the yolk? Yep, yep. Oh, makes it all in. Mmm. Yes. It's just sauce, but you know. Did you see this? It just melts. Wow. I don't know if they even need knife to cut it. It just melts. Uh. Excuse me while I just go and grab. I don't know what it is. I can't admit a coconut. A tofu taste. Honestly, anyone who tries a coconut milk in there or a dobo, we're never going to go back to a dobo without coconut milk. Mmm. You mean all this new things for Uncle Roger? Oh, so why is this? Yeah. So this is food from the restaurant. We have sea sticks. And then this is our chili candy. Oh, good. Yeah. I know. Uncle Roger, favorite. This Malaysian dish. Mmm. Are you still out dish? It looks good too. I did it inspired by you guys. Uncle Roger have to say, the a dobo is fancy in a good way. Elevate the whole dish. Taste better than regular a dobo. That's nice. So Uncle Roger going to call you. Antilia from now on. Oh. It's a teetalia. Titalia. It's a teetal. Teetal Roger. Teetal Roger. For you. Nice, nice. I can't believe he approved it. Antilia restaurant. Fuck the MNM store. That's right. So we have two locations. One in the lower east side, Picking cow, and then one right near Madison Square Garden, called Piggy Back. Thank you for 8 million subscribers. I know, I know. I'm sick of that. Asian people, we treat garlic like money. It never enough. He said jokes so many times. Yeah. There are only so many jokes you can make about garlic. No. You like that? You like that? No. Love blue pass. Do do do do do do. That's ****. Yeah, we have two locations. Piggy Back is the original location in the lower east side. No. That's not true. Piggy Cow. It's your own restaurant. Your restaurant. Wait till you're a parent. Your brain is like. You gotta try that again. How you know anti-ester? We've been friends for a while. In the restaurant industry. Everybody knows each other. Especially two women. You know, with restaurants being successful. That's not a normal thing. So. You say woman can't be successful at a restaurant. No, I'm not saying that at all. I'm saying that it is harder for women. Test test. Talking to you. That's how I do my video. That's the close-up camera. And then this the full camera. That's how I do things. Doing food shit. Yeah. Alright, let's see. Say that. All the same. Say that. Oh, that was such a lovely video. It definitely put a smile on my face. I hope it did the same to you as well. It's just something about Uncle Roger that. It gives humor. It's just so unique. And since I've been living in Asia for over five years, I can relate to so many things. And I hope I, you know, could also add some of my knowledge to it. You guys. I think it was just laughing the whole video. But yeah, nevertheless, I hope you had a good time. And you subscribe to this channel. Maybe I'll make it to 8 million subscribers one day. I think fingers crossed. And I'll see you guys next time here on. What's up, Philippines? Bye. You
