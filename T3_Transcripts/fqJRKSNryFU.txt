But very exciting news, our food arrived because we ordered some food because Andrea is going to come and Jeff, it's news if you know let's order some food, some family platters. Oh my god, that's a lot of rice. But why is it so yellow? Yellow rice. But Gaze, we got some beef. Some rice. Just rice, yeah. And then a burger. And some chicken. Oh, that looks really good. That looks amazing. Nice. Should we leave it on the table or here in the kitchen? Ah, I'll leave it on the table. On the table? Alright, so Andrea just takes it with me that she's here. So I'm going to go downstairs and pick her up. So actually our friend Jeff will come as well but he is flying from Boracay to Manila. Tonight and he actually arrives in Manila at 10.40pm. So we really really are crossing our fingers and hoping that he's going to make it in time. Hello! Oh, you can take it off or keep it on whatever you feel like. I'm removing it, finishing all the food. So we are not dirty. So we got some food. That's why I said don't bring food. You can get some chicken, some rice, some beef. You got a lot. I hope you're hungry. There's very high hope. Hold your phone. Okay, okay. Don't drop your phone. This is not all. This is not all. This is not all.

The three I was explaining to me that at midnight, on New's Eve, here in the Philippines, apparently it's a thing to jump to get taller. But then I was saying to Andra, actually, I'm not going to do that because I don't want to get taller. I'm already taller enough. I'm taller enough. There you are.

We have other weather in one day. Yes. So how did you like your news? I was amazing. And forget about again. Yeah, seriously. This holiday season Christmas news, if you're in the Philippines, literally was the best decision ever to spend here. Don't you think? I'm so, so grateful that we had the opportunity to come here before Christmas. Now we're going to go to eat some steak. We feel like eating steak. Happy New Year! But definitely as soon as we woke up this morning. Because I was saying good morning as with joke guys. It's not morning anymore. It's 4.30 pm. But we had a nap so that's why it's good morning. But the first thing I noticed when we woke up this morning was how quiet Manila is today. Like even I'm looking here right now on the street, it's pretty empty the streets. You don't hear many cars upstairs. They go over. Everyone is at home. We go party. No, we're not cook. No way. But it's crazy. And I had the same feeling on the first Christmas day. Like the day after Christmas Eve, I also had that feeling that it was super, super quiet. No cars. Nothing. A-ha. A few shops. I closed. Starbucks is open. I know that that's not Starbucks. That's a coffee bean. You joking. I always believed it was Starbucks. And now you can see how much I care about coffee. I've really thought until this second that that was Starbucks. Apparently I never read that sign. I think I'm wide. Guys, this is Hakati Avenue. Can you believe that? Can you believe that? No way. I'm hungry. Wow. I've got my feet on a car. And I'm on the ground. I'm on the feet on a car. And I'm on the ground. All right, we quickly did some groceries, and the restaurant was really, really cool. It was so nice. We've never been there. I'm pretty sure if you Google, must do things in Manila. I'm pretty sure that you can find this restaurant probably. Anyway, guys, we're going to head home and work a little bit more. And I think we're going to have an early night. Go early to sleep and start the second day tomorrow of this new year. So how do you guys enjoy the vlog? And again, we will show happy, happy, happy, happy new year. Prosperacy for you and all your dreams come true. And I see you the next one. Mwah!
