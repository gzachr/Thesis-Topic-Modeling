name Shirley Shirley nice to meet you

is ours this is ours we are in the
T we're going to Lon station Lon 
Lon station yes you know where  
to go it looks like the ones from 
India this is so cool because no  
matter what the weather is you've got some 
curtains you got a roof so you don't get
wet thank you I found a friend I want to go to 
BGC I can go in here where where do I get all  
Market Market Market Market okay and then I 
can walk to VGC okay how much 10 driver 10 20  
16 I will ask the driver okay what is your name 
Andrew Andrew thank you so much Andrew to meet  
youo nice to meet you can I take a picture in 
the front I can take okay this is our mode of  
Transport for today good photo I'm going to 
get in right now and we're going to head to  
BGC this is such a crazy day but how cool is this 
they're like kind of still keeping these from the  
world war but now they're actually sexy pretty 
cool we made it into the deep kny and the best  
part about being in the Philippines is you can 
just ask anybody and they'll help you I'm not  
sure how much it costs but we're going to take 
this Jeep KN to Market Market which I think is  
one of the train stations and then we're 
going to walk from there to bonesio High
Street so this is by far the best way to get 
around Manila and I absolutely love it because  
you kind of feel like you're just a part of the 
vibe and the energy of everyone and everybody  
has this kind of trust system where you just pass 
your money forward to the driver and everyone kind  
of just knows exactly where they need to get off 
we have no idea where to get off so this could be
interesting and welcome to BGC what a massive 
difference this is compared to where we just  
were right now we're walking through a it looks 
like a popup market and when we were here last  
time it was like Peak Peak Co which was over 
a year ago so this pretty much didn't exist  
last time and it's actually so nice to see so 
much everyone's out and about everyone's buying  
stuff there's street food there's clothes there's 
jewelry lots of nice clothes actually it is so  
strange to go from the loud and busy contrast 
this morning in divisor to this where it's so
quiet hello it feels so strange because we had 
such a lot of noise and especially in the Jeep  
KN as well but now it's quiet it's peaceful and 
this is kind of the different size and what we  
were saying the different contrast that you get 
here in Manila the noise gives you an energy where  
this is more like relaxed you kind of want to go 
to a bakery or a cafe there's so many like nice qu  
little shops here it's so quiet so peaceful we can 
definitely say goodbye to the lovely 20 peso and  
10 peso prices because I promise you nothing here 
is going to be as cheap as it was this morning
[Music] I think this is the perfect time to 
just sit down wind down and have a delicious  
coffee and it's crazy because we were having 
chicken balls in the rain in divisoria and  
now we're having a delicious coffee in 
BGC and it's pouring with rain right now  
and now we're having a delicious coffee 
watching the rain instead of being in
it so you can see the contrast here is 
completely different to this morning  
there are lots of highend shops are business 
building blocks behind me this 3D screen which  
is just Madness compared to where we were this 
morning and we just wanted to show you all the  
different sizes that you get here in Manila and 
I think that is why we love the city we then flew  
all the way to SAU City and today we're doing 
something super super fun we're actually going  
island hopping which is just a hop and a skip 
away from Sabu City which happens to be the  
oldest city in the Philippines and you wouldn't 
think that you'd find the most gorgeous Islands  
right here by the city I think we're going 
to be really really surprised today so first  
things first we're going to hop onto the boat and 
go to our first island this is super exciting and  
it seems to be pretty busy too our boat is here 
already but it's not this one it's the next one

I think I've ever had seeing massive fish lots  
of sea life beautiful coral and of course 
always crystal clear Waters in The [Music]
Philippines thank you we have made it off the 
boat onto the next Island and apparently this  
is a privately owned Island it's incredible that 
just of SAU City you have all of this beautiful  
blue water we've been to some other Islands since 
we've left the Philippines but nothing compares  
to the Beautiful clear water and previously we 
went to the markets like gapo Market in Manila  
divisoria in Manila this is completely different 
you get the sides of Manila where it's busy lots  
of street food and then you have this calm and 
relaxed ocean life Welcome to the Philippines and  
look at this insane Boardwalk that we're on right 
now we're about to go and have some lunch we can  
also snorkel here once we're done with lunch and 
apparently you can see some amazing sea turtles  
and this is why we come to the Philippines for 
experiences like this the Philippines is so much  
fun so this is the beautiful island and restaurant 
where we're going to have some lunch right now and  
it's literally on this beautiful blue water so 
while we eat we can just overlook this ocean so  
this is where we're going to have lunch today and 
look at the size of this lechon right now and this  
is our view fish crab oh just crab oh fresh crab 
fish crab no just tab so for lunch we have an all  
you can eat buffet and she said just eat as much 
as you like over here in the front we have some  
fresh fruit so that's watermelon and some mango 
we have some skewers we have chicken ooh look at  
these prawns they look like they've been dunked 
in a little chili sauce that looks so good and  
then we have the fresh crab the Filipino noodles 
and of course no Filipino meal is complete without  
the rice and we have a little Sal salad bar over 
here we've got everything cucumbers olives corn  
tomato more olives more onions salad that looks 
like tofu I'm not sure what that is this looks  
like a a sea grape salad that's interesting we are 
surrounded by the clearest water I've ever seen  
we got lunch with a view we're now just exploring 
this beautiful island we ate some delicious lunch  
and we always love the Philippino food so after 
having some lunch we now got back on the boat  
and now we're going to explore a different Island 
and throughout our day we have just had these dark  
and light patches of beautiful blue water and I 
hope you can hear me because these boats are so  
loud you don't necessarily have to go all the way 
to pan if you're looking for Blue Water we found  
it so we recommend you book this tour so right 
now I am sitting right in the bow of the boat  
and if I extend this you kind of get an idea of 
just the size of these boats what an experience  
you can see how beautiful and clear this water 
is beside me we have the girl in the back over  
there and this is everything we love about the 
Philippines you've got the Beautiful Blue Waters

transport in the Philippines because they're so 
different when we were in Manila we saw all the  
Jeep knes but now these don't really look 
like Jeep knes they're more like mini cabs  
and I think you can fit I don't know maybe 
like 15 to 17 people in there and I'm sure  
they're just as cheap maybe 10 peso which is 
just unbelievable like the transportation is  
so cheap I read the other day how many people 
can fit into a Jeep me and the answer is one  
more there's always space for one more you 
can stick as many people in there as you
can I think this is our moment across the road 
okay now quick quick quick zabu is so busy  
bustling but after you've been to manila manila 
is just on a whole other level so now when we walk  
around Sabu even though there's so much traffic 
and hustle and bustle we kind of just feel more
relaxed since we are in a different side of 
Sabu we're literally just finding whatever  
we can on the street and seeing how much 
they cost pretty much these little mini  
cabs stop everywhere I wonder what those ladies 
across the street are selling I can see there's  
something there's definitely something there

still having a good time and they're always  
happy what a day it's kind of fat yeah this 
is a bit of a fat like wide banana yeah why  
is it so fat so chunky today we just wanted 
to see how much street food we can find on  
one street everything we ate today including 
the drinks the extra little rice was less than
$5 today we have just arrived at the Port 
here in Sabu City yes we are finally going  
on a fairy trip for 2 hours from Sabu to 
T balarin to one of our favorite Islands  
we are going to the island of bahal and 
previously when we were in the Philippines  
we went to bahal with my parents so 
this trip is going to be completely
different thank you ma'am good morning dogger 
excuse the dog that's freaking out in the back  
I think he's in that little box we had to pay a 25 
PES fee to get into the terminal and now we have  
this beautiful waiting area where we're going 
to wait for about 20 minutes for our fairy to
leave what time um 9 920 gate number six 
gate number six go straight left side okay  
thank you wow that was super easy everything 
has been super seamless today we checked in  
our bag dog is still barking lots of cafes 
around I think we need a coffee yes let's  
get a coffee I need to wake up you know 
in couples where one person just books  
and plans everything and the other one just 
shows up can you guess who's who you might  
be surprised I feel like so much has changed 
since the last time we were here this is much  
bigger there's lots of shops there's lots of 
places to sit and there's even some [Music]
entertainment wow look at all the cakes 
this too early can we have two hot latte  
I think when you're traveling as a couple 
you learn to have separate roles sh does  
some things I do some things and I think 
it just works seamlessly so let us know  
if you're traveling as a couple what your 
roles are do you know which pier are we going
to do you know how long the fairy is do you 
know how long it's going to take to get to  
our hotel do you know which hotel we staying 
at I packed the bag okay and davon's job is  
to tell us way to to go and help to get there 
and how long it's going to take I just show up
okay hello is this here we 
go 2 hours to B thank you
ma'am so we paid $16 each for this fairy and we 
booked our ticket to be on the top so I think  
this is amazing it's kind of like an open air seat 
you can sit down below and those are maybe fancier  
seats but this where we get to see the ocean go 
by see some of the islands as we make our way to  
Bal but on the inside the air conditioner is so 
cold so I'm really happy that we're sitting out  
here we can get some fresh air seab Breeze and 
these are the seats that we have and there is  
a life jacket underneath just in case we need it 
we were almost late to get onto the fairy so we  
had to quickly put our coffee in a takeaway cup 
but we made it and this is where we're going to  
be spending the next 2 hours on our way to Baho 
this way we get to have some fresh [Music] air8  
we are officially leaving the pole so goodbye 
SAU and we're making our way all the way down
there right now we're going under one of the 
biggest Bridges here in the Philippines which  
connects Sabu City to mton I think I remember that 
this bridge was made to celebrate 500 years in the  
Philippines and it's absolutely beautiful it is 
a massive bridge I think it only opened last year  
when we were here in subu it wasn't even finished 
yet so please correct me if I'm [Music] wrong we  
initially wanted to book the seats with the AC but 
I'm so glad that we didn't because the fresh air  
is so nice plus you get a magnificent view the 
entire way to behold we get to see the bridges  
the mountains the sea I'm enjoying every second 
just going to drink my coffee and [Music] enjoy  
so a few reasons why I recommend you book this 
is first of all you get the open air and the  
beautiful view but it's also the cheapest ticket 
even the people that are downstairs want to be up  
here and they don't get a good view and look 
at the view that we [Music] get so one thing  
I do whenever we go on a vessel or a train or 
a bus is see what speed we're going at since  
we went on the fastest train in South Korea I 
wanted to see what the speed was and right now  
it feels like we're cruising and I looked we're 
going about 45 km an hour on a big berry like  
this is super impressive so not only is the view 
amazing but we're also going to get there quickly  
speed app get yourself a speed app get yourself 
a boyfriend who loves things like Speed apps
so after a very seamless 2-hour Journey from 
SAU to tag balarin we have now arrived at the  
Port hello saying hello watched you guys oh

I to be here let's go to wo let's go see what 
we can find I'm so excited for a new adventure
and what's
happening yes we're in B now we got to find 
our way to Pang which I think is a 45 minute  
drive if I'm not mistaken the best part about 
traveling in the Philippines is each new place  
that you arrive in is a new adventure so I'm 
so excited for what we're going to see here  
what we're going to eat and the adventures 
that we're going to go on bye bye nice to  
meet you thank you ma'am welcome thank you we got 
already have a hotel pickup which is super easy I

Pango what is your name I'm John John nice 
to meet you John you're going to drive us  
to Pang yes sir are you from Bal yes okay nice 
to meet you we got this whole V ourselves so we  
got a comfortable drive maybe 30 minutes to 35 
minutes 30 minutes okay perfect thank you what  
do you call this car in front tukk a trike or 
Tuk Tok how much does it cost to take a trike  
in bah depend on what location you're going 
for you're going to Pang from here like maybe
400 and after a short 30 minute drive we have 
made it to the city of Panglao we are making  
our way now from a hotel we have just checked in 
and we're going to the beach our hotel is like  
a minute away from the beach I can see the water 
oh I remember all of these boats wow look at this  
look how beautiful it is the water so clear so I 
guess we're going to have to keep walking all the  
way along there's a little foot path here and then 
we're going to get to the main Beach area where  
all the restaurants are and all the bars hello 
good afternoon we have the thick luscious trees  
all around us and the Ocean looks great weather 
is treating us we are already adventuring we're  
going to see what we can find and the whole reason 
we came to bahal is we want to go to our favorite  
island so you're going to have to keep watching to 
see which that is and we'll tell you exactly why  
it's our favorite island so if you don't know bah 
is is the 10th biggest island in the whole of the  
Philippines and we did come here previously about 
a year ago and it's known for the tazas which is  
the smallest primate in the world and over 1,000 
chocolate heels we went and explored all of those  
tourist sites the previous time we were here with 
my parents so if you haven't already we'll put a  
link to that video in the description below so 
clear and all the boats are coming in I think  
everyone's done with their Island topping here 
oh I just can't wait to get out there I miss  
the long sticks that they use boat and it kind 
of reminds me of barakai which kind of has this  
beautiful beach we then have the palm trees on 
this side it was midco time when we were here  
so there weren't as many boats maybe one or two 
so it's so good to see that the Philippines is  
booming and so many boats are [Music] here so 
we've just been exploring the streets here in  
Panglao and it is so busy and vibrant there's lots 
of people coming out and it's so good to see that  
the tourism is back but we have seen the sign 
of over here that says hello mango hello mango  
I'm not sure what that is it's either like hello 
hello or it's a mango flavored hello hello hello  
hello but mango I wonder if that's even possible 
have you had the hello mango hello mango is it  
good good love me love okay okay you one you want 
one yeah yeah I will see if it's expensive or not  
you're waiting okay good if that is true hello 
hello but mango version I'm going to freak out  
because I love mango and to have that with all 
the hallo hallo toppings would be insane so is  
it a hello hello so we got mango ice cream then 
mango and then a cone but they've got all sorts  
of things where's the hello part I think there's 
more than this variation oh and there's a window  
you can just order through the window look at all 
of these variations look how huge this is they've  
got all sorts of coconut shakes calaman shakes 
watermelon I want to try everything I have no  
idea which one we should choose look at the size 
of this this is 800 peso can we have one mango Hol  
yes 250 man okay thank you thank you this is

hello mango genius if you are a mango lover this 
is the spot and I've Just Seen they've been doing  
this since 2007 and we've only just discovered 
it now but I can definitely understand the
hype we're having a a welld deserved dinner 
on the beach and it is so nice to just sink  
your feet in the sand we've got a very 
early morning tomorrow so we'll see you
then we've woken up bright and early to 
go on a little bit of an ocean adventure  
and because we love snorkeling we wanted 
to check out the vibrant Underwater World  
by doing a little island hopping trip 
this is our lovely Captain alter good  
morning good morning he's going to be taking 
care of us today thank you so much [Music]
the waters are super crystal clear here 
and we wanted to check out what Bal has  
to offer the weather is looking good so 
let's see what we get ourselves [Music]
[Music]
into
we have now arrived at basag island and this is 
our favorite island here in the Philippines why  
because it is perfectly circular and then it has 
this beautiful blue water lots of reefs lots of  
sea life all around it and we get to see our 
favorite marine animal which is the turtle and  
apparently there are a few here today there's not 
too many waves so hopefully Crossing thumbs we get  
to see some turtles today they have so many boats 
today that are making the trip to Bic lots of  
pristine beaches white sand Coral heads everywhere 
the water looks crystal clear it is just this  
piece of Paradise in the middle of nowhere so we 
are about to go snoring this is our guide Lorenzo  
he is going to take us out to the turtles basag is 
known for having loads and loads of turtles kind  
of the home of turtles so we're going to get in 
this tiny little boat what do you call this boat  
pedal Bo pedal boat and we're going to Pedal 
out to the turtle which is awesome wow here we  
go okay what you are we going under going on the 
world's smallest boat watch your head this boat is  
so small that we can go under the other boat yeah 
we're literally going under this boat W watch it  
we have perfect conditions today unfortunately we 
forgot our GoPro so that's why I have to use this  
and I'm sure the sound and quality isn't going 
to be as good but we're going to try and show  
you exactly how beautiful the sea light is and 
hopefully the turtles here we go let's go see  
what we can find we can see everything beneath 
us unreal and the water's perfectly glassy we  
got some Coral heads beneath us and we were just 
told because basag is a national park we have to  
swim with a guide that's why we have Lorenzo in 
the back and we can only swim for an hour okay  
we've just arrived in the designated snorkeling 
Zone and this is where lots and lots of fish are  
so you have to come out here with your guide so 
we're going to suit up put our mask our snow on  
let's go see some fish We Ready Lorenzo you 
ready he's ready okay Lorenzo's putting in  
the anchor so we don't go anywhere and he's ready 
I'm ready sh's ready this is where we're going to  
be spending the next hour we're going to take 
our live jackets on so we can go as deep as we  
can into the fish this is incredible because 
you can just go straight off your little pedal
[Music]
boat I think there's going to be a lot of 
fish around us and hopefully some [Applause]
turtles
our whole snorkeling trip was absolutely 
amazing crazy to think that we were swimming  
with some of the biggest Turtles I've ever 
seen But then also the little baby ones and  
they were full of energy they were coming 
right up to the shore taking little gasps  
of air and it was so nice to just swim 
with them they were super playful their  
beautiful colors watch them eat off the sea 
floor and just to spend time with them is
unbelievable so we're on the boat about to leave 
the island and he is right here hi little and look  
how close he is to the shore look how close he's 
he's incredible we can see him coming up to the
surface go to the surface wow I see he's right 
in front of us wow watch your head on the oh I
see oh he's going
down so up wow we're seeing so many come 
to the surface just to breathe okay Chris  
let's go let's go Chris let's go Chris let's go 
let's go okay bye bye Turtles we're going back to
[Music] theall we finally come back to 
the main island I I need a big coffee  
thank you so much this is what we need to 
wake up right now we're on one of the side  
streets and we're having some crunchy wraps 
we can eat some amazing street food with  
all the people walking by and then we're 
going to explore the rest of the [Music]
island good morning we are starting our day 
off with a very early Adventure but luckily  
we have got some good weather so the moment we 
have some good weather we know it's time for a  
good Adventure we've actually rented a little 
scooter here on Panglao Island and that calls  
for a little bit of a road trip adventure 
this morning we haven't actually been to a  
waterfall here in the Philippines So today we're 
going to go and find one I think it's one of the  
most beautiful ones it's going to take us about an 
hour to get there thank you are you ready to go do
this let's go
woohoo oh I need to drive on the right 
hand side oh right hand side we forget
[Music] that so right now we're 
crossing the bridge from pangl to  
b island and this is where our adventure 
really begins we're going to be heading  
through the town of tech balarin and 
then we're going to be in the jungle  
and let's go and see what we can find 
[Music] wo so as we're making our way
out they're playing music as we're making 
our way out of the city and further into  
the jungle the thick Greenery and Lush 
trees is just like unbelievable this is  
what we missed in the Philippines it's not 
only about the cities that we've been in  
Sabu and in Manila it's about getting out and 
exploring these [Music] islands we're going  
past all these little Villages and people 
small houses and it's just incredible and  
right now we're going past a little Lake 
on this side beautiful Lake this is the  
best feeling of Freedom exploring on the bike 
yes freedom fresh air oh so good through the
village we've just stopped for a little break 
because the back and the bum is suffering but  
look how beautiful these roads are and 
there is nobody here as you drive we've  
only been driving for about 30 minutes 
the roads are getting quieter and quieter  
we've left the cities and we're heading 
into the jungle do you like my cool hat
there's so many reasons why Bal is one 
of our favorite Islands because not only  
do you get to swim with Incredible Turtles 
but you also get to go on these magnificent  
drives in the Luscious Green Jungle you 
just get to see so much more on a bike  
instead of maybe in a car or in a tour 
bus and you can stop whenever you like  
so we're about 3 minutes away and then we 
are at the waterfall let's go see I think  
we might have a 10 to 15 minute walk to the 
waterfall and then we will finally be [Music]
there okay we just hid mud wa are 
we going the right way I have no
idea I'm in the mud we in the
mud here's the parking yeah there we go okay we  
found a whoa found a parking spot you 
good okay I think this is the parking
spot over here where do we park 
over there over there over there  
okay okay we have arrived oh 
it's a buffalo D through nice
table oh be here how much 100 for he 100 so 200 
p and then the motorcycle is 20 20 for paret 20  
220 okay so where do we go here on this way you 
follow the people here follow the people people  
here go down the how long does it take and 10 
minutes or 10 minutes yes oh perfect okay thank  
you you need to be strong oh yes you can we are 
okay okay okay good thank you you're strong you  
can do it we can make it let follow the people 
apparently this is one of the Lesser known ones  
so we're going to hike for the final few 10 
minutes well judging from this book here this  
is the date and it's just one other person there's 
literally only three of us a little slippery but  
I'm off I'm off to the waterfall look there's a 
move he mo wow we're literally just in the jungle  
right now this is so cool we're in the middle of 
like nowhere we got some coconut trees around us  
and I don't even know where we're going she 
said it's going to take 10 minutes I don't  
know if that's a 10minute hike 10minute walk 
and we've got all these rice fields around us  
you can just hear sounds of nature there's some 
chickens in the back so who knows where we're  
going right now ah to the Kamal Falls OH the way 
oh the Way's down down this way oh oh okay okay  
thank you okay 1 minute in we've already gone the 
wrong way oh dear I didn't see another path who
knows I don't know I guess so yeah knows where 
we're going I guess it's this way you know the  
jungle girl no I just realized just like not into 
the mud and the bugs and yeah which way to the PO  
this way not sure me neither thank you for your 
help thank you so we've been walking down this  
sketchy looking path and we've heard the water 
and you can just see through this Gap in the trees  
the most beautiful waterfall that looks probably 
like 100 ft high you can hear how loud it is and  
I think there's like a Cove or a lake that the 
waterfall is falling into so we're going to try  
and get the Drone up and see what it looks like 
and I think that's our best way of figuring out  
how do we get there we have just gotten the Drone 
up and boy I can't wait to show you what this  
actually looks like from above you can literally 
see the typical Philippines blue green water and  
then at the top you've got the most magnificent 
water flowing straight into it and because it's  
rainy season it's been raining a lot so that water 
is really gushing down into that little Lagoon at  
the bottom it's like an oasis in the middle of 
the Jungle and when you're walking through you  
you can't really hear it you cannot see anything 
but from above there's just this beautiful Lake  
of water with the water gushing down as shev 
said I'm like blown away I don't know what what  
am I even looking at right now I'm totally 
Blown Away what do you think my guy he's so
[Music]
chilled this is meant to be monsoon 
season here in the Philippines but  
I'm sweating like crazy everywhere and 
it's boiling hot what a perfect place  
to have an adventure and nobody's here 
I mean you can go to some of the most  
touristy parts of Bal there are lots 
of tourists here but here there's no
one we haven't even got to the waterfall 
yet and I can already recommend coming here  
just because there's no tourists here it's 
beautiful covered in the jungle it's quiet  
it's an oasis the how these stairs are you 
got to just watch a step be really careful  
you can see how thick all of this jungle 
is and we're going to make our way all the  
way down I assume and somewhere in there is 
the water she said 10 minute walk watch your
step doing a little hike like this kind 
of reminds me of when we were tracking  
to Everest Base Camp but obviously in very 
different conditions we were covered with  
lots of gear it was freezing cold and now it's 
boiling hot in the jungle but it's giving some  
flashbacks if you haven't watched our Everest 
series please go and watch it it is the best  
series we've ever made we're just going like 
deeper and deeper into the jungle but now we're  
starting to hear the water it's so tropical and 
humid here in this tree cover I can see some of  
the water down there and it's Crystal Clear 
which is crazy because we're stepping in the  
mud and the thick jungle but there's beautiful 
crystal clear water I see it you see it oh it  
looks insane from here oh I need to get closer 
keep going keep going going almost there this  
is the most thing I've ever seen some band 
Rod that have cross over so they're a bit
loose this is incredible I feel like I've walked 
into some sort of Avatar Pandora situation because  
you're just walking through the jungle and then 
you have this the most perfectly made waterfall  
I've ever seen it's magnificent and then you can 
see the Crystal Blue Water just at the bottom of  
it people have asked us why did you come back 
to the Philippines it's for reasons like this  
there's so much in this country to see and 
do wow if we didn't come back we would have  
never seen this there's so much to explore here 
and the best part about this place we have this  
entire little pool and waterfall to ourselves 
there are so many tourists here in ball and I  
think we are the luckiest people today not 
a person inight even though we are the only  
ones here I did read that you can swim in this 
water and I've seen just from this side there's  
kind of a ledge at the end of this rock B so I'm 
going to attempt to jump off of that maybe it's  
about 3 or 4 M high I would say it's honestly 
a perfect Oasis waterfall pool coconut trees  
the girl and they've kind of got a makeshift 
like Hut here so we can sit under there in the  
shade keep all our bags and time to go swimming 
what an adrenaline rush this is going to be it  
is much higher than it looks right now to jump 
next to a beautiful natural waterfall 3 2 1 go
woo wooho feels like you're falling Forever This 
is where we get to spend our afternoon this is why  
Bol is amazing this is why the Philippines 
is amazing I can just lie here the whole
day 1 year ago we were in the Philippines with 
de's parents and we made them try some pretty  
exotic street food I'm here for everything like 
seat grapes hwk blood and Pig's brain with our  
amazing local guide Pro and now that we're back 
we've asked her to take it up a notch I have no  
idea what this is O are we going to regret that 
she's picked out some of the Philippines most  
exotic and jaw-dropping Street Foods eyes cheering 
that are bound to get our faces looking like this  
this is what we're eating let's see how much 
our stomachs can handle today and we've arrived  
at our first spot for today which is partel I 
think that's how you pronounce it and this is  
where we're going to meet crew right now for 
our first dish of today and I can see on the  
sign there is a fish so I have no idea what we've 
got in store for our first thing today so as you  
can see I've got a little bit of a mischievous 
look on my face and that's because today we're  
doing our exotic street food tour with a bit of 
a Twist so I know what we're about to have and  
crew knows what we're going to have today but d 
has no idea this is the face of someone who has  
no idea what he's about to eat and I cannot wait 
to see his reactions it's going to be Priceless  
maybe that's why I'm excited is cuz I have no 
idea maybe I should be nervous he's excited now  
but we'll see wow there's so many people I can 
see they're grilling something here yeah look  
how many people there are hello lanzones very 
good app cently is in here somewhere I see her  
hello how are you thank you nice to see you again 
nice to see you nice to see you welcome been a  
long time so are you ready to do our piure we are 
so ready we are so ready and hungry yes sa sa Sab
SAA M this place is famous for the C so it's aanu 
word for subba so that's grilled so it's there and  
then you have the uh Tua so that's the H soup 
so that's theola and then the uh kilow that's  
it's like a cetan so it's a raw fish different uh 
fish cooked in different ways so one is grilled  
one is the soup and one is like a ciche yes oh 
wow that's so exciting crew has told us that  
in this area there are actually different types 
of meals and they cook it in different ways on  
this side they're grilling something I think 
there's like a soup on the far side so we're  
going to try three different things in this one 
destination this is so exciting what is this Pro  
this is fish um yes so they are grilling all of 
this fish on this fire it's piping hot I was told  
that the available are going to be Marlin blue 
Mar fisha and then the T so that's their special  
te fish oh wow and it's been grilled right 
here in the open air fire I think that's the  
uh big one the big one on oh this one over here 
one that's the specialty different parts of the  
fish tast like a big chunk of fish yeah these 
are probably the biggest chunks of fish I have  
ever seen being grilled but it looks delicious 
and it's super fresh you can see here so this  
is your first meal of the day we don't usually 
have these thick slabs of chunky fish flesh that  
we eat I don't even want to know how big the fish 
is that is making this big piece of meat and they  
still have the skin on that just shows how fresh 
it is I just love the open air Grill the audio  
fish here which they grill for you and here is 
the street just to give you an idea of how it  
is and I think it's called anyhow but it's kind 
of like a barbecue of fish or pork or any kind  
of meat it always has a special flavor when it's 
Char grilled they're like grilled and seared to
Perfection oh that's tuna W look how big it 
is what do you recommend I recommend there's  
the this it's big though this one here this 
is ours wow and PR has just told us that you  
cannot order a small piece you have to order 
this entire chunk I'll leave it up to you  
whichever piece you think is is the best cuz 
you're here we might as well try the special  
specialty let's do it sounds good just standing 
next to this fire for a few minutes it is so hot  
how these guys are cooking all day every day 
in front of this fire is amazing you're good  
shap this is actually how we like to eat we 
love to grill our food on a hot fire okay now  
that we ordered the fish over there cre has now 
come in and she's ordering some here and then I  
think we're going to find a seat over here and 
then we're going to eat two or three dishes at  
the same time oh the secrets yes we tried that 
previously and then they have the fish yes okay  
so the fish is called rumpy rumpy that's the 
name of the fish yes Barracuda okay I'm sorry  
did she just say raw Barracuda that's what we're 
about to eat right now okay so let's try one okay  
okay well f is key the theme of today is go big 
or go home is proving that you like this yes ly
yes Bara
delicious now that we've ordered some raw 
Barracuda we then go to the next station it's  
just madness here so many people and then we're 
ordering the next dish which seems to be like a  
rice dish and look how many dishes they're serving 
so the first one is the regular uh green rice and  
then the second one will be the corn rice corn 
rice oh there's a soup over here for our third  
dish here this is a fish soup they've got the 
rice in a giant pot over there and then this huge  
cauldron over here where they're just serving out 
chunks of fish in a broth and then they just serve  
it straight like that with some rice so here has 
a broth big chunks of fish and then it goes out  
we're going to really need to bring our appetite 
today servings here so big how long does it sit in
here 30 minutes 30 30 minutes and it's going 
to be so and then it's sold out yeah and then  
they're going to cook another bch wow no ways wow 
oh my goodness I actually am getting to hold the  
biggest fish head I've ever seen in my entire life 
and you can still see the teeth this is what's in  
the broth look at these teeth look at those sharp 
teeth so is that what we eating yeah this is what  
we're eating I think we've done really well for 
our first stop you want to try the saet first yes  
first stop we're going to try the quila which 
you can see is these Cube sized pieces of fish  
it's a barracuda yes and it's raw so it's kind 
of like a ciche and it's mixed with some green  
tomato and some onion shave didn't tell me what 
we were eating today and this is why because this  
is super interesting raw Barracuda meat you want 
um you can just squeeze the lemon Theon yes and  
she's poured in all the vinegar this will make 
the fish uh cook o the vinegar it Cooks through  
the vinegar it actually started to change color 
it looks like it's turning almost uh purple you  
can tell this is fresh as fresh as it's going to 
get we haven't tried anything like this before  
okay here we go it's delicious it's not what 
I thought it doesn't have a strong flavor the  
meat is really hard it's a little bit chewy but 
when you're eating it it just dissolves in your  
mouth but it doesn't taste fishy the vinegar and 
the onion bring out the flavor of the fish it's  
sweet with the vinegar I could eat this whole 
Bowl I really like this this is the corn rice  
and it's actually quite sticky or more like mush 
together it actually tastes like um something we  
would have at home in South Africa Milli puff 
like Milli puff that's what it tastes like look  
at this so big it's so big that just shows you 
how long it's actually elongated this is the  
combo of the dipping camany the vinegar and the 
soy sauce together you got to have the dipping  
sauce that's true Filipino style I am trying the 
fish for the first time and it just looks like  
it has being grilled to Perfection look at this 
meat that is so well cooked so I'm going to dip  
it in the sauce all right try it without the 
sauce first okay I'm going to try it without  
the sauce first and then with the sauce wow 
oh that is delicious that's how fish should  
be cooked it's very well grilled so you got 
the CH grilled on the outside from it being  
on the barbecue and the grill tasty crispy skin 
on the outside and it's moist on the inside it's  
not dry super tender the meat just like falls 
off and it's so easy to just pick out a little  
piece let's give this a go M yes oh yes that is 
delicious they know how to do it right we've just  
finished eating our amazing dishes and to recap 
we had the grilled fish and then of course we had  
the raw Barracuda so now that we've eaten all of 
this with our corn rice crew is going to take us  
to our next stop hey thank you so our next spot 
after just leaving that Fresh Fish restaurant  
and now we're just going to walk straight down the 
road to our next part the thing when you're doing  
a food tour with someone like PR is she knows 
but also you have no idea what you've got in
store oh wow thank you what am
i o two mysterious bowls of food have just 
arrived and from looking at it you have no  
idea what it is well I have no idea what it is 
who and I know I'm so excited and they're giving  
me looks like something interesting yes it is 
very interesting I have absolutely no idea of  
what it is but it looks good though it looks good 
and it smells good which one do you recommend I  
have first um this one this one the plan is I'm 
going to try it first and then PR is going to tell  
me what it is a lot of the time when you're 
having a a delicacy or something unique the  
thought of it makes it way worse you're not 
giving anything away so while he's testing  
it we're just going to leave a little word over 
here so while he's eating it you guys will know  
what he's eating take two or three spoonful of 
that two or three I have no idea what this is  
is it meat is it jelly you're not allowed to like 
you know take a look like do something yeah you  
should just eat what's crazy is even trying to 
decipher what it is I have no idea you need to  
get this first yeah get all the stuff in oh oh 
that's that's the main thing you don't need to  
be nervous is this a good way to eat it through 
sure this is my first time trying whatever this
is it's tasty but kind of unique I don't know if 
it would be something I would order I think it's  
a meat these smaller pieces are really have a 
thick squishy texture and then this which Pro  
said is the main ingredient kind of just broke 
apart in my mouth so I'm not sure if that's a
meat your face what else is in there f is 
not saying anything he there's a bone in  
here I would mind eating this every day 
you would eat this every day I'm just  
going to pretend that it's something 
absolutely delicious maybe it is you  
haven't tried it yet how do I eat this PO 
the slimy gooey thing okay okayy one slimy
thing who's got us some of the meat which I have 
no idea what that is and then one of these slimy  
gooey jelly looking things don't play with it 
thank you Pro very good see I can eat everything  
yeah you see kind of like a rich tomato soup 
is the meat p no it's delicious I think not  
knowing what it is is so helpful cuz I just feel 
like I'm having some really good meats the slimy  
skin doesn't have its taste kind of like a jelly 
it just dissolves into your mouth I like it okay  
okay now it was very enjoyable watching Devon 
try them because he didn't know but now that  
I'm on the other side now I feel nervous but 
you did it so well like Dave took it Like A  
Champion but that's because I didn't know I know 
what these two dishes are but I don't know which  
one is which but I think I have an idea true 
made you taste this one first so I'm going to  
try this one first this is honestly making me 
feel even worse about it what did I just eat I  
was so focused on dev trying to enjoy it that I 
didn't think about the fact that I I still have  
to eat it and you have an idea so basically I've 
never seen you like this before he has a water  
eyes are tearing I'm laughing at myself because 
this is my idea wow knowing is worse than not  
knowing if I could describe it as grainy Deon 
is game for everything and he will eat it but  
my mind got to me a little bit and I think the 
texture got to me a little a little bit because  
I know what it is this thick chunky piece whatever 
that is definitely the thick chunky Parts would I  
eat this again I don't know I don't think so so 
this is dish number two I've got a little bit of  
the jelly and the meat and the sauce this one 
is like the last ex yeah and I felt like when  
Devon was eating it I knew you said you'd eat this 
every day so then I kind of figured out which was
which this look good the taste is like meat and 
soup taste and I think it's actually good for  
you yes like super healthy for you so now PR has 
joined me on the side of the table to uncover what  
we've just eaten so we got dish one and Dish two 
yeah let's start first start with this so This is  
called balbacua balaka so this is a beef stew with 
a collagen Rich uh beef part so that's why you can  
see the joints there the skin that's beef skin yes 
beef skin okay that's not too bad it's not too bad  
we don't normally eat beef skin though like cow 
skin okay and we don't eat collagen but collagen  
is actually very good for yeah collagen it's good 
for your skin yes that's why you eat this every  
day that's why your skin is no is the skin cooked 
in the soup yes oh wow it has been seamed for a  
very long time for a long time the second one are 
you ready I'm ready local name here in cibu it's  
called Low but uh this is known as soup number 
five and basically the you've just eaten the uh  
the Bulls the what the genital of the bull that 
I made you eat earlier what I was not expecting  
that W okay wait let me regroup the genitals of 
a bull yes I'm so glad you didn't tell me Po you  
still ate this and I knew what it was I knew what 
it was so all the parts of from different parts  
of the genital the is the most important as well 
as um different internal um like organs organs  
so at least it's uh in a small pieces you're not 
seeing it in its true form that is exotic proof  
we also consider this as a an exotic exotic cuz 
for me I've only tried it once oh only tried it  
once you don't eat this no very often okay I can't 
actually believe we we've tried this now we did  
well Pro well well done I think that could be my 
first and last time trying this how do you feel  
eating what you just ate I'm so glad it's over now 
I don't know if I'll have any more you can have  
the rest so now we can safely say that our exotic 
food list is getting longer and longer we've added  
a very big one to the list a very big one keple 
with your word choice how did you know it was a  
very big one I don't know I just assumed are we 
getting a taxi now PR oh we're getting a taxi oh I  
love how PR call a taxi so we're going to our next 
spot which crew has told us is a [Music] dessert  
we' have arrived at our next spot and we're right 
outside the door of the place it's literally like  
a hole in the wall and it looks adorable because 
everything is purple and PR told us this is like  
an U dessert place and that's why it's all purple 
so we're actually having something called Ube  
parado normally it's actually made of chocolate 
but they're putting a Ube spin on it this time and  
for some of our viewers that don't know what U is 
U is a purple vegetable that they use for so many  
dishes desserts drinks all throughout southeast 
Asia and it's absolutely delicious always sweet  
one of our favorite things it's hot CH is eat them 
during breakfast so this is a glutenous rice with  
uh milk sugar and then with uh U of course so all 
the flavors blend together so you said there's  
rice as well inside say goodness rice so that's 
amaz this is so hot the proper way to have it  
is to mix kind of um like gooey this would be 
the best porridge to eat I would say like this  
is Barney's breakfast it is so tasty and for some 
reason I can taste a bit of coconut but there's no  
coconut in here I like this a lot oh I could have 
this every day and look at this beautiful purple  
color this is better than the previous dish we had 
nothing big now that we've had some dessert thank
[Music]
you one more exotic thing to try but it is 
something that we have had before but now  
we're just trying an extra long version of it ooh 
what have we got here so these are different parts  
of the you have here I think this is Li look 
how long that is that is the intestine right  
there who's grabbing one wow look how long it is 
can I hold it yeah sure this is what we're about  
to try pork intestine and look how long it is and 
inside they've actually stuffed some spring onion  
you said inside the intestine for more flavor 
can I put this back is this your intestine this  
is a fat that is in the pig's butt area this is 
pig's butt fat is this a heart it's a pig heart  
yes oh wow then you have the uh pig's ears we got 
ears we got butt we got heart we got intestines  
all the delicious exotic things kind of crazy 
to go from eating some U dessert to this so he  
very finely chopped up the intestine that has 
that spring onion loaded on the inside and then  
immediately just through it in this giant walk 
where they're deep frying it and we're right  
on the street people are coming in taking like 
the tongs and just choosing which piece of meat  
that they want putting it in the deep fryer and 
then eating it it's like a Serve Yourself kind of  
like a buffet right on the street all the little 
intestine pieces have come to the top as they're  
frying they look ready and they're being served 
through right now they said we can go and sit  
it's ready this is pure Filipino style so we eat 
with our hands but we don't want them to be too  
dirty so we use our glove so we can just pick 
one of these up o they're still hot this is the  
intestine that we're about to enjoy this is our 
first time trying the pork intestine because we  
actually did try the chicken intestine before 
and the chicken one is Tiny and you can see  
it looks like a little ring on a stick so this 
is definitely a first for us you can see it's  
got a bit of a hard shell so we're just going to 
pick out one of these and then we're going to dip  
it in the onion and is that soy proof vinegar 
soy sauce and onions and onions you ready I'm  
ready for the first bite you go first go okay I 
got my little pork ring so you can really taste  
the spring onions right yes it's chewy I think it 
tastes more of like a fatty piece of chicken skin  
but it goes really well with the soy the vinegar 
and the onion yeah I would say the outer layer  
is like a crispy shell on the inside it's super 
chewy after we have eaten the intestine which  
wasn't too bad in fact I would probably eat quite 
a bit of that again it's one of those where your  
mind makes it a lot worse than it actually is 
and right now we're walking down the street to  
our final place and this is such an awesome 
way for us to see the city and experience it  
lots of people are coming to this part of the 
city there's a market over here hey hey hi hi
nice to meet you PR is taking us down all 
sorts of streets that we wouldn't normally  
go here in SAU City so I'm so glad that we have 
her we may have just found the most interesting  
and luxurious form of transportation here in 
the Philippines and for the next 24 hours we  
sleeping and singing and we're going to be 
giving you a full tour of this cruise ship  
plus the cost and show you exactly what it looks 
like welcome aboard and let's go to Manila so we  
are on the twoo maligaya cruise ship we are on 
the deck right now and we are already 12 hours  
into our journey we actually got on board last 
night and took off at 10: p.m. yes wow it's so
big pouring this rain very through and we have to 
carry our own bags all the way up this R is MOM  
stand by at the lobby and just wait to call your 
name your take this for check okay perfect when  
we got here last night it was pouring with rain 
but our first impressions of the ship were like  
wow and then I think they're going to escort 
us to our room so everybody else has gone to  
now which is madness so we're going to show you a 
full tour of the boat but this is kind of like an  
outside deck where everybody gets to watch all the 
beautiful islands that you can see behind me and  
we get to see so much almost a 360° view of the 
ocean the islands I hope this gives you an idea  
of just how big this app deck is we're kind of 
secluded to only this area we're unable to get to  
the stern of the boat as well as the bow but right 
here in the center we have this giant area that we  
can just spend some time in and as we're cruising 
we have the life boys over here we got the giant  
engine behind me this is hands down one of the 
coolest forms of transportation we've taken ever  
because there's so much to do and you get to slow 
travel your way through the Philippines I didn't  
know you could do this here in the Philippines 
please let me know in the comments ments below  
is technically the third floor for us cuz we 
only have access to three floors which is deck  
rooms are so I think that's the highest level 
of room how it works is there's kind of a main  
lobby that we walked into last night where all the 
shops are and then there's two staircases going up  
to the second and third level so we're going to 
make our way from the top all the way down we can  
go anywhere throughout the ship we can go on the 
Sund deck we can go at the bottom and throughout  
the ship there are lots of like relaxing areas 
there's some chairs to look out the window or  
there's some chairs on the Sund deck and now 
we're making our way to the second floor which  
I think is where the main sources of entertainment 
happen on this side you've got the island Fiesta  
Cafe this is where everybody is having some lunch 
now I can smell lots of really yummy things let's  
go see what they're making so this is kind of 
like a cafeteria area that everyone has their  
meals and on the ship all of our meals breakfast 
lunch and dinner are included plus the Horizon  
Cafe which we had breakfast earlier this morning 
we ordered the chicken with eggs and rice this  
morning and because we're in bus business class 
we get to be in the Horizon Lounge so it's kind  
of separated from the rest of the canteen there 
are beautiful views which we can look on the ocean  
the breakfast kind of consists of something very 
simple and of course coffee and then over here is  
the food station so they've got the cutlery over 
here they've got juice they've got some steamed  
boughs and then on that side they've got some 
fresh drinks and then over here we've got all  
the snacks plus cup noodles they even have some 
coffee some fruit shakes milk tea Oreo smoothies  
that looks absolutely unreal we're going to have 
to try that and they even have cake and brownies  
ooh we might have to try that as well I am so 
impressed and I think we're going to be saying  
that throughout this tour we're on a boat right 
now and look at this cafeteria this is also one  
of the areas that people just kind of hang out in 
and relax and last night they actually had some  
karaoke they had music playing so loud until 
midnight [Music] and moving along to outside  
the island Festa Cafe you actually have a viewing 
deck over here so people are sitting and they're  
enjoying the view as we go by and over here they 
even have a karaoke machine and it cost just 5  
peso per song they even have a little microphone 
this is so cool it's like a Olden style jukebox  
I think this is a smoothie bar so they're making 
all sorts of shakes Oreo smoothies juices bubble  
teas M that look so good overall I'm really 
impressed with the Togo travel team because  
everything has got like a pink theme everything 
is super fun super exciting super clean everything  
seems brand new food quality is really good so 
I'm really impressed so far and follow me to  
the business class Suites which is where we stay 
and our room is actually on the sixth floor but  
it kind of feels like we're on the second floor 
but we're in business class and our room is is  
down this Corridor this hallway is actually super 
quiet good morning to in a few minutes the offic  
Ander of the ship will be conducting an emergency 
drill we are merely conducting a drill again this  
is only the restrooms and showers are located on 
the outside of our room so we have a sink inside  
our room but we don't have a bathroom just a quick 
bathroom tour bathrooms are clean got everything  
you need the boys ones have a urinal toilet Basin 
but there is a shower room as well and the showers  
are nothing fancy but perfect for ownership there 
is hot water and it is a communial shower and now  
our room is right here we are in room 254 in 
business class so let's give you a full tour  
of what our room looks like and welcome to the 
business class Suite it's so cool cuz we have  
our own private room and it's actually much more 
spacious than what I thought we would get we've  
got a car Ed floor as soon as you walk in we've 
got our own sink and mirror which we actually used  
to get ready this morning with some ports if you 
have other buns that are not business class you  
don't get a sink you have to go to the communal 
bathroom which is right outside and on this side  
we've got a little cupboard with hangers and at 
the top we've got some life jackets over here  
we've got our couch but we're kind of using it 
as a a storage facility for all our luggage even  
though we only have two suitcases and this is all 
that we live out of it still feels like we've got  
too much stuff but if we do want to sit on the 
couch we can look at our lovely TV over here  
which we haven't used yet because there's so much 
stuff to do on this cruise ship we actually have a  
little table I think it's a table but we haven't 
figured out how to use it yet we've got working  
ports plus we've got a light we've also got some 
other lights on this side and the air conditioner  
which we can control over here and then moving on 
to the bedroom part of our suite we've each got a  
nice comfy bed which we did sleep in already and 
I must admit I slept very well normally I can't  
sleep on a moving vessel or train or plane but 
I had one of the best sleeps ever we have our  
linen pillows pillowcases and we actually rented 
blankets for 50 peso downstairs you get a little  
slippy that looks like this and then you can 
just return your blanket when you're done with  
it should I do a little bed test I mean they're 
pretty sturdy you're not going anywhere a biggest  
part is while you're sleeping you're not hearing 
any any noise you're not hearing any rocking or  
splashing or anything it's super super quiet so 
it enables you to have a good sleep and then right  
next to our bed we've got some more light switches 
which we can control right from our bed we even  
have an alarm we've got like a volume controller 
I don't know if we can control Maybe the sound of  
the speaker because we do get announcements in 
the room if I lie down we have some controllers  
under this light as well so we've got a port 
and we've got like a night light another perk  
of business class is we've got 1 2 three four 
ports and we don't have to use the charging  
ports outside even though they're only five peso 
we don't have to wait outside for our devices to  
charge of course we have some curtains which 
come in handy at night time and then we've got  
a gorgeous view of the outside we can look out we 
can see the beautiful view and there's all these  
cute little birds that are flying right outside 
our window but let's show you the rest of the
[Music] boat and now we're going to make our way  
to the fifth floor which is 
kind of of like our ground
level [Music] hell look at this it's like we're 
in a fancy hotel but we're actually cruising  
along the ocean we could literally be in any 
country right now they've got some fancy shops  
they've got charging stations a salon a clinic a 
prayer room how epic is this they even have a mini  
SE on the ship and they've got loads stuff they 
got plushies they've got water bottles his name  
is Shippy and he's even got the to go symbol on 
and if you buy one of him you get a free charger  
of your phone hello good morning and they've even 
got merch look at all the merch they've got shirts  
they've got water bottles umbrellas bags it's like 
we're in a shopping mall you can go shopping you  
can have Leisure Time probably the most popular 
thing on the entire ship is the charging station  
so for us because we're in business class we are 
lucky enough to have charging ports in our room  
as we said but most people have to stand at 
this very crowded charging station over here  
what's mindblowing is the charge is like 5 peso 
for 10 minutes I mean it's like for free but I  
think what happens is people charge and then they 
stay there and just keep using their phone it's  
the most popular thing on the ship which is so 
funny because we haven't had any connection for  
the entire trip because we're in the middle of the 
ocean so I don't even know what they're charging  
it for games maybe maybe are you from Sabu or 
Manila from Manila Laguna Laguna oh wow nice to  
meet you do you like the boat you don't like the 
boat see there's no Wi-Fi on the boat yeah and now  
this is the quick mod which is pretty much like 
the 7eleven here on the ship so we got everything  
snacks coffee sugar juice noodles body wash shower 
gel anything you can think of hair gel I have just  
seen that there's some disposable Andes as well 
just in case something happens on the ship just  
in case something happen just in case I may have 
you never know so now these are the tourist rooms  
which are a different level and we're going to 
hopefully try and get into one of the rooms to  
show you what it looks like on the inside a lot of 
the rooms on each level are down these corridors  
and you each have your own specific room thank 
you oh wow which is your room 49 49 okay can I  
see okay so these are the tourist rooms how many 
beds inside two go look this one bed hello can  
I see what the room looks like yes oh there's 
only one bed is it comfortable good thank you  
thanks for the room these guys are going to give 
us another room tour why does it smell fishy okay  
there's an Open Door let's see here's what a 
normal green value room looks like so you've  
got lots of bunk beds you've got life jackets and 
it's really sociable so this is a chance if you  
want to meet some friends this is how you can do 
it okay hello I think these rooms cost as little  
as 500 peso for the night with breest included 
I think if you're a Solo Traveler especially  
this would be so cool it's kind of like a hostile 
Vibe everybody's socializing together sitting on  
the beds they're watching movies they're chatting 
eating snacks where are you guys staying is this  
your room you down there it's a good room can we 
go see a tour let's go see these are our hosts for  
the day we're doing a we're getting a private tour 
private tour is this your bed is it comfortable  
thank for sh us thank you for showing us byebye 
absolutely perfect wow there's so many rooms on  
the ship and the deeper you go in you realize 
how big the ship is how many people are staying  
here there's more rooms down here oh wow this 
is business class oh so this is business class  
on the lower level and we're on the higher level 
I'm not sure what the difference is should I give
them thank you right now she W come back we're 
having a group picture right now taking a picture
hey I think for the next couple hours 
we're just going to relax enjoy the  
view see the islands go by and just take it all
in it has just gone evening and we see lots of 
ships around us and we can just see the lights  
of Manila we are almost there after a 24-hour 
journey and behind me we have been welcomed by  
the most beautiful sunset this has been such 
an incredible adventure and journey to go on  
it has been seamless the entire way through 
and we paid $3,600 pesos around $60 each for  
this trip which I think is definitely worth it 
because first of all you get a business class  
room you get the entire Journey as well you 
get accommodation for the night you get all  
your meals included and it's an adventure an 
activity that you're definitely paying [Music]
