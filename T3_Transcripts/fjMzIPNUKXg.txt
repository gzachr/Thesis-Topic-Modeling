 Good morning guys, welcome back to another video. Now it's not the start that we wanted here We are outside the Macassi Medical Centre because my leg is getting really bad It's infected, swollen and I need to get it so it's so hopefully they can show me out So I've got my prescription Really good the health centre is lovely The thing is they push off foreign they know that you're not going to know what the pharmacy Medicines are you're not going to know what the prices are and you're also not going to know what an earth you're taking When I went into the pharmacy she quoted me about 3000 pesos for 21 tablet and a cream which is like an antibiotic cream When I was a bit shocked at the price because you know I just spent 1500 for a consultation I asked if there was any cheaper she actually said yes And I managed to pay 900 pesos for the cream and the antibiotic she said they're exactly the same It's all about the brand so if you do come to some of the expenses do make sure that you are asking Because sometimes you might just find yourself paying more for the same thing But hopefully that's all sorted now and the main thing is one of his leg should be getting better Um always make sure you have your health insurance when you're traveling abroad Um obviously don't need it for this because it's only cost about 30 English pounds in total But if it is anything more severe you do need that health insurance Um I think they're with it very very well Uh we were in and out got seen too So half to half left and so about 15-30 minutes Yeah Hopefully it's still okay but I think you should probably get on with our day now Yeah that's crap on because we are going to head to the biggest mall in the Philippines And I can grab always grab lots of wraps over here and we are off to the SM mall of Aiyusha And we've been told to pick us more in Philippines so that makes me really excited So we've made it to the uh the mall of Aiyusha and you get here and it looks like you're arriving at air pool It's huge a lot of people have told us we will get lost in it We've already got lost in the smaller malls so we're just going to see how we get up So our initial fault is placed is absolutely huge I've done it where I'm going there's all different sections everywhere I think we're in like the clothing section now I might be wrong I was putting a top shop and I said because Molly was really brave of her leg I might treat her to a new top All right who can relate you tell them you'll buy them a t-shirt and then go to a completely different shop They're trying on four different t-shirts and think you're buying all four but having a clue which one they want to get So that was a success we went into H&M and Matt bought me a lovely t-shirt Little white t-shirt off the shoulder perfect when it's humid at night Um and I managed to buy myself a plain white t-shirt They're the sort of face of the essentials that I need here because once you've been sweaty and warm sun cream White just goes at a very off color So I'm very happy with that now I think we're going to try and locate lots of other stuff because It's so big and I think we've just done one loop because we're back at the beginning again So we need to try and find where everything else is You It's just so so fast we're now like walking through a walkway there I think it leads to the department store here I don't know where I'm going we're just getting lost but it is huge But do you think this area is about where the hairdressers are? I've been recommended to try out Bruno's some of the hairdarks so I don't know there's a toning guy there David salon I don't know so hopefully it's along the area and get a trip You And we are done Another very very good haircut in the Philippines Good recommendation Thank you to everyone that said Bruno's It's a little bit expensive for the Philippines I know I know you can get it for a lot cheaper But for like the level of service and the quality in there you can't really go wrong We're literally so so fast we're now outside again Near the what is it only the seaside Sea side boulevard bit right out of the sign A big more leverage of sign but it's lovely you overlook The ocean here But it's crazy it's just so so big We're trying to locate the food call I don't even know if we're ready to attempt the food call because it's just going to be so many different restaurants So How good was that sunset though we're back from the Mall of Asia now we should rather pull through a little bit Got a little bit of a tan quite a little bit of curly hair We're loving it. We're up on our anecdote rooftop bar It is the only jellyfish bar in the world Maybe the Philippines but we are going to go back to the room and chill out for a bit We're going to come out and make sunset and show you that And then we'll show you the bar properly a little bit later Back in the room now I've got my new top arm Thanks to Matt really really comfy We're both so tired but we are going to make an effort and we're going to go up stairs to our rooftop bar Yeah you see a little bit of it earlier We've got to show you it properly um I think it's just going to be like a little b-roll thing So I'm going to wrap it up a little bit early We'll show you it but I can't wait to talk tonight I'm going to enjoy our last few drinks in Manila with a long Manila so much It's surprised us Lones like proper surprise last but if you're new to the channel We're off to a new island tomorrow so hit that subscribe drop us a like I'm cute, bon d'avilene to
