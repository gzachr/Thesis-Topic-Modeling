Video is going to be a little bit different. You know, as you may or may not know, we are full-time travel vloggers and we make travel videos from around the world. My name is Abel Avinit. My name is Martin. And together we are part-time. A few days ago, I published Tagalog only vlog. You guys really enjoyed it. I thought it was hard. It's not easy to understand Tagalog, but it was fun. It was 24 hours of teaching. So today, you decided to step it up a notch? Yes. Are you ready? Speaking Tagalog tongue twisters. Why? I gathered up some Tagalog tongue twisters from the easiest to the hardest. So tongue twisters, what do you mean by that? Tongue twisters is like seashell seashells by the sea short. Meaning? It's like... You don't know? You don't know? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. You know, no tongue twisters? No. You never had that before. Words come up together in one sentence that are hard to pronounce when they're combined together. It's a very bad one. Okay. So I'm not a teacher. You're saying it's a sentence and not necessarily a word? Yeah, it's a sentence. Oh, yeah. This is not just a simple speaking Tagalog tongue twister vlog. I have a prize for you. If you do... Say it correctly. Okay. What's the prize? Whoa! This is your favorite. I'm really big time. Bring it. Not just this, but we also have... Cookie! Yes, this is our cookies. Some are everyhing because... I want to taste it. What about me? No. So everything I say correctly, I get a reward. It's not how it works. This is a speaking Tagalog tongue twisters with a twist. With an extra twist. Yeah. If you say it incorrectly... What happens? What happens? Well, you have to remove your shirt. Why? Just remove it. Okay. So the shirt is off. Why is the shirt off? Every time you say that Tagalog tongue twisters incorrectly... I need to clap one of your shoes. No, no, no, no, no. It's cute, but... It's gonna be fun for you. It's gonna be fun. It's gonna take it easy for you. We have some level of difficulties here. This one is the basic one. First, Tagalog tongue twister. Baba, baba, baba. Baba, baba, baba. See? It's so easy. You can't say it correctly. Okay, like I said, we have a key. Which one is first? Spring. Spring. Spring is my favorite. Baba, baba, baba. What is baba, baba, baba? Okay. Two spring ends. Will it descend? It's like, for example, you want to read the elevator in a hotel or a month. You're gonna ask, Baba, baba. Baba, baba. You have to have that tone, because it's like a question mark. Baba, baba. And then I will say, Baba, baba. Tagalog tongue twister number two. girlkong kong kong kong babygula. I wish it was three times perfect. As a你好, may it prevent stumbled ...
