Few days ago, I published a Tagalog only vlog.
You guys really enjoyed it. I thought it was hard.
It's not easy to understand Tagalog.
But it was fun. It was 24 hours of teaching.
So today, you decided to step it up a notch.
Yes. Are you ready?
Speaking Tagalog tongue twisters.
Why?
I gathered up some Tagalog tongue twisters.
From the easiest to the hardest.
So tongue twisters, what do you mean by that?
Tongue twisters is like seashells by the seashore.
Meaning?
It's like...
Your tongue twister.
You know tongue twisters?
No.
You never had that before.
Words come up together in one sentence that are hard to pronounce.
When they're combined together.
Something like that.
I'm not a teacher.
You're saying it's a sentence and not necessarily a word.
Yeah, it's a sentence.
This is not just a simple speaking Tagalog tongue twister vlog.
I have a prize for you if you say it correctly.
Okay. What's the prize?
Yes!
Your favorite.
I'm really big fan of Pringles.
Not just this, but we also have...
Cookies!
Yes, these are cookies from our Airbnb host.
I wanna taste it.
What about me?
No.
So everything I say correctly, I get a reward.
Is that a reward?
This is speaking Tagalog tongue twisters with a twist.
With an extra twist.
If you say it incorrectly...
What happens?
What happens?
Well, you have to remove your shirt.
Why?
Just remove it.
Okay, so the shirt is off.
Why is the shirt off?
Every time you say the Tagalog tongue twisters incorrectly,
I need to pluck one of your kiri-kiri hairs.
No, no, no.
It's gonna be fun.
It's gonna be fun for you.
It's gonna be fun.
I'm gonna take it easy for you.
We have some level of difficulties here.

You said it correctly.
I like this game.
Which one is first?
Pringles.
It's Pringles.
Pringles is my favorite.
Okay.
Two Pringles.
Will it descend?
For example, you want to ride the elevator in a hotel or a mall.
I'm gonna ask...
You have to have that tone because it's like a question mark tone.
And then I will say...
