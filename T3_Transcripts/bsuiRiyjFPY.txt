 Hi, welcome. We're gonna go to the beach I think. We tried to go last week but then our motorcycle went flat. We took this motorcycle to get fixed twice yesterday because of a flat tire. It's flat again. Oh, we did it. And now, there are bunch of baby kittens. Scratching. They have a little playground. And mom. And then, and then there's the dad. He's hanging out away from everybody else. So yeah, we have a little cat badly. I'm not a black one, but I'm almost. You do? I thought that one was a... to see. Gosh, captured. Hi, baby. We're gonna go to, I think we're gonna go to Jollybee, get some breakfast, and then Spencer wants to get his haircut. It's for kittens. Brickedies. Spencer's favorite food. I've been since I was a kid. I've always been for all my life. What do you think of your new haircut? The sand just sure took the sides. And it's shorter on the top as well. You had a very like, it was very like, like, like, like, like, like, or what like, before. Little bit shorter, little bit cleaner around the sides in the back. Looks like a person. Yeah, looks good. Looks human. When did you get that? When did you get that? I'm the kind man who sells it. Who's this? I don't know. What's his name? Walter Mellon and Walter Mellon Man right there. This is my favorite stuff. I first had this one we were in Shargau. I guess a little bit after we got here. Very, very yummy. There was a place called Barkley. It had a muclinic. I think that's funny. They met at that night too. I did that on purpose. Barkley and Mell. Woo! Oh! Okay, so one thing I've noticed about the Philippines. Cactus here? Cactus is our insane. So I'm from a place that's like, it doesn't. I've never seen a cactus like, they're, they're huge. Not only are they huge, they have leaves. They freak out, grow up and go leaves. Yeah, I think that's crazy. They broke it down, they cut it off. Like how am I going to, uh, with the car up? So this is our land. It's very big. It's what? Like how? Is this where your dad wants to build that hotel? Yeah. Oh, big area. Hi, cow. Devil. You can go. It seems my mother died. Rest in peace. This used to be a nice garden. It used to be a trampoline. That's what's the liver of it. It's hard. Everything is just broken down. I mean, however, I got one thing to do. The land for a hotelry strain of diversity. Yeah. Yeah, my grandma's beach, my cousins and my aunties are managing this. Is the, uh, keep cut to just that they build. So many people. That's why they have a new car. Oh, yeah. Uh, it seems like they're doing pretty well here. It's nice. It's cute. I always have been imagined having sales every day. How fun would it be to work somewhere like this? My great grandfather, oh no, my grandfather. Well, my great, my great, great grandfather swept all the, a cleared all the land, measured it and submitted it to the, to the city hall during land, the land reforms because the country just had its independence. So they were able to pick up the land and submit to the city hall and get a title. So he worked hard. Then my, yeah, great grandmother inherited it. And then my grandfather, great grandfather, married the owner of this land and became theirs. My grandpa, this was his inheritance. He went gambling, I think, with cock fights. He lost. I think he had a jet, jet ski in place of this. The thing my grandpa's brother, my grand uncle, he bought it from him, and from the guy who won this. That's why it's not ours anymore. It's my cousins. So. We're going to feed the monkeys. So we are back in the car because we got a little bit bored at the beach and they decided to go to where are we? In Ita, liberty had protected landscape and seascape. So it's closed by our beach and there's monkeys here. Focus on the background, right? Kind of chucks. It's about the scenery and then also in here. We found a little walkway down, a little staircase down. So we're going to go down here. So pretty. Look. Pretty. So we're taking photos all throughout this process. And we took some photos at the boat and now I want to go into this little cave. It's over, it's covered. I need all the shells. I need all the shells. Shells may even. I need all the shells. You can eat the. What do you think? I love it. Love it. I recommend it to a friend. Everyone. Everyone come here, take a look at the ocean, take some pictures. We're really, really pretty scenery to take pictures with. And then maybe you'll see the occasional monkeys. So that's a plastic. 40 cents for 30 cents for locals, two bucks for foreigners. Shh. So where are we going now? We're going to go to the parish in the town center to grab my family history. Look at that thing. That's freaking cool. It's a very pretty building and I definitely was not expecting that. This honestly kind of puts all of the churches in the city to shame. Let's go. Hi, guys. Hi, guys. Hi, guys. Lisa.
