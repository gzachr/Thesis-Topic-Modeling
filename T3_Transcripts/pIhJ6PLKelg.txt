We're headed to a place that I heard
about long before my first trip to the Philippines.
And we're off!
A location with such beauty to
become one of the world's
top destinations for relaxation.
On top of that were headed here to ring in the New Year.
This place is the tropical island of
Boracay!
We traveled with a large group of friends and family after leaving Moalboal.
As a Christmas present, we invited my
wife Joann's parents to join us on the trip.
Boracay, boracay!
Yeah, we bought a pass on the plane for 400 pesos for Southwest.
To get there a plane, a bus, a boat and a taxi we're all required before we reached our hotel.
It sounds difficult, but they actually have
it pretty dialed in.
Okay we made it to Boracay. Now we're
switching to a cab to the hotel.
Then we can kick back and relax.
Not a bad view.
Boracay! New Years 2016!
Then we met my relative
Louella who lives here.
Hi, I'm Louella.
She gave us the local lowdown before we
set off on our three-day visit to Boracay.
Now we're headed out to walk around Boracay.
Here are some highlights from our
experience.
First, we visited the Luho view deck
which is the highest peak in Boracay.
Okay, we're going ziplining now.
Let's see how
this goes this is my first time.
And here's the route
Going zipline baby! Wow!
Dong.
Okay, maam. Yes, let's go!
Wow!
Wow!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Very cool!
We made it! You must try this! So fun!
Then we checked out Puka Beach.
Alright, we haven't eaten at all today.
So we're grabbing some Filipino barbecue.
We're going with the whole group to Willis Rock.
This is one of the most famous views in Boracay and landmarks or watermarks.
But it just kind of gives you a nice little taste of the paradise that Boracay is.
Okay we're headed to the D mall now we
just came from Willis Rock.
So this is the D Mall in Boracay and basically they have everything here.
It's where all the tourists are. Pretty much all different types of restaurants, bars,
shopping everything it's a real nice
outdoor mall here in Boracay.
Yeah, it's a nice place to get out kind
of get some good food and enjoy what
Boracay has to offer.
Another amazing sunset here in Boracay.
We're racing off to a bar called the Spider House.
To check out the sunset.
So, here we go.
Okay, we just arrived at the Spider House.
It's sick.
You're welcome.
This is what happens to you in New Years in Boracay.
For dinner, we picked out fresh seafood
at a local fish market.
Then we brought this to a restaurant in
the area to cook it for us.
Finally, we had a chance to check out the
nightlife.
We became regulars each night at the Red Pirates Bar
A few friends in our group went on a pub
crawl.
Oh yeah, we were also here for New Year's
Eve
We raced off from the hotel to catch the
fireworks.
Five,
four,
three,
two,
one...
Wow!!!
Happy New Year!!
Oh, there just revving their engines?
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.
Wow!
Happy New Year!
HomeTube!
Happy New Year!
Happy New Year!
Happy 2016 Mama!
We had an excellent time in Boracay and I highly recommend it!
We didn't want to go but we had to start
making our way back
for our long journey home.
