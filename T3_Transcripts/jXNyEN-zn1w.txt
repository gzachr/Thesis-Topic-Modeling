 Do you believe as a western foreigner that I asked Afin Dufina know how to control my own money Even money I received to my foreigner husband Well keep watching and let's find Well, that's there was a really a pertinent question and I think it's a question that needs answering And especially in reference to you, I think we need to Sort this out so it doesn't keep coming up time and time again where the you know people keep on saying that perhaps You in it for the wrong motives. It's all about money and So if we look at Expenses and my experience with dating a Filipina i.e. Grace over the last you know You're not half and Eight months before that I Don't see any of that is no scamming involved No issues about money. So we're gonna look into that and I'd like to actually share something that I think will be very valuable for with us and Just to show the contrast to the way we in our culture view giving and asking compared to the way the Filipinos Ask for things and give things. Yeah, so maybe we can delve into that But right from the outset I must say that yes scamming is a big issue and It's understandable because it's probably easy to be done for a Filipino woman in the Philippines who Has this basically ATM machine Because this person really wants her And this person's in America And he just wants to please her so he keeps ascending money money money money So you can understand that it's gonna be very difficult and very tempting For any Filipino woman and not to just accept What has been sent to her. Yeah And so that actually brings me to the point that really the onus of giving Is really on the person who's providing that money So if he's giving and he gets scammed well You know, I don't think he can really blame The Philippines. Yeah, he can't blame the Filipina Um Because he's the one that allowed us to happen So the way the reason why I'm saying this is because there has to always be some checks and balances When you give some bodies Something like money for instance, especially somebody you've never met. Yeah, you've only spoken to them on what's up And of course you can develop very close relationships on what's up. Yeah on You know social media very quickly. So I understand how people do say well, I do know I met her we spoke for hours and hours and you know, she's wonderful. She'll never do this to me But the the point is unless you've actually met her and spent time with her And her family and see what pressures because it's not always her That's behind Getting all this money or asking for this money. Yeah, it's it's probably the pressure that she's feeling from other people Yeah, would you say that? What do you think some of the pressures are when when people are told that they are what this Foreigner person and he keeps sending her lots of money. What do you think? The advice would be That she would be receiving from other Filipinas. Yeah, you know as a Filipina. I had many pressure that I faced before Um, I'm flying here to be with my husband that time was um, we have merit and You know, I need to wait my visa Then after that If my visa come and I and I receive Then we can go back here and South Africa with me as well But the pressure is some of them they advise You have you get a foreigner husband now so you can feel a new house Help to your parents and your siblings or You have a foreigner husband now you can buy a you know a brand new car or even even Special or delicious food, but you know that that pressure that I faced before I never I never listen that or affect to me Because you know Um money can buy happiness, you know What happened if if you follow what they they advise to you Then you know it's not it's not it's not easy to To sometimes not easy to overcome that pressure that you had every day different people Yeah, so that's the point they get pressurized So you might find this this gorgeous person And she's doing crazy things and you think it's her, you know, you blame her But actually in the background, it's other people pressurizing her And you know, they tend to to follow You know because these people in other ways and other parts of their lives Um help them so they just follow that advice sometimes Um But I Would once again to say you know, you have to look at the psyche of of the Philippines and other people think there and I'm just saying this is what I think And I'm actually relating it quite closely To the way African people think Yeah in Africa and I've grown up with this and you know This is something that they've bothered me for years and years and years And it's something that I only actually found out or figured out about 10 years ago So most of my life I was struggling with this and the point is it's it's like the Philippines Yeah African people will see you they will think that because you are white or you're foreign or whatever That you've got money And that just gives them a license to do something and that is to ask So I've grown up my whole life where I've been asked for things all the time You know if they see you in a car they want the car You know, they'll ask you for anything anything in the car. They'll ask for that They want food they they want money. Yeah, they want a lift. They would they they want a fridge Uh, they want a holiday Whatever they just ask Now in our culture in in in a European culture We would never ever ask Somebody that we don't know All right for something You know, we have to build up a very strong relationship with somebody before we even asked them for a simple thing And even when we ask them for that simple thing We usually make sure that there's a win-win situation where they giving it to you But you know in some way or form they're going to benefit It's not just a case like in the Philippines. I've been asked for a car actually I've been asked for a motorbike. I've already been asked for a mobile And you know my rebuttal to these things was Then when I was asked because obviously I'm trying to keep relationships nice within the family within people that grace No, so I would say things like I don't even have a car myself Driving my dad's old car. I don't have a mother. I want him other So I don't even have a mother I And I said well, I've got I did actually have My old phone and I offered him my old phone And the guy turned around and he said no, no, I want to new phone So obviously he didn't even get that old phone. So my point is They've got a similar kind of thinking That as long as they ask you know eventually somebody is going to give it give them what they asking for But the actual catch to all of this I You know because obviously you feel bad when somebody asks you for stuff and you can't give it to Because can you imagine if I gave it that guy a car and I gave him a motorbike and I gave this one out You know you we would have nothing All right, so you can't do it. It's just plain and some point You know we kind of forward that But you still feel bad and it kind of affects our relationship How we've on their side There's none of that and this came to the fore. I want to just tell you a little story It's back when I was not deep in the jungles in in Africa and There was a person that was hurt now. He was Basically working on a on a government building And I was there and I was actually providing the materials For that building just as part of a You know community helping our donation and this guy was was building on this roof. Yeah, and While he was nailing the last sheet on the roof. Yeah He actually fell through the roof Okay, and by some miracle he he actually just missed some very sharp corners and whatever But the fact is he did come through the roof and he landed on the ground Now You know we were all shocked and we helped him out and he came back to work the next day and he carried on working So we thought okay, we we're very lucky, you know, he's okay But then like three days later I get this message that he's paralyzed He's totally paralyzed And the family are basically holding me accountable because I donated materials So I got hold of the police and I said well, we need to go and investigate this you know because you know I think I want to resolve community coming looking on my So I got hold of like the top-piece guys and they came with me and I drove them out in my vehicle It was like 50k's on the dirt road And eventually that dirt road turned out to be a very bad road and eventually it became a thick sand road And the car just couldn't go any further Yeah So anyway, so we decided we get we're gonna have to walk the last three or four kilometers We're gonna have to walk and was so hot But I was walking with these policemen To find this village with this guy was paralyzed so that we could get him to the hospital and we could do a proper Prognosis of what the problem was And really to sue that relationships within the community Yeah But on the way I was thinking my head you know because I was hoping to drive my truck all the way there and pick him up and drive out but obviously We stuck and now we got three kilometers to walk And while we walk here, I'm just saying to the guy we need to somehow organize transport Because how are we going to lift this paralyzed person And just by Spiluck The bush came this donkey car Actually was an ox wagon Yeah I had an ox actually had two oxen and it had a nice back And I thought oh great what we do we just come and deal this Ox wagon Yeah And we go and pick up this guy We blame in the back of this thing and we take him back to the car we can get him to the hospital Yeah Anyway what happened was the policeman said okay he they'll speak to the guy Yeah They spoke to this guy and they were like talking talking talking talking I just thought they were going to come at you and say let's go yeah We're taking your car We're taking your car After about 20 minutes they came back to me and they said okay listen yeah we've sorted it out And they continue to walk and I said whoa whoa Yeah Are we not commandeering this This Ox cart We need it Yeah They said no no no no no no don't worry about it We've spoken to the person And we've explained everything that this person's paralyzed and he needs our help But this person said no they don't want to help him They know him and they don't want to help him And so I said so is that it? Can't we just commandeer it take it They said no no no no we can't do that he said no And that that is when the penny dropped I mean not even a policeman but you know the top-charged guy Can get a little peasant guy To you know go against his saying no yeah And he was willing to just continue on and look for another make another plan yeah Now that's when I realized this is how these people work Okay, and I've been viewing it wrong you know all along I've been feeling bad when I said no yeah But actually That's not a problem if a guy says no Even if in a serious situation where somebody is dying and you know he's getting paralyzed No, no and you can't take my stuff yeah and they move on and this policeman didn't think anything of it As it turned out I'm amazed what just finished the story as it turned out we walked the other three kilometers We didn't see anybody else And when we got there we found the guy and he was like sitting When he saw us he'd like ran away and then when we got to the cut He was like lying on the bed like half-dying And so We looked around and there was nothing except a wheelbarrow So the policeman said put him in the wheelbarrow yeah and Get his brother to push the wheelbarrow now And that's what happened the British latest guy so you was like lying Like I did in this wheelbarrow and his brother was pushing this wheelbarrow and me and the other two please spend the walking back I promise you he hadn't even gone like 13 meters in this wheelbarrow and all of a sudden by some miracle this guy could walk He was walking and he was fine and he was okay and nothing's no problem. Don't worry. He's okay Because he knew he was not going to be able to sit in that wheelbarrow for three or four kilometers And he also didn't want to go 100 kilometers to the hospital and get caught up with all of that and So nothing ever came of that because you know by some miracle he was but the point I'm getting to is When black people or when Filipinos asked for something It's just asking They just hoping yeah, you know They don't even have their relationship with you to ask They don't even really believe that you're going to give it to them They just asking because there's a chance. There's a small chance In fact, similar to that place in Africa There's a guy that whenever I go there he always asks before one dollar Yeah, and you'll say okay, I'm only asking for this one dollar In today and I won't ask again and you know you caught me because I did give him the dollar the first time But then like 20 minutes later he sees me again Another dollar and I said I'm just giving you a dollar you say you know that said Yeah, but that's he'll always just ask is just in their makeup. They'll just ask ask ask ask ask So you've got to learn from it and don't take it personally if they're asking for stuff you don't have to give it to them It's purely just asking yeah, and therefore I find it difficult you know if you know this How can you get scared? Because you are then giving it to them because you want to give it to them. Yeah So How they take the money and spend I've witnessed this with us When I met Grace, she didn't have any paperwork Right and to obviously get married she needed all these certificates So obviously the money that I was sending was to get the certificates Now I didn't just give a 500,000 pesos and say Organize your passport. No, I said how much is the first certificate? And she would say to me it's 800 pesos And then Not give us a must they will where is the place house the place how far and then I'd work it out in my mind Okay, it's 800 for the for the certificate. She has to drive three hours You know can she be then back in a day? Yes, she can what is the bus does somebody must go with her for protection? Yes, and then I'd work it out so I said okay In this case I need to give you three or four thousand pesos for you to go and get that document And then she would spend the money and she would get the document and once she's got that document She'll get the next document and the same process. So I wasn't just sending money Willy nanny. I mean Grace was also working. I mean and that's also important, you know Is the person that you wanted to date or marry? No, that's that she worked So that's a good thing. So that's that's something we wanted to share with you about the Sykes If you understand how they are And also how they don't hold it against you when you say no and therefore you don't have to feel bad to say no All right, it's not like an art culture You know, we have to pull up a lot of time and relationship before you ask somebody for something And then if that person rejects you you feel bad and all that. No, no, it's nothing like that I think with the filipina culture Yeah, it's just like a water off a duck's back And it's over and obviously, you know, if you if you love the person And you get you dating her so like any Date that you have in the western world You aren't buying her a few things, you know, yeah But let's just talk about um the money that I did see because obviously there were times when I said you more money than what you actually was spending All right, and I told you take that and please go buy yourself something nice. So what did you do with that money? Firstly, you know That the day That day I told to my husband Jonathan that I don't have any paper Documents before we going to Manila to apply my visa. So I told to him I need a passport first You know, it was really needed for airport especially in visa So we talking together and we discussing how to work that to get that passport to mine And then that the day that day same day She he sent me a money I know how much is this and then after that that money that ever Not every day that every minute that Jonathan sent me To send me a money Where I needed you know, even um if I run run out of my Money that I need to pay my my documents my paperwork before Jonathan come in Philippines So not not not all of that money that I from him I spent you know rubbish rubbish things That actually I don't need really needed I spent a money from him that I really needed and use this so That that that day Um, I took my dad to go to my paperwork, you know like passport and NBI Polish clearance x-ray And all of that whatever what I need to complete my requirements So Even I want to something to buy like like clothes or foods I can I can't have it I can I can buy like that expensive, you know expensive things because I really actually think That I need to first finish and then my paperwork before by you know what I needed Yeah, all right, and yeah, so so like there was transporting ball like she said you had to take a no dad and so There were lots of expenses, all right, so There wasn't really I mean there was a little bit extra money, but you you are now when when I got there she had actually saved the money So it's quite funny. She she could have spent it. I spent I no I saved that money Because Jonathan you run a van to pick him in airport And that night When we go home I asked him If he's already eaten so I brought the food to him for in case if she gets hungry And then that money that I left For in case to another requirements again, so I can have Um, give it to him to add that that requirements that um expenses That's actually you know Not like other woman in the in our country, you know if they married a foreigner Um, maybe they think Uh, I had a foreigner husband or so I can buy anything what I want Not not like me I saved a money and I buy whatever I needed In the requirements I told you guys not not um Warning huh warning guys. I know I married a foreigner But both of us is not rich We rich in love okay, we rich in love We respect and we respect each other we commute we communication each other Not uh because I married a foreigner because he is rich because mom and dad my my family forced me to marry this old This old man is not old for me is is is a handsome handsome husband I got and I'm luckily that I have heave, you know, even is not he's not rich But he's rich in love and respect and cares, you know Yeah, so obviously There's different kind of You know for for some people just having a house would be you just rich Okay, so there's different levels and it's a hard thing to kind of equate what is rich and what's not rich But you know at the same time I just noticed with living with grace like for instance we we went shopping this morning to get some groceries And you met some of your Filipina friends. Yeah, and they were the same They really just scout out for bargains. They're very good at that Um, they see something uh, I mean we've been to the mall and she sees a nice dress And she's a lovely dress which was just normal to say the nonsense. Yeah, have a look at it No, no, no, look at the price. It's crazy. I said no, and I once dragged the end to the shop and I bought it But I'll never do that again because she you know, she's got a really upset To be that and you hardly ever wear that dress, you know because I don't know she's just So what I do now is like she's like she's got this thing and she goes back to the Philippines She's gonna fill up her boots with the clothing and so on because it's so much cheaper and so nice Whatever But the point is she doesn't abuse what we do have and and that's that's very important if you're gonna marry somebody You've got that trust that You're never gonna go into debt because she's gone and maxed out your credit card or whatever No, no, I don't I don't think Filipinos actually do that. They the ones I've known they they very What's the word? They know the value of money and they and they don't like spending For stuff that's expensive if it's good value they'll buy it and that Talking about groceries talking about everything Yeah, they'll buy stuff that's and I even have to say to some of the stuff is Pay a little bit more for the vegetables or whatever Because to me that's like instead of buying medicine I'd rather pay a little more and get good food And that becomes my medicine So you know, I'm happy to get that into her little mindset. It's known. Just go for the cheapest Even vegetables or food, you know pay a little bit more. Yeah, because at the end of the day You're saving because you're not having to go to the doctors And you're eating good stuff and it's good for your body All right, so I think I put everything to rest that yeah, we Do not have the experience that foreigners Sorry that Filipinos do not understand finances and Would take this foreign spouses money I think some might And they obviously all obviously in any society is some criminals So you gotta be careful But like I said, it's it's a two-way system somebody actually has to give them money So you give you the money and not got those checks and balances in place You cannot blame the Filipina and also look at her Fam, you know what what's your influence like Like I was very fortunate that that grace came from a family which they were still parents And I obviously spoke to the parents understood that parents were held in high regard And you know they were really good people So there wasn't gonna be bad influences when grace talks about there was Infrains as I know it's come from it wasn't from her family. It was immediate family It was from outside people that were in a way they just just psyching up really saying oh you can do this you can do that you can do this um But grace realizes now these limited funds she has to budget everything And that's how life is that's how you've got to work at it. Yeah, no matter where you live in the world with that's US UK South Africa or in the Philippines you've got to live to your means All right, okay guys I just had something oh you want to add something even in our culture I'm suffering the Filipina you know when we're going to shopping mall to buy our grocery We need to think about it what we need in inside the house now as Everyday and not every day every weekend we go to our shopping dollar shopping To buy grocery I need to put you know what I what we needed inside the house what kind of food Or what what the cheapest are expensive if expensive I don't want to take But When we go this upon the things When we go to shopping mall if I saw a beautiful dress That Jonathan I told to him that this is a nice dress This is a you know shoes or bags, but if I saw that expensive I just keep quiet quickly Because I don't want to you know, I spent lots of money to buy Not important things for me Maybe in our culture especially Jonathan been there that March we had best about we can spend I think expensive Things like 100 pesos or 150 that's it that expensive for us you know us a culture in our culture as a Filipina So If we go back there I rather to spend a 15 pesos or shoes or 10 pesos of short It's a second hand it's bargain not like here, you know So expensive for me So I'm sure opera's guys and I do not want anybody to wear Second-hand shoes because there's fungi there's all kinds of things so We will still me and Grace are still up and arms about this particular point But at the end of the day, I know what she's trying to say and and it's a valid point She wants things that have value to them So we really careful how to Spend and control our money, you know Every time I want this we want this we buy this no As a Filipino how I know how to save it because I learned this to my mom how to save it a money, you know Because you know, it's not easy to To Find a Money, you know, you need to work hard put working hard before you get money So advise you Don't spend lots of money and buy Not important things or expensive things Okay, so that that kind of clears that up and I think she's also cleared up the other points is that you know This story about you got to go to the Philippines you got to pull their house and No, no, no, there's none of that I'm not saying that we won't go to the Philippines one day. I'm not saying that we might fall in love with it But like I've even said to her, you know, I mean I've bought many houses Yes, you know I tell you that I bought but I if I was going to the Philippines I just bought one of those local bamboo houses bamboo house. Yeah, so I'd probably just do something like that something Something that's a lot Because you know, it's not hot too hot there. So you need something light and you know You know she wants to bring her parents in that would be fine But I'm not promising anything like that. So that's why I say to a list on discuss anything like that Yeah, so we've been in the Philippines. We've been able to live there for a year or so And then we make those kind of big decisions, but right now we stay here. We do our ministry We do the work that we're doing and If things change Then then we will change to but obviously we want to do some traveling and we want to take people with us You know when you got a cape down I'm gonna show grace that and obviously show yourselves that the garden roots beautiful places Kruger Park big national park. So there's lots of things we want to do here now first Yeah, but anyway, we're coming to the end of the year so we We're gonna close this off now and Don't forget to like again and subscribe Share and if you want something to us about our blog our like An hour loves them.
