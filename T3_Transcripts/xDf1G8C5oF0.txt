 tips whether you're visiting or living the Philippines, it'll make your life easier. Low-paced life, Filipinos really value their leisure time compared to other countries. It's as if rest and relaxation is a must add-on to one's daily activities. Much like the lifestyle in Hawaii if you've ever visited Hawaii. This leads to the concept of Filipino time where appointments and meetings or dinners will often start later than scheduled, often blamed on traffic. For example, I've had 630 dinner invitations where I've arrived at 630 and no one's there. At one recently, people came at 7 and the one that brought the appetizer showed up at 730. But everyone just smiles, enjoys their wine, their tandoi, their red horse, and enjoy the company, and everything's good. It's Filipino time. Life in the Philippines is great. I hope you come and enjoy it. It's the Philippines. Stop wasting your time online. Come and visit. And if you haven't done it yet, please subscribe.
