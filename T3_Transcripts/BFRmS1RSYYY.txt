 The top 10 most prestigious and expensive schools in the Philippines. It's like a Harry Potter. We are doing the Harry Potter. Why? How is the Harvard of the Philippines? What is the Harvard of the Philippines look like? Oh, it looks like a... Wizards of Waverly Blinks. Oh, my favorite of shows. I love that. Here's one thing. Here's something to ponder in your brain. Why do the most prestigious schools have to be the most expensive? Yes, and is being an expensive school a good thing? Does being expensive make it prestigious and does being expensive make your education that much better or is somebody profiting off of the extra expense added on to things that may be the same at a less expensive school? Quite a ponderous question. What the life? What type of society do we live in? We live in a society. Boom! Now that we've made you ponder... Ponder! Ponder! Your entire existence?

This is for when your parents are like, child, we don't want you anymore. Go. Be bored at boarding school forever. Can I come out for some airs? No. You're there forever. We pay the extra to make sure you stay there for the summer. Oh, mom. Sorry. Get educated. And then when they get out, they're like, God, mom and dad, that I don't know anymore. I did it. Okay, go start making us money. We expect 20% on my phone. We pay for everything that you did. So that's how it works. How many are there for you jetzt? I think it's- $75,000. Her describing this like the worst best book ever buy off. Are there 50,000 P<|pl|> S Thirty Thousand P fuckin' Paiso Adlin. Min account here and there. I'm a manila. I'm proud of by the society of Jesus. Oh, Jesus himself? Yeah. We saved you. Cheers. Interesting. Larger, I need. Hmm. What the heck? What about the gals? Where the gals? There better be some gals on it. Only gals on it. Gals ain't getting educated in the Philippines. Guys, I'm sorry. They do have a very round basketball arena. International school rule. It looks like a hotel. It literally does. This is what I include the gals. Gals? I don't know. South Bill and I have another name. This is not included books in the tuition fees. So you got to pay for the books. British one. Oh my god, it doubled to the British. The fracking birds. All of a sudden we're going to walk into the Philippines. Hello there. Go for a nun. Did you go to the British International school? I did, bro. And then they'll just be British forever. They'll be drinking tea. I think that's how it works when they go to British school. They teach them. They don't just teach them. They indoctricate them to be British. So they're like, okay, now we're going in. It's the whole British plan. They set up all of these British schools around the world. And then they'll have all of their British students invade the rest of all the countries. And then they'll take over every country. They'll be like, the British Empire is restored. It's like the chum bucket episode. We're playing and puts those buckets over their heads. That's the movie over. Oh yeah, the movie where he puts the buckets over the head. They're going to take over the world. But instead of buckets. British. Instead of buckets is actually just within their own brain. It's the tea bags that they drink. Oh my god. Oh hell British. Wow, it's all coming together. It's all coming together. Watch yourselves. If you're a kid that would just British school. I don't know why I did that in British. You better watch yourself. I don't know what to do with the person. Maybe lock them in a closet. And don't let them out. This is locked out. Please do not lock them in a closet. Lock them in a closet right now. Boop. Guys and gals. They have egg chairs. Oh my god. I don't care. I'm like a cost alone. Go right now. 3,500. Reticulation fee. Brent. It's a very experienced deal with charging people so much. Brent. Brent. Brent. Brent's just a jerk. For X-Fact, interesting. The non-refundable capital development fee. What does that mean? It's like when you take online classes at a college and they charge you for the library fee. I use neither of those. Can I not pay that? No. No, he paid. And they're like even if you were to use them, it's still unreasonably priced. $600 for technology fee. Do it. Yes, pay. Thank you very much. What if I already spent $600 on the technology I need to use this? No. Can you actually pay me then? $600. By the way, you need $1000 worth of books for every class. But why are books normally only like $100? They make in mad dollar runes. Often the book companies are making mad dollars. So why not? It's all just a big pyramid scheme. The book companies pay the colleges and then another thing. Are you going to pull them? We're going to go pull them. But the thing here, which is pretty crazy, is that this says it charges $9,000 for an annual payment. In the US, schools can get up to like, once you pay for the room and board to, some of the schools are going to be like $100,000 a year, which is absolutely absurd. $110 the amount of that to go to college and learn. So once you get out of college, you can work for the same companies that you paid basically to get into college. And with the room and board to, some colleges require you to room and board and then make you pay for it. Yeah. So even if you live right next to the college. No, yeah, you're going there. If you're driving distance, you have to live here and you have to pay for our food and for your crappy room. You literally have to pay for like $1,800 a month apartment. Basically, you pay $3,000 and it's not an apartment. It's a terrible... You don't get a bathroom? Yeah. You have to share it with somebody else that you do not know. And you get a lot of great things. And you have to pay for the cafeteria food college. College! Good thing I'm done with it. I think I didn't go. Oh no! Go to college! If you want to... Get more knowledge. You want to go to college. Get more knowledge, alright? Thank you everybody for watching. We just... We set a lot of ponderous things. We just basically ripped on college the whole time. We ripped on expensive colleges. In fact, they cost that much money. We're pointing fingers a lot to the US. Education should not cost. Education should be attainable for everybody. Alright? See you guys in the next video. Like the video, more Philippines reactions coming soon. See you later. Check out the drop of jail. Bye.
