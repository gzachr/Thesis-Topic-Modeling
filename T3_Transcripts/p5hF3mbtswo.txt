hello my friends this is bobby d coming
to you live from tomorrow barnes
singapore
i'm having an awesome time in the
philippines today hope you are as well
with me from here today i want to talk
about philippine filipina care
how to deal with the haters
energy prince filipina caring
yeah
how to deal with a hater
in
the
50s yeah
now
when you talk
about the philippines
you saying
this is a country that
many many people aspire to come to
and one of the reasons why people aspire
to come here in particular
african-americans because filipinos are
very very receptive
for the most part
to most anybody and everybody
all you got to have is a monte parte and
you're
their friend
however
there are times my guys
when
you can have all the monetary you want
but if you have some melanin in your
skin
see this hot chocolate i got over me hot
chocolate everywhere you can see yeah
and that rhyme melody in your skin
sometimes my guys
filipino
okay can't get a little attitude
yeah they can get a tune on you uh-huh
yeah
yeah so
i want to
share with you
a very toxic experience
that that that i encountered on
yesterday
and
you know i i don't normally get things
like this come to me in the philippines
but
i don't know what happened it just
happened
you know
and so when things happen to me like
this
i have to [ __ ]
because it's unusual
i didn't do anything wrong
but
i was the point i i was the object of
someone's hatred
and you'll find that as we go through
this today but i'm gonna share this with
you
and the reason why i'm sharing this with
you is not that i want to put aspersions
on the filipinos for the peanuts in this
country
because as i've shared with you many
many times in the past
filipinas are some of the best loving
care shared people in the world however
there are exceptions to every move okay
look today ladies and gentlemen
i want to share with you an exception to
the friendly rules to the philippines
okay
i was a victim
and i don't like being a victim of your
hatred man you know i don't like it and
she okay let me let me just get this do
it man i'm jumping ahead of myself i'm
gonna let y'all know one of the reasons
why i'm sharing this story with you is
that you need to know
when you come out here if you're african
american you've got some melanin in your
skin
everybody ain't fighting
you want to say that again
i said when you come out here and you
got some melanin in your skin
don't make the assumption that everybody
loves you
don't do this son
because you will be highly mistaken
everybody every filipino every filipina
does not like black folks okay
don't get it twisted my brother
because you can get twisted if you get
it twisted
okay there are people out here that
hates your cup
they they don't even know you man
they just you know that melon in their
they hate you man
because you've got some blackness on you
and you don't think it's just not in the
philippines but like you lying i'm gonna
show you it's true i got my wife right
here she's with me
back my story up i got i got a weakness
yeah so
first time
i've ever been discriminated against in
this matter
there has been some partial but not like
this
this is late
it was over
and i have to share this with you so
when you come out here got a lot of you
guys coming out here
you know
and they ain't gonna wrong in the wrong
car
but i want you to be
uh
i want you to keep listening in the
memory banks
i want you to be thankful you see i want
you to be aware that things like this
could happen
and i want you i want you to be diligent
i want you to be ready
don't drop your guard for a minute
anytime you move out and go out of the
country you're black to speak for itself
you ain't got to say one word
everybody look at you and know who you
are what you are
so you got a target on your back and
yesterday somebody hit the bulls out on
me okay
they talked i was targeted
okay
simply because i was black and a man
so they're going to talk about uh
thumbnails some of the birthday
thumbnail for today no hocus pocus
let's go here we go
this is right here
filipina care man
yeah that's it
that's not an exact picture that's it
that's a i guess a representation of the
spirit she had and the representation of
the anger she had towards me and the
representation of the hatred
in her eyes towards an individual a man
a black man and that she didn't like
okay
she said bobby you know you did
something
i didn't left it man that you as we go
through this
incident tonight you're gonna see i
would i didn't do anything with the
warrant to warn what she did okay to
warn her actions okay
my wife was right there she can verify
what i'm saying
all right
so you stand up for the video
don't hold this focus just about this
i have a whole lot of
all right
you see we'll talk about a young mall
this thing i was having our little
normal things we do tomorrow we had it
we had to go somewhere we had we had to
go to the mall and take care of business
we'll talk about that then we'll talk
about the incident exactly what happened
then we're going to talk about the anger
and the hate
it came after the incident
and then we're going to talk about
lessons left
you know everything that happens to me
everything that happens to you you need
a learner that's
from
and if you've never learned a lesson
from the things that happened to you my
brothers my sisters you would wind up
repeating it
that's called being
ignorant like my mommy said you ignorant
song
you just don't know and the reason why
you're ignorant because you don't learn
from the mistakes or the lessons of the
past
i was eating
i let my guards down and she came in on
me okay but i'm gonna show you
i learned baby
this is not gonna happen to me no
no no
i don't i'm not anyway let's go let's go
all right so number one is what what's
number one y'all don't forgot that
question number one
at yala mall yeah so listening now we're
down to yellow
it was a saturday
right
it was a saturday
and uh
we had to go to sky mall sky cave
and mall and the reason why we had to go
to sky cable we have a cable
uh remote controller that was not
functioning properly every time we did
the number one it would go to zero it
would never correspond to the number
we're hitting it so we never can change
the challenge and on our tv it doesn't
have a manual control everything is
electronic with that tv so with so
enough all of us to change the chat up
we have to go to sky hall and get
another remote so that was our goal we
had a couple other things we did as well
because you don't need this you always
learned about them stuff
but anyway so we're going to just get
them all okay so what happened was
i got she said she said first of all
both of us there was a line that long i
could go but there was a sunday
everybody trying to get the jumps stuff
done when it's all from work okay
so i said look at me still not so we was
in the line right
so this d said uh
i got to go i got to go shop and do
something can
and wait till they call us i said this
yeah i'm gonna stand in line and so i
walked away from her lisa dean let her
stay in the lab and i walked down to the
after
that corridor where there was a seat to
sit down so i sat down
now blowing my cell phone looking at
some videos that's all i'm doing sitting
down by myself okay so lisa d came who
got me about maybe 20 minutes later lisa
d came who got me he said i really need
you to get in this line bobby
and i took i took her spot that she had
vacated to come here are you following
me so far gee gp you got me all right
so i stand in the line right
he should be gone down to uh the
apartment store she had to purchase
somebody
okay whatever lisa what up i ain't
talking all that she went
she went somewhere okay so i was in the
line by myself minding my business
looking at my cell phone okay that's
what i'm doing
i'm serious i didn't talk to nobody i
didn't look at nobody i didn't cuss
nobody out i reminded my business man i
looked down at myself that's all i was
doing
watching a youtube video that's all i
was doing
okay
so then she was still gone and i was
lying at all and the lady that's
she was in front of me okay
now as you know
in in in his philippines you gotta be
socially different
so i made sure i wasn't too far upon her
okay
and people behind me was all on me
i couldn't move back i want to say
something else i'm not angry just
getting let go so i would i made sure i
had my dish between me and earth but the
people behind me it was on me so i don't
i don't know what i'm saying until
something let's go i just watched myself
because i know i had my mask on i was
all right okay
okay
let's go to the second point
i think i got you on the point too hold
up
number two what the answer so i'm
describing this
this is a yellow mall
that's that that's a depiction of the
lady right there that's not her actual
face that's the depiction of her
attitude her nastiness
you know the way she dealt with me
unnecessarily in that round
okay so it was a normal day for us we're
talking about the line lisa d is going
to get her cell phone whatever
so i'm watching i'm just looking at my
cell phone i fell in line i'm looking at
my cell phone i didn't want to be in the
line first of all
can you just because you know what
happened our normal rule is this guy
whenever he said i go somewhere to
handle business
i use her
as the initiator
as the negotiator but i tell her what i
want her to do before she gets there and
the reason why i do this is because they
will accept as a native speaking person
anything from them versus a form you
will find
you will find that you're not accepted
as a native speaking person is accepted
in this country so it's a good habit to
get in ladies and gentlemen to let your
spouse or your mate or your partner
that's filipino do all the negotiating
do all the communicating do all the
talking and the business stuff but i saw
i never do stuff but i always tell them
that's what i want you to do i give it
instructions and she follows it right
so this time i have to do it okay so i
said okay i should listen to you now i'm
like you're not gonna do these people
they don't understand me and i get
frustrated and they get frustrated
please no i'll be right back that's okay
so i'm still in line we might be my uh
doing a youtube video
and uh
it's caring
here nasty care
was sitting up in front of me okay i
made sure that i was not up on her okay
the people in the back of me was all on
me okay it was they weren't showing you
did they was closer because i don't know
what it is people in the philippines
like to creep up on okay and they like
these dj they like to creep up on they
don't like to do social distance out
here i had my mask on so i felt okay and
i put my alcohol on my ears and all this
stuff so i was all right with it but i
wasn't on her lady so the next thing
okay what's the point of you on number
two
isn't it okay okay
uh we are number two
by the inside okay so here's what
happened y'all
she comes up on me okay
and she turns around
and she said
you need to move back i said what excuse
me
they gonna play with you
the lady said move back so what else
excuse me
i said man i'm already socially
i'm not bothering you man please leave
me alone
she said you need to move back so i said
man i'm not moving nowhere but first let
me tell you what happened in my mind
when she said move back
something in my mind snapped and i just
i was going to do what she told me to do
i don't know why so i turned around and
looked i was getting ready to move back
but when i remember the people right on
me that's not i'm not moving back i
didn't want to make everybody everybody
had to move back if i moved back because
they were falling all up on me i wasn't
up on her okay
so she said you need to i said i'm not
moving nowhere when i turn back and i
realized i couldn't move back without
bothering everybody else i said man i'm
not moving over
i said as you move you want to move up
you move up man you think i'm too close
to you you move up i'm socially distant
man and the guard security guard was
right there listening to us and watching
us both
okay so i was not wrong he knew if he
said i was too if he just said you too
closer i would move back but i wasn't
she had a chip on her shoulder and she
chose me to to move that chip she told
me you know to be the brunt of her anger
the brunt of her hatred
she took it out on me i wasn't doing
nothing to i didn't look at the lady man
i wasn't allowed i didn't watch my video
that's all i was doing
and so next thing i know man
she comes off of me and then she said
what do you think i said i know who i am
i said who you think you are you don't
talk to me like that i don't even know
you if you don't know me you don't come
up on me like that man what's wrong with
you he said no what's wrong with you i
said ma'am you don't like foreigners
that's your problem but don't come
checking it out on me you know it's next
thing i know
he said a few other words and saguaro i
know she i guess she was cussing me out
i don't know i couldn't i couldn't pick
up all the word but it wasn't nice
whatever she was saying
so everybody you know in the philippines
whenever you were allowed she was loud
so i got back with her
she was loud to me she lied to me man i
ain't got nothing to the lady now she
live talk me
for no reason
so next thing i know man the guard told
the lady man move on up move on going
off to your turn going off so sir turn
up going off she took a chicken and went
off so then i moved up
and then
i turned around to the side
she she in the office now right and you
get there's a glass you can see people
sitting off that's what she did
from the office y'all
she threw me the thing
he threw me the birds he flipped me
down once
twice i ain't got nothing to the lady
about one thing
and that let me know it was personal
with her
she
she chose me to put her venom on
she chose me to put her hatred on
she told me she singled me out because
of the color of my skin
to denigrate me
to attempt she attempted to but i didn't
bow down to her
i wasn't much and she couldn't make me
go move
so that's what i'm trying to tell y'all
this is what happened to me
filipino
full of anger
for the hatred
took her nasty caring attitude out on me
because of the color of my skin i could
have seen if i said something to the
lady i touched her or pushed her i did
nothing to the lady i'd even look at her
it was a reflection of her anger she put
it on me
i told her no man i'm not moving
no means no she said you need to move
out i said ma'am i'm not moving nowhere
no means no
okay i said you move
she went and i told her you moved up she
got outraged y'all should have seen it
was like a devil rising
you know i'm saying
you know and i know people okay
i have a gift of discernment i can
discern what's going on she had to deal
with raging up to her
and when i saw the devil in her i just
stood my ground because i knew if i said
something i could wait with
then she walks in the office and she
threw the bird at me man twice
and the people in the line saw it
filipinos do not like ruined people i
said look at her you know i got the
attention of what she was doing
they did like this
they was ashamed of her
i didn't bother the lady everybody in
the line saw me i wasn't bothering
nobody i was just looking at myself look
at this video i said
head down with the video and all of a
sudden she come up and turn on me man
you know
so i'm letting you know when you come to
the philippines
be ready you don't forget in your mind
and everybody's lovely and everybody's
nice and that's how they love and love
to be loved and yeah somebody that's
true but some of that's not so true
if you miss if you get in the wrong
person
binoculars if you get in the wrong
person's scope
you're going to be trapped for you just
like you was in the states
okay that's what happened and i'm going
to show you the late this is the actual
picture i got to snap a picture of it
from the back i didn't get a front shot
put it to the front shop that's her
right there
she was full of anger
she was full of hate
she gave me a nasty look she had a very
nasty tone in her voice and she flipped
me off twice
chinese
filipino
and chinese if you don't know don't like
black though
that's my opinion
and i'm not trying to be xenophobic or
nothing like that this is going from my
personal experience in life
okay
that's that's that that's not based on
data that's why it's based on my
personal anecdotal experience okay
so
i'm telling you this
whenever you come to the philippine
philippines if you're african-american
you have melanin in your skin if you're
african
be aware that you have a target on your
back
okay
that's one of my lessons to learn from
this baby
do not become complacent when you come
to this country
because i lost i let my guard down
i'm always alert
like this but not that time
i made a silly mistake and i let my
guard down by watching the figure i will
never do that again
when i'm around philippines i'm always
like this most of the time but that time
i didn't want to go into that at least
if you made me going tonight i didn't
want to go in tonight because i know how
they do for us i know how they do
so
this d comes back
okay she came back right after the
incident
she had went to the car to get her
telephone
she said what happened i said that lady
had to fool with me i ain't done nothing
to her
she just go sit down so i went away from
there she got back in the night
so after she got in the line
everybody was telling her how rude the
lady was to me
they was ashamed of what she did right
i didn't do nothing to the lady man i'll
be honest with you if i said something
on the way to her if i touched her i up
here or just you know by mistake and
push that on or something i would have
said it i did nothing
that's why i'm so
i i'm just disgusted with it there's an
incident i did nothing i said nothing i
didn't even look at
her okay
she came up off on me
but i still my grandma
i'm not gonna be your boy
i'm not gonna be your slave i'm not
gonna be the victim of your better i
don't care if you white black filipino
chinese russian jewish you i'm not i'm
not gonna i'm not gonna bow down to no
woman or no man that will treat me less
than i deserve
i did nothing to her
and i wasn't gonna move one inch okay
so when you come out here ladies and
gentlemen be aware
you are a target
so i'm gonna come after you if you for
any reason stay calm first thing you
need to do stay calm
don't get upset because you're not in
the united states of america don't get
upset don't try to hit nobody don't try
to slap nobody don't try to cuss nobody
stand your ground if you're right if
you're wrong you better make you wrong
and get in apologize but i wasn't wrong
i did nothing i had nothing to do even
for everybody in the back was like
what's wrong with her
i don't know she she left her legs at
home didn't take her meds i don't know
what's wrong with the woman
so
because
don't bow down if you write stand up
strong like a man or a woman you are
endless witnesses
make sure if you have an incident that
you got somebody who saw exactly what
happened that could tell the truth
everybody around me saw exactly what
happened i touched didn't did not touch
the lady i was watching my video didn't
say a word to her she came up off on me
so have witnesses if you have an
incident
because a lot of you guys have been here
ever been here a lot of you guys never
been out of the country before
watch your mouth watch what you say
watch how you look at people watch what
you're doing because you if you're
melanated like me
you have a target on your back if you're
caucasian they're gonna they're not
gonna mess with you that much for some
reason
is the people that are african-american
or african that they target the ones
that don't like black people or
blackness they target us
and you know i get i get feedback i get
a lot of i can't pick back from people
that say well you know about either you
all that people be like oh god yeah some
of them do
some some of them like all kinds of
color you know they sell them but
there's someone that don't
and if you make the mistake of running
into someone that don't and you try to
treat them like they're your buddy you
won't be in the current
they're gonna do something to tell you
i'm not your brother i don't like black
people
some filipinos i'm filipinos don't even
like your calling man they don't even
want you next to them
they don't want you to touch them
they don't even like looking at you okay
and that's what happened
i detected her racist tone
my detection she didn't want me next
time because see in a lot of their minds
when you're next to somebody that's
black
that rubs off on them
blackness is bad in their minds right
so
this incident will forever be etched in
my mind
and i will forever be diligent and i
will never be complacent again and let
my guard down when i'm in the middle in
the midst of some filipinos and i'm the
only one by myself okay
and i would suggest that you do the same
my brothers
i would suggest that you be aware of
your surroundings at all times i made a
mistake saturday i left my guard down
because i was watching the video
right
and she saw me watching my video i was
looking up and she still tried to take
advantage of me but i ain't playing that
game i didn't budge
she took a burden
or if i could about
it was 10 years younger me i would win
in the office and being here with it i
wouldn't hit another only women but we
would have had it out they probably had
to call for me i would cuss it out you
know but thank god the lord was with me
and uh he done had a change in my life
and i had a change in my life and i
don't do those bad things no more okay
at least i tried not to
but thank god at least he came
and she found out she you know this
would be always checked up on me
this is
i said i mean
when i came back
sat down where you were sitting down
on the hallway because i was tired
walking so
there was a lady behind him
uh sitting down also and then when i sat
down there the lady told me
mom
you're wrong your partner had an
argument
right and then i walked down to him
oh i immediately and then i said what's
going on
and then
he's talking about you know
i mean that lady in front of us was
uh was mad at me that i don't know why
oh no
the guard and the other ladies there
telling me what happened that the lady
was mad because there was no
uh distance
this was and then
and then the lady said that there was i
mean he was not too close to her
and
and the lady said that
uh he cannot move back also because the
people behind right through right up
horn oh yeah
it's like that
wow
and look at the lady lady inside her
office he told us she took
her face mask up i said
why is she taking her face mask off
because she's enraged she's still angry
remember she gave me a finger twice i
didn't know about that that she did
finger yes
if if the lady is there the guard says
something about that then i will
confront her well i'm glad you weren't
there because i didn't want you to get
in trouble this dude will fight for me
y'all if you got a good woman that will
fuel me anybody come against me she
gonna get her she so i'm glad she wasn't
there when it happened because she would
have she would have gotten into it then
later so it all worked out
but i'm bringing this to you to let you
know
this kieran's all over the world okay
not not only in the united states of the
dog here
not only in france great britain
you know it's everywhere
i've been to a lot of different nations
in different countries and everywhere
i've gone
i felt a little bit of uneasiness
because how they treat some countries
treat you worse than others
this country
i might say treats you better than many
many others but there's still the
symptoms
there's so there's still some some
some of that hatred and anger because of
my color or color out
and so i don't i've never i've had
something as close to this one time but
it was never this bad
i knew she didn't like me i never i
didn't do nothing to the lady man
and she came i never had this
i didn't do nothing today
she came off on me for like
i was an animal or something
you know
i haven't done nothing she don't even
know me
so i'm telling you man come out here
you know don't
be paranoid and thinking everybody want
to get you because that's not the case
at all
but you need to be aware
that everybody ain't fighting okay
you know
everybody's not for you everybody's not
for you in the united states
and everybody is not for you in the in
the philippines
okay where do you go
you if you have melanin in your skin
if you're a chocolate man like me with
the dark chocolate i'm dark chocolate i
ain't some of y'all lighter than me i
got that dark chocolate color
so i draw more attention than most
okay
so if you like me
be aware that you don't want to be uh
drawing if you don't want you don't want
to be uh taking advantage of stand up
for who you are and what you are if
you're right if you're wrong apologize
and keep it okay that's all it is
reaction i'm alright train night i'm a
little bit gone man because i'm still
i'm i'm still i'm still sort of worked
up about it but you know what man it's
all good
things happen for a reason and they have
a [ __ ]
i believe this happened to me to let me
know that i need to be more diligent
than i was i became comfortable
i became complacent
because
things like this don't happen here to me
but it did
it opened up my eyes
that racism is everywhere okay
so you got guys out there doing these
blogs
[Music]
like this
yourself you believe that you want to
okay
i'm telling you the truth the naked
truth
every filipino every filipina
is not [ __ ] if you got this melon in
your skin if you caucasian they all up
on you then do they play
okay
there are some that just will not like
you for who you are and what you want
not even knowing your name
okay that's what happened to me
i was targeted by
a filipina chinese woman
and she went off on me
i wanted to go but that's not i'm
beating i'll be i'll be looking at the
food man it went off all day because
whenever you have a man and a woman
talking and they get loud
guess who already get the blood the man
okay so i kept myself low i kept blowing
i kept my tongue though i kept down
okay so they i could have been in jail
you know i could have said this i'm the
woman and she said well he assaulted me
yeah
crazy stuff people do
i'm a man as i'm a foreign man in a
foreign land
i could have been arrested they could
have took my passport they could have
deported me
over craziness man you know
but i wasn't going to be belittled by
her
i'm not going to bow down and kiss her
feet move i had no reason to move i
didn't have to light it and i wasn't up
on her i was totally distant
he was in the back of me it wasn't and
if i had to move everybody had to move
back i wasn't forgot all these people it
was a long line
so i stood my ground and i was
right she got angry because she knew she
was wrong
she was angry at me not because i was up
on her because i was not about her
she was angry at me because i was a
black man behind her she didn't like my
cup she didn't like who i was she didn't
like what i represented in her mind i
represented eve
the ladies there they were shaking their
head but when i came up over there
and they wanted to tell the truth but
she was there so we cannot talk to each
other
the ladies there they saw the incident
yeah what do you saw and the nurses
shaking their head yeah because it was
she's embarrassing to the filipinos
filipinos don't like movies
they don't like movies and they don't
like loudness so the lady got loud to me
and she was rude to me by giving me the
finger
i didn't look to the lady man
i don't go around here looking for
trouble with philippines i know better
and so you know i'm just saying this man
be careful when you come out here okay
don't listen to everybody
you have a problem you may not have no
problem but keep your eyes on
keep your ears open
okay something you might run up on
somebody like i just did i've been out
there almost eight years
this is the worst incident i've ever had
since i've been here
i've never had this happen to me before
now i've had close stuff where i know
somebody didn't like me but they didn't
go off on me you know
this thing went off on me
and she better be she better be thankful
that i had my self control because i
would have went off on it it would have
not been nice
i told her i told bobby
you should tell me that she gave me your
finger because i will fight with her so
if she's skinny
in there there would have been a problem
and she might have gotten laughs and
then when i looked at the lady because
she was turning around but she thought
that bobby was still standing there she
she looked at me and she turned around
and then she saw me she did it
immediately she turned her head
immediately yeah because she knew she
was wrong but she knew that you were my
wife she knew she knew and everybody
else in the language was wrong
so beware ladies gentlemen when you come
out to the philippines
there are people that don't care for you
if you're not the melody they they love
the caucasians
you know why they don't have this miller
some of them know some most
overall
most filipinos love everybody let me
just say that
most filipinos love everybody despite
your color okay
or your race
but there are some
that do not like your color
and that do not like black people they
got a lot of negative stereotypes
running up in their minds about
blackness
and what black people do
keep that in the forefront of your mind
don't go around and smiling at everybody
because everybody ain't gonna be smiling
at you
okay and the one ain't smiling at you
ain't smiling at you for a reason and
for a seat
they're not your friends okay
be respectful to everybody
and be polite to everybody whether you
think they like you or not that's how i
do okay and you might be all right but
there's some people out there that no
matter what you do they coming for you
okay and be ready for that when they do
it let's go ryan train by releasing one

top and not the bottom i don't know
about you man but every time i do
something at night if it's good i won't
be the top dog
i want to be at the top but it was bad
i don't know what it is man chinese are
very argumentative
they have a high temper they're high
strong
she's a chinese filipino
and uh
she looked at me
and i was on her radar
and she came after me okay i don't know
what it was i don't know if the fact
that i was just standing in the back of
her that got her ear hurt at me i don't
know what it was
i don't know
and i don't need to know all i need to
know is i'm not going to bow down to
craziness i've done nothing wrong to
this day at first she said move back
at first i don't know what happened man
but something checked in my mind just
moved it i'm going to bear
and then when i saw the people right
before i said no no
that's no i'm not gonna move back it's
too many people
oh man it's just crazy after that let's
go right to anybody in one nation who we
got
john thomas
stability this is dominance led to
stability in every way yeah man you find
you find it
so i'm just i brought this to you as
caution to you guys that coming out here
especially those you've never been here
uh because what happens is when you get
here everybody's so nice and so friendly
and so relaxed and you feel like man
and you let your guards down
don't let your gosh
don't be paranoid but be really
diligent
be diligent
always be alert to your surroundings
what's going on
what's happening and don't
go for the okie
you know and then what happens to a lot
of people when they come out here
they try to
they're around a lot of filipinos and
they try to be like philippines you'll
never be a filipino i don't care how
long you live out here
you'll never be accepted as a filipino
and you'll never be a philippine because
you if you don't have that color if you
don't have that birth that that blood in
you you're not okay if you get a kid to
be a naturalized citizen in the
philippines you will never
be accepted
fulfilled so a lot of people are trying
to get anything gonna work let's go
around training if i really see one
nation we got john thomas i mean i said
uh this is horrible bobby
some people are just stupid making their
way to my yeah that's it man crazy man
you know what i'm saying
i don't know what's wrong the lady man
but
i that that touched me man it got to me
for a minute you know but i went home i
prayed about it and i didn't move on
because she's just misguided
uh she picked on me for no reason i
didn't do nothing to the lady i never
opened my mouth to say nothing to her i
didn't even look at it because i when
she left when she put me in the line
these d put me in line i said man
because i was i was watching a good
video sitting down here and she came and
got me i'm sitting there i'm standing
there i was watching a video
about five minutes later did she come up
on me you know i'm saying so yeah man
people got issues man and uh you have to
be ready because you don't know a lot of
crazy people in this world and it's not
just in the united states
everywhere you go and some people
somebody some people are crazy and they
do crazy things you got to be prepared
for it roger about releasing one nation

uh we got uh tomorrow he's hit by me
that's not right that's pretty and
that's happens sometimes over here by
stupid people that do yeah man
you gotta realize everybody's everybody
is gonna have to possess the
sensibilities
and they don't possess the ability to
get along with others
and if some people have fears and the
phobias in their minds about us
and if you are an african-american or
african with smelling in your skin you
have to be alert everywhere you go i let
my guards down normally when i when i'm
in the public eye at least me i'm always
doing one of these and i'm always alert
but that time i left my guards down and
she got on here what's good right there
about anything one time she we got
margaret hey her
but you know man i don't know what
happened to the lady
you know i i know for a fact this is my
personal experience chinese people have
issues with
people like me and you guys know me when
i went to hong kong she don't look like
chinese she's chinese you have to tell
that lady you didn't hear her
so you can't tell i know he's chinese i
don't care what you said he was a
chinese philippines
yeah
he said you never heard a lady talk when
you leave what i did when a chinese
person talks for the penal there's a
hybrid cell
and there's a tone that comes up
unmistakably chinese cheating here
there's a lady across the street from us
that's chinese filipino she has the same
tone in the same
dialect or accent that let me know she's
shiny and she's slender and when she
looked at me i could see them i was
slammed let's go right through everybody
we got
live in the philippines i mean like
north carolina he said i experienced
that bobby lee from all races from
especially my own race because i have
light skin which makes me no sense to me
yeah i know sometimes we have there's a
lot of people uh
inter this intra
within our own race and it's enter
racial fire so you have experience in
truck within our race bias towards you
because you're light toned skin that
happens man you know when i was coming
up as a kid in high school
uh if you if you were chocolate black
like me
you guys killing you discriminated again
too they didn't like talking back like
me without coming if they were high
younger like you
they all the high yellow people got the
good the good position in school you
know they've got to be major at the girl
you know
but if things have changed now now if
you hire younger you stay talking about
you don't sold out
yeah you sold out monroe i hope you
ain't sold out man but yeah man that's
how that happened it's called
intra-racial bias or interracial
discrimination when i was a kid uh if
you were dark black like me they they
bothered me because of my company black
they call me dirty black all kind of
things man and then now
if you if you like skin they call your
name now something
his apprentice takes off yeah it takes
all for him to come from all different
kinds of people
and you have to be prepared for it
uh and uh she almost got me one minute
man i started to move to the back
that was
[Music]
the guard was right there guys
i was here she was in front of me the
guard was to our left she was he was
right there he heard everything he saw
everything if i was too close to her all
the guards i said was so you gotta move
back he didn't say nothing
okay that let you know i wasn't too
close
all he did was watch us you know
so it wasn't it wasn't my issue it was
her issue right train property we got
john he said uh that's true but remember
there's still two distinctive wars going
on philippines and a lot of violence in
this country yeah man there's a lot of
violence in the country and the
philippines a lot of violence usa
and we have to be
cognizant of that wherever we go in this
world
and know how to deal with issues this is
a life issue that
uh people with melanin in their skins
deal with every day and i the problem
that really took me
i took it a little hard because i've
never had this experience over here like
this never i've never had anything like
this happen
this is a first it may not be the last
but i want to bring it to you guys so
you'll know uh some of you guys that
become like john yeah i've been coming
here for years yeah i probably never had
this happen you know but i'm bringing it
to you attention john people like john
has been over a long time
that you know they could have and be
aware of your surroundings and what's
around you the people around you at all
times
we got
murphy and his senses to the national
irrational mind of yes it's sisters i
couldn't understand much more i did
nothing to her i said another dirk and i
went up on her
i was just as distant as everybody more
distant than the others you know
philippines when you come out here guys
you see there's supposed to be social
distance line most of the filipinos
don't have socialism but i make sure i
do this [ __ ] telling me that
you say can i speak complacent in manila
or other i said no large cities guys
john that's a good point john
the larger the city the more diligent
and diligent you need to be
but you get you get hurt you can
probably get robbed and get stolen i
remember releasing i was in the middle
of about two years
ago you remember this time i don't know
what we were doing we're trying to walk
on the street
yeah and we went into a shop right i
don't know what we're doing i said this
is the man watching us there's a man
watching that he went from one every
time he got out of the shop he would
fall off to another got our shot fallen
he was following us and he had to be
careful because i think we're trying to
pickpocket us a target after something
and i don't know how we got out of that
situation but somehow another heat up
doesn't know but uh the stuff like that
happens all the time when you're in the
bigger city there's pickpockets out
there in the bigger cities and not in
the bigger cities and smaller ones but
mostly you'll find it in the biggest
cities like another i've never found any
pink pocket in here to see boo but nila
it happens all the time ryan train by
releasing one nation
murphy he said i agree with that you
should be always on your guard it can't
happen so yeah it could happen suddenly
and uh you need to be ready okay for
whatever pops off whatever jumps off on
you when you're out the country be ready
don't have to fool stay calm and be
polite and and more importantly be right
if you're right you have nothing to fear
okay you don't have nothing to fear
you ain't got to worry about nothing
just do say the right thing to do what's
right but if you wrong you better
quickly apologize
sometimes people are so stupid at times
and do stupid things because they are
having a bad day or something else is
going on but they should not do that and
it still happens to you yeah i don't
know she maybe she had a bad day
or maybe uh
she knows the way i looked maybe she
thought i was too close you know she
might have thought you know but i think
at all when you when you deal with
people like this in a situation like
this
you recognize that it is a root cause to
every problem it's a root cause to every
situation when you go through the
filters and layers of this complexity of
her life you won't i probably i bet
you're gonna find out she don't like
black folk okay that's the bottom record
let's go right through and bobby who we
got brother hayes he's a funny thing
about and maybe it'd be uh they'd be
lighting but she looks like she has dark
skin she was uh she was a little bit
darker right she was a little bit she
wasn't like releasing
a little bit darker but she was chinese
and she had a nasty attitude man oh lord
y'all said
i felt like i was dealing with a devil
man you know what i'm saying y'all ever
had this experience when somebody mess
with you and you can just see the devil
on it
i'm serious man that's what i felt like
with her
and i was ready too you know i wasn't
ready i wasn't moving
ain't moving man because i'm not
bothering you i said you please stop
talking to me i'm not falling i'm not
saying nothing i'm minding my business i
said that on purpose so the other people
can hear me and say they can't say i
cussed her out enough i didn't say
nothing wrong man but she was wrong
brian trained bobby lazy one nation john
he said the only place that we could get
probably the worst human asian than in
us is china all the discrimination that
blacks have faced there is crazy i know
man
uh they treat the applicants that are
over there like dirt i'll show you i
brought you all several programs about
how they treat the people in africa and
china africans
and the problem is africans treat them
the chinese like kings and queens when
they go to africa you know and you know
china
is rooted in most african countries now
they got they got their hand in most of
the african politics they give them
loans and stuff and so the africans
think they're their friends but all
china want is the resources of africa
once they've used all the resources and
gotten everything from them people they
want to turn them out let them go one
african country got the airport
repossessed by china because they didn't
pay back the loan recently so yeah uh
africans are treated like dirt in china
but they treat the chinese like the king
the queen i don't know why they do that
but that's the way it is in one nation
who we got
arnold he said yes bobby she was
definitely pregnant and racist i
experienced that so many times over here
in these states florida tennessee new
york west virginia each other's stores
and guests yeah uh the further south you
know and you know what it's just not in
the south
because i grow up north too and
sometimes people and eventually if you
go to boston oh man
some people will tell you what you're
doing here inward
it's all over man you have to be ready
you know that's why i used to drive all
over verizon i would hate to go to these
small towns man but most of these small
towns ain't nobody like me
all these big rednecks around there with
them people got your hats and stuff
for bringing this up as sometimes that
is real what happened to you would you
say it's so stupid yeah man it happens
it happens on a daily basis but you know
probably
most people don't say nothing about it
but i normally wouldn't say nothing
about this because i would just chalk it
up to english and this
but because i know a lot of you guys are
coming here right
i want to make sure that you don't get
complacent and you don't think
everybody's [ __ ] out here because
everybody not for you
especially wherever you go because you
have melanin in your skin okay ryan
trainbot we got uh gerald leon what's up
jeremy good to see you good to see you
good to see you gerald this is it's good
that you're telling people both the good
and the bad of you about activities for
karen great subject but sad you gotta
treat us off yeah i mean it was terrible
man i didn't feel good about it i was
talking at least the all the way home
about it i was upset about it but then
again i pray get get myself calm down
relax about it
but she showed her ignorance
and she showed her rudeness because her
own people didn't like what she did i
had you know i could see if i said
something to the lady
i pushed her
or stepped on her toe
something you know like that i could
understand her coming off on me but i
didn't know that i didn't even know she
would definitely you know
watch my video and she came off on me
crazy like man carol liam is in the
mirror it's in manila with his lady so
good to see you gerald hope you're
having fun with your lady having a good
time wow good to see you man send me a
picture girl send me a picture right
train bobby who we got
a christian what's up christian you good
man so good to see you ryan bobby needs
you one
crazy hello night how long have you
lived in the philippines what kind of
challenges do you let's face in the
philippines christian i answered we've
got two questions first question how
long
okay
i moved here in 2014 december
24th to be exact 2014. so how many years
there is eight seven some of them so
i've been in a while
and uh second question was what kind of
challenges do you blacks face in the
good piece
uh i'll be honest with you
the the only challenges you may face is
uh
the only challenge you may face is
trying to find products for your ear
like you know you have to have some
homemade and stuff if
trying to get a good haircut stuff like
that trying to find uh clothing that
features the most uh people that come
here larger than the people here shoes
sizes and stuff like that so if you come
here guys we plan us playing long term
bring as much of your own clothes as you
can because trying to find clothes out
here to fit you is very hard okay so you
can find them but you got to look hard
and you're going to pay more uh as far
as
dealing with the people out here
most of the time uh christian
you will not have this incident that i
had and i recorded it's unusual
it it's in my opinion it's a rarity i'll
tell you i've been about eight years now
i've never experienced it's the first
time that i've had anything like this
happening okay so uh it's unreal it's a
rarity it's unusual but you will find it
as john said more in the larger cities
and see who's a large city
and as large as it is and i've been in
so long i've never run into this so i
thought it would it was noteworthy to
bring it out so that you all know uh
there's a sector there's a section of
people that just don't like blackness
okay i've done a lot of be aware of uh
they call they call black people
yep
negro means black
the term negro is black in spanish
and when the spanish founded
founded the philippines
uh
they they were colonial
over the philadelphia philippines the
colonial times so they removed them for
over 400 years so when they discovered
the philippines the people were small
and dark-skinned okay it wasn't dark but
they were small and dark skinned and
they called them negritos okay the
gritos in spanish means little black
people small black people or tiny black
people so when you come out here
somebody said negro nicorito
that means you're black but it's not a
dark derogatory term as some people may
take it a lot of the cities are called
negro
uh you know a lot of different terms
like that so don't feel bad when you
hear that it's just the way they talk
about it right about releasing one
nation
everybody say incidents like that make
you just want to reach out and touch you
thank you so much you say two two two
two right back into my brother from
another
[Applause]

nation more blessings
hey i did three for you because i
remember sometimes i couldn't do it for
you so i did double for you let's come
right through it man
he said rain man is in the house yeah
man
[Laughter]
uh
he said i had no issues getting my first
30-day visa extension last week
by did not ask for any documents just a
piece of detail yeah you're gonna have a
problem
because they want people to stay here
they want your money general you know
that they want to want you to stay here
and they try to make everything as
pleasant as they can
and uh if you got the wrong type you're
going to be all right
congrats on your 30 days jail first 30
days you're going for another 30. ain't
nothing wrong with that do your thing
very hey he said they were mean to me
bobby i laughed so hard they got quiet
they were me
okay right by the way one nation
remember hey he said they were so ugly
they look like 10 miles of feeling
just
out there y'all can't stop him
jerry flynn he's yeah okay i'm sorry
pumpkin joe what's up fun
you say uh the only reason the racism
i've seen the philippines has been other
foreigners commenting about each other
not knowing when you're around
the conversations you hear and
immigration will pick you up yeah i've
heard some of that stuff in immigration
but remember before i had my 13 a i
would go up there every month
back in them days
it was always crap
now it's not as crowded as it used to be
when you go up there because they you
have to make an appointment now to go up
there and they've got everything
regulated and pandemic but yeah back in
the day man if you always crowded
some people in there peace porn is
pissed off about everything about
filipinos but yet they still stand there
you know they don't like the philippines
they don't like to they don't like that
they already whining and crying and
complaining but they still here you know
if you don't like it
can't go nobody's making you stay here
but yeah you many of you won't want to
have this uh
what happens because it's an unusual
situation
i think i just caught this lady ladies
feeling something bad she didn't have a
bad time or whatever i don't know what
it was but she took it out on me
and it's okay i can deal with it i'm a
man oh man
i'm a grown
let me tell you what i think i'll give
you this
hypothesis okay
i think that
she saw y'all remember the incident
recently on tv where a big black man
beat up a tiny filipina
and almost i mean he decimated that they
almost took her head off he hit her 125
times stumps and kicks
and then on top of that
the black man spit on her okay i think
things like that when they see things
like that on tv
and they they translate it over to
whoever's black that's i'm bad like that
you know but
that's why i say
uh you don't know what's going on in
people's minds
but you know so if you have this color
in you you better be alert i don't care
where you are you know and you know like
pumpkin kill said never happen to him
but yeah guess what pumpkin joke never
happened to me either till yesterday no
i'm saying things happen and if you're
not ready for it you could be caught up
you know so thank god i was able to
maintain my composure
because if i was 10 years younger it
would have been being hurt
it wasn't 10 years ago i said
he said get a strong coffee on me to
recover from that carrot
hey i don't need it man let's go there
for geraldine ryan trained by the lady
one nation
what love we gotta do
[Music]
oh my goodness
[Music]
so what you trying to do
[Music]
[Applause]
thank you thank
you yeah
[Music]
i
[Music]
things happen and you have to be mad
enough to deal with it okay
so don't be a boy and cry about it
[Music]
and don't be a boy and fight the lady
okay boys do stupid stuff like that
you know she's not worthy of you
lowering down her standards so stay up
somebody gotta have some sense right so
you be the one with the sense and you be
the one to be the smart one and not get
locked up with some craziness ryan
trained by releasing one nation jerry
fleming he said i'm coming to the
philippines because america has racism
cornered through it might be though it
might might be some racism in the
philippines the prices i'll pay over
there will make up for it
uh jerry fleming i guarantee you when
you come over here you won't have any
incidents like i did i just had one out
i've been here eight years man ain't
nothing happened to me like i never had
that happen before so very seldom this
is a rarity but i wanted to bring it to
your attention very seldom it's like
coming through he never had another
pumpkin jewel came here like
like two or three years after i did so
you know
the longer you're out here the more
you're going to learn you learn about
stuff and see stuff and the more stuff
might be live without you but
first time you come out here mind your
business do your thing
remember also when
we shop in the supermarket in ayala and
then he was with me in the counter and
then not brilliant
they're talking about you don't bring
that up
i already told him about that
but yes
that's nothing completely
yeah
compared to this incident that was
nothing she was talking about
how long ago was that month couple
months ago
we were in the other mall we were
getting groceries
and uh
there was a there was a guy
you know the box the bagger the bad boy
was back in the groceries and the sales
lady at the cashiers huge cashier
direction phone with the groceries
and i was i walked to wesley you can
have you go ahead [ __ ] so i walked away
and i waited outside tonight for her she
was still in the night away gonna check
her out and she said the boy said
something about my hey you catch her
they were talking i mean she was talking
to the boy and then you know how they
talked they looked at you and they
laughed something like that and then i
heard something bad so i i was i was
talked to i mean i was talking to the to
the cashier
and then
i was trying to get a picture you know
just to
scare her and take a picture and then
she flipped into the other side she
didn't want her she didn't want to be
reported lisa d heard them talking about
my
uh private parts mom you know
they said something bad like all black
men you know what they got you know
so she didn't like it and she said what
did you say she stopped them and said
what did you say and she was angry about
she went to me she went and reported it
she went and the lady turned her badge
around so she gets your name she went to
the office and reported it i don't know
what they did anything about it but uh
you know stuff like that happens all the
time man when you black you know that's
just another incident but i would say
that's nothing compared to this you know
what i'm saying so be weary man i mean
you could sit up here and say oh god
maybe it never happened
he didn't have me either but it happened
right let's go right here
who you got
i'm coming to the philippines because
america okay i said that too yeah man
okay
all right guys
where
uh they're very very particular people
you know daddy i was saying you hate
chinese and i don't
one of one of my best friends
um in the usa
was a chinese guy okay and he he was uh
my computer tip and i had a problem with
my computer back in the m days i didn't
know how to fix but i know i think my
stuff now i would go to him who talked a
lot you know
and uh we're getting good friends you
know so it's not that i don't like
chinese i just don't like the way they
treat black sometimes
this guy didn't work like this so not
all chinese are that way there are only
some of them that way okay so uh there's
exceptions to every rule but
for for me going to hong kong
in singapore because there's a lot of
chinese in singapore saint paul almost
like china
uh
they treated i could tell how they
treated me versus dcd
they treated her like a queen
they thought she was one of them they
thought she was singaporean and they
thought she was in hong kong or chinese
when we went there so that you look good
what kind of me it was stand back you
know you know
if you african american you could tell
that stuff but you know you can't take
it too personal
you gotta know i understand why they're
doing when you understand
why they do
and how they do what they do you're
gonna be up you're not all right with it
it's never
nice to to understand or to deal with
that but you understand you have
understanding what's going on and you
can be more uh i guess accommodating for
them and let it slide rather than get
angry about it because if we were to get
angry about every incident that happened
to us as as african-americans
it
you don't want to go around like that
but i brought that to you today just let
you know
uh there are still tidbits of
uh racial undergoings undertones in this
country
and overall and i will say this over and
over
the philippines is not a highly
prejudiced nation
most people here love everybody no
matter what your color or your race so
get that in your mind however
you have to be aware that there are some
that do not like black they don't like
your color
and it's not being personal about you
but they don't know you they just want
to be around black people they don't
like the color black
black in their mind is bad okay that's
it man uh it's been realistic reading

we got to go
