it is completely different from korean soup

like all filipino foods it increases my appetite
yummy
(no need to say . just yummy)
feel like healthy food
-insane taste

it will be good for hangover
yesterday . we drunk again

- i agree
si won ha ne 시원하네
(feel so good)
impressive
nice hangover food!
not just hangover food i think it is high class
-absolutely
high class taste
feels like korean radish greens miso soup
but the sour taste make it more exotic and increase appetite
so nice
its insane
awesome
damn good
it's similar to galbitang갈비탕(rib soup)
100% filipino dish but i can feel korean taste
-that's right
there are many korean foods that can be compared
this is my first time to eat sinigang
even though i've been to the philippines several times
but its familiar taste
feels like gukbap 국밥 (soup with rice )
i thought filipino food was in harmony with garlic rice
but sinigang it goes well with rice 
-yeah
yummy
healthy taste
chicharon bulaklak
it also tastes good
filipino foods are in harmony with vinegar sauce
-right
when we went to cebu
we ate lechon kawali in vinegar sauce
-it was nice
are you ok?
what?
are you ok?
should i hit him?
dude . why did you hit him?
-hey you said "yes" !! did'nt you??
it's the best combi of kimchi n filipino food
si wan ha ne(시원하네 )
because of radish
what is si won ha nae  in english?
cool??
but its hot
-hot??
feels like fresh?
-it's pure korean word
i can't explain
old people use that word
you know that?
when you get into hot spring
then you can say 'cool'
"si won ha nae" = cool
that's right but actually it means feel so good
thats it
this is si won ha nae
it is the opposite of the actual meaning
father: cool
son : dad its cool??
father : yes
son : OMG so hot!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I also went through
look at this finished!
look at this finished~
chicken sinigang , pork sinigang, lechon bulaklak 
how was it??
soup taste similar each other
feels like korean gukbab
i think its good for hangover 
sweet plain . it was nice
pork sinigang is better?
yes because i prefer pork
i love korean soup 
but sinigang has a special character
sour taste was in harmony with oily pork
so i think pork sinigang is better 
it was great
i also picked pork sinigang
its familiar taste
by the way. both was delicious
the difference is just the ingredients
and i was suprised at the combi of kimchi , rice
if i say 'its korean food' 
i think people gonna believe it
- i think so . really
and these sauce was nice
but i think its better to eat without sauce
it was really nice
thanks for this sinigang and free gift.
