 Hey, I feel like you are part two to what I was talking about on that last video of how sorry I'm gonna pause every so often I see something on the road and I am focusing on my driving. So as in a way I'm doing a video that is good for me because I don't have to look at the camera and it does tend to make me drive slower so I'm looking at 60k right now and there's not very much on the road so it's pretty nice driving here usually. The only problem is traffic like driving before a tractor which is capable of doing quite good speeds. I have lots on this vehicle I've never ever used it's also manual no clutch of course it would still be automatic on the clutch but I can choose which gear I'm going to give you in time and I can do that all on the steering wheel with these paddles. So I thought I would talk about the huge differences. As I said in one last video of this the differences in culture are so deeply ingrained that they are beyond just reading or listening or watching a video about you need to be here and you need to be steeped into the culture itself you need to be impacted by the culture this is the thing in other words it's one thing for me to tell you that I couldn't I couldn't get when I first came when I first came to the hall I tried to go out our first aid kit didn't have any band aids so what could be what could be more basic a building block for first aid I mean we even used the idea of the band aid for doing the first vehicle solution action for any problem or you know it's just putting a band aid over it isn't it's not really a problem I went out I went to all of the drug stores and none of them had a band now it's one thing for me to tell you that and for you to go oh gosh you're not doing it but it's another thing do I actually be walking from one one place to another and talking to someone who is looking at you as if you're asked for a quick course in brain surgery it's just asking for a band aid a lot of that is my fault if I don't speak my language or not but um then I'll think second here which I believe I can explain it but you can't understand it well if you when you want to understand something this is you think about something you don't know I'm approaching the brow of the hill and it was is coming the other way on my side of the road that's why I proposed just that it pulled in in time thankfully as you know the road I'm still here that's one of the things that you need to experience it is to say oh my god what customers are without their supercars and they're on the wrong side of the road coming toward me because they intend to do a left turn over to my right these these are things that rocks now is done here and you can come over then you can say listen listen listen for the views and I know how to do this and it's easier you'll like it no they're working they do are there on the thing themselves one of the decks that is the least understandable is the traffic coming from the right the right way imagine the national highway and we're driving along that this case 60k and a half and someone who is entering the national highway on a motorcycle with two or three people on it and they come straight out into the road without looking quick right turn so that they join you you can use your foreign western project and say look that can't be right because if he doesn't look then he could actually be run down no kidding that's the truth so well now that we've sorted that out all we have to do is put him in the bed but he never would have he stopped doing that all day that's the way that it's done so knowing that it's done that way you the bus you have to change why would he change and do something which is not so safe not so sensible not so logical because that is the way that it's done in this country well we know how to do it better you know how to do it different everything is different here I saw a video on YouTube and it made a point very similar to this it showed the security camera film from a crossing in America a large crossing with several lane hires plenty of room for everybody to get on with their business and cars going in the opposite direction like this crashing into each other and you're looking you say why why did they crash into each other plenty of room but they did and then it showed you a similar kind of crossing in Thailand or it could have it could possibly have been in the Philippines but it's in one of the Asian countries the road is filled with ants posing as motorcycles they get women and it's seething with traffic going in opposite directions to each other and nobody is crashing into each other they are afraid just from the frame of reference they know that people are going to do certain things which from the western part of you will be crazy but they know that they are sent out and that's the way that they're operating right right now I could be overtaken on the inside but at the same time I'd be overtaken on the right side on the outside someone could cut in in front of me and if I were to do the UK thing of giving them a look they truly would not know what I was why they're thinking why is he doing that I didn't do anything I just got any fun because that's the rule when I was at the which started off this line or series of short series too of this kind of talk I was at the I was waiting for best was ordering materials for one of my projects and I'm looking at traffic passing by and looking at the Filipino life this is how things are done look at it as if you are a stranger in a strange land and you will see things differently now you're not correcting everything either that one issue of no done that you should be wearing the crash up he's not he's got a crash on and his passenger has not he's got a child squashed in between adults he shouldn't do that why is he doing so close why is he overtaking on the inside why is he wearing a baseball cap under his crash helmet which obviously doesn't fit him and obviously we're helping if he comes off the bike and then again if I was a traffic cop oh my god I would be so busy here if I was operating on western rules look at that man he's riding a motorcycle in farms slippers little rubber things that are attached around the big toe and he's riding a motorcycle how can he change gear what about his feet look at that man on the tricycle here's his carrying two or three pieces of eight by four plywood look at that other one that just passed he's dragging twenty foot long pieces of rainbow behind his bike how can he do them what about the he's got some wood on the mechanism he's got he's got numerous we just had been overtaken by one he's got numerous sacks of rice they're not tied on they're just balanced there how can he do that another one he's got four five people on a motorcycle and the child on the front is sitting on his front on the gas tank and there's a woman a mother she is holding two children one in a charm and they're on their hip in between her and obviously her husband who is taking the whole family to the market they'll become home with a sack of rice and perhaps a big loop you're in a different place and the differences are as they said profound the man in front of me now he's driving and he's looking around he's not paying attention this would have a chip there would be a challenge for this in the UK he's driving without due care and attention snap got that guy he'll be in court on Monday everything is different and the only way that you can find an insanity is first of all it's very good and very handy to have another person that you can vent with on an entirely personal level and not one which bashes the philippine all the philippine but one which I can give expression to your what can I say your observations oh not what I saw today get away you can do that and then if you go back to accepting what is the way of life here it's different god help you if you're coming over here thinking that because you were a master builder laying our decorative stone that we are going to show everybody how to do it in it's so simple isn't it you could show anybody how to do that so easily no you could there's a man who fun he's trying to sit he is not at about seven kilometers an hour why is he doing that he's a taxi driver and he is looking for a fae not a whole lot different so how it is in London where sorry I'm looking for a parking space now yeah a tricycle taxi driver here is not so different to a black cab driver in the in the heart of London they're looking for a fair they're looking they're looking to be hailed that's their business they've got a family to feed it's understandable here those segments of life here are understandable but when it gets in so how you will respond and interact with your lady who you're going to be maddened love with because she's going to be a beauty it's a given um and you're going to have to work out how things are being said what does she mean she said she did something past tense it's a basic it's an terrible grammar I don't know a past participle from but I don't know a passing bus um but what present future present future it's so basic you know because you have to know whether someone did something or whether they're going to do something or whether they've done it many times you've got to know what those things are so what you find is you have lots of uh phrases in your everyday life which illustrate the certain faults that people have because English is not their first language what they do speak is very good and it will lead you into a false sense of security because you think of course she knows past participle but now you find yourself saying did you actually do that and you think actually then you think that she knows what the word actually means and then you say to her you don't know what actually you just say what does it mean and she'll say I don't know did you make the phone call yes so what did the person says no you're going to I'm going to make it now but you said you had made it yes but you haven't have you no but I'm going to do it now why what's the problem and these things if you multiply those many times you will have your life here and is it a hassle it's chopping up first it might drive you completely insane later but if you let me to handle it in the first place and you get used to saying did you actually call yes but did he speak did you speak to me no so you've said yes and no which is it both there's government and other experts that I'm sure we've laughed about this and said this is the part that certain parts of grammar are beyond them and if you're going to get pompous about it and say oh for god's sake it's just simple grammar how's your desire coming along I have two things that I can say I think in the same I can say I got myself a book which means I have a beautiful wife guess who taught me that and I can say nothing I'll be cut the reason I can say nothing I'll be cut is because when I first came here and when I first got a motorcycle I used to take tellyckly there was a little I came then a little ago and I used to take it all about with me with pressure and I had to know she was not a talker so very often Philippine our kids just charmers at heartbreakers you will adore them sometimes they don't speak and tellyckly wait for years not talking to him always back hours together and she never spoke to him she never had a conversation this was this was what she did did you like that do you not want to do that that was our riveting conversation so I would say to her nothing out the cup and she would understand that because it means did you have fun so what became whole we would have been to outtour us we went to the cafeteria and we would share a Filipino delicacy which is hollow hollow which is ice and ice cream kinds of bits of jelly or stuff like that and they're huge things so that we would have to espamos and we would share the hollow hollow and at the end of that I would say nothing out the cup eat you have fun so I know that I know other things like ecao a guapa which means you are beautiful and ecao a guapa which means you are handsome and those are important tours in your armory of how to survive in the Philippines you know go a little bit fast parking the wrong place and I've got to get the hell out of here because the obvious right from now
