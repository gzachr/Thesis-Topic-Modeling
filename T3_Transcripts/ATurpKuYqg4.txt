be traveling from Manila Makati area over to  
Clark Pampanga Philippines where my family is 
from and hopefully it isn't raining over there  
but I'm really excited because I'll be taking 
the MRT train today which is the Metro Rail  
Transit here in the Philippines and I'll take 
you guys along with me in the journey let's go
it's almost like flooding okay Jollibee of course
it didn't eat yet but I want to make sure 
that I catch this train and not miss it  
since I'm here I don't know where the entrance 
is guys all right this is going to be a journey  
and I hope you guys can hear me because 
it's really loud here in Makati all right
Dunkin Donuts okay I think we're 
just gonna follow these people

going so follow the crowd

Clark Pampanga I think MRT yeah over there  
the MRT is the bus

okay so in order to go to the MRT the train you 
have to go out of here and climb the stairs and  
I'll show you guys where that is ah things 
always seem more hectic when it's raining
okay so guys we are going into the rain and 
we have to go up these stairs okay let's do it  
all right watch where I'm

this is an adventure guys look 
how much it's like flooding

now okay I'm not gonna buy a ticket yet  
because I wanna double check with the 
guard that I'm going the right way

and Dao Northbound so I believe  
we have to take a ticket to North Avenue
where do I go to North Avenue is 
North Avenue or Clark Pampanga Dao
North Avenue this one no my 
first time where do I go okay
the best thing you can do I wouldn't 
suggest asking a random stranger for  
directions when you're taking public transit 
sometimes I could give you wrong information  
so I always go straight to the workers or the 
security guards here okay let's buy my ticket
okay so I see the map here
foreign

here northbound North Avenue but there's no time
