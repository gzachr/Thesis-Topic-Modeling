 Future Friday. The freshest. Bitch. BITCH. BITCH. BITCH. BITCH. BITCH. BITCH. That's not bad. BITCH. BITCH. BITCH. BITCH. Filipino music industry does not surround with those mics. No. They're not gonna give you a split, bro. They're gonna give you their mic. BITCH. Beauty pageants. The Philippines is known for amazing beauty pageants and I think this is gonna put them into a brand new level of how I perceive them. They're contestants. I actually did like a whole singing performance. They're singing. I mean, what? Okay, I come from culture of beauty pageants, right? And then as well, it's very big for its beauty pageants. Actually, we're known globally for our beauty pageants, but which is really weird to me that to have the contestants have a whole singing performance. Yeah, that would never happen. What? Some of you tagged me on TikTok. Oh, there you go. Ah, she's gonna settle with her. It makes sense. It's just settle with her for several province. Everyone is in this business. But it again, but it again, sorry, sorry, go back, go back, go back. Because that first girl. That's very good. I love the director in the form. This is really nice. Someone saying here in the comments that Emanuele Vera was the rival of Sara Geronimo in the musical serie Idol. So some of them could actually sing. It's always tricky, right? Because he's the thing. This is a contest. A lot of people are more of videos. It's a contest, right? So like a beauty pageant. So it means his competitive nature. So if four of them pull out the singing card, these four, right, they're gonna leave an imprint in people. They're gonna be singing. But then say it's time to do like vocal show off. Ooh, the risk is too high, right? Just listen. Because he could flop. The thing is. That's what you're talking about. That's not good. Yeah, that's not what I was talking about. It's not good. There's no way to be singers. Neither are they claiming to be singers. So I have no fucking issue. Here's the thing. Here's the thing. This is why this is so important to me. Because you're seeing people, girls here. They are their main drive, their main focus. It's the competition. It looks easy. It's the looks. It's the walks. It's charming their way through freaking winning. And this is the, this is really tough. Patients are very hard. I don't understand them. And I always felt like, wow, they do it and it's fabulous. And like, they're able to be super women, you know, like I think is so cool. But singing in a competition that is not about singing. But then it's also competitive. So you're making it a thing about, you know, you're, it's hard. It's so Ricky bro. I want to listen to more. I want to see what's up. This is a different angle. Okay. The same thing. Okay. Just got it down. That's very sweet. I love it. That's it. Okay. Okay. That's it. Okay. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. That's very solid. That's very solid. People are good at singing. She has a nice text show. I am not mad at that. That's not bad. I think the problem with this is, is the group number. It should have be a group number. I don't understand, but I don't know. Less than keep singing. I know it's fucked because they're going to leave much more of an imprint and then people might vote more for it. I don't know. It's just an liberation though, isn't it? I don't actually. They'll vote. They'll vote. They'll vote. They'll vote. Do they know? This is the Gala. This is the graduate Miss Universe, Philippines 2023. I don't know how you work. It's the Gala. It's the Gala. The run. Do you know when they come out with cool, like the ball gowns and stuff? This is that. And they do a group singing number. Yeah, I thought about the group singing because those mics are actually on. The Philippines doesn't fuck up, but the Filipino music industry, the Filipino entertainment news. And the entertainment does not fuck around with those mics. No. They're not gonna give you a split, bro. They're gonna give you a mic. You know what? I actually don't think he's bad. I've just never been a big fan of group stuff where there's no actual singers. They might join you, they might not sing because it's gonna sound weird at some point. Also nerves, bro. Yeah, also a big one. But the five ladies that are singing, the four ladies, they can sing. Yeah. No bad. Yeah, it turns crazy. I think she's just very nervous. Oh, the lyrics. I think she's just very, very nervous. She's got it down, though. This girl. Oh, That's not bad. I mean. I just do any variables. It's not bad. There's just too many variables. I don't actually think it's bad. It's the mixing and the mastering and things and it's like each mic gain is different. I also think they're not singers. Like you have to take that into consideration. Of course. Yeah. I'm not taking credit away from that. I don't know if I'm sounding like a fucking dick at it. But it's like, it's just a group number of things. It's problematic. It's not that they're concerned because with a group number, they don't have, do they have any ears? I don't know. I don't think they have any. You know what? There's one girl. There's one girl that really has it down. What they have ears? I don't think so, bro. No, this is just rollo. I also don't think it's the biggest venue. So... Oh, you see, it's like... It's just too many voices at the same time. Although this girl also just got attitude. It's just... I'm also... So, make me... I should have believed. I love this girl. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, sorry. But this is a proud of Valid. This is a brilliant ending. Dude, somebody is absolutely going crazy throughout the whole... Yeah, somebody is going crazy throughout the whole time. Yes, they agree. And they also have the most games in the microphone. Do you know what? That's powerful. I have nothing against that. I like her. I like her. Is it the Sebuke... No, they won before. She did a solid there. That was solid. I'm saying the voice of Clash of the Universe Philippines. Yeah, literally. I've heard that this is the Clash of the Universe. Yeah, everybody was like... Everybody went there to show, bro. Everybody was like, okay, now this is the ending. Everybody do the runs. Everybody show them what you got, you know? I don't mind. Everyone's loving it on here. I don't think it's bad. I don't think it's bad. I just think I would be very nervous of this. If I was the director, I would be immensely tight here. This is... Group numbers don't usually go that well. That's why... This is tough, the session production was. What do you think when we compliment those people when there's a group number, like on Asap, or there's a group number and they bring out a choir? It's like that... The amount of variables. It's not that they're about singing. It's just too many variables. Life in the moment. And then these girls don't have the mileage of life singing. They don't have that. Maybe they sing karaoke, maybe they're good singers. Recreationally. But to do this number, that requires a fucking singer. Also, I also feel like there's... And there's... And you have to take something into consideration. There is time constraint for this event. They probably put this together the day off or the day before. And there is always so much pressure. Because obviously you're trying to put it... You're trying to put it on the best show. And when there's space for improvisation, things are bound to get a little leafy. And I think they did such a great job though. What do people think? Do you think people like this? Some people had very strong opinions. Some people sent me very strong worded. What did I say? About like, oh, they're trying to do something that they're not. And like, they were flat or whatever. And I genuinely don't think there was anything wrong with that. They were in tune. They were very strong. What's the showbiz? Correct. Correct. Welcome to showbiz. Welcome to showbiz. I also, you have to give them props. This is our thing. Entertainment is hard. And when you are welcomed into the world of entertainment, and you've never done shows like this before, it is very hard. I think also, I don't think they had much of a choice. I think it's probably like, you get given this and then happy days. And then some of them can actually sing. And then, what's the fun? Who's going to the Miss Universe then? The following 38 contestants. Who's the sebu citi girl? Oh, Emmanuel. Is that Sebu? That's the girl that... That was doing a solid there. And I think she's the one that also performed in the Teleserias Idol. Compining against Sara. Ah, that makes sense. Yeah, she's got solid. She's got a solid background there. Might as being her. Anyways. Nice stuff. I'm not mad at it. I like it. Same. And people who hate it and whatever. And people who hate it and whatever. If some people love that fine as well. I'm very much in the middle with this. I'm fine. If you remember, you didn't come for the singing. This was a surprise element to the whole thing. And what cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, me. And also, the fucking... The conist, the triad. I totally agree. I totally agree. Because it's like possible number. It's crazy. Good bye. Let us know what you think.
