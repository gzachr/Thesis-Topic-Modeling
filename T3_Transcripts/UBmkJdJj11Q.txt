 Good morning. What a beautiful day. Today we are going to finish assembling the tank. And yes I believe the best tank. But if you don't think it is the best one. I have seen many stainless steel around. And they have got the problem leaking. Some parts are not stainless steel. They just painted. So this is the best bed. I believe anyway. So give me your opinion if you agree. So today we are going to finish collecting the damp pipe to the tank. And hopefully we get some water. If this is filled up, I mean you go water for a long time for sure. So I am going already here preparing those pipes. I need to go back and finish my breakfast. I am a bit slow today. Oh you want a little brush? Little brush? Yeah. You can rest. Rest. I am starting to get so hot. It is free now so it is no bike anymore. I am going to do some things for sure. We got some funny pets now. And the chicken is looking better so it is good news. So we have some pipes to hang down from this. So the first water, if I may call that way, will go below the debris and things into this pipe. And then after it is filled up, just the water goes up and then down to the tank. That is what we are trying to do. Like I said, this is taking shape. Yeah, it is hot with one hand. You have to cut from the other side. So this is too thick. It is okay. And in the meantime, look what James is doing. Just decorating the porch. Beautiful. Yeah, I like it. Okay, let me look at the end result later on when it is finished. What do you think, baby? You love it? Did you like it? It is so beautiful and so smart. You saw her drawing yesterday. I thought to my wife, we give her another kiss. She is not going to draw anything. I was so wrong. Oh yeah, she knows how to ride. Look at this. Did you have to hold the pen? Yeah, very good. Oh, she loves it. You are going to draw daddy soon. Very good. She is so serious. Yeah, you like mommy. Turn around mommy. She wants to ride at the top day. She is still cute. Oh, no, no, no. She is trying to keep that thing. This is the sun. This is what Rose has been put on the back burner. I guess the take is priority number one. We need water. But that has become priority number one now. We are going to have some barbecue lunch time. It is going to spoil our people and workers. And I was so, I guess. And I love you like barbecue. She is so cute. She always keeps us all busy. But touch everything, explore everything. Yeah, we are very proud of her. You finished? Not quite. Looking good. We get it. The small daddy is ready. But this 400 pesos is the market. Big market in deeper log. Okay, so you burn a plastic bottle cap, which is very flammable. I don't have a thought about it. I just put 10 gold. Oh, something like this. Maybe it's not yet gone. Oh, yeah. Oh my God. The circle of the sun. You got a pen ready? I hold up there and you mark. You see? Okay. You bring the. You spin up? Yeah. You bring the. Yep. Okay, very straight. It's okay. If it's glue, it's not going to be a problem. Okay, very straight. It's okay. Yep. It's going down here. We need a bit of a slop. Yeah, no problem. Okay. You don't have to buy any hose clamp. If you've got a tin roof, you've got a left over. You can make your own, no problem. We're spoiling our workers. You got it. You need to get it. Okay. I came to get a drink and that's not so nice. Vegetable, I'm sure. We'll seal it around. We have lunch. We're going to take a shower in the dark. To show us the way. I don't have the boys. Good girl, I'm going to cut your flesh. You're present for you. Still a baby. But maybe still too big. No, she's going to piss there. You want to go to the road? She's happy here. Looking good. Maybe we put a support there somewhere. Get in there. Beautiful. Okay, that's it done. Do a bit of a painting after. But, other than that, you just wait for the run now. I'm going to cut it. I'm going to cut it. I'm going to cut it. I'm just about to eat guys. So, that's it. I'll set it myself whenever I eat pork. When I saw this barbecue, very nice. Sorry, not died today. Come on guys, enjoy. Grantee rice. Put more, put more. So, you got news from the mountain, your parents about chicken, ishing. Message is good now. It's good. Okay, good news. You got some visitors. What's up my name? My name is James brother. How good? Very good. Okay. I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. I'm going to eat. Okay, I came here to buy some pant. Go to the roof. Some as a house. Okay, I'm trying to get this gatta down and I'm here. So, see if those people will come and give me a price on a 14 inch long gatta. Show the sketch here. Okay, I need to buy some hollow blocks for the upper tank. Just a little bit much and some rebar. Go go, we'll do the base of the tank. That's a smaller tank, it goes on the carpet. Carp work. It's my roof coming. I just got a few corrugate iron sheets as well. And a couple of rebars for the upper tank base. So plenty of work. It's going to run this way. That's okay. It's good. My tank is ready now. Okay, then let's go home now. I'm so happy we've burned all this crap we had here for a long time. Excellent. We need to have everything tidy like this. Still a fair bit of work to clean around. I will do that with a grass cutter. And we've burning some or rubbish here. It's good. Good job, Gong Gong. What is he? Look, I got all this rubbish. Excellent. Nice fire. Can't wait to house finish, old yard around or clean up. Nice and clean. Still a lot of work, but that's okay. Keep us in good shape. Yep, put timber. 3 cents. Okay, I got to download the car. Only 5, because I want to see if it's okay. It's a hollow problem. It's okay. Make room for the tank. What do I call a green? Sandish? Sand. Green? Yeah, green baguio. Think where you put? Here you need to clean here. So, don't put here. Maybe... Okay, that's it for today, guys. Talk to you in the morning. This is really a time part of the eyes.
