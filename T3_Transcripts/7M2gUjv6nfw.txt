 Hi, my name is Guja, welcome back to my channel, welcome to my channel, this is Landa Diro from the very first time. Okay, since after reacting to the mall of Asia, I am still not over it, frankly, because Philippines is literally changing the meaning, definition of a storm mall to me, literally a theme park in a mall in St. and today we will be seeing something even more in St. Nanda, yes, it's going to be again making it happen log and when we see in St. Filipino mall, I completely agree with this title that they have got seriously every mall in St. Nanda, foreigners react to a Venice Grand Canal mall in BGC Manila Philippines.

I'm like, oh my god, yay, they know what I speak. But let's just go and see in Saint Philippine a mall. Venice Grand Mall. Grand Canal mall. Okay, I don't know. The thumbnail just looks in Saint itself. I don't know what to say. It's insane. Just crazy. Okay, we just watched this. Back. Play. No. Sorry. Play. Finally now. Don't go to Europe, come to the Philippines. Okay. Okay. Where love is key. When I meet what on earth is going on. What is this? Oh, yes. That is it. It's been to Venice. Oh, wow. What an amazing experience. Are you out of your mind? That was inside of a mall. This is pretty recent, I guess, because I haven't seen Ben have intro before, I think. Insane one day? Okay, whatever. Let's just go for watching it first. Venice Grand Canal mall. Look how beautiful it's made. Wow. It's on earth is going on. Exactly. Hey, what is up guys? We've been busy all day and we knew we weren't going to be able to make a vlog today. So this evening we decided to come out to this place if you got recommended to us, which is the Grand Venice Mall. This is insane. I know. Are we in Venice? Now this is better than. I've been to Venice. 12. Maybe even three times. I have seen the Venice Canal. This is so beautiful and it's a mall in the Philippines. I know. We came here just because we didn't know what to do this evening. Okay. So we just spontaneously came out here and we just walked in not expecting much but I wasn't expecting. Thus it's so damn beautiful. How can this be like? I know. What is this? In the evening. In the evening. We're just going to spend our evening here because it's on all day. I can just stay where he is right now for the whole day. I have never come here. I have no idea. Look at those guys. Wow. How cool. What are you even talking about? What is this? Oh seriously. This is, oh he was very nicely done. The f***. I'm not even washing it right in front of me. I'm not even washing it right in front of my eyes but it's still absolutely insane. So I have to go. Actually like putting on a nice dress. Yes. I'm having a date night on one of these gondolas. If I ever go there now, I know. We have a date night on a gondola without the night. What do I have to go? Look at the. Wow. Wow. Gondola right tickets. Hello. Hello. We'd like to take a day off. It's in Baccao as well right? I think so because I've seen we got married by a Chinese tea went to place like this. Would you like to go to the wine please? Oh my god. Oh this is in a mod. So cool. We got tickets for the gondola and you can actually buy a ticket which includes wine. Oh. It's better than Venice. You're not going to have to go anywhere else. I want to ride with my own boat to ourselves. Really awesome. Oh my god. Oh add. Three, two, one. Oh my god. Are you out? I can't believe this. I don't know what to say. I'm just speechless. Oh my god. It's so beautiful. How? We'll find out. This is. Wow. Wow. That's all I can say. Wow. What do these people eat? You have such ideas when they construct design, this type of things. What do they eat? What do you guys eat? Oh my god. Look at that. Oh. Wow. All the fairy lights. When you're under the bridge they should kiss right? It's a thing. Oh my god. I don't know. I just how many days do I need to keep if I ever go to the Philippines? I can just spend one whole day in a mall. Wow. What an amazing experience. I know. I know. It's talking Italian here. I feel like an Italy. No reason to fly to Europe. You can just stay here. Don't fly to Europe. Come to the Philippines. Yes. Wow. This is so amazing. I don't know. This was such a good decision that we came here today. Oh my god. I'm not going to show you guys on the vlog. But then we had the idea to come here. This is much better, I think. We would not have expected some like this. The fairy lights has my heart. Okay. I love them. So romantic. You can see the smile on my face. Yes. On my face. I'm not even there. We are absolutely blown away. Oh my god. I only think that could tap those whole situation. Delicious, maybe Italian food. Oh yeah. It's vegan. Oh ramen. Wow. Any food is fine. Any food is fine. Just like this picnic box when you're traveling with the wine. I don't drink. But when it calls for a situation like a second try. I've actually entered the mall for the first time besides buying our tickets. Okay. And it's very beautiful in here as well. The lighting is stunning. Look at those slits. Oh. And I do really think that we're going to find some great Italian food here. There's a lot of really nice looking restaurants out here. So. Okay. Hello. Hello. How sweet. So we've walked into this cute little Italian restaurant right next to the Venice Canal. Beautiful. I've just ordered our two classes of white wine and we are going to enjoy it. Wow. It feels like it really feels like an Italy. Wow. So nice. So so nice. Oh. Oh. The finest water from the Venice Canal. Oh. It should have done that right when you were in. Look at the canal. Like under when you pass under. That's what I've seen. I don't know. I've seen it in movies. Don't blame me. All right. My dish came out already. It is a huge, huge portion. No complaints. Don't know why it stopped, but here we go. A fresh grilled pepper. Fresh grill. Oh, it looks nice to see the look at that. Nice. Okay, add again. Three, two, one. Oh. Oh. I'm just not over the canal. Okay. All those things would not even make sense to me. No. Okay. That's... It's hard right. And it's good. That is very nice. Very nice. Oh. I think the delicious sauce is spot on. Oh, this is really nice. Nice. All right, turn. I think it's no malleys. I'm edited for the review show because... Uh. Okay. Just not... Not? Yeah, it is. It is. I just not funny today. I don't know. Oh, it's okay. Really have a pressure of feeling like we can find me or something. Yeah. Very good. Thank you. It's so good. Oh, yeah. It's so easy to like, you know, we had a really nice date night. Unexpected. I know. Yeah. Cheers to that. This is the first time on the back. We're also rolling a bus. Italian places. Let us know. We need to find more restaurants. We need to eat more in new places. Yes. And that is no tool. Very diverse. So if it's a place for, I don't know, Indian food or sushi or Italian food. Come to India. We're out. It's been a food. Oh, whatever. Let us know in the comments below. That's right. We just love to explore new places. I'm really happy we came here because usually when we come to Manila, we know our favorite spots. We go there. We know it's good. Yeah, because you have traveled a so many times. There are so many good restaurants out there. Where do they stay?
