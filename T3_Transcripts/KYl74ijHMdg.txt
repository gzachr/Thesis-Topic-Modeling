 Hi. Huh? The kids over there? It's just like thank you for having me. Did they say they look good? Look how kids are shouting just walked over there and was hanging out. What did they say to you? They said to me, thank you for coming here but I just can't say thank you enough for them to have me. I'm going to have a drink. 9 a.m. on what is going to be another super-enigod. I'm back on the coast in Katio. I turned off the vlogging for a little while. I had a wonderful anniversary trip with Threen and Baraka. We just hung out, enjoyed the area. I played some beach tennis. Anyways, you can see there's a big debris line here. This is the high tide mark on the beach. A little like sticks and a little bit of driftwood and coconuts and things. All the way up along the beach. But because the moon is quite big right now, low tide will go way, way, way out. That means it's also a perfect time for us to finally go and hang out at the sand bar. Jundi and Tuti are surfing right now. I'm drinking a hot coffee on a hot morning and we have some Australian friends who have been here too. So I think today might be their last day. So we're going to hang out. Take them around a bit. We're going to sweat. I picked a beer. Saturday up. Oh my gosh. Do you fly for us? You have a lot for us. Nice run. Look at that. What a legend. The loadies are back. The loadies are back, but we'll catch up with them in a few days because that's been worked for a while. Ah, it's over. Taxi them in it. The planer. The dreaded planer. Here's the platform to enjoy. Our water 36 engineview is already on the right. So you can usbe around it. You get, you get, you get. You got rules, you could下 kick down, you know?

Okay, cool, cool, cool. So this afternoon, we're going to take them on a sand bar mission because the tides are super cool. We'll get to know them later a little bit, so you can also see because he's involved in quite a bit too. I like it, we're traveling sticks. Oh, hi. Oh, hi. I'm going to be a man. Yeah, okay.
