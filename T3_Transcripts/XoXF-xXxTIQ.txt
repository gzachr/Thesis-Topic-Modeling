 Have you ever wondered what the food is like at a Filipino holiday potluck? Up first we have crispy bata, which is a fried pork dish. The skin on this fried pork is absolutely perfect. You also have to eat it with rice. This is one of my favorite dishes ever. I'm giving this a 9.5 out of 10. Next up we have a Filipino noodle dish called Bonset. Super solid. I'm always going to heat some at the potluck. I'm giving it a 7.5 out of 10. Here we have a 7 layer Mexican inspired bean dip. It's a nice little side dish to have if you're having a beer or something like that. And it's really good. So I'm giving this a 8 out of 10. Here we have another Filipino appetizer called Ducuat, which is pretty much fried tofu. This sauce honestly carries it so hard, so this is a 7 out of 10. This is one of my Tita's signature holiday dishes. It's called Bake Mac. So it's pretty much a macaroni version of spaghetti a little bit. I don't know how to explain it, but it is so good. This gets a 9 out of 10. And of course what is a Filipino party without a lumpia? This is probably the most signature dish that Filipinos are known for. And for good reason, it is so bomb I'm giving it a 10 out of 10.
