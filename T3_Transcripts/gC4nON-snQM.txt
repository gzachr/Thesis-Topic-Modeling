our tour of the province of romblon is coming 
to an end we had a great time in the adrenaline  
island of carabao and i think tablas has become 
our favorite island in the philippines so far  
if you guys haven't seen those videos please do 
check them out but now it's time to head to manila  
where we give you guys our first impressions of 
the big city to get there we've come to romblon
the marvel capital of the 
philippines philippines you got it
it's here we've got to get a 15-hour boat ride now 
romblon ron blonde is very famous for its beaches  
you've probably heard of the famous bonbon 
beach but we're going to show you guys  
a different side to this island and this is us 
going off the beaten path looking for some hidden  
gems we have the owner meeting carlos from stone 
creek house and smokehouse restaurant who helped  
us find a local guide and organize our tour so 
thank you so much carlos we highly appreciate it  
guys this is mark mark's going to be touring us 
around the island today yeah so we're in mark's  
hands looking forward to it yeah should 
we do this yeah let's go okay let's go
okay you made it to the first stop the road 
is literally littered with marble i mean  
we've literally been out of town for about 
two minutes so we've done the first stop  
it's unbelievable it's just marvel have you ever 
seen so much so much smelly i've never seen so  
much marble just on the road just laying on the 
road literally five minutes off from blonde town  
up the road and there's marble everywhere they've 
used marble even to build like big walls and stuff  
everyone has a piece of marble in their house so 
the marble here is arguably the best in the world  
i think maybe the italians might might argue that 
a little bit let's go and find out i'll tell you  
the story later here they shape cut and form 
the marble into beautiful works of art and as  
they cut through the big blocks of marble white 
dust covers the trees and tells them snow white
i think i'm gonna be snow white soon
the island too continues we're going for a little 
road trip around rumble to see how's life like on  
the island and so far you see plenty of marble 
queries and less greeneries it's beautiful
we just stopped buy a big one this one is and 
amazon literally pulling it out of the mountains  
and i have to climb on top of one of them 
come stand on top of a marble rock with me  
it's a great feeling
we've been riding through the hills and oh my god 
it's so lush and green and for some reason when  
it's cloudy and rainy the mountain is the cozier 
so we just got to another mill where they're  
making it's where they turn the big rocks into 
almost tile sizes as you can see there there's  
loads and loads of loads of tiles and we're going 
to take you inside to show you how to cut it shape  
it and polish it so you didn't know you was going 
to get a lesson in marble making today did you  
every day's a school day with us i was very 
nosy trying to look and so they said come come  
they invited us to come and see what they 
are doing how are they cutting the marble
this is why you need one of those fancy aprons
it's good yes too much marvelous
it's better yes now let me tell you the story 
about rumblings marvel industry roblon is world  
famous and i'm a very curious person so i was 
digging to find out the story about the marble  
obviously and i heard rumors that italian used to 
buy marble from rumble enceletes but the truth is  
that international businesses bought marble from 
romblon and claimed that it's italian marble  
now that makes more sense to me let's find 
out what are the prices for the marble here  
so the necklaces and the bracelets are between 25 
and 50 peso in a souvenir you know approximately  
the size of probably my hand is around 400 pesos 
a mug is around 200 pesos it's very cheap very  
very cheap for the work that goes into it and 
the design they do the time it's very cheap  
now i've spotted some marble plates and these are 
definitely my favorite piece of arc i'm curious to  
find out how much they cost this one is 550 pesos 
beautiful beautiful piece of ark and i didn't  
expect it to be heavier but it's actually not 
it's a nice nice weight it has a nice weight to it
looks like we can get in what i like 
about it it's on top of the hill  
and you can see the little town on 
the bottom and it looks quite pretty
so the fort of san andreas 
was built back in the 1700s  
it was by the spanish of course who um built 
this protect the island it's a great view up here  
it's only a short walk it's quite steep but i'm 
not sure when the spanish built it they realized  
300 years later it would just 
become a kid's playground
thank you
let's show you the vibes 
around romblanc place your bare
have feet
been found if i told you  
you won't have to worry about
i am here
hello what are you saying this

friendly vendors selling their goods 
here it's a typical filipino market
just had a message from dawn of 
smoke he's been smoking meat all day  
and invited us to try some 
of his delights i can't wait
i've been doing my thing
if you have experience and passion for hospitality 
and you love to travel carlos from smoke  
restaurant in stone creek house is running a work 
and stay program at the moment we're going to pop  
his contact details below and you can get in touch 
with him directly our stay in room vlog has come  
to an end so it's a little bit busy here it's a 
little bit full on but the bautu batangas lives  
only twice a week we are making our way to manila 
and we have so many good things planned for you  
but before that we have a 15 hour boat trip i'm 
not sure how this is gonna go that's the longest  
i've been on a boat it's so happening here as i 
say this only happens twice a week and you can't  
purchase your tickets in advance so you need to 
come early in the morning to buy your tickets  
sorry i'm crossing we've got our tickets uh 
we bought them this morning we left our bags  
here with one of the porters so we're gonna go 
find our bugs now life goes up and it goes down  
i know my mom taught me that i figured why are we 
fooling around so little now i'm glad i paid the  
cheaper tickets for the non-air conditioner one 
because i can imagine the air conditioning one  
is closed and i don't like clothes faces 
this one at least you can get fresh air  
i don't know what i was worried about this 
is like a like a five-star luxury hotel  
that's actually okay much better than i expected 
they put these bunk beds and basically if you're  
with a stranger you need to sleep next to the 
stranger which is funky but hey it was well and  
pretty comfortable to be honest with you we have 
a quick stop at batangas we have one hour here  
so we're gonna go grab some food and continue the 
journey it's raining and it's been raining for the  
past few days the ocean is quite serious they said 
we have one hour but i'm feeling a little nervous  
to spend one hour here if the boat leaves without 
us right now it's east and the next boat is gonna  
be in probably two weeks time there's a few 
little shops here and i managed to find some  
sort of a corn snack i'm gonna survive the 
boat is still here and that's always good news
hey it's like 2 20 in the morning and we've just 
called the bus make sure if you're going to manila  
make sure that you get off the boat quite quickly 
and you get rid of us because you might miss the  
bus and there was quite a few people waiting for 
the next one i mean you don't want to be waiting
but yeah we're going to manila now we've got 
about two hours a bus ride so see you there
