 Music Good morning! Good morning! Mm-hmm. I got some home I got. Yes! Awesome! I'm going to have to learn that. Anyhow, so in the West we don't really use the term wet market. And many people, because of the media and everything, hear that word and they think, well, that's where you buy bats. So that's really not true. Maybe in some cases, some places, somewhere in the world. But that's not a thing. Not a thing here anyway. We're going to go for the very first time to a Philippines wet market. Never been looking forward to it. We got a little party coming up soon, so we're going to be needing some supplies anyway. So time to go find out what it's all going to cost. And let's see, what a wet market is all about here. Well, it's a bit of a weight today for an e-trike. We haven't had any come bites for ones that are booked for private tours. And she doesn't ride bikes. If I'm driving, she will, but not if I think somebody else is driving. So it's a bit of a weight. Sometimes in the afternoon, we give up after about an hour. If nobody comes, is this end of it? We're at the end of the island. So not many people come down this way. They try to stay in the tourist area downtown. So you're surprised that we can still go. Do you notice something a little bit different? We are wearing different clothes. Yesterday, we waited a very long time for the e-trike. It got extremely hot. It was getting too late in the morning. There are no grabs out here, unfortunately. So if one doesn't come, you don't go. So we're making another attempt at 7.30 this morning. So earlier than yesterday, we yesterday was about 8.30. And we're hoping today we'll have better luck. We got it. Great success. It got to eat success. We'll go back because there were people waiting, like not too far. But they wouldn't look up when we were trying to wave them down. They'd be like, come on. I'm enjoying this. We have no problem with other people coming. But now another one would look up. They kept looking at their phones. We had to go. We have made it. Burakai, Nali Papa. I think that's the right. And this is the big wet market that ever since we got here, everybody said, you have to go here. Do you like fresh fish? Do you like fresh meat? Do you like fresh vegetables? Here we go. That's an inside joke, dude. Probably worth it, yeah. I like this. I'm a lot of shop. Not the vegetables. I'm a lot of shop. I'm a lot of shop. I'm a lot of shop. Not the vegetables. New backpack? Got backpack. Hello. Got lots of hats. Let's do it. Do you want some for us? Simpsons? Simpsons. Totally me. I love water, Nali. All right, the whole short, dude. Look at that. Black rice, red rice, split rice. Wow. All right, that's right. Okay, I'm going to be honest. I have never been to a wet market ever. Have you? No, not a real wet market. I've been to a fruit market, vegetable market, but never a wet market. Wow. That is a lot. I like it. I brought these. Hello, how are you? Good. Thank you so much. Our first time in a wet market. Hello, how are you? Fine. No, no, no. What's the meat? And the vegetables are in the ice cup. Look at all the meat. What's your pig's head? You're going to fly. Yeah, there's a few flies to be expected. Look at all the fish here. Whoa, squid. Wow, look at the size of these. Look at those ones. Incredible. And look at this. I'm going to guess, tilapia. Probably. What kind of fish? One, two, three. What type of fish? Tilapia? Tilapia. Tilapia. Look at them all. 150 pesos. $3. That's a really great fish. Look at these guys. What is that? Red snapper. Wow. And this one? This one. Here's my wife. She can hear better. He's going to tell you what that is. Rainbow? No. Red snapper. Red snapper. Red snapper. But that one again? Atafis. Paro fish. Paro fish. Paro fish. Wow. And that's the same? This is this? Okay. Wow, look at them. They're so big. I think that's pure. I'm not a fish expert. I'm the one that eats the fish. I don't know about this. You need to meet them. Learn their names. Let's go. Look at the size of that one. Oh, my fish. Oh, my fish. Good because he prepares them as well. Oh, my god. What? Look at this. I was going to size of those ones. What are? I have no idea. It's like sardines that have you two. The thing? They're fun, pretty, actually. What is this? That's swordfish. Okay. Shiny that is. Do you need a mirror? I have one now. They're like chrome tires or something. Yeah. It's cool. I've never ever seen so much fish in one place. And many fish have never even seen in my life. I'm not the big fish eater to be quite honest. I just don't like the bones to be really honest. So if she takes them out, I'll eat them. But... I'm going to do that for me. Yeah, I'm going to buy some. I'm excited. Fantastic. So yeah, once we look around, then we'll come back and we'll buy. So we're not walking around with food that could go bad. So that's important. And there's some dry fish. We can find that everywhere here though. That's very common. Where are you from? Are you from Burakay? Always? Born here? Fantastic. Every day, right here. With always pork? Yeah. No option. You're the pork guy. No, the old, everyday, everyday. Yeah. I love your cutting block. Look at the size of that thing. Oh yeah. Yeah, that's great. Just take a layer off. Really fun fact is a few friends of ours here. What they do is they'll catch the fish and then they'll bring it home, slice it and put it on their roof. And a few hours later in the sun, dried fish, ready to go. Really easy to prepare. Look, we got the chickens over here. I'm baking supplies here. Look at all the chickens. Chickens and eggs. Look at all those chickens. They even have a baking supplies store, which is awesome because I was struggling if you watch the cake making video to find ingredients. So they're right here. They're all right here. Cookies and potatoes. Yep. Oh, they're matcha. Yeah, I need this after. They're matcha. You all need their matcha. Oh, look at this. Look at this. What? The size of that crab. That's awesome. All right, run away with him. And how much is that? Maybe 1 to 1 kilo. 1,200, didn't you? 1,200 per kilo. And how many kilos do you think that is? Well, let's find out. He's got a scale. He's about a kilo, I think. Yeah, he's about a kilo. So that's about $24, right? 1,200 pesos? Yeah, he's just hair under 1 kilo. So maybe $22. Yeah, maybe $22. Yeah, there you go. So about $22 for a crab. I've never bought crab, so I have no idea. Yeah. And what are these? Oh, look at them. Look at these guys. Yeah, you would eat the heck out of them. Oh, they're shrimp. Oh, the last same size. What's the shrimp? These are shrimp too? These are also really big. And what is this? Oyster. Okay. I've never seen them not prepared in a restaurant before, so that's really cool. I'm shocked at shrimp. I don't know. That's not right. I don't eat that. No, I think not. But thank you.
