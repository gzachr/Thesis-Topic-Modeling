Hello, how are you?
Hello, how are you?
Very good.
Do you have a boyfriend?
No.
And what do you think would be the problems with an ex-boyfriend?
I was not expecting some of these answers.
Hello, how are you?
Hello, very good.
What's your name?
My name is Xiomara.
My name is Xiomara.
Nice to meet you.
What are you eating?
Ice cream.
How is it?
It's delicious.
Where are you from?
I'm from Medellin.
Villa Vicencio, Colombia.
Do you like Medellin?
I love it.
I have a question about your opinion about foreigners and men from the United States, England, places like that.
Is that okay?
At first, do you have a boyfriend?
Yes.
That's sad.
So where is your girlfriend from?
She's from England.
England? And you?
From the United States.
So why do you have foreign boyfriends?
Why don't you have local boyfriends?
In my opinion, I've dated some Colombians and in my experience, it hasn't been very good.
No? Why not?
With Joe, I feel that I have a little more freedom.
He's a little more gentleman.
They're not so possessive.
And obviously, the culture is much more different.
Joe is your boyfriend?
Yes.
Okay, I understand. And you?
Well, the boyfriends I've had from Colombians, the experiences have been very good.
Most of them have been good.
Something that I like a lot, that I don't see a lot in Colombian men, is that they seem like safer men.
They're not so dramatic.
That's something I like a lot.
They're in their world and they make you, as a woman, be focused in your world.
And you're not looking for problems or insecurities or jealousy.
I feel that they can also be no more faithful, but I don't know, I think they're in their world.
They're not bothering with one girl or another girl.
They're not so coquettish.
They're not so coquettish, in reality.
Like the Latino culture.
Okay.
So what are the worst things about your foreign boyfriends?
I would say that the worst...
Disagreement.
Disagreement of what?
They tend to be more...
With Colombian men, they tend to be more intense.
So one is used to that.
Used to that.
To being written to all the time.
Yes.
Things like that.
And they're not so attached.
But I like that, because it's like, I don't know, they're doing their thing.
So they're not wasting time.
But it's the same, because they make you feel safer.
So you don't need to be on top of yourself all the time.
That's something that's good.
Yes.
I don't think there's anything in general that's worse.
But something that's not the best at the beginning of a relationship.
Especially when they're two completely different languages.
Two cultures.
It's like understanding that cultural change.
That what's normal for a person is normal for a Latino.
Maybe not.
And vice versa.
I think that's the most critical point sometimes.
They're a little more sensitive.
We, as Latinos, have a point of view to say.
That things sound a little more ugly or hard.
So they get angry very quickly.
Or when what you're actually saying isn't really strong.
It's just the way we express ourselves.
It's the theme of cultures.
Hello, how are you?
Hello, how are you?
Very well.
What's your name?
Marcela.
Marcela?
Nice to meet you, Marcela.
Nice to meet you.
Where are you from?
Medellin, Colombia.
Wait.
There's a gringo here.
What does a gringo do?
He makes cocktails.
Oh, it's mint?
They have rosemary.
Of course.
Would you have an extrovert boyfriend?
Yes.
And what do you think would be the problems with an extrovert boyfriend?
That a lot of girls like him.
How do you say it?
Don't you think there would be a cultural problem with an extrovert boyfriend?
No.
Do you speak English?
No.
Don't you think there would be a problem that you don't speak English?
No.
So would you have a boyfriend that doesn't speak Spanish?
No, he would have to speak some Spanish.
I'm studying English.
You want to learn English?
At that moment, I study English every day.
Hello, how are you?
I'm fine, how are you?
Where are you from?
Medellin, Colombia.
Oh, very good.
Would you prefer to live in Colombia or the country of your husband?
Colombia.
Would you have a boyfriend or an extrovert boyfriend?
Definitely.
Well, it depends on the country, but I like Colombia a lot.
It's a country where I like it, I like the people, I like Colombia.
How is your English?
My English is good, I think.
So we could have done this interview in English.
You don't have problems with communicating with your boyfriends.
No, that's another thing that I think most couples have trouble with,
because the communication is not really good.
But I understand perfectly what he said to me, what he thinks,
or how he wants to express it, and I understand perfectly.
But I think it's most the way how I speak to him,
that he thinks most of the time I'm angry,
and that's why I think the Latin women are always more temperamental
or angry all the time.
But it's not that, we are just more straight to it.
Okay, directo, mas directo.
It's a thing that in most of your country, USA or England,
people try to say things more soft, so to not offend people,
but we are not really that...
You're direct.
Yes, exactly.
We say that, if you don't like it, it's okay.
If you like it, it's okay.
We don't really...
That's what...
We don't really have problems about that, we just say that.
And if you get mad, you're like...
Like that.
And how is your English?
Wait!
You can't respond in English?
That's an art, because her boyfriend speaks really good Spanish.
Yeah.
My boyfriend doesn't speak Spanish at all.
I try, but I'm not really that passionate.
Oh, okay.
Oh, okay.
Okay, entiendo.
It's comfortable, yes.
Exactly, it's comfortable.
Okay.
Well, I have a lot to introduce,
so thank you very much for your time, for your interview.
With pleasure.
Bye, much gusto.
