 We got some karaoke right here, but we have some Filla pain karaoke to throw a little twist at it. So let's get into it and really they had a few drinks and stuff like that. A little get together a party. I'm so excited. It's gonna be a good time. Y'all already know what I'm about to say. Y'all already know what I'm about to say. Can every Philippine person in the Philippine say, why is there so much talent in the Philippines, man? This guy voices crazy and he's probably not even an artist. He can sing. He make it sound so easy, but if I had that mic and I was trying to sing that song, y'all be like, toes in my, what are you singing? What are you singing? It's forever. Whoo! Oh, that. Let's go back a little bit. Just a little bit. There's no way you just hit that high note. And that's finally on your self forever. That's what friends are. Oh, you're being mean. Friends. Thank you very much. So, let's see what you give it open to me. Okay. Okay. Okay. We went from a very powerful voice in the beginning to a raspy voice to a more deep in the mood voice. One more time. Shout to the Philippines. He had to step back because he hit that note so crazy. Man said, let me step back. That's sensational. Oh, it's fine. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. Oh, we've been touched and went to sorry on your self forever. Oh, give that to friends forever. You smile, you shine, no, you can't always. On a real notice. If anyone from this little get together, whatever this is, if anyone's in this video, make sure to invite me next time. Make sure to invite me next time. I'm there. Stop the cap. No, you can always stop making sure. Okay. No, no. That guy with that bucket hat on, he sings. He, he sings. No, he makes, he makes music. I know he makes music. I just know it. I just know it. Something telling me that he make music. I feel it. I feel it. I feel it. I feel it. He does make music. He just not, he just not that big yet. He makes music. Honestly, they might all make music. It might be a whole, they might be a whole secret band I don't even know about. That's the friends I love. He's nothing. Ain't no point. Boy, I feel it. I'm telling you, he makes music. Okay. No regular person could hit that note like that. No, I don't care who you are. No regular person can sing like this. That's the friends I love. He's nothing. He's nothing. Don't we you can always. No, bro. You don't even know why I'm laughing at it. I'm laughing at it because he's actually getting a lot of attention. He's giving 100%. That was a lie right there. That was a lie. That was a lie. That was crazy. That was crazy. That was crazy. That was crazy.
