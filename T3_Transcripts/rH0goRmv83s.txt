that was just a very corny joke guys but uh 
i'm going to make a special beef tapa today  
and i will bring it to my sister!
yes i said the special version because 
i'm going to use a good quality  
sirloin that i bought at the farm the other day 
this is a good quality meat i'm going to slice it  
thin just like that so it looks like a lot more 
meat now it has quite a bit of fat so that's a  
very tasty i'm going to add this to the bowl and 
the second step is pork meat so i'm gonna combine  
this with a beautiful piece of pork now this 
pork has a bone i wonder if you also do this in  
the philippines if you mix different kind of meats 
for tapa or adobo let me know in the comments okay
and i know in the philippines they often say 
it's okay lang you can do whatever you like  
but of course i'm trying to cook real filipino 
food but just a little bit of an invention here  
again i'm slicing this pork very thinly see  
so i'm scraping that last meat off of the 
bone see i think there's a lot of flavor there  
and look who's there Pogi so i'm going 
to marinate the pork and the beef  
so i'm going to add a little bit of oil okay 
this is just sunflower oil just a tiny bit
mixing sugar okay just a little bit of sugar  
we'll add suka okay white vinegar i will not 
add too much and a little bit of soy sauce
like that black pepper i love black pepper then 
of course bawang so i'm gonna chop some bawang  
few cloves  
okay finally i will add secret a little bit of 
coca-cola not too much i'm gonna add just a little
bit then massage lang okay just a 
little bit of massage some hilot
we're massaging all the flavors in okay and 
that's our marinade we're gonna leave this  
for approximately 20-30 minutes and 
then we will fry it a little bit of
oil
there we go
so i've put the heat a little bit higher now just  
just toss it around a little 
bit and the meat is almost ready
so let's see the filipino food reaction 
of my sister so we're on the way  
and it starts to rain so it was a really 
good timing for cooking in the garden
okay so we're here and i'm gonna 
make sinangag first so we have garlic
this is the beef tapa you can smell it 
already oh oh that smells good what's in it  
there's a lot of garlic and also many 
other things there's even coca-cola oh wow
do you use this in the 
philippines this one for bawang  
i didn't see this one otherwise i would 
have used it we call it knoflookpers in  
Dutch we'll add the bawang first so this is 
called sinangag it's just fried garlic rice
it is um garlic with rice and a little bit of 
salt that's it okay brown the garlic a little  
bit not too much and then i'll add all the rice 
the cooked rice and then do you have salt right
little bit of salt yeah enough
some egg
you can put it in the microwave so that's the 
beef tapa so this is organic meat from the farm  
beef and pork and it has coca-cola okay 
we'll add the beef tapa to the sinangag
and some fried onions beef tapa  
special version with pork smells so 
good i hope you like it i'm gonna try
yes still hot be careful is it liquid
very good oh yes nice

yeah next is dessert and that is leche flan
