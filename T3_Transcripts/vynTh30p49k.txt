 So we're going to go out today, choose some land for sale here in Lati. 1000 square meter. And certainly something we're definitely interested in. This really is a really good option this. So it's beautiful sunny day in my infant's eye. So we're going to go out today, choose some land for sale here in Lati. It's close to where we are in Ormock City. It's something we're very interested in. And you might be as well, we're sharing with you exactly what it's going to be. Me, you can hear me. She's really, I think it's that time. It's crying out, she misses me. Probably. Mrs. Bite of Me. Oh, I was like you meowing aside. I mean the garden's just like being left alone at the moment. Oh, beautiful girl, me. It's on our way to look at a beach resort for sale here in Murida in Lati. That's where the man is. So is it up from the tree to the end? Yeah, to the end. Then, straight up by the red net. Oh yeah. Oh, a straight back again, is it? Straight by the, you know, but that house that included. No, no. So just straight. Where that door goes, that we go for a straight until by this wall. Okay, so it's quite good size. It's 1,198 square meter. It's quite big then. Not sure the price, I'll catch that in a minute. But it's great. So it's like to the water edge. It's great if you want a beach slot in the Philippines in Lati. And certainly something we're definitely interested in. We're all looking for an investment property, something we can develop, something for a bit more passive income. This is definitely a very, very good option. It's really nice. It's really nice. It's really nice. It's quite easy to get to, quite close to where we live. We'll dump all of them. We're only about a 30 minute drive. Really not far at all. So, James, I think you're shitting about the price at the moment. We have our house in Omox City, our lot in Kananga. And definitely we're looking at other options for investment. It's a good location. It needs a bit of a tidy of the beach. I may not look the cleanest at the moment. The sand is really quite fine. But we've built a wall here. Definitely built a wall. We've got a gate, a fence. We've built a little house if you wanted or a resort. It's definitely could be a good investment. A lot of options when it comes to landing investment like this. Something here. But on the sea, definitely always an interest. Not the sea. Not the lift by the sea. Our house isn't close, but a nice little weekend place would be really good. We really could make this to a private beach here easily. It's a total lot size of 1598 square metres. There's access from the road outside as well. There's a clean title. This really is a really good option. This. There's a lot here as a 5.5m square meter. 2,500 pesos per square meter. But this is on the lot of the moment. Yeah. 2,500 per square meter. Yeah. It's almost 6.25m. 2.25m. Yeah. This is a good location for a house. This isn't it. I'm business. Yeah. Business. This could be definitely a good business. A good old house location. So this is a good location on the main road, on the main highway. Definitely another option. This would be good for a nice house. It's got a great backdrop behind it at the trees. The road isn't that busy. It's really not too busy at all at the moment. And it's not behind is great for business. As well, this is possibly more like a residential area. But you can still put a business here behind. It's 6.5m. It's 2,000 per square meter. Not sure the exact size might better do the maps. But it's 6.5m. It goes your ball. Easy access to everywhere from here. Really good quality roads. Locked schools around. This isn't far from all moc at all. This is really nice. So this lock goes right way to the back. Way to way to the back wall. And all of this here is on the lot. It's so part of the lot. So these are just two examples. The lots of cell here in Moorida in Lati. If there's anything you're looking for, a particular drop of a comment, let us know. We'll see what we can find for you. If you want the evens details to get in touch to discuss this or the beach lot, again drop us a comment. And we'll see what we can do for you. It is negotiable. So I've got to grab yourself a bargain here. If we didn't grab it first. For a moment, the lock behind is nice, but maybe it's a bit too much for us at the moment. But the beach lot certainly is definitely very tempting. Very tempting. Always want to have a house or a holiday home or even a resort by the sea. So it's way easy to get to close to home. So you can just pop out for the weekend or even a few hours of family with friends. And we could build something quite nice there just to enjoy the sea. The beach itself is really good. It needs a bit of a tidy. Maybe the trees need trim in a bit. But the sand itself is quite nice, quite fine. Water is very clear and clean. Definitely tempted. Definitely interested. 1000 square meter from your car is and it's 3000 square meter. 3,000 square meter. But I think it's the negotiable. It's the negotiable. 3,500 square meter and it's a 5,000 square meter lock. Yes. So 3 million negotiable. It's good. So the house next door or resort next door is a cushion idea what you can do. So similar. So you up till the end of this house is it and then obviously you get the frontage of the beach. Yeah, good beach. Nice. It's nice. It's a nice lot. Yeah. And it's quite quite a beach here. Nice sand. And there's maybe a house next door or business. So definitely you can do something similar. That one's already sold. That one's already sold next to it. It's someone. Oh, you know where it's the balloon guy? That is the balloon guy. Yeah. So here is 1000 square meter up. Where you're from. Up to the end of the very sort of. Yeah. So this wall next to it. And then you've got the beach front. And you've got the beach front here. So until that one there. So similar to this one, isn't it? There is. Not as square meter as well. Not one. Oh, it's the same, isn't it? Yeah. It might not look wide because of the big. Oh, because it's a bit. Slope. You can back fill it. Back fill it. And then it will be exactly to 1000 square meter. Oh, see. So there's a slope there which can be back filled. Yeah. So it's the same size as that is there. So it gives you an idea then of the perspective. Quite big, isn't it? Mm-hmm. Great for business here. Yeah. Or a house. House, yeah. Definitely good for like a house is for the, you're even sort of beach. Come at the morning, give for a run. So this is a great location. A great spot for a house on the sea front. Nice and light. But the sand is nice. It's not a white, fine white sand, but it's not bad either. It's really quite smooth. Good place. Good place to come out and enjoy the sea. Okay, so it's like a function. And they put a volleyball net on the beach. That's really nice. But I think that this big, you're like, want to, well. A bit wide, yeah. 1400. 144. 144. Yeah. volleyball net. Kitchen idea was often you could do here, definitely. So there's going to be a new neighbor here. Next to our neighbor opposite, they've marked out the lot. Are they going to be building? So we tried the coconut york today. Tasted nice. Jane loved it. This is something we haven't had for a long time. It's easy to make. Just really one ingredient. Coconut flesh. Coconut water. This is something we haven't had for a long time. It's easy to make. Just really one ingredient. Coconut flesh. Coconut water. Especially young coconut. It's better. But you can add in probiotic, either from, confer as we did. Or if you have probiotic capsules, then those will work too. And, just gonna go for a little bit of a walk now. Creams behind me somewhere. Not sure if these two keens go for a walk. But we've been doing it a lot more recently. If you wanna get a bit of exercise, a bit of fascia.
