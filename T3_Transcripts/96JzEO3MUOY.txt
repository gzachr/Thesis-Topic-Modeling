That's all my mom did was yell at me. That was the only language my mom spoke was yelling. What? Say it again. Say it again. Say it again. Say it. What did you say to her? What did you say? Turn around. Turn around, you're... Okay. That's the only language. Stop. Little story of Bosnian children's childhood. If you hurt yourself when you're outside playing and you come home, your mom will not say, oh, oh, show me where you hurt yourself. Oh, poor little kid. No, it's the opposite. Your mom would yell at you because you were so stupid to fall and hurt yourself. They would be like, that's your own fault. That's your own fault. See what happens when you play and go outside and have fun. That's how many talks to me. Okay. Which my mom talked. YELL. Huh? When? When did you do it? Where? Where did you go? Huh? What? Did you lose your lunch box? Everyone, I lost my lunch box for a term. Holy shit. That's how my mom disciplined through... She never, like physically touched, she verbally attacked you. That's when she went out to you. She pranked you. She was like, oh, you're not going to be able to do it. She verbally attacked you. That's when she went out to you. She pranked you down in words. Terrigation. Two and a half hours of yelling. What? Where's your lunch box, Josep? Where did you put it? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? Where? Where did you go? You go from house to school to house. Where the pocket you know said. What? What? Where did you put it? Where did you put it? Where did you put it? Hello? Hello? No. Rachel just repeat what I said in a stupid voice. Oh, no. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh my god. How do you not know, Josep? How? No, Mom. Where did you say it? Where did you say it? Two hours of that. Where? How? Oh. Oh. She wants me to have snot coming out of my mouth and then breathed in at the same time. That's what she's talking about. I don't know. No, she got me. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. That's what she walks up to. Okay, okay, okay, breathe, breathe, breathe, Josep. Breathe, my god. Oh. Oh. Breathe, my god, Josep. Breathe, breathe. Breathe. It's just a lunch box. I just like. Oh. Then she's got to embarrass me. Then she's got to put my lunch in a top-of-wear container. That's how she embarrasses me. She always says, I'm going to put your lunch in a top-of-wear container. Oh. Why? I don't want to go to school. Why not? Because I don't want to go to school with my lunch in one of your top-of-wear. Okay. Stop. There is this thing, it's a Filipino thing, but it's also a Bosnian thing, where parents buy some products. Let's say ice cream. And then when their ice cream is done, they use the box for storage, which is actually a good thing. Yeah. So, parents put fish, meat, all sorts of food in there. And when the kid comes to the fridge and opens it, it's a bad surprise for the kids. And... Because they expect you to eat ice cream. And Jo Kwa actually did an Instagram video. I thought of him on Twitter. And he did an Instagram video where he made like, advertising for this top-of-wear kind of thing. And he went viral. So it's a thing. It's a thing. That shit's embarrassing. If I send my son to school with a top-of-wear container, he goes to school with a clear bowl, and it's got a blue lid, and it says, top-around the lid. I'm proud to go to school with that shit. My mom's top-of-wear. Usually an empty cool-whip container. Country crock. One time she put it in an empty neopolitan ice cream container. And she put my homework and my lunch and look like a fucking briefcase. What the f- No. Put my lunch in a cool-whip container. Let's see the sewing barricade. And then she goes grab a Sharpie so I can write your name on the lid. She's going to put the cool-whip container lunch box. I'm pretty sure I'm the only one with a cool-whip container lunch box. You'd never know, Joe. No, I know. I'm walking around the lunch room looking for a place to sit. My cool-whip container lunch box. All the other kids are looking at me. Your mom's going to let you eat cool-whip. I don't know what's inside it. I'm sitting down at the lunch table with my cool-whip container lunch box. All these other kids are trading lunches in front of me. But no one wants to trade for the mystery bucket. I get trading lunch box. Trading lunch, did you do it? No. Is that a team in Austria? Oh, I used to trade my lunch. In Austria? Yeah. No, more of a team. Oh, I did it. I don't know. My schoolmate was up there. They always thought that I had some really, really good food. So you traded it down? No, I just wanted to have something different. One of my schoolclicks always had a sandwich with canned worst and some cheese. And it was really, really good. That's why I traded. Okay. I just wanted to have some. So it was in your lunch box? Oh, actually, my mom did a great lunch box. I had so many things in there. I had fruits. I had fresh bread, which is not so usual. She basically went shopping in the morning. Prepared it for me. Came to school and brought me that lunch box. She was so nice. And then you went to trade it? Yeah. No, it was just occasion. Oh, when it was crazy. The story is cracking up now. What's the truth, Manny? No, I really loved my lunch box. I'm so thankful that everybody was very jealous of my lunch box. I just wanted to have the canned worst one. Every once in a while. My mouth is watering. He said he'd see all these delicious trades going down. I'll give you my turkey and cheddar cheese sandwich for that peanut butter and jelly. I'll give you my chocolate chip cookies for those pringles. I'll give you my chocolate milk for that gain array. And I'm looking at all of them. Does anyone want moongo? Moongo. Moongo. Moongo. It's so good, moongo. You get to keep the container. Some kid was like, what the fuck is moongo? Oh, my God. I had to explain it to him. It sees little round green beans. I was like, what's the matter? I'm going to eat it. I'm going to eat it. I'm going to eat it. I'm going to eat it. I'm going to eat it. I'm going to eat it. Oh, the fuck is that bag of sauce next to it? Philopino fish sauce. It really accents the flavor of the mongo. Don't spill it on your shirt, you smell like pussy all day. Oh, it's so good. Oh my god, I love his show. It's so good. And the more time you spit in the Philippines, the more the drugs make sense. Yeah, the more it makes sense. It's so good. Ah, Jo Kwa is really one of my favorites. It's so, so good. Let me know in the comments what your favorite jokkoy skit is right now. Don't just press pause. Go down to the comments. It is not right now. And I want to know what was in your lunch box. What was in your lunch box? I really want to know. I'm curious because I remember my lunch box is like this little piece of heaven that I traded. But you know, the grass is always greener on the other side, right? Oh my god. Oh my god. Good video.
