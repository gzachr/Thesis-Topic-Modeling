 Anyo! So the reverse culture shock at your experience back here in Korea because I've been living in the Philippines for a while so I'm still shocked. Hey, this is Food Edition. So you know that there are fast food here that's why I've got it on the Philippines. For example, KFC or McDonald's. And I know that there are no rice meals in Korea like chicken and rice, no. No. But I'm okay with it because I can eat it with my own hands. But the problem is, it's not gravy, it's not gravy. There are many different cultures here, but it's not gravy. There's a flavor of the chicken. It's not that gravy is not a fast food change. But I'm just saying that it's gravy in KFC, so I'm just more shocked. But I'm not that gravy. But this is Korean gravy. By Korean, I mean, it's really sweet. So it's not gravy. Anyway, I'm craving gravy. You know.
