 All these people that's advising you that you, yes indeed you can live on your $500 a month pension and live on a farm, you get to think this people does not even have a clue because they never done it and but they're willing to advise you that you can live in the farm because I think $500 a month is not enough to live here in the Philippines and as a foreigner you got more expense than a Filipino. Why? Because as a Filipino don't have to renew their visas or to get out of the country in time or once in a while as required and they can live on Filipino food, they can live in Filipino facilities but as a foreigner there's this visa requirements that you have to fulfill in order for you to legally stay here and of course you are not used to the basic very basic dried fish rice that most Filipinos are used to having living a poor simple life because you are used to the western food, yeah you can say you can adapt but let's go back to $500 a month is it enough? How about for me I disagree $500 a month is not enough for a foreigner to survive here in the Philippines. There's a saying of Filipinos saying the saying goes yeah you survive but you're not living so what is the point of that although a lot of foreign experts has been advising and you can even see other Filipinos that yeah you can live in the province is okay while your chickens, cows, pigs are growing they need to eat so as you but you cannot even monetize them yet while they're growing the same as your crops you need to be cared for and for mass producing to have enough financial gain from it you need to make them to make sure that they are fertilized and all well protected and those people that's advising you that they are farming for profit but for this it's never been seen it's only been claimed but never been proven because 100% they're living on their YouTube channel they're living on the people the advices the views from the advices that they've given but not the actual advice they are abhilling themselves they can they live in a dream
