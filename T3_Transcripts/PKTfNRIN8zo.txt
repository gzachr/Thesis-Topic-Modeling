Oh no, it's just gonna be singing. I just got it. And I love them. So cute. What a doll. Here it comes. Street karaoke challenge. So this is what he was taking part in. No. Can't quite understand together yet, but it sounds funny. Recommend some good lessons. See if they take it away. Yeah guys, but look for the last picture. You're so good. And he's taught himself how to sing. You think you're just doing it on the bus? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Setting flutes off the school. This song, they always sing. This is the one. This is one of the... There's like a set few, wherever you are, you'll hear specific songs in the Philippines and karaoke. And this is definitely one of them. This is one of them. I'm thinking things yet, but... I'm in the beginning, but I'll send it in like... When we fade in, like a little tiny, little place. A little village in Port Barton. And we were at the top of it. Our room was upstairs. And... The neighbors. Here. karaoke. All day. All night. I'm singing this. But he's a lot better. So you're singing it together then? Ah, so he's like... See that's clever. So he's singing in... Ah, so he's singing in both. I understand. Yeah. But then he's singing the four of the English. Both languages. Oh, poor song. That's fashion. Yeah, like his rib jeep. It's for jeans. Didn't you say someone before came bought me a cap? T-shirt and stuff like that. So nice. And everything he earns he takes back and helps his family out. That's actually our age. So we just reached out to the right. He's got the right idea. Just a breach in the fact that he doesn't have anyone. See now in English again. He doesn't have anyone on the drum. Look at the guitar. He's literally just got a coin up. Oh, he's getting it. He's been rap as well. So tiny bit. His chain isn't off, brother. So not a double thing, okay? Going into the... Now let's come back to the song. Mm-hmm. He's not remixed it. Switching that up. Was he rapping the next part of the song? I wonder. See, backing in his again. So good. In English this song is used at weddings. Is it? Can he come and sing it for everyone? Actually, he's better than a wedding singer. His voice is so sweet. And he's just so effortless. Like he's not, you know, he's not overly confident. Nice. But that's what I like. If it was like someone that was famous, they'd be out there and just like showing off a little bit over the top. Because he's come from his local village, sings on the bus, sells the flute off the school. It's just more natural. He's so humble. Uh-huh. He's humble, polite. So good. No, everyone's just walking out of the bed. So what he's doing there is showing how rich his voice is. Like he can go high. Singing culture over here. Ah. So long waiting on the floor. I don't know why a bit. It feels like a piano piece, we slow-souls. Yeah. It's like, it's like, there. There, you, because it is singing. And I'll say you like, just focus the night on you. You just sit in there, you can sit there and just not speak. The reaction could be gone. So good. See, it's that note, so. I've seen those videos of him singing on the bus. Yeah. If anyone's got one. Or any more videos, if you can move them. That's like, he's not over the top. Yeah. So many quiet songs. And he's so like, he's just focused on his hands. He's like, he's like, he's like, big, I've been witnessing him for that many people. That was in the festival we went to. You get it? Brooklyn, So it's the Christmas one, isn't it? Yeah, it could be. There's Christmas. There's that, it's not Christmas. Maybe all we need is time. Oh. I think that's it. I think that's the end of the song then. So good. He's so cute. Even at the end, he's just humble. I like the fact that he's quite shy. Yeah. It'd just be like a normal person out there singing. He's not over the top. I see him at the end. He's so polite. So polite. I didn't think he was that shy. I thought he was very in between like he wasn't over and confident. He knows he can sing because that's what he does. He taught himself. He makes, he sells the flutes, uses the flute. I wish he used the flute like. Yeah, that'd be cool. There's a video of him using the flute. He was, he was so good though. Thank you for recommending that. It was again, a little bit different which we like, but just proved. So pleased that it went viral for him. I hope that he, hope that he can now, can like sing and perform wherever he wants and do what he wants. It's only about a year old the video, but hopefully in that years, life's changed. And I just hope that he's proud of himself. Smashed it. I'm proud of him. It proves all Philippineos are so talented. Whatever it is, they use their initiative, they get out there and they do what they can. Exactly. He's only so young. Didn't he say how old he is? No, great. Great. So comment below. I'm not sure maybe even younger. Comment below. Let us know how old he is. Comment below if there's another video of him that you want to see us react into.
