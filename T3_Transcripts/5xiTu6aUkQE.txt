Merry Christmas. Everyone out there, I hope you guys are having a fantastic holiday. I hope you're spending it with your loved ones, your family. We all have been a great day. We're having a great day because I'm a day behind you guys in the Philippines and wherever else in the world. But I'm currently at my grandparents' house. I got a family dinner later tonight to go to in the city, which when I say city, I mean Vancouver because I live in Squannish. You're here. It's like an hour. It takes an hour to get there. Let's get warm. Oh, geez. That's a tough door. I guess I'm not so tough anymore. What are you doing today, like? What's this for? What's that? Oh, what's that? Oh, man. Is that a normal sneeze? Yeah.

The one was the last time us three went in a car together. Last time I think was when you were puking out the car when you were little. Oh, it's great, memory. And Grandpa just kept driving. I had my head out like, no, it was the door was open and I had my head out the door. My mom held the door open for me. We're pulled over on the side of the road and I'll burdo somewhere in the middle of the desert. I'm puking. My grandpa just started to driving because he thinks I'm back in the vehicle. My head's hanging out the door. I'm like, ah! Pretty nasty. I'm still alive though Grandpa, so it's all good. Okay, that's great. You guys did it. I'm going to give it to you to plug in. Close that. No, just close this. See this little part? Yeah. Remember where it goes? In that hole. It goes a map silver thing right there. It'll only go one way though so if it doesn't fit, try the other way.

So you back in the day when the boats would come into the harbor in Squamish. Where would they come from? Anywhere in Southeast Asia. Probably with the Philippines, all over the world. And you guys used to buy a fundador by the bottle from the deckhands of the boats. Yeah. So the fundador would come on the boats, say probably from the Philippines, that would come into the house sound where my town is, that export pulp and stuff. And then you go on the boats during your break. And ask for my safe got any fundador. Ask them if they got any fundador. And they did. And why you were buying it for like four or five bucks a bottle of my thing? Yeah. But they're probably making a pretty good profit back then. Because I got that bottle for it. I think it was like six bucks for, I keep saying four or six. I can't remember. I bought it there. It was really cheap, though. And that would have been about 45 years ago. 45 years ago. The fundador is still going strong after 45 years. Still pretty good. Still pretty good. Indosus. Drink responsibly. Oh, yes. Drink responsibly, drive responsibly. Don't drink and drive.
