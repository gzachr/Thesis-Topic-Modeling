 But you're Friday. The freshest. All right. So this is a Filipino rapper, right? So but she's speaking in three different languages. Tagalog, English and Spanish, right? So this is a bit of like a bad comment. Like you guys sent me stuff and I was like, I see. So the whole point of the channel is sort of like, you know, discovering new talent and stuff like that. And I recognized one of the sections though. I don't know if she made it up and that went viral or if she's... Calling out something else. Exactly. I have no idea. But she's speaking in Tagalog and Spanish and I'm English and obviously we're from South America. So I'm guessing that's why you were so adamant we'll check it out. But let's give her what? This is E-list more in a... I am. I've heard like 15 seconds of the middle. I've never heard what she speaks in Spanish. She could speak terrible Spanish with those. Oh, it's half a guess. Most Filipinos down though. That's correct. Most Filipinos murder. Oh, damn. Oh, damn. Girl! Oh, damn. I am. I hate pop. You know, I mean, I've never heard that. You never heard that. That's the beat I recognized. It was like a video that one of my mates sent me. I don't know. You know, I'm not being on Tik-Doh and you're like shit. I don't know. But doesn't that sound like a sound? Doesn't that sound like one of those clips that people put they attach on the video? No, but I think about it. I have a faint memory. It's like black and white. That's jealous. Like you're making my fucking brain jealous. Yeah. Yeah. Do you remember that? I don't know. Again, I'm not bigger than social media stuff. Yes! But it's a faint memory. I don't know who's the original. I don't know who the whole Tik-Doh thing, right? You don't know who started it first. It was mad, it was a mad world. No, no! But it helped me. Right, rhyming was. This pattern of rhythm, which it was really popular, between female rappers actually, in South America. Correct. It was these 1, 2, 3 bars. It was like that, that, that, that, that, that, that. That, that, that, that, that. That, that, that subsectionalized sort of bars. Like it's like, I'm, I don't think I'm overrated, I think. I don't think I'm underrated, I think I'm over hated. It's like, it's, it's, it's syllabic, really simple. Yeah. But it's catchiest fuck. Yeah, you get you going and copy it back. You had rappers like this in, in South America. Like, what the fuck was their name? She was so, the, well, like, I'm a yota, right? I have a queen, yeah. She's kind of the, to be fair. I don't think she gets the fly, what she deserves. All correct. Because she began the whole fucking, female bad B stuff. And then that's when you started seeing. Well, nobody was doing it, right? Yeah, Mickey Manage arguably as well. Mickey. Mickey, Mickey. Mickey Manage. I would just say Mickey, Mickey Manage. No, no, no, Mickey Manage arguably in that point was as well during the same sort of uprise. Yeah, because it's just in South America. No, I'm a queen. I've a queen was way before Nicki Manage. Like a way. She had made it before. But Nicki Manage was putting in work behind the scenes at that point. Oh, totally. I didn't agree. So it's geographically speaking. Okay. You see what I mean? Yeah. But yeah, let's see where the fucking Spanish is. Yeah, let's see where he goes. This is interesting, though. I am also a single, but I might be a homeless boy in the woods in the countryside. She keeps spelling, I am all the time. I'm a bad, a type of dead, a game of horses, dead, a side of the sky. I'm a woman, a bad guy. Like my mother and my mother are super intelligent. Yeah! I'm a bad guy. I'm a bad guy. I'm a bad guy. I'm a bad guy. I'm not a woman, I'm a bad guy. I'm a bad guy. I'm a bad guy. Okay. I'm a bad guy. Okay. I'm a bad guy. I'm a bad guy. Oh, see, you see. When she flips the tagalog, it's so freaking hard. I'm so good. The Spanish and Tagalog in a rap. Fire. The Spanish bars? Bro! That's nice. I'm in it. I'm into it. This is cool. Okay. You know what's funny as well? She sounded, I'd love to see. I think Yendry is obviously, you know, she's popping off at the moment. Oh, but she would be a half-baller. Oh my god. Yendry. I feel like it's morning. And what's Yendry's font? What she grew up in your... She's so mean, kind of. No, she grew up in... Oh, is that a lie? No, no, no. She grew up in Italy. Shut up. Yeah, yeah, she came when she rose to fame in Italy. Listen to Yendry Nena, who are Banga? Anything Yendry has. She's been dropping out some money. I like this. This is what I've been looking for. A sort of a Philip Rapa that can speak in Tagalog. And then they can mix it with Spanish. What else has Ylis Morena got? I don't know. In the bank. Because this is Fayo. And like, they never have a problem with it. And then Alina? I don't know. I don't know. No. I don't know. I don't know. What? What the fuck, BcZ? Elis Baby. Okay. It's such a new York flow. Isn't it? Is such a Bronx flow? She's gonna keep doing that Spanish Filipino shit, man. That, that bind, dude. I like that hook banks as well. I can make your mother like Frank Gilley. Click, click, bang, bang. That shit is. And you know, what? Cool little reference. You know, it's so funny. I sort of, I'd love to know what sort of influences are. But that sort of idea of intertwining and interlinking in bars that they spell different things the first letter. Why Spanish? I don't know. I guess it just sounds hard. It was about like, I'm hearing so much in New York here. And then she didn't grow up it. She's like, from the Philippines, Philippines. There are, okay, but then why Spanish? I'm telling you, it's just a cheat code. They just, they can just do it. We can't do it. Like, we can't, we can't just speak like Tagalog just out of nowhere. It's like, right bars in Tagalog. Why the hell no? No way. You can't do that. You can maybe, you know, exhibit, exhibit Walucha. You can make the phonetic sounds. You can make a song. Sorry, do a cover of a song. And it seems people think it's a wow. You know, it's so similar to sort of the native pronunciation. But that's just, that's just diction. And getting coaching. And that's just... Atonis is magic and shit like that. Basically. And the less could be a fucking wonderful singer. But it's like, that's all it is. Not to take credit away from it. What she's done though, it's like to... You know, maybe I'll give it a try. I do want to give it a try. Good go. But I want to do it in collaboration with someone. Not alone. Because I don't feel I can carry the track on my own if I'm speaking Spanish and Tagalog. Tagalog. Or any other dialect. But yeah, I'm still in the works with that. But I know that. Well, that's wild though. That is actually pretty good. And it's pretty good. I couldn't come up with rhymes in Filipino. See, that's the thing. You have to speak the language in order to come up with stuff. Like you have to have the knowledge. You need to have the knowledge in your brain. Baked na. Baked na. Proceeds to mix all the songs, names I know. Baked na. Mama, honey, kiddo. Baked na. Dekal. What? Ikao. Oh, okay. Baked na ikao. Baked na ikao. Ikao. Ikao. Ikao. Ikao. Goodbye, Baked na.
