Good morning from the
Philippines, everybody.
It has been like two and a half
months since I filmed the video.
So apologies for the rustiness.
Um, but I'm here in the Philippines
guys ever since I first started solo
traveling back in 2019, I've wanted to
visit the Philippines so damn badly.
I swear.
I say that about like
every single country.
So I'm just checking.
I got a grab on the way we're
heading to a food street.
You know, you can't Luke can't
come to a new country and I'll
instantly go for a food hunt for
breakfast, but ever since I started
solo, traveling wanted to come
to the Philippines so badly.
There are so many amazing
beaches, so many amazing islands.
I think they're like still discovering
islands to this day, uh, that
are in like Filipino territory.
So I'm damn excited.
The people here are amazing.
The food looks damn good.
And most importantly, I'm
excited to try Jollibee.
So in the next couple of videos,
you might be seeing that one because
I've heard a lot about Jollybee.
I've seen it in Dubai and I've seen
a couple, uh, as I'm walking around
the streets here, but I'm stoked guys, another
series and it's actually the first
country, the first new country
that I'm visiting, uh, this year.
So I've visited a lot
of countries this year.
Don't really like care about the tally
of countries, but it's always nice,
you know, to say, oh, I visited a new
country every once in a while, but
here's all the Philippines looking
like everybody absolute craziness.
I see all these tricycles
and stuff going around.
I should have booked one of them,
but I got like a grab that's
coming, uh, to me from, uh, from
somewhere downtown.
Um, but there's all these
like tricycles and whatnot.
So it's really cool people
on bicycles that -
Hello.
he's not too hello-ing back to
me, but what is this guy doing?
Is he moving or what?
Anyways, we're gonna catch this car and,
uh, we'll take you guys to the food
street and we'll begin the Philippines
series exactly where it needs to be
eating delicious food on the street
and interacting with the locals.
My goodness.
What is that noise?
Um, I had the word for.
And like Yala, Tara na.
Let's do it.
All right, guys.
My grab driver canceled on me,
so, uh, we're gonna have to get
the, uh, the local transport.
So all these little like tricycle things.
They're so cool.
Some of them are motor powered.
Some of them are powered
by your big, strong legs.
You know this, guy's got a motored
one motored one oh brother.
Oh, he's already.
A passenger.
See, look, how can you not enjoy these,
these like the coolest things ever.
Hello, brother.
I need to go.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come with you.
All right.
Yeah.
Yeah I want the motor power ones.
I know you have big, strong
legs, but I need the motorbike.
Is he stopping or what brother, brother.
I need to go to, uh, Divisoria.
Yeah.
Divisoria.
you know, it's, uh, seven
minutes, 1.4 kilometers.
Like food, eating, eating.
Yeah how much? Peso? That's
what you use here, right?
Filipino peso.
Yeah how much?
150.
150?
Oh, that's very expensive.
Grab is cheaper.
We do
100 yeah?
100 okay?
All right I'm hoping in side here.
How do you get into these things?
All right.
Guys, this is all we got.
Oh my God.
We're going all around the joint.
This is the loudest thing
that I've ever gotten.
Was just literally tin and the brakes.
Oh my God.
I'm going about to go deaf.
All right guys.
So that's right.
So these things, let's actually
figure out the name of these.
I don't understand.
Maybe we're going into some dodgy areas
and he is telling me to be careful.
Um, just on the side here.
Wow.
It's so noisy.
Oh my God.
I feel like I'm in a spaceship
going through the atmosphere,
breaking the sound barrier.
And we're about to orbit around the
moon or about to orbit around Uranus.
Um, All right.
I had it up before as to what these were.
So these are -
I think these are called Jeepneys.
Be careful?
Yeah Divisoria.
Ah address.
Uhh.
Oh, okay.
I see, I see just the, uh,
Tondo Manila Metro.
Address?
Yeah yeah.
There Tondo.
Tondo.
Divisoria side?
Yeah yeah.
Divisoria, I want to go eat.
Huh?
Eating, eating, like, uh, food, food here,
I direct you.
Hello, brother.
Oh, what game are you playing?
You're playing clash of clans?
Clash of clans.
What's your name, boss?
Your name?
Your name?
Yeah, yeah Divisoria mall.
I have the word for, what is your name?
Uh, where is it?
I also have the word for how are you.
Kamusta ka? Kamusta ka? 
We gotta learn guys the best way.
You know, I was trying to
learn a little bit of, uh, the
Filipino language before I left.
Uh, but it's just so difficult.
I really love like, just getting
out into the world into the
street and I'm practicing there.
I don't even know if you can hear me.
I feel like I'm in a tin box right now.
And I guess I am in a tin box right now,
but this is the streets of, uh, Manila
everybody we're gonna make
our way some delicious street
food get some delicious drinks and
I'll get a real first impressions
here in the Philippines guys.
Ah, it's good to be back guys.
It is good to be back vlogging.
Oh my, I think we arrived.
It smells like, yeah, this is it.
Yeah.
Oh no, not the mall.
The, uh, not the mall, near here.
Tutuban shopping mall.
Mm-hmm.
No, no, no, no, no.
This one, not that this one.
Yeah.
Yeah we need to go here.
So this is where I -
he thought we were going.
There's all the same name, which makes
sense is why we're so confused, but
it smells like piss right here.
It smell.
It actually smells like urination.
Um, who knows why?
All right.
Uh, yeah, that one, this one, this one?
Yes, yes.
Yes.
Brgy 253.
253?
- Yeah 253.
So I notice the Manila is like,
kind of split up into, um,
these things called Brgy.
I don't know what they stand for, but even when
I was doing like immigration stuff, it was
like, what Brgy you
staying at?
I was like, I have no
idea what that means.
Um, but just, I'm gonna say a
random number and I put like
69 or something like that.
Um, anyway, where's our driver going?
Where's he going?
No butI want food, food, food.
What?
All right.
Number one thing you don't do in any
foreign country is just let random
people run off with your phone.
At least I got my camera though.
I don't really care about the phone, but
the camera, uh. Let's just get out here
I reckon.
This is fine.
It doesn't smell as
much like piss anymore.
Here's okay,
I walk.
It's fine.
Malayo.
Yeah, this is okay.
I'll uh, I'll walk around.
I eat food.
Oh, there's street food over there.
Oh, I'm a happy man over there.
We're good.
Good.
Okay.
Yeah.
This is for you.
Thank you.
All right guys.
So here we are at where I thought was,
uh, Daria or whatever the name was.
Well, we got tons like
street food and whatnot.
We got cool little things.
They got big bananas
over there and whatnot.
Anyways, we're gonna walk around.
See what we come across.
I saw a guy selling.
Oh, you see, there's all these, hello.
She called me daddy, weird.
Um, but there's all these little
street stores and whatnot.
Oh.
There's like shops and all right.
I'm glad we found this area.
I'm glad we found here.
It's nice.
Alright.
Let's do it.
Look at all these like cool.
Oh, they have harden.
Lakers jerseys and whatnot.
Definitely.
We gotta pick up a, a basketball
Jersey and fit in with the locals.
They love basketball
here in the Philippines.
So, oh, this, this is my place, guys.
This is the place to be all kinds of stuff
going on too much energy, so much action.
Do you know, do you know where
I can find like a basketball
t-shirt like bulls or?
- Here.
Oh, right there.
You're working.
This is your store.
Oh you have burgers?
Is it your, your shop?
Oh, that's your shop there?
Yeah.
Oh, which one's the best one?
Loaded.
What's in the loaded one?
It's, uh,
Ham, egg, and patty.
Oh.
And then I'll also add lots of cheese.
All right.
Do I order from her?
Or I order from you?
Can I have a loaded one
with lots of cheese, please?
All right.
Well, definitely not what you expect a
restaurant to be with lots of fabric.
Let's see what else they have.
So of course, we're gonna have to
get lots of cheese on there, but
this is like the first meal I'm
having in around like 24 hours.
So pretty damn hungry.
And that's why I was like,
oh, there's Chicago bulls.
Um, Jersey over there, but that can wait,
because I need to get some food into me
and increase the, uh, energy levels.
So let's see what's going on here.
I got to be careful here, because if I put
my camera too, uh, close, I'll get my
fingers chopped off, but here we go.
Got cheese, got hamburgers.
Eggs.
How many years have you been here for?
Three years.
Three years.
Very good.
And this is your wife?
No.
- Your daughter?
No.
- Your friend?
Yeah.
Very good.
It's interesting.
You have fabric, you have clothes
shop and, uh, cooking shop.
Tell you what guys.
It is.
Super sweaty here.
In the Philippines and you get used to
its humidity again, but I think it's just
the air, you know, being sort of inland.
If we go by the ocean, we'll have
the ocean breeze and whatnot.
I wanna quickly show you guys these.
Take a bake, a break
from the burger place.
Look at all these cool
little cane, uh, bags.
Wow.
We'd have to buy one of them, but,
um, I'm gonna put my channel name in.
There that is me.
Yes.
Travel with Luke Damant.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
I appreciate it.
Do you watch YouTube?
You like YouTube?
Yes I like YouTube.
Who's your favorite
YouTuber?
More vlogger.
How much does a, um, like
bulls Jersey cost normally?
Like what is the price?
Uh, 650
- 650?
Yeah.
So like 200 is good price.
We'll try and get up down, you know?
All right.
A lot of a lot has happened
since we, uh, since we went
on that hunt showing all the.
Cane things that eggs going on,
we got the, the ham, the square bacon,
we got the buns going on and the patty there.
Very good.
You know, I understand why there's fans
here now in the camera, it looks like
it's going really slow because of the frame rate.
But it is absolutely going at
a blitzing speed in real life.
And I wish it was facing my way.
Oh, there's actually one
inside as well facing this way.
Um, oh yeah.
Now a lot of people ask me when I made
any like street food and street drinks.
Luke, how do you not get sick?
And honestly, I have no idea.
Um, but there have been two
occasions where I've been severely
ill, both of those, uh, in India, when I got
super sick, I was drinking like this ice
drink, and you'd never want to drink ice
in any country, specifically in India.
Like you can see the, um, the ice
cubes that has just been like smashed,
uh, on the side of the street.
Just stick away from ice,
especially, uh, in India.
But I haven't been sick in so many years
and I got cocky and I even said when
I was drinking the ice drink, I was like,
oh, if I don't go sick from here, I'm
immune 12 hours later, little did I know.
Your man's coming out, both
ends, um, for 48 hours straight.
So I haven't been sick too many
times in life, or at least, uh, food,
food poisoning specifically, I've
eaten a lot of things that would
make a lot of other people sick.
Um, but I think my body is just an
iron body, an iron stomach, anything
in there unless it's ice from India.
Um, it can, it can survive.
So yeah, I mean, I think
you just get used to it.
I used to actually be like a really,
really fussy eater when I was a
kid, um, used to like eat basically
the same things every single day.
Um, but then traveling actually
opened me up to, to more.
Unique foods.
It forced me to eat different foods
because you know, you can't just
have cheese sandwiches at home, or
you can't have cheese sandwiches.
You can have cheese sandwiches
at home, but you can't have them.
Uh, when you're traveling, because
they're pretty hard to find you
actually just gotta, um, go and eat
the local food and force yourself.
You literally have no other
option or alternative.
It's gonna be, you either eat their
food or you stop sort of thing.
So traveling really got me
into a much better, um, space
of trying foods and whatnot.
Let's get back onto the main topic here.
He added some sauce here.
What is this?
This is mayonnaise?
Mayonnaise.
- Uh huh.
This is banana? Cucumber.
Cucumber.
It's a green banana.
Um, so we can see ham starting crisp up.
We got the Patty.
It is smelling pretty damn good.
Oh sprouts.
Very nice.
It kind of reminds me of the, the burger
that we had in Lahore in Pakistan.
The, um, the chicken charmain.
it was like 50, 50 cents or so.
So the, uh, the loaded one, 47 plus cheese
comes to around 52, um, Filipino pesos.
Which is, uh, basically one us dollar.
So you can see the cheese coming in.
I love cheese.
Cheese is good.
Have you heard of cheese paratha? Cheese
paratha is number one food.
Maybe this could be the
new number one food though.
Who knows?
But I want lots and lots of cheese.
There we go.
Starting to come together guys.
Oh,
I think that's done.
Get some ketchup on there.
Oh, no, no, no, thank you.
I didn't know Filipinos
like, uh, hot stuff, I guess.
It's uh, your choice really.
Here we go.
I will, uh, I'll eat here if that's okay.
Awesome.
Oh, bag yeah.
Thank you so much.
Oh that is boiling hot.
All right, we're gonna eat here.
It was definitely not the, uh,
the first Filipino meal that I
thought I was gonna have here.
I was expecting something,
uh, you know, something
traditional, but we got a burger.
I saw the opportunity and, uh, I
grabbed it while I had that opportunity.
It is so hot.
Oh my God.
Alright.
Let's just bite into this guys.
We got the ham, we got the
egg, we got the patty on top.
And of course, we've got the cheese
in the middle mayonnaise, ketchup
up, some vegetables, some green
stuff, some cucumber, some sprouts.
Here we go.
It's fallen.
It's fallen to pieces.
Wow.
That is.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
We just hit the patty.
We just hit the egg.
We got a bit of ham in there as well,
but the sauce super, super nice.
Oh man.
For a dollar, this beats, um,
Macers McDonald's, but we'll
have to put it up to the test.
Eventually when we tried
Jollybee, I've heard so many
good things about Jollybee.
Speaking of, I know, thought that lady
was wearing a Jollybee, um.
Very good.
I will have a water, please.
You're a great salesman.
Upsell.
Another water done.
Thank you.
Let's um, finish this off guys.
We'll pay.
And then, uh, we'll continue.
With the rest of the journey
need to get that basketball shirt.
Let's do that.
What is the price?
How much?
57.
All right, there we go.
There's a hundred.
You can keep that.
No change needed.
Thank you.
Thank you so much, brother.
Thank you for the recommendation.
I'm going to go get a
Chicago bulls jersey.
Yes.
So 650 you say.
All right.
What's your name?
Nice to meet you.
I'm Luke.
Thank you.
People are kind out here, guys.
Um, Hey sir.
Hey brother.

I'm I'm fine.
You're good you're good?
Hello, I'm looking for Chicago bulls.
That's what I want.
500.
I can try on, is it okay?
Ah, no, not allowed.
No, but like, can I try
on like I can put on.
All right.
So what do we have?
We have the bulls, we got the white
bulls, the black bulls, 500
okay noted, noted, or Lakers.
You know, who, who
doesn't love Lakers bulls.
I think these ones are small.
Um, alright.
Let's try something on guys.
Yeah yeah.

Wow.
Wow.
Beautiful.
Yeah, you are.
You are very beautiful.
You very good.
All right.

goated legend right there.
Oh, this one.
Oh, very good.
It's really beautiful.
I'm looking beautiful?
Do you like? Do you like him?
This lady's a character.
Oh, this one's small here.
Maybe.
No 300, 500, no 300.
Wow.
You're bargaining against yourself.
One for 500.
Alright, let's try.
Let's try the black one on, I think
I'm leaning towards the black.
It feels was a lot better.
The black 500 minimum.
Oh my God guys.
I'm stuck.
I'm stuck.
Give me 500.
Yeah, I need to, I need to try on first.
No.
Okay.
Again again 500.
Yeah, I think, I think black is better.
Oh wow.
Jordan.

That is what, a way better fit guys.
That is so much better.
Feels a lot more comfortable.
This one, this one made in China.
You know, it wasn't a
large, it's very good.

Goodbye, goodbye.
Enjoy your shirt.
Ah, it's all.
It's you know, it always takes
a little bit to warm up to new
countries, especially when you're
here for the very first time.
Um, but I know I'm gonna have
a damn good time here guys.
Hey sir.
Hey brother.
How are you?
What's your name?

Excuse me.
Hey brother.
How are you?
You're going good?
I need to do something with a shirt.
I actually like the shirt a
lot, so do wanna hold onto it.
Um, but pretty successful so far.
Walking around here.
I can imagine I'll be,
I'll be back here later on.
Got a nice little shirt.
This actually is super comfortable.
Michael Jordan bulls 23, the
goat, um, and had a, had a burger.
Hey bro.
Hey brother.
You good?
Hello hello.
Hello.
Wow people are so friendly.
People are so friendly.
Hello.
Hello.
How are you?
You good.
Man.
People are so friendly here.
This is so good.
Everyone's so, uh, so happy.
Hey brother.
Need to learn more of the local
language so I can communicate a little
bit better, but that just comes as.
You travel more here, you spend more time,
you learn, you know, a few words a day.
And then by the end of the week, you have
20 or so words in your vocabulary, but
I'm thinking let's scoot it through here
and, uh, we'll make our way just up here.
Oh, I do need a new pair of shoes.
Oh, do I buy some shoes?
Hey.
How are you?
We got Nikes.
So I lost my Iraqi Baghdad shoes
that I've had for so long and
had to buy $3 shoes in Australia.
Hello?
Do you have like just a
black, Nike? Black, Nike?
Yeah, like that black Nike,
you have big, big size?
Yes.
What size?
Uh, like 44.
44.
You have?
You have anything 44?
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
You have 44?
What size is this?
It has no size, uh, 44.
We'll try it on.
In the middle of the street.
How much are they?
350, $7.
There's another one in the back.
You got to get your fingers up there.
There we go.
It's all clear.
You know, they had a
little bit bigger ones.
You have big, big, like 44, 45?
These will be perfect,
but you can see my, my toes is a
little bit clamped and I'm kind of
rolling out a bit, but hopefully,
Ah, 45.
Thank you.
Okay.
Let's try them on.
This is, uh, 350 too?
Well, that's much better.
You know, I think anything at
the moment will beat my $3
Kmart shoes.
If anybody's living in Australia,
you know what Kmart is.
Every time I go back to Sydney, I always
buy a pair of these $3 Kmart shoes.
Um, so it's actually, alright.
They're not as good as the Iraqi
shoes, but this will do the job.
Do you have the right, right side?
This are actually decent.
These are half decent.
I rate, I rate them and the kind
of the color I was going for black.
So try on the last one.
Thanks.
Yeah, feeling good.
I can, I can run really fast now.
Where are you from sir?
- Australia?
People are like so friendly.
There's willing to have a chat
and whatnot and see, uh, go on the
other side and see what they have.
Oh, you have Vans.
I like vans.
What size vans are these?
Do you reckon they'll fit?
Oh, I was wondering like
how this hook was in there.
And then I realized I can feel
a hook in the back of my foot.
She's laughing at this,
I was like, what is this?
What is this?
All right, let's put that back there.
What is your name?
Angel.
Sorry.
Angel.
Angel.
Wow.
Very beautiful name.
Is that because you look like
an angel or, uh, you, you fell
from, you fell from heaven?
All right guys, enough with the uh,
hitting on a beautiful lady.
Let's try these.
That's actually a pretty good name eh.
All right guys.
I think this is it.
This is us done.
Just, uh.
Very good.
I approve.
I approve of them.
Now it is time to bargain, but they're
already actually like a really good price.
It is negotiable?
I can get cheaper price or, uh,
how much, what is the
price that we can do?
How much did you say?
350?
We can do like 50?
Oh, no, I'm kidding.
300 is
Okay?
That's okay.
We will give them the 350.
I think that's a reasonable price.
Seven us dollars for these.
I think it's fair.
Who do I pay?
You?
Oh, no, thank you.
I do not need, oh, London.
Very beautiful.
Here I put, uh, this one in there.
Amazing.
Thank you so much.
Thank you, Angel.
Bye bye.
All right, sir.
Thank you.
I'm from Australia.
Let's put our federal reserves away.
We made it to the end.
Look at these like cool
little limo things.
We got a tuk tuk as well.
Hey brother.
But, um, we'll go up here and
see what else we can find.
Got my bag, got my shoes
and my shirt in there.
I'm actually really liking
the Chicago bulls, uh, Jersey.
So super stoked about that,
but I was looking at like my hotel and I
was trying to figure out how to get there.
And I didn't realize it was so close.
It's like a 500 meter
walk from where I am.
So we're just gonna walk there.
We, we had to go through all the
streets, get some new glasses if, if
needed, uh, and just, you know, try all
the random things that we come across
of, you know, just like how exciting
how exciting all these things you have shops.
Got motor covers.
You got people selling
bags for a hundred pesos.
That's a good deal.
These bags, you got all kinds of things.
So, hello.
Hello.
We are, uh, gonna walk through here.
Oh, donuts.
All right guys.
I think that's criminal though.
I was just walking past those donuts.
I can't not, I need, I need a donut.
I can't, I can't walk past it.
I need myself a donut.
