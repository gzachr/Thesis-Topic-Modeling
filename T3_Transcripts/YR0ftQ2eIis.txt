 Hey, oh good morning guys! We are at our hostel right now and we're trying to get a little workout in so we went around, collected some things and we're gonna put together our own custom workout routine. So if you are traveling like us and you want to stay fit, get in shape, here's a few things you can do pretty much from everywhere. Depending on what you have, we're lucky we actually have a little bar, we can do some pull ups, we also travel with the yoga mat so we can have some cushion under us when we do like, ab workout and stuff. We also found this bucket right here which we filled with rocks so we can do curls and bunch of different things with this. So we're gonna get creative. Oh, we got some tires over here so I don't know. We'll see what we can do. We'll try to get creative and feel free to copy us and stay in shape while you travel. Woo! Work out complete! There's no, there's not like the movies when you try to take your shirt off and just doesn't come out sexy. And that's how to stay fit while traveling. So now a shower time, gotta wash up real quick, check out of our hostel, we have to get out of here in like 20 minutes. Then we're gonna go to an immigration office to try to extend our visa. I'll give you some advice and tips on how to do that if you're interested. But after that we're gonna meet up with our couch surfing host. We're staying with someone about three hours south of here but she's in Seaboo so we're gonna meet up with her and today is her birthday so we haven't met her yet but we've been talking with her and she sounds so cool. She, yeah, we'll tell you about her when we meet her but we're gonna go do all that right now so let's go! Alright so we're currently waiting online to extend our visas and I just want to give you some advice, some travel advice if you plan on coming to the Philippines. So if you plan on coming to the Philippines and you're from a western country typically most foreigners get 30 days for a visa on arrival. So that means when you arrive in the Philippines for free, don't have to pay anything, you can stay in the country for 30 days. But for me I want to extend that visa so I want to stay in this country for two months. And if you know you want to stay in this country for longer than a month, like I said if you're only here for 30 days you don't have to pay anything. But if you want to stay here for two months or more you do have to pay and you can avoid all of this hassle that I'm doing right now when you arrive in the airport which I actually didn't know until later but when you arrive in the Philippines you can just pay that at immigration. It costs around 3,000 pesos. I actually haven't paid yet. I'm waiting for them to call my number so I'll put that cost right here once I find out what that is. And that's how much you have to pay to extend your visa. And you can either do that as soon as you arrive in the country which is easy and quick or you can find an immigration office like I'm doing right now, wait in line, go through the process and yeah it's much easier to just do it when you arrive in the country. So that's some travel advice for you. Also another real quick piece of travel advice. I needed to take out some money to pay for this so I went to an ATM and the bank I use is called Chal Schwab. If you are from America I think it's only for American citizens, American bank. Look into Chal Schwab if you are traveling because they have an awesome policy that they refund all ATM fees worldwide. So no matter where you are in the world if you use an ATM typically there's going to be a fee involved with it but Chal Schwab reimburses all those fees. So looking to Chal Schwab that's your travel advice for the day. I hope it helps. I've got to go back to immigration right now. Then we're going to meet up with a couch surfing host.
