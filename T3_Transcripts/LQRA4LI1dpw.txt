 Good evening guys, welcome back to our channel and welcome back to another video. If you've been here before or if this is your first time, we welcome you. It is actually the evening time right now. We are just getting ready because we're going to head out. We're actually going over to BGC tonight to meet a couple of people that once again you probably know. So we're super excited. We're going for a couple of drinks with lowest and gyms from Liam Blogging, Georgian and I'm going to say from the Gisublog. But this time we're also going to be meeting Mike and Nelly from making it happen. So very excited. We're just kind of finishing up getting ready here at the moment, trying to eat something before we go anywhere. And then yeah, we'll be ready to go. So let's go. You just came. We just saved you this walk. You're taking your time man. How are you man? I'm good. I probably should do something. All right. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. I'm George and this is a department guy. Everyone's here. And then just a big friend of mine. He was in the skin like my friend. So I'm having a lot of fun. I know I'm having a lot of fun. I know I'm having a lot of fun. I'm having a lot of fun. I'm having a lot of fun. Yeah, just about to get talking to some drinks. I'm nice. All the food here. The mess. So good. Oh really? Oh really? Oh yeah. Oh. This view is amazing. It's amazing. It's amazing. It's amazing. That's why it's really awesome. I love it. I love it. Check out the view guys. This place is just so nice. Such a nice spot. Green of you. Of the city. I'm just. Yeah. Just really cool. These guys are fighting at top. Super nice. Look aboard in this chillin' again. I have some drinks. Yeah. We need some fun. We need some fun. We don't need no shabu. Oh. We don't need no fur. Well this is kind of strange. George and Lucy have brought us to this place that looks like a coffee shop. We're actually going to say we didn't expect. Yeah. In the daytime these doors are closed. So it looks like a closed coffee shop. There you go. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. This is our new kitchen. So nice. So nice. This is our store from some free time shop. You recognize those bars? We've got plenty of. Gill—Çell Schluss. I'm hoping you can. Oh my god, hi! There's just doors to open everywhere here. Hi! Sorry, it's good length. Secret doors everywhere. It's kind of a little dry. It's really cute. It's straight, plain, it's quite small and there's a lot of people here and not many seen it. But it's quite nice. Everybody's going to try it. It's really good, my big drink. It's wrong. It actually has no minute, so not so in there. It's nice though. It's quite a bargain, like, drinks. So they don't have this lower bargain. So everything's quite like fancy. But it's really good. It's really good. We've just finished up in the first bar of our bar crawl here guys. It was actually kind of cool, like we sure did the start. It was like a coffee, like, pen and station-dendet cafe at the start, and then it opens up into, like, a bar. Really small, but had a really cool vibe to it. And he ordered something with vodka, which was really nice. I let it really say, give me some sort of combination that has real minute. And when he gave me, it was good. It was like kind of fruity and yeah, really cool spot. On to number two. Everybody's doing the CMC here. This is very good. Yeah, literally everyone's buying George, Lucy, Blake, Nelly, Noah's James. We wanted to do an intro for Mike's vlog of you guys. We're going to put a quote to say by the way. So bar two guys of the bar crawl. We are apparently, oh, phones vibrating. We are apparently going to be going through a 7-11. Now, that is something new. I've never went to a bar true of 7-11 before, but these guys have suggested it. It's been recommended to them. So, let's draw true of 7-11 to the next bar. I can't see. Yes, why not? Why not? Let's go get it in. It disrupts the drinking. So, taking it a little bit from the bar crawl guys, we're heading on to bar two. And then these guys right here decided to stop in the Tovies and stay at the bar for a little coffee. Not something I would normally do in a bar crawl, but I mean, they're up for coffee. That's what's happening. Thank you. Oh, it's so nice here. Hello. I literally seen a few of your nose. Hiya. Hiya. Hiya. Hiya. Hiya. Hiya. Hiya. Hiya. Hiya. Hiya. Hiya. Hiya. Hiya. Hiya. Hiya. Hiya. Okay, so that was really crazy. We actually walked into a 7-Eleven shop and there was like a secret door, like over to the right where you wouldn't even know what it was if you didn't know. So, we've got led through the secret door into this like huge bar. It was really cool. The vibe was really cool. The music was really good. I got a couple of drinks there. And now we're going to move on to the bar. Number three. And I don't know where that is. Yeah, a really interesting, like kind of bar nightclub mix. Really nice drinks though. We had one whiskey highball and one... Michael Sackie, which I think is Japanese. Yeah, like a Japanese vodka. It's really good. Kind of thing. Really nice, really cool vibe and... And we also have some really good chats as well. Yes, yes. It's just so good to be in around the people that are... Understand and are doing the same thing. That's literally what makes these whole like meetups and stuff that we do in collaborations and chatting other people because all these guys here are in the same mindset and have the same interests. Just as such a similar vibe and it's great chatting with them about stuff and catching up. Some of them we've known a little longer than others, but yeah, great catching up with them in time to move on to bar number three. Nice. Vlog goodbye and then we'll go back. We're another name. Absolutely. Hey! It's bedtime. Is it the home time? Big meet up tonight. We've got a nice one. We are cooling the night out to a clock. I mean that's not bad. I think that's reasonable. It's really fun to walk. It's not bad, yeah? It's not a full and day smile. No. I don't know that. I'm going to call bars as well. Like, see where bars. Yeah, bars, spots. It's really cool, yeah. Literally never knew that existed until tonight. Wait a minute. Just like that, it is the next day guys. And you can probably tell a little bit from my voice that we had quite a few drinks in. Quite a few load bars. And yeah, quite a lot of chats by the look of it today. Yeah. We literally came home last night at like 2 a.m. and went straight to sleep. We intended to go to a few more bars and then the last one we went to. We had a few issues with the cameras and stuff. But the two that we went to was really cool. Rack Amanda, I believe from you guys on George. I think it was George. I think he recommended it to everybody. But yeah, great to meet up with those guys once again. We'd just like to say thanks to them for letting us come to their place and chill out. George and Lucy, that is. And yeah, thanks guys. It was great to once again chill out and just chat about. Literally everything and anything. Yeah, it was such a good night. The George and Lucy's place is so nice. Yes, so nice place. Very nice. So we're so happy for them. And yeah, it was great to meet Megan Nellie and the Elk. Yes, great to meet those guys too. And the first time, super nice guys are really good company. And of course, Lewis and James are in love with ladies as well. So yeah, it was a really good night. Good night. I always wanted to say that we really look forward to doing that again. Yeah. Because it's just, yeah, it was really good. So if you like this video, guys, make sure and give it a big thumbs up. Subscribe if you are. Yes. Do around here.
