I can't believe they're actually here it 
is 15 and my tutor is supposed to leave at  
6 30 for the second longest 
underground river in the world
foreign
friends we just arrived to the Puerto Princesa 
Subterranean National Park as I mentioned before  
we are going to be going into one of the largest 
underground cave systems in the world the cave  
itself is 24 kilometers long and the underground 
river is about eight obviously not all of it is  
open to the public I think my guide said 
we will be going on the boat for about two  
kilometers which takes almost an hour but this 
is a very special place like this is a UNESCO  
world heritage site it was named as one of 
the new seven natural wonders of the world  
or seven New Wonders of Nature something along 
that lines it's a very special place foreign
we just arrived to this new beach and right in 
front of me there's a sign that says welcome to  
Puerto Princesa Subterranean River National Park 
Underground River from my understanding we are  
going to be taking a paddle boat sort of thing 
into the actual cave itself so I don't know if  
there's a big long Trek to get to the entrance of 
the cave or where we go but I guess we'll find out
okay you need protection when going into 
the caves because sometimes some of the  
sediment can fall or apparently there's 
bats and you know they poo so you got to be  
careful of that as well and in the park here 
itself you do have to watch out for monkeys  
as we remember from the time that I had in 
Bali they are ruthless if you have something  
that they want they will take it so once 
again they recommend not having any kind  
of food on you no plastic bags and just 
be careful of like having your phone or  
you know something you don't want stolen out 
of your hands keeping a watch on my camera
wow
I'm about so it does look like we are going 
in a paddle boat guys so I think we have a  
guide that paddles for us and what's cool 
is that they give you an audio guide and  
there's many different languages to 
choose from so you can you know hear  
a description of what you're looking at in 
the caves since obviously it would be hard  
to hear a guide speaking the only thing I'm 
worried about is just how dark it is going  
to get in the cave so hopefully I'll be able 
to keep filming on this camera but if not my  
iPhone is actually not too bad in Darker 
lights so I might have to switch to that

guys I kid you not that is a hundred percent one 
of the top things that I have done here in the  
Philippines yes this is probably one of the most 
touristy things you could do on Palawan but that  
was a hundred percent worth it I have never been 
in a cave like that that big just I don't know I  
don't even have words for it but if you come here 
to Palawan like 100 100 you got to do it and I  
know lots of people were saying that it's actually 
super busy when you come here but at least today I  
wouldn't say it's super crowded I know they say 
up to a thousand people come here every day but  
in my experience I would say that this is really 
laid back but yeah now we are going to head with  
the motorboats oh I think my group is actually 
leaving without me um so we are going to get  
back on the motor boats and then I think we are 
heading back to the mainland to grab some lunch
foreign
thank you
so we just got to the restaurant and I'm 
actually super psyched that it is a buffet  
I did not have breakfast getting up so early 
this morning so I am super hungry and I'm  
also excited that we're gonna be able to try a 
whole array of different authentic Filipino food
take a look at this friends how good does that 
look I decided to go with fish this time around  
I got some veggies some rice some noodles 
and then I think this is like fried banana  
or plantain if I'm not mistaken and then just a 
little bit of Pineapple super excited to dig in
now unfortunately the second part of what we 
were going to do on this tour did not work  
out which was this epic zipline uh just outside 
of sabong it started pouring rain and it looked  
like it was going to continue into the afternoon 
so unfortunately we did just have to head back  
to downtown Puerto Princesa and that was the end 
of our tour nevertheless I had such a phenomenal  
time visiting the underground river and I would 
highly recommend you check it out if you happen  
to be in the area because this was absolutely one 
of my top highlights of my time in the Philippines  
speaking of which this is my last full 
video of my time in the Philippines the  
next video that you guys will see of 
me is me actually heading to my new  
country so stay tuned for that as always 
I'm sending you guys so much love I hope  
you're having a fantastic day and keep 
being your own kind of beautiful bye guys
