From everyday meals to special events
They're always available in restaurants, fast food chains, karinederyas and tapsilugans.
The simplest and most underrated kind though are found on the street corners
Which Filipinos call KFC, short for Kanto Fried Chicken
This humble fried ulam that is both tasty and affordable
Fills up the tummys of Filipinos on a daily basis
And today I’ll share with you the best Kanto Fried Chicken you can find in Marikina City
Alright!
So we got an order of one whole piece of fried chicken
Kanto Fried Chicken to be specific
It’s mostly known as KFC to us Filipinos as seen anywhere else in the Philippines
Mostly in the street corners
It’s just very local and affordable
And something that can be shared with the family for a really affordable price
And it’s really tasty
KFC of the Philippines
And this is my top recommendation here in Marikina
Ever since I moved here this  is really the best Kanto Fried Chicken for me
So far that I highly recommend to you
And I’m gonna try it right now
After 2 and half years of waiting
I ordered it with a serving of rice, served in a plastic
So you can just have it for take away or eat it at home
But I’m gonna eat it here
And also the chicken goes with vinegar and as well as a sweet type of sauce
I’m not sure what this is
Maybe a sweet kind of gravy
So those 2 are the combos
But this chicken was served piping hot, it was freshly cooked.
Kuya has been cooking it since 2:30 in the afternoon
And everyday he cooks about around 70 whole pieces of chicken
And they have atleast 2 big pots oil bubbling
He fries all of them masterfully and it’s very hot in the kitchen
But you see it’s very and people come and go
Just take their chicken for take away
They can get like one whole piece or per part
Like if you want just the leg or just the neck or just the wings or just the thighs
Or just the chicken breast
Or even just the chicken skin!
Just the chicken skin is already an ulam or really a partner for rice and then vinegar
That’s really good
So let’s start
Okay, look at that!
One whole piece
Look at that!
It’s piping hot, I can’t even touch the plastic
Oh man
Aton’s fried chicken, the smell of it…
It smells so savory
Ughh!
Freshly fried
Let me try…
Oh my gosh!
So hot
This piece right here is the chicken breast
Thank  you!
They just gave us a plate
So, let’s move everything here
Since we have a plate
Woooh!
Look at that!
Piping hot freshly cooked deep fried chicken
I’m gonna show you per part
So we have here the chicken leg
Chicken wings
Look at that golden brown
Fresh from the deep fryer
Next, let’s get some piece of chicken breast
Perfectly cooked inside, looks so juicy and moist chicken breast
And then we have here..
I believe this is a part of the chicken thigh
Look at that!
The meat looks so tender!
And look at the chicken skin
Looks so crispy
I’m looking for the neck actually
I can’t find the neck
Never mind I’ll find it later
So let’s try the chicken wings first
Let’s go
Ow!
Mmm!
So crispy and juicy
Chicken wings
Look at that!
Super hot!
I love how tasty it is from the breading to the meat
It is well seasoned
Because for some fried chickens
You will only taste the seasoning either from the meat or from the skin
But this one you have the flavor, you have the taste from both
Really juicy and piping hot
Oh my god
So good!
Now, let’s try the chicken leg
Mmm!
Oh man
Mmm!
The meat is so so soft and tender
I love it
For those chicken leg lovers
Red meat part of the chicken lovers
This is for you
Then let’s try the chicken thighs
Chicken thigh is my favorite
Look at that
Still very hot!
Oh my gosh
Let’s try it
Oh yeah!
Juicy juicy meat and ultra crispy skin
Gotta get my rice
Poke the plastic
Mmm!
Now we’re talking
Chicken
And rice!
Mmm!
This is my type of chicken rice in the Philippines
So so good
Aton’s fried chicken, you have to try it
Here in Marikina!
What an amazing street food meal
You can never really go wrong with a plate of freshly fried crispy whole chicken
If you’re tired of your usual fried bird I highly recommend Aton’s fried chicken
A definite must try when you come to Marikina City
