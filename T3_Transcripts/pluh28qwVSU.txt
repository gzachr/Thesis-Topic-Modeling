No it's really good!
[Left:] It reminds me of something at Starbucks, like a refresher
[Right:] Yeah
Like this tastes like something you would get at Starbucks
Really?
Like on ice, yeah
Okay, I'm okay with this
Like I could feel like someone would charge $8 US for this
Oh yeah, someone could definitely swindle me into paying like $10 US for this!
Three two one!
What's going on everybody!
How is it going?
My name's Xiaoma
And welcome back
To the international Xiaoma food TV show!
YouTube show, sorry about that guys
What we do on this show
It is our job to bring amazing foods from all around the world...
To people here in New York City
We are in Times Square
Today guys we have something very special
I need to tell you a little bit of a story
The other night
I went to a delicious Filipino restaurant
Here in New York City
I've been getting very into Filipino food recently
And it was so great...
But then they brought out something that I never had before
It was a juice!
They said something called calamansi juice
They said it was Filipino lemonade!
And I was like, what are you guys talking about
What's Filipino lemonade?
Never heard of that before
So then I tried it
And I was like...
Whoa, this stuff is good!
And so then what happened...
Was that I spent an entire day yesterday
In New York City
Looking for this calamansi juice
And I found it!
I found it, come here guys!
Yes!
This is it
No
This is just the concentrate
If you don't know what calamansi is...
It is a citrus fruit
That's very popular in the Philippines
It has a little bit of like a lime, kumquat taste
It's really really good
I mixed it with some water...
And I put some ice in it, because...
Traditionally people like drinking it very cold
So what we're gonna do today
Is we are gonna find some people
Who've never had this before
You know people around Southeast Asia
Do like this
But in America very few people have ever had this before
So we are gonna see what people think about it
Today!
Okay?
And if this is your first time watching
The Xiaomanyc international food show
You guys could leave me a subscribe
Little subscribe button over there
Would be very appreciated!
So today we have a beverage called umm...
Calamansi juice
So it's kind of like a lime that's really popular in the Philippines
But it's like a really popular drink there
And have you ever seen this before or heard about it?
No, I'm not sure, no
Cool, alright great
Are you a fan of lemonade in general?
I think I like lemonade, but we'll see
Yeah, just give it a sip and let me know!
I like it, yeah!
[Xiaoma:] Yeah?
[Guy:] It's good
It's really sweet
It's not as sour as lemonade, so I like that more
I like it, yeah!
I like it!
You wanna try?
Cool!
You guys wanna try?
[Guy:] Yeah, just try it
[Girl:] I'll try it
It's really sweet!
Yeah it's sweet!
It's real good though!
How does it compare with regular lemonade that you might drink?
I'm Mexican, so we usually use limes, not lemon
Okay, yeah
So it tastes a bit more similar to that
Interesting
Yeah
This is called calamansi, it's a citrus fruit
Okay
Popular in Southeast Asia, have you ever heard of that before?
No
Okay, cool
But I'm willing to try it
Alright, awesome!
Are you a fan of lemonade...?
Yeah, I love lemonade
Cool!
It's really good!
Yeah?!
Yeah!!!
It's really good!
How would say the flavor compares with lemonade you've had before?
It's different, like it's nothing like lemonade
I would drink this over regular lemonade any day
Really?
Yeah
This is really cool
[Xiaoma:] Awesome, thank you so much, really appreciate that!
[Girl:] No thank you!
Thank you!
Have you ever heard of that before or had it?
No
No? Okay, cool, so...
Do you guys like lemonade...?
I do, yeah!
So this is a really popular citrus fruit in the Philippines
Good!
It's nice!
Yeah?
Yeah!
It's good, it's refreshing, it's not sweet
And...yeah, it's good!
How would that compare with lemonades you've had before?
Like differences in terms of flavor, or like?
Orange, a little bit? Taste of orange?
It has a citrus lemon...
Very zesty, it's really nice!
It's more natural I think
So this
Is a very popular beverage from the Philippines
Called calamansi juice
Have you ever heard of this before?
No
Okay, cool
You guys want to take a cup?
Okay
It actually tastes good!
Yeah, it's good, yeah!
I want some more!
Yeah!
This is good!
Reminds me of drinking lemon and honey
When you're sick
Oh yeah, yeah
That's what it reminds me of, definitely
Tastes good! Different
And like, with ordinary Minute Maid lemonade or whatever,
How would it compare with the flavor?
This...
It tastes natural, it tastes more natural
Natural, okay
Wow, John, it seems like people are really liking the lemonade!
Maybe you want to try some, huh?
No
No?
I don't want to try
Why?
Because it's...
What?
Weird
Weird?!
No no no, now you gotta try!
Really? Okay, let me try
Or actually, you know what?
We'll wait until the end to let you try!
Okay
Wait, this isn't like poisonous or anything...?
You're not gonna kill us, right?
No no no, definitely not poisonous, no
So let me show you what it is...
So it's a calamansi...beverage
Have you ever heard of calamansi before?
No...
It's a citrus fruit that's really popular in the Philippines
And also around Southeast Asia
So I actually made...a lemonade from it
What's your YouTube?
Yeah, so Xiaomanyc
So...X-i-a-o...
I don't mean to offend you...
Totally fine!
We're just drinking something from a stranger
Yes, definitely giving stuff to strangers [to drink] is not something that happens every day, for sure
And remember to subscribe!
Alright, okay okay!

I'll even subscribe!
We have to drink it at the same time
Yeah
We have to do a cheers
Alright!
Okay
Ready, cheers!
Cheers!
Oh that's good!
[Left:] I like it!
[Right:] It tastes kind of like tea!
Like lemonade tea
Yeah
Lemonade tea!
I mean that's not the right answer...
[Xiaoma:] No, that's totally valid!
[Girl:] No it's really good!
[Left:] It reminds me of something at Starbucks, like a refresher
[Right:] Yeah
Like this tastes like something you would get at Starbucks
Really?
Like on ice, yeah
Okay, I'm okay with this
Like I could feel like someone would charge $8 US for this
Oh yeah, someone could definitely swindle me into paying like $10 US for this!
Right
Okay yeah, this is pretty good!
How would this compare with regular lemonade that you might drink?
Like what are the differences...?
This is less, like, tart
Yeah, less tangy
Yeah, this is sweeter, I feel like?
Right
Like, yeah, I feel like...
I'm no food critic...
No, I just feel like
This is like a little bit more sweet
Instead of sour or tangy
Right
Yeah
I'm for this, I like this more than regular lemonade
I think I do too
Yeah, I'm a fan
Go Philippines!
Thank you guys so much
You're welcome, have a great day!
Alright, have a great day guys!
Thank you!
You're not charging us for this, right?
No no no, totally free, totally free
Alright
We have a drink from the Philippines
Called calamansi
Have you ever heard of that before, or had it?
Nah, never
Okay, it is a citrus fruit...
I want to go there though
I want to go to the Philippines!
People really like turning it into a lemonade sort of beverage there
And also for culinary uses as well
Who made it, like where is it...
I made it
You made it?
Yes
Basically you make it either from the fresh fruits or from the concentrate
That's cool man, that's what's up!
So let us know what you guys think about it!
Alright
I think it tastes good
It's not...too sweet
It has a good taste though, it's kinda like...
Water, but like...
[Left:] ...flavored water
[Right:] ...yeah
But it's definitely sweet enough
I could drink this for sure, if I had some ice
Do people mix alcohol with this?
There's no bad aftertaste either
You could put some Grey Goose [vodka] in here
It'd be alright!
Yeah, you'd have a little cocktail, yeah!
Yes sir!
For me...
I think I would probably drink
One bottle in a whole day, honestly!
Yeah, this is pretty good!
This is right up my alley, so...
Yeah
I'm messing with it!
You know what? This was a very interesting drink
A lot of people said it was less sweet
But a lot of people said it was more sweet
A lot of people really liked the natural flavor
Of this drink
[Xiaoma:] They said it was very...
[John:] Okay, let me try!
Oh yes yes yes!
That's right!
Now...
We have to...
You've been listening to people talking about this all day
As a result you want to try?
That's why I want to try
Okay
I'm sorry!
Dude!
It tastes like...orange juice!
Orange juice?!
Yeah
Why?
But some...
...sugar inside!
I like it!
Yeah!
Nice!
Wow!
Anyway guys, thank you so much for watching
And uhh...
We'll see you next time!
