 Is it gonna break? Is it gonna break? How much is it? I'm Boahai, I'm Ganga B. And welcome back to MGMD. I'm Boah Syovina. And today I decided that I wanted to laugh. That is why I am reacting to a video called Pinoy Fanny Moment Compilations 2020. Bawaal Tumawa Pinoy Epic Fails. Pinoy Puro Kahan. Kahlo Kahan. There you go. I really, really want to relax today. It is Friday and I just want to laugh with you. Alright, but before we start, please consider following me on Instagram at Music. News and of course, of course I cannot forget about my amazing patrons who are supporting me on Patreon and where they get to watch exclusive reaction videos. And I will be reacting to HBD by Dunel in Bartolome. Probably I will release it this Sunday. Yes. Alright, get your popcorn and let's start laughing. What's up? What's up? What's up? Is he trying to say what's up? What's up? I think he's saying what's out? But it's what's up. Oh my god. Uh oh. Uh oh. Uh oh. What a dumbass. Oh shit. He almost killed his mom or aunt or something. Slow mo. Oh shit. What's going to happen? Oh. Poor cat. Oh no. Don't mess up her. Oh shit. Oh. It's a good start. I'm laughing already. Oh my god. Yeah. I hear Filipinos have a lot of chickens like that, straight chickens and dogs that make a lot of noise. Good day. Good day everyone. My topic is all about the good day. Welcome to the club. In my case, it's the traffic by my window. It's horrible. Big trucks that make a lot of noise, you know, come through this street because they go to this area that is under construction. It's not too far from my place. So it's a lot of noise. And that's why I cannot wait to move to my own place because I'm putting money aside to buy my own place. And where I'll be able to soundproof my studio so that I wouldn't have to deal with all this outside pollution. You know, noise pollution. Seriously. That is so stupid. Come on, man. Oh. I'll cheat. What is he trying to do? Is he serious? Wait. That's metal, right? Is he gonna... Oh, oh, oh, oh! What the hell? Nice. That was a cool hack, man. I love it. You know, the funds, the money to go to a water park, do this instead. Oh my god. A pool in the back of a truck. That is so cool. That is smart. Where is he crying? He's so cute though. Where is he crying? He's so cute though. What are they saying? Oh, why? What are they saying? Oh, why? I'm going to get to person zone. Bye, gone.

Dude, you're so horny. Oh my goodness. Oh my god. I've seen some crazy things today. It was funny. I have to admit there were funny moments and I have my favorites. Honestly, the swimming pool in the behind the truck, that was awesome. But there were some funnier moments and I think the best ones were at the beginning of the video. And I think they should leave the best ones at the end of the video so that you watch the entire thing. But I had a good laugh and it made me feel great. So if you have better videos than this one, don't hesitate to send them to me. Because from time to time, I like to laugh. Because usually I make serious reaction videos where I analyze music. But from time to time, it's nice to just laugh and relax. So there you go. Let me know in the comments section below which one of these clips is your favorite? And did you react the same way I did? So yeah, as usual, my name is Alamad Pot. Thank you so much for joining me. I hope you guys are going to have a great weekend. I will catch you in the next video as usual.
