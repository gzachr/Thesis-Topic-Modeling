- Hi, I'm Beryl.
And the theme for today's
video is jackfruit.
(laughter)
Before we get into that,
I want to tell you about the artist today.
Her name is Natalie Andrewson.
I actually met her at
Comic-Con in New York city,
and I absolutely loved the whimsy
and the kind of fantastical
nature of all of her prints.
I'm leaving a link to
where you can follow her
and check out her other work.
Now, not all jackfruits are this big,
but this was the smallest
one I could find.
Let's roll the tape to how
I got this bad boy home.
So I actually went to
Hong Kong market again,
because I saw that they
had jackfruits last time,
but I didn't realize
that the only jackfruits
would be these ginormous monsters.
It cut me when I was trying to lift it up.
The woman was laughing at me
when we were trying to check it out.
She said that it looked like
I was going to be carrying a baby around,
but I was adamant that I could
fit it into my tiny backpack.
Ultimately, it was a successful trip,
but I had to take a cab home
because it was so heavy.
I need to put this down,
it's too heavy and awkward.
You may or may not be
familiar with jackfruit.
I'm familiar with it
only because the fruit,
when it's unripe,
is a very common meat substitute
for vegans and vegetarians,
but outside of kind of making
fake shredded chicken with it,
I really don't know much about it.
So I thought that this would
be a great opportunity for me
and all of you to learn a
little bit more about the fruit,
let's do it.
I got to bring this back to the kitchen.
Okay.
Okay, see you there.
It was at this point that I realized
I had made a terrible mistake.
A jackfruit, you see does
everything in its power
to stop you from cutting into it.
Not only is the skin super
thick and hard to get through,
but it is full of sap,
so much sap that I
couldn't touch anything.
And I learned after the fact
that you need to use oil,
I'm using this coconut butter
to help ease the cutting.
Second thing I learned is
that getting the jackfruit out
is a nearly impossible task.
I have sped this footage up by 5000%
and this is just one quarter of a half.
I broke down this entire fruit.
It took me like three hours,
three hours to get these
pieces of ripe jackfruit
when some of the jackfruit
that I need is unripened
so that's a story for another day.
I did it and now let's begin the video.
- Hi.
My name is Medina and I'm from Bangladesh.
The jackfruit dish I wanted
to share from my country
is called Kathal er Bichi Bhorta,
which means mashed jackfruit seeds.
The dish is made by using
seeds of ripe jackfruit.
Normally the seeds are
pan fried and then mashed
with spices herbs, and
sometimes cooked fish.
Its a savory dish,
normally eaten with
white rice or as a side
with other main dishes.
Its savoriness is kind of interesting
because it comes from the
sweetness of the seeds
and the spiciness from the
spices mixed in the mash.
Jackfruit is the national
fruit of Bangladesh.
Therefore, most dishes
prepared from jackfruit
are actually very popular
as people find it very interesting.
And there are various ways
to get creative with it.
Bhorta, which means mash,
mashes are very popular in the country.
Mashes are like the
staple food in Bangladesh.
And another interesting fact
jackfruits are very accessible
around the country.
You can find it in
almost everyone's homes.
I love this dish because
it's very healthy,
it's very simple, it's made
with our national fruit,
and especially because
it's a family favorite.
This dish reminds me of my big
brother because he's usually
busy and I don't get
to have meals with him.
So whenever he's visiting my parents home
and we get together,
my parents always prepare this dish
because it's one of his favorites.
Everyone should try Kathal Bichi Bhorta
because it's so simple.
Most importantly people should try
because they don't need module.
Module means delicious.
- Okay, we are starting
with mashed jackfruit seeds.
And before we get too far into this,
I do want to say that the
first time I made this,
I messed up a little bit
because when I tasted it,
I nearly choked.
It turns out that the jackfruit seeds
have this very hard, but
clear, shell on them.
So when I remade them,
I took off that shell.
The first time I was
being really dangerous
using this knife, then I realized
if you kind of smashed them,
the shell came off more easily.
That's just to say,
I did have to go and redo it a little bit.
And I'm having this with rice.
This is so surprising,
and delicious, and spicy.
These are the seeds.
I love the idea of cooking
with the whole fruit
or vegetable.
It tastes kind of nutty.
Like, I mean, I know it's a seed,
but it doesn't taste like
a nut that I know about.
The flavor of mustard seed
oil is really coming through.
And they do want to say this one thing
about mustard seed oil,
that might be interesting.
You may notice here on
the mustard seed box,
it says for external use only,
and that might be like,
"Oh, Beryl don't eat that.
"That it's only for
your skin or something".
That's not true.
They put that on the label
because of some weird food rules
that we have in the US and in Europe,
I'm leaving an article
that talks all about this
in the description.
So you can check that
out and see for yourself
that it's very much okay to
cook and eat mustard seed oil.
It is such a beautiful flavor.
And if you're somebody like me,
who likes to have oils and vinegars,
that is one that I definitely recommend
you add to your repertoire.
This is one of those dishes
that never in a million years
would I've ever even
come across on my own.
I'm so happy I did.
Definitely going to be making it again.
Plus I have more seeds.
- Hi guys, my name is Giovanna.
And today I'll be introducing you guys,
the Coxinha de Jaca that is translated
to the jackfruit coxinha.
It's a popular treat.
You're in Brazil, it's a
very common street food.
And it's a deep fried dough
filled with jackfruit,
but usually it's actually
made with chicken.
So this is the vegetarian
slash vegan version of it.
Then I have one here with me, is this one.
It's this beauty.
Look at it's beauty, it's amazing.
I love it even though I'm not vegetarian.
This is one of my favorite
version of Coxinha.
It's like the perfect comfort food.
Many people haven't eaten.
Some people actually think
it's going to taste sweet.
It's not sweet, not at all.
It tastes like chicken for real.
Brazil has a lot of different cultures.
And I feel this one gets everyone
because everyone enjoys it.
I feel like a kid every time I eat it,
it's kind of nostalgic.
Enjoy your Coxinha.
It looks like chicken, but it's jackfruit.
I love how creative
people can be with food.
(laughter)
- I'm not sure if I did this right.
Okay, here's why I'm not sure.
So I cut it because I don't know
if like the dough is cooked
the whole way through.
You know, when I fried it it was brown.
But the other thing is like the dough
doesn't have anything in
it that makes it unhealthy
to eat if it's raw.
So I'm not like so concerned,
but I'm also not feeling
terribly confident
with my deep frying skills.
Which you would have thought that by now
I would be a little bit better at it.
But I don't think I am.
Okay, Jackfruit croquette from Brazil.
Hot, oh my God.
All right.
Is this dough cooked?
It taste's good, hot.
It tastes very tomatoey
and I really like it.
The stuffing is good, it's so good.
Oh my gosh.
Even if this dough isn't cooked
the whole way, I like it.
It's like kind of soft and chewy,
kind of feels like potatoey almost,
have you ever made dough
in a hot pan like that?
I've never done anything like that.
It was so soft.
The dough felt like a silky blanket.
I like this.
The jackfruit mixture was so delicious
and it would be so good, like on a pizza.
Oh yeah, that would be really good.
Oh, I ate the whole thing actually.
I didn't even realize I was
like so busy thinking about
the dough and chit-chatting,
I ate all of it.
Well, obviously I liked it
as somebody who's never
tried it with chicken.
I would still say the jackfruit one,
I didn't miss the chicken.
- Hello, my name is Fazza and
I live in Salaam or Malaysia.
So the jackfruit dish
that I would like to share
with you all today is called Madai Goreng.
This dish actually originates
from the Bundja ethnic group
from Indonesia.
It is considered a traditional
food by the generations
of Bundja people that
currently reside in Malaysia.
In Bundja, Madai means the inner
layer of the jackfruit skin
that is fermented,
whereas goreng mean fried.
To make Madai Goreng, you
firstly need to make the Madai,
which is the inner layer
of the jackfruit skin
that is then fermented
for at least a few days.
It is then stir fried
alongside shallots or onions,
garlic chili, and dried anchovies.
It's almost similar to your
basic vegetable stir fry,
but there is no sauce
and it is much crispier.
This dish is the perfect
combination of spicy and salty.
The skin might look spiny and even hard,
but when it is prepared properly
and is fermented enough,
it becomes soft and easy
to chew when cooked.
Malaysians really just enjoy
spicy and salty in general.
However, most people actually do not know
about this dish, mainly because
it's usually exclusively
made by the Bundja people.
It is part of our history
and one of the many examples
of how we will not waste
any part of our food
as a form of survival.
Is also a great entry
point to Bundja cuisine,
which I personally think that many people
are missing out on.
So that's all from me, I hope
you liked this dish a lot.
Beryl, thank you.
- I don't think I made this right.
I do not think that
this is correct at all.
And that's okay,
kind of.
The first reason is that
Fazza sent me a video
showing me how to ferment
the jackfruit skin.
As you can see the jackfruit in this video
does not look like my jackfruit did.
So that was issue number one.
Issue number two is
like when I took it out,
it was still like really hard.
In the cooking video that Fazza sent me,
it just looks totally different.
So that's why I don't
think this is correct.
All right, I'm just going
to try this concoction.
Here's the skin.
It's very tough, and very salty.
The anchovies are good.
This doesn't taste bad, but
it also doesn't taste great.
And I'm honestly just going
to track it up to the fact
that like, you can't win them all.
You can't like there's bound to be times
where I'm going to royally mess up.
And I kind of feel like
this is one of those times.
I will also say I definitely
fermented this skin.
First of all, when I opened
it, there was like bubbles.
You could smell that
fermentation was happening.
And the process of using salt to ferment
is something that I've
done before with lemons.
So I didn't, I don't
feel like I did it wrong.
I just think I used
the wrong skin somehow.
I don't know.
I messed up, I'm sorry.
Womp womp.
Okay, next dish.
(relaxing music)
- Hi, Beryl and hello universe.
My name is Nyla and I
live in Vancouver, Canada.
The jackfruit recipe that I
wanted to share with you all
today is called Khatar
ke Tarkari in Fiji Hindi.
In English it is called jackfruit curry.
Fiji is warm and humid.
It is below Hawaii and above New Zealand
in the Pacific Ocean.
Fiji is surrounded by
beautiful turquoise waters.
And you will find an abundance
of plants, flowers, fruits,
and vegetables, everywhere you go.
Jackfruit curry reflects
the flavors of Fiji
because it shows the mixture
of different cultures
and recipes that were brought to Fiji.
Fijian cuisine is made
up of Indian, Chinese,
and indigenous Fijian recipes.
Fiji is a land of abundance.
This dish is typical of Fijian cuisine.
The ingredients of Khatar
ke Tarkari are special
because they incorporate
natural foods found in Fiji
and spices, which were brought
by the indentured laborers.
It contains mustard seeds,
turmeric, garam, masala, chilies,
and lots of other spices.
It is savory, really salty, nutty,
and it has a slight sweetness to it
because of the jackfruits
natural sweetness.
It is part of the complete
meal and it is often eaten
with a starch such as
rice or roti, a flatbread.
I think that most Fijian people
know about Khatar ke Tarkari.
It is something that everyone enjoys
and it really represents
the diversity found in Fiji.
I like this dish because
it is extremely filling
and savory and comforting.
I often associate it
with wonderful memories
during my childhood.
And I often associate it with
spending time with my mom
and grandmother.
- Okay, this is a green
jackfruit curry from Fiji.
Of course, I couldn't
use any of the jackfruit
that I cut up for this, that's okay.
I'll figure it out, I will figure it out.
This has curry leaves,
which are my favorite.
It is so good.
The roti that I'm having with this,
my mother-in-law actually
sent it back from India
with my husband.
We have been very sparingly eating it,
but I decided that this dish needed it.
Yeah.
Curry leaf,
I understand the curry
leaves can be really hard
to come across.
And so I don't think that
you should write off a dish
just because you can't access
them, especially this one.
And when it comes to the
spices, like, you know,
if you're not willing to
start and buy all the spices,
which can be really
expensive, and I get that.
I would just go with kitchen gig.
It's not going to give
you the exact same flavor,
but it'll definitely get
you more than not trying it.
Jackfruit just kind of like tastes like
whatever you want it to taste like.
The other thing that's interesting is that
I feel like green jackfruit
has become more and more popular.
And so you can easily
buy it canned or frozen
at tons of different stores.
You don't have to buy, you
know, a huge one, like I did.
This is honestly absolutely delicious.
It was so easy to make as well.
Gosh, I just love it when
you guys give me dishes
that are easy to make.
(exciting music)
- Hi, my name is Caroline.
- I'm Alma.
- And we're from Fairfield, California.
The dish we want to talk
to you about is turon.
- [Alma] It's almost like an egg roll,
but sweet and caramelized
as a dessert dish.
And the inside has a Saba bananas,
but we can't find that here.
So we just use plantains
and then sugar and jackfruit
and just roll it up in
almost like an egg roll.
And the outside is caramelized.
- [Caroline] Yeah, it's so good.
- [Alma] You don't eat it
with a dip or I never have.
And we eat typically with our hands.
They serve it in the
streets in the Philippines,
or a lot of people have
it in parties at home.
- [Caroline] Turon is definitely a staple
in the Philippines.
Most Filipinos love sweet snacks.
And so it's like the perfect combination
of sugary sweet with local ingredients.
I love turon because it's
addicting, the jackfruit,
the Saba, the sugar.
And just in case in this lumpia
makes the perfect like Mylanta or snack.
- [Alma] Yeah, and it's
so nostalgic I think.
- [Caroline] It is.
- [Alma] It reminds me
of gatherings with family
and friends and just that good feeling.
Like you just look over
where all the food is set up
and then there's always
that like tray of turon.
- Yeah.
- And then you're always like, all right,
it's time for dessert.
- Yeah, it's easy to
make and it's delicious,
like what else can you ask for?
(energetic music)
- Okay.
I'm trying to also go right
now with like a little bit
of like a spooky vibe
because of Halloween.
Anyway, very excited
because I finally got to use
the ripe jackfruit that I cut up
and also watching Alma and Caroline,
talk about this and eat it.
Yeah, that's going to be crunchy.
(giggling)
This is going to be loud.
Hot.
Well that wasn't graceful.
Jackfruit on its own, honestly
tastes kind of like a mango
and a banana had a baby.
Whoa, who came up with this idea?
I wanna know.
They're like, let's take
some fruit, healthy,
cover it in sugar, roll it
in paper and deep fry it now.
I like the way they think.
This one kind of looks like
a little more caramelized.
Hot.
One day I'm going to learn my lesson.
But I don't think that day is today.
Hot.
I just want to say to
everybody like eating on camera
is humbling and it's terrible
because like when you're eating
in front of other people in a restaurant,
people aren't just like
focused on watching you
take your bites.
Right now, you guys are
just watching me eat.
I can't look cool eating something so hot.
When I first started rolling these,
I really didn't know how to do it.
But then I read the instructions.
Delicious, absolutely loved them.
10 out of 10 would recommend
your family and friends
except that like it's hard to eat.
It's hard to eat nicely.
(exciting music)
- Hello everyone.
My name is Angelina Cannon.
I live in Mumbai India in
my native place in India.
Jackfruit is the state fruit of Kerala.
So the dish that I wish to
share with you all today
is called chakka payasam.
This dish is indigenous
to the state of Kerala
and it's called so in the
native language of Kerala,
Chakka in English means jackfruit
and payasam in English means pudding.
So in English, this dish is
called jackfruit pudding.
This dish gets it sweetness and color
from the use of jaggery.
It has little chunks of jackfruit
and it's stocked with loads of dry foods,
especially cashews, and
desiccated coconut pieces.
This dish reflects the flavors
of Kerala in a wholesome manner.
All the ingredients used in this dish,
I cultivated in the household
and religious of Kerala.
So whenever you take a drive
through the roots of Kerala,
you can definitely see trees
of jackfruit and coconut.
The flavors of Kerala
are definitely different
from the different parts of the country.
Kerala is a coastal state of India
and the flavors here are different.
I believe even most people
of India wouldn't be aware
of this jackfruit for the main dish.
Jackfruit is my mom's favorite fruit.
And as a kid, I didn't
used to like this fruit,
whenever it was brought home
because of the strong smell
and typical taste.
But my mom has pursued me into liking it.
So whenever my mom makes this dish,
it reminds me of my family members.
And it traces me back to the memories
of my native place Kerala
for all the celebrations
and the sedan means that I've had.
- Okay, my last dish is a
Indian jackfruit pudding.
It smells so good.
This is my first time
finally cooking with jaggery.
And I'm very excited, I love the color.
It's just this beautiful,
like toffee brown.
(upbeat music)
Whoa, whoa.
It's like malty, kind of.
Malty, is that like?
Like the the sweetness has
like a really nice bitterness
to it as well.
It's not just super sweet.
It kind of reminds me of like,
maybe like a fruit cake as a pudding.
(upbeat music)
I'm not really tasting jackfruit.
Or am I?
Oh, I am tasting jackfruit.
In general, I find Indian desserts
to be very, very sweet.
And this one is very sweet,
but the jaggery sweetness is different.
I think for me,
it is still like a bit on the sweet side.
So I couldn't eat like a big bowl of it,
but it's really lovely
and a great way to use my fresh jackfruit.
Two recipes I called for
it in this whole episode.
I mean, I did use the seeds
and I did use the skin,
but whoops.
(giggling)
Anyway, we had fun.
I think this episode was amazing.
I am so sorry about my fail, Fazza,
I hope you can forgive me.
Oh, I'm still thinking about it.
I feel like we should do another fruit.
I don't know, tell me
which one we should do.
I enjoyed this one,
maybe one that's a little
easier to cut up, please.
Thank you all for watching.
And I will see you in my next episode.
