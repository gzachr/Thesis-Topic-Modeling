I have quite like her skin tone. Her facial structure is quite soft. Did that make sense? I know that felt like an acupressure. Yeah, yeah. And she looks to me the most. Like naturally done art. Like she's obviously got little work made upon. But I also think maybe the dynamism of the hair is quite flowy. And it just looks quite serene. Um. I think I'd say it's hard on her. It's hard on her. Yeah. The pressure. Maybe C. C. Yeah. She has just like a really strong like bone structure. It's one of those like western beauty standards things. I'm really nice. I'll go with C. C. It can't be but not a Y. I like it. Uh, I know. I know. I thought she had him lost her words there. He was just staring into her beauty. I love you. I love you. I love you. I'm probably going for C. You're going to be C. One of two. C.O.F. And just a feeling for her. Oh, this is going to be tough. You're honest, yeah. I've got like at least talk to you in my list. So it's probably either E or B.

They are a pretty. Not big. Hopefully we don't know A. So I like to see. See? Yeah. Why see? Because the face is kind of symmetry. Yeah. So it's kind of nice to look at. B and C, we did it pretty yesterday. B and C, yeah. Okay. I'll go with B. C because she's more tan. And I'm not tan, I love tan. I think I'll go.

That's where he said his way. Ah, and then all the blue. No clue, yeah. He likes eyes. He's got, he's got pretty eyes. And now we've got the fine young man. I would go for, I would say B. He's got quite an angular jawline, but it's not too angular. They're hard to move, they're done. It's like, it's got definition, but it's quite soft. So it's a kind of nice combination of both.
