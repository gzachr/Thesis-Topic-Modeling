mmm oh yummy i will turn this into this
so i want to try some dutch pinoy 
fusion dishes and so today i will  
use the dutch frikandel so the nice 
thing is we can just heat up the oven  
at 220 degrees so these are all 
the ingredients that we will use
some boiling water
frikandel goes in
boiling water pork meat cooking oil to make 
the pork nice and crispy our frikandel is ready  
reduce the heat a little bit carrots garlic onion
so we're just mixing everything it 
smells amazing one cube of chicken stock  
chinese cabbage red chilies pancit noodles 
so at this point i turn off the heat just  
mix everything and it's almost time for our 
frikandel we'll add our soy sauce lemon juice
and we're just going to cut these frikandel 
in tiny pieces like this after our pan set  
finish off with a lot of spring onions fresh 
parsley and some extra lemon juice so that's
