 Alright guys, for today's video we had a crazy idea which isn't our own because someone has totally done this video before us. We want to say credit to Manna from 123 Japan. But today we are trying Filipino alcohol. That's when you get this. So it's Filipino alcohol. Filipino alcohol. Actually, you don't need to do it because we can get a sound effect online. Do it again and I won't do it. Filipino alcohol. We saw Manna do this video. We were kind of jealous that she could get drunk on a video and use as an excuse. I love it. Let's do it. Alright, we've moved outside because we thought we'd fun to have a little party on our balcony here this evening with you guys. We've never filmed a video here before. Or we filmed on the balcony but like not a whole video. We hope it's not too noisy. It's about to actually storm some of the talons. It's going to be. It's getting dark so it's going to be the worst idea ever. Today we have some Filipino alcohol. Some we've tried before. Others we have not. For example, the deadly one which we were thinking we're going to leave to last. This gym which we just went to our local store when we were out. And this was 90 pesos which is so, so cheap. There's like Â£1.50 for quite a lot of gym. Ginsenghai alcohol can get spirit. That's not really a cost of a lot more money. And it's quite a big bottle. The guy when he sold it to us was laughing. So like, is it gin? I hope it is. It's his ginna bra on it. Ginna, ginna, ginna, yvra. Oh it's quite some ago. OK, so what we're going to do is take a sip of each of these drinks. A lot of them are beer and we're basically going to rate them and then we're going to compare them with each other. So you can do the one that is picked the first one. So we've got some Miguel super dry first of all. You can be the one that decides how much we have of his first beer and vice versa. We are drinking some of the white people of Apaglava. I don't want to waste any. So we've got a proper trial. It's not the glass one man. So we're going to give a little mini review each. Then we're going to go straight to the next one of all compare it. So this is San Miguel super dry. I don't think I've ever had this before. I may have done. I can't quite remember. I can't let me have that only one. I can't remember where. That's right. Cheers. I can't. All that's good. I love that. I'm really hot and sweaty right now because it's like humid and stormy. I feel like this is so refreshing. This is a great idea for a video. We should do this more. By the way, if you're under 21 or under 18, whatever country you're watching in, you don't have to do this at home, OK? But if you are over, grab a beer and join us. I like that. It's fresh. It's crisp. It's got a lot of flavour for a lager. Yeah, that's good for me. I really like that too. He doesn't taste that dry to me. It does taste really crisp. I guess it's crisp, dry. Yes. Kind of like the same thing. I just want to live more. But I won't. I've got to finish it for four more minutes once you've only got one glass of each, OK? You might get slowly drunken this video. I don't know. Or quickly. Some of these things are lethal. OK, out of 10. Seven. OK, I'm going to go eight out of 10. That was strong. So, solid beer, I choose that, I drink it. I'd be very happy with that. Next one, we're going to go with. You're picking for me, I see. I thought we were just working in a row. We've got a sandwich all like I've had this several times. They say it's a lower, yeah, 100 calories per bottle for any of you dieters of fancy beer. That's a good, that's good for like morning drinking. It's 10am right now. It's not. I'm so hot, George. This is like, ah, ah, ah. This, they need to drink it. They'll rob it on our bodies. You do realise you say, let's do this video. Again, see, but this is the video. We have to find more alcohol to do another one. Oh, we'll just do it from a different country. Let us know if we've missed any here. And if you want a part two, get yourself in the comments. Let us know where we're going. OK, cheers. We know. I think you're meant to cheers and hold eye contact the whole time. We're doing it. Cheers. OK, pick up. Wow, that is so different. So, so that you can taste the light. It's got more water to be taste. Wait, I always thought this, I really am surprised. I think because we are, like we said, with McDonald's and Jolly Meal, we've never tried them back to back, like, that quickly. They've never had like, I'm at McDonald's to open a Jolly Meal. We think they are kind of similar until you do it back to back. Exactly the same has happened here. They are so different. Really firm. Definitely dry. Same. I 100% prefer the first one. But in my lifetime, I drink way more, Sammy Glyts. Me too. I think more. This is like a go-to beer in the evening if you just want one or two. Definitely. Because it's a little bit lighter. But, oh, we're not saying the strengths. Really? The mana would be upset with us. 5% that is still strong for a light beer. I thought that was one that you have if you're not when you get to. I thought that was like two or three percent. Okay. Okay, and what was the dry? The first one is five percent as well. So it's just about calories there. It's just about calories and taste. There's no strength difference. So that means I can choose this. Okay. So out of ten. Out of ten, I'm going to go, it's still a nice light beer, but I'm only going to go six out of ten. I think I'm going to five. I really don't like it. Now I'm having it next to that one. I think it tastes like kind of pointless compared to that. It doesn't feel like you're having a really nice beer. It feels like you're having one to think. It feels more gassy as well. Yeah, I'm really like. Like, gassy already. Yeah, me too. I'm glad it's not just me. Are you all right? Yeah. At least you can't be drunk already. No, I'm not drunk. It's just so gassy, I feel like I need to go. Is it? I'm right. Right, onto the next one. Next one. It's another beer. Oh. This is okay. So this is the real light one. This is San Meg. Gosh. Zero. Look at the percentage. That is not one. I thought it was one of your like pregnant or you don't want to get drunk. Pregnant. What are you on about? You don't drink alcohol if you're pregnant. No, no, no, I didn't know. I didn't know I had alcohol in. I thought it was a non alcohol bit. Oh, no. Because I read it and said zero. And you know you get like, by the way. Oh, like the beer is for driving. Yeah, exactly. But it's three percent still. That's the last one. This should not be called zero. But it's zero calorie. So it's not zero. It's not zero calorie. Yeah. Oh my god. No, it's 60 calorie. What's zero calorie? Where did I get the zero name from? Okay, summing zero. So it's got first ever time trying. So it's got slightly less calories and alcohol percentage than the light. Okay. So this is probably going to be even worse for us because we like the dry lot. Have them gone. Or this could be really, really delicious and really light. Yeah. And I'm not a nice tasting. Ah, ah, ah, ah. Oh, why am I doing this? I forgot. Oh, it is. I'm drunk, okay? Oops, I poured way too much. Sure, what is it? Yeah, it's light. Do you know what I thought of? I thought I was having a bottle, you know. I'll hear a little mini-gray. Can't wait. No, I think we'll get a bit of cheese for our apartment. Yeah, true. Right. I poured more. Me more. Me more. Cheers. Alright, cheers. Let's do this one a bit different. Cheers. Oh, one of these bad boys, five. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Does that smell like my 16 year old parties? Yeah, when I used to go to parties. Oh, we drink any, the cheapest alcohol you've got. Oh, no man. So that tastes really light, really watery. It tastes like you've pulled out beer and then filled out with water. And something else. I don't know, there's something in that. I'm really not a fan of. A bit soapy, actually. It tastes like something. I'll sort of just wash these glasses up. Not a fan of soap. I don't want to finish that. Oh, we've got to finish it. Oh, my gosh. Are you drinking me? All of these are down to here. Yeah, we need to have a bottle. We're going to be so drunk. I don't want to waste them. It's meant to be like a little sip. You'll actually be really drunk. Just for video. It's just for YouTube video. You don't get drunk when you're filming videos. If it's like almost a whole bottle, let's half a bottle each. We're going to get to the red horse. It's a lot of liquid and a lot of alcohol we want to go. Before it gets dark. So we actually want to have a Russia. I'm everything for tonight's video on or done any of those responsible things. I don't click dinner. Dinner. You'll see us on Instagram later on. Like, we ordered so much takeaway food. So I put all the food. Rolling around on the floor. I'm getting into this now. You know when you go to a party and you loosen up, you have a few drinks. So you go out to a bar and eat things. You're not really fancying it. And then you're like, I'm going to get a drink. I'm going to get a drink. I'm going to get a drink. I'm going to get a drink. Like, a kid. Remember when people used to go out to bars and stuff? Ah, good old days. What's this? I'm opening it already. This is a classic. San Miguel, pale, pills it. We don't recognise it because normally it's in that really cool, like rustic old-fashioned bottle. Yeah, exactly. Fun fact about San Miguel. People in England where we're from think San Miguel is Spanish. Yes, true. It's actually a Filipino grant. We learned this when we first came to the Philippines. Which is why we're drinking it in our Filipino alcohol video. Exactly. If you didn't catch on already. But all of them we've had so far have been San Miguel. San Miguel is pretty much the main beer here, isn't it? Exactly. And with that guys we are proud to announce tonight's sponsor. No, it's not. We can even say that. It's my joke about it, should we really? No, not really. We both had this one before so let's see how it compares. Do the other ranges back to back? I'm looking forward to it because I'm kind of fed out of these light versions. And we know we like this but how interesting will it be if we don't like it? Yeah. Because we always drink this. This is literally my go-to. Like Ireland vibes. When we're travelling on islands, provinces, they've always got a Sammig pale. Hold yours up next to my mister. What's this all about? It's all right, it's equal to just camera illusion. Cheers. That tastes fruity. That does taste...oh my god, yeah. Flavors I've never thought about when I've drunk this before. That is citrusy, isn't it? That is really strange. Oh, pause rewind. We didn't rate the last two beers. Oh, it did. Didn't we? Out of ten. Wait, you've mixed up the order. This needs to go here. See we get the game drunk. We're getting drunk. Okay, rate the zero. I'm going to give it a three. Oh, oh. Yeah, three out of ten. So mine for me is 753. George is 86. Okay. Six. I'm planning on editing this video tonight. Yeah. So I'm probably going to be drunk when I'm editing. So I'm probably not going to do like all the fancy numbers. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, I don't know, what did I say this was seven? Do you know what? I think it's like six and a half. Six and a half? Okay, I'm going to go seven out of ten. It's still a nice beer, but it does taste a little bit different to what I remember compared to the others. The first one is still my favourite by far. Can I change that to an eight and give this a seven? Yes. I do, I do, comparing it to the others, I really like that a lot more. You can, but I'm not changing the others. Okay, that's fine. It also tastes a bit foamy. It's really smooth. Way more smooth. Less crisp than all the other beers so far, right? It's not crisp, is it? No. You're drunk now. No, you're not here. No. We both just lied. We both just lied. You're drunk, aren't you? I'm feeling it. I'm feeling it a little bit. We don't drink much anymore. Sure, I know, but literally we have a nice appointment or a beer at the weekend. Do you know what we don't drink anymore? Because we haven't hung out with Mike and Ellie Prager. Even at the beginning of lockdown, we were having a beer at night on the balcony or two. That's true. But now, I think we're not used to it, so we're going to have headaches tomorrow. Wow. People will be like, why are you hung out with our crazy night? What did you do? Oh, we filmed this video. We are. What? You're enjoying that one, aren't you? You realise at the end of this video, we have to finish these beers. I'm not wasting this. I've already bloated. Okay. I'm really struggling. I can help you with that because next up, we don't have a beer. This is a Tandoi. I'm not sure how you say this rum. It's a Filipino rum. Tandoi? Tandoi? Tandoi. Let me know, hey, pronounce it in the comments, guys. It's a Tandoi ice. So I'm guessing it's like the equivalent of a smurn off ice. Which is normally vodka. Yeah, I don't think this camera is going to focus on it, but you get the idea. What flavor? Great fruit, is it? I feel like I'm free drinks, and I'm about to go out, genuinely. Where's the garlic plant? We'll finish this video, being all right. Where we going? No where. Always the sliding off. This is a risky, cool, decent dish. Not that anyway. Up, scented. 5%. That's quite strong for this kind of thing. Citrus flavours. That looks like an orange and a grapefruit to me. Okay. All the lead was just fully off. It's going on. It's a great suspicious now. Have you heard of a straw pido? Yeah. Okay. Don't make so much of the... Why didn't you finish the beer? You silly little boy. I'm going to mix that with beer. Give me a bit more because that's just going to taste like beer. Okay. It's not that strong. Huh? Well it's 5%. It's exactly the same. It doesn't feel as strong. It's going to taste like grape juice. Oh it's a grape juice. I mean it's going to taste like fruit. Citrus. Okay I'm dry. Wait, just smell it. Oh. It smells like medicine. I've got to say wait wait wait cheers. And then you're like wait wait wait wait. Smell it. I just want you to smell it first. Like wine tasting. That smells nice. This is the kind of alcohol that you can drink. Kids medicine. If you don't, it's not for kids. No, no, not kids. This is not kids medicine. It smells. You give this to your kids as medicine. There's something fundamentally wrong with you. No. Oh okay cheers. Alright, okay, okay. It tastes like fizzy pop. How is that 5% that's really scary? I think I can drink that. I can literally finish this. In the morning if I need it too. Like I just, it does not taste like alcohol. It's kind of hard to compare this because it's not beer. It's like a rating system. Yeah, yeah, yeah. My love. I'm drunk. I'll happily go in there now. I think I'm drunk already. People won't need to be like you idiots. You had like two bottles bar. We don't drink much I said. But it's within like 10 minutes. Am I like downing them? Actually, this is really bad. Is it responsible? Of course. Which is put up the drink responsible message. Yeah. That you should only drink responsibly. What? That is the message. That's it. There's no like extra beer. That is it. Let's be down. You say it is no like, there's more to it. You're like, we're going to put up the drink responsibly message. Because, you're like, we're going to put up the drink responsibly message to drink responsibly. That's it. Out of 10. I actually really like it. It's a bit too sweet for me personally. I'm not that much a sweet person. I'm really not very nice. Do you know what? I would never choose this drink. But if I'm reviewing it purely on the drink and not like my own opinion. Well, that is your opinion news. No. My opinion just of tasting the drink, right? Well, yeah, that's what we're racing out of 10. Not about your opinion on anything else. I wouldn't order it, but I'm going to give it a 9 out of 10 because for the drink it tastes good. So you would order it then? No, I would never order it. Why not? But it's 9 out of 10. You're in Paris. No, is it taste good? A fruity drink. No. It tastes good. Why would you order it then? If it's a 9 out of 10, we're just higher than any of the other beers. You would order it. Oh yeah, I would order it. For me, I'm going to go like stepping out of 10, I think. I still prefer this. Yes. I'm going to go for the red horse. The number one beer, apparently, in the Philippines, red horse beer, Oh, we chose the extra strong. Is it not just all of them extra strong? Are they? Okay, maybe. So basically, we've had a few nights on Red Horse. We have had... It's Mike and Ellie. We were at a crocodile parking devout, and we're drinking buckets and buckets and buckets of Red Horse. We've got drunk as a... We spent the day eating crocodile, and then we just drank a little Red Horse. What is our life? That's mental, isn't it? That's crazy. We've got a question to self when you get that level. And then we went to a karaoke bar. We went to like a normal bar, but George Dick, who are you on stage in the band. And we also had a night in back year on Red Horse, where we got drunk with them guys on the barbeque. Any night you drink Red Horse is a good night. We also had a really memorable night in Camaghan with Brian, who walked you Brian from Bintana, Saperizo, where we stay in Camaghan. That was a night on Red Horse. We're a big fan of the beer. It's 6.9%. Beer. 6.9%. That's really high. 7%. I think my double IPA in Canter in the fridge... That could have come in this video. Out of 10, are you feeling drunk? I mean, out of 10. You wanted to bet yourself out of 10. Out of 10? Like 10, really? 10s like dancing around on the floor. Like 3. Okay, I'm like, yeah, 3 as well. You're so thinking sick. What? You were so about to say sick. 7. Okay, so... I'm going to take this off of you because you're talking about it and shaking it. And you're just going to get it every year in your face. Oh! This is for you. And it's all over my dream. Red horse just does that. Red horse is like, can't handle me at my words, but don't deserve me at my best. Is that the message of red horse? It gives you a warning when you crack open a can. It's like... It's like... It's going to distract me. Are you prepared for this night ahead of you if you drink me? Okay, ready? Cheers. Oh, that's my... Okay, that smells... Oh, no, that smells the hangover. That literally makes me feel so hungover. Not even drunk. It makes me feel hungover. The next day when you still smell of the beer. Oh, I don't want to drink here. Okay, okay, okay. I'm not into this now. Hey, do you know what? I like that a lot. I like the taste a lot. Yeah, me too. But I think it does his dream at memories, and that's why I like it. I'm like, oh, good times. The thing with red horse, it doesn't taste like a strong beer. It tastes like a normal lager to me. Maybe a little bit stronger. Quite like... Quite bitter. It does not taste like a 7% lager. No, you wouldn't know. You can just drink bottles and bottles of it. The Encanto tastes a lot stronger. Yeah, so you sip it slowly. This is just like a lager. You just drink it. Dangerous. So I'd give it a 7. It's still not as good as this, but I'd say it's kind of on par with the pale pills. Yeah, I'm going to go 8 out of 10. I like red horse. It's a nice strong, big beer. You feel like you're drinking a proper beer. Yeah. It's good. 8 out of 10. Guys, it's Friday night, doesn't matter. It's all good. Friday night. Are we going to order food tonight? I'm thinking we should order food. Okay, now we have a Sam again, flavoured beer. So I know they do an apple, an apple flavour and an lemon flavour. I had an apple flavour on that pan, that pan, that pan beach in El Nido on our first Philippines trip. You remember that. And I think it's a lot on my head. Someone commented the other down the vlog, but Lucy's memory of events is so vivid. Yeah, it's kind of weird. I don't remember things like whatever breakfast. I should have do remember that. You remember, I remember so many specific things. I can like look back on something and be like, oh yeah, I was wearing a pink shirt. My trains were this. It was this time of day. I saw that. Even like when we go somewhere, like if we breathe it somewhere and we're on like a scooter, I told her, how do you know you're going? I'm like, oh yeah, it's just up here on the left and we visited there once. I know exactly where it's weird. What I'm not going to that is apparently drinking. So we are now going to try this apple flavour beer. I think I prefer it to the lemon. I've had the lemon one once, I think. But again, I've only had this, a few times. It smells very sour and sweet, doesn't it? Oh my god. Does anyone have an apple sour? Yeah, has anyone ever had an apple sour? This reminds me of my 18th. And my friends 18th. So my friends 18th, we all went to like the local town in our hometown in England. The local bar. And one of our friends sisters was working in a bar and she gave us free apple sour. It's all night. It's sour, it's their classic. They don't taste like alcohol either, so you can drink it. No. But this, oh, that takes me back to feeling long. It smells really good. It smells like a nice sour apple sweet. It's not the best thing is. I'm still young. This is confusing. I can't. This is confusing. Comment below, George, eye contact. This is confusing because it looks like beer. It is beer. It's this apple flavored beer. We got that apple flavored beer and the... Okay, out of 10. Is that what we're doing? I can't remember. At this point, I'm just drinking it. I quite like it. It's nice. It tastes really good. It smells great. It makes you feel happy. At this point, I've forgotten that we're filming video. And we're just two people drinking on our own. Yeah, do you know what? That's tasty. It's easy to drink. It's fun. I'm going to get seven out of 10. Okay, guys, we're on to the last alcohol we're trying. You know alcohol. We're going to get inside. I'm scared of the rain. We're going to shot in the rain. Okay, we're going to get in the rain. And then we're going to do the outro inside. Okay, we're going to get wet. So let's just put the redis out. This is cold. I'm actually going to show you this one because it's special. This is the gin that we bought from the guy for 90 pesos. And he was laughing when we bought this. We were like, can we buy that? Is it Filipino? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's really cool branding. But it looks like it looks like a devil on the floor with an angel with a sword. And he was like, do you want to try it? And then we were like, oh, we'll just buy it. Oh, my God. It's really, and it's like laughing again. What's the percentage? Ingredients, water out the whole sugar. But it says 80 prus. Does that mean 80 percent? I think that's 80 percent. No, gin's not really 40. This is absent. Basically. Oh, that's what you was laughing. Okay, I think you can hear the rain guys. We need to move indoors. But we're going to have a very quick, very quick, only a little bit because it's strong. Okay, I'll just get it down you. It's gin. It's not too bad. You've mixed it with beer again. That was my beer. It was a little bit beer. Cheers. Ready? Straight down. Okay. In the rain. Oh. Okay. Okay. Not a fan. That tastes like, that's burning my lips and burning my mouth. I think it's too strong. That needs a mix of it. A bit of tonic. It might be there. It does taste like gin, but it's pretty lovely strong gin. No, no, no, no, no. We'll save this for a better night. We need to go and party. Let's go. Okay, we made it inside. We've escaped from the outdoor store. I need to get so much to do tonight. Now I've got a lot of content to do any of it. No way, we're just going to party. We've been putting some music on when we're done. We're going to get... So gin out of ten. Two. I'm going to give it a three because it tasted like good gin. It tasted like gin. I think I might try it again with a tonic. It was so strong. It was so strong. Yeah, so so strong. It's not nice to shop gin at the best of times. So I feel like I'm not really into shopping gin. That's true. But it's probably a pretty nice gin to have with tonic. I would say so. We're going to save it for when we can have friends over. Yeah. Alright guys, thanks for watching this video. We're going to leave it off here. We hope you enjoyed it. My eyes are going up. We're feeling a bit spaced out right now but there we go. That's what happens when you film a trying alcohol video. Man, if you've watched this video, please comment below. You did a better job than us because you didn't seem to get to affected by the bit. Your friend in that video is hilarious. Let us know in the comments if you missed any Filipino alcohol that you want to try next time. Got two and give us a video. I thumbs up. If you enjoyed it, subscribe for the channel. If you're new and we'll see you in the next. See the alcohol doesn't affect me doing the outro. Because it's like a script ridden in your head. So good. Dayage. Bye guys. Bye.
