 Hi, good evening. Welcome to a foreigner in the Philippines. As some of you may have seen in the video that I did on the trip down the hill to music, that it ended on the way down it ended with bumping into, not literally of course, but bumping into our friend Alfred. Our friend Alfred brought to mind one of the recurring themes in our channel which just refuses to go away. But I can think of there are two recurring themes in our channel which just referred to refuse to go away. One is that we get ladies asking can we fix them up with foreigners. Which actually we can't really all that we can do is offer a platform where messages can be exchanged by the really determined and as I explained our friend Steve and Marge were determined enough and now have a great relationship for life. So you can come on and you can do it. If you're determined you'll look at the way that people talk I'm guessing it is difficult now until the comments are back for good but that was the way that it was working. Now why would I be saying that Alfred I brought this up again? The other theme that just never lies down, it's dead but it won't go away. And that is what is the biggest obstacle for a foreigner coming here and actually settling happily within and integrated into the community of Filipinos that he finds himself in. Yet to assume that we set up the situation as being one in which the man has found someone that he loves very much has settled down married or not and now has an extended family of Filipinos both male and female and probably because of his situation that he has a reasonable pension and some savings which is willing to invest into either the family or his extended family or his own family of his lady and possibly the one or two children she may all may not have. The biggest obstacle is arrogance. Sorry to say this and I know that there will be people on the phone. Oh listen who's talking and yes you will be right. It's for foreigners talking to me the script is nearly always the same that the Filipina that they're with is just wonderful but hard-headed, stubborn and unwilling to change which brings you smack up against the problem itself and that is that just because you're a foreigner and just because you have come from this highly technical country be it Germany or anywhere in Europe and and the UK and the US and on and on and on and you may have come from living in a house where you have it all you know you never you never do anything by hand you don't you don't like the cooker and and pull out a pan and lay two pieces of bread down and and then watch it in case it gets burned as you make toast you you have a toaster then you don't make rice and and put your finger in it like Filipinos do and and say oh it's up to the the first joint and then I know that it will get perfect rice you have a rice cooker and you have another cooker and then you have four hubs on your cooker and then you have a freezer that's as big as the refrigerator well you have a refrigerator and you have a car sitting out there and a second car in case it goes wrong and you change it every two years you're used to being the last time that I was reading on this was ten thousand dollars in debt on a credit card and paying beautifully paying off your minimum payment so that you'll get it paid off eventually let's hope that you're still alive when that finally happens but you're as stubborn in your own way as Filipinos are here now there is such a thing as it being almost genetically programmed into your behavior and your response to certain people types characteristics you know the British the British have been up war in one way or another be it attitude opinion like or dislike with the Germans two world wars and underneath it all there'll still be that little thread of an emosity probably which anybody with a pulse will soon overcome if they meet a German that is well as willing to change in their attitude as they are right the Filipinos have that too they've been conquered they've been they've been ruled they've been subjected to their lifestyles the culture of many you know they're at a pretty rough time with the Japanese sorry to our Japanese friends but it is a fact the Spanish were here the Americans had to go at it I'm not quite sure I think even the Brits might have had to go I'm awful surprised that they didn't succute so you can see that there's there's there's an emerging national spirit that that seeks to become its own person its own nation here within the Philippines and when a foreigner comes over and wants to show them how to do everything guess what they get a little bit humpty about it they don't want to be told what to do every time now if you are a person that has struggled with a problem or two and has gone to a friend and asked their advice so Harry what what would you do if you were me you just handed your life over to Harry Harry is going to tell you what to do at every turn including how to stand up without hurting yourself and which way you should be brushing your teeth well because you asked him and it becomes a right to exercise his opinion all the yours and it will happen now I've seen letters to me where people are going to they're going to show the Filipinos how to do it I've been watching I've been watching how they do their brick work oh my god when I get out that I'm a Mason I've been working as a Mason for over 30 years there's nothing that you can show me about laying a brick and when I get there I'm going to show the Philippines how to do brick laying no your not because they have their own way every expat every foreigner to a man will tell you that the hollow block are no good the hollow block are no good well that's something of an exaggeration it's not that the hollow block are totally no good because they built their houses with them but the specification is not the same a friend of ours Steve there's just because we were discussing it and we were discussing the fact that with our our present project building project to be because we can't afford to continue anymore with it at the moment we consider that it will be a good investment to buy a block making machine they're actually rather simple they only produce four blocks at a time but you get to control the mix and it's in the mix that the criticism about the blocks emerges they don't put enough of they well they just don't do the right mix to reach the specification that you would find in the UK or in say the US and Steve made the point that 300 psi is the way that they measure it well they measure it in psi are not a brick expert and I'm not here showing the Philippines how to do it so I can admit my humbly that I don't know exactly how that works but just look at the numbers 300 psi in the Philippines and in California it's something like 1400 psi now that you don't have to be a brick layer to understand that there's a great deal of difference in the quality of the block in California to the block here so here they've worked they've worked with 300 psi and they build their houses and the houses sometimes stand and sometimes they don't now when I was in California I was in Silma in 1992 when they had the big earthquake I think it was 92 and I watched this extremely advanced nation with all of their code high code and right close to Silma where where I lived near the foothills I saw these wonderful wonderful overpass freeways great stretches of overhead roads and they're wonderful what what they fell down wonderfully as well so nobody knows it all the next time you find a man who knows it all run away because it will be a very boring time now that brings you to what is the biggest problem that you will have when you come to America and come from America and live in the Philippines or from the UK or from Australia you will be used to doing things in a certain way and guess what they don't do them that way here so let get used to it a friend of ours his son is an extremely technical guy knows he's one of those people is very clever gets called into troubleshoot when things are going wrong they'll call him in to to get it to go right and he watched one of the videos that we made where I was having a tire changed we driven the truck into the bay they jacked it up on a trolley jack and then they took the wheel off there were children in the truck I sat on a seat close by and watched the guy did his job he put the thing back on and we went on our way he didn't have a hard hat he wasn't wearing gloves he didn't have knee pads he didn't have steel tolled safety boots in fact if I'm not much mistaken it may even have been working barefoot just imagine that and all of these things were cited by our friends son oh my god no hard hat no no knee pads no gloves no no trolley jacks a trolley jack without a without an axle stand working in bare feet or and and he all horrified him as it would if it was in his own country and at one point he had said to my friend his dad you know what I like what I'm seeing mostly in the Philippines I think I would like to go and live there and I wrote to him and I said I give you two days and you will be totally insane because our little trip to the tire place was typical of everything that happens everywhere here things are done differently now as I've said many times the one thing that us us arrogant foreigners usually miss and that is that people are happy and forgive me if I keep saying that because let's face it in America one of the most most popular dominant phrases is the pursuit of happiness the American dream and the pursuit of happiness and the people that come here have not found happiness no matter how they have pursued it and they come here and then in the misguided arrogance they want to change the way that the Philippines is to the way that wherever they've come from is imagine that you run away from a place because you're not happy and then you want to make the place that you run away to where the people are happy you want to make their country the same as yours seems extraordinary to me thanks for listening bye for now
