I'm about to go swimming with some whale shark I 
am an Oslo at the southern end of the Cebu Island  
still on my trip all around this beautiful island 
and yeah whale shark watching is one of the must  
Do's here many people just come to this area to 
do exactly this I have never done anything like  
this before so I am very excited hello just 
walking here yes sir yes okay thank you okay
yeah I have never done anything similar 
before so I am very very excited  
it is early morning now so let's check 
it out hello hello good morning hello
snorkeling maybe afterwards ah thank you no scuba 
diving yeah you can either do scuba diving here  
or you can just uh hop on one of these 
boats and go snorkeling basically  
um okay let me see where I have to go
and how long I have to wait a registration
good morning good morning I want to draw swimming 
with the sharks I register here yeah yes okay

diving is more expensive yeah okay and then so 
I register here and then I have to wait here
you want to come with me
how long is the waiting time
thank you so much
hello good morning
all right I think 500 so that's 
the locals and for tourists so  
no double pricing here and I think 500 
for such an experience that sounds okay  
okay that's not that's too early let's 
see first how the experience is going  
and then we can judge about it 500 is it 
the same price for foreigners and locals
yeah okay okay so the same price 
thank you so much okay so we can  
have a quick look already so we have 
these small little boats and I think  
actually we're not going far out I 
think it's very close by actually
okay just right here
for verification for the priority number 
down here or here here okay thank you  
I feel like a super clueless tourist here
okay remember okay thank you so much
okay thank you yeah it seems to be not too busy 
here which is good because this is a very touristy  
place you never know sometimes it can be really 
crowded but okay rules for your safety and for  
the protection of the whale shark as well so first 
this you are not allowed to touch the whale shark
no I don't need fin no no thank you oh we need a 
life jacket okay thank you you need a number okay  
how about flippers
I would like to have just the glasses that's all 
I need and yeah that briefly explained some some  
rules like you're not allowed to touch the whales 
whales uh or the Sharks I would say and no cameras  
with flashing lights so uh yeah just some some 
basic rules hello I can choose run okay is it  
all the same size okay then it doesn't matter 
which one if you want to use the uh snorkel over  
there I think I don't really need a snorkel but 
maybe let's get one just to be on the safe side
I'm very excited now oh this is gonna be 
cool first I was wondering whale sharks is  
it a whale or is it a shark to actually asked 
my sister she is studying veterinary medicine  
and she's also really into diving stuff like 
that and she explained me it's actually sharks  
so whale sharks not shark whales you know 
so and I think some of them can get quite  
quite big are we going about here book number 
117 sir 117 and I give this to the boat yeah
boat number 117 all right I 
placed the snorkel here now
hello good morning hello I can leave the 
bag on the boat yeah and there's something  
uh not just a towel and a T-shirt nothing uh
now I'm very happy that I bought 
these water shoes yesterday maybe  
you remember the episode where I bought 
them because we have many Roxy underwater  
so the shoes are quite handy now is it done 
please okay I think it's starting to rain  
but I think that doesn't really 
matter we're going to get wet anyway
yes I make a YouTube videos 
about this yeah my name is
you want to say hello David you're from nice okay 
okay so you do this every day here is it still  
exciting for you yeah yeah still nice right 
okay Philippines yeah then you will find it
not today no no I need some days to to edit  
and upload but in a few days 
you can you can see it yeah
so we are just going over there not 
really far yeah they come so close
that actually comes so close but 
I think they come so close because  
they they feed them here that's how they 
attract them that's my my guess at least
so you feed the sharks right
also but I mean in general the sharks get 
fed here right okay yeah that's how it works
oh the water actually has a nice color here  
and I can see the ground from here 
so it's really clean or clear water
inside here
it comes you're done
so I just slowly go into the mountain
so you need to talk maybe later let me 
let me have a look first thank you so much  
okay let me have a look first 
before I will point the camera down
okay no sharks should be seen so far
I guess I'm as soon as I put the 
camera underwater the sound will  
get worse because the water is blocking 
their microphones so I don't want to put  
the camera down too early to open 
I think there's oh my God thank you
okay that's a quite a quite big one over there
foreign
while we are looking at the footage of these 
incredible animals let me do a voice over let  
me share some interesting facts about these 
animals that I found on the internet first of  
all like I explained earlier already they are not 
railed but they are the largest fish in the ocean  
whale sharks can reach up to an incredible length 
of 12 meter which is 40 feet and some of them  
weigh around 21 tons and whale sharks are filter 
feeders being a filter feeder whale sharks cannot  
bite or chew and instead of biting and chewing 
they mostly filter Plankton through their guilds  
for nourishment during feeding their mouth can 
stretch over one meter or four feet right and  
yeah using their guilds whale sharks can process 
over 6 000 liters of water every single hour  
oh the rail just touched me
oh that was a little bit scary and whale sharks 
are actually very slow swimmers moving at the  
speed of no more than four kilometers per hour 
or three miles an hour long and whale sharks  
also have teeth thousands of teeth although they 
don't bite or chew but these three thousand teeth  
are very tiny less than one inch long and they 
help them to actually eat small shrimp fish or  
Plankton that's crazy how how big they are 
they're literally just swimming by right  
in front of us and I think we're going to 
stay out here for half an hour all right
what's also incredible to know about these animals 
is that they have an incredible long lifespan  
these beautiful animals have an estimated 
lifespan of 70 to sometimes up to 100 years
all right really cool experience definitely 
a must do when you're in the area I really  
enjoyed it and yeah if you haven't seen the 
previous video of this road trip all around  
Cebu Island where I checked into a very 
nice Beach Resort Hotel and check out the  
video right here stay healthy stay positive 
and then see on the next episode ciao guys
