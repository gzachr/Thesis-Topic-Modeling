 Hey it's me Rebiyati, welcome back to my vlog where we're all about keeping it real and of course having a good laugh. So today I am bringing you a unique entertaining and slightly controversial topic. The top 5 dangers of dating a Filipino woman. Now I know what you are thinking. Dangerous? Really? But don't worry, we're not talking about life-threatening situations here, okay? Instead, we're shedding light on some of the funnier aspects of dating a Filipino woman that you may not have expected. Before we jump in though, I want to emphasize that this video is meant to be lighthearted and humor, and not a sweeping generalization of all Filipino women. I know that not all Filipino women fit these stereotypes and the purpose of this video is to poke fun at the misconceptions and stereotypes, not to offend anyone, okay? So sit back, relax, and get ready to chuckle as we explore these dangers. Imagine coming home from a long day of work and finding a full spread of adobo, sinigang, karakare, waiting for you. Your partner's family might even send you over a whole afternoon for a weekend feast. Be prepared for an endless parade of Filipino dishes that will tempt your taste buds and test your appetite. With all this mouthwatering dishes, you might find yourself struggling to keep up with the culinary adventures that await you. And don't even think about turning down seconds. It might just offend your partner's mom or grandma. And with all the delicious food and frequent family gatherings, you might find yourself packing on a few extra pound. Picture yourself in front of the mirror one day, realizing that your favorite pair of jeans no longer fit you. Filipino families are known for their strong bonds, and when you're dating a Filipino woman, you're dating her family too. So get ready to attend countless family gatherings, birthdays, reunions, like you're just enjoying a quite weekend, and suddenly you receive a text from your partner. There's a last-minute family get together, and your presence is not only expected, but required. So remember, attendance is not optional. It's mandatory. Just imagine attending a family gathering with your Filipino partner, where you're introduced to countless relatives. There are aunts, uncles, cousins, second cousins, and even third cousins, the event is filled with laughter, games, and of course more delicious food. And also, don't forget and don't be surprised about the Tita inquisition or auntie inquisition. When you embark on a relationship with a Filipino woman, it's important to remember that her family plays a significant role in her life. One key aspect of Filipino culture you'll quickly become acquainted with is the ever-watchful eye of the Titas or aunties. This strong loving and protective women take a keen interest in their niece's love lives. Ensuring that any potential partner is worthy of their beloved family member. So be prepared for that Tita inquisition. A series of questions and gentle probing from these curious aunties for the term in to make sure you're the right one for their need. They'll inquire about your background, your family, your intentions, and even your cooking skills. So navigating the Tita inquisition can be challenging, but it's essential to stay calm and collected. By winning over this influential family members, you'll not only gain their approval, but also their support and blessings, which can make all the difference in fostering a happy and lasting relationship with her. So brace yourself for the Tita inquisition and be ready to charm your way into their hearts. Okay, picture the scene. You've been diligently practicing your Tagalog or Visiant phrases. Eager to impress your partner's family during a visit. As you try to complement her mother on cooking, you confidently say what you think means delicious. Only to be met with a pro-use laughter. Gago! It turns out you've accidentally told her that her cooking tastes ugly. Well, language barriers can be challenging. They also provide opportunities for laughter and light-hearted moments. So navigating this linguistic hiccups can be amusing and endearing. By trying to learn your partner's language, you demonstrate your commitment to understanding her culture and building a stronger connection. So don't be afraid to make mistakes along the way.

And as you continue on your linguistic journey, remember that laughter and a good sense of humor are essential ingredients for overcoming any communication obstacles. With time in patience and plenty of practice, you soon find yourself confidently conversing with your partner and her family. In the Philippines, many people consider fair skin to be more attractive. So, don't be shocked if your partner offers you a skin-widening soap or lotion. Just imagine you're out shopping together and your partner casually slips a skin-widening product into your shopping basket. Remember, this isn't an insult to your complexion, but rather a reflection of cultural beauty standards. Philippines Filipino women have a knock for maintaining extensive social media networks. When you start dating a Filipino woman, be prepared for your life to become an open book. Your partner's friends and relatives will know your every move. So, be sure to make a good impression. Just imagine posting a photo of your date night. In within minutes, you have comments from your partner's entire extended family, analyzing everything on the background, everything on the table, everything around. And if you plan to take her to your home country, don't be surprised if one day you stroll into your room and find her diligently feeling a large cardboard box with a variety of items. Clothes, can-goods, toys, and more. You may be perplexed by this unusual assortment. But fear not, it's all part of a cherished Filipino custom known as sending Balik Bayan boxes to family members back home. As you assist her in packing, you'll likely uncover the stories and memories connected to each item, resulting in a heartwarming and relationship strengthening experience. So embrace this one-of-a-kind tradition and you might even consider contributing a few items of your own to the box, demonstrating your appreciation and understanding of her cultural heritage. As we wrap up, let's remember that our goal today was to explore the lighter side of dating and to challenge some of the stereotypes associated with Filipino women. In the end, it's important to recognize that each person is unique and no two individuals will have the same experiences.
