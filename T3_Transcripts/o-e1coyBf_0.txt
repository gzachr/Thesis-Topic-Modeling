 It's funny more, it's fun. Okay, go yo. Well, it's 5.20 in the morning. My guys are working already. Ready for harvest. And if I go over here. These guys are high, high. Morning! I'm going to go over here. I'm going to go over here. I'm going to go over here. I'm going to go over here. I'm going to go over here. I'm going to go over here. I'm going to go over here. Go over here. I'm going to go over here. I'm going to go over here. I'm going to go over here. I'm going to go over here. Okay, here we go. It's going down. It's going down today. But first, you are having... I'm having my... Cha. What's Cha? Tea. Is this a traditional thing you do every morning? Yes. My traditional thing. Okay, you don't look stressed yet. No, I don't care anymore. I'm stressed. All right. He's so cool now. He's so cool. He's... He's commanded that way. All right, he's got bossing... What's the point of any mong... ...technition? Randy. He's got... he's got bossing, Randy. Who's going to save the day for you, I think, no? I'm just hoping my truck shows up because my truck has all of the ice boxes and the ice. So I have enough ice to kill the fish. But until that truck comes, I can't... ...poss the word. I can't actually do very much. So let's see what happens. Let's see how long he takes, yeah. All right. And you're... Kaya... ...jombo hotdog. Kaya mobatou. Kaya mobatou. Kaya mobatou. Jo kin. Been a long, been a long. All right. My infant, Randy. Morning. So... ...unyapa. Like handbang was so little, didn't he, no? Okay, bites. So this year, this is like a little gate in between two ponds. They've started draining this pond earlier this morning and eventually a ton of bangers. I'm going to Langoy swim through here. Morning, bro. And technician, master, Randy is going to hopefully catch them in a net here. See, bar? All right. This should be interesting. So I think that's the system and then... And more stuff's going to happen. And some's pretty calm right now. And I'm pretty excited for them. This is going to be a unique day for all of us. All right, bro. Oh, they're jumping bangers. I'm back. Oh my gosh. I can go down there. The bangers are starting to come through and jump. I can go down there. The bangers are starting to come through and jump. So this is the first time I've ever been to a bar. I'm going to go down there. I'm going to go down there. I'm going to go down there. I'm going to go down there. I'm going to go down there. I'm going to go down there. I'm going to go down there. I'm going to go down there. I'm going to go down there. I'm going to go down there. I'm going to go down there. I'm going to go down there. I'm going to go down there. I'm going to go down there. I'm going to go down there. I'm going to go down there. I'm going to go down there. I'm going to go down there. I'm going to go down there. I'm going to go down there. I'm going to go down there. Let's be honest. What's more important? A truck. They show us up with friends, coffee and bread, or the ice truck to save all your bangers. The ice truck. But I know what the other compact answer is. The good news is that bread and coffee slash egg truck boat should be here in a sec. I'm going to check this out first. Kumar, the rumors true. You're actually grilling or frying a pizza. Just eating it. Where is that? Look at this. Oh, I kind of sorcery is this one. You're making some new bar pizza. Why not go to the next coffee water? You think ice? What do you think about that Vince? What do you think about that? Unexpected pizza in the middle of the pond. They brought us coffee. Let's have a good morning. Let's go. Right here. This is called smoked pizza. Not already ste. Okay, Anson's looking a bit stressed now. So I'm going to make him a special breakfast treat. Are you going to class it? Oh no. That's the laden. Come on. I don't think I can cook it for him. There you go. See this? Let's do it. Let's go find him. Here we go. It's all about supporting. Support commander. He likes this. Commander, stress. Come on. You can do this commander. Commander. Commander. Commander. Excellent. Support. All right Anson, it's about 7.30. Give us an update. What's going on? Ah. Trunks here. Finally, I'm just hoping he's got a lot of bikes boxes. I'm just hoping he has 50 nice ones. So he's probably coming in there. And ideally, what you're going to be doing is getting these fish on ice right away and then putting them across straight into the truck. And you've got to get straight to Davos these things. Except for a large amount that we'll be seeing here. Secret. Secret. All work out, managing great. Power on. More eggs and bread. Hot dogs. Filipino hot dogs, bread. Filipino hot dogs. You should be walking and get one. I'm flying here. Good flight. Oh yeah. Excuse my turn lines. Go away, legboard. I'm going to go in and take a look and try and get a bangers. Why? Because why not? How many times do you live to get to see a bangers cornbee in Harvest City? I'm doing this for you, commander. We're gonna back off! Oh, it's so deep! I don't even dare to put it down. This year is the rest of the bagels. Some of you do it to the net. I'm gonna go take a closer look. I don't want to get in this way. I'm gonna go take a closer look. Next here today. Mix it. Go, go, go, go! Put it in your pocket! You will provide! Come on there! You got it back on! Vince, what do you think? It's so good! Nice football, man! Let's put some feels. It feels like a French football. He's there! 400 kilos! 400 kilos! He's there! He's there! To be fair, the scales on these are nice ones. These are nice scales, no? Okay, commander, can I buy these? Yes, okay. I've entered the field. I've entered the field! Ilarra, Ilarra! I'll tell you Ilarra, no, Ilarra. Ilarra, huh? Hey, is that mocha? That's mocha. Hey, let's go. Hangyo, hangyo! What's it? Alright, I'll get it actually by these fish. I don't want to do any forehandling here. I don't want commander down to get upset. This is the ending, all the fish are coming through. And then they pick these up as well. Like I'm doing it. Yeah, they're going to go out here and do this. So this is actually going to happen. The guys are going to come out of the pond. What is that, man? What the heck? There's this kind of snake. There's this kind of snake. Oh! Seriously, there's like some sort of claw coming out. That's what I'm doing here. That's so... No! No, they're... No help! Go into the middle. It's easier to walk there. Oh, what is that? Touching me! I don't like this game anymore. I want to get out here. Oh, that's right. Ah! I want to get out. I want to get out. I want to get out, man. I want to get out. I want to get out. It's going to be a big snake. Snakey feel heavy, bangas. Hey! Can I have a bite? A bite? A bite? A bite? A bite? A bite? A bite? A bite? A bite? A bite? A bite? A bite? It's not even a bossing though. I want to wave this off. I like to keep it in the sun. I like to keep it in the sun. I like to keep it in the sun. Thank you, Manon. That's Manon's dog form. I want to wave when I harvest it. Thank you, Manon. Look at his speed. I have a try. I have a try. I have a try. I have a try. I have a try. I have a try. I have a try. I have a try. I have a try. I have a try. I have a try. I have a try. I have a try. That's a good sack there. I have a good sack there. I have a good sack there. OK, so. How do you know if you don't try? I have a surprise in a bit. But for now, I'm just going to try to wash up my legs in the river. And how do I do it? Honestly, pretty well. Yeah, yeah. You got a second. I'm going to wave that. We're going to wave that. I'm actually going to keep all that respect to the workers there. I think they're just having a laugh with me. Or they just think I'm crazy now. Oh, boy. They used to meet. They used to sit down. Just another day. Just another day with the commander D. Yeah. I'm going to go get washed up and we're going to go across there and wave them, pack them. OK, on the ice. I can wave my picket, right? Just a sack. Just in a way of the sack. It's a piece of cake. I don't know if that's a cake. Oh, that's a piece of cake. I thought this was. This is my harvest. Is it OK, are you sure? I hope I have no idea if it's right. You sure? It's morning. 18 kilos. 18-18 kilos. Shit. What's the name of the volume? The aquarium. What do you think? Can you raise a bungalow? I'll let you try that. Yeah, sure. I have a larger way out. No, just in the house. I don't know, I don't know if it's right. No, not probably not. It's banged in the space. I'll let you try that. It's banged in the space. It's banged in the space. You never know. Yeah, that's unfortunate. This is your second... It's what happens. But this is what happens. Yeah. But you might maybe miraculously break even. We'll see. We'll see. I don't think so. That would be it. Right now, you're miraculously even. Like... Yeah. There's pretty much zero chance you're going to pull the profit. What I'm working on now, what if that weren't plus this one? No, I'm still looking at... I'm looking at about 50,000 loss. Which is painful. But not as painful as my last loss. Your last loss isn't much worse. See, Antsongs had two losses now. Man, you just spent three and a half months in a little shack. I'm going to get a chance. I'm going to get a chance. I'm going to get a chance.
