mid-morning just have it be this busy it's pretty 
great I see watches hair ties all types of uh also  
Jewelry accessories oh here we go this might be a 
uh first a good first option here let's see what  
people are eating in here all right hello how are 
you sir I'm good what's what should we order here  
what's the most popular the the plain or with 
egg okay all right so that that how do you say
okay with egg with egg that's that's famous 
yeah okay we get it we'll get it with egg best  
seller okay best seller excellent all right 
well we'll give that a try this is the line  
huh this is the queue the light yeah okay 
all right we'll wait in the light what do  
you think guys good first stop okay so I'm 
gonna totally butcher the name so Tang Han  
abot with egg all right we'll give it a try uh 
yeah we'll we'll queue up it looks like as I'm  
seeing it like glass noodles egg and all types of 
spices with egg with egg uh I think just one okay  
this lady's kind of taking the orders 
the egg yes spam 60 60 okay yep perfect  
dining all right we can just eat here I think 
okay standing yeah we stand okay yeah they have  
of course a dining option but that might take 
a while so if we take it as a standing treat  
I'll hold the ball wall share should be okay 
it looks like you can get it with pork with  
egg with pork and egg uh we'll go just with egg 
I see some kind of fried spring roll they get  
the idea it's a very colorful dish whatever it 
might be oh he's adding all types of Greens in  
there some of it's wet and some of it's dried so 
I ordered what the mass it was the most popular
guys I think it's coming quick
[Music]
standing all right standing it's the best way to 
enjoy oh yeah what's this chili can you throw a  
scoop in there for me all right this lady is 
hooking it up with the hot sauce perfect thank  
you okay looks good all right guys ta-da the 
dish is here that's hot sauce on top so you  
can see it's kind of these glass noodles 
and the broth she didn't go for the broth
that's really creamy it tastes 
like like the broth flavors like  
pork condo okay kind of a hearty a hearty 
broth it should be kelp veg minus the egg  
it looks like just glass noodles and broth okay 
should we bump back to a seat let's give it a try
to it all right how and so Granite you're liking  
it yeah okay I'm gonna get in on 
this broth while you got our Fork
that's good it tastes really like a uh almost 
like a Ramen broth very peppery yeah quite peppery
uh very delicious so a good it's it's hot it's 
hearty it's a good first meal for us I got a hot  
dog coming your way bud Forest is really in the 
mood for hot dog but uh here you can see this is  
definitely the stall to be at is a hustling and 
a bustling we can get in there on these noodles  
oh look at that orange color
yeah I'm saying it's like um like a spicy 
peppery uh amazing mung bean or glass noodle  
dish quite good yeah I can taste the Citrus 
now oh yeah so adding that was a good call  
and I'll switch I'll hold force 
and let Kelly give it a try [Music]  
steamy give it a steam 
coming off the noodles right
oh that's good salty a little bit oily and um 
hearty almost has a hearty feel even though the  
glass noodles are pretty light um should we 
add some vinegar to it oh yeah I think kind  
of the deal is in the Philippines you have to 
add vinegar to everything yeah so in the in if  
you're supposed to add vinegar and chili 
stuff to your food so here's some vinegar  
vinegar oh fish sauce that's a fish that's the 
vinegar with the chili this is a fish sauce so  
all right so I just added a bunch 
of fish sauce yeah vinegar vinegar
okay all right this one just unscrew it you can 
hold on you can see there's a ton of chilies in  
there and garlic just chunks of garlic and chili 
all right that's gonna be quite delicious yeah
trying to get any of the chilies actually in there  
now now I feel like we all have to retry it 
now that's got that fish sauce and vinegar  
added yeah I'm passing it back to you now 
if I put it in there now I don't think the  
broth is vegetarian because it's cooking right 
next to me and I saw a big head in there with  
teeth yeah with teeth I don't know like a goat 
yeah maybe wow all right so this is now with a  
chili powder and no this is not what the uh 
fish sauce and the chili vinegar benefit s
yeah see if it's spicy or not
are you getting more vinegary flavor nice nice
spicy broth is coming from so some kind of uh 
is that is that a goat in there or is that a cow
okay so that's the broth and this broth is what 
goes into the soup from here into there nice okay  
so you get the idea so the beef head cow head 
in there boiling broth is what goes into the  
soup that's pretty darn good yeah this is an epic 
first stop Cedar is uh I think you're definitely  
enjoying it yeah the noodles are fun to eat and 
the broth is really tasty so okay an excellent  
first stop we'll we'll knock out this bowl and 
then we'll head further down the street after a  
hot soup we're calling it soup but now it's time 
for something cool and refreshing so we got the  
original dragon fruit juice right here you got 
the three sizes let's get a small you think I  
think it's small small just to try it so no no no 
yeah so small hello can we have a original small  
foreign yeah that's perfect it's perfect just one 
yeah so you get a big chunk of the dragon fruit  
syrup I bet there's like just dragon fruit maybe 
some sugar in there uh no ice if you can help it  
you try to avoid ice yeah okay so just from the 
corner right here it is just soaking in the ice
oh that looks perfect
so delicious of course buddy you 
want some dragon fruit all right  
you know one of Four's favorite fruits by the way
so delicious chug chug
thumbs up all right we got we got a winner on 
the dragon fruit perspective all right Cal yes
no good so good all right I better I better get 
in on that it's just sweet and it's light like  
dragon fruit it's pretty light yeah I think but 
it tastes good it's refreshing something makes  
it not tastes like dragon kind of a sweet creamy 
flavor you want to try Granite are you gonna avoid
yeah so Granite probably the most wise among us 
because of the ice cream it's stepping out but  
we're you know you might be you might get 
the last lap in the end of the rest of us  
yesterday I had ice in my drink but I was fine 
yeah well there you go some anecdotal all right
I like the big shots me too chunks of 
the dragon fruit really come through  
it looks like you get she put chunks yeah yeah she  
got those big chunks then the juice of 
course you want another round Bud yeah
yeah that is uh that's something 
that's just that kind of hits the spot  
I think it's exact for us to not go for any 
of the soup um although I think he would have  
liked it so he's kind of a picky guy sometimes 
so getting this will uh we'll help uh help kind  
of boost his energy levels I can see you strong 
yeah he's sucking up the bits so quite delicious  
we'll knock this off 25 pesos it's a good deal 
when you're walking this Mega strip of chiapo  
you're always gonna see these guys this is the 
chicken ball fish ball mix right there yeah yeah  
we get in on that thank you sir yeah so chicken or 
fish chicken chicken ball okay okay I have a cup

you want I think for how many pieces come  
in a cup four seven pieces seven pieces per 
cup yeah okay Cedar which ones do you want

these like hot dog pieces

purple sticky rice or it could never go wrong with 
sticky rice as we learned when we were in Thailand  
I got a double on that one and then now 
this one's the one I'm really curious  
to kind of your reaction what you think 
that is is it the same as this one just  
totally it's a different topping I
