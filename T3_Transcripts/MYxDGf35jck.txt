We have to be a little bit careful of pickpockets.  
We are talking about balut, right? Yes. Hey 
champs! What's happening? Welcome to another  
episode of; Tag Along With Chai. We are at 
Carbon market in the heart of Cebu island.  
We are in the Philippines for this episode. 
A more local market than this we cannot find  
on the island. You can get anything on this 
market. But mainly we are visiting the food  
section. The fruit and vegetable section. Actually 
all over the country, all over the Philippines,  
vegetables get collected and get sent here. This 
is also where the supermarkets get their fruits  
and vegetables. They're buying it wholesale over 
here. We know Ilona already. She's my girlfriend  
but, we have Sophia today. She's a local lady 
and she's gonna help us walk around. So hopefully  
I can give you a local experience. A local 
Filipino experience. We've got Ilona and Sophia!
Where are you taking us now Sophia? I'm 
taking you to the famous street food in Cebu.  
Here are the shells. Are we going to have 
some? How much will we one? Five pesos each.  
Get some! Do you want some as well? Do 
you want to try it? Let's just try one.
Take a bite. Cheers. Cheers. 
In once? No, I do it once.
Do you like it? It's not bad.
I have been missing a little 
bit of the spicy bite.  
But there's actually a lot of spiciness in here. A 
lot of chili in the sauce. Chili, onion, vinegar,  
and that's it. The hair of the duck, the bones 
of the duck. Would you call that... The beak.
We are talking about,m right? Yes. 
Okay and this is balot? Yes. Okay.  
We're gonna eat balut. Balut is an 
embryo egg from a duck. This is the 16,  
the smallest one. And this is the 18. Where 
you almost can see... This is 16 days?  
And 18 days. Okay. Do you see that? This is where 
you smash the egg. You put it in the light so,  
you will see this one here. It's shallow. It 
is shallow. Yeah. And then? On the edge. Okay.
It's your choice if you want to put this. 
How do you eat it? I do you actually like  
it? Or do you do it for the camera? No, I 
like it. Okay, I'll give it to her. Okay.
A little bit of this. And salt.
Cheers! Do I drink the whole thing? Just the soup.
Can give us a close-up? This is 
definitely something else. I've  
never done this. Don't eat the white one. Don't 
eat the white one? Why not? Because it's hard.  
Why? Is it because it's already 
developed? So, this I cannot eat? Yes.
Then after that put some sauce.
That's okay. Wow! We had to try it. 
Balut. Duck egg. Embryo duck egg.
Let's get some more delicious 
food. I'm still chewing it.  
let's get some more delicious 
Filipino food. Let's crack on!
One more thing buko juice. It's 
coconut water, with milk. Cow milk.
Are you from here Sophia? Are you from 
the island? Yeah, I'm from the island.  
I'm from the province. Here it's the city. So, why 
are you living in the city? Because my school is  
right there. USGR. Your school is there! Are 
you still studying? Yes. What do you study?  
Mass communication. Mass communication, 
journalist. Okay. We're doing a report  
on the Carbon market, with future journalists 
here. Nice one! You know we'll see me and CNN  
one day. Hopefully! Hopefully! I think you 
got it. I'm investing. Hey thank you for  
taking us here. It's already... So far a nice 
little... It's an honor to be with a vlogger.  
Well, it's great to have you. It's great also 
to have a local lady to help us show around.  
Because Ilona and I, we're here together on 
the island. With the channel and we have no  
clue what we're doing. We're really glad to have 
you. Where are we going now? We're going to a  
place where there is also a lot of food. Good 
stuff. It's called; Carbon Market. Carbon market!  
The same as here? Carbon Food Park. I 
guess officially it is one market, But  
seriously this is a whole neighborhood. Hello, how 
are you? So everyone is talking. Hello buddies.
Our friend, our local guide. She was making us 
aware that we have to be a little bit careful of  
pickpockets. And this could be also maybe a thing 
over here. I'm not too sure. But better be safe  
than sorry, when you're here. There's 
some live music going on here.  
What an evening! What an 
evening! We just started champs!
Let's come to the Philippines!
What do we get?
No thank you,
They fried intestines over here. It is tasty 
but, it's not really my cup of tea. But it's  
definitely eatable. I'm sure the sauces are very 
flavorful. But we're gonna skip the intestines.  
Not today. It's a sweet dessert. It's a rice cake.
Now, this is my cup of tea. I'm 
not a sweet tooth myself. But,  
it's not bad. She's like; where is this going?
Come on.
Let's go!
I don't want to compare any countries with 
each other. But it's kind of like... You  
know I'm used to Thailand so 
much and the Filipinos are...  
More outgoing I think. They're whaah! And 
wanna go on camera. They're really happy that  
the tourists are here back again. That's 
what I feel anyway. Why it's called dynamite?  
Because it's spicy. Is there a chilly inside? 
Okay. Ilona and I, we really do love spicy food.  
Dynamite! We dip it into; Soy 
sauce, vinegar and some shallots.
It's there cheese inside? Mate!
This is really flavourful. Really tasty!
We're  
still going to be in the Philippines for several 
weeks to explore more of this beautiful country.  
So far so good. I hope you're able to join this 
trip and subscribe to the channel. We are based  
in the north of Thailand but we're exploring 
parts of southeast Asia and now we are in the  
Philippines for several weeks. If you enjoyed
