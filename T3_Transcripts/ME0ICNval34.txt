 Welcome everybody. Today we're going to a Filipino buffet here in Dubai. Gonna try some Filipino food. We've never had any non-jolomy food before. So this should be pretty interesting and we can get a lot of like classic food. Hopefully everyone's been asking for it and today is finally happening. Not in the Philippines yet. We're like halfway there. Yeah, basically. There's a lot of Filipino here. So let's see where we can get. And let's go. Hopefully it's good. The sun is setting in Dubai. It's a very, very nice temperature out like perfect. It's amazing. For me this is the ideal temperature. I get to walk 50 miles in this temperature. And what did he as well? Yes, without water. Wow, you look like a superhero. That's how superhero's are. It is. Let's see if we can find this place. Ducky isn't with us. Should be right over here. Okay. I'd better be here. I'd better be. We waited three hours. Yeah, we literally waited three hours for that. Come on. If the fistful is open or doesn't exist, we could have been eating at the hot buffet. Please be here. This video is a mess. We're going to get a car for. Just had to get a car for. Can we go to Filipino buffet? It's fully booked. Join us tomorrow. See food buffet. Hopefully that means it's the same things. Hopefully you just have some seafood. Hopefully who knows. Yikes. Another day in Dubai. Another attempt at a Filipino buffet. I'm not sure what the reservation is this time. There's no way it doesn't work. Sorry. You didn't put a number. So it's not going to work. Oh, true. Yeah. You don't have a free blindfold. Let's see what this is like. Apparently it's a special day. On Monday's they have seafood. So Filipino seafood. Should be interesting. Let's see what it is. Yesterday failed vlog. I'm going to go do it. We didn't go. Then we got hot pot, which was delicious. And we didn't know how to hot pot. We didn't know how to hot pot at all. It was a disaster. So today, let's see how it goes. At the Filipino buffet. Two days, two buffets. Oh, yeah. That's a lot of food. Oh, my Martha. This is really packed right now. I thought Monday would be chill or maybe it's a rush. Yeah, we're five, six or five maybe. A jianna hotel. The food's in the name. We got a little bit lost since we were finding this place. But we know it now. In here, there's a bunch of Asian restaurants in near it's really interesting. We'll go to the Beijing. There is... Nice. Okay. I don't know if there's just a minute. It's finally here. C-sig at work, which I didn't know you could get here. And then I call people express. I don't know if they express part of me. But as I said, first time ever getting to see C-sig, they should be interesting. I'm going to try it straight up first. I'll just go right through there. It's going very parking. Torque. Whoa. It's so hot. Really. Like when we were scooping it out, it kind of felt like it was. Very, very soft. But wow, it was really soft. Just like everything is soft, but these little chunks right here. I don't know if I should share what this is. The skin. I don't know like even skin before the lemon chicken. Let's try this one right? Some good flavor. I mean, it's a really fatty flavor. You get the good pork fat in there. I'm assuming the hard bits are the same. It's kind of a bit crunchy. Yeah, very crunchy. Whoa. Very crunchy. Yeah, I can hear that. It's good. Really the flavor. Very unique texture for my palate. I think it's going to try it now. They're the same thing. The straight up and then the racer. Ooh. The texture is interesting. They're very effective. And then the sauce is super like sticky. Yeah. And then you have the meat soup, it's a lot of fatty. Really interesting. Better with the rice. Definitely. And even more to the texture. You're flipping, I'll say. Mmm. Okay. That looks great. It's trying this. This looks a little more familiar. Like kind of something, but it's pork, I guess. I've never had a pork dish like this. Seems to be very tender. Yeah. The camera positive before it took a bite, unfortunately. So I'm just talking about how it's very spongy, very fatty. Very tasty. Some rice for you. Rice, rice, rice. Get, get, get. Look. I can really taste so much more like compared to this. Or it's more expensive. I've never seen like other than like stuffing channels. Like that? Without the meat? Yeah. But this looks more much more like Indonesian dish you would get. Like a Chinese dish or something. Pretty tender, I actually. That kind of flimsyle part. It's really quickly. Mmm. That's really good. I don't know what this flavor of the sauce is. Yeah, I don't know either. It's like a very middle of the road flavor. It's not sweet. It's not spicy. It's not very salty. It's just like very middle of the road. It's very, very good. Whoa. Oh. I don't remember the name before, but I don't remember it looking like this. I don't know either. There's stuff here. We got whatever the leaves. Could be crispy pasta. And then, from the Chow. The Chow looks different than in the videos. That was super tender beef. The Chow is usually like golden brown in the videos. Yeah, there's something like black on the inside. And what's it this is? The Chow. It kind of looks more like it. I mean, this is definitely crispy too. Yeah. It's golden brown on the inside. It's got to be it. It's golden brown. I can't tell if they talk about it. We smell them through the videos. Yeah. True. I'm going to try a little piece of this and then I got soy sauce vinegar. Oh, yeah. As well. I'm trying to not have this. Oh, come on. Your facial expression. Is it like a chip? It's so crispy. I mean, we've never even had like, poor skin before. It tastes so good though. Is it like, I kind of imagine it like a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of salty experience. I can imagine it like a ... I mean, Porc is good and then it's roasted porc. It's great. You can see it's beautiful on the outside. Some sort of liquids. What did they stuff in this one? Can you tell? Oh no. I don't know if it wasn't Schwap or Schwap or Schwap. This one looks like pot roast kind of So, there's a pizza here with pineapple on it. Mmm. There's a little pigger. A little bit of a regular. I gotta get the complete flavor. Get off of there. CC button. Wow, that is joffin. That's on there. What the? Yeah, that's what mine did too. I tried to flick it off and it just stuck to it. What the heck? Whoa, look at that. It's definitely what it did in the videos too. It came right off the skin. Or the skin came right on it. A lot of the videos they got like right out of the oven. The cards are probably gonna sit a little bit. This is to book that. Oh, the bed is harder than quite a bit for me. Oh, look. Oh, baby. That's super good. It's like, here's a nice lady. This is exactly like, I'm gonna have a skin part. I can just choose for my talk, I'm sorry. I'm gonna have for it. Ta-da, ta-da, ta-da, ta-da, ta-da, ta-da, ta-da, ta-da, ta-da. Tasting that, I haven't had skin before. Fried skin in the game mark. I got a pork chop. And along the side of the pork chop was the fried skin. It tastes exactly like that. So, it was really good. Very, very good. That might be my favorite so far. How's very good. It was very tasty. The juice. My piece had some juice. It was super good. It was a little juicer. So then, guys, we're really sorry that Dr. can come with us too. It'll be really disappointed. He's currently, I think I chopped him across the room before we left. What the? But, so then, crispy pata here. What is pata? Oh, I've heard it. I've definitely heard it. It looks like more like beef. It doesn't look like that. No. It looks like pot roast, but they kept the skin on the pot roast. And it's crispy. Anyway, I'm trying it here. Oh. It's much softer than I thought. Okay. Definitely be good with the sauce. It's sort of dipping sauce. You can just say something. But by the way, it's pretty soft. It's good. Yeah, it's good. It wasn't as crunchy as I thought it was. But, it looks black. Yeah. It's mostly like that. I don't know. But, it is. It's pretty solid. Me want to try. Okay. Oh, but it's not that meat. Sorry, I want my meat. I like meat. I like to eat meat straight up. So, we're out. Go for a crispy pata on the outside. Here we go. It's a lot of chewing involved. Yeah. Really good. It tastes like a pot roast. It's like a pot roast. It's like what I look like. But, it has that, um, the skin on the crispy skin. So, it gives it that extra light. It's a bit flavor, I guess. The hard part and the crispy meat on the outside. It just gives it another extra flavor. I really like that. Really good. Other very interesting things we've tried. We have more comments about some desserts. Yes, we have some desserts we'll see. I'm not sure if there's any more like main course type things left. But, we will look. You know what there's not? I'll put it in. This is the original one. Rice. Rice. How's the rice taste, then? It tastes like the ocean. Oh. The palo-mai. The palo-mai is the ocean. Oh my gosh. Is this Filipino? I don't even know, dude. S-s-s-s-o-mai. S-i-o-m-a-i. I don't know what it would recommend. It's so interesting that it's have Alfredo over there. Yeah, it's a Filipino. I smell nice. Oh. It can't help with me. It's so tough. I don't have a lot of flavors. Oh. They are some gnarly looking dumplings. That's a real cool guy. It's like they tried to do the dumplings like cold and they're just like, eh, whatever. That would be good to do these things with the sauce. Really? Sorry for the terrible white setup for this. Oh. It's a little fishy. Okay. I don't want to guess. I like it. It's chicken and shrimp. Yeah, we're good dumplings. We would definitely be good to dip it in some like, don't be sour. Don't be sour as the original. The one we had in the Chinese restaurant would be great with that. That was really good. I think I'm out there with this chicken and shrimp. I think I actually guess. That's what I guess. Ah. I think that's good. It's surprising how well those blended together are chicken and shrimp. I'm going to try it in this vinegar. It's vinegar soy sauce mix. So is it going to be like salty, vinegar? Well, flip-flavored. I haven't tried it yet. I'm not a huge vinegar person, but let's see. It's strong. That one really gets a different flavor. That one worked. There really wasn't this powerful taste, or it was a smell of a smell of a chicken. The dessert section. They had a bunch of assorted cakes. A bink bing и peak bing. I don't know if you're gonna tell you. Well, let's try that one first. I recognize that one the most. It's got a little... oh, what the heck is this? Oh, it's a Nutri-Latinus can. This is so interesting. We've noticed in a lot of drinks from Southeast Asia, they have a lot of these gelatinous pieces. And you can just drink. But now it's part of the soupy dessert. Oh! It's so good. Wow. This is so interesting. It's like eating jello. Oh, it's like a little bit of like coconut milk. Coconut milk? Where is it? How coconut is it? I think it's just these pieces and I have any. That's super coconut milk. It's literally one of the like three words was coconut. Yes, I will try it now. Not a big kind of vinegar, but I put it in a bowl. Not a big kind of vinegar, but I put it in with that. I know they kind of focus on it either. But I think it's kind of opening up to it a little bit more. It smells very coconut milk. It's so weird. I had to analyze the flavor for like five bites. I need you to give just some of the milk. Can we see that? That curry. Is this a lot of green cows? I think so. Oh, green cows. I mean, where else do they get chocolate milk too? White cow. Sweetness on this is so good. It's like, it's literally to me. It's like melted yogurt. They're not melted yogurt. Melted ice cream with jello in it. I'm trying to put an exact flavor on it. I know, and that's what I was trying to do. It's so hot. This is super tasty. It is. It's very addictive. I've had a very sugary and I can eat a lot of them. What is this, dude? What is this? Green cows. Green cows. Are those alien cows? The pink cow. The pink cow. The pink cow. The pink cow. It's super gelatinous. It's so sticky. I was holding my thing that I grabbed it with over my plate for like a minute. And I just used my finger. So, gelatinous. Oh, you went Filipino mode with the fork and the spoon. I've never had a rice cake. So, this is totally... It's definitely gelatinous. I can hear the gelatinous in this. It's a very bland flavor. It's a lot. I think the inside is pretty bland. The right part? Outside, I can just like a cakey flavor. I wonder if it's supposed to go with anything like ice cream maybe. I don't like it. Well, bland foods. It's not always bad thing. No, I kind of like bland flavors. Things like this sometimes. I'll just eat bread straight up. Yeah, he likes bread. There's a cutchupuri bread in Georgia. And he bought it. Just ate just the bread. And it's kind of taste like bread. You don't wear it. But two lottings, probably. So, I like it. He gives some extra texture to it. Yeah, we have to chew it. It's like gum. Friendly gum. Carey's what you think of this. It's very gelatinous. It's satisfying though. I can just goop it around. I'm chewing it right now. Yeah, I'll play you though. Not like a ton of flavor. But it doesn't need it. I love the top. The flavor of the top. But the gelatinousness. That's so interesting. That was good. I like these. These are good desserts. We haven't even had a hollow hollow. We haven't. D mix mix. Come on. Chocolate. Chocolate. Okay. Very chocolate-like. Red velvet. You have to say it red velvet. I'm going to eat it. We want more food. Oh, that's really good. Mango. Probably mango. There's so many flavors from over here. Not mango. Very fruity. Raspberry with the raspberry. Raspberry with the raspberry. Raspberry. Very raspberry. I love raspberry. Chocolate. Coffee. Not chocolate. Was it coffee? That just goes to show you my coffee or my... my COVID nose. I cannot tell the difference between coffee and chocolate. Yeah. And that was that strong, dude. Yeah, that was pretty strong. That's crazy. That I can't tell the difference between coffee and chocolate. That's soft. That was not as good as yours. I guess maybe it's good for me because I didn't mind. I don't know that. Good flavor. Sorry. Do I eat? Sack the... Oh. It's chocolate. Not really. I only got the fruityness, whatever fruity it was. It's probably mango. Mango. It's been around for a couple of years. There were four cakes on the other side. You know that these are Filipino or not, but they're cookies. I like cookies. Sugar for me. I think. I like it. I like it. Mmm. It's like the baby and the ground. It's like a chip. Yeah. I think so. Mmm. That was good. This one is badgy though. Sugar cookie. That was pretty tasty. I think it's... I think it's a danian. Maybe some... I think this is pistachio. I think this is pistachio. Well, that's a very soft cream. Oh, it's green. Oh, it really tastes like... Okay. Really? Let me try giving this cream a little bit. How? It doesn't have much flavor. Same order. Okay. If you were talking to nice good sugar, maybe... It breaks apart and gets well without it's dangerous. These surprisingly take a long time to chew. I think you know that makes me very thirsty. That one's pretty pop. I love oatmeal cookies. Mmm, it's healthier. It can drink. Yes. Mmm. Mmm. Ooh. That was a good actually. It's so strong. I want more of this, but I'm so full. I'm very full too. All right. Now that my lips are covered in vinegar. Perfect time. Pop it. I want to steal like a ton of those before. Really? Yeah, I'm going too. Oh. I got like an aroma in my mouth when I first entered. And I just did the weird. It's yeah, I'm just going to turn it to a more. It actually gave me like a hint of mint pop. I thought I got something that wasn't stashy, but it didn't last long enough where it was noticeable. No, it's not mint. It's maybe coconut. Coconut? I don't know why it would be green. Yeah. Green coconut? Mmm. Yeah, when they're not ripe. Yeah? I don't know anything about coconut. No, we live nowhere near coconut. We know about pine cones. Oh. You can eat those though. You can put them in your house and they make your house smell good. The... Yeah. When they're the horsefire, they open up and plant more trees. They live around. And you can use them instead of the hobbit. For use as pine cones, there's like molotov cocktails. I think so. You can do that. The guy who rides in his bunnies. Yeah. And that was our Filipino buffet experience. It was good that there wasn't more options, honestly, because then we'd be going all out. Yeah, but if there was more options, it would have been too much. Yeah, I'm kind of glad there wasn't a dobo here. I feel like we're going to go do a restaurant for that. Yeah, definitely. But I'm sure some of these sins it was a buffet. Even though it's an highly rated buffet and it was good stuff. I'm sure we can get lechone that is fresher, like right out of the oven instead of the oven. Yeah. I mean, I want to sit in that of a buffet. A lot of these are with like salt when they got there. Yeah, very warm. So, you know, there's always difference. She's saying might not be as joet and as if it doesn't sit in a tub. Who knows. We can only see when we go to the Philippines. We can hopefully be there sometime soon. Tomorrow. Okay.
