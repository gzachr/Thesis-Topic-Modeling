okay thank you very much all right I am in 
siargao one of the most beautiful islands here  
in the Philippines and the landing here was quite 
epic I've never seen so many coconut trees on an  
island before it looked like we are arriving 
in the middle of the Jungle you can't really  
see it from here but all around it's only coconut 
trees so I am very excited to explore this island  
going to stay here for around two weeks happy 
to explore around feel free to join me today  
all right I think this is a typical 
Island airport very small only this  
tiny building here I think only 
one belt for the next all right
and as you can maybe see there's almost no 
local in here only foreigners so this is a  
touristic Island for foreigners usually I'm not a  
big fan of these places you know that 
if you follow my channel for a while  
but now this place is so beautiful yeah you 
have to share with other tourists of course
okay thank you so much all right you have to 
pay an entry environmental fee of 20 pesos here  
but that's okay well I'm so happy to be here 
ah this is one of the places in the Philippines  
I was looking forward to the most to explore 
siargao Island let's see yeah the main village  
is about 45 minutes to uh like one hour away 
from here like the main tourist Village it's  
on the other side of the island so uh we have to 
get there somehow let's see what are the options  
I think we can take a minivan or a tricycle I 
would prefer a tricycle to be honest more fun

yeah it was around let me check the 
watch yeah like 40 45 minutes now  
getting some first impressions of the island 
seems to be a very beautiful place I'm very  
excited to explore here around the next days but 
yeah now let me find the reception and check in
there
[Music] do we have Wi-Fi here
not in the room yeah over there it's only for the 
lodging area okay is it is a good Wi-Fi or like a  
island good yeah okay okay okay thank you okay 
thank you very much thank you thank you okay so  
this is going to be my first hotel I'm going to 
change photos actually quite a lot in the next  
week um because there are a few really nice hotels 
here and but for the first three days I'm going to  
stay on this uh Hotel here a bed a desk yeah the 
hotels because this island is not uh how do you  
say that like there are no big chain hotels here 
yet it's a little bit still I don't really want to  
call it the Hidden Gem because obviously it's very 
touristic you saw the amount of westerners at the  
airport and but it's here it's not like like Bali 
for example um so it's still a little bit less not  
really less hotels but like less big hotels Big 
Chain hotels are not here so you have to or you  
have mainly like small little guest houses like 
this so this hotel here I think only has like a  
handful of rooms two and I think five or six more 
over there we even have a little pool area there  
and you already heard the first big problem 
that I am going to have on this island the Wi-Fi  
situation like she said no Wi-Fi in the room and 
I did some research about this island before and  
everywhere I read or I saw another YouTube videos 
the Wi-Fi on the island is horrible and as someone  
who needs to upload videos that is of course not 
good news so excuse me in the next days maybe I  
will miss an upload day then it's due to the lack 
of rifle here let's check out the bathroom quick  
yeah basic nothing special but uh that will do the 
job what do I pay here I am I'm actually not sure  
let me check real quick because it's an island 
uh the prices are a little bit more expensive  
okay so per night it is 2600 here so this is 
what 2 600 pesos uh gets you on xiargao Island
okay let's have a first quick walk 
around I need to find an ATM because  
I literally have zero cash on me 
anymore and maybe we can also have  
a first view on the ocean I think I 
see the ocean at the end over there
um oh okay there's an ATM right here 
so I can get cash here that's good  
we'll get it when I come back ah thank you 
ah okay let's uh have a quick look at the  
ocean yeah unfortunately the weather isn't 
the best today so I guess this place will  
look way more beautiful when we have Sunshine 
but yeah I'm going to stay here I think for  
10 to 14 days probably so I'm sure there will 
be a few uh sunny and beautiful days and yeah  
if you have been to this place before or if you 
know this area you know this island feel free to  
once again let me know all the recommendations 
you have in the comment section always happy  
to get recommendations from you guys if there's 
anything that you would specifically like to see  
hello I'm not sure if this is going 
to be an official rate to the beach  
also yes some places look like a rundown I saw 
that also on the way to get here I think it's a  
combination of yeah there was a big typhoon here 
almost a year ago and coffee it of course for two  
years so I can imagine that this island uh hasn't 
seen many tourists in the past two years but I am  
happy to be here now and check this out we have 
clear water here we have a little palm tree here
hello oh some dogs here
hello
check this place out ah this looks 
like like an Instagram picture right  
crystal clear water here the trees hanging over 
the water oh wow what a beautiful place oh and  
it is even beautiful without Sunshine imagine this 
place with sunshine wow awesome happy to be here  
oh nice water here so I think all 
around the the coastline that you  
can see here that is basically the the 
main village which is called General Luna  
um which has the The Hot Spot of this 
island oh this looks epic here oh wow
I really like how calm and peaceful it is here
there's nobody here you'll hear only the water the 
waves in the background it is a beautiful beach  
is it possible to make boat 
rides here What boat rides  
like a boat hopped island hopping island hopping 
something I just arrived here I have no idea yet  
because you go to in um again over there but 
we'll go in town in prison ah okay not not here
not every day because my 
friends is with they're in the  
in tourism I need to to go to the tourist 
information or something the market anyway if  
you wanna see the previous episode where I checked 
out an airport hotel in Cebu at the Cebu airport  
and check out the video right here and yeah with 
this amazing view here I'm going to end the video  
right here so hopefully stay positive and then
