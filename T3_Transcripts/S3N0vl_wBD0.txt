yes i'm very excited because today i will be 
cooking three filipinos dishes for my parents  
so i will start with achara
now it's starting to become nice weather 
again so it's nice to cook again in the garden
so i'm grating this green papaya before i 
continue i will take out the seeds because  
i almost forgot to take out the seeds 
so let's cut the papaya in half first
there we go
now that is much easier
i think that should be all right so i will 
be adding salt to this as i've seen on some  
recipes you need to put quite a bit of salt right 
just like that and then i'll cover it with water
so again let me know how i'm doing because 
it's the first time for me to make achara  
i'm gonna leave this for about 30 minutes next 
is luya, luya is really one of my favorites
so today i'm making uh mostly vegetable-based 
dishes so again i'm cooking 3 filipino  
foods for my parents including one 
vegetable-based dessert so i'm very  
excited about that especially the 
dessert so next is some red onion sibuyas
a little bit of red sili
these are not so spicy just medium
and finally carrots you didn't think 
i was going to use carrots right  
i think it's uh one of the important ingredients 
for atsara diba so let's set aside the carrots and  
the ginger and the sili and the sibuyas so next i 
will be adding about two cups of sugar to this wok
one let's go for one and a 
half because i don't want it to  
to be too sweet then i'll be 
adding about two cups of water
and two cups of vinegar i'm curious 
which kind of vinegar you would use  
in the philippines is it just plain 
white or are you using any other type  
now just bring this to a soft boil so i'm 
dissolving the sugar and the water and the  
vinegar and then in the meantime i will 
take the papaya and squeeze out the water
and set it aside okay it's about starting to uh 
to boil the water so i'm adding the vegetables
the green papaya as well
looks sarap!
and finally some black pepper i'm gonna 
leave this for about five minutes okay then  
drain a little bit of the water let it cool off 
put it in the fridge and then see what my parents  
reaction will be it's a filipino dish called 
achara it's with ginger ginger and green papaya a
yeah a little bit spicy there's pepper yeah 
there's chili peppers and also black pepper so  
that was achara and now i'm gonna make the second 
dish um in the meantime i'm gonna boil some ube  
because we need those for the dessert 
later on can you guess what the second  
dish will be so i'm adding a little bit of 
water konting tubig some fresh pork meat
now it's not the first time that i'm making 
this dish i did it once before yes this is  
i made the first trial video you 
can see the link in the description  
and you can also see which kind of pumpkin 
i'm using and look who's there Pogi!
so the pork has been boiling for about 20 minutes 
it's getting dry as you can see adding mantica
to make the pork really nice and 
crispy so we'll be adding the onions
and the bawang
and then the coconut milk
i will add one extra can of coconut milk it 
might not be enough but it smells amazing  
we'll just cover this in the meantime let me take 
out those uber which have been boiling for a bit  
so let me try to remove the skin of the ube
in the meantime i see that 
the pumpkin is getting softer  
so what i will do with the 
ginataang calabasa i'll add sitaw
some patis
asin
finally a bit of green chili so then i'll 
cover it for a bit and then i think we're done
