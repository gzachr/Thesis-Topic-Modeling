 We're across the street from the Auro, Auro Mall in BGC and we're heading to the Christmas Grand Parade which is by the Venice Grand Canal Mall. We don't know exactly what's going on, there's very little information about it, we've just seen a few stuff on Facebook and the mega-warro website. Let's hope things go well. We've had a bad history with Parade and the Philippines, no offense, in a log. We just went here for the intersection apparently, we're still like 28 minute walk away which we could probably cut down to like 20-ish because we walked pretty fast. Or 15 if we were on. We're going to walk through this mall, take a shortcut right next to it and then hopefully we'll get there and hopefully it's still going on. You guys are said 5 to 8 but it's a parade and parades don't usually last three hours right. We'll see if we get there. We just know it starts by the Venice Grand Canal Mall. Well you could say it's lit in here. It's got this like Aura to it that's like kind of... I'm just so funny I can even business it. It's really busy in here. It is. It's not as wide as that's in North. So really just everybody just gets coranded in. So alright actually. Aura. Not only it's just the lights but I mean it's white in the inside. It has an aura too. It does. It's just a beautiful, beautiful aura. Aura. I'm just going to keep saying aura. Aura. Aura. Aura. It's like an australian. It's an aura. I like that shirt. Buffet better than that. That's pretty fresh in there. That's awesome. I mean we've been like six buffets. Oh oh. I've had our alley video recently. Let's make a vlog title guys. The side of Manila. The western media won't show you. This is what they show you. Oh wait I don't even know what it is now anymore. Because like the modern areas people would be like oh they don't show this side of the Philippines. But then also when you talk about this type of area over here they're like oh they don't show you this side. Yeah that's true that so many vloggers recently that have done the like the Tondo thing. Like the area vloggers don't go. Yeah anyways I don't know. At least in the vloggers that really try to hype up the Philippines constantly. Hey. How's it going? Hey. Hey. How's it going? Hey. Hey. How's it going? Hi how are you doing? Ah. Oioice! Hey.What's going on? What? What does that mean? I used to. I used to. I would have heard my knee. Very high this day. Yes we will vlog it. Yes we will do this. Did you hurt your arm? Oh no, from basketball? Yeah! I'm so by the blue. Why, nice to see you guys! Bye! That is kind of the Philippines is anywhere we've got in the chill zone. They'll show it everywhere. But vloggers now they'll say, goodbye! Long story short, this is right next to this. Both sides of the Philippines. Some people will try to pretend this part doesn't exist. Some people will try to pretend this part doesn't exist. But you know what, every country has its sides. The two sides. Oh, there's a dance class going on down there. Holy nuts! This is a cool little neighborhood here. Yeah, it is. The way it kind of fits into them. The like hilly part here is cool. It's kind of like a favela. Yeah, we get that. They're doing a Zumba class. If we could get a basketball up here, if we could make it in the hoop from here. I bet not. We could have a few cords and destroy the power. They spot us from up here. We could have taken the path through there. That would have been really cool. Oh, by the way. Those kids we met were very nice. But gang signs? I don't know about gang signs kids. And they definitely said something to us that made the older girls laugh the younger kids. So it must have been something offensive. So in any way, what we just showed is, no matter what side of the Philippines you're on, the people are friendly. We go into the fancy areas like the mall. People are nice to talk into us. We look down into the less fortunate areas. And people are smiling, waving, happy. It's very cool. I am starting to doubt our ability to get to this parade. Yeah. I wasn't like, chase it down. We might have to go. Bye-bye! We're running into a lot of children. This is going to slow our process. Hello! Hi! What's up, man? Oh, no! Oh, no, no, no! Try it, Z. Good bye! Interesting, the first instinct of the children is to throw the gang signs. I fear for the youth of this country. I'm just kidding. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I don't even hear a parade. Look at it. It's that McKinley hill right there. We want to hear it. The parade's all about the drums. What about the drums? Orders big balloons. We'd see a balloon. Is this real? Yeah, it's like a 25-bit tall. Yeah, we're getting somewhere. Is this Korea or the Philippines? Wow. I don't know. This kind of reminds me of a sidewalk. We're walking around in Korea. If you don't look at the tropical trees, especially don't look at the entire left side of the street. Yeah, that's... Yeah, just look to a kind of down like this. Oh! Oh! Oh! Sorry, we're distracted by the lights. Oh! Oh! Oh, my. I think this is just for on. We're walking really fast. We can catch up to this thing. And I'm getting tired now. This is an exercise for the day. That's hot outside, guys. Is there weather here? Will was not lying. Oh, that's hot. Up by a high street. It was really windy and now it's just still air. With a lot of exhaust added in. We're almost fracking there, baby. Wow, look at how festive the village is. That's fracking up. Real Gs, we jump over this. And stay on our straight path. There's swings right here. I don't care about the parade anymore. This is epic. They're kind of low. They're not very easy to sit on. Really? And there's just a piece of metal back here. You're not supposed to actually swing on them. That's kind of wack. McKinley's trying to be cool. I mean, like, guys, we have swings and adventures. And then they don't even let you swing on the swing. McKinley. I know you're trying to be cool. But you'll never be the best, the best make out there. McK Donald is always there. What about Mick Cormick's? The spice company. Yeah. Or Mick Jagger? Yeah. Or Mick Muffin? Do you know the Muffin Man? The Muffin Man? The Muffin Man! I don't know if we have enough money to live here. It's an interesting area. We've been to the Venice Grand Canal, but we usually tax the out of there because it's so dang far. This seems to be the McKinley area, which is basically, I'm pretty sure, like, a mega world. Like, a massive mega world project. So they just own all of this stuff. So in one sense, it's not always great. It's like one company owned everything in an area. But it does create, or like, a cool environment. Like, they get into events in here. They get to decorate everything. You don't have to, like, bring together a community of people to do it. The company will just do it. They've niche. Oh, it's planning to be back, actually. Give it the planet of the vapes. Planet of the vapes. Let's make it a move soon. We'll make it on our channel. We need to crowdfunding, though. Let us know how many episodes you want down on our GoFundMe below. Well, the main monkey name being... He could be Julia Caesar. Julia! I'm pretty funny, I don't know. If you wanted to be funny, you're actually going to explain the joke, too. So, Julia, what do you think? Wow, we are just going through all of these restaurants. And they're all empty. Yeah, I was just about to say that. What a weird area. Really weird. We do know the parade is going on because they're sign-saying that there's traffic advisory. We seem to find it now. Have you ever heard of a game called, Heiden Go Seek the Parade? No, I haven't, actually. We're going there right now. Can you explain the rules on kind of confused? Eh. The parade is hiding in point sight and it's our job to find it before it ends. Oh! So it's like Heiden Go Seek, but with a parade. Heiden Go Seek the Parade. It makes sense now. I didn't get it when you first said it, but now I understand. Let's go and seek a parade, baby. Oh, we got a big group of people waiting up here. Something's going on. Something's going on. What are we waiting for? What are you waiting for? Wow, are we in Italy or the Philippines? Ciao. Is this the parade? These cars driving by? Just like in BGC, it's just a Toyota and Lexus advertisement. Oh, I hear some stuff up ahead. Oh, you remember Synologue? For the first three hours of Synologue, it was just a challenge. It was just a challenge. It was just a challenge. Well, it's just a challenge. Well, it's just a challenge. Well, it's just a challenge. Well, it's just a challenge. We might have a second to wait. It's almost here. The parade has been spotted. Look at that. That's actually a deeply big photo. Yeah. Oh, we're so fracking thirsty. We just watched like 30 fracking minutes. Wow, look at this. They got this thing. Christmas-ified. Yeah, this is really cool. Wow. That's cool. And it's all jazzed up like that. Where is it? Like a 7-11. We'll get out there in the parade. It'll be pasta. What thought? I just started doing it. The end of that water. They have lemonade. I don't want it for 30 minutes. And you have to get some s'mores nuggets. Or a one liter lemonade. Lemonade? That's good. Old-fashioned lemonade. They called it. It's good. Very good. I got ice-cheese lemonade mix. Very delicious. We didn't get any fracking pretzels. We were a little nervous because everyone we asked about or told about this place that we saw on the way here was like, oh, really? Like, there's no idea what it was about. And we can barely find anything online. There's a ton of people here. This is absolutely packed. Mostly children. This seems to be the end of the parade right here where we walked into. So I think we could hear from the guard. The guard that was not speaking English, so we just did our best with hand gestures and such. So we were going to try to go meet it and walk up the street. Oh, it's a fish. That's it. Oh, that's so loud. Every girl in the town is loud. That was so loud. Everyone was just standing there. Like, it was nothing. I don't know. I can't function right now. What the? We've actually made it to what we've been trying to get to this whole dang time. We finally, finally made it. Bye-bye. Go! I want more fried chicken. Yeah. That's where I can tie the start of the parade. We just kind of walk down and get in somewhere. Let's go. Oh my gosh. There's a gesture. A gesture you say. Huh. Why aren't they trombone? Yeah, what the heck. Looks like my family's sweaty outfit. Oh, there we go. Ah! They really get the upping clothes shots. The WOLA shot the shot. Yes. Our shots are weak compared to WOLA. Oh my gosh, it's Santa! Santa! Santa! This team was like, I'm not as shocked as we are about Santa. And a penguin. Oh my gosh. I don't think that's the coolest you're saying to Claus. What's Santa Claus? Huh? You know, remember? No. He's holding it together to make sure. Huh? Yeah. It's tri-fate. Tri-fate. Tri-fate. Yeah, perfect. Thank you. Oh, that is good. Those are the canal. Go, go kiss that guy. No, thank you. What do you want? Next time. I like the light up guy in the middle. It's just kind of... Oh, that one's working. What? The one's atrocity is that thing. A very giraffe-looking dragon. Is that the filipanatic? That's a terrifying bunny. Hi, is a bunny scary? This is cool so far, but it's kind of creepy. I just realized when you were filming me that this is a face right here. Oh my gosh, that is horrifying. I don't think that was there before. Holy nuts. It's Santa Claus. Look at how jolly it is. I'm a thicker Santa than that guy. We saw this on the screen. They just had like the delivery drivers kind of drive by. Half a throw in a few advertisements. Is that a new delivery service? It must be. Unicorn delivery. That's why that is a unicorn maybe. A snowman. A frosty, there's so many. You can go say hello to him. This is your chance to meet and greet. Just go push into some family and do it again. We're more important because we have a vlog camera. And look, we have microphones. We're more important than everyone else that's here. Is that a blizzard? I think we need to get a picture with the blizzard. Hi, it's everything here. It's sponsored. Frosty doesn't went right by us like a snowball going down the hill. Is that Genji? Do you know the muffin man? The muffin man? The muffin man. And now this full tourist boss is going to try to squeeze in. Are they going to go for it? There's people sitting on the side of the street over here. Whoa. Is this a came-up song? They just pull all these twists. Look at those moves. I feel the spirit already. Alright, get out there right now. Spares a more advertisement. Oh, they have a meat and dirty thing. The Grinch spider man. A army soldier, a toy soldier. Spider man. Oh my god. That's a slaggy Grinch right there. Look at him. Man, the belt. He's probably packing. The original Iron Man before he upgraded. And a rocket. Oh my gosh, and a rocket. This is epic. Still a lot's got nothing on it. No, it doesn't. Oh my gosh. Rocket. Oh my gosh, it's so raven. Oh, that is horrifying. Oh my gosh, I'm sorry. Tony Stark looks different now. Oh, the cosplay section. This is like what we get to find in Tainoma. Yeah, this is epic. Oh, am I into a pan or the philomines? The Chalking, the little area is coming through. The only reason I know one piece is pretty much from Japan. Which I've never been to, by the way. There's one piece. The kids know what they do. One piece is huge in the Philippines. They got big swords. They all have big swords when they're in animes. The panda's out of the costume. Oh my god, look at what the panda's so big. Oh no, no. This is the big event, Chalking. Wow, big. I wanted a thot-a-bot. Give a free food. This shouldn't be like a US braid where they throw candy. Chalkan out to everybody. Free shall life for everyone. To make it through hollow, hollows, everybody too. Chalking. Yeah, Chalking. Let's go. That's the grass braid. Now that was grass. I'm just glad I saw cosplay. I'm in the Christmas spirit now. Let's go to Comic Con. They got a Christmas tree right in the middle of the mall. And a polar bear. He is chilling out there on the island. When I was in Venice, I remember there being a floating tree in the middle of the canal. What about a polar bear? It was swimming in the canal. I'm very impressed by the realism of this place. Now that is epic. Yes, you can see something. The penguins are making noises. Did you hear that? Yes, I did. What the heck? They have real penguins here? This mall might be the best thing I've ever seen in my entire life. This is so epic. I can barely hear it from here. What are you doing? I was blowing off the dust and the mic. Okay, I see. Orbs, orbs. Oh, you're posing very stoically. Are we in Italy or the Philippines? Is it 12 p.m. or 12 a.m.? It literally looks like a state time in here. And then at the end of it all, Kenny Rogers roosters. Any, anything. Do they want this to be like Italy or Japan? I'm still confused. Everything. Mega World. Nothing. It's a mega world. I'm going to be in the Venice Grand Canelo mall. The Christmas decorations are beautiful. And we just watched the Christmas Grand parade. Which is... I hear some penguins still. They're still around. Besides that, what did you think of the parades, sir? The parade was pretty cool. I'm pretty sure on the website, it claimed there was going to be like 25 floats or something. And 15 balloons or something like that. And there was two. Maybe there's more that we're missing. It was done, right? It was just empty after that. There's another round to go by or something. Maybe. I'm going to be in the car. I turned over to somebody that's got a little girl. She went... Because I wasn't filming her. I don't know. I was a weird reaction. Not too shabby. Surprisingly funny at some parts. Yeah. Let's just say, the funniest thing ever, I think, was a rocket the right to. Yeah. I was like, whoa, what's that? There was a McDonald's phone randomly back here. And there's some Popeye's people. I think of it now, coupons. I don't want a pico-pon. Popeye's. Pico-pon. Yes. Thank you. Bye. I just borrowed all. Let's grab a set. Honey, do I got the deal for you? I don't think you advertised like that until it's been a... Whoa, it's the hamburger. And it's grimace. Grimace? He killed like a million children in the US with the grimace shake. Oh, grimace. Oh, yes. The handler, Giller, gave us a finger heart. So that's what we thought earlier. I don't know what idea was happening here. I don't even know what area of them all we came out. We just came out and there was just more stuff. That mean where are we? Where are there's more stuff? I am confusion. Usually for AIDS or constant. It's possible we missed stuff in the first 40 minutes, still. Well, that guy with his gimbals is going right up there. We are not. We have to be more adventurous. We don't have the vlogger confident. We saw those synagogues last year, those vloggers are like... Oh, I'm going to go up the middle. Just disrupting. Have they talked exactly like that by the way? And we noticed when people started going out to the middle of the film, they just disrupted the entire flow of the parade. It was awful. It just ruined everything. Coca-Cola. Wow, Coca-Cola. Is this the kindness village? That is perfect. Now it's the traffic parade. Yeah! Wow! Yeah! They're part of the parade now. Wow! Is that it? I don't know. I'm a burger king when I get a burger on my garden. And now we're going to get another advertisement. I told you, we were right that we didn't miss things. Because there wasn't the number that they stated online. There just seems to be gaps in between. Like big gaps. We waited for like 15 minutes at one point, and then I kind of rolled in. So we thought that was it. And I mean, the cosplay part was like definitely the grand finale. You know what I'm saying? Obviously. So our plane is just to walk along this now. Oh my gosh, there's a polar bear? Whoa! That king penguin at the front is kind of creepy. That one penguin is from the... It's on products. We're just like big children. I've seen that on things. What is that? Whoa! They got little buses. They're going downhill. They got to slow it down. They got a big polar bear. This is a bit... It's so scary. It's so dark at this area. They're not dancing. They are getting a dance. Whoa! It's our own personal show. I like their hats. Those are fun. I should be out there. Hey! They like my pants. I think you need to join them now. Okay, they just got a huge line of traffic right here. But they're not letting them go. So there must be more around this corner than... This is us discovering what's going on. This is called an active parade watching. Are we doing too much research when we try and research these things? Because we do as much research as possible and we still don't know what's going on. Well, apparently not because everyone says, do your research. There just isn't things to research. And the people will freak out and be like, why don't you ask them money? And we do ask people and then they never know. We don't really know what an avar nose we ask. We even asked security guards and police at Synologue. And they didn't... They told us things as if they knew. And it wasn't true. There's more! Wow, that's amazing. They just took that out of the mall and just started rolling around. Hey, it looks like they did. Now, this is more like it. Look at that. That's already been long, actually. All right. I know. I'm going by. Okay, I'm glad it wasn't just that one little section. I was like, what the heck? Because the numbers didn't add up for more exhaust lines. Wow. That's why we're just talking about all that exhaust lines stuff right now. Oh my gosh, there's a frog. A human, Alvin. It's Alvinette. It's a girl, Tim Hunn. Alvin, watch her nuts. It's a giraffe. Marty? No. Melvin? Melvin? For real. It's got an awkward when it stands here. And then they just have to keep waving at the same people over and over. And then you feel like you're going to wave back, you know what I mean? But you already wave. Like a new time. And then you're like, what do I keep waving or do I just sit there? Just gotta keep waving. That parent has a mysteriously long beak. I'll feel okay. So this is that like show area where the TV films are over there. So we're right in a main area. That's where everything people start. At least this one on like Sinolog is going down the street. Yeah. Sinolog literally took him six hours before they got down the street. Oh. Holy nut. Why is it so creepy? Everything is creepy. It's not even a tube. Yeah, the game's creepy. We can see it. It's not even a tube. Yeah. It's not even a tube. It's not even a tube. Yeah. Yeah, the game's creepy. Pikachu coming. They already came out on their day. Go! Wow. Scary Pikachu. Bangalong, Cloud 9, Chil, C2, Cut, Advertising, Swismis. Oh, the Jack and Jill. With those Swismis, Solder, Raced, the Jack and Jill. In the Philippines? Yeah. That's so interesting that like a lot of American brands sold their rights to Philippines brand. They just bought that one if you want them. They bought this just like franchising them out but just to a company. Oh my gosh, that's so scary. It looks like it's about to devour the entire crowd. It's coming for us I think. I hope it deflates its lands right on top of them. That'll be sick. Oh man. Hey. Oh, I'm kidding. They have to pull it down. This is your chance to get on top of it. I can mount them. You can mount. Hold it in the pop. They're like getting some of the pipes up there. Roller blades? Wow, look at your backwards. I can do that. Me too. You have to get them. You have to. The boss battle. This entire saga has been leading up to this moment. He's here in the flesh. You're not just desecrating his monuments. It's time to go for the king. I got my path. I'll push all five of these people and run. Make a break for it. It's time for the king's layer as you. And it's time to take him down. Follow me, Jamie Lannister. It's time to get on the news. Ford or assault the Joll of the year. You have to do it. I think it was mere only 20 feet away from the tee. And I failed. I failed. But you know what they say. Failure is a learning opportunity to attack in the next leg. I was going to say, actually, assassinations are not to be poiled with. You must make sure the time is right. That too. I'm going to kick them in. I'm going to call it a TikTok shop. Cutie. Don't be so. Interesting. Oh, my gosh. And now it's a celebration of featuring our Valley on. It's true. Now laugh that ford. Much better. That's the parade. I mean, they brought a lot more stuff. If it would have been that little section, it would have been like, yeah, you know. And we went into the ball to pee a bit and like, give our thoughts on what we missed in that time period too. So who knows. That was pretty impressive. There's a lot to it. A lot of stuff going on. Some big boy balloons. And it was very loud. They definitely like to turn down the speakers a bit. Now we're going to try to get the frack out of here. I bet you the traffic shouldn't be great around this area. Oh, I'm sure. I'm sure. We're going to have to lock, I think, down towards like the tail end of BGC. Hopefully we can get a grab and then we can get the frack out of here. That was pretty exciting. That was pretty exciting. It was pretty cool. I'm glad there was more. I mean, we were, you can tell we were like, oh, that was cool. Like, you know, like, you know. And then that definitely made it 100 times better. The creepy dog, I think, with my favorite part. Me too. The parade brings chaos. Look at all these taxi drivers like, oh, I'm losing it. I don't know my cash right now. You know, this isn't Edsa. This is the chimney. Edsa does look like this any day. Yeah, every day. Thanks for watching. From here at the Christmas Grand Parade in BGC. But you all know we have one more thing left to do. Santa? Tell me if you really did. Oh, really cool. Well, guys, this is one of those return of the King's style 50 endings of a tri-fade video. We're trying to get out of BGC now. And we're not going to be able to get a grab. We're trying to go over to Makati right now. But it says from BGC to Makati, it'll take over 40 minutes. It's not that far. No, it's not. And the BGC bus. I'm assuming it's going to be full. Because it was full when we tried to get here in the first place. And I imagine getting out after that event will be even more full. So we have a problem. It might have to be solved with a lot of walking. We do a lot, but my gosh, we've already done that a lot today. The traffic has returned up here. We've had this problem before where we aren't able to get a grab. Whether it's from like Buen Dia, which is the closest MRT station to BGC. Or from Taft when we're trying to use the airport. We get out, try to get a grab. No, just taxi. Pull his cameras. I got a garden. I got a garden. I got a garden. I guess that's a no. He's driving away. He's been pulled up and then drove away, I guess. We're going to have a walk on our hands. These dang events. Lots of walking after. Lots of walking. Is it a vlog last year? I think we literally walked for two hours after. Because there was no taxis or buses or anything. Everyone was walking. They were all full. We were going to get on a bus and it was like a zombie movie. People were swarming into the bus. We might have a situation upon us right now. At least it's a nice night tonight. It is. It's not too hot anymore. It was a lot really hot earlier, but now it's fine. A little breeze. Maybe this will cut to Santa Claus. Maybe we'll have more things to share with you. But as of right now, see you later. Hey, hey, wake up. What? What? It's time for the giveaway. I thought we were going to the parade. We just went to the parade. Dude, you're having some weird memory issues recently. You did invite Santa to the parade? What do you mean you're with me all day? What's going on? You want? I'm starting to get pretty pissed. So am I, foracker. Why did I get invited again? Well, Duck, we never invite you to things. But tell you, you were there. This is starting to piss- I was in there. I'm only there if my beard is equipped. And I don't remember having a beard equipped anywhere. So you're telling me life doesn't exist when you don't have that beard on. Life is nothing without the dark energy of my Santa costume. Dark energy? Oh, oh, oh, it's time for the giveaway. Who's going to be the lucky winner from our Lausanne episode? Let's find out today.
