 
everybody so welcome to a new episode here in the 
Philippines and today we left our main area BGC  
and came to a brand new area that we have never 
been here before so this area is called Quezon  
City I'm not sure I'm pronounce it right but is it 
Quezon Quezon Quezon City but anyway we first stop  
today we are here at uh University of Philippines 
uh dealer I think it's how it's pronounce it but  
we just saying it was so chaotic on the way here 
so so so chaotic first of all my driver he was  
driving super fast and I thought I'm gonna have 
more white here after I get off this ride because  
so stressful it was so stressful so you drive 
in like background you boss Big Boss holy crap  
yeah he was he was he was driving on bus lanes 
and super fast like going 80 or 100 on a highway  
just turning they were bus haunting me in the back 
but yeah here at Philippines University first time  
first time coming to University in the Philippines 
oh I never see like this it's amazing Universe  
I want to study here most um green place I have 
seen in the Philippines so far I think with parks  
yeah and not just um like students here there are  
lots of kids playing around here as 
well so looks like a pretty nice area
wow this is beautiful like a Sun's shining on 
you wow you look so beautiful today thank you  
what do you guys think of Alina today beautiful 
right what are you gonna do here we're gonna run  
I'm okay I'm okay
but yeah so many kids yeah and and yeah not 
just like um not just adults here after this  
University like students but there are 
many uh kids playing around here as well  
I actually just came from a long way I walked 
around 10 minutes to find you just now really  
yeah it's such a big Park it's like sorry 
University I forgot for a second University  
is like a park park yeah it's like a yeah not a 
park yeah but wow crazy universities here in the  
Philippines are so beautiful I think this has made 
one of the biggest maybe it's so beautiful yeah
it reminds me of yeah this 
really feels like a big Park  
and fresh air like after just now coming from 
Seoul so so heavy traffic on the way from BGC to  
here and you know sitting on our ass for almost 
more than an hour it's so nice just walking  
and I heard some music coming from that 
site so let's head over to the music area  
you want to come cut through the 
horse from here okay let's go
yeah I hear some music in the background over 
there wow this is a perfect place for a picnic  
as well I think yeah but when you're driving 
here one hour you know yeah yeah from BGC did  
you drive here exactly yeah that's crazy yeah 
drivers here they just get like I don't know  
from one hour drive 200 pesos and it's maybe not 
all among them for them maybe it's like House of  
company House of them so it's so little yeah it 
is is crazy yeah but we did take a motorbike just  
then to here so I know there are ways where you 
can take the the train and after we can take the  
um the bus to get here but we chose the 
easiest way and fastest way with the  
sunset now oh so many rocks here if this 
is Australia I would be so scared because  
I'll be scared of like stepping on snake or 
kangaroo [ __ ] no see when you're jumping
okay all right let's head over to the festival 
but you can see so big space at University I  
think I like University here in the Philippines 
it feels nice especially this one this one's nice  
this reminds me of Korea actually yeah me too and  
Sun Sunshine summer it feels nice like 
there's many young people angry [Music]
we don't feel like there's enough enough like 
Plantation this reminds me Australia actually  
when we go to picnic when you bring 
strawberry oh strawberry next time we  
come here and technique yeah it's good Eric 
picnic I think yeah more eerily though but  
goodness an hour and a half just to get here just 
saying we're leaving through traffic it's crazy  
three o'clock we start and 
then arrive at like 4 30 yeah
I don't even know if we can catch 
a bike here all the way back to BGC  
yeah we might have to make a pit stop 
somewhere and then catch another bike  
but here they have a store I want to go 
and get get some snacks of water yeah
what's up all right I'll just get 
one bottle I think we'll get a big  
bottle yeah okay okay yes 30. 
30 for this one okay thank you
we need faster let's walk around 
the sunshine go down sunset
see Justin have new t-shirts from Shane I 
like it it's a cute style the only reason  
why I wear is t-shirt it's because 
I leave the house for me so Beauty
and also because this is like a matching outfit  
with Alina's outfit today it's 
like blue and blue and white
so this is I believe one of the main blocks here 
and surprisingly it doesn't it feels like a like  
a university building to me because future 
University in around the world they have like  
electric halls and rather than this this is like 
a small classroom this feels like um my secondary  
school looks a bit like this actually we've got 
like wooden doors I don't know if they've got  
like chalks uh like black Bots over there but 
yeah this gift gives off that Vibe all right  
so we've arrived where the crowd is at the moment 
you can see there's so many people around us like  
kids adults even like older people they're here 
at this University and you see you've got some  
street foods over here as well oh it looks like 
some sort of blood we've had this before [Music]  
like uh some sort of intestines and uh 
I think this might be Pickler as well  
more Square crack here we've had that 
before at the visoria so I'm gonna  
skip that form today and uh some chicken 
heart I think many intestines here many  
um like different parts of animals that 
we haven't had before but uh the names  
like ate baboy I don't know these are 
like very very Filipino snacks [Music]
roadcon is always a good option I guess and 
yeah more intestines here see we've got uh  
that's blood chocolate that's not chocolate 
chocolate [Music] and then there's uh the  
pancit Kent on here as well I think that's one of 
the signature um Filipino Ramen they call it here
let's keep going wow I think there might be oh

different culture very different culture
my Filipino friend actually told me um yeah 
maybe I don't know if it's correct or not but  
he said Filipino people are more conservative 
compared to other countries that's why they  
are they love singing But dancing is not yeah

wow universities here in the Philippines all 
the buildings are three three stories tall Max  
oh that one's a bit taller the building but uh it 
seems like so different to University in Australia  
especially where I came from so I actually studied 
University of Melbourne and my University looks a  
bit like Hogwarts yeah it's like a bit of 
a mix and old you know Harry Potter hello
oh I just eat so cool now yeah next time thank you  
people are so nice make stickers too I think so 
I think many of you guys have been asking us to  
give stickers to our subscribers on the street if 
they ask for our channel so we might be doing that  
everything yeah we also need a logo 
we also need a logo for our Channel
wow they're more food I think it's getting 
a bit repetitive now it's all the streets  
street food are the ones we saw here 
we saw it over there as well so yeah I  
think this is a repeat version just look 
at Luke University but now today we are
exactly we're gonna make a video about first 
impression of Quezon City but honestly first  
impression Philippine University is really insane 
already so I think that's what this video is study

to tell you about my University I keep getting  
distracted my University okay so compared to this 
one like University my University looks like hot  
words Harry Potter I remember your Universe yeah 
it's so beautiful but this kind of reminds me of  
my University too but my University makes up more 
than and I like the old the old ones looks like  
Hogwarts and the new one it looks like a tall 
building with 30 floors so there's a mix and a  
campus it's basically it's quite a big area 
in the city I'm trying to find a rubbish fin
such a nice campus very nice University I 
never expected University in the Philippines  
looks this beautiful who can study 
here my university in Russia it looks
I don't know how it looks just like a small 
little building like one building like this  
yeah nothing special no territory no like Park 
no nothing yeah and the good thing about this  
University is there's so big Park areas I just 
love this I don't know it's like every every  
University in Philippines like this or just one 
I think we walked past quite a few before uh like  
for example when we went from cebud bajo um we 
actually drove past University it's quite small  
so this is a little bit different yeah not good 
everyday typical University this one I like it  
I think I would be um I'll be willing to 
study here too many stay in my dom rooms  
and then just walk to University holding on 
a book to MacBook throwback to University  
this might sound ideal but when you actually 
study you'll be like oh no why did I study
is it too late for me because I won so 
bad okay hello hello what flavor do you

three flavors here you need to take a big big bite

Stewie ice cream okay thank you thank 
you bye-bye we go this way this way  
wow this um this I this is a complete but so 
bad experience for me because it's so tasty  
it's so different to the one I had I did the 
story last time last time it was a bit watery  
but it's been so tasty yeah last time so what 
like a water yeah this time it's like thicker  
really really original yeah I love it [Music] I 
don't know how Justin can eat like a little bit
taste oh it tastes like a mango 
I think it's a mix of mango  
green I don't know what green 
is so so recommendation yes  
ice cream in a in a university it's so tasty 
my goodness it hits differently I think I can  
imagine people like study so hard the whole day 
and then just coming out of school and it's like  
oh ice cream I'm gonna get it now and see like 
make my study rewarding yeah let's go next next
in a way I feel like we're walking on the wrong 
direction just because everyone's coming this way  
yeah look at the backdrop it's so beautiful 
we're walking towards the sunset right now  
and it looks absolutely stunning and the 
trees oh it looks like magic trees no  
it's like magic trees with ruins oh but 
there's so many cars gonna watch out  
but yeah why is everyone heading this way are we 
walking towards I think they're walking towards  
exit uh they're going through the concert maybe 
or maybe the exit is this way but we don't know  
anyway we haven't seen this way yet wow how big 
is this park oh my goodness compared to another  
Park to be fair that one is not really a pad that 
one is more like a monument you know someone yeah  
but this one it's insane yeah love this place 
wood picnic here and starting this University  
any day it's just a one one thing it's just that 
is this University classrooms because it looks  
like a normal like secondary school classroom 
doesn't it really in really yeah yeah it's  
like in high school like Secondary School usually 
not not University yeah you know I never saw like  
this in Russia don't have what it's so normal 
in Asia because in Russia cold so we always
[Music]
wooden doors empty [Music] yeah it's very normal 
in Asia I grew up um like going to classrooms  
like this when I was in Hong Kong but my building 
was built on top of like a hill so it was so tall  
so yeah but it's something like this but this is 
like normally High School classrooms University I  
didn't expect them to have the same similar wow I 
can totally imagine this as like a getaway place  
in between the classes like after a long maybe 
two hours of lecture you just come out here and  
embrace nature breathing some fresh air refresh 
your mind May drink some coffee on this green lawn  
and after they head right back to the classroom 
but I think this is a great getaway because the  
Park area is so big and yeah too bad we couldn't 
come during lunch time I was thinking if during  
the day whether this would be completely occupied 
like full of people around you maybe um in the  
student lockers they have their own picnic mat 
all right you guys they do this all the time  
but yeah I I really didn't like cannot imagine 
this is a university if you ask me this is just  
like a very nice recreational park for family 
and friends I would think Elena no time vlogging  
just focusing on eating ice cream turn always 
little it's okay I can help you finish okay I  
just want my waffles can you eat instantly the 
whole thing you want me no no no I want to eat  
on the inside you know inside on the inside on 
the inside only inside I'll drink I'll drink
hey that's like so so small pot thank you
yeah so tasty ice cream definitely um if you guys 
finish interesting make sure to go and see that  
um that that that ice cream
well deserved wow this can 
be like a romantic dates baby  
see it's it's Valentine's Day 
and hey not the end people
see Valentine's Day today and they 
were just having a romantic picnic wow  
that can be um you and me next time 
next time come here picnic okay  
then ah you've never seen ants like 
this is a small in Australia standard
[Music]  
wow it's almost as well I've never seen ends it 
is normal size in Australia in Russia so it's  
little yeah when you go to Australia there are 
many things here ends from like this side yeah  
in our Cebu apartment before it was crazy there 
were so many ends in the apartment not because  
okay not because not because we were like 
leaving food everywhere it was just some  
ants existing in the apartment and they actually 
bite through holes in packaging of biscuits and  
eat the biscuits inside packaging so when we 
open a package we saw ants inside a package  
it's so crazy yeah and it was like a cake kind 
of cookie so when we like open up the cake we  
see ants inside so I was like oh what do you 
eat you know it was Health already in my mouth
oh did we go to the wrong place oh what 
do you think of um students studying in  
the Philippines University do you think they 
are like happier more relaxed oh dude they  
look very stressful I think I think they 
are relaxed and happy compared to Korea  
I agree of course you see people's face like 
so stressful and on a bus to study all the time  
really because yeah it's so social competitive 
Hong Kong I don't know maybe we only see one  
side of it because now it's Friday and it's 
after school now it's maybe a bit more relaxed  
uh they look more relaxable playing badminton 
Park Etc so yeah I think overall it has a very  
chill atmosphere that I really like I think 
if I study here I would really like it here
and we find this a small Road like 
um Forest mini forest in University  
wow this is like the this park alone is 
bigger than any parkour we saw in between
this is in BGC oh my goodness BGC [Music] 
what is University not nearby Beatrice  
that'll be so nice I guess this this place the 
good thing about it it's kind of away from the  
main road I guess because it's a bit far into 
like the woods and everything so it's a better  
environment to study you guys living in fresh air 
and when you finish that you can come outside and  
just like relax in the garden I think that's 
what I do when I was in university I I come off  
class and I just lie down on the grass like 
this it's so relaxing because I love nature  
I I won't tell about my experience you lie down 
snow uh-huh yeah yeah right you're right I'm  
not down on snow what is this University 
or I'm just don't go out when it snows  
oh you just don't go to university yeah just 
don't go to university I like going to University  
because so cold and you need to take train and one 
and a half hour go to university in Moscow right  
okay Alina what's your first thing that 
you noticed when you first came to this  
University that's like different to the 
university compared to the rest of the world
Russian universities of being so cool weather 
the summer like people can realize what you think
in Russia University no Park no of 
course no Russian versus like a box  
it's like small University as well so 
small oh I have big university but I  
guess big university have 
just only building [Music]  
universities in Central Moscow like a lot of 
space yeah right not so nature oh yeah and also  
in Philippines amazing um High every time every 
sunset we just see this yeah students after school  
they can like come to here and just watch sunset 
together this looks like a movie it does yeah
and for me I feel like University 
in the Philippines it's it's a  
it's a bit similar to Hong Kong in a way the 
Virginia University in Hong Kong usually it's like  
not too high building as well also like five or 
six floors but then I think just then I saw quite  
a few like classrooms that reminds me more of like 
a high school rather than a university um but yeah  
I think like Elena the best thing I noticed about 
in this University is the huge greeneries around  
here it's just absolutely amazing and yeah I just 
can imagine so many ways if this this I think the  
in terms of like greeneries and everything this 
is even better than my university in Australia  
because in Australia even though there are 
green Parks like this it's not as big and  
even have rivers or like channels and yeah which 
is amazing I think it's not all of the University  
I use I think it just in this particular 
University is so lucky in University yeah
maybe this University is like one of the 
top in the Philippines I think uh maybe the  
government put a lot of investment in here 
yeah but I think the sky is getting darker  
now but yeah that's our first impression of 
Philippines University thanks for watching guys  
all right see you next time goodbye
