Mmm!
Super nice flavour.
This would be my least favourite so far.
Am I allowed to say McDonald’s in here?
Welcome to Jollibee!
The happiest place in The Philippines!
It’s definitely a happy place.
A jolly place if you will.
Jollibee is the biggest fast food chain
in The Philippines by a long shot.
They are bigger than every other
fast food brand combined in The Philippines.
So they’re massive — so popular.
And we’ve never tried Jollibee before at all
so we have to try it.
We’re going to go inside, order a whole bunch of food
and see what Jollibee’s all about.
So excited.
Okay can we please have a bucket of Chickenjoy
and can we also have the Jolly Spaghetti
that comes with the hot dogs?
And also an Aloha Yum Burger
and also a Yum Burger with cheese?
And a Deluxe Chicken Sandwich
and the Burger Steak
and the Fiesta Noodles?
So much food.
Yeah.
And also the Jolly Hotdog
and gravy like on the side.
Can we get both kinds of floats, please?
I’ve never ordered this much food in my life I think.
No.
I think that’s it.
We will just call your number, ma’am this one.
Okay.
-Okay bye, thank you.
Thank you so much!
Thank you!
So what’s the grand total?
1342.
So they gave us a number and they’re
going to call us when it’s ready.
I think it will probably take a while with all of this.
-I think so.
Thank you ma’am, enjoy your meal.
It’s on two trays!
Looks so good.
Wow!
Okay, it took three trays to get our order to our table.
And I think I’m going to start with the drinks.
They make floats here.
And also, Jollibee is not just in The Philippines.
They have more than 1500 stores in 17 countries.
So if you like what you see, look up
if there’s a Jollibee near you
because you may need to very quickly run there
after I try all this delicious-looking food.
To be honest, it was really hard to hear,
so I’m not actually sure what kind of float this is
but I’m hoping the taste will alert me to the flavour.
Looks like Coke or Root Beer.
Yeah it does.
Oh yeah, it tastes like a Coke float.
Nice!
Classic.
-Oh yum!
I have to be careful…I have to pace myself.
-Yes!
I have to be careful that I don’t fill up my stomach.
Which food do you think you’ll try first?
Chickenjoy.
Oh nice!
Okay but first there’s one more float.
Oh yes.
This is…looks like an Orange Crush or Fanta kind of float.
Whoa that’s sweet!
That is really sweet.
It tastes like a Creamsicle.
That’s good.
Okay, I have to try the Chickenjoy first.
If you haven’t heard of Chickenjoy,
it’s the number one thing on the menu at Jollibee.
I’ve heard it compared to, you know, Kentucky Fried Chicken.
I’ve also heard it’s much better
so I’m very excited to try it for myself.
One million Chickenjoys served per day.
That’s a lot…that’s a lot of chicken.
It’s a lot of joy, it’s a lot of chicken.
Yeah.
Okay so here’s the big reveal of the chicken.
That is some fried chicken.
Yes.
And it comes with gravy.
And because we got a bucket,
it came with three containers of gravy.
Nice looking gravy.
So I guess you dip the chicken in the gravy?
Of course you do.
-I think.
That will bring more joy to the chicken.
To the chicken or to me?
To you.
I don’t think this chicken’s having much joy.
-Not the chicken.
The chicken’s not having a great day.
Here we go.
I get it.
That’s good fried chicken.
I don’t eat a lot of fried chicken it must be said,
but that is good.
Wow.
It’s super juicy and crispy on the outside.
Oh!
That’s good.
And the batter is really buttery it seems.
Yeah.
More juicy, less crispy, but very flavourful.
Okay we’re off to a good start.
After the Chickenjoy, I would say that this
is the most popular,
most well known thing on the Jollibee menu.
It’s the Jolly Spaghetti.
It’s been described as Filipino spaghetti to me
and my understanding is that it tastes sweet.
It has ground meat and cut up hotdogs
and a banana ketchup,
which is sweeter than other ketchup.
So I’m very excited to try this.
Should I get a hotdog on the first bite?
Heck yeah you should.
-Here we go.
Oh that’s good.
It is sweet.
It’s much sweeter than normal, you know,
spaghetti sauce that I would have
but it is really good.
I can see why this is really popular.
Would you say it’s jollier?
It’s jollier.
It’s jollier spaghetti.
-It’s definitely jollier.
I mean look at that.
That is jolly spaghetti.
The hotdogs…very unexpected.
That’s good.
I would order that again.
Two for two!
Alright!
Next up in the noodle dish category
is another super popular dish.
This is a Filipino noodle dish called Palabok
and it’s also known as Fiesta Noodles.
And it’s got a shrimp sauce…shrimp on top,
ground meat, and hard-boiled eggs.
It smells good.
So I’m just going to grab a little bit
of everything in this bite.
It’s hard to do this.
Survey says?
That’s good.
It’s also kind of sweet.
Oh yeah?
-I would say.
Yeah.
Like the sweet sauce?
Yeah, not like the spaghetti but…
Fiesta in your mouth?
Yes!
And actually, the man at the front desk at our hotel…
I asked him what we should order…
this was his number one pick.
It was, yes.
He was very excited about it.
-Yes.
So I can tell him now that I tried it and I loved it.
This is the Burger Steak served with rice
and it has mushrooms on top.
And it’s not the burger steak’s fault
but I don’t like mushrooms so...
seeing it covered with mushrooms,
not a great first impression for the burger steak
but I am going to…
Tough it out.
I don’t have a knife so I’m just going to use my fork.
Okay burger steak…
This would be my least favourite so far.
Okay.
But I don’t like mushrooms.
There must be one.
I just…I don’t like mushrooms.
Yeah.
Next up is the Aloha Champ Burger.
Their Champ Burger sounds to me like 
kind of their just basic burger
and then you can have different kind of iterations of it.
The Aloha means that there’a big pineapple slice on top.
I love pineapple.
I love Hawaiian pizza.
Leave a comment down below if you love Hawaiian pizza 
because it’s one of these polarizing dishes.
People have very strong feelings about pineapple on pizza.
I feel very strongly that it belongs on the pizza.
It was invented in Canada.
Yes, Hawaiian pizza was invented in Canada
not far from where I grew up actually.
So I feel very protective of Hawaiian pizza.
So let me know if you are a pineapple
on the pizza fan or not and let’s settle this.
Let’s get this out.
Whoa…this has girth.
That’ heavy.
Okay it’s got bacon, it looks like some kind of sauce…
I don’t know if that’s like a Champ Burger sauce or something.
Wow.
It actually has two slices of pineapple.
Look at that.
I approve these pineapple slices.
-Interesting.
Lots of parts of the world they put
pineapple on their burgers.
At home it’s funny.
We don’t, we put it on our pizza but not our burgers.
No, true.
So, we could learn a thing or two.
Okay.
That was good.
Wow.
This would be very filling I think
because I mean this…it’s a big…
Yeah.
It’s a big burger.
It’s a champ.
It’s a champ of burgers.
It’s like half the size of your head.
I like that.
I would definitely order that again.
I thought we should open up another box
next after the Champ Burger
and try the Chick’nwich.
I think it’s the Deluxe Chicken Sandwich.
I think I ordered the Deluxe Chicken Sandwich
but I’m pretty sure that comes with lettuce.
As you can see this does not have lettuce.
So if you guys could help me out if you know,
is this just the regular chicken sandwich?
Like I’m not quite sure so if you know, let me know.
We’ll just go with original chicken sandwich.
-Yeah.
I think it’s original.
-Yeah.
The bun is squishy.
Look at that chicken.
Whoa!
I feel like for a place that’s known for its fried chicken,
the Chickenjoy, the chicken sandwich has got to be good.
Anything chicken related.
-Yeah.
And I love sauce.
It’s yummy.
It’s very plain.
But the chicken is just so good, it doesn’t need much else.
-The chicken is so juicy.
Yeah it’s so juicy and the sauce is kind of sweet.
Like a honey mustard mayo sauce.
Simple, good.
Yum.
Yum, yum.
When I looked at the menu, I felt like
the Yumburger seemed to be a staple.
I don’t know if you guys agree
but I got the Yumburger with cheese,
which looks like, you know, basically a cheeseburger
with nothing else on it.
Let me just double check here.
Okay I lied, there’s mayonnaise.
It looks like mayonnaise or some other kind of sauce,
and then just cheese and the hamburger.
Look how the sauce came out.
I have no problem with a little extra sauce at all.
Unless you’re like me and you’re not really a fan of mayo.
Who are my people out there that don’t like mayo?
Raise your hand!
Who thinks Marc will eventually come to the mayo side?
No.
It’s super plain but I like it.
If you just wanted a very basic,
like not a huge burger like the Champ Burger,
you know, it gets the job done.
The Yumburger with cheese.
I don’t think it would be the first thing that I’d order
because I’ve tried so many delicious things now
but I would order it again.
Nice!
Yeah.
Good.
Mmm!
I’ll leave some for you to try.
Get rid of the mayo.
You’re going to try it!
It’s not terrible.
I think it’s the other things in it making up for it.
Like the meat.
And the cheese.
It is good though.
Yeah.
Okay.
You win.
But I’m not converting to being a mayo lover.
Not going that far.
Not yet.
Not going that far.
Not yet.
Last up in the savoury Jollibee lineup,
for us at least because you know
we’re not going to skip dessert,
is the Jolly Hotdog.
I have to say putting ‘jolly’ in front of things
on the menu does elevate it in a way.
It just seems jolly.
So here’s the Jolly Hotdog.
My favourite hotdogs in the world are Icelandic hotdogs.
Yeah.
Pilsa.
It must be said.
I don’t think I’ve ever seen cheese on a hotdog
so this will be a first for me.
Okay.
Exciting.
Yeah.
They should’ve reversed it and had
spaghetti in the Jolly Hotdog.
Not loving the bun.
Oh!
It’s the first bun that I haven’t really liked.
Okay.
It’s not bad, it’s just a bun.
I don’t know.
Okay.
-Less special.
Right.
I would say that of all the things that I’ve tried,
this would be my least favourite along with the Burger Steak.
If I had to pick.
It’s, you know…
you’ll notice I am eating it though.
You are eating it.
I’m still eating it.
It’s still happening.
-Yes.
You didn’t take more than one bite of the Burger Steak.
-Maybe I spoke too soon.
Maybe I spoke too soon.
We’re going to order some dessert now.
She’s shocked that we’re back.
Yeah.
Can we please have the Peach Mango Pie?
Could we have the Buko Pie as well?
And the Ube Cheese Pie?
And could we get a Chocolate Sundae?
Just the regular size.
I think that’s it.
Thank you.
180.
Okay.
I promised you dessert.
We’re starting with a Chocolate Sundae.
Sundae Twirl.
Creamy, smooth.
Wow!
Looks so good.
Looks very inviting.
Oh wow.
I think that’s a good reaction?
That’s good!
For a minute there I wasn’t sure.
I was just processing.
Processing in real time.
The chocolate is really chocolatey…like rich flavour.
Oh nice.
Am I allowed to say McDonald’s in here?
It doesn’t taste like a McDonald’s sundae.
It tastes a little bit different., I’m not sure why.
But the ice cream itself tastes different.
Yeah, it looks a bit different too.
The texture, everything.
Yeah.
I’d order that every day of the week!
I’ll see you later.
So if you’re not in the mood for something cold,
they also have hot pies here.
This Mango Peach Pie is the one I have been looking forward to
that was highly, highly, highly recommended.
Peach and mango are two of my favourite flavours.
Oh!
That looks good.
Nice and warm.
Okay Peach Mango Pie.
Careful you don’t burn your tongue.
I know, that’s true.
Maybe do a little nibble and let some heat out.
Test bite.
Look at this.
It’s really hot.
Holy jumpin’.
I love mango.
It’s delicious.
-I feel like you can’t go wrong.
It’s very fruity-tasting.
That is delicious.
That filling is really nice.
I definitely taste more peach than mango.
Super nice flavour.
Okay I’ll save some for you.
Thank you.
Oh!
I’ve been dreaming about this.
Ever since I started looking into Jollibee.
This is what I was most anticipating.
And it delivers.
This is incredible.
Next up in the pie category, Buko Pie.
This is a Filipino coconut pie
and it’s also going to be super hot I’m sure.
Okay.
Mmm!
Big chunks of coconut.
Oh yeah?
Yeah.
Like it’s creamy but you can…there’s chunks in there,
which I always love bits.
Yeah, bits are great.
I like it but I wouldn’t order it over the peach mango.
Okay.
Because I like the peach mango more.
Yeah.
Next up, Ube Cheese
or…other.
Other.
I’ve got to say, this guy is so cute.
Yeah.
He really is cute.
Oh my gosh!
Look at the purple inside!
Looks like fun.
It just kind of tastes like cheese to me though.
It mostly tastes like a…like a cheesecake filling.
At least that’s the flavour I get.
Okay.
I do love the purple.
Yeah.
This is good too but honestly…
The winner is…
Nothing is touching the peach mango.
Nothing at all.
This is the winner.
Of the pies.
-Of the pies.
But I have to say, I’m a sundae gal.
Good old tried and true.
I’m a simple sundae gal.
And if I had to pick one dessert off the menu, this is it.
I think our first time trying food at Jollibee was a huge success.
It’s hard to pick favourites but I think
I have to say Chickenjoy, the spaghetti,
and tied for third would be the
Aloha Champ Burger and the chicken burger.
If you have been to Jollibee, I would love to know
