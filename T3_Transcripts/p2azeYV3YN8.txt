Right. So we're in the room.
This is the view.
Yeah. Nice cheeky little pool.
Beach down there today.
Today. Today, we are.
Back in action.
We're going to go
and do a food tour of Siargao
because there are so many restaurants
here.
It's unbelievable.
We've been here for a week
and we tried pretty much
most of the decent restaurants.
So we'll let you know where to eat,
what you can expect,
and then you make your own decision
from that.
Right.
I'm going to give you a quick pan.
This is how we live. It's disgusting.
And I'm very proud of it
because we live out of suitcases
six months of the year
and we have a three year old.
If you think we're unpacking,
hanging out, folding.
You're very mistaken.
If you think Lawrence has ever touched
an item from the case?
No, he hasn't.
We've all got roles
in these relationships.
Mummy is the.
The backbone of the organization.
She makes sure
everyone's needs are met.
Apart from mine, Jake and Tiff.
are great. Loved them from months ago.
I'll put their channel here aswell
They're like a younger, hotter
version of us.
They are. Well said.
They're younger, better
looking, cooler,
nicer.
Just. Just.
Better everything than us, really.
So shout out Jake & tiff we love you.
Bit creepy, really?
Because we haven't actually met them,
but we love them.
This is Shaka.
This is where we had breakfast.
It's really, really, really popular
for breakfast, it's beautiful.
It's on the beach. The food's amazing.
It's very healthy living food.
It's smoothie bowls,
it's like maca powder.
It's, you know, acai.
That kind of vibe.
It's really popular, but it's worth
noting that it is 'No meant' here.
So here basically they have
a few different eateries in one place.
They've got really clean
eating place down here.
They've got Lechon up there,
but around here.
Now we haven't managed
to actually get in.
We haven't actually,
oh god that scare the lif eout of me.
We haven't actually managed
to get in here because it's so busy.
Every time we've come, there's a place
called Las Barricas.
This place is always packed
and always packed with locals
and it looks like to be like a mexican
tacos, that kind of place.
But I don't know if they do other
stuff as well, but it's always packed.
If you can get in there, get in there.
This place.
we've got to tell you about
because we came here just by chance.
It was packed.
So we thought, we'll try
that, it's going to be lovely.
This is it says Italian Filipino
comfort food,
but it's basically Italian food.
The owner is Italian.
Everything is like properly
fresh made pasta, lasagna
like it is gorgeous.
Literally is probably the best lasagne
I've ever had in my life.
This restaurant here,
I had a pasta, shrimp.
Not very good.
It looks really nice.
Looks very clean.
It's very popular but...
I didn't have a great experience
in there the pasta was very oily.
Some people might disagree
but I didn't have a great experience.
One thing I would say we did wish for
because it's been raining on and off
since we've been here.
But it's like 10, 15 minutes,
maybe half an hour showers
and then the sun comes back.
I thought it would be really nice
to have a really clear day.
No! it's so hot,
clear blue skies,
but it is absolutely sweltering.
So I'm praying for some rain.
Right.
Next restaurant This is another
really famous place to eat here.
It's called Bravo.
They've got a it's a really,
really nice resort, actually.
They've got a little skate...
I don't know what you call it.
Not a half pipe,
a little skate thing at the front.
But then when you go
in, it's actually quite like upscale.
It's like really beachy.
It's lovely.
It's got a little pool.
It backs onto the beach.
The food is really, really good also.
I would say my favorite restaurant
here,
this is where I got the Thai
from for Eleise & Nyh yesterday.
The prawns are really fresh.
I'm just going to show you a quick
look around inside.
I would say it's exactly
the same prices as all the rest,
but the quality is
just so much better.
Eleise said the
Thai food was incredible,
so definitely recommend this place.
I had a great time. Hello.
So La Mesa fully recommend.
The guys are
lovely, nice bar, great food.
This one's a good one.
The sweat is real. Okay.
We've just arrived off the beaten
path, says pool party 5 to 11.
Happy hour all night.
That's what we like.
So many surfboards.
This is awesome.
Kamusta Ka Po.
Hello. Is the restaurant open?
Yeah. Okay, good. Breakfast?
Yeah. Okay, thank you.
Just got here.
It's actually closed for breakfast,
but I am going to stick around
for half an hour
and then they'll be open for lunch.
So we're going to have
a very early lunch.
Nyh Nyhs, what did you see?
Everywhere's a zoo in the Philippines.
Is it tasty?
You be careful.
What did you order?
Bruschetta and a carbonara.
Because...
he loves a carbonara.
This is an accurate representation
of Lawrence ready...
I want to eat this carbonara, but I
can't because I'm not going to eat it
because it's not made of eggs,
it's made with cream.
And that's not
how proper carbonara is made.
Next what we're
going to do, we're gonna go from here.
After we've eaten.
We're going to go to the market
where we went the other day,
if you've seen that video.
and we're going to pick up some fish.
We're going to pick up some shrimps,
we're going to pick up some fruit.
We're going to have
a little barbecue at our place,
because it's about time
that we showed you our place
because we have been saying
every video and it's really cool.
So if you come to Siargao
it's a cool place to stay.
There's not a lot,
I say there's not a lot,
in the General Luna
It's quite western, the food.
There's all different kinds of food.
they love an Italian here,
they love loads of different cuisines,
but there's not necessarily like
a really famous Filipino restaurant.
So we really want to try proper
Filipino food because everywhere's
just got western food this evening
we are going to track down
a traditional Filipino restaurant.
We are going to eat there.
We're going to love
every minute of it.
I'm going to ask you a question now.
Lawrence is going to answer for you.
How many of the Philippines
7000 islands
are inhabited?
Un- in hab. Have got people on it...
Guess
200, 1000.
What,
2000 islands.
Yeah. Wow.
We're going to visit all of them
Take off leave.
Take the leaf off.
So the best thing about having
a Lawrence
is you get to eat his food as well.
And the best thing
about having a child.
Oh my god, that was probably
one of the best pizzas
I've ever tried.
He doesn't want to share that.
Excuse the side breast.
Looking good so far
I like the texture.
Very thick spaghetti.
Needs a bit of pepper.
This is really good.
It tastes almost like a but Chinese
and a bit Indian.
The glaze. Garlic, rice.
Always a winner.
I have the pepper.
I get some fish.
We're going to cook that
on the barbecue. BBQ.
So we're just going to run in
and get some watermelon,
some pineapple, apple, salt,
pepper, lemon.
Salt, pepper, lemon, garlic.
Just going to do a bit of prep.
Cut some fruit up, cut the garlic up.
Oh, look at
that.
Mangoes.
Papaya.
lemons and garlic for the fish, which
weirdly come individually wrapped.
We're going to have a walk
round to the big pool shall we.
Oh, so on our little terrace here,
you can
see we've got a little private pool.
We're going to go round
to the big pool where the barbecue is.
There's chef.
I've been summoned to provide food
for the family.
Yes, he has, though.
So we're going to show you.
Come with us.
What's the temperature like Nyh?
Oh, it's okay, this this this.
What do you want?
this?
Oh the rubber
ring.
Oh, I'm going to try and cook
some mackerel.
No idea how it's going to come out.
So let's give it a go.
All of you that are barbecue fanatics,
you're cracking up
and probably cringing.
But we're going to get it cooked.
Believe me.
Daddy's got some
pizza for you.
Oh, yeah. Pizza?
Come on then.
And fish.
And fruit.
No not the fish.
Don;t want fish.
Put him off fish for life.
No, I don't want.
You don't want the fish.
Oh, delicious.
Well, it looks much nicer now.
Well done.
Have a little taste.
Taste test.
Oh, yeah, yeah, oh yeah.
Oh yummy.
We stopped at a few places.
No one knew where there was authentic
Filipino food.
We just drove passed this place
and on the menu.
They had everything we wanted to try.
Balay Yuhom.
Lawrence is losing
the will to live slowly.
Nyh Nyh's
can you put it on the table please.
Now watch us eat this super fast
because
we're going home
and going to bed for an early flight
and everybody needs a nap.
Me included.
We've ordered pancit.
We've ordered Sissig.
And we've ordered Ins Inas Inasal.
And Pata.
Which is the leg and Thigh.
Which is the barbecued leg
of the chicken.
Lawrence is on the edge.
Nyhs on the edge of a tantrum.
On the edge of a cliff in a minute.
Very dramatic.
The whole thing is called Pancit
Canton
Perfect pronunciation.
But my friend who's Filipino lives
in England, told me to try Pancit.
Little but closer like that.
Go on Karate Kid.
Yeah, yeah,
yeah. Okay.
He was first.
And I don't think he's far off.
I'm on the edge.
Sometimes you have one of those days.
And I'm having one of those days where
it's been a great day,
but it's one of those days where
everything's just a bit
just like getting that sentence out.
Just a bit of an effort.
We're up at 5:00 in the morning
because
someone likes early flight, so that's,
good.
I'm here for that
up at 5:00am
What are we travelling 12 hours?
2 flights
and about 7 hours in the car.
I'm going to try the chicken.
Because chicken makes me happy.
The ketchup, sir? Oh, thank you.
My ketchup.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
As soon as you put it in your mouth.
The sweet sauce that they put on it.
I don't know what it is that they use.
But it's really tasty.
Fantastic moisture
the juices
flavor thumbs up
very happy with that one.
Okay.
Sissig, sissig.
First time trying Sissig.
Let's see how it goes.
Wow, wow, wow.
Almost like black bean sauce.
You know, like, from a Chinese,
you get a black bean sauce.
Daddy. Daddy.
Onions. Daddy.
Mm hmm.
Bits of meat.
Nice.
Very tasty.
I'll be honest with you, oh.
Mosquito.
I have been putting this off because.
So it's pig face,
unfavorable pieces of the pig.
And I knew I had to try it,
but I was putting it off.
But there was no reason to put it off
because this is absolutely delicious.
So this is
basically noodles, egg noodles with
chicken sausage.
It's like different stuff
that they can put in and loads
of veg basically and like a soi
sauce.
I'm a noodle girl.
This is very nice. I like that a lot
