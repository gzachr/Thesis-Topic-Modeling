yeah but before you before you try you need 
to like tell me so i can show them your  
your reaction i bet he's gonna be so addictive 
to it hundred percent so this is a piaya they can't  
even see your face they don't have to i i have no 
idea what this is okay okay okay it's ube flavor  
there's an original which is actually muskavado 
sugar is a different kind of sugar this is ube
because he's really obsessed with ube lately 
like he was obsessed with jollibee three years ago  
um usually we it's like it's like a it's like 
a flour and then we put the ube paste or the  
muscovado sugar brown sugar paste and we put it 
in the oven which is basically good when it's hot  
so we went to the shops and we bought some how'd 
you say it piaya? piaya piaya yes yeah yeah and  
apparently it's with ube so what is this 
like a pancake so before we eat this  
she is currently making how'd you say it 
shanghai first time trying this 
i hope you like it though
so is is this made out of um flour
i guess so it's not a sticky rice  
i don't think so it's more like a 
like a pastry thing it's really nice  
i don't know about ube i really like the original 
flavor which is the muscavado brown sugar  
thing but this one is ube because 
*HE'S OBSESSED WITH UBE*
all right let's try this
and um disclaimer you need a water or something 
to drink because it's so dry not so dry  
but it makes it dry easily can i 
have a bite what's your reaction
this is pretty nice it's quite 
nice you can taste the ube
definitely have some water milk to 
go with this it's definitely a pass
hmm can we make this i can make that 
but it's very it's a lot of work to do  
and they cant use that specific 
brown sugar it's muscovado sugar
oh
i think one of these you can buy for your 
family i don't know what i'm gonna do  
when i go back to the uk we don't have 
anything like this i'm gonna have to marry her
ube is like like a purple yam exactly that's 
the english version of it you don't get it  
on parts of Europe most likely its in asia 
three hours later i'll finish this up  
and i'm gonna go and have some lumpiang shanghai
they're quite tasty next up
