 I do understand that those people who see us foreigners for example investing in the Philippines are like oh you must be crazy Like it's such a corrupt country blah blah blah blah But there must be a reason why people are building all of these things right so I think it's on a very good way to its glory right? What's up Philippines? Welcome back to another very energetic reaction video with your host Manny I hope you're having an amazing day and today We're doing something educational. We are looking into the future developments of the Philippines Which is quite interesting to be very honest and today I'm reacting to the Philippines to build the world's largest solar park Let that sink in. So I would say let's just jump straight into it see what it is about and Directed shall we? Around 2022 a Filipino renewable energy company that goes by the name of solar Philippines Immediately went on from being a no-name brand to becoming one of the most celebrated Filipino companies ever This is because the company had reported that it secured over a 2000 hectare land bank area an area it acquired is situated around Noiva, Esiha What makes this so important however is not because they simply acquired a massive amount of land It is because the company reported that this 2000 hectare land bank will be used to build 3.5 gigawatts of solar power and a further 4.5 gigawatts of hours of battery storage a Feet that most people would probably never understand what even is a gigawatts Yeah, right. It's very mega project that sits in the Philippines when finished will become the world's largest solar park ever Yes, well the country located in the eastern parts of Asia a country that is still in a Developing phase is aiming to build the world's largest solar park this And that's the same that should come as a shock to most people In the world's largest solar park it's not being built in the most developed country but rather in the Philippines It will surpass the current largest solar park which is located in India and is known as the Badla solar park Which occupies an area of about 5,700 hectares but only has a current capacity of just around 2.2 Gigawatts yet India is a much bigger area and population whereas compared to the Philippines would only be a tiny portion of it But here comes the archipelago country on its path to building a solar park farm that had far more capacity than Badla Solar Park and a capacity that would overshadow any other solar farms around the world For a further comparison the largest solar park in the United States is known as the Copper Mountain Solar Facility Which only has 0.8 Gigawatts of power or 800 megawatts or even one of China's largest solar parks ever Known as the 10-gird desert solar park which has a capacity of about 1.5 Gigawatts Therefore this newly developed... Okay, this is a really good comparison because first when I heard the amount of Gigawatts that it will supply I was just like okay but me as somebody who doesn't understand much about solar power or you know this kind of topic I'm like okay, what does this mean but this gives you a good understanding of how big it actually is A plan in the Philippines will be insurmountable but here's the thing While it is huge enough to be the world's largest What really matters is that it will push the Philippines economy and energy industry to a new level As a long running user of international and non-renewable energy the Philippines after this project will now be able to have a more adequate source of domestic and renewable energy once completed it'll help ease the electricity cost burdened by the speculative nature of energy commodity prices Which has constantly been blamed by politicians and so expensive So expensive for bringing extraordinary and unnecessary costs of electricity to the Philippines Finally this project alone is even going to surpass If you ever received a marauder call bill you know we all know that's not talk about it It's a topping that hurts All of the solar power capacity of the Philippines which as of around late 2022 and data according to the Department of Energy sits at only 1,491 megawatts of power so the most important detail surrounding this project and its eventual success Is the question who is behind this project? This is a very important factor because a lot of projects have been inaugurated in the Philippines Yet a lot of them have as well never been really fruitful Some have stopped midway Some have been plagued with corruption That's a big project We're just deemed unnecessary So who is behind this mega project? Let's take a look into it further This entire mega project is handled by a private corporation that is listed on the Philippines stock exchange Also known as Solar Philippines The company however this 2000 hectare project is handled by a private corporation listed in the Philippine public stock exchange Also known as the Solar Philippines The company however is under a holding company that goes by the name of Solar Philippines power holdings Through this holding company it owns other such a year companies Some are the likes of sp new energy corporation The Terra Solar Philippines and Corporation and a long list of other solar companies Its stock on the other hand is listed with the ticker symbol SPNEC which as of the time of this rate it trades at around one to one point Rating that sound For future investments Billion pesos A pretty small valuation for a company aiming to revolutionize the entire Philippine energy industry For comparison companies such as Ayala Corporation are valued at over 427 Billion pesos But anyway Solar Philippines's operations as reported by its investors Ayala money is different kind of money We're doing other solar projects across the Philippines And even some outside of the country Denoted as SP Batanga's Baselode is a 1.8 gigalot project Expected to have a non-land capital expenditure of about 1.5 billion dollars to the Bali project in Indonesia And a long list of other solar projects Most of their projects are occasionally contracted with overseas and major Filipino companies Its Batanga's one project for instance is partnered with South Korea for example Whereas the Tarlaq 2 project is partnered with Aken Energy An Ayala Corporation firm among others Going back to the 3.5 gigalot project that is stated to become the world's largest This small project Yes we mentioned it as small because it is just one part of the mega plan of solar Philippines You see Solar Philippines has a bold target to construct over 10 gigawatts of power projects This is therefore almost thrice more than the so-called upcoming world's largest solar park A huge feat that solar Philippines estimates will cost approximately 7 million dollars of non-land capital expenditure All in all would amount to how much was paying for it About 61 billion pesos or more than 1 billion dollars per year The cost baseline as projected by the company is about 4.36 pesos per kilowatt hour Which is far less than the current household price of electricity as reported by globalpetralprices.com At 9.7 pesos per kilowatt hour The entity established to undertake the project is known as Tera Solar Philippines A partnership between solar Philippines and Prime Infrastructure Capital A company held by the Filipino billionaire Enrique Cave Razon Who is also famous for his other companies such as International Container Terminal Services One of the world's largest global port management companies and Gloomberry Resort Corporation The owner of big entertainment buildings Come over here Both the Philippines and South Korea These two companies have then established Tera Solar Philippines With a 49.9% ownership stake going to Solar Philippines and a 50.1% stake to Prime Infrastructures The 2000 Hector Project's non-land capital expenditure Is estimated to be $3.2 billion and is slated to generate around 28 billion pesos Or more than half a billion dollars in annual sales every year The project's timeline is slated for commercial operation by 2025 And immediate start considering that it is just a few years away That's very soon Details of this project however are still unfound Tera Solar is expecting between 2.5 to 3.5 gigawatts of power And 4 to 4.5 gigawatts of batteries Therefore as the company enters into the stage of development The output could vary between the projections And a possible change from the initial projections The only question that we would arguably raise Is the exceedingly initial cost of the project While we can justify whether this is the right or even the best option for the Philippines Ok first of all this is a lot of information To the jest it's like a lot of numbers, a lot of facts So I'm going to take a few notes off to rewatch it again And just get a quick picture of what's happening When it's happening And when to make the decisions for myself You know I might be interested in investing in Solar Power in the Philippines I'm just saying you know Right now we can however say that as this is a project connected to a private corporation It is therefore aimed to make a profit On the note of being a private entity We can also suggest that unlike other mega projects in the Philippines At the very least this will have zero Or hopefully little to do with politicians But the most important question raised for the partnership As these two major conglomerates is Where are they actually going to get 3.5 billion dollars for 9 million dollars Capital expenditure alone 3.5 billion dollars after all is a massive amount of money Even Enrique Reison A Filipino billionaire who stands as the second richest man in the Philippines Is worth around 6.4 billion dollars according to Forbes Does this suggest that he is going to finance all of these by himself? Well it is not stated who is going to actually finance the project What is stated however is that it is almost a 50-50 project Between solar Philippines and prime infrastructures Which can suggest that the cost may also be divided between the two Solar Philippines however may also seem to be cash ready The company itself recently listed its stock on the public stock exchange around late 2021 Which helped the company raise about 1.3 billion pesos A further stock rates offering raised around late 2022 was also followed Which helped the company raise yet another 2.8 billion pesos And finally as of the latest quarterly report The company has about 6.1 billion pesos in total assets 3.5 billion pesos of which are current assets Plus it is also possible that the project can be taken out as alone But anyway as we are unsure where the total money is actually going to be taken from Or probably another fundraising scheme sometime in the future Do still let us know what you think about this project And even if you know where they are going to take the money from Thanks for watching If you know let us know in the comments down below Look it is super insightful video Very interesting and it is another proof that Philippines is on a very good path of You know becoming a really developed country And the changes that I have seen from the first time coming to the Philippines I think it was in 2017 to also living there For a substantial time and just I am still Than just seeing what is happening You know freaking Elon Musk sending satellite internet to the Philippines We have the biggest solar power We'll have in the Philippines So there is like a lot is happening Infrastructure is being built out I do understand that those people who see us for an example Investing in the Philippines is like oh you must be crazy Like it's such a corrupt country Blah blah blah But there must be a reason why people are building all of these things Right so I think it's on a very good way To it's glory right so if you enjoyed this video Do the thumbs up, subscribe if you're new And hit the notification bell for the next video It's coming out very very soon And also don't forget to check out my other channel Nellyslife Where I share a lot about my life in the Philippines My travels in the Philippines and around the world I have a travel blogger of course so yeah There was it sharing some good vibes with you guys I hope I'll see you next time here on What's up Philippines Bye bye
