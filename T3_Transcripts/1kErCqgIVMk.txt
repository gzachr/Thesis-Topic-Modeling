okay so some of you have asked for a house tour  
of uh our house here in the philippines 
try to get some a little bit better light  
there we go um yeah so i'm gonna just give you a 
quick tour nothing too in-depth but uh here we go
okay
try to reduce it down here okay there's the 
the top up on top we have the this whole  
middle section is just a stair column 
you'll see that then we've got a full  
upstairs patio area then the second floor
second floor is where we live and we've got 
a little balcony there and then the bottom  
floor is where my brother-in-law's and 
their families live so we'll get started
all right down there's a couple of little 
houses so all right let's get started
little gate got our initials on it  
there's the door to one brother-in-law's 
apartment or and the other one so
they'll open the door
and go up the steps you got 
these little lights that come on
those are nice at night
and then we thought it'd be 
nice to put in this glass block  
kind of so it's not so dark just like a concrete 
wall when you come up the steps you also got this
see i'm just opposite the steps here 
you get glass block all along here  
and then you turn and you walk this way
and you can look out we got screens on all 
the windows and there's the upstairs so  
we'll go up there in a minute i'm going to 
show you our living quarters where we live
this is our living room tv area we've got an 
air conditioner in case it gets too hot in here  
in the evening sometimes we'll turn it on not too 
often and then we've got screens on all the doors
in our little balcony we can look out
both ways we can look down if we see something 
going on my wife's beloved wind chimes
trying to shut the glass door
okay and we've got a
little dinette we bought 
here this last animal glass
glass dinette and
we've got a cat otherwise known as ming ming 
in our kitchen um we actually have granite  
countertops and uh cabinetry everywhere it is 
unfinished at this point we are going to finish  
it hopefully before we leave we got a really nice 
stove i'm not sure where she got that where do you  
know where she got it sm maybe i don't remember 
the brand seems like it's some sort of japanese  
fuji denzo okay bought me a coffee pot the 
other day because i couldn't deal with the  
the nescafe brands anymore or copycar or any of 
those brands so you can kind of see what the uh  
the glass block looks like from the inside in our 
living quarters on the second floor so come around  
through here we've actually got two doors that 
open up to the stairs so it's kind of an open air  
we wanted to keep it keep it all open and we've 
got a good utility closet again we're kind of in  
the process of doing some fish finishing 
so we've got plenty of storage area here
and then in here we call this 
we call this nani's room and
well can't really see there we go it's a picture 
of my mother-in-law she's actually passed away  
about three or four years ago and this 
was to be her room she never got to see it
so house was kind of built in memory 
of her dedicated to her you can see
this area here let me show you some 
like this door see how pretty that is  
that's what all this dry 
wood is going to look like
that's our plan is to get all this throughout 
the house finished like this we picked up a
varnish stain combination at ace hardware 
it's called it just says like i think it's  
it's the lightest color chestnut or something 
like that with a matte finish i don't like  
the slick finishes i like the matte finish 
and yeah so we've got tons of storage here
a little desk built in shelves i 
hope no dead bodies or anything  
fall out here i don't know what's in 
here yeah we've got tons of storage
more storage than we want or need and these couple 
little uh built-in side tables those are nice  
somebody really did a great job all of this stuff 
is is handmade the guy came over to the house  
we told him what we wanted and he built it so 
that's all handmade this bed is uh made out of  
steel steel tubing welded cut welded put together 
by hand it's got a nice mattress in there i  
personally picked out all the tile which i like it 
i'm glad i got it then we have the small bathroom
it's a typical filipino bathroom 
but we do have heated water  
if we need it draining the floor tile 
all the way up the walls small sink  
and toilet and we don't have a cabinet put in 
yet but we do have the wiring put in so all right  
and this is just an area kind of designated it 
for my office at some point just to pay bills to  
work on editing videos things like that cat 
he's getting around all right so walk into our  
bedroom and this is our master bath i i really 
liked that i couldn't that's one thing i couldn't  
wait to see was our master bath because they 
did a fine job on it they did an excellent job  
the toilet is a upgraded just a nice design 
the cabinets are really designed nice  
we even have the little switch there that turns 
on above there like a makeup light of some sort  
got a really good looking guy there 
he's doing all the videos for us  
and then the shower you know it's it's 
it's pretty standard got the water heater  
place to put everything i like things neat 
and orderly and then again this this door  
this is what all of our our woods are gonna look 
like in here and i just think that's beautiful  
really just a minimalist finish on it not too 
shiny and then we have these handmade little
end tables side tables bedside tables and 
we're going to finish those out i think i'm  
going to start on that today again this uh 
this bed is all steel steel frame handmade  
designed hand cut now see the steel steel 
legs and it's no box springs but tell you  
what these mattresses that we've got we're from 
you guys probably know mf uh some kind of foam  
company makes these mattresses i'm telling 
you what for a couple hundred dollars they  
are some of the best mattresses i've ever slept 
on in my life so i'll turn off the light there
i have lights everywhere all right so we've been 
to the kitchen already there's some of my wife's  
photography stuff that she's done
she's really good at decorating  
it's one of her paintings actually she does what's 
called acrylic pour all right let's go upstairs
really hot today got a fire 
extinguisher that's a must
sorry i'm trying to put my glasses back on here  
all right so we've got lighting 
all the way up through here
and these these stairs are all 
handmade hand cut and just designed  
by the metal worker that did it these 
windows were all put together piece by piece  
the guy did all of our windows all 
the same ones so we've got a screen
we've got nice tinted glass 
throughout the whole thing  
a storm door here for rain and then up here 
it's going to get a little warm if you're  
out in the sun the filipino sun is it's very 
unforgiving but you get about 4 30 out here  
at night i think i'll try to do a video 4 30 to 
5 o'clock until dark it's really beautiful out  
here the sun sets way back there in the east 
goes down behind those trees it's just kind of  
breezy up here you stand out here on the 
edge and it's just like standing on the  
titanic or something it's just the wind 
blows maybe a little upstairs uh cr up here
so
typical filipino bathroom all right and then 
in back we've got a built-in sink which we need  
to get our tile put in but you know it's it's 
functional um i had them build me a grill last  
time i was here i didn't have a grill so we got 
a again a filipino-style grill you'll see these  
like built like this on the street they'll sell 
east out esau which is like intestines on a stick  
who doesn't love intestines on a stick come 
on and then if we ever wanted to collect water  
rain water we've got it set up to where we can 
just put a tank here or something like that and  
collect water we've got a lot of plants back here 
my wife's growing several different types of of uh  
food plants vegetable plants and then 
she's got alekbati growing there alekbati  
over there syrup with uh mungo of course 
shimpuri and then all of our little starters so  
yeah and then somebody asked about the baha'i kubo 
there it is that was built up here it's it's funny  
how much does it cost to get a 
baha'i kubo built you might ask  
and uh not much because when we built the 
house we saved all the bamboo scaffolding  
and we paid a guy labor took him a few 
days probably five six hundred pesos a day  
and he built this for us first we 
paid him we got steps right here
got a nice floor
benches on the side we hang close sometimes 
outside so we've got that and we've got some  
hangers here but most of the time you can 
sit in here if there's any breeze at all  
you just sit down and just kind of relax
and catch any breeze that's out there so 
yeah got to buy behind kubo we got a grill  
we got the upstairs patio which in the 
evenings we spend a lot of time up here  
until the mosquitoes say it's 
time for us to go in then we go in  
i've really been fortunate on mosquito 
bites this time i bet i haven't been  
been bitten six or seven times maybe 
and then our our water tower we've got a  
pump downstairs good water pump and pressure 
tank so we pump the water up here to the top
i thought i'd throw in a 
little bit of grilling action  
actual uh footage of the fiesta just 
a little bit see how the upstairs  
operates and kind of how it works what 
it's like up here when we're grilling
hello
um
so that's it that's a tour of our house um 
again i didn't really want to go into the the uh  
two brothers houses downstairs they're nice neat 
and ordinary they're i mean orderly ordinary  
they're orderly uh they keep a really nice house 
it's not furnished like ours is uh as far as the  
the tile and the decorations and stuff they 
do their own thing and that's fine but uh  
yeah i enjoy enjoy being here why wouldn't i 
this is a dream this is was a dream you know  
the channel is called the philippines project 
and i almost have to close my eyes out here  
the channel is called the philippines project 
and this was definitely one of the projects  
so we get out of the sun so yeah this was 
built over about a year a year and a half  
probably at the most and then that's 
that's the the this top floor uh  
you know was put on ever all the concrete was 
done the plumbing electric everything was done  
we came back in 2019 we put down all this all this 
tile well we did we had somebody do it but we were  
here during all the tile installation pretty much 
all of it and you know so we went back uh in 2019  
we hadn't been we didn't come back to march of 
2022 march 17th we got in manila and so we've  
been here ever since and i'm going to go back to 
the united states at some point probably in june  
but i'm not trying to get in any hurry 
i'll tell you i'm enjoying my time here  
enjoying the philippines and right now we 
got some work going on downstairs in our  
on our floor we've got a a little bit of a water 
leak we got to chase down and it's different  
than america uh you got a water leak in america 
it starts tearing up a lot of stuff well here  
you gotta tear out concrete you know so that's 
kind of what we're dealing with but it's a  
slow leak we don't have to shut off our water or 
anything like that but both of my brothers-in-law  
they work construction full-time so you 
know it's pretty handy to have them around  
we pay them a little bit and they come 
up and they do whatever we need and  
you know we work together as a family you know 
so anyway that's my house tour if you have any  
questions about the construction or just have a
