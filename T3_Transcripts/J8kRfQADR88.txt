Okay, wait. For all Filipinos, I have a Tagalog question. Please help me.
Okay, so if you want to say, you are my friend, you can say, kaibigan kita.
And if you want to say, you are my wife, you would say, asawa kita.
Pero, if you want to say, you are my love, you cannot say, mahal kita.
You would say, ikaw ang mahal ko.
So, bakit?
You are my friend is kaibigan kita. You are my wife is asawa kita.
But if you say mahal kita, that does not mean you are my love. It means I love you.
So, bakit? I don't understand. Someone please explain in the comments.
