 Alright guys, I'm with Richie and as promised I'm gonna make her American meal and I asked him what they wanted and everyone said mac and cheese. So that's what we're gonna make today. We have the mac and cheese and Arnie is gonna be the camera girl, thank you. You can push that down if you need to. But so I got the cheese, the macaroni and some butter and some sugar. Lots of Filipinos like it sweet but we'll wait to add that later if they want it. And then some milk. So I guess we'll start with sliced cream cheese. I honestly don't really make this at home so my brother does and I watch him sometimes but I'm not much of a cook so I apologize if it doesn't taste very good but as long as I don't burn it I think it should be okay. Alright so I guess that was pretty much it. We have the butter or we have the milk and the macaroni and the cheese. We have the fire going over there. Yeah we're gonna boil it. So there really isn't much preparation but we'll go over and check on the fire. I see if it's time to add the water and then we need to boil it. And this is my definitely my first time cooking over fire like this so it should be interesting. Cookie mac and cheese on over fire. I cook other things over fire but never mac and cheese. Hey, you're doing good. Nice. Nice outfit. Where'd you come from? I slept there. You were sleeping you woke up like this? You're the most sweet of you. What happened to you? I like her. That's unique. Unique is right. Alright so I guess welcome Raymond. Thanks for joining us. I'm hungry. I don't need. I don't need. I don't need. I don't need. We'll check on the water. See if it's boiling. You can put it here. Alright it's boiling. Oh hey bro are you hungry? Yeah. Good. I think we're going to make enough for everybody. What's that? It's some we're going to make macaroni and cheese if you had it before. Oh not yet. Well today's your lucky day man. You don't want the macaroni you stick on the side so it's good to mix it up every once in a while. Stir it. Hal suggestions made. Hal suggestion made. It's falling. Okay no. Just got ready. Go. Go ahead. Good? Alright. That was good. I'll just put that leg on each. Um. I'll just put this to the side. Alright, so I think I'm going to cut these in smaller pieces. So it's easier to melt and stir around. I really don't know how much I need. I don't really measure, but I'll just kind of add if I need more as I go. You definitely don't want to burn the cheese, so I'm going to try my best to keep stirring it as it's on the fire. And this is cold right now, so I think it's best to keep it cold. And then once it's on there, you can stir it as it heats. And then what's next? And then we'll add some milk and some butter as you call it margarine. Margarine? Margarine. Margarine. Margarine. Margarine. Margarine. We call it margarine. Margarine in the US. Here is margarine. Margarine. Margarine. Margarine. Patanbo? Patanpando? Sa? Sa? Maso? And we just call it butter. It says margarine on the label. We just call it butter. Like butter is like the general butter on toast and jelly. Ah, engineering. Yeah. Hey, welcome to join us. How about the... Well, how about the... I think he's thinking first. How about the spiel one? Spiel to? Spiel to? Spiel port. Oh, okay, okay. Like the general, you love dinner? What do you mean? Okay, yeah. Something like that? All right. That's milk. All left. Right now, let me say it right. Here bro, only five pieces of fresh milk. What? Go to go to use your mouth. That's the best kind. Goat smoke is the best. I got to agree. When I'm at home, it's more expensive. But if I drink normal milk, I have to make sure it's lactose-free. Here's a lactose intolerant. That means I can't digest. Even cheese, apple, upset stomach. So that's like the only thing that's upset my stomach is like cheese. I eat too much of it. I think it will. High piece was one less. All right. You'll use your mouth to get the milk. Oh, you have to show me that. I like to try. You just put a little bit of butter. Margarine. What about using spoon? You don't need a lot of butter. To make it more smooth, it's nice to have a little bit of butter. Or margarine, sorry. All right. So we'll mix this in slowly. If we need more cheese, we'll add more cheese. If we need more, or anything else, what is added as we go? We'll go put this over the fire and stir a lot. You definitely don't want to over-cook the butter and the cheese and everything. I should be good enough. I think your tape's coming on, Doug. I think you're sweating. Your tape's coming on, Doug. It's okay. For the kids at home, you're going to keep those covered. Hey, how are you? Try to laugh like Raymond. All right. Like this. No. You said you'd have too much butter in your house. It's all about the presidential elections and the newonderev�e you do. This is for me. And with that, Iungenek. The inappropriate thing, if you'll explain it or not. If you point a lot of things, we're going to continue. What gets gravit금 and свет is the problem. This incline kind of has found the effect. Just the way you think. All right? Whitefrom the sea. Oh, a lot, a lot of ho! It was so fun. My favorite, my favorite one is when you laugh, you go, and the last one you go, woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Ah! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Yeah, that's my favorite one you need to do that. When you get some milk on your tongue. Mmm! Yeah, that's looking good. Is it good with coke? Yeah. You can drink with anything. My favorite drink in the world is ginger... Ginger ale. What's that? Ginger ale. Similar to the Rayman's ginger? A little bit, yeah. That's like the ginger juice. It's like tea? The all-natural kind, yeah. Ginger, ginger. Ha-ha-ha! I like the female gender. Is that all of it? The whole thing? Yeah. Yeah, I think we'll just use it off. The more cheese the better, in my opinion. How about milk? I got some milk here, don't I? Yeah, here, here, here. Don't worry, my milk. That's... I don't want chocolate milk. What's that? No minutes, no. No minutes. Two minutes? Yeah. Let's see if we can do it for two minutes long. Ready? One, two, three, go! Every scene, dumb and dumb, er. No. Alright, what did it to me? I want to hear the most annoying sound in the world. Guys. Oh, who's that? You're seeing dumb, er. You're seeing dumb, er.

I think you need some black tape. What? It's a black tape, but a black tape, but it would be nice. What is this? It's a back and cheese for everyone. Cheese? Yeah. If you want, you can add some salt. You can add some sugar. You can solve some pepper. You have pepper? Like not pepper. You put pepper up the tree with salt and pepper. Mm-hmm. No. Okay.
