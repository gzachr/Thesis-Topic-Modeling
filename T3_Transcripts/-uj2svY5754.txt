 York City Time forOU! I on-happle on my friends so stays a day we've been in our house for six months can you believe can you believe six months six months six months is crazy it's gone so quickly so today we are talking about our Philippines budget want to show you guys how much we spend every month yes before we left for the Philippines we made a budget this was our estimated budget we didn't know how realistic it was going to be but we've been here for six months in our house we've collated the data we've recorded every penny we spend and I don't know not penny so so what do you think of it? I don't know in England anymore so we're from the UK we still look at things in the value of pounds and pence but we're in the Philippines now so we're going to put everything on screen in pesos with a conversion to great British pounds so when we're in England we have no idea of our budget it was going to be realistic but we did a lot of research and we thought we could stick to it we've got six months figures we recorded everything we spent every peso we spent and we're going to go through it with you now we're going to share our budget of living in the Philippines as a family of three so just a little disclaimer in our budget we don't include any of the cost of the house building that'd be a different video completely we have money put aside for the house and this is our day-to-day cost of living monthly expenses things like food transport utilities internet etc etc so we moved to the Philippines yeah so we moved to the Philippines on June June 2021 we moved into our house in September 2021 three months later it wasn't finished was it as you might remember from the early of logger and they walked on our first day that was interesting that was that was the challenge but we've got through that there are a lot of obstacles along the way but we're settled now pretty much finished with the house just a garden a little bit more inside decoration here and there practically it's finished it's done so what we tried to do before we left is make a budget based on what we were spending in the UK what we won't need to spend in the Philippines and what we will need to spend in the Philippines some of these things are optional some of these things are essential and some of these things are variable in that you can change or choose how much you want to spend on them so the first thing the house vent mortgage our budget was zero and after six months of living I'm happy to say it's still zero we spent nothing at all in vent or mortgages the house is owned out right we have no mortgage we have no debt associated with it so that's a big relief really isn't it if you have money borrowed against the house the biggest worry is can you afford to keep paying this debt back this money back luckily we don't have that one of the main reasons for moving to the Philippines for us is we swap that in the UK we had a house we had a mortgage too we moved here to a house that we own out right and we don't have any money we have to spend on that obviously we do have upkeep of the house but we have savings put aside for that so in the UK you have something called council tax there isn't any of that in the Philippines but you do have a land tax when you own land and property yeah are you still paying for tax monthly or you can pay it yearly as well if you want yep we've put on our budget the monthly cost but we do pay this annually and happy to say that our budget was 250 pesos a month we put it aside 250 pesos a month it's due to be paid anytime now but that's it really we're on budget that's a good start it's cold now if it would be a win buying us it's not cold there's no rain as you can see we've had loads of rain the last six days or so we've not been able to go and do anything at all so we thought we'd make a video today we go for our budget it's exactly six months anyway so we're in a good position to do so to be able to do this we recorded everything we'd spent kept a spreadsheet day by day week by week month by month we updated it we recorded it we adjusted our budget where we needed to but we were quite surprised with the results you might be too so we're coming to the next one which is water now if you have a property you can have a water supply as here like the UK we have a water supply it's a means fed water comes in off the street comes into our system and we have a responsibility for all the pipe work on our system you might not know that you have a responsibility for all the pipe work from the main road also as we found out as you do get leaks from time to time but we've bought a few confession joints so what's called coupling yeah coupling yeah we bought confession couplings and it's a case of going out finding a leak splitting the pipe and fixing it it's quite common when you live in the Philippines to have a leak the pipes are used they're not buried and they're not great quality to be honest they do split quite often and quite easily but batter our water so we allocated 900 pesos a month is that too high? it's at the budget we that's what we said is a budget before we came before we came yeah that was too high yeah that was equivalent of around 15 UK pounds now in the UK our water cost was around 35 pounds a month so we fought with knocking half just under half 15 pounds so we've actually spent on average a hundred and thirty pesos a month which is about two UK pounds so that's very reasonable very reasonable well under budget luckily this is just a means water drinking water will come on so that's in our food budget but we've very surprised with the water here we've got a great water pressure really high powerful when there's a leak now and then it never drops we don't use our water pump all the time only if there is like water leak like the water is slow yeah you know if it only if it ever drops really but it never drops and that's as a leak even with other houses here it's never been low enough that it's had to come on so anyone has been a outright leak it's had to come on that's obviously affected our electricity from time to time over the six months but we're in a position where we think we're on top of it we can resolve it quite quick and quite easy because I've got our hands dirty a little bit but the water here is very reasonable in cost I wouldn't say it's clean you can drink it some people the local people drink it but because we're not used to it so we have to buy our own water for drinking but you can drink it if you get a filter system in place which we're going to look into doing it would save us a little bit of money along the way clean up the water so the next one gas in the UK we use gas for cooking and for heating you don't need heating in Philippines though it's hot enough so we allocated a budget of 900 pesos a month now the only gas we use is for cooking quite often we do cook outside using charcoal and wood but our gas comes from gas canisters and they cost 1,540 pesos every two months it's pretty much bang on every two months we change the gas canister so in terms of the cost it's 520 pesos a month which is around Â£7.45 so it's not bad not bad for cooking we don't always need it but it's always handy to have sometimes when it's raining or when it's cold outside there I say in the UK the gas costs we were spending 40 pounds a month before we left now that was mainly for heating though I imagine the cooking costs are pretty much the same the cost of living is going up everywhere especially energy costs in the UK for maple they're going to really rock it almost as much as 50% higher and it's a problem around the world at the moment energy costs are going up so in the Philippines we're quite lucky really they have different sources of fuel we can use for cooking we don't have to rely on gas and it does last us a couple of months probably a bit longer when we start cooking a bit more outside you can do cooking outside you can beat a barbecue so the next one probably one of the most expensive bills you're going to have is the electricity now we have a house here with five bedrooms it's quite a big house it's just a three of us here but we do use fans we use TVs internet we use the other and the washing machine the fridge the water dispenser quite a lot really we try to save it where we can try to be as resourceful as we can we don't use our condition no no because that will cost too much far too much so it's quite nice here it's quite windy we don't need an air condition right now we have no fan on us no air conditioning just a breeze coming up from behind and to the side and it's perfect no towel no sweat yeah normally let's see that I promise I'm trying we're not pretending we don't need air conditioning here no we don't we have the summer months coming up so that'll be a challenge however we've been here nine months now in the Philippines and so far we haven't needed the air conditioning at all sometimes you don't even turn the ceiling fans on just open a window and that's all you need exactly but again back to the electricity we budgeted 2500 pesos a month we have actually gone over budget on this one we've gone over over the six months on average by 175 pesos so 2675 pesos now this is as we said quite a large house we do have a lot of electrical appliances and we have quite a lot of lights we try to save money where we can by not using them however it's not always easy but to put it into perspective in the UK we had a free bedroom house much much smaller than this where we were spending 50 pounds a month on electricity here we're spending around 38.73 even though this house is much bigger we are spending less on electricity here we have a free bedroom house next topic is visas I we're not going to go into too much detail with this one we cover this at a later date but our budget was one five and four hundred sixty six and we've spent on average nine hundred thirty pesos a month which is around 13 pounds 55 pence if you're like me and you're in need of visual aid then you mainly glasses or contact lenses I bought some glasses before we came to the Philippines and believe it or not my site has changed yet again in the short time we've been here so I probably need a week of prescription draining Isabella are both lucky don't need glasses or contact lenses but I do need contact lenses and I allocated six hundred sixty five pesos a month for that I spent nothing in six months mainly because before we came to the Philippines I bought a year supply with us but I've done some research and six six five a month is a realistic cost so that should be on budget so next topic mobile phones he used a lot of mobile phones he used a lot so that's why he spent too much money yeah we can cut this back we really could you always have data every time yeah I always make sure I always make sure I have data on my phone so that if we're out and about I can always contact somebody or connect the internet or look something up if needed but we do buy a package every week for us so our budget for mobile phones was seven hundred eighty pesos a month and we've stuck to this because we've got research before we came here we looked at all the packages available and they haven't changed so the load that we put on each week for draining myself is the same we didn't always use it but we've averaged it out we've gone with a worst case scenario so this works out to be around eleven pounds thirty okay so food the big one so our budget for this was nine thousand pesos a month we didn't stick to it we actually went over budget on this by quite a bit we didn't know what the prices were going to be like before we got here and to our surprise which we will share with you in upcoming videos the cost of living has gone up quite dramatically in the last couple of years here since we were here anyway in 2018 it's still affordable it's still manageable and if you're smart with what you buy then you can still live here on a reasonable budget on average we spent fifteen thousand one hundred and twenty five pesos a month so about six thousand pesos above our budget and we haven't restricted ourselves to what we buy we could do we could cut some stuff out and we're going to start doing that trying to clean up our diet a bit when you come to the Philippines as a foreigner you're not sure if you like the food you do try it you do tend to stick to what you know and what you like I'm going to try to explore a bit more in upcoming months eat a bit differently bit cleaner bit healthier we're going to buy more from the market rather than the supermarket as the cost do vary and we show you that there's a dramatic there's a drastic difference in cost between the supermarket and the market and even the vendors from the side of the road a drastic difference in price on what they sell what the market sells so what we've spent is equivalent of two hundred eighteen pounds ninety five approximately and this may sound a lot but we are family of three this does include the dogs as well dog food which we hadn't originally budgeted for this also covers our drinking water which is twenty five pesos for five gallon we tend to go through two or three a week and we've not really restricted ourselves but in the UK our food budget was three hundred and fifty pounds a month so even though we spent more than our budget we're still quite a lot under what we were spending in England in the UK and there are lots of options not as many as England I have to admit but if you look around you can get pretty much what you want just be careful the prices though don't stick to what you love to eat all the time because if you do that you won't stick to your budget now we allocated two thousand pesos a month for this we're well under budget one thousand and ninety five pesos a month which is around fifteen pounds eighty six in the UK we were spending around twenty five pounds a month on this so again we're under budget cleaning products including things like toilet rolls kitchen rolls now you don't have to have toilet roll we've got two b days in the house which to be honest I've never used geniuses them do I don't if you like the spray you do use it a lot actually I will start using the bidet a bit more there's cost of toilet roll here it's pretty much the same as the UK though but you can save a bit of money eight hundred and thirty nine pesos so we're under budget we could stroke it back a bit further if we need to okay so the next one is another optional you may not need this if you don't have kids even if you have kids you might not need this but we send in the purchase of private school it's our choice as we want to have a good education nothing against the public schools here but we just thought a private school might be better for her a bit easier a few more English speaking students and it might make the adjustment a little bit easier yeah so this one is optional completely optional so we're pretty much on budget on this we budgeted two seven two nine and we spent two seven nine eight so only slightly more it's very similar of course this one will go up year by year so we will have to keep refining our budget every year but it won't be forever after a few years this one will go it might get replaced with something else so transport now we bought a car when we came to the Philippines this was not in our budget the cost of this was out of savings we had it set aside and obviously with a car there is some maintenance from time to time that is also set aside not for a month so this is just really the fuel costs and if we were to get any jeeps or trikes or jeep needs or anything like that we set aside two thousand pesos and we've stuck to it so this is approximately 28 pound 96 a month in the UK you were spending around 50 pounds a month on fuel so it's much less although the costs are going up for fuel as in as I'm sure you're aware everywhere in the world but we can still make it work out unnecessary trips yeah so if we need to go right we make sure we have two or three things to do we're allowed to go every day and just do some random random task random task often powers plus go on you don't like driving in the city as well because it's really busy it's getting busier now we're getting back to normal here in all moc we have a private septic tank on our lands which we all need to be pumped out every so often we haven't spent any money on this so so far zero but we're put in 250 pesos a month for side for this which is what we budgeted so when the time comes we're going to fall to pump it out so the last one is our other category which includes e-tunnel we allocated two thousand hundred and thirty free pesos a month but under budget for six months two thousand nine hundred so slightly under budget on this one and it is an option obviously living in the Philippines there's lots of great places to go and eat lots of great food to try but you don't need to do it every day it didn't eat it every week no quite enjoy staying at home and cooking ourselves but it is nice to go out now and then yeah so our original budget was 31,423 pesos a month so what we have actually spent on average 33,403 pesos a month this was low our original budget was based on five hundred UK pounds a month on an exchange rate of 62.5% so what we did is transfer money to the Philippines from the UK and we managed to transfer at a rate of 69.08 so much higher than 62.5 so what has happened even though we're almost two thousand pesos above our budget due to the exchange rate we're around 16 pounds a month under our budget if that makes sense yeah that's it makes sense so even though our peso amount is over our pound amount is under so the exchange rate we used will be consistent for the next 12 months so we've locked it in place so even though we can go over slightly on our peso amount we're still going to be under on our pound amount and we don't have any health care as such built into our budget but we do have savings and also any money that we don't spend each month we've been saving separately to cover things like this so that's our six month average monthly cost of living here in the Philippines pretty much on budget obviously you can spend money really quickly really easily but if you're quite content to live a normal life go out now and then treat yourselves now and then then your money will go a very long way we're family free living in a new house and we're sticking to our budget so in the UK we were spending on average one five hundred five hundred pounds a month we have no we have no worry about mortgages or then so what we do in upcoming videos is show you the cost to live in here in the Philippines in Omox city Philippines is now open for foreign tourists so there's land for sale there's lots of land here for sale lots of houses and we're going to show you in our last video we showed you a lot of land for sale admittedly it wasn't the cheapest possibly not the best value just an example of what you can get this is a very sought after location where we are but there's a lot of great places in the Philippines and we want to discover them as well show you all the land available the house is available give me an idea of how far your money will go in the Philippines thank you very much for watching thanks for subscribing thanks for all your comments and your feedback now if you want us to do any videos in particular crop us a comment there's any costs here that you want to know any types of land you're looking for any businesses you're looking for let us know we're going to go out and about a lot more
