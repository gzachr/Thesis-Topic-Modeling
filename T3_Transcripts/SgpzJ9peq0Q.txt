 with your Friday. The freshest. Okay, so after we did that really cool, it ridiculously inspired video of Filipino singers that went viral on YouTube, we have been swamped by requests to watch talented singers, Yena Pinoi singers in Moves, you know, chilling karaoke, just because karaoke machines are literally everywhere, even in the mall. That is so cool. So that seems to be the natural progression of this, like people, like that kind of like, this is like one of those videos I get recommended after you watch the viral moment. Yeah. So this is interesting. So let's give this a watch. I mean, I remember in Venezuela, a lot of TV shops would have a karaoke on and a lot of ones that were portray a showcase in the sound system. They would put, they would put, they would put music on. Like, you remember the telecom shops, they would just put like music videos and stuff. Dude, I remember maybe, unless they were making you try out like the speakers, the mics. So, but it's obviously not as often as this. And nobody would actually stand up and take the microphone and sing karaoke. But at least not for real. You know what I mean? I mean, I'm going to mess around. One, two, three, all the way. Yeah. Who is there? Let's see, let's watch. Let's see. He's the chop, the heat works in the chop. Oh, he works in the chop? So, I can look at it a little, a little medium, just walking around. Oh, and it records him as well. Everyone just loves singing that, right? Barato at wa la. Trombone, that means trombone. I look small like an art, too. Oh, good. Oh, they like set it up for her. She's got a Pokemon backpack, she wasn't ready to sing. She was ready, dude. She's not there, she's not going that far, she's in a concert over her own. I'm going to sing a little bit more. Little feedback. That's great. Bravo. Dude, she needs to sell tickets. I pay, yeah, I'll pay. I pay. Tell me where to put my... ...my mother. You need to be... Bro, I need to... ...subscribe to my channel. I'm gonna have a superman show, I like it. Yeah, take my backpack out. Where do I buy tickets for this girl? Where can I see her perform? Where is it, lady? By shopping mall or that, where the supermarket? You're gonna paid her to do that. Oh, or like, yeah. If you want to watch this, they put five quid in there or ten quid or whatever. 15 quid. That is so crazy, dude. That's a full price ticket, that is a total... That is a completely full show, really. She actually doesn't even need to rehearse. She just knows it's all rack. Just seeing a people who's even if it's in prom tour, whatever I would pay. She's good enough for that. I want to know her name. Does anyone know her name? That is crazy, let me see, let me see, let's go take a picture. Oh, which by the way, some are exciting. Feel of you guys have sent me through a full list of the names of the people that we watched in the... ...viral video. How amazing! So, some of them have YouTube channels and we're gonna check it out, yeah, throughout the week. And some of them don't and no one knows where they are. But there's a few. Actually, one of them, I think, is killing it. Just in Vaskis. You've actually seen him once on the channel with Michael. He's the guy that sang with the little twerp. Oh, really? He's the little twerp. The little mini creature that was... Lovely, lovely... Related energy. They had the... He's killing it. He's got like over a million subscribers on YouTube. Yes, let's go! Murdering, he sings like a... He does an omigal... You know, the... Yeah, yeah. Omigal, father. It's like a website where you get... It's like a FaceTime website. It's a random... People find her basically. So, you talk to... Your webcam would random people on the internet. And the software of the website matches you up with random people from around the world. And he sings to them online. It's not for money, it's just for entertainment. And he posts it on YouTube. He goes, yeah, he does... It goes, it goes really well. So, he's been very clever obviously since that moment. I don't know if he was actually big before that, because he was very young at that point. But anyways, yeah, so do watch out on the week we're gonna check out some of those guys. Cool, let's see. I know you have a lot of... Mopping the floor. She loves that noise. She enjoys the little dance. I can dance. The way I love it is... Whoo! Boys! She's coming into her skin now. Yeah. I was gonna say she was way too confident. Yeah, she chose the heart of her. Yeah, the key change was way too simple for her. That resonance. Ooh, she's got it, dude. More? Yeah, then. Yeah. Yeah. Chillin' chillin'. . Hahahaha hello everybodys RO! Hi�� WAYOO ALL GO existence I want to know who they are. I want to know the name. I want to talk to her. I want to support her on social media. Look at the lights. It's just crazy that the environment is so hostile. Everything is so hostile. The people, the sound, what they're getting back from the speakers, those microphones that are trash, they're a huge reverb with literally no definition of the high-summit or lows and anything. They also have that cheap reverb on their label. And the plosives are so close, they saturate the mic and everything is just so atrociously bad. But them. They managed to. How do they manage to be so damn deep? That's probably how you can tell them they probably own a karaoke machine themselves or they're familiar with karaoke machines. Because they work the same way. They have those flaws. They can please some manage those flaws. It's the charm of it though. That's the charm of going to karaoke. You know you're getting the crappy mic with horrible plosives. It's fun because you're doing it for fun. You're not supposed to sound as good. These guys are used to this. These ladies are obviously used to this. They know how to pull away in the plosives. I think the only person that saturates the music is the music and the beginning. But these ladies obviously know how to sing. It's crazy. It's like a uniform song. It's a young, she could be a school. I think she is. I can't help. She is familiar with the a-go. But the part is charging her. Yeah, she's familiar with the equipment, with the fuck. Shut up. That is mad. It's crazy. I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it. I'm not going to be able to do it. That is mad. It's crazy. Here's the thing. I've heard plenty of versions of this song. So many, so many, with so many more resources than this. And they all sound so exhausting. They all sound like, you know, you're putting in the effort. Was it the terminology used? The grabbing the ground. Yeah, it's just string. They're just grabbing onto the notes. There's a lot of saturation in the larynx that pushing through too much air, and the song is so demanding. And it's natural because it's a very difficult song. But in this case, this is like a walk in the park. That's a hard song, even for Sia to sing live. That is right. It's a rough song for Sia to sing live. And then there is this girl chilling with a bad microphone in the middle of a very crowded mall doing it for fun. Yeah, but so... The thing is, you have a world-class talent. You don't have a world-class product yet. It doesn't have the market in the behind. It's tough. It was a talent. And most importantly, I think the interesting thing is, you have someone who's calm during the storm. That's a skill and a half. Yes, that is a skill. And that's also a skill that I don't know if this... I hope she becomes famous. Actually, I don't hope she becomes famous. She lives off of her talent. No, I hope she gets to do what she wants to truly do and to the maximum. Because she might not be singing. She might not be singing. She might want to be a doctor. And fame... And go for it. And fame is really not a pursuit, a worth pursuit. But being able to touch people with your music and living off of your music and sharing your music, that's a more worth pursuit, it seems. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing.

I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing.

I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. You know there's one idea of Scouts, right? That is a trade that even once you start, It's difficult to crack. Like, even when you spend years on it, This is a very natural skill and it's very hard. She might be most impressive We've seen 9 It's got bright posture, great. Fantastic, post-poster, lovely modulation. Look at the anchoring. Those full set-ups are beautiful. The whole thing is all over the world. The whole thing is all over the world. The whole thing is all over the world. We're walking around like a holiday. The whole thing is all over the world. Woohoo! Yes, she's young. I think she is wearing a school uniform. And she's unbuttored by all that craziness. I want to know if she's a one-of-one or not. That is such a solid performance. We'll have to stop to watch her. There's no even inside a short, that sounds so good. I just have a volume. I just have a volume. Oh, hell yeah, we're gonna listen. Please, somebody I wish you could be me. Oh my gosh. Oh my god, look. That's nice. That's nice. Gosh. Woohoo! Woohoo! I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna do it. Oh my god. I'm gonna leave it. I'm gonna die. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna move to the future.
