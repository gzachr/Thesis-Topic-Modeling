 What's up guys, my name is Miles and my name is Fez and this is the commodity and today we're reacting to Spectacular skyline of Metro Manila, Philippines, 2021. You guys have requested this and a few different Philippines videos. So we wanted to check it out and just based off of this first few that we get, it's beautiful. Yeah, it looks so. It looks crazy big actually. Yeah. Because it's not so much the stuff that's in the foreground. It's a lot of stuff that's in the back. Yeah, there's a bunch of stuff back there. Yeah. So let's go ahead and hop in and check this out. Before we do that, please if you enjoy the video, please hit the subscribe button and also hit the thumbs up by the notification. Hit everything. Just start clicking. It's up for your phone because you don't want to crack your screen. Yeah. Metro Manila. That is some cool shaped buildings. It's like little cubes. Yeah. That is interesting and they're really deep. Yeah. It's like Legos. Yeah, it's really weird and then you have like little places for people to like the balconies and stuff. Yeah, that's dope. And that's a cool building. This one right here. Yes. Most of these buildings are actually on that as well. Yeah. That one right there. Yeah. And on the side. Yeah. Aspire. Aspire. That's gorgeous. Yeah, that's really cool. The diversity in downtown area. Yeah. The medical city. Wow. That's a cool building. On the right. Yeah. A gold building. Yeah. It's like smack that between all these blue windows. Wow. Sticks out. Look at all that. That glass is beautiful. On all of them. Yeah. That's kind of funny seeing that on the very top. Yeah. It looks like it should be on it's like kind of it's on its own. Yeah. Jolly Beach Tower. Did you see that? Yeah. I saw that. That's crazy. And they're building these. That huge city. Yeah. It is. What kind of court is that? Is that even a court? I don't think that's a court. It looks kind of like just like art. It looks like fountains. Yeah. Or I could be I could be way wrong. Let us know what that is. It might be because back here it looks like a stadium of some sort. Yeah. Let us know what that is. Yeah. Definitely. Yeah. Was it part of the golf course? I don't know. You got all the shipping containers over there. You report and everything. It's crazy how close it is to some of the homes. Yeah. It's so compact. It is. And it looks very busy. It's a cold post office? Yeah. Hope. I don't see any pools unless that's a pool at the bottom right. Right there. Kind of looks like it. But I don't see any rooftop pools and that's my favorite. Now I'm just looking for them. Yeah. But why need a pool when you're literally right next to this? Yeah. I know. I agree. But be cool to have one. Yeah. I agree. Especially at night time if you don't want to go swim in the ocean. Not have any idea what's underneath you. Oh wow. Don't. I love lighting. And I like how it changed with the music like drastic. That's cool. However, if we keep copyright issues I will be changing this music. Yeah. So you might not even know if it changed with the music. Yeah. That building in the middle is dope. The way that one. Yeah. That is awesome. That is really awesome. I just saw that. This is gorgeous. I had no idea. We reacted to Manila before. And we didn't see the stuff. We might have watched an older video. Maybe. This is insane. Yeah. There's so many sky rises. Towers. Build a high. Oh. Hi rises. Hi rises. Or yeah. Sky. Sky. Sky. Yes. That's the word. I was like what word am I looking for? Sky scraper. What makes a skyscraper a skyscraper? Like is it like over 20 stories or something like that? I don't know. I think they just call it that when they're tall. Yeah. Scrapes the sky. Well, I mean, I know I get the concept of the name. I'm just kind of curious like if there's like a legitimate title because these are all definitely skyscrapers. Yeah. In my personal opinion. I like how that going. They're sloped up. Okay. So. Let's see here. Hold on. Did you see that? What do you tell me to hold on for? I'm not touching anything. There's like a whole TV like right here. Yeah. There was one on another building too. And then it looks like that's a field of some sort. I don't think it is. What is that? Maybe a put put. But it's crazy looking. But there's no guard rails. No, it'd be so. It's like I got it. And then a helipad right there. I bet you that's some type of medical. I've seen a few helipads. Yeah, yeah. There's been a lot of them. Because I've been looking for swimming pools. Yeah. This is. That was really cool. Look at that. Yeah. Yeah. And they're cute. And they're cute. That's got. American Express. Whoa. Look at that building on the left. Right here. Yeah. Is that the W? I don't know. But look at that wall. How it like slopes out. Yeah. That's kind of cool. Yeah. Helipad over here. Of course, a lot of these buildings have them. Yeah. I'm guessing that both of these probably are. The owners of the buildings have to park up there. There's one down there. Yeah. Same one. One right there. And up there. Of course, some of these are possibly hospitals as well. Yeah. You got to get those med facts in there. So gorgeous. After seeing this, it's easy to believe that it's as populated as it is. Yeah. Because there's so much. And a lot of these look like residential. Yeah. Like I would put money that like some of these are like that one. Yeah. Moving so fast. That's what is that? I'm guessing some type of monument. For I bet you probably something for World War II is my guess. Possibly, yeah. That's real cool. I've seen this section. I bet you these buildings are so tall. They just look so small between all these. Oracle. I think Oracle is moving their corporate to Austin. Really? Yeah. From the North California. It's crazy to how drones make things look so much smaller. And how it makes it look so cinematic. That's a cool building. That's a pocket out of the one. The spotted one. Most of these buildings are super cool. Just the different designs and the way they turned the glass into art. I get every, yeah. Every aspect of it. I'm glad this video was recommended to us. I like this. I love looking at buildings. There's something about it. Downtown. It sounds so dumb too. I love looking at buildings. But it's like I do too. Well, there's a whole group of people that do. It's called architectures. Architectures. Architectures. What's the right word? Architects. Architects. I was like, it's out. Architectures. I'm so weird in my head. I'm like, architect. And like, architecture is the actual like. Architects. Architect. It's a weird word. Yeah. You keep on saying it out. Architect. At least the traffic's moving. Do you all have casinos? Good question. How about they do? I would think that they do. I think every country should. People are going to gamble one way or the other. I don't care where you live. At least make the country make money on it. That's awesome. Yeah. Thank you for watching. No, thank you for creating. Yes. But you're welcome. Yeah. No, yeah. That was super awesome. Super beautiful. I wish it would have shown more night time. Yeah, because the lighting stuff. Yeah, I agree. Yeah, we reacted to a Manila, I believe, already. And I don't remember any of this. Yeah, I don't either. I don't, I'm trying to think because we did do Manila. But it was nothing like this is heads. I can't think today. This is heads different. Like, like better. Like, yeah, it's so much better. I cannot even think of what the words I'm trying to look for today. This was super awesome. Guys, if you have any other cities in the Philippines, you'd like us to react to or wherever you are. If you're not in the Philippines, if you'd like us to react to your city, throw them down in the comments section. There's also a link to our discord in the description. So join our discord chat with everybody. Make some friends. We've got a lot of people in there that that have created friendships Oh, yeah, out of our discord. And we think that's truly awesome. But there's also a section two recommend videos to us. So that's usually where we look for videos. Absolutely. It's also the easiest way to get them in front of us because it gives the thumbnail and like a little detail to it. And going through the comments, we get probably a thousand a day. But it's hard to get through with having said that every video that we're going to react to for the next two days, I've gotten out of the comments. Okay. So your mileage may vary. So with that being said, my name is Miles and my name is Fez. Thanks for watching guys. Peace out.
