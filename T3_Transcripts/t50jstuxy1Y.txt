we're lloyd and mandy we're digital 
nomads currently traveling the world  
in search of somewhere we can call our 
home base we've been on the island of  
charge in the philippines for the past 
few weeks and today you're joining us in  
manila where we plan on experiencing this 
crazy city in the most local way possible
with you
and i never
all right so we're spending the weekend in manila  
we spoke about the american influence 
here and we've just stumbled across this  
american diner which is across the road from our 
hotel and tonight we're going to a basketball game  
a filipino playoff basketball game i didn't 
realize before coming in how big basketball  
was but after speaking to some locals and doing 
their research it's the number one sport here  
and we managed to be here when there's a 
couple of big games on so i thought why not  
tickets were really cheap we got vip box 
seats like second row second level first row  
for ten dollars each so i don't know what 
to expect how many people are gonna be there  
but we're pretty excited this is the coolest 
diner we've been to in ages it really reminds  
me of when i used to go on trips to america 
with my family it really feels like that  
it's so cool coldest beer we've had in the 
philippines my speaker's an american diner  
usually when we travel um i get hungry but andy's 
angry today she didn't eat enough breakfast
i'm hungry and i feel like i can't even 
spring a sentence together right now  
and i'm saying a lot of stupid things by me

the video that burger was so good i ate it way too 
quickly we just grabbed a taxi we are on our way  
to the stadium now it's about 45 minutes away but 
i'm so excited this is my first basketball game
so i'm not totally sure yet but 
from what i can gather it's playoffs  
and it's a double header so there's one game 
on it three and another game on at five it's  
about four o'clock so we're going to only catch 
the second game but i don't know if it's the  
playoffs it should be a pretty good atmosphere 
hopefully it's a full house it's friday night
manila traffic is
at least we're going
okay we made it 20 minutes late but we made it 
here and it seems like a lot of other people  
are still coming in so um it's really 
nice in here i can smell popcorn already
is so fun  
can i get my ticket open sorry
we don't know where we're sitting um tickets 
aren't working now that we just scanned them  
so hopefully we can figure out where 
we're meant to be okay lloyd's got it  
section 200. one c 13. what's 
section 200 can we ask someone
okay when lloyd said we were coming 
here i was expecting it being like  
sort of like a high school setup i was not sure 
what i was really expecting i was not expecting  
this nice of a like stadium it's beautiful 
in here one of each yeah yeah both okay third  
one we have to transfer in a plastic cap okay 
okay with ice no ice please got my new handbag
floyd's got the beers
we're ready for a good basketball game 
all the ingredients to a perfect night  
but you say so myself this is 
awesome they've got taco bell here  
they've got dairy queen 
not sure what else you need
approaching the hot sauce
the super fans they've all 
got a t-shirt on mandy wants  
it's one goal to get a t-shirt here this game 
is sick this is so fun the popcorn's unreal
so i'll probably butcher these 
names but the two teams playing  
tnt tropping giga and the magnolia 
chicken tim plato's hot shots which  
they both they're both named after businesses 
all the teams are owned by corporations
it's happening
i started so much food i got chicken and 
spaghetti and a champ burger and i got you  
a chicken sandwich and jolly spaghetti  
and we got a mini sundae each yay a nice tea 
yeah and a little jolly robot gonna bring it over
when we first got to manila and i saw this 
place i knew i recognized it somewhere and then  
we realized we'd seen it on anthony bourdain when 
he came to manila this was the first place he came  
i haven't rewatched that episode but it's pretty 
funny that he came to a fast food joint um  
i think this is like filipino favorite they talk 
it up so much um so far it seems pretty cool
honey it's never coming
i've been waiting for like 20 minutes so hungry
and he decided to uh unpack her bag 
before we left so now i'm hungry
the kids love it  
good friend here yeah looks 
like there's four of us
okay fast food spaghetti it smells unreal actually  
we got here burger oh that's huge i thought it 
was gonna be a tiny little burger it's massive  
you got way too much food that's right i wanted to 
take some home we're skipping on yeah not really
um so not healthy and i don't mind
these little girls are so cute they love 
it don't worry about the entertaining yeah
i like that it has cheese on it
cheese red
it's really good i didn't expect to be 
that good it's so good what the hell  
what am i eating looks pretty bloody good
you might have to try it it's like  
it's not like anything else it's 
not just chicken and cheese isn't it  
yeah but it sort of almost has like a pickled 
flavor to it i can't explain it very good sauce
yeah i don't know what's in this chamber i
it's got a bit of everything lettuce tomato
okay
okay that spaghetti was pretty good we're pretty 
full but now we're just adventuring around this  
massive shopping center they have the craziest 
shopping malls in the philippines i did learn  
that they love the shopping malls because of 
the air conditioning which makes a lot of sense  
because it's very hot we're gonna go see if we 
can find some books and some things to make our  
upcoming flight a bit more comfortable in the 
next video we'll share where we're heading off  
and why but uh yeah i'm gonna do some running 
around alright we made it back to our hotel  
uh after about an hour of shopping that's enough 
for us i think i don't know about anyone else but  
we get really tired when we're shopping and we 
get over it pretty quick i don't know if it's the  
people we're just walking around um so that was 
enough for us we got what we needed but we're back  
in our hotel here i don't know if we mentioned 
but we're staying in an area called mccarty it's  
right in the middle of the city but i did some 
research and found like it's kind of a mix between  
a trendy like spot with restaurants and bars and 
there's lots of shopping centers but it's also  
like the red light district as well so it's a 
little bit grimy but it's pretty cool i think it's  
the best area to stay in it's the most affordable 
without being uh too outdated as far as the  
hotels go yeah there's restaurants within walking 
distance heaps of bars if you're into nightlife so  
it's probably a good spot to stay we'll leave 
a link down below to the hotel we're staying at  
yeah in the next video we're going to be talking 
about where we're headed next we've decided we're  
going to go to a new country to hopefully stay for 
a while so make sure you watch the next video make
