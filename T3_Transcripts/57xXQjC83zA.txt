Build your driver's license.
You can practice to drive, Marie.
Marie is special to make the life difficult every day.
Every day new problems.
That's the life.
I don't want her to do anything.
She can make what she wants.
She is cooking what she wants.
When she is sleeping the whole day, I let her sleep.
She is her own boss.
And I tell her 100,000 times, we are married.
But I'm not your owner.
She is coming and asking me if she can go to telephone.
I tell her, you can tell me you want to go to telephone.
I know where you are going, it's okay.
But you don't ask me, I'm not your owner.
You can make what you want.
But often I ask her, we have no bananas.
I want to go to telephone.
Bananas going to telephone.
For what we need every moment bananas.
I tell her, when you think you want to go to telephone.
But it's nonsense.
I have to fight every time with such nonsense.
We have no tomatoes.
The icebox is full with all vegetables and potatoes and meat and all.
For what you go to telephone for a few tomatoes.
Will I not stop here every moment here with nonsense and the money thrown out of the window without an end.
She wants you to be her side.
But I don't care here in the management for ordinary.
You know what happened last time?
Marie is coming in the morning.
I want to go to Taliban to buy medicine.
And I tell her, I need to go also today to Taliban.
I need to buy my medicine.
The medicine is empty.
It's important.
I want to go.
And I told her, I tell you in the moment I need to go to Taliban.
But I need a moment for dressing and all.
No, she wants to go alone.
She, you need.
That is not the truth.
She is going alone paying tricycle to go to Taliban.
And half hour later I drive with a car to Taliban.
But I'm at the point I let her go.
So I'm in Taliban.
I was very far finish.
I'm going to metro bank.
I buy my medicine and I bought a cigarette.
And I go home.
I'm a moment at home.
She's coming home.
Why you don't wait for me in Taliban?
Yeah, I tell you, I think you are very crazy.
Where I shall find you in Taliban?
There is some people are different kind of system of help or kindness.
With such nothings I have to do here every morning.
And I learn to handle it.
You have to do this, to do that.
But the other thing, another kind.
When I would not be old and sick.
That I like to stay at home and be quiet here.
That never would work out with money.
She have good luck that she found a person who know about the mental health.
And that I learn to handle them.
Right.
But congratulate yourself because you do this.
It is very hard when compiling papers or very papers.
That is not to understand for other people.
In the evening about 5 o'clock I change that to the place.
It become dark here and cold.
And Marie is in the room.
She is watching her videos in the phone.
Or she write anything.
And any time she is crying for me.
I need to take my walking stick to walk in the sleeping room.
When I ask what is the problem?
Nothing.
How often she is coming out of the room.
I miss you.
I feel alone.
I tell you what is that for.
I am sitting here.
I am everyday at home.
How you can miss me?
At least you did a good job.
And it is at the point?
For me it is good when she is going sometimes to Taliban.
I have a moment really rest.
I will make that all in videos.
So the main point is do it free.
That is all a great problem.
She have every time problem with her stomach.
Suddenly she go to see her.
But there is never coming food out.
Only a little bit water that is all.
That of her mental health.
She get thought in her head.
Suddenly and I get business.
Last time in the evening she was lying there in the kitchen.
And I told her I think it is at the time to make a check up in hospital.
She want to make for the stomach.
And I told her in my mind it would be good to take a blood check.
And I am at the point.
She tell me sometimes nobody can think that.
To make computer tomography of the head.
And to look for sugar in the blood.
No she want only look for the stomach.
So until we are found a doctor for the problems of the woman.
We are going to a doctor.
It cost 800.
And now he give her a paper for going to the hospital.
He cannot look with the ultrasound outside.
We are going to the hospital.
No doctor.
Then is coming out the doctor is there only Thursday.
What is the problem?
Thursday in Marie cannot go.
She have in the morning pain in the stomach.
That is of the mental health.
She is afraid to go to the doctor.
The next Thursday is coming.
I cannot watch her.
And that is not my business.
When she say we go to the hospital I will drive.
I heard a music.
Now what Thursday again?
She is lying the whole day in the bed.
Nothing.
And one Thursday after the next is going.
And she have every time problems in the stomach.
And suddenly she going to CR.
I think there is nothing in the stomach that is of her mental problem.
Marie have every time any problem in her life.
Without problems she is not happy.
And the most problems are out made.
There is no problem.
I can tell her 100.000 times.
We have no financial problem.
We have a roof over the head here.
It is a wonderful place.
We have our rest.
We can sleep as long as we want.
Or we stand up early.
Nobody is asking for.
And what is the result?
I cannot sleep in the night.
My time is the morning to sleep.
The best until 12 o'clock.
Since then she wake me up.
You need to eat breakfast.
And I told her 100 times for what I need to set up for eating.
I can six weeks not eat.
I am alive.
You need to drink but you can eat.
Live without eating six weeks.
But she is scared for my health.
Because I need.
And she feel alone.
I am lying down in the afternoon.
We are sitting both here.
She with her phone there and I am here.
The last time she need to sit here.
She need to be very near at me.
And I told her what shall the nonsense.
I hear your speaking of the phone.
