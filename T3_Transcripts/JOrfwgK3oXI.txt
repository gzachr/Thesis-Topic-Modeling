 First time eating Filipinos food. Is it interesting? Yes. Filipinos. Faciality, right? Yeah. Can I try? I just arrived this morning in Filipinos. I'm already trying this. Hey! Come on! That's better than I thought. Haha. I don't want to think about what I'm eating. Chicken head. Egg. Yes. For some reason, I thought he said egg. Obviously, it doesn't look like an egg, right? Probably didn't sleep a lot last night. I don't know what it is exactly. Chicken head. I had it. Yes. Wait. You can't eat it. You can't eat it. Oh my god. It's good? I'm already eating the chicken head. Oh my god.
