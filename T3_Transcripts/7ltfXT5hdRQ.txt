 Future Friday. The freshest. We are in the midst of A.G.T. That's right. Big competitions in the world. And there's many performances we actually have not seen from the Philippines or Filipino talent going to worldwide stages like A.G.T., B.G.T., T.T.P., R.O.D. Whatever. Here is us reviewing some of these performances. We'll be checking out Mistress. Okay. San Dara Libantino, Sefi Francisco, and Alissa Bonabora. Oh, Bonabora. Give us a watch. Oh, and American Idol too. Everything. It's got talent in it. Mistress. Oh, Britain. Oh, I've seen this. You are about to be blown away. Keep watching. Oh, what the f***. Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I was expecting that right there. Goddamn. I know. Yeah, literally, bro. It's so fabulous. How? They have better brothers than me, though. Dude, look at their legs. What the f***. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I just don't. Oh, sir. The fricking texture of vocals. Absolutely phenomenal. Yeah, girl. What the f***. Get back there. What the f***. Get back there. Yeah, bro. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, bro. Yeah, bro. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we all have that timber. Well, the possibility. Woo, woo. Just. You're vocal, you know, speaking. Absolutely. Not a good rhythm. How about that? So everybody in the comments is very confused. Wow, what the f***. Okay, we have that timber anyways. Alexandra Liban-Pi. Oh, that's a, the, the, when he was done in 2013. Cool, cool, cool. It's always nerve-wracking. It's not Simon. You know. You know. Settle, Garg, settle. Yes, you get it done. You get it done. Yeah. Yeah, I'm on the edge. I'm on the edge. She's so nervous though. Yeah, I'm on the edge. I'm on the edge. She's so nervous though. Yeah, settle that. What a good example. What a good example. What a good example. What a good example. What sort of nerves and a little bit of anxiety due to your breath control and the tension and the diaphragm, right? That's the first thing I go. Oh, she's f***ing 11 or 10 or whatever. My God. It's just, you know, it's like, it's heartbreaking to watch because you know that they're capable of more and that's what this audition shows, right? That's the pipes. Yeah, yeah. But when nervous strike, it nerves strike. And freaking anxiety comes into the picture. The first thing that goes is the breath control because all your muscles tighten so your diaphragm also constricts and that's the first thing you need for singing. You need to maintain. That's what I mean. You need to settle. You need to sit on that. Oh, also. She's a child. She's a little bit more aged and also at this stage. You don't need a winning performance. You did a good enough performance. And then you can settle. You know what to expect. Yeah. She already got the audience and the whole cute factor down. Just try your best. And she's doing fine. Come on, kiddo. That's right. Yes. One night only. One night only. There we go. There we go. One night only. One night only. We only have to do. Also a very exposing piece. Also it's slow. That's how basically I'm having phone rubble. Yeah, it's slow and it's just. They're alone. The stage is so big. Oh, there we go. It has no chance going on. It's crazy. It's crazy. It's crazy. It's crazy. It's crazy, man. It's crazy. It's crazy, man. It's just the people's reactions, though. It's absolutely... It's just very, very well-versed. Yeah, it's crazy. Very well-versed. It's really interesting, super interesting part as well. It's like you do want to put on a show for the people. Sometimes it does help. You know, forget about a little bit about the judges and just focus on the actual musical aspect of things. If he's being well-received, the crowd is at the end of the market. I think that's a very big swat... It sways. Factor. Yeah, it's a big element to this competition. Because they dictate whether the audience is going to have a reaction to it outside of the studio. That doesn't mean that many Filipinos outtows, from the sort of the OPMC. Obviously, one of the most well-known notorious outtows and so forth, so voices like Jaya, since Jaya. You have had a few... Funny thing is, Elan Infa, right? She's very well-known for her whistle notes and hair. Yeah, but she's a natural outtowel. She's one. You have Jenny Tignoso. She's a bit of an outtowel. Yeah, yeah. But you're having that many. Especially you're having had ballad days at outtows in the last sort of 15 years. So certainly very refreshing to come from the sort of the Filipino music industry and then to put it in the world stage class. I wonder where she's up to right now and what I always wish is just, you know, this was quite a long time ago. Yeah, I wonder which is up to now. I hope she's still making music and... Sefi Francisco. I love the fact that she's completely brand new. It's just like, yeah, it's just brand new people. Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh my God. What a song. Nice, nice freaking... This is a banging song. This is a banging song. What's his name? Oh, his name. One direction, he's a... Yes. Louis Thomson. Actually, great. He's great. Bloody artist. He's really good. It's a good singer. He's a fine singer, but I don't artist. Damn. His rock stuff is so good. Uh-huh. Nice dueling of the larynx. That's a really nice duet. Oh. Oh, no. Let this be your praise. When we'll lose somewhere. Oh. What is Mr. Rob Williams doing there? Damn. He looks phenomenal, man. The lute's a cat to die. Where's the kiss? Double legata, ladies and gentlemen. Yeah. Guys. He's always very impressive. Yeah, literally. What? That's why she had such a good... Tilt. Yeah, I was like, ooh, that tilt is very well placed. Oh, that's a really hard position. Ooh, that's a really hard position. That's a hard position. Yeah. You're a great position. Yeah. We're really proud of that style to the world, yeah. Woo! You're a great place. You're a great place. Yeah. Let this be your praise. Crazy how Marcelito changed the whole game, really. Definitely. How it brought that style to the world, yeah. Yeah. I will never not get tired of how impressive that flip of the larynx can be. It's crazy. It's a brutal style to have, especially with your nerves as well, like, fucking hell. Bro, it's just physically speaking. The craziest thing technically is speaking to master. That flip between, it doesn't matter how well done or how clean the finished product is, just the physical freaking anchoring that you need for that is so mind-boggling to me. And the fact that there are people out there that do this and somewhat natural, it's crazy. It's absolutely, like, physically that shouldn't happen. It's physically, in a recent way, it's so impressive. But to see it done under pressure in such a big stage with so many things to be expected is absolutely phenomenal. Always will blow my mind. Oh my god, here we go. Oh, yeah. I knew it from that listen. Look how well, like, her addiction comes through. Hey, yo, what is that big shit, bro? Where you from? What is your background girl? She ties it. What are you talking about? What did you have to make out? Yeah! And she projects so fucking well, dude. Not really, not really projects well, but she's so well anchored. She's so, ah, this girl got musical background. Oh my god, my god. She had. So clean. Damn. She's without her doll, the cleanest thing of the day, like, that we've checked out today. That's what I'm talking about, boy. That's what I'm talking about. It's so clean. She's worth studying, like, you can use this. Is that your coach? You're watching this? Oh yes. You can use her as a model for, like, exemplifying modulation, enunciation, diction, projection, anchoring. What else? That's it. That's it, that's what I got. No, also, the freaking idea of an enphatic singing, like intention behind the song, or say, she is so well anchored. I actually knew from the beginning, from that first listen. I knew it was like, ooh, ooh, ooh, just anchored. She is well connected to her chest. There is, there's sometimes in theater that they give you only like 10 seconds for you to audition something. And if your whole career depends on that first opening, well... It doesn't depend on it. It's just, it could make, it could make you. It couldn't break you. It could make you. But a lot of KenBies said from that, from how grounded and how well in control of the environment you are. And from that first opening word that she had here, I just knew she was really connected, really well grounded. Even though these are not the most comfortable shoes, Divi grounded for. But still, they play a lot with balance, right? So that that... So move your hips forward, aren't they? Correct. So you have to like, readjust your posture. She is fantastic. I wonder if she's ever done theater. This is so good. She just sort of self taught. It could be possible for you to take your gaze at me. Which is like what's that? Oh, look at that placing. One of the many of them are wrong. I don't think moving the whole own. If you want to know, if you want to hear the sound, hear the whole sound. Damn. Oh, she's right. She's around for the money. You know, she was a little bit of money. This is so clear though. So open. Wow, she's damn connected to that. Yeah, that's amazing. I've got to fly. Woo! I want to fly. Oh, this stuff. Yes, okay. Gross moves that was so great. What are we, she up to now? That is so freaking awesome. That, that... I mean... I always wonder though. When you have like such technical and the singers with such so much vocal prowess, I mean, we've met them personally, we've known them, we've come across them. And they're... We've been blessed with that opportunity, yes. I always wonder, it's just like, okay, fuck, how do you market this? You know, because it's like the era of that type of prowess, which feels really weird to say, it's gone. Like, you don't really have that many vocal technique queens anymore out there. It's not commercial anymore. Yeah, you do, funnily enough, you are getting the Yebus, right? Which took like 10, 15 years to marry. They took a long time to come through. Yeah. But you have like Yeba, you have like... You're having some upcoming sort of R&B singers. What's the name of that Giza? He's coming to the jazz cafe in London. Oh, Bernard, Ron. You run Bernard, that's his name. Yeah, you're having what's his tiny desk. You're having talent like this with this type of vocal prowess. But ballot forward vocal prowess, you're not really seeing it anymore. That much, especially in the West, in the East, very damn popular. Like, China, you tell them that's the fucking thing. South Korea, that's the thing. Japan, that's the thing. The Philippines, even ballots kick ass until today. So, finally enough, you're not getting many new ones though. You're getting much more commercial music, P-pop is kicking butts and stuff like that. So, I always wonder, what do you do with someone who's actually perfect at singing? That's so weird, isn't it? What do you do? This was a fair planet. They would be number one. Correct. Oh my god, yes. The industry's not fair. That's not real life. That's not how shit works. Yeah, and, you know, the little baby exists. Yeah, I don't know. You're a little pompous. I sold billions of wreckage. Yeah, I really don't understand where the relatability, I do know that singers like her in theatre would do so well. They would do so, so well. Maybe there's nothing, maybe there are other avenues perhaps. The theatre is quite limited in terms of how many roles you can get. Did you make a living out of it? Yes, you can. Make a good living out of it. That's another question. But get ready for the grind. You have to get down and work. It's not as easy as putting out a record that you've worked really hard for and then promoted it and then get a little break out of that. I think they're doing all the right things. They try to not only make their nation proud and bring the Filipino flag and values and stuff of that, but they're putting themselves also in a big stage. Yeah, they're putting themselves in the biggest fish tank that you could possibly swim in. What is she up to now? No one knows she's up to now. I said in the previous one that we saw she was like an A-Shirt got talent and then she met David Foster. Yes. They're ready. When? Her name is Gwen. Yeah, Gwen. The door is absolutely open. I'd love to know what she's doing and we'd love to review some of her performances and stuff of that. From the middle of the year. From the middle of the year.
