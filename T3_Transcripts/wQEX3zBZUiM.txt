So I go with blessed to meet very hospital people, young people, treating me like a friend of family. So that will be number one. So I guess their economy is not that bad. Yeah, it's not that bad. Like they have a way to support people. Yeah. Understand like there's also this health benefit. I mean this is for some I worked before. Yeah. There are things that just make you comfortable. And they know how to love and take care of you like you're their own. And that's just my experience. So that's what I love about it for.
