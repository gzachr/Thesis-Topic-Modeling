today we are in a district in manila called 
binondo which is home to the oldest chinatown  
in the world manila chinatown is well known as 
a street food heaven so we came super hungry and  
ready to eat all the noodles dumplings desserts 
and everything chinatown has to offer let's go eat
so we're in chinatown now and we don't have 
a solid plan of how we're going to eat our  
way through chinatown but i did pin a bunch of 
locations in binondo that look really really good  
so what we're going to do i guess is just 
to walk towards these pins and try whatever  
they have i think we're a bit on the outer 
side of chinatown because it seems too quiet  
first stop tasty dumplings sounds good to me
oh they have way more than dumplings here 
actually they have this pork chop rice  
looks super good don't order too much because 
we're gonna be eating a lot of food today okay  
thank you look at the piece of 
pork chop covers the entire rice
no that
wow and it's like thinly battered oh 
my gosh it smells like salt and pepper
what's inside let's try it to find out
what is it pork pork dumplings
the skin is like nice and chewy this 
is really really really delicious  
you need to dip in the sauce 
yeah the chili oil is really good
this is a good start to a chinatown adventure  
let's try the pork i got to peel it with my 
hand oh wow look the pork is like super thin
so you're eating mostly like the 
batter but is the batter delicious
the batter is really nice this chili sauce
to die for so delicious
so we were going to go check out the minor 
basilica because we saw how beautiful it looks  
inside but there's actually a wedding 
going on so i think we don't want to  
go inside but yeah it looks 
beautiful on the outside too
okay one thing about the crosswalk here is it's 
super fast i think you have six seconds to cross  
and you have to wait 85 seconds every time so we 
better be quick watch it it's like 10 seconds to  
go here here we go five seconds we don't really 
have five seconds the cars are still going
how is that possible welcome to chinatown now i 
think we're going to the main chinatown area like  
the busy area just like many chinatowns around 
the world you will see that those buildings are  
fairly old the wiring is pretty 
crazy and there's a lot of traffic
i think we're gonna try this one okay inside 
veggies how much is it 70 70. hello love you bye
they look so pretty don't they yeah look at that
it's savory but i don't know what it is it tastes 
kind of garlicky and a little bit oily inside  
i don't know why i thought it was 
gonna be sweet here you want to try
i think there's mushrooms in it actually i know 
why you can't explain what it is i don't know  
it's so different the taste the texture 
is all different a bit too greasy for me
so we're here at this place that sells lumpia 
lumpia is like a filipino spring roll i believe  
it's really famous i think we should try it
he asked me if it's my first time 
here and i said yes and he said oh  
good taste it's really good he's trying 
to help me order i think he's so kind
thank you
he's really friendly though he is a 
filipino chinese that's been living  
here in manila for a long time and there's a 
huge community of filipino chinese in manila
let's try my first lumpia you can see 
inside kind of exploded a bit there's  
like a lot of carrots and cabbage 
maybe even like minced meat i think
it tastes really clean like healthy 
the skin is like very nice and thin but  
it's just full of vegetables this is like the 
healthiest thing we've had in the philippines  
we've been eating so much fried chicken this is 
really really good thank you so much thank you  
so that shop might be a little bit harder to find 
because it is down this alley and there is no  
signs at the top the name of the shop is just 
at the bottom but it is definitely worth trying  
it's very different and i quite like it why is 
there a lineup for this place let's check it out
and what you should order is soup number 
five made from bull's testicles okay  
we're having soup number five
so we just sat down at chuan kee which is the 
oldest fast food restaurant here in chinatown i  
ordered something kind of simple it's on which 
is stir fried vermicelli noodles and initially  
i wanted to go with the bull testicle 
soup but after reading the description i  
changed it to meatball soup so still balls yeah 
yeah okay so tons of people order the xiaolongbao  
like the steamed dumplings with the soup and the 
meat inside they're quite famous but we just had  
dumplings so i think we're going to pass because 
we still want to fit in dessert but they do look  
really really delicious i think i ordered it 
wrong i wanted noodle soup with meatballs but this  
is just soup and meatballs it's perfect 
because i ordered way too much noodles
oh wow see it looks bland it's actually 
full of flavor it's quite delicious
it is at least yeah you look it's real avocado
my new favorite thing in the philippines this 
stir-fry noodle is actually really interesting  
because it just said stir-fried noodles it 
didn't say what type of meat or what is in there  
and right now i can see like random like 
half a siumai some type of sausage maybe  
oh no i dropped the one prawn that 
was in there it went on the floor
how is everything so flavorful the food in the 
philippines are like seasoned to perfection they  
like their food like bold salty i gotta be honest 
with you though when we first before we came to  
the philippines we didn't think that the food here 
would be good we didn't know what the food would  
be like to be honest although this is like chinese 
filipino but it's still part of the filipino  
cuisine right we're gonna try our best to finish 
all the food and still leave some room for dessert
that was a lot of food but i think we still got 
room for dessert right yes we just have to find it
so we were walking around for a little bit and 
we couldn't quite find dessert we were thinking  
of something like maybe halo 
halo or some type of like  
the tofu dessert but we couldn't find it 
so we ended up going to lord stow's bakery  
and i believe this is a franchise in manila 
they are famous for these Portuguese tarts
it's really good though it looks so good so 
i think this will have to do for today but  
i'm sure during our stay in the philippines 
we're going to try other amazing desserts
it's like an egg tart with like a puff pastry on 
the outside and on the top they put some sugar so  
they caramelize the top so it's different from the 
traditional egg tarts that i'm used to from hong  
kong where they don't burn the top so did you 
have enough to eat today i am so full i think  
we probably are at our max we cannot fit any more 
food it's probably time to go home it's always fun  
visiting chinatown in a city though because 
you can really feel the culture and you can  
tell today that filipinos love food we hope you 
enjoyed this food tour with us today in chinatown  
thank you so much for watching and as always have 
a wonderflo day we will see you in the next one
