 Sila... Syah, kaga uейan? Se意er Richtanging Sila, wawakha Is that tears that I feel? Feel up with emotions? Could I taste them for real? Ma Buhay, Salatan Filipinos. How are you guys? Hope everything is well. I know probably that it's really boring for many of you because everybody is locked down right now in their home. We are luckily here in the farm. I'm actually getting a bit bored as well. I know that I'm in an open space, but I'm really like to travel. I'm really like to do stuff. Also today I start to go around the farm to look for something to do. Yesterday, if you saw our previous video, I found out the guilla bano fruit. I never said it before. I never tasted it before. If you won't go back yesterday and check our video. Today I was going around and I found this fruit. I think it's a fruit. I don't even know the name. It's a green look at here. Do you know what this is? I actually don't know. So now let's go back to the tree and let's ask if she knows. If we can eat this, can we? Or no, let's go. Hi, baby. Hello. Hi. What's up? Where have you been? Around. I found something. Uh-huh, I'm sure. Yes. What is it? I don't know to explain. It's green. You need to come with me to see it. Everything is green here. Yes. Looks like a fruit. But I don't know what is. Can you come with me? Yeah, wait. Yes. What are you doing here? I am... You're peeling the anguria. The watermelon. Yes. You're going to make a shake. Wow, for me? Yes, for everyone. Thank you. You're a little bit... What is that? Oh, my God. That's Camille. Camille. Camille. But it's a table? Yeah, I... You know, it's a table? No, I am. Okay. The dried fruit is what we put in the synecag. Oh, okay. And it has beautiful flowers here. Look at it. Yes. But is a flower or is a vegetable? It's a fruit. Is a fruit? Yes. Oh, we can use it also for the smoothie now. You can make it as a shake. You can make it as a shake. Why don't we try it? We can. We take some. Yeah, but we have to be careful in choosing... This one is okay. Okay, let's pick it. But don't pick the small ones. They're not yet ready. Let's try to take this. Hmm. Also this one. This one is fine. Okay. What's the name Camias? Yes, Camias. I never said before. It's in Italy, we really don't have this. This is sour. It makes the smell like grass. Yes. And it's weird. It's weird, yeah. Let's try. You can make it into pickles or you can jy it for the... Is it like pickles? Yes, you can make it into pickles, yeah. I don't like pickles. Let's try. So now we are picking some of these. And we need to pick the big one because they are the ones that are ripe. And we'll use for do a shake, right? Yep. And with what we'll do the shake, only these will mix with something else. Just that. Just this? Yeah, and sugar syrup. Okay. I think we'll be a good glass. I think that's fine. Okay. There is also here another... Camilla, right? Camilla. Another Camilla. Let's pick some also here. It's bigger. That's a really big look. So big. Yeah. And let's go. It's now full. We have the boiled food now. We can go. Are you now? I'm really curious to taste. I don't know if I will like honestly. So we are back in our position. Okay, so let's continue this because we need to put in the blender this one because they're going to melt. It's not. The watermelon, right? Yeah. We spent time getting the Camilla. There are our Camillas. So let's do first. Okay, so last night, the half of the watermelon already put in the freezer. So now it's going to hurt the whole thing. You want the help you? No, you make it. Frozen already? Yes. We're going to make a smoothie for this. And also we will use the guilla bano that we got yesterday, right? The guilla bano. It's here. The one that I call out, right? It's frozen. Yeah. So we're going to combine the watermelon and the guilla bano for this. Very good. So first... And let's remember what are the good things of guilla bano? I mean, why is it good to eat guilla bano? Well, guilla bano is rich with cancer-fighting cells. So you can fight cancer all together inside. Very good. You can fight cancer. It's rich on vitamin C that is good to fight also the viruses and the coronavirus. And the watermelon. So let's put the frozen watermelon inside for the guilla bano. We better hurry because it's starting to melt. Yes. But I don't think we can finish everything. Let's use just what we need. Just for our... And you have to get the yogurt in the fridge. Yes, I go. Oh, yogurt, baby. Yeah, yogurt. Very good. Now it's starting to become windy. And it already drizzled a bit. Which is good. So let's put about... ...three tablespoons of yogurt. So now our smoothie is ready. Yeah. We're gonna serve it in a bowl. Looks delicious. And pink. Pink. It's a combination of guilla bano and watermelon. Thank you, baby. A little bit of yogurt. One, two, three. So this is your guilla bano and watermelon smoothie. So nice. And good for your health, right? Yep. And now we need to try that. This is the next one. So we need to wash this first. So I almost finished my smoothie with guilla bano and watermelon. And now we're going to do a shake with camias and sugar. Let's see. I'm put a bit of ice also. So it looks like a cocktail. Let's see. And a bit scared. So it's now the time. Tresita is cut in the camias and she's putting it in. Actually, here in Batanga, we call it kalamias. Kalamias. Kalamias. But in Manela, they call it camias. Basically, this is a good source also of vitamin C. Yes, vitamin C be 1, be 2. And also this is good for delta because it's fighting a lot of things like cancer and other things, right? And because it's, you know, we don't use chemicals. We have pesticides here. It's also organic. It's freshly picked from the tree. Whether we also use a sebutron. You know, the lechon restaurant. They also serve this, coming as shake. Oh, okay. So I will try for the first time camias shake. So it's almost half the blender. And then we will put ice with a bit of water. Very good. And then it looks like a moito. It should be syrup. And sugar. Very good. And then we will blender. Everything is ready. Close. And... You want to open? No. Teresa, I have tried it. It tastes like santoel. What is santoel? Your face doesn't look like... Doesn't look nice, your face. Why? Let's put more of this. More sugar. For Teresa, we need to put more sugar. More sugar. And let's see. So you didn't like much? No, it's not bad. It's not bad. It's still a bit sour. So Teresa, try it. Now let's try. Looks like a cocktail, actually. Like a moito. It really looks really the same. Because it looks like there is mint inside. The color is really similar. Now let's try. It tastes like avocado. But it's not bad. It's... I need to be honest. It's not something that I would buy. But it's not also bad. I mean, you feel a bit sour, a bit sweet. Because we put sugar. Looks like grass. It tastes like grass. But... But it's refreshing. Yes, yes. And there's no weird after this. So you feel clean. Actually, after you drink, you feel clean. Actually... It's like your gut is being cleaned with all that sourness. Yeah, I think I like. Probably, and I will be honest. I don't think I will like if I will eat just like this with salt or with sugar. Because it's like a bit of vegetables and I don't eat vegetables. But as a fruit, I mean as a fruit shake, definitely I like. And it's like a drink. It's like that you're going to drink a cocktail. It's not bad. Maybe with some alcohol inside, it's even better. Yeah, I think. Like vodka or... I think... Maybe with vodka, this would be really perfect. We need to try this. Yeah. I think so. So from healthy to get drunk. It's just a step, right? No, because it almost tastes like a cocktail. It's like it's just missing a punch. Or maybe you can actually make it into a punch also. So also today I try a new thing in my life, hearing the Philippines, and I really like it. And see you tomorrow with a new video, and maybe we will try a new thing, right? New food or something else.
