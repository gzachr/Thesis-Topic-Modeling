 Hello, I'm Jinhyuk from Hongkong. I'm Nihon, Channel Takales. Hi, I'm Norman from PDP. Hello, I'm Nihon. Hello, I'm Nihon. I'm Nihon. So, how about the next one? Okay, so enough with the salty ones. Let's proceed with the sweet one. First is the butter macaron. So it's just not the usual macaron that you have. It has coconut. Okay, it's more of a ride, right? It is, but more chewy. Okay, chewy. Is it? It's like crunchy actually, right? Really? Yeah. Oh. Oh. I know this taste. I don't live. Mm-hmm. Coconut? It's butter and macaron. It has coconut. Yeah, right? I like it. It looks like it's going to be crunchy actually. Right? I thought it was going to be crispy. It's fried, but it's actually really soft and chewy. Really interesting. What is the name of it? It's butter and macaron. Okay, I'm going to give 9 out of 10. Oh, really? For me, I create the free version. For me, around 6. It has a somewhat sweet. Oh, yeah, right? It's really good, unique and similar to the Thai dessert taste, but too much sweet. But other than that, it'll be great for sweet lovers. 9.5 or 10. Okay. Because it's really good and it impressed me. It's a prize moment. The next one? Okay. For the next one, it's the classic polvoron. It has Spanish influence now. It's like shortbread. Okay. So what? What is it? The crunchy. I mean, there's no smell at this, I think. Oh my god, super nice. I like it. Yeah. Hunde points, hunde points. I really like it. Really? Yeah. What made it first day? I'm joking. I want to have this one with tea, something. Milk. Yeah, milk or something. Yeah. Wow, really crazy noise anyway. I feel like if I finish this, I'm going to choke. I need milk. Yeah, do you guys, I'm going to get 100 out of 10. Oh, wow. I'm not lying, guys. This is the best snack I've ever had in my life. Oh, really? Really? This is not a snack anymore. It's like, it's like heaven. It's like heaven. Masala. Masala. So, Jay, what will you give it out of 10? Like it's 100. 100. Seven. Yeah, I like it taste and give it like sweet and milky. But when I had it, like make me thirsty. Oh, okay. For me, I would give it an eight if I eat it alone. But I would give it a 10 if I ate it with like milk or tea or anything. I would give it a nine just because it lost one point because I almost choked. I've never seen like this kind of like snack in Korea. And boys not a snack anymore. That's pretty good. It's like, oh yeah. It's a dark, dark taste. So, the last one, maybe? Okay, last one. Yeah, yeah. Okay. So, it's like a crust and what inside is a gooey purple lamb. Okay. Just one and cut it in half for you. Okay. Oh, quite hard. Oh, did it. A roll? No, right. It looks like blueberry. Cheers. Cheers. How do you say cheers in Filipino? You say, tagai. Tagai. Tagai. Tagai. Tagai. Tagai. Woo. Interesting, Tate. Because we have similar one. Not a snack. We say in Korea, we have like hotdog. Oh, hotdog. Oh, did you know hotdog? I want to pull in microwave. Little one, yeah. Yeah. Make it like hot. Best one hot. Oh, all right. Best one hot. So, anyway. I'm gonna give six out of ten. Personally, I don't like the one like inside. I don't know what it is. It's maybe like honey with like taro, I think. I'm not a big kind of taro in honey. So maybe it's because of the previous one because it was so nice. So how about you guys? I'll give it a four. Because when I first bit into it, it was so good. I was like, hmm, but then as I chew it, the things inside, it's not my thing. I'll give this like a seven because contrary to Trilin, I really like the one inside. Oh, that's sweet. I'll give this like a seven because contrary to Trilin, I really like the one inside. Oh, that's sweet. Within the outside, it's kind of still like crispy. I think it will be better if it's like more moist. Yeah, I'm not saying any hot. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, so eight. Eight, okay. But yeah, better than to moisten and hot. I will give to ten. I like to. Really? Okay. Today, we've done reviewing like those seven kinds of rice six or seven kinds of most favorite. Who's the youngest? Yeah. It's quite interesting to experience like the one we've never tried before. Likewise, I feel the same as Jay. Yeah, and then we just find this not right. Now I'm quite interesting about the Philippines food. Oh, okay. Anyway, one more time Norman, thank you for bringing it. Thank you very much. Thank you so much. Jay, Takah. Norman. Yeah. Shilian. Salam alaikum. Salam alaikum. Yes. Thank you.
