What do you want to burger? Come to the burger. Oh. 190. You want to burger and stromboli? My dad needs to try this. Because we see sausage all the time. The sausage is USA-Quan. What? What is going on guys? Welcome back to another day of living in the Philippines as an American. So for today's vlog, we are going to be doing a typical day living in the Philippine as an American. So guys, I have a special treat for my Filipino viewers and then I also have a special treat for my American viewers. So first, we're going to go do the Filipino errands. We got some errands to run. So the Filipino errand is my mom has a special request. She wants me to pick up this paris overload. So if you guys don't know what paris is, can you explain what paris is? No. Paris is like a typical beef meat with a soup with the corn bone marrow. So we've had paris on our channel, but this is a paris overload. Yeah, it's like a ballad lol. So if you guys are unfamiliar, it's basically beef, corn, bone marrow, and just an overload of paris, I guess. So that's for my Filipino viewers. We're going to do that first, pick that up for my mom, and then for my American viewers, even my Filipino viewers, they can join too. We're going to go to the biggest grocery store in Angeles City, which is a new one they just opened called Landers. And if you guys are unfamiliar with Landers, oh my gosh, it's plain. So yeah, guys, for my second part of the day, we are going to go into the American grocery store Landers. So I'm super excited to go to Landers because it's my first time. They just opened it about a month ago, and they sell imported products. Yeah, American, I think they have all type of maybe some European products, all that. But we're not going for the grocery. We're going for the pizza. So we're going to try Landers pizza, and we're going to see if it compares to SNR. Let's go get this big bowl of paris overload, and then we're going to take you to Landers. We're going to check out prices on grocery food, and we're going to check out how good the pizza is. So I'm excited, guys. Let's go. If you guys like my content, please like, comment, and subscribe. I appreciate all you guys for watching. And it just helps me make more content.

The, the, just finish that rice. Okay. I'll have the other one. Here. You try it now. It's actually good. Now it's good. Well, first I'll try to read out the sauce. It's good already. It's good without the sauce but you need the chili oil. Alright, so that's it. I got to rate this at 8. And if you want more Kalamon Simon, just add more to your taste. Right. We didn't add it so. Don't do something. Alright. Alright, let's see you guys when we go to the landers. Turn it off, mom. Oh. Yep. Just like that. This is a wine bowl, yeah? What is that?

Yeah. This is the menu that pizza, pasta, chicken, burgers. So, so far they have way more than SNR now. And I'm excited to try the pizza. Yeah, I'm so excited to try, because this one looks delicious. So, let's see if it's worth it, or if SNR is the way to go. Oh my gosh, nah. Your pizza look good. So we have to get these trays, right? We want to try the one cheese and one pepperoni. We might have to try three all of it. Oh my gosh, is that cheese or pepperoni? Pepperoni. Yeah, cheese is on the bottom. Try one cheese, one pepperoni. What's that though? That look good. It's like meat and mushroom. Yeah, one look good. We might have to try that one, mom. Try that and a pepperoni. Oh, cheese? Yeah, I don't know. Do you want to try cheese? I just want to try the cheese and pepperoni. All right. I don't need nothing crazy. It's too much meat. They got Bronx pepperoni and then New York cheese. So far, nah, what do you think? I think it looked better than SNR. Yeah, I guess. I don't know. I think it's taste great. This one looks more cooked. Usually SNR is kind of like... The only thing here is in Ladas. There's a lot of bunch of stuff you can get like food. SNR, you can only get pizza in Ladas. Yeah, they got way more options. So I'll let you guys know what else they have. So right now we're just here for pizza. But we might have to get some burgers. I see burgers down there. Nah. We'll figure it out. We'll figure it out. It's all over one of them. Oh my god. Look at how big that pizza is. Nah. Look at that. So guys, we're going to go with the pepperoni and that one. What is that baking mushroom? Baking the butter. Okay. Cool. So look how big that slice is. Nah, it's huge. So they also got margarita. I'm not a fan of olives. And then pepperoni. Oh my gosh. It looks really good. Is it so exciting? It looks so exciting. I love the show. I ain't going to go live. I ain't going to go live. So far. So far landers is definitely winning against SNR. So let's see this. I don't like that one. Nah, it looks a little dry. I ain't going to go live. So they also got like pasta. What's the name of the oven? Oh, that's pepperoni sausage. Can we take that back? I want the pepperoni sausage. You know, the sausage never has sausage pizza. No, we need to get that. You want to? Go for it. Or do you want to get the burger instead? Bro, they never have pepperoni sausage in the Philippines. Nah. I'm so used to eating pepperoni sausage. That's brand new. You might have to get that. Or do you want to try like a burger or something? Alright. So yeah, guys, so many options. I'm so excited. You could get this kind of right with the landers card or no? Oh, sure. This is my first time. No, I don't know. I'm not sure. But the pasta, I'm not really a fan of. Hello. The pasta, it doesn't look the best to me, no? Huh? You think the pasta looks okay?

Just do this chicken out. No, no, stromboli. You don't want that chicken like. Just get what? Did you want the burger too? No, no. All right, grab this stromboli. Tell her now. I don't think it's just for show. Yeah, that's for like part of this. All right, go tell her now. Go tell her. Go tell her. You can get some fake out. It's like a stromboli going hit. It's like a pizza. Guys, I'm so excited for this. It's crazy. So unfortunately guys, they don't have this stromboli. So we're going to get the sausage by drone. So, oh yeah, we also got some french fries. So we'll test those out. But yeah, now this is real. So far, I'm so impressed now. This is crazy. Oh, even the seats. Look at all. The seats. It's crazy. You want to sleep here now? I'm going to stay here. So guys, we ended up getting the pepperoni. The pepperoni sausage. No, you're going to take a first bite of your ever sausage pepperoni. I know. I'm so excited too. Then we got the bacon. And then we got some fries. So, nah. Let's hurry up and stop talking. I know. Alright guys, we're going to just get right into it because we're so hungry. Yes. We're going to have to pray. Oh yeah. Thank you Lord for these blessings. Thank you Lord for everything. We love you. We appreciate you. Bless our viewers. And please keep us safe and healthy. And the name of Jesus I pray. Amen. So, nah. Look at this pepperoni sausage. It's pepperoni sausage guys. Nah. This is her first time ever trying pepperoni sausage. Because that's all during the states. We always eat pepperoni sausage. They don't really have it in the Philippines. It's a real one. Alright. First bite. First bite. Go on up. Oh my god. I got a french fry. Sausage. Try the sausage. Try the sausage. Don't need too much. It's good. You like sausage on pizza? Yeah. What do you think? Right that. You like just regular pepperoni? Solid eight. Solid eight? Yeah. So, do you like just pepperoni better? Yeah. Maybe I would like the beef bone. Alright. Let me try it guys. Pepperoni sausage in the Philippines. You know, like, nice crust in the bones? Yes. Like, weird. Bo. Oh. Solid eight? Yes. I think it's, I don't know, an eight per minute. The sausage tastes like the US version now. Really? Yeah. My dad needs to try this. I'm trying to get better. Cause we use the sausage all the time. The sausage is USA-Qualm. Ah. What? Pepperoni. It's good, but it's kind of cold. Pepperoni is warm. Yeah. That's new here. Oh yeah, it is. This one is for real. Oh yeah, it is cold. I'm just going to order it to the 7.9. Cause it's so crispy. I don't know. Let's try this one. I'll give it a try. I give it a try. This one is bacon and mushroom. Mmm. It's good. It's good. It's good. It gives you a lot of bacon. That's amazing. It's your favorite? A nine. Solid nine. She's got Filipino taste buds. Why? I like this a lot because of bacon. We don't really put bacon on pizza though. It's like we do, but... I taste like chicken base. That's good, though. See, she's not going to go traditional American. She wants exotic, weirds of Filipinos. They always get weird combinations. So I can have this all? Huh? That's got it all in half so we can share. These french fries though are very good. Mmm. So we share. And they give you a lot for 70 pesos. The total? Let me try the price. The total was $420 pesos for all this? Wow, this is great. So I can't complain on this is very good. Do I say lambdas is better than SNR? I think so. What do you think? I would go to lambdas every time. The store is nicer. The pizza tastes better. It's much fancier. It might be a little more pricey, but I think lambdas beats SNR 100%. Look at that. We got two slices now. She cut it in half. So you're really... We really got a whole pizza now for less than four. What is it? We got fries for $420. That's a good deal. So I'll say this slice because it's way bigger. What is this? Mayo? They gave us a mayo. Mmm. SNR? No. What? SNR is always undercooked and the cheese is always like super, super not crispy. I like the... The thing about SNR, the pizza is so doughy, but I like doughy pizza. So this mayo is nice. I like it. I don't really eat mayo on fries or mayo in general. I like mayo. I don't like it. Sorry. Try it now. The ketchup. I like ketchup. What is this? Oh hot sauce. Oh, I gotta hide this. Why? I like hot sauce on my pizza. You know what I'm saying? It's not eating hot sauce with pizza, no? Why? I can never eat pizza without hot sauce. But overall, I'm giving it lambers a 9.5 hour time. Yeah, I agree with that. Honestly, it should be a 10 hour 10 now. There's really no complaints. And they also have desserts and everything we didn't even try to get. Yeah, maybe next time. Anyway, there's not that hot. But thank you guys for watching. Today was an amazing day in the Philippines. If you decide to move to the Philippines who will have no problems, they have American stuff, they have multicultural in the Philippines. So guys, make sure you guys like this video. Comment down below. What is your favorite thing to eat in the Philippines? And we appreciate you guys for watching.
