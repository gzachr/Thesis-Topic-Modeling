in today's video we are going to one of the 
biggest markets in Manila and I'm going to try  
to spend $100 or about 5,500 pesos on all kinds 
of items there in the end I'm going to give away  
everything I bought to homeless people let's see 
what this Market in Manila has to offer what are  
the prices like and how much we can buy feel 
free to join okay but first we need to get to  
an area where we can find lots of markets and I'm 
trying to catch one of these jeepneys here these  
are very popular rides that you can find all over 
Manila okay I am not 100% sure if I can just flag  
them down by the side of a road like a taxi or if 
there are proper stations where I stop but yeah  
this is the direction I need to go so this road is 
definitely the right one let's see so they have uh  
signs in the front uh with the destination or the 
direction they are going written on it so I need  
to see if I can uh spot the chy it has the right 
direction written on it excuse me hello hello  
hello how can I take a Jeep here can I just flag 
them down where you go I want to go to baclaranI  
can just wa here and I need to do this just right 
here okay he said right here this way right yeah  
where you going I want to go to baclaran right 
here and do I need to do this yeah yeah just  
read the signs there's some sign board in the 
they have a sign B right name ban you just okay  
okay and how much pesos is it 15 15 15 pesos okay 
okay all right there's a there's a jeepney coming  
let's see what sign is written on it if you like 
je there's a train you like train oh I want to try  
the jeepney it's rare it looks looks like fun like 
right yeah the jeepneys are fun I think actually  
it took them before last year but haven't tried 
it this year so is this one going in the right
direction let's see no back no okay 
so this is not going in the right
direction Liber it's not far from here maybe like  
15 minutes or so no no it's 
like 20 20 minutes okay okay
oh what is this like a taxi taxi yeah she have 
taxi but only ah so they also have these Shar  
taxis here I think oh he's just going in the 
back oh W oh he just opened the B and hopped  
into the B oh that was interesting okay oh yeah 
Bak I can take this one this one oh so this is a  
gep mey I can take all right let's take a Jeep 
me all right oh all right hello [Music] hello  
ah okay so it is a bit dark in here it is 
a bit hot I think I need to pay [Music]
now
now thank you okay so works like this you just 
uh hand the money to the driver and then uh oh  
I get change even so I gave him 20 and I got three 
pesos change that means the write is 70 pesos and  
I think it's always the the same amount no matter 
how far you are going because obviously he doesn't  
know how long I'm going but let's see oh I can't 
even sit straight here because I'm Too Tall okay  
so we are here now the the Blue Dot and I want to 
go to this area right here so I don't don't think  
it's a long [Music] ride okay so we are making 
a few stops here and there and then some people  
jump on some people jump off and then when you are 
sitting in the back you just hand the money over  
and everyone passing it to the driver and then 
I guess the driver will uh pass over some change  
yeah I think that what he's doing now and then you 
just hand it over to the person to get the change  
oh very easy system here oh I really like the the 
character of these cars it looks so old so unique  
I think most of these vehicles are left over from 
the the second world war and the Americans were
here okay what I have also seen before is if it's 
too full in here then sometimes people just stand  
right here or or holding like onto the the rails 
here standing on the outside so sometimes these  
gys get very busy oh no problem especially like 
in the evenings or probably also in the early  
mornings I think that these are the the main way 
of transportations for the locals here the most  
popular form of transportation to get around 
the city probably also the most affordable
one yeah I think you need to make sure that you 
get off where you want to get off because there  
are like no announcements or anything so you need 
to be careful to don't miss your stop and it's  
incredible how many of these GPS are here you 
can literally see hundreds of them all around  
the city here probably there are thousands here in 
[Music] Manila okay I'm pretty sure now that there  
are no fixed stations you can just Flex them down 
basically so obviously they have one fixed route  
so we're just staying on this uh Road basically 
and then whenever there are people standing on  
the side flag the the G down we're making a stop 
so I don't think that they are like bus stations  
you know the question is how to make them stop 
when you are inside like let's say you want to  
get out right here I'm wondering if you can 
just tell the driver to stop excuse me if I  
want to get out can I just tell stop yeah so 
I can stop anywhere you can just say it means  
Stu inal yeah ah okay okay okay where you from 
sir I'm from Germany oh no this your accent from  
dut my accent is German right yeah yeah I have 
a strong accent I want to go to bakan it's not  
far from here anymore right oh yeah we're almost 
here now so we are right here and I want to go  
here so probably the next stop so I can get 
off here yeah yeah okay okay Sal here thank  
you very much all right oh I'm in the middle of 
the road oh check it out all right but that was a  
very enjoyable fun right very affordable 17 pesos 
for like 20 25 minutes and now we have found the  
market area there should be like lots of Street 
Markets around here oh there's a guy having a pee  
here oh oh what a welcome to the area okay let me 
find the [Music] markets oh yeah so we do have uh  
some sweet stalls here already just by the side of 
the road you can find t-shirts can find clothings  
and yeah I think the first thing that we should 
buy which will probably be smart is to uh buy a  
bag or something something where I can put all the 
items that I'm going to buy inside hello how much  
are your bags here yeah I need but this is too big 
uh let's see maybe something like this if we can  
find something that is a right size do you have 
with a zipper yeah uh maybe like a bag that has  
a zipper that would be nice I think let's see what 
she has here ah yeah I think we have a zipper here  
yeah something like this is maybe perfect I think 
the size is good there are definitely some items  
fitting inside and I actually like the design as 
well check it out we have the Eiffel Tower here  
looks like a travel related design right uh Mao 
90 90 pesos okay I think we have a first purchase  
already that was a simple one get okay hello hi 
good afternoon good afternoon hello Kam 100 and  
we have a bag that's okay keep the change thank 
you very much Sal all right now we have secured  
a bag which we will uh fill up now and I think 
we do have lots of opportunities to fill up the  
bag because basically I think the whole area is 
basically like this lots of uh Street vendors so  
let's see what we can find oh we can get watches 
here on the streets for $2 I think you're selling  
watches here uh 250 not 100 100 that was the 
sign that caught my attention watch this for  
100 200 these are 200 oh he has some beautiful 
watches here oh gold ones silver ones 200 now but  
it's copy right but good copy good quality good 
quality we have some uh how much are these for
example oh you has some beautiful looking watches 
here for example a golden kazio watch here uh you  
do not how much is this one for example 200 200 
okay so we have watches for 200 here and uh the  
silver ones are the same price all 200 and these 
are 250 250 okay so we have the bigger ones here  
for 250 those are digital here I personally I 
prefer watches like this not the digital ones  
this one for example 200 can I see it let's have 
a look yeah obviously this watch is not for me  
but just to get a feeling how it looks oh here we 
go actually it fits nice can you bargain here or  
fix price fixed price 200 okay so he went down 
from 250 to 200 I'm going to pay the full price  
anyway just wanted to see how how much she goes 
down so he puts it inside there and then we will  
put it in the back here okay you can just put it 
inside here that's okay 500 you can just give me  
250 yeah I'm not going to uh bargain a lot on 
this video maybe I will but just for fun I'm  
not aiming to get the cheapest items possible 
today this is not what this video is about so  
we might bargain a little bit for fun but yeah 
I don't uh yeah I'm aiming to uh to pay the the  
full price anyway 250 is okay ah 250 250 yeah yeah

so the first two purchases are made uh maybe  
let's get some shoes some shoes maybe t-shirt 
pants all right and before we are going to buy  
more interesting things I would like to mention 
something that has been really helpful for me  
over the past 2 years and I am talking about surf 
shark VPN I am very sure by now most of you know  
what a VPN service is with a VPN you can virtually 
change the location of your phone or your laptop  
to basically anywhere in the world and in case 
you're wondering why this is so helpful let me  
explain it happens actually very often that when 
I'm switching to a new country that suddenly some  
websites are not available anymore or the type 
of content I see on these websites is different  
because many websites are geo-restricted and a 
good example that I always use the biggest problem  
that I always have is that I can't watch the 
highlights of the German Football bundes leer on  
YouTube they are blocked to see unless you are in 
Germany but yeah thanks to Surf shark VPN I have  
a solution for this problem so I just virtually 
change my location back to Germany and then I am  
able to watch the highlights but unblocking Geor 
restricted content is not the only advantage of  
using surf shark VPN if you are connected to a 
VPN it encrypts the data that is sent between  
your phone or your laptop and the internet and 
therefore your private information your personal  
data becomes safer so if you are not using a VPN 
service yet I highly recommend to start using one  
and yeah the VPN that I am using is surf shark VPN 
I've been using them for over 2 years already now  
I can highly recommend them it is the only VPN 
to offer one account for unlimited devices and  
if you would like to check them out as well now 
is a very good time because they currently have  
a special holiday deal you can just click the 
link in the description or on the pin comment  
and if you enter the promo code K you can get up 
to six additional month for free that is a great  
offer and they also have a 30-day money back 
guarantee so you can test it out without any  
risk click the link down below thanks to surj for 
sponsoring today's video and now let's see what  
else we can buy okay so this is a little bit of

they two for 150 all the same price no like this 
ah the small ones here how much for the for the  
big bottles here 250 250 and all the same price 
this 15 actually let me put on the bag ah I think  
I've never bought a perfume on the street can 
I try them yes I can smell them first uh which  
one is a good one which can you recommend for 
man this one is popular let's give it a smell  
this is oh the name is poison poison actually 
it smells really good yeah very strong smell I  
usually prefer lighter smells for myself okay how 
about the the boss one yeah I can you can spray it  
on here let's let's test it oh that one is good 
oh I like that one oh that smells really good  
which one is your favorite favorite this you like 
this one okay we have the boss one this one is 250  
yes 250 maybe let me try one more this one great 
man can can you spray it here okay let's try this  
one as well let's see oh yeah this is a lighter 
smell which I actually prefer but the hug boss  
one was also really good oh now I can't decide 
obviously this is not for myself but personally  
I would probably get this no the boss one are you 
want to take picture yes okay no problem so these  
are not original perfumes right where do you get 
them from from China ah so obviously these are  
not uh the original perfumes but I'm just curious 
how the fake perfume Market works you know um so  
maybe I'm going to get this one right here yeah 
yeah oh but he has so many interesting choices
here uh oh we have lacost here as well oh can I 
try this one as well lacost one maybe up here oh  
I'm going to smell very uh weird now with all the 
different smells on me oh this one is also very  
good oh that's that's these are three excellent 
choices um I think I'm going to get this one yeah  
but you have a new bottle yes yeah uh I have 
a new let's see how it works here so the the  
big bottles are 250 and if you want to get the 
smaller ones here you can get two for 150 which  
actually sounds like a way better deal but these 
are actually not sure what this is it's not even  
a proper bottle here but yeah let's get a nice 
perfume here from oh actually it's not hug boss  
it's a Bros is this hug boss boss Bros BR but 
the the design clearly looks like a hug boss  
right and here we have boss written actually so 
uh yeah you can see it's not an original one if  
you have a proper look so see I didn't even notice 
that at the beginning to be honest because the the  
letters look exactly the same like H boss which 
obviously they do on purpose trying to find it  
oh he has a lot of things here in this in this 
storage but no more stock in r no more stock yes  
what about this bottle oh it's no it's not full 
anymore right it's not full okay how about then  
let me try the diesel you have diesel stock yeah 
I have let me try the diesel one or maybe here  
yeah let's try the diesel one usually a very 
good perfume brand they have some really good  
smells oh this is really good oh I like this this 
is actually the best one like a all right this is  
a fresh smell it's style smell with style if you 
know what I mean okay this one 250 as well and  
you have stock yeah I have let's see if he has the 
the diesel one in stock this actually has the the  
original brand name written on it you know so they 
didn't try to uh to fake it okay this one okay so  
we have a diesel perfume okay 250 yes okay let's 
get a perfume okay Sal thank you very much all  
right we have a perfume I think this is the first 
time I bought a perfume on A Street Market to be  
honest so I guess I'm not sure what makes them 
lower quality than the original one but my guess  
would be they don't last as long as the original 
one but yeah now I'm still looking for some shoes
actually oh we can buy a wallet here 
as well maybe that looks interesting  
let's see if we can find a good wallet 
here how much are your wallets here 150  
sir 150 all the same price yes oh so I 
can choose which one I like actually I  
like the the leather ones over here is this 
original leather original leather yeah let's
see actually the smell she's laughing maybe 
there's something wrong with it original maybe not  
but I think they are pretty good with faking them 
nowadays the smell is really good you can burn
fire no fire now I have my dos you have a 
lighter fire no she's laughing okay we don't  
have original leather here but I still think 
that they are actually pretty okay I mean I  
like the designs of these one they look very 
uh stylish you know and 150 all of them you  
have a discount here how much pieces uh one 
piece okay I give you 130 130 yes how about

you recommend oh this look uh used already this 
is uh ring sh so but it's all new shoes I think  
these are clearly new shoes but this one looks 
a little bit like it's used already here this is
uh that's for for running and
running actually the shoes here seem to be quite 
decent for 650 all of them H yeah yeah that's 650  
this one is uh 900 900 so a little bit more 
expensive here shoe like this what sizes do  
you have you have all the sizes only the big 
big size is uh 45 how do you say sizes here  
you have I 41 up to 45 is that European size 
yeah personally I need 44 in uh in europe4  
but uh what is the typical size for Filipino 
uh maybe 43 43 yeah so you think many people  
can wear 43 43 44 what what's your size uh for 
me is 43 43 okay so I'm just trying to figure  
out what's the typical size for Filipinos cuz 
yeah these shoes are not for uh actually I like  
the the black ones here so these are these are 
650 only 600 600 yeah okay what's the the last
price let's see if he gets down of it what's the 
best price you can give me 500 500 how about four  
400 no 400 cannot last price 500 but for two 
not one right this one one pair one pair one  
pair I had it before that I was negotiating for 
shoes what color you want and then he said oh  
the price is for per shoe so you have to buy 
two obviously and then it's double the price  
uh actually this one is also nice oh I like this 
one can can you hold this for one second I want  
to just test it I think good quality yeah yeah 
actually they seem to be uh very all right 500  
okay I give you 500 you give me 500 yeah and you 
have 600 I give you 500 500 from 600 down to 500  
okay and you have 43 for this one 43 43 yeah so

of Jordan with the 23 Michael Jordan he also 
has the the KN Air Max here actually I also  
need a choose new ones pretty soon these are from 
Adidas 43 only 45 what about this one here that's  
the the second one for this one for you no no 
not for me ah no more 45 43 what size is this  
one which is 45 45 yeah or 46 even no 45 uh I 
think that's too big I need I need smaller so  
then we we can't take the one that's my favorite 
okay then this one here you have this this one in  
43 yeah yeah yeah then let's get the classical 
black one I think we can't go wrong with that  
one would you wear a shoe like this in this color 
I think I would not wear a color like this very  
unique and outstanding color right not sure if I 
would wear this probably not oh you even have the  
proper Nik boxes here yes oh where do you get 
the shoes from they have a deal here you have  
like a like a wholesaler oh okay okay and then 
you buy from the wholesaler yeah and then you  
sell here we are how much you buy them for it's 
deing for your you buy more you get discount of

so you buy them directly from Vietnam or you buy  
from from somebody here [Music] they he he has 
a local wholesaler here in the Philippines so
