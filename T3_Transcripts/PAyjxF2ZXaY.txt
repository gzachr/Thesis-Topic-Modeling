[Music]
God I want to see what's going
on
oh holy [ __ ] I know so you could definitely 
tell that it's a cell phone recording of a guy  
uh singing to his wife I mean the the title says 
it all right and uh he's Singing beautifully but  
I'm not even going to critique his vocal 
ability or his ability to sing I think he  
was just singing to his wife he did sing 
beautifully though he sang he had such a  
beautiful voice and he sang like with so much 
heart oh my God I'm not okay I'm not happy right  
now you guys not happy with you oh my God I mean 
definitely thank you so much this is a beautiful  
uh performance we didn't pause because it's 
just one of those performance where it's not  
even a performance it's just one of those videos 
that you just have to sit and watch in all and
obviously it broke Taylor
so be crying for so long after this I know I'm 
sorry I mean blame YouTube they're the ones that  
were commenting this stuff I know I can't believe 
how many requests we had for this oh do you want  
your heart to physically break inside and like 
you spend your last minutes on Earth crying your  
eyes out go watch this and it's such thanks you 
guys at a funeral it's such a beautiful display  
too right like the flowers the the whole the 
coffin I don't know why I'm thinking like wow  
that's a nice coffin well I know you said like 
you wanted the camera to pan so you could see  
like the crowd crying but I'm wondering if this 
is maybe something that you know he had like a  
moment alone like privacy maybe before or after 
the funeral like with his wife and this was like  
maybe taken then yeah we don't know I don't know I 
mean if I was in that crowd live and he was doing  
that I would interrupt him so many times by my 
freaking sobbing that he would be like okay I  
need you out I need you to go I need get out this 
is me and my wife yeah I feel like this is very  
like something that you would want to like more 
of a private moment yeah I think oh my God it was  
beautiful that destroyed me I do want to nitpick 
something oh I know one thing that I couldn't get  
over is why is he dressed like that not in like 
a tuxedo or a suit for his wife's funeral and  
then the cynic in me is like is this all staged 
like did he do this purposefully trying to cuz he  
could be just singing to a random person person's 
coffin just to make a viral moment you know what  
I mean I would really hope not I would hope not 
too but like you got to think he's not American  
so maybe it's not in his culture for them like 
maybe it's not typical for them to dress up a  
certain type of way for funerals like I have 
no idea or maybe it's the viewing before the  
funeral so maybe he just hasn't changed I mean I 
don't know I would really like to think that this  
wasn't just for views cuz that's super shitty if 
it was like one of those viral moment posts that  
later you turn out is like that's really just the 
son of the funeral homeowner and he's just like  
in a random thing singing to it yeah you know 
I could see I could see someone shitty enough  
to Stage something like this I'm not saying they 
did for sure I'm not I can see it as well also  
if I die first and you don't do something like 
that at my funeral I know you can't sing like  
that guy can no offense but I will haunt your ass 
every single day of your life you'll be dead you  
won't know I will know I will haunt you you'll be 
dead you won't know I will haunt you and you're  
a scaredy cat so I will make sure it is extra 
scaredy I'm not a scaredy cat yeah anyways you  
guys thank you so much for sharing this with us 
um I know it's been requested for like the last  
two weeks it's been blowing up our channel 
so sorry it took us so long to get to it um  
our Queen is very pregnant so we been uh kind of 
slow walking YouTube a little bit unfortunately  
YouTube's got to be sacrificed when it comes to 
this stuff so anyways thank you guys so much for  
watching let us know down in the comments what 
you think and we'll see you in the next one bye
