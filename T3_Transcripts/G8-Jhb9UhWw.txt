The Philippines and the Filipino Hospital
To the average Australian, going to the hospital
is a bit of a last resort.
Not talking about turning up at
the Accident and Emergency when you slice
your finger open and it's 3:00am.
I'm talking about an
illness leading to you being admitted for
something.
How often does it happen to the average person?
I'm going to take a punt and say not that
often.
I know for myself that it's a pretty unusual
thing, and
same for most friends and relatives over many
(many) decades of life in Australia.
Except for accidents
and having babies, most of us don't turn up
there very often at all.
Me?
* Tonsils and adenoids at 10 years old (as
they did commonly back-then)
* A couple of nights in the outpatients 15
years ago when I had a couple of bouts with
kidney
stones
That's it for me!
My kids?
Never (apart from a few cuts needing stitches).
Ex-wife?
Two babies born.
Most people I
know/knew?
Never, or maybe once.
Those 60+, yes it gets a little more common.
Again, talking about
the average person in Australia here.
However, if you're involved in an Australian
Filipina relationship, expect that you will
soon be faced with
the issue of your lady or one of her relatives
being admitted to a Filipino hospital.
Hospital stays for Filipinos
Doctors in the Philippines seems somehow fairly
enthusiastic about sticking you in the hospital
for
reasons an Australian would consider a bit
mild.
It means expense and it means disruption.
Yet it
happens all the time, and I've recently been
thinking about this and wondering why.
I have a few
theories, which I'll get to as we go along.
I'll just explain a few characteristics, which
may or may not get
me into trouble with any Filipino nurses reading
this.
Nurses in Australia?
In Jeff Harvie's opinion, the absolute salt
of the earth.
Big hearts, and hard workers.
Highly capable, and worthy of respect.
Wonderful human beings doing a fantastic job.
Instincts better
than some of the doctors.
Dealing with miserable patients, screaming,
horrible smells etc all day, yet
keeping a smile and a sense of humour.
The doctor comes and sees you for a few minutes,
and the rest
of the time it's the nurses that take care
of you.
Nurses in Philippines?
Horribly underpaid, and many need to work
for one year in a hospital for
free....yes, no salary....in order to get
the work experience to get their license to
work (licensure).
Not a
whole lot of incentive to work like a saint,
I can admit.
However, I can almost wonder what some of
these people actually DO there.
They sure as hell don't seem to spend much
time taking care of
patients!
You go to the hospital without a steady rotation
of relatives to actually take care of you
and I
don't know what would come of you.
Relatives doing the nursing!
Yes, the supply and removal of bedpans, washing,
feeding, mopping of
fevered brows.....this is done by relatives,
who organize themselves around the clock to
ensure that the
patient is never alone.
They are also the ones who need to go and
purchase medicine when directed,
and who have to remind nurses to replace IV
fluid bags.
Nurses may come and take temperatures and
blood pressures from time to time, and that's
about it.
Standards of Filipino hospitals?
You get what you pay for.
Some are almost world-class, but others are
fairly woeful.
Something to take into account if, say, your
lady is giving birth in the Philippines.
Not a
time to be uninvolved!
Having said that, our nearest hospital is
5 minutes from the door.
My grandchild
was born there.
Excellent care.
Pediatrician in the delivery room.
And remarkably affordable.
Reasons for being admitted to a Filipino hospital
This is where I started.
If your blood pressure is very high, or if
you have a high fever, you may well end
up in the hospital.
We've had several of our kids end up there
over the years when the temp hits 40ï¿½C.
Although the last two times where the kids
(a 9 year old and a 6 month old baby) spent
the first nights
there unmedicated because there were no doctors
to see them and where the nursing staff took
their
temperatures at 4 hour intervals, the next
time we decided to keep the child at home.
Mila and I
provided better nursing care.
And when I've had a couple of bouts of cellulitis
in my leg I resisted the
suggestions to be admitted and recovered quite
nicely right here.
Our relatives in the province?
Seems to be someone admitted every couple
of months for something or
other.
Hard to keep up.
Yes, the cynic in me realizes that if most
of the hospitals in the Philippines are owned
privately by
Chinese families, it's fairly obvious that
doctors are going to be encouraged to admit
as many patients as
possible.
Quite the opposite to Australia where the
public hospitals don't have the space to fit
kids with
fevers and grandmas with hypertension.
Of course they want money.
These are businesses!
Other thing?
Not everyone has comfortable homes and the
ability to take care of sick people very well.
If
the house is cramped, hot and dusty and the
bed is a mat on the floor, then the hospital
is a better
alternative.
And where the family may save money on medicine
and may get the mang hilot (quack
healer) in to treat you with efficascent oil
and some dubious advice instead, more reason
to get the
patient to the hospital.
Oh, and of 
course you can expect a whip-around for money
next time someone is in a Filipino hospital.
No one can ever pay the bill themselves.
You can also expect a hospital bill to be
itemized down to the
pair of latex gloves and 3 cotton buds.
