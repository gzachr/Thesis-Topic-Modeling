 What's up Philippines! Welcome to another reaction video on our channel I am Mike. I am Nelly, as you guys know. We are two travel food and lifestyle vloggers best here in Makati city. That was a change to the opening Nelly bit more professional. Oh my god, sorry. What if Germans would say no? No, no, that's not going to be it. Anyway guys, today we are reacting to a very funny video from a channel that we have reacted to videos already in the past. Nelly, what are we reacting to? We are reacting to a video saying what is it like to have a Filipino grandma? Hmm, sounds like it could be very humorous. Guys, before we get started with this video, if you're new around here, I definitely check out our main channel making it happen vlog, which is linked right here. We have created a staggering amount of travel food and lifestyle videos from the Philippines. And also we have filmed close to 200 videos during quarantine. So if you're setting the same boat as we are, feel free to watch us. It's been long right? It has been a while. Alright, so let's jump into the video. Okay, yes. My goodness, what are you doing? We've had this couch for a year. No, no. What's the matter? The control has plastic issue. I don't know what you're doing. We have... Why are you watching the dishes? We just had takeaway. Nelly, they're still here. Oh, this is my friend, Kaylyn. Hi. Okay, Lennon, was she so pretty? No, we're just friends. Oh, no, I could tell he likes you, Kaelan. Guys, look alike. Oh, that's a compliment. Oh, Oh, sorry. Oh, thank you. $1,000? Oh, I'm leaving. I'll be back in a minute. I'll be... Okay, this is something that we also have in the Bosnian culture where we respect the Aldeleys, but not with a monopod. It is just like a thing where we talk to the Aldeleys and they kind of, every time they leave when they visit, they kind of give you some extra money for some sweets. Are you right here? Lola, why are you cleaning? I just cleaned the house. It was still dirty. Are you cleaning the vacuum cleaner? No, the controller. My back greasy hands. My guess. Yeah. Disco. Oh, I guess... Come on, calm down. It's not working. Okay, why gotta go? Try this. Is this a fork? Lola, what are you doing? It's 5'3". I'm going to have breakfast for you. No, I'm going back to bed. Hey, we still have to break. Come on. Oh, Nabilian, are you sick? Yeah. Here's the cure. No, no. Hello. I don't have grandparents anymore, but it's so nice to see, you know, grandma behavior and my cousin's grandma actually gives me food every time we come and visit and she just keeps feeding me and every time I'm finished with one meal, she brings me another meal and then I'll say, oh, thank you, but I'm not hungry anymore. She's like, you haven't eaten anything. So why, like, he's more, eat more, try more. Sorry, they're just keep feeding you. Fix. Oh, oh, it burns. I eat more. I'm not hungry. Go, Marquian. You're like a professional. Oh, my grandson's the next role, the elder. I'm not hungry. Oh. I'm not hungry. I'm not telling you anything. I'm not hungry. Oh, I'm not hungry. Oh, my, it's silly everywhere. I'm not hungry. I'm not hungry. I'm not hungry. I'm not hungry. I'm not hungry. Hey, what are you saying? Oh, I just can't sleep. I don't know where you're not. You bet that close to your eyes, that swung's going to get you. Really? Yeah, you heard this out. I got him. I'm going to bed. Okay, don't get me. Hey, Lola, can you make me some food please? I'm crocheting. Make it myself. Hey, no, no, no, no. Hold this. What is this? It's here, it's the way in there. What color is this? Thank you for having me. Who made it? You saw it? You're famous. No, but I'm on a diet. Okay. Okay, fine, I'll eat it. Hey, the man done done. What is done? What you can tell to it? You call yourself my god. Look at this little song. Oh, my god. What you guys doing? What is that? Oh, it's okay. It's okay. Oh, my god. This is my favorite one. I can't. It's so charming. That's funny. Yeah, very cute. Very cute, very funny. Oh.
