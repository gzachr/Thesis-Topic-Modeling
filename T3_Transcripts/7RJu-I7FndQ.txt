 But you're Friday. The freshest. Okay, so we're back with more TikToks that you have tacked me on. Yes, since the previous one, you guys have explored it, but let's just TikTok with recommendations. Stuff, so we'll put on a vacation of the fucking Philippines, proving it's the land of the unfairness of singers. Of the unfailing, maximum. Okay, I don't know. Yeah, yeah, yeah, thank you, thank you. But this is more Filipino singers that you've probably never seen just absolutely blasting the shit out of a karaoke or in-a-man sessions, which is when they're pretty much drunk. Or you've probably seen some of this because they've gone so viral. So let us, I mean, let's have a look. Oh, by the way, people have asked if you want to send videos to Bali. Yes. Just go to a TikTok. Or I guess people do also reels, right? So also on Instagram, yes, but it's both, both platforms in the same handle as WLSK15. So yeah, you can just fan me on both. You've finished up whatever you want. Don't blow my mind. Get ready, Fad, this one's wild. But it in a man, which I think means pre-being drunk session. Pre-drunk, I love the pre-drunk situation. Let me show you. Show you. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Come on, man. What's your name? I love when we both sing along. It's got a camosque. Aton Belay, you must come here, haven't you? Oh, that is coming out. Man, listen, listen to the fact that this guy has the most relaxed jawline I have ever seen is so. He's literally unbuttered. Tito, how do you heal a broken heart in one of the gums? And you know, this is it. Oh, baby, I'm out of my mind. Oh, yeah, I'm out of my mind. Oh, that's the number one song. Search, go to Google, how can he love broken heart? This guy comes up. No, you must. You must. This is it. Right. You go to a travel website. You get a ticket. I get a ticket. No, no, no. Just go there for a couple of days. Get, you know, record the fact. And I'll get really drunk and get on the karaoke. And that's how you feel about it. You'll come back a brand new person. Trust me. The Filipinos will grant you the wish of healing the magical beings. They're not normal. I take, it's impossible that the Philippines is just another country. Just a land. It's just land. It's a fire, fire. Fire. Fire. This is so abnormal. It is so amazing. And people just don't understand it. Because, you know, people in the comments sometimes are like, yeah, this is, you know, unbelievable. But it's like, this is everyday. But no, no. It's beyond unbelievable. No. That guy, it's like beyond prostanded. And he's just chilling there with a cheap microphone. He's a no one. No, no, no. He's lame. He just has a job. So there next one here we go is I think it's Kevin Brakenia I think that's his name and yes Oh Oh Is that falsetto? No because he was full full full That felt like it sounded like full full full that is that is absolutely completely total belt But when you ask you know like for example, it's just it marked me like when we spoke to Calo He was like no that the reason my voice sounds like that like so her bitch and it sounds like the female voice is because it's all falsetto So I'm not it. That's not it. That's full that was a belt. He was belt. Yeah, but that is not a full set Or does not the head voice? Yeah, that's not no no man that is full full full it's just how does he do that? I saw like Maracelito does that as well, right? I don't know how they do that I just have no idea and somebody somebody Explain it trying to explain it to you asking that is that a head tone? No, it's not that's that's not classified as a head head tone or whistle or whatever register none. I know this is proper building full-fold completely body anchoring All energy so I guess it's just his larynx flexibility It's just outstanding absolutely outstanding with but somebody explain it to me and some's like somebody I think it was kind of funny the comment and I was like I Wish it was that easy say that Somebody said to me whatever you ask why do like men and Filipinos can do this. It's like gay. They can be gay I'm like that doesn't explain it though like because obviously when you wait there is that They they change so there they're accustomed to changing the the larynx to a thinner fold to like a higher Tonality in the larynx so you shift technically speaking you can do that so you lift your larynx and you can be at Custom to that positioning so when it comes to singing is actually not effort because you constantly speak in that setting But you can also reach the lower setting too, but you're constantly executing Larynx flexibility exercises in your daily life. So I suppose that could be a good Explanation but it still is like it's still outstanding and there are men out there that can do that That's not this is more a sense original You know like this is one of those iconic songs that girls struggle to sing That got 21,000 lights holy shit my god Kevin get all the Well, oh show Kevin some love. This is this absolutely insane and same. Okay next one is next Hey That's famous It's too easy for her I can hotels Wow, she's got vibes Okay, here we go Here we go Oh, fuck What That is the best thing I've ever seen.

Like, it was nobody's business. Like, this was just a normal day. Chilling what he's stomach. So clean. Singing with his fucking chin like that. I don't ever swear. But that made me angry.

It's ragged down hold. It's ragged down hold. Look at that. It's ragged down hold. It's ragged down hold. Then it disappears out. It disappears out. It's ragged down hold. It's ragged down hold.

Everybody recording? See this book, see this book right here. What what is it doing? Playing bingo. See this book right here? This is the book of songs. This is the book of songs. A book of songs? Yes. So you think you go ahead and somebody explain it to me kindly and I was like, oh my god. And then I also saw a few movies that I've been watching, Philippine movies, banging. Every time you say a people like when's the revenue dropping? Alright, so there's a control remote and it has a bunch of numbers right? And then you press the code number from the song book and the song comes up and it puts it in a queue. So you have to wait in bars, in bars though. And sometimes the way it's like so long and you're watching all of these people sing, well, you're getting drunk. So by the time you go to actually think you're actually gone. See, so that's sort of the book. Now, the book of songs. Now can you add any songs to this machine? I think they're already pre-proper programmed. They have like all time classics. Yeah, basically. And that's why certain songs that were very popular in the 80s, still banging today. Okay, like six minutes six. Yes, my man. They have the fire start, I think. Look at that cigarette in a shed. And we got the lyrics. No, that's the, he's just beginning the next song. Yes, that was so clean. And they're just sort of, yeah, but let's hang out. Let's do a bit of a hangout. Essentially, they're more drunk you get. Everyone wants to sing anyway. And then Pam, he just does that. He's fucking unreal. Oh, what a fuck. What's the next one? Mariel. Mariel. This is Ben Amber.
