 Oh! Filipino street food. People are trying it and it's not us. Yeah. Are you kidding me? We got this video requested on our Instagram. Someone DMed us and was like, you should do this too. Yeah, so we're doing it. And I see a lot of loot in the title. Oh no, how do you afraid? They sell that on the street. People are just like, hey, Embryl, what's up? And then it's like, oh, give me. Here you go. Mm, thanks. Didn't even take up the shell. No, or you just like make a small incision for you and then you just suck it up. I mean, it's pretty impressive to suck to the whole like, it's very big. It's very impressive. Yeah, very impressive. Anyways, we might hear like, and then like a week or so, I would think, go to, there's a Filipino restaurant in St. Paul. In a grocery store as well. Yeah, the Filipino viewer, or I guess Filipino American viewer, from St. Paul, I believe you said, that told us that that was there. So we looked it up on Google and, boom! We found it. And it looks very intriguing. I'm excited to try some of that stuff. We saw Hollow Hollow. Mm, so. Yeah, so if you're out there watching, let us know what the exact name is because we think we found it. Yeah. It seems like they had Hollow Hollow and the Dope-O and all this stuff, but we'll probably be checking that out soon. We're just gonna go on a road trip. Just a little, one hour road trip. All right, let's do this. Let's see what these people think of it. So then we know what to think of it because they know their opinions are valid. I don't trust that guy. Oh my god. Wait, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Oh. In the mental part of experiencing a new destination and if they were in culture and staying more trying for the Filipino street food, ooh, oh, yeah. Oh, that's all good. Yeah! Woo! Pretty much all street food is served with an array of sauces inside. So, you know, we've got a platter of vinegars, chilies, and sauces. Wow, they're just saying we're gonna watch the loot. They look like little dough balls. Is this fish? Oh, I thought that was an egg. Oh, it might be an egg. This is the real streets, bro. Okay, quail eggs. So fried quail eggs. Quail egg. With flour. Flour. Fried quail eggs. It's like, oh, that does sound far. Never had a quail egg. Many white guy tourists making these videos. This video is giving culture. There's that guy. We've always seen his videos to react to for like street food stuff. And his are so long, yeah. You're like half an hour. So we're like, oh my gosh. Quick, quick, is it tempered all like Filipinos street food made by deep-frying orange battered covered hard boiled eggs? I'm going to be like, oh, that's gonna be good. Without the sweetened sour sauce. I'm gonna do one naked and then do sauces. Do one naked, one naked. So, I'm like, oh my god. I'm like, what's that? Yeah, exactly. Just a hard boiled egg, right? On first of all, I've never had... Oh, good. I've got fried egg and it's fire. Fire, okay. Ooh, this is really good. This is really good. This is not horrible. I just don't like boiling. Is it my favorite texture? That's me inside of us. I like the texture. I like the yoke in the middle. I was like, I'm filming, no, they get into me. Man's finished the entire thing. No. That's how populated it is. It's some more white guys' own sort of thing. But remember, it looks so cool. Ooh. It's chicken intestines. Do you think this one's chicken intestines? Oh. How big can they be? Two chickens are so small. Yeah, what am I seeing this? I've seen this before. I haven't tried it. Whoa, it looks like an intestines. Ah! I can't believe it. It's like a tube of chicken. I'm gonna assume it's pretty chewy. Beautiful. It's gonna taste like the dookie in my intestine. Don't, don't, don't, don't. This is my moment of truth, right? Grilled skewers. That's the scary thing about intestines. It was just like, there was poop in there. There was poopy in there. There was poopy in there. There wasn't. I don't know if I could eat it. The little peans in often called peony barbecue. Esau or grilled intestines is one of the most sought after dishes at street markets. And I know why. Is good? Is good. We also have some barbecue chicken for you. Yeah. Oh, it's okay. You smell some intestinal. It smells like a walking past the flamingo exhibit. What? It's very oddly specific. It followed me. Oh, is that good? Hell yeah. It almost tastes like sausage more than chicken. It's like hot. Not the flavor of the texture. What a sausage on the outside. It has a smoky, grilled flavor. Like barbecue. I just think it's that way. I'm gonna stick it in. Ooh, that's what I know. It's just the outside of the intestine. I like sausage. So yeah. This was literally wrapped up in the way it is now. I think just the fact that you know it's chicken attestin makes it weird. Exactly. I think it's not as detested like our now. Yeah. I really thought like what if an alien came out of it? Killed us and then it was doing food review videos. Oh my god. I think any food that has a like a valve at the end of it is a little off-putting. Yeah, this is my first time, but not my last. What is this? Intriguing. Deep vibes, deer going on. Oh, lumpia. Okay. Lumpia. Not sure what this is. Oh, lumpia. Oh, bro, this is gonna be fire. This looks different. The ones I've had have been more like deep fried. Yo. Whoa, that's a big one. This looks more like a burrito. Yeah, usually the video is where you see lumpia's fried. So this dish is called lumpia un uboad and it's known in the heart of Palm Spring Roll. It consists of julienne uboad or heart of Palm with various meats and vegetables in it. In England. An egg crate. I caught about half of that. I don't know how to eat this. I don't know who that can be. Yeah. That. It's kind of like a burrito. Yeah. Oh, the good. Say no more. Healthy. This is pretty good. It tastes like a type of salad just racked up. I was a little spicy. That's a great description. I really like the sauce. I don't know why I feel about this. I would love that it was like deep fried. The outer taste is a little fishy from my taste. Fishy. No, it's a messy. It's a messy thing. I will say it's like a healthy option. I'm a street food because a lot of the street foods are super greasy and oily. Now we're moving on to one of those commercial and some of the things ever. Oh, my loot. I don't know how you're gonna feel about this one. I don't know how I feel about this one. I'm gonna show this. Oh, do you know what this is? No. It's an egg. Oh, that's the right egg. Oh, that's the right egg. Mm-hmm. Dude, my stepdad offered me $100 to try it and I didn't even try it. Oh, I still have a lot to do to try it. You want to try it? You're excited about this? My heart is racing right now. No way. Oh, no. You can see it's feathers. Hey, no, baby chicken. You're the champion. Oh, my gosh. No. No. No. Oh, no. It's Philippines. It's like a dobo. I want to eat you so bad. Hello, hello. Balloons. I do not want to eat you. No. Dude. I cut it. I don't know if I can do it. Like everything up and so about loot in like all the food videos, I'd be curious to like take a little nibble of it. But I don't even know about balloons. Like, take a nibble. Oh, it was just a soft pudding. Ah. Not well right now. I'm curious to see what they think. Let's be gigantic in like person, bro. Yeah, I want to try it. But I don't think I'm going to like it. I'm kind of nervous. I'm confident right now, bro. But I don't know if I'm going to eat first. Oh, it's warm. So, the loot is a fertilized egg embryo that is boiled. Ah. Get that eaten from the shell. It's very commonly thrown in street food and is considered a delicacy in Southeast Asian countries. And man's made it look so easy. Yeah. Real fast. My dison. It's wet. She's eating the shell. It's like a hard boiled egg in the morning. Except it's a duck. Oh my goodness. Am I about to drink this? Mine. Wait. I was really not that bad actually. Is it not? OK. It tastes like egg soup. Egg soup? Oh my goodness. It's good. Whoa. Look at that. That's insane. The texture has to be terrible for the faint. I don't think it's anything for me, bro. Oh my god. It's a whole bird. It's gone. Interesting. They're white. I can see why people eat it. The yolk is really creamy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh my gosh. Yep. Dude, it's a whole bird. I guess we need to eat this. That's so cool. This is like a science experience at the same time. That chicken. I love you. Oh no. I'm kidding. No, that's not going to happen. Maybe kiss it. I pulled off the leg. Well, no, I got to do it. It tastes like chicken. How'd you actually not bad, bro? OK. You got it. You got it. Do you have a crunchy taste? Oh. I'm doing a perfection. Sea sex. Cheers. No, what? Actually, I tried it in the way worse. That's the funny stuff. See, Grandpa? I think I felt like more sad. It was like soft meat. I thought you were a goner, and you just bled this great. It just seems like everyone overrated before. This is probably what we're doing. A boiled egg. I'm actually really glad that I tried this. I don't want to eat this. Banana. Banana. It is. I've seen that. We're texture people. Yeah, I am very texture people. We ate this thing in Italy. It was like the local delicacy, or I don't know, one of our vlogs that will probably come out soon. It was just this little ball of uncooked cornmeal. It was just kind of like this. And I was eating it. And it tasted bad. It had no flavor, basically. But I was going like this. Because it would like, the way it would mush in your mouth, and it would turn into sand, and I was going, I was like gagging, because it felt so weird in my mouth. Yeah, it just like ate it. So I don't know how I would do with feeling like bones and... Yeah, like everything. Yeah, that's one thing I hate about eating fish sometimes that people just caught. They don't like filet them right, and then you eat, and then you hate ballin', and it's like, Yeah, I don't know. I'm scared. I'm scared. I know it's going to happen eventually. It's going to happen eventually. Ha-ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha! Come on. But I mean, based off the reactions, I can't imagine it's going to be terrible. It just, I don't know. I don't like it. I don't want to eat the little thing. And I know I'm going to like, we're going to try the intestine thing too, I'm sure. And I just, oh, I'm scared, but I'm intrigued. Yeah, same, same ball. I agree. I'm going to do this. It looks like rice. Ooh! Tiramisu. I've seen this. It's so good. Wait, I'm excited. This looks good. Yeah, I think this is going to be good. I like that sauce. Anything fried. And they're doing this on the street. Oh, bro. Oh, I'm eating so good. First off, this is actually good. It's so good. This looks good. It's like, um. So, bananas, jackfruit, sweet potatoes, and coconut are some common fillings for sweet fried spring rolls called tuna. And today, we have an ube tuna for you to take. Ube tuna. We have a bulgoyama originally from the Philippines. And it's very popular ingredient for both its color and light sweet flavor. So is this like a more dessert? Fooders are more just like a fruity side. I don't know. This is my favorite. It's good. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. It kind of tastes like a pie. Very sticky. I like the christ Hagant sign this is like a secret treasure. Mmm. So bomb. This is top tier. Tout have a tank. Perfect, a Tex. Take everyone like that. recession up tendant red comes from. It's kind of a moetenep obliterate relative. I like the sound of mentee, vanilla. Woah. That consistency was not what I was expecting. It's like the anti. Itstate eight. Been or something. Yeah, like yogurt. So surprising. OK. We surprised. I'm excited. Wait, that's so cute. Mmm, okay. Bucco Pondon is a very popular Filipino dessert made using young coconut, Pondon, leaves, and Sago Pearl. It has a unique and delicious flavor. Interesting? Okay. So we probably have no clue what this is going to taste like, basically. Oh my god. This is good. It's super interesting. This is so odd. But it's like yummy. Oh, this is really good. It's very sweet. And very sweet. And like, a little like jello part is so good. Yeah, I love the texture. I loved the taste. I hated how it fell in my mouth. It is, right? And I'm not usually a meat person. This has a unique flavor. It really does. Yeah. It is a little missing, a little vanilla. Vanilla, banana, and green. Oh, this is really good. There's a lot of good stuff out there. Oh, you've got it. That seems good. I will try to forget. And some things I will try to remember to get. I need to get out more. Thank you guys so much for watching. What other things should we try next time? OK, that was a good little review there. Yeah. We got to see people actually eating the food. Like normal people that aren't professional eaters in travel. Yes. Aren't professional eaters or aren't people who are eating these before? Yeah. Like, it's their first reaction to it. Very, very curious for some of those stuff. I'm so scared. I don't know why. We've seen some really weird foods from other countries too. And it's kind of like, OK. But the loot is scary to me. Yeah, I don't know if it just like stigma around it. I can probably. Probably. I mean, it's probably good. I like eggs. I like boiled eggs. I like normal. I like the yolk. I like when the yolk is running in it. So I don't know why I won't like it. Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting. Other than that. I think I would, because I mean, I'm pretty sure all these, I would at least try. But, um, the loot in particular, like you said, it's like, hmm. I think I'll threaten length like when they eat like a bug or something. I mean, they do it so it's purposely gross. Yeah. But I feel like like when I got to the actual duck part, I'd be like, just crunching that thing away to leave. You're just like trying to not think about it. I don't know. It's just weird to us. I mean, we've noticed in a lot of the Southeast Asia food videos we've done recently that like intestines, like a lot of the organs are used in a lot of the food. And, um, at least in the US for sure, that's very uncommon. Definitely. So we have no like experience of that. We don't know what it tastes like at all. No. So it's a bit foreign to us. Yeah, definitely foreign. But I'm excited to go with Philippines. We need to open. So just open it. Go tell whoever runs the border. Just be like, hey, open it up. Let try it. Just try it. Just try it a minute. Thanks so much to everybody. Hopefully you enjoyed it. Subscribe if you did. Like the video if you did. reassurance that balloon isn't scary in the comments below. They feel like last time we said stuff about that. Some people said it was awful and some people said they like it. Yeah, definitely. It was definitely pretty split. OK. A lot of people are like, I would never eat that. Yeah. See you later. Bye.
