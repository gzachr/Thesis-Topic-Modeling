So, for today's video, the video that I will be reacting now is the country boss history of the Philippines. So, credits to the video uploader of the video that was being uploaded here on this reaction video. So, guys, before we start, I just want to tell you a story about here in the Philippines. In our school, the history of the Philippines was taught to us. And they also share what's the first history of the Philippines. Where did the Philippines come from? What is the history of the Philippines and et cetera? So, without further ado, let's start this video. 67,000 years ago, first human's arrive in the Philippines. 67,000 years ago, first human's arrive in the Philippines. While the Philippines don't eat. Oster nations arrive to the Philippines islands. The Philippines are on age. And let's do it, guys, terraces. Stubbed Shmer of Kingdom of Tondo. The Kingdom of My, Rage of Naked Oaks of U. Where do we go? The Philippines is not united. It has several kingdoms in its lands. But until the Kingdom of Spain has arrived here in the Philippines. The Spanish colonialism is kind of bad for us. Filipino, but... Marjapai, Luzon War. So, some Filipino netizens say that without Spain, the Philippines wouldn't be the country of the Philippines.

First repablig at war in solar, commoners like ants, comter, or maybe it's a war 50 repablig. So that's it guys. A few moments later. So guys, under 14 minutes and 17 seconds, there's a lot of information about the Philippine history. So majority of it is about wars, like fighting for other countries, like America, Spain, Great Britain, and Korea and Vietnam. But I need to watch this again and again in order for me to retain some information about it. And I will rate this video 10 out of 10 because some of the information we're not included in our school books, but it gains some information about me about the Philippines. And it's a really great, great video and kudos to the animator of this video. So guys, if you have enjoyed this video, please don't forget to like and subscribe to my YouTube channel.
