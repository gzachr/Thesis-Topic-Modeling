I'm going to bend you over
And no one will
stop me, you understand me?
I'm the underdog
You don't even know what you stepped into
You don't even know
This is boxing
But look at KSI
And it's Facebook
KSI is like, oh my god bro, you're so
cringe
And I salt papi
What that means?
First of all, I'd like to thank
God, my team, my brothers
and my dad for training me
for this event, and my coach
I thought that he was insulting
him, like you're salt papi
That's his
His name
I'd like to thank Hufflepunch Promotions
and Misfit Boxing, KSI
for giving me this opportunity
I'm very happy to be here
And for
I'd like to thank Andy Worske as well for taking
this fight. Respect
He can talk as much as he wants
But I let my
hands do the talking in the ring, like I do
If I were him, I wouldn't
even address him
I wouldn't even talk about him
I don't acknowledge you
You're invisible to me until
I have to fight you
Did someone just say something?
I didn't hear anything
Salt Papi, a final word
I just wish him a speedy recovery
Salt Papi
Salt Papi

Salt Papi
Social media has been taking over
the entertainment industry
It's also starting to make noise
in the professional sports industry
At a first glance
anyone could easily assume that this guy's
only talents are watching anime
and playing video games
This chubby Filipino dude is a living proof
Because he looks like a geek
or something
I see him and I don't immediately
assume he watches anime
Especially your difference
You're unique
That muscles alone don't win fights
but real talent and skill
Meet Nathaniel Bustamante
A.K.A Salt Papi
He was born and raised in Candelaria, Quezon
At age 14
he moved to the UK with his family
for better opportunities in life
He loved boxing ever since he was a kid
because of Manny Pacquiao
He used to engage in street fights
for fun in some of his vlogs
which are actually entertaining to watch
but he never really trained seriously
He worked as a nurse
in a mental health institution
He struck gold when his fake run challenge
on Tiktok went viral
His popularity skyrocketed
and he didn't stop there because he became
even more popular when he started uploading
videos of himself pouring salt
in the most ridiculous ways you could ever imagine
This is a Christian channel, please
This is when he earned his infamous nickname
He made his boxing debut in March of 2022
when he was given the opportunity
to match up against the English YouTuber
Halal Ham
Days before the fight
Salt Papi's opponent couldn't stop talking smack
Oh my god, that was so racist
I think he intentionally
wanted to be valiantly
offensive
offensive
because he clearly knows
he's Filipino
and he's gonna send him back to China
He just wanted to trigger him
Tonight, he made Halal regret
everything he said
The internet took notice because it was
three full rounds of humiliation
And he's got livered emphatically
What an entertaining performance
But at this point, Salt Papi
was only seen as some chubby guy
who beat another chubby guy
so he got matched up against a Twitch streamer
who was more fit and more arrogant
than the first one
I'm not coming in here to like
have fun
I'm coming in here to murder you bro
and that's what I'm gonna do bro
Is there an element of surprise
that you're worried about with Andy?
We haven't seen a lot from him
I've lost 10kg for this fight
I feel more conditioned, I'm gonna take him out in the first round
Oh yeah?
Really? First round?
Alright, Salt Papi in the black
How about Salt Papi to South Pole
A la Manny Pacquiao from the Philippines
Salt Papi on some of the best rounds
In the first round
Oh the fake round
The fake round
Salt Papi making a statement with that one
He's so black
He stayed true to his word
The internet then blew up as Salt Papi
violated every ounce of Andy Warski's ego
The matchmakers then wanted to see how Salt Papi
reacts when he gets tested
like really tested
So they matched him up against an American MMA fighter
Josh Bruckner
Oh wow, so they are just
giving him more difficult
Yeah, the challenge
This is a challenge
for him
But they're not doing this to any other person
So I personally feel offended
Yeah, but they just want to see
how good is this guy already
Is this really lock?
You know?
Was this lock or is this guy
really good at boxing?
It was looking like our guy didn't have a chance
because not only does this guy have a total
of 8 professional fights
but he was also bigger at 6'1
and stronger judging by his muscles
Come on, just take a look at the difference
But come fight night
This is where Josh should be excelling
He's the longer fighter
Should be touching Papi
What the?
I need to see this in slow motion
In slow motion, please
Way long
I cannot see well
It was with the other one
So since the guy was attacking
here, he was like focusing
on his punch and he didn't realize
that a punch was coming to his face
Already, yeah
Because he attacked with the left
You don't expect the person
to attack with the left, but with the right
So he's imitating
Manny Pacquiao
They are comparing him with Manny Pacquiao
because Manny Pacquiao doesn't move with the left hand
Ah, oh wow
That's amazing
Well, Pacquiao
is really his hero
Yeah
This was the fight when Salt Papi
gained the respect of everybody
Even the pros
Salt Papi
Won?
Salt Papi won?
Technically he was
and he seems like he understands boxing
at a higher level, so I would say Salt Papi
Also well deserved
He is so entertaining
so good, so sexy
He just seems like he gets everything
and he's understanding it and I think he's going to get better
This win catapulted him into the top
5 pound for pound influencer boxing
rankings along with big names such as
A.S.I and Jake Paul
Heck, some of them are even scared of him now
Now, well I'm just training
against all philox fighters now, so
No more southpaws, you know, people want me to fight
Salt Papi, it's not happening, okay
I can't get distracted now
Man, Ilocke feels good when people
fear us
Another Filipino who should be feared is Dave Bautista
Oh, not true
Isn't this the WWE fighter?
Yeah, he is
I didn't know he was Filipino
Yeah, he is
I didn't know you didn't know
I didn't know this, wow
And I always thought that he was
Mexican because of the
last name
Typical person
Oops
Ouch
He was born and raised in Washington DC
by his American mom and Filipino dad
who worked as a taxi driver and a barber
They lived a life of
poverty
Their home was located in a place where crime was a daily
routine
He once said in an interview that he had witnessed a total of
3 murders right in front of their house as a
kid
It didn't take too long for him to adopt a similar lifestyle
because as early as 13, he was already
stealing cars
By age 17, he started living independently
Working as a nightclub bouncer
But that job didn't last long
as he was arrested after a fight against
2 customers
One of them was rendered unconscious
He then got sentenced to 1 year probation
He then worked as a lifeguard
after that and at this time
he already had 2 kids and was struggling
to make ends meet
There was one time when he broke down in shame
and he had to borrow money from his co-worker
just to give his kids some Christmas gifts
His struggles continued until
he found bodybuilding and started going
all in into wrestling
which led him to develop a monstrous physique
and this didn't happen until he was in his
early 30s
This was him before
This was him after hitting the gym
Dude is almost unrecognizable
But despite his hard work
He was put in the
before picture
And I thought that he was the father
of Batista Hidalgo
Not Batista Aron
Oh yeah
Okay, okay
He tried out in WCW but immediately
got rejected and was told by one of their
pro wrestlers that he would never make it
in the pro scene
When one door closes, another opens
because this led him to get accepted to debut
in a much bigger organization
The WWE
From this point on, his career would
snowball as he carried the iconic
stage name Batista
He racked up multiple tag team and world title
belts and was able to share the ring
with legendary wrestlers like Triple H
John Cena
Rey Mysterio
and The Undertaker to name a few
This line of profession is very dangerous
So injuries weren't a stranger
to him
He decided to put it on hold and started
venturing into acting
As expected, a lot of people doubted him
again, but not for long
because he was able to secure a role in the
Marvel Cinematic Universe
After The Guardians of the Galaxy
Batista appeared in multiple
highly rated movies such as Blade Runner
2049, Dune
Endgame, Knockout the Cabin
and more
What I like about this dude is he never forgot about his
heritage. He's a loud and proud
Filipino. He is so proud
that he got the total of three tattoos
representing his Filipino roots
Now that's something to be proud of
Another big dude who is a very proud
Filipino is Brandon Vera
He was born and raised in Norfolk,
Virginia, but he also spent
But never heard of Soul Puppy either
and look how the story was
very inspiring
in Taggaway and Quezon under the care of his
Filipino dad and stepmom which explains
his fluent Tagalog
He even knows a lot about
Philippine history
A lot. My favorite one is the barong
Barong Tagalog pambansang kasuota
ng mga lalaki
Anong alam mo sa barong?
San galing nyan? Bakit?
San galing ang barong?
San ba galing ang barong?
So the history of the barong is always told
When the Spanish colonized the Philippines
they tried to make us wear clothes
kasi di ba, we were savages not wearing clothes
so pinusot tayo ng gamit
and then laging tago yung mga weapons
ng mga Pilipino
I guess the way that they fixed the problem was
they came up with a shirt
that was see-through, the barong
Tagalog
I didn't know that
This is very
This makes sense
They are smart
They are smart because
we
we have
something similar
that is chacabanas
but
Dominicans never hid their weapon
they had the machete
they had everything out
so Filipinos were hiding the weapon
they said ah you are not hiding
anything else transparent
see-through
Now let's see where you're gonna hide it
The tattoo on his back is also
noticeable
The letters are in ancient Philippine writing system
called baibayan
which reads mundo, hangin, apoy
and tubig
I love the boy avatar
Anyway, he excelled in wrestling in his high school days
which earned him a 4 year
athletic scholarship at Old Dominion
University
but he would later drop out as he wanted to focus only
on wrestling
He enlisted in the US Air Force and joined the
wrestling team but his career would be cut short
because he would suffer multiple torn
ligaments in his right elbow
This got him medically discharged by the army
Nothing seems to be working
in Brandon's favor but he never gave up
He rehabbed his elbow
on his own until he was strong enough
to enter the Grappler's Quest submission
wrestling competitions
He wasn't a coach or a trainer so this caught the attention
of Lloyd Urban
Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt and coach
who invited him to train with his MMA school
He later then turned pro
and went on to have an 8 fight
winning streak while finishing most of his
opponents with his signature kicks
and devastating knees
Though he didn't quite reach the goal to become a champion
in the UFC, he did become
one in one FC in a brutal
fashion by finishing all of his opponents
The guy
Ah, okay
he did it with this hand
Oh shit
But he was already 40
at the time and his age would start catching
up as he would lose against
Myanmar's online sang
In the present day, Brandon
Vera had already retired and moved to
the Philippines permanently
He also built his own gym called the Alliance
Training Center PH to help train
more young Filipino MMA talents
And speaking of talent, especially in combat
sports, who would ever forget to mention
Manny Pacquiao
Yes
Too much power, too much art
The fighting pride
of the Philippines
Manny
Manny
Manny
Pacquiao
Pacquiao
Pacquiao
Pacquiao
Pacquiao
Pacquiao
Pacquiao
Pacquiao
Let me tell you, that was just a quick
punch
Every time he fights, the country's crime rate
drops to 0%
He's a master not only inside
but also outside the ring
Manny, you have something very kind to say
about us to the people of the Philippines
Okay, hello Philippines
These people, they don't understand
Tagalog
They thought I was
praising them, but they
don't understand, that's why we can
praise them
The people of the Philippines
They don't understand
That's Manny Pacquiao
That's extremely moving
Thanks so much
Manny, we like that
Everyone loved Manny, even the biggest
celebrities, but before gaining
all that fame, he had to go through a lot
of pain because he was born and raised
in General Santos at the time of poverty
and war
At age 5, he'd already seen dead and decapitated
Bonnies
Military and rebel shootouts would happen
just a few meters away from their home
so his family had no choice but to leave
and settle in a nearby province called Sarangani
Manny's dad was
barely there for them so his uncle played
the role of a father figure
He started training Manny how to
box and also taught him how to fish
at a very young age to survive
He joined several amateur boxing
competitions and dominated all of them
But he wasn't earning enough because most of
what he got was just a bunch of trophies
and medals
Life was too hard that it came to a point that
Manny's dad butchered their own dog
just to have food on the table
This was Manny's wake up call so at age 16
he traveled alone to the city of Manila
to become a pro boxer
without letting his mom know because he knew
she wouldn't allow him back then
He made the gym his home and slept
in the ring every night
In Manny's first professional fight, he had
to lie about his age just to get in
He was a malnourished kid so he
put heavy objects in his pocket just
to make it into the flyweight division
which explains why he looked significantly
smaller than his opponents in his early fights
But despite the handicap
he still went on to dominate and
clean up the whole flyweight division
getting him all kind of bad in the process
In Desmond, Desmond didn't see this in the TV
Who knows if she watches this
or if they even had a TV or something
In spite of this achievement
Manny was still relatively unknown
to the world
Nobody knew him to the point that the
fans couldn't even read his name properly
But Manny's anonymity
would only last until this very night
He would then beat everyone in bantamweight
so he had to move up to featherweight
where he would earn the nickname
Pacman as he would devour
most of the mexican monsters in the division
It came to a point that nobody
in the featherweight division
even the lightweight division
was willing to fight him
not even the primary weather
So Manny was forced to move up
to two weight classes
Manny had to face his idol himself
Oscar De La Hoya
Their size difference was so noticeable
that Manny's countrymen got worried about him
There was even a bill that was passed
just to stop the fight from happening
But the fight still happened
and Manny shocked everyone
when he completely dominated
the much bigger fighter
and even made him give up
in round number 8
Manny then went down to weight class
to visit the lightweight division
to put Ricky Haddon to sleep
Then moved back up to welterweight
and proceeded to go on a rampage
against bigger opponents
One notable victim was Antonio Margarito
who was arguably the biggest fighter
Manny ever faced
What made this matchup interesting
was the drama leading up to the fight
because Margarito was so arrogant
and insulted Manny in multiple ways
But just like Saltpapi
Manny did all the talking with his fists
Oh my god
He looks unrecognizable now
Look how his face was changing
after all those...
And Pacquiao igualito
like nothing
Pacquiao always shoots to the face
Always
Pacquiao is the same
Oh my god
Is this really her
or is this an actress
I think this is a documentary
or a movie about her
something like that
let us know in the comments
So that's a paid actress
Yeah because these images are too HD
It looks too recent
Wow
Wow
Oh wow
Wow
She never gave up
It was like in 2020 or 2021
that she had her gold medal
Gold medal
She's very cute
She has her feet better now
Wow
126 kilos
Are you serious
Wow
That was tight
Yeah
Yes
Oh my god
Yes
Oh my god
Oh my god
This is too emotional
This is too emotional
Wow
Wow
Yes
Of the Philippines
Wow
Wow
I don't know
if you clap or not
They laugh or not
Why are we always so proud
Well the answer is simple
Because we believe
that our country's heart and soul
are its people
Yes I agree
That was very lit
I like this
Very lit la verdad
Especially about the history of the baron
Wow
Now your language
I learned a lot about
Filipino athletes
Filipino personalities
The story really moved me
Really moved me
That's a huge
achievement
It's not only a gold medal
It's also a world record
That's amazing
I didn't even know Batista was Filipino
I'm so surprised
I always thought
That was amazing
All my life has been in life
Maybe you should watch that video
That is about people who you don't believe
You don't realize
Are Filipinos or something like that
You know people have recommended this video
So we should react to that
