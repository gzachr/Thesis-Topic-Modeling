I think he intentionally wanted to be violently offensive because he clearly knows he's feeling beat. Yeah, yeah. And he's going to send him back to China. He just made a trick on him. Night, he made Halal regret everything he said. Oh, lovely, Lee Kanna. He definitely appreciate it. I want to see this guy fight again. The internet took notice because it was three full rounds of humiliation. But at this point, Salt Poppy was only seeing as some chubby guy who beat another chubby guy. So he got matched up against a switch streamer who was more fit and more arrogant than the first one. Oh, man. I'm not coming in here to like have fun. I'm coming in here to murder you, bro. I know something to do, bro. Is there an element of surprise that you're worried about with Andy, right? We haven't seen a lot from him. Of Los Thanqueji for this fight, I feel more conditioned and I'm going to take him on the first round. Oh, yeah? Really? First round? Alright, Salt Poppy in the Black about Salt Poppy to South Pole. Alam, man, he packed you out from the Philippines. Salt Poppy on some of the festivals. In the first round. Oh, the flagron. Salt Poppy making a statement with that one. They've waved it off the Philippines. One, two, three. Light him up for Salt Poppy. This man was talking about a fight with KSI earlier in the week and that is how he might get it. The fight was over in seconds and he stayed true to his word. The internet then blew up as Salt Poppy violated every ounce of Andy Warski's ego. The matchmakers then wanted to see how Salt Poppy reacts when he gets tested, like really tested. So they match him up against an American MMA fighter, Josh Brugner. Oh, so they are just giving him more difficult... Yeah, the challenge. This is a challenge for him. But they're not doing this to any other person. So I personally feel offended. Yeah, but they just want to see how good is this guy or is this really luck? You know? Was this luck or is this guy really good at boxing? It was looking like our guy didn't have a chance because not only does this guy have a total of eight professional fights, but he was also bigger at six foot one and stronger judging by his muscles. But come on, just take a look at the difference. But come fight night. This is where Josh should be excelling. He's the law of the fighter. Should be touching Poppy. What? I need to see this in the slow motion. In slow motion, please. Wait, Lang, I can see well. He was with the other one. So since the guy was attacking here, he was focusing on his punch and he didn't realize that a punch was coming to his face already. Because he attacked with the left. You don't expect the person to attack with the left, but with the right. Please, Robert, get it. He's in the cover! It's all over! Oh, that betrayed Rosalind! There was a manipack out left hand. Steps inside the guard. So they are comparing him with money pack out. Because money pack out does not move with the left hand. Oh, wow! That's amazing. Well, he's really his hero. Yeah. Inside the guard, you don't see that a lot. It's taking advantage of the inside lane and popping him. This was the fight when Soul Poppy gained the respect of everybody. But it's not that bad. This was the fight when Soul Poppy gained the respect of everybody. Even the pros. Who are the top three creator boxers right now? Soul Poppy. One? Soul Poppy won? Technically he was and he seems like he understands boxing at a higher level. So I would say Soul Poppy. Technically. He's so entertaining, so good, so sexy. He just seems like he gets everything he's understanding it and I think he's going to get better. This win kind of pulled him into the top five pounds for pound influencer boxing rankings. Along with big names such as KSI and Jake Paul. Heck, some of them are even scared of him now. Now, well, I'm just training against all of them. No more South Paws. People want me to fight Soul Poppy. It's not happening. Okay. I can't get distracted now. Man, Loki feels good when people fear us. Another Filipino who should be feared is Dave Bautista. No, no, no. Isn't this the WWE fighter? Yeah, he is. I didn't know he was Filipino. Yeah, he is. I didn't know you didn't know. No, I didn't know this. Wow. And I know it's thought that he was Mexican because of the last name. He's a cauld person. He was born and raised in Washington, DC by his American mom and Filipino dad who worked as a taxi driver and a barber. They lived the life of poverty. Their home was located in a place where crime was a daily routine. He once said in an interview that he had witnessed a total of three murders right in front of their house as a kid. It didn't take too long for him to adopt a similar lifestyle because as early as 13, he was already stealing cars. By age 17, he started living independently, working as a nice club bouncer. But that job didn't last long as he was arrested after a fight against two customers. One of them was rendered unconscious. He then got sentenced to one year probation. He then worked as a lifeguard after that and at this time, he already had two kids and was struggling to make ends meet. There was one time when he broke down in shame and he had to borrow money from his co-worker just to give his kids some Christmas gifts. His struggles continued until he found bodybuilding and started going all in until wrestling, which led him to develop a monstrous physique and this didn't happen until he was in his early 30s. This was him before. This was him after hitting the gym. Despite his hard work, he was put in the before picture before and I thought that he was the father of a sister and I am a mother. That's what he thought about it. Downed him. He tried out in WCW but immediately got rejected and was told by one of their pro wrestlers that he would never make it an approsi. When one door closes, another opens because this led him to get accepted to debut in a much bigger organization, the WWE. From this point on, his career would snowball as he carried the iconic stage name Batista. He racked up multiple tag team and world title belts and was able to share the ring with legendary wrestlers like Triple H, John Cena, Ray Mysterio and the Undertaker to name a few. This line of profession is very dangerous. So injuries weren't a stranger to him. After the Guardians of the Galaxy, Batista appeared in multiple highly rated movies such as Blade Runner 2049, Dune, Endgame, Knockout the Cabin and more. What I like about this dude is he never forgot about his heritage. He's allowed and proud Filipino. He is so proud that he got the total of three tattoos representing his Filipino roots. Now that's something to be proud of. Another big dude who is a very proud Filipino is Brandon Barra. He was born in Reyes and Northfolk, Virginia, but he also spent more than ever. But never heard of Sol Papi, the story was very terrifying. He didn't take away his cousin under the care of his Filipino dad and stepmom, which explains his fluent agalo. Brandon, you know, he's a Filipino. He's the most proud Filipino in Filipino. He's a very proud Filipino. He's a very nice guy. He's a very nice guy. But he's not a bad guy. Thank you. He's a very nice Filipino. He's a very nice son and his mom is a very nice guy. He even knows a lot about Filipino history. He's a very nice Filipino. My favorite one is the Barron. He's a very nice guy. What do you know about Barron? He's a very nice guy. He's a very nice guy. The history of the Barron is always told when the Spanish colonized the Philippines, they tried to make us wear clothes. Because they divide, we were savages, not wearing clothes. They were so nice to me. And then they put in a lot of different weapons of Filipino. They were so nice to me. I guess the way they fixed the problem was they came up with a shirt that was see-through. For you to see, if you wear clothes or if you're just a kid, the Filipino is a very nice guy. I didn't know that. This is very... it makes sense. Yeah. They're smart. They're smart because... We like... We have something more. Similar. Chavacanas. Chacawanas. But they're not... They never hit their weapon. They have the machete. They have everything out. So, Filipinos were hiding the weapon and they say, Ah, you're not hiding anything else. Transparency. We see through. No, let's see what you're going to hide. The tattoo on his bag is also noticeable. The letters are an ancient Philippine writing system called by Bayern, which reads, And he says, I love you, my dear friends. Anyway, he exiled in wrestling in his high school days, which earned him a four-year athletic scholarship at all the minion university. But he would later drop out as he wanted to focus only on wrestling. He enlisted in the US Air Force and joined the wrestling team, but his career would be cut short because he would suffer multiple torn ligaments in his right elbow. This got him medically discharged by the army. Nothing seems to be working out. He re-had his elbow on his own until he was strong enough to enter the Graffler's Quest submission wrestling competitions. He didn't have a coach or a trainer, so this caught the attention of Lloyd Irvin, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Black Belt and coach, who invited him to train with his MMA school. He later then turned pro and went on to have an eight-fight winning streak while finishing most of his opponents with his signature kicks. And never stating knees. No, he didn't quite reach the goal to become a champion in the UFC. He did become one in one FC in a brutal fashion by finishing all of his opponents. He has definitely been a flag in the world. Wow! How about the apples? I don't understand. I feel like the guy hit himself. The guy... Ah, okay, he did it with this hand. Oh, shit. But he was already 40 at the time, and his age would start catching up, as he would lose against Myanmar's online song. In the present day, Brandon Vera had already retired and moved to the Philippines permanently. He also built his own gym called the Alliance Training Center PH to help train more young Filipino MMA talents. And speaking of talent, especially in combat sports, would ever forget to mention Manipek out. He also has a case for a greatest fighter, pound for pound, whoever lived. The way he cried in the Philippines, Manipek... Fuck you! What's up, manipek? Oh, God, you're so nice! Yeah. And let me tell you, that was just a quick punch. Every time he fights, the country's crime rate drops to 0%. He's a master not only inside, but also outside the ring. Manipek, you have something very kind to say about us, to the people of the Philippines. Okay, hello Philippines. These are my friends. I didn't think they were going to fight. They were going to be a little bit more difficult, but they didn't think they were going to fight. So, we can see that they are going to fight. I don't know if they are going to fight. So, they are going to fight. That's money, too. That's extremely moving. We move. Thank you so much. Thank you. We like that. Everyone loved Manipek. He learned the biggest deliverance. But before getting all that fame, he had to go through a lot of pain because he was born and raised in general, son, at some time of poverty and war. At age 5, he'd already seen dead and he'd capitated bonnys. Military and rebel shootouts would happen just a few meters away from their home, so his family had no choice but to leave unsettling the nearby province called Sarangani. Mani's dad was barely there for them, so his uncle played the role of a father figure. He started training Mani, out of box, and also taught him how to fish at a very young age to survive. He joined several amateur boxing competitions, and dominated all of them. But he wasn't earning enough because most of what he got was just a bunch of trophies and medals. Life was too hard that it came to a point that Mani's dad but shared their own dog just to have food on the table. This was Mani's wake up call, so at age 16, he traveled along to the city of Manila to become a pro boxer without letting his mom know because he knew she wouldn't allow him back then. He made the gym his home and slept in the ring every night. In Mani's first professional fight, he had to lie about his age just to get in. He was a malnourished kid, and he had to have objects in his pocket just to make it into the flyweight division, which explains why he looked significantly smaller than his opponents in his early fights. But despite the handicap, he still went on to dominate and clean up the whole flyweight division, getting him into the process. In the month, the month didn't see this in the TV. Who knows if she watches this? If they even had a TV or something. In spite of this achievement, Mani was still relatively unknown to the world. Nobody knew him to the point that the announcer couldn't even read his name properly. Mani's anonymity would only last until this very night. He would then beat everyone in Phantomweight, so he had to move up to Federweight, where he would earn the nickname Pac-Man, as he would devour most of the Mexican monsters in a division. It came to a point that nobody in the Federweight division, even the lightweight division, was willing to fight him. Not even the prime may weather. So Mani was forced to move up to two-way classes. Mani had to face his idol himself, Oscar de la Hoya. Their size difference was so noticeable that Mani's countrymen got worried about him. There was even a build that was passed just to stop the fight from happening. You know, that fight was epic. I remember when I was a kid, that was heavily announced in Latin America. I don't. How do you feel like you have flashbacks? I was always there. It was everywhere. Everywhere. But I never watched the fights. I never really had to learn. I never knew. I was boxing. We are not into boxing. But every time I was in wrestling, that WWF. That's a big, detrimental to itself. It's something that's interesting. Because if you see a big man, fight him a small man. But the fight still happened, and Mani shocked everyone when he completely dominated the much bigger fighter, and even made him give up in round number eight. Mani then went down a way class to visit the lightweight division to put Ricky hadn't to sleep. Woo! Wow. Oh my god. Look how everything changed. Then moved back to Walter Wade and proceeded to go on a rampage against bigger opponents. One notable victim was Antonio Margarito, who was arguably the biggest fighter man he ever faced. What made us match up interesting was the drama leading up to the fight because Margarito was so arrogant and insulted Mani in multiple ways. Julian, who's you now? Pacio Margarito. Margarito. Marra. No, this guy. That's puto paquiao. Really? Because puto is not an insult for you guys. It's not okay. But just like Salt Pappy, Mani did all the talking with his fists. Wow, they combo my friend. Well, Margarito, my love. Margarito, I'm going to beat you. Woo! I'm going to beat you. And then Margarito. Speed down of a new line. Wait, there's 17 pounds on the right. He looks at the Recona. Look how his face was changed. Wow, but oh my god. Pacio Igualito. Pacio always shoot to the face. Always. Pacio is the same. No, I agree. Definitely full of interesting fights, but it would take hours if I had to share all of them. For now, let me just give you a perspective on the magnitude of his achievements. Mani is the only eight weight division world champion, and he has held a total of 13 world titles across all of them. This is a feat no boxer has ever done before. He made it into the boxing world fighting bigger guys, and retired fighting even bigger guys. He was the people's David against the world's goliens, and because of his legacy, he became an inspiration to many aspiring young athletes. And one of them was surprisingly a young woman, Hyde Videos. She was only nine when she got introduced to weight lifting by her cousins as they used to haul wood, which is a common thing in the provinces to gain extra money. She liked it instantly as she discovered that she was actually stronger than her cousins, which turned out to be boys. They also lived a life of poverty as her parents struggled to make ends meet. Hyde Lin was the fifth child. If you really hear or even think of this. Documentary or a movie about her, something like that, let us know in the comments. That's a paid ad 3. This image is art too. It looks too recent. At the age of 6, so his dad's income as a tricycle driver and a part-time farmer was barely enough to support them. She had to borrow shoes and uniforms for training and gladly took hand mean downs. Going to the gym was even a struggle for her because she didn't have money for fairs, so she had to sit on her friends' lap to avoid paying. Despite all the difficulties, Hyde Lin kept going and her hard work paid off as she got selected as the wildcard entry in the 2008 Summer Olympics in China, making her the first ever female weight lifter to compete for the Philippines in the Olympics. She was only 17. Making it to the Olympics was a good achievement, but winning it all was the ultimate challenge. In Hyde Lin's case, the gold eluded her for more than a decade and it eluded the whole country for almost a century. 97 years to be exact. Her journey was full of setbacks and crushing defeats, but there was one thing she didn't do. She never gave up. She never gave up. It was like in 2020 or 2021, that she had her goal. She has a very cute, she has a little bit of a fit better now. Over in Rio, Hyde Lin didn't get contented, so she kept training for the 2020 Olympics. She trained in Malaysia to prepare for the pandemic, happy. Her team got stranded in Malaysia for almost two years without training gym access or equipment, but instead of doing nothing, she kept training by using improvised tools such as heavy bags and water bottles. There was a point when they ran out of money and had to ask for financial help on social media, which led to her getting bashed by some fans, but Hyde Lin didn't let it get in her head and instead kept training. In the final moments of the competition, China set a world record of 126 kilos in the Clean Injure category. 126 kilos. Hyde Lin's last successful attempt was 124. And in order to win, she had to break the world record again by adding three more kilos to make it 127, which she never lifted in the past. That is almost 300 pounds, it's like lifting a batista. Oh my gosh. Time to get the record! She has it! Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! She did just that. Hyde Lin Diaz took home the country's first ever Olympic gold medal. Ladies and gentlemen, the anthem of the Philippines. Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh! Man, it kind of feels a little emotional there. Because you know, we are not known for our physical gifts. We are not the tallest people in the world. We are not the strongest either. Sometimes we lose badly, but we never see it as a disadvantage. We see it as a challenge to claim victory by improving our skills and talents even for them. We are Filipinos. We are a proud race. Sometimes it makes me wonder, why are we always so proud? Well, the answer is simple. Because we believe that our country's heart and soul are its people. Yes! I have to read. Hey! Hey! Hey! You are very lit. I like this. Very, very lit, la verdad. I really love this. Especially about the history of the world. Wow! No, you are a angel. I really love this. I love Filipinos. I love Filipinos. I love Filipinos. I love this. I really love this story. I really love this story. I really love this story. That's a huge achievement. It's not only a gold medal, it's also a world record. That's amazing. Yes. I didn't even know that this is Filipinos. That's right. I always thought that this is a Mexican. All my life has been in life.
