good morning we are currently still in Manila in 
the Philippines and today we're heading to pick up  
a car that we rented for a few days to explore a 
little bit more of Greater Manila and it's just over here
in our last video we headed to 
Chinatown and we ate loads of  
delicious things there'll probably be 
loads of food in this video again today  
probably because we just love trying 
lots of different things it's true
we reserved a car for today
thank you thank you
this is our new Nissan Almera it's definitely much 
smaller than the car we rented in Vientiane in Lao  
but Lao didn't have as good a roads as the Philippines 
does so I don't think we need a 4x4 vehicle I like the  
color I like the thing now that we've moved to the 
side a little bit because the car was packed right  
basically on the corner of that really busy road 
I'll show you properly this car that we've got  
today fully tinted windows literally all the way 
around never driven in nissan before in my life  
actually Nissan Almera I can't even tell you what 
engine size it is because it doesn't even say on  
the back that I know it's a petrol automatic which 
is handy I think most cars in Asia are probably  
automatic just because simpler to drive isn't 
it yeah I have no idea I'm not driving so yeah  
excited yeah can I show the inside yeah come on 
in hello it is much darker in here than it is  
outside because it's fully tinted I didn't 
realize how tinted they were until we got  
outside I had to do this to actually look inside 
so we are private in here it is very comfortable  
it has the whole Music Machine from last time 
yeah we've got the Bluetooth all of those kind  
of little things it is much smaller than the 
car we had last time but I think it'll be much  
easier to nip around where we are going because 
right now we are in Central Manila and you don't  
want a huge car driving around here because 
there's a lot of traffic it's time to drive  
around Manila now it's nothing like driving in 
Lao Lao there's barely any cars on the road so  
it's pretty chill here there's lots of cars 
head to the first place of the day shall we? yeah
kind of smooth okay good we're good wow all 
right we're good nice smooth drive actually  
for today we're not actually heading very far out 
of central Manila we're actually staying pretty  
Central because there's a couple of things 
that we've really wanted to do that we can't  
actually do without a car and one of them looks 
absolutely outrageous and I can't wait [Music]
how do you feel feels good there's a lot of 
traffic so I'm not moving very fast so it's  
not scary at all traffic is kind of calm as 
well so far so good I think I have to say as  
a passenger it's been very smooth so far I've 
been very comfortable after today like tomorrow  
and the day after we're heading much further 
out not crazy far away but much further out  
I'm quite excited [Music]  
it does look like Spain or Italy doesn't it yeah 
we have been walking around in BGC area before  
but I don't know if this technically is still 
BGC it looks almost fancier than BGC which I  
didn't think was possible so BGC it's like a 
really high-end fancy area loads of nice cafes  
shops businesses it looks very fancy we've 
been there for a coffee before and it was  
it was a fancy area and expensive yeah yeah 
with fanciness comes more expensive I think  
we're outside of BGC and we're now looking 
like what is in Europe essentially ah yeah  
we've arrived we're now at Venice mall is what I 
was trying to get at and it looks fancy [Music]
literally can't see anything through 
the front window it literally looks  
like we're in the night time yeah let me 
open the window show you how dark this is
check this place out shall we good job 
thank you you made it and survived [Music]  
before we turned into this car I 
missed the turning and it added  
about a half an hour to the journey 
just because of the traffic. I don't think its open yet.
what time is it 10:54 okay six minutes
we found the entrance did we 
no I don't think we did we were  
following them and they just turned 
around so let's follow them this way
it's the place that we're walking to that 
everyone's told us to go to to have a look  
at is called Venice Piazza it's meant to look 
like Venice the building itself actually looks  
a little bit I wouldn't say Venetian necessarily 
but it looks like French Spanish Italian yeah kind  
of style from the outside it's it's really pretty 
but I didn't realize how many shops they actually  
had in here because when everyone was recommending 
it I was looking at her and it looked like it just  
had a few restaurants and that was about it and 
I was like well this we can't really go shopping  
here yeah there's definitely shops there's one 
yeah oh is it going to be as good as people make  
out to be I'm excited I think Blue Waters just 
makes anything look more beautiful already but  
we'll see are you sure it was the Piazza 
that we're meant to be going to nope  
Piazza just means like square right maybe I was 
wrong okay we haven't found it yet bear with us
I reckon this is it
oh yeah [Music]
there's icebergs and like penguins and a little 
seal they're decorated with for Christmas it is  
way too hot to have those things here yeah and 
also in Venice so a little bit out of place but  
super cute it reminds me a little bit of Dubai 
yeah the mall's just circling Dubai Fountain  
except that this seems very much more themed 
I've never been to Venice neither have I but  
I don't think it looks this tidy yeah I don't 
think the water's blue in Venice is it I think  
the water is a bit green or even Brown yeah this 
is definitely a nicer yeah but we haven't actually  
had our coffees yet I think this strip looks like 
the perfect place to find one what do you think  
I agree yeah as you can imagine this is like 
a central Masterpiece probably of Venice mall  
and there's just circled by cafes restaurants so 
if you are coming to this place if you're coming  
to see this thing don't go to Venice Piazza even 
though it's only about two minutes yeah you could  
probably do this whole Mall in a short while you 
check out the rest of it yeah [Music] foreign
this is the main photo op nice Christmas 
tree in the middle it's very Christmasy  
here in Manila it's insane I've actually never 
seen anything like it no in our first video in  
Manila we were really surprised actually 
how Christmasy each mall was we're like oh  
they can't all be like them they all 
were all the ones that we've been to  
anyway my hometown sometimes has some lights 
going down the high streets yeah here it's  
like Christmas songs everywhere everyone's 
saying Merry Christmas oh it's really sweet
right by the water surely 
this one yeah perfect thank you
iced caramel macchiatos please and pistachio cheesecake 
this place that we're in right now the Venice  
mall is such a contrast from where we're staying 
right now which is in malate but it is kind of  
nice to see both sides of Manila this place it 
doesn't feel like you're in Philippines because  
we want to see more areas of Manila today we're 
kind of staying around the center a little bit  
and doing some things that we couldn't do before 
we had the car but then tomorrow we're heading  
to a place called Tagaytay and then the following 
day we're heading a little bit further out and  
seeing some other beautiful sights and then after 
that we are heading more towards the islands so  
the first island for sure is Boracay we've never 
been to the Philippines before so it's the first  
time that we're getting that like serious Island 
Vibe of the Philippines. yeah I'm  
looking for water like that but it's not in a 
mall I can't wait so excited then we're heading  
smooth City and then there's loads of other places 
that we're not 100 sure which one we should go to  
I feel like we don't have enough time so if you 
have recommendations please pop them down below
I swear we don't always start our days with dessert 
but we're in Venice you obviously have  
to have something with pistachios and look 
at this so pretty it's gonna be sweet it's  
got cream on top didn't know it came with 
that I don't really have a problem with it  
this is perfect this is so hot it's so cold it's 
sweet we've sat ourselves right next to the photo  
op point it feels like everyone's like taking 
photos of us but they're just taking photos of the  
tree but we were so early but there's literally 
no one else eating here either it's just us
okay oh yeah that's good that's really 
good perfect way to start the day [Music]
hello back in the darkness it's about 4 
4 30 now we didn't actually spend like  
five hours walking around that mall we 
did sit down and do some work and Dyl  
was doing some editing but it did look 
like towards the end there was a sort  
of night markets building up there and 
it's really busy lots of people there  
as well and lots of people going around on 
those uh gondolas and even like swans yeah
it looks super fun but we worked 
up quite the appetite now I am  
very hungry and the next place that we're 
going looks absolutely insane and it's a  
place we've never been to before and 
seems very popular here so let's go
it's gonna be a rush hour traffic 
now isn't it yes bye Venice [Music]
we are coming up to the first place that we're 
going to tonight which is a drive-through it's  
not just any drive-through it's a Jollibee 
drive-through which is I would say probably  
arguably the most popular fast food chain in the 
Philippines and it's from the Philippines so I can  
see why it's popular oh is that it oh that's cute 
better than any drive-through I've seen in the UK  
there is music oh my goodness where do we order 
the food wait there's a menu oh we don't need a  
menu we've already prepared what are we going 
to be eating Hi how are you can we get a royal  
float peach mango pie tuna pie one piece chicken 
Joy solo chicken sandwich with fries and drink  
and a bucco pie that sounded like a lot of food 
I think it is a lot of food thank you so much
Merry Christmas Merry Christmas everyone is so 
Christmassy everyone's saying Merry Christmas I  
can see why they're working here in basically 
Winter Wonderland her name badge said Keith  
I find that quite funny Keith we don't have in 
Sweden but in the UK Keith is a man's name okay  
um okay all hands need to be on deck that was 
only 563 pesos eight pounds for all that thank  
you thank you okay we'll we'll need to park up 
somewhere to to eat this yeah that's the mascot  
oh he's wearing a Christmas hat I don't know 
why we're so excited by Jollibee because we  
have actually seen it in many other countries it 
seems to be worldwide and yet we have never tried  
it yeah I'm kind of excited starting to think 
this drive-through thing was a bad idea now we  
can't find anywhere to park to eat this stuff 
I don't know no it's a bus station we've tried  
stopping twice then police is there straight away 
to say no come back to you in a bit I found some  
form of packing I think in a shopping mall I think 
that's why we have to revert to thanks thank you  
the classiest taste test ever done in this parking 
lot anyway come on I'm so hungry I know let's just  
try this the park attendant's gonna be like what 
are they doing they're just parked in here to eat  
yeah okay I'm gonna pass you a chicken sandwich 
thank you oh wow that's so pretty solid brioche  
bun now this is not going to be a food review it's 
just gonna be me you're holding it upside down  
there you go you're covered in sauce no the other side 
how is it yeah nice I'm trying a spicy tuna pie  
they don't have a lot of pescatarian options 
at Jollibee but I found something with fish so  
it's been quite nice is it it's decent
kinda random if I was desperate I would eat that 
surprise I like fries they taste quite similar  
to any other french fry that you get in any 
other fast food joints okay well there's two  
to Mango pies in here yeah there's three pies in 
here okay three pies it is this thing is just the  
Fried Chicken you wanna eat that like a sandwich 
dip it in the gravy that's just plain rice this is  
just a boneless pot of chicken with some gravy 
that's what they're famous for though isn't it  
it's good we got two drinks one straw one of the 
drinks is just Coke but this one is called a royal  
float and it does look like an orange Fanta but 
the float part is that there's vanilla ice cream  
on the Fanta I mean the bottom tastes like butter 
try it from like the top and then work your way  
down I don't know if this would be like a dessert 
or a drink they've crossed out Buko pie so this  
must be a peach and mango pie look how tiny it 
is it's bite size now this is the buko pie 
it's definitely coconut yeah loads of people 
on TikTok said you have to go there and have  
the peach and mango pie that is sweet I like 
it this one's gonna be messy careful careful
five minutes later we've now within the space 
of like five minutes managed to scoff hungry we  
might be able to tell that we were kind of hungry 
I'm finishing off my buko pie we accidentally  
ordered two I guess Cheers Cheers seven and a 
half out of ten maybe eight and a half if we  
would have had it fresh that's our fault all I 
could have from the menu was a fish pie I think  
if there's other things that maybe I'm being silly 
but the desserts are good I'll give it seven and  
a half maybe an eight anyway that wasn't even 
the main drive-through thing from this evening  
we are heading somewhere else now that looks 
like what we just did but kind of on steroids  
yeah so I can't wait the traffic gonna be insane 
right now yeah at least we've got fuel let's go
you're just here for 10 minutes thank you 
thank you our Google Maps telling us that  
the next place what six miles away it's 
gonna take 45 minutes and that's probably  
a low estimate I think with this traffic 
this is what everyone was talking about  
yeah yeah this is the traffic that everyone 
is like oh you're not gonna like that [Music]  
about an hour later oh wow there's a Disney 
themed drive-through it looks insane I can hear it  
oh this is so exciting oh already 
worth driving for like an hour
it says Disney princess
[Music]
don't hit anything
[Music]  
it's all different Disney stories [Music]  
slow down. otherwise we'll finish it way too fast
[Music]
I don't want it to be finished yet. is it already finished?
I used to love Toy Story when I was a kid
frozen
[Music]
that's it that was so fun my cheeks actually hurt  
that was that was actually so intense I don't 
think I've ever been through one of those things  
well I know I've never been through one of 
those things we don't have them in Sweden  
from what I know I think that's the most amount 
of drive-through related things we've ever done  
because we don't have a car so once we get 
one it's like all the drive-through stuff  
we can do Manila really does Christmas well 
that was fun even though it was meant to be  
for children that was uh really fun I think we're 
blocking the road here so we're gonna have to do  
uh sign off and see you tomorrow yeah the actual 
road trip where we leave Central Manila bye bye
