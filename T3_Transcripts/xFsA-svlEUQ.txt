In this video I had the absolute pleasure of speaking with Bud Brown, someone who I've looked
up to for a really long time. Bud is a retired school teacher and military veteran from the
United States, but he actually lives in the Philippines now, where he's been for quite some
time. Just like me, Bud loves foreign languages and he's learned Spanish, Pagayloc, Visaya and
Vietnamese. If you guys haven't seen his channel already, definitely check him out. I'll put a link
to his channel in the description below. I hope you guys enjoy this multilingual conversation that we had.
It's like being here is the only way to learn Tagalog, especially back then. That's why I was able to
find your videos on YouTube and I noticed right away that I can learn Tagalog here on YouTube.
So you're really good and I really like your videos. This is where I started, how I started in
Tagalog.
And then the word for to know, do you know?
Do you know?
I know, I know, or I already know. I know it already.
I don't know if you still make videos like that or not, but it's really useful to me back then.
Okay, good, good. That's a good thing.
So I don't know, after that, I think it's cool, it's really cool by my brother, my brother is cool.
I haven't heard that word in a long time.
That's why I started my YouTube channel back then. I really want to make a video with you.
I'm shy, I'm shy.
Okay, don't be shy. It's okay, brother. I just want to talk to you a little bit so you can know your story.
You already live in the Philippines, right?
In Dumaguete.
In Dumaguete, but where are you from?
I'm from California.
California.
Californian, I'm from California.
Okay, so you grew up in California.
Okay, and why did you move to the Philippines?
When I was in the Navy, the US Navy, I was stationed in the South Pacific, in Luson.
My wife had a hard time when she was a child, but my wife had dyslexia when she was a child.
That means, in school, it's hard, it's good, but her family, they thought,
you're just stupid, you're just lazy.
It's okay, it's okay.
Even her captains couldn't stand it any longer, they couldn't.
So she went to Manila to find a job.
Her friends said,
you should go to the South Pacific.
There are many American sailors there, they're kind.
So she went there.
I just need help.
So later, knock, knock, knock.
Hello.
And the rest is history.
I told the Filipinos, she helped me.
Now, I'm her helper.
The most interesting thing for me,
there are many foreigners living in the Philippines, in other countries,
and even if they have a wife of a different kind, they still haven't learned their words.
They only use English, so I don't need to learn my wife's language.
But it's different for you, because you can also speak Tagalog, even if you're not Filipino.
So how is that? Why is that?
I like to learn languages.
Even though I'm still in university, I'm new to the Navy.
I'm interested in languages.
So one of my classmates from university said,
Why don't you go to the Navy?
There's a school for language learning in Monterey, California.
It's called the Defense Language Institute.
So I thought, okay.
Two birds with one stone.
I just need to go to the military, that's my obligation.
Then I can get a different language.
Okay.
But they said,
Congratulations, 36 weeks, Vietnamese.
Vietnamese!
I don't like this anymore!
I went to the Defense Language Institute in Monterey.
Then I went to Texas, then to Maryland, then to the Philippines.
My job back then was to go to Vietnam.
Back then, I don't know how to speak Vietnamese.
Now, but rusty.
So back to the Philippines, Vietnam.
When I got here, I heard the sound of a machine gun.
What kind of sound was that?
So I said to the Filipino,
What is your language?
He said,
Oh, you don't need to learn it.
Oh, there's another one.
I said,
Your language, huh?
Okay.
That's it.
I'm used to it.
But,
Who do I want to talk to?
They're willing to share.
I said,
You don't need to say that.
Dog or cat or whatever.
I said,
I like this girl.
Before you met her, you didn't know Tagalog?
No.
I don't know what it means in Tagalog.
How long have you been in the Philippines?
Have you been in the Philippines for a long time?
Yes.
In the Philippines, about 12 years.
Here in Dumaguete, 10.
And two years in Cebu.
What do you think of life in the Philippines?
I really like it.
The culture of the Filipinos,
I like it.
The standard of living in the Philippines
is lower than in the U.S.?
Yes.
But I told the foreigners,
It all comes with the package.
For example,
Now, in my house,
there's no electricity.
That's why I'm here in the restaurant.
I have a generator.
Sometimes there's no water at night.
In our coffee house.
I don't know where in the Philippines.
That's my experience.
Do your children also know Tagalog?
Easy phrases like,
I'm going to sleep,
I'm going to take a shower,
I love you,
and so on.
But I can speak Tagalog.
That's not necessary.
Because the Filipinos are really good at English.
That's why we don't need to learn Tagalog.
So, man, I saw your videos.
You're so good.
I'm proud of you.
Thank you very much.
If you could come here,
I'd be so happy.
I really want to.
Someday.
But I learned from you,
from your videos,
especially from the beginning.
I want to thank you.
Okay, my pleasure.
You're my friend.
Do you also know Spanish?
I don't know.
You don't know Spanish?
Do you want to speak Spanish?
Yes.
I'm so happy.
I'm so happy to speak Spanish.
There aren't many people here who speak Spanish.
But you know,
when I meet Spanish speakers,
maybe from Cuba or Spain,
they always say,
you have such a Mexican accent.
I lived in California.
I lived in Mexico.
It makes sense, doesn't it?
It makes sense.
Yes.
But when I speak in the Philippines,
they tell me that I speak like Visaya.
But I don't know why.
I'm curious.
I don't speak Visaya.
I only speak Tagalog.
How curious.
They tell me that I speak Visaya with a Tagalog accent.
It's the other way around.
We can't win.
We can't win.
We can't win.
But it's very interesting that
your story is the other way around mine.
Because I learned Spanish first.
And I feel more comfortable
speaking Spanish than Tagalog.
Something that I realized in Spanish
is that it's a little bit similar to English.
The things that I normally say in English
I can translate into Spanish without any problem.
But when I speak in Filipino,
it's like a completely different way of expressing myself.
It's confusing.
There are many false friends in both languages.
Exactly.
Yes.
Sometimes it's an advantage.
Sometimes it's an disadvantage.
Well said.
I remembered one time
when I just met my wife.
My girlfriend at that time.
And I was trying to speak Tagalog.
But sometimes I guess.
I try to use some Spanish words.
Yes, of course.
One time she told me,
Mahal mo bako.
I wanted to say,
of course, yes, for sure.
I was thinking in the Spanish word.
Are you sure?
But you know that in Tagalog
it's like a maybe.
Are you sure?
I'm going.
I thought, uh-oh.
No, that's it.
No.
How many years have you been speaking Filipino?
In total.
How many years?
It's hard to say,
but I can say that
the first day I met my wife,
my wife,
I tried to learn Tagalog.
Until now, 51 years.
51 years.
Wow.
It's quite a long time, isn't it?
Well, the truth is that
you've been speaking Filipino for longer
than I have in English.
Because I'm only 27 years old.
And how old are you,
if I may ask you?
I normally say in the 70s, but...
Okay, in the 70s.
No, 73.
73.
When men reach a certain age,
they don't have more adventure,
they don't want to celebrate,
they just want to stay in a very safe place.
But I don't.
I'm not ready to stay in a place all my life.
I've watched your videos for a long time,
and so it's great for me to get to talk to you.
It's just fun, it's just fun.
It's a real pleasure to meet a foreigner
that speaks Tagalog,
because usually the people here,
they don't have time,
they all speak English, blah, blah, blah.
As far as I'm concerned,
it's just not a priority for them.
It's so good to talk with you and to meet you.
And I look forward to seeing all your videos.
I really enjoy the surprise, the shock.
And I noticed that the young Filipinos
wanting to know if you're attached,
or if you have homophobia.
Yes, yeah, I get asked that a lot, yeah.
I'm sure you do, I'm sure you do.
