So we're going back to the house better city today. I'm going to leave the province for another day and get some stuff done. I'm going to share with you what it's like to be a foreigner driving in the Philippines. You might be surprised. Hopefully not too surprised. So I'm just waiting for Jane. I'm sat in the car. I'm just going to show you the drive from here to the house. I'll show you the sort of roads and road conditions and traffic and other vehicles you might encounter while in the Philippines driving. I'm just going to show you guys how the driving in the Philippines is. Adam is still near. So drive here and it's very scary. I'm just going to show you guys how the driving in the Philippines is. Adam is still near. So drive here and it's very scary. It's very scary. It's very scary. I used to drive in the UK with this more smooth car in the Philippines. It's a bit scary. It can't be difficult. The main difference is there's a lot more bicycles than there are motorbikes. A lot more motorbikes than in the UK. So they're quite small. They're quite fast. They don't really want to wait so they will try to go past you left right. However they can't really. It's difficult. It's always going to be careful. But generally you just have to just expect an unexpected hit. I've been waiting to get past this bike. When you go past a bike example just give them a little beep. Not aggressive. Just to let them know that you're there. The difference is if you beep on in the UK they take it so and you normally get a road right instant. But here it's expected. If you have beep thrown to place just where you drive. It's a cut as you'd say. I'm here. I mean if I was angry at me. But just a little. It's just to say you're there. It's a dog. It's a dog. I don't think if they're done here. So you just have to avoid it. We're going to go. But moving to the Philippines I never really intended to try. Never really intended to drive. I'm honest. Sob my car in the UK. Quite enjoyed driving but it was stressful too. Here's what you've got to watch out for. See this guy in front and he's indicating via you. Yeah. He's got absolutely no intention of doing anything. He's not even paying attention. He's leaving left buying centre. You've got to be careful. You can't always read their signs as they're intentional. He's completely blissfully unaware. He's left. Indicator one that he's almost in two lanes. I know. This is the driving in the Philippines. It's the way it is. It's scared. First time you were driving. You just have to always, always, always, always expect be unexpected. Your background? Yes. What's your name? Adam and Jane. Love lifestyle. Oh. Okay. How much? How much? 1000. 1000. 1000. 1000. 1000. And the link? Yes. I think the guy that having fun, like, practicing their English. And it's funny because he seems like they love talking to Adam. So this is how you buy fuel in the Philippines instead of planting it yourself. They have attended. It's like you used to a long time ago. Okay. Love it. Sir, up in the sir. Okay. Safe trip. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. So we're here now in the Saban Resort. We've come away for the weekend. It's decided to have a little bit of a break from what we've been doing with the house. Come to the Resort. Saban Resort. By the sea front in Omox City. So we're last here in 2018. Now we're keen to see if it's changed. Has it been moved? Has it got worse? So here's the view from the front. Ah, it has to come up back. So Jane emerges from the bathroom. She's emerging. Here she is. What's her first impression of the Saban Resort? Sorry. What's Jane's first impression of the Saban Resort? They don't have a good customer service. What's that mosquito? They don't have a good customer service. And they're waiting for like an hour. So they check in this doorbell up. We arrive to the doorbell up then. This is the Roh Misnah Ride. And we were waiting there. And we were hungry and thirsty. And there's just even water over from the other side. Tazen. She went to Tazen costume. New Tazen engine. Oh, there's a bun. Look what? Change the book. This is the first time I've seen a movie. I'm not sure if it's a movie or a movie. But I'm not sure if it's a movie or a movie. I'm not sure if it's a movie or a movie. But I'm not sure if it's a movie or a movie. I'm not sure if it's a movie or a movie. I'm not sure if it's a movie or a movie. I'm not sure if it's a movie or a movie. I'm not sure if it's a movie or a movie. I'm not sure if it's a movie or a movie. I'm not sure if it's a movie or a movie. I'm not sure if it's a movie or a movie. I'm not sure if it's a movie or a movie. I'm not sure if it's a movie or a movie. I'm not sure if it's a movie. I'm not sure if it's a movie. I'm not sure if it's a movie. I'm not sure if it's a movie. So if I quite a busy day game, as you can tell, a lot to do with the house, lots of stuff to buy, to try to get things to fit. And we're going to enjoy what you've been here now. Let's have a resort. So it's exciting times. It's busy and it's stressful, but it's very exciting too. Moving to another country is never easy. And we want to show you our journey to make it easier for when you come to do it. I've got a lot of great comments and feedback from you all. So many people we've heard from, planned to move to the Philippines. And like I said before, we can do it. Really, you can do it. We never thought it possible. It took us a year of planning. But we decided we could make it happen. Look at us now. There's Jane. Oh, that's so funny. The bus is the most proud. The bus is the most proud. The bus is the most proud.
