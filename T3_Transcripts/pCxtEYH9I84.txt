bye tubers too bads various crazy people um 
in a minute here i'm gonna be showing you  
guys a house that you can rent for 600 
a month it's been gently and lovingly  
brought to my attention that not everybody 
moving over here is on the same budget as me  
they've actually got a few dollars saved 
and so they've asked me hey man you know  
price really isn't a big consideration to me i can 
pay 700 i could pay 800 i could pay a thousand um  
and so i was kind of hard-pressed to find a place 
that i but i found this and it is an entire 600  
my friend david owns it it's a compound i think 
he's got four or five houses right now that are  
completed with a couple three more coming up 
and i'm going to show you the only one that's  
vacant it is um approximately 2500 square feet 
it's brand new it has all of the homes here have  
uh high pressure water that is on a well so 
there's not going to ever be any dry days it  
has high-speed pldt fiber internet it has 24-hour 
security it has a pool it has a fitness center  
and it has a little general area for like if 
you want to get together and have a few drinks  
or have a little party or a little get-together 
as well as restrooms out here by the pool it  
actually has a resort feel to it and i hopefully 
i'll be able to get that on camera for you guys  
so we're going to give you a little tour of the 
grounds show you the fitness center show you the  
pool show you the house and um just give you an 
idea of something for folks that aren't living  
on a pension or whatnot and all puns inside 
you know if you've got a little extra dollars  
and you want to live a little more quality 
lifestyle you need a full-size garage for a car  
things such as that nature and the surrounding 
area here is all paved road by the way so getting  
in and getting out there are no dirt roads there 
are no rocks there is no mud it's all been taken  
care of so without further ado um i'll have may 
patch this in because i don't know how to edit  
but we will give you a little tour of the grounds 
and then we'll give you a tour of the house  
and then we'll be saying goodbye all right 
see you in a little bit well alrighty kids so  
this is part of the compound there if you look 
there's my friend david's house and there's my  
gay looking little less scooter and then around 
here as you can see it has been fully walled in
with some nice surrounding homes by it and one 
super nice feature is there's an electric gate  
which is always nice but this building here 
is it's gate guarded and the guard actually  
lives in there with his wife and he's there 24 
7. so no one gets in no one goes out without  
him knowing about it so you've got an extra layer 
of protection here you do have the full on walls  
you do have a remote i'm sure and a 
key code pad to get into it and out  
the gate but the idea of having a guard 
there is super good along with cameras  
pldt is wired throughout the entire 
compound um water pressure is super good  
and um this is the pool over here is a little 
kitty area if you notice it's very shallow  
it's set up almost resort style there's some 
swings back there it's very kid-friendly  
the owner has some children and a couple of the 
residents have some kids and along with the pool  
there's change lounges again very much of 
a resort sort of vibe to it and behind it  
or over here is a kind of a general purpose type 
of bar area where you can gather um just have a  
couple of drinks with your neighbors if you want 
or if you're having a little birthday celebration  
bar mitzvah you name it um there you go 
what do you think baby man number one huh
you like the view clean pool too huh yeah the 
grounds i've been here a few times and the  
grounds are always just impeccable um keeps it 
maintained very well everything that he's done  
here has been pretty much state of the art and you 
guys will see that when we tour the actual house  
and then i'm going to give you a 
bird's-eye view in a minute here  
of the fitness center that is also 
on the ground so let me pull back
so that's a little better angle of the pool and 
there's the fitness center again something that  
you can use at your leisure if you live here it's 
all included in the rent of six hundred dollars  
um i believe the house that we're going to 
be touring would sell for 9 million pesos  
or approximately 180 000 us dollars at today's 
rate of about 50. so i'll give you a little bird's  
eye view of the fitness center and that is a huge 
thing for a lot of guys honey like our friend  
david i mean our friend gary uh our other friend 
david lowe he's always wanted to go to the gym and  
they can't go because of covet and they got to 
drive or it's raining and they've got a scooter  
so what have you got here if you're a guy that's 
really into fitness and a lot of guys are they've  
got their own little fitness center so may's going 
to go over there and look around and show it to  
you do ravana white impression and then i'm going 
to walk inside of it and i'll give you a bird's  
eye view of it all right we'll see you there okay 
so we've also got a fitness center here on the  
grounds so i thought i'd come inside give you a 
little tour this is available to all residents  
these homes are either for rent or for sale the 
ones that we're going to actually tour the one is  
actually available for both also so as 
you can see it's super hygienically clean  
uh they take really good care he's got pride 
of ownership here there's even a tv pldt  
there's this guy you can beat on 
if you like what do you think mate  
so you've got the pool you've got the gym  
and there is a general-like bar area all 
right let's go take a look at the house  
okay so where we just were a second ago is 
right down there and then we're gonna swing  
around this way and there is the house itself 
so as you can see it's got a little u-shaped  
driveway here in the front and then 
over here to the left is the garage
full-size car unlike my golf cart parking
and that is simply the garage area there is a 
little bit of yard in the back and along the sides  
but what you see right here is pretty much 
what you get all the way around the house  
but there is the view of the forest and 
the trees so we'll come over this away
and what i like about this is there's a 
full-blown patio out here in the front  
and i'm going to show you a little secret about 
this room at the end of the video but let's get  
going mae oh and here is a little better shot of 
the water tower now this blue over here are two  
other homes that are being constructed they are 
going to be about 2 000 square feet i believe  
2 bedroom 2 two-bath homes this one including 
the patio is about 2500 square feet unfurnished  
and once again it rents for 600 a month 30 
000 pesos so state-of-the-art type of kitchen
you've got the burners granite tops
the exhaust fan built-in cabinetry air 
conditioner so back home i used to call this room  
the great one because you would set up your sofa 
your television set the fan of course is there  
and as i believe i showed you i can't remember 
now there is air conditioning right here in  
what i like to call the great room so you can 
come here you can watch tv set up your couch  
you got the kitchen nearby and for fat guys 
like us we never want to be far from the food  
and three bedroom so this is 
about a 12 by 12 room i believe
again aircon
and that is one of the bedrooms it's kind 
of naked so i know but the size is a solid  
two feet bigger than what we've got and same 
thing over here a little different configuration  
air conditioning this has a little niche to it  
and that would be bedroom number two off 
of the great room and then the bathroom  
marble tile of course it's got a water heater 
it's got two different outlets and the commode  
and then a full-size mirror which believe it or 
not is almost impossible to find in any bathroom  
and then actually has drawers and storage here 
in the cr or bathroom okay then we're going to  
wander over this way and just give you a quick 
view of this is the entrance from the garage that  
i showed you so you park your car you hop in and 
away you go now this is the room that intrigues me  
this would be i reckon you'd call a master 
bedroom and over here this is kind of unique  
it's got a little wet bar again it's got drawers 
cabinetry full-blown air con another full-size cr  
again medicine cabinet with mirrors the basin 
the commode and shower dual headed shower  
then what intrigues me about this is this room 
over here so david and i were talking about it  
david the owner is if you're in this room here 
and you turn it into your master bedroom this  
depending upon your circumstances obviously 
they're using it for storage right now this  
could be converted into whatever your imagination 
takes you to again it's about 12 by 12 i believe  
um this could be a nursery this could be a 
home office this could be a little game room  
this could be again anything that your imagination 
allows it to be i'm thinking home office  
or again if you have a baby a little nursery 
and that way never far from mama and papa
however the other unique thing is this entrance 
here can be re-keyed this door can be locked
you can put say a piece of furniture here and 
you can actually turn this into a separate  
residence if you so desired because they've got 
the now would be what you call their living room  
this would be or bedroom however they shaped 
it an additional room and a bathroom along with  
a wet bar and all you have to do over here is 
put yourself in a refrigerator and a microwave  
and a blender for your margaritas and you're 
all set what do you think man it's nice isn't it
so on a scale of one to ten why
i love that question because  
that's the filipina style of rating not a one to 
ten it's a number one that means it's the best
all right guys well listen uh thanks 
for coming along with baby may and i  
wanted to show you give you an idea of how the 
other half lives as opposed to us pigeoners  
and what yeah oh show me see may's 
been scoping himself there i am
oh look at this so you've got a spot here where 
you can do uh your laundry you can set up washer  
and dryer if you so desire and you love the 
stuff where you can do your own washing huh  
yeah yeah and you could use this as a 
little kitchen you could put a stove top  
out here you could do all kinds of stuff it's 
actually unlimited possibilities and that kids  
is the view and i wanted to make sure you got an 
idea that for six hundred dollars a month you can  
get a 2500 square foot unfurnished home brand new 
never been lived in with a fitness center and a  
pool and 24-hour security all right this is paul 
signing off from beverly hills philippines bye
