 But you're Friday. The freshest. This is quite an interesting one because Chanti, she is from the Philippines, grew up in Argentina, speaks like 70,000 channels, 70,000 languages and can probably fly. But you guys have been... And it's now a K-pop idol. Yes, she's also obviously in a very, in a new popular K-pop girl group called La Pililibulus. La Pilus. La Pilus. And you guys have been requesting us to check her out speaking in Spanish and singing, giving the fact away from South America. So let's give it a watch. I'm excited for this. The parts of your world both cover Spanish. Plus, I haven't actually heard a sing like a capella or in a cover environment so it's good to watch. Spanish version. I only know this song in English. This is weird. I can't say, I can't say. Doesn't she remind you of like... Why do I do this in English? But since she reminds you of every either Nickelodeon or Disney sort of... Childlike to read actress. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. She reminds you of that. And she sings... I feel like she should have been the highest-come musical. Yeah, like... She's been on the cost. No way, I also feel like she's probably like a Disney channel but like the Latin American version. Yeah, yeah. She would be like a great host or anything like that for that kind of stuff. She's charismatic and also she has that look I think, like all these channels. It's the eyes. It's her beautiful eyes. She seems... Because it's like childlike but also obviously I think she's like 18 or 17. But she preserves that innocence. I think that's the look. It's the innocence. It's definitely Disney channel. So castable. Yeah, that's the... Well, no wonder she's... She's very popular as well in the Philippines before this. Oh, actually I read that to just do... Yeah, to do... The Teleserias and like beyond TV and stuff. Of course, pronunciation is fucking perfect. I mean, she's big set. I mean, fluently. I never had a shadow of a doubt. Oh, she grew up in Argentina. You know, I was like, what the hell do you expect? Yeah. I just thought I'd see some... You know, they have a specific accent in Argentina. But especially in Buenos Aires, they say things with a... Ush. Ladies and gentlemen. It's a show. With a double L's and like the Y's. Oh, your Ush is Colombian. Ush. It's a show. It's actually from Medellin. Medellin. Yeah. But let's go to watch this show called Florentina. Florentina. Florentina does it. I don't know. I'm glad we named both in English and Spanish. It was a spin-off. It was a spin-off of Cinderella. But yeah, it was a spin-off of Cinderella, but like modern times. And Argentina. And Argentina. So it was really cool though. But they... My legs can become obsessed with the accent. I think. Even picked it up randomly at home. Well, I used to watch a lot of it. So yes, I suppose the Y's. So if she spoke to me, if Shanti spoke to us. Yeah, with the polish. In Spanish, with the British. Listen to her and get lost and not pay attention to what she says. Because of the accent and just sort of... Oh, wow. You saw it. So it's sort of hypnotized with that accent, yeah. Yeah, I love the Argentinian accent. She's very neutral when she sings. She has the most beautiful face. It's like a two, right? Yeah. She's so cute! What the fuck is this song about? Oh, yeah. She has no legs. She's a mermaid. This is from my little mermaid. Yeah. Shut up. Yeah. Really? I was about to say, why is this? Maybe, oh no. Maybe she sort of was in an accident or something. No. I don't know. This is my little mermaid. Funny, yes. Quite serious. I just love her. Part of the song is after the little mermaid. Yeah, this is the song where she falls in love with the... Which she used to like spy on people that would go through in the... in the boats and she'd like all of the have legs. I've never seen that before. And they run and they dance and go through whatever. I just noticed this fact. Octopus is a bad woman. Yeah, correct. It's a big ass octopus, dude. I cheat. She was big, yeah. I know. You get... Ursula, that's correct. Ursula, Ursula. I don't know. And this... This also... This also like, soos, but he's in the water. Maybe Poseidon. Yeah, that's right. Yeah. That's really easy to remember. No, that's actually him, though. Wow, I was just being a teacher this time. I'm afraid she'll people are gonna see me on my face. I was just listening to the song and I'm like... Obviously, the pronunciation is fancy. It's nothing to like analog, but he's like... How do I make this song? What the fuck? What do you mean? I'm talking to you. Yeah, well that's the whole thing of the movie. You remember? Yeah, because she has a tail, doesn't she? Yeah, correct. She has a tail instead of feet. Then she gets feet. It turns out it hurts her to walk or something. No, she loses her voice. She trades her voice. For her legs. For her legs. Feb-laid. No, it's not. I would. I would never. Oh, fucking day. Yeah, but you want to sing. That was the thing about her. Oh, shut up. That was the thing about her, though. It was a lot of her life. Me, for the rest of her life. Or not be with him and swim and be miserable. Yeah. Pfft. That's the gamble. Also, what an absolute sad story. Disney, what the fuck? Well, it's not Disney. This is like from the Grim Brothers. Grim-Sprey. Grim-Sprey, brother. Grim-Sprey. Grim-Sprey. The Brothers wrote the tales and they have really ugly endings, yeah. They couldn't go the endings. Yeah, actually, the originals are quite bad. They're terrible. Yeah, going. Yeah. Janner and Su Pow losing people. Yue, me. I have no션 to forget. Somethings going on, is wrong. Janner and Su Pow met της vivon. Yeah. He said it was if he won't be matched with an egg, then this was what you would think. No more wedding celebrating them. You don't worry, I've never heard the Zsom Island congestive. Do you know what? It is beautiful. I love it. The lyrics is quite mad, but it's a beautiful song. Well, when you listen to the English version, the lyrics, you're like... You know what? I don't pay attention to lyrics too much. I know. I really don't, but when they're in Spanish, I do. Because they just come through. In English, I just... I just... I just recognize melody and she... And then when I actually pat into the lyrics, I'm like, wow. I've been listening to these songs for seven years. And that's what it says. I think mumbling that shit, never in. I always get surprised because it turns out I hate the lyrics. Yeah, correct. Yeah, but go on. This is good though. You see, that jab. She said it was really in a really normal and a very neutral Spanish accent. She claims it out when she sings, because... I think it's because of Disney. I think also now, because she's an international star. Perhaps they work on diction to sort of... Definitely. Be a bit more... Wait, it's the same as the cross-Atlantic accent in English. Yeah, correct. You can't sound like me and be like an international figure. Even though I'll prove everyone wrong. Fuck you. Go on. It's very subtle. She's cute. She's so prohibitive. She blew him up. She's so free. This is where those people are. Wow, it's way much forward in林spin. He wants to be part of him. And he wants him to be part of her. Oh nice, now girl. Oh nice, come on. Hey! I like her a lot. MLD Entertainment, you know what? I quit it. G-E-G. Yes. That's a big vibe. I like that. I love that. Yes. That make me like that song. I like it in Spanish as well. It's really forward in Spanish though because in the last part of the lyrics in English is I wish I could be part of that world that... Oh, but she wants... World and in Spanish it says... Maybe part of it is... I wish... Maybe part of it, maybe what she means. Yeah, I wish I could be part of him. But also, isn't in Spanish because we give kind of genders to everything. Don't we? He and she too things. Yeah. So instead of part of that world, it would be part of... His world. Exactly. When they'd be then translated like that. Which is even better, I think. I think so too. Because she's in love. Yeah, correct. She's not in love with humans, she's in love with him. And I think the story is that then she's the horrible side of humanity. It's true. You know? Well, she does and she falls in love with humanity. But at the same time... You know, humans were a piece of shit. No. And then she just returns to the water because they were polluting the water with petroleum. Oh my god. And then the time they were taking the turtles. And that was the little man made of us. No. Oh, I thought the turtle came from that. Anyways, look. After we come back, we'll be back. Don't you dare. As we have Lloris, she's a fantastic singer. Yes. Very good. Great quality standard of stuff. Especially when you do theatre stuff, you can kind of... He exposes a lot of weaknesses in a lot of singers. Yes. You know, diction, clarity. Vocal range. Vocal range. Choices. Also, intent. And depiction of a picture, which is very difficult to do. But then if you look at sort of... We'll have a look, right? We'll proceed to check out more of our stuff and some of our other band members. I love her. And because it's also really peculiar band, because they have one of the youngest... A cape of idols to debut in recent history. Yes, I do know B-O-A, but I see also debut too when she was like 13. I think who else debut to really, really young? Tenon. Tenon? Tenon, when he was like 15, 14. So, you know, he's not unprecedented, but certainly in recent history. Definitely part of a lap. Lackiless. So, that's what you guys thought about it. And there shall talk to Shanti. Big one.
