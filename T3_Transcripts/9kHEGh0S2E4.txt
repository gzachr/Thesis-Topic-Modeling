I prefer staying in a busy area where the action is. So I chose to stay downtown in Elo Elo City proper. Strange name, certainly proper but that's what they call it. Walking outside my hotel in the centre of the city, there was life on the streets. Apart from on Sundays when most businesses in City Proper are closed. And also the following Sunday when they planned a 6am to 6pm brown out. Nobody at all. I wondered why the hotel generator had kicked in that morning and found the streets around in City Proper. Even empty at that Sunday. Well she's counting all the money. That's a good thing. It's good to say you counting lots of money. Money money money. Hi. Who's got the best high? Yes. I'll have a hug.

Food courts at malls in the Philippines bear no comparison with the food courts at the malls in Thailand. Not far away from Robinson's is an SM store, but it's mainly just a supermarket. There's the bigger SM city north of the river near Megaworld. It's funny how a river and crossing the river makes the distance feel further away. In fact, I did walk a couple of times across the river to locations north of the river. But there's always that psychological thought that crossing a bridge over a river is a distance far away. The riverside walk was close by and easy to walk to. I've already done a video just on the riverside walk which I've found a lovely place to walk around. Everything you need you can find around the vibrant streets of City Proper. I noticed an abundance of shops and stores on the pavement setting sneakers or trainers as we call them in the UK. But I'm quite content airing my size 9s in my Jesus boots. I'm going to have a walk. I'm going to have a walk. I'm going to have a walk. I'm going to have a walk. I'm going to have a walk. I'm going to have a walk. I'm going to have a walk. I'm going to have a walk. I'm going to have a walk. I'm going to have a walk. I'm going to have a walk. Sit alone. Sit on the piano with your music. Sit on the piano with your music. Sit on the piano with your music. Working to learn how to work as a teacher, and go and register more slowly. Off to that place. And cross over to the beach. What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? I'm going to make a flag. Very good, very good, very good, very good. Very good, very good, very good. Come here, come here. I'm going to make a flag. Hello everyone. Hello everyone. Come, come, come. Stay in here. Welcome to the famous village of the name of the white and the white.

Do you need high grades to come to this university? When I'm in the old year, I have a high... I have a high grades. There's no interview. No. Do you like to do when you've completed the course?

And they are so empowered. Yeah. How about British? Yeah. Have you thought about that? Would you date an age gap with all to somebody you're right? Would you? Would you? Just watching the video is pointless unless you subscribe. It's like going to London and not visiting King Charles at his home. I am probably not the best. You will have your foreign boyfriend to be younger than you. He is more mature than the women. Thirty-eight-one. A guy that is ten-eight-twenty-nine. Which country would you like him to be? I think it's from Latin America. Latin America. Gosh. Any particular country? Any particular country? I know. Anyone from Latin America? So anyone from Latin America watching, apart from your boyfriend, Tune in. Would you like to live in foreign country? Yeah. Switzerland. Switzerland. Yeah. A lot of Filipinos say that. What is the attraction with Switzerland? I know that because it is something like... It's like... I think the most sort of Switzerland is like Philippines and the 50% of Switzerland are all countries like Americans. We are learning different countries, different cultures, different environments.

But apart from the area around Sydney, Prop. The lovely Riverside Wall, mega world district, the cycle lanes. This is beginning to sound like a Monty Python sketch.

Okay, and I studied architecture actually when I was younger never became an architect But I got my certificate. So okay It back in like Ronald Reagan days early. I used to buy all houses right and I made them and then flipped it okay when you could make money Well century and so Because of that I really started specializing in rehabilitating All things right. Okay, thanks. So our vision Was to take this Under your own building. Yeah, and bring it back to like Oh, Deco Is it art deco? Yeah, sure yeah, it's as much remained of the original structure. I mean all these beautiful pillars here They were none of that was here. No, no, this is all new Sure Okay Okay Okay Sure, and then we So how long did it take to re-restructure the building Gosh and can ask you who funded that did you fund all this? Yeah Yeah, in the US That we sold when I when I moved here. Yeah, and then I took the money and okay here and sure And Originally I went to the mayor here. Yeah, and I Ealed this building sure and nobody wanted to touch it because It was so what what was the name of the building did it have a name before it was called the hot dust building Okay, the hot dust family. Okay, so have you have you renamed it? Remnant warrior Okay, that's the name of our church. Okay, so it's easy. So so I went to the mayor I said, you know we have a vision yeah To completely rehabilitate yeah this and bring it back to historical 1935 yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah here in Elo, Elo, okay And he was excited about it and I said what the thing is is that you know You're gonna have to make it easy on us sure not harassing with a bunch of yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Fees and all this yeah, and it has to be listed as non-profit because we're already a non-profit agency Okay, has to be listed as non-profit. So it just makes it flow smoothly sure and then so he agreed with that So it made it much easier Okay, and then we just started rebuilding the whole thing that this This you know the ceiling we had to pour on the floor because that was all good. Okay, you know, they yeah Show from on the turn lights. Yeah, the third floor. There was no floor on the third floor, right? So we We added that yeah up there I And Parkng. Okay.

Don't. That took us about one year. Don't. Working with local guys. All of that is cement. It's all of our out of cement. That is old cement. So that is that is free. It's pretty heavy. The hours that could be handmade in the cement. All the words over there were handmade. There's a wonderful thing about here. And the building is really good. There's a lot of various people. Artists. Yes. You just got to kind of search them out. You can know where to find them, yeah. I mean, it's the painting guy who was here for about seven months. Yeah. Don. We're going to go with care projects. Can I ask you how much you spent? What was that? We've been in the bullpuck. I would die right here. Yes, but I'm your boss.

Yeah. Are you happy with the way it's turned out? Yeah. No, this was completely my vision. That's brilliant. Have you undertaken anything similar? I mean, you talked about the fact that you were in construction before and flipping buildings. No, have you done anything along similar lines? Like, created an environment that is... And the point is, large as this, but I've worked on a lot of different things like California, I've worked on the Ronald Reagan library. Oh, right. Oh, good. Gosh. I've done a lot of different things. Yeah. Come on upstairs. Brilliant. You two, the Philippines and the first guys, when... Well, I worked for about 23-3 years, traveling around internationally, preaching. Okay. A little faster. Yeah. And, you know, offering, when I have that, meeting day, just like a lot in Germany all over here. Okay. Kind of everywhere. I think about 81 different times. Skull. I used to do it then. And then I started coming here. When did you first come to the Philippines? Yeah, like maybe 2011. And then I just kind of... To Ilavila. We were in Ilavila. All of us in different parts. Okay. Got the full games. But it just kind of started working more and more towards more meetings like in Ilavila. Okay. And I started meeting more people. Yeah. And I just kind of fell in love with the people. Sure. Here, you know, does their super friendly. Yes. English, speaking. Yeah. Mostly, yeah. Area, really easy for foreigners to be a come visit here. Yeah. And at the time, I was my home base was in Corpus Christi, Texas. Okay. So I was living there. And then I was ready. I'd already been there 11 years. And I was just ready for a change. Okay. And then just kind of fell in the blades. Like, well, why not? The Philippines. Yeah. And then I realized that we're really about them. Yeah. A pair of about them. Yeah. And so the thing that we found is by bringing them and just showing them love. Yeah. That's our part. Sure. I myself, when I was driving right through up on the street. So I got a ball hard for that kind of thing. Yeah. You break them in and they really start to shine. And then they get excited. Yeah. And, you know, put them back in school.
