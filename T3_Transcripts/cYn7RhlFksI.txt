So we might invite hands just to tell you that. Girls, hands work nice. Whatever it needs to be done, it needs to be done. This is what we're going on. But I think it's going to like it. No, I haven't got too much experience with Vogue Home. My best friend is Hoppilopeena, but she'd be really used to this. I'm very excited. And my expectations are really good food. Because Max is like the quintessential fast food. You can say it without a lot. It's my Lola, and my grandmother is my Lola. And she, this is her favorite food. This is a spot. Yeah, it's like a franchise around the world. I think people are just thinking about it. Don't be like that. We do. Well, okay. So, no, but you know, I think Vogue Home has a bad breath sometimes. And this is why I'm making my mission today. It just shows the good, the good. I'm about to be the voice. The voice. The voice is better than I thought. No, the voice is really good. I was raised up. It's good. It's good. It's good. It's a lot that's too long. Yeah. Is it like too long? You can say it. It's a Lada, Talong. It's a Lada, Talong. It's a Lada, Talong. Yeah. Talong is... Talong.

It's a banana leaf here. I think these are boiled eggs. No, and in jail, we use the banana leaves as plates. I'm not even joking. It's good. Don't be scared. It has a very spicy, nobody can do that. Like, it hits your back. This is a baby egg. Can you just talk about how cute this is? Look at that. It's a tiny little toilet here. Try it. What do you think? I'm gonna give it a six out of ten. Six out of ten. Oh my god. That's really good. Salad too long. Salad has a long cut meat. That's technically vegan. You don't like it with the egg? No, I don't. I mean, it doesn't look like it's the new thing. I like my meat. I personally like it. It's a bit spicy. But I don't like it. This is one of the famous fish that they call the Sini Gama. Sini Gama is a vegan. You don't have a mind to eat a Indian curry. This is one of the famous fish. Sini Gama is my favorite fish. You'll see one. I like it very sour. And we eat rice with every meal. Breakfast lunch dinner with rice. So you gotta put some rice on your plate first. You gotta do this problem. You gotta dry your rice and like the salt. And then in the salt. Everything's got a little bit of salt on it. It is everything that's salt. That's definitely nice. Whatever. It's so good. No, and these are not potato. These are actually against us. It's actually a reddish. It's a reddish. Can somebody see the size of the tridish? It's the size of a potato. It's very sweet. Yeah. It's not good. It's not good to see. This is really good. I think it must be a piece of sweet potato. That's really delicious. So you gotta pro-confidently strip the potato to the surface. Very good. No, come on. You're gonna do it. Oh, see. You know how people like to eat that fixed and show? I see for the show. I mean, is it okay if I use my hands? Yeah, for it. Yeah, okay. I'm gonna make the shrimp. So come on in.

And I'm gonna make you eat that at the fish room. I don't need seafood. You're gonna eat this. You can even ask if I washed my hands. You didn't ask anything. You just said it. It's good, right? I would give it a six-year-old. Yeah. Okay. This is 2017. Don't you agree? A whole new world exploring new dimensions. Let me get down to it. Let me get down to it. Here's the thing.

We go for Jamaican food all the time. And this is the Filipino cocktail. It's a little bit like a stew. You know, we can go like this. But it's made with the peanut. The orange, like it's made with peanut. About this. About this. Okay. You should try this. Is that the bugle? Yes. Okay. Okay. Let's see. So, bugle, bugle. We're not allowed to have this like inside my house. You can use it to like take up. You'd open the jar and you knew someone was using bugle. Oh, wow. Everything is bad. It's very distinct.

Loving the lema. Lema. You got it right inside. No, no, no, no. Like even, yeah, that's it. Whatever's on your pork right now. But you know what I do? I take green mango. It's like the half. And then I take this entire thing. And I slap it right on top. And I put it in my mouth. Mango is scrimsh off. It's basically you. Stop your white eating. You're like, you're like, you're not out of the tip of my voice. I don't do. You know what? This is part of the flavors of the bowl. And you have to eat it in place. Never done that like that. Okay.

It's like giving me some leg. I have some like decorations. It's really like going for it with the model style. Max, when you start up the bus, he just has some like friends. He just has to get a different chicken with it. No, it's just because he's down inside of our own thing. No, are you going to take the piece of the leg or are you going to take the part where this chicken squats with? He can tell he goes to the gym. He is. It's a she. Look at that pose. I used to eat that chicken with the leg. Wait, hold it reverse. But why? There is banana ketchup? Yes, there is banana ketchup. Where is banana ketchup? Oh my god. Anyone who knows what this is with a ketchup dish is lying right now. So, okay. So, it makes the chicken banana ketchup a massive. But yeah, we normally eat fried chicken with banana ketchup. I love you. We're getting very excited. Can I have a bite? I'm going to try the banana ketchup. This is going to be light-changing right now. I warn you, it does this taste like your regular ketchup. Like, don't expect that. Should I start with fried bread? No, no, no. How I want to check it out with the chicken is stupid. You know, people expect like your tomato ketchup. This tastes like other restaurants, but they're doing it right. Okay, so very crispy. Very, like, he can see it's real. You know, it's like the sauce processor. Yes. Okay, I'm going to dig in.
