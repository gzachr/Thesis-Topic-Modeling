 Do you want to say bye to me if I take a trip out? Ah, here I go. See, it always likes to see the sea. I got more than my friends, my own burntag, my star. Guess what? We caught another home. This time it's a home of junior. Now, on Able, I gave us a good tip about where to find good effective mouth strap. One that won't kill them. I mean, found a couple, 150 pesos each. They do a fantastic job. They're harmless for the rats. I mean the homers. And this is actually the second homeer. What home of junior? We've caught this week. So we have one over here. The other one. See over here. There he is. Oh, home of junior. You okay? Then what are we? I'm going to take you somewhere. And let you go. Take on a little bit of a trip. Have a few jobs to do today. You're going to be okay. We caught you brother the other day. He's okay. You're turned to go somewhere. So let's take you somewhere now. My mate is also going to go to the vet. So many needs to have five more on back since day. So, you know, we're taking home of junior and mate at the same time. And so I don't confuse them. You know what they say? Men can't multitask. I hope I didn't release a name in the field somewhere. Take home of junior and to the vet. Happy a bit with disaster. You're out here, my darling. You're out here. Okay, I'm going to take me to the vet now. Okay. Do you want to say bye to her? Do you want to say bye to me if I take her to the vet? It's not me. No. Not to the vet. You're going to go somewhere else, homer. Junior. You're going to have a nice day somewhere. Don't worry. No worries. Very fast, aren't you? You're very fast at your dad. Your dad calls does a lot of... You brought a lot of humour. A lot of fear at the same time. Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Oh my gosh. Oh no! Okay. I'm going to put you in a bombard. You don't pee on the floor. Make it smell in there. Or how would you know it won't be long? Now you find that May. May? There's her tower in the corner. She uses this sometimes. Then she tends to hide and sleep. It's a bit messy in here at the moment. The chair is not in here. I see her. I see her. There she is. Or maybe that's the real cat there. Come on, Mae. You come. I think she's seen a little wooden cat, which I bought a long time ago, actually. I bought it in Cornwall. In the UK on a holiday long year. Remind me of my cat leader at the time. Oh, and here she is. If it's in me, I'd be able to get to my home. I don't know. Come on, Mae. I'm talking to you, Jangli. You can think of a deal if you want. Come on, Mae. Here you go. I'll take your bum in there. I said, good go. This is called day. It's say you're in this day. And it's about as face-to-face classes. We're just on our way now to pick her up. Cornwall is getting busier now. You can see off the trikes, lots of cars, lots of bikes. It's not her first day to day. She's been back for a week now. This is the same thing that she's been doing for a long time. I think it's a bit messy. But I'm going to have to do this. I'm going to have to do this. It's not her first day to day. She's been back for a week now. This is the second week. She goes in two days a week. Mondays and Wednesdays. We still have our car. We haven't bought anything new yet. We're still on the lookout for a new car. Considering our options, we do like a new car. But we're practical with reasonable and good second-hand cars. Always a good option too. Oh, no. Oh, no. We have to sell our car first, don't you think? Yeah. It's difficult here. There's very few carriages that actually accept cars as trading. She's surprising as in England and the UK. Practically every garage we do. As behind us are ambulance. Do you reckon? Yeah. In the UK, practically every garage will do a trade-in for you. You lose money sometimes. But sometimes it's the easiest option. It depends on the value of your car, the condition of it. But here's a new Toyota being built. Oh, yeah, that one there. This would be Toyota in a few months or however long it takes to finish it. It would be nice. Toyota's a good car. Really enjoying. Really like choiders. Have I ever had one before? I haven't ever had a problem with it. Very good. Mechanically. Great drive. Toyota's always an option. They're very popular here. There's not many more carriages in Ormock. It's nissen. I'd love to see the nissen kick. It's a electric and gas. So we quite interested to see it. We're going to buy some fish today for our dinner. It's a bit late. So we're going to get to the market first. There's some fish in this lounge. Nice. I always like to see the sea. Always calm when you drive by the market. You see the sea. Until the smell of the fish is you in there. That went chop again. So it's Ormock market. We're at the wet market. Jean's gone into buy some fish. She's gone to buy herself as sometimes. There is such a thing as falling a price here in the Philippines. September, tomorrow, can you believe a holiday season begins in the Philippines? I'm not dreaming. There we are. Be careful with the curb. I'm not sure that. OK, there's this chaos. There she is. This is a baller. When I maneuver across the road safely, I fit for the old man with the bike piece. There we are. There she is. We got this, Abala. I'm dying. No! The car smells nice. It smells nice. Oh, the car smells horrible. It smells nice. All right, we're going to go. Jean's going to buy some chocolate now. This is one of our suki's. Always gives us a good price, a good quality. The hair is back to black. It's not black, it's brown. Back in black. It's back in black. So, Abala has to take her high, like so, by hair. It's back to black. Blackish brownish. I feel like cookie, honey. It's not black as well. Copy and cookie style. Bit of white in there as well. And my braces. Oh, yeah, she's got metal teeth now. She can bite through objects. I'm going to bite through you in a minute. I'm going to be the next terminator. Get into the boot. You got nice commote. I'm more thin, but we already bought some. 35. Here. Have a free bite. We bought already a 40. 40 in the color here. It's nice and clean. It's nice and clean. The one we bought. Hard there. Next time. I must be the one. She always gives us a good deal. Always gives us a good price. Good your favourite. So we have a barbecue tonight. I have a barbecue quite often in the Philippines. It's quite a lot of nice evenings like this. What about to Mr. Cream? You might see a homogenea. Let's have a look. It's been alerted to something. Do you see something? Cream's on alert. Do you see something now? I'm going to finish off this whole house. And the garden will be when this house is painted. It will be painted. We're going to go with a white colour. It will look nice. Looks like another mango ready. It's going to get it. It's not mango, papaya. Mango. Papaya, Adam. Papaya. Definitely grown. I think for sure the rain here definitely helps it all. Don't need a small one this. Let's grab this one. Come on very easily. How much was that and what type of fish is it? I can't remember the name of the fish but it's 120 pieces. It's not a tuna or salmon or anything like that. No, no, no. It's not a sea bass. No, it's called fish. Filippino fish. It's called fish but I don't know if it's a fish. It's not white fish though is it? No. It's not like a cod or a place or anything or a haddock like you get in the UK. It's a Filipino fish. It's not a noigny fish like a tuna or salmon. It's just a fish. I can't remember. I know there's a name like this. It's a lamb arou. I don't know if you say it. I don't know. Maybe you guys out there know what this is. What's this fish? Really? We don't know. We don't know. The Philippines is a lot of options for fish and seafood. It's a healthy diet too. I'm going to cook these inside. Just a dirty kitchen and it's finished. We've been so busy with other jobs. Other tasks. The main one is really going to come together tomorrow starting tomorrow. A lot to do. Short time scale. But it's okay. The main priority. Just enjoy ourselves. I think it's getting more expensive. Smaller. Cheaper. Cheaper ones. They're cheaper. I don't mean actual products. But the way they manufacture, they're trying to bring costs down. They're trying to make it as cheap as possible to manufacture. To get the price down for consumers. But the reality is they're cutting corners by doing it. Always best to grow your own. Or if you can't grow your own, why at local age? Support your local. So it's the first set of 10 but tomorrow can you believe. In the UK kids are getting ready to go back to school. Whether they like it or not. Here in the Philippines. Kids have all gone back. Forever and public. And first of September has a lot of meaning for me. It's my dad's birthday. It's my uncle's birthday. They're twins. I missed them both. Haven't seen them in over a year now. I'll give them a call. Give them a call on Skype. It's because they zoom then but I don't use zoom anymore. I'll give them a call on Skype. I'll catch up. See how they are. Really miss my family. Reproaching holiday season as well. Like I said earlier. First of September normally is a start here. Start the Christmas spirit. Christmas season. And it's going to be our second Christmas in the house. Wow. It's gone really quickly. Really looking forward to it. Looking forward to another year here. It feels like home definitely. Moving to the Philippines is a scary thing. But it's just incredible how quickly and how easily we've settled. We find this as home. We have everything we need. We have friends. We have neighbours. It's about as it's school. In many ways life is the same as it was in the UK. We still do what we do. But it's better. Because we can do stuff like this. We can cook outside. We can barbecue. We can enjoy it. Life is better definitely here in the Philippines for us. We are going to have a dinner. We are going to have a dinner. We are going to have a dinner. We are going to have a dinner. We are going to have a dinner. We are going to have a dinner. We are going to have a dinner. We are going to have a dinner. We are going to have a dinner. We are going to have a dinner. We are going to have a dinner. We are going to have a dinner. We are going to have a dinner. We are going to have a dinner.
