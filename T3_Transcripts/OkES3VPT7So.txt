it's our first impressions of manila 
and guys i wish we could lie to you  
and tell you it was amazing and perfect 
but honestly it was quite the opposite
in order for us to get a better understanding 
of what manila is like we figured we come  
to the oldest part and that is intramurists it 
is literally the fortifications of the spanish  
time there are so many pieces of history here 
and at one point it was considered like all  
of mandela within these walls so everything 
outside of the walls was like considered like  
would be like a suburb minnow at the time 
which is super interesting to think about
okay
wow i mean you literally walk away sad when 
you're down there and you see everything these  
people endured how many people died down there at 
least 600 bodies and guys these barracks were this  
dungeon was considered for like ammo and that 
type of thing and then they put people down  
there 600 people in a very small space so your 
dynamic suffocation heat like it's terrible  
this is the kind of stuff we like like yes 
we love water we love water adventures we  
love islands and we love the blue crystal 
waters guys we thrive when it comes to like  
history and architecture and like just the 
non-beachy things like it's not really our scene  
we're going to show you guys because we also want 
to take part of it but like these are the things  
that we like doing the most we're here at the fort 
santiago wall and as soon as we got to intramurals  
a lot of the guys told us that the wall was closed 
and they tried offering us their tour packages but  
clearly it's not closed because we're here guys i 
never listened to them anyway they don't ever tell  
you the truth unless they're actually you know you 
say yes i will take your torque guys but whatever  
we we know better than to not go see for ourselves 
and also guys here's the thing i respect the  
hustle i will always respect people trying to 
make money on their own like hello however if i  
tell you three times four times in a row no thank 
you in the most polite way possible and you follow  
me and continue to hound me it makes me even 
less inclined to ever ask for your business ever  
guys tone down just a little bit when it's hot you 
gotta you gotta freshen up some way was it coconut
what flavors are there avocado and cheese they 
said it's avocado and cheese i don't think i  
will ever pair those two together especially 
in an ice cream form so let's give it a try
i mean it's creamy but there's also like a coconut  
taste to it so it's probably a mixture of 
coconut avocado and cheese would i get it  
again maybe not but for 20 pesos in this heat 
40 pounds 40 pesos in this heat well worth it
we are standing in front of the oldest stone 
church in all of the country of the philippines  
seeing augustine it was like built in 1607. guys 
first off this is the first like cathedral church  
we've seen since we've been here we've seen a 
lot of like outdoor churches but this place is  
insane it's beautiful it definitely gives you 
the spanish vibe like you know where you're at  
and we haven't been inside yet so let's see
so
the moment i walked in there i literally get 
emotional i don't know if it's because ever since  
my mom passed away and i went to go visit like 
these cathedrals and churches that i get overly  
sensitive but i do and it's just a feeling it 
takes over my body and i start crying immediately  
but like it's a beautiful beautiful beautiful 
church and if you're in manila there's no reason  
for you to not come see it it's the oldest church 
in all the country stone church in the country and  
it's a moment let's put it that way it's 
definitely a moment jose felt it too  
so my first impressions of intro mirrors guys 
i'm a sucker for these type of things like  
architecture places where important 
things have taken place and like we still  
respect the relics of it and keep them off 
instead of building over them or tearing them down  
i love this place i love the area i love the fact 
the history and the fact it's in the middle of  
manila this huge metro like the city guys it's 
even more impressive it's definitely you know  
you're walking into something that was once very 
very very important and means a lot to so many  
people there is so much to see here in intramurals 
i mean i love that they really value the history  
that goes behind what happened back then and just 
how well they preserve it along with their modern  
take of it with through the lego museum so that's 
pretty cool um we could do a whole video of just  
this location alone but for the purpose of our 
first impressions here in manila we're loving it  
and we're excited to take you to the next part 
of manila it's a little bit more modernized
guys i swear i'm 6'2 on a good day
all right
i hope you guys are ready because 
will and i are about to take you  
to a place we call paradise and something 
that hits home real real hard for us  
guys we traveled all the way to manila 
literally from cebu mostly for this very reason  
we used to go to magnolia's bakery all 
the time in chicago and in new york city  
guys when we say it's crack and formed like 
food form we mean it is crack it is so good  
the best thing ever is your banana pudding like 
what was saying we came all the way to manila  
from cebu for this delicious gooey gooey 
heaven that we call banana bread pudding we  
had this back in chicago in los angeles 
and in new york many many many times  
many times in all sorts of flavors but the og the 
banana pudding is what anyone should ever get if  
you find yourself in any of those cities so we got 
to show you what we're talking about look at this
the banana the pudding the wafers oh my gosh oh 
my gosh it's the wafers that make it cheers cheers
i'd fly to manila i lived anywhere close all the 
time just for this it comes in three different  
sizes there's like this like baby teaser size 
a medium size and the human size is what we got  
if you find yourself not being a city person we 
highly highly highly recommend you come to manila  
just for this banana bread pudding this 
is the most american thing i've ever seen  
outside of america there's a 
shake shack there's a pottery barn  
right beside it guys it legit feels like 
we're in like chicago or something whoa  
okay it's the little things we're loving bgc it's 
a big gay couple that's awesome the true acronym  
for bgc but anyways like this would probably be 
where we will most likely live at if we were to  
settle down here in the philippines yeah but i 
feel like they get old real quick that's true  
like we like traveling we're not we lived a 
city life before we have more fun we're out with  
you know like maybe it's just a place that we 
stop by pick up the essentials and then head out
all right i feel like we've we've burnt the 
calories of that banana bread pudding here in  
bgc well at least one of the wafers anyway and 
figure it's time for us to hop on this cool  
mode of transportation here and head 
on over to another part of manila
living life guys just out seeing bcg on a 
little bike on a whole new different perspective  
all right we gotta go guys
and random back that's not lady gaga  
in fact in fact she's not heard here she's 
not seen here nobody knew who the hell she is  
but brittany honey she's global so everybody 
in the philippines knows her no local acts
we have left bgc because these are the 
areas where jose and i freaking love  
walking and walking and walking
like the less  
pretty places which we find beautiful it's 
usually where we find the coolest people also
we're literally like two blocks over from 
bgc so you can see the change in scenery  
in the street so it's like it feels like we're 
in a completely different area i mean we are  
but like you really had to travel 
but we love it so it's fine
vanilla's massive and that is to say that 
we've only had a chance to explore bgc  
uh i also say bugatti what is 
it called bagati where are we at  
what's it makati makati and the intramura 
intramura intramurals and it's been a vibe here in  
manila but not the one that you would necessarily 
think of uh we'll tell you more a little bit later  
once we've passed this part of the area so 
we've been in manila well a day now was it
was it what do you do this [ __ ] all right guys 
so it's that time it's our first impressions of  
manila i wish we could say it was like amazing 
and perfect but it was it's quite the opposite  
and we know opposite because we're comparing it 
to our actual first impression of the philippines  
which is cebu the most welcoming warming kind 
people we've ever interacted with everybody  
and when i'm talking about manila i want 
to make it very clear that we're talking  
about people that we actually had to talk to or 
interact with this isn't the people walking on  
the street minding their own business they're 
amazing but it's people we've interacted with  
and unfortunately they were very made us 
feel like we were doing something wrong  
bothering them not welcome and we're talking 
about the the security officers and the police  
officers and like the people the restaurants and 
stuff like that just it was just a weird energy  
in the hotel that's another story but we did have 
some good interactions with some good people so  
unfortunately our first impressions manila weren't 
the best and i'm really glad taboo was our first  
impressions because i don't think i would have 
the same feeling if it wasn't and honestly guys  
with that being said i think it's time for us to 
leave manila and head south manila to batangas and  
explore the beautiful towns what is it to see 
to do and to eat so be sure to like subscribe  
and hit that bell notification for that upcoming 
video and many more thank you again for watching
you
