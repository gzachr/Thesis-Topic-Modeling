 The Philippines, home is some of the most beautiful islands in the world. And some of the most amazing food and culture you'll ever experience. It's also home to the most friendly, humble, Filipino people that live day by day with smile on their faces, regardless of the challenges they may face. As a Filipino American, they grew up in the USA. I wanted to humble myself and experience what life is like living like a Filipino in poverty. The goal is one month living in the Philippines province on a 200-pacel with day budget, which is $4 USD. I must live like a Filipino in experience every day just like my ancestors who still live and still living to this day. So join me on this new journey of becoming a true Filipino, paramount. What is up guys? Welcome back to day 19 of my Filipino journey, living in a tent. They named it are they eating? 19. Living in a tent on a budget 200 pesos a day guys. So today guys, I'll be honest, as you guys could tell by my shirt, we're going to a fancy din- I'm just kidding. Where are we going now? Going to street food vendor. Yes. Total bits. Total bits. Yes. So guys, we're going to be trying Filipino street food. And guys, I'm not going to lie to you. I really never tried it because I got to mess up stomach and just fried stuff is not my favorite. I'll be honest. You get dry area? Huh? You get diarrhea? What the heck? No, I get to upset stomach. Same thing. If you get an upset stomach, you're going to keep having diarrhea. Alright, well, that's one way to put it. But yeah, so really just fried food in general makes my stomach upset. So today guys, I'm going to try it for you. But hopefully, I don't get sick trying it because my stomach is not used to this type of food. So now, what is your favorite type of street food? So give me an example. Because we tried the Paras. That's like real food. These are more like snacks. Oh, like quack quack. Quack quack is this quail eggs. Those are like orange. The orange ones. The orange ones. I like the most. Those are like the most famous. The most interesting that would be so good. And the calamari. Those are like, which one is the most popular? The most popular there is the fried. No, it's the fried intestine. Fried intestine, really? Okay. Well, I've tried the regular barbecue intestine. So the fried intestine must be probably better to be honest. Okay, guys, so let's go check it out. I'm excited. Guys, this is going to be a hectic situation. Situation, because there are probably people in there. Hopefully, they don't have a lot of people at least hour. Well, it's Sunday, so I'm expecting a lot of people to be craving street food. Just like how we want street food. They probably want street food. So let's hop on the bike. You guys know the routine. And I'll see you when we get this street food. Peace. So guys, we just arrived to this famous total bit that sells all the street food. This is basically street food paradise, right? Yes. So where do we even start now? I don't know, they just roam around. Okay, let's go. You take the lead now because I'm not sure what I'm doing. They have some drinks. Oh, they got some nice drinks. Some food. Here's... Which one is this now? Not in the skin. So, oh my god. Let me check this out, or at first. Oh, it's a lot. Imagine sticking your hand in there. You're done. Now, would you put your hand in there? Oh. I'll pay you, um... I'm just kidding. I'm looking just from around the first. So they have so many choices. They have this guy. Ooh. That one look good. What kind of thing is that? 15. 15. What is that, huh? It's like cheese. Cheese stick, okay. So now, where do we start? Where do you want? You take the lead. They have like the prices. That's mommy? Yeah. Mommy? Okay, so they got everything here. All right, now. Most of the stores are closed. Oh, yeah. Is it closed because it's now open? Or they go open later? They have to turn it. They're going to open later now? Yeah, later, I think. Whoa. Look at that. This is so cool. Let's... How much is that? You can get this whole thing? Oh, you can't. All right, well... All right, now, go get some. What is the prices? Yeah, because I can't get any. All right, so I think we found the winner, guys. We go try the dynamite. What kind of dynamite can you get? You can get that sunscreen one. Okay, let's try the dynamite. Yeah, you want to? So guys, we're on a budget. We only have 200 to spend now. So that's already 30. They have also children here. Chicken skin. Oh. We have a spicy one, you know. The chicken skin. What kind of chicken skin? 123. We can't afford that, no? So let's stick to the regular street food. You want to try some, right? Yeah, let's try the quick quick. We're going to go quick, right? We want the fastest food. We're going to go with the fastest. Thanks. One? One. Just one. Gotta be careful eating this. You will get sick. What's with the bomb? What about... What is this, now? Kikiam. Kikiam? What is this? Sausage? No, it's like fish ball too. Oh, it's fish? I don't know about fish. What about this? Chicken ball. Let's try one chicken ball as well. What's your favorite, now? The chicken ball, dynamite and... That quick quick. Quick quick? Okay, so we got all that, so. Yeah, what's all the good? We're going to try the other ones there and other stuff. Yeah, they still have a lot more to try, so... We're just getting started. It's already cooking. Oh, can I see? Oh, my gosh. Wow. So we got two dynamite, one quick quick, and then chicken balls. Okay. Let's see. We'll show you guys how it comes out when it... ...shits. We'll show you guys how it comes out when it's cooked. Wait, what kind of sauce do you want? I don't know, what are the options? Vinegar already, sweet sauce. You pick, now? Sweet sauce, now. Sweet. Let's see, now. Sweet sauce. Okay, thank you. Dynamite, one of the ampoule, that's it. Okay. Okay. So now, what's all the sauces left? Mayo. Mayo? Oh, must stay away from the mayo. I saw the other food one. Catch up? No, sweet sauce. Sweet sauce, okay. Thank you, sir. Oh, you need a pain, huh? Yeah, what kind of sauce is this? This is the baby. 65. 65 pesos for all this. So a little over $1 US. Two sticks of dynamite and some quick way. We got the fish balls, not? No, chicken balls. The chicken balls, quick way and two dynamite for 65. So it's pretty budget friendly if you come here. This is very hot and fresh, but we cannot afford this. This is 125. Chicken skin. Looks good. Alright, now, the famous, do you put sauce on the dynamite? Not really, but you have to put mayo, whether it's not mayo. Oh, no mayo, no mayo. So just right, bro. So guys, we've got the street food and we're going to try the dynamite first. Let me hold it. It's very hot. It's very hot. All this is super fresh, something. Let me hold this. Hold that for me, now. So dynamite, explain to dynamite, what is dynamite? Dynamite is a green chili with it filled with cheese. So, what's this breading? Lumpia wrapper. Guys, at this point, I literally got hypnotized by dynamite. Super spicy, it smells very spicy. So let's take one bite, hopefully it's not going to be too hot. Let's try it. Hot. Hot. Not spicy, just hot. But that's a really good flavor. Because I'm getting a kick of cheese, the cheese with the pepper, it makes it spicy, but it's also like, kind of like sweeted in a way. Let's try one more now. This is really good. I'll save one for you for your reaction. I really like it. How about this one? For the dynamite, we're going to say 8.5. Easily could be a nine, but I just think it's too hot for me to really enjoy it. Let's try this one, guys. This is the quack quack. It's very hot. It's very hot. Ready? Okay, explain what the quack quack is, now. The quack quack is a quail egg with butter, with orange butter. Butter? Yeah, just like a flour butter. Oh, butter or butter? Butter. I don't know what she's saying. Wow. So, we're going to have to use Google Translate. So, well egg with orange butter. Yeah, this one's said. Look at a hard boiled egg. Let me take a bite so I could show you how. So, that's the egg and that's the batter. So, to be honest, the batter is good. It's just, I really prefer the egg. I'll give this a solid 7.5. The sauce is very good too. It's not too salty, it's perfect. We'll try the chicken balls. Chicken balls with the sweet sauce. It's right. So, what is the chicken ball? What's the meat on it? What's like the chicken? Just like head or is it? Right? We just say it's chicken balls. Chicken balls. I'm getting a fishy texture, huh? Usually it's not fish. No. What's on it? I'm tasting fish, not chicken. It's like mixed fish and chicken. It's alright. I'll probably give that a 6-hour tent. Not really my style, but I want to go back to this dynamite. This one right here. Let's try it. It's cooled off now, so let's give it a big try. It's got cheese in there. You got the pepper. It's really... It's not as spicy as I thought it would be. Because it balances out with the cheese and then the wrapper. Very good. This is my favorite so far. Right now. Good job. I'm gonna try the dynamite. You're the expert now, so... Very hot, and I don't be careful. You like it? Very good. Can I see the cheese inside? Did you get a lot of cheese? I got all. Mmm, okay. Darn them wet. It's so spicy. Yeah, it's a little spicy, but you'll get used to it. It's kinda just hot. Too hot. We're gonna have to get that drink. Let's go buy some drinks first. Alright. Oh, they got more bone marrow. What's that bone marrow is this, huh? What type of animal? Beef? Beef. Oh, okay. So beef. I thought it was pig. Okay. So we might have to try that now. Later. The supreme beef mommy is like one-bent. Mmm. One-bent is the best sauce for tonight. It's got egg too? Yeah. Okay. It's got egg, brain, and ice of the... Egg, brain and ice. Of the... Oh my god. I mean cow. See, we're on a budget, but... We might have to go over if that's the case. We might have to try that. But let's go try some... Some... What are these? There's some drinks. We have blue lemon, cucumber, red dice. The calamansi and the melons and the apple. Mmm. You guys can see it's very hot. I'm already sweating. So we need something to cool us down. What do you recommend? Which flavor? You put the best sauce. The cold? The calamansi. Oh, two bestsellers. Okay, we'll get two bestsellers. calamansi again, they're cold. Is that a one? Did you get the yucleic broof? No, it's a melon. Or you got melon? Okay. You eat like the melon. I think we tried melon one more time. Yeah, it's a melon. Okay. So we'll try the yucleic in the calamansi. Yeah. The blue lemonade looks good too though. Maybe later. Maybe later. Alright. It looks so cold. You can see the water coming down. It's very cold. It's very cold. It's very cold. It's very cold. It's very cold. It's very cold. It's very cold. It's very cold. It's very hot out. Well, this is it. Alright. Oh, right here. So 30 or 20. The mud as well, just spend the 10 pesos more, right? Yeah. Get more drinks. How do you make the calamansi? Is it... It's just juice sugar. It's good. What is your cold? It's just a little bit. What fruit is that? I see pineapple mixed with yuckel. Oh, the yogurt. Yeah. Oh, okay, okay. It's got a lot of fresh calamansi in it. Okay. So this one's yours now. Yeah, that's so nice. We might have to switch if I like that more. We'll see. That's some straws. Now, what time do they open? I know I'm saying to go people. 11th or 13th. But there's not a lot of people. I know. You said other stores will open later. Oh. So if you want to go where there's no people, this is a pretty good time. What do you want to try first? Let's try the yuckel. Oh, there's some chains now. Thank you so much. It's your cold? Very cold? Yeah, it tastes so good. It tastes like pineapple, icy and good. Okay, you try this one and compare it. You tell me which one you like better. So, 60 pesos for two of these. I like this better. I like the calamansi. I like the calamansi. Yeah, it's like lime. Alright, you try me now. Let's try. It's very hot. Very hot day. So, the yuckel, calamansi. So, let's try the yuckel. Wow. Very flavorful. It's going to be hard to beat this, no? This one's got a, you said it's better. Yeah, I like the better one. You're right. You're right now. This one's better. It tastes more healthy. Yeah, it tastes like a little more healthy. But this one's still got a good flavor. I just, I kind of prefer this because you get a lot of the lemon flavor calamansi flavor. So, you got this one now, now? I got this. No, I got this one. This one's still good. I'll give it just an eight. I'll give that one a nine. So, let's go find some more food because now I'm starting to get hungry. Let's try the fried intestines. Alright, show me where it is, no? It's not even that. Alright, show me where it is, no? Oh, you still going to eat the dynamite? I don't think you can eat that part, no? I don't want to waste it. So, now you? It's so weird. Oh, it's 15 pesos, so what for me? Yeah, what else is they have? They have fried chicken? Yeah, we've got a marion fried chicken. Call them arey. Chicken nuggets. Is that the blood? Yeah, blood. Fried blood. Is it? Yes, it is. Fried blood. I want to try the blood now. We tried the barbecue blood, I've never tried fried. Chicken nuggets. Chicken nuggets, oh yeah. Chicken nuggets. Whatever you want, just stay in the budget. You're good at this. This. I'm almost finished, it's so good. We'll get an interesting one. Wow, there's a lot of fried food. We've got nuggets. One of the best is for you, it's just one. We're getting cheers. We're getting the best. We'll try it. That's chicken nuggets. Yeah, chicken nuggets. Okay. We want to fry blood. One fried blood. Yeah, one fried blood. We're going to fry blood. So, 15 times 3. We're going to fry blood. 65. Okay. So, chap chap? No, you're not going to. No, chap chap. You're going to, because we want to try the whole thing. Yeah. So, so far we spent 60 at every place. So, it's like a dollar every place, so it's not bad. Oh, thank you sir, thank you. Wait, let me just help you. Because I have a way. Oh, you got a way. You got a way. So, these are the sauces. Yeah. What's sauces that? Vinegar. What's one do you recommend, sir? Vinegar. Alright, what's your other vinegar? Let's try the vinegar. Where's the main vinegar? Hey, is that the main? Yeah. What's the main? Vinegar. Vinegar. Yeah. We already had this sweet, so let's try the vinegar. I don't know which one. We got our street food, we got the fried blood, we got the fried intestines and the fried chicken nuggets. So, you want to try this? We try it plain by itself? Sure. Let's try by itself. So, fried blood. This looks so big, ma? What kind of food? Mmm. Whoa. I've tried the regular blood and it had no flavor. But this fried has a lot of flavor. And it's very big. Yeah, but you know I won't eat that, right? You said you tried it on the last vlog you never did. Because I don't like that. Now you have to try it, huh? This one? I'm giving this a 9 out of 10, this is amazing. Really good. Really good. Don't try the intestine. So, last time I tried the intestine, I didn't like it because it had the, it wasn't clean. But these look way bigger and these look kind of better. Let's try it. Whoa. Really good. I'm kind of getting a squid taste though. Squid taste? I think they fried in the same oil as the calamari. So, if you guys don't like seafood, it's kind of going to taste like seafood, but the texture is really good. Maybe when you put their sauce. Yeah, these sauce. I'll give this 7.5. Pretty good. Another chicken nuggets. Every time I taste chicken here so far, it tastes like fish. So, hopefully this can taste like chicken. It's very good, very meaty. Mmm. This one's the best. So far, this is my favorite. 10 out of 10. Very good. It's just simple. It tastes like chicken nuggets like back home. So, I want to have poor sauce. Let's do the vinegar now. It went better. Yep. Alright. Go dip it in the vinegar. Let's do the intestine real fast. Push it down. Push it in the intestine down. Oh. Can you get this? Oh shoot. What are you doing? Go through. Let's try it. We got it on. Thank you. Thank you. Actually, the vinegar is very good. I definitely say if you get the intestine, definitely get the vinegar. Definitely needs it. Now chicken nuggets with vinegar, I'm not sure. You have to put that in the sauce. You know what? We go just do it like this. Cheers. What are you doing? That's going to be so sour. Oh my God. That's a good sauce though. It's very sour. Let's try the blood. Push it down. It's hard to push down because it's fine. I don't want your hand to get it. I know. I'll just hold that. Alright. Let's put it down. Blood in vinegar. Alright. Let's try it. By itself, I gave it a high rating. I like it by itself. It's strong for the vinegar. You don't taste it now. Hold this. You try the blood now? I don't like this. That's really good. No. No. Bro? Why? It tastes exactly. You hate it? Oh my gosh. It's just pretty though. Give it to that cat. Where is it? There was a cat on the go. It's there. Yeah. That's so nice. Don't make me do that again. Wow. I like the blood. I hate blood. Alright. Tess, you want the vinegar? No. I want to try it. By itself. Yeah. Got a good taste. Got like a color market texture. Taste it right? Taste like squid. Is it dude? No. It tastes like squid because they fried in the same. There's some vinegar. Vinegar. Salted up in. Way better? Yeah, way better. What are you rated? Salted up 7.5. Okay. Now for the chicken nugget. My favorite one. Try it again. Good? It's good. Try it with the vinegar. I want to try it with the vinegar. I don't know. You don't want? Oh. Like it? I just want to go back with the vinegar. Alright. What do you rate the chicken nugget by itself? Salted up 9. Okay. So let's go do it for the street food. We might have to try some mommy. Mommy? You want to try mommy again? We might have to. We might have to. But because it's got the bone broth. So we'll see you guys when we get our order. No. The bone marrow is too expensive for our budget. Yeah. It's already 150. But I want to ask you a question. Who are these people? They got a lot of famous people here. Ooh, yeah. That's jelly. And if those are bloggers. Then it's. Yeah. Who's this zombie? To the zombie. This is the Filipino woman. Maybe host and then this is a vlogger too. So why they come here and not the other ones? Maybe this one is the best one. The best one? Wow, what is it? Okay, so what is this now? Can we get one whole thing? It's one where we are once again. Do you sell these? Or do you chop it? Chop it. Oh, so you can't buy the whole thing? Yeah. That's beef, right? Yeah, beef. Oh, here beef. So now I see why... That's beef both over low. I see why they come here. They come for the big beef. Wow. It smells so good. I want to try. How much for the beef? There. It's only 120? That's for the porridge. But this one is the more the more. This one says 100. Yeah, that's porridge. Hmm. Where's the mommy? There. I have to go here. What did that boil? It's my food alone. It's like one-hit food. I think we're going to have to try another time because we're already out the budget, huh? But it looks amazing. Really good. But, and they also got the bone marrow. We'll have to try another time because I don't want to go over the budget. So let's go grab a street food. Only four? Oh my gosh. That's why you have a lot of famous people. You guys have great food. So, unfortunately we can't get it today. We'll get it to a different day. And let's go... I think you can just get the two-pointer. We can just taste her. We're over the budget. Now we only have 30 to spend. 30 to spend. Yeah. So let's go get one more street food. Let's figure it out now. We'll see you guys. So we're going to try this hot dog. This one or this one? Which one is better? Which one is better? What kind of picnic? Where do you play? Okay, we'll do one. Salam. One hot dog, the classic street food. Is this like the most classic street food? No, I don't really call it street food. But usually they sell like a hot dog too. This one is also vegetable bowls. Oh, okay. So they try the hot dogs. No grill. Try the one. You could try it. You want the vegetable? But then you'll be vegetable. 15 pesos. We're out the budget, huh? We only got five pesos. Yeah, never mind. Next time, next time. So we're going to wait until it's cooked and then we're going to try it. The famous sweet sauce. Thank you, sir. Thank you. The classic hot dog. This is a picnic hot dog. So do grilled hot dog or fried hot dog? Fried hot dog. Fruit? I like it both. Okay. So hot? No. Oh my gosh. So hot? Not yet. Let me try not. What do you rate that out of tip? Seven point five. Okay. So the classic. Is this the best brand picnic? Not really. There's so much better. What's the brand? What's the best brand? For me, it's McKenney. McKenney? Yeah, it's like an angelic friend on the island. So this got the sweet sauce on it. Whoa. It's crispy. I think I prefer grilled, but it's still good. It's got a crispy texture, but it's got good taste. Maybe without the sauce next time. Because the sauce is kind of overpowering. Let's try one more. And then you can get the rest. Mmm. Very good, sir. Very good. Yeah. Last bite now? Is it? All right. Look at that solid. I'll give it a seven point five. Who's all right? What's that face? Why that face? I'll change it in my mind. I give it a six. Oh man. No, there's no changing the rules. You gave it a seven point two. Because that was like the end. It tasted like sour. Whoa. We're locking in your score now. So God's that's going to do it for the street food tour. Yes. Did you like it? I like it. So worth it? I don't think so. So we have five pesos left over. We spent 195 pesos. I want it full. It's just like you get, you want it more. If you eat like a street when you want it more, you're going to be able to spend a lot of money. I disagree completely. I don't even want to eat more. It's so oily. I feel like greasy right now. So I think 200 pesos is the perfect amount.
