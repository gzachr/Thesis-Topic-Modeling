 Future Friday. Diffreshes. Ah! Top 50 Bollywood Song Tracks of 2023. We did like a top 10, right? We did our top 10 sort of video, special video that we did of checking out the top 10 of billboards and Spotify and stuff like that. How you guys love that? It's interesting to see what other people have compiled and see what other people have sort of come up with in terms of numbers. I want to see what other people think and what other people put in their compilations. Yeah, because we had some new names in our comps, but... And we were like, wow! This time we had checks on with them. And I guess we did it more... The whole of India rather than just Bollywood, so I guess this is just a Bollywood. Interesting to see what's happening. So they based their all on YouTube list. Okay. Oh, by the way, funny enough? Yes, I... Yes, yes, that's it. Yes, that's it. Yes, that's it. He's good looking. Yeah, Valest. Is that good looking? I was going to say as well, if you want to be part of the team, man, like, and you're like good at researching stuff, not just in the Indian Music Industry, but... Hala! In all the industries that we check, Halkori and pop, you know, Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, the whole of Asia, basically. If you're interested in doing some research for us for our future videos... Yeah, we've got a lot of team. Absolutely. We have some opening in there, so... Drop it through the email that is in the about part of this channel. Send the application and the... Yeah, updates. We can make videos out of that. Oh, I love B-Pri. Yeah, I was, of course, the B-Pri. You can't even shoot me like crazy. We love a three. That's a new song, though. That's a new singer. Nadymohan. Vishalmish. Wow, what a voice. Yeah, go darshan. I think it's such a top dude. You know, we haven't checked out APD. APD reminds me of like the Latino scene. Yeah, we shot. Oh, I forgot to talk to him. I think he's a top-tier of Punjab. I think Punjab people are so cool. Yes. That's my nan for that badge. Yeah. Check them out. Right, bro. Like on a stream once. And I think I had the exact same reaction. Such gorgeous range. That's what we call flexible larynx. Practice. Oh, see how much value he has. Wow, he's so fit to the use. He made such a printed one. It is a six. Oh, go duvet. I love this word, bro. Oh, go duvet. Good for you. Apache Indian. Oh, my God. A lot of people request that. Yeah. And we don't think we have ever changed anything out from here. No, because like, again, like this year for us was like... Super accidentive. Yeah, very accidentive, literally and figuratively. Yeah. You know, because my last cow obviously, you know, for half of the year she was fucked up. And then for the last six months of the year, like we had all delayed plans and we were just trying to... Trying to keep some momentum and let's try and like get back to like a usual post and schedule and stuff. And we've only really been able to do that like in the last few weeks, really. And now it's the fucking end of the year. But like we're trying to bring like better videos and better stuff. You'll see like obviously next year, because it's basically over. But we haven't checked out a ton of artists like from India. Especially like the mainstreamy artist. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So yeah. Apache India. We shall look like... Look at the sausage, man. Look at the size of those productions. Are they prophecy? Check them on the stream below. Oh, we're streaming tomorrow. Oh yeah, you did. Don't be a higled time. Ooh, you go girl. Bachel. Oh, really, really. Bro, just think about... Oh yeah. Quite mad, is it? Oh yeah, I didn't look at that. It was all right. It was fine. It was all right. It was fine. Is there something wrong with it? I mean, not really. No. It's something great with it. Not really either. It was...it was fine. I just look at this and think, like... Also. The list was not a fan of this song. The sing, right? That's that same movie as... Vava, Vava, Camblya. Oh yes, I think it is. Yeah, it was... Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can't. I don't know. Here. That is good. This is not good. This is not good. Yeah, that's got rhythm. That's got flavor. I'm telling you, they are the coolest people. Yeah, we got to do a... Punch your best song. I love this tune too. Go beefnack. Is that name? Shraddha Kapil. Shraddha Kapil. I don't know why I find this song attractive. Cheers, British. Thank you. Oh, Annie Ruth. So it's not just... Bollywood. Because Annie Ruth does a lot of stuff for... The sound in it, right? Yeah, I was actually seeing like a lot of punjab stuff. Yeah, a lot of punjab stuff. Maybe it's like Bollywood in terms of... The numbers in movies. Maybe. But Kakar did that shit did not look like a number of movies. And I enjoy your honey sing. And I enjoy your honey sing was also not in a movie. I don't think. The music video didn't look like a number of movies. Maybe they just picked the title for, you know, Most people probably search for money with that. Maybe I was kidding in the charts of... Well, they were movies. See, why you think you start to get super popular? What the fuck? Yeah, I don't know. Not like that. Lowkey. See, the same look like it's from a movie. Shoot. Come on! Don't! Yeah, I don't think we are stressing out very much. We like punjab music. We actually enjoy so much punjab music in our own time. They're just quite difficult with copyright. They are. I wish that we could explore more of their discography. And like, because I feel like it's like... And their own subdivision is like a subgenre in the whole of India. And they start to think in punjab going on right now. They're so cool. They got steaks. Punjabi drill. Oh yeah, they got steaks. Which is... It is insane. And I don't even like rap. But yeah, well, I mean, we will prepare like, maybe for February and stuff like that. Because we will be taking a break. You guys might notice or might not notice. Because we do have some content prepared. Who knows? But just you know, I mean, there's no need to hide that. But we will be taking a little break and then when we're back, I would love to start creating some videos like that again. Of we compile some of the best punjab songs. You know, making fun. Our editors will have a blast doing that. And you guys seem to really resonate with it. So why not? This song is from this year? Yeah, same movie. No, not the same movie. But it is from this year. This is from that movie that I did not understand what was happening. And I was like, wow, the effects. Oh, and we promised we'll do more song reviews on it. Yeah, the break beat kicking butt. That's why I couldn't believe it wasn't in the talk time. Absolutely iconic duo. That's very active. Wow, we got the G. Oh, again, iconic. We're journey tagging. Okay. Same movie. Palakim, the child. I love her. Fucking every real ever. It's song. Ever played this song. No, but every, every Instagram real ever, where like this girl can be trained by this guy. And it's like low production value. Like they're not even flip-flops. And like you run down area. It's like bro, like, why are we using this? I know the Indian music industry and the Indian industry. Like, there is like some mad production out there. Like we follow this fucking guy. What's his name? Ritek. Ritek, yeah. Dude, like, bro is like a magician, man. Like, with a camera. Siddhita's a real magician. Yeah, so I think they do it on purpose, right? It makes it look like superly bad at it and stuff. I think it's just a part of the comedic. And then Cham Lea is in the background. You're like, what the fuck? I probably play this song. Hens of millions of views. He's wild. It's still a good song. He bangs. Oh, nice. Nice. Number eight. Come on. Yes, you definitely won't just pull it. I freaking love that. What a great call of play. My mom loves this track. Just like hybrid again. Oh, it's a 5. You know, that's neat. Oh, there's no hurry. Oh, chill. Oh, freaking rhythm, though. Yes. I'm just happy that it's a shilpa rao song. The song is actually... Oh, right. The song is... The song that has that Spanish word out of nowhere, right? It's fine. It's a fine... It's like badly conjugated. It's fine. And who is it? We shall be glad you were the writers. It's like... Fine. It's fine. Forgive me for who. But the song is actually really good, but I'm just happy that it's shilpa rao. Me too. Because I'm such a big fan of that one. Like, I would let it pass. I don't care. It's number two in the shilpa. How can you be mad at that? Also, the piccolo is absolutely stunning. Yeah, she is. I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. Meijan. Shout out ADV creations. They actually have really nice comps. I mean, we've checked out a few of them. Go check out the original show love to the original creators as well. We always tag them in the description. It's always fun to check out what people are actually like. Into. Yeah, well, because that's like the biggest metric of finding out how much someone likes something. How many people watch there? How many people sort of like to? I think sometimes in YouTube, because it's part, it's a visual experience as well as like an auditory experience. I believe that a lot of like the views and how you're quantifying the popularity sometimes comes out of natural curiosity. Because people are talking about it and things and you want to find out what the whole hype is about. So I think in that sense, YouTube, it's a very good metric to know how much attention something is getting. But it doesn't actually quantify the quality. Sometimes it's a case where like, it's just a ton of stuff. I guess it's a ton of views that isn't necessarily music really good or just in general. But there are some really good tracks here. Some really good tracks in there. Yeah, I mean, let us know what you guys thought about it. And perhaps what was your most streamed song or your most watched video? I think YouTube's doing like the whole recap thing and Spotify did that whole thing right? Does it wrap every year? So let us know what you are saying in the comments. Your top number one.
