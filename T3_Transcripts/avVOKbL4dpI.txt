as you already saw from the thumbnail on the video 
i am here at the biggest mall in southeast asia  
the sm 8 mall of asia and the driver right now 
that took me over here just told me that you  
couldn't walk through this mall in a single day 
that you need more than a day so here we are it's  
a rainy philippine manila day and we're gonna 
go check out the largest mall in southeast asia  
okay so i'm at the little directory area 
right here so check this out this is one level  
there's a little dot right here and this thing 
is one level and there's i think there's like  
four or five four or five levels so this place 
is freaking massive this is the biggest mall  
i've ever been to in my life i think i found 
finally where spider woman shops look check it out
okay well honestly i've been walking around 
for about 15 minutes and this mall is just  
it's humongous i mean i i don't know it's tough 
because you can see there's like different levels  
but you can't really get the whole scope 
of it because it's all spread out and it's  
kind of like compartmentalized 
so it's not like just one huge  
open area we can see how massive it is what would 
be cool is to like take like a time lapse video  
like 20 minutes of walking and condense it down 
but i mean oh my god this place is crazy they  
got an ice skating rink on the fourth floor 
in manila philippines you check this out
you know you could go skating in philippines
by the way this is in a mall i'm inside a 
mall on the fourth floor inside of a mall  
and then right across here this is like 
a crazy food court food hall which i bet  
you i don't know i gotta go see but i guarantee 
there's probably a lot more of them moa food all  
listen it'd only be right i mean you're in 
the biggest mall in southeast asia right  
you're walking around you don't 
want to go ice skating you don't  
feel like it so what's the next 
best thing you shoot bone arrows
that's awesome now i'm gonna be honest with you 
walking around i think this mall is almost too big  
i mean i'm already lost i've been walking around 
for like 30 minutes now and i can't really fully  
to be honest with you i don't know how to 
get the full scale of this mall on my camera  
this might be like a performing arts center  
or something but they got these two 
huge massive blow-up dolls right here
like this huge arena almost looking place
there's another reason there's always so many 
reasons there's another reason why i love the  
malls in asia so you're walking down the hall 
and just whatever just shop shop then you see the  
neon hallway and he says there's more restaurants 
more shops and that's where the parking lot's at
so then you're walking and then it opens up 
so there's another side on the other side  
that's just like this it's got like a bunch of 
levels it's going to look like shrimp shot it's  
raining right now um and then here's this 
big huge massive supermarket right here too
i've already been walking around this place 
for an hour and honestly i think i've maybe  
walked by like 20 of it okay so 
it's hard to see with this camera  
but you can see it goes way down there i mean i'm 
talking it's probably like 150 yards down there  
it's like another 100 yards down 
there there's a whole other level  
and there's a whole other side that is on the 
other side okay so in this outdoor area that's  
the power it's attached from the mall they got 
this like all the electronics area like they got  
an acer store right there we have a bose store 
right here they have um there's a mac they don't  
have the app of it like the mac store um and we 
had like a dell store right there and right here  
it's called cyber zone and they got a bunch 
of electronics and stuff like that in there  
because usually in malls they just have like 
a mall that has a bunch of different stuff  
like a department store that has all these 
different brands but here they actually got  
a lot of the major brands have their own store 
well first let me say that this cyber zone is  
humongous i mean they got like phones and 
all kinds of computer stores and gadgets  
it goes all the way down here you have stores 
down here you got stores way down here no one has  
a specific kind of microphone i'm actually trying 
to find a microphone right now for my camera i  
lost the piece to my old microphone and um i can't 
replace that piece so i'm looking for a new one  
and i can't find it but if you come to this mall 
you got all kinds of cell phone stuff so all  
your cell phone needs 100 will be met here it's 
crazy okay so i've been here for 90 minutes now  
an hour and a half back in the neon room and uh 
now i don't uh i don't really know what else to  
say about this place so what i'm gonna try to do 
now is gonna try to find some local filipinos i'm  
gonna ask them what they think about it because 
that will be a lot more interesting okay so i  
found my first person so this is justin i have 
justin here with me and she's where are you from  
uh okay so she's from manila and i'm gonna 
ask the first question i asked justin i'm  
gonna say what do you think about the south 
what do you think about that mall of asia  
because this is the biggest mall in southeast 
asia right yep yeah what do you think about  
it oh i think it's a great place for you to 
uh just to hang out with your friends also  
there's the shop there's a lot of shopping here 
uh you have here your comments necessities such as  
clothes we also have luxuries in here such as um 
high-end luxury brands perfumes make-up shoes and  
everything you need basically yeah it's really 
a convenient place to go to yeah i mean do you  
know how do you realize how big it is yes are 
you sure because i think you maybe grew up and  
you're coming here so you don't realize how big 
it is i know it's the third largest mall in asia  
they're largely small in asia really but 
it's the biggest mall in southeast asia right  
isn't it that's what i've been saying 
on my video so i hope that's the case  
yeah well the first time i got here i got lost so 
many times yeah it's crazy right yeah really so  
do you guys have you come here like your whole 
life yeah ever since i was a kid oh really yeah
yeah all right was there anything you 
want to tell to your your fellow filipinos  
is anything you want to say hi stay safe okay 
there it is thank you justin hi and stay safe  
okay so i'm here at the mall i finally found 
the second person and i've honestly i've  
walked around i've asked like 10 people 
and nobody but anyways this is angelica  
not in helicopter right angelica 
okay and she's a saleswoman here  
yes at the mall okay so my first question well

of customers right yeah yeah yeah of course so  
what do you think about this mall because i think 
this is the biggest mall in southeast asia right

courtyard there's a there's a bunch of different 
restaurants there's a bunch of businesses that go  
up and there's two sides of these there's the side 
where i was at where there's a cyber zone and then
