 I hope I'm not going to butcher this, but I believe we are in the town of January. Oh, there's a war. Jan, you worry. No, there's still an hour. How do I say? You are. Yeah, I think that's right. In the town of Anyway, January, something like that. We're just saying we're so foreign, right? We're so foreign. We are down here because we were invited for a fiesta. We have never been to a fiesta before. This is going to be our first time. We always thought fiesta and festival were the same sort of thing, except for a fiesta that turns out you're just going to go from a house to a house and people make food and offer it for well pretty much anybody in the neighborhood, strangers, everybody has turned away. We are told so this is going to be a fantastic new experience for us. Yeah, and this place is located 45-minute drive north of Yeluvila City. We never even heard about it before. And I got to tell you the road going up here. Smooth, two lanes. Beautiful. Yeah. We're going through like farm like rice land, right? So it was really nice. Yeah, with a highly urbanized paved highway, which was not something I expected. So here we go. This is going to be a fun experience. We're looking forward to it. We now learned that it's called Honeyway. Like how beautifully sounding is that. And this is the site of one of the oldest churches here in the Philippines. Unbelievable. We were kind of actually saying I wonder if this is a very, very old church. Sure enough, it is. All right. There we go. Why am I bored? Hello! Wait, wait. Epic, you don't run away on me. This is Epic. Say hello to Epic. Welcome to Honeyway, Piesta. Epic is the one that invited us and we really appreciate it a bit. Oh my god. Yeah, look at those flip-flops. Yes, he's excited for those. Shiny, shimmery. So they recently just had this house built. This is where their ancestral homes are used to be. And yeah, this one looks fantastic. Look how pretty this is. All right, I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming. Welcome. We're not by Query. This is your family. Hello everybody. Yeah. She's following. Oh, thank you. You're the only one we love here. Thank you very much. Thank you. Say hello. So they just built this house and it looks so amazing. I love the natural light and how they did the second floor here. Look at this. Oh, it is a baby. There's a baby. Wow, darling. Hello. You look so good. What's up? Hi, good. This is so fancy. You're so fancy. This is our first time at a house blessing ceremony. This is a house blessing. Okay. I'm not supposed to. You're not feeling too nervous. But the liver acts thrumphine. our father mario help betting money is everywhere was money flying savings money oh I am. Wow, the bringing of lunch all. I'm getting it ready. Look at all the food by the way. There's like full grocery. It's amazing. It's so big. It's so big. It looks pretty. So of course there's a full buffet and then very soft. Salad, desserts, lumpia. Look at that. And more crab. Look at this. Alright, I'm going to get the first taste. Sneak peak of the food to come. Hello. Hello. Look at that. You don't like a lot of time. Right to go on. You don't love the crunchy skin. Oh no wait, you are not a Filipino. No. No, not at all. It's so bad. It's so bad. I'll just take it all for myself. Right, right. You'll sacrifice yourself. I bet. I already filmed the food. There's like crab. There's full of artisari chicken. Like it's crazy. Wow. So much food. But there's a big family. So it makes sense. It makes sense. It makes sense. That's it. Wow. Look at that. I've got literally everything on my plate. A little bit of a lot of time. A little bit. No skin. I stayed away from that. For health reasons. Lumbia. We have everything. Everything. Look at that. Everything. I'm not even proud of them. Oh yeah. You got shrimp going on. You got lasagna. So much good food. Oh my gosh. This is a huge treat. Oh my gosh. I was not expecting this. I'm so happy. It's so good. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so happy. I'm so honored that they invited us for this because definitely not what I was expecting. We met the last night when we were at the very end. And here we are the next day at a fiesta. Oh crazy. And it's how we've never been to. Yeah. Wow. What is this? What? Look at you, Bianca. Wow. She's being all shy right now. Oh. There we go. She's getting shy. Don't get shy now. I hear you laughing. Karaoke is set up here. Of course. Wonderful singer. Of course. And we're going to take a picture. Of course. Everybody's having a great time. Did you? Already out? Still trying to get Bianca to start doing karaoke. She avoids it like the flag agreed to sit down beside her while she did karaoke. It's sunny to go in. It's sunny. It's a little rainy. It's sunny. It's like refreshing. Each of the homes are open and you're free to go in and grab some food to eat. Say hello. That's so interesting to us that you imagine all of your neighbors just opening your doors and people could come in and out and eat all the time. You need a lot of food but just imagine that feeling of community. The group that we were there with many of them traveled from all over in order to attend. So they flew in from other countries everywhere. Manila, here in the Philippines. Germany. Germany everywhere. Really incredible experiences. We're heading into the town part again back to the square and we're going to check out a little bit of the town. Hello everybody. We're going to have a lot of nice houses here also. We're going to have a little Spanish house. Oh yeah, those are beautiful. I'm going to go this way. She went the hard way. It's really cool. Oh, I'm not cool though. It makes sense. Oh yeah, that's pretty. It's beautiful glass. Hello guys. Happy Fiesta. Yeah, everybody having a good time? We're looking at the fish. Oh, there's some big ones. Oh yeah, we've been having a great time. We ate so much food. Oh, come on, the best food in the world. We're surprised we haven't gained weight yet. Speak for yourself. We are back at the square. Oh, now right now, thank you. We're back at the square now or a little bit near it anyway. Just like in Pote 10, they have this huge covered wrong guy. It's number five. It's not open right now, but it's right over there as you can see. Yeah. Yeah, they are getting, I guess they have a stage over here. They can see speakers. So as the sun comes down, I can expect this is probably going to get... I'm assuming it's more of a night market because it is blazing hot right now. I feel like nobody wants to be outside. Yeah, blazing hot, but with rain. It's very interesting, but it actually feels hotter when it rains. It feels more humid. It's the humidity that's just killing us right now. Me especially, I'm a wind when it comes to every night. And you're like at a set of tath in the middle, and we got some girls over here saying hello. Say hello everybody. Did you go and eat at anybody's houses yet? Little fiesta? Look at my carpet. We're at Christmas. You know? Huh? Yeah. Happy Christmas. All right, look at that. We are in the dome, I guess you call it. And we're just going to see what's going on in here. Everybody's hiding from the rain, I think. How's it going? The shirt says hustle hard. Look, I got some rain in my eyes. Some sunscreen. Yeah, so they got the basketball court set up in here. And it does look like at some point they had to go to the beach. It does look like at some point they had something else. Oh, in the stage, yeah, with the speakers. They have their own beauty pageant. Oh, they do. They do. We saw that. We haven't set it up yet. Yeah, we don't, when we asked about it, because we could see all the signs. They said we don't know, maybe it's tonight, but they weren't too sure. Yeah. Because their ancestral home is here in this town, but they're living in a little rilo now. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Their posters are all up here. I don't think they'll show up on the camera, so. But yeah, they have them all up there. Always pretty, always pretty. Of course, the first they are. All right, let's go this way. I think it's raining a little harder. Yeah, if it's raining a little harder, we could stay by the door. Yeah. Oh, that's the very old church. Yes, well, behind us, the very old church. This was an industrial building that he said that in front of it. Very cool though. Yeah. Very cool. I like that old art clicker. I know, the brick. So it is raining, but I don't know. I want to go see the sign. I didn't see it. You saw it. There you go. You have a club. La Vida. Yeah. I think it's being held here though. Oh, by seven. Hello everybody. Yes, yes. Hi, it's number nine. Hi, guys. Hi, guys. Okay, yeah. Now the rain is coming down a little harder. Hello. I'm going to grab a fiesta. Oh, she got shy. She got shy. I always shy half for the fact. Always a camera. Yeah. The lotion going right into my eyes right now. Hello everybody. Hi. Happy fiesta. Hello, happy fiesta. Hi. How fun. Why are there so many students here? Yeah, there is a lot of students. Well, it is a weekend. Oh, it is a weekend. I can feel like tired. Yeah. Come on. She wants the students to go to school on a Saturday. She is longer, I was like, why are there so many people younger than me? Right. Cotton candy, of course. Waston. Wow. Oh. The rain under here. Right in front of the sign. Hi. Hi. All right. Wow. Look at that. Ten pesos. Shorts. 120. 20. 10. 50. Oh, Bianca is excited. How are you, brother? Fine, brother. Awesome. Thank you for that one. You can see everybody is hiding from the rain in here. Yeah. Oh, it is going to get low. It is going to get low. All right. There we go. There we go. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Okay. Oh. Oh. Okay. Yeah, that is really low. There is so much Ucai Ucai in here. Incredible amount of clothes. Holy smokes. Bianca, I find your favorite place. I know. I just have to find my tiny hair. Right. It just keeps going. That is that thing isn't lazy. It makes the heart. Look at that. You are going to get clothes lined so quickly. Okay. Ucai, Ucai, Hunting. While it is raining outside. It is nice and cool in here. You can see the breeze is blowing like crazy. But we got lots of great prices. Yeah. All the prices are listed. It makes it really simple. All right. Bianca has been trying to replace me. So there we go. There we go. And replace me with a body pillow. Well, they have new plastic bags. And with all the rain, that seems like a very good idea for us. So we had to pass on the body pillow. But now she is in here looking at like, Nades and the Ucai Ucai. I think she said there are only 25 pesos. So whatever. Let a girl would do. You know what they say right though. If you got a girl that is not high maintenance, you got a good girl. Okay. Okay. Huh? Make a rain stop here. Oh, I thought that was a little bit dark. And we are back here at the house. You just said it's a terrain again. Yeah. Well, it is not raining for us to walk a little bit. This is actually not as much sweat as normal. It is rain. But yeah, we had a good time. She got a little shopping done. So even though the rain was taking place, we are still able to have a lot of fun. She said we are coming back. We are back. We are back. Hello. Hello Gary Michael. We are back. We are back. We are back. We are back. We are back. We are back. We are back. We are back. We are back. She is from London. She is from London. No, no, no. Yeah. Well, it is time for us to go. This was absolutely amazing. Wow. You know what? You know what? Thank you. Thank you for the experience. This was unbelievable. Wow. We can't even imagine having something like this back at home. And this is like life-themed. Oh, yeah. Plus it was a house. A house bless. Yeah, house bless. But also the fact that here people can come and go and get food. And this whole community, family, it's all really incredible. So I really enjoyed my day. I really appreciate it for everything. Thank you so much again for having us. Yeah. And to all of you out there, thank you very much for subscribing. And we'll see you all later. Bye. Wow. Wow.
