 At that American Walmart, but here the exact same toy is 48 bucks. Oh, I swear I kid you not I thought about that number. Yeah, you need a we need to do the lot of I think the numbers I be wrong point forty eight dollars for a pony for a pony. We don't have to make a pony for a pony What's good y'all? It's a dumber sheds react and we're back with another video who we got today seem today We're back with another American reaction super excited about this video guys if you need to listen We knew to you make sure you scroll down hit that subscribe button Internal post notification bell because we're on the road to 100k and we cannot get there without you guys Alright join the family without further ado. Let's get into the video Hi folks the Philippine up here and almost everyone that's considering visiting or living in the Philippines has asked the question So what is it like you know it's gonna be different, but how the costumes the roads the language the people Well, you might think it's just a sunny paradise. That's otherwise a lot like your home country But it's actually different in so many ways that I hardly know where to start Even you guys that lived here a while are still getting used to things and today I'm gonna talk about a few of those differences. I bet you did it expect Welcome to the wacky way of life in the Philippines It depends on your genitalia Warning to feminists you will definitely be triggered by the following information If you're the kind of woman that's likely to make a scene when told to segregate by sex The Philippines may not be for you. Oh When you approach the entrance to a mall or other retail establishment You might be asked to enter through a special door mark women's entrance. Yeah, I kid you not There can be separate entrances for males and females We're both sexes will have their personal items inspected before they're allowed to go shopping Well, it's rare that your body will actually be touched It's not unheard of to get a pat on your lower back I suppose they're looking for explosives or other illicit items being smuggled inside But why the separate doors You might assume it's so that women can be searched by female guards While the men are checked by other males But 90% of the time all the guards doing the inspections are men Maybe someone can tell me what's going on in the comment section because I have no clue But the goodness for you foreigner That's different And then she said on the lower end yeah That's a culture shot That's definitely a culture shot Okay, so the separation is obviously that's fine. I thought it's gonna be for security reasons right easy for low easy go Um, but when you do the I don't know y'all the pat down the pat down yeah, I've been pat down at the airport I don't like it So it does men doing the pat downs like that on men and a woman I know it could be comfortable uncomfortable for the man to have to watch that And for the woman who don't like to be that intimate or close at all with any other man. So Yeah, we're gonna have to That's a culture shot. That's a culture shot. We're not going to shop Amazon This is that for some reason you won't be subjected to the same level of searches that the locals are And you folks will often get weighed right on through. Oh good It might make you feel embarrassed or guilty that you get preferential treatment That's just the way it is. So enjoy it Breaking the piggy bank Now if you've entered the mall in order to pick up a simple toy for your child Get ready to hold onto your wallet Filipino kids generally don't have as many toys as their western counterparts And this can be one reason why In the west cheap Chinese toys are available everywhere for a couple dollars But here the same items can cost up to five times as much. Oh For example This my little pony only cost seven dollars at that American Walmart But here the exact same toy is 48 bucks. Oh, I swear. Hey, I kid you now. I thought about that number. Yeah Yeah, you need to do the lot of I think the numbers I'd be wrong point 48 dollars for a pony for a pony We're gonna have to make a pony for a pony Gonna make a pony go buy a pony so the kids don't play with toys Literally like that much to the point where you know, you're gonna price the tags all we are you just gonna Put it up. They're gonna hold onto the toys. Oh, yeah, I want to pay for you guys Maybe that's all you gotta still have that's why when you graduate high school So so far we made it through the mall Intrance right and then and are we looking at for shopping for our kids and that's kind of like the way she go on with this You know, we make it and then we look for things for our kids And um, yeah, we're gonna keep walking we ain't gonna stop talking about the ponies. No, I'm glad No, no, no touch That's no toys that long we don't buy that no average Filipino kid doesn't have a bedroom full of toys true For the weeks wage for a piece of plastic The weird thing is that these toys come from the same place right China Which is a lot closer to us than it is to you So question for the moms and the dads and Philippines was up What age do you guys stop the kids from playing with toys? Mm-hmm, you know, I'm saying because obviously it's a thing Well, we don't stop them. Well, they stop at their own we do Yeah, that is true and yeah, so that's the question What age do y'all do they typically stop do they typically stop that's a great way to put it there So what's the reason for the big difference in prices? Once again, I have no clue But when I have a kid I'm gonna teach him to play outside Oh, why should yourself speaking of expensive toys if you try to buy a household appliance Don't expect to find one like you're used to Things like dishwashers and clothes dryers are often about twice as much as they cost in the West And let's you want to buy the little toy versions like this one which is completely made of plastic. Oh, yes These are the actual appliances Not something you find in the same department as easy-bake office With college now this washers a little on a small side, but at least it's only $360 US Why so cheap because it's a four model with a hole in the front window duh Not only are appliances incredibly expensive, but you can imagine how difficult it is to get them serviced Most parts have to be ordered and good luck finding someone qualified to install them So it's no wonder that washing machines and dryers are considered luxury items and even comparatively wealthy Filipinos just hire a housekeeper to do the work by hand So you can see 10 million peso homes with clothes lines strong up in the backyard I'm about to do a video on how to look that's not wrong with that. I mean If you if you grew up in the black neighborhood the project for instance We had we had clothes lines with clothes all over show that wouldn't be much of a culture shot But the the appliance buying and trying to understand with why they don't you know, I'm saying that's more of a culture shot And not just even black people just in lower income areas a lot of us didn't have um washing dryers so we used the sun and we'd watch the clothes ourselves We'll watch board Yeah, they had a little it like have like little ridges and you We just use a washroom you just use your hand see when you say how's everybody see not just can't relate today I mean use a washboard We we just had it like it was so guard it was You know, I'm saying it's just like that. It's just think of a board and you washing it rubbing it I'm familiar with it like a middle wasn't It's okay. I'm calling you mama Mama's yeah, I got a question Okay, and hire a good housekeeper and if you're gonna be living here It's one of the best investments you can make so stay tuned One step the disaster for some reason Many Filipinos aren't very interested in having a front yard Even nice homes are sometimes built right against the road and I do mean right against it You could literally take one step outside your front door and get into a truck I'm not sure why we do this, but it's a fairly common site especially in the city It's much more likely to have a backyard, but even those are usually pretty small We like to build our houses right up against our property lines, but it doesn't leave much room to enjoy the great outdoors Four lane roads aren't As anyone is visited the Philippines knows the roads here are used for lots of things besides driving The streets often become parking lots places for animals to sleep vendors to sell their products and people often just stop their cars in the middle of the road Turn on their blinkers and go inside a store to do some shopping Even four lane roads are just two lane roads with parking on either side Okay, you can't really drive in the right lane for more than just a short distance Which means that if you want to pass someone you have to go into uncommon traffic to get around the guy in front of you At the last The fact that drivers here don't look what's coming when they pull out into the road It's actually your responsibility not to hit them which doesn't make sense to foreigners, but don't say I didn't warn you All this makes for some exciting afternoons behind the wheel But it's one of the things that makes the Philippines what it is But I read that is Lemonade stand or liquor stand But aside from all the irritating things you'll find blocking your way out there on the street You're also liable to find something you just don't see in the west Homemade liquor for sale Yep, many Filipinos sell their own kind of moonshine called tuba Which is made from palm tree sap We climb the coconut trees collect the sap from the bud up near the top Then ferment it with bark from a mangrove tree But the most interesting thing is that here in the Philippines Private citizens can actually sell their alcohol to the public right on the street It's usually about 250 pesos or five US dollars for a gallon so it's a lot of bang for the book Now you're wondering about things like health inspections permits and licenses and all kinds of government oversight Regarding the sale of homemade alcohol, but that's Western thinking This may be one of the only things that's actually easier to do here in the Philippines So when you want to pick up a little pick me up you can probably find it alongside the road on your way home And if you don't have time to stop at a local sorry sorry store Just send your child to pick it up Oh wow, that's a good way My parents asked me to stop on my way home from elementary school and buy a jug of tuba and I was never once asked to produce my sixth grade ID Two left feet. That's cool. I remember like in elementary school my grandmother would have a note to the The owner our worker of the store. We showed them the note and they give us whatever she needed Yeah, yeah, that was of the past today. They'll probably get in trouble for that Not probably they will I feel like there's more involved in the communities Like they knew they knew who's around the block. They knew who lives in certain locations. So oh that's such and such a grand baby right there Have you ever noticed that when you're out walking around with Filipino friends and one of you steps in something nasty It always seems to be you It's because every Filipino is equipped with ground scanning radar that alerts us to the presence of rocks mud puddles cow patties dump who That's trash might like a taste of We take it for granted that every surface is a minefield and it's pretty funny to watch all this tumbling and bumbling that you foreigners Have to go through to get from point A to point B. So don't get frustrated when you're Filipino acts as a seeing I dog and keeps calling out all the crap in your path You might feel like a feeble old man being guided down a flight of tricky steps But in reality we're just trying to help and because we don't want to have to be the ones to clean the poo off your shoe Just remember your next step is never as safe as your last The fleeting greeting So let's move on to some cultural differences that'll help you out when dealing with Filipinos When you're meeting one of us for the first time if you don't want an awkward encounter Forget everything you've ever learned about social protocols If you're older than the person you're meeting and you reach out for a handshake They'll probably think you're asking for respect and take your hand and press it to their foreheads Which is a gesture called Mino ball It's all about ancient status here which can make foreigners very uncomfortable Because most of you guys don't face respect on age. It's based on merit But you think if that was to happen to a foreigner that acts are you okay? Like they'll think you're saying like you have a fever Yeah, you want to check your body Yeah, like you want us to check if you're feeling a little burnt you know saying so That's probably they're probably out of it Yes, but Asians they have a deep respect for their elderly you know, which is good Yes, and not a lot of other citizens of other countries do So I respect that I respect that Quickly find out the shaking hands isn't really a thing here And for your Europeans who are used to a quick kiss on a cheek or even a double pack Don't do it It'll not only be seen as very presumptuous But your behavior is bound to be the topic of conversation Just as soon as you leave the room and not in a good way It's pretty much the same thing with hugging Filipinos occasionally hug but it's used more sparingly and for specific reasons Generally speaking where just not a very touchy feeling people is passionately in public And if you goof up while you really have to worry about is the reaction of your Filipina If you see you leaning in to hug or kiss another woman for any reason Even if it's her mom you'll awaken the beast within So prepare to get mold Well, that's it for today really I felt like yeah a lot more than help us understand because that was different Yeah, that was different so you guys are a little good like y'all y'all on the um pd a side You know no pd a no pd a you know yeah So We're gonna have to you know not be kissing and hugging and all that in public husband I just should be telling you then No I'll be chilling. I just I love you Yeah, but this was a good video um really enjoyed learning the dudes and the dogs yeah, yeah of y'all culture We were allowed to continue to learn more about Filipino culture So we hope you guys enjoyed this video with us like this video subscribe Turn on the post notification bell We haven't able to super things to see like sports channel that way as well as our reaction request link is in our description box below We'll see you soon.
