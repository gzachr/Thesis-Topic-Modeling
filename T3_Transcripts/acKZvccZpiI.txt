 So good! Yeah? Oh, this one's really good. I'm moving to Philippines. I'm peaceful. I have to start a whole new life, isn't it? Another day, another Jollybee video. What's up, Philippines? I am back with another reaction video. And today I am reacting to American Troy Jolly before the first time. All the things. So I'm very curious to see what they have to say. Because as you know, the US is very influenced by McDonald's and Burger King. And Wendy's and KFC and what not. I honestly believe that Jollybee has one of the best fried chicken. But I'm very curious to see what they have to say and how it goes. Y'all the way? Let's just jump straight into it. Shall we? No. I've heard of it, but I've never seen or heard. What? Jollybee. The world's great. My boy, John Oliver. Oh! John Oliver's great. Jollybee can promise you happiness. Oh, he can promise you happiness. And I'll be happy. Oh my gosh, I just saw this! Go off. It's Jollybee. Oh my gosh. I guess please. Jollybee can dance better than I can. Jollybee is a wildly popular Filipino fast food chain with... I've read on my posted a video about a little party with Jollybee. And it was kind of like the same thing. So I was just like, where can I book this? I'm gonna do this. I'm gonna do this. Beat that thing in my birthday party as well. I can't really care if I can dance better than I can. Jollybee is a wildly popular Filipino fast food chain with... ...12-thirt locations worldwide. And today we're gonna be trying it. That's fine. Alright, good for you. Great. I always wanted to try it, but no one has told me what to get. Oh. Okay. I'll ask some of you KFC. Oh, she can. You can try chicken. Spicy. Presentation. So first up, we have chicken joy. Chicken joy is basically the Filipino counterpart to KFC, but it's so much better. It's described as being perfectly seasoned to be crispy, delicious on the outside and crispy delicious inside. And juicy, delicious. I have to say how you not love that. It smells great. I've never had deep fried chicken before. What? Juicy, delicious. We'll see. On chicken, you gotta go for this again first. Yes. This is great. It's the perfect amount of fried chicken, isn't it? That is juicy, delicious. Yes. Okay. I'm moving to Philippines. I'm going to be cool. I have to start a whole new life, isn't it? It's like a chicken nugget, but like, I want a stick. What a bone. There we go. Not a stick. You know we're going to try a stick. I'm scared. If it's giving you like really, really spicy. Okay. It's a good amount of spicy, I would say. Oh. So good. Wow. Oh, this one's really good. It's actually not that spicy. Like it's just like peppery. I ain't going to lie. This is killing KFC though. D. Delicious. Whoa. It's going back. Spicy is kicking in. Oh well. Now it's getting kind of spicy. There's some spice. Wow. That was like a really delayed, didn't hit me with the spice until just now. I would rate this as well. Because the flavor is really nice. It's seasoned very well. How do I rate this an eight? 10 out of 10. Yes. It's so good. Yeah. I would give this a 10 out of 10. It was one more. I would give it a 11 out of 10. It makes you want to move to the Philippines. In 2017, Jolly B marketing win viral. Not for its beloved mascot, but for a video series called Quintam centered around a Valentine's Day and love. Oh. Oh. So busy enjoying this Jolly B is getting to see you. Cute. Cute. Yeah, the Jolly B adds up. I'm just... How did you get that in her locker? I want a guy that will do that for me. Where do I find one of these guys? Oh no. Shearing for you too. Ha ha man. Yeah. Now's your chance. Now's your chance. Oh my god. They're meeting it last. She has like my last. She has like my hero. Ew. Go away. Maybe talk to her in person. That would help. If that's the end, go. Okay. What did you say? They better not be the end. Oh my god. Is this the reunion? Is this one their older? Oh. Oh. If the guy would bring me food, I will instantly fall in love with him. That's love. For those who didn't give up on love. So great. The joy of love. It's so cute. That was emotional. That was fire. That was awful. We have the classic yum. Yes. It is emotional. Those ads are just, I mean, I don't know if you can see it, but I get goosebumps if I just think about it. They're so romantic. And it's just like watching a movie and you're just rooting for the characters. And it's so good. Oh. So romantic. I have the classic yum burger with Jolly B's special sauce. One of the initial food items sold by Jolly B at their first flagship product. Does it come with a guy? The cheesy yum burger. Oh, yum burger. Yum burger. This reminds me so much of McDonald's. And I bet it's even better. I like the sauce. First thing you taste is the sauce. It's nice. It's like a, oh. Not like a big sauce person, but like I like a little sauce. It's a nice sweet ale. Yeah. Look at that. It's so good. It's so good. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it. It's so good. Let's look at that sauce. But wait, do you eat it with the cooking of it out? I always remove the cooking. Just can't. It tastes like frosting. I don't think this sauce really goes well on a burger. Hello? Prince Charmi? He's not here. So that's a downside of the burger. I would get this. No, no, no, this is it. Okay. Give it like an eight. Give it an eight. Let's go eight. Okay. All it is is meat, cheese, and the sauce. It's awful, right? And it's really flavorful. I would write this as a four because I don't know. I was expecting more. I would write this. An eight out of ten. You could tell that there is no cap in my wrap one if it was living up. What's coming next? Oh. No idea what this is about to be. It's a candy. Okay, childhood memory is for you. What the heck? The legendary Jolly Spaghetti features noodles, round meat, sliced hot dogs, and their signature sweet sauce made with banana ketchup. Those things are all things that made sense individually, but together. Hot dog pasta. How can you go wrong? They don't have the banana ketchup. They're all sweet flavor in there. It's going to be interesting. Oh, this is not how bananas are strong. Like, you get a banana in the smoothie and it's killing everybody in there. A four thing with spaghetti and fast food rice? I love those sweet things, but I should know about with my spaghetti. I'm writing what does she have on knife? Usually you did with just... It's actually not bad. If one of these is like a legendary hockey sauce. I hate that I got to be like the Simon, the Simon Cowell of this right now. But the sauce is peculiar. I think having the hot dogs in it makes it seem more fast food. Little red pepper and this, all in these red crushed flakes. Yeah, my brain is confused because it thinks it's going to go towards tomato side, but it's a little lighter. I will rate this one. It's on the sweet side. I'll give it a 9 out of 10. I'd probably rate this like a six. It still tastes good. Like, it doesn't taste bad. I just probably wouldn't order it. I'd rate this a six. Not my favorite. I'd say like a six point five. It hurts my heart, but then it does it because it's just life. We've got to touch your heart. It's like a mystery. That's true. Oh. Shrimp today. It's on shrimp. Oh, it smells so good. What is happening right now on my mind? So this dish is called... It is a palabok. It's also called... What? It's the classic Filipino dish that comes with an array of toppings. The last noodles are covered with a garlic sauce. How about a jolly bee? It's a little bit of a rinds, shrimp, and egg for a party. Like, no other. Do you smell going on here? I never seen something like this before. Never. Never. You're kidding me. We're up to here. It tastes like... It's kind of bland. Yeah, I really like this one. It's so good. That is my new disgusting. Oh, you're good. I like the garlic sauce. It's very nice. I think it's like the noodles we saw. The last noodles are so good. Other words that it can use than disgusting. It's jellyfish. I'm not like a huge fan of like any of the things that are on this. It's just going to happen in. Not doing it for me. Help. And this looks like it would be served at a nice restaurant. Not a fast food place. Maybe it's a 5. So I'll give this a 7. 10 out of 10. I give this a 10 out of 10. You don't have enough food. It's not king of me. I would rate this a 3. It's a big help. I would rate this a 7. The garlic sauce really tips this one over the edge for me. So I should play. My new favorite fast food restaurant. What else could they possibly serve at this place? This is more of my alley right here. Okay, we have like some type of mushroom. Yeah. Hattie. This is a savory sweet burger patty that's smothered with mushroom gravy and sourness. For a degraded gravy. It became burger steak. Burger steak. Hmm. I love it. I can't believe this is hamburger. I just... I'm going to eat with rice, you know. Gravy? Gravy any day. I want the cheese. And with gravy. I like this. It's not some simple. Yeah. It's me. Rice. The sauce is really good in flavor. What? I agree. I will definitely be getting this. After your workout meal, you know. I guess we really... It's both in season one. It's really good actually. And this is something that I could eat and not feel too guilty about as well. It reminds me of some type of like dish I had in like elementary school for some reason. It's like a pre-packaged meal. Let's do a look. And I like this. I would rate this in 8.5 because it's kind of guilt free. All right, just a second. The first off is different. Nobody's coming with a burger steak. Nobody. Six. Probably seven. Oh, surprising. It's not that hard. I can't do anymore. Give it a 10 now. Is growing on me? This is not a 10. Amazing. Everybody. It feels like somebody's just like saying take one more. Solid teeny dinner for sure. I just need some of the long time to do this. I see where he came from. Who would be the best? McDonald's in slightly okay. Finally, have jolly bees. Ube pie. Similarly portable like McDonald's apple pie. But filled with the earthy sweet and stunning purple am called people. Are you kidding me? This is like a treat that you would get at Disney land. This is like a treat that you would get at Disney land. Charlie and a chocolate bag. It's very easy to impress. What are you trying to do? It's not too sweet. It's the right of me. Yeah. It tastes like a carrot. It tastes like a carrot. Like a custard flaky donut. Oh man. The outside is fantastic. Yeah, it's crunchy. It's the crust that they use is so delicious. It's sweet but it's not like so sweet that I feel like over sugar. That's the last color you would expect to be in a pie. But the jam is really good. I wouldn't expect that. I would give this an 8 because it's delicious. I'll rate this a 7. A 7. 9 out of 10. 9 out of 10. I would rate this a 5 because... Personally, I'm not a big sweet man. There is a lot of jam. Oh my god. This girl. I didn't know about this until today and I am completely so... So we're all up. Like it. Try it. Do it. It's amazing. So we've tried this but what do you guys think? Have you tried this before? Let us know in the comments below. And tell us. What should we try next? As always, be sure to like, subscribe, and tell your friends. Okay, yeah. Definitely give them a sub. That was a very... Bye. Very well done video. Bye. Love. Very well done video. Very interesting for me also to see how they reacted to it, how they rated it. And I think it has something to do with the cultural background that you are from. So some people prefer rather the sweet taste and the savory taste. And you know, it's like oily and fatty and crazy but it's... I mean, to be honest, the chicken joys are just like out of this world. It's one of those things when you go out and you just need something substantial. That's when I get my chicken job. But anyways, if you enjoyed this video, give that thumbs up.
