 But you're Friday. The freshest. Ah, okay. Best Filipino street singers out of 2020. This is from Graham K. Gills and his channel and his... It's really serious. Fantastic show that by the way I haven't been drinking in my own time. This is so cool of me because you're about to see why. But yeah, I'm really excited to share it with all of you and watch some of these performances for the first time. It's basically proved my theory that everyone in the Philippines is not noble and they cannot sing. You know what I mean? That's not normal. The fact that everyone can sing randomly on the street. If I try to keep fine, top Filipino singers, street singers. They just happen to be random people that are going about their lives and singing like freaking rock stars in the middle of the street with a karaoke. And he's awesome. I've actually been talking and they were not constanating. But anyways, he's awesome and his idea is freaking brilliant. He knows he's got full support and I'm so happy people enjoy this stuff. And the fact that he's free, this could be a show. Absolutely. This should be now some primes. Netflix get on this. It's such a clean idea. Like it then travels around the world. You know what I mean? It's such a clean idea. But that's the concept of the whole show. So it's just not anyways. You know, but amazing they came up with it and they actually followed through with it. But anyways, let's give this a watch. This would be the best one. Right? So this is just the best of the best. Let's go. Straight singer. He's got his broadest many highs and lows. Here are our top five singers from 25 performers as well. But there are full songs I think. So this is very cool. I'm going to ask these guys. Okay, go ahead. Jana from QC sent her version of No One by Alicia Kees. That's a hard song. She's like, can't be long for. What's wrong with? Anything. Can't hit. I'm not quite there. Oh, wait. I'll give you time to think. So basically we have a show called Street Singing Superstar. We've got around the streets. I love the foundation. I love him too. He's such a good. I'm sorry. Just not a sample. A sample. A sample. It's a sample. Sing that whole song. Jana. Jana. How does that work? I got QC. What does that mean? I don't know. I don't know how to do that. Just do it. You're going to be a little bit more handsome. What? Just have to be a little bit handsome. You're going to be a little bit more handsome. I don't know. I'm going to sing. I don't know. Oh, good question. I don't know. The good question is, say a little bit. Oh, interesting. Cool. We're going to sing. Yeah, just really good. Just going. Yeah, just really good. Bro, you'll get run over, though. Yeah, they're chilling in the middle of the road. What part would you want? I would read my. That's evil. What am I thinking? I don't know.

Oh, he's recording with his fine as well. No, he's showing the lyrics. I agree. Come on, she was chilling. That is so cool. I thought it would be best to blend in with the part dollars. But the locals are really good at this. What? Did we just have a video? We're just chilling. We're filming. I could never do that. I could never. Excuse me. Would you like to see?
