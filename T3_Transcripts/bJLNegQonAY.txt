Welcome to another day in Paradise. Yes, we're in Paradise. We are in Shrugow and it's a beautiful day for island hopping. So we're going to visit the three islands, Dacquo, Naked Island. We have little lofie with us today and our Swedish family. So let's head out in the water and let's get this adventure starting. Let's go! Okay, we signed in. We're not both men. We fill up with drinks and snacks. And I think we're going to hit the boat. Like and subscribe. It's low tide right now so we're going to have to walk out through the water. There to our boat. We'll see how little lucky will handle it if you give it a swim or not. This is our tour guide for today. Why? Did I hide? Yeah, we're going to the Shrugow. This may be our mini-epalm of the season. That's great. It's going to be a good day. What is so hot right now is like stepping into a warm bathtub. And lots of people have broke. We're going to the trail end. First we're going to Dacquo. We're going to Dacquo. We're going to the next station to make it. What's best about the Naked Island? Naked because this is the world naked. Yeah, great. The Naked Island is our first destination. This is Dacquo Island. It means big island. Oh really? I didn't know that. This is the big island and we're coming here to eat. And there's rumors about this amazing Voodoo fight, which we're going to check out soon. And remember what happened in the last vlog? Our watchers got really upset. Yeah, I did stumble a bit on my words there. No, no. That Voodoo fight wasn't a shrugow thing, but it's not. It's not. So a Voodoo fight is different. Made, came in the second world war, I think, with the soldiers we're sharing the food with everyone. Swedish people, are you excited? Yeah, it's very hot. It's a Salamat Kalajau. Salamat Kalajau. Salamat Kalajau. Okay, so I love this. Thank you. Salamat. Wow. So in a true Filipino style that we're starting today with some red horse. Obviously, let's see how our Swedish families are enjoying that. How strong is it? What's wrong? 1,000 kicks. Cheers. 4 surgao. Cheers. Hi. Bye guys. Come by. Come by. All right, keep going in traditions, okay? Come by. I love some soba. We're making a deal here, me and Emma. If this video gets more than 5,000 likes, she actually says she's saying I have red horse for her 45. I don't even drink beer. Yeah, but 5,000 likes, I just have red horse. So it helps me out on this mission. It helps Emma have her first Filipino beer ever. We've been here 2,5 years. She's still having that drop of red horse, so I hope maybe this liked it. Okay, we got to take a look in the kitchen. Preparing our beautiful feast. Our... What's cold? Our buddha fight. Is there a preparation here? Yeah. They're working on our buddha fight, eh? What are we writing? Welcome to Paradise. Welcome to Shagawa. We're going to Shagawa. The food has arrived. Food is here. We're here for Shagawa and on the buddha fight. We are so hungry, so I'm super excited about it. And the food says... Sweden to Shagawa. How can this be? Beautiful. We got all kinds of food here. We got a meal looking fish. We have shrimps. We have all kinds of fruits. We have mango. We have melon. And we had before in my life. What is it? It looks slightly scary to be honest. Shall we try? Okay. We have even more shrimps, even more fruits. We have some calamari. I'm going to take one of these. Oh wow! You're full? Take this and this is the next one. Okay. Let's take this and pull. Yeah, pull all of it. And then see if it's sweet sauce. Oh my gosh! Wow! Super! I can't even do that. Wow! Wow! First buddha fight ever! Are you excited? Yes, really. Alright, so it's their first buddha fight ever. Of course, we don't have anything similar in Sweden. Where you eat with your hands and every when you're eating from the same like table, haven't happened in Sweden. Are you excited babe? I am so excited. You know me, I can keep going and going and we come to the park. And I can't wait for my hand in the park. And all this food is for us. We are only five people. And Wando. Lucky are you excited? I think lucky is excited too. And there is so much food. Well, because I don't think we will finish it. Do you think we will finish it? I don't think we will finish this. Okay, let's get into it, shall we? Do you think we will finish the food? No. Okay, we need to check out. Let's eat! Alright, let's try some of the fish, shall we? So fish. Soy. Mmm, this is so simple but so good. Fish with some soy, vinegar, chili, perfect every time you spray. And everything is super fresh. It is straight from the ocean. But it can't be better than that. Lucky, you want some? You want a little bit of fish? No, be it night. Ooh! What do you think it is? Lucky approves. I want something. I went back home. I could feel the butterfly in my stomach. Feel the butterfly in my stomach. Then I ride home. I see some weather. I feel you'll be so happy. Hello! Welcome to my vlog. Thank you. Welcome to our vlog. John, I need you. Thank you so much, guys. We're dressing as. Thank you, Mr. And also Mr. Boom. Yes, we still don't use to eat with our hands. We never do that. We also use our spoon and fork and stuff. Some of us already gave up. Did you? I don't know. I'm far from giving up. I love this octopus. So good. Sweet. Yes, I have. You give up? I'm worried. You're still going at it. You're still going at it? I'm getting started. And Lucky is still going at it. We still have a lot of food left. But let's see if you can eat everything. I am so full right now. I really did give it my best. But it's still plenty of food left, actually. I think I'm going to fail this one. We have a lot of rice left. We have a lot of noodles. We have a lot of, like, up to the first. We still have some of the shells. What else? Some cucumber over there. Some veggies. Some eggplant. Maybe one more. I think I'm done as well. It's too much food for us. But it was really, really good. It's time to leave Daku Island. We have been here for quite a few hours, actually. Eating a lot of food. Now, I think the next destination is Naked Island. So see you there. It's such a good island to have lucky free as well. He can't really run anywhere. Look at this. It's like this big. And we're going to find him wherever he goes. Yeah, he's lost him. There he is. Alright, that was Naked Island. It's always a beautiful place to go. It's a beautiful place. It's a beautiful place. It's a beautiful place. It's a beautiful place. Alright, that was Naked Island. There's always a beautiful place to go out to. It's a beautiful, beautiful swimming ocean. But I say bye. I'm impressed by how lucky was loving the water. It was actually by himself going out swimming with us. It feels great. I really want to train him to be an island dog for real. Alright, so last destination for today. Guillaume Island. Guillaume Island. Meaning what does Guillaume Island mean? It's Guillaume Island. Okay. Daqo, Big Island, Guillaume, small island. Fantastic. We've got it now. Alright, we're at Guillaume Island, the little island. We actually love, I think this is my favorite island of all of them. Yeah, it's great. Just going out here for a sunset is something. It's tiny. And especially now with the water so high. It's really really high, high tide. We're going to make, we went here a few evenings just to check out the sunset. It's so close to Yeneraluna. It's only like 10 minutes, we've got. Yeah, beautiful place. Alright, so this village people are asking for some coffee. So let's get some coffee, you. Okay, what are you doing? What are you doing? No. No. So we are enjoying the sunset here on Guillaume Island. But since last time they have upgraded a bit so these shares are new. Like, we're not here before. Alright, now I need to give up my share again to my mom. How was the swing? They wanted to take a picture of the swing. Because I have a picture when I'm on the swing. I can put it here. And now my mom want to take the same one. How did it go? Did it take the picture? Yes, but it's not really. Yeah, they took a picture by the swing as well. Alright, I absolutely love these days when we get to do a bit of touristing even in our own homes. So this tri island tour, the naked island, Guillaume Island and Daco Island, small and big island. We know that now. I think that's one of my favorites. You can really go out here, have a good day, swim around, have a good old fight, amazing. We have done it a lot of times already, but I guess we're going to go on these kind of tours. Every time we have friends and family, we'll be sitting in this. Because we have a lot more family members and friends that still need to come to the Philippines. Come on, we'll be sitting in this. Yeah. So thanks everyone who made this tour possible.
