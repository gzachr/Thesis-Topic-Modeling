okay this is a eden cheese hello guys welcome 
back so i like to make filipino adobo with a twist  
today and i'm really excited because um i like to 
use of course like chicken or pork for adobo this  
time i want to use a swordfish okay do you use 
swordfish in the philippines i think you do by the  
way what is the tagalog word let me know in the 
comments okay um swordfish in adobo i think it's  
kind of exciting i don't want to use too much 
marinade because this is a good quality fish  
and i want to try uh you know i want to keep the 
the fish flavor anyways let us try to make a nice  
adobo hope you like it so see let's start now here 
we have the swordfish okay they look really good  
they're still a little bit icy i took them out 
of the freezer but they have been uh defrosting  
for several hours let's wait a little bit longer 
okay in the meantime i will cut some red onions  
and also now i'm using red onions today do 
you use red onion or white onions for your  
adobo let me know okay because i think 
mainly i see people using white onions  
in the philippines but just because 
today is a twist i'll use red onions
okay so let's cut these so i 
will set these onions aside  
okay put them in a bowl i'm also using 
soy sauce and white vinegar of course
so i have no idea how this dish will turn 
out but i guess it will be very yummy  
so i'm adding a little bit of sukkah here just 
wait suka okay not too much like i said because  
i want to keep it simple and also some soy 
sauce of course toyo tuyo toyo i forgot
okay so a little bit of soy sauce i 
usually do 50 50 okay so i use a 50 50  
vinegar and soy sauce let me know how you would 
do it okay maybe you would use a little bit less  
vinegar but personally i like it a little bit 
sour especially with fish now i know that some  
of the viewers don't like sugar sugar in adobo 
or sugar in sisig or whatever but i like to use  
a little bit okay so i'm not using too much of 
course i don't want to make this dish sweet but  
just a little let's say two teaspoons okay about 
two teaspoons gotta put now what else do we need  
um of course okay so i'm gonna chop some ba 
one uh just three or four cloves not so much  
they're not so big anyway so let's cut them first 
what else do we need black pepper right i think  
i'm gonna use uh black pepper actually this is 
a four seasons pepper i think that's always nice  
with adobo right and maybe a little bit uh if 
i have i need to check uh laurel laurel okay so  
you see these um are tiny cloves of garlic okay so 
let's chop them a little bit so that's our bawang
so let me just drizzle some 
olive oil on the swordfish
so just rub this in olive oil on both sides okay  
to prevent sticking okay and then let's also 
add some pepper to these fish steaks okay
of course no filipino food without rice
there we go the rice it always 
makes me happy to cook filipino food  
especially if i can share it with others you know 
so make sure to have the rice turned on first  
okay i'm super excited to cook this filipino 
food with a twist okay so here um these are  
the uh steaks uh swordfish steaks okay the pan 
is getting hot okay i'll make sure that it's  
it's quite hot first and then i'll add the steaks 
okay they already have olive oil so this should be  
fine so let's make this happen guys let's give 
it a try okay i'm already getting good donut  
so let's put these steaks in you hear 
the sound let's sear them a little bit
okay
okay let's wait a little bit longer 
before we flip them over okay  
let's see okay carefully okay there we go
look set up you back and another one
okay
so what i'll do is i'll take them out right 
now um i'll put them in a bit of thin foil okay
because i don't want to overcook these  
and later i'm going to add them to the 
sauce okay so just put them in oil like that
just wrap them and set them aside for a while okay
now in the meantime the pan is really hot 
i'm gonna reduce the heat a little bit okay
we'll add the bawang
might not be enough oil so i'm also adding the 
sibuyas let's add a little bit more oil guys  
all right it's too dry just cool 
mantika okay i know you don't like  
so much oil but they are very dry at 
the moment so just a little bit okay
now let's add the suka
okay
now let's add back the steaks the fish okay  
so inside they are still not cooked yet fully 
cooked so i'm adding them to the adobo mix
there we go
so i'll make sure to cover them in 
the onions and sauce a little bit okay  
then i'll turn down the heat more very 
low heat okay and then i'll just cover it  
okay leave it like this actually i decide to just 
switch up the the heat completely because the fish  
is already cooked a little bit and just let this 
sit for a while okay maybe like i think at least  
five minutes or so fish will be really tender 
inside you know so let's have a look at the fish
let's look inside if it's cooked
yeah look at that i think it's ready to eat guys 
we'll do the plating first i'm gonna put some rice
then we will add the swordfish
with sibuyas now since it's adobo i'm going 
to add a bit of the sauce not too much just a  
little bit now add some japanese crackers to this 
bit i think it's a nice combination some pickles
a little bit of acidity
and some spicy sauce this is our 
swordfish adobo now let's eat there we go  
swordfish though i'm very excited for 
this one let's try it tikman na natin
oh set up yeah  
it's still very juicy on the inside that's 
nice that's exactly what i wanted to achieve
oh it has a really good really good 
taste with rice let me try it with rice
and a little bit the spicy sauce
together with some japanese crackers
and pickles
very nice i'm gonna enjoy this dish 
and then what what will be for dessert  
i i already have an idea what would be a nice 
dessert with this one so let's eat it and then  
let's have a look at the dessert okay
for dessert i'm eating a calamansi 
sorbettes with a little bit of whipped cream
i think this is a nice dessert 
after the swordfish adobo
very fresh and a little bit sour taste you know
and set up would you like to see some footage of 
me cooking in the philippines actually i always uh  
hoped that i would have some footage somewhere and
