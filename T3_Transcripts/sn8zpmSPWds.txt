 Hey everyone, Kamusapokayang Lahat. Welcome back to our channel. I know it's been a minute. You're probably wondering what's up. I've just been so busy with family and homeschooling.

Anyway, guys, I just want to share the short video of our recent Filipino feast right after a church. I wasn't prepared to record this event because it last minute, lang poto. Here they are, some of them. So the reason behind this feast is to celebrate, oh, it's okay. Let me back up a little bit. My friend, Mrs. Annabelle, actually the only other Filipino family that attends the same church that we belong to.

You're welcome. Congratulations. You can help me birthday. It looks good. Have it. Looks good.
