She's got an advantage here, okay? So then on the other side, I know, I know, nobody knows who this is. But this is Bianca. Now listen guys, I don't want any fighting, okay? Right? Right? Right? Like, when you guys touch hands, go into the ring. Alright, so the challenge is they each get 1,000 pesos. They're gonna go into the two, one of the two, or both of them, whatever they want. But they only have 10 minutes. They got to spend their 1,000 pesos out of these two Uka-Uka-Uka's, get the best value, the best stuff.
