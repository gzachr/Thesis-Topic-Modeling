so good now it makes sense to me as to why it's 
called jollibee since being here we've noticed  
that the filipinos are in fact jolly welcome now 
to give you an idea of just how popular jollibee  
is here in the philippines there's more jolly bee 
outlets than mcdonald's yes mcdonald's and they've  
also spread globally because of their success safe 
to say that jollibee is iconic let's find out why
okay so we just ordered everything we could that 
was on the menu and there was a like chicken  
witch which is like a sandwich crust with chicken 
and it was out of stock like out of order so we  
got literally everything else so there is so much 
food here there's like burgers spaghetti hot dogs  
everything like that but i'm really excited i've 
been waiting to try this spaghetti for so long  
because i've seen that you guys have here in the 
philippines spaghetti everywhere like mcdonald's  
kfc jollibee everywhere and you let me know 
in the comments do you like what i like do  
you not like what i like what's your favorite 
things in jollibee there is so much food here  
let's get into it okay so i think it's only 
fair that i start with just the plain yum burger  
let's try this it's very small you've got just the 
meat some buns and some sauce that's literally it  
so let's try this one it's very plain obviously 
very simple can you go wrong not sure i don't mind  
that i can see like if you had like little kids 
or like a younger brother or sister that that like  
would be what you get like at home in australia 
would get them like the happy meal which is just  
like a plain cheeseburger you probably get 
them like that it's quite quite plain and i  
think very simple out of them item on the menu but 
probably quite important guys i've been waiting  
to have this like jolly sketty what do you call 
it jelly spaghetti for so long and it's really  
interesting because it says sweet sweet sauce all 
right i'm gonna get some of this jolly spaghetti  
you know that reminds me of yeah they're like tin 
spaghettis back home in like the tin it's really  
sweet as well yeah exactly i think that's what 
it is i think the sweetness reminds me we have  
like tin spaghetti back home and you'd give 
that to like um kids or if you want like a  
snack at the office or something at work um 
but the sauce in that one is sweet i think  
that's what is reminding me of that it totally 
reminds me of that spaghetti do you like it more  
i like normal spaghetti more like if you go 
to like a normal no like if you went to like  
an italian restaurant obviously i prefer that 
spaghetti i prefer it more of a savory taste  
but to be honest the sweet taste 
kind of taking me by surprise  
all right so i need a little bit of a palette 
cleanser so i'm going to try the iced tea um there  
was like normal drinks soft drinks like sprite 
co code zero so i'm gonna try the iced tea well  
that's nice peacho lemon not sure maybe lemon this 
one i'm excited for we have the cheesy yum burger  
now i've just noticed there's a dot here that says 
spicy now if you're new to my channel i'm not good  
at spicy so this might be funny but we're gonna 
try this one next so this one just looks like  
to me that there's a bun oh yeah there's a 
meat patty bacon cheese and the yum sauce
oh yeah oh yeah that one is so much better than 
the plain yum it's like american style bacon which  
i do have to point out because at home we don't 
have bacon like this bacon from america it's like  
really crispy like so crispy it's like fried 
almost i'm gonna taste any spice okay chips or  
fries whatever you want to call them we call them 
chips in australia now this is the great debate do  
we like mcdonald's chips kfc chips burger king 
chips jolly bee chips let's find out oh they're  
good they're actually good i honestly think 
they're almost like mcdonald's chips from home  
very very crunchy these would probably be on par 
with the burger king chips from the philippines i  
like these this one says katsu what is catsup i'm 
not expecting to like this because i don't like  
hot dogs i'm not a hot dog girl i don't like hot 
dogs i'll never choose to eat a hot dog michael  
likes hot dogs so we have to get everything on the 
menu so we got it i'm not expecting to be a fan of  
this one and that's not jollybee's fault that's 
my fault it's got like the one slither of sauce  
down the top and then the bun with the sausage and 
the cheese on either side of the slither of sauce  
i don't like it i think it's the texture 
of sausage meat i'm not a fan of whoa great  
a hot dog shouldn't be outstanding it's perfect 
let's go all right what have we got next  
i think we should do some chicken this 
is chicken joy oh this is chicken choy  
oh this is chicken joint this is like the 
the best thing to get from jollibee i think  
if you were telling me in the comments 
what your favorite thing from jollibee is  
like light light yellow rather than deep red gold 
if that makes sense the chicken's really juicy on  
the inside the skin like the outer thing wasn't 
as crispy as i would normally like it it kind  
of folded with my mouth rather than like bit into 
something crispy but the chicken on the inside is  
delicious rice in like a bag you like a couch hold 
on michael's just told me he loves the chicken big  
fan any common theme here is that i like all food 
he eats fried chicken all the time so we do have  
some like peach mango and ube cheese pies which 
i'm gonna try after so make sure you stick around  
for that we're also gonna get some floats there's 
like a float and like the sundaes we're gonna try  
them as well but we have one more thing to try in 
the meantime and that's this burger steak it looks  
like there's just the steak in like a like a pool 
of gravy with some mushroom on top and some rice
oh it's very mushy i feel like i should be eating 
a burger like because that's what you taste when  
you eat like a burger that meat right so i feel 
like it should be a burger but it's not it's  
just gravy my my brain is confused that it's not a 
burger that's it for the food and we did actually  
order everything that was on this jellybeans 
menu so let me know if there's anything that  
are on a different jellybeans menu or anything 
like that if we've missed anything let me know  
as well we got everything that we could from 
here now it's time for my favorite part the  
pies if you've seen my uh video here in manila 
when i went to salcedo market i asked you what  
boko is rico you know what i mean um they had 
different flavors there as well they had like  
buco and melon what's buco and you told me that 
it was like a young coconut so go watch that it's  
on the screen now after this one or in the link 
below it's a buco boca flavored pie a peach mango  
flavored pie and an ube cheese also in that that's 
sal ceto saturday market video uh we went and we  
had a ube ube pancake as well and i loved it cool 
oh good so i'm expecting to like the ube one let's  
have a look but this one's definitely the ube 
or ubi because it's got the purple i'm really  
expecting to like this one so i'm really excited 
oh yeah is there cheese in there as well yeah um
is good the cheese and like the sweetness 
of the ube ubi ube whatever it's so good  
this is the buco bufo young 
coconut let's try this one
oh no no for me this one isn't as runny the 
inside isn't as runny or like creamy and things  
and there's actually got like slivers 
like little bits of coconut in there  
i don't like the texture of them i think if 
there was no like thick chunks of coconut  
and it was just like sweet paste i think 
i'd like it a lot more because once i  
got that sweet paste at the end with none of the 
like chunks of coconut i really liked it okay so  
i'm expecting this peach mango to be up there 
with the ube this was the most suggested okay  
michael's just said this was the most suggested 
on his tic talk like my page like everything
that is that is so good that is so good the like 
sweetness of like the peach and the mango and  
like how it's like just like a like a like a 
sweetness sludge i don't know tell me in the  
comments what's your favorite flavor of the pie is 
it buco buco ube cheese or peach mango i think i'm  
a peach mango girl okay so when i went to get the 
ice cream i saw floats and i've never had a float  
before ever there was three flavors there was coke 
royal and saucy and i've never heard of like royal  
or sassy before ever sassy royal is fanta oh 
fantastic it's called royal here sassy michael  
just told me is root beer now i believe that's 
more of an american thing we don't have root  
beer in australia so i asked her i said what's 
your favorite of the three and she said sassy  
so we have sassy float so something that just 
blew my mind is that all of that food we got  
all like the drinks the floats everything was 734 
pesos filipino pesos which is like 18 australian  
dollars or 13 american usd like a merry 13 all of 
that for 13 let's try this float saucy float hmm
oh i don't like root beer not my favorite 
i probably would have preferred cocoa fanta  
but i will say that the ice cream is really 
good i have a really nice chocolate sundae here  
i actually got the mini one because i wanted 
to actually finish the whole thing so this  
is a small one only 40 pesos it's just ice cream 
and chocolate syrup this is a good way to finish  
it off that's for sure so that was really cool to 
be able to try something that so many of you have
