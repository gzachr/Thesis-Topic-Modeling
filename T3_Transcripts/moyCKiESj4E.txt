 Future Friday. The Freshest. Talk about the freaking Avengers of Singing. This is Sangman Gubat, Darryl Hong, Katrina Belardi and Gigi Delana. What in the hell is this going to be? Okay? This is sick. And I love the song. Yeah, this is grown up Christmas list. There's a cover. I can't remember much about this song or anything about this song. I don't think I know the original. It's not Jose Madi Channel or Michael Bubley. I don't know it. Yeah, Maria Keri, maybe Ann Wam. Oh, um. It was an analytics. I love how he's still doing this stuff. Me too. Big co-lips. One of the best aspects of the Filipino music industry. Definitely. Collaborative nature. Darryl Sam, Gigi Cat. Telling you support your ex. Oh, Gabi. Do you remember me? Thank you. I sat upon your knee. Huh? Seen your heart. You know what? This is so sad. What's sad, brother? Hello, Sam. Do your thing. No, but I like it. Sorry to force it, but that in here goes hard. Yeah, it looks pretty. It looks like a accessory. It does look pretty hard. My life long with... She's my grown up Christmas list. Not for myself, but for a world. In New... That's really gross, just perfect. Yes. My whole life's torn apart. That was whenever I started. Stop. No idea what his song is. I've never heard this before, but it's fine. I love it. This is my introduction to the song. And I don't think I could ever go back to the original and think, That's a great song. What a hero. This is a great song. It just adore the fact that this feels like a hot cup of cocoa. Kelly Clarkson. It is? That's why Kelly Clark... No, no. Amy Grant. I don't know. Amy Lee Grant. American singer, songwriter, and musician. She began in contemporary Christian music before crossing over to pop music. See? This mother... I've done it, man. I've always said this. 1980s and 1990s. She is also referred to as the Queen of Christian Pop. Okay. Amy Grant. I don't think I know much about her though. Me neither. First time. I like this version though. Yeah, yeah. Like I said, let me get it. This is more of a style. I don't know what the original sounds like, but I just like Darrel. Let me go back to my analogy. Go watch the original guys. Go stream their music guys. Do, do. Go Amy. Because without Amy, we wouldn't have this version. No, no. Sure, but I mean, go watch Darrel's version and the Sam's version and all these guys' version. Anyways, Mac to my analogy. I heard a couple co-cooks, but this is not a... This is not like a normal cup of hot chocolate. No, he's like... Yeah, I was just saying, what the hell? It calls a co-co. Like co-co. You know? What co-co? What the fuck are you talking about? You know what I mean? You're in Britain, woman. We call it hot chocolate. Give me a hot chocolate, sir. But imagine that he's like spiced. So like he has like... ...clothes. And then... And then like... ...stariness. And then like... You know... And cinnamon. And it feels like... It feels like spicy. And it's like full. And full rounded in its flavor. That's what this feels like. It's complex. And it's full. And it's comforting all at the same time. Damn, that hot chocolate must hit this spot, mate. He does. I haven't even heard of... What did you say, Storanosis? What was it? Storanosis. I don't even know what that is. Storanosis. Storanosis. It's gonna be funny. Oh, yes, the cake is ready. Oh, yeah. Ready as woman, mate. All right, well, she knows it. Oh, she fucked me. Yeah. Okay. I'll keep it. I'm not gonna cheat it. Yeah. It's changing me, believe it. The grandest fight to see. Damn. Something lovely wrapped. I love people just got it. Oh, huh. Some people are just got spavorites. What happened? She's... Oh, my God. The packages and bones. Can they... The package and bones. Can they ever heal a heart in you? Yeah, a nice living. A big round, okay? Oh, one light. It's two-bend up. That was what never stood. And time would heal hard. Oh, my God. I mean... Oh, my God. Oh, God. That's a lot. The players in the back, the sick. I don't know if he's Darryl or if he's Sam. They're all together. But you know, all together. We're all in this. Well, dude, what a freaking song. I love that one day. I love that one day. Oh, my God. And everyone would have a friend. And right would always win. And love would never end. Oh, my God. This is nasty. Bro, she could be like so fucking successful. If she just made a Christmas album and that shit hits in Christmas. Oh, yeah. But like, it has to be like... All in English. It has to be all in English. Maybe we have a couple of Tagalog songs. No, it has to be worldwide freaking bank. Yeah, bro. Just listen to her. Just listen to her. Just listen to her. Oh, just listen. Nice. Yeah, that is so sweet. She's got something in her wrist. It's definitely... Oh, no, no, no. It's just a piece of cake. She's got something in her wrist. It's definitely... Oh, no, no. No, no, no. I'm starting to pour. It's just a piece of cake. That was the never-same song. And I'm starting to hear your heart. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Bro, you've loved this guy. Ah, that's so stupid. Nice, like, simply. It is, yeah. What in the... Yeah? Oh! Oh, nice! Okay, production! No, I feel like I'm watching a fucking sitcom from the 90s, man. Yes. You know what I was gonna say? You know, you see Katrina, you see Dara, right? They've been doing this, like doing covers like that. For solo. In an environment like that. Like, prior to Dara, like, getting married, having a kid. That's true. And now he was probably a kid when they began. Katrina was a kid when she began, you know? Yeah. And then I was hit doing covers. And now they're like, they both have kids, you know? Unsolidated. They've been through life, man. They've been through life. You know, how wild is that? Like, crazy to think about life. I was just gonna say, I don't know why I get so priced. Because I knew what I was, like, I knew what I was coming in for. Like, look at him, he's a kid. I don't know if this is reason, but he looks young. I think that's a little, yeah. That's baby Dara, a Dara. A few years ago, yeah. For sure. Yeah. I'm going to be honest, he hasn't really aged, so it's kind of hard to tell. Yeah, no, I just, honestly, I just, I'm a little bit overwhelmed to that. It's just such a great, and you know what's great? The song is like five, four minutes long, four, thirty, I don't know. It's like a lengthy piece. It's like a big chunk of meat, you know what I mean? But this, it's, it's so well arranged in terms of like a vocal layers, how it was structured. The partnerships and the vocal textures and the vocal colors together, who bounces off with who. It was just so really well balanced. That it felt like a blink, like a blink of an eye, and that climax, I know, it was incredibly difficult to record. I'm pretty sure that took like forever to get right. I like their mastery, man. I like the mixing and the mastery. But that was just like so exquisite. Like the highest level of singing songwriting and composing with the perfect delivery and the right production. Ah, honey, always satisfying. They're always so hands-on with their projects and stuff like that. Yeah. Always go show them love, go subscribe to all the channels, go, obviously view the original. And that's my Christmas. That's my Christmas grown-up list. Yeah, that is literally my Christmas present. You don't need to give me anything else. Go watch these guys! Have started. Good bye.
