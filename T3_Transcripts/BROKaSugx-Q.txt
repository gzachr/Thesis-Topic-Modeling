okay in today's video we came to the city 
of dreams which i guess is like a shopping  
mall slash casino it was actually not 
too far in my last video if you saw  
okada it's not too far from there it's only a 
couple kilometers away and like i said they're  
trying to it seems like they're trying to 
build like this whole kind of las vegas type  
with casinos everywhere but here we have just 
came across this dreamworks park dream play  
looks like it's got all the disney favorites here 
so i'm gonna take you around this place real quick  
and let's check it out but i don't think i'm gonna 
gamble at this casino so stepped in here real  
quick i just saw this guy this guy's really really 
thirsty i thought i should say something about it
it looks like it's like this whole park here 
i'm not gonna pay to go in but it goes down
and it there over here it's pretty sweet  
it's got this guy behind me getting dumped on 
so this is kind of like a little mall area it  
seems like it's kind of like they got a little bit 
hot more high-end stuff here um so it definitely  
caters to the it's like any other casino they got 
the expensive shopping with the gambling areas  
it's all the same and of course of course you 
know who came and made it into the picture
starbucks baby they're everywhere and also too  
you know it's funny because back home it seemed 
like 7-elevens were going out of business  
but i think what happened is they just directed 
all their attention to the asian market  
because they're 7-elevens everywhere 
here there's actually one in here too
so come up on the little food court area and 
the music's blasting loud with some copyright  
music so i'm gonna do a little quick 
montage to show you the restaurants here
just behind that on the second 
floor there's the big casino area  
they probably don't want me filming this 
so i'm gonna show it real quick there's  
also two levels there's this 
and then the one right below it
this casino is massive too this one's 
two levels and this is pretty big but  
i don't think this is as big as the al 
qaeda so definitely worth checking out  
i'm gonna put my camera away though before 
security sees me tells me to stop filming
i just got super lucky super lucky  
4 000 80 u.s and i'm out of here made my 
video got a couple bucks and i'm out of here
there it was baby the city of dreams made my 
dreams come true today um it was cool that was  
a cool place it's basically just the casino i 
thought i went to this place thinking there was  
a lot more that's why i made a video about it 
and sorry this video was pretty short but yeah  
it was cool they had great drinks they had like 
fresh pineapple juice iced coffee beer at these  
little stations hot chocolate iced chocolate 
and milk tea which is one of my favorites so  
it was great it was pretty cool i'm gonna take 
that four thousand and i don't know i might  
put it into another video i'm not too sure yet 
but um anyways if you come to the philippines  
this place is definitely worth checking out it's 
a cool casino you know be prepared to lose your  
money i got lucky because the trick is when 
you win you got to walk away and that's hard  
thank you for watching this 
video and we'll see you next time
