 Oh, here, just left the vertical heading to BGC today, which I have heard is very, very nice, very modern as well. How many times you've been to BGC? I've been to BGC. So yeah, let's get it. We're going to get the train and I don't know if you're going to take 40 minutes, I think. So yeah, just on the way to the train, like, comment, subscribe as always. Let's go grace, let's do it. Yeah, okay, I don't know what you're doing. Let's go. Right, what we on the M was the M-R-T. It's actually so cold. It's pretty cold. I mean, you can't speak on the underground here. What's that about? It's actually quite peaceful. And it wasn't even that bad. It was the best way of transport I've had. I know how cool. Very good. Very intense. I'm actually walking down the middle of the road, basically. I just got big tackle. I think we definitely got up at the wrong station. It's tour guide of grace. It's not going well. Not going well. I'm going to pee, don't. This is never last in the UK. It's a little tiny bit of breeze and it's flipped upside down. Yeah, but it's sturdy. I mean, it's a sturdy, as a piece of bread. Where are we, Grace? Saloon! So jollybee. Goni. It's very王行. It's treasured. Saloon. I'm so happy to see you. Hi guys, welcome to the vlog. I'm deleting that. I was so off the two hours of being lost and walking around the circles. We're here. It's her phone. No. I don't know why I'm here. We are shopping. I'm confused. Are we on the supermarket? This is all cool. I'm so happy. This is all cool. I'll take everything. I'll bring it all back. Alright, just been to SM. Lots of malls. Yeah, it's nice. It's a lot nicer than Kaisel City. I think a lot more room. A lot more shops are definitely different. Like more more push-as-shops aren't they? There. So I've asked that a bit of a difference. How are you taking me? Walking down the side of the road again. This is not the experience I asked for. Give us the Christmas light tour. Oh, very nice. Grace. Are we in Italy? Yeah. We actually got into Italia. Ballissimo. Ballissimo. Oh my god. Oh my god. Alright, come on. Best TikTok dance. You both get 20 each, yeah? You got to do a TikTok dance, yeah? Oh yeah, oh yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's good. Ah, yeah. Yay. Yay. Wait now. Yeah. Hush Tiger content. So we've been to Venice and now we're back in the Philippines. Like we've been five minutes. Oh, that must be it. Yeah, anything more to add? Anything more to add? Huh. Subscribe. Subscribe there. So the difference between the shopping centers here and the UK, they're tidy. The UK is so grotty. Grotty, meaning like, grimy, dirty. Here, I feel like I could have a bath on this floor. Look at the floor, man. Show the floor in the eye. Oh, floor review. Turn out up 10. Mm-hmm. Ballissimo. Yeah. Right now. All right. Yeah. All right. All right. Yeah. No. Yeah. Yeah. See you later. Okay. Bye. Bye. Bye. See you later. Bye.
