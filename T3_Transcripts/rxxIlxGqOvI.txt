 But you're Friday. The freshest. My little one, why? I feel like I'm swearing in Spanish. This is a really bad word in Spanish. It's like being damned. It's a cursing, but not really cursing. No, but it has more of a game. It's not so much of the word per se, but the meaning behind it is like you're cursed. It's like your God has forsaken you. No, like a witch has put the spell on you. Like you're going to die, your curse. You will never fall in love, your curse. But back home, it's really like... Slowed. Yes, slowed word. Yes, so I feel like it's just the name of the artist. I think so. And the song is called Puertoquera. Which means why? Why? In Spanish. Now apparently this is in Chihuacano. Yes, in Spanish. Which is like a different version of Spanish, or maybe more Spanish than Spanish, or like an original version of Spanish. This is like old Spanish. Old Spanish. But it has also a lot of like the Filipino roots of the language itself. No, no, no, the dialect of the island where this is from. So because, yes, it's not the actual Filipino language. It's just specific to specific areas. Yes, it's in a specific area that speaks this dialect. Sort of for the long-winded intro, but... Yeah, sorry about that. For the context might be important. Yeah, okay. Holding hands with fence. Oh, ultimate sign of fence. She's pretty. I like that. A smoky eye look. She's not old school, it feels like. It does. So like Camila is going to come out and sing to me. Absolutely. I feel that, who who knows<|id|> I love that. That's really cool. I like that. That is so freaky. That's really cool. That's really cool. That's really cool. That's really cool. I love that. I love that. That's really cool. I love that. That's so catchy. That's really acoustic. Such an ice song though. Listen to this part. That's the freer. That's the freer but it's like he's gonna suffer. That is so freaky. That's the freer. I love that. Remember that it's not actual Spanish. It's not actual. It's not actual. It's not actual. It's not actual. It's not actual. It's not actual. It's not actual. It's not actual. It's not actual. It's not actual. It's not actual. It's not actual.
