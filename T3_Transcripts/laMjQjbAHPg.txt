I'm cheap off for getting it. She's like my favorite girl. This is a little expensive. So, cap, cap, everything. What's your name? Sure, less. I mean sleeveless. I'm a little bit of a star. Yeah, this is actually something. I'm so much. I like her outfits. I like her style. I think I'm going to have to go back to the band. Daniel is a lucky man. And real one. So, is he being a star in the, I think he's being a star? I think he's a new project. Come on, I want this project. Maybe you can be my project. Oh, what? This is the one. Oh, two four. We're not going to go in. Oh, of course. Oh, of course. And cap. And cap. It's very short. The union is not made yet. What on special things? Where on a homeless lady could come? Mad and baby. Oh, wow. He doesn't have the charisma though. He doesn't have the charisma. He can act. He can act. He can act. He just has the camera. Oh, I care about his cap. I think he's a good singer. What was the cap? The singer is a singer. Yeah, sounds like there's a girl singing. So they seem to be probably singing together in the end. I can see them singing together in the end. The entire time I was watching this movie, I was just focusing on that. I'm not going to sing that. I'm going to sing it. I'm going to sing it. I'm going to sing it. I'm going to sing it. Oh, wow. Okay, it's so good. I don't know if it's just me, but it's like it's forced kind of. Are they still dating? What's happening? He has a nice face. And she's pretty. She's really pretty. I like her. Like she's pretty. Oh, did Carrie watch this one? I think she tweeted. I think we watched this one. 25 is a long set of us. Is that not one?

Because I always hear his name, but I... Well, he's not a James Green. I do not care about the guy, man. Just Catherine. Catherine. What's in Catherine? Catherine. He's nice, though. Like he has that very relatable, like, that guy next door feeling. Yeah, I can see that. I think that's why he's very popular. She has that girl next door. Really? No, I'm just saying that. I don't know. I think I need to see them more to see them. Yeah, there you are. I was going to see them see them. I don't know, like, they didn't... Are they dating in my life? No, that's one of those things nobody knows yet. No. I was talking to you, you said they were, but it's been like what? What? From when you told me that, so... Okay. I don't know when they see the chemistry in this movie, though. I don't know. I would give this one a chance. I don't know. Just because I... I probably watched it because of the... Like, he's a star and she's like this random girl. But then... Yeah. Because, like, at the end, it's like they're in an... And then after a couple of days... This... She just shares to it every day.
