Oh, hey, we never watch Filipino videos. Yeah, me neither. Hello, everyone. My name is Yuna. And I'm from Egypt and I've never heard a Filipino song before. Hello, my name is Yato. I'm Palestinian. And I've never heard a Filipino song before. Hi, I'm Grace. I'm half-Lubinese half-Falipino. Hi, I'm Susie. I'm half-Falipino half-Falipino. Together we are. It's harder. But it's cute that they ask the fans to send them stuff. Yeah. Oh my god, this is the one you showed me. I think so. I don't think so. Everyone has got three own now. We didn't watch the video though. No, it's a story. Claudia. I noticed like nowadays all of the music videos, even if it's like English, Filipino. Yeah. Especially like people, his age. Is that like, is he like reacting to TikToks? I think they just, I think they're just on the side. I'm so glad it's in English. I'm super pretty. It's sweet and lyrics. Yeah, pretty soothing for it. But that's so cute. They're so pretty too. Yeah. I think these are snapchat videos of normal ordinary people. No, maybe the fans. Yeah, probably. They're so pretty all of them. I love them. The aesthetic of the video though. Do you like it? Yeah. You know, it comes apart that we do not understand. I want the one who's singing it. It's interesting though. I think he's in love. He's probably singing about somebody that he loves. What about the girl? I think it's just a love song. I feel like he's just repeating like what he said in English. But I don't, Like I can't follow anymore. I just got lost. I like how we incorporated the fans though. Oh no, I love that. That's pretty much. Yeah, I agree. So distracted by the girl. They're so pretty. Did you see the color of her hair? I love the pink one. I love her hair. It's beautiful. Exactly. They're all beautiful. They're all very different from each other. It's a very catchy song. I really like it. I think it's one of those songs that just keeps repeating. It is color one. Is that Manila? I've never been to Manila. He reminds me a little bit of like Arabic music. When he just, yeah, like when Arabs, they start singing. And then they just repeat the same verse over and over again. And you're just like, is this gonna be the end of the song? Because I can just stop. Just let me know. But the thing is, even in the middle there isn't like that climax. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just the same tone. Yeah. What's Gatriona? Wow, Edsa? It's a bad-ass. I don't know. Do you think that's her name? The person she's singing? Maybe. Oh, she's so pretty. I don't know with that. She's one of the universe. Oh, really? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm so sorry. She's so pretty. That's Gatriona. Oh, that's Gatriona. Oh, she must be so flattered. This is an amazing song about her. And the song about her. That's one of the universe. Another Miss Philippines won the UNMESI. How does that make you feel? Okay, next. I love the part where he's going. And I can see her winning the Miss Universe. And if Heaven does exist, it will most probably look like her. So nice. And I love how we kind of reassure themselves with the YELL or the YES there. Yeah. I just feel like it's sweet. But now that I'm reading it, I'm like, there's nothing about her personality. It's all looks. I mean, it is a music video. Keep in mind he's like kind of mentioning the Miss Universe. Miss Universe is also. It's more than just like looks. Like they talk about her personality. After they chose your looks. No, I don't know. I don't know how it's like. But I feel like it's after they chose your looks. Oh, there we go. Okay, when you laugh, it already makes me mouth. That's okay, that's sweet. Just like ice cream. That's fine. I love this line. Winner lose. You're still my queen. I think that's beautiful. See the funny thing is, I can see her winning the Miss Universe. And she actually did win Miss Universe. Did she? Yeah. Didn't you say that she won Miss Universe? I can't read it and not have that voice in my head. Yes sir. Ya yad. Ya yad. But Katriyona in this sense is not Katriyona Miss Universe. Filipina woman. You know what I'm saying? Yes. So you can see any beautiful Filipina woman winning Miss Universe. Ya. You know? Even if it's not actually Miss Universe, you know what I mean. Ya ya. What's it called the metaphor? Mm-hmm. Yeah. This is the new key. Is it? I don't know. Is it them? It sounds like a show. Same game show. I know that. The background music. Eating. I haven't seen this yet. A car. Teaching the guys how to... Oh, it is a game show. Oh, okay. I thought I misunderstood it at the first. I think this is the new one. Wow, those lines. Look at the spedic colors. That's interesting. Suspense, I like it. I'm getting Korean vibes. Major Korean vibes. I'm getting high school musical vibes. That's real. It's faster. I like it. I like their style. The badgy style kind of thing. I like this one more than the previous one. This is a girl. It reminds me a lot of K-pop. I mean, I mean, yeah. I'm getting a lot of K-pop vibes from this. Ya, I mean, too. I was just saying that. Like those K-pop boy bands that people talk about all the time. Yeah. I'm going to show them. I haven't caught any English words yet. But it's right there. Oh, right. I'm so sorry. Can you imagine working out to this song? Yeah. It's fast. Oh, yeah. I wouldn't bet. It makes you want to move. I know they're so good. No, they're always in sync. Yeah. Like that's really good. That's good. I like it. I don't get it. But I like it. I don't know how this works. They all look so cool. That's it. But the bands ones are interesting. Yeah. I feel like to be honest, the Philippines can compete with like, like, eat up to it. Yeah. But they don't have to copy the entirety of it. I like this guy's background the most because he has all these papers that he's torn out. I mean, it looks good though. It looks good. It's not saying anything. But it does remind me of K-pop. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's a great song. I'm loving it so far. I like that note. They're really good. And they're really good. Yeah, they're really talented. It's from the top. It seems like that kind of song. I know Mahal Kita means I love you. Okay. I can't just tell you who my favorite one is. I'm trying to. Mine is the purple-haired guy. I like his outfit. I like all the outfits. Other way, his lines. Honestly, though, to be honest, this has been my analysis of the pinkers in general. Can the pinkers do what K-pop artists do? But, like, for fun all the time. They put in-trams, but ending though. That was really cool. That was cool. I really like this one. I like his outfit. I like this guy. I kind of thought I'm this guy attractive. The one with the purple? Yeah. Burning like fire. Many are asking you out because you are so fire. I like that. That's stuff they're so genuine in this, in their music video. I think this one suits you. Honestly, it comes. When it comes to readers, they're all very touching music. So far, they've been so sweet and warm. You know, like, they're not like today's music. Where they just talk about a lot of stuff that kids can't go in. Oh, that's what it means. Burning like fire. I loved how they've done the music video. With the five- was it five different colors? Yeah. You know, displaying like five different types of... This is the last one. I love his fire. I love his burning like fire. Fire? No, not for this video. Once you start loving someone, you can't. It just keeps on loving. Even if you try to stop it, you can't. I mean, yes, you can throw water and then it's going to stop. But like, where can you find water for your feelings? You know? His love is like fire and then the girls like gasoline. And then he once like every time she comes near, it's like pouring gasoline on the fire. It's just more intense. It just intensifies. Right. The group itself reminds me of K-pop. Yeah. I mean, maybe that's what they're going for. They were trained by a Korean company. Oh, right? Yeah. In Korea? Oh. I know this and I love it so much. I don't know if you do, but... Also, different from the one you love. I love the beginning of every video. I love this song when it came out. I know. It's so different from the usual. She looks badass. She looks pretty. I like what she's wearing. It's interesting. I like her. Is she wearing like Filipino tripe? Yeah, I think so. Look at the highlighter on her. Please focus on the perfect colors that I make up. I feel like sometimes we forget the main focus of what we're supposed to be watching. And we just focus on what they're wearing. I think that she's singing about like being more... She's fierce. Yeah. There's a lot of fierceness in this video. It's your minding me if something but I can't place my finger on it. I can't believe it came out with 2017. It's three years ago. It's brand new for me. Feels empowering for some reason. Yeah, but she's challenging. Yeah, okay. You know, I'm just thinking that, you know, we think right now that the song is about something. But later on we find out the song could be about something completely different. But I love the dance moves. Yeah, oh yeah. Yeah. I can't even walk like they do. I probably can't dance like they do either. The dance is pretty. Even like the skirt. It's part by the tribes. Represent. Is she saying my love? What I hear is I look. I look. I feel like there's a cultural aspect to it but I'm not sure because I'm not familiar with it. But isn't that with the way they addressed and the location kind of thing? You know, the freedom of this song reminds me of. Shukir. Let's it. Of the lads in your seat. She has her body like tattooed. Actually, that is Filipino culture. She looks so pretty. Yes, come through Marana's story. Yes. No, I'm showing you how to move my hips like that. Right? So nice. No, for real, doesn't her move remind you of Shukir? A little bit. Come on. Shukir, I'm so curious. What the span of me? Sky? Sky? Stars. Is it a bit lean? Is that the moon? She's definitely trying to prove a point. She's like, look at me. Yeah, look at me. Yes. I know, I know. I don't know. I just hit now, yeah. If I sounded like her, I wouldn't shut the famous, you know, just mixing everything. You can feel the pain, like the feelings. I don't sense pain. No pain, but like the feelings when she sings this part. I mean, her voice. I mean, I like her voice very much. I'm really intrigued. I want to know what they're hearing. I just want to understand. Yeah, I want to understand too what they're talking about. The first time that I see her, I never saw her before. I mean, this is the first time I've ventured into this type of music at all. I feel like, again, it's stretching. They're repeating the song again. I don't understand those, so I can't really say that. But like, it sounds. But it sounds like that's what they're doing. I mean, is the song about revenge? I feel like she's trying to prove a point. It is inspired by like, for the ball and for the triumph. And I love that so much. I represent the Philippines. Yeah, all parts of the Philippines are wrong. Can you imagine dancing to this at a cloud? Yeah. Yeah. I love this song. It's so fun. But it's nice. I think this is my second favorite after the one before this. It's like this video is a strong message to someone in particular. Oh, this part of your eyes. That's awesome. That's a story. She was like, seems like a floating in heaven, but drowning in your smile. That's so accurate. I'm gonna tear up a little bit. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. I'm trying. Oh my god. Oh my god. She did. Oh, screw her. I love you. Are you trying to make it worse? I'm trying to make it better. You have my love. No, you know what I cried. Oh my god. I'm gonna cry again. No, I saw it again. And if we're meant only up to now, I will treasure our fast together. And if we're, we do reach the end just hold on to our two. Reach the stars. Yeah. I didn't just think about love. That's the problem. I didn't think about love. I thought about deeper than that. I thought about family. So that's why I cried the head. Yeah. My brain goes really weird places sometimes. Oh, I really want to know what the song goes. Star. Oh, you were right. She is talking about love. Seems like I'm floating in heaven. Oh, I was very very calm. The music video was like feeling. I was saying I can see in your eyes. When we were watching the music video, I thought it was about something completely different. I wanted to actually, it's about. I thought it was like a little bit empowering or something. Misleading music video. Misleading. I thought the song would be about independence or something. Yeah, I thought this was like, look at the powerful. I'm strong again. Yeah, that's what I thought. It's like being born again or building yourself up. Shining, shaking down or something. I was so hoping that it would be like, you know, the whole music video is like a giant middle finger. Something to go ever broke her heart. Yeah, kind of. Okay, but that's fine. I mean, the lyrics are like sweet. It's about, you know, she's talking about someone she loves. And how she sees stars in their eyes. I love these serenisms. I can see it in your eyes. This part loves this star. It's like very romantic. You know what I realized? As half reading the lyrics in English from Tagalog. Doesn't do it justice. Yeah, it's so good. Tagalog. And then reading it in English is like, it's still nice, but it's not the same. It's just different. The meaning of the song is different when you read it, when you listen to it in the original language. Right. Because it's so beautiful in the dialogue. And like, I'm just reading the lyrics without disconnecting it from the actual song itself. I like it. And I love how it's a love song, but it's not like your typical. Like the beat. It's like the whole thing. I have a crush and I'm just a cool. It can be about anyone you love. It doesn't have to necessarily be a guy or a girl who will remember it. It's not true love. It's 2020, you know. True. I did not expect to cry about the last lyric. I don't know why, but I kind of miss. I think I missed this kind of music. It's just something that hits you hard without having to listen to swear words and curse words in the middle. It's very clean. And it's kind of, it's clean and it's sweet and it's just such as you. And then there was that part that made me cry. And this is never going to be over. This is just going to go on and on and on. I didn't expect to like them that much. I think it has a bit of everything. Because when you tell me for example, for a piano music, I'm thinking of like the way they do things. For example, I feel like I can't generalize it. Because like with what we saw, we saw like a bit of everything. Like really, you know, for example, with Arabic music. I think it's pretty much the same thing. Yeah, it's repetitive. But you're like, it's the same culture. So you don't really get to change much about it. And if you do, people are going to diss you really bad. It's like a market of music. So if you enter something new in a market, you can't, I'm a business student. So I just have to prove that. But if you do let anything in a new market, people might reject it. And it's like, it's just going to fall apart. I feel like it's a nice mix. Like you saw a bit of everything. But here it's like, they're already a different version of everything. You know, they have a variety of things. I don't think I've had any expectations before I watched it. Yeah, no. I don't know. It was good. It's so second to my mind that I can saw it. I wasn't exactly expecting anything. Because I came to this with like an open mind. So I think I'm pleasantly surprised. It's much catchier than I actually thought it would be. I can see myself growing to some of these. I think that I was expecting this because they're very passionate with they sing. Like they're very good singers. So like the quality of their voices and the ones of effort that went to the performances. Yeah, they put some mad effort into some of those. Yeah. Those those sets are amazing. The way elaborate. Especially the second one with the different colors and the thought that went into making, you know, like the production itself. I enjoyed myself. I had a good time. Yeah. Like in my case, especially Tala, like the way she sings the song is like you can feel the feelings. And the choreography. Yeah. Like we have to talk about that choreography. That was some amazing work. We have to bring up Miss Universe. She's beautiful. She's dream-fished. She deserves the car. Of course she's beautiful. She's Miss Universe. Yeah, but mine was like, okay. They're various looking artists. Yeah. Like some of them are very western. They're just like embracing being Filipino. But even if it's like more western, like it's like the first video we saw, there's still like a partner. Very Filipino to say the lyrics of the song were like embracing like an empowering woman. So when I watched the second video, it reminded me of like a K-pop music video. Right, right. Yeah. But I guess like with a Filipino twist. Yeah. I think that's like the little thing I wanted to see a bit more of. But like it was really good. It was good. And then Tala, I mean, Sara is our star. I know. I love it. The background, I think, because it's been better. But you don't even look at the background. You're just focused on her. And I love the incorporation of like the Filipino culture and what she was wearing. And what the back-out dancers were wearing as well. So you can just see, like there's the various genres. Various, very Filipino music. OPM's from before, to now. Yeah. Because when I hear people say, OPM, I'm like, okay. But, you know, I'm like, I'm like, okay. Yeah. And then now it's like OPM. That is fast. Yeah. It's so fast. Everyone finds their own music. That's true. Like you're than OPM. Because I mean, everyone has different tastes than music. So you're going to find something you really like to each their own. Yeah.
