 Hi guys, right today I'm going to react to this video called Monagon Zales anime song compilation part one. So apparently she's up to the Pinai YouTuber making Japanese anime song mostly. So in this video she's singing one of popular Japanese anime songs. So yeah, which anime song is she gonna sing? Let's see. Oh! You, you have a song. I'm a little bit bored. I'm a little bored. I'm a little bored. So good. Yeah, I think she's good. Yeah, perfect Japanese as well. Yeah, sounds really natural. Well, I want you to focus on driving though. Ah! No, opposite steering wheel, right? So yeah, someone else is driving. Hey, thank you very much. Ah, a bit wrong pitch. I love you. Nice. That is the right way. Yeah, but she's very good. Walden. So you're like singing in the car, don't you? Oh, sorry, I don't know this song. But nice. You can avoid it. Very good to be rattle. Oh, nice. Who is that? Is she her father? Oh, this is Shroom Dunn. Yeah, I like it, actually. It's really popular anime, for my generation. Very good. And what's great is her rhythm. Yeah, I believe she's the one in rhythm, but she's beating in very good tempo. This is the performance of Latino, right? Yeah, very impressive. Very good, very good. Oh, Naruto. This is kind of new song. Yeah, go. So she's not looking at the mix, so she memorized there, right? Yeah, very good. I wonder she speaks Japanese. Oh, not in the car this song. Hunter, Hunter. Very good, anime. Very husky voice. I like that voice. Well, she has a bit accent, but still good. Yeah. Shishin, shishin, but shishin. Okay, I just realized one thing that is non-native Japanese speaker usually have difficulty in sound of S. We say like sashisu-sou. Yeah, and they say usually like sashisu-sou. And actually she does as well. Yeah, we have we say sashisu-sou. Yeah, you might think it's really difficult, but you know, sounds really non-Japanese speaker for us. Oh, this is... This is... I, if I remember correctly... Well, I didn't really watch this anime, so yeah, but really popular song in Japan. Oh, that's not good. Well, never get bored of driving with her, right? Very good vibrato and runs. This song is really difficult to sing, but you know, she covers it completely, singing it like very easily. Yeah, she's very talented. Wow. I don't know this song. Sorry, I don't know this song. This part must be difficult for non-native Japanese speakers, but she sings properly. Very good. I know this is a Yui. Yui is a singer of this song. Yeah, how is sounds like just like Yui, the voice of Yui. Very good. What's this song? I don't know this song. Sorry. I'm so impressed with her beating. It's really rhythmical. Oh, that's it. You can't talk about the anime without this song, right? Dragon Ball. Wow, how long tone voice is also really good. I like it. Oh, that's it. Wow, I like her husky voice. It's really good. Oh, that's it. It's fucking. Well, he looks a bit tired. He must have been hearing her singing for a long time. Wow, she sings everything. Drive him. Wow, this sounds really like Japanese Enka. This is just my opinion, but she must be good at singing Japanese Enka. Well, Enka is Japanese traditional ballet. Since she's got a very beautiful vibrato and run, very good for Japanese Enka. Sounds just like Japanese Enka singer. So singing, drama sounds like Japanese Enka singer is singing drama. So yeah, well, I want to listen to her singing Enka. Yes. I want to listen to her singing. Yes. I want to listen to her singing. I want to listen to her singing. Wow, she's so good. Don't know this song. Oh, very cool song. Oh, very cool song. Oh, very cool song. Well, I guess she has her various tone voices. Yeah, very impressive. Well, I guess she's going to destroy that door over the kind in the end. Because, you know, she's beating the same area all the time. Oh, she's a high tone voice. Oh, Kimetsu Leiva. This song is called by Stool. Go really popular. Oh, Kimetsu Leiva. Oh, that was a really good time. Oh, that was a really good time. Oh, Kimetsu Leiva. Oh, Kimetsu Leiva. Oh, Kimetsu Leiva. Oh, Kimetsu Leiva. Oh, Kimetsu Leiva. I think I will be very surprised to see her singing very seriously. If I were people around her, oh, yeah, that was good. Her voice sounds like original voice. Although she had a bit accent, but she was very good. Like her voice, very good. Obviously, and she memorized all Japanese lyrics. She's like a very passionate and joy. Yeah, really good. Well done. So, yeah, that was my reaction to her video. I hope you like it. If you do, make sure to like, button and subscribe. So, bye for now. Bye.
