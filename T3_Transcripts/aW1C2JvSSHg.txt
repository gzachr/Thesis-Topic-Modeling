i've never seen anything like this before
good morning guys welcome back to bow hall we 
have just picked up our bike for rent for the  
next two days we've got a brand new little 
honda click the nicest bike we've had so far  
yeah there's a few scratches on it i don't know 
what someone's done to it before we add it but  
it's pretty much brand new yeah we're gonna 
jump on we're gonna head to the main island  
and we're gonna check out as much as we can in 
one day but first of all we need to get petrol
one is made it to the first stop of the 
day bohol is a lot bigger than i thought  
it actually took like a two-hour drive for like 
an hour and 45 minute drive together yeah it was  
very long so the first stop we've come to is the 
chocolate hills and it's probably the number one  
thing to do in bohol but we've just got some 
steps to climb up now we're heading up here i  
know we can show you the view we've had some sneak 
peeks along the way and it literally looks amazing  
yeah the drive here was literally through a 
load of the chocolate hills and stuff apparently  
there's 1200 of them it's crazy but yeah we're 
headed up now we're going to check out the video  
this is insane i've never seen anything like this 
before it looks like something like a fairy tale  
it's kind of like fairy glen in scotland it 
is but but way bigger bigger hills bigger area  
everything it's crazy it's literally like 
a 360 all the way around look at that
nuts this is a hundred percent wetting caballers 
it definitely isn't as busy as i thought it would  
be either no it's not quiet i thought it'd be a 
lot busier there's a few people here but not it's  
not like that busy not considering it's like the 
top thing to do yeah and it's not that early it's  
no it's about midday 11 12 yeah so peak time 
really well this is sick this is really cool  
it almost doesn't look really looks like something 
after the film doesn't it yeah this is natural as  
well it's not man-made it's just there there was 
a sign done some steps somewhere we'll have a look  
around and give you some facts because i'm quite 
intrigued to know a bit more about it as well  
like what are they made of dubs chocolate 
chocolate hills there's actually an atv  
course that like goes through the the chocolate 
hills and i don't know if you can see but there's  
some people down there just having some 
sort of like safety brief or something  
all on atvs that looks like so much fun and 
there's a nice breeze up here as well i know it's  
lovely they've actually got a bell right here as 
well so i'm definitely going to give this a ring
i mean that's what's there for us i guess so 
you're not allowed to use this so the various  
class up here i highly highly highly recommend 
okay so just with the information board now so a  
couple of quick facts uh two million years ago the 
island of bohol is actually underwater completely  
yeah so it's all coral basically and over time the 
land rose and then the rain water actually eroded  
the coral into these formations that are the hills 
yeah and over time again the grass has grown and  
the trees have grown on the hills and the reason 
they call chocolate hills is because in the dry  
season they're actually brown is actually dry 
season out but not too much rain yes so they're  
nice and green they look lovely though it's 
honestly like it just doesn't look real it is  
like it is like a fairy tale like you said yeah 
and 100 reminds me of fairy glen in scotland but
a hundred times bigger yeah it's like a mixture 
of something of a fairy tale and avatar yeah  
right we've slammed it all day watching 
this video but we can't so we need to  
move on to our next stop so we can take 
a couple of pictures and head head out
okay we pulled up to the side 
of the road because there  
is a waterfall so we're going 
to run down and check it out
it's not much of a waterfall it's called 
busay waterfalls it's not actually  
all that much to be honest but still pretty 
cool not bad for something we didn't tend to see  
but as we pulled up all these kids 
just came running from like the little  
houses uh nearby right to the next 
stop yeah they're all like falling out
our next alcohol to come to the supertan twin 
hanging bridge and we've turned up and sadly  
it has literally been destroyed i'm 
gonna presume by the titan that they  
in had but there was literally nothing left 
that is so sad it was from looking online  
as well the bridge was like pretty strong 
yeah it was a bamboo bridge i think yeah  
they never said anything online either so 
we didn't even expect this no that's right
all right should we just go ahead to the next 
offer yeah i guess those half heads and stuff  
okay so we've made it to our last stop of the day 
which is the tarzia sanctuary now i am so excited  
about this i love you we don't really know that 
much about them but i think that's more exciting  
so we're gonna head in i've heard that we've 
gotta talk a bit quiet so bear with us when it  
comes to that and hopefully we'll see some tarzias 
so for those of you that don't know atari is the  
world's smallest primate it's like a really really 
really small monkey but it's not a monkey it's not  
a monkey it's not a monkey it's just the world's 
smallest primate hopefully we'll learn some more  
about them and we'll be able to give you some 
more info attazia is a primate but not a monkey  
tarzans can jump three meters from tree to tree
so we have to be really 
quiet because they're resting
oh my
more than 10 years 10 years old
that's crazy it's like the size of my hand  
how small how small are the babies just like this 
like a thumb the baby is the same size as a thumb
they're sleeping how long do they sleep for a 
day for the whole day they sleep all day when  
do they eat during night time awesome sleep 
all day and then they're awake in the night
and sex they eat insects
it tells you okay is the tasty 
monkey no tarzan is not a monkey  
what does it mean that the tarzia is an endangered 
species religious species has at least 20 chance  
of completely vanishing from the world in the next 
20 years oh my gosh so that might be like the last  
time we've ever seen one yeah well that's the 
first time last time we were there to see one wow  
i've never seen an endangered 
species let alone that close oh
eat insects like lizards it takes primarily 
and then sometimes lizards are smaller well  
it's probably smaller than a lizard and 
a bit what are the threats to the tattoos
can actually be found in malaysia indonesia and 
there's a few other islands in the philippines  
where they can be found but this is the only 
place where there's a sanctuary so pretty much  
this is the only place you can come and see them i 
think there's one other place on this island yeah  
but this is the only island you can come and see 
them everywhere else they they live in the wild so  
probably a really low chance if you find finding 
one in the wild especially because they're that  
small yeah like if we didn't have a guy to show us 
where they were i would have been walking around  
there for hours wouldn't be able to find them 
no i wouldn't have a chance that's definitely my  
favorite part of the day i really like chocolate 
hills but yeah i think that's got to take it just  
because it's something that you literally cannot 
see i know the chocolate is you can't really see  
anywhere else but you can't see the animal 
anywhere like anywhere wow that was so cool  
i was looking forward to it anyway but like i feel 
like it exceeded my expectations i didn't expect  
them to be that small i hope the clips we took 
there were you could hear because we have to be  
very quiet obviously to stop like not interrupt 
their rest and we couldn't spend too much time  
with each one because they say you should only 
spend like 30 seconds without like an animal  
in the wild because that's basically what it is 
it's called they've got such a big area back there  
yeah it is basically in the wild doesn't it um 
because it just like disrupts them and they're  
routine and stuff so yeah super cool definitely 
check it out if you're ever on bohol island 100  
that was awesome but for now i think we've got 
about a half hour ride back to lona beach yeah  
i was thinking of catching the sunset but this is 
the current cloud situation it's not looking good  
so i think we're just gonna head back maybe grab 
some food from somewhere yeah sounds like a good  
idea to me what a long day of driving we didn't 
realize how big the hall was yeah i don't even  
think we've got like we've filmed that much i 
think it's literally just been driving from one  
place it's absolutely massive considering like 
it's an island i wonder how big it actually is  
because we drove almost two hours just to get to 
the chocolate hills and then it was half hour to  
the other spot that we were the hanging bridge 
that we didn't get see yeah and then another  
half hour to get here and then probably like an 
hour or a bit more to get back yeah definitely  
been worth it though have a lovely day i really 
enjoyed yeah i definitely recommend coming here  
and chocolate hills was awesome as well yeah 100 
we don't know what we're doing tomorrow yet so we  
will find out yeah but i think we're going to end 
it here yeah if you're new around here please hit  
subscribe give us a thumbs up if you enjoyed 
the tasia let us know in the comments what you  
prefer the chocolate hills or the tarzias 
and we will see you again in the next one
