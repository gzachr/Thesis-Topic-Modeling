 Things that shock Americans about the Philippines. The first thing I noticed was that everybody around the city was using umbrellas. When I asked why I was simply told... Hey, I'm a cop! Okay, that makes sense. The next thing I noticed was that I saw a lot of monuments of this guy, La Poo La Poo. One of the most famous warriors to fight against the Spanish when they first came to the Philippines. I tried to do his pose, but... I suck. Yo, another cool thing I noticed was the peso water machines, where you can fill up a bag of cold drinking water for one peso. So if you're in the Philippines and you have at least one peso, you don't have to be thirsty. They sell pancakes for snacks on the streets. Yo, I had to try one. And the verdict... Delicious.
