 Future Friday. The freshest. We've been kinda into dance lately. We do go through those waves where I'm like, oh, let's check out some dance again. It's just a new dance crew from the Philippines that we have never heard about. Well, new to us, not new to this. Yeah, I think actually we've been doing it for a while. They call this square crew vibe Philippines 2 or something like that. And it's a second place, but people are saying like this is a geog performance. Oh, it's team performances. Okay, okay, gotcha, gotcha. My god. My sereneity dance step. Now who are you? Woodo. Who talks? Is that the name of the group? Damn, who are any members? Woo! That was! Wow, I look so pretty with the face. Wow, I look so pretty with the face. Let's go, send them. Ooh, nice, though, that's freaking sick. Nice, this is so good. So many visual light illusions. I also love the camera's like down low. Down low. Yeah. I love that one. Ah, break up. I adore the freaking layered work here. Right, this is so good. They're so good, because the vision effect is so treat-dimensional. Oh, I like that move. When did this happen? It's 1000. It's five years ago. Yeah, it has a strong 2018 vibe. It's cool, it's cool that I think groups is not just acrobatics. Yeah, it's pure dance. Well, it depends on the crew that you're watching. A lot of them are like acro- I just feel like a lot of the stuff that... It becomes very viral. Because all the acrobatics was, which is cool, obviously it's dope as hell. But it's not like just these straight dance. Yeah, well, I think back in 2013, I remember that I loved the group dance crew's performances that were done in big competitions like this. A lot of them had a good mixture of styles, so they had break dancers and acrobatics and people doing all... A lot of locking. Yeah, and usually the crews have roots in popping and locking, which is the core of urban dance style. But then again, I'm not very well versed in these styles as you can tell. But a little bit of knowledge in that is usually that's the base. Everybody should know some basics of that. Popping and locking. Popping and locking, yeah. And then that's why freaking the royal family. Royal family, that's right. The royal family became so popular because they stepped out of that popping and locking base and became very commercial dance forward. So they mixed a lot of like whacking and... The royal family, only women. Originally, what I think? Oh, touching. I love the song choices that are freaking great. Oh! Damn! See, you have a lot of like... Popping and locking base, stuff here. Popping! This is so weird, the music. It's fabulous, though. You really sing so many things here. Oh, okay, exciting. Oh, but Ganger. Come on, Scott. Korea. Ooh, though, but there are sharp. Middlemen was everything. See, this is like more whacking style, based on that. Ooh, sick! Rob. Raa! Nice! I wonder how when they look back at it. They're like, oh, this is where we messed up. And I just cannot see where. Well, remember that once you... They probably have filmed this so many times. They probably have done this individually so many times. That, yeah, they can see things that... I wasn't as high as I... That was the kick wasn't as high as I used to. Or, um, like, off center. Or, so and so weren't necessarily this moment. It's just like that, no, me neither. It's just freaking great. Also, the camera is not bang on in the middle. Because it's moving, yeah. That style of stuff. Hey! Bro, they're so sharp, though, even the C stuff looks great on them. Don't what the fuck? Ah, the synchronism! How do I look that tight in the music? The core. Is the popping and licking thing? It looks... So sick. Oh, shit. See, he didn't hook his other arm towards the other person? Bro, it looks so fun! This guy's had a life of fun times in this. Nice! Damn! Oh, it's just seriously. So good. So, again, we have a minute for this mix. Whoever made this. Ah, so sick! Bro! Ah! I love that beat. I love my favorite beat. Well, see, that was like crumping. A little bit of crumping there. Light stuff, nothing to like... Nothing to like... The clumsiness. I love that beat. It's the best beat of that thing. I wonder what they're up to now. The reason the comments are switched off on this. No, they're so freaking... Maybe I think maybe because of the memes used in the mix of the songs. No, you think it's bad. Maybe that was the center focus of the comments section. Maybe they didn't want that to be made. No idea. But that is the... What their social media is on nothing else. It says... It's like a university competition thing. What? 2017, 28th of October. It has fit 13 million views. That is stupid. Let us know if there's any other dance groups you guys would like us to check out. I want to have a few. Good bye.
