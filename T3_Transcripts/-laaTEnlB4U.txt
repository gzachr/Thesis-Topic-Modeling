We have been celebrating the Christmas New Year in my home. So, always I'm still celebrating my New Year May Christmas on the island. How means human or people? Welcome to the Tao Expedition. Or as the lost boys call it the human expedition. For the next five days we sail across the Northern Palawan known as the most beautiful set of islands in the world. We get to know the islanders and the hardship and struggles of living. Learning on the sea while living in a place we would call parenance. We are going to give a shower to all of you. You are going to eat a rock, you are going to have a bass. Oh, it's like a bass. Oh, I know. He's on a bass. Are you feeling fish with fish? He's got it, man. He's gone. You ready to try? Everybody do this. I'm going to eat the fish. I'm going to eat it. I'm going to eat it. I'm going to eat it. Why? Why? It is what it is. Why? It is what it is. Why? It is what it is.

Let's catch this sunset. This is local as it get, guys. Are you going in? Wow. You're welcome. Look at that. This is where we're going to sleep. Hots like these. Lay down here, sleeping on bamboo. And then we get a mosquito net, of course. No electricity. This is it. Island wipes to the maximum. Look at that. I wouldn't want to be anywhere else in the world right now. There's a small bridge here too. It is so quiet. It is so peaceful. There's a story behind this cave and that when there's a big storm, typhoons, the fishermen come into here for protection. And you can see definitely why it's a protective area, a communion partner with a towel expedition. I am so inspired and honored to go on this trip with them. Thank you, guys, for the invitation.

We should experience your palawan. Palawan. Tao Tao Tao Tao Tao. We live in Sibu. We should experience your ex-sibu. You're healthy. Hello, Ireland. Dream on. I know you. Hello. Hello. Hello. You have my own size in the middle of it. In the big city. And then you are grown up in the island. And then you don't know how to use the topic life. Just keep crossing, running in the space. I can imagine that. You can also catch it. And it's pretty good. It's pretty pretty pretty. That's the figure. You don't know how these are the topic life. Of course, there is no topic like the island. We've been celebrating the Christmas New Year in my hometown. So always I'm celebrating my New Year, my Christmas on the island. But the most important thing you are happy. Yeah, I think that's the name of the Tao Los Boys. I think they came from the Peter Pan. I love Peter Pan. We love Peter Pan. That's why we are lost. So I mean, I shared our experience to be islanders and how to be islanders. So we have a brother, sister, they want to go study. And then I want to work and to support my sister brother to go to the study. So that's our culture here. You have to support the family. And then helping your sister to your mom. That's our culture here. And then in Palawan.
