And the movies and more. Okay, so I don't understand. I don't know. It's a nice title. Yes. And it was the Philippines, obviously a beautiful country. So movies sometimes want to shoot there for some beautiful jungle rainforests. Did you say Thanos snapped himself to the Philippines? Yes, that's exactly his snap. And he's like, hmm, which jungle should I go to? Oh, no bow. And then he just had a giant bowl of it and he just started eating it. Chicken joy, a big bucket of chicken joy.

This is a recommendation from our Instagram. Check out our Instagram down in the description below. DM us your suggestions for the next Philippine video that we want. That you want us to check out and follow our travels. Where is Georgia? We travel in some cool pictures. Let's do this. I did. I'm sorry. I got so excited about Georgia and giant monolith monuments. Oh. That's one of the punch somebody. You got to see that in a instant. Oh, yes. All right. Let's do this. Here we go. Whoa. That's the way to bring in a piano. International films. Do they just call American films international? Ah. Where's I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. That's just a caricature of very patriotic American people. All right. You'll be breathing. I have not heard of that one. It's a three-and-one shot. Some parts of the words don't interest me. Oh, man. Oh, man. You see those back muscles. Yeah. That's in the sports guy. That's interesting. Who's up in the third? What about this second one? Yeah. Interesting. Oh, that has been having the RPG. What the... What the heck is this? This is like a Wario Patriots necklace. This is like a Warming Joe showdown in the RPG. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. The Warming Joe showdown in Pundilla. What a Russian film. Because that makes sense why it would be shot in the Philippines. The Warman. Master. It's a lot of... K-Dramas. South Korean movies film the Armeroing. They seem to talk about the Philippines a lot in K-Dramas. They're always like, yeah, he went to the Philippines and he got in trouble and I was coming back. Squid Game and Crash Landing on you from what we've known of. Have talked about it. Yeah, like the mobster and Squid Games went and got a bunch of gambling debt in Filipino casinos. Something like that. And then the bad guy in Crash Landing on you also tried to go hide in the Philippines. It did stuff in the Philippines. So I don't know what the heck. They mentioned it in movies. Okay. I think it's very smug. It's a big ramp. I know that. Manila got destroyed in the movie. Metro Manila. Oh man. Manila. Manila. The Hoverney Warman. Dramas. The heck. I don't know if that. Is that like referring to that movies show the Philippines as being like super poor and buying back and stuff? Maybe back and stuff. I don't know. I can't give. Tourist kidnap. Oh. That looks very violent. In prayer before dawn. Whenever something says before dawn, it always sounds like a zombie movie. Yeah. Wonder why. I don't know. It goes backwards to the Democratic porn. The bull in the way. Is that Hawkeye? Is this an Avengers movie? Yes. It flows down the air. They're in the G.P. That is a G.P. Oh my gosh. They run into destroyed G.P. This is messed up. And speaking of the Avengers. I have watched this one. Oh. What is this movie? It's just the most popular movie of all time. What? The right stairs. They have big moon in the Philippines. I didn't know the moon was that big in the Philippines. Well, that's pretty epic. Back where we lived, the moon's a bit smaller. No, it's actually a lot smaller. That's right. Wow, that's a big moon. I can feel you guys. Yeah. Wait, Dinos is from the Philippines? He's that big boy. Yeah? Yeah. His arms are very large. Big boy, Lure! The music is very odd. It's the silence. It's just Thanos licking out of the giant moon. Saddamat, see how puna I didn't know. I didn't know it was an able to finish it. You got the Saddamat, at least. Saddamat. Thanks. SB19, so. Yeah. Yeah. Wow, there's three movies I think I knew in there, which is pretty crazy. There are some bigger movies too. Some bigger action movies. And I didn't know they were in the Philippines. All right, that was pretty cool to see. Like that, so many movies are shot there. Obviously that really cool scene in endgame, where Thanos is there. He's just in his hot tune. He's like, on the rice cooker now. Not a rice cooker, right? He's just there picking his rice, being Thanos. And then he gets freaking murdered. Yeah, but I think he might lose in a appendage. And a head. But yeah, hopefully you guys enjoyed. Really interesting to see all the different movies that were here. A lot of them we didn't really know, because they're international to us as well. So the German movies, the different countries like that, didn't really know. But hopefully you guys enjoyed. If you didn't subscribe. Like the video, we'll see you in the next one. Bye-bye.
