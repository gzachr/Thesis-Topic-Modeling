 Hey what's up guys welcome to one of the video my name is Kirin and today we're gonna be looking at the pearls and cons living in the Philippines but today we're gonna be covering BGC There's a lot of funds living in the city but there's also a lot of negatives Now I'm not gonna try to be obviously offensive on the negatives because I believe every country has their negatives and their positives So that being said guys let's jump in right into the video Now one thing I'm not gonna be doing on this video it's be shocked by everything I see Because I've been here for three years and a half so there's nothing for me to be shocked about But I think there's a lot of important things to mention living in BGC and that I personally like and I don't even live in BGC I live in a McKinley area so just to kind of give you an idea But this city overall is very nice it's very clean and very safe So that being said the first point we're gonna cover is safety So I believe and I think it's a fact that BGC is one of the safest cities and the Philippines It's privately owned as well you can see a lot of parks You can basically walk around here at 3 a.m. 4 a.m. nothing really happened to you Now there have been some cases where little things happen every once in a while but it's not major It's a very safe city if you want to have your family here or just you know just feel safe overall I'm currently walking in this park right here is just across from force strip just that way And it gets very hot during the day here I think most people come here around 4 to 5 p.m. But it's very nice a good place to work out you can actually see some people working out over there Or never mind he just left, but this guy over here he's running here so it's perfect Now the good thing about the Philippines now is we don't actually have to wear masks outside For the past maybe 3 or 4 months plus perfect easy to vlog It's just everything to be more chilled but you still have to wear masks inside In the malls, restaurants or you know your condo and stuff like that But now it just seems more chilled, more free I've been here since 2019 so I stayed the whole quarantine in the Philippines It was kind of rough but it was not bad I actually never left So I'm still enjoying it and I've seen the ups and downs in the countries But now it seems to be calm down and everyone seems to be enjoying their life There's still people wearing their masks I can see why but for myself I'm not to worry anymore Now another pro living in BGC is the food options There's a lot of different type of food options we have all the way from Spanish food, Indian food, German food and much more So sometimes it's a little bit pricey but you know this kind of makes sense why it would be slightly pricey living in this location But we're going to talk about prices and restaurants in another video So right now we're going to head to high street in BGC and see what they have right now Because it's Saturday and there's a lot of people walking around and there's a nice environment Now guys if you're thinking of moving into BGC in terms of locations where you can live Right now the prices are a bit lower because of COVID So you can find some really good spots around BGC or in the outskirts of BGC for good prices like example 1 unit apartment will cost you around 25K And you can actually find lower prices on that Two bedrooms usually varies between 40 to 60K But like I said there's a ways you can play around with it to get a cheaper price You can pay a few more you know one year in advance or six months in advance And they can usually bring down the price for you so right now is a great time to come here to find units and just live in the city overall So it's pretty good pretty good stuff Now if you're familiar with BGC this area usually is cover and plants They have this little flower market and it's full of nice plants, cactuses and have different things as well You're very nice I'm not sure at what time of the year they usually have this but usually it's covered here And it looks very nice even now to be honest it looks kind of nice Just having an open area right here That way is the Hennessy place They're doing an event for Hennessy and they build a basketball court And a little sort of poster that's printed on the ground I'm going to show you how that looks like right now How do I run honey or dash? You spend too much cash, screw your g**** bags Under the chewed and last I'm in physics class, under the chewed and asked She got too much, what I feelin do it all that Talked to Elon last week, told him I went too fast, 120 on a dash Right there in front we have Lapikara I think one of the best Spanish restaurants in BGC Well another one just opened last week around this area I'm going to show you how that looks like Because it looks very very nice, I love the style of that restaurant Now this is one of my favorite areas in BGC Mainly because of the trees There's a lot of shadows so you don't get too hot throughout the day This one right here It's very calm There's a lot of cats actually around this area And they're fed by the city, I'm not entirely sure But there's a lot of cats right here And let me show you right here So you can see a lot of trees are covered Covering the sun They're perfect place if you want to have a little cup of coffee Or some lunch throughout the day So that's very handy, I'm going to show you right here I'm going to shut up for a little while and kind of walk through the city So the Spanish restaurant that I mentioned I just opened a week ago is this one right here Very very nice, I haven't tried the food yet But it looks very cool And we have a very famous restaurant right here called Elephant Grounds And a German restaurant right here Which I can pronounce But it's very good So guys another pro living in the Philippines is that the city is so so clean You rarely see any garbage on the floor It's very well maintained, especially the parks Or even when there's a night out, there's not really trash around the area You might see trash there now and then but it's very minimal, very nice stuff Now guys we're going to be talking about the first negative living in the Philippines Not just in BGC but in the Philippines And this is not the sound of the fan in any sort of way Because like I mentioned before I believe every country has their pros and cons But I think one of the negatives I found in the Philippines is the customer service It's not great, it's not so great There's a lot of things that could be fixed just like that But I guess that's normal you know You can have it all Those things can be from slow service when it comes to food Or just going to example if you want to do some paperwork Usually it's very slow Now if you have no patients when it comes to stuff like this You're going to have to have a lot of patients Because that's how things are done here But I'm not sure why that's done I want you to comment below why you think the service is done as great Or if you believe the service is actually good So comment below I want to see your questions because I'm actually very curious I'm not sure if that's cultural or just happened to be this way So yeah comment below guys Now guys the next con is you know I like this one but it's the food I don't think it's that great like people think By the way I'm Spanish myself, Spanish Irish No I'm not saying that all the food is bad Because there's some stuff that I really really like But I think overall the food is not that great Honestly it's a lot of the stuff is fried And very greasy and sweet I think Filipinos really like sweet stuff That might just be my thing You know I don't like sweet stuff so that could be my own issue But yeah not a big fan of that I think a lot of foreigners come here and they compliment the food a lot Either that's because either they really love it Or maybe a bit of clickbait But for me I'm gonna be honest like I said I'm trying to be offensive I've been in different countries all around the world And some of the food over there is not good There's a lot of Spanish food that's not good for me I've been to Switzerland where the food is very plain Just plain, there's almost a flavor to it Now once again there's a lot of nice German food The same way the Philippines, there's nice Filipino food And then there's not that good food So that's a negative for me personally Coming from somebody who likes salty foods If I can mention guys if I feel like there's something I don't like I am going to mention it I think this whole channel is gonna be based on just being honest I'm not really trying to sugarcoat things when they should be sugarcoded So I'm gonna be talking about things I like about this country That's why I'm here because obviously I like the country But if I see some things that are not good I'm going to mention them But so hopefully you don't get offended by something like this And if you have an issue just come in below And we'll see how it goes from there So right now we're very close to Forbes town right here But before we go there We're gonna have to mention another con, Lidlin and BGC Actually not in BGC Just outside BGC really And that's traffic So I'm sure everyone knows that traffic is really bad here Especially doing Christmas time There's been a big issue with grab So if you're an example at home and you want to go to a restaurant And you book a grab doing Christmas time If you'll find out that you actually can't get a grab And sometimes you will be looking for hours and hours and hours And you cannot find anything And that also applies for anchors Like us and joyride So my advice would be If you are looking to get around Or trying to go out of a city So example if you're in BGC and you want to go home Well the way to pass like I would recommend to leave BGC at around 2 to 3pm Because anything after that is just rough Like you'll be hours I think in 2019 I spend with one of my friends About six hours in BGC Just to look for a grab And then I'll be doing anything Also we wanted to drink some beer So that was an excuse as well So yeah, traffic is a big problem here So you have to keep that in mind So if you're in patients like me And you don't want to wait around for grabs or anything like that Honestly guys, if you're a foreigner Or anybody in general that has low patients I don't have time to wait Get a scooter right now You'll save so much money So much so much money and grab Anchors, joyride and all the kind of stuff or taxis So that's what I've been using for the past two years of plan It's just been amazing If I want to go somewhere I take my scooter and I go right away Now this place you're seeing right now This is called Burgocercl A lot of people come here to walk their dogs I wish I had a dog but I can really take care of myself So a dog wouldn't be good for me So yeah very nice place to chill Like I mentioned, a lot of dogs are on this area And actually dogs all around high street If you all that street all the way up to market market It's just full of dogs and cats If you have a cat or a dog Walk them around, it's very chill And you get to meet all the people as well you know And his rubbicide forps down But yeah, pretty cool place So my friend Salam actually happens to be around So we're gonna meet him He's a good friend of mine And you might see some bugs for me and him I'm doing boxing together So that's gonna be fun Let me tell you something about Salam He's not a type of guy with a lot of emotion He's a lot But he's a very straight up guy He's a very logical guy And you'll get to know him and the vlogs Hopefully in the future Yeah, it's a strange human Very smart guy though And a very fun guy But yeah guys, anyway I'll see you when I meet this guy right here Bye Right, he's coming down here I'm gonna give him a mic Because I'm currently using a bloated mic The man The myth The legend Salam, the droid I thought you guys are a weird guy NPC walking into the bushes Salam before you say anything bad Introduce yourself Hold the mic, where is the mic Hi people My boy I'm not
