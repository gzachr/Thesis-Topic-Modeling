 Hi guys! Hi guys! Hi guys! Today, I wanted to see some questions, so I'm going to say hello. Yeah! We were in a relationship for 1 year, right? Yeah! But we were in Korea a while ago. But we were in Korea a while ago. We went to Korea a few times. Yeah! We were in Korea a while ago. Yeah! Let's talk about that. Okay! You're trying to raise the teacher. I'm not sure. Okay! Can I come first time? Yeah! Actually, when I went to the supermarket in Korea, after living in the Philippines, for one time, maybe 7 months, this month, I don't know where. Yeah! Then, I guess I'm very excited. Because, yeah, the first time, the first place where I went, is the supermarket. There's many foods and ingredients. And, I can tell you, that I'm in the emotions. Yeah! So, I put in the shopping cart. Many things. Oh! We were in a relationship. Yeah! Like a snake. I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, I was like, Yeah! So, we have to go to the counter. Not in the Philippines. In the Philippines. Yeah! Actually, in the Philippines. Just, I just threw the cart and put it on the counter, in the airs, or body went to buy. Then, they just cash her, just laying the barcourt and putting the press back, and put back in the shopping cart. Yeah! They themselves got, No! There's a lot of things in here. And they carry, and they carry the our ingredients and foods and carry them to our cart too. Oh, right. So, I can't use them. Then, in the Philippines, when we go shopping, we get the most people. Mom, I'm so happy to go shopping. Yeah. I want to buy something. I want to buy something. But, if we put the cart on the counter, and we get the most people, we just buy it and make it. And we get the most people. We get the most people. But, I don't think it's that easy. That's right. That's right. But, Gloria! I have to carry them or our staffs. That's right? Yeah. Are you hungry? Yeah, I'm fine. Yeah. We have... Yeah. We have to carry them in the plastic bags? No. No, we have the... plastic bag? No, plastic bag. Yeah. They are very hungry. Yeah, the shopping bags. And we have to carry them back to the shopping cart too. Yeah. So, what should we do? We must have forgotten them. We just took all the things You were like in a movie on a beach horrible and so tiny still there Your family refused harmony I was about to say that the company was in a hurry. They were about to say that the company was in a hurry. They were about to say that the company was in a hurry. Yeah. So... Yeah, I didn't know that it was a hurry. Yeah, nobody knows that. So, just we hurriedly hefty the outward and the shopping bags. That's maybe when you finish to the mini bar course, the cashier. Yeah. Then I was very impressed. That's right. We were really shocked. It was so much more than anything. It was so much more than anything. Why didn't you ask me why you didn't ask me? Yeah. You were really impressed. That's what I did. Yeah. That's right. On everything. Yes. Do you have any other things? Just go ahead and you first. Okay. The other things that I can remember. One thing there is... Yeah. Maybe when I arrived in Elport, yeah, Elport, then just... Oh, I sat down at the empty stage with my family and I ran the convenience store in Elport in my family and bought some snacks like dessert and bread and some things. Yeah. And we went to the restaurant. Oh, not that much. Yeah, we went to a restaurant with my father, on me. And you went to a restaurant with my brother, right? Yeah. We got to meet him. It was the very least. We were not able to meet him. I didn't know where the restaurant's name was. But yeah, it was the place that I served many foods. Like noodle recipe. And there are some things just made. And there is a pork carton with kimchi too. Do you remember? Oh, not pork. Yeah. Me too. I like that. Yeah. Then... Yeah. When I ordered it, I actually just I remembered. And there is a machine that curled your ass. Wow. I don't know. That's right. And you know, you have to use that in Korean. But you have to use it in Korean. But you have to use it in Korean. But you have to use it in Korean. Yeah. It's not used to eat us. Even in Korea, even in the 20th of December. Even in the 20th of December. Even in the 20th of September. In the 20th of September. Yeah, in the 20th of September. Yeah. Yeah. But in Korea, we use it in Korea. We use it in Korean. And servings. Just servings. It's normally machine in Korea. Yeah, actually the kids. I don't know the name. But yeah, I used to eat it. To order the pork cartilage with kimchi too. Yeah. Then it's not interesting. It's the kiosk. You know? There's a midnight ordering and midnight ordering. And paying already. And I said down at the table. And yeah. You remember. Yeah, when I said down at the table. And however, the staff won't need like three seconds. Yeah, one second. Three seconds. Three seconds. The staff called me, called my listed number maybe. Yeah, the listed number and told me the food was ready. The food was ready. It was ready. It was ready. It was ready. For the first time. I was so surprised that it was so quickly. Yeah, we are really? Yeah, we are. Really? Yeah. It was so fast. I was so surprised. I think that's how fast I was. I can't remember. I can't remember. I can't remember. I can't remember well. But three seconds after. Just I heard. The staff told me the food was ready and my father's went there. In front of the counter? Conjured right in this case. Yeah. Then brought out his foods. That's right. Just the food's not coming out so quickly. No. It's not coming out so quickly. But Toke was a place where I lived to live Whether or not to lived, let's say,�acity I'm still 8та Although we all屋 taste full there's too much We got back together I don't know many other people. That's more interesting. The all about food is more like that. As a Korean, I'm more than used to it either. What I felt was in the Philippines. If you see someone on the street and say hello, there is nothing strange. In Korea, just say hello to someone you mean for the first time. It's considered very strange. That's right. There are so many people in Korea. Hello, I'm weird. I think Korean people avoid because there are times when a special regional group approaches them. Hey, searchers. Searchers. There is no more. You know, there is no more. It's weird. I'm not sure. It's too cold. Searchers, what should I go if I want to go right Busan? There are many people who are very close to each other. If you go to a group, you will get a cold and people like you. If you go to a group, you will get a cold. How do you go to a group? You have to go to a group. You have to go to a group. But you don't know if you are a Korean or you are a Korean. If you go to a group, you will get a cold. Do you have time? Yes. You have time. You have to go to a group. You have to go to a group. You have to go to a group. If you go to a group, you will get sick. So, Koreans don't accept greeting. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Do you prefer to ask your wife to go to a group? You start just how? That means, it's just to talk. It's just how? It's just to write. Do you prefer to ask your wife to go to a group? It's just how? I have one thing, transportation. I thought I used to be able to take the train and subway well when I lived in Korea. But it seems to have changed a lot more difficult now. I originally had a transportation card, but now I don't have one. So, if you want to write a train or subway, you have to buy a... What do you say? I like to call it. I say one time ticket. You have to buy one time ticket. But I don't know. I don't know. I need and using it is too difficult for me. I have no idea. You don't have an idea. I have no idea. Weird to take care of or other things. That is my impressed things. I have a lot of things to do. I have a lot of things to do. I was very happy. I had a lot of things to do. I had a lot of things to do. I went to a restaurant and ate food. I took a train and started to take care of the bill. I took a train and I was just walking around the street. I was able to go to Korea. But in Korea, you can't just do it. You have to go to Korea and go to Korea. Never you do that. Question. How it would be if I say, Hey, will please, when I sit down on the chair, you can go to Korea. Tomat?
