into this video man of the victor Chetty
of the victor of the victor jenia
factors against us because of his size
and punching accuracy we see of the guys
good right hand by don't
really caught and
disoriented easy Donaire said this that
scored by Maldonado
there's one part about every round and
dramatic fashion
that is right hands Skeens Barca to the
Arsenal Jan he went down to 105 for
that's a bad move according to copy
bonds look at that and I gave Argos that
round
Lefty's richie the friend
a nice dip right jab while he beautiful
Africa with
national news agency - the judges
actually had Oh
I know Matt I'm hearing that crazy power
amount of those punches Oh skies some
serious power brownies punches but he
goes to a lot of the uppercuts and I
notice that ready
Kanaka Dean
and it's over
but in tempo to the top of the hill
this is around judges should score team
a but it may be a Moody's rating ng
Oh
summer morena
Wow
years developing
Oh
mission
jumped in the left hand to don't air
comes right back really good titles but
after all this to survive lads one or
two complete shops I'd rather be
the powers to see one plug that came out
on the athletic levels you were Donaire
not take the money
Wow Donaire fired a punch in the face
particular up till now whenever he
better
instead he lips baskets with a left hook
leap and there was a perfect example of
punches nystagmus in the uppercut
volatility and to a certain degree best
luck tonight
he's been hit professional career years
old
for everyone who's been so excited about
the American dude did his race questions
man who loves his job back we stayed up
which is nothing he's tagging a motto
punch it man
print this intercept Oh Shane inside
he's not afraid to trade with our movie
and who did what
100 punches our data
to go now is going common
we'll cut from Donaire
fighter as oppressor oh good left hand
by Donaire pan by by the pool will touch
the face
why'd you cut the power shot that's
yokas used to win it these wages get her
wish I didn't make him make a mistake
where I can counter
kolja guys fast man inside
Donaire
right hand over the top
and this is what this shield the starts
to do around
into this funny you've been down three
times in his career one another
three years old so he's landing on
demands love's
left with which most people credit than
there is counterpunching still there you
saw let's put the fares at their nose to
the moon
come back
second nuts out of the fight go go there
things like his music was no where is
another left uppercut hole that's it
that's it that's it
let's go wait his arm so he took on
there
that's the third round panel he has good
extension along that hook right there
he's been undressed Oh
the hardest goons to fight this because
his style
straight right hand followed by the left
hook began to overcook - Oh ray
to set up another left hook
know if is gonna be a jab or if it's
difficulty that could come from to see
if it yak to see if he can cut right
there makes you seem set the move back
you go to the judges scorecards there's
a good left hook for donate the mayor
has suddenly seized the initiative in
the fight last time and maybe he wasn't
ready for riggan doe but speed and power
but also a consolidation eka on a donor
left her but money plugs
but now though there has set himself up
for a two-point round in the port and
now the new nice lady for the haka
