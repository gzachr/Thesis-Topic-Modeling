Hi guys! This is Kelly.
Welcome to my channel!
Today, I will be doing Jollibee Mukbang!
We have Jollibee chicken bucket,
and Burger steak,
and this is Peach Mango Pie for dessert, and
OF COURSE
the signature Jollibee Spaghetti!!
Of course, I will not eat all but
I will share it with my family.
So, I will just get a piece of chicken.
Of courses, as decorations(sausages on top)...
Let's eat!
I'm so excited for this spaghetti.
YUMMMMM
The authentic sweet sauce based Filipino spaghetti.
짱! 짱!
Legit the best!
Juicylicious!
Crispylicious!
Jollibee Chickenjoy!
Judy: Email us for business, Jollibee :))
You are enjoying without me..
You are eating there as well LOL
Of course, rice and gravy.
WOAH
It's so yummy!
This time, I will try the burger steak.
with mushroom
I like Jollibee's burger steak because
they give enough mushroom and sauce on top.
They have strong taste in terms of pepper and salt.
But it's so good.
It's really chewy.
I actually have an episode.
Back when I was traveling in Hong Kong,
I had some hard time adjusting to their food.
Like it wasn't easy for us to find
a food that we would really enjoy.
But then we saw Jollibee and we were like,
"This is it! I'm going to Jollibee!!!"
Then, when I went there, I ordered Burger Steak.
It was legit the best.
Like the best version of burger steak I've ever eaten.
Also, their rice is double the size of the Philippines.
So, if you ever go to Hong Kong in the future,
I really suggest that you try the burger steak.
캬~
And...uhm...
This is Jollibee Mukbang + KFC French Fries from Judy hehe
For French Fries, KFC is the best.
So, my sister likes McDonald's french fries and Judy likes KFC.
Judy: Yes!
It's so crispy!
Actually, it's been more than 30 minutes since I got the order.
But it's so so so crispy.
Super!
I want to know the secret of this crispiness in Jollibee.
Because whenever we try to fry the chicken,
it's never this crispy.
Agree?
The burger steak is so good.
The sauce on top of this burger steak is
quite different from the gravy that they give you.
The burger steak sauce has more mushroom-like taste and
stronger pepper taste
compared to the typical gravy.
UGH! It should be heard!!
It's so delicious!
Judy: Oh, you should eat some sausage as well.
The Jollibee spaghetti,,,
They are generous in terms of the sausage and the cheese.
I think Jollibee spaghetti is really the best.
When I compare to McDonald's spaghetti and Jollibee.
This one is really good.
The taste is acceptable for everyone; even a child to olders.
Jollibee really emphasized the Filipino taste culture.
If you start eating this Jollibee spaghetti, you will just fall in love.
It will make you crave more and more.
Also, in the Philippines, there is always rice in every meal.
If you to abroad,
it isn't usual that you'll have a rice meal in the fast food.
Like Subway, McDonald's, or even Lotteria in Korea.
Even McDonald's in Korean, we don't really have rice meal.
It's the unique culture of Philippines
having rice in fast food franchises.
I'm so used to it so when I go to restaurants abroad,
I keep looking for rice menus.
Judy: Koreans' rice power.
Right!
Also, Koreans really love rice
but I don't know why they don't have rice meals.
Do you want to try?
Does it taste good?
Yes! I will give you with rice.
It's yummy.
Isn't it so delicious?
It tastes like grilling a seasoned ground-meat?
That's burger steak...
Exactly!
It's exactly like that.
Like you said, it has strong pepper taste and tender.
Right, it's so tender!
Yes.
It's like cooked with good-quality meat at home.
It's not gamy/ bad.
Yes!
But I think the taste isn't bad taste because of the sauce on top.
Possible.
Because they always put the sauce on top.
Right! Right!
But I just hope that this burger steak is a bit bigger.
Because it's quite small.
Sorry for the noise because they're also having lunch outside.
It's good.
It's not like the taste of pasta we think of.
Yes! It's not like pasta but..
It's stronger tomato taste, sweeter,, like that.
It's like pasta that kids prefer than of those adults enjoy.
Like it has cheese...
Yes, it has that cheesy taste and
And sweet taste!
Right, they have strong sweet taste!
It's like it is adjusted to the Filipino food taste..
(talking time HAHAHAHAHAH)
It's now dessert time: peach mango pie.
But I actually have mango allergy so I can't eat this.
So, Judy will eat this and tell us how it's like.
You know, the peach mango pie became super small.
True!
But it wasn't this small. It was like 1.5x bigger.
Yes, it became to small.
eyes following the food
How does it taste like?
It's delicious but..
(asking something in Korean)
It will be flashed in the subtitle.
"It has strong flour taste."
Yea, it's like that.
But if you look at the inside,
Inside, it's very moisty!
It's very 'crunchy outside and moist inside!'
(Don't cry Kelly...)
Do you want a bite? I can cut for you.
Shall I eat and go to the hospital?
Hospital is the most dangerous area now.. Will I go?
I can taste the sweetness of the mango
and then I can also taste the sourness of the peach.
But I think it's more on the mango taste because it's sweet.
WOW THE SOUND!!
so yum yum~
Describe the scent.
The scent,, it's buttery but l smell the sweetness.
I smell the pastry of the pie, you know, the crunchiness.
I can't film her my right now
but then you should see her face.
WOW
As you eat more and more
you can feel the taste of the...
Oh (the filling) it's falling!
You can taste the peach more.
You know this peach mango pie has a lot of fillings in it.
Yea! That's a lot as you see it.
Well, at least Judy's enjoying it.
h a h a h a I'm happy...
So this is it for Jollibee Mukbang.
I hope you enjoyed and I hope you are craving for Jollibee!!
