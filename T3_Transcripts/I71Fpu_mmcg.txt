hey guys I'm in the island of Siargao for those 
who know me you know that I've been based in  
Bali for a long while I've been living in Bali 
for around 2 years on and off and today I'm  
going to tell you how This Island right 
here compares to Bali I'm going to start by  
talking about accommodation accommodation 
is actually not as cheap as I thought in  
Siargao however it there's a bunch of hosts and you 
know social accommodations where you can meet so  
many people from around the world so this is the 
room it's a three bedroom room right here and we
are I'm going to jump into one of the most 
important topics and this is cost of living  
now the life that you can have in Bali it's 
very different from the one you can have here  
in Siargao in the Philippines. In Bali you can 
live with luxury for a very very affordable  
price while in go I think that luxury is not that 
much there it's more of a backpacking destination  
a surfing heaven so if you are here in Siargao you 
will actually be paying less although it's not  
the kind of luxury kind of Lifestyle so one of my 
favorite things to eat here in the Philippines is  
barbecue pork one oh maybe maybe eight yes 
or maybe two of these two of these apart  
from yeah two of these oh how much is it 210 
perfect 210 pesos! I've been actually coming to  
this place to get some banana every day because 
you know it's good to to have some fruit can I  
have eight of this yes it's uh 10 each right yeah 
have a good day goodbye goodbye so I just got the  
bananas here for a great nutritious day let's 
say for cost of living it's a tie between the  
two and it will depend in what's your preference 
the next thing I'm going to talk about it's the  
community the people here just to generalize I 
would say Siargao is a place for Backpackers and  
Surfers while Bali it's more of a mixed crowd 
of Backpackers too and a lot of exports and a  
lot of creators so in my case as a place to live 
I prefer Bali because a lot of my community the  
creators the people who are starting a small 
business the digital Nomads are mostly their  
and you know the Wi-Fi connections the cafes the 
co-working spaces are better and more prominent  
in valy so for digital Nomads I would recommend 
Bali for Backpackers Surfers people who want to  
have a great time Siargao is your place so guys 
today I'm here oh my God I forgot your name
again and by the way I made Gian okay hey guys 
so I'm here with Gian hey hi guys we're having  
some really good breakfast even though it doesn't 
look like it anymore but it was beautiful at some  
point Jan is a digital Nomad so he lives right 
here in charal I moved from Manila coming here  
in Siargao it was all leap of Faith guys so it's not that 
easy anyway as a sha digital Nance one thing that  
I can suggest you is that you know there's a 
setting of expectation that you should have in  
your mind on because you know power outages and 
some other stuff that you know I've experienced  
that yeah it's very unexpected here but nothing 
to worry because there are hostels hotels that  
had a backup generators especially with the 
co-working spaces even though there's like power  
outages there's co-working spaces so um you can 
still rely on it so guys this is the place that  
I've been working from for the past uh week this 
is called Lexia and it's a co-working space it  
has has all the amenities that you would need and 
especially it has really really fast Wi-Fi we are  
actually staying here in a in kind of a dorm but 
it's it's called the nomad's room it has a desk  
everything so you can work from the room but my 
favorite thing is to go up here and to work from  
this beautiful co-working space so it's really 
really nice here let's talk about food honestly  
Filipino food is so underrated a love a lot of 
people told me they don't like Filipino food and  
I was like so shocked when I tried the Filipino 
food and I thought you know it was so good the  
food options in Bali are more International from 
all around the world actually pretty accurate and  
authentic so you know I think if you're looking 
for different you know International options and  
you want to experiment and like have some fusion 
restaurants that's valy so this is the smothie  
bowl that I just ordered looks so so so [Music] 
good B smoothie bowls are insane but if you want  
real authentic you know Filipino food you'll find 
it here in sha and it's amazing that brings me to  
the next point and this is authenticity in Bali
you can go to very authentic places if you go  
to the North to the west of the island 
you know to the rural areas like Sideman
but guys I hate to say it because I love 
Bali and I think it can be really authentic but  
the places that you would be mostly staying in 
Bali are not as authentic but is getting really  
really crowded and a lot of those tourist areas 
will be full of scams full of people who just  
want to sell you something while here in Siargao 
I feel there's more of a sense of authenticity  
you know there's still a sense of community and 
sharing the local businesses are stronger I feel  
here so definitely you know in authenticity Siargao
wins now I'm going to talk about how to get to  
those islands to get to Bali you know you just 
land in the airport and it that's pretty much it  
right it's a very easy way to get here while 
coming to Siargao is not as easy yes there is an  
airport but you will mostly go to Manila or to seu 
and then fly to Shaga and flights to Siargao from  
Manila or seu are not you know that that cheap 
and that's one of the reasons why it stays so  
authentic and and it's not as crowded however and 
then this is the next point Internal transport is  
so much easier here in Siargao and so much cheaper 
once you get into to Val you know you'll probably  
be ripped off if you take a taxi on the airport 
I recommend you to download grab and just go 10  
minutes walking outside of the airport then you 
will get to see you know you will get to not pay  
tons for your transportation you can go around 
buy motorbikes in Bali but the traffic is so
bad while in sha traffic is almost non-existent 
you can get in the in a tricycle you know they  
will probably not rip you off and you will 
probably be paying the same price that a  
local is paying however at night you know they 
can increase prices and they will maybe try to  
make you pay more than you should but you can hly 
go for like 15 minutes in Siargao out only paying 30  
pesos on one of those tricycle transportations and 
they are also pretty cool now as far as things to  
do outside of the let's say you know expat or 
backpacking Hotpot that you will be staying at  
there is so much to do in Bali uh you can just 
grab a bike and go outside of like Canggu or  
seminyak or Uluwatu, Ubud... one of those places that you 
would mostly be staying and you can be on the wild  
in places like munduk with you know incredible 
nature you know waterfalls like Sekumpul which is  
my favorite waterfall in Bali just Pure nature Rice 
Terraces while if you are in Siargao you can explore  
the north you can go to incredible Islands you can 
do day trips like swimming with jellyfish hey guys  
today I came to this Lake in the Philippines 
and I'm going to swim with jellyfish let's go  
I've always been scared of jellyfish and today 
I'm swimming with thousands of of them big ones  
small ones lucky for me these jellyfish are 
stingless to humans there is so much to do in  
both places but I would honestly say Bali beats 
Siargao in day trips guys I hope this was useful in  
between you know choosing Bali and Siargao honestly 
do both because both are great thank you so much
