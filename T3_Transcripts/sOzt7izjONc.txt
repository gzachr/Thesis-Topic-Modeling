 And would you say that you're the favorite Filipino? The best, is that? I'm a bit biased because this is my motherland, so I'm gonna defer that question to my wife. She's the Mexican. Guess what, guys? We recently had our very first nationally televised TV experience on that 25. And the show is called Gada Umaga. Gada meaning every and Umaga meaning morning. So every morning. And in case you missed it, we've got the entire interview right here in this video, which talks about our family's journey. Let's do it. Let's sell everything and live out of a suitcase and take off from the world. Sell everything. But we gotta be honest, because the whole experience leading up to it was so nerve-wracking for all of us. We don't want to be nervous. If you're nervous, do this trick. We need to turn our nose. Anyway, before we move on though, we wanted to give you all an update on our 100,000 vessels giveaway. First of all, for those who are new here, welcome. We've been giving away cash during the Burm once to our subscribers as a way to show our gratitude for all of the support that we've been receiving. So for our final giveaway this year, we initially planned to give 100,000 vessels to just one lucky subscriber. That was the initial plan however, after going through all of the comments and all of the votes, we've decided to spread the love and choose more winners. So make sure to subscribe right now and watch till the end of this video to find out how you can get a chance to win. So now without further ado, let's get back to our story. All right, I do not feel ready. I'm a little nervous, I'm more excited. I've a lot of butterflies in my stomach. And yeah, we just got a grab and we are on our way now. I can't wait to meet the girls in person. We're being so nervous. So Gada Umaga is broadcasted on net 25, which is nationally televised. And we're gonna be meeting the three hosts. So we've got Miss Pia, Miss Emma, and Miss Diana. And I can't wait to meet them in person. I've been watching all of their videos. How are you watching all their videos when everything pretty much is in Tagalog? So you're gonna need to speak Tagalog on that show. I speak Tagalog. Say something Tagalog to our grab driver. The most that guy. She passed. All right guys, I just read that not only is net 25 and nationally televised in the Philippines, it is also televised in other countries. The US, Canada, some parts of Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and some parts of Middle East. So no pressure guys. Are you nervous? Up off. How about you? Are you nervous? I'm just really excited about them putting makeup on me. I've never really put makeup on. This is my first time. We have made it. Bye bye, Kuyah. Bye. This one. Can we check in here? Yeah. Like this? Yeah. Can you just do it? Yeah. Yeah. Or Kada Omada. Kada Omada. Yeah. And then you can go to Tagalog. Maruno. Conte, Conte La. Conte La. Conte La. Dang girl, what you wearing? I have to do.

Of course, I have to keep with the black shirt. But no shorts today. Got some pants on. Nice to meet you, Trier. Are you happy? I'm pretty sure, at all. No, I'm full Filipino. So she is the writer, the researcher. She pulls up all the bad gossip on Mom duty over here. Guess what time it is? Makeup time. Suddenly the world I used to know I'll see it differently. You want me from a dream that is reality. Baby, baby you are really hurting me. Wow. Hi, baby. You're not supposed to be a shirt. I'm not supposed to be a shirt. And they, and they, and they, and they swear to show. So you? Oh, no. Oh. Because every time you tell me I'm good and bad, I'm full and fine. But nothing ever changes. And now I see you. Baby, you are hurting me. Feeling really pretty right now. In this case, we're going to be doing blockings. They're going to tell us where to stand, where to go, when the show starts. Behind the scenes, people behind the scenes. What are the things you want to do? Falling, falling. What are the things you want to do? Oh, come to the family. Yes. We're from here. So, after the VTR, the host will call you. And then from here, walk, walk, walk, walk. You, sir. You, sir. You're going to see here. And I can't think James. What? You're going to enter.

There's no wrong move. That's fine. Okay. We're a bit nervous now. It's almost. It's almost airtime. It's so nervous. I feel like a gagging, but I know it's going to be so much fun. Because we don't want to be nervous. If you're nervous, do a straight jump and breathe out. Breathe in. Breathe in. Turn. No. The bike. Hey. Hey. Hey. I'll come up one time. I'll come up one time, guys. I'll come up one time. One, two, three. I'll come up one. One, two, three. I'll come up one. Hey, guys. Before we go out there, I just want to say I'm proud of these guys right here. Thank you. Thank you. I'll come up one time. Okay. It's airtime. Airtime. I'm going to play it. I have to play it. I'll check my chest. Don't don't push it. Check my chest. Check my chest. About it. Five years of being a nomad here in Philippines, you nomad, guys. You don't have to go out. It's just a little bit. It's just like San San Palipat. And they decided to move out. Here in the Philippines, let's watch it. Let's watch it. Let's watch it. They traveled the world. They visited 25 countries and over 100 cities. But they were able to get the Philippines. Meet Nalven, Russia, Knox and Via Ocampo. The Mexican family was able to get to the social media. They were able to travel online. They were able to get the same content as the family. They're now popular with hardship, nì…ˆ Good morning! Good morning! Good morning! Good morning! Good morning! So beautiful! Good morning! Good morning! Have a seat! Okay! First, greet our cadas. Can you greet our cadas? Oh! Greet our viewers in your language. Yeah, in your language. In Mexican. Oh, what's that? Buenos dias! Buenos dias! Oh my god! Okay, guys. How are you? I'm good. You're good. You're good. I'm so happy to see you in my language. You know how to speak. I'm not that good. You understand? But you understand. You understand? You understand? I understand. That's it. This is hard. Is it 25 or 35 countries? 25 countries. 25 countries. 25 countries. And over 100 cities. Wow! And would you say, now, you're in Philippines, your favorite? The best. Is that the favorite? Well, that's... I'm making you say that. Which one is your favorite amongst the 25 places that you've been to? I'm going to say it by you because this is my motherland. So I'm going to defer that question to my wife. She's the Mexican. I mean, I love the Philippines. I mean, that's why we decided to move here. It's, you know, the people, everyone is so nice. Everyone's so friendly. And as a mom, also, you know, it's very safe. Yeah. You're pure Filipino. Yes, I am. You're Kapampanga. I'm Kapampanga. What were chickens roam around? Oh, yes. And then you grew up? New U.S. Yes, yes. I left in 1986. And then you met her? Yes. I met her 15 years ago. And then I took her with my grandparents to Phampanga. Wow! When was that? That was 13 years ago. Yeah. It was your first time here in the Philippines. Your first visit, Phampanga. You know that Phampanga is the culinary capital of the Philippines. So what is the first food that you tried there? Sniagang. Sniagang. I got it. So how was it? Oh, it's so good. I love sour, lemony dishes. And so I have Sniagang all the time. Is there a difference between Mexican or Philippines? Is there a difference? In terms of culture, I would say very similar because we both have that sense of community, families, gatherings, and the food, the authentic food is so good. Like some, it's home cooked. And the language is, there's some words there. It's similar. Yes. You can say it's a foreign language. Yes. Now let's go to the key. I want to know what they think about the Philippines. Yes. Okay. I would like to go first. I'll go first. Okay, go. You used to meet me. How do you like the Philippines? I really like it. When I first came here, it was like beautiful. It's like I felt home. It's like you were second home, aside from Mexico? Yes. But then when I came to the Philippines, I met all my dad's family and it was really fun. What do you love about the Philippines? I love the food in the culture. It's very nice. Probably chicken and dobo. That's what our favorite. Yeah, probably. I'm a lucky baby girl. Well, I love the people here. They're so welcoming and nice. And right when we came here, I felt like I was home. That's how I feel. Did you know that they're twins? Yes. I'm not a single one. I'm not a single one. Can you guess who's the oldest one? Oh, good question. Are you? Yes. So where do you plan to visit next year in the Philippines? What province did you visit? What's it from Pampanga? Well, we've been to Sabu. So we kind of explored Sabu. The whale sharks, the decoassum falls. And we did El Nido. What do you guys want to visit next? Next. What's your name? I don't know. I'd like to go there again. I'm so...yes. Oh, what about you? Definitely shark elk. I love beaches to water, no swimming. There are so many beaches here in the Philippines. Yes, there is. And the beach to Boracay. That's my favorite. I've been living here for 18 years. I'm originally from Brazil. I really love the Philippines. Just the way you guys described. The first time we come here, wow, why are the people so nice? Why is it so similar to Latin America? Did you feel the same way? Yes. Similarities in terms of everything. From how warm the people are. Through everything else. Even the streets sometimes they look the same. Yes. Right? Well, we stayed in Brazil for more than a month. Oh, wow. How is it? Lovely. Philippines is better. Philippines is better. I thought. We saw your beaches on YouTube. And as always, you guys have voted as well. And as a family that's making the decision. So when you were voting for living in the Philippines, what was the result? When people were vote. What was the result of us voting? Well, it's funny because on our third year of traveling, we wanted to like, okay, let's find a travel base. Where we can get situated, find a little bit more security. And we had to have unanimous decisions. Yes. Right? It's not until we went to BGC, this is what we want to be. Yeah. The best place. Do you have Filipino friends now? Yes, we do. Because in here we have some friends here too. A lot. A little bit. Maybe soon. Yeah. But our best friends are going to move to the Philippines soon. Wow. They're not Mexico. They're not Mexico. No, from the US. We're all vloggers when we met in BGC, the beginning of this year. And then we just became really good friends. And now they're moving from Denver to here. And random question. How did you all start this YouTube thing? No. Because like, it's not very common that a family will stop everything they're doing. They become an all-mannered and go from a country to another. And you know, even share that with everyone. How did that start? A lot. A lot of story. They're going to have to do it for 11 hours. 11 hours? Sure. Well, I would say since there were one, we were already traveling probably eight to nine times out of the year. So that until they went to the public school in the US, where we were still traveling, and then we started getting notices from the government saying you can't take out your kids that much, right? Right, yeah. They have rules. So we would travel a lot and we would take the kids out a lot. And so we just decided, we'd love traveling. So let's do it. Let's sell everything and live out of a suitcase and take off from travel the world. Sell everything. In California. We're living in California. Yes. So you took that risk? We did. We took the travel. Not knowing the pandemic was going to start a year later. You started traveling a year? What year? 2019. 2019. How was that, didn't it? Well, when the pandemic started, we were at the Maltes and we were going to get stuck there. We got an approval to actually travel to Dubai. And we got stuck in Dubai for three months. Three, but a few years before we went to Dubai. Yes. And then after Dubai, you went back? We had the decision to, like, do we continue vlogging? We weren't really vlogging at that time. We were just taking pictures on Instagram. Vlogging just started about a year and a half ago. So we were like, you know what? When no one's building, that's when you build a business. And that's we kept traveling. We just kept doing it. And that's when her Instagram account just blew up. I'm there. How many followers do you have right now? Can you share your thoughts? We do. We have a little over a million. A little over a million. From what number? From what number you started in YouTube or Instagram? We started on Instagram. And before the pandemic, we were about 250,000 followers. But since we were doing something very unique at that time, I think people were following us along and they were at home. Everyone was in home watching us. No one else was traveling. Yeah. Except for us. Yeah. What did the kids think about that? I only take a moment. Good question. It's a really nice experience and I'm very grateful to travel around the world. And not a lot of people get travel around the world. So right before the pandemic hit, we started traveling. But we only did pictures. And then right when the pandemic hit, we started doing videos. And then very nerve-wracking. My mom started talking. She was actually an introvert. Very shy. Very, very shy. And then your mom started talking. And then they just said, why is my mom doing videos? The one is that was it like that shot? Yeah. And my sister started doing it. And then I'm like, I gotta try that too because the sister is doing it. And then we just started doing it. And then it just became a normal thing. That's a video I'll go for. I'm going to go for it. Yes, we had one criteria for us to sell everything. I had to learn on YouTube how to pick up a camera, cover, and then edit. So YouTube, by the way, is very humbling. It is the hardest thing I've ever done. So it is tough. So you guys edit the video. I have all this white hair. Make up, I know. I think they sprayed my hair before. I still have more questions to you guys. No, you guys plan on being in the Philippines for a long while. Is that the settle here? Good question. The question. Well, you're going to have to watch YouTube. Oh, I see. Subscribe, Mom, duty. Now go ahead. You have answered for that. You want to settle here in the Philippines? Absolutely, I feel like. I really want to settle down in BDC because I feel like right when we came here, I felt like it was just home. I felt so cozy in home. So yeah, my answer is yes. So one yes? One yes. One yes. Is this a family? We have a family. We have a family. Next question. Yes, exactly the same thing. I would write when I came here. It's amazing. Like the food and the culture, I say yes. Yes. How about the Mexican food? They're the Mexican. They're the Mexican. So it's kind of virus. How about a pure Mexican food? Very good. Yeah. I don't think it's a good thing to do. Yes, of course. I mean, it has a similar lifestyle. BGC, we fell in love with it when we arrived. So, and you know, some of his family is still here. So, and then we can bring more family. That's a come. That's bringing more. Yeah. Well, we're getting our best friends to move. I will not ask you anymore. Yes. No, I'm not. I'm only, I only work for her. So whatever she says, I have to say yes to her. All I guess here, I required to participate in fun games here. So since we heard that you guys are practicing Tagalog or Philippine language. So we have a challenge for all of you.
