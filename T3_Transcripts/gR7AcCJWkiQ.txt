 Future Friday. The Threshes. Filipino Facebook is like a whole sensation. Every time I get sent a link from Facebook, I'm like, this is about to be a hit. I just know it. Because, for example, this particular video is a peanut seller that came to this, crash this guy's gig who was playing on the guitar. He's like, you know this song I'll sing for you. And this is what happened. Sir! I come on you. Why he moved the peanuts? Why all the peanuts from this man? This is a mercury strategy, bruh. I'm starting to be a girl. And it's got charisma. He's got charisma. Oh, it's actually good. Send me your paypal, y'all buy all the peanuts. This is how you buy peanuts. Oh, come on. Nasty! That is so good. He got through a crowd. That's it, you know. Oh, it's just charisma. No, it's just a reason. The peanut started. The peanut-recent man. All the women, they just see how they're looking at him as well. Yeah. He left their wheat peanuts. He's gonna leave with no nuts. And all these girls, oh, whoa. They're well-skinned peanuts. Peanut puns. No peanut puns here. Because I was like, he's gonna say his voice is getting all these girls pregnant. No, no, no, no. And he's selling peanuts. No, no peanut puns. Demonetized. Also, his posture is 10 out of 10. Look how great. How lifted he is. Also, the positioning of the mic. Yeah, he sings. He's done this before. Here goes the yellow one. Singing. Singing. And he is at this jockey master. He gets people to sing along. A man of many talents. Look, zero effort. He literally zero effort. He's just out of the league. Get this man a job on television. Go back. Oh my god. A magical, so great. He is so great. He is so great. Wow. Parasayo. Peanut's peanuts, everybody. That is stupid. That is so great. That is so great. So much control. So much. Bite your peanuts. Oh my god. No, okay, let's talk. Let's talk. Brilliant posture. Brilliant freaking projection. That guy has that look. Like his projection from his chest. It's so brilliantly done. Peanut's peanut. It's better than some people that you get out here and learn than just basking around. This guy is so great, bro. And then you've got adding to the whole pressure point of this. You've got great charisma. Fantastic crowd control. Absolutely phenomenal communication with that guitarist that was not his, by the way. They did not rehearse this. They were just like ping-pong-pong-pong-pong-pong. That's what you know, like culture so different. Because that would never happen around here. It's really rare. But it makes my brain explode. Obviously, you don't have street sellers here in England either. Not often. But you wouldn't, I mean more like on the cultural aspect of like, you know, hey brother. Things together. Let's sing together. And this guy, yeah, absolutely. Here is a bit more like, it's just different countries have different like cultures. And one of the coolest things. This week is so happy though. About this is that he actually reminds me a lot of back home. That is how shit up race back home. It really feels like South America. It really feels like Venezuela, Colombia, Brazil. You name it. This is basically what it all looks like. It is so fascinating. He not saying that. The only difference is this, you know, He's actually good. Yeah, like it is not meaming. You know, like he's not trolling. He's actually technically what a singer. Correct. It's fabulous. It's fabulous. And then you can also see how he's got the whole crowd captivated. Like it's not just like I came here to, let's just make fun of whoever it's happening or whatever's happening. It's just like, let's provide the vibes. Bro, and Philippine on Facebook is mental, bro. Yes. Like we get tagged and stuff and some of this, and some of this pose. And it's just singing. And maybe it's because it's us. I don't know. But it's just like singing left and right. And some of the most random videos you will ever imagine in your life. It's just crazy. What are we doing here? And like it's just mental. These are things ridiculous. Look, look, look. This is what it is. Oh God bless you. Happy birthday, yeah? And then he starts singing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Naturally, naturally. You must. You must. For improvement. Anyways, look, let us know if any of the videos you like us check out. Find out who that guy is. I want to find out who he is and I want to buy some peanuts. Buy peanuts. 40 pesos.
