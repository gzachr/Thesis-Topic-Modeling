 Good morning. Another day, another dollar. What a beautiful view. What a beautiful morning. Soon we can have our breakfast here outside. I admire the view. And when we sit, we won't see the other houses. But still have a bit of a view. So it's good. Today I need to go and buy a door for the room in the car park. We can't do too much work until we get the door. So I'm going to get going on to start installing the pipes. To feed the water from the upper tank to the house. And plenty more to do. Let's do that. This morning we're going to make a little wall around here. So the water just goes out of there instead of coming to the carpet. And here as well as we purge this, it's going to make a little square wall of cement. Just to allow the water to go one side. And that should do it. If I'm not back yet, it's going to start installing the pipes to feed the house from this tank. It's a gorgeous morning but we know it's going to get really hot by the wrong. So I'm going early. Hopefully come back early before the rain. So let's go sit hard way first. I found my door and a few fittings. It's all going to the cashier now. This is another stone from City Hardway. It's got a lot of things here too. Just a little bit north of City Hardway. That's what it's called. It's called Triumph Hardway. But please start from my installation here. You should need urgent help. Sit here with me there. Thank you sir. Let's buy some chicken manoeuvres. No cooking to that. I just get some vitamin C around here. And then I'm home already home. Let's go. This is a door about this plywood 1799. Up around the screen the Cleveland of the US dollar. No more in there. Okay. Yeah very good. The water will go up there. That is a bit smallish. I should have marked the floor for him. This is no good enough. This is going to be much wider. The water comes out and it's going to splash. Anyway we'll correct that. Gun Gun is going to have his Miranda. I brought him some nice pan. He got a cold drink. Coconut pan. Freshly made. Nice huh? You eat. Don't worry about me. You eat. You got medication? Little ones a bit sick. Temperature mommy? Yeah kids always temperature because they're growing. Hello my love. She just wake up. She haven't wake up yet. Give me a little bit of bread after. I'm to the rest of the car. Okay I got my insulation. Painting. Drill to drill the hole because for the handle the one I had is damaged. We need some more cement. Anyway so and some fittings for the house. More iron and more iron. Okay it's time to do the gendle. I got the steam going to the house. I got a few of those links. I'm going to make the gendle myself. Okay. See how we go. I'm going to use the edge of the door as a guide to cut everything and dig into it. Let's do that. I'm going to do this internal wall. Of course I need those gendle really for him so he can locate the last metal side in the right position here for the door. The left side is already gone. This one here. We need to get the other one there. I think that's pretty nice and square. Very good. Actually I don't mind the run. I love it. It turns out a tank and I love the sound of it. With the weather like that though, you're out of being bad. With all due respect with your loved one. Thank you. I'm going to use the edge of the door. I'm going to use the edge of the door.

SCHOOL We forgot to cut that house. So the water's still coming here. But that thing's gonna work. Okay. We've got a little bend there. We can make some retucity, but it's coming down now. Yes, sir. Yes. What's the cause? After the cause? It's gonna take out the mud there. Oh, yes, after the timber is off, the water will cycle out properly. Yeah, because it's still cloudy here. Damn it. It's not running too early. Anyway, it'll work. Yeah, need to take the timber off. I need an extension, but it's really heat. I don't even know where the hell are you with me. Maybe it's washing the car today, I don't know. Honestly, I could have 20 of those. They would be fierce. I'm serious. It's amazing. They're not gonna water coming down. Look at the overflow. Look at the overflow. Okay. It's okay. Lucky I got this trench. Yeah, no. Yeah, no. I'm happy to see this water coming out there, because now I know what to do. I need to get this water to go away for some way. That's okay. I need to make some kind of data system to run to the back of the house, or at least to the trench there, in the side of the house. So anyway, it's good. We can re-know what to do now. I need to find an extension to work on that girl camera. I can't believe we just made a little trench for the water to go away around the house there, and out back at the back. Oh, is the boss? I'm gonna get this water. I'm gonna get this water. I'm gonna get this water. Okay, I got one length done. Straight. Okay, I just about to have an attempt on making the groove all along the step, I mean, for the door. But Bella is not already well, so I need to go to the next barangay to buy some medication for Bella. Okay, well, I want to buy medication. The guy has been installing those water lines. I never thought that was so flexible like that. Anyway, that's okay. I will put a couple of metal clamp after. Just for now. Yeah, I need to do it. I will do that. I need to bring the water here. Go there. Yeah, it's okay. That's okay. T-Shap, I put a clamp. No problem. No, it'll be okay. I'll have the next drop piece of timber. Shirt went out. Two. I got more here. Yeah. I got two more pipes there. No problem. I got plenty of fitting substances. So, just leave it there. It's okay. It's okay. Yeah, I will do some time when I'm free, I will do that. Excellent. And then there, you cut. Let's go back to my dough, John. Okay, this is a world first. I think it's looking pretty good, actually. All right, what do you think? Yeah. Okay. I'll just show you. I need to have a go at the top as well. Okay, we got one done almost. Just have to give a go here a little bit. Should have the thickness planner first, but we're learning. Okay, that was a good exercise, good experiment. I think we're going to get the thickness planner into the game tomorrow. That will be the best way. Okay, that's it for today guys. Let's pack up and go home. I only got a few steps to make to get home. Stand doing. Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay, thank you for watching this video. Until the next video. Take care, God bless. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
