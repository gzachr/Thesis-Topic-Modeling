 What is that? We have to bring the... We decided to bring Walgit to the doctor, we went to the clinic because he had no problem. He knows he's always coming out leaking and he has no sense of smell also. But the clinic we went, they said no, they don't do anything to do with nose and throat anymore because of the COVID. Only ear, but he doesn't have a ear problem, he only has a nose problem. So we're going to walk, we're going to try the hospital and see if they're going to... You know, allow him or they're going to check. If they don't, he just practice that sending home. Yeah. Anything you want to say to him? Oh he wants to talk. What do you want to say? Come here. What do you want to say? Come on. Speak out. Oh my God. He's afraid of... He's shy in the camera. So Walgit has this problem, but think it's two years ago. Three years ago? Three years. Yeah, it's been three years ago that it's having... He has this problem and we already bring him to the clinic before. It's about... I think two times already, the... Give him the description. It's like he's praying in the nose, but then it's not really helping him. And the doctor said also that we may need a surgery for him, but have his kind of afraid of that. He does it one. Walgit to suffer surgery. So we just, you know, tell to the doctor if he can give us the medicine for his nose. So yeah, the doctor gave me the medicine and then we tried that a couple of times and then we buy another medicine like it's free. Because the doctor said he has a polyps, something in the nose. So yeah, he's been suffering in this one. So we decide today that we bring him to the clinic, but then the clinic is kind of afraid about that. So we get to try having one of the doctors with us, hopefully. The Wilok ship. So yeah, that's about it guys. So we let him know little what's happened. Oh, guys, put there. Okay. You can use the problem that you come here. Okay, so this is the Manila Dr. Hospital. Right here. This is the Lila Dr. Hospital. Yeah. We are at the mall. Hello, Edson. Hello Edson. So how you feel?

And one of the studios. What is that drink? That's a wine. It's hot. It is hot. Yeah, it's a big table. So, he ate the rice and still hot. So, I think it's spicy. Maybe because you eat the wine. The wine people. A big people. Yeah, it is spicy though. Why do people say spicy? Just be careful. Just be careful. We are done. Alright, let's continue our topics. It must be happy coming out of the house. Yeah, it's a lot of kids, you know. I can't believe how so many kids in this world. Just in this world, you know. So, I mean, it's hot. First we went.

So, hopefully right after that we'll take him to the hospital. For his check up. Yeah, so let's see what the doctor says. And that hospital, it's only one doctor, who likes to check the nose. Some of that, it's, you know, except, you know, except, you know, except, you know. Why are they scared? Yeah. They can use gloves. Of course they use precaution. They should be vaccinated. Of course. They can wear a wool, wool clothing, whatever. Like maybe because they just are very, very careful. Yeah, but generally they say kids are not infected with the design. Generally. That's why they're not pushing them for that vaccination. Because they care. I can understand what the majority of us are. For years. Well, I said, throw that. Don't eat that. None of them need that green. Hope you guys can help us because you know guys is very, very, very, it's open now. So welcome to the Philippines again. This is how, you know, Filipino, how noisy. Very, very, especially when you are with the kids. And tomorrow we'll be here again. Yeah. The sisters want to eat this. Yeah, tomorrow we are coming here again because JJ is going to have a vaccine. Oh yeah, he's going to bring a little sister. Yeah. He's going to have a vaccine later. Yeah, because he's going to gain. Yeah, she's the only one that doesn't have a vaccine yet. Because we are just 10 out of the half yet. Yeah. He's still 11 years old and I don't want him to have a super now. So yeah, well, JJ, we need to get her a vaccine because we're planning to go somewhere. Yeah, if you're proud of it. If you're not vaccinated, you need a swap test. Yeah. Almost 4000, you know, going and coming and being for it. It's a lot of hassle if you're if you're trying to be able to have a vaccination. That's a huge way. Each time going one way or another. So it's better if you're if you're going to struggle, at least you're going to get a vaccine first. Right? It's like it's less hassle for you. No. It's like it's a hassle so quarantine, you know? Right, Jenna? No, you don't need quarantine but you need a swap test. You need a vaccine negative. Oh, it's same. But the swap test is a possible. Each time you go somewhere, once you have vaccinated, like pooling, vaccinated, zero need no swap test anymore. Traveling, domestic. But like it said, you know, we're we're going to travel. But you know, for her we're going to need swap test so far. The next step. Yep. You know when the government gives you a different vaccination. Yeah, the government here in the Philippines are giving free vaccination. And they're also giving a thing to swap test. I don't know, I heard some. Anti-gine, now I'm in the other team. I see.
