Are you ready to eat? Yay.
This is our first day in Bohol
We came here yesterday
We took the ferry from Cebu City.
Yeaaah, we can eat
And it was easy to buy the tickets
directly on the spot. Yeah.
two hours ride
Really convenient.
We are going to visit the city
It's really interesting, there is many food here
Really big and really beautiful
and of course
doing Lyn's favorite activities
It's so beautiful
We don't know much about Bohol Island
but we have some idea of some food we must try here like
Halang Halang. Yeah.
And also some sweet dessert. Yeah
They are really famous for.
I don't remember the name but
there are some ice cream I recall
so we are going to try to find them today.
And visit the historic part of Bohol too
Yeah and we will also try to eat everything that we
just appealing
Yeah, just intrigued by the food.
The sun is pretty strong
And there is not many shadow
And we are lucky actually because
it's a beautiful day. 
The the sun is right here so not complaining here
It's like 1 PM. So the sun yeah
No thank you.
We found this nice restaurant
Chicken Ati
The decor is super nice and we smelled the grilled chicken
It was smelling so good that we just wanted to try
So we ordered the specialty here, the chicken
and also the halang halang
So this, if I understood
is a specialty of Bohol
so we will try that
You happy?
Yeah super nice. It looks super delicious.
It smells so good too
I cannot wait to try this chicken.
Delicious?
Yeah. Really delicious.
Delicious.
How it tastes like?
It's kind of gravy
It's not like liquid soup
It's peppery
Little bit of spiciness too
And chicken flavour.
Which one is better?
The grilled chicken or the halang halang?
Both chicken are great
But I personally prefer the
grilled chicken
You should try this.
Chili?
You think I can eat it?
Is it spicy?
Spicy yeah
You got hiccup
It was delicious
We paid 453 pesos
We ate well
I really like the halang halang chicken.
It was like a comfort food
like home cooked food with some vegetable inside
I like it
This
kind of meal I can eat everyday with rice.
Easy to eat
But I was kind of surprise of the
gravy soup
I was expecting
something
more like a soup
that you can drink or something like this
but here it was more
gravy
More like a sauce
But it was delicious.
So now we are heading to the part where there is
beautiful buildings and historic
And we will also try more food. Yeah.
I'm still hungry
I need a dessert
And a drink
because it's really hot. Yeah.
Let's find this
Look at that.
Dan Lyn store
Wow, look at that
We have a store here
Dan Lyn
And it spelling correctly
Ah this is like a grocery
shop
Big announcement guys
We have a store here
The area we're heading now
is around
Poblacion 2 and Poblacion 3
and I really wonder how is it there?
It is not a touristy area but I think it will be interesting
Wow, I am quite impressed right now
It is actually
quite lively here
It is. There are so many shops around
And so many people
It's like
mid afternoon
2-3pm
Usually when the sun is that strong
people are inside
and just going to the restaurant or
staying in the mall
but here
it's lively even outside
Actually, it reminds me a little bit of
Colon Street in Cebu City
because it's super lively
maybe less people
There's a market also I think
There's also a shopping mall
BQ mall just in front of us
So yeah
Quite interesting
It is really interesting, there is many food here
so I can see there is fruit
and skewers
It looks nice
We'll come back here later.
Oh, look at that
We can see a beautiful church from here
Is it okay?
Not too hot?
No it's too hot
I just want to go back to the hotel
And have a shower
and change
to new clothes
But yeah, it's sunny, it's a beautiful day
Yeah, clear blue sky like that
So I'm really happy but
I forgot how
hard it is to be under the sun
and we tried to
like hand the umbrella but it's really hard
when we are filming.
So we just
juggling like
camera, umbrella, camera, umbrella, camera
So
I'm tired
And I'm so thirsty.
Woa, the church was really
impressive
Really big and really beautiful
And I have to say that the
churches that I've seen here in the Philippines
are all really beautiful
Yeah, I agree
They are always special. Oh yeah
I wonder what is the meaning of this flag.
It is just near the Philippines's flag
it's similar to the French flag
but there is some symbol on it
I'm really curious about the meaning
If one of you guys know
Comment below
So everybody
Can understand the meaning
We are now in front of the museum
And I think it's free. I'm not sure
So let's see
The museum was super interesting
We didn't film because it was forbidden
But it was allowed to take pictures
It explains a little bit the history of Bohol
How it was formed
and also the nature of this place
It was super nice
It was a nice break from the heat also
because you can have
you have the AC
And you learn something from Bohol
What you can see actually here. Yeah
We learn many things about the
Chocolate hills
Dolphins
It's not that big
If you take your time
you you will take around
30 minutes, 40 minutes
We read everything and it took like 1 hour
Really nice
Cheers
You know what is it?
This one is lemon I think
And this
I guess it's guba
Guyabano
What is it?
A fruit
Let's try
Oh yeah I really like it
It's lemon, sweet
And super fresh
And this is only 10 pesos?
Coconut I think
Coconut?
I don't know
It's super delicious
Yeah I think it's coconut
Milky coconut
I try this
Very good
I like this one. I prefer this one
This one is more refreshing
The lemon one
I will have more here
Woa, look at the view we got here
Just beautiful
How much for the ice cream?
1 for 80?
But I don't know what is the malunggay
One malunggay please
It's really special the taste
It's like
a mix of avocado
so this is the malunggay
we know it's like a specialty here
but we don't know what is it
Definitely Special. I never tried something like this one.
It reminds me of avocado but it's not avocado
It's melting everywhere.
It's really delicious. I like it
The biscuit looks different
Maybe corn chips?
The first time I try something like this for the ice cream
herby a little bit I don't
Yeah I think it's just a plant
It's a plant? yeah
It was really creamy
I don't know how we can eat this plant on other dish
We want to try more of
delicacies here in Bohol.
The atmosphere of the Buzz cafe is really nice too
There is a good ambience
with great music
and you can also have a bit of a view on the ocean
so super nice
Oh, we saw they serve halang halang here
Yeah. In here, it was more soup, I think.
And they also sell like jam
They have different product
different jam
Really nice restaurant.
Ooh what is that?
It's like a candy
But it's not
What is it?
Ah it's sugar
I don't know if it's a specialty of Bohol or not?
But we took a corn coffee.
Is the first time we saw something like this
so
we just wanted to try
I don't even know if there's corn inside
It's similar to black coffee so
Yes, similar to black coffee
and the smell too
Can you taste the corn?
No
Maybe it's better with the sugar
With the candy sugar
It's hard to open actually
What is the corn coffee then?
But I taste something different than the black coffee
But it's not the corn but I taste something like grilled
grilled meat inside
but maybe grilled coffee
We are now in Bread basket
and they sell different kind of bread
I think we can taste some kind of specialties here
and we've got 4 differents kind
Ube is
purple yam
I think this is
like a specialty here in Bohol
because there is a lot of varieties of Ube here
you have cake, but I think you have drink
you have other stuffs
so many Ube
and we learned that also before in the museum
so this is the doughnut, ube doughnut
Ube crispy doughnut
It looks crispy
So I think that maybe inside there is some
Ube
Ube paste
This is the torta
torta yeah
so
I just read that this is a specialty here in Bohol
But I really don't know what is it
and we got also this one
muffin
But this one is really special
because we just taste the ingredient before
in the ice cream
So it's a malunggay cake
So I'm really happy to find this one
because just earlier we were wondering
where we can find this ingredient
and here we found it
In total we paid 78 pesos for 4
But yeah which one you want to try first?
Maybe the
Muffin
Mm the first bite
Me?
Yeah, you
You can see it's green inside
I hope you can see it clearly
The taste is stronger than the ice cream

I want to try. I want to try
Oh yeah, this one is generous in Ube
Oh this one is so easy to eat
Oh we have another ube here

Taste like bread
Ah
There is something inside
It's really soft
Look at this
This is perfect for breakfast
We can buy for breakfast
Try the last one
This one is so beautiful
Oh yeah

All the cakes here are good.
It's not sweet
You can taste the ube
That's all
