Have I told you about the time
Louise got a tattoo from 101 year old lady?
Well, this is that lady, the legendary Whang Od
The last tattooist of her kind
Our journey starts on the bus in Bontoc
like literally
on
the bus
Then we arrived here...
Home to some of the most spectacular views I've ever seen
so we took a little time just to take it all in
But we weren't there yet, so we paid our bus fare
and hopped on a motorbike
After being liberated from our bikes
we met our local guide, Abdon
who had lead us on the final leg of our journey
to Whang Od's home village
Buscalan is tucked away in the mountains of Cordillera
in the province of Kalinga
The only way to reach the village is by foot
The local children help to bring food and drink
up to the village
They also bring the empty bottles back down
before cooling off in a nearby waterfall
Upon arrival in the village
you must sign in and register your name
for a tattoo from Whang Od
We finally arrived at Whang Od's house
but she was already busy at work around the corner
Whang Od is the last mambabatok of her generation
Mambabatok's are tattoo artists that use
a traditional hand tapping technique called Batok
The Kalingas are known to be the only tribe in the Cordillera's
who never surrendered to colonisation
thanks to their brave warriors
in those days only Kalinga warriors who had killed
an enemy in battle were rewarded with a tattoo
But Whang Od has since extended the privilege
to all who are willing to make the pilgrimage to see her
Whang odd tattoos about 20 to 30 people a day
with people coming from all over the world
to receive the honor
This left Louise with somewhat of a nervous wait
Whang Od has been training her grand nieces
Grace and Elyang since they were 10 years old
They use this hut to perfect their art
Grace and Elyang will continue Whang Od's legacy
and make sure this thousand year old tradition lives on
Back around the corner
Louise's turn had finally come
Batok tattoos use a mixture of soot and water
instead of ink
Whang Od uses a rice stalk
to mark the skin with her design
She uses a citrus thorn as a needle
and at a speed of a hundred taps a minute
she begins
Each tattoo design has its own meaning
Louise opted for the serpent eagle
which represents guidance, protection and courage
There are many designs to choose from
and if you can't decide,
Whang Od will choose the one she feels represents you best
Whang Od signs all her tattoos with her famous signature
three dots
To finish off
she applies coconut oil to the tattoo
which helps to heal the skin
Whang Od has a great sense of humour
So when I asked for a photo with her
it was no surprise when she did this...
I really don't seem to be minding too much eh?
After that strange turn of events.
It was Louise's sisters turn for a tattoo
The tattoos cost around 400 to 1,000 pesos each
that's about 10 to 20 US dollars
Louise thought that was too cheap
and tried to offer her some more
After a long day
we were treated to dinner
but not before our hostess showed us how to open a tin can
with just a spoon
The next morning
Louise and her sister woke up early
to receive another tattoo
this time from Elyang
Both sisters chose to have the 'standing eagle'
which represents strength and freedom
and that concludes our story
The time Louise got tattooed by a 101 year old lady
and her grand niece.
