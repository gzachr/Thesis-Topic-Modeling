good morning or good afternoon whereever you are so welcome
to a brand new episode here in the Philippines
and today begins a new adventure series
here in Moalboal So today we're doing something
very exciting so today we're doing Canyoneering yes canyoneering here at kawasan falls so we're with kawasan
canyoneering company and you can see we're
already dressed in our shoes already special
shoes for canyoneering to protect us from
the rocks and uh yeah to be honest just then
on the way here the drive the drive was driving
super fast like super fast super professional
professional too half the time I thought I
was in a
Fast and Furious movie it's like
I don't know so fast but anyway we made it
to the headquarters here and now I think we're
gonna get dressed and uh they said they're
gonna provide us with some helmets some life
jackets and now we've got shoes so we're ready
to go alright so from the main entrance
and we've got the counter here and alright
let's see and Alina is here and here I believe
it's like a changing room where the lockers
are and you can see we've got life jackets
here we've got helmets and they said they're
gonna provide us with a small water bag as
well got bottles of water
protect our phone yes special water case how
much is this guess this is 150 pesos
and this is our guy Louie as well very funny
guy but uh yeah this is a small water
bag for to keep our batteries today we can
jump with phone I can handle the pictures with
the phone awesome you can handle the GoPro yeah
awesome yeah so we're gonna put some like
extra floating device uh yeah that'd be awesome
you can yeah floating device oh yeah awesome
yeah we're really excited because it's our
first time doing canoneering as well and uh
we've done rafting before but canyoneering is
something a whole new different level I think
because it involves lots of jumping and uh
clip we say cliff diving is it what's it called
yeah Cliff jump cliff jumping so uh very exciting
stuff Louie said it's optional the jumping
if you don't want to do it we'll just push
you there yeah it looks cool I think knock
knock alright ladies first oh alright the top
down one [Applause] are you ready? No [Laughter]
but uh Louis actually said the tallest dive
jump is 10 meters yeah 10 meters oh my goodness
10 meters that's like three to four floors High pretty much so uh yeah not too sure
but I think I can do it I think I can do it
put it under your legs oh yeah but be sure
to close your legs while jumping because it's
really dangerous for our precious
alright so now time to take a group picture
just me Alina pre- jump
for the duration for the canineering will
be three to four hours depending on your
pace and before the canineering starts you
will first trek 30 to 45 minutes from the entrance
going down to the first jump however if you
want extra Adventure there is also zip line
available there zip line is one kilometer
ride for one minute and you will only track
five to ten minutes near to the first jump
step 
alright
Adventure careful  I'm so ready I'm
so ready. When we go to jump to jump how you will jump 
like no I just I just I think I'll just yolo
and jump let's see let's see that's me I think
that's me always when it comes to like thrilling activities I always go first I think
I'll be the first one yeah YOLO you only live
once YOLO how do you say let's go in Filipino. Tana!
sounds Japanese. Tana!
let's go to what? to the Moon
what does that mean? wow so nice
yeah
I first time like this. hold on to dear life hold on to your life. Hold me hold me
 
[Music] what song are you singing
beautiful wife what Beautiful in white beautiful
in life ah make a wedding song or like a dress
ah keep singing I want to hear. I dont know the lyrics
okay salamat salamat alright wow so many
people yeah
okay it's like a meeting point here wow so
many people
Adventures will be 4 hours but it depends how many pictures
you will take so let out Adventures for this
canyoneering begins so there are two options
for you to get to the waterfall so one is
ziplining so I believe you have to pay extra
for zip lining and alternatively you could
be like us and just start walking to the where
the starting point is but I just then I sort
of zip lining how to do it it's like Superman
like lying down yeah lying down so it's quite
funny because I've done a lot of zip lining
but it's only sitting down oh this reminds
me of Bali it reminds me of um the the sidewalk
in ubud actually you remember huh what's
that what called we just called it sidewalk yeah
I'm not sure you guys can see but uh zip lining
takes one minute to get to that small Hut
right there but we're walking around 45 minutes
but uh yeah I think walking is actually a
good idea because once you sweat and you jump
into the ice cold water it'll be a great feeling
I think
Guide: "Make sure to film you slip"
sliding down alright guys if you see that
blue and greenish water looks amazing oh so
beautiful my goodness so beautiful wow slippery tho
watch out baby first time seeing river water
like this I mean River color the strap the
straps put it under your legs
It is your first time guys? Don't worry it is also my first time
alright guys I need your energy are you
guys ready yes alright let's do it alright
let's do it. Let's bring home the longanisa, alright lets do it
so here be careful when you step on the rock
because a lot of rocks are moving 
okay it's called living rocks are you ready. You want to go first? No. Alright I will go first then
wow so cold. go justin. wow so nice.I'm just sit here 
it's so nice water is a super ice cold here
which is so refreshing after a long walk just

yeah it's like moonwalk you don't need to
walk but the river gets you to the other side
anyway but I really really love the landscape
here canyoneering wow one of the best experience
I've been I think one of the best yeah I think
so one of the most fun experience ever in
our lives I think 
yeah definitely one of our favorite moments
in our life and will forever remember this yeah definitely
yeah good memories together
Smell bbq somewhere. I want to eat I am so hungry
Notice how the current is in spiral that will push you back to the rock if you don't jump further enough
Alina was super worried
Very strong current that pulls me away
The spiral current pushed alina towards the rock while the strong current from above pushed her under the water
I tried to swim towards her but I could not
but luckily someone else jumped down and pulled her out from the water
Alina recalled," I couldn't breathe, I panicked and felt like it was my last day in this life"
Alina was traumatised and in shock
As you can see very very fast current so you want to be very careful
[Music]
Wow very strong current
The current was so strong even I couldn't withstand it
like you're challenging yourself and you're
doing so well so proud of you

know yeah you have this moment I have I actually
have yeah I have Alina just then as you guys can
see she almost got washed away oh and uh because
I think she didn't jump further enough and
then the current brought her back to like
the rocks and she got um so from the top the
waterfall was hitting like her head so it
pushed her down but at the same time he's
also bringing her closer to the rocks crazy
working with so many like small wobbly rocks
