 But you're Friday. The freshest. Can Filipinos really sing? Of course, mate. Yes, of course they can. But that's the title of the video. All right. Of course they can. I don't know. I don't know why this song, what this video has been recommended. 90% of them. I'm pretty sure. I'm pretty sure. The other 10%, they're probably good at other stuff. But this guy's from, actually, Graham K. Jill. He decided to actually go on the quest himself and ask people, random people in the Philippines to just sing. Awesome. A bloody good idea. And to really find out if they can really sing or not. If it's a myth, a legend or reality. Not myth, mate. I'm pretty sure we're about to be blown away. You're not watching. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
