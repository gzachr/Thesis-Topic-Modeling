That is very flavorful.
In this episode, we're going to a fine dining
Filipino restaurant.
I brought a good friend of mine from Sweden.
His name is Sebastian
and he sure knows how to dress the part for
fine dining restaurants.
I'm really liking Brussels so far, very charming.
A lot of old-looking houses, but like in a
historical kind of way,
like even the patios.
Sebastian: And it looks like that--it's really beautiful.
It's a very quaint neighborhood. A lot of, like, hipster-looking.
Is that a bar?
Maybe.
I could live here.
This is like the first 15 minutes I'm already
overreacting,
but it's so pretty.
So we decided to walk around the city first,
try a bunch of touristy stuff.
Brussels is amazing.
It's very multicultural.
You can see it around you.
There's a lot of Dutch people, French people,
a lot of Flemish, and a lot of expats, too.
Holy shit. It's made of gold.
Holy crap.
What is this place!?
So we went to one of the oldest restaurants
here in Brussels called Chez Leon.
We got the moules-frites, which is the national dish here in Brussels,
along with some Belgian beer, of course.
That was really good.
So the restaurant we're going to is fine dining.
It's a little bit fancy
so me and Sebastian decided to do some ukay-ukay
to find me a suit jacket. 
Oh, wow. It's perfect.
Looks good, man.
I got my haul now.
So this is Humphrey.
This is their Filipino menu.
You get a seven-course meal.
Look how beautiful this place is.
Sebastian eating chicharon casually.
The crunch?
It's so good. 
The fanciest chicharon I've seen in my life.
So, per usual with these fine dining places,
the portions are kind of small, but they're
very, very flavorful.
They're using a bunch of familiar flavors
that are Filipino-ish,
but it's really, really good.
You can see that there's mussels again.
Tahong, it's the national dish, baby.
That lumpia is the best lumpia I've ever had in my life.
That was like an explosion of flavor
in your mouth.
That's very flavorful.
And it's just a spring roll, right? And it's so incredible.
How is it?
Try the patis.
Sebastian: The patis?
The patis is this right here.
Be careful, though, because that's super salty.
So either you put it on the fish, yeah, just
a little bit so it adds flavor to it, because
right now it's kind of like, you know, very
bland, right?
Just let me know. That might be too intense.
A little bit of that, too, to bounce it out.
Sebastian: Wow. What a change.
It's intense, right?
Sebastian: Yeah.
What is that?
Sebastian: The patis.
Your new best friend.
We finished everything so fast.
What can you say about it?
I hope there's more but if that is it, oh, my God.
Sebastian: If this is it, I'm happy.
Sebastian: Happy.
Man. That was incredible.
That was incredible.
We already checked out, it's the final day.
You can see Sebastian taking pictures of the
apartment for the last day.
Yeah, we're gonna bounce.
We're going to check out one more place, though,
before we go.
There's this cafe that's also Filipino.
Gonna go to that right now.
On the way to the airport, we actually stumbled
upon this coffee shop. And it's Filipino!
It's called Good Phil.
Very nice outside seating.
Just sit around, hang out, order your coffee
super nice.
And yeah, they're serving longganisa bowls.
That was such a pleasant surprise.
We were super excited.
That was Jude.
He's running the place.
So good.
Thank you, Jude.
Jude: Welcome to Brussels!
Welcome to Brussels.
Thank you, Jude.
How was your trip?
Sebastian: So good, man.
Sebastian: So good.
One of the better ones.
Excited go back?
Sebastian: No.
Copenhagen vibes!
The biggest city boy.
