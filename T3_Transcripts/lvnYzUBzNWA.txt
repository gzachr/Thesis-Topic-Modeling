 I just got to say this about last night. What about last night? This is surreal right now, standing here in Tanghub City on New Year's Eve morning and seeing nobody. Last night, there were so many people, we couldn't even move our arms, but now! So much faith! Alright, just watch this, this is what happened here last night. Last Christmas, I gave you my heart, but the very next day you gave it away. This year, to save you from tears, I'll give it to someone special. I'll give it, I'll give it, I'll give it to someone special. I'll give it, I'll give it, I'll give it to someone special. I'll give it to someone special. Hey! Hey! I managed to find the best flight in Tanghub City! We made it to the Christmas chain, that's all that matters. If you come to Tanghub City during the Cipa Festival, you'll have to ride the chain. You're going to have to ride the chain. I'll be back in 10 minutes! Okay, I'll be back in 10 minutes! I gotta go! I'm sorry! Alright, let's go! Alright, let's go! Alright, let's go! I'm going to go with my soul! Oh! I don't like this one! You have to marry me in 10 minutes! I don't like the one. I don't like it! But if you kiss me now I'll know you'll follow me again. Okay, so, it's really inspiring. I've been in a tank of many times. Obviously, I never really want to show that kind of stuff on video. But I guess it's a good time to show you guys how. It's difficult for me now, sometimes to make videos especially in places like this. Because of that. I'll give it. I'll give it so much better. I'll give it. I'll give it. I'll give it so much better. This is an exciting moment in my life. I'm finally going to the Bion volcano. Yes. Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? Are you ready? About time ago. Yes. There it is. Wow. I always want to go to my volcano. And finally, we're here. Dungeon. How do you think of it? I've always wanted to go there. Is this the one that's on the bank? Oh, amazing. It's 100 pesos back. No, that's the mind volcano. Education for the day. I'm going to keep moving now. I'm going to keep moving. I'm going to keep moving. That one's really cool. I don't know what that one is. Yes, I'm going to keep moving. I'm going to keep moving. I'm going to keep moving. I'm going to keep moving. I'm going to keep moving. Okay, I tried to film, but we're going to take photos. The rain is actually taking over the end of the finish. That's the border we go up to mountain. See how it turns out. Holy, it's not beginning to fall. We don't want to kill Cindy right now. We'll walk up there and blast you as leaders. I'm sorry, bro. It's okay. He couldn't. That was broke Cindy there. We had to evacuate the flat. It's right right at the V-decker truck in the hole. Woo! Sure, it's the infinity pool, ginger. I think it's more of a disco dance pool. Sure, it's the New Year's Eve moves, run. Michael Jackson. It was beautiful dance floor in the world, run. Everyone left, but I couldn't stop staying up here. It's clear and beautiful again. This place is insanely beautiful. It's so amazing. It's so beautiful. It's so beautiful. It's so beautiful. It's so beautiful. It's so beautiful. It's so beautiful. It's so beautiful. Finn, how's it going? Pretty good. Enjoy your mango block. It's so good. Where's my mango foot? Up here, my Finn does other work to make you guys see good video clips. It's so beautiful. It's amazing. Don't ever waste mango float. That's a sin. That could be one of those beautiful rainbows. It's a pine tree fog clouds rainbow. There's no lamp filming going down this hill. This is such a cool place. This is where we did the wooden scooter race before. Woo!
