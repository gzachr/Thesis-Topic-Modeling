Happy birthday. Thank you. Today's your birthday? Yes, sir.
Yeah, buddy.
Alright, so today we're going to go camping.
We're going to go to Vanilla.
With my friends. They're from Bais.
I'm going to take this with me.
What's your name?
Dawin.
Here you go.
I got it.
Babe.
Where are we?
We're back at Mercedes.
Mercedes' house.
Mercedes' place. I'm braiding my hair.
We're back in Bais.
Nice.

Yeah, so we're back here because it is
Armin's
birthday. So our plan was to go to
camping. I'm not sure where we're going to do that.
I don't even think. He's short.
It's going to be a spontaneous trip.
Here with the crew.
It's going to be a good time.
Stay tuned. How are you, aunt?
How are you?
My aunt is the best at cooking
chocolate.
She's better than me. Yes, she's better
than Zoe cooking chocolate.
Thank you.
Oh wow, that's really green.
Are you sure that's not part of the party?
There's a little ant in there.
It's okay. It's a couple of ants.
What is that? Green.
Whoa, it's so green. Green honey.
Must be healthy. With a couple of ants.
I'll just get the non-ant side. Just go for it.
That's so weird. Green honey.
Tasty. It's got like a mint flavor.
I think it's Colgate.
It's minty.
It tastes like lollies.
It's just like a candy.
It's healthy, Max.
Yeah, Max is healthy.
He's giving the ants up.
Zoe.
What's up, man?

Happy birthday

As long as it's my birthday.
What's this? Spaghetti?
Bread.
For a long life.
Should have pasta.
Oh, all right.
We survived last night.
It was
raining.
I guess I didn't really vlog too much yesterday
after we had some lunch. I'm sorry.
So I'll fill you in.
Basically, we had some lunch. We listened to some
music. We had fun
with On's birthday.
Just kind of, just chilling.
Yes, so
I didn't get a, or I filmed it.
This is me eating pig's brain. It's
not too bad. Tastes like balut.
They were trying to convince Zoe to
eat it because they said it was as good as
balut, but she hates balut, so she did not try it.
Right?
Right, and you saw my Instagram post?
Kind of rainy all night. Here's our set up.
We slept in here.
Keith slept in a hammock over here.
You got rained on.
Rainy night. Rainy night.
Yeah, he transferred to the truck.
But yes, morning.
We're gonna
get some brekkie
and then...
So we're gonna
head back to
Dumaguete after this, so...
Oh, we're still going to Tanai?
Oh, alright.
The adventure continues.
Update, what's going on?
Dogs!
Yes.
There's so many dogs.
We're at the Tanai bear's house, and he has
dogs.
Zoe living her best
life.
Alright, so we finished up here at
Mayor's house. It was awesome.
It was awesome.

It was awesome. Zoe was saving the dogs
and killed the tick, but
all the ticks of juice is on me now.
That was a juicy tick.
It was so gross. I picked it up and then I squished it
with a rock and it just went...
But now we are gonna go do a Boodle fight, right?

The people that need to be quarantined.
So the government

in the government
they cooked and prepared
for the quarantines.
