A guide to survival in the forest. Author: vietnam
Due to the acrid smoke, people quickly left Angeles and San Fernando.
According to some reports, people are dying from the forest fires
and then rising as zombies.
This is the first recorded case of a person becoming 
a zombie without being bitten by another zombie.
Eyewitnesses report the formation of zombie hordes heading south.
The army is creating defense lines. 
The first one is along the Pasig River in Manila.
The second one is in a narrow bottleneck
 where forests are being cut down and fortifications are being built.
Artillery is deployed on Alabat Island to cover the defenders.
During this difficult time, 2 million people volunteered to join the army
strengthening the military forces in the region 
and allowing for more effective resistance against the growing number of zombies.
To control the movement of people between islands in the region, the US military fleet has arrived.
Several warships have entered Manila Bay to support the defenders.
