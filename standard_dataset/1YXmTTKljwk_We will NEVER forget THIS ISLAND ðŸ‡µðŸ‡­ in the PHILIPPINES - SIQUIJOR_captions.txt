we have been traveling the Philippines now
for around two and a half to three weeks and
we have been searching for that perfect Island
that we can just relax on and catch up on
all of our editing and all of our working
we finally come across sticky horror this
is one of those islands that we could see
ourselves spending a lot of time on and we
cannot wait to show you around
[Music] good morning everybody and welcome
to Siquijor Island here in the Philippines
we've actually been here about five days already
um not been able to do much because unfortunately
Andrew split his head open in a cave I managed
to smack my head on the top of a cave bleeding
a little bit so he's got us some herbal medicine
it's called hagonoi
thank you
go check out Instagram if you want to follow
that story it was pretty interesting but we're
here now we're ready to explore we've got
quite a bit to do today weather's brightening
up a little bit first order of the day though
is obviously to try and find some breakfast
and we know a nice local place called Annabelle's
where we're gonna go and find some Tosilog
I forgot to mention before we go for breakfast
is some chores for the day we've actually
got a load of laundry to do I think it's been
about a week since we've done it and we are
running really low so true Philippine style
it's just started chucking it down
who it is guys hello she's following us like
a bad smell
so once again this is tapsilog which is garlic
fried rice you get fried egg and you get beef
tapa it's like the most traditional Filipino
breakfast that there is It's Quickly becoming
one of my favorite breakfasts here just delicious
it's like sweet salty garlicky so so good
and we've got some fresh chilies and a fresh
Chili
okay so breakfast is finished it was absolutely
delicious really really cheap um now we're
gonna jump back on the bike go and drop off
our laundry and then head over to palaton
beach okay so laundry's all done that cost
us 180 pesos they do have a minimum of three
kilos here um at ameliana's laundry service
but the lady is super friendly yes
yeah bye [Music]
so we rented a sup board for the next two
hours and we're all gonna have a little turn
there are a lot of sea urchins on this beach
so we're just gonna paddle board out to the
deeper water for a little bit hopefully the
rain stays away but I'm super super excited
about this it's been a while
see you later
foreign
it is hot we've just absolutely covered ourselves
in Sun cream and we just picked up a couple
of fresh bucco or coconuts these things are
really good really really sweet um we might
try and get the guy to cut them open once
we finish drinking them these were 60 pesos
each which is like one pound maybe a little
bit less really good really refreshing and
yeah it doesn't come with much of a better
view than this really
so along this beach we have seen so many people
snorkeling in the water finding sea urchins
uh I've obviously I've had these before in
Japan I've not had them in the Philippines
it seems to be a different species the ones
that we've had in Japan before so me chilly
and even Liam this time are gonna try these
uh these urchins from what I can tell the
guy said 10 pesos each which is a really really
good price um so we've got a spoon we're gonna
just eat a couple of urgents [Music] foreign
we have just been shown the local way to eat
these apparently they don't even use a spoon
they use the back of their thumb and they
scrape all the meat down into the middle like
that
and then pour it into the hand and then just
mess it up really good really creamy nice
and sweet you said don't put your lips to
the edge in itself because it will make your
lips bigger I presume because it's sting you
make them swell really tasty I actually prefer
it with all the vinegar just add that one
without the vinegar and it's really really
sweet yeah yeah you can taste the edge and
more without the vinegar we have just figured
out what it tastes like exactly I don't know
if any of you have tried fresh cockles not
the Pickled ones you get in jars like fresh
fresh cockles it tastes just like those um
except they're not gritty and Sandy like cockles
can be if you don't purge them first really
delicious I think so far we've eaten quite
a lot of them
we're gonna have a couple more yeah we're
gonna have a couple more pay off and then
go and relax back on the beach it's got my
coconut open so I'm gonna eat the rest of
that as well
it's actually more mild than a full it's the
chili sauce that gives it the most flavor
I'd say very creamy let's have another little
go being Really Brave here
um like salty yeah yeah nice salty interesting
yeah you first ever see engine out of 10.
they give that a seven it's actually not as
bad as I thought I thought it'd be much sweeter
but um I think because I absolutely doused
it in sauce but yeah definitely not as bad
as I thought at all
orange more salt coming through now I'm definitely
more salty beautiful view so we've had a really
really nice day just relaxing and chilling
on the beach um I'm gonna head back towards
our hostel soon and uh yeah we'll see you
there [Music]
good morning everybody and welcome to cap
nod guest house we were staying a little bit
further down the road but it was pretty noisy
at night so we've decided to come to this
place and what a gem it is amazing come and
have a look
firstly Welcome to our own kitchen we have
a gas stove sink places for pots and pans
and then the room so first we have the bathroom
which is probably three times the size of
the last one
we then have space for clothes our own huge
fridge it's massive air conditioning a big
bed which is pretty comfy actually beautiful
Swan design with the towels but the best thing
about this place is probably the balcony this
is our balcony we have a hammock we've got
a little seating area for Andrew to do the
blogs and the sea is right there already we
know that we love it in this place so we have
the second we checked in extended for an extra
three nights laughs foreign
[Music]
[Music]
good morning guys today obviously is the first
day that I had the stitches out my head in
the past five days and the first thing we
are doing is heading straight back to the
waterfall in which I hit my head to go back
on the rope swing because it was absolutely
amazing and yeah I think it's gonna be a good
day we're back right
so excuse the fact that I am absolutely soaking
already I jumped in the water before we started
filming we've come to Lagann Falls I think
that's how it's pronounced um it's about 20
minutes away from San Juan we love this place
and we can't wait to get back in the water
[Music]
foreign
[Music] [Applause] [Music]
[Music]
[Music] bad time
[Music] so we've just finished off here at
Lagoon Falls we're about to go head out and
try and find some breakfast and a cup of coffee
because we've not eaten yet uh whilst I was
taking pictures of Leon just sitting along
this wall here uh there was like a huge show
of Dr fish just nibbling at my toes quite
graspy you know they proper get in there um
I've got some footage so here they are and
yeah it's a really cool place really glad
we stumbled across this the other day even
if I did slip my head open we're going to
get some food because we're all starving I've
got a dry t-shirt yeah always one step ahead
it's not like us
so we've come to a little place called Marco
Polo it's right on the beach as you can see
it is beautiful it is the most beautiful day

really good pasta pizza things like that we've
got a super friendly cat as well and but the
coffee here is pretty good so chili and Andrew

of tea
good afternoon again guys so obviously we
went to the waterfalls this morning we then
stopped off at Marco Polo for a quick cup
of coffee and some breakfast uh on the way
back I got my haircut and we have stopped
off grabbed two big bangus fish which I have
already filleted scaled and boned and we're
about to go and prep all the veg now because
we're having a barbecue on the beachfront
later this evening
so this salad is going to consist mainly of
cucumbers Peppers radish garlic tomatoes and
calamansi which is like a cross between a
lime and an orange we're hoping it turns out
nice also this knife is the bluntest knife
I've ever used in my life barely cuts through
a pepper but make do with what you've got
tomatoes
so into this I'm also going to add probably
one clove of garlic and three calamansi juice
we've actually got four pineapple in there
as well I might add some pineapple into this
but most of the pineapple is going to be put
onto skewers to go straight onto the barbecue
a bit of parsley just for color and that is
our beautiful salad done next we are getting
on with the pineapple and aubergine skewers

or eggplants for our people across the pond
