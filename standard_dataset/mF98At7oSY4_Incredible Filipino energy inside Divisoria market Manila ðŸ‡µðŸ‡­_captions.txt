today my nanay and tatay are going to try 
escabeche i hope my parents will really like  
this dish from the Philippines we're going to fry 
a nice piece of fish i have some flour here as  
well as a filipino beer that will be for our beer 
batter so i'm going to add this beer and whisk it  
i like this beer batter a little bit on the 
thick side we'll add quite a bit of salt
and there we go that's our batter for the 
fish Pogi is just relaxing there Pogi say  
hello to everyone we're going to use cod today 
i know many of you would use a whole fish with  
bones and everything but i'm not sure if my mom 
would really like the fish with the bones so  
i'm gonna stick with the filet today we'll be 
adding this fish to the batter let's fry these
i guess the origin of this dish is also 
from Spain is it not next is the pina
yeah i prefer using the fresh one for this
there we go
i wanted to cook a little bit healthier dish for 
my parents today after a lot of baboy dishes now  
also please let me know in the comments how 
you would make escabeche and also what fish  
you use and i wonder if there are 
different regions in the Philippines  
where they make a different style of escabeche
bell pepper finally the sauce so i'm 
adding a little bit of water first  
white vinegar soy sauce ketchup
brown sugar oyster sauce
oh it smells so good
smells amazing finally the fresh 
pineapple and the fried fish

Philippines it's a sweet and sour fish escabeche
