yes Philippines we are back welcome 
back to the Philippines [Music]  
and after spending over four months in 
the Philippines back in 2022 I don't  
know what it is but I love it we have 
missed the incredible Filipino energy
the enticing Street Food  
and just the most incredible places 
we have ever been to this is crazy
it's so exciting to finally be 
back in Manila Where it All Began  
let's go exploring welcome to the Philippines
I can't actually believe that we are back after 
a full year of being away and in every single  
country that we've been to we've met the most 
incredible Filipinos that have told us you have to  
come back to the Philippines you have to do season 
two so we're back we had the most insane four  
months here we went to the islands the cities we 
had incredible food so we're going to start today  
here in Rizal Park right next to the beautiful 
Rizal Monument Jose Riza was a nationalist a  
writer and a hero here in the Philippines and I 
think it is a perfect place for us to start today  
we're going to go out we're going to explore 
and one thing that we miss the most is the  
incredible Filipino street food so we're gonna 
go and find that but we need to find some way to  
get there hello do you know where Kyoko Market 
is you don't know do you know the kiapo market  
you know I think it's this way yes you can take 
a jeepney yes if we walk this way or this way

excited so our goal for today is we want to 
get to kirper Market which we heard there is
