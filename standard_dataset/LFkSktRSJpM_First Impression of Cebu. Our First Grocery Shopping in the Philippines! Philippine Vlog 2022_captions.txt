good morning or good afternoon wherever you 
are and welcome to a new production series  
here in Cebu so we arrived in Cebu yesterday and 
it's super exciting because finally daytime  
because night time we couldn't see anything but 
as you can see we have big loads of laundry and  
this is probably our whole wardrobe of our in 
our luggage so so super heavy but I'm carrying  
all in one backpack and I don't feel my arms 
anymore because I don't feel the blood flowing  
in so heavy but anyway it's okay that's okay baby 
anyway we heading to our laundry place and it's  
around five minutes away and then after that oh 
someone close close our way out anyway this is  
Cebu so you can see it's not so much different 
from Manila at first impression because you  
can see many cars many motorbikes as well but 
the only thing is I'm not seeing any jeepney  
I'm actually not to sure if you guys can hear
me because it's to go out here with all  
the traffics but anyway we're slowly walking to 
our laundry place and then after that we'll keep  
walking and we're gonna find some groceries 
because we've actually got a permanent place  
now here in cebu so we'll be staying here for 
one month we need to buy some groceries to stock  
up our our kitchen so anyway without further ado
let's head over to the laundry wow I keep giving  
this so what's different about this in Manila 
what do you think more or less the same yeah
yeah traffic's okay. I think I can drive bike here, you think you can 
drive motorbike here but yeah I for me I feel like  
it's more or less the same more or less the same 
many cars maybe more more motorbikes here maybe  
more motorbikes here and I guess last night when 
I was walking when I buy food last night I noticed  
there are many Angkas Angkas bike yeah remember the 
ride sharing app there are many many yeah like  
a taxi so here in here in Cebu there are many 
Angkas so Angkas if you guys don't know it  
already it's a ride sharing app specifically 
like motorbikes whoa what's going on here
crazy crazy and here in uh cebu or manila the philippines
I like driving bike, I want driving bike instead of walking yeah?
instead of walking yeah walking because now we're 
walking for five to twenty minutes and many of  
you have warned me already many of you have warned me. Laundry is here
ah it's here under sam samyupsal oh it's a Korean. No it's samgyupsal
so you guys don't know a bit of an introduction 
so Alina actually lived in Korea for two years  
no not two years oh really one year oh whoops oh 
well now you know anyway so alina  
has lived in Korea for one year 
as a model before yeah and I know  
a little bit Korean language and your 
favorite cut of meat in Korea salchisal
yep here laundry self served
washer so this is the price 
and drop off means drop off sir  
oh and then you you'll help us with everything all
of it okay I see so what how so peso 40 per load  
yeah oh I see so we just tell you like regular 
or something and then you can help us drop off  
plus 40 like a peso okay it makes sense yeah. Just come back 5pm.
Come back 5pm? yeah sure
we live around here so it'll be easier yeah. I am going to put your name
Justin right? Yes Justin. and spelling? Yes perfect. thank you. See you later
alright so that's one thing taking off our 
list so laundry is ready laundry is ready so  
because we have a big load of clothes just then so it's 235 pesos which is around  
so this is the thing we've been calculating 
converting a lot of currencies because we travel  
a lot so we went to you know Thailand recently 
so we've always used Thai baht as a reference  
and also went to Indonesia as well yeah but for 
me I no need conversion  
because Russian money is exactly the same
like a Filipino money yes it's very easy for 
you yeah then for me oh but I don't know how  
it is in dollar only in Russia I know guess it's okay 
price for laundry you think so yeah okay yeah  
she uh also next time we can wash by ourselves 
yeah but today we need to go to market exactly  
because I'm so hungry today morning we have 
so bad situation with food Panda we ordered food
but they only bring us half the food. exactly
that's the thing about food panda because food panda you know 
normally for service customers always right but  
food panda is always the seller is always right 
even though if for example just then we ordered  
chicken with rice and it's a whole chicken with 
two rice we ordered but then they only send us  
the chicken with no rice and we said wait wait 
our order is not complete we don't have rice  
and it's like sorry there's nothing we can do and 
trust me we're doing our best already so it's a bit  
ridiculous but anyway that's the situation 
with food Panda yeah because I'm so hungry
because I didnt eat this chicken I want only just rice so now we go to market 
and buy many products buy many fruit many veggie and i will cooking russian food at home
yes first time trying Alina's 
cooking actually for me  
so... be careful. back to talking about currencies just 
then the thing about uh one Australian  
dollars is equal to 37 pesos so it's super hard for me to calculate but if you think like  
Thai baht then Thai bahts is actually half of 
Philippine Pesos and Australian dollars is  
one australian dollar equals to  25 thai bahts that way it's easier for me to calculate 
and understand how it works but still a lot  
of quick calculations and maths just need remember 
like 100 peso how much is Australian dollars
wow I don't know three or four dollars 
I think three or four Australian dollars yeah  
yeah but anyway we'll put the calculations yeah 
it's two dollars huh really yeah one dollar it's  
uh 50 60. one dollar is 60 pesos oh true it's 
two to three dollars you're right Australian  
120 is 2 dollars
I think she's better at maths than me or 
maybe I'm just bad it's normal dollars not australian 
okay right. What I dont use Australian...
I don't use U.S dollar I put it here anyway 
usually but anyway you can see how we need to  
go to Marketplace and we need walking 
15 minutes 15 minutes yeah oh hey hello
Saranghae (love you in Korean) I love it hello how are you
Kumusta
vlogger? sorry yeah vlogger vlogger nice meeting you. alright we just keep walking on the streets  
and see what's the deal about this area they've 
got some massage spa place as well hello and I  
think one of you actually told me here in the 
Philippines if you want to do massage it's uh  
someone recommended me to massage I think because 
I think you guys said the service here it's  
relatively more affordable than other places alright  we've got a small Mart here it's a Korean  
Korean I'd see Korean words here no idea there 
are so many Korean words here so many Korean influence
Again, samyupsal. Samgyupsal. Even if I pretend to be korean I cannot because some words cannot pronounce. 
Annyeonghaseyo (means hello in Korean), kamsamnida (means thank you in Korean)
yep Alina is quite flowing in uh Korean. Saranghae (means i love you in korean)
I feel like very busy traffic everywhere here 
in Cebu yeah see I think many traffic but  
I think it's okay no one don't don't ride fast 
like in bali bali so crazy drivers yeah  
true Bali because there are many new drivers. usually foreigners 
they drive like so crazy here I don't I don't
see foreigners maybe they live in island like cebu island yeah probably. not cebu city
do you guys know where all the foreigners live 
in the Philippines because we haven't  
been seeing a lot even Manila and here not a lot maybe in Boracay,Palawan Maybe  
boracay I guess hello no it's okay 
thank you thank you he was selling water  
but many of you guys have warned me be aware 
when I hold my GoPro like this on my phone  
because there are a lot of phone snatchers on the street
they drive motoribikes and  so I  
need to be extra careful that's why I try to 
hold my camera with the other hand opposite to  
the road now you need put like this oh like a 
like uh yeah sure like a rope or something yeah  
yeah yeah this place is called Landers not too 
sure you guys have been aircon alright let's  
see oh wow it's like Costco hello good morning 
good morning how are you I'm good thank you oh  
mask yes mask okay oh wow it's a big shopping 
mall it's like Costco reminds me of in Australia
oh no do we need membership cards come in ah so 
normal people cannot come. Membership there. Okay thank you  
how much is a membership 400 for how long one year for 
one year 400 oh we're here for one month though  
is there a monthly plan or ? no that is uh annually 
renew one I see every year every year 
Do we need one here? Might go to another one yes thank you 
see we're only here for one month so there's no  
point for us to get like a yearly membership 
but it does feel a bit like Costco big Costco  
Costco if you guys dont know it already it's a massive 
massive shopping like a market in Australia and  
even sell coffin so now we're actually heading 
to Marketplace because we really want to get  
some groceries we don't know if there are any like 
local grocery stores around apart from Marketplace  
but that's the closest we can find around this 
area and I'm so interesting where can I rent scooter
for a local price not tourist price and yeah if you know 
guys tell me yeah I need your recommendation yes  
your recommendations have always been helping 
us since we arrived and honestly without your  
help we don't know where we're going all the time 
but anyway I think there's this area that we're  
living in is very close to IT Park yeah maybe 
later we'll go IT Park but I think one of you  
guys says we should go to IT Park I'm not too sure 
if IT Park is related to anything about computers  
or it or anything but maybe it's just a name Puppy  so sleepy. Oh here have fruits. awesome yeah yesterday I walked here
Oh, its like a market? yeah it's like a small Market local market they have 
got some bakeries here got some local street  
food here yeah looks busy sometimes I quite 
like to live amongst the locals live like a  
local to understand how they they live here in Cebu 
and you've got many food options there as well
yeah we're living like a local but now 
we're just walking. locals take motorbike  
soon soon we'll live like a local 
yeah yeah oh whoa so small cat
yeah so small cat wow Hello Kitty  
yeah or jeepney oh is this jeepney it looks a 
bit different no it looks a little bit different
yeah it looks a bit different in my opinion 
I don't know if they're called jeepneys here  
but they look a bit different they stop 
us right now until we cannot make vlog  
for a GoPro but we can make Vlog for iPhone 
they say in the CBD you cannot record with  
GoPro but you can record your with your phone logic 
okay I don't understand it's so strange first  
time hearing a country cannot use camera on the 
streets yeah even in CBD I don't understand why  
alright guys so we have arrived at Ayala 
shopping center and we're looking to do some  
grocery shopping so it's actually our first time 
doing grocery shopping here in the Philippines so  
we're really curious about how the prices will 
be like here in the Philippines so we're going  
to not not particular local market we're going 
to like an international big uh shopping market  
so it will be Marketplace so one thing I've been 
meaning to ask you guys is that the direction of  
this Philippine vlog so you know we've been 
making lots of couple Vlogs where I'm testing  
out short format vlogs and long format vlogs as 
well we've done for example the 50 cents ice cream  
um Street ones and we've also done them until I'm 
long video which is like for example  
divisoria Street vlog which is 20 minutes long 
and we don't really know what kind of videos you  
guys prefer more but anyway we will just keep 
making so if you guys have any recommendations  
about what we can do uh here in Cebu Philippines 
and also what kind of videos guys prefer watching 
then let us know in the comments
because we really want to know your feedback 
and we produce the best content for you guys  
to watch and that's our goal as content 
creators and YouTube vloggers as well  
finally we're going to do some grocery shopping 
this uh the moment Alina has been dreaming of  
having our own apartment. today I am like a wife haha like
wife and buy every food every good and healthy  
food whose wife are yours oh Justin 
Justin's Justin's wife yeah who's Justin
just kidding just kidding just kidding alright 
what are we getting first I mrs tam. I'm  
getting banana wow so big wow green bananas oh 
yeah it was actually quite big oh it is yeah oh  
what is yellow banana yeah where's the normal ones 
normal banana oh there yellow normal banana at the counter
we come to supermarket another supermarket
oreo big pack. finally. yesterday so strange I like this 
supermarket so many options yesterday so strange  
7-Eleven they don't have uh they don't 
have even like normal Oreo they only have  
like a small one like this yeah but where is 
the flavor natural oh this how much 35 250 250.  
hey I think it's okay no need a lot let's 
buy something healthy buy something different  
yeah I like this bigger shopping mall it was like 
it's like the feels like the normal supermarket in  
Australia I like more yeah true oh Pantine we need 
shampoo yeah we have everybody brand shampoo it's  
a fun team okay we already take this as shampoo 
it's my favorite shampoo we finally find this and  
to paste this is brand I don't know I don't know 
this brand that looks cool okay what's next wipe  
let's get wipe let's go cleaning the 
stove and everything. two hours later  
we buy everything from water cereal bread 
I guess guess how much it is I guess it's  
two thousand I think I think 2 500 marshmallow baby look oh let's take this one omg
 it's my love okay yeah 
we'll see we'll see we'll see
alright so anyway guys so after Marketplace we 
went to a local supermarket in the shopping mall  
and we bought all these groceries so we can see 
it's a lot so you've got a big bottle of water  
and we'll do some unboxing later once we arrive 
back to our apartment but we spent around 3500  
pesos today you're spending all on groceries for 
I think for a week or two maybe yeah for a week or  
two of groceries. No one, not for two. Yeah for one week for one week yeah 
so many many food like spaghetti like you know  
meat and everything but now we're heading back and 
another thing it's like catching um transportation  
here in the Philippines it's actually quite 
relatively more difficult I believe because  
um for example we called like grab called like 
Joyride it was so hard for us to find any  
rides around here and the traffic isn't see 
we're stuck in traffic jam at the moment and so  
everywhere you go there's heavy traffic and I 
think best option you want to go around yeah  
big traffic big red line that you can see 
so the best way to go around Philippines I  
think sometimes if in Manila or even in Cebu 
it's where we go buy motorbikes sometimes and  
yeah it's probably a good thing that you know 
how to ride motorbikes and you get around later
yeah justin so bad at riding motorbike. hey you don't know I just it's just because.. and I am worry about you.
I don't have a lot of experience yet so  
I think for me I would have to ride 
one of those ride sharing motorbike  
um so unfortunately that's the case but yeah 
anyway we're heading home now so I'll see you guys  
back at home and I'll give you guys a room tour 
as well alright guys so we've just came home and  
just then the taxi was actually 60 to 60 how much 
was it 90 90 80 pesos so compared to grab which  
charged 130 to 160 just then during peak hours so 
definitely a taxi this time on meters it's a win  
so here we've got our groceries so we've got some 
veggies spring onion not my favorite we've got uh  
cabbage lettuce veggies cucumber and we've got 
oil we've got our chocolate snack waffles ah  
yeah good chocolate milk there I think and and 
this and we've got some soup base this is a hot  
pot so you can see pork bone hot pot so we've got 
some udon that's why we bought these soup packs  
as well got parmesan cheese for spaghetti cooking 
we've got some salt seasoning we have got Rice we've got oatmeal  
we've got cereal we've got milk there we've got 
carrots and we've got spaghetti of course and  
here we've got more oatmeal different flavors 
actually and we've got cream cheese to spread  
on bread and we've got sourdough as well we've 
got tomato sauce with ricotta ricotta to make  
today pasta yes pasta Justin do you cook today 
you will maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe
and we have got gloves here. I want justin cook today. You want me to cook? 
Yes. Fine I will cook for you then. what you want to cook ?we can make um I don't know 
I need to look at it I don't need to look online first to see what i can cook. Oh this we need to put in fridge
yeah this is bad boy it's a fish 
ball with cheese and also udon 
as i mentioned just now. Many many udon and also we take
chicken and it's the beef so we 
need first to go and put in fridge
justin put please
baby this too fridge oh no no 
fridge just just it's just there  
oh yeah yeah just there I I make later 
separate yeah and make chicken separate  
alright my professional yes and what 
else have we got here we've got just basically  
daily necessities like toothpaste you know my favorite my favourite marshmallow 
definitely not a daily necessity don't eat this
just kidding. for alina's happiness. I guess um I hope this is everything for one 
week it's enough for us yeah I hope and we have got some  
daily necessities like hand wipes and I don't know this is 
good or not like for wash hands wash clothes yeah  
for wash clothes but we take it we don't know 
where how it smell but it looks good yeah so
oh our laundry, oh crap we need to go and grab it. 5:00pm she said oh yeah 
but we have got our shampoo as well yeah that's pretty much what we got 
and all these cost 3 500 pesos I don't know if  
it's a good price but we bought a supermarket so 
I think that's the best we could get otherwise I  
think our veggies the only place you could like 
really save money on it's it's like probably the  
veggies we can buy local Fresh Market but 
just then it was just too much hustle for  
us because you know it was a bit far away and 
we had to carry everything and go to fresh fruit  
Market it might be just not worth it so anyway 
we grab everything here and yeah that's pretty  
much we we're living here in Cebu for one month 
like you know like a normal person really yeah and it really it's  
my first time ever that actually feels like 
staying at a home you know so because place where I can go
anyways yes it's first time ever because 
I've been traveling non-stop for nine  
months so yeah this really is an experience 
and especially living with Alina that's  
so it's going to be quite cute I think yeah so 
uh yeah that's about it oh this is our apartment  
yeah and this is our motivation exactly it says 
Inspire lead a creative life which is exactly  
what we're doing the two of us yeah creating 
awesome content we buy new Lighting in Manila  
which is in divisoria which you guys saw the vlog 
yeah divisoria and we've got this ring light and  
it's been super handy because we we should shoot 
a lot of like TikToks and and anyway there's  
natural Lighting in the morning here from this 
balcony and let me give you guys the room tour  
as well so this is our kitchens so excuse 
order mess on the floor but this is our kitchen  
and you can see this is my mini workspace which is 
good because it's separated from our main bedroom  
because Alina she's very sensitive to uh noise 
so even tiny bit of movements or like keyboard  
sound to wake her up so it's good that I've got 
a table there and we've got a balcony yeah and  
here this is our bedroom for this month all right 
so let me see let me turn the light so here we've  
got a mini balcony outside as well so this 
basically our room not particularly a big bed  
but we've got like a wardrobe here as well in our 
toilet so you can go shower space uh yep so pretty  
standard facilities and because we are living in 
this condo and we paid 800 Australian dollars for  
this condo it's an Airbnb and it comes with a 
swimming pool as well as a gym as well so I don't  
know if that's a good price but you guys have any 
better places as far as you say let us know in the  
comments because we might be you know extending 
I was thinking in Cebu who knows we'll never know  
but of course you also want to explore all other 
places here in the Philippines especially you want  
to go to the blue ass water islands and beaches 
for example like if you want to go Palawan  
I want to go to Boracay all these places we are 
looking forward to visit them we want to like you  
know go to all the beautiful beaches or the world 
renowned Landscapes here in the Philippines but  
anyway that's it for this Vlog I think is there 
anything you want to add nothing okay that's  
the end of this Vlog then I guess anyway thanks
