as I know we don't do this here in the
states
um I didn't do it when I graduated
that's for sure
um but this is so cool and let me know
what the picture represented like I
wanna say that it's a special picture
obviously uh with their families maybe
with their parents I need my glasses I
don't have them right next to me so I
could kind of see better
um wow but this is so special and to me
this is absolutely brilliant I mean I
love it so special I will definitely
remember this special day for the rest
of my life like it will be a topic for
sure her also why are they wearing
orange or red masks I mean it looks
Orange from here
um but this is so cool and if you guys
never send me this request like I would
have never known I would have missed
something huge I mean this is huge for
you guys and now for me it's like hey it
opened my eyes like I discovered a new
thing that I had no clue before believe
it or not I didn't know this and this is
brilliant I mean this is so cool and
like I said Filipinos you guys take it
to a different level and you have so
many creative ideas you are so talented
everybody's singing and of course it
sounds so good because you guys can sing
and also I love the choreography so and
I assume that this is mandatory because
I mean if you want to graduate then you
need to sing the song

and practice and definitely something
like very memorable and I love it I love
