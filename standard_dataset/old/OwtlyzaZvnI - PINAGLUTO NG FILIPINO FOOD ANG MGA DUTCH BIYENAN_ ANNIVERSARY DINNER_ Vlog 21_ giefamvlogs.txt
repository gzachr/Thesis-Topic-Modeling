Good afternoon.
 
I'm wearing an apron coz I'm gonna start cooking.
You can hear my baby in the background. She's a bit moody.
She's a bit sleepy.
 
today is um our anniversary
'Dodong' has flowers for me.
I'm gonna put this into the vase.
My in-laws are coming.
They're having dinner here.
It'll be my first time to cook Filipino food for them
for them.
They've already eaten here but I had not prepared Filipino food for them.
It'll be their first time to try so I hope they like it.
They're not really picky but hopefully they'll like it.
So first I'm gonna put my baby to sleep
after that, I'll start preparing.
Hopefully I can finish it in time.
I'll be making....(if I can)
chicken adobo
beed caldereta...Ms Diane's recipe
lovemyrr vlog
I'm not sure if I can still make beef broccoli
and of course lumpia. We can't miss the lumpia.
I already have premade lumpia. 
Normally I make a lot and then just freeze them in
when its ready... See you
I'm gonna marinate the chicken now.
I already added Datu Puti vinegar.
Silver Swan soy sauce
I'm gonna add a bit of garlic powder.
It's called Knoflook and then a bit of white pepper
My in-laws gave me plants.
These two.
It's their anniversary gift for us.
By the way, I have an assistant. 
This beautiful lady.
it's 2 30 so i'll start cooking at four o'clock so  
the longer you marinate this one the 
the better the better the tastier
Anna...are you hungry?
Mama is also hungry.
I'm gonna try to make beef broccoli.
I also have cheese so it's cheesy.
This is really Ms. Diane's recipe.
