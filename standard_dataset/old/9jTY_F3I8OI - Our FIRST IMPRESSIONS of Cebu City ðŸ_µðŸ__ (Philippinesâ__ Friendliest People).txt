Title: Our FIRST IMPRESSIONS of Cebu City ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­ (Philippinesâ€™ Friendliest People)

Transcript:
one two three
hello from cebu so we arrived here yesterday
we took a flight from manila to cebu which
was only an hour long and for those of you
who don't know where is is actually in the
central visayas region of the philippines
and on the flight yesterday we were looking
down on the island and we saw how beautiful
cebu looks the water is blue there are tons
of tiny islands surrounding it so we're really
excited to explore cebu for the next week
so our plan for today is to explore some local
eats around the area and also go visit some
new and old landmarks of the city so join
us as we get to know what cebu city is like
this place is interesting isn't it yeah it's
like a super local place just behind our hotel
and we ordered three things we have chicken
adobo the classic pork sisig stir-fried bean
sprouts with some minced meat and rice
and it's really hot and it comes like a plastic
bag so you put it on the plate yourself is
the food good here yes very good can i ask
you what this is this one automatic water
machine so it's just it's just water oh okay
one peso oh let's try it
oh you put the water in a plastic bag yeah
yeah okay and you drop the coin okay
no there's no straw you just drink it
leave it first when you need it because when
you bite it you have to finish the bag okay
i'm gonna leave it here okay let's try the
food what do you call this lanciao soup what's
in it it's the cow skin of a cow sperm of
a cow
I think she's joking there's no sperm I don't
know this one is a mystery piece oh
it's thick the soup itself is really good
very nice yeah i like this a lot we find that
when we were in manila it was a bit harder
to find really local places because we were
living in kind of a more like upscale neighborhood
but this is the kind of shop that we love
to eat in this adobo sauce oh my goodness
now we're talking
chicken adobo is my favorite you should try
this sisig though it's like nice and like
caramelized like it tastes really really good
and because they cut it into smaller chunks
then the first pork sisig that we tried i
find that this is easier to like eat with
rice yeah bite the corner
refreshing you want some yeah it might be
a hard now for you
and you can finish it
180 180
very good very good okay let's grab coffee
so we're super excited to come to this place
which is called the good cup coffee company
to try filipino coffee or filipino beans because
we find it a bit hard actually looking for
local coffee we've seen a lot of chain coffee
shops like starbucks and dunkin donuts and
coffee beans so when we googled this place
we thought like we have to try it smell it
first
super smooth perfect start to our day so Note
has been talking to the rental company through
whatsapp and we are planning to rent a motorbike
for two days while we are here in cebu so
the negotiated rate was 500 pesos a day and
200 pesos for delivery so they're going to
bring it from their shop over to the coffee
shop where we are at it seems like it's a
better place to do that than manila because
when we were there the traffic was kind of
crazy and even for Note he was like i'm not
sure about renting a bike so cebu is the place
to do it Cebu seems to be a little more relaxed
and calm so i'm confident i have confidence
in you too
where are you from i'm from thailand wow that's
why you look like a filipino
yeah yeah wow that's good that was interesting
hello welcome to cebu philippines very pleased
with smile i hope can i get a lot of customer
because of you so if you are planning to come
to cebu and you want to rent a motorbike rent
it from mr jackie yeah yeah hi welcome philippines
just to ensure we protect ourselves Note is
just taking a video around the bike to make
sure the scratches that are already there
we document them but jackie has been really
helpful he was telling us that parking usually
is like 20 pesos and you pay the enforcers
on the street and also you can't just park
anywhere so they're like designated parking
spots so this is all really useful information
because we probably would just have parked
anywhere because in thailand that's what you
do so we're glad that he told us that if you
have been following us on instagram then you
may have noticed we've been upping our photography

the rest of the video now that we have the
bike and our helmets we are ready to go explore
the city are you ready i'm ready i'm darth
vader it's always exciting to drive in a new
country so this time we are driving on the
right side which is not that unfamiliar to
us because in canada we also drive on the
right side we love renting a motorbike and
exploring the city of course we don't recommend
it for everyone because if you're not comfortable
driving on a motorbike definitely don't do
it and also if you don't have the proper license
that can also be an issue so note does have
a thie license which is valid in the philippines
so we are good
what is this i think this is the heritage
monument let's take a look okay hello good
afternoon welcome i am the caretaker
this is the first Cebuano president of the
philippines and then the second that one they
bring our bibles and the cross this second
saint of the philippines pedro calungsod okay
okay you take a picture there yeah we're gonna
walk around thank you so this is the heritage
of cebu monuments so i think all of these
sculptures here kind of tell the story of
how the people of cebu contributed to the
development of the philippines it's not a
very big place so we'll just walk around and
capture some of the stories that we see here
so there's not a lot of written description
that is explaining more about this monument
here but i'm sure you can ask the caretaker
he has so many stories he wants to share just
at the top i can see there is a huge cross
and that's because christianity is so important
to the filipino culture they've been celebrating
christianity for over 500 years here so walking
around anywhere in the philippines you're
going to see a lot of cathedrals and churches
and chapels so there was no entry fee to come
into the heritage of cebu monument but we
noticed just across the street from us there
is a yap sandiego ancestral house and a quick
search on google says that it is 50 pesos
to go in to check out what an old chinese
filipino house looks like that's dated back
to the 1600s i just love my helmet it's so
intense off to the next destination
very nice costume japanese thailand and canada
what uh what what tribe again kalinga and
this one is spaniard era
because we're celebrating the philippine independence
day so yeah beautiful
thank you i'm so flattered
three two one
so that was super fun they're so cute they
were preparing to do a photo shoot of all
the traditional filipino costumes and you
can actually see that there's a lot of people
over here as well just like practicing some
dancing and like getting together and i think
this is called independence park i love this
place already but the real reason we are down
here is because we're visiting fort san pedro
which is one of the oldest forts in the philippines
so the history of the fort is super interesting
it was built in 1565 and it's kind of a triangular
shaped fort it was built by these spaniards
when they first came to colonize the philippines
they used it to protect themselves against
the natives at the time but after that it
was converted to a school at one point in
world war 2 it was converted as a hospital
and now they have turned this into a beautiful
garden and also a place where people can come
to learn about the history that the philippines
went through
so we paid 30 pesos each to come into the
fort and it's actually a really beautiful
area there's a lot of action happening as
well they're people playing beach volleyball
there's people dancing making tik tok videos
it's just a very pleasant place to come to
spend your evenings welcome to the philippines
