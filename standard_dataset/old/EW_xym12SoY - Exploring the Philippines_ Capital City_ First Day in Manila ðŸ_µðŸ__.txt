Title: Exploring the Philippines' Capital City: First Day in Manila ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­

Transcript:
last time you saw us, we were travelling through 
the night all the way from Cambodia to the  
Philippines we arrived at our first hotel 
we slept all day and then we checked into  
our actual Airbnb that we're staying in for a 
week and we slept pretty much all night because  
we've been traveling literally through the 
nights we were absolutely shattered and now  
we're here the Airbnb that we're staying in 
is in a place called Makati in Manila which  
is the capital of the Philippines it's almost 
like a home away from home because it is a full  
apartment the Airbnb is pretty small but it's 
perfect for what we need we looked around for  
the prices of hotels here in Manila and 
for anything in our price range it just  
didn't make any sense so for the first time in 
a while yeah we're staying in an Airbnb 
people carry them around like the small 
ones people seem to be carrying them like  
babies I'm like oh someone's carrying a 
baby no no it's a really cute dog it's  
so nice first things first it's time to grab 
a coffee we saw on Google there was loads of  
nice coffee shops and just walking around 
now is definitely a Vibe here it's really  
cool it was Christmas Christmas decorations 
everywhere it's literally like we are in the  
North Pole but it's it's hot obviously yeah I 
haven't seen this many Christmas decorations  
in years I don't think I've ever seen this 
many even from Sweden or in Wales we don't  
go that hard like we go hard but we don't 
go the Philippines hard 
can we have one French kiss and one Cinema Brew  
are they both better hot yeah okay 
let's let's have them thank you
oh that smells like Christmas right let's 
explain what's happening we're in a place  
called odd Cafe it's on the seventh floor 
of some random building we've never heard  
of because it's our first time here but we 
found it online it's in the Makati area  
and this area seems really hip quite trendy I 
sound so old saying as we were walking from our  
Airbnb towards this Cafe which took us a while 
to find actually because it's on the seventh  
floor and we found a sort of weekend market 
so definitely after this coffee we'll head  
there this one has like a caramel popcorn 
flavor and there's popcorn on top and then  
the other one was called french kiss and it's 
like the flavor of French toast I can actually  
smell the cinnamon from here it smells like 
Christmas oh did he that's why I can smell  
it so much and then we got a delicious little 
sweet treat on the side can't go wrong with that  
oh that's good it does taste like French toast 
perfect way to start the day right it's delicious  
I think the popcorn is melted so 
it's inside here it's different if  
you like a traditional coffee you probably 
wouldn't like this but I like it it's sweet
that coffee was strong now we're going 
to the Salcedo weekend markets I think  
that's what it looks like online anyway 
there was loads of people there earlier  
when we were walking past but I think 
they were just kind of getting set up  
because we got up early this 
morning let's go check it out
Hello. Bicho Bicho. oh nice and warm it's 
uh called you know Addiction in the bread  
yeah it's very addictive that's 
good thank you thank you so much
did she just give this to us I thought I thought 
it was a sales tactic it's not she just gave  
this to us that's so nice I thought she was 
going to give us a tiny um section she gave  
you a full one it's a bicho bicho I keep thinking 
she's gonna come and be like no you have to pay  
me but she went bye and also oh okay thank you so 
much walking over here to find this table we were  
offered so many free samples and we actually had 
to say no because I am so full from that donut  
and the other cake that we had and the coffees 
but we secured a drink it is a boku and pandan  
drink which turns out to be coconut but they had 
like little jelly bits in there looks super like  
naughty jelly I got jelly oh that's sweet oh my 
God it tastes like the ingredients of bua loi in  
Thailand oh yeah wow that is good yeah that's good 
all right should you go for a walk yes thank you
this Market is really cool actually it goes 
all the way around this park and then in the  
middle there is also some food stands as 
well and it's quite varied there's like  
Korean food there's Pakistani food there's 
obviously Filipino food there's fresh food  
there's vegetables fruits there's fish loads 
of desserts and it's like so hard to resist  
I am very full and this is like topping me 
up even more so we have to try some later
we just walked about five minutes 
away from that little markets and we've  
come to sort of like a Gardens it's like 
called Ayala triangle or something but it  
looks like there's going to be a concert 
or something here or Christmas Market  
yes Christmas Market yes that makes a lot more 
sense yeah it's almost Christmas time but people  
were telling us that Christmas in the Philippines 
basically like the celebration starts on the 1st  
of September we don't listen to any Christmas 
music until the first of December yeah anything  
before that it just feels wrong yeah turns out 
we weren't allowed to film in there the security  
guards came over super duper nice and they said 
sorry it's private property you're not allowed  
to film in here but everyone's been so nice since 
we got here literally since we've arrived I think  
we've been told welcome to the Philippines 
about 20 times already it is very welcoming  
and with the whole Christmas thing don't get 
us wrong we love how Christmasy it is it's  
literally Christmas music everywhere everyone's 
saying happy holidays welcome to the Philippines  
it's like you feel right at home it's fantastic 
and when we were in the airports we had loads  
of people asking us if we were vloggers which 
obviously makes sense because we had the camera  
on us but then we went out without the camera 
and someone still asked Adriana Are you a vlogger  
but we've not even made a vlog here in the 
Philippines it's kind of nice yeah it's it's  
everyone seems to really enjoy the camera it's 
kind of like a fun thing that everyone's like oh  
you're vlogging and you're like oh yes with the 
Philippines and this trip I think we're gonna have  
to do it in two go's as in like we'll go to the 
places first time and then we'll come back and do  
the other places because it's so big and so much 
to see there's yeah so many places to go and every  
time we speak to someone else they're like oh you 
have to go here here and here and we're like okay  
and then here here and here it'll take us months 
yeah but we're gonna do it we're gonna do it
it's doing circles
this looks so different from where we just 
were which is like high rises and very like  
fancy built up City this feels very Spanish 
Spanish yeah it looks very beautiful though
from what country from Sweden thank you you can  
hear the Christmas music Mariah 
Carey is greeting us to this port
for Christmas is you thank you so much romance 
we've just taken a grab from the Makati area  
to a place called Fort Santiago which is one 
of the main tourist attractions here in Manila
 
Fort Santiago, this place was built in 1570 and 
1590 so probably like 430 years ago a long  
time ago which is really cool it's built by 
the Spanish yeah there's a lot of information  
a lot of dates a lot of different sections that have different names 
all we can say we that's not a real person  
I looked over and I was like why is he staring at me
I just looked quickly and I was like oh sir anyway 
there's a lot of different sections and they're  
all very beautiful but you might be able to tell 
behind us the clouds are coming on in and they're  
coming on in hard and fast so we're gonna explore 
this place a little bit before it starts pouring with rain
that was a really cool place to just walk around 
it was built by the Spanish then over the years  
up until I think World War II it was like Brits 
were here the Americans were here and the Japanese  
were here as well yeah there's a lot of history 
here there's a bit of dark history there as well  
um it's a bit sad got a really cool place to visit 
yeah and the sun is out beautiful on a sunny day
thank you
so now that we've done a little bit of History 
we're going to do basically completely the  
opposite we're going to head to one of the many 
many shopping malls that Manila has there's loads  
online there's one that looks really really cool 
it's basically looks like Venice but when we were  
looking at it online it doesn't really look like 
I had any shops anyway what we're going to do is  
head to the biggest mall in the Philippines which 
happens to be here in Manila it's also the third  
biggest shopping mall in the whole entire world 
so they'll definitely have some shops
is there an ikea here? for those of you who don't know Ikea is from 
Sweden where I am also from so it feels like home
we're gonna get lost in here it's massive already 
it's so Christmassy Ikea is in here  
we are in a mall called SM Mall of Asia which 
is I think from what we looked at the third  
biggest mall in the world or something but this 
Ikea is actually the biggest in the world so  
with Adriana being from Sweden we have to 
pop in at least at least get some snacks  
get some Christmasy things you can't not right 
are you happy I am I didn't know this was here
okay we've got some classic ginger bread 
cookies or pepparkakor as we call them in  
Sweden I mean it says what it is what it says 
on the tins gingerbread cookies or Ginger Snaps  
let's have a little look around just in case 
there's anything else these if you're ever  
in Ikea anywhere in the world these are classic 
classic Swedish sweets delicious I'm buying them  
you should buy them too so just gonna buy these 
now I don't think we have time to go around this  
Ikea I think it would take us hours this is not 
why we're here plus we don't own an apartment  
here so there's no point buying any these 
will be gone in a few days or maybe tonight
favorite oh so good like childhood memories cheese  
Doodles oh since 1968 so even before I was 
born thank you early Christmas presently
it's precious cargo tell carry like this now oh I'm so 
excited but that's not actually why we came to  
this mall unfortunately because we just want 
to see it because it's massive the Christmas  
decorations and everything but to buy some shoes 
we can't come to Ikea without having a hot  
dog though no just a quick hot dog quick hot dog 
before we do a little bit of shopping around this huge Mall
wow population the Philippines 
is 10 times more than Sweden
Sweden is bigger wow there's a lot of people here 
candy canes everywhere just kind of came it's  
kind of came as Christmas Christmas it's so nice 
it's so nice we just came up to this and I was  
like oh look at the decorations it's moving now 
there's children on it here we go around it's not  
decoration well it is a merry-go-round Christmas 
decoration oh is this always here no this is  
Christmas themed this small is big and it's not 
like you know one of those malls where it's just  
a square and you know where you're going you're 
just going around in a square like there's staircases  
everywhere it seems like we're kind of on a floor 
that has a lot of shoe shops so I feel like we've  
somehow ended up accidentally kind of in the 
right place I think we just found the biggest tree  
in this mall whoa look how sparkly it is 
it's like drawing me to it whoa just look  
at this there's a gingerbread house just 
down here huge sparkly Christmas tree and  
it's just like this Christmas hanging from 
everywhere oh I look over there there's  
Christmas there Christmas down here Christmas 
up there also more Christmas is so nice
oh my God it was wearing a diaper yeah like 
people treat them like children so like they  
have diversity sit in little prams they're like 
have cute outfits it's it's very cute we're right on  
the top floor now and there's like an ice rink 
there's a food hall there's laser tag there's  
bowling, there's archery and snacks everywhere 
luckily we just had a hot dog so we're fine
just getting a pair of shoes now though because 
these are past their time look at the difference  
of these right I've had these for probably about 
a year now but they've also been ruined because  
we poured coconut oil on it and the back here 
is actually broken and it's ruining my socks I  
don't know why I'm trying them because I know 
these are the right size looking fresh yeah
I told them to either recycle the 
old ones or throw them in the bin
how do I look?
um can we please have Halo Halo special, and leche flan?
um we're currently signing a place called Max's 
Restaurant we were outside it is busy today it  
is Saturday so we were lucky to get a table I 
think I don't even know what time it is it's  
not even like eating time but either way we're 
having more desserts now but it's a very famous  
Filipino dessert yeah if you're new here desserts 
kind of is our thing we're in Vietnam we did one  
full video on the best desserts and coffee 
that we could find in one city if you're a  
Filipino and you're watching this you probably 
know what this is I would hope so it's supposed  
to be popular if you're not Filipino it's 
called Halo Halo and this is leche flan which  
I think is also on here if I'm not mistaken it 
looks like there's like a chunk of another one  
a little bit like ice kachang that we had in 
Malaysia or some of the desserts that we had in  
Vietnam as well it's got like a lot of different 
jellies ice cream I think some flan it's melting
yeah
that's good right well the ice cream is good 
yeah what is this I don't know like purple  
ice cream I've had flan before so I don't 
know if it's gonna be like similar to those  
ones so I said it's different not slightly 
different and very firm very very good though
yeah that's really firm really tasty though if 
you guys know any other desserts or dishes that  
we should be trying in the Philippines 
then by all means let us know because we love dessert
that's the evidence that's how good that 
was I've tried so many dessert that's  
probably one of my favorites but I think 
that's enough desserts for today let's  
pay up let's probably run 10K so we 
can burn all these calories out today
as we were walking out of their restaurant 
the lady that was opening the door for us  
was like thank you see you tomorrow I was like 
we probably won't be back tomorrow not because  
it wasn't nice because that was so much sugar 
so we're just about to head back into the mall  
I don't even think we've touched the sides of 
this mall it is huge let alone touch the sides  
of Manila as a whole so we'll probably have to 
do a lot more exploring here so if you've got  
any suggestions please drop them down below yeah 
remember to subscribe and see you in the next one
it's Christmas
