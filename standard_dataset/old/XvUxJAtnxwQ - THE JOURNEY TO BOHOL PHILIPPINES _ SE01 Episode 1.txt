morning, ladies and gentleman.
We're going to start

- Alright, the time is 11:52,
just landed in Cebu.
We'll stay here for about,
(breathes deeply)
three or four hours and
get a ferry over to Bohol.
(upbeat music)
Hi guys, 13:07 and I'm at Mactan,
slash Cebu international airport,
and I've just arrived here
about a half and hour ago
just to clear through
customs and what not.
So I'm just actually here,
just kind of hanging out.
I'm going to get the
afternoon ferry to Bohol,
which is probably,
maybe later on this afternoon,
Maybe 6:00 p.m. or 5:00 p.m.,
I'll jump on the ferry
and head over to Bohol,
which is uh, about,
from what I'm told, about
an hour and a half from
the ferry terminal.
So I might give you some scenics of that,
but basically from the airport, here,
super hot,
and I'm super tired,
and it's about a 20 minute taxi ride
to the ferry terminal,
and then I'm gonna get
a ferry over to Bohol.
So I'll do my best to show
you the journey to Bohol,
a little bit of Bohol,
and then might just close off for the day,
and I can get some rest.
You might get to see the place
that I'm staying at as well.
So stay tuned.
