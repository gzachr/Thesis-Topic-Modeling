Transcript:
good morning good afternoon wherever you are 
so we have arrived at new area here in Manila  
and this area is called BGC and this area is so 
different to where we live which is in Makati let  
me show you around so as soon as you arrived you 
see all these beautiful Christmas decorations and  
got Elena super excited because Elena it is you 
got New Year's in Russia yes happy New Year happy  
New Year but you know growing Australia and Hong 
Kong they call this Christmas and Christmas in  
here in Manila or here in the Philippines start 
very early so Christmas according to the driver  
just then [ __ ] actually it actually starts from 
September what a way to December so a super long  
time and surrounding this area there are many 
massive restaurants with two stories see cocoa  
itself has got two stories as well and you can 
see the street is packed with people with a lot  
of different decorations and I really like this 
area camera Makati this is so different but anyway  
tonight we are walking around the streets and we 
hopefully we can find like a nice restaurant to  
dine in and I just want to check out this area 
because so many of you have been recommending  
bgcb GCB you see so we are finally here in this 
beautiful area and I'm loving it so you've got  
all these high really tall skyrise buildings 
as well just then I saw you've got lots of big  
corporates for example Big Bangs like Morgan 
Stanley and I saw you know Oreck over there so  
lots of different like companies and I think you 
can find all kinds of different Cuisines here and  
for example this we've got a bar here and we've 
got a camera store so different too I like this  
area a lot more we've got monolith Mona Lisa it's 
taking a selfie I snapped yourself I love bodies  
looks good I like this that's so cool yeah hello 
how are you Mona Lisa is looking hey what happened
yeah good marketing now I want to go 
in all right what else this year as  
the driver was saying just then this 
area is a mixed mix of foreigners and  
also locals so many different Cuisines no 
one or the foreigners want to stay here wow
so now we are heading to a restaurant so a few 
of you have actually given me recommendations  
of some of the Filipino restaurants around this 
area BGC So today we're gonna hopefully maybe go  
to one of them and because we're just gonna 
check out a menu for us we haven't actually  
looked at the menu so we just arrived here 
but oh the smell here it's amazing so mixer  
smells makes up a lot of different smells smells 
like a stick I think one of you guys recommended  
manam so we're gonna check it out and one 
of you also recommended this place called
another way oh is it oh all 
right so continuing our tour  
I'm just gonna show you guys The View along 
the way until we arrive at the restaurant  
so with this side we've got Pancake House 
and that's I've got Jollibee that we just  
had this afternoon what is this oh 
it's Korean bulgogi and what is this
man looking at all these restaurants 
makes me hungry and all right what else
we came all the way to each other what 
is this this looks interesting oh it's a  
museum oh it's called Mine Museum about your mind
yeah it feels like you know it's so different 
this is it now see I'm not sure you guys can  
hear me this is the Manila that we haven't 
seen yet and this is so new I love it
are many many cockroach yeah many 
cockroaches I think that's just the  
um it's just maybe around where we live it's 
not the whole Makati but just in our area in  
Makati was very dodgy but anyway this area it's 
a lot cleaner you can see on the streets that's  
something that I noticed and you know Alina and 
I have actually been a hotel content creator so  
a bit about ourselves because you know many 
of you are new to this channel so Alia and I  
have been actually creating content for a long 
time and we've been working a lot of hotels and  
resorts and coming to Manila like our Philippines 
on this visit is really trying to get that culture  
experience again and I guess take a break from 
the hotels and collaborations and everything  
and really get the authentic experience here in 
the Philippines which is something that I really  
enjoy you guys have been following Along Watch My 
Malaysian Vlog so you can see I absolutely love  
trying new street foods and good advantages 
and there's something new to Elena as well  
so she's okay sometimes get used to it taking 
some time but anyway I can see this smile means  
she likes this place BGC nice place I like it 
I like it don't get me wrong though I do like  
other areas of Manila too the hustling and the 
bustling which is for the experience I really  
like it and I can really get to learn about how 
the locals uh manila manila people how do you say  
manilans these are wood Manila local people from 
Manila how they live their life you know taking  
a Jeep and everything it's quite interesting 
rather than taking taxi and grab every time I  
feel like you know I want to try to live like a 
local and experience a coach here yeah respect  
to the drivers around this area so I think a 
drive is here are less crazy because yeah true  
extra motivation but I think the cars here really 
stopped voice just saying rather than in other  
areas it was a ton of yeah oh actually I realize 
there are no Jeep needs around this area too  
yeah yeah just realized yeah dude 
Japanese not come to this area

my gosh well my ears I feel like my eardrums are 
all gone but anyway the drinks how's the drinks  
compared to Thailand's movie
hey our Italian fans gonna gonna get angry
sometimes I think the thing about Thailand's 
movie is that sometimes it has a lot of eyes
