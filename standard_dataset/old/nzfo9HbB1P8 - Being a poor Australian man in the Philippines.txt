Title: Being a poor Australian man in the Philippines

Transcript:
Being a poor Australian man in the Philippines
A blunt heading, but it's a topic I feel like
being blunt about.
As an Australian man in the Philippines, you
simply don't want to be poor.
Mila and myself have lived here full time
for just over seven years, and we
do OK.
Our business is successful, and we therefore
live comfortably.
We're also conservative and
cautious about money, savings and investments.
Because there is no safety net.
You run out of money,
and you are out on the streets and all alone.
Being a poor Australian in the Philippines
is no fun at all!
Poor foreigners in the Philippines
We have friends here amongst the Australian
expats in the Philippines, as well as Canadians,
Americans
and Englishmen and a stray Iranian.
Some come here with investments, superannuation,
etc.
Others
have their home country pension.
Others run businesses.
There are those who work for Embassies and
global companies with a few key staff from
Australia or wherever who are on fairly healthy
salaries with
benefits.
I can't say I know any personally.
Most of the Aussies and other nationality
expats here are either on pensions or are
running businesses.
Mostly?
Not doing so well.
Mostly money is tight, and they do without
a lot of things.
And I wonder why
they do it, to be quite honest.
No matter where you live in the world, of
course there's a wolf at the door.
However countries like
Australia have very obvious safety nets.
Without meaning to appear unsympathetic to
any reader on a
low income, no one in Australia really falls
that far.
Not like they do here in Philippines.
Australia has
Centrelink benefits.
There's housing commission accommodation.
There's Medicare, and states like QLD
have free hospitals.
Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, even cheaper
if you're on Government benefits.
You can even get St Vincent de Paul to bring
you a food package if you're really short.
The Philippines?
There is no social security that is public,
or at least not open to those who didn't have
contributions paid into it while they were
working here.
So nothing for an Australian expat.
No housing
commission.
No charities that would take you very seriously
if you turned up on their doorstep.
And try
turning up at a hospital with no money and
see how far you get.
And unlike poor Filipinos, you don't
have a mountain of relatives and friends who
will chip in and help you out when things
go wrong.
What can happen to poor Australians?
I've known Australians here to end up literally
begging for help when things have gone wrong.
Health
issues and failed businesses are probably
the worst problems that can strike the Australian
ex-pat.
If a
man gets sick he can not only lose his source
of income, he can have serious medical bills.
Case in point.
A very sad story.
We had a friend.
Australian builder who was trying to establish
a
business here in Manila.
Did great work.
We had him doing some work at our place, and
we were very
happy with what he was doing.
But could see that he was struggling.
Great builder, but wasn't an astute
businessman at all.
Ended up getting ill, and died because he
couldn't afford proper care.
The Australian
Embassy only contacted his family in Australia
for him.
They won't loan money.
He left a wife and three
kids behind.
And we have another friend here who's been
getting chest pains over the last few weeks.
Wife and two
kids, plus a demanding business.
The worry is written all over his face, and
as a friend we're worried for
him too.
No Medicare to foot the bill, and if he's
not there to run his business the doors will
close.
And
no, he's also not rolling in spare cash.
A few weeks without income, and he will be
in trouble.
I won't elaborate today on the folly of many
Australians assuming they can set the Filipino
world on fire
with their great business ideas.
Many make wild assumptions as to what would
most certainly be
successful here, only to find out how wrong
they were.
I've written about this in other BLOG articles,
older readers will remember.
Many an Australian comes here and misjudges
the marketplace
completely.
Finds Filipino customers unwilling to part
with money and unwilling to try anything new.
Finds customers who will do everything to
avoid paying their accounts.
Those who expect bribes before
signing contracts.
Competition who can survive on much lower
incomes that they ever could.
So many a
business either fails or at least doesn't
produce what will pay for a moderately comfortable
lifestyle with
some savings to cover emergencies.
Yes, savings.
Some fat to fall back on during lean times
and to cover those unexpected emergencies.
Illnesses and hospitalization.
Operations.
Typhoons and earthquakes.
Cars needing to be replaced.
Family emergencies where your conscience doesn't
allow you to watch a child go without medical
treatment.
And lean business times, business failures
and getting fired from stable employment.
I was
talking to an expat once who bought an expensive
house a few years back, and said when they'd
settled
up he had less than a thousand dollars in
the bank.
That's insane!
What if a tragedy had struck at the
same time?
Then what?
And expats are well known for falling into
schemes and scams designed to part them from
their savings
too.
Many come here with hundreds of thousands
in the bank only to end up wondering where
it all
went.
Farming ventures.
Businesses which have depended on trusted
relatives doing the right thing
which have failed because they didn't do the
right thing.
Buying into bars, restaurants, resorts and
ending up with nothing after 6 months.
And plenty of stories of trusted wives and
sweethearts who have
drained bank accounts right under their noses.
The point here is to realise well and truly
that you're not in Kansas anymore, Toto.
This is the
Philippines.
There is a PACK of wolves at the door, and
they all have rabies!
Fail due to carelessness,
scams, excessive optimism and a lack of sound
planning, and you will fall harder than you
ever imagined
you could.
It may leave you bankrupt and devoid of your
life savings, or it may even see you in an
earlier
grave than you expected.
Be cautious and only take those risks you
can afford to live with if they fail.
Don't overestimate your abilities, and know
that you will never be so acclimatized that
you cannot make
stupid mistakes due to ignorance.
And if your savings are dwindling, pack up
and leave while 
you still
can.
