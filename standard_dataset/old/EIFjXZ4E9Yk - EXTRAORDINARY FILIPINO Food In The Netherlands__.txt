it's creamy it's spicy it's really really 
comforting the onions are a little bit um  
almost raw it gives a nice crunch oh i 
love sisig and it's pretty spicy actually

lots of cholesterols i'm going to put 
it on top of the rice sinigang boy
very fat but very soft the meat

same piece of baboy but not so 
fatty with the rice with the kanin
very flavorful it is um time for the 
crispy pata and i think it's very crunchy
it is really crunchy
there's a little bit of skin
oh so crispy but that's why 
it's called crispy pata diba  
so let's try the crispy patta with 
the rice add sisig in one bite
the skin is so crispy um it's fatty 
but you know not too much fatty it's um  
somehow this um crispy pata is a little bit 
leaner it feels feels like of course the sinigang  
the baboy has a lot of fat and also the sisig 
but the crispy pata there's more meat on the  
bone that's really tasty and crunchy let
