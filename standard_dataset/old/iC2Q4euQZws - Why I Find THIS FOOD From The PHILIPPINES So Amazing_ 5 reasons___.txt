Transcript:
yes why i find this food from the philippines 
so amazing to be honest i did not like it  
that much at first but over the years i 
started to appreciate it more and more  
it combines different flavors and textures 
and can be eaten with baboy as well as  
isda it has some healthy gulay 
including masarap na kangkong  
unfortunately no kangkung was available i have 
this substitute it's called bo choy i hope it's uh  
it's also nice it's a pity because i really love 
kang kong but anyway let's try to use this one we  
have to make the best of it right we are talking 
about a dish called sinigang and i will do my best  
to make a super delicious version that hopefully 
will taste like back home in the philippines  
and will bring back those lovely memories now 
what makes this dish so amazing right i will  
share with you five reasons okay first of all it 
is pretty nutritious i mean kamatis and sibuyas  
labanos some super ganda at fresh na talong of 
course some siling haba at okra i'm gonna use  
quite a bit of okra it's nice and fresh as well 
as some string beans and the second reason why i  
like this dish so much is look at all the colors 
it has many colors right very colorful today we  
are not making a baboy version or sinigang na 
baboy but we will be making a sinigang na isda
no Pogi is not the real reason of course joke land 
no reason number three is that this dish is quite  
inexpensive i only paid about three euros (180p) 
for all of the fish the salmon which is a pretty  
uh good deal here in the netherlands i'm not 
sure how much you would pay in the philippines  
but i guess that it's also not very expensive 
there right let's add the labanos yes i know  
i put this pot a little bit too full with 
water i should have put a little bit less  
but let's see how it goes maybe it might 
be okay patis let's add konting patis diba  
to make a little bit extra flavorpul just 
like that at this stage i will add the sitaw  
the talong siling haba i'm just adding those 
sili in look at all those colors and then  
okra um then at last i would add the salmon belly 
because i don't want this salmon belly to be  
overcooked these actually only need like one or 
two minutes so i'm just gonna put them in that  
brings us to reason number four why i like this 
filipino food so much and why it's so amazing  
and that is because it is sobrang sarap diba 
this is really a delicious food a comfort food  
that also gives you energy at least for me 
i feel always energized after eating this  
and so healthy no now where's 
the rice where is the kaning?
the sinigang tastes amazing i also made two 
other versions please go ahead to watch them here
