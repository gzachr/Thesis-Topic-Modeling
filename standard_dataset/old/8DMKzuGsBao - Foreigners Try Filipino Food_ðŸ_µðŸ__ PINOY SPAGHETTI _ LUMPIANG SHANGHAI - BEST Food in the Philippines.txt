Transcript:
it's good i like it i mean it's different but i 
like it i like it it's actually not that sweet  
yeah it's just slightly sweet right so so imagine 
the tomato ketchup without the tomatoes it's  
replaced by bananas i really like this one that's 
delicious do you see i eat the marshmallow [Music]
so [Music]
what's up you guys ilyadji here and welcome to 
another episode of foodie mama ph and we have  
here phil and maya they're gonna join me on 
this filipino birthday theme video apparently  
we just celebrated our birthdays recently and so 
i thought of having them experience the filipino  
culture of doing birthday celebrations we have 
here three items the most popular items that  
you will see in birthday parties yes whether 
people are in crisis there's not much food to  
eat or they're craving for their comfort food they 
are celebrating birthdays filipino spaghetti is  
always always present so if you come to a 
filipino house our pantries always have the  
canned foods we have the frozen hot dogs the 
spaghetti so it's a huge part of our culture  
i mean i asked if you guys have had filipino 
food before never yeah me neither besides chicken
filipino food in general like what did 
you imagine it to look like rice right  
okay fair enough i was gonna say the same thing 
that is very true okay rice vegetables i feel  
like it's just asian culture in general to 
have a lot of that jollibee is one that comes  
to my mind fried chicken i missed something 
out here yeah you're missing something out  
jollibee is like the filipinos version of 
mcdonald's but our menu is full of rice filipino  
spaghetti it is traditionally sweet not the 
italian version i'm just telling you it's filipino  
i just was about to ask because it looks actually 
similar to the italian version except like the  
hot dogs on top red hot dogs this is like an 
icon in birthday parties because it's meant to  
be sweet to serve the kids we cook in huge bench 
for the family so if we're having a gathering we  
will give our neighbors and the neighbors will 
usually ask whose birthday is it so that's how  
filipino culture is yeah spaghetti it's like the 
americanized italian version that has been brought  
to the philippines so during the world war ii 
there's a lot of rations the canned foods and all  
those stuff we didn't have much tomatoes and so we 
had to make banana ketchup wow that has to be the  
main ingredient for the spaghetti and our dipping 
sauces so yeah sweet spaghetti we have here the  
what we call lump shanghai it's the filipino 
chinese snack also always present in every fiestas  
and birthday parties we usually dip it in banana 
ketchup that's what makes the lumpia filipino but  
if you are more comfortable we have here the sweet 
chili sauce with vinegar as well the filling here  
is pork beef and shrimp plus the carrots in there 
as well i think we have to set up the hot dogs i  
didn't know you would eat marshmallows with a 
hot dog in it filipino kids so cute you could  
always go for this so how's it supposed to look 
like you just do that and that's it i'll give you  
freedom to i didn't spew with them very well but 
crooked i put mine like this to make it look like  
heart shape oh oh wow wow clearly i don't think 
through stuff iron man here can stick it [Music]
so why do filipinos do this you know what i 
have no idea oh it looks good and it's always  
the centerpiece in every children's party because 
there's always games to be played there's like  
these hanging toys that we have to you know jump 
up and get okay that's my time or something like  
that it sounds so much more fun than whatever 
birthdays i've had the birthdays that i've had  
it's like okay we like have a few games here 
and there but it's like the normal pinata  
play with your friends with balloons and stuff and 
then sing your birthday song and that's it [Music]
all right okay so i think it's time yeah to 
dig in i'm really curious actually it's gonna  
be your first looking food ever and i'm very 
into pasta actually so yeah yeah okay okay  
taste test i think you should try without the 
hot dog first okay so the meat and the okay  
oh my god i'm so excited i've 
never tried this before sweet pasta
[Music]  
oh my god still rolling
[Music] it's good i like it i like to hear your 
honest opinion i mean it's different but i like it  
i like it it's actually not that sweet yeah it's 
just slightly sweet right so it's not too sweet  
i really expected it a little bit more sweet 
i thought it was gonna be like dessert style  
so it's not too sweet actually so i put here 
some pork and beef as well so with hot dogs i  
didn't intentionally make it too sweet because i 
didn't like it like that usually it's way sweeter  
yes it can be way sweeter depending on who cooks 
it but in my recipe i try to balance it i used  
here a filipino style sauce and an italian 
style sauce but the italian filipino style  
this so i use the filipino style and the italian 
style this is the sweet style that i didn't use  
oh yeah it will be way more sweeter if i use 
that is this from lucky class as well yeah  
lucky plaza get yours today these sausages 
remind me of my childhood as well actually  
in israel we have something similar it's good it's 
actually not as sweet as i thought it would be  
again okay i'll take one more okay cheers [Music]  
it's almost like spam yeah it reminds me of 
the the german it's called venus yeah we know  
something is similar right yeah yeah why is it red 
just for color your side of italian like what type  
of pastas what are the flavors i love pasta in 
general so i don't really like focus on a specific  
area what i really love is amateriana it's onions 
garlic a little bit bacon and tomato based sauce  
really basic but this is what i really like and 
carbonara my favorite yeah with a lot of cheese  
like many response i think they kind of water it 
down because parmesan is quite expensive is it  
yeah so they water it down with i don't know some 
cream or anything i usually don't use cream at all  
it's the non-italian style to use cream right 
yeah that's it how about you maya do you cook
i'd like to think so probably not the most 
appetizing your cheese pork is awesome okay guys  
cheeseboards it's not cooking but but but bear 
with me it's this like super aesthetic platter  
that i make right it's not too bad it's just like 
a couple of cheeses i love truffles so i buy like  
ruffle manchego lots of salamis prosciuttos it 
looks beautiful i was so impressed when it came  
from the plating king himself cheesecakes yeah 
fast burn cheesecakes are a vibe very good that's  
right thank you oh my goodness what about you what 
do you cook like what is your speciality since  
we moved here in singapore we used to cook more 
on the weekends mostly filipino food if you get  
it outside it's gonna be more expensive and you 
don't exactly get the taste that you're looking  
for so normally you would cook yes adobo but the 
one you tried is one of our comfort fruits and  
one of the easiest dishes to make but we have 
this beef stew which we call beef caldereta and  
it's tomato based stew kind of close to beef 
rendang minus the spices with coconut milk  
because we don't use spices in filipino culture 
okay it's more like savory sweet you know the  
basic stuff salty umami super interesting wow 
that sounds really delicious though i've never  
heard of beef and coconut before but that's like 
one of the main ingredients in rendang is it  
clearly i don't cook i didn't know 
that i thought it was like mostly  
spices actually yeah in curries usually 
it's like coconut cream or coconut milk  
so that makes sense i love parmesan right no it's 
filipino cheese processed cheddar fun fact lactose
[Music]
i actually didn't expect you to enjoy this type 
of really yeah because i've always seen your posts  
like the way you cook and playing stuff like 
the king of cooking i love authentic food so  
actually when you texted me we don't go to this 
restaurant it had like real home cooked food i  
was quite happy here next to you right yeah so i 
love this kind of okay to try the real culture i'm  
actually not really into like fine dining but i 
really prefer like casual authentic food awesome  
yeah i'm not starting it i do like going out but 
also it's nice to try different things right as  
you said like this is like traveling but without 
the actual travel yeah that's true and the best  
way to learn a culture is through food yeah this 
is actually how i travel i don't look for sites i  
look for food places and then i go there and then 
when there is a site around okay i look at it as  
well really usually i go for food places and cafes 
you're really a legit foodie how is it with the  
cheese cheddar is actually like cheese to go right 
always have cheddar this is pure comfort food  
on a rainy day perfect after that i want to try 
the lump yeah let's do it so this is pork beef and  
shrimp you see it right yeah prawns rocks yes so 
you're so excited about this is the original one  
sweet and spicy that one is the hot and spicy 
can we try both yeah do you like spicy i do oh  
it's very jelly but sometimes my stomach doesn't 
expect so i can take it but the next day sometimes
okay thank you [Music] so imagine the tomato 
ketchup without the tomatoes it's replaced by  
bananas mm-hmm delicious what like seasoning salt 
and pepper it's a paprika cayenne a little bit of  
cajun oregano what they use the most like [Music] 
like whatever it's mostly laurel leaves which we  
call bay leaves that's like the main dried herb 
that we use turmeric we use it in the southern  
part of the philippines because it's nearest 
to indonesia so a lot of indonesians who have  
moved there have exposed them to spices and 
spicy food what about these dishes are they  
from a specific region or of italy you will 
see this anywhere in the philippines really  
it is a huge part of our history our culture 
colonization from the chinese migrants who  
have introduced the olympia spring rolls to the 
spanish-american colonization this is why we have  
the pastas and the straight-up things that we 
may do of with what we have they're really good  
so for us it's usually like the basic ingredients 
would be garlic and onion so you cook as well yeah  
oh yeah yeah we both cook but i don't like as good 
you don't plate that's good have you seen this  
i heard many times actually i 
would be the perfect housewife but  
you'd love to be wouldn't 
you i take it as a compliment  
he's single by the way guys he's single so 
philip nardoza hey this is not a dating show  
i feel like this is your show 
today the film show yeah [Music]  
let's focus on something else there's a lot 
of filipinos who would introduce foreigners to  
balut it's exotic it's a delicacy and it's an 
aphrodisiac not all filipinos eat them i don't  
introduce that i mean i would love watching you 
try it mostly eat it at night but aphrodisiac  
that's why vendors will just go around the village 
and balloon i want to scream and you know okay  
there's piping hot opening and then the soup is 
like oh i just want you up okay i need to be more  
open minded you should travel to the philippines 
oh i wanted to get something to do after covered  
after coconut which one sweeteners out of the 
three sauces i think the spice one i like this  
especially with like spring 
rolls or like french fries  
mcdonald's french fries with the sweet garlic 
chili it's almost sweet so just a great garlic  
that's it so this is made out of banana yeah it's 
not meant to be like as sweet as like a sweet  
banana yeah but because the recipe is like bananas 
and then the usual ketchup recipe which includes  
vinegar sugar and spices present in every filipino 
dining tables for dipping sauce or pasta sauce  
this is so cute happy birthday guys happy birthday 
happy birthday happy birthday you're celebrating
thank you so much guys so much confidence pick 
your wieners the beautiful ones wow wow so film
okay how do we eat this with a marshmallow so all 
together just yep [Music] so it's um sweet and  
salty interesting is it strawberry flavor yeah is 
that normal to have strawberry flavored mushrooms  
for kids yeah and the color they like pink yellow 
compared to the white ones yeah i love the white  
ones though just marshmallows on the stick 
and just roast it because it like caramelizes  
so good this is very interesting 
kitty parties always has this and  
they had to make it because the tradition 
is gone but this is for kids usually is it  
like young kids and kids at heart this is so 
sweet though it is very good hot dogs honey  
did you even see i ate a marshmallow 
wow because she was trying to feed
[Music]
it's really interesting the sweet and the salty 
good word yeah it's a good word to describe it  
because it's not like i don't even know how 
to describe the taste what would you describe  
this thing sweet and salty it's just contrasting 
flavors yeah she's enjoying it so much what an  
interesting experience this is so awesome 
thank you so much for having us this is so  
cool to try proper because i've never actually 
heard about what really filipinos eat besides  
adobo and this is like legit any comments on the 
first filipino or second filipino food experience  
winner winner winner that's all i can say i 
also would say like this but in general like  
everything was good if i had to decide pick one 
i would definitely drink this one yeah agree yeah  
everything was really good as well i totally did 
not expect the pasta to not be as sweet as like  
what people say it would be even the sauces like 
the fact that it's made out of banana really blows  
my mind yeah super cool that's it guys for today's 
video i hope you follow them on the gram as well
