Title: First Impression of Boracay in 2023 ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­ My Parents have NEVER seen Blue Water Like THIS

Transcript:
 
good morning guys and today we're here in the airport  yes so today we are actually flying to Boracay  
so it's a place a top bucket list destination 
that we've always wanted to go here in the  
Philippines and this time we get to travel 
with my parents so it's really interesting  
experience quickly give you guys a brief idea 
what happened just then we came to the airport  
using a grab so it's very convenient and after 
that we try to check in luggage everything was  
all good the luck he's just saying was exactly 
20 kilograms so we put to 40 kilograms in total  
so it was just right and we come for two hours 
earlier so now we just have a lot of time before  
we go to our plane it's easy today the airport 
is completely packed yeah with lots of people in  
the background so the thing I want to say about 
airports here in the Philippines is especially  
Manila you always need to know exactly which 
gate you're going which terminal you're going  
inside I mean which terminal you're going just 
because from one terminal to another terminal  
it's a rather far distance so you need to catch 
a taxi buses yeah and most airports that we've  
been to around the world usually they will have 
like a train express train but here I don't have  
oh my goodness look how many people there are 
in front of us absolutely insane every seat in  
this airport has been taken luckily now we get 
four seats we can sit together now yeah crazy so  
many people today oh we come to Cinnabon 
place to take some few cinnamons and eat
I really love this place so please see everything 
a lot of people today so we finally find one  
small table there can I get one mini barn one 
classic cinnamon and then one strawberry custard  
for here please oh and three latte delivery
this is your delivery uh mini Cinnabon 
strawberry custard and this is a classic  
Cinnabon thank you waiter this is YouTube 
okay bye-bye so this is actually Alina's  
favorite brand yeah yeah it's work usually 
when it's warm winds is good what's up
all right guys so welcome to Boracay welcome 
and we already arrived yes and next few days  
we're gonna spend our time here in Boracay it's 
actually a whole week here in Florida guys we're  
gonna have a really relaxing section this trip 
is just going to show you the most beautiful  
part so in the Philippines yeah we will have 
amazing experience here in Boracay the dress  
and family because for me it's also first time 
meeting Justin mama and Justin Mama partner yeah  
so I hope it will be a cell phone all right 
so because I guess we're in a tropical island  
that's why the even baggage claim it's quite 
unique so you can see lots of people who are  
standing here waiting for the bags already so 
they just drive one of these parts and pulling  
the luggage and just pass you over the luggage 
one by one like this okay let's take our Hotel
okay yeah so interesting really first 
time seeing this in my life it's okay  
bodies yeah so nice don't have to hold it by 
ourselves I will tell stuff thanks you're very  
nice so they come in and pick us up at the 
airport and they're carrying out back so it's  
really since we started traveling together many 
of you have been asking us how we save money in  
our travels for example how to find cheap deals or 
get better price in Flight bookings whether it's  
International domestic or hotels if you ask me the 
same question when I first started traveling I'll  
tell you I opened all the tabs on the browser and 
opened every single Airline website and compare  
the prices between different airlines which is 
super time consuming and inefficient which brings  
us to today's video sponsor kayak we always try to 
look for cheap deals when possible and kayak has  
some great deals for example we actually booked 
our trip to Hong Kong through kayak it was 7  
000 pesos for return Which is less than 150 
dollars apart from the website Kaya also has  
an app so I use that app more actually so 
I'm gonna go to the kayak app I'm gonna  
screen record this so you can see this and so 
then if you've got a particular destination  
in mind so if you want to go to Hong Kong 
then you can just type it in here somebody  
Hong Kong and you choose a period of time you want 
to travel to so July to August that sounds good  
and then go to kayak so because kayak is a meta 
search engine so we'll show you the whole list  
of flight details that you can choose from 
but if you're like me and usually want to go  
with the flow and you want to be spontaneous 
about your travels you can also use kayaks  
explore feature if you've got a geography you 
can probably go around the map and just see all  
destinations that you want to go so like if you 
want to see how much is going to I know Europe  
maybe then you can see the exact price here or if 
you're not good at geography then you can go to  
the list and you can just scroll through all 
the destinations and know the exact price in  
the period of time that you choose to travel so 
another thing I really like about a kayak app is  
the trips feature the reason why is because very 
often when I arrive in airports sometimes I have  
to pick up my phone scroll through all the emails 
and find the booking confirmation show it to the  
airport staff but you don't have to do that so 
you can actually go to trips feature here so in  
upcoming trip we're actually going to Melbourne 
Australia so stay tuned for our Australian series  
here you can see the Melbourne trip and then 
if you press on it you can see all your flight  
details and booking confirmation so it's a lot 
easier rather than scrolling through all the  
emails if you're planning your next trip somewhere 
and want to save money then check out kayak to  
find great travel deals now let's see really 
Boracay is so famous and why you're so famous
wow so beautiful it's like a highway on the side 
of the ocean along the ocean it's a beautiful  
really beautiful weather so I hope the next 
few days will continue to be like this and  
in Manila it rained for the last few days but 
here in Boracay the weather looks really nice
so the ones in front here these ones are 
called tricycles so as you can see it's a  
motorbike on the left side and on the right 
side those ones are like a passenger cut  
five three three four no I can see a lot of 
people actually uh I don't know but last time  
when the two of us got in there was like no this 
is not two passengers it is five people five six  
can be five six ten I don't know people sit on 
the top it's very interesting when we purchased  
the airline tickets to Boracay this airport 
is actually called some called Malay airport  
or something so we thought we booked around five 
because it's too it was Malaysia like why is it  
Malaysia but anyway the airport this area is 
actually called Malay and this District name  
where the airport is called katikan and now 
from here to the main boraca island where all  
the resorts located you need to take a ferry 
so that's why now we're heading to the pot and  
I'm gonna take a ferry to Boracay main island but 
first can I borrow your IDs please yes of course  
how was your flight yeah it was quite short 
felt like a yeah very short flight I'm good
so the best thing about staying with clothes 
is that you also get direct private transfer  
instead of taking the ferry so you actually 
get one of these private speed boats that take  
you from the mainland of Malay directly 
to Boracay so this is our speed boats
yeah sounds good ready
wait thank you hello interesting here 
hello everyone hey good afternoon how  
are you hello oh okay so good afternoon 
ladies and gentlemen welcome on board  
the coast and will be where you will be 
with directly from katikan to Costa Rica
thank you
hey how are you thank you wow wow again 
hot weather yeah beaches and palms palms  
tree sunshine and vitamin D and coconuts most 
importantly yes give me more on vitamin D this  
is what you can expect if you come to Tropical 
Islands here in the Philippines especially Boracay  
the most beautiful and well renowned beaches 
yeah Maldives they say it's like the exactly  
it's blue water white sand beach this is what you 
can expect you can come to the Philippines hello  
good afternoon you guys go first we have to walk 
from here yeah we will be assisting me going to  
Hotel hey take care of the bag sounds good thank 
you good afternoon thank you yep no worries so  
just now on the way here we actually came directly 
from the airport as you can see so luckily there  
is a private transfer and also there is a private 
vehicle transfer from uh just then when we arrived  
the main broker Island to the resort now so it 
makes it a lot more convenient wow so beautiful
so big waves how
then we're working on a category though the 
alley are this sort of blue water and this  
is what I call it the Gatorade water you know 
the drink Gatorade this is exactly the same  
color yeah oh my goodness and the white sand 
beaches really you can call this white sand  
it's not like brown mix or whatever it's white I 
think this is probably the whitest scent and also  
the bluest water we've seen in the Philippines 
actually so this is the answer why everyone go  
to Boracay yeah this is exactly I would say it's 
very developed here in Boracay just because they  
are designed specifically for tourist Services 
just because every year every month every day  
there's so many tourists around Boracay this is 
a really ideal destination for tourists to travel  
to so yeah this trip my goal is really because my 
mother she's been watching every single YouTube  
video that we made so I think she's been looking 
forward to she's been telling me that she wants  
to come to the Philippines so finally she's 
here welcome Hey thank you thank you very much  
wow we've got some cool towels welcoming drinks oh 
that's for you yeah thank you thank you very much  
is this your first time yeah first time Boracay it 
looks amazing here yeah it's just windy right now  
it's still good to see so later will be better 
less windy would you think so because right  
now it's the monsoon season here sometimes it's 
windy but there it is that it's actually calm yeah
a play
yes ready to see the room all right let's 
go wow so far I'm liking the design of  
this hotel it's quite aesthetic black and white
sounds good foreign
awesome oh they need to knock knock who's there
wow
it's so cool wow this is the first time 
ever I see our photo on TV I'm on TV mom
it's amazing yeah they said they said the 
hats the slippers they all for free so you  
can actually bring it home sanitize 
them maybe it's a good smell yeah
yeah it's good still thoughtful so now I give 
power to my professional room tour Justin to show  
you this are you guys ready no sorry I guess ready 
all right so here's a room tour in Boracay so this  
hotel name is called Coast so you guys have been 
asking us a lot about like what kind of hotels we  
stay there when we go traveling so this hotel is 
Coast let me give you guys a room tour so this is  
our room for the next few nights yes yes so we've 
got a big double bed here so it's amazing I think  
it's king size two three wait how was it oh it's 
good it's soft that's good enough soft approved a  
proof all right that's good and of course on the 
left side here we show you guys we this is big TV  
so they took a photo of us just then next to the 
ferry so I got names here as well it's absolutely  
amazing all right let's head into the toilet 
to see what's the deal all about in bathroom
and spacious bathroom that's my impression 
yeah very sebaceous shower space as well I  
will change now my old cap for my new 
cap and it's honestly looks looks nice
looks nice yes
ah do I look like anime character now
all right so we just came out from our hotel 
Coast so it's very cozy and now we're gonna  
go and get lunch we're actually going to 
somewhere around the hotel just to see the  
restaurant options because our first time in 
Boracay my ideal meal in Boracay on a tropical  
island it's always coconut from the tree and then 
some really delicious Seafood meals fresh drop  
from the ocean has to be Char grilled though it's 
like chocolate shrimp grilled squid then they'll  
be perfect it's amazing so yeah let's see there 
are many restaurants Cafe options here it seems  
like we've also got some recommendations from 
some of our subscribers here in the Philippines  
what do you two want to eat today anything any 
specific now it's lunch right lunch or lunch or  
lunch and then we'll have to seafood dinner 
later okay maybe maybe we can eat something  
lighter now and then tonight we're gonna have 
a big Fish seafood dinner yeah that'll be nice  
like grilled yeah I was telling them I do dinner 
Seafood Coco or not yes she said we need to drink  
oh yeah because we've got two bottles of wine 
exactly yeah okay let's find some fruit to eat  
now and relax a bit I think today is all about 
showing you guys the beauty of Boracay I hope  
you guys first time in the Philippines you need 
to try and dogs which is a famous place for uh  
chicken especially it's like in nasso chicken if 
you can see the chickens spinning at the display  
window already you become very appetized you 
want to eat already come here come to this window
I mean just look at this I mean 
you know I mean oh my goodness
back to you back to ah it is a really 
windy day to blew my head off just in  
but uh yeah they say now it's like 
a monsoon season that's why it's a  
little bit windy oh look at them yeah a 
cute couple in front of us look at that
oh all right so after a bit of walking 
we found our lunch technically it's not  
lunch here so it's four o'clock right now so 
our food for today it's Cafe maruja which is  
one of the saved destinations I saved 
on my Google Maps it's recommended by  
my subscribers here in the Philippines 
so let's head in to see what the deal  
about it is I think you're just gonna get 
something like hello people please okay
Jaguar how many white boys with nothing but 
fakes after we sat down we had a look at the  
food options and the menu itself looks 
pretty amazing the food arrives fairly  
quickly so we ordered a few dishes this time 
the egg Benedict two fish and chips and some  
grilled scallops the Benedict Was a little 
hard but overall the food and Ambience here  
is great so I recommend checking this 
place out if you're here in Boracay
after food when I come to a beach area 
first time in a Boracay Beach and today  
a little bit windy so we have a lot of 
waves yeah I think to be honest this is  
like this strength of wind is actually great 
for surfing and also I guess sunset time now  
Asian people start running out of here Asian 
people start running out just because escaping  
from the Sun now it's like a good time to walk 
around a beach now I see what it means Boracay
I'm gonna try the water test water
refreshing I guess yeah refreshing 
it's not not ice cold not warm but  
refreshing it's like your beer just now
your beer not as cold it's like after you 
hot drink it for a while with that kind of  
temperature that's nice go I'm okay 
I'm okay it looks a little bit cold  
wow you're so beautiful in this camera in 
real life too I mean in real life too oh
boy ah so bright this this side this 
side this side that's a good fighting now  
yeah so bright here I cannot see nothing yeah 
yeah you're right I look a bit homeless today  
the only opposite yeah considering the wind is 
blowing to us this way wow it's really fast man  
his lights maybe he's he's going the wrong way now 
surfing surfing oh so this is what he's been doing  
no is it no he's been trying to serve like this 
he is all right yeah he's been trying to serve  
more information about borokai so this famous 
white Beach that we're currently own stretches  
four kilometers long and is divided three boat 
stations one two three according to our experience  
and research station one has the best and finest 
stretch of white sand in the entire Island and is  
also where most luxury resorts are found it 
is also quieter area competitor station too  
station two on the other hand is a convenient and 
busy area with lots of people where you can find  
the more and there are collection of shops and 
restaurants lastly Station 3 is a less crowded  
area competitor Station 2 where you can find 
cheaper Resorts and comparatively it has more  
greeneries this is what this trip is all about 
just like seeing my mom and her partner having  
a good time enjoying nature and everything yeah 
it's really it feels nice as a son to see like  
she's having a good time just taking a break away 
from the hustle and bustle back in Australia when  
she works every day in front of computer and now 
she gets to spend her holiday with the loved ones  
as the night Force we discovered something 
interesting on the beach we found a woman  
who was sweeping the beach with a device so out 
of curiosity we went and talked to her foreign
so just now the woman that you saw she was 
kind of using like a metal detector swiping  
the floor so that is actually his full-time job 
so this job basically she's trying to find metal  
underneath the sand right is this your job only 
only this oh Yeah so basically she said everyone  
two times yeah one or two times in three months 
you can find something valuable like a washer  
ring and it could earn her up to nine thousand 
to ten thousand peso one time but usually the  
most common metal that she can find under the sand 
will be small points like one peso like 50 pesos  
Etc and also I asked her what kind of things she 
finds most expensive things you said it's a rings  
so taking was something so expensive and she 
find it technically she's not sealed she just  
it's just like it's just lag yeah someone someone 
lose someone fine someone's unfortunate becomes  
someone's luck yeah next time we went to in 
Boracay is a seafood market called biha but  
the reason why we're there is because there 
are five shows every night and if you order  
from any of these restaurants they will help 
set up a front row seat for you if you're in  
Boracay then you must try Jonas fruit shake the 
shakes from here are absolutely amazing and even  
the straws are edible unfortunately Seafood 
was a little bit overcooked but a fight then  
saved the night we were super impressed by it so 
here are some highlights from the show outside
temperature
oh
yeah yeah they're not getting pregnant
wow
hahaha
thank you
