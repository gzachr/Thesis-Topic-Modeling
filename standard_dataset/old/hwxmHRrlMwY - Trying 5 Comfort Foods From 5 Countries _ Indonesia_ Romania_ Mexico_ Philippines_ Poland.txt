Title: Trying 5 Comfort Foods From 5 Countries | Indonesia, Romania, Mexico, Philippines, Poland

Transcript:
- Oh my gosh.
oooh
Oh my goodness.
Oh, oh, oh, oooh.
Hi, I'm Beryl.
And the theme of this
video is, comfort food.
On my community page, I asked you guys
what your favorite comfort
food was and where you lived,
and so many of you responded
with such amazing sounding dishes.
The thing for me is,
is that comfort food is
specific to the person,
what my comfort food dish is,
is not going to be the
same as somebody else
who even lives next door to me.
So instead of me presenting these
as this is what comfort
food is in X country,
I went through, picked a couple of dishes,
that I thought that I could recreate
and asked the people who
submitted them to present them.
So in this video, it's
not just gonna to be me,
it's gonna to be other
people from this community
which I think is really fun.
And I hope it's something
that we can continue to do
to share our cuisines and our
culture is with one another
'cause that's really what
this channel is about.
The first dish that we're
trying is from Poland.
So with that, I will step aside for now
and allow Igo to explain it to you guys.
- Hi, my name is Igo and I
am from Wroclaw in Poland,
as some of you may know
it is a country in Europe.
Today, I am here to talk about
my favorite comfort food.
This comfort food is a
little gnoochi-style,
you would say potato dish
which are called kluski slaskie.
They're about this big.
This is my favorite comfort food
because it reminds me of my childhood.
My great-grandma used to make them
whenever we gathered on Sunday dinner.
And, it just tastes so good
and it tastes like the
feeling of comfort and safety.
And whenever I'm feeling down,
I asked my girlfriend to make some,
and it just brings so much
joy and excitement to me.
It is a common dish,
but mostly in South and West region
as it is a Silesian dish.
The kluski slaskie basically
tastes really starchy
and they are really elastic I would say.
They are usually served with red cabbage.
Also, the kluski slaskie
are covered in gravy
and it tastes pretty nice.
- I am very excited by this.
Look at how cute and
they hold all the gravy.
I definitely get how a dumpling
is a comfort food for sure.
Oh my gosh.
It almost has a mochi like texture.
It's kind of chewy.
I do often feel like Eastern European food
gets a bit of a bad rap.
When I lived in Russia,
I loved the cuisine
but I don't think many people wax poetic
about Eastern European food
and they should, it's good.
This is cold winter comfort food.
I totally get that.
I really want one more.
I'm just gonna have one more.
This is not like new Yorkie.
It's not it's its own thing.
And it's glorious.
Okay.(chuckles)
- Hi, I'm Lindsay,
I'm from Manila in the Philippines.
And my favorite comfort
food is champorado;
a Filipino chocolate rice porridge.
Growing up, whenever it would rain,
this would usually be served in our home.
And eating it just brings back
a lot of good childhood memories.
It's a very rich, chocolatey,
sweet and creamy dish.
This is usually paired with a
salted dried fish called Tuyo.
And, kind of like how some
people eat their French fries
with ice cream,
this gives it that perfect
balance of sweet and saltiness.
This is eaten all around the
Philippines as a breakfast
or as a mid afternoon snack.
- It's interesting.
I never thought I would be
eating a chocolate rice pudding
with a fish.
Ooh, that's nice.
Very chocolatey, but
like a rich chocolate.
So not like a milk chocolate
more like a bit of a bitter chocolate.
Okay.
I'm already understanding why
this fish is going to work.
I'm not really sure if this
is how I'm supposed to do it
but, okay, it definitely works.
The salty and sweet combination, is good.
I bought the fish kind of like pre fried
at a Filipino grocery store.
I find that there should
be a little bit tough,
I wish it was a little softer.
However, I do like it together.
Show you the head.
Oh, okay wait the head look the most part.
I'm not going to lie,
of all the dishes that are in this video,
this was the one that I was
the most kind of curious about
on my own, I would have never had this.
If I saw it in a restaurant,
I probably wouldn't have ordered it
but here I am learning something new
about it cuisine and about myself,
and I like that.
Really so cool.
- Hi, I am Andreea,
I am from Bucharest, Romania,
and my favorite comfort food is mamaliga
with cheese and sour cream.
This is the perfect comfort food for me
because it always takes
me back to the simplicity
and safety of my childhood,
when my grandma used to
make this dish for me.
Imagine this huge, warm
and steamy plate of polenta
waiting for me.
And, I say huge, because as
you probably already know,
I think it is a universal thing,
every grandma ever has
this irrational fear
of their grandchildren ever being hungry
and my grandma was
absolutely no exception.
This dish is absolutely delicious
because it combines everything
that the comfort food needs,
and by that I mean, of
course, carbs and fat.
So, the polenta mixes
in with the sour cream
and makes this creamy and fatty delight.
While the cheese provides texture
and has a very flavorful and savory taste.
Mamaliga is very common in Romania
as it is a simple, quick
and affordable dish.
It can be eaten as a dish in itself
or we use it as a side dish
to other traditional meals.
- So this is mamaliga.
It is an essence Romanian polenta
and I can totally
understand why this would be
a comfort food creaminess and saltiness.
I'm very excited to try this one, gum.
Oh my goodness.
I have never made polenta before.
It is a lot of work.
You have to stir it nonstop.
And one of the big things,
that's the test of a good cook
is how many lumps you have in the polenta
and I'm not a chef okay.
I'm just trying my best out here.
I wouldn't say that this
is, you know, perfect
but it tastes really good.
Polenta is definitely something
that I think it's very intimidating,
but when I actually did it
the dish came together
super, super quickly.
It wasn't a big time investment
and what the ingredients
were like three things.
So you don't have to
really go out of your way.
If you want to try some
Romanian, polenta, mamaliga.
Last bite.
You know that you like it
when you're like scraping
the bowl for any last bits.
I can definitely get how
this is comfort food.
I feel very, very comforted.(laughs)
- Hi, my name is Jaklyn
and in Jakarta, Indonesia.
My favorite comfort food
has to be soto ayam.
It literally translates to
chicken soup in English.
Each province in Indonesia
has their own take on soto or soup.
But I'll be specifically
talking about soto ayam today.
When I was a kid, my mom
used to make the whole family
a big pot of soto ayam,
for us to enjoy on a rainy day.
So, every time it's raining in Indonesia,
I always find myself craving soto ayam.
The taste of soto ayam
is very hearty and rich
because we use chicken bones in the broth
and a bunch of aromatics and spices
just like tumeric which gives
soto ayam it's yellow color.
Soto ayam is very common in Indonesia.
You can find it almost anywhere,
from street vendors to
fine dining restaurants.
And everyone loves it,
especially on a rainy day
because it's like a big
warm hug to your soul.
- Okay.
Soto ayam. It smells so good.
My neighbor actually told me
that the whole floor of my apartment
was smelling really good.
So, yeah.
Oh, I think this might be one
of the best chicken soups I've ever had.
The flavors, are so good.
It's tangy.
It has a little bit of spice.
The lime juice gives us really fun,
like acidic punched all the spice in here
and the breath is just warming
and the spice fills your whole mouth
and just makes you be like, "I need more."
Like my crazy taste buds are
like, 'Give us more soto ayam."
Hey tastes buds, calm down.
I very, very much like this.
- (Maricarmen speaks Spanish)
- So, this is sopa de fideo,
and it's actually something
that I've never tried,
but I've heard about and
had always wanted to.
I've never had vermicelli
as a noodle and a pasta.
I feel like I've only
ever had it in a dessert.
Ooh, ooh.
The flavor is really nice.
I think in general, soups
are going to be comforting
no matter what.
It's kind of not like
you're never like so hot
and like happy and
excited and you're like,
you know what I need? A hot soup.
So this is like a tomato based soup,
but not like a tomato soup.
If that makes sense.
This was so easy to make.
I think that's one of the
things about comfort food.
If comfort food is complicated,
it is no longer comforting
because it involves a
lot of stress to make.
It's 43 degrees Fahrenheit,
six degrees Celsius
outside today and it feels
like the start of winter,
and so eating the soup
is just making me feel
kind of like bring it on winter.
I'm ready.
I've got my warm soup here.
I don't care.
Make it snow.
Yum, delicious, noodley,
soupy, comforting.
You can quote me on that.(laughs)
I really liked filming this video.
Not only because I got
to eat amazing foods,
but also because I got
to talk with you guys
and learn so much more
than just by researching
on the internet.
And I don't know, I just feel really lucky
and I'm excited to keep doing this.
So with that, I will see
you all in my next video.
And if you have any requests or ideas,
of course leave them
in the comment section
because as you know, I read them.
So that's it, see you guys.
