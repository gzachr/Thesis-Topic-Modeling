Transcript:
you know it's very safe here like like 
what you can see in the news that that  
yeah people say you have to be careful it's 
dangerous yeah we have a lot of terrorists  
it's not true it's not true guys I 
also didn't experience so far what  
I experienced here is that everybody's 
very kind and welcoming so what another  
thing here is like everybody's looking at me 
because I'm I don't know how are you brother
so yeah definitely get that 
feeling of like I'm pretty  
much the only Foreigner here right now you know
what's cool about being on these small little 
islands is you're always right by the water you  
know what can you say is special about tawi tawi 
what is what is that I love you I love you I love  
you top of the morning from top of my hotel 
here in tawi tawi another beautiful day on  
this remote island in the middle of nowhere 
actually it's actually like the last island  
in the Philippines if you look at the map of the 
Philippines I'm pretty much at the edge right by  
Malaysia so it's been just a really different 
experience so just a little view from the top  
over here you have some trees on this side
geez gotta be careful here it's a lot 
of hazardous items we have a mountain
it's beautiful guys as I've been saying 
in my last video and then on this side  
you got water what else do you need look at this
today I'm gonna go discover what 
more this town offers maybe walk  
around the downtown area talk to people 
and discover tawi tawi a little bit more  
it's places that's so different and remote it 
just takes time for you to kind of like settle  
it in into your own mind and realize that wow 
I'm actually here so that process is done now  
now I'm ready to go discover a little bit plus 
it's my last day I wasn't here for too long so  
let's go so yesterday I was with uh one 
of the guys that I met here right by  
I was at a shop by my hotel and he kind of gave me 
a little tour which I showed you guys as well we  
were riding around but today I'm gonna walk around 
by myself and kind of discover this city for
like a dangerous place because if I haven't really 
felt that um you know I've just felt kindness  
Hospital hospitality and just overall yeah I 
just haven't felt what most people have told  
me about this place so let's go see for 
ourselves I need to find like a tricycle  
or a taxi so I can get to the middle of town 
because it's a bit far from where I'm staying  
but look at this guys look at the cows 
we're literally in the middle of nowhere  
it's the most remote place I've 
ever been to in the Philippines

water but it was super super peaceful and quiet  
a feeling you don't get in most places 
because you know obviously with lights and  
cell phones and all of that I 
don't have Wi-Fi in the hotel so  
it was very kind of like quaint and peaceful 
to not be attached to my cell phone and having  
Wi-Fi the whole time so it's really nice here

so guys when you walk through this you really  
do feel like you've been put into a time 
capsule and transferred to another time  
like I don't feel like I'm in 2023 anymore 
aside from the clothing and things like that  
the architecture the structure and the overall 
lay of the land really does make me feel like  
I've entered into another time so it's honestly 
just a really really amazing feeling to get this  
because die how are you brother because 
these are the kind of experiences that  
really you're not gonna get anywhere besides 
a remote place all right don't worry brother  
so these are the kind of experiences that 
you're not going to get anywhere besides a  
remote place like this you know most places 
have been commercialized and brought into  
modern times right but this still holds its 
original Essence and that's a beautiful thing  
hey how are you brother good to you I saw 
you before yeah I saw you at the airport  
yeah nice to see you again it's such a small 
town you just keep running into the same people

this area Welcome to our place thank you so 
much I'm making a video about tawitawi I'm a  
vlogger yeah yeah so so uh what what would you 
like to say about uh uh very Improvement place  
it's a great place yeah it's a great place what's 
your name I'm up in stocks nice to meet you bro

so everybody's super kind man  
now the thing here is there's not a lot of like 
choices of restaurants and things like that you  
know it's mostly just like places to buy raw food 
like hello Hi how are you so it's it's mostly like  
you know you buy like your fish you buy your eggs 
you buy your chicken and all of that and then you  
just go home and cook it you know it's like really 
old school there are a few restaurants and things  
like that but mostly it's like you know kind of a 
hi guys how are you mostly it's uh like um just uh
yeah mostly it's just like 
very old traditional kind of
so what another thing here 
is like everybody's looking  
at me because I'm I don't know how are you brother
so yeah definitely get that feeling of 
like I'm pretty much the only Foreigner  
here right now you know which is always 
a maybe some people might get off to that  
but I don't know I always feel a little bit 
weird being the only Foreigner in a place
but everybody's so kind the women the men 
you know and usually a lot of times like in  
Muslim places I know because being Muslim the 
women are a little bit more like conservative  
or you know afraid to like break out of their 
shell but here they're they're very open and  
actually strong business women as well how are 
you brother so let's go this way I don't know  
where I'm going but just taking a walk around 
oh there's a coffee shop nice gongao coffee shop
hello assalamualaikum oh wow they're 
cooking fish Hi how are you this is a  
this is a coffee shop yes you 
make coffee yes oh very nice

so this is uh I can sit down oh it's a 
it's a little coffee shop here and we're  
gonna sit down and get some coffee 
thank you how are you brother good
so it's not like a special Brew or anything it's 
just an instant coffee but hey why not sit down  
at a local coffee shop it's a great way to get an 
experience being with the locals how are you sir  
good plan are you from uh what what can you say 
about you I'm making a video for YouTube about  
this uh about this place so is there anything 
that you would like to say about that something  
special okay yeah it's a good place and peaceful 
yeah because many people say oh you have to be  
careful it's dangerous but I don't think so I 
think it's safe yeah it's peaceful very good  
thank you sir thank you oh and what's this wow 
they give you so much stuff oh okay so basically  
I think they give you a bunch of foods so I can 
just have one no problem this one it's too much
oh I think I'm supposed to only eat one 
or whatever I want because uh it's a lot  
of food so excuse me ma'am uh this is 
all for me but it's too much I only need  
okay I think I'm supposed to only one I don't 
know let's see so they give you a thing of hot  
water and you kind of just make your own 
coffee which is what I'm doing mix it up  
and I have all of these Foods in front 
of me I have no idea what any of it is  
I have no idea what this stuff is looks like a 
local kind of snacks but let's try one whatever  
this is I don't know what this is looks like 
kind of like a piece of bread or something okay
it's like a donut tastes like a donut
it looks like this what's this yes
and this I don't know what yeah
everything's bonbon tawi monkey

of this because this plate right here is given to  
everyone they give every customer that comes 
in gets this plate now you don't have to eat  
all of it it's just a courtesy they give you all 
of it and then whatever you eat you pay for it

well my second time trying 
Fried Chicken here in WWE  
hard to say they know how to make a good fried 
chicken and the quality of meat is good too
who's watching me like where is this guy from
so if you want to experience something that's 
really different and Off the Grid in the  
Philippines you have to come to dawitawi and as 
you see most people are really kind and welcoming  
I haven't felt in danger once 
here anywhere I've been so
it's been quite nice got my coconut
now if you had told me two years ago that 
I'd be on the last island in the Philippines  
in the middle of the downtown sipping on a 
coconut while eating fried chicken I would  
tell you you're crazy but somehow life 
God has brought me out here to experience  
these amazing unique experiences and I just feel 
like I'm so blessed man to be able to experience  
something that most people will probably never 
experience that to me is really cool uh how much
for you no problem yeah thank you 
thank you alrighty so got my coconut  
and um yeah man it's been an interesting 
experience walking through this downtown  
just talking to people and this is what I 
try to show you guys I try to show you the  
rawness and the realness of content I don't 
do that you know same old thing that going to  
Islands only and sitting on beaches like this 
is my ideal kind of content I try to show most  
they come to places oh when I see that they 
come to Philippines they're just doing islands  
and stuff but my goal is to always show you 
the realness of the places that I go to and  
talk to people and have real experiences so 
that's what I'm doing here today that's what  
I was trying to show you guys I hope that I 
was able to depict that well for you guys so  
yeah so I'm going to uh sign out on this 
one had a nice time here in uh the downtown  
of Bongo hello bro can I uh can I um uh
