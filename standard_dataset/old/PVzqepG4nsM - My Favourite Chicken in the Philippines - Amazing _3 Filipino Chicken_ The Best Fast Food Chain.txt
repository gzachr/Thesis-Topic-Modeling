just then I can see it's uh behind

were made so really delicious looking
ah they've got rice here like you 
see that one there let me look at  
the menu again let me look at the menu again
hey can I give you the wallet yeah all 
right it's your money for this week  
thank you alright anyway let's have a look 
around so just then we didn't look at the menu  
too in detail but let's have a look at the menu 
so they've got chicken inasal over there which  
is chicken drumstick uh and then you've got 
pork sisig we've had that the other day but  
it's with pork belly the other day and we've got 
bangus sisig hello how are you and palabok oh  
I I think I asked you guys one time um what's 
palabok and it's like glass noodles with some  
some sort of sauce I forgot what sauce it is 
but they've got two eggs there we're lime as  
well oh you've got a chicken inasal with the palabok  and they've got barbecue skewers you've got  
grilled liempo liempo don't know what that is what's 
liempo and Yep this I think this is the most  
um ordered dish here at this restaurant um so 
the top sell out that's what I meant what's PA  
oh pa means large maybe and that's what we 
ordered peco pecho and we've got another one  
and we've got oh that's a big one so it's a mix 
of everything palabok with the chicken with rice  
and this one is similar as well I think this is 
what we all just said is it like a whole chicken  
and family Fiesta ah looks like some sort of 
interesting rice it's like risotto down there but  
I don't know what kind of rice that is I actually 
didn't realize that you guys are lucky I just said  
I don't know if you're going to see the menu but 
hopefully you can but yep you've got many options  
here got skewers here as well this actually looks 
like a really good meal for maybe four people at  
in a family and you've got Halo Halo which is sold 
out unfortunately but um what else do they have  
crema de leche halo I love it too bad because this is 
what we came for kinda hello hello but uh I guess

empanada
It's my chebureki
uzbekistan chebureki
it is uzbekistan kitchen chebureki
Is it exactly the same?
Looks like the fish ice cream actually 
looks like the fish ice cream
you guys know 7-Eleven there's 
fish ice cream but this chicken  
smells exactly like exactly like 10 
years ago when I first came to Cebu  
when I first came to Cebu it's like the roast 
chicken on the street it smells like that oh  
your dreams wait me wait me I go to toilet I'm really glad we 
came to this restaurant because just saying there  
was one little bit we thought we might go to 
a different restaurant but really glad we came  
here because this smells amazing sounds like some 
sort of like honey grilled chicken I don't know  
if there's honey in there but it smells amazing 
but I think here it's very loud so I don't know  
if you guys didn't hear me yep standard 
mix like syrup Coca-Cola um but anyway let's  
put my camera on the side so you can see me enjoy 
this chicken so I just realized here everything  
is so served so we've got gotta grab our spoon and fork and
everything so I'm gonna watch our things here yeah
fork and I think we might need a 
spoon as well I think so that's it
alright
alright let's eat don't 
forget to wash your hands
no I am gonna eat with spoon and fork actually 
thats the thing I always  
hmm dont want to food poisoning again right? true true
sure sure yeah after last time maybe 
not okay fine I'll go wash my hands
good angle
oh
[Applause] yeah
if I'm wrong
you hungry now?
like my grandmother cooking at home 
wow same taste  
really so this is what Cuisine is this again?
[Music]
yes yes
Yeah so good, I was not expecting that
It is better than chicken when we order at home
remember you want a chicken? like the same
oh yeah oh remember guys that one time when we 
ordered food Panda chicken and we got scammed  
and what they only sent us the like the chicken 
but no rice this is 100 mor tasty yeah and it's  
like it's more affordable and it's more tasty 
and this I told you guys before coming to the  
Philippines like only memory when I was a kid 
was actually coming here when I was 10 years  
old and my memory was going to Cebu and at the 
roast chicken because when you're young you don't  
think of a lot of things you just remember 
all the food. What?what is this oh is it the
I like it. It tastes good
yeah amazing good recommendation guys 
they're amazing I believe this is one of the best
meals in cebu so far. Mang Inasal, not just in cebu
tho, this is all over Philippines  
why you only eat chicken without rice. oh shoot I forgot the chicken is too delicious
You know the chicken is so delicious when I forgot about the rice
I only ate it one time
let me feed you the food will never 
arrive in my mouth if you feed me
this girl
anyway the chicken is amazing 
here I love it really really nice I  
wasn't expecting this really once again 
don't judge the book by its cover because
when we looked at google maps
we didn't think it would be this good the food 
didn't look as good as this I guess especially  
because we saw how they do it so that you 
can see like how they grill it just then in  
that window it makes the whole experience 
different it's like you know when you go to  
high class Japanese restaurant you know if 
you see how they do the food then you like  
wow but you don't see it and you only see the 
finishing product you'd be like oh it's okay yeah
I think this might be one of my favorite 
meals in the Philippines so far oh my  
goodness the chicken here so 
delicious love it this dish
guys mang Inasal. national treasure
You guys are so lucky. You guys are so lucky
oh so nice chicken. so nice chicken. tonight I cannot sleep I think tonight I cannot sleep tonight I will just
think about the chicken. In your dream only your chicken

I can really enjoy it like chicken or like 
chicken I'm so happy wow wow wow we believe  
that there is actually a guy somewhere there 
putting a bucket handing out mashed potatoes
is it rice or potatoes I don't know
oh is it rice or potato is 
that rice or potato that's rice  
uh okay no worries I was right. I know you want potato. wait so they
