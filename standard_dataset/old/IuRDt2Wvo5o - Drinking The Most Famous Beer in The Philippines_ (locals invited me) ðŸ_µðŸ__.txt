Ah, no way the camera cut out.
Literally.
I'm so having so many issues with this camera
overheating with the heat here.
Cockadoodledo.
Where are you mate?
You oh, he is in the bottom.
Hello.
Um, but uh, you didn't miss out much.
We just had a short little conversation
about cocks, about fighting cocks, the chickens,
but, um, yeah, I'm feeling alright, guys.
Not sure how much of that you saw having
so many issues with this camera lately.
It's overheating, because it's so
hot here in the Philippines.
Look at how much I'm sweating.
It is crazy, but you didn't miss out on much.
We were just talking about cocks.
I like fighting cocks chickens and stuff.
Apparently like a big, uh,
area, like arena that they actually
do, like the chicken fights with.
So we were chatting about that.
And then I was like, I've had almost all this beer
need to put it down and, uh, get on with my day.
But that's the thing.
I love it.
I actually walked past
them when I was going to get a haircut
earlier this morning and they offered me a
glass of beer and I was, ah, I'll come back.
I'm gonna go get a haircut.
But when people, uh, like, you know,
offer me something with the, without the
expectation that they're gonna get something
in return, I always give back to them.
So a small cup of, uh, beer ended
up into five glasses for them.
So they're gonna have an interesting night ahead.
It is a Friday.
So maybe we'll check in with them later
tonight and see what they're up to.
But it's just so fun here.
Everyone's so kind, so willing to have a chat.
And it's really good, uh, like chatting
to the local people and getting
to know a little bit about life.
But as I was saying, I've not drunk for a while.
So I think, uh, gonna head back to my hotel now
and, uh, pass out  but, uh, yeah, we are probably
gonna finish up this video here, just a short
one. Tried red horse for the very first time.
And it actually is a very delicious beer.
I actually do rate that beer and I
could see myself drinking it, uh,
on occasions, right by the beach.
Imagine that you're on, El Nido on the
beach in paradise, drinking red horses.
I don't think life gets much better than that, but
we're gonna finish up the video here, everybody.
Thank you so much for watching as always chase
your dreams and we'll see you all in the next one.
Goodbye.
