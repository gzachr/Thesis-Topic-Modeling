so this is the Bacolod barbecue they said I 
don't know they said it was from Bacolod so  
I don't know if it's the truth or what 
the deal is but it's the pork barbecue  
looks amazing I got the soy sauce 
we're gonna dip it in let's try it
oh my goodness I like that crispy chewy  
it's obviously barbecue so it's got that 
smokiness on it the 45 pesos for One Piece too  
okay so here we go so this is the chicken skin 
they told me this is the traditional Filipino  
and it's got the coconut vinegar in there and it's 
got um some spices in there it looks delicious and

oh that's so good oh my God that's delicious I 
love the vinegar sauces here that's very good  
just got vinegar it's a little bit spicy it's 
fatty and crispy it kind of melts in your mouth  
at the end that's nice thank you so of course they 
got the music bump in here and they did some super  
copyright music so I'll try to film as much as 
I can but I'm gonna have to probably stick to  
the corners because in the center it's too loud 
they got the music covered too well thank you

actually have too too much flavor  
um but that's good I like that and here's 
the Esau Esau the chicken intestine
it's a little bit chewy I just got the 
charcoal flavor on it there's nothing  
really like nasty about it that tastes 
good and then finally we got the liver here
oh that's good crunchy not crunchy but like 
crisp on the outside but it's tender when  
you bite into it that's nice it's got the 
liver flavor to it this is all good hey so  
I bought this thinking that they made it there 
but it's just the powder but I got the orange  
right here which I guess it's like kind of like 
an orange juice it's vitamin C orange so we're  
gonna try and see what it tastes like and then 
finally we got the orange seed vitamin C Orange

that kind of tastes like a high seed like  
um like they were old orangutan commercials 
back in the U.S I see that's good I like that
