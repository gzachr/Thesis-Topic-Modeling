The myth of the rich foreigner from Australia
The rich foreigner!
An important topic to both overseas Filipinos
and to their Australian spouses In short,
most of your relatives in the Philippines
think you and your Australian husband are
rich and have an
endless supply of money.
They also think it's OK to share in this wealth
freely.
And if you're part of an
Australian Filipina relationship you need
to learn to deal with it.
All foreigners are rich
There is a concept going around that everyone
who lives in Australia is rich.
The same myth applies to
America and other foreign countries.
Anyone who lives overseas has a money tree
growing in the yard,
and nothing is ever too much for them.
They have everything, and of course they will
share it with you.
It's only fair after all.
There is no understanding of the cost of living
in Australia.
No one could imagine you having to pay
$300.00 or more per week in rent, or the cost
of owning and running a car.
A cappuccino costs you $4.00
to $5.00.
A beer could cost you $7.00.
Steak costs you $20.00 a kg at the supermarket.
There are no
cheap tricycle or jeepney rides.
Yes, maybe you earn $1,000.00 a week, but
it disappears fairly quickly.
No one realizes that.
And there is this concept of being entitled
to share in the good fortune of a relative.
What's mine is
yours.
They would and have always shared what they
had with you, and given that you have more
to
share then of course the ball is in your court
to be more generous.
Fortune smiled on you, therefore it's
up to you to help out the family members and
to spread that wealth.
Pasalubong
Pasalubong is a Tagalog word which describes
gifts and handouts that a returning balikbayan
(returning
countryman) is expected to bring with them.
And relatives will often descend on the house
of the
balikbayan relative expecting this.
Children are sometimes encouraged to ask "Where
is my gift?"
I
know!
Gets on my nerves too!
But if you get annoyed, you will end up with
a room full of confused
people.
This is one of those cultural differences.
As an Australian it never occurs to you that
you have an
obligation to purchase gifts for everyone
when you travel, but here it most certainly
is.
Even taking a trip
to another town in the Philippines means purchasing
things to distribute on your return.
Snack foods
such as pili nut candies, dried mangos, buku
pie, chicharon, etc as well as caps, tshirts,
ornaments, etc
are the usual.
And it doesn't end there.
I've heard of cases of relatives going through
the suitcase and just helping
themselves, and of saying "I like that shirt.
Can I have it?"
And of course expecting to be taken to
resorts, restaurants, etc during a visit and
to have the bill taken care of.
How to deal with the pasalubong mentality?
Like always, this isn't meant to be a criticism
of Filipino culture, or a "Aussies know best"
rant.
This is
purely cultural, and cultural differences
can be confusing and can cause misunderstanding
when
interpreted according to our own cultural
conditioning.
If you grow up having been taught to never
ask
someone for a gift, and you hear a kid literally
demanding one?
It makes the hairs on the back of your
neck stand up.
And if you grew up fiercely independent like
most Aussies did, you find the concept of
someone wanting to share in the wealth of
others a bit of a shock.
Aussies are proudly independent, and
generally have a don't-take-handouts mentality.
My wife sees her elderly parents.
They won't ever ask for anything, however
they appreciate it when
they're given a couple of thousand Pesos.
Mila gives as a sign of love, and they take
it as just that.
We
used to visit my mum when she was still alive,
and Mila would always try to indirectly stock
her pantry
without her noticing because she knew she
would have said "No thanks, I'm fine!" if
she had offered
money or anything at all really.
So Mila would place new bottles of shampoo
in the bathroom, and
"forget" when we left.
She did the same thing in the food cupboard
too.
Well, my mother DID notice and
no she didn't like it.
To an Aussie it means saying she can't cope,
and an Aussie would rather do-without
than to take charity.
But as I've covered before, the Philippines
is an interdependent country.
People depend on each
other, and they see no indignity in letting
those who care about them take care of them
when they
need.
And even if they have less need, the fact
that someone remembers them means everything.
Sadly though, greed exists and money can corrupt.
And poverty combined with jealousy can
bring out the worst in people.
Again, how to manage it?
Try to see the difference between those who
just enjoy that family-
thing and those who are parasites and opportunists.
Because yes there are those greedy users and
abusers around, and every family seems to
have a few.
The more they get, the more they want.
And try to educate them about the realities
of your life and let them know that you also
need to
budget and live within your means just like
they do.
