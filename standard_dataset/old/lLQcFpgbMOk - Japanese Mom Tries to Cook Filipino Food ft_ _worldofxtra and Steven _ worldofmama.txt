I've never used it before. :P
Let me wash it.
Stan

Oh, sorry. :P
The reason we're drinking wine is...

So, the 2 of us we'll drink.

Please keep supporting my content <3
Why are you drinking it like hot tea?
- It's yummy!
- Right?
(they're such a mess HAHAHA)
Wait, again again!
ANYWAY!!!
Did we explain anything?
No...
IMPROMPTU!
We're doing everything on the spot!!!
ON THE SPOT!!!
Huh?
We're making sinigang today!
We have a LOT of meat!
Do you guys see everything?
Get a big pot!
You do as I say!
First, wash your hands!
The VERY QUICK version.
Okay, soap your hands.
Anyway, put all the meat in (LMFAO)
Wait, really?!
Like this? All of it? Really?
Now, add water.
A LOT!
MORE!
Lid :D
3 seconds?!
and, GO!
This, 0.5 seconds.
One, okay done. :D
This one, 1 second.
QUICKER!
ONE!
Squeeze hard ONCE!
Don't fool around! >:( 
You're wasting so much!
This house is so clean wow.
Because yours is dirty. (LMFAO)
Okay, don't touch it anymore.
I wanna break up the meat.
No, stop. -.-
STOP!
When the meat is stuck together, it looks bigger. (HAHAHA)
STOP!!!
Chopping board!
Meat side.
Vegetables side.
We don't even need to slice it. Just dump it in.
Okay, go dump it in.
I'm just putting things in. Am I even cooking.
Let's open this.
I'll do it.
See, I failed :D
First, put everything in here.
For three people.
Do you know how to do this?
Yes, yes, yes, yes.
I don't like too much bell peppers.
More.
Really? I like it.
Because it's bitter :c
IT'S NOT.
This brings out some flavor.
The knife is only for opening the frozen vegetables.
The meat is nice and tender.
It looks hot!
It's not!
It's still a very bland pork soup right now.
It's like a nice warm broth soup. :D
It's very warm :D
Okay, please add all the vegetables.
Dump it all in!!!!
We usually chop it. Not today though! :D
(YAAAAAASSSS!!!!)
We're celebrating your 300k without you HAHAHA
Yeah, we're drinking to it.
The 300k boy wasn't invited at all....
When it boils, add the fish sauce.
After it boils some more, done!
Why add the okra last?
Because it dissolves if you boil it too much. 
Easy, right?
Why is your pinky up like that?
Some people are like that, huh.
I always do it on purpose.
You just want attention?
Yes. :D
You want people to ask what's going on?
Yes. :D
Oh, the apron is really cute!
Next time, we need to call over Stewart too.
Ikr.
He's a little bit far, but still.
My little Stewart.
Can you mix it once.
Let's add the okra!
What is it called again? Pork sinigang?
SINIGANG NA BABOY
Why are you speaking Filipino all of a sudden.
It looks yummy right?
It looks so yummy!
Pork Sinigang. So yummy! (Cebuano)
Time for a Q&A!!!!
Wait, who...
Umm... you.
It boiled!
Lower the fire!
Fish sauce and lemon!
We usually use Tamarind. But we don't have that in Japan.
So we used squeezed lemon or pre-squeezed lemon.
It's super easy if you just use this one.
I just added 3 seconds worth of lemon
Usually, it's just 1.5 seconds. :D
Fish sauce, 2 seconds.
2 seconds, okay? One... Two...
You can add more when you eat.
It's true. Why are you laughing?
REALLY?!
It's done. Close the lid and turn off the fire.
And it's done!
salt?
We don't use too much salt usually, right?
It's better than if it were too salty.
How do you know how to cook Filipino food?
(HAHAHAH)
Wait, REALLY!??!
Yes, it's true.
Let's make BEEF soup next.
Let's buy like a HUGE chunk of beef.
We're gonna have to buy a bigger pot.
It's your favorite!
BULALO (name of the dish)
When I buy a bigger pot, I will try.
Do a little taste test first.
Time to eat!
It's good!
Thank you so much for watching!
