Title: i tried FILIPINO 7 ELEVEN and fast foods in MANILA PHILIPPINES

Transcript:
Good morning, guys!
I am in Manila in the Philippines
Right now and a lot of you guys have been requesting me to make you fast food video while I'm here in the Philippines
I've got two places in mind that I
Really really want to try the fast food from. 
One of them is one that I love and I've done a lot on my channel
And the other one is something that is so popular in the Philippines. They-- all my viewers from here
have been practically harassing me to try this.
So I'm excited to finally try it and see if it's gonna be that delicious like
Everyone says it is so we're gonna head outside and get some delicious food. I hope you guys enjoy it
So this is my very first stop. This is Jollibee.
Everyone from the Philippines said that I have to come here.
This is like the most popular fast food place in the Philippines. I also I keep on calling it / Jobeelli /  instead
We're gonna go in. but I'm not sure what kind of breakfast slash lunch food
They've got because it's kind of a weird time
I love they've got is giant bee as the logo
so
We're gonna go inside and see what kind of stuff they do and then I might bring it to my hotel room and eat it
Later, so I'm trying to decide where I'm gonna get but the menu is insane
They've got practically everything from spaghetti to fried chicken just something that is called a burgers steak all right so here
I've got my order
Thank you so much
Jolly bee, and we're gonna go for our next stop
And then we're gonna go and eat everything and this is my second stop
Which is 7-eleven because I know so many of you guys like to see what 7-eleven is like in different countries
So I just got here, and this is the foods that they do they've got chicken nuggets fried chicken
And they also do some fried bread. It's all gone
So this is the only thing they've got which is the ham and cheese fried fried, so I might actually take this in the chocolate
I might get the tiny ones oh
I'm gonna give the tiny one of the paper. There's the same flavor dude this one is the swamp graceful
All that cookies in cream looks delish
This place in here I was walking back to my hotel room, and he found another 7-eleven, so let's go and check this one
But mine will go for the fried chicken soup already got a lot of our chicken from the other place
I definitely want to try the chicken nuggets and the burgers if that's a burger and they've even go more here
So these are like different flavors of sausages Wow that looks really good
I'm back in my hotel room and even though this is like a
Breakfast last lunch and a meal I got a lot of stuff
Do not judge me when I go to places and there's something that I've never tried. I always go a little bit extra
Honestly, this is some of the best smelling fast food that I've ever smelled you know sometimes fast
We just go that chemically like smell to it, but I love not judging but sometimes
It's got that very artificial smell this smells like actual food
So I'm very excited to try it as you can see I've already tasted the spaghetti because he looked so good when we arrived that
I just had to
Mmm
This spaghetti is so incredibly delicious. It's a little bit cold now, but still good. It's got some pieces of sausage on top
Hmm
We've only tried one thing and I'm already
Considering moving to the Philippines that spaghetti tastes like a fancy Italian restaurant spaghetti
I'm gonna use the same fork for everything do not judge me
I make really bad life choices
So if you're gonna judge me you're gonna have a very hard time from my channel the jollibee guy said that the most popular dish
Is the steak burger so it's is it a steak is it a burger?
We're gonna find out you're gonna eat it with a little bit of rice. I think the burger or steak comes in like
this gravy mushroom sauce
Oh
my god
The actual steak tastes very very good
But the star of this is the sauce this grape this sauce is so good that I'm honestly
Considering going back and asking for a glass of it so I can drink it mmm, and their rice is pretty good as well
it's like a sticky rice see almost it's almost like a sushi rice, but not really slightly longer I
Was not expecting this, but I prefer this over the past and any day, this is honestly very very good
I can see why this is the most popular one so here
You've got the jollibee fried chicken and also some more rice with a little bit of gravy on top
But I'm gonna skip the rice because I already tried it
Live spicy bomb
hmm
KFC better be sure because they're coming for their brand I do love the chicken it is very very spicy
I ordered the spice you want because I mean I am in the Philippines might as well go for spicy food if I'm gonna do
It anywhere before we get into my favorite. Which is probably gonna be the hotdog
I'm gonna try the cheeseburger on this burger looks very different from McDonald's
It looks a little drier than the McDonald's burger and it's also going to creamy like white sauce
It also came in this box with a little Pikachu because I am 12 years old on the inside
Is this is this the same meat from the steak burger I feel like you might be
I've been in so many places all around the world and the sauces on the Philippines fast-food are just the best
100% this white sauce is so like buttery it's like a very
Improved version of mayo I would happily have this every day for the rest of my life time to try the hotdog
I'm very happy about this hotdog because if he ordered will it be this fast with hot dogs in America
They never come with cheese, and they actually added so much cheese in the Philippines on top of the hotdog
And that's the way it should be
Hmm I
Don't want to sound like I'm repeating myself
But this also is is once again the best part the sausage is very very good as well
It's a very soft sausage it tastes different than most sausages
But I am easy to please but I can also guarantee to you that this would be delicious for anyone
And
The last thing to try before we move on to the 7-eleven foods is this chocolate mallow pie. I think that's what it's called
It's chocolate and marshmallow inside like this outside. That is kind of like the apple pie outside from McDonald's
We're gone
Just wow no trying to create drama
But that does put the McDonald's apple pie to shame and I've probably got a lot of
Chocolatey my teeth now and I'm so sorry I'm gonna try the 7-eleven fridge
This is a fried bread like how incredible is that it's gonna be so greasy
And if I don't like it you guys can get upset
It's actually not greasy at all
It's actually very very dryer Notary if you guys can see but it's got so much cheese in ham in the center. It's
Absolutely delicious. I'm not gonna lie. I am so full already so this is gonna be enough food for like the whole day
But I'm gonna try these chicken nuggets now
It's probably because I'm so used to the McDonald's chicken nuggets, but these are definitely not my favorite
I would prefer the McDonald's ones any day, but they're not terrible
It's just a different consistency like the chicken is very tough, so when you bite into it. It's more solid than I was expecting
And the last savory 7-eleven food
We've got to try is the CEO power volleyballer
And I think it's supposed to be chicken and egg on the inside of like this like a dumpling outside
It's really good, but I definitely got the wrong one. This is pork and not chicken
I don't think but I do really like it I
Mean you can't really see on camera, but there's something white in the center
I'm not sure if it's chicken or if it's an egg, but it tastes really really good
I really really enjoy that and now for the sweet things. I think I've tried this one in America
I'm just gonna confirm. If it's the same one just for science
I
Think the one I tried in America was like in giant donut
And he was all like donut like dough so he say
But this one is filled with custard on the inside so this one's a lot better than the one I tried in America
I love both obviously not trying to create any drama, but this one is a lot better so here
I've got the cookies and cream donut
The dough is very good, it's very very light, but the flavor is just just not very chocolaty and not very creamy I
Mean I'm just gonna eat it
But I was expecting it to taste like an Oreo flavor
Donut and the last thing I want to try is what are these tiny little dough balls
I think the lady said this was chocolate, so I'm not sure what the outside is
Not sure what that is on the outside, so I go like a candy Brad make sure I
Do really like it though. I always keep you real, and I gotta say
Then jollibee is a lot better than 7-eleven foods
Well obviously it's also probably more expensive, so that kind of makes sense I did very much enjoy both of them
