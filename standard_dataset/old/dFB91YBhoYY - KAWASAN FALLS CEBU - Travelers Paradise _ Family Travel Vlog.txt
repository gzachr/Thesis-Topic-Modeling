Title: KAWASAN FALLS CEBU - Travelers Paradise \ Family Travel Vlog

Transcript:
all right we just got to Kawasan falls we have to walk about two miles or
something
I'm so excited to see what this plastic
thing looks people and we got the best
days so far I think since we've had been
in the Philippines so that's like a
let's go guys already on this episode of
trying something new we're going on an
epic trip to Calais on falls we heard
this place is like heaven on earth we're
going to explore and fish ourselves as a
family but make sure you stick around to
the end because we're gonna tell you how
much this whole day of adventure costs
you are not gonna believe canyoneering
is definitely one of the most popular
things to do in Calais on fog but since
we have three little ones I don't think
we'll be doing any 50-foot cliff jumps
all right we just did ready to go 90
pesos to go check out kawasan falls it's
pretty good deal back
so this is a walk sun falls 25 minute
hike to get to the first level of the
fall there's a pause guys come on guys
one thing that we can definitely
recommend is bring lots of food and
snacks because you gonna get hungry on a
banana spring roll here for 10 paisa we
were going sugar Hong are ten pesos this
is gonna give us the energy we need to
get to the
the stage okay
a guy in the middle of the jungle
climbed up to the mountain and you got
some honey out and I was selling it for
250 pesos oh yeah
maybe on the way back down I got too
much carrying right now which is about 5
bucks for a whole day that's a fresh
honey the Stinger is in and everything
that was so scary
one of the kids couldn't conquer their
fears of the rope swing comment down
below and let us know which one you
think it was writer Nixon or Skyler
so you're supposed to be able to take
these rafts out to the Falls which we
were so excited to do but for some
reason they're not doing them anymore
does anyone know why they stopped doing
this so there's two more levels up above
these Falls and it's just a rope swings
up there and or the
nobody goes up there cuz it's a little
bit harder that's probably a good thing
we figure we'll go to the best first
because the first level is packed so we
are going to check out the one with the
rope swing because everyone of all
jazzed up about that really cool on the
way up here
early three
I'm starting to have a love-hate
relationship with these bridges I love
them because they're fun but I hate them
now because they keep getting smaller
and smaller
as soon as we got to the second
waterfall Nixon spotted the rope swing
and started to swim for it
these kids are capable of amazing things
if you just don't put limits on them
I don't know where the bottom is kind of
sketchy and it's about 50 degrees we're
swimming up
all right everybody made it across the
treacherous ravine but now we have to
trust the dreaded bamboo Johnny's are
polar down don't let him go down what do
you think it's good it's good
all right everybody made it across here
got a clock the treacherous law
sometimes little brother tries to keep
up with his Big Sisters and he gets
himself in a situation once Ryder got up
there there was only one way down there
all right mommy all right Ryder why are
you so scared
rydym is not a happy dude at the rope
swing
rather you do it and now we're heading
for the third level
sometimes life will put obstacles in
your way
and you have to make a choice we always
try to push through whatever it is and
see what awaits us on the other side
and once you get to the other side there
is a whole new world to explore
oh my god I want to carry Ryder all the
time what happened
one of our favorite things about
traveling is meeting so many new people
we have found that when we travel it is
so much better to have an open mind and
an open heart because you come across
such beautiful people
thank you thank you thank you
we just made it to the third level of
campus on fall
and this is what I'm talking about this
is awesome it's beautiful
just like the last waterfall Nixon
didn't waste any time finding the rope
swing that girl isn't animal
like
so maybe rather than have enough courage
to do the rope swings but he did find a
water slide with his name on it
it's Redemption time
yeah
now that's funny because I read the
reviews and it said yeah it's a book you
feel like a bumpy ride exactly
I'm this right here all right we came up
to number three we conquered number
three it was good before we lose a kid
we started probably started getting out
here we've got a long haul home probably
about three miles down the steep
treacherous train and I know I got a
carry ride to the whole way so would you
leave why we're still a little bit ahead
all right so I told you to stick around
to find out how much this adventure cost
the entry fee was $2.00 bucks the sweet
potato on a stick was 10 cents
the Lifest rentals were it's two dollars
the rope swing was 15 cents so all in
for this amazing adventure for six hours
connecting as a family and conquering
fears it was a total of four dollars and
25 cents if you guys like your videos
