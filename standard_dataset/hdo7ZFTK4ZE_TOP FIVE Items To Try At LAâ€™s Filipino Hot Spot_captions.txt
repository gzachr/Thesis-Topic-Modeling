Man, if you're looking
for some Filipino food
with the volume turned up
all the way to ten,
then look no further
than Big Boi
out in the Sawtelle
Japantown neighborhood
in Los Angeles, California.
This sweetheart of a chef,
Barb Batiste,
is serving up buckets
of Lumpia Shanghai
and Filipino butters.
The Filipino comfort
food vibes are hitting
different at Big Boi
where they're serving
big portions with big love.
So let's get into
the tasty deets.
Here's my favorite
items at Big Boi.
Number Five favorite item
here at Big Boi
is this big handsome
bucket of
Filipino Spaghetti.
I love Filipino Spaghetti
because it's got that
sweetness to it.
You got the hot
dogs pieces in it.
Got the cheese on top.
Now what makes Filipino
Spaghetti uniquely
Filipino is the use
of ketchup, sugar,
and a meaty sauce that
consists of ground beef
and hot dog slices.
Now the origins of
Filipino spaghetti
harken back to around
World War II,
where a shortage
of tomato supplies
led to the advent of
banana ketchup
and the introduction
of sweetness via sugar
plays to the
palates of Filipinos.
Get it in this size
so you can share
with all the homies.
Just dig in and
get this sweetness.
You get the saltiness
of the bolognese.
You get the hot
dogs slices
and you get the cheese on top.
And it’s beautiful.
Number four favorite
item here at
Big Boi is their butters.
They do this
all house made.
And it's a Pandan butter,
It's an Ensaymada butter,
And it's an Ube butter.
All on this
Ube waffle.
It is seriously
incredible,
the flavors of
these butters.
And they ship
these out
so you can buy them
on their website.
Look how pretty that is.
It's insane how much flavor
is in these butters.
And it's got little
Pandan pieces on it.
Incredible.
Number three favorite item
here at Big Boi
is this bucket of
Lumpia Shanghai
Now if I'm at a Filipino party
And this is being made
I'm sneaking up some
pieces to myself
as it's being made
because they're
that damn good.
I can pop these
like chips.
Now let's just say
Lumpia is the cousin
of the spring roll
and we could
probably trace those
origins back to when
Chinese traders
went to the Philippines
way back when.
This is so good, hand rolled
every day at Big Boi.
Number two on the
Big Boi hit list
of favorite items here,
the Silog plate.
Silog is one of my
favorite things
to eat on the face
of this planet.
It’s basically a Sinangag
which is the Si part and
that's garlic fried rice.
And Log which is itlog
and that's the
egg right here.
And it comes with
two proteins.
I chose the homemade SPAM.
They make it in-house
and the homemade longanisa,
The rice is super
garlicky like that.
That's when you know
what's right
and you've got the
homemade SPAM all
Thick like.
Again, go back
for the scoop of
the rice and the egg.
So that it's complete.
This is one whole
Savory party, man.
That's a hearty breakfast,
but that's how you
should start your day.
My number one favorite
item here at Big Boi
is this crunchy piece
of fried chicken.
You got to dip
it in the gravy.
That's the crucial
maneuver right here.
And then just sink
Your teeth in this.
Whoah!
It’s perfect, man.
Okay.

favorites at Big Boi,
