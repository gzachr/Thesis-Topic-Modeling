hello guys, we are in the Philippine and we just met with the group of people and as you
know that I'm Iranian and I am with a group of Israelis. And of course an Italian and Austrian
But they are not as fun as Iran and Israel . We are going to have some adventure today
and we are going to a waterfall and canyoneering
There are two waterfalls
Really!!! yes ohoh 
We are geared up to go to waterfalls
Yesterday we met a couple and decided to take a tout and didn't ask about the tour and apparently we are going to waterfalls
it's not just one waterfall  it is going to be multiple waterfalls and  multiple jumps some of them are very heigh
We can't bring our camera and that is why we switched to GoPro
whatever you see from now on it is GoPro and let's see what we can do 
I am not scared. I haven't really jumped
higher than four meters but they said
there is waterfall higher than 10 meters to jump
I want to be able to travel I don't want to break my legs. yes next week we are going for scuba diving
this place is good you have a very beautiful view of the sea
I think we are half an hour far from the waterfall
Everything here is a surprise. They explained but no one in the group got what we are suppose to do
We just know that we should jump. For now we are hiking and enjoying the view
I think I'm just going to jump to the water because I am so hot
Can you see me ? I don't think so
We are going to eat finally. I am so hungry
right now you are going back to the van, where we put all of our stuff
The view from this side is so beautiful even though we are now going to the water but
it's amazing I think the cliff I jumped was 10 meters
At the beginning I didn't think I would be able to jump, but I did it
