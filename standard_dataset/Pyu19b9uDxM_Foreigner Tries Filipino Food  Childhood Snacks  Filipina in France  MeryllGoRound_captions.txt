Hey! What's up, you guys? It's Meryll! Not
going around anywhere because we're
still under quarantine. If you're new
here, hi! My name is Meryll and I'm a
Filipina living in Paris and this is my
boyfriend, say hi!
Hi!
Sorry we are so awkward
This is our first sit down vlog and I
just dragged him because I'm
bored
Okay. So, for today, my Swiss boyfriend will
try Filipino snacks or Filipino Chichirya.
The first one we're
going to try is Chicharon so this is he
chose the chicharr√≥n
so keep your on this board why are you
scared oh my god is good really it is
actually quite a movie but it's really
nice and they put this on top of budget
fella don't think I would eat at the
movies mmm that's true so what do you
say about the Cheetah Run is it the
thumbs up or thumbs down
so the next one we're going to try is QP
chippy BBQ this is actually good I think
this is my dad's favorite I'm also gonna
eat because I also miss having and
thanks Floyd salt me for some reason
hello put soy sauce in my bar because
it'll kind of make sense again you like
it it's corn chips darling okay so this
these are our necks of garlic flavor so
voyons boy and volunteers martin garvik
boy so it's garlic boy yes boy
I think you like this really likes
garlic flavor birth favorite things the
garlic is strong with this one
don't need this before they are these
guys don't use my bow before anything
the boy was not the stink with you you
need a voice nice I used to eat this up
there school and I would sit with
primary school
it used to be expensive I don't know how
much how much this costs now but it's
been a while since I'm home area where
it's if I bought one myself better yet
let's collect texture of this one
why do you why do you like everything so
the next one he's going to try is Tommy
it's mostly like corn oh my god you just
noticed that everything else boy names
that's kind of we should have that girl
name - cheerio
Tomi that W net thumb yet I don't know
tell me you know okay so this is sweet
corn so they're just like corn chips
actually this is also very nice
I feel like I just bit into it or is it
not nice is one of my favorite ones by
the way I expect it to taste differently
it's a bit more on the student side yeah
very much
the next we're going to try is the
teacher on you mom who was but this is
also the Orca no in fact this is equal
to 0 that's vegetable base yeah he is
really mock pork cracklings it's
supposed to be like walking pork but
it's not really for the flavor is so
come on bomb if you like the teacher you
might also like this
this is one of like the more expensive
period they compared to like fury and
Cobra chips this is a bit more expensive
oh my god it's over my heart
you have to eat them
yes this is like a thumbs up okay a very
interesting choice
oh the next one we're going to try is
mr. chips and this is um nacho cheese
flavors or chips so there's they're like
nachos with cheese
be honest you guys a part of me is quite
enjoying this come on so mr. chips is it
the thumbs up or thumbs done the cheese
flavor was really my favorite okay I
feel everything is my thing we're going
to try is $79 this is from so cool I
think a lot of the dried mangoes come
from Cebu they have the best quality
great value and crabs there
good stuff
you associated with anything tastes like
crime animal I kind of think that it's
quite similar to dried apricots here
thumbs up thumbs down you drop okay so
that doesn't sound the origin also key
like solution the next thing we're going
to try the house of father on we don't
have the original favor this is the
peanut butter founders look enemies
honestly I haven't tried it also I've
only tried with the different flavors of
houses over there in general the cashew
I don't I can't remember
cookies and cream I think but anyway
we're gonna try this or he's gonna try
it
so it's valid a really so it's you need
actually to open like a flower it's a
special feeling do you like it okay so
we're down to our last quote rice no
snack so this is pickle and I'm super in
love with this I actually ordered two
tubs of stick oh so this is the original
flavor in stronger you may have tried
another flavor of this okay so it was
book opened and exigent some chocolate
for some reason so this is the person is
actually going to try the chocolate
stick okay so every time you went in the
sari-sari store you were the first one
to get the stick oh it's really special
to get the plastic one one because I
don't know it is the first hole it's
there so that it's easy to pull it off
so and then here in desire sighs oh my
god you know you're not supposed to
touch another failure
if you want the desire sorry story would
have had to pay $5
I think what drive might well be okay
