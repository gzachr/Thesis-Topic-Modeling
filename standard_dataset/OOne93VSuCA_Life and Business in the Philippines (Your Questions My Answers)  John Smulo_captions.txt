- (upbeat music)
- So this next question is
not so much of a question
but more of a challenge.
So, uh, there's something that I think is
in Bisaya could be Tagalog
I honestly don't know
uh but they are challenging
me to say five times
as quickly as I can.
Here goes nothing.
I can just leave it there?
- Yeah
This thing's really a
beast, which is awesome.
Got it!
Ready? Steady! Go!
So this episode is going to
be a little bit different
than past episodes that have came before.
I asked you guys to let me
know if you have any questions
about my life here in the Philippines
and you were kind enough to
send in a number of answers.
So stay tuned. I'm going
to answer your questions.
I just remember my first
impression really being
about just how much
different the scenery was,
uh, but then also very quickly
after meeting Filipinos,
just how truly different they
were than where I was from,
where I'm from in the
U.S. people here are just
incredibly kind and easy
to talk to and friendly.
You can really just almost go up to anyone
and they might be shy here,
but they're still gonna talk
to you and be helpful
and answer questions.
And so overwhelmingly, I'd
say my first impression had to
do with just how different,
so much looked, but then
also just how very friendly
and kind everybody was here as well.
Being here and, and really
establishing the company here
was one of the main reasons
why I decided to stay
in the Philippines for good.
The second reason though,
is that my manager, Grace
that's so much a part of
helping us get started
in the beginning.
Our relationship grew and grew.
And to be honest, the more I
went back to the U.S. the more
I missed being away, not just
because of the business, but
because of her as well.
So those are really the two
main reasons why I decided to
stay in the Philippines for good
One was business, but two,
maybe even a little bit more,
maybe a lot more was Grace.
All right so another
question, how was living
in the Philippines during the pandemic
(somber sigh)
That's kind of how it was, you know
living in the Philippines here
has really been a challenge
during the pandemic.
There was whole months at
a time where I would leave
where I lived maybe once every seven days
sometimes once every 10 days.
And when you're someone
that's used to being
outside a lot and breathing fresh air
and living in a place that
has a lot more square footage
than most places do here,
it was a lot different.
So there's been some wonderful
times during the pandemic.
And there's also been a
lot of challenges as well.
I don't know the exact numbers
but there's been huge amounts
of the expat population
in the Philippines that
have left during this time.
And it's really, I think, on the whole
because they just got so sick
of how strict things were here
and they wanted to have
a little bit more freedom
and they wanted things to
be a little bit more normal
in their everyday life.
And at times I gotta to tell you
I really feel that way as well
I'm trying to learn to be more patient
not, uh, an especially good
skill for us Westerners
and something that I'm
still trying to learn
from Filipinos that truly are
able to handle tough times
and challenges so much better
than people like myself.
So I'm grateful to be
here, but it's a challenge.
as well.
It's the people, I really
genuinely love the people here
at times they're a little
bit difficult to understand,
you know dealing with
relationships personally,
and with work and in everyday life
driving so much is truly so much different
between the U.S and
between the Philippines
but when it comes down to
really how I feel about that
my favorite things about the Philippines
by far is the people here.
I've learned so much life is,
I was going to say a lot less stressful
but, I think that life here
is probably as stressful
as living in the U.S.
but in different ways.
I think the kinds of things
that stressed me out living
in the U.S. were kind of
bigger picture things, you know
people and work, and everyday
life there. In the Philippines
the things that are stressful
are more just adjusting to a new culture
a very different way of
kind of perceiving things.
So in the U.S. people think
so much of kind of everybody
in a sense, but they're
really thinking of themselves.
Whereas here, people truly
are thinking of others.
And I think the patience
of people here is pretty phenomenal.
I, I think the way people
drive here is a little crazy
at, at times.
And, uh, I used to really enjoy driving.
And at this stage of my
life, I can't believe
that just a couple of
years ago, if I wanted to
kind of chill out or relax,
I would go for a drive.
Now that is the absolute,
last thing I would ever do
if I want to relax, because
the way people drive here is
is just a challenge and a
little bit scary at times.
So is that the thing that I
hate most about the Philippines?
Maybe, maybe not,
but it tends to be things that
really aren't that important.
And I find that I, I just need to
put on my big boy pants, you know
learn to be a bit more patient
and uh I'm gonna be okay
Probably the mango here
So I gotta to say that,
uh, I'm a vegetarian.
And so food in the Philippines
has been a challenge
since day one, trying to
find stuff that I could eat.
So between the pandemic
being inside so much and
between just trying to find
healthy, vegetarian food, it's
you know, the main
reason why I've put on so
much weight here trying to find
healthy food is really hard
but my favorite food here, I got to say
if you've never tried the mango
especially in Cebu city,
it's absolutely phenomenal.
I love the coconut here.
Uh, Halo-halo is one of the desserts here
that is really unique. And
I really enjoy a lot as well
I gotta say Filipino food is
a bit of a challenge for me
but, uh, there's a lot of
delicious things here as well.
And if you're a meat eater,
you're going to love it.
A lot of Lechon and a lot of
things that are really unique
to the Philippines that
I think you would love
if your over here
So I gotta say I really had hoped to
travel here so much more by now.
I went to Boracay, which
is a beautiful Island here.
I went to Palawan, which is
a beautiful place as well.
It didn't go up to El Nido
and Coron, which is mostly
when you see photos of
Palawan, you're looking at one
of those places.
I went to Puerto Princesa
and went to these incredible
underwater caves that
are one of the wonderful,
one of the wonders of
the world in Palawan.
But next, if I could
travel somewhere, perhaps
Bantayan Island or Bohol,
um I gotta think about that.
I, I've tried not to think
too much about travel
because it's just been so restricted here.
The more I think about it, the
more it kind of depresses me.
And probably what's being
asked here more specifically
is can a foreigner be the sole owner
of a business in the Philippines?
Actually, I just had a video that came
out last week about this
where I interviewed an attorney
that has helped a number
of companies set up this type
of corporation in the Philippines
and make sure and check
out the link shared here.
If you're interested in finding out more
about starting a business
in the Philippines
or feel free to get in touch
with me through my John
Smulo TV Facebook as well
I'm always happy to help out people
looking to start a
business in the Philippines
It depends on the type of business
So if you are from the Philippines
you could go down to DTI and
start a business pretty quick.
If you're a foreigner,
that's trying to set
up a corporation here, it's
definitely a bit more work.
And I would definitely recommend
making sure that you talk
to someone that's gone
through that as mentioned
I'm always happy to be there to help
out with those types of things.
And I would certainly get an
attorney that can help walk you
through the process as well,
could save you a lot of time
make sure and find one that has a lot
of experience that starting OPCs
or the type of corporation
that you want to start.
But as long as you do that, it, it
can be time consuming, but
it's certainly possible
and worth it.
Yeah that's, that's a great question
And it's one that I brought
up on the channel before
and something that's really
a pretty consistent part
of my day-to-day life here
both managing employees in
California with U.S culture
and managing employees
here in the Philippines.
I, I have to say that the
differences are pretty enormous.
So I, I think that in
terms of things like,
um,
hiring
uh,
to day-to-day life
with employees, dealing
with things that happen,
that go wrong I really
have had to continually try
to learn better approaches
to managing employees, especially
in the Philippines.
When the U.S. if something goes wrong
you know, I could really say
exactly what I'm thinking
and not have to think about it too hard,
but in the Philippines
I find that I have to
tread far more gently.
And, uh, there's so much,
these are just a couple of examples
but there's really so much
that I've learned already.
And I'm sure far more that
I still have left to learn
about cross-cultural
management in the Philippines.
Learning vocabulary, isn't that difficult
but learning how to structure
sentences is a challenge
at times, there's a lot
of kind of connector words
depending on if it's a place
or a person and different things like that
where you need to know the
right word to fit things in.
And I'm still a little bit
hopeless at most of that.
Also, I find in Cebu, people use a lot
of shortcuts in the way
that they spell words.
And, and so sometimes they'll have to find
out if a word is just a
shortcut of another word
or if it's in fact another word.
So I think I'm doing okay
with learning the language here, but I
I definitely have a ways to
go when I first moved here
I had a Bisaya teacher and,
uh, that was really helpful.
I'm looking to get another
Bisaya teacher again soon.
So if you know a good one locally here
in Cebu city, let me know.
You know, sometimes I hear of, of people
that just want to visit for a vacation
and to all of those, I
would say, come on over.
It's so easy to communicate
with people here
make sure that you travel to some
of the bigger cities and
some of the islands as well
and make sure that you
hang out with locals.
So you really just get a sense
of how truly wonderful people are here.
Other people that asked me this question
are I think saying, you know,
what advice would you give
to foreigners that are considering moving
to the Philippines?
And what I would say to you is,
at first don't plan on
moving , come over here for
two or three weeks, maybe four weeks
just to really get to see if
the Philippines is for you.
If you do decide to move
over here, just rent airbnb's
that's, that's what I did for
the first year that I lived here.
And it was just a really
simple way to be able to move
to different areas, see
which ones I liked the most.
And then I eventually wind,
wound up buying a place
over here that was only
after a year of really
getting to know the area and
checking out different places.
And knowing that the place
where I bought was somewhere
that I'd enjoy living for the long haul.
So this next, uh, question
is not so much of a question
but more of a challenge.
So there's something that I think is
in Bisaya, could be Tagalog.
I honestly don't know
but they are challenging me to say
five times as quickly as I can.
Here goes nothing!
(speaking Philippine)
(speaking Philippine)
(speaking Philippine)
(speaking Philippine)
(speaking Philippine)
(speaking Philippine)
(speaking Philippine)
(speaking Philippine)
I could be cussing or saying
any kind of crazy things.
So I'll have to find out
what that actually meant.
Tell me what language that was.
Bisaya or Tagalog?
And if I totally sucked
at that or if I did okay
Anyhow, thank you for
