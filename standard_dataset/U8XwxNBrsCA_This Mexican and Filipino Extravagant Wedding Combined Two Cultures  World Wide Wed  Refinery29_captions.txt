We all went to Catholic school growing up.
Catholicism was what we did.
This is Keith.
That’s Sara.
They met in law school
and now they’re getting married.
Sara’s and Keith’s personalities are
like ying and yang;
they just compliment each other.
Any strength on one side
is balanced off by the other side.
For me, religion is the experience
that you have when you are
part of a larger community.
Their Filipino and Mexican traditions
come from opposite sides of the world.
And their Catholic upbringing
is sometimes at odds
with what they believe,
which is why for their wedding,
they’re doing things their own way.
What was really special to us
is to be able to do a ceremony
that was distinctly ours
and really embodied
how we felt about our culture,
about our family, about our friends,
and what we believed in.
Sara and Keith decided to get married
in San Miguel De Allende, Mexico,
where Sara’s family is from.
But they also wanted to incorporate
Keith’s Filipino background.
Because both Mexico and the Philippines
were colonized by Spanish Catholics,
they found a lot of the traditions
were actually similar.
The Mexican Guayabera and
the Filipino Barong
are traditional white dress shirts worn
for special occasions.
In San Miguel De Allende,
the most special occasion is
a Callejoneada.
A Callejoneada is a procession
held to honor the couple
with mariachi,
shots of tequila,
curious bystanders,
and an obligatory donkey.
The highlight of the Callejoneada
is Las Mojigangas.
Mojigangas are born out of Spanish tradition,
dating back to the 1600s.
They were modeled after
religious and aristocratic figures,
inspiring wonder and awe.
In San Miguel,
the puppets are custom-made,
taking on a more exaggerated appearance.
Currently Hermes is crafting mojigangas
to represent the bride and groom.
Ceremonial tortillas are a must-have
for every wedding in Mexico.
The tradition,
originated by Otomi Indians
in Guanajuato,
uses dye from flowers or vegetables
to create imprints on the tortillas.
A secular ceremony, I think, works well.
I like the idea of inclusiveness
and having a ceremony that’s really happy
and relaxed
and enjoyable to all who attend.
Although it’s not a Catholic wedding,
Keith and Sara are incorporating two
traditionally Catholic customs
seen in both Mexican
and Filipino cultures.
El Lazo is a tied rope placed around
the couple as they exchange their vows.
Shaped like an infinity sign,
it symbolizes that the union will last forever.
The second tradition is Las Arras,
an exchange of 13 coins that,
in modern culture,
symbolizes Christ and the Twelve Apostles.
I think it starts with either they
put it into my hands
and then I drop all the coins
into her hands
and then she drops the coins
all back into my hands—
which makes sense because
I’ve been elected the minister of finance
in the relationship.
Keith and Sara are also embracing
a less traditional,
more inclusive view of marriage than what
the Catholic religion believes.
In our faith,
it might not be
perceived as a right thing that
certain people and certain
ethnicities and certain sexual orientations
should be married but
who’s to say that we are the judges of that?
The Supreme Court’s decision to undo
the judgment against same-sex marriage
was something that Keith and Sara
couldn’t believe in more.
That's really about marriage
and marriage as an institution
and just what is this sort
of social construct that you're entering into?
And what does it mean to kind of form
this union in the literal sense?
And what does it mean to ensure
that everyone has an opportunity to do that?
Their hope is not to be condemned
to live in loneliness,
excluded from one of civilization's
oldest institutions.
They ask for equal dignity
in the eyes of the law.
The Constitution grants them this right.
The decision in that case
was such a beautiful description of marriage,
the institution of marriage,
why people want to be married,
and why everyone should have the right
to be married.
It’s a tradition to buck the tradition.
And now family and friends,
it is my honor to introduce
Keith and Sara Mariano.
You may now kiss your wife.
Sara really brought something out
in him that I had never seen.
He always wanted a companion.
What Sara brought to him was
this sense of who he is now.
For Keith and Sara,
forging a new path doesn’t mean
leaving tradition behind.
