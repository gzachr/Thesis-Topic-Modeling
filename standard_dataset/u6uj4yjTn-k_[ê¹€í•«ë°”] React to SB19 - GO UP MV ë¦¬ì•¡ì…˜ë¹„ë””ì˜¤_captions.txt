Hi~~
Today, Let's watch together 'GO UP' song by SB19
I've confirmed that they are the first Filipino boy group to train and debut at a Korean entertainment agency.
Indeed, I am very curious. 
about the results of their training in Korea.
Then shall we go together?
It's a surprise
Oh~ He is cute.
Oh~ Song is good!
I feel a little K-POP
Is this song composed in Korea?
Good, good song.
Because they are five member, I think of SHINee.
They look like SHINee sporty and boyish charm
Like when SHINee just debuted.
I think he is so cute.
Oh~ this guy is cute too.
Dyed guy!
High note!!
Wow, It's awesome.
They feel like K-POP Idol.
They are trained in Korea, so it's like a Korean idol.
I don't know much about them in detail
But they are really like one of good idols in Korean
A Music is too.
It was a good time.
If you are a fan of SB19 or someone who knows them well, please write a comment.
Then let me check.
Cheer up SB19!
Then, see you again next video
Bye~~~~
