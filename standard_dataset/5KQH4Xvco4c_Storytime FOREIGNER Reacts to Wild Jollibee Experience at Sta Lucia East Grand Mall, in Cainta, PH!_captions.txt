And I'm here at the Jollibee and I could 
definitely say this experience has been  
a tad bit different today what did I order 
I ordered a chicken sandwich which offered  
a Nestle iced tea and salty fries today I 
can say I don't know I don't know if this  
is the best experience a jolly beer ever 
had because I tell you this was one of the  
saltiest fries I ever had in my life and I 
decided to bring out the camera because I  
was like you know what let's explain your 
experience why not so as soon as I ate  
the fries I was like super salt and the 
Jollibee chicken sandwich that they have  
Soul undercooked like as soon as I bit it it was 
like chewy I was like I was like is this supposed  
to be like this and so as soon as I'm eating there 
was a little death girl so she said she said she  
was deaf she started walking around and what she 
did is that she put a card here and she says I'm  
deaf and um as well so she put a card there and 
I'm looking around and I'm like what is this girl  
doing so I was like hmm obviously she's looking 
for money right so I look around to see if her mom  
or someone is standing by you know looking after 
her or whatever and so I she put it right here and  
like ketchup got on it so I went in my bag right 
here and I took a napkin out and I wiped it off  
and I gave it to her and I give it back to her so 
I wanted to understand her story more so I started  
to test it because when I was in college at us 
separate took two years of sign language so I  
started asking her questions and um sign language 
and I was like where's your dad and she was like  
oh my dad went away and I was like oh snap she 
actually no sign language so I'm like look at this  
is in the cruise but I wanted to see if she truly 
understood sign language so that it wouldn't be  
like oh I can't speak I can't hear give me money 
type of thing so you know started asking more  
questions with your mom she pointed to the back 
and I was looking for her mom but I didn't see her  
but she kept pointing over there and so um so she 
pretty much gave me a whole story in sign language  
so I understand something and so I went in my 
pocket went to my uh bag and pretty much give her  
100 pesos which is about a dollar and 90 something 
cents you know no big deal um I don't usually like  
giving money to Beggars at all um you know if 
someone's having a hard time and guess I'll  
try to help and things like that but someone that 
just comes and bags I just don't truly do that as  
much I just don't it just depends on how I feel 
on that day or if I have it so she walked around  
that's how I gave her 100 so what she did was that 
she went table to table to table one by one sat  
with people and to do the same story I'm deaf I I 
don't understand that or not and some people gave  
her change some people was like No just go away 
things like that and so then someone came around  
and stood right there and she was a little older 
she was like an older female and she was like  
um we're here doing some um benefit things or if 
you can give donation and stuff like that so I'm  
looking around I don't think is she part of the 
same party as this deaf girl and then I was like  
um I said I already gave money to the deaf girl 
and she's like oh you did I said yeah I get
and then she was like wow you gave that so 
sweet and then for some reason she ran over  
to the death brother started trying to talk to her 
but I couldn't see if the deaf girl was actually  
speaking back because then the attendance came 
and bombarded me and the attendants were like hey  
before you go can you do a survey like I wasn't 
even done eating so she they had me do a QR code  
scan I went to the website and I was halfway 
eating my uh chicken sandwich and it brought me  
to uh pretty much the survey thing so I'm like 
okay so it's like based on your last or most  
recent visit uh How likely would you recommend 
our restaurant to your friends or relatives so  
I'm like I can't really I was like I can't really 
decide if I would if I want to do this they they  
wanted me to serve they wanted me to do the 
survey as I sat there and so I'm like I don't  
know so I complained about the sandwich and then 
they were just like oh okay it doesn't well if you  
could write 15 minutes we'll see um if we can make 
another one for you but I have to talk to the boss  
first I went to the boss he came back and he said 
okay we'll make one for you just wait for a few  
minutes and the girl was still here and she was 
like oh could you finish the survey I'm like well  
I don't know if I could finish the service because 
I don't know how the new one will taste and do one  
I don't know if the first one is truly on the 
Crypt or not and so they kind of like bombarded  
mom and I was just like what the heck man like why 
you got some fears for me to do a survey before I  
even finish my meal so this Jollibee is funny 
and then we got kids running all around as you  
can see look at that kid right over there running 
around in a circle I'm like yo this is one of the  
wildest Jollibee I've ever been to so whoever 
wants to come to sell so whoever wants to go  
to Central this year here in Canada in the mall 
uh come to this Jollibee if you want but you're  
gonna be prepared for a little bit of different 
things another thing that I noticed is that  
I saw some people with straws and then I was 
like okay um I actually the lady she came by  
she gave me my food and I asked her for a straw 
and she came back she said no straws okay so I'm  
like why not and she's like well straws are only 
for floats the floats have like a cap and they  
don't put caps on these and then they don't have 
regular cups anymore so I guess they're trying to  
keep away from classics and stuff like that 
which is fine but they wouldn't they wouldn't  
give me a straw they say only for clothes because 
someone down there has a straw and he has a float  
but then I'm like wondering you know covid-19 
is still in effect around here and there was  
um the hand washing station in the back all the 
way over there so I went and I washed my hands  
with the soap I had to push the soak it and then 
there was no paper towels at all most likely in  
the Philippines you know you will rarely find 
paper towels anywhere until after washing your  
hands and so then I tried to use the air dryer and 
the air dryer didn't work at all and so I'm like  
hey so I went underneath and I pressed on but as 
I press on it said this air dryer is inoperable  
because of covet 19. so I'm like what I'm like 
wouldn't you want the air dryer to work I'm like  
this is so weird I'm like what's the problem 
with the air dryer with Covenant 19. so none  
of the air dryers worked and it had no paper 
so I had to like wash my hair and put it on my  
shorts like this you know what the heck but then 
you allow me to have a cup that's been on many  
people's mouths and you know I have to drink it 
like this but you won't let me use a hand dryer  
so this place is like super backwards I 
don't know what's going on I know they  
have the reasons but I surely don't understand 
their reasons especially with this coping 19  
stuff so I would think that you would want 
people to use straws to help with covert  
it's okay so whatever am I complaining not really 
because I'm I'm just traveled but I'm just letting  
you know this place is weird it's kind of yeah it 
wasn't the best experience so when they asked me  
I'm gonna be real and they're going to say based 
on your visit do you recommend the central museum  
Mall Jollibee I'm gonna give them like a they 
were nice so I'll give them like a five a five  
based off of everything that I've done so a 
lot of Beggars walking around kids walking  
around the food wasn't good you know the drinks 
are really not put up to the top as you can see  
you know and they don't even offer refills rather 
on the iced tea or the coke so it's kind of like  
they're cutting back at this particular place 
I don't know so this is a Jollibee rant and I'm  
done so let's see how that new chicken sandwich 
will look I'll take that home with me signing off  
bonus oh you thought I wasn't gonna 
do a mukbang hit that hit that
um okay this is another sandwich okay so 
what I want to do is I want to check I want  
to check to see if it's different than the 
other one because it the other one had like  
um not pink but it was like very mushy  
I wasn't sure if it was undercooked so let's 
let's take a look I'm gonna take one one bite  
now bite one bite now all right let's do it 
all right it's okay I'm Haitian you know Haiti  
the country Haiti you never heard of Haiti you 
heard of USA yes it's below USA Caribbean Sea
um
Perfecto this is good look 
at that heat boy I like it
um it was good thank you it was 
better it's harder I appreciate it  
yes sir thank you thank you all right all right
but a little better though
this is what I like right now
let's cook

I didn't do the survey yet but
oh switch it to a seven okay
