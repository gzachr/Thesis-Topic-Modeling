We are gonna fly to the Philippines
we had seats in the middle, not the best ones
But they moved us to emergency exit
wide place, 3 places for each
For Vania and me
and there's a white girl
she also got this place
it's because we're white
no no no
because the plane will crash
and we will need to open these doors
we might to survive, because we are white
actually, we have to help others to evacuate
those who sit here
no, that’s because we must survive
that we might be saved
it is important to read this thing
some instruction
especially this one, right
wait, sorry, this is my magazine
here it is
we will learn all this
and we'll jump on this thing
where did you get the information that this plane is going to crash?
I know!
why else they put us here?
otherwise, why they gathered all us together?
the island called us
we were instructed...
she knows something
I do not understand anything
but she knows that the plane will crash
you should have heard her
she came and said
You need to learn how to open the door
just in case
it's cool
I like the flight
Vania likes to die
no, we'll save everybody
everybody?
or kill everybody
So wet!
So hot
We still have so much cloths on!
now I'm not cold
We spent the night at the airport
went outside - the rain comes
but hot
the air is very humid
it's hard to breathe
but Ivan likes
it is so soft and warm
and according to the forecast it’s gonna be rain for three days
we go to eat
to eat!
first impressions
Philippines is a country of Filipinos
I've seen a lot of Filipinos in Hong Kong
but here literally everyone is Filipino!
and authentic…
these ones…
minibus
it's just the tuk-tuk
and minibuses are cool
we met some beggars
our first meal in the Philippines
we came to some...
I do not dare to call it a cafe
a yard
with kids
50 pesos for the local portion
it is exactly 1 us dollar. Exactly!
Not that much
but potatoes with meat, rice
and here's the minibus looks like that
cool, isn't it?
Suddenly we were on the cemetery
I don't know is there ash or bones inside
Or a body completely
Don’t know
A car squirted us!
so Ivan grabbed the coconut
under a palm tree around
if they’ll squirt us next time
he will throw a coconut
another coconut!
Don’t you dare do it again!
hi!
20 pesos for a ride in metro
Terminal gave me
This broken card
but price is very fair
WTF
watch, look!
let's put another bag there
what the hell at all?
we waited there, the train came here
he's kind of short
in the Philippines we can eat enough
it costs 40
meat, eggs, rice
Some sauce
I ate two pies
for 6 pesos each
we are traveling in this...
I don't know what to call it...
Not a bus…
Not a jeep as well…
and how much for a ride, bro?
"jeepneys". the locals call them "jeepneys"
we were sitting on the street in Hong Kong 
I was selling postcards, coins
Vanya played the ukulele
we met by a Filipina, Mary
we talked
She gave us some food
we talked about our future plans
that we will fly to the Philippines
she said, «I’ve got a brother in Manila"
he's got a room and he can host you
As long as you want
We contact her brother when arrived to Manila
brother's name is JR
he brought us here
here kind of slums
this is our room
it is about 2,5x2,5 m
no more
Tell them about the window
what about the window? you can tell
there's a hole instead of a window
we covered with plastic sheeting to not let the mosquitoes
but last night it did not help
For me it was OK mosquitoes don't bite me, and they attacked Ivan a lot
he even wanted to go to the airport, to sleep there
more about the conditions
we have some roommates here
the lizard is running here like this
the cockroach was the same size
and centipede
what kind of centipede?
I didn't see it, but Vania saw. show them
Like this
and many many legs
Filipinos they are curious
They are interested to communicate with foreigners
we were surrounded by them our first evening here
then little girls came here
Filipinas
They were sitting and talking with us for two hours
and when they started to catch the fleas from each other...
Crashed them right here, on our "beds"
it was kind of…
let’s say, unusual thing…
and such a contrast after Hualien
where we allocated the room
with own shower, washing machine, there was everything
and here...
Kind of contrast
but we're not complaining
they provided a shelter absolutely for free
this is a normal house for the Philippines
by the way, we learned the price
this room is 2500 per month
it is exactly 50 USD
And it’s not that cheap
there is no water now
there is a toilet without a flush
ladle and bowl instead of a flush
ladle and bowl instead of a shower
water is only at night, in the evening
There is no water now, because of an afternoon time
They keep it in bowls and buckets
I guess for this money
on the outskirts of Kyiv
you can get something better to rent
and somewhere in Zaporizhia for sure
but not in Russia
I bought a tempered glass for my phone in Hong Kong
For 18 local dollars
Do you have a tape?
no, not here
or I do… I do!
and here for 100 pesos only
this 15 HKD
and installation included
Vanya says he bought it in Hong Kong for 50 HKD
also with the installation
and then suddenly and unexpectedly a new competition
I’ll send a postcard to…
postcard will be not from the Philippines, but from another country
probably from China
Postcard will go to the person which first will write in the comments
the national anthem of the Philippines
translated into Belarusian language
you can use Google translate
Let’s go
From here
the impression that the city is good
modern one, not poor
we realized
that it is the map of Philippines
it is the largest and main island, Luzon
or not the largest, but where Manila is
Palawan is apart, the furthest island
here you can even see the place where we are going soon
this volcano, or even there is a lake in the volcano
the volcano on the island in the lake
this lake on the island
this island in the ocean
ocean on planet Earth
Earth in the Solar system
Solar system in our Galaxy
and this is a Manila in a grass
you can see how many volcanoes here in the Philippines?
and there are all sorts of islands
There are over 7000 Islands
of course not everyone is drawn here
but more than 7000! just imagine!
we even managed to get on some water show for free
I thought that in such poor countries like the Philippines
it is difficult and almost impossible
but no, we sneaked somehow
through the back door
got on the water show
however, the show was so-so
This one is free and at least not worse
even with a fire
There are different kinds of condiments
and here's...
I'm sorry
Suka (bi*ch)
trying to get home
These kind of streets even not on a map
I have marked the point where we are
but we don’t know how to get there
because these are sort of slums, no proper streets
trying to find
Philippines is a country where you can finally get a cheap haircut
it costs 40 pesos only
in Hong Kong the cheapest one was
50 HKD in a Pakistanis’ secret apartment
in the secret entrance
we thought to stay here for maybe three days
or 4 I guess
but 2 days we stayed here and will go
but there is electricity, I even started to edit the episode
actually, for here, the place is normal
we just have a bit of a shock
after the fancy Hong Kong
And Taiwan
But locals live good in such conditions
