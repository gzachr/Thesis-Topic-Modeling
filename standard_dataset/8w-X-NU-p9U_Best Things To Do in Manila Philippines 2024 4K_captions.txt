[Music] [Applause]
[Applause] [Music] thank you what's going on 
everybody this is Island Hopper TV and today we're  
going to talk about things to do while visiting 
Manila Philippines let's do it first up on the  
list is Intramuros here in Old Town Manila this 
was originally established by the Spanish dating  
back to the 1500s then the Japanese took this area 
and then the Americans after World War II took it  
back and now it's currently a historical park for 
those of you who want to come visit this part of  
manila's History you will notice that there 
is a golf course that goes around the area of  
intramuros and that was actually put in after 
World War II covering up the moat that served  
as a fortification barrier of Entry protecting 
the fort and as we continue to show you around  
Manila here I want to remind you guys that if you 
check the description below you will find time  
stamps so you can bounce around from location 
to location very close to intramuros is Fort  
Santiago sitting here at the mouth of the pasig 
river it served as the premier defense Fortress  
for the Spanish government while they controlled 
the country of the Philippines an interesting fact  
about this fort here it served as the prison for 
the national hero Jose Rizal who was executed in  
1896 nearby is the Jose Rizal Museum and the 
Jose Rizal Park you will see in many of the  
municipalities and provinces across Philippines 
a Jose Rizal statue in front of the city halls or  
the government buildings and while here at Fort 
Santiago you'll be able to walk through some of  
the prison areas where the actual prisoners were 
held in case you're wondering what Jose resolves  
alleged crime was it was Rebellion which later 
led to the Philippine Revolution breaking out now  
we're headed over to Chinatown known as benondo 
it is the oldest Chinatown in the world and the  
most visited towns in the Philippine capital city 
of Manila Chinatown here in Manila is actually  
known for its food so if you're down here and you 
want to try some street food or any sort of unique  
Cuisine that's what's the main attraction here it 
is quite crowded and it might not be for everybody  
so do a little bit of research on Chinatown 
on TripAdvisor or read some of the blogs that  
ride up about this location for me I found it 
very interesting and I did try some of the food  
while here just some quick history about manila's 
Chinatown it's more than 400 years old and it was  
established in 1594 as a permanent settlement for 
the Chinese Catholic immigrants here in Manila I  
ended up taking a trike from Intramuros over here 
to Chinatown and we went over the Passaic River it  
took around 10 to 50 15 minutes because of traffic 
but it could be a little bit faster depending on  
the time of day now here we are at San Augustine 
church this was completed in 1607 it is the oldest  
Stone Church in the country this is not to be 
confused with the Manila Cathedral Basilica which  
we will be showing you a bit later on in the film 
in case you're wondering what the largest church  
in the Philippines is it's tall Basilica near 
tall volcano which is an area we will be showing  
you a little bit later on in the film also if 
you plan to visit the Philippines check the  
link description below because there are several 
more videos we are making from across the country  
now here we are at the Venice Canal shops while 
walking around here you'll notice that there's a  
gondola and many boats that you can ride going 
around the mall and the shops similar to what  
you would find at the Venetian in Las Vegas 
or Macau while here you'll notice that it's  
an outdoor venue with many different shops on two 
different levels located nearby the ritzy area of  
Manila known as BGC Bonifacio Global City now 
while here in BGC you can also walk around High  
Street now this is an area where they're going to 
have many different restaurants it's very popular  
with people who are looking for outdoor activities 
such as shopping hanging out at cafes going to  
restaurants with bars or just relaxing in the park 
right in the middle of High Street when you visit  
BGC you'll notice that the prices of hotels are 
going to be more expensive than they are even in  
Makati or other parts of Manila because it is 
really the ritzy business Central Area another  
ritzy area is going to be Manila sea side right 
here along Manila Bay walking along the Waterfront  
is popular as well as going towards the amusement 
park this one is called SM by the bay here they  
have a large ferris wheel as well as a variety 
of different Kitty rides and games for the whole  
family where you can try and win a teddy bear 
or something for your girlfriend even prices do  
vary for the rides for example the dream twister 
is 100 pesos that's two US dollars right so if  
you wanted to do the drop tower that's a hundred 
pesos they have the bumper car which is 60 pesos  
the pirate ship which is really exhilarating ride 
that's 100 pesos so just depending on what you're  
gonna do you pay per ride and right next to 
the amusement park is SM Mall of Asia this is  
actually the largest shopping mall in all of the 
Philippines and certainly right here in Manila  
so if you want to go to a mega mall this is the 
one you're going to come to while here I actually  
stayed at the Conrad hotel which is very close 
to both of these I'm not saying you'll want to  
stay at that hotel because it is a bit expensive 
I use my Hilton Honors points to get that room but  
I found that to be a convenient hotel for those 
of you who do have reward points now let's talk  
about nightlife here in Manila this is a bit 
of a tricky subject because depending on who  
you ask you'll get different answers but for the 
most part people will tell you Makati and then  
even depending on what hotel you're at they'll 
tell you publish on so publish on is basically  
the party area where there's bars but it's a 
bit of a CD area if you know what I'm saying  
so keep that in mind if you're looking for a more 
high-end nightlife experience consider going to  
BGC in places like forbestown which we will be 
showing you a little later on but it's going  
to be the daytime experience at Forbes town the 
area you're looking at right here is called Pete  
Burgos here in publishan which is in Makati now 
around here you're going to find cheaper hotels  
as well which is going to be a relief from BGC 
and even though it's about two kilometers away  
from BGC it still takes about a half hour to get 
here from BGC by the way now which leads me to  
something I'd like to point out driving in Manila 
is very congested and it does take a long time to  
go several kilometers something that should 
take only maybe 10 minutes takes a half hour  
next up is Tal volcano and this one is actually 
active sitting right here along the lake it's  
about an hour away from Manila it is a unique 
natural beauty next up we're headed to City of  
Dreams this here is a casino and gaming area where 
they have multiple different hotels including the  
Hyatt Regency they also have some high-end 
restaurants here like Wolfgang Puck and the  
DreamWork dream play for the kids so if you like 
good food casinos and chilling out with the family  
in a little bit more of a ritzy area again City 
of Dreams might be for you now here's a look at  
Forbes town but this time it's going to be in the 
daytime like I said this is a place you may want  
to check out in the evening time you're going to 
find high-end restaurants and cafes like a Tim  
Hortons for example which is something you'd find 
in Canada right here in Manila they also have many  
different restaurants that may be interesting 
for you so again Forbes town right here in BGC  
could be a solution for some of you who are 
looking for a high-end experience in Manila  
and the reason I keep going back to BGC with a lot 
of this commentary is because this is an area you  
can get around without congestion now getting 
here you're going to experience congestion but  
once you're here it's not as congested and crazy 
as you would get around the rest of the city  
and just walking around BGC in general is what 
I'm doing here showing you what the rest of BGC  
is there's got condos here where you may be able 
to get a rental for an Airbnb they also have the  
Grand Hyatt nearby several other hotels but really 
the best area to be is BGC you can see it looks  
like Singapore right here which I have noticed 
comes as a bit of a surprise for foreigners who  
come here thinking that Manila is full of traffic 
jams and congestion so when they come out here  
they're like wow I didn't expect this awesome 
area inside of Manila so yes BGC add that to  
your list of places to really hang out for those 
who want to avoid the congestion but it's going  
to come at a price right it's expensive here I 
found it to be easy to walk around but if you  
wanted to take one of these rental scooters to go 
around or rent a bike you can do that also there's  
going to be plenty of taxis and they have grav 
readily available so download that app now we're  
over here you're doing a manila haircut style I 
like to get my hair cut here in Manila with one  
of these local guys who know what they're doing 
with the switch blade they know how to trim it  
line it up really nicely so if you want a good 
treatment for a fair price get your hair cut and  
line up with some nice shampoo and conditioner 
and walk away feeling fresh and clean as you  
go around Manila streets this haircut service I 
got was at Big Boss Barber right here at Venice  
Canal shops in case you're wondering we got some 
adobo and some lumpia so the adobo definitely  
tastes like it's a pork it doesn't taste like 
a chicken okay so I got some prawn tacos here
what is this called This is
look at this  Lumpia Shanghai a 
popular delicacy here is actually  
called Balut this is actually a duck that's 
almost about ready to hatch and you eat it
it's a baby duck but what's the name yeah
what does it look like inside a 
boiled egg mini boiled eggs oh
it tastes good huh yeah wagyu and 
garlic carbonara spaghetti sauce
ah yes thank you sir
for those of you who do plan to stay in BGC 
maybe you consider checking out mini Park  
which is right here in BGC Village but it gives 
you an idea of what life is like inside of much  
of Manila without actually having to go too 
far in a car to see what the rest of Manila  
is like so this place like mini Park kind of cool 
it's right next to the Bonifacio Memorial right  
there so you could probably get both and then 
you can head over to the SM aura Premier Mall  
as you've probably noticed some of the most 
interesting things you'll do while visiting  
Manila is going to these malls and it's also 
a great way to beat the humidity and the  
heat in these modern malls that they have all 
across Makati BGC and the Manila Seaside area  
speaking of Manila Seaside area we're going to go 
over to Newport World Resort this is similar to  
City of Dreams where they have several different 
Resorts like the Sheraton the Marriott as well  
as the Hilton and then they have of course the 
casinos with a mall right next door it used to  
be called Resorts World but now it's renamed 
Newport World Resort this area is just around  
the mall where you'll see all these crazy lighting 
exhibits from Newport World Resort let's go back  
towards the intramuros area this year is the 
minnella cathedral for those of you who like  
to study the history or of the Spanish settlements 
in the area then come over here and check out this  
beautiful cathedral and that's going to do it for
