Salamat po. How much is it?
-No, no, no. I will pay
No, no. Please
-No, no. That’s part of Filipino hospitality
Okay, so I am starving
and I
want to check out this food
called Lumpia,
which are these fried spring rolls,
which my last hostel's owner
recommended me
and the last time he recommended me
that beef-stew place, that was bomb.
So I'm excited about this
because he said
this is the most famous lumpia
or the best lumpia in Manila.
So let's see how that goes.
I think it's not in Binondo.
I know we're still in Chinatown
because I see things
that look like Chinatown,
but I think it's more towards Quiapo.
Got like a 10-15 minute walk that way.
Kumusta kuya
I like how they literally selll everything on carts over here.
I guess they're just going back home.
You know, the day is almost over.
I think people are just
packing shop and heading back
to wherever they live
or to turn in their cart.
I don't know how this works exactly.
Definitely a
speaker store.
Cars.
OK we should be very close,
getting very close.
towards where it’s supposed to be.
-Hiiiii
Hello
Okay.
This definitely feels like
a rougher part of town
than where I was like
where I was 10 minutes ago.
But I think I found the place.
It's called
Globe Lumpia.
This is the famous
Lumpia place
This is the line.
You’re here to get lumpia?
See, that's what I was told.
The lines are always pretty big,
but that's because it's worth it.
I think it's another one of those places..
I believe it's one of those places
that serves just one item.
But serve it really well.
crowd control
Right next to the place, selling lumpia,
there's a place that's selling
disco lights.
It says to maintain two meters distancing,
which is
not what we’re doing.
I want fresh lumpia
1 fresh lumpia.
This is interesting.
I can't even see who's over there.
I can't even see who's over there.
Here's the cashier.
I guess they just
give it to me right here.
Is that lumpia?
-Yeah. Yeah. They make it here.
It's being made right there.
You know what kind of meat
is in there? Pork or..
-I think it’s only vegetables
- Vegetables yeah
That’s nice
Salamat po
Looks really cool.. Oh, man.
It’s too loud..
That was really cool.
You can just see people
making it right in front of you.
And at first,
I was a little nervous about filming
because it said no photos, but clearly
no one cared.
They just like, roll it up right in front of you.
And then just like,
put some pickles and vegetables
And then it's a spring fried roll
I got one for 35 pesos, which is $0.60,
I think I found my tripod.
Look at this.
I'm going to use this as my tripod.
Perfect fit.
I have to take a video of this.
Like this was meant to be.
Time to actually try out this
fresh lumpia
Came with a little bag of sauce
That's a lot of stuff to be like,
you know, managing
while eating food on the street.
It came with like two bags of sauce
You know what kind of sauce (this is)?
From Fresh Lumpia
What sauce is this?
- (foreign language)
Do you know the name of this sauce?
- Chilly spicy
Chilly spicy. Okay
Thank you
Salamat po
- (foreign language)
Okay.
All right.
-Where you from, sir?
Bangladesh
Yes.
There's like some chili spicy sauce.
I guess I'm supposed to eat this.
Like, this skinny cover on it.
I read somewhere that you eat this.
How do I actually, pour the sauce?
Struggling to open this.
I’ll put some here
This is going to be very messy.
It’s time to try it out.
This is nice.
It’s definitely sweet. It might be the sauce, but
it's pretty good.
It's a lot more vegetables than I expected.
- It’s a wrap, sir?
- (foreign language)
It’s all over my fingers now, the sauce
This is really good.
-In the Philippines, what are you doing?
Just visiting
Yes, tourist
-Where’s your hotel?
Malate
-Malate
Yeah. Yeah.
-You look for a girl?
Nooo
I look for food.
-You look for a girl..
Yeah?
-call me.. (unintelligible)
Okay
-I give you girl..
No now I'm looking for food
-Not girl
Not for girl.
Gentleman was asking me
if I'm looking for girls.
I don't think he was talking about
looking for women
the way in which
I can look for women from time to time.
I think this was going to be something else.
This is amazing.
And I made a mess.
They did not give me a napkin.
So I'm just using this
paper
as a napkin.
That sauce was so sticky
I had to wash it off.
That was amazing.
I wouldn't say
it was as good as the (beef) pares.
As the stew, but it was still pretty nice.
As the stew, but it was still pretty nice.
If I could do that again,
I would like get a plate
so I don't make a mess and spill
half of it on my fingers.
But it was nice.
It was like a sweet and sour veggie roll.
I guess
Salamat po
Salamat po
- (foreign language)
Oh, man.
People are selling stuff.
A binocular store
(sirens)
Oh, man.
We're right in the thick of it.
It's almost rush hour. So right now.. (sirens)
because I wanted to spend it.
So I only had one of those lumpias
because I wanted to save some space
for this other,
Filipino dessert that everyone loves
and I want to try.
And that is supposed to be like,
really good around here called Halo Halo.
So I'm going to walk over there
and see if I can find that
Cute little puppy sleeping.
We are definitely in Quiapo right now.
Ya know I was here the other day.
Now I feel like a local
because I like know the place.
We're back in front of
Plaza Miranda.
Seems to be a lot more going on today than
the other day when I was here.
So we’re at the place that my hostel
owner also recommended
for getting the best halo halo in town
and he hasn't disappointed once so far
so I'm excited to try
this kind of dessert I guess
I guess this used to be the old market
and this is a new one.
Big improvement.
Hello?
Where is Jolli Dada’s Eatery?
-Over there 
Salamat Po
Man I’m not going to lie,
it smells a little funky in here,
like a wet market.
Yeah, right here.
Salamat Po
Oh, man.
I think this is the line.
This is a crazy line.
So this is the place to eat.
And this is the massive line.
Is this a line for halo halo?
-Yeah, halo halo
Thank you
Salamat Po
This is where the massive line starts.
Are you guys in line for
Dada’s eatery? Okay
So not only is it
like a massive line
to just get in, it's so crowded.
it’s so crowded
Look at the tables.
Look at the number of people
just here to eat it
and how many people are sitting
in one table. That's like
13 or 14 people in that one small table
Making a little
bit of progress, at least
I think that’s all the items 
Palabok is the main meat item
which I don't think I have the appetite to eat
right now.
So I’m just going to get the halo halo.
One halo halo 
-Oh we don’t have halo halo
Oh, you don't?
-Sold out
Sold out.
Okay, okay.
Can I get the pancit palabok?
-Only one?
Only one yeah.
Is this it?
-Yeah.
What's inside it?
- tuna.. (inaudible)
Tuna like fish?
-Yeah yeah
Is there anything without fish?
Everything is with fish?
-Only seafood
Only seafood
No halo halo?
-Wait wait
-You must wait okay
Okay okay.
So they don't have
halo halo.
So I'm going
to try their other famous food
Pancit Palabok, I think.
But I think all they had is seafood
and I don't eat seafood either.
They’re trying find something else for me.
I was going to leave
and they told me to stay
it is so hot
-Without fish.
Okay.
Salamat po. How much is it?
- 80 pesos
-No, no, no. I will pay
No, no. Please
-No, no. That’s part of Filipino hospitality
Salamat Po. Thank you!
Now we’re gonna eat.
They were so nice
They saw that I was
standing in line forever
and they didn’t have halo halo
Apparently they only had seafood stuff.
So I don't really like seafood
so I was gonna leave
And then the guy asked me to wait
and then found something
without seafood in it
and then the lady who was in line behind me
wouldn't let me pay because she's like,
that's how Filipinos are and treat people
Now I’ve got a free meal.
What's your name?
-Emanuelle
Thank you.
Salamat po
That's the guy
that, like,
made sure I got something to eat.
-Where do you come from?
Bangladesh
-Bangladesh
- Are you here for vacation?
Yeah
-How long?
I just came here four days ago.
-4 days ago?
Yeah, And I'll be in the Philippines
for two months.
For a long time.
But in Manila for a few more days, maybe.
-How do you find the Philippines?
I like it.
I like the food.
-And people?
Oh yeah people are really friendly.
People smile a lot.
So I don't even know what's in it.
So there's eggs, obviously.
There's a lot of meat.
I think that's pork
Pork skin?
Is this like sweet and sour sauce?
-It’s like a sour sauce
-salty
It’s salty?
-yes
Well, it's like some kind of
liquidy stuff
that we don't know what it is.
But I'll try it out
and maybe I'll figure it out.
when I taste it.
Salty
Definitely taste
like the crispier skin and the eggs
I don't know what this is
but it tastes like breadcrumbs.
Oh, there's like some spaghetti
Oh, palabok okay
-Yes
So palabok, I guess literally means
a kind of pasta.
Yeah, Now, I know.
Because I'm going to eat a halo halo.
And they said there’s no more halo halo.
So I was like,
okay, I'll have pancit palabok.
This is actually really nice.
Friendly people next to me are helping me
figure out what I'm eating.
But yeah it's basically pasta
with pork and eggs and it's freaking delicious.
Today's the day for getting food
all over my hands and bag and clothes
and everything else.
-bye bye
bye bye
Thank you for explaining to me.
The sauce is a bit thick.
Not going to lie,
but it goes well.
As long as there’s no bones
I'm happy.
I got a coke for like.
20 pesos because
it's just so hot. Just look at my head.
But this is warm
so I guess you put it in ice and
then drink it.
ready.
Thank you so much.
Salamat po
You know there's a reason
Filipinos are known across the world
for their hospitality
because of things like this.
They saw someone
who was in trouble and then
they helped out.
they helped out.
Salamat po
-Salamat
Thank you so much. Bye
That was amazing.
I feel the reason this part
like Binondo, Quiapo
is my favorite part of Manila
so far is because
this is where I get to interact
with the most people.
And the more people I interact with
in Manila,
the Philippines, the more smiles I get,
the more happy vibes
I get, the more people being helpful
I get.
It just makes you happy.
It just puts you in a good mood.
And that's been kind of my
experience the whole time
I've been in Manila
the whole day today
when I was trying to find stuff
and couldn't find it.
Everyone from shopkeepers
who had no intention of selling me stuff
to security guards
who double checked
and made sure I was going the right way
and found what I needed.
Just people on the street
who were just very curious to see
that I was a guest here
and wanted me to have
the best time possible.
I love Manila.
I know a lot of tourists
come and just like,
get the hell out of here
as fast as they can.
But I've been here
for like five or six days
now, and
it's been an absolutely fun city.
Yes, it is hectic.
Yes, the traffic is crazy,
but it is a lot of fun
and I definitely plan
on filming a couple of more videos
from Manila before I go out.
All right, guys,
that is going to be it for this video.
