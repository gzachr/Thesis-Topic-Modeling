Goodafternoon guys! I'm still at work.
I work at the PNB (Philippine National Bank) near our area
walking distance.
The time right now is 4pm and I am working until seven, because I'm closing
thats it.
Krispy Kreme.
Here's what we ordered. Maple Iced
and the original glazed.
At work again. My baby scratched my face.
Excuse my face. Kind of haggard, didn't get much sleep
You'll write the toppings you want here.
I didn't finish it.
I'm here at the mall right now,
buying gifts for Christmas.
Why your wearing Papa's brief???
When no straw.
She want some more.
The bottle is already empty.
I'm at target again.
To return what we bought
for my baby
because we want to buy a bigger and better and she is asleep right now.
Looking for movies
Because,
so you're a vlogger now but Tagalog Version?
We're deciding
what to watch. Because the DVDs and blurays are on sale.
this is a very old movie but I haven't watched it yet
I forgot to vlog our gifts for my husband's siblings and
cousins, whatever,.
That's all the gifts I wrapped.
and we're gonna put them under our Christmas tree now
and of course the biggest one is for our baby.
Gonna eat out because it is my niece's birthday.
Planning to buy this for Blair. Our Christmas gift for her. It is on sale.
