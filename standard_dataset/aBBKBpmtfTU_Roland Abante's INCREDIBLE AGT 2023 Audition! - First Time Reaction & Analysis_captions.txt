this is the channel where we learn from some
of our favorite singers together my name is
Liza Quin thank you for joining me I am so
excited to watch this AGT audition by Roland
Abante. He's from the Philippines and I have
watched and reacted to and analyzed so many
incredible singers from the Philippines on
this channel that you guys have turned me
on to and now I am I'm a huge fan I have never
heard Roland but I bet this is going to be
fantastic so before we dive in I want to quickly
introduce you to a special delivery that arrived
thanks to Valencia Theater seating now while
I don't have a cinema room at least not quite
yet these are absolutely incredible recliners
right now to make like a little movie theater
out of our living room I would be doing my
reaction in these incredibly special Cinema
chairs except I have my piano up here kind
of locked into my setup but this is what they
look like in my living room and I have been
super comfortable checking everything out
if you want to check out a live stream of
your favorite artists check out some of your
favorite singers on YouTube maybe some of
your favorite reaction analysis his channels
I'm just saying this would be the perfect
chair to do it in if you do have a cinema
room you can add on chairs these are the duo

in my space and I figured one day if I can
have a guest join me maybe it'll be Roland

mind first at the end of this video I'll give
you more information on where to go to check

Filipinas
[Music] so in the Philippines he's just saying
in the neighborhood where they have karaoke
ah okay so you do it as a karaoke for fun
for fun can I ask you a question yeah he's
setting a joke
and then
[Music] so in the Philippines my work is in
the morning I'm a fisherman and in the afternoon
I I do drive a motorbike and I deliver passengers
and goods wow amazing he seems so sweet and
humble I just I already want to be friends
with him so why America's Got Talent uh
no no you make him cry don't make me cry every
now I see in myself or only because I this
is my big dream to get there to be here
Roland do you want to have a hug before you
start or you're good okay land okay okay right
now [Applause] wow that's the biggest Catch
of the Day yes
okay that was actually fun okay
yes okay [Music] [Applause] he's so nervous
I'm nervous now for him too I would be nervous
[Music] thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music]
inspired
[Music]
this is the last one to know
[Music]
yes nice [Music]
oh trying to hold on to Your Precious Love
baby baby please talks with me [Applause]
[Music] [Applause] misery
[Music]
who's baby baby
[Music] [Applause]
okay I know there's still more of this video
so we're gonna check it out but let's process
this ah I thought there would be one AGT performance
that wouldn't make me cry but I guess that
was wishful thinking Roland What A vibe okay
I absolutely love when I hear singers that
sing from the heart haven't had any formal
training and can be this captivating it just
kind of goes to show that it's not necessarily
about this like absolute technical Perfection
always it's almost like there was a switch
that went off where he was getting through
the nerves which is completely normal I mean
you start the song you're kind of getting
settled in you're making sure everything feels
right and then you're like okay and then it's
kind of like you can see this flip and it's
like right about here let's see [Music]
yes so it's almost like he's there and he
starts picking up speed and then he's like
oh I feel good I'm gonna go for this obviously
the arrangement right makes him feel that
elevated moment right there but he sees that
he's got the audience really with him now
that's where you really start to hear a lot
of the texture he starts giving me more passion
more emotion more Soul because he knows he's
in control of the of the driver's seat as
I would say also let's keep in mind that he
is learning this phonetically he doesn't speak
the language singing in English is not necessarily
an easy thing the vowel shapes aren't always
very pleasant it's a challenge yeah foreign
[Applause] [Music] [Applause]
Heidi that hug really worked
I don't think you could have done it better
Mike dropped you left it all on that stage
you were 100 you should be very proud of yourself
I have a feeling you're gonna have to stop
fishing because this is where you need it
to be yeah you were so nervous I genuinely
thought for one moment you weren't going to
be able to do this and then that happened
and it actually made me love this audition
even more and I really like you that was a
great idea brilliant thank you so much thank
you I agree with what Simon said you know
so much Simon no it's okay I think he gets
excited his favorite judge oh this is go give
him a hug ha
he's been so tender this season from what
I've seen kind of sweet [Applause]
please [Music]
I gotta say that I think Simon's absolutely
right it's the emotion and we could feel your
heart and I think that everybody just heard
a life-changing moment [Applause]
number two second yes yes four yeses [Applause]
let's go [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I saw
you were so emotional um there's no space
inside in his heart about his happiness right
now the joy ah really everything they said
I completely agree with we could sit here
and break down technically some of the things
that he's naturally doing that he's caught
on to really I say this over and over again
why I started doing this kind of content on
this channel to listen to watch to take in
what the singers you admire are doing so that
you can build on those tools and find your
own way make your own path and I know that
I could I could hear Roland you know doing
original music and get doing stuff that's
kind of Blues and rock and soul and has all
the heart passion and intensity that he needs
to move people and that's really what it's
all about like I always say I am gonna link
Valencia Theater seating below thank you once
again to them for sponsoring this video they
are draped in semi-analini Italian Napa leather
it is so buttery soft I mean you run your
hand across these things and it is incredible
you settle into it and it's just like oh being
wrapped in a warm hug and if you prefer a
vegan option they have that as well which
I absolutely love they have this beautiful
perforated French Diamond stitching they have
Chrome cup holders a little area where you
can add accessories I would love to get the
tray accessory the memory control panel is
also Chrome it's absolutely beautiful I heard
some people mentioning that the first edition
had a light that wouldn't turn off so in this
2.0 version you can turn off the light you
can turn off the RGB lights or you have seven
different ones to choose from so the cup holder
lights up there's LED lights on the bottom
and it's really cool to set up the concert
slash movie Vibe if that's what you're going
for there's some great storage where I can
add some headphones I can add a charging cable
for both the headphones and a phone there's
USBC and USB and the storage is so luxurious
because it's like lined in velor whose idea
was that I want to shake their hand it's absolutely
awesome but what's even more awesome is I
can set the lumbar support to exactly how
I need it the headrest is adjustable so it's
not just that it's reclining but you also
have all these little extra adjustments they're
a big part of the set now they're a big part
of this channel make sure you check out the
original video more of this artist and more
on Valencia theater seats below I hope to
see you guys next time take care guys [Music]
