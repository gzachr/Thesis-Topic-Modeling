This is Pinoy life,
Here in the Philippines,
I use a flashlight
Cuz there's no electricity
In my barangay
Can't open the lights, can't see!
Yeah!
Where's Kuya?
I'll be walking down the street, I'm looking
for balut,
My daddy said if you don't eat this, then
you're not Filipino
Are you ready, hey, are you ready for this?
A Philippine delicacy
Just peel the shell and add asin,
The best part is the beak,
Yeah
Balut is a fetal duck
The juices I love to suck,
And another egg done, and another egg done,
Another one bites the duck
I am a Pinoyboy
Smart boy
Totoy
And I use papaya soap to wash my face
I'm courting Mary Grace
She says no way!
I'll try again tomorrow with makeup on my
face
I am feelin', feelin' gwapo
Feelin', feelin' gwapo
Nanay just killed a pig,
Now we can cook some lechon,
Paksiw, sisig, chicharron,
Oh my, I found 10 pesos,
I will go outside and buy some buko juice,
Pinas ooohhh all we need is a little rice,
With ulam, this will last us til tomorrow
This is called sinigang
I love it very sour.
I see a little silhouette of bar
I will drink, get lasheng,
Ooh bangoong with sour mango,
Videoke time and
San miguel with ice for me!
Filipino
Filipino
Filipino
Filipino in Tondo
It's the only thing
I know how to cook
This stuff's easy to make
Very quick, when I'm lazy to cook!
All you need is a pot, turn on, the stove,
and you're done
We eat pancit canton with bread
Some even like it with an egg
Oh Mama Sitas, Mam Sitas
All we need is rice and nilaga,
Bottles of C2
For my barkada
I'm riding, ooohh I'm riding,
We're riding on a jeepney
Para po!
I need to get off!
This is life in our,
Southasian country
So always remember
We have all the power, Philippines
We are Filipino.
