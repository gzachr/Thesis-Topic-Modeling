so today we are on the island of sikihor on 
the southern part this area is called san juan  
and this is awesome little island it's in the 
middle part of the philippines but unfortunately  
i just ran out of gas the scooter that 
i rented from the place that i'm staying  
uh there's no gas in it gentleman right here 
is cool he he went to uh this little place here  
he's going to grab me a liter of uh gas for it 
okay so here we are at the tugboat dive sanctuary  
and it's just off the road right here just 
right here you come down this little road  
and i guess you gotta walk through here just to 
the beach is this the dive sanctuary all right
okay so i got my fins and i got my snorkel  
it's time to go jump in there and see if we can 
see some fishes okay so actually i just talked  
to this gentleman here nixon they got the boat 
right there i'm gonna they're gonna go out here
i'm gonna hop on i think he's just gonna hook me 
up because there's a couple that's going out there  
doing some scuba so i think he's gonna drop me off 
out there with them so i can get the primo footage
man it is deep out here this was a lot deeper 
than i thought it was going to be honestly so  
hopefully he said we can see some sea 
turtles so hopefully we can find some
so
do
oh my god that was insane oh that was insane
wow that was crazy man i'm so glad that dude 
dropped me off of that boat because that was like  
so that was some snorkeling i've never seen before 
and i hope the camera picked it up we'll see i  
didn't see any turtles he told me to go to the 
turtle area and honestly uh i was trying to dive  
and i couldn't really figure it all out this 
i figured out how to pop the pressure you're  
actually supposed to put your chit down and then 
clear your ears because there's a lot of air still  
in your throat so that totally did the trick 
so you can dive much deeper when you do that  
but man that was amazing that was seriously 
amazing this place is insane this is absolutely  
gorgeous so let's throw the drone up in the 
air now and see what it looks like from above
so
so
so all i have to say about this beach is wow 
that's all i got just wow this was this was the  
coolest snorkeling i've personally ever done in my 
life and i'm wondering if i i think i might have  
been to some other beaches where it was that good 
i just didn't go out deep enough but this two boat  
marine sanctuary here on the san juan the southern 
part of sikihor amazing amazing that gentleman was  
cool and he uh he let me go out on the boat so 
that's pretty awesome that really helped out  
because i wouldn't have gone out that far it was 
far honestly because i was all alone i was scared  
i was scared coming back i'm not gonna lie i asked 
about sharks i'm thinking about sharks and he said  
he'd never seen a shark so it was pretty far out 
there but it was nice you know i came back in  
got some great footage so anyways i hope you 
enjoyed this video this beach is amazing um if you  
ever come to the philippines come to siquijor it's 
a little bit of a trek it's kind of out of the way  
you can actually fly in here or you can fly 
into dumaguete and take a ferry over but i  
mean it's just it's beautiful and it's like 
the country life out here it's so nice so  
anyways i hope you enjoyed this video thank 
you for watching and we'll see you next time
you
