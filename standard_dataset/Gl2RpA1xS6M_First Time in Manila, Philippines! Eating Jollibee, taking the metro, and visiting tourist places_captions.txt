good morning everyone we're Nicole and Mico 
welcome back to our discovering the Philippines  
Series where we travel around the country to 
learn more about the culture and for me as a  
Filipino who's lived outside the Philippines 
for way too long learn more about what it means  
to be Filipino if you caught our previous 
video you'll already know that the moment  
that we landed in the Philippines we were quickly 
whisked away to a distant relative surprise 30th  
birthday party so today is finally the day 
where we are going out and exploring Manila
all right guys first stop of the day is known 
as BGC here in Manila which stands for Bonifacio  
Global City I knew I wouldn't remember and it's 
known as like just a beautiful like place to come  
and do some really high-end shopping it's a very 
big commercial District I think there's like quite  
a lot of work options in the area as well like 
very businessy folks it is not very busy right  
now although typically it is but it's actually 
because we're still here a little early nothing's  
open I think it's 9 30. things open around 10 so 
all we've come for really is coffee as we want a  
really nice coffee this morning yeah apparently 
it's like a beautiful like walking Street a  
very very nice place for pedestrians yes and I'm 
hoping a little bit of coffee will just Elevate  
the entire walk-in experience but we gotta find 
one that's open that's the hard part right now  
okay my love yes because they look amazing oh it 
looks it was expensive but oh man it's really good  
I think this like the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf 
we've seen this like there seems to be a chain  
here um it's beautiful honestly inside like 
there's good working space and like really  
nice comfy chairs reminds me of a Starbucks so 
if you're a digital Nomad you need it's not to  
work this would be a good one so we've been in 
Manila for a little while now we haven't done  
a ton of exploring and today is really that first 
day but what we've noticed so far is that there's  
no shortage of Comforts and conveniences here 
in Manila oh my god there are so many like uh  
restaurants and chains and shopping centers and 
so many great like places to get a good coffee  
and just yeah be immersed in like this Mega City 
it was a sign I just saw and it said that because  
there's a ton of cats here which is like kind of 
weird that it says that the cat population here  
is actually really controlled so they catch them 
they they are new to them and then they release  
them back here and then volunteers feed them so 
they ask you not to feed them because they get  
lots of food oh that's cool wow wow trippy this 
is the future folks newest billboard it's on the  
it's got a corner the billboard has a corner 
that's pretty that's pretty cool well look
that's so cool you know I gotta say I 
swear I have seen more dogs and strollers  
than I have seen babies in strollers people 
really love their dogs here yeah I love it
I love it
thank you
so that was the Manila Metro Network holy man 
sometimes you're gonna be very busy yeah but  
it's actually like pretty smooth like easy 
to get a ticket easy to jump on board it's  
simple to use you just gotta be ready to be 
squashed like sardines yeah but now we are  
starving and we're looking for lunch and 
although there are lots of good options  
around us there is a place that I've been 
very excited to visit and uh it's not the  
first for me been there a long time ago but 
it will be the first vertical I'm so excited
those are so cool those are the tricycles 
and uh we haven't been on one yet uh but  
they're everywhere I really want to take 
one today and yeah we really want to get  
on one I'm hoping we can also Nicole just told 
me that the guy on the tricycle did one of these  
a very classic Filipino in fact I have lots 
of pictures of me like six or seven years old  
you know buds yeah first coming to Canada 
doing this what is that I don't know why  
we do it's just one of those 
things this is very Filipino
don't laugh at me I'm doing that we 
should make that our thumbnail [Music]
There It Is I've been waiting like 15 years  
this is the legendary Filipino Jollibee one of 
the most popular if not the most popular fast  
food chain in the Philippines I think their 
specialty is like mostly fried chicken and  
rice whatever you want okay but there's spaghetti 
and other Filipino good foods like Filipino style  
spaghetti it is super good I've always wanted to 
eat a job it's been a long long time over ah it's  
almost over 25 years I'm learning so much about 
Mikko so one of the things that you can buy here  
is rice and a burger patty and he used to do this 
at home we'd have leftover burgers and he would  
just cook up rice and just have the Patty with 
the rice and I'm like what are you doing I never  
knew that I stole that off from the jollibee's 
menu it's in your blood it's in my blood I guess  
I thought it was just my own concoction because 
I wanted some mean rice I'm pretty sure this is  
rice oh yeah it's rice I actually thought it was 
like a little burger patty I saw people getting  
on like a burger patty and chicken that's a lot no 
it's rice just to be clear I'm pretty sure you can  
yeah a burger patty and chicken oh great game that 
actually smells amazing do I use these really okay  
it feels very strange to eat fried chicken with a 
fork and a spoon but here we are I assume I assume  
I'm supposed to put some of this on here right 
how am I doing are you still doing good all right
oh my God
it's very good it's like elevated KFC that is 
really good gravy what if we get fried chicken  
Amigo's family we buy KFC but then in my head 
you get KFC and Fries but they always made rice  
and we had cabs in rice now I get it this is 
where that comes from it's a beautiful thing  
fried chicken and rice now Nicole finally gets 
guess where it's coming from I understand it  
took 15 years but we're here oh that was great 
it was so good this is so good right now I would  
say that they should put up a Jolly Bee in every 
corner of the city and every street corner but I  
think that's already happened because there's 
jollibee's everywhere so good it tastes like  
home all right so we're gonna try the spaghetti 
now the spaghetti is like very different in the  
Philippines it's not like the spaghetti we would 
get in North America or Europe the spaghetti  
sauce is a little bit sweeter than you would 
expect and my favorite although not Nicole's  
favorite but they have like small pieces of hot 
dogs in it yeah okay you're gonna try this bite  
because I won't eat hot dog oh my God we're good 
I don't eat hot dogs so we're gonna just try the  
so exactly how my mom used to make it sweet 
spaghetti sauce uh hot dogs a little bit  
of cheese that was very good it's really 
sweet I think I gotta love our time here
all right we finished our Joby lunch that 
was amazing I feel like the time just like  
disappeared like all that fried chicken 
made us a little bit sleepy honestly I'm  
actually quite tired but we just crossed 
the street and we're now at Rizzo Park and  
it's a beautiful Green Space really big 
Park uh there's a very famous Filipino  
man Jose Rizzo we'll talk about him more 
as we get to the Bane statue but the park  
was named after him and right now it's just 
a really nice walking area lots of people  
around it looks like there would be I think 
a fountain here like there's a big water just
like turned on there I wish it was on I bet 
it's beautiful maybe there's a cool light show  
or something that we don't know about maybe all 
right as we make our way to this statue I thought  
it would take a second to share our impression so 
far of the Philippines well I guess kind of really  
only on manila but so far so we got out of the 
Philippines and I have to say a few things so I  
love that here in Manila we're very lucky in that 
most people speak really good English I didn't  
know if it's common knowledge but Philippines has 
two national languages Tagalog like Filipino and  
English so here in Manila especially everyone 
speaks English which is a real treat very easy  
to get around yeah it makes it very simple I 
also love that like as a female traveler I just  
feel really comfortable here I get to wear 
what I want I could just I don't it doesn't  
matter how I look I fit in and no one's like no 
one's giving me lots of stairs just like looks of  
curiosity but uh no more than any other person 
that is really lovely however holy man traffic  
yeah traffic could be crazy yeah and besides that 
I'm just like I love the people hey yeah it's like  
everyone's friendly and kind really polite really 
polite I think that's a great way to put it I love  
that people are so plate like you walk on the 
street and you're in each other's ways they're  
like make effort to get out of your way and they 
bump in you they're like oh I'm so sorry I'm so  
sorry so in a lot of ways it actually feels very 
similar to home in Canada that way like people are  
just really conscious of like this space they're 
taking up and how they're imposing on you it's  
really nice what I'll also say about walking 
around this park I feel like this is probably  
the only place in the world that maybe just maybe 
I might find a statue of a prominent figure that  
might look like me we made it to the original 
Monument I would say it looks like you I don't  
know maybe he's got really high cheekbones he 
looks pretty nice he could be an uncle maybe maybe  
so he is a very very cool guy there's some signs 
around here we've been doing some reading so he is  
a what was the word you used Patriot oh political 
activist political activist I liked this in the  
late 1800s uh particularly when the Spanish were 
still colonizing Philippines so the Spanish were  
here from like the 1500s to the very late 1800s so 
this guy was actually killed for treason against  
the Spanish in 1896 and what is really cool is 
Philippines actually gained independence in 1898  
so his death was one of the big things that really 
sparked a huge part of the movement and to get out  
from under the Spanish also what is really cool 
to me about this particular uh like sculpture is  
that his the remains of Rizzo the guy Jose Rizal 
actually moved here and they're under the statue  
they're moving in 1912. wow I know right the 
statue's been here since the very early 1900s
so we're entering just about to enter like the 
walled City here which is called intramurals  
intramurals um but anyways there's this beautiful 
garden we're like oh let's walk in there and the  
guards are like harvesting mangoes from the trees 
here whoa hey you see that that was caught it wow  
we've made it to intramuros intramuros I said 
it right I always forget the words which is like  
uh walled City uh in Manila it's a very old city 
and it was built by the Spanish built by Spanish  
in the 1500s and I guess it was meant to be like 
their political capital of Asia like the Spanish  
Empire's political capital of Asia so nowadays 
it's just like a beautiful place to come around  
because of colonial buildings like they're very 
beautiful here yeah there's lots to look at the  
architecture is really neat it's like their 
Spanish home Basin they've left over left all  
the buildings behind and now they're all bars and 
restaurants now they're all bars restaurant and  
cafes which is all right churches and then and 
there's a massive Church huge beautiful church  
right here I don't know the name but we're gonna 
see if we can find out but yeah it is uh it's just  
nice to walk around intramuros and gonna feel for 
the very Lively atmosphere atmosphere people are  
walking around taking lots of photos drinking 
coffees very nice all right so we're inside  
the Manila Cathedral now and it's a beautiful 
Church it is very well decorated at the center  
at the very front there's like a very gorgeous 
Statue Of An Angel it looks really really nice  
fun fact to know about the Philippines a lot 
of people are Christian I think it's like 80  
Roman Catholic is a religious base and then I 
think maybe another 10 is like other variations  
of Christianity and then the rest of that 
is like Hinduism Muslim very cool [Music]  
foreign just like that we are in Fort Santiago 
which is like within intramuros it is like a  
what do you call it like a fort so it's like 
a stronghold um that the Spanish built soon  
after they like built and declared Manila a 
city they built this every every good walled  
City needs a port right yeah it's easy to 
get into though not very big defenses just  
75 pesos each and we're inside the Fortress 
it's beautiful lots of Green Space beautiful
very easy way to go for Spanish weren't in 
a country is if they have a plaza de armas  
the plaza thought of us are we 
back in South America I feel like  
I'm suddenly transported to like 
I don't know Cuenca or something
[Music]  
just like that we're at the water just get popped 
out right the water here Nicole would like me to  
point out that there's a guy on a boat very 
excited about it and she's very excited about  
it this spot is actually really cool because I 
can see like across the river there's like this  
obviously residential area and I can like see a 
bunch of guys playing basketball which is a big  
deal in the Philippines and like lots of very tiny 
little houses along the river here I think that is  
something that's been really interesting about 
Manila as we go around there are obviously like  
really rich places like BCG where we were earlier 
today the GC Mika says like we were earlier today  
and then there is also a lot of poverty here 
here in Manila and I think seeing like small  
areas like that with houses just kind of over on 
the river it's a small little piece of that so you  
definitely can find both here while we're at the 
end of the fort I think this is probably the best  
place to end the Vlog I actually learned a lot 
about Filipino history and culture as did I it's  
really cool yeah as did I hope you guys enjoyed 
coming around with us there's so much to do here  
in Manila this is just a taste of it we hope you 
enjoyed it checking out the city with us today  
make sure you hit subscribe we will catch you guys 
in the next one thanks for watching I love that  
part of Filipino culture where singing is like 
a really big thing it's a very musical cultures
because this guy's been training on the karaoke  
machine you know it's whole 
life his whole life [Music]
