i want to make sapin sapin from the philippines  
i like the dessert i have eaten it a few times 
but i have no idea how to make it so please help  
me okay and let's try to make sapin-sapin it's as 
tasty as it is pretty soft chewy and topped with  
golden latik this filipino steamed glutinous rice 
cake is a delicious midday snack or after dinner  
dessert photo looks really good this recipe from 
kawaling pinoy i need to have some coconut milk  
and coconut cream for the latik i don't have that 
so also i don't have glutinous rice flour anymore  
so basically i need to go to the store 
and get something do have though is sugar  
condensed milk and colorings like 
this ube color glutinous rice flour
some coconut milk and i got some coconut cream 
for the latik let me also try to get some  
extra coloring i think we got all 
the ingredients for our sapinsapin  
now my question for you is do you eat sapin 
sapin at home or do you get it for takeout  
i guess we can use these shapes i thought they 
would look really nice for sapin-sapin because  
sometimes i see these shapes being used for 
the tiny sapin sapin i also see the bigger  
one but i think it's nice to make the smaller 
one also i only have this small steamer which  
can fit around four pieces so i think that 
should be fine let us start with the latik  
i like that word latik sounds like really filipino 
we'll heat up this pan first give it a good shake
let's pour this in wow it's already hot
i'm gonna stir this quickly it has been a while 
since i made latiq but i think it's always nice  
flavor for desserts you need to be very patient 
for this but as you can see it starts to thicken  
already nice nice naman now this starter 
looks much better no i think it's almost  
done look at the oil there's a lot 
of oil coming out so let's sift this
oh this lattik smells so good
next i'll be mixing in one can of coconut 
milk this is for the sapinsapin so i got this  
recipe online it's not my own recipe but i 
will add 130 grams of glutinous rice flour  
about half a can of condensed milk 
sweetened condensed milk and 60 grams  
of sugar actually i noticed that i should not 
boil this so i turned off the heat already  
but there's a few lumps there i guess i supposed 
to just mix it in a bowl instead of in the pan  
so it was not so hot so maybe i can still save 
it by adding a little bit extra coconut milk  
that was my mistake but i added a bit of extra 
coconut milk so it's still kind of a liquid  
batter i hope this will work let's try now i'm 
going to add this to three separate bowls okay
to one we are going to add the pandan mixture this 
smells really good sorry i said pandan but i mean  
ube of course the other one is yellow i use a 
little bit of the coconut oil from the lattik
and just use it inside put it 
here just to prevent sticking  
for the sapin sapin so i think we're supposed to 
start with the ube filling first for the bottom  
now we're supposed to steam 
these for about 10 minutes or so
now this is 10 minutes later 
you see they become really  
firm so i'm gonna add the next color 
which is yellow so like that i hope there  
i hope there's enough space for the 
white one still finally the white one
i hope this will turn out good guys i took the 
first batch out a little bit too quick so they're  
a little bit soft but i'm gonna make another batch 
so i put some coconut oil here and some lattik so  
i think they still came out pretty nice this 
is the upside down version maybe the shape is  
not really that good but they're really yummy and 
please let me know in the comments what you think  
of sapin-sapin this dessert from the philippines 
and this video of course maraming salamat po hmm
