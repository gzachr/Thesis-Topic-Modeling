We were going to go to the street market
right outside here
but the rain was so deep
It was probably about an inch or
two inches of water covering our sandals
and it was all really dirty
especially by the eating area
so we elected not to
submit our feet to torture and dirt
and we ended up at
Chowking instead
we are at Chowking
which is
filipino-chinese kind of fusion
looks like you got yourself a wonton soup here
with the side of chicharones
virtually flavorless
it's a little bit
salty
really picks up that sauce flavor
with the chilies and the vinegar quite
well actually nice
light and crunchy
very good
and a pork style bun here
looks pretty delicious
that's pretty big
soft on the outside
it's got some beef
or pork or some sort of meat on the
inside we've got a small bite of this
very large bun
get some of the sauce with it
the bun is very soft
that sauce is quite
spicy
that's a very nice pork bun that's
huge
very soft not overly chewy, pork has a
nice flavor to it
very good
this looks good I'm gonna try
some of the broth first
but you choking me the wanton marina
that's good like an instant style like a
ramen style instant noodle broth rescue
they better serve sesame seeds
noodles in it
noodles are nice they're probably like
an instant style noodle broth has some
oil in it so I add some fattiness to the
taste and then they have these little
dumplings on the inside
that's nice - it had some meat to it
very soft very chewy
this is the chao fan
the beef and the dumplings that we're
going to try these are deep fried
they're crispy on the outside it's a
little out in here but I'm gonna give it
a try
and the rice is nice very nice lightly
seasoned has some nice beef in it
reminds me of sort of the rice that the
right sets I pop by stick in it's very
good good meal this will fill my stomach
up
this whole meal was 290 pesos
with drinks
which is five dollars fifty us
good deal for your meal
