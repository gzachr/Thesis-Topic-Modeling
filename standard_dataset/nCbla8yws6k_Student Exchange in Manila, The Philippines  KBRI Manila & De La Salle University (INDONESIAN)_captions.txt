now, we are in a grab
heading to...
Deb, please say something
we are heading to 
Indonesian Embassy
for an event called "Ngopi Yuk!"  (Let's have Coffee!), right?
yes!
that's right!
initially, we wanted to ride a jeepney
but it was too hard 
and we didn't know
which route we should take
so, like it or not
afraid of getting lost
yeah!
so we booked a grab instead
bye bye^^
so, earlier, we got off the car
but it seemed like we made a mistake
we stopped in front of 
a Chinese restaurant instead
right, Deb?
yes!
we got lost
we got lost
apparently we need to walk
how far?
600 metres left
600m left
we need to walk
good
turned back!
turned back
so, what's the point of using grab?
how genius we are!
but the drop-off point in the app 
was correct, right?
yeah
didn't know
maybe it was error
eEeeEeHeHhHHhh
I almost fell
be careful!
almost fell lol
we are dressed in white
looking holy
right, guys?
we are wearing white 
I'm feeling holy
Debo!
eh?

for my essay
I need a fast and stable connection

maybe in a bit
and go down in a minute
