- Hello there it's me again.
And I am here at a McDonald's
in the Philippines.
I apologize if the music is a little loud
I'm not a very big fast food guy
but I love trying the
different iterations, I guess
variations that McDonald's
have of its menus
and countries around the world,
because they always kind of
they try to view a little
bit of local flavor, you know
and cater to the local palette.
And so already here, I have a bunch
of very unique
uniquely Filipino McDonald's dishes
which I think will be fun to try.
I figured why not wrap up this season
Solivagant with a little bonus video.
That's a little less heavy, a little bit
maybe a little bit more
relaxed, and we could just
explore some very tasty,
Filipino, fast food.
I've already had jolly
beam as you guys saw
in the first episode of Solivagant
love jolly beam
eaten their several times
since I've been here
but this is my first time
trying McDonald's here
in the Philippines and I'm excited to dig
on in everything I've ordered.
Here are things that were suggested
to me from the Filipino
users on our discord servers.
So I'm excited to dig into
their local favorites.
And by the way
if you haven't joined
our discord server yet,
link is in the description below,
come on through,
come party with us,
but I'm gonna start digging
through this already
because this bad boy is
melting the coke float.
I know jolly be, has a
great coke float as well.
Apparently the McDonald's
coke float is even better.
I guess the Filipinos really
love their, their coke floats.
Maybe it has something to do
with the weather here being so hot.
I don't know, but I'm excited.
That's a coke float.
Very, I mean, it's very refreshing.
It's Coke with McDonald's
ice cream on top of it.
You can't go wrong with that.
We have a little bit of ice cream here.
That's good.
I do love McDonald's Sundaes.
So that was basically McDonald's
Sundae on top of Coke.
You can't go wrong people.
You just can't go wrong with that.
I'm happy with it-
Oh- Harry Styles

Great mood music for this,
YouTube won't think so.
They're probably trying
copyright strike me.
I don't care.
I really ate a fry just
now. They're great.
I won't lie.
McDonald's fries. Probably one
of the best fast food fries.
Worst fast food fries are burger king.
I'm sorry to say it.
but burger king do not
know how to make fries.
I don't know if you guys prefer
crispy or, or soft fries.
I don't like crispy fries.
I like it when they're nice and soft.
I love that they present the fries
in this nice bowl and not
just like in that, you know
ratty piece of paper that
we get in the US normally.
So this is very nice.
Now let's move on to our mains.
These were two
of the most popular suggestions
on our discord server.
This is the chicken filet
chicken filet ala king.
I'm actually not too sure
what that sauce is in it.
It looks fun.
It's a fun looking sauce.
It smells fantastic.
It's a rice based dish,
which is gonna be great.
I'm sure something I've come to learn here
in the Philippines is that the
Filipinos love their chicken
and they do their chicken very, very well.
They cooked their chicken very well.
Just the other night when I
had the chicken joy sandwich
from jolly bee with my friend JL.
That was honestly, that
was truly the best fast
food chicken sandwich I've ever had.
Holy f****** s***
- It's especially good tonight.
I don't know why
- it's like parti-
This isn't the first time I've had this
but this is like, this is great.
It's great tonight.
- It was fantastic. So I'm
excited to eat this chicken
cuz the Filipinos know
how to cook their chicken.
And we have here mixed
spaghetti, which is a
A spaghetti dish, which I
think is probably gonna be
like the jolly spaghetti, a
jolly bee where the sauce is
in your typical kind of like
spaghetti marinara red sauce.
I believe that the spaghetti, at jolly bee
the sauce is a little bit more
of a sweeter element to it.
And I assume it's gonna be the same here.
And I'm seeing bits of hot dog
in there too, which is also
present in the jolly spaghetti.
A really fantastic uniquely Filipino way
of eating spaghetti, which is
with a sweeter tomato sauce
and little bits of hot dog.
Snip, snip, snip, snip,
snip, snip, snip, stop.
- Snip, snap.
Snip snap.
- We do have another burger
here. The ebe burger.
It does say ebe burger Japan though.
So I don't think this is as
uniquely Filipino, but it was
on their limited edition menu.
And so I figured what
the hell I'm gonna start
with the chicken filet.
A la king.
I'm gonna get myself a
nice bite of the chicken
with the sauce and the rice.
Nice little bite of everything.
You guys see that bad boy
Let's give it a whirl
- That is f****** good.
That is f****** delicious.
And again, the chicken!
Filipinos know how to cook
their g****** chicken.
I swear to God, even at a fast food drive
like McDonald's I genuinely do
not know what their sauce is
but I'm vibing on it.
The fun yellow sauce.
I don't know what it is. And
maybe I don't wanna know.
Maybe I never need to know
it's moist but the fry on
the outside is really nice.
It's juicy
PopPop likes it
Now let's wash it down with
a little tasty beverage.
Just to give you some perspective.
I think the temperature right now outside
is about 35 degrees Celsius.
So that's about like up in
the nineties Fahrenheit.
So it's hot.
And so when you get a
nice, oh [mumbles] now
Mixed spaghetti ladies and gentlemen,
we're gonna mix is bad boy up.
- Ooh.
- I had a jolly spaghetti on
our live stream the other day
because if you don't know, I stream live
on Twitch every weekend.
So when I was in the Philippines,
I did some IRL streams
of my adventures out there,
including trying Jolly Bee
for the first time.
So if you also aren't
following my twitch channel
The link will be will be down below
I Polish off that jolly spaghetti
at jolly bee.
So I'm pretty sure I'm gonna
Polish this bad boy off too.
We'll get a little bit
of hot dog in it too.
Whip it up, baby, whip it up
- So this might sound
blasphemous to Filipinos
but I can't taste too much
of a difference between this
and the Jolly spaghetti.
They're both fantastic.
That's all that really matters
but they both taste kind of similar
and there's nothing wrong with that.
It's a great Filipino take on spaghetti.
There may be Italians
watching this right now
pulling their hair out.
They'd say, what the hell
have they done to spaghetti?
But Hey, that's life.
How do you say that in Italian?
[Attempts To Speak Italian]
No, that's Spanish
[Attempts To Speak Italian]
I don't f****** know.
So both of these primary
Filipino McDonald's dishes
are both fantastic.
I can't decide which one I like better
but I'm swirling more to
the spaghetti right now.
So I think I do prefer the spaghetti.
I remember for my Jolly Bee experience
that the chat was telling
me to mix things together.
So I'm gonna try something a little wild.
Lets mix a bit of this chicken,
With a little bit of spaghetti.
Cause I feel like that's probably what
I feel like that's what the
Filipinos would want me to do.
And so I'm gonna mix that a
little bit of chicken in there.
That's f****** good.
I'm not gonna pretend to
be the first person to
discover this pairing, but that is good.
That is good.
Look at that
So I just Wolf that down
in less than five minutes
which I think tells you
how much I liked it.
Fantastic. The last thing I'm
gonna try is the Ebi burger.
It is marked as Japan.
So I'm wanting to assume
this is not a traditionally
Filipino McDonald's dish,
but we'll give it a whirl.
And here it is.
Ooh, does look tasty.
Oh, it's another chicken
sandwich of sorts.
I mean, it looks pretty
straightforward of a sandwich.
I don't know what's gonna
make it very Japanese.
I dunno if they're using
like Japanese flavorings
or Japanese flavor in their
sauce, but we gonna try
There's shrimp in there.
Ebi means shrimp.
That makes sense.
I'm pretty sure Ebi sushi is shrimp sushi.
That is a little shrimp in there.
Cause at first I didn't realize, you know
what made this just so special?
Cause it just looked
like at chicken sandwich
but now I realize they're
shrimp in this bad boy
and it tastes good.
Well, I've just stuff myself
in about under 10 minutes.
So I, I, I think I'm
pretty much done for now.
I'll take the rest to go
before we wrap up those
since this is most likely the final video
of this season in the Philippines
I just wanted to say a
very, very, very, very
very big and sincere.
Thank you to all of you for watching
and supporting the videos that I produced
on this expedition travel
content is something
I've been wanting to do for so long.
And so that's why I just
decided to do it on my own.
Having produced this entire
trip on my own, paying for it
myself to support that has
been shown by Dewal means a lot
to me because that's what
helps make these possible
and hopefully makes future seasons
in other countries possible
because I would love to do more of this.
I would love to visit other countries
explore other cultures,
dive into their stories.
And it's your support that
truly makes it possible
because if you weren't
watching well, I mean
that it would be hard for me
to justify spending, you know
the money required for
me to visit those places.
But because you're here because
you've been so supportive
every single watch, every
single, like every comment
it means it me, it truly
makes a difference.
It means a lot.
And so I appreciate it.
Thank you so much.
I hope you've enjoyed the videos.
I've shot here in the Philippines.
There's still, you know, a lot
of learnings I'm taking away
from this and that will
just serve to better
improve the quality of
my future travel videos.
And so I, I truly believe
that it's only onwards upwards from here.
And so thank you for being here
for the very first ever
addition of Solivagant
and here's to many, many, many, many
many more adventures to come together.
Cheers. You f****** criminals.
