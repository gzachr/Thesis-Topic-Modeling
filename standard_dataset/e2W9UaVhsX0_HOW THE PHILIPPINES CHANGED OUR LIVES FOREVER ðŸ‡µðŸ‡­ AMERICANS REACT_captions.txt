hey guys welcome back to another vlog guys we 
have been in the philippines since what like  
let's see martial age like four months it's been 
four months now that we set foot on this beautiful  
country so let's go ahead and go down memory lane 
and go through the experiences the amazing food  
and the connections we've had with you all it's 
our love letter to you guys we've literally had  
the greatest time of our lives here and we kind 
of want to show you some of the things you haven't  
seen that we do and guys we have some news in this 
video that we like to share with you guys so make  
sure you stick around it's going to be worth it 
we love you we thank you and let's get this going
oh cheers
honestly you guys ever since we've gotten to the 
philippines we've never felt any more welcome by  
not just you guys all of our subscribers but all 
the people that we've met thus far i know we say  
we love the philippines a lot and i'm sure every 
vlogger does in the world i mean how can you not  
however we mean it like we genuinely mean we love 
the philippines and 99.999 of that is because of  
the people i mean if it wasn't for some of 
our subscribers we would have never visited  
half the places we've gone to especially like at 
the transcendental highway we've had our friend  
who took us out for lunch we had our other friend 
take us around our neighborhood and have us try  
different foods and now we've had this friend 
here having us explore balamban and getting  
to know its people and its rich history first 
off we're in somebody's home but it's not just  
somebody it's now our friend so how this all 
started with one of our subscribers reach out  
to us on instagram started to have a conversation 
which we love you guys know this right now we love  
talking to you guys and then it just turned into 
a friendship a genuine friendship and then we got  
to know more about each other our lives and then 
they introduced us to other people that they know  
and here we are sitting in the home somebody 
we had no direct connection with no time not  
whatsoever but it's from the the connections 
we made from our subscribers in subscribers  
so to have this extension means a lot to us 
because it makes it feel less homesick and  
makes us feel warm and fuzzy on the inside and you 
guys are part of the family because you guys are  
the like we do this because we're documenting our 
time but it means nothing if we don't have people  
in the other and even this aside guys our whole 
entire time we've been in the philippines these  
are the interactions we've had like the people 
have welcomed us like there was not even one ounce  
of hesitation like smiles like i know this for 
me this is delaying the smiles because literally  
that's all i received there's literally 
nothing but love we've made some of the best  
relationships and connections because being in 
the philippines it's true we might not show every  
every interaction we have i know we're 
vloggers but sometimes we just like  
to immerse ourselves so like we're not gonna 
film everything but like we've had some of the  
best times behind the scenes connecting with 
the people of the philippines and again i  
i don't know i don't know how to say it but 
like thank you for being so welcoming now  
it's like we legit mean it we would have never 
had this experience had we not put our trust  
in you all and getting to know what places 
to go to in the philippines what to do  
what not to do as foreigners and just 
all your recommendations are always  
always like on the forefront of our minds so thank 
you thank you thank you don't be shy if you are in  
cebu or if you happen anywhere or we happen to 
be where you live yeah let us know we'll meet  
you up for a quick meal quick chat anything 
to get to know where you're from who you are  
and places that we should visit we're 
down to meet up basically we're we're not  
oh hell when it's strong um we're down to meet 
people like we like to talk we like to learn  
this is uh we learn something new every single 
day and it's something you can't go and google  
and learn this stuff you wouldn't we 
wouldn't know half the things we've  
learned if we were just relying on google or like 
the internet mm-hmm true it's it's because of you  
guys and what you tell us and teach us so yeah 
you see us say hi do not be afraid if we look busy  
we're probably not or we might be but still come 
say hi we can't tell you the amount of times we  
sat at the starbucks and we've been approached 
and we're taken back by it because they're like  
um do they want a table or wait are you speaking 
to us we like look back oh awesome oh yeah hi  
yeah so kind we feel at home we do we feel 
at home in the philippines that's the best
is
reason 567 432 one of why we love the philippines 
is for its food we're not food expertise i mean we  
bought we watch a couple of episodes of masterchef 
and hell's kitchen but we would say that the food  
here has been surprising to say the least i think 
the best part about it is there's a huge variety  
like it doesn't every island you go to every 
region it's different so it feels like you're  
always trying something new which is great 
because we're not used to that actually and guys  
if you go to a home and they're cooking dinner 
for you it's like a 30 course meal am i wrong  
the best saying that you will leave the 
philippines knowing is that you will never  
go hungry if you visit any filipinos home i mean 
yeah you're just not you're going to be stuck  
you're going to be like to the point where like 
i don't want to eat if they're like no you got  
to eat if it wasn't for all these invites that 
we've received over the weekend to visit their  
homes we would have never ever been exposed to the 
filipino food that we've had thus far i think our  
friends thank god we've met them and they've been 
put into our lives we're very thankful for that  
they've they've let us try everything everything 
we've gone way out of our comfort zone wait and  
the result of that is that we're walking away with 
some really really favorite yummy food that we now  
know that if we were to look at it at a restaurant 
or even a street food vendor we'll know what it is  
what it should taste like and we'll be comfortable 
ordering it knowing that it's something that we  
enjoy eating yeah it's just and it's funny because 
when we first got here the filipino food we tried  
we liked it but it was like you know it's like 
i like it yeah but i have no interest in trying  
it again type of thing but then when we met 
our friends that would like home cook meals  
and explain it all and prep and we'd help or see 
it like it just tastes completely different so  
home food is just the best food yeah like fried 
sardines i'm obsessed with them cassava ube uh  
really good dessert okay first off ube is mine it 
is and he knows that i'm obsessed with ube if it  
has ube in it sign me up i'm gonna 
eat it i'm probably gonna love it  
i don't know what it is about this stuff i had no 
idea what ube was until i got to the philippines  
and now every time i see it i order it i end up 
loving it and you know what that's my favorite  
food in the philippines he's an uber kind of sort 
of a connoisseur so i know what i'm talking about  
guys also we've learned that the food here brings 
people together if you know them you invite them  
everybody helps like it's it's the type of life 
the filipinos are very very very kind people and  
this isn't this is a very generalization because 
everyone reading that has been beyond kind  
so it makes us want to have that type of 
camaraderie whenever we have a we know food  
brings people together but we haven't seen them 
brought together like this right would you agree  
no i agree i mean they asked this guy i don't know 
how they trusted this guy to cut the lechon at one  
of the fiestas they didn't ask me she told 
me okay you're cutting this it's like okay  
i can't say no to lida food brings people together 
and it's brought us closer to the culture and  
closer to people that we normally 
wouldn't connect with so i'm very thankful
to go patrick oh my god this kid does not 
know how to get patrick what are you doing  
pee star say hi take him anywhere all 
right guys so reason 9 million 700 400  
whatever infinite reason number whatever this 
is that we love the philippines guys there's so  
much to do and we don't mean just 
like go to a mall and do this  
no we're talking like hiking volcanoes 
cliff jumping like stuff you don't get to do  
anywhere else in the world in the philippines has 
literally allowed us to live our adventure dreams  
guys this place is magic like absolute magic it's 
not wrong i mean that slogan of it's more fun in  
the philippines couldn't be any more accurate 
and if it weren't for this beautiful country we  
wouldn't be tapping into our inner child and 
thanks to you all we have fully embraced it  
with all of our jokes all of our karaoke moments 
we've had on our travels and now bringing in the  
third person into our family cute little pizza i 
mean we would have had none of that had it been  
through our experiences here in the philippines 
it's not wrong guys he's not wrong we are living  
our adventure dreams like this being in the 
philippines makes us want to go to survivor  
to be on what is the other show amazing the 
amazing rate like all these things it's because  
the philippines offers adventures and you do 
not get this anywhere else in the world like  
you will be pushed out of your comfort zone and 
that's a great great great thing that's the thing  
the philippines is taught me to get out of your 
comfort zone go live life like we're living life  
and there's still more to do i mean like we want 
to hike mount april we want to go through the  
sand dunes no don't give away everything we're 
going to do no no no no no no no just have to  
stay tuned you want to stay soon all right guys

it's time to give you the news we've been loving 
our time here in the philippines there's still  
seven thousand more islands or so to explore and 
we can't see ourselves reading anytime soon guys
