What do we have here?
Youtube
Hopefully, you're subscribed to me on youtube.
Today, marks the opening of YouTube Space in the Philippines
Right here.
This is Travis Kraft right here
He's a bigger youtuber, I'm a smaller youtuber
The Black Filipino
So I see him here at the YouTube event.
Just wanted to say Hello.
It's nice to meet you.
I'm glad you decided to say Hello.
and there goes his wife right there
His beautiful wife.
We're going to get inside and check it out.
So, we're checking out
the production studios.
The social media queen
for GMA Network.
She was the producer that put me on the show Reel Time.
I know so many of you guys liked me on that show.
What do you think of the set here?
Cool.
So, were back at YouTube Space
because they're going to be holding some production classes.
So, we just finished
the production workshop.
This is not really something I needed.
It was a basic production workshop.
I already have a bachelor's degree in Film.
I came here for Erin
Erin wants to get into videomaking
and filmmaking.
So, Erin was this valuable to you?
What did you learn?
Basically, it's about filmmaking
production and stuff.
I learned a lot.
Some of this stuff
I'll say
it's your first time seeing it.
and things like the exposure triangle
and learning abut aperature, iso
lighting
these are things that you're not going to understand right away
when it's your first time seeing them
but it's a good introduction
so it's in your mind and you can research further
To really learn filmmaking
You really have to do it hands on.
You can't hear someone lecture
and there was some hands on learning experience today.
but really it takes a long time to learn
and even things like the exposure triangle
I know people that have been trying to do photography
and videography for years
and they still struggle with it.
So don't worry too much if you didn't get everything
right away today.
And I'll teach you some more stuff.
Yeah,
you should.
So, right now
we're picking up one of Imabelle's tour clients.
And we're taking him to the airport.
His trip here is done.
Dear, Father God,
thank you for guiding him.
and the woman
the woman that you blessed
to be his future wife.
and to have a family with
Lord, wherever he goes
whatever he does
whoever he talks to
thank you that your wisdom and strength
empowers him
and thank you Lord
that he is blessed because he is blessing others.
Thank you for the safe
great flight back
to America
Lord,
thank you that you have the best for him.
So, I had that video before
at the airport
where I showed how aggressive the porters are.
And people think it's going to be free
but after they take all your bags, they tell you it's going to be P50 per bag.
Well, now
they have all these signs at the airport
warning people
Maybe they saw my video about that.
But it's good that they have these signs posted everywhere now.
I'm so happy that
another tour has been successful.
I'm thankful to see my client have a great time
with his tour.
Plus, he got to meet wonderful people in the Philippines.
Next time,
I would love to manage your tour.
