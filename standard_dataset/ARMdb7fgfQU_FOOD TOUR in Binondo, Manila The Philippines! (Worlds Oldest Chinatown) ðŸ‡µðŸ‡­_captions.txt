today we're in manila the philippines at the 
world's first chinatown also known as binando  
there is a massive selection of food here with 
a mix of chinese filipino and spanish influence  
but mostly chinese this is really delicious 
my name is josie welcome back to my channel or  
welcome if you're new here let's 
go eat in manila the philippines  
okay so we've been dropped here at the binando 
church also known as the minor basilica and we're  
kind of in the middle of literally everything 
that's going on right now as you can tell  
i've got the san lorenzo ruiz sign over there 
and there's just a lot going on there's people  
there's cars there's buses there's jeepneys 
there's everything in this intersection so  
we're just on the walk now down to chinatown to 
have a look around there grab some food grab some  
dumplings whatever whatever else there is but 
let's go have a look let's start our journey
so i didn't actually plan on this 
happening but i've seen a bubble milk  
tea place here and i'm craving a brown 
sugar milk tea so let's start the video  
with that and then we can wander 
onto some food thank you so much
so i got the brown sugar milk tea i 
never actually used to like bubble  
tea and then i tried this one and i like 
it and i haven't been able to branch out  
since so tell me down below what's your 
favorite flavor of bubble tea because  
mine's still brown sugar the good one still 
definitely my favorite yeah delicious we came  
here with empty bellies to have as much food 
as we can so let's get going for some food
so we're just walking along we just found a place 
that just had some like pastries in the front  
counter so we're going to try this we asked her if 
it was a donut and she said no so i'm not exactly  
sure what this is at all uh donut no no but it 
has some kind of glaze over the top and it kind of  
looks fried it kind of looks doughy let's try it 
um it does taste like a doughnut so i'm not sure  
what the name is if you know the name of it tell 
me in the comments but it tastes like a donut if  
the light is going up it's either really hard to 
chew or maybe a little bit of stale i'm not sure  
so there's plenty of them in there which makes 
me think she wouldn't make that many if they were  
going to get stale if this is a little bit fresher 
i think it'd be perfect in saying that it's quite  
substantial because it is so like hard to eat 
and bready straight off the bat we have been to  
chinatown in bangkok and that was sort of more 
of the you know street vendors in the streets  
every cart outside on its own but here i'm 
finding it's not really like that as you can  
see it's kind of restaurants it's kind of 
lined on the side with all these different  
kinds of restaurants but there's not that many 
food stalls um there was a couple of things of  
fruit on the side of the road back there but not 
really like street street food if that makes sense  
but let's go look for something i think we were 
hunting for some dumplings first okay so we're  
here at tasty dumplings and surprise we've ordered 
dumplings we ordered fried dumplings it comes with  
two four six eight eight dumplings and then 
you have the soy sauce here on the side so  
let's try these i don't think i've had fried 
dumplings before only normal dumplings so let's  
give them a go oh that's one i have them 
a lot they're really good either dumplings  
i don't often have dumplings so by no 
means am i a dumplings expertise x expert  
but they're really good so when we got here 
there's probably like one other person and now the  
place is packed out so they must be getting the 
dinner rush right now so those were some pretty  
amazing dumplings if i do say so myself so right 
now we're just walking to place at number two  
and we're gonna get something a little bit 
different obviously than dumplings because  
we just ate them um but right now it's starting 
to get a little bit dark it's starting to rain a  
little bit but people are still out eating food 
we're in sort of not the most busy street but i  
think we're heading back that way in a little bit 
so let's see what's in this one let's keep eating
we're just walking down this hidden lane but 
it's actually starting to rain right now so  
oh here we go so we've come to the lumpia it's 
newpo hang lumpia house and we're gonna try some  
of this we've seen so many people try this 
so i think it's our turn let's have a look
so it was super quick to get 
the actual olympia i think  
they have them ready to go on the like 
table and they're just wrapping them up and  
conveyor building it for when people order it must 
be super popular this was 195 pesos filipino pesos  
let's see what all the fuss is about so i believe 
olympia comes in a fried version and a non-fried  
version this is the non-fried version but i 
actually tried the fried version in my last  
video so i'll leave that on the screen and in 
the description bar below go check that one out  
but this is the non-fried so let me try 
it first without the sauce smells good
i've never tasted anything like this before 
i ever i think it's got it must have some  
kind of like it's like sugar or something it's 
really sweet so it's kind of like there's a bit  
of grittiness but it's i guess just a whole mix 
of vegetables in there you've got like the wrap  
the soft sort of wrap on the outside and then 
you've got the like medley of vegetables and  
soft but crunchy things on the inside as 
well all right let's try it with the sauce  
there's definitely a sweet element to this 
like yes it's vegetables and yes it's a wrap  
but something sweet about it i really like 
this i could eat this all the time this is  
really delicious it's really like crispy on the 
inside but also soft oh so good i've heard they  
have this option for breakfast obviously people 
buy it at all hours there's people chowing down  
behind me right now we're sharing one but like 
i might get my own after this wow so we just got  
here to twanky and the line here is crazy it's 
literally out the door around the corner and  
down the street pretty much it's raining the rain 
is pouring down it's so busy inside so i got the  
asado with the adobo egg and i'm excited i've 
never heard of that never tried it don't know  
what it is but i think it's really local i think 
it's local filipino so we're going to give it a go  
and make the lechon kawali i've most definitely 
said that wrong so tell me in the comments below  
but they're both i think pork dishes this one's 
just like more like a crispy pork and the one i  
have more is i think of a traditional filipino 
food but it comes with the egg and i'm not sure  
if it's like roasted or not i don't know tell 
me in the comments below um but i'm gonna try  
it i've never had this one before so michael got 
a calamansi juice oh i really like that it's like  
it honestly tastes like a lime i think it's made 
out of lime is it lime it tastes like a lime juice  
it smells sweet smells really sweet which is 
strange because it's pork but let's have a go  
but the pork is cold i kind of expected it to 
be warm i'm not sure if it comes like that or  
if we were just talking for too long before 
we ate it but the sauce is really sweet the  
outside of the pork is kind of crispy but 
you still have the softness of it like it  
still kind of breaks apart in your mouth i'm 
a little bit nervous to try these eggs though  
i'm not sure why they've just got like a ring of 
brown around the numbers i don't know about it but
actually read a little bit about this in 
anticipation of trying some local foods  
and um i said it was a sweet almost sugary 
tasting oh my god a sweet almost sugary  
tasting pork which is like right up my 
alley that's perfect so let's give it a go  
okay so throw up the bath it's really nice and 
i really love the sauce the pork is so nice it  
reminds me of like christmas morning at home 
with my family let's try without the sauce first
so i had like a first bite of that and it was 
like a lot colder than i expected and also there  
was like a bit of bristle in there i hate grizzle 
if my teeth touch something hard it like freaks  
me out it's like when you're in the um ocean 
and something touches your leg and you're like  
that's happened to me that's michael's dish so 
he'll try it for you hold on there's like a a  
piece of bristle inside every single one of these 
these larger pieces personally i like gristle  
if this was hot perfect but it's still pretty 
good like this anyway and obviously the sauce  
being super sweet makes it even better for me the 
rain right now is crazy everyone has umbrellas so  
everyone's in there raincoats we're trying to get 
to the next place right now there's a lot of rain  
and there's a lot of scurrying along to the next 
place so we're here at wai ying fast food it must  
be pretty popular because we have been in this 
line for quite a long time so let's see if the  
food is worth it it's been a while but a whole 
group of like eight people just came out so  
maybe this is our chance to get inside let's 
see and the line is super long behind us we were  
so lucky we got here i walked back to get jose 
because he was hiding under the out of the rain  
and we just got here in time there's probably 
like maybe 12 people behind us so pretty well
we waited for about 35 40 minutes outside in 
the rain so this must be the place to be if  
everyone else is waiting there as well now i don't 
often i must confess to eat this type of food so  
i had no idea what i was ordering but the waiter 
definitely told me the most popular which he said  
was the beef wonton mommy so we've ordered that i 
just went with what he said and he's also good we  
haven't asked some chinese tea i'm pretty sure 
which is warming my hand okay so we have a big  
big bowl of like soupy noodles it has beef it has 
wontons it smells like beef i think even water  
let's have a go let's look at these noodles let's 
bring them up let's have a taste so the vibes here  
are immaculate we're eating dinner and someone's 
on facetime with like their family probably behind  
us it's not like ultra modern at all it looks 
quite old and a little bit traditional so you're  
obviously coming here for the food we lined 
up outside everyone else lined up outside  
so this must be the place of super good food let's 
try these noodles full of noodles full of soup  
there's a little dumpling in there 
there's like veggies everywhere in there  
and of course the beef which is what the main 
thing that you want to eat something like this  
and when it lives in that soup it just 
cooks in that soup a little bit more  
that is so chewy it is so super chewy all right 
let's try the noodles not a heap of flavor with  
the noodles but texture-wise the consistency 
is really good and they broke apart super easy  
i think you like this josie normally hates 
soup we go anywhere like this she goes not  
soup but we've got it and she's trying it i do 
love noodles even if i don't like soup so let's go
oh i like the noodles i openers 
a lot they're definitely like  
flavored probably beef because it's 
beef wonton i might try a wonton
now i don't normally have wontons 
or anything like that so usually
so i have a wonton in this ladle 
it's surrounded by all the soup  
few noodle noodles in there the texture 
kind of freaks me out a little bit  
i think i've had one of them what do you think of 
it the texture is strange it's like soft and like  
rubbery well not rubbery because it's 
soft i'm a little bit nervous but
i don't like that at all sorry it's um too 
chewy i'm getting like bits of fat so even  
though this wasn't 100 for me i can tell why 
people come here it is a very nice tasting dish  
the taste is on point we're gonna finish this 
off and we're gonna wander outside and we'll  
see when we get there so while the wonton 
beef mommy wasn't my favorite i can see why  
it's really really popular but i have a 
sweet tooth so it's time for something  
sweet before we end this video let's have a look 
so here at wonky bakery let's see what they have
all right so we have a pineapple poppy oh what is 
it propio i've never seen this or heard of this  
if you have any information of what it is it 
just looks like pastry with like a filling  
um but i've never seen it before this one's 
pineapple let's go oh okay it's like crunchy and  
hard i expected it to be soft the entire way like 
i expected the pastry to be soft i expected the  
pineapple to be soft it's actually really chewy 
and hard totally different to what i expected it  
would be but it's pretty cool to snack on the 
pastry is falling everywhere though um that's  
pretty good that's nice it was like 16 pesos as 
well so pretty good price so as you can see it's  
almost night time here right now we've been here 
all day that's at the end of our full day here in  
bernando chinatown in manila in the philippines 
some of it was really good i tried a whole bunch  
of things that i'd never have before and some of 
it wasn't my favorite but that's totally okay i've  
tried new things and that's what this is all about
