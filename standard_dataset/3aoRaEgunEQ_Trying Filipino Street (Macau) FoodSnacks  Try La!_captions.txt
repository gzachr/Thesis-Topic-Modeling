hey guys and welcome to another episode of Try La! 
where Pierre and i will take you to some of our 
favorite spots or new discoveries around Macau
In today's episode we are actually going to 
explore Rua dos Cules which is located across  
Senado Square and is essentially known as the 
unofficial filipino street in Macau okay so let's  
see what kind of filipino snacks we can find
let's go!
there's a reason why this street is unofficially 
known as the filipino street in Macau 
nearly every successful Filipino-owned 
establishments are located here 
here you'll find groceries, 
restaurants, bakeries, beauty salons,  
fashion boutiques, you name it, they have it
anything that is aimed to target the local  
filipino community
you find it here
now one of the OG's that started it all and 
people will probably argue with me but it is  
this very store the Anak bakery store 
Pierre and I are here today to grab 
one of their very famous pandesal
this store right here
i remember it used to be a grocery store 
it seems that it's a different thing now 
it's apparently lutung bahay which is  
a filipino cuisine restaurant
let's see what they have here
i'm hungry so i ordered a bunch of 
different things from different shops 
so we got some ube pandesal right 
here which is from the OG Anak bakery 
we got some barbecue
some chicharron 
and some filipino siu mai,
we're gonna go eat it
oh all right so let's show 
you guys what we got here 
we didn't really buy a lot because um most of the 
stuff that we found there were like cooked meals  
or like proper food for like lunch or dinner
these are the street food snacks or snacks  
that we found so oh okay first one right here is 
the filipino version of uh siu mai or shomai in  
tagalog that smells good so the filipino way of 
eating siu mai is that we dip it in soy sauce the  
thing that has a little bit of soy sauce in there 
as well and i don't really know what kind of sauce  
is this there's like garlic yeah fried garlic in 
here okay we'll try that in a little bit and then  
i bought some barbecue this is pork barbecue and 
then she gave me suka which is vinegar so this is  
supposed to be a dipping sauce for the barbecue i 
know it smells good oh so it has some onions and  
some garlic as well pepper black pepper and yeah 
vinegar right there okay we have some ube pandesal 
this is a staple right here so a traditional 
pandesal is white it's just plain bread and it  
came from the Spanish word well pandesal a Spanish 
term it means salted bread pandesal bread of salt  
so salted bread this is a very popular type of 
bread in the Philippines and this is ube flavor  
this is usually sold out at anak bakery store but 
we got lucky today that they had a few left on  
the shelf so Pierre got some for us and the best 
part about this is that inside okay oh it's a bit
it's messy kind of messy there's cheese inside  
this is better eaten hot right now it's 
already cold but this is better eating  
hot because the cheese melts in your mouth 
and it's just so good i'm gonna have a bite
okay sorry i couldn't help myself i just had to 
bite and then we have some chicharron so a typical  
chicharron is pork skin but chicharron bulaklak 
is different because it is um pork intestines
oh it's good i think this is 
good with this dipping sauce
oh yeah that is better with the vinegar
this is the kind of food that you eat when you're 
drinking with your friends it's called pulutan 
okay let's go and try the barbecue
it's a bit chewy but tastes 
good it's not that salty
this is a typical filipino breakfast food
whenever you're in the philippines you would hear  
street vendors yelling out pandesal early in 
the morning and you know it's time to get up
ah made such a mess here already
I'm done already
alright so these are just some of the stuff 
that we found today i'm pretty sure there  
are a lot of other things that you can find in 
the filipino street so go and explore the area 
anyway i can't finish all of these 
so we're going to keep some of them  
Pierre's going to eat some of them off 
camera but for now thank you guys so
