welcome back to the manifested family now this 
is the addition where my husband and I are out  
without our children because they're home safe 
with the nanny so a really big popular video in  
Indonesia is foreigners trying local alcohol 
so we thought maybe we could do that here in  
the Philippines to be honest I'm quite nervous 
I typically don't drink hard alcohol I typically  
just have a few beers so even the taste of 
this is probably going to send me over the  
top but I'm down to do it for YouTube so let's 
see what we can get into and get really down  
with what they're tasting and drinking 
in the Philippines wish me [Music] luck  
Filipino d That's What [Music] I so of course 
they tell me that I can only pay for cash for  
this liquor that only cost a dollar that I'm 
really terrified if you even put into my lips  
but I'm going to do it for YouTube Let me see 
if Dylan has cash no thank you hello no thank
you it's only um like a doll 
look really disgusting and  
I'm terrified but they only take cash
for so yes I'm terrified oh I have your okay 
all right going back in this Mayhem this place  
is so crazy and I can't film in there because 
the music is so loud I'll get a copyright and  
it's like blasting House Christmas music all right 
I'll see you guys there let me just tell you how  
terrified I am to drink this um I'm only going to 
have a sip literally I already bought it and just  
picking up the bottle was making me shake because 
it looks that potent it's only like a dollar or $2  
of each okay and when I told the Filipino boys 
that are working there hey I want liquor they  
bought me liquor and then I told them I want the 
Filipino one I want the local they got so excited  
they literally started doing high fives running 
together all gathering around together for me um  
yeah so let's see what we're in for here we were 
going to drive back to our IR ban be do a little  
tasting and then we're going to go back to our 
babies see you guys there I'm literally scared  
to taste this H okay it's like A1 each $15 each 
you're really excited about selling it to me and  
yeah did we get Chasers I just got a mango juice 
all I could get have any ice nothing like that  
but we're going to go to our location and we'll 
look at it there all right all right guys so we  
will see you there so now we have made our way to 
vanilla Beach and I heard that this is a really  
good place for our Nanny sweet deck to come with 
the girls tomorrow so we wanted to check it out  
while we do this tasting for you guys um yeah 
I'm quite nervous but I will do it for YouTube  
so let's get to tasting so the Philippines happens 
to be very popular when it comes to fast food uh

all places to get to this beach but whatever I'm  
sure the kids will enjoy that it's very easy
