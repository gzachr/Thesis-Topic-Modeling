[Music]
okay we're here at a place that you
definitely want to check out if you're
into vow which is the Rojas night market
and we're going to take a look around
and actually we're here for some dinner
as well great place to do a little bit
of shopping and and get some food
okay so we'll we'll go ahead and take a
look around here
yeah now you'll pray see a lot of the
same things over and over but basically
they got that fish barbeque let me uh
there we go get a little bit of a better
view here
Hey
and there's everything there's desserts
there's barbecue there's that there's
snacks everything deep-fried barbecue
everything's oh and they have this stuff
here we'll have to get some it's it's
actually black charcoal ice cream and I
know it sounds bizarre but it's actually
very good hello
and it's very very tasty or is it what
do you call it
squid right yes stuff squid and then
each place pretty much has its own
seating as you can see here
yeah one of the people and I guess a lot
of the college students around the area
come here to eat as well
some deep rights
you do like a stir-fry oh here's these
ones do you like those yeah it's a squid
that's been stuffed for barbecue they
got tuna
oh yeah yeah
got fish tuna barbecue
what
it was a whole bunch gear
[Music]
glad to see also there was a place here
that had the black ice cream okay so
that kind of gives you a pretty good
idea of what they have and they have
security I don't know if you can see the
they got like an armored vehicle over
there and they do check you as you come
in you know give you the pat-down now on
the other side right over here by the
way these people in pink are doing
massage now just over there is where
they sell clothes and you know shoes and
that kind of thing which is pretty much
like a lot of the marcado's that you see
but I wanted to just share with you the
just the all the different choices here
with the barbecue but just ran into
somebody that seen me on youtube
okay so let's yeah let's go down here
now this other side like I mentioned is
not food it's like more of a Mercado
they got a little bit of everything some
of it is souvenir type stuff but you can
also get like shirts shoes I think yeah
I bought a pair of shoes here one time
but during my last visit a lot of cell
phone covers scars
small slingback pack bags
a little of everything
but hey but you pretty much get the idea
lots of
lots of stuff here
here's some of the shoes like I said
shoes you got shoes here bags
and of course plenty of sandals
No
and we're just about now there's a whole
other section that has Mercato stuff now
you can see it like right over here but
you get the general idea
and every time you exit a section then
you go through a security area just like
this one here so it's very well police
and under control so anyway so we're
gonna go do some some shopping and just
enjoy the evening so we'll see you guys
later
