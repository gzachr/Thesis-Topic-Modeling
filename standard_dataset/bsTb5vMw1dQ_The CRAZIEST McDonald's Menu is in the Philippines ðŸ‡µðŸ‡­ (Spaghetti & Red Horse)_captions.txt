never in my life did I think that I would 
find Spaghetti at a McDonald's but here  
in the Philippines you're gonna find Spaghetti 
absolutely everywhere crispy chicken a la king  
with rice over here we got these spicy chicken 
with also more rice make shaker fries they come  
in a bag they remind me of the uh the pootie 
booty fries from India now this here is the  
pepper mushroom steak and it's not really a 
steak it's just a burger what's up everybody  
welcome back to another beautiful day here in the 
Philippines now today I'm still on pangla island  
hello I'm on Panglao Island here in boho and 
I'm actually in Alana Beach and today I got one  
of those videos that you guys love to see here 
on the channel we are on our way to McDonald's  
here in the Philippines now the McDonald's here 
in the Philippines has an incredible menu with  
some items that I have never seen before so 
today I'm going to show you guys exactly what  
you can expect to find in one of the most exotic 
McDonald's in the entire world now this here is  
Alana Beach right now the movement is kind of 
slow it's noon it's extremely hot out here and  
yeah a lot of people just tend to not come 
out until the afternoon evening time once it  
starts to cool down and also a lot of people come 
here to bowl hole to go out on excursions like we  
did a few days ago when we went island hopping 
however um that causes the town to be incredibly  
slow during the day and even though this is a very 
small Beach Town you're still gonna find two big  
fast food chains McDonald's and Jollibee So today 
we're gonna explore McDonald's I've yet to try  
Jollibee I definitely need to make that happen but 
I think I'm gonna save that for a later date now  
there's tuk-tuks absolutely everywhere here 
it's quite cool to see reminds me a lot of  
uh India actually because these two ticks look a 
lot different than the ones you find in Thailand  
these are like the more Indian Sri Lankan style 
and it brings back a lot of memories from when I  
did my huge Road Trip Around Sri Lanka in a Tuk 
Tuk which I hope to do again in the near future  
but yeah this is where the tuk-tuk's line up and 
they actually all have set prices but they're  
found absolutely everywhere it's real easy to 
navigate around this area there's also coffee  
shops trendy restaurants and at night this place 
gets extremely active you also have a 7-Eleven  
over in this corner and a Dunkin Donuts I'm okay

nice clean McDonald's and we got a little bit of 
all of the Exotic items that we've never tried  
before all right you know what I think we're good 
let's go find our little seats now I actually have  
a special someone out here waiting for me she's 
been holding the table actually this McDonald's

and it's right next to the beach it's super cool  
but here we go here's the special someone 
that was holding the seat for me how are you  
craving McDonald's are you craving McDonald's 
spaghetti okay well we got a spaghetti so  
uh congratulations you're gonna be on 
your way to try and be Mech spaghetti
um
shy away from the breakfast for this McDonald's 
video so she specifically told me before all of  
the comments coming she specifically told me 
guys that she'll try to mix spaghetti with me  
but uh that's about it she's not too hungry Gladys 
is on a nice diet right now so we're gonna keep it  
that way I'm the one that needs to get on a diet 
so uh yeah I gotta make those changes however  
she's already made a Jollibee video for you guys 
if you guys want to check out what Jollibee looks  
like here in the Philippines she has that video 
covered for you but look at this location guys  
umbrellas outdoor seating indoor 
seating 7-Eleven right next door  
if I wasn't filming this video I'd go 
over there and grab myself a little red  
horse to drink with the McDonald's but you 
know what it's a little too early for that  
right now we're not gonna have any were you 
about to get up and go get a red horse yeah
all right you know what Let's do let's do a 
red horse with our meal and yeah for now I'll  
put the camera down and I'll see you guys once 
the food comes on out so 7-Eleven it is let's  
jump on inside and let's hope they got a red horse 
selection oh it's quite dark in here I've noticed  
that in all of the establishments here by the 
beach they don't turn on the lights all right
oh man they do have a nice cold red horse 
waiting for me look at this the stallion yes  
that's exactly what I needed all right we're 
gonna do one of these and a water for Gladys  
because she is outside waiting and I can imagine 
she's quite hot right now all right got the combo
hello you need a bag no bag please 
can you open that for me thank you  
it's okay to drink on the 
street right yeah okay thank you
is red horse the favorite 
Filipino beer it's good all right  
32. thank you yeah can I leave 
this here yeah thank you so much
we found the stallion this one's the first 
red horse I've seen that says stallion on it  
it's pretty cool well cheers guys to another 
incredible McDonald's video I'm super excited  
to check out um the items on this menu I 
think the one that interests me most is  
definitely the mech spaghetti and the the mech 
Rice Bowl I think that sounds pretty damn cool
yeah perfect for this hot weather I mean you 
can never go wrong with an ice cold beer in  
the blazing sun it always hits the spot so 
my two trays fully loaded have arrived to the  
table and this here is my Nick float which 
I think is chocolate milk with vanilla ice  
cream and chocolate syrup on top looks and 
smells oh it smells amazing now this here  
is the mixed spaghetti the mixed spaghetti 
looks pretty decent as well it has cheese  
um like a bolognese sauce this here is the 
mech crispy chicken a la king with rice over  
here we got these spicy chicken with also 
more rice because we're in the Philippines  
you gotta have fried rice you gotta have rice with 
everything this here is the mushroom pepper steak  
um yeah mushroom pepper steak dish not sure what 
you call this but it looks and smells amazing as  
well these here are the mcshaker fries they come 
in a bag they remind me of the uh the booty booty  
fries from India where you essentially dump 
the seasoning inside shake it up and then you  
eat and then this here is the mcdo Burger I'm 
not sure what's going on with the mcdo burger  
or what it is okay yeah it's definitely not 
like a beef patty you know what let's try this  
first why not because to be honest this looks 
like my least favorite thing that I ordered
dude I think that might be a pork meat
I don't know not a huge fan of that though it's 
definitely not beef it's definitely not chicken
what what could it be who knows some sort 
of mystery me but it's not it's not the best  
burger I had it's it's edible but um definitely 
not a huge fan of that now let's actually move  
on over to the shaker fries now because everybody 
knows McDonald's fries are the best in the world
um yeah that is super delicious wow  
can go around with McDonald's fries all right 
I'm gonna set this back here open up the barbecue  
sauce and let's not do what Gladys did last year 
in India where she forgot to close the bag all  
the way and she shook it and got the booty 
booty sauce all in her eyes and it literally  
burned so bad but that's what it looks like in 
the inside with the sauce let's close the bag up
all right wow that actually looks 
really really nice smells bomb too
yeah that's how you do it McDonald's
Shake price
what can I say not only incredibly 
fun but incredibly delicious  
it's actually keep those open all right now I need 
to give myself a courtesy wipe I'm sweating so bad  
guys it's 100 degrees Fahrenheit right now I'm 34 
degrees Celsius it is brutal in the Philippines  
but the McDonald's video has to have to have all 
right you know what now I think it's time to try  
the most exotic dish on the menu something that 
I've never seen before I've seen the Fried Chicken  
I've actually never seen this before the pepper 
steak neither but spaghetti never in my life have  
I did I think that I would find Spaghetti at a 
McDonald's but here in the Philippines you're  
gonna find Spaghetti absolutely everywhere it 
is a fan favorite for the Filipinos they love it  
and I love it too so let's try it now a good 
bowl of Nest you gotta mix up just like this  
you gotta get that cheese up in there the sauce 
on all the noodles nobody wants to eat a plain  
noodle you know what I'm saying now the only thing 
that's missing is like some meat oh it does have  
meats look it has like hot dog meat in there 
all right I'm excited about this one actually  
how are we gonna do this without making a mess 
in the beer beard and sauces don't go good
good you know what
it's very sweet it's not like a traditional 
Bolognese I'm used to it's very sweet but
um it's tasty it's you're almost this 
is like one of those things you try  
and you're not proud to admit that it's 
delicious but it is delicious it is good
yeah the hot dogs tastes like some 
extremely cheap processed something  
but man that is that's a guilty pleasure 
but it's not I like that all right you  
know what we got a lot more to try but this 
thing is melting away so let's go ahead and  
dive on into the mech floats how do you even 
do this do you mix the ice cream all the way in  
or do you just eat the top first I 
think I'm gonna mix it a little bit
what even is that oh that's not 
chocolate milk guys that is Coca-Cola  
that is not chocolate milk it just looks 
like chocolate milk that is Coca-Cola
it's like a root beer float but a Coke 
float it's good it's bomb I like it you  
know what camera woman this one you have 
to try she loves her sweets have at it
weird
is it your cup of tea no because you can I don't 
know in my mind is done Coca-Cola with ice cream  
but in Japan this is popular too 
they like to drink soda with uh  
ice cream on the top it's actually 
very it's actually very popular in  
the US as well oh really yeah 
they have syrup chocolate syrup
that's good it's good six of them six out of 
ten fair enough I'd give it a six out of ten  
too I think a better combination and you 
guys have to agree with me on this one is  
root beer float a root beer with vanilla ice 
cream that is a combination worth diet for
not really my thing but I must admit 
I'm gonna finish that it's good it's  
not my thing but it's weird right God it's like  
yeah you're not a huge fan of it but you're gonna 
keep drinking it yeah it's weird but you need to  
keep drinking exactly it's like the Pringles you 
can't stop once you open the can of Pringles yeah  
I like this girl can you see why we get along we 
have the same mindset you know what since Gladys  
just tried that even though she said that um 
she's not gonna try anything else oh but you  
did say you wanted to try the spaghetti so you 
know what let's swing the camera back over and  
try that spaghetti before it gets cold and let me 
know what you think of that let's see let's see
[Music]
because for them it's uh uh how do you 
say um like a delicacy right no no no no  
oh no it's a so wrong you think cheap 
sauce with the spaghetti oh I get it
wow it's so sweet so sweet it tastes like 
um sauce from the sheets you like on the  
Bodega you know like like cane sauce but it seems 
like they put sugar yeah that's what it tastes  
like it tastes like pure cane sugar mixed with 
like a cheap sauce almost like a ragu like yeah  
it's just nothing I don't know it's not great but 
it's not bad right it's sweet I like sweet food so  
this is probably with combination with the spicy 
fried chicken oh that might be a good combination  
you know what actually when I went back to order 
the Fried Chicken they actually sold the fried  
chicken with the pasta as a meal so yeah look I 
just removed a little spicy tab from it what is  
this like a gravy that goes with the chicken yeah 
some sort of chicken gravy you know what let's try  
a piece without the gravy first and the rice you 
guys all know what rice looks like or maybe not  
McDonald's rice but I'm not gonna dive into that 
to be honest he doesn't really grab my attention  
and we got rice and all these other Edition men 
these flies and mosquitoes are destroying me guys  
like taking everything in me to keep sitting 
here all right let's dive on into this chicken
wow
yeah it's gonna be fair
this is better than a lot of the uh
a million times better than KFC  
that is a good piece of chicken McDonald's yum 
Fried Chicken is only found in the Philippines  
they also have it in Thailand many other places 
around the world and McDonald's does good fried  
chicken everywhere in the world like they're 
pretty damn good let's try it with the gravy
um yep
that I could order again that is nice  
you know what goes better with fried chicken 
beer beer and fried chicken perfect combination
wow perfect combination all right now this is the 
one that's honestly been calling my attention the  
entire time this is the mech crispy chicken 
filet a la king pretty sure I'm saying these  
things wrong but this looks super delicious and 
in Asia I don't know why but they don't use forks  
I mean uh knives guys you always get handed a 
fork and a spoon and they're like figure it out  
all right that's what the bike looks like nice 
big bite let's get a little bit more rice in there
to be honest the sauce tastes like a 
Hollandaise sauce from an eggs Benny  
but yeah I don't know this one's not for me guys 
it's good like I feel like everything's the same  
except the fried chicken like everything's like 
good in a guilty way but like it's nothing that  
I would go in order again like it's not terrible 
which is not great neither yeah I'm done with that  
one now this here is the pepper mushroom steak 
and it's not really a steak it's just a burger  
um like a Patty a regular burger patty with 
some like mushrooms and a sauce some sort of  
gravy let's go ahead and dive on into this 
one oh this one's a lot softer okay I think  
maybe that's the problem I let that one get 
a little too cold let's go in with this one
yeah this is the one fellas mm-hmm
that that is good
very nice you know what  
camera woman the diet has to go out the 
window you got to try this one this one  
it's like a combination at McDonald's I've never 
seen or heard of before and you must try okay
oh no there's a bug inside there take that out 
okay little friend here let me see sorry you died  
this way oh that's not fair dang that thing's 
nasty looking too that definitely just flew  
in there so don't be blaming McDonald's that just 
flew in here there's all kinds of stuff flying in  
let's try the party with some sauce 
that I don't know what is it on the rice
[Music]  
this one looks good so it's like pepper yeah it's 
a pepper steak and it's like pepper garlic and  
oh my God we are flavoring McDonald's like 
I never expected flavor from McDonald's
it's good huh everything I must say everything 
is like tastes like some extremely cheap  
quality stuff I mean we're at McDonald's like 
nothing tastes really good except the chicken  
the spicy chicken tastes like a good quality 
piece of chicken and I think that has to be  
like a Filipino standard like Filipinos love 
fried chicken and it has to be a good piece of  
fried chicken or else they're never gonna compete 
with the other fast food chains in the area but my  
favorite thing on the menu that we ordered today 
are the shake fries Guys these are Next Level good  
but I'm the type of person that goes to McDonald's 
and just order fries and nothing else and  
one thing they have at the McDonald's menu 
here that I didn't order our BFF fries which  
are two large fries connected to each other 
super cool to share with your best friend
no this is this is one of the craziest McDonald's 
menus I've ever seen so you know what guys  
I think this is how we're gonna wrap up today's 
video let me know what you guys thought of the  
menu let me know what you would like to try or 
what you would just steer away from now I know  
there's a lot of you guys that are fans of 
McDonald's because it's that you know it's  
that sense of food that you can eat anywhere in 
the world and it all has similar tastes well as  
far as the burgers are concerned so it's a it's 
a homemade feel and let me just tell you guys  
a lot of you people say oh only American team 
McDonald's that is BS everywhere I go in the world  
McDonald's is full and it's always full of local 
people everyone around the world loves McDonald's  
and if you don't love McDonald's you're just a 
hater you don't want to admit that you like a nice  
big mac because Big Mac and Fries are good I'll 
granted they might not be good for you but it's  
good it's delicious all right it's not a it's not 
a high quality Burger but it's that jugged burger  
that you crave every once in a while so put this 
red horse guys and all of this food in front of me  
oh man we got some work to do I'm gonna have to 
let you guys go until the next one later guys
[Music]
