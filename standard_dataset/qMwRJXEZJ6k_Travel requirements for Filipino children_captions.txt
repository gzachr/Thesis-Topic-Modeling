Travel requirements for Filipino children
There is confusion out there about what is
needed for a Filipino child visa holder to
travel from
Philippines to Australia, and many get into
quite a worried state about this.
Many also don't quite get
how the rules work and how the laws work in
the Philippines.
So it's time that Down Under Visa cleared
a few things up.
We'll also explain briefly about the Philippines
child protection laws under Republic Act
No. 7610, and what you should know.
Children.
Do they need a DSWD travel clearance?
DSWD stands for Department of Social Welfare
and Development.
This is like "Family Services" in
Australia.
They make sure, in this case, that kids are
not being trafficked off overseas or in the
wrong
hands.
So when is a DSWD travel clearance required?
* When there is a Child under 18 traveling
alone to a foreign country
* When there is a child under 18 traveling
to a foreign country accompanied by someone
other
than his or her parents
What it means is that unless there is a court
order to the contrary, a child can travel
overseas with their
mum and/or dad without a travel clearance
being needed.
Travel clearances and fathers
But be aware that an Australian sponsor can't
go and pick up the child of his girlfriend
or fiance and
bring them back to Australia.
And as you will read below, there are laws
here about adults being in the
company of kids they are not related to, and
you don't want to put yourself under a cloud
of suspicion.
And the same issue applies to your own biological
children who are born out of wedlock!
If you have
children from a de facto relationship in the
Philippines, then those children are not in
your legal
custody (explained below), you would need
to get a DSWD Travel Clearance for them.
My advice?
Travel with the mum.
Save yourself the headaches.
Australian visa applications and traveling
children
For a child to be included in an Australia
visa application, they must meet Public Interest
Criteria 4015.
That means:
* The law of the child's HOME COUNTRY (ie.
Philippines) allows them to leave the country
under
the circumstances of the visa.
* If anyone other than the mum has legal custodial
rights over the child, then they give their
consent.
Children born out of wedlock in Philippines
are the sole custody of their mother.
If the 
parents weren't
married, then the father has no say in whether
they leave the country or not.
And this is irrespective of
whether he puts his name on the birth certificate
(ie.
acknowledges paternity) or not, or whether
he
lived in a de facto relationship and did all
the right things.
He can complain all he likes, but it will
achieve
nothing.
It also means that if the parents of the child
are still married, even if he was the worst
father in the
world and hasn't seen them or supported them
for the last 11 years, we still need his permission
before
the children can leave the country.
Unless the court gave full custody to the
mother, we will need to
gain his permission or they will remain in
Philippines.
Child Protection Laws in Philippines
The Philippines for a long time was one of
those countries where the pedophiles would
head knowing
that they could safely abuse kids and get
away with it.
Things have changed, and there are strict
laws in
place to keep kids out of harms way.
And anyone visiting the Philippines needs
to be aware of these
laws or you could inadvertently get caught
up in them by well-intentioned but possibly
overzealous law
enforcement.
Thus my advice to not even try to travel with
kids without their mum.
Basically, you can't be in the company of
a child whom you have no right or reason to
be around.
Inviting neighbor kids or street kids to watch
TV with you, or to accompany you somewhere,
you could
find yourself arrested.
Pedophiles have always come up with excuses
and justification as to why the
child was behind closed doors with them.
Letting them play computer games.
Giving them a feed.
Giving
them clothes or shoes.
Taking them out on a boat for a treat.
Giving them a bed for the night.
Thus some
fairly strict laws, thank goodness!
Be aware of these laws and try to appreciate
the reasons for them
existing, and be careful not to accidentally
do the wrong thing whether well-intentioned
or not.
