      "okay so some of you have asked for a house tour of uh our house here in the philippines try to get some a little bit better light there we go um yeah so i'm gonna just give you a quick tour nothing too in-depth but uh here we go okay try to reduce it down here okay there's the the top up on top we have the this whole middle section is just a stair column you'll see that then we've got a full upstairs patio area then the second floor second floor is where we live and we've got a little balcony there and then the bottom floor is where my brother-in-law's and their families live so we'll get started all right down there's a couple of little houses so all right let's get started little gate got our initials on it there's the door to one brother-in-law's apartment or and the other one so they'll open the door and go up the steps you got these little lights that come on those are nice at night and then we thought it'd be nice to put in this glass block kind of so it's not so dark just like a concrete wall when you come up the steps you also got this see i'm just opposite the steps here you get glass block all along here and then you turn and you walk this way and you can look out we got screens on all the windows and there's the upstairs so we'll go up there in a minute i'm going to show you our living quarters where we live this is our living room tv area we've got an air conditioner in case it gets too hot in here in the evening sometimes we'll turn it on not too often and then we've got screens on all the doors in our little balcony we can look out both ways we can look down if we see something going on my wife's beloved wind chimes trying to shut the glass door okay and we've got a little dinette we bought here this last animal glass glass dinette and we've got a cat otherwise known as ming ming in our kitchen um we actually have granite countertops and uh cabinetry everywhere it is unfinished at this point we are going to finish it hopefully before we leave we got a really nice stove i'm not sure where she got that where do you know where she got it sm maybe i don't remember the brand seems like it's some sort of japanese fuji denzo okay bought me a coffee pot the other day because i couldn't deal with the the nescafe brands anymore or copycar or any of those brands so you can kind of see what the uh the glass block looks like from the inside in our living quarters on the second floor so come around through here we've actually got two doors that open up to the stairs so it's kind of an open air we wanted to keep it keep it all open and we've got a good utility closet again we're kind of in the process of doing some fish finishing so we've got plenty of storage area here and then in here we call this we call this nani's room and well can't really see there we go it's a picture of my mother-in-law she's actually passed away about three or four years ago and this was to be her room she never got to see it so house was kind of built in memory of her dedicated to her you can see this area here let me show you some like this door see how pretty that is that's what all this dry wood is going to look like that's our plan is to get all this throughout the house finished like this we picked up a varnish stain combination at ace hardware it's called it just says like i think it's it's the lightest color chestnut or something like that with a matte finish i don't like the slick finishes i like the matte finish and yeah so we've got tons of storage here a little desk built in shelves i hope no dead bodies or anything fall out here i don't know what's in here yeah we've got tons of storage more storage than we want or need and these couple little uh built-in side tables those are nice somebody really did a great job all of this stuff is is handmade the guy came over to the house we told him what we wanted and he built it so that's all handmade this bed is uh made out of steel steel tubing welded cut welded put together by hand it's got a nice mattress in there i personally picked out all the tile which i like it i'm glad i got it then we have the small bathroom it's a typical filipino bathroom but we do have heated water if we need it draining the floor tile all the way up the walls small sink and toilet and we don't have a cabinet put in yet but we do have the wiring put in so all right and this is just an area kind of designated it for my office at some point just to pay bills to work on editing videos things like that cat he's getting around all right so walk into our bedroom and this is our master bath i i really liked that i couldn't that's one thing i couldn't wait to see was our master bath because they did a fine job on it they did an excellent job the toilet is a upgraded just a nice design the cabinets are really designed nice we even have the little switch there that turns on above there like a makeup light of some sort got a really good looking guy there he's doing all the videos for us and then the shower you know it's it's it's pretty standard got the water heater place to put everything i like things neat and orderly and then again this this door this is what all of our our woods are gonna look like in here and i just think that's beautiful really just a minimalist finish on it not too shiny and then we have these handmade little end tables side tables bedside tables and we're going to finish those out i think i'm going to start on that today again this uh this bed is all steel steel frame handmade designed hand cut now see the steel steel legs and it's no box springs but tell you what these mattresses that we've got we're from you guys probably know mf uh some kind of foam company makes these mattresses i'm telling you what for a couple hundred dollars they are some of the best mattresses i've ever slept on in my life so i'll turn off the light there i have lights everywhere all right so we've been to the kitchen already there's some of my wife's photography stuff that she's done she's really good at decorating it's one of her paintings actually she does what's called acrylic pour all right let's go upstairs really hot today got a fire extinguisher that's a must sorry i'm trying to put my glasses back on here all right so we've got lighting all the way up through here and these these stairs are all handmade hand cut and just designed by the metal worker that did it these windows were all put together piece by piece the guy did all of our windows all the same ones so we've got a screen we've got nice tinted glass throughout the whole thing a storm door here for rain and then up here it's going to get a little warm if you're out in the sun the filipino sun is it's very unforgiving but you get about out here at night i think i'll try to do a video to o'clock until dark it's really beautiful out here the sun sets way back there in the east goes down behind those trees it's just kind of breezy up here you stand out here on the edge and it's just like standing on the titanic or something it's just the wind blows maybe a little upstairs uh cr up here so typical filipino bathroom all right and then in back we've got a built-in sink which we need to get our tile put in but you know it's it's functional um i had them build me a grill last time i was here i didn't have a grill so we got a again a filipino-style grill you'll see these like built like this on the street they'll sell east out esau which is like intestines on a stick who doesn't love intestines on a stick come on and then if we ever wanted to collect water rain water we've got it set up to where we can just put a tank here or something like that and collect water we've got a lot of plants back here my wife's growing several different types of of uh food plants vegetable plants and then she's got alekbati growing there alekbati over there syrup with uh mungo of course shimpuri and then all of our little starters so yeah and then somebody asked about the baha'i kubo there it is that was built up here it's it's funny how much does it cost to get a baha'i kubo built you might ask and uh not much because when we built the house we saved all the bamboo scaffolding and we paid a guy labor took him a few days probably five six hundred pesos a day and he built this for us first we paid him we got steps right here got a nice floor benches on the side we hang close sometimes outside so we've got that and we've got some hangers here but most of the time you can sit in here if there's any breeze at all you just sit down and just kind of relax and catch any breeze that's out there so yeah got to buy behind kubo we got a grill we got the upstairs patio which in the evenings we spend a lot of time up here until the mosquitoes say it's time for us to go in then we go in i've really been fortunate on mosquito bites this time i bet i haven't been been bitten six or seven times maybe and then our our water tower we've got a pump downstairs good water pump and pressure tank so we pump the water up here to the top i thought i'd throw in a little bit of grilling action actual uh footage of the fiesta just a little bit see how the upstairs operates and kind of how it works what it's like up here when we're grilling hello um so that's it that's a tour of our house um again i didn't really want to go into the the uh two brothers houses downstairs they're nice neat and ordinary they're i mean orderly ordinary they're orderly uh they keep a really nice house it's not furnished like ours is uh as far as the the tile and the decorations and stuff they do their own thing and that's fine but uh yeah i enjoy enjoy being here why wouldn't i this is a dream this is was a dream you know the channel is called the philippines project and i almost have to close my eyes out here the channel is called the philippines project and this was definitely one of the projects so we get out of the sun so yeah this was built over about a year a year and a half probably at the most and then that's that's the the this top floor uh you know was put on ever all the concrete was done the plumbing electric everything was done we came back in we put down all this all this tile well we did we had somebody do it but we were here during all the tile installation pretty much all of it and you know so we went back uh in we hadn't been we didn't come back to march of march th we got in manila and so we've been here ever since and i'm going to go back to the united states at some point probably in june but i'm not trying to get in any hurry i'll tell you i'm enjoying my time here enjoying the philippines and right now we got some work going on downstairs in our on our floor we've got a a little bit of a water leak we got to chase down and it's different than america uh you got a water leak in america it starts tearing up a lot of stuff well here you gotta tear out concrete you know so that's kind of what we're dealing with but it's a slow leak we don't have to shut off our water or anything like that but both of my brothers-in-law they work construction full-time so you know it's pretty handy to have them around we pay them a little bit and they come up and they do whatever we need and you know we work together as a family you know so anyway that's my house tour if you have any questions

      "hello everybody my name is katrinka i'm a professional singer and a vocal coach and welcome back to my channel today i'm gonna be reacting to another of your really heavily expected recommendations and it's gonna be regina velazquez now i hope that i'm pronouncing her name correctly because she's been very heavily requested from what i've understood she is one amazing vocalist and she is up there with like a thripple of katrina velard and maury said and other fantastic singers today we're gonna be reacting to our gabi live on wish if you would like to see the whole performance don't forget to check the description of the video and there's gonna be the link to the original video and yes don't forget to subscribe our new upload schedule is up on the youtube banner and i'm also coming back to my streams i'll be streaming on wednesdays and on sundays check the streaming schedule in the description of my video there's also gonna be what we're gonna be doing on the streams so you can look forward to them and now without any further ado miss regine velasquez let's get into this i swear to god if she's gonna be just like another one on the same level i'll be jealous and she's also pretty shocked oh i love when they sing in their original language it has completely different atmosphere the melody is very addictive like i feel like already it's very well memorable oh beautiful the melody is very dominant and it's very memorable but it's still the way she sings it i feel like she's reciting even though there's a lot of melody in it but the way she delivers it's a very high-based song even though it doesn't look like that on the first side but she push and pull and she's just going it's incredible she doesn't even do big breath pauses just to keep the fluency of the storytelling that she's making in the song and what is really wonderful is that she's so fluent that you cannot even hear her switches from her chest voice to her mix it's just one beautiful stream it's incredible i love it very intricate you can tell beautiful ending of the princess um the very high high tone i think okay so what i'm absolutely swept away with is how fluent she is there is no visible switches between her registration whatsoever like you cannot hear them they are there because she is going fluently from one to another but as she's doing it's just so it's invisible it's completely invisible you feel like she's not switching at all but she is switching but just completely fluently at the very beginning she was just switching between her chest voice and her mix but now it's also up to falzetto like a very high falsetto that was a little visible but that was also a huge jump and she finished it with a beautiful full head voice it's very obvious that her voice is very mature it's finished it's done it's perfection it's really really beautiful kind of a voice and i'm really enjoying her whole technique is just so intriguing and delicate it's incredible you can also tell there's no nervousness in her whatsoever she's completely cool collected foreign oh beautiful run wonderful run look at her she's just such a jolly person very pretty one memorize the tune she's very relaxed like you can tell she's not just mentally very relaxed she is in a very calm collected place she's not stressed she's not tense whatsoever she's even like switching her sitting positions which is very typical for a wish but someone in the last video that i reacted on which someone told me that they have to sit because a lot of times they're actually in a moving bus which is then absolutely understandable why they sit but for belting it's really way more difficult than uh standing up her belts are effortless she has everything extremely relaxed and uh yeah i feel like we're getting to finally so let's see did you see the big a little rasp in her belt there was a little respite end of the phrase too so i think she did it on purpose her voice has so many different colors it's incredible her voice is like rainbow and she was just literally painting with tons and tons and tons of colors i know that i'm using where it's incredible and amazing a lot but especially with these singers that's how i genuinely feel inside and fuzzy and happy because i got to hear that that was pretty fast based song and singing this clean with this invisible fluent switches just takes a lot of control so she had an amazing voice control her voice had a wonderful color in all of her registers and her chest voice and her mix but also her head voice of falsetto was really major pretty heavy so it matched with the rest of them very beautifully but i would definitely call her like queen of switches because you cannot see them you cannot hear them you wouldn't find them if you try everything was very well done very intricate very detailed her voice is definitely a very major it's very finished done polished and also at a very last bill she had a little bit of a rasp and she then added it at the very end of the song where she closed her throat a little bit to create an effect i'm just gonna show oh my god this is such a beautiful human she's just a such a good vocalist that it was so obvious that she could invest all of her attention into the emotional side of the song into into transmitting the emotions into the music and completely sweeping you off your feet as the audience so wonderful thank you so much for recommending um regina i am absolutely honestly lord i thought this is gonna be very good but i didn't think it's gonna be this good so if you enjoyed the video don't forget to subscribe and tip the notification bell because every single time i upload a new video i respond and like first of the comments but first and foremost stay safe and healthy and i'm gonna see you next time bye you\n",

      "Hello there, and welcome to Foodie Legends, your go to source to the best foods around the world and their history. In our last episode, we visited the colorful country of the Philippines to have a taste of their iconic fiesta cuisine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 2:\n",
      "Now, let’s go to the other side of the spectrum and have a taste of the Philippines’ more challenging delicacies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 3:\n",
      "But before we dive in, don’t forget to hit the Subscribe and Notification Bell, so you guys can catch up to our latest food journeys.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 4:\n",
      "Without anything further to do, let’s go!\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 5:\n",
      "Coming in number one on our list is the ultimate gateway to the long list of Filipino exotic foods: none other than the balut.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 6:\n",
      "Everytime a Filipino will “baptize” their foreigner friends, it wouldn’t be complete without a piece of balut paired with beer waiting on the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 7:\n",
      "But what is balut anyway?\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 8:\n",
      "Basically, balut is a fertilized duck egg.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 9:\n",
      "It is incubated between to days, then steamed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 10:\n",
      "The challenge in eating balut is by eating the semi-developed duck fetus hiding under the shell, drenched in its own soup. The type of egg usually used in making balut is the egg of a mallard duck, commonly known in the Philippines as the “Pateros duck”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 11:\n",
      "Balut is best eaten by cracking a portion of its upper shell, just right at the top.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 12:\n",
      "The thin membrane must be removed to expose the soup and the actual egg, then sprinkle just a tiny dash of salt and pour a small amount of sinamak- a type of coconut vinegar spiced with bird’s eye chili, garlic and ginger. Have a taste of the “soup” first, which has a slightly salty but surprisingly deep and refreshing flavor, enhanced by the salt and spiced vinegar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 13:\n",
      "Once you finish consuming the soup, you can now break the egg to expose the solidified egg yolk and the harder egg white.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 14:\n",
      "The egg yolk has a creamy taste while the whites have a tough and slightly crunchy texture.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 15:\n",
      "These are the good parts of the balut, but if you want to take your curiosity once notch higher, then you can eat the balut’s centerpiece: its underdeveloped duck. If you get lucky, you may get the duck that is nearly fully formed, which some may find quite off-putting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 16:\n",
      "It has a very crunchy texture, although it can be somewhat an acquired taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 17:\n",
      "It is also believed that balut is an aphrodisiac, and a Filipino joke was made because of this belief: “Pinatigas ng balut ang tuhod ko” Coming in number two on our list is another dish that people believe can make you hard and strong for the entire evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 18:\n",
      "It’s the mysterious Soup No. .\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 19:\n",
      "You don’t know what Soup No.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 20:\n",
      "is?\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 21:\n",
      "Well, have you heard of Rocky Mountain Oysters?\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 22:\n",
      "If you know what Rocky Mountain Oyster is, then you have a good idea of the main ingredient used in Soup No.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 23:\n",
      ".\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 24:\n",
      "Well, let’s not keep the suspense longer.\n",

      "Segment 25:\n",
      "Soup No.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 26:\n",
      "is a famous exotic hangover dish in the Philippines, and its main ingredient is none other than the bull’s penis and testicles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 27:\n",
      "Yep, you heard that right.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 28:\n",
      "Soup No.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 29:\n",
      "is the bull’s genitalia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 30:\n",
      "But why was it called Soup No.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 31:\n",
      ", and not any other number?\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 32:\n",
      "According to urban legends, this infamous soup got its iconic name because the owner of the restaurant which first served the dish had four more anonymous dishes in his menu, using only numbers to label these dishes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 33:\n",
      "What are these dishes, no one knows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 34:\n",
      "This gimmick was the owner’s way to discreetly label his dishes, and to entice the eaters on its mysteries. Coming in number three on our list is the Philippine’s exotic answer to the Western ham and cured meat: the etag.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 35:\n",
      "The craft of dry-curing meat is one of the most fundamental ways of preparing meat, as old as civilization itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 36:\n",
      "Different countries have their takes on curing meat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 37:\n",
      "As early as BC, records state that Mesopotamians cured their meat with sesame oil and salt; the Ancient Romans dry-cured their meat with salt to preserve it during long travels, where the soldiers of the Roman Republic and Empire can eat it as part of their rations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 38:\n",
      "In the mountainous regions of the Cordillera where the history of precolonial Philippines is still visibly felt, etag is a doorway to the past of the said region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 39:\n",
      "Etag is a term used in Cordillera referring to its native way of preserving pork.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 40:\n",
      "In this process of making etag known as “Panag-etag”, the fresh parts of the slaughtered pig is generously rubbed with huge amounts of salt, then the slabs of meat will be hanged and dried under the sun for several weeks or months. The meat can also be smoked using the wood of a tree that Igorots call “alnos”, although guava trees can be used as an alternative.According to the locals, the longer the etag is cured and air-dried, the tastier and more expensive it would be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 41:\n",
      "Over time, the meat’s color will be darker and darker because of the long process of dry aging.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 42:\n",
      "What makes etag a part of our Philippine exotic food picks is because of the preparation itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 43:\n",
      "Since etag is hung in the open air, the dried meat has maggots crawling in its flesh because it was exposed to the elements and the flies. Because of this, etag also has a foul odor that can challenge the bravest eaters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 44:\n",
      "Its surface is also covered with a layer of white molds, just like the molds in classic cheeses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 45:\n",
      "Don’t worry though, because before you eat the etag, the molds will be sliced away first, and washed with water to remove the maggots and lessen the saltiness of the meat. Once you get used to the thought of its origins, etag is actually not that bad, tasting like smoked bacon or ham. Coming in number four on our list is the Kamaru, a delicacy that may seem exotic even for local eaters, but once you get a taste of this bad boy, you will find it irresistible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 46:\n",
      "Kamaru is otherwise known as “mole crickets” , a type of insect that can usually be found on rice paddies in the Philippines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 47:\n",
      "Initially, farmers found mole crickets to be nothing more than headaches, because they are considered pests who eat the roots of the rice plants, causing their crops to grow poorly or the seedlings to die.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 48:\n",
      "Kamaru are usually found swimming in the water, or burrowing holes in the farm lands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 49:\n",
      "Pampanga earns the de facto title as the “Culinary Capital of the Philippines” because it produced a lot of great cooks, and this province has a lot of dishes to brag about in their gastronomic repertoire. Do you think Pampanga chefs looked at the kamaru and thought “No, I can’t cook this one.” As it turned out, this pesky insect turned out to be something of a culinary delight, and so they became one of the most underrated delicacies in Pampanga.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 50:\n",
      "Kamaru is a very cheap substitute for meat, and you can buy a kilo for only fifty pesos.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 51:\n",
      "That’s a lot of meaty insects for a dollar!\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 52:\n",
      "Kamaru is popularly cooked as an adobo: the classic Filipino way of cooking, well basically most meat and vegetables available in the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 53:\n",
      "These crickets are washed properly to remove the soil from their bodies, then set aside.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 54:\n",
      "On a hot pan, garlic and onion are sauteed until their fragrance comes out, and then the kamaru is added, flavored with soy sauce, vinegar, pepper and bay leaf. Oftentimes, kamaru is simply stir-fried with garlic, onions, vinegar, and chopped tomatoes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 55:\n",
      "The crickets are then mixed and tossed until they are crispy, but the insides are still soft and moist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 56:\n",
      "This crunchy delight is best served as a pulutan dish, dipped in soy sauce-vinegar mixture spiced by garlic, onions, and chilis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 57:\n",
      "It’s the strangest and yummiest finger food you’ll ever have!\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 58:\n",
      "Coming in number five on our list is tamilok, an exotic Filipino dish that is already making waves among the connoisseurs and the rookie foodies alike.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 59:\n",
      "Tamilok, known with its scientific name, Kuphus polythalamius is a type of shipworm, also known by its common name, woodworm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 60:\n",
      "Although it has the name “worm” attached to its name, woodworm is not an actual worm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 61:\n",
      "Tamilok is actually a member of the mollusk family, and to describe it as a shell-less saltwater clam is more accurate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 62:\n",
      "Tamilok are usually found in decaying and rotting logs, or thick tree trunks submerged underwater.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 63:\n",
      "This is why tamilok earned the name “woodworm”, despite its actual nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 64:\n",
      "The best way to eat tamilok is by turning it into a Filipino-style ceviche known as “kinilaw”. The tamilok is cleaned then is cured in coconut vinegar, calamansi, salt, and chili, and there goes your tamilok kinilaw.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 65:\n",
      "Because it is basically a mollusk, tamilok has a fishy flavor profile, with a hint of saltiness, quite slimy, and just resembles raw oyster.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 66:\n",
      "Tamilok has become a popular exotic delicacy in the Philippines, but the recent surge in demand threatens the existence of mangroves where tamiloks live, so there are environmental movements advocating the limitation of tamilok consumption.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 67:\n",
      "So if you want to eat tamilok, best to take what is only enough for yourself, not too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 68:\n",
      "Conserving the environment is still the top priority, of course.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 69:\n",

      "On this episode of China Uncensored, the Chinese regime promised the Philippines that they’d totally give them billions of dollars.\n",

      "How’d that turn out?\n",

      "Rodrigo Duterte.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 6:\n",
      "President of the Philippines, and Vladimir Putin wannabe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 7:\n",
      "When he ran for office, he was so outspoken against China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea, that he pledged to stop them with a move even Putin would have admired: He promised to ride a jetski to disputed islands and plant the Philippines’ flag. Of course it would have really impressed Putin if Duterte had pledged to ride the jetski while shirtless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 8:\n",
      "And on a horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 9:\n",
      "But after taking office in mid-, Duterte did a full , but not on a jetski.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 10:\n",
      "In fact, he put that jetski back in the shed to gather dust.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 11:\n",
      "In Duterte’s first official meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, he didn’t even bring up the territorial disputes— even though an international court had just ruled in the Philippines’ favor. Duterte even turned his back on long-time ally the United States as he jumped into Xi Jinping’s loving arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 12:\n",
      "“‘I announce my separation from the United States,’ those are the words of Rodrigo Duterte in Beijing on Thursday, capping off a trip to China where he’s won a whopping billion dollars in business deals.” Duterte saw Chinese investment as key to his “Build, Build, Build” strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 13:\n",
      "He wants to usher in a golden age of infrastructure development through a six-year, billion dollar spending spree.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 14:\n",
      "And when the dust settled from Duterte’s charm offensive in Beijing, China pledged to provide the Philippines with billion dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 15:\n",
      "That would include billion in foreign direct investment, plus billion dollars in aid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 16:\n",
      "That aid alone would be times more than what the Philippines got from the United States in .\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 17:\n",
      "So, sure the US has been an ally of the Philippines for decades, but, I mean...billions of dollars? For billions of dollars, who wouldn’t cuddle up with China?\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 18:\n",
      "But you know what?\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 19:\n",
      "Sometimes, China can be so forgetful!\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 20:\n",
      "See, when the South China Morning Post did a spot check on China’s investment commitments earlier this month, they asked, “What happened to the billions China pledged the Philippines?” And it turns out the answer is…not a whole lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 21:\n",
      "Of its billion dollar pledge, China so far has made good on only one billion worth of Foreign Direct Investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 22:\n",
      "Add to that just a single finalized loan agreement of $ million dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 23:\n",
      "And China gave the Philippines million dollars in direct aid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 24:\n",
      "That was in the form of grants to build two bridges in the capital of Manila.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 25:\n",
      "Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Zhao Jianhua was at the groundbreaking ceremony last month, holding a golden shovel alongside other men, also dressed inappropriately for construction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 26:\n",
      "Ambassador Zhao said that “the bridge projects will further add strength to the ‘Build, Build, Build’ initiative of the Philippines.” And he tried to assure everybody that “China’s loans to finance infrastructure projects will not make the Philippines fall into a debt trap.” And you know what?\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 27:\n",
      "I believe him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 28:\n",
      "At least for now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 29:\n",
      "Because for the Philippines to fall into a debt trap, China would actually have to lend them lots of money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 30:\n",
      "And so far, that tap’s been pretty dry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 31:\n",
      "They’ve only received less than % of what China promised.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 32:\n",
      "It’s like they ordered a hamburger, and the waiter brought them a shriveled piece of lettuce.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 33:\n",
      "Now to be fair, the holdups on the money weren’t all from the Chinese Communist Party.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 34:\n",
      "As the South China Morning Post points out, some projects were delayed by the Philippines or cancelled.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 35:\n",
      "And more may be coming soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 36:\n",
      "Now on the one hand, the slowdown in investment is actually good news for the Philippines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 37:\n",
      "It means they haven’t fallen into the Chinese Communist Party’s debt trap.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 38:\n",
      "Like Sri Lanka, or Pakistan, or Djibouti, or Laos, or Cambodia, or... well, the list goes on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 39:\n",
      "But on the other hand, in order to get the promise of Chinese aid and investment— even though it’s unfulfilled so far— Duterte has already made a lot of concessions that have angered Filipinos.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 40:\n",
      "At a February meeting of the Chinese Business Club, Duterte complained that China was pinching its pennies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 41:\n",
      "So to get China to loosen its purse strings, he joked that China should just annex the Philippines and turn the country into a Chinese province.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 42:\n",
      "“Why are you so sparing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 43:\n",
      "If you want, just make us a province, like Fujian: Province of Philippines, Republic of China.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 44:\n",
      "Problem solved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 45:\n",
      "Everything will be for free.” Everything will be free?\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 46:\n",
      "Maybe someone should tell Duterte that’s not how communism actually works. Now while Duterte’s joke seemed to make the Chinese ambassador smile, it didn’t go over so well with the citizens of the Philippines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 47:\n",
      "A few months later, banners calling the Philippines a “province of China” started popping up on bridges in Manila.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 48:\n",
      "And I’ve got to give them props.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 49:\n",
      "No, I mean, Filipinos are using lots of props to express their anger at Duterte.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 50:\n",
      "The Philippines, province of China banners are slightly more subtle than the guy with the “China Out” hat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 51:\n",
      "Or this effigy of the president’s head tied to a makeshift train.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 52:\n",
      "Which was then set on fire.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 53:\n",
      "That happened on the day of Duterte’s state of the nation address in July, when thousands took to the streets, and not exactly to show their support.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 54:\n",
      "Meanwhile, Duterte blamed bloodsucking bureaucrats for the lack of money for his infrastructure dream. “Corruption is like a leech that bleeds the government of funds, programs and infrastructure and social development projects.” To be fair, people are angry at Duterte for a lot of things. But among those things, he’s blamed for making one-sided concessions to China on sovereignty, with nothing to show for it in return. And it’s not just Duterte’s refusal to plant his flag in the South China Sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 55:\n",
      "Which—let’s be honest—even I’ve done that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 56:\n",
      "Duterte also proposed a highly controversial sharing deal with China on a planned joint exploration of resources in a part of the South China Sea that the Philippines claims.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 57:\n",
      "Under the arrangement, the Philippines would get % and China %.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 58:\n",
      "But critics say this is a bad deal because it solidifies China’s claim there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 59:\n",
      "But don’t worry!\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 60:\n",
      "Duterte isn’t giving up on enforcing the Philippine’s claim to the South China Sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 61:\n",
      "He’s fully committed to imposing it... in the year .\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 62:\n",
      "When he’ll ride to the Scarborough Shoal and plant the Philippines flag... on a space jetski.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 63:\n",
      "While shirtless.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 64:\n",
      "And on a horse. A space horse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 65:\n",
      "And before you go, it’s time for me to answer another question from a fan who supports China Uncensored on the crowdfunding website Patreon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 66:\n",
      "David Michael White asks, “Among your many overseas adventures, which hotel did you like the most?” Why, it was the Jia Jia Hotel in Taiwan!\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 67:\n",
      "They were super friendly and had interesting rooms, and they were in good locations in Taipei and Tainan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 68:\n",
      "Also, I can’t say no to free breakfast!\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 69:\n",
      "Now on one hand, I am saying that because the Jia Jia hotel was a sponsor of China Uncensored— and I have a lot of love and respect for the companies that support us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 70:\n",
      "But on the other hand, I don’t have much to compare it to. The truth is, I don’t usually stay in hotels while traveling.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 71:\n",
      "China Uncensored doesn’t exactly have a big travel budget.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 72:\n",
      "For most of our trips, the crew and I save money by staying in people’s homes, or in AirBNBs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 73:\n",
      "But for all the hotel owners out there watching this episode, if you have a five-star hotel and want to sponsor our crew next time we travel, I’m very open to updating my answer to this question.

      "we're the lockwoods and we've been traveling the world to experience up close and in person all the natural wonders and distinct cultures that our kids would otherwise see only in textbooks and TV since we've been spending so much time in the Philippines and since we've been using Manila as a hub for a lot of our Asian travels and since our good friends from the mom duty Channel have moved back here and encouraged us to be their neighbors we've decided to set up a second home base here in BGC since we'll be alternating mods between here in the U.S we need to hunt for an apartment that's not too big not too pricey and not too far from our besties so let's get started imitation is the greatest form of flattery and we are copying our very best friends the ocampos at momduty because they just found their condo here in BGC after looking for a while so we're gonna meet up with them and we're gonna get all the advice we can get and we're not meeting them just anywhere we're gonna go right back to the very first place we ever met them earlier this year the Mine Museum we're recreating our first date a little bit and it's just a few blocks from where both of us are staying right now my name is Melvin and with a Nancy how are you I have like my bandana for him so he I can wipe him all day all started guys right here it all started right here but here we are on a brand new day and we're gonna meet up with momduty another YouTuber family from California and they've been living here for a couple of months we're gonna experience the Mine Museum right here Rocio Melvin and their two kids Mia and Knox and they're the same age as Colt and Brooklyn so they're getting to know each other I feel like they're growing up together all right guys we gotta pick your brains about condo shopping here because we gotta find our place now that you have found your place but who wants to do it over maybe some mimosas at brunch mimosas for brunch I don't know let's go so freaking excited to hang out with the ABC fam this whole week we're gonna take them to Dr wine it is a little spot that's actually right under where we're staying right now and we've heard really good things about it this actually isn't our first time here because the very first time we were in BGC the Ocampos took us to Dr wine repeat history repeats itself yet again ah I forgot about that I didn't know he'd been here but our own little section over here private party uh I think I'm just gonna get the same thing the ocampo's got just copy everything so flattered it's a BGC but friendly I like Philippines because it's safe and there's lots of the people who respect people so they respect the area and look how clean it is the BDC check the rules not there's not a lot of traps there so that's a couple things I like about BC there's no trash it's old that's it sold we're moving now thanks Moxie that was a great point that Knox talked about because that's also something that we value Safety First just feels so good here I it's very family friendly yeah the walkability score here is like through the roof yeah the pedestrians uh are priority number one here so you get that feel of safety and you also have that convenience so when you're going I love the fact that you can just go down and walk out out of your building and you're in and literally steps away from all these restaurants like Dr wine I mean there's about plus restaurants around us combine that with the Warmness of the Filipino people and I'm not trying to be biased here because I'm Filipino but they are very warm and welcoming that's what I love about that so you combine that with this it's amazing the warmth that you get here the community that we've been craving for so long is so welcoming we really don't feel complete here without the lockwoods it's a lockwoods must move here please don't move be our neighbors I think we would probably come here every day if we lived in BGC this would be like our meeting our brainstorm meeting would be at Dr wine would it be a good idea to work with a realtor or do we just like go around looking for listings on our own well we recommend working with the realtor saves time it's more convenient and we highly recommend JR from SW real estate he and this team are amazing they have been so great at communicating with us Non-Stop and showing us around at all the different locations so we are going to give you that recommendation all right done yeah we're just gonna copy the realtor then yes copy copy all right I guess we're just gonna toast on it you know Phil the Ocampo Woods in the BGC let's let the apartment shopping begin it definitely sounds like BGC is a pretty safe neighborhood for our fam but as non-residents of the Philippines we still really have to think about protecting our family against the same types of risks we deal with back home yeah even with the great medical facilities and doctors here we could easily bankrupt ourselves if something went wrong and we didn't have the right medical coverage safety Wings been our go-to resource for those things that seem to go wrong for us on a regular basis like the time I got appendicitis in the middle of Mexico and had to have emergency surgery or the time Cole got so sick in Vietnam that he couldn't leave the hotel for days or all the times Colt gets bit by reptiles and needs antibiotics can I like Adventure our biggest benefits with safety Wing are the medical protections for sure but we like that our policies also cover us against travel delays and interruptions lost checked luggage natural disasters and emergency evacuation and we love that whenever we need help we get connected with a helpful human being in a matter of seconds everyone knows that travel these days carries enough risk you're really just rolling the dice if you're not being proactive about protecting yourself and your family use the link in the description or just go to follow abc.com Insurance to get a quick quote from safety Wing now let's go meet our realtor first we need refreshments lemonade medium with brown sugar may I get a winter melon milk tea with round shed brown sugar tapioca pearls sugar level level uh less ice cream we gotta go bring the juices with us we'll drink on the road because we we're supposed to meet our realtor in about five or ten minutes but luckily everything is really close together we're probably only a block away from where we're going and we're gonna walk from one building to another because everything is so close together and walkable here our favorite thing to do since we've been traveling the world for three years officially now and I constantly talk about how hot and humid some of the places we travel to are I'm officially retiring that concept you will never ever hear me say that it is hot or humid again I went the wrong direction today of all days it is so hot and humid can we please just get there I knew that was gonna be an issue the only one seems to be more confused about where we're going than Erin is Google Maps just keeps changing the location changing the directions right there it says Verve residences Tower two and that is where we're supposed to be are you Jr yes yes realtor too they've hooked us up all right so we have one place to look at him here today uh yes we're gonna check out the first place we're only looking at three bedroom units th floor oh th floor get this apartment you probably get used to it pretty fast I love the positivity nice and bright hallways and smells of fresh paint built in four years old you love it I love it oh my gosh this has to be my room because you know why in our apartment that we have right now I have this in my room and I every morning like because I wake up super early I had to just go out and stare at the sky while listening to music and this would be my bathroom so would this one come furnished yes yes yeah so all the stuff here States yeah the bed there is really small really yeah you guys can never fit on that boat together without no no it's short so yeah sure it's misleading we'll have to a really good start I love this unit and right here is High Street and this is the closet hallway so there are four total I'll get three so it gets one there's just one vanity sink in here but a walk-in shower I'm guessing there aren't bathtubs all right I want to look at this kitchen real quick love the countertop it's got basically everything I need but I'm a little curious the stove is very small for the space they allotted for it I've become one of the counter but I don't cook much so I don't think it matters I think that's pretty much par for the course same in the place that we're staying right now same with the refrigerator but yeah I mean especially for the uh ocampo's neighbors we are probably not going to eat in here very often maybe breakfast sometimes lunch for the most part we're going to be eating at every restaurant in BGC yeah that's true I'm not cooking but we're off place it is listed for a hundred and fifty thousand Filipino pesos which is approximately I think it's about twenty five hundred dollars USD per month I like that it's Plug and Play TVs not just out here we've got one in the in our bedroom so two TVs I mean we really don't have to buy anything as far as Furnishings we would have to buy things like towels and linens and you know there's still things we would need but this isn't the most important part most important part is the rest of the building let's go check that out thanks a lot Brooklyn is asking us how we rate it on different levels and so she's keeping track of the score what does this one have honey . we'll have to compare that because we still have to rate the building itself the gym and the pool and those points are out of a maximum total of then right because it's four of us so we're voting yeah can you start carrying a bandana baby so you can dab my face like Rocio does for Melvin yeah freeze outside is cooler I'm gonna take a quick look at the clubhouse area right now called the function room so if we wanted to throw a huge party with you Campos or a big meet and greet this is where we could do it the over wedding this is a huge huge room there's a lot we could do in here meet and greet was the first thing I thought of there's a play area I think this is for kids I think I think she's outgrown this okay let's go all right where's this gym very important uh-oh we lost everybody also where's Colt this water is really cold that's going to be nice especially for Phil on a very hot day that feels good all right we gotta go though this is the lounge area this would be good for meet and greet also okay now this is the real pool huh it's shared with both Towers so we were in Tower two this is Tower one and they only have one really big pool right now I am specifically focused on if there are any high places I can jump from into the water here's the jam plenty of cardio four treadmills four stationary bikes dumbbells racks free weights lots of benches functional equipment checks all the boxes it'll work we'll get the job done apparently there's an upper level we gotta check out this is like an open space dance studio you could do yoga up here or practice your Tick Tock dances whatever I feel like I would come up here if I'm alone and I would do my own little workout my isolated workouts for my abs stuff like that there's a degree different well Fahrenheit there's a degree difference between upstairs and downstairs in here I'm not sure what that is in Celsius five degrees seven degrees foreign I worry about her and our schedule so what do you guys think of this building and this unit I think this is my favorite one so far it's also the only one the accomplice here's another Factor we have to consider we want to be as close to our besties as we can and they're gonna be without giving anything away about two and a half to three blocks away from here not bad we'll have to consider that after Brooklyn tallies up the scores between the three units we're gonna see the next building we're gonna see is right next door and they have a coffee shop right at the very bottom and this building is called the Meridian this is a nice cool air-conditioned Lobby th floor for this one so a little bit lower which Aaron is probably happy about apparently a lot oh so a different layout here and it feels like it's thicker it feels more open all right so what's the price on this one this one is with parking but parking is about per month which we don't need when you say what does that mean pesos so this one is a little less but this is the master bedroom we're in here and whoo got dizzy but this is a really pretty view there's a lot of Park area right in front of us can't look and then this is the third bedroom so probably Where Brooklyn would be if we have this unit and it looks like there's a balcony but just Windows no access to it how many bathrooms in this one since there's no there's no ensuite for this room is it two two bathrooms here there might be another one in the maids quarters the yaya quarters I like how the kitchen is open I like this layout another bathroom yes yes but Yaya's bathroom so some apartments have that space so a yaya which is a Mater housekeeper can live in and stay there so the next place we see it's in the same building right thank you buddy I think you're welcome cool looks very similar to The Verve oh here's the gym I would say that the gym is very similar in in quality and versatility to the last place so either or is it on or something there you go it's just got a lot of weight on it Jr what kind of deposit do they require it's a standard is too much security deposit that will be returned to you after the lease and are all these prices negotiable are they pretty set they're actually pretty set so we have one more okay one more unit we had to come back down to the lobby because it is different Tower and a different owner of the unit what floor is this one on this is um . do you like hi oh it's late lunch time oh yeah the couch is really comfy but like I feel like after a while it's gonna feel stiff yeah dining table is great this room is great look at the mirror I'm taking that by the way if we get this I'm sorry I like that this has a vanity yeah and we're missing that where we're staying right now and then this is the the Hall of closets here of purple the Ube closet now I'm hungry for dessert and these lights are interesting I like them I think they're they add character so this is culture for cleanse I don't know this is called okay and over here actually all the bedrooms have this view this is High Street right below here and our real term is telling us that it's really pretty at night when it gets lit up oh and there's the Nike store we have a view of the D billboard D billboard okay so also three bedroom two bathrooms right not counting the yaya quarters that's right which is right over there a lot of counter space again with the ranges being much smaller than the space they fit into okay so this one this is the first I've seen a washer and a dryer uh it has the yaya bathroom and this is the first time we've seen an actual bed or mattress in the yaya quarter and this unit is pesos right in the same range I think it cuts a heavy door thanks heavy all right that's actually really exciting stuff thanks for showing us pleasure to meet you guys thank you but I don't know how the timing is going to work for us or not so we'll talk thank you so much I'm gonna go from least to greatest on water favor Apartments Belize it was actually a tie between the second and the third apartment um both of them were .\n",

      "I believe it I loved that unit that was clearly my favorite so that was everybody's favorite ranked at the highest voice let me point something out to you the first unit was the only one where you each had your own bathrooms the first apartment was definitely a clear winner for me I think that the building was newer the units seemed to be a lot newer and cleaner but For Better or For Worse we can't pull the trigger right now because it is mid-september and we really couldn't start a long-term lease until January at the earliest because we're finishing up this trip here in the next few weeks and then we won't be back until the end of December because we've got a really big trip throughout Africa for the Safari in November so we're very limited on being able to take advantage of having a home here basically through the end of the year so I think what we're going to need to do is keep looking and seeing if it's still available when we're ready to pull the trigger and really planning around being in something for the new year at least though we have a lay of the land and we under we understand of what we're looking for and now when we see future units become available in those buildings we have a better understanding of if we're going to like them or not on paper before seeing them he's the Lizard King finds them everywhere well we really hope that you stick around with us to see what we end up in next time we come back we're going to do some more shopping and we're gonna be here more and more because we truly love the Philippines we truly love BGC and we truly love our besties that we have to live close to hope you like this video if so give a thumbs up let us know in the comments which one you think is the best and we have more episodes coming up here from Manila with some really cool Adventures around town and just outside of before we head off to El Nido so please hit the Subscribe button follow us along that's my chair\n",

      "today's video is going to primarily be towards you filipinas I normally am talking to the foreigners and actually I will after this first part in the same video after addressing you with Filipinas then I'll have some just some commentary for the the foreigners so let's go ahead and jump right into it what is the purpose here of this video I'll tell you what it's not I'm I don't know you I've never met you I'm sure you're a sweet woman but there is an issue that needs to be addressed and chances are if you're if your boyfriend sent you this video it's either because he's warning you ahead of time or this has already become an issue in getting to know you now I understand the culture in Philippines is very different things kind of move a different way but that's also true about Western culture or any culture really outside the Philippines and if you're going to date a foreigner my purpose here is not to criticize you my purpose is not to put you down in any way again I've never met you I don't know anything about you but my purpose here is to help you my purpose here is to make your dating experience with a foreigner go smoother okay that's the whole goal of this video so how can we do that well out of all the things that can happen especially when you're looking to make that first impression the first few dates we're talking about may be the first five dates especially if you're if you're still together after four or five dates you're kind of sort of entering into a regular relationship where you know each other a bit and but those first four dates or so is your chance to make a good impression now yes it'll be nice that you know you do your makeup or you put on a nice dress or you do your hair those are all good things to do to make a good impression but where so many Filipinos drop the ball and ruin things before they ever get a chance to even get started he's on this one important and I'll emphasize that again important issue which is showing up on time okay so you're it's your first second third or fourth date this is your chance to really impress him on this one key point so what we're gonna do in our example is we're going to say that the foreigner has asked you out you met him somewhere got exchanged numbers you talked a bit and now you're gonna have your first date or your second day and so you both talked about it and as you're talking about it you're discussing what time you get off work what time you get off school when is a good day when is a good time where's a place easy to meet these are generally how you set an appointment and the crucial part is what time so for our example we're gonna say that you're foreigner boyfriend and you agree after he has asked you what time you get off work in this example we'll say that you get off work at five o'clock and that you need a little bit of time to go home again do your makeup whatever and get to the place so let's say that you get off work five o'clock and you both agree that you're gonna meet at o'clock that gives you two hours you agreed this is enough time for you to get home do what you're gonna do and then get on a jeepney and get to the location now let's say that it's at the mall and you agree okay you're gonna meet at the mall at Starbucks seems like everybody meets at Starbucks so you're gonna be you both agree you're gonna get off work at : and then you're gonna do what you got to do and then you're gonna get there and you're gonna both meet both you're gonna both be there at : p.m. at the Starbucks at the mall so when you get off work at five o'clock and if you know that it takes to minutes for the jeepney to get from your home or wherever you're gonna be coming from if it takes minutes for the jeepney to arrive at the Starbucks at : p.m. this means you need to be on that jeepney no later than : because again you subtract minutes from o'clock and at : so you get off work at : you go home you do what you got to do you look at the clock and you go oh my goodness at : I better start heading out the door so I can get the jeepney because you already know sometimes the genies are full sometimes the genies are late so you're gonna need to get out there at : to get on the genie at : so that you can arrive at the mall by or : p.m. on time now that's what you need to do that's what you need to do and if you if your boyfriend or your upcoming date sent you this video it's because either you've already been late once before or his previous dates were late and he doesn't want you to be late because being late to a foreigner is very rude very rude and and I understand that there's Filipino time and all that but when it comes to a date you do not keep a date waiting and waiting and waiting you don't do that it's very rude so I'm gonna be talking to the foreigners here in a moment after we just cover this and and I will tell you right now general courtesy says that you wait for a business appointment about minutes if the person has not contacted you that they're running late and minutes ago by the person waiting has the option to get up and leave now if they get a text that says within those minutes I'm almost there I'm in traffic I'm on my way well then you can give them another minutes okay now here is the problem a foreigner will wait and it'll be five minutes to seven or even seven or even seven ten in our example and the foreigner will get a text from a Filipina saying I'm on my way and then he'll get another text at : saying I'm almost out of the shower I'm gonna go get the jeepney now here here is something that that drives foreigners nuts if you're gonna be somewhere at p.m. you don't leave your house at p.m.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 2:\n",
      "I know that seems simple but it happens all the time and it drives foreigners and nuts because you cannot be at the Starbucks at p.m. if you're leaving your house half an hour away at p.m. it's impossible it's impossible you're not gonna get there in seconds if it takes minutes which again this is why you leave early now I know a lot of excuses come up and the text will be well I'm late I'm the the traffic and I couldn't get a jeepney and I was waiting on my babysitter and I just got out of the shower and my brother you know went to the sari-sari store how that connects with anything nobody knows but here's the thing is we foreigners know that every single day filipinas wake up every single day millions of them and they they get on a jeepney for minutes and they show up at work and they clock in on time every day six days a week if they got to start their shift at : a.m. or : a.m. they already know they got to leave early they already know they got to account for the jeepney they already know how long it takes to get from the street to their time clock so that they can clock in on time so we know you can do it which is why when we wait for up to two hours because we're being told I'm almost there I'm almost there and really you haven't even left the house yet or decided to stop by your sister's house to borrow some shoes at : when you should have been at the Starbucks at o'clock so I will tell you I'm telling you this because I want your date to go good so my recommendation to you filipinas is please show up on time treat it as if it was your starting shift for your job it's that important because we know you can do it we know you can plan and arrive the place on time because you do it for work all the time or you do it for school so when when you leave us waiting for half an hour an hour hour and a half two hours it tells us we're not that important to you we're not important enough that you would plan ahead and be there on time that's what it tells us so if what we're sitting there waiting alone thinking you know if she really wanted to be here on time she would have left earlier I guess she's really not that interested so as I mentioned a common courtesy is to wait minutes and if there's a text we'll wait another minutes after minutes even with excuses the person waiting has the right to just reschedule or cancel the meeting the date so do not expect a foreigner to wait more than minutes it won't matter how many excuses you got you could have been there on time and so after minutes if if you're not there expect that a foreigner may very well get up out of this chair pay for his coffee and leave and what he does after that he may give you another chance on another day you know he might reschedule and say you know I had plans now we're gonna miss the movie that I had planned or we're gonna miss this or that so we're gonna have to reschedule now if you're lucky he will reschedule on another day if you're not so lucky he's gonna say you know what she's just not taking this serious so he's gonna get out his phone and he's gonna go through his contacts or he's gonna go on one of the dating apps and or he's gonna just walk into the mall he's gonna find someone else to go out with who can be there on time so if you want a good dating experience with your foreigner boyfriend show up on time if you show up half an hour late minutes late an hour late don't expect him to be there don't expect them to be there I mean some men are very patient maybe even too patient and if you're lucky he's one of those guys but really he's already been insulted you've already been rude to him you already had him sitting there waiting for an hour because you didn't think it was important enough to leave on time okay so that's it that's it if you really want your date to go good plan on being there five minutes before if he says o'clock plan on being there five minutes to seven and you'll impress him okay now that's all I really have to share with you filipinas if you want you can end the video right now I'm going to talk to the expats now and we're just gonna kind of like go over this ourselves now if you've been dating in the Philippines for any period of time again I've been dating on and off here for the last six years and when I dated in the United States it was it would happen its life sometimes you do get caught in traffic and the thing is though pretty consistently if a date was going to delay more than - minutes I usually got a text and they would text I'm at such-and-such intersection they would let me know where they were so that I could calculate okay well you know traffic there at this intersection you know there's communication and and it's usually honest communication I'll give you an example I was now meanwhile in the Philippines give an example I was in CDO and I hadn't even planned on going out on a date that night but a Filipina contacted me on Facebook and said hey I heard you're in CDO I want to meet you at the mall and you know big fan of your videos all that I said okay so I got dressed and I said okay let's go meet at the mall at : and we can get some dinner and get to know each other so I arrived at : I got there a little bit early even though I had never been decidió I I got on the taxi early and and I got there at : at the mall and then I had to I'd only been there once before so I had to find my way to where we were gonna meet at the food court and by : I was there waiting at the food court and I waited until : we were supposed to meet at : and by : no texts nothing saying that she's late nothing and then around : I got a text and are you there well of course I'm there it's : or it's : and we were gonna meet at : so yes I am here and and then it became this tumbling random text I'm almost there I'm just about there I'm in the jeepney now this went on until : : now this went on until : it had already been almost two hours an hour and minutes and she finally at : said after already telling me she got out of the shower after telling me she's already on her way now at : she says oh my sister showed up so now she's gonna watch my baby and now can leave the house and I said well where are you how far are you from the mall and she goes oh it's not far it's only minutes now she's already an hour minutes late she already told me she's on her way and now she's telling me she's about to leave the house at : when she was supposed to be there at : and she's not gonna get there till quarter to : which is minutes before the mall closes so I told her no I'm leaving I mean I really shouldn't have waited beyond half an hour but again I believed the text she was sending me and that's the message that I'm gonna share with you expats I've made this mistake believing what they tell me now I have a whole new approach to it and this is what I want to recommend to all expats I think we need to communicate to all Filipinos through our actions that we're gonna have from now on a standard rule a standard rule which is if if there's no text to explain why they're late minutes after the date no text at all we're free to walk away if there is a text within the first minutes of them being late and they're saying they're on their way we'll give them another minutes because that minutes plus the next minutes makes minutes now if after minutes they're still telling us well I'm on my way I'm almost there when they should have been there a half hour ago we need to let them know it will be our decision whether we will exercise or exercise our right or not - now walk out because they're more than minutes late so if they say I'm almost there and and I'm like don't leave because I'm almost there we have the option to either leave at the minute mark or if they're telling the truth if they're telling the truth that they really are almost there give them one last minutes shot that's a total of minutes we don't have to give them that but if we're being really generous to the patient that day we go okay and if she's still not there after explicitly saying that she's almost there in the next minutes which is now minutes late we got to just walk we got to just leave even if they do show up at minutes we need to just go because it's just insane there has to be consequences this is why they show up on time at their job every day because there would be consequences they would be fired if they showed up at work every day an hour or two hours late they would get fired and and if this girl is trying to make a good impression on us and she can't even respect our time to show up within minutes of the agreed time she's understand we're rescheduling tonight's date is done in fact at minutes we really have the option to just walk the extra minutes is like the last bit of grace she's gonna get but really at minutes if she tells us after being minutes late that she's almost there and she's still not there minutes late we really got to start walking we just got to go and either reschedule that if we really want to go out with her reschedule it reschedule it to the next day the next weekend whatever there needs to be a consequence to making us wait it's just really extremely rude and and we also have the option of just going you know I I want to be with a girl who wants to be with me wants to be with me enough that she'll show up on time not leave me lollygagging around for two hours while she's picking out a pair of shoes at her sister's house before she even gets on the jeepney know we need to start down line minutes wait a little longer if there's a text within that first minutes if they're still not there in minutes and now it's the st minute we really got to just walk just walk and and if you're really that disgusted find someone else to date you know you're probably already at the mall just go and chat up to girl and ask her what time she gets off work and then take her out you know or get on get on one of the the dating apps and and say hey what are you doing at o'clock I'm already at the mall you know my date didn't show up you want to meet and then take them to the movies you know take them to a nice dinner because the other girl again you know if she's gonna show up late and unannounced bring along some friend that she never mentioned and and just show up with this other friend and say oh I hope it's okay well no that's not gonna fly either we need to just say you know I had a date scheduled with you you showed up half an hour late with a friend we're gonna talk about this over text but tonight's date is not gonna happen sorry and then just walk away and and you know again if she's gonna say well I got all the way over here yeah you got over here half an hour late with an extra friend so we really got to start laying down the law and again it'll start communicating through action that no the days of us waiting around an hour or two hours for them to show up and totally change the schedule totally change the plan totally everything that's got to end so minutes if they contact us we'll give them another minutes if they're still not there after minutes we have the free and clear option to just walk reschedule the date or get a date with someone else we really got to start doing this and I believe as we do they're gonna start realizing you know we should show up on time because the girls that show up on time there they're getting the dates with the foreigners and the foreigners are walking from the girls who show up two hours late so it's gonna take some time it's gonna taste some consistency and that's that's really what I'm putting out there for all you expats when you get out here don't don't become a doormat don't don't sit there and wait desperately for two hours for her to show up while she she's because here's the other thing if she tells you she's on her way at minutes after : and then she tells you minutes later she's about to get on the jeepney you know what that means she lied to you so not only is she showing that she can't be punctual she's showing that she can't she can't be counted on to tell the truth and if she claims oh well I misunderstood I thought you meant you wanted me to leave the house at : and and then just show up and I'll be there when I get there well even that is not a big improvement over lying because that shows that there's really a communication problem if you're gonna date a girl you want to date a girl that you could communicate with and if she can't figure out the difference between arriving somewhere at : and leaving her house at : you probably want somebody with better English skills than that so that's my recommendation to you expats a -minute grace period after that it's up to you you want to sit around for two hours fine I'm saying we need to start laying down the law and just saying you know if you can't show up within minutes of the agreed time I'll find someone who will that's what we need to communicate all right love to hear your feedback tell me your stories about Filipinos how late they showed up how how long you waited how it went and we'll talk about it there in the comment section all right see you then you\n",

      "hey friends Mike and Jess here and welcome to Regeneration Nation TV today we are doing something a little different we are reacting to Filipino drinking etiquette I think this is very exciting we're trying to do some different content dabble in a little bit of stuff but also learn about the cultures of the music that we've been reaction reacting to that's very interesting to us like exactly personally I'm a bartender so I'm very excited about this just because it kind of relates to my other job this came across my recommended feed because excuse me I've been you know I've been wanting to dive more into the cultures that we're reacting to learn more about it so when I saw this one I was like dude this would be so perfect to react to with you being a bartender Jess like knows so much about I get I don't want to be wrong when I say this but you know so much about alcohol so I guess you could say I know about American drinking etiquette if we have drinking etiquette I don't know but I just figured that this would be a very interesting and fun video to react to I'm excited I can't wait to see you I'm very excited as well we're getting away from a music reactions a little bit but if you do like this video leave some recommendations for more stuff like this yes we've thought about diving into different things other than just music reactions but keeping it in like immersing ourselves in different cultures yes um I love to cook so something else I've thought about is you know getting recipes from you guys and and trying to cook them you know making a video out of us trying to cook meals and and tasting it for the first time as well and uh so yeah if you have any other recipes some recipes you want to throw at us yes please because he likes to cook and I like to eat and it's a match made in heaven and I feel like the video would be amazing but anything else as well so uh yeah I'm excited for this I'm excited for this let's get into it let's do it communal drinking is a vital part of Filipino culture from the smallest birthday parties to Big Town fiestas Filipinos just can't seem to get together without having a few drinks on the table however believe it or not amidst the chaos lies and age-old Order welcome to Philippines and this is Philippine drinking etiquette okay this guy sounds Australian and I'm not Australian in the Philippines aren't that far from each other yeah um I'm wondering about his ethnicity and how he you know thought about doing this video yeah I'm interested in that maybe it's a character his face though and he yeah he's okay yeah that makes sense he is playing a character it seems like as well yeah pain drinking etiquette I love it following the opening of the bottle the tangaro also called the Gunner and one of the into the characters of the drinking culture in the Philippines assumes an important role now prior to the commencement of the festivities a small portion of the intoxicating liquid is poured into the cap then subsequently emptied onto the ground this ceremonial offering to the spirits is considered essential for a safe and devil-free session for the homies yeah you're right considered essential for a safe and devil-free session the tanguero pours the drink every time measuring the liquor okay so the tinguero is like the bartender basically and yeah you know I don't know yeah interesting the participants are not given individual glasses this is in accordance with the tradition of bagay which means a show of trust camaraderie and in these days a United willingness to enter in a coveted Russian Roulette common glass passed in a round robin sequence dude could you imagine everyone at your bar sharing the same glass that I don't think that would happen but there are a lot of people that sit at the bar and they're like alcohol kills it alcohol will kill it so I feel like there's a lot of people that'll be like alcohol will kill it a covid Russian Roulette oh my gosh that's really cool I mean the parts that he was talking about before that the camaraderie the trust yeah I like the idea of that the we've done that I mean I remember when I first started drinking this is gonna get too deep into it but we would literally open a bottle and literally pass it around like it's awful horrible you do crazy things when you're young and silly but that's absolutely right after like not even care if you're not your willingness to enter in a coveted Russian Roulette as drinkers share a common glass passed in a round robin sequence that's cool it is frowned upon to take a pass but when a drinker is excessively intoxicated a substitute from within the group must consume the short in the drinker's place without affecting his or her own turn to maintain okay so it doesn't affect their own turn so they have to take their friends and someone else's you gotta take what that's the definition of taking one for the team man somebody's got to do it it's a hard job serious without affecting his or her own turn sequence it is customary post an assumption to return the shot glass to the center of the table will hand it directly to that tangero to be refilled for the next Drinker what it's chicken oil yeah please let us know in the comments I've never seen a packet of chicken oil like that I've heard of chicken being cooked in oil but not chicken oil hmm oh my gosh the composition of every drinking session varies however it is important to familiarize oneself with these characters has to be aware of their characteristics the Drunken Master a legend gifted with immunity from inebriation usually left with the task of cleaning up after all is said and done The Walking Dead these creature's will to stay conscious despite consuming overwhelming amount of alcohol is commendable and allows it to continuously engage with the group I'll be it for me sudden disappearances it leaves unnoticed bringing with it its share of the bills the usual catalysts of trouble it turns aggro and overconfident with every shot but that might be my mom sorry Mom this is so she's the werewolf it's literally breaking down every single Patron that I've seen at the bar they have a name dude you shouldn't send this to your other bartender you can start oh we got a werewolf over here we got a werewolf oh my God it turns aggro and overconfident with every shot the concert queen or King oh my a frustrated vocalist this creature bogarty karaoke machine in its quest for validation you're sleeping okay someone said that Roland abante they like them uh they prefer him when he's drinking and does karaoke I'm not sure we haven't got to that reaction yet I'm not sure if there's a video of him out there drinking while doing karaoke or something but I did see that comment I thought it was funny and now this makes me think of him he's the concert King oh I want to see that he doesn't need recognition though he doesn't need uh validation a frustrated vocalist this creature bogarty karaoke machine in its quest for validation the Sleeping Beauty with its loan tolerance for alcohol this creature lacks the ability to stay conscious with its introduction in its bloodstream because it is immobilized early on in the session the Sleeping Beauty is the primary target for embarrassing photo I'm such a lightweight and when we start I haven't I don't really drink that often but man when we first started dating I did get my face doodled a few times you did that's so crazy you helped I did help I'm sorry I didn't just doodled myself put makeup on him that's what it was I'm so bad but I mean I guess I deserve it for being a Sleeping Beauty you're the first one to fall asleep I'm the primary target primary target for embarrassing photos and unwarranted pictures of it too the runner the one task with the acquisition and Logistics of essential supplies to perpetuate the drinking session such as ice and booze one privilege of the runner is that it is able to choose the food it likes to be consumed by the group along with the alcohol you see for Filipinos no drinking session is complete without the accompaniment of food yeah usually use the greasy and fatty variety this is called and it comes from the filipino word meaning to pick up now it is acceptable for drinkers to grab small bites in between shorts what is that are those little like bits of rib or something uh it's some kind of meat but it looks delicious it looks so good even that little like bowl of something yeah that looks so good this is to remove the bitterness from the alcohol as well as prolonged intoxication as the food is hoped to slow down the alcohol from entering the bloodstream it is unacceptable however to consume the pollutant with rice as it is meant to be shared and not to be hoarded and treated like a meal in the event that's interesting all right all right I'm loving this dude this is very cool you can't have your own little plate you gotta just pick it up and eat it and share it with the rest okay I like that I like that I do like it and not to be hoarded and treated like a meal in the event that grease or fat is unavailable inexpensive nuts and chips are usually the viable Alternatives including some Boon out of creative Ingenuity like the tuna and Kanto crackers okay what that's the fancy stuff right there he literally put some elbow grease into it literally you can't tell me that you haven't had friends over and you're like I don't have anything in my fridge and you just whipped something else you literally just come up with something yeah I've done that a couple times I'm judging too harshly you're right though like you're when you're young I feel like when you're younger you don't care as much and like you you just get away with it and your friends are like wow this is awesome it's just because I don't drink as much anymore if I was drinking even at my age now and there was nothing else to eat I'd be elbow chopping some crackers you get creative something you would you do think of it you just get creative this is hilarious I've seen foreign cheese the clinking of glasses and the partaking of a shared beverage containing every participant's DNA is meant to honor old friendships celebrate new ones and in certain situations possibly avert oneself from being violated with a sharp piece of metal designed to break up ice that was so good that was so funny that was an awesome video that was very very fun and entertaining and educational as well yeah definitely I always every time we learn a little bit more about a culture uh it's like I want to adopt some of those things into my own life yeah and that is definitely that had a lot of those things well you already have the butt crack going for you so there's that hey they didn't need to know that they didn't they did not need to know that I don't need to know it either other people gotta share it with me sorry I already get enough crap from our sons for my crack showing sometimes okay I didn't need you getting in that was very entertaining and I couldn't believe like I love when you see different uh cultures like have we have similarities we do have similarities like when we get together we have a party we don't necessarily drink out of the same cup I mean depending on how much you drink at one of them sometimes you definitely do sometimes you just don't you just but it's not a it's not a necessity you know yeah if it was that would be I would not mind that sitting around a wooden table seems very familiar to me yeah just having a good time with friends and having like this communal time yeah just sounds so much cooler like you're not doing your own thing I would have a harder time with it because it's it's against tradition to turn down the drink and I'm like I I baby my drinks I get made fun of for it so much I baby my freaking drinks and I disappear here and I will pour one out sometimes and I'll come back like yeah I'm done I drink it how where's y'all's at I drank all of it I couldn't get away with that stuff here okay that's not good yeah you'd be right there all eyes on you you can't yeah Sleeping Beauty oh my goodness and like certain friend groups you get here it's definitely if you fall asleep first or if you pass out you're going to get messed with yep you're the one with the facial Doodles for sure yep but some friends are not like that but to know that it's like a common thing it's just like man I'm it makes me stressed out I can't go to the Philippines and drink with y'all man I would be in trouble yeah you would be I wonder when I would be able to go back in there and look at my drinking style I'll have to go check it out I feel like you're the first one the very first one the uh the Drunken Master the Drunken Master yeah right you can hold your alcohol okay I probably would be in charge of the cleanup later though because I probably would be exactly you're all responsible and stuff even when you're drinking it's crazy let's clean it up let's get it get it the best that's hilarious that was so freaking that was fun I look forward to more videos I hope uh people have some uh links in the comments below because uh that was really fun hopefully this spurred an idea in you of something to send us yeah if you've seen anything like this even if uh you're not one of our Philippine friends right now and you're watching this something from your culture as well we're interested in diving into every culture yeah definitely no limit to other cultures yeah and yeah about the food thing don't forget send me some recipes you got to tell me what to buy so I can trying to whip these creations up I can eat it I want to eat it I really want to know what they were eating we need some communal eating around here we do that would be fun all right friends we'll see you on the next one bye friend peace\n",

      "today we're in manila the philippines at the world's first chinatown also known as binando there is a massive selection of food here with a mix of chinese filipino and spanish influence but mostly chinese this is really delicious my name is josie welcome back to my channel or welcome if you're new here let's go eat in manila the philippines okay so we've been dropped here at the binando church also known as the minor basilica and we're kind of in the middle of literally everything that's going on right now as you can tell i've got the san lorenzo ruiz sign over there and there's just a lot going on there's people there's cars there's buses there's jeepneys there's everything in this intersection so we're just on the walk now down to chinatown to have a look around there grab some food grab some dumplings whatever whatever else there is but let's go have a look let's start our journey so i didn't actually plan on this happening but i've seen a bubble milk tea place here and i'm craving a brown sugar milk tea so let's start the video with that and then we can wander onto some food thank you so much so i got the brown sugar milk tea i never actually used to like bubble tea and then i tried this one and i like it and i haven't been able to branch out since so tell me down below what's your favorite flavor of bubble tea because mine's still brown sugar the good one still definitely my favorite yeah delicious we came here with empty bellies to have as much food as we can so let's get going for some food so we're just walking along we just found a place that just had some like pastries in the front counter so we're going to try this we asked her if it was a donut and she said no so i'm not exactly sure what this is at all uh donut no no but it has some kind of glaze over the top and it kind of looks fried it kind of looks doughy let's try it um it does taste like a doughnut so i'm not sure what the name is if you know the name of it tell me in the comments but it tastes like a donut if the light is going up it's either really hard to chew or maybe a little bit of stale i'm not sure so there's plenty of them in there which makes me think she wouldn't make that many if they were going to get stale if this is a little bit fresher i think it'd be perfect in saying that it's quite substantial because it is so like hard to eat and bready straight off the bat we have been to chinatown in bangkok and that was sort of more of the you know street vendors in the streets every cart outside on its own but here i'm finding it's not really like that as you can see it's kind of restaurants it's kind of lined on the side with all these different kinds of restaurants but there's not that many food stalls um there was a couple of things of fruit on the side of the road back there but not really like street street food if that makes sense but let's go look for something i think we were hunting for some dumplings first okay so we're here at tasty dumplings and surprise we've ordered dumplings we ordered fried dumplings it comes with two four six eight eight dumplings and then you have the soy sauce here on the side so let's try these i don't think i've had fried dumplings before only normal dumplings so let's give them a go oh that's one i have them a lot they're really good either dumplings i don't often have dumplings so by no means am i a dumplings expertise x expert but they're really good so when we got here there's probably like one other person and now the place is packed out so they must be getting the dinner rush right now so those were some pretty amazing dumplings if i do say so myself so right now we're just walking to place at number two and we're gonna get something a little bit different obviously than dumplings because we just ate them um but right now it's starting to get a little bit dark it's starting to rain a little bit but people are still out eating food we're in sort of not the most busy street but i think we're heading back that way in a little bit so let's see what's in this one let's keep eating we're just walking down this hidden lane but it's actually starting to rain right now so oh here we go so we've come to the lumpia it's newpo hang lumpia house and we're gonna try some of this we've seen so many people try this so i think it's our turn let's have a look so it was super quick to get the actual olympia i think they have them ready to go on the like table and they're just wrapping them up and conveyor building it for when people order it must be super popular this was pesos filipino pesos let's see what all the fuss is about so i believe olympia comes in a fried version and a non-fried version this is the non-fried version but i actually tried the fried version in my last video so i'll leave that on the screen and in the description bar below go check that one out but this is the non-fried so let me try it first without the sauce smells good i've never tasted anything like this before i ever i think it's got it must have some kind of like it's like sugar or something it's really sweet so it's kind of like there's a bit of grittiness but it's i guess just a whole mix of vegetables in there you've got like the wrap the soft sort of wrap on the outside and then you've got the like medley of vegetables and soft but crunchy things on the inside as well all right let's try it with the sauce there's definitely a sweet element to this like yes it's vegetables and yes it's a wrap but something sweet about it i really like this i could eat this all the time this is really delicious it's really like crispy on the inside but also soft oh so good i've heard they have this option for breakfast obviously people buy it at all hours there's people chowing down behind me right now we're sharing one but like i might get my own after this wow so we just got here to twanky and the line here is crazy it's literally out the door around the corner and down the street pretty much it's raining the rain is pouring down it's so busy inside so i got the asado with the adobo egg and i'm excited i've never heard of that never tried it don't know what it is but i think it's really local i think it's local filipino so we're going to give it a go and make the lechon kawali i've most definitely said that wrong so tell me in the comments below but they're both i think pork dishes this one's just like more like a crispy pork and the one i have more is i think of a traditional filipino food but it comes with the egg and i'm not sure if it's like roasted or not i don't know tell me in the comments below um but i'm gonna try it i've never had this one before so michael got a calamansi juice oh i really like that it's like it honestly tastes like a lime i think it's made out of lime is it lime it tastes like a lime juice it smells sweet smells really sweet which is strange because it's pork but let's have a go but the pork is cold i kind of expected it to be warm i'm not sure if it comes like that or if we were just talking for too long before we ate it but the sauce is really sweet the outside of the pork is kind of crispy but you still have the softness of it like it still kind of breaks apart in your mouth i'm a little bit nervous to try these eggs though i'm not sure why they've just got like a ring of brown around the numbers i don't know about it but actually read a little bit about this in anticipation of trying some local foods and um i said it was a sweet almost sugary tasting oh my god a sweet almost sugary tasting pork which is like right up my alley that's perfect so let's give it a go okay so throw up the bath it's really nice and i really love the sauce the pork is so nice it reminds me of like christmas morning at home with my family let's try without the sauce first so i had like a first bite of that and it was like a lot colder than i expected and also there was like a bit of bristle in there i hate grizzle if my teeth touch something hard it like freaks me out it's like when you're in the um ocean and something touches your leg and you're like that's happened to me that's michael's dish so he'll try it for you hold on there's like a a piece of bristle inside every single one of these these larger pieces personally i like gristle if this was hot perfect but it's still pretty good like this anyway and obviously the sauce being super sweet makes it even better for me the rain right now is crazy everyone has umbrellas so everyone's in there raincoats we're trying to get to the next place right now there's a lot of rain and there's a lot of scurrying along to the next place so we're here at wai ying fast food it must be pretty popular because we have been in this line for quite a long time so let's see if the food is worth it it's been a while but a whole group of like eight people just came out so maybe this is our chance to get inside let's see and the line is super long behind us we were so lucky we got here i walked back to get jose because he was hiding under the out of the rain and we just got here in time there's probably like maybe people behind us so pretty well we waited for about minutes outside in the rain so this must be the place to be if everyone else is waiting there as well now i don't often i must confess to eat this type of food so i had no idea what i was ordering but the waiter definitely told me the most popular which he said was the beef wonton mommy so we've ordered that i just went with what he said and he's also good we haven't asked some chinese tea i'm pretty sure which is warming my hand okay so we have a big big bowl of like soupy noodles it has beef it has wontons it smells like beef i think even water let's have a go let's look at these noodles let's bring them up let's have a taste so the vibes here are immaculate we're eating dinner and someone's on facetime with like their family probably behind us it's not like ultra modern at all it looks quite old and a little bit traditional so you're obviously coming here for the food we lined up outside everyone else lined up outside so this must be the place of super good food let's try these noodles full of noodles full of soup there's a little dumpling in there there's like veggies everywhere in there and of course the beef which is what the main thing that you want to eat something like this and when it lives in that soup it just cooks in that soup a little bit more that is so chewy it is so super chewy all right let's try the noodles not a heap of flavor with the noodles but texture-wise the consistency is really good and they broke apart super easy i think you like this josie normally hates soup we go anywhere like this she goes not soup but we've got it and she's trying it i do love noodles even if i don't like soup so let's go oh i like the noodles i openers a lot they're definitely like flavored probably beef because it's beef wonton i might try a wonton now i don't normally have wontons or anything like that so usually so i have a wonton in this ladle it's surrounded by all the soup few noodle noodles in there the texture kind of freaks me out a little bit i think i've had one of them what do you think of it the texture is strange it's like soft and like rubbery well not rubbery because it's soft i'm a little bit nervous but i don't like that at all sorry it's um too chewy i'm getting like bits of fat so even though this wasn't for me i can tell why people come here it is a very nice tasting dish the taste is on point we're gonna finish this off and we're gonna wander outside and we'll see when we get there so while the wonton beef mommy wasn't my favorite i can see why it's really really popular but i have a sweet tooth so it's time for something sweet before we end this video let's have a look so here at wonky bakery let's see what they have all right so we have a pineapple poppy oh what is it propio i've never seen this or heard of this if you have any information of what it is it just looks like pastry with like a filling um but i've never seen it before this one's pineapple let's go oh okay it's like crunchy and hard i expected it to be soft the entire way like i expected the pastry to be soft i expected the pineapple to be soft it's actually really chewy and hard totally different to what i expected it would be but it's pretty cool to snack on the pastry is falling everywhere though um that's pretty good that's nice it was like pesos as well so pretty good price so as you can see it's almost night time here right now we've been here all day that's at the end of our full day here in bernando chinatown in manila in the philippines some of it was really good i tried a whole bunch of things that i'd never have before and some of it wasn't my favorite but that's totally okay i've tried new things and that's what this is all about before you go please press the like button on the video and

      "good afternoon everybody so now we're at Market Market here on the outskirt of BGC and today we're on a mission because today we're gonna try one of the most famous popular Filipino fast food chain but from a Twist it's like a Pizza Hut but this place is called Greenwich it's a pizza place fast food so we're here at Market Market so we're just trying to find the entrance and then we're gonna try this exciting Filipino fast food chain uh I believe it's on this side yeah so it's our first time trying uh Pizza in the Philippines actually especially for me I personally can only think about pizza like fast food pizza as similar to Pizza Hut so I cannot imagine anything different than Pizza Hut so this is my expectation right there Pizza Hut level okay hey don't have surprise or expectation otherwise that's true I think in my years of travel has told me one thing is to set no expectation for nothing then you won't get disappointed or you won't get excited at all it's only when you are there and then you'll find out what it's actually like all right so we have arrived the entrance right here Greenwich wait Alina is always so scared of everything and she would keep saying means like means like so scary I don't know why I'm so scared and Justin asked me to go like a scary room you know where is there yeah people usually scared you so we do have plans to go to one place called nightmare Manila yeah a child I guess I will be crying security hello so for those of you who don't know what uh nightmare Manila is it's basically a haunted house in Manila and we plan to go there one day to subscribe now if you want to watch that episode where I keep getting jumpscale Alina start crying baby baby I think it's on the right side so just saying we had a bit of a scare because we searched Greenwich on Google Maps and he only look at us in England I think yeah is it is this like a UK chain or something because yeah so strange um oh Greenwich is here over here so it's right next to other fast food chains Greenwich it's like a green witch like a witch no different spelling but oh so it's kind of like like based on a manual first impression it's uh they have Fried Chicken's here it's everywhere fast food chain you go in the Philippines you will see a white chicken wait but just before we go in looks like there's something going on here looks like there is like a dress Festival this got Queens Bloom Festival so many princesses reminds you of Disney yeah yeah I'm not very into fashion in general so when I see clothes I'll just walk past normally but I know for Elena she likes Fashions a lot because she worked in a model industry before fashion today it's okay it's okay today holiday today holiday anyway let's head into Greenwich and see what's the deal about this place I know usually pizza place around the world in Australia it's I think it's harder or less people who eat Hawaii in general more people prefer pepperoni but it seems like here in the Philippines see the big one the big photo it's already called Hawaiian overload I like Hawaiian yeah you wanna take that one the pencil mix every different day I don't think so I don't think it's very common okay let's see all right let's have a look at the menu first and I send yeah so we don't block anyone okay wait so basically on this side based on so I'm just reading off what I see on the menu right now so there's overload the big pictures and all in or in could be a mix of all the ingredients based on my understanding my guess uh and then Classic Pizza cheeseburger cheeseburger they take everything from friction spread across uh cheesy bacon and ham that sounds like Hawaiian but with no pineapple ham and cheese ham and pineapple that's just Hawaiian no what's the difference between oh I see Hawaiian overload has some green stuff Hammond pineapple classic don't have see it look yeah there's some green stuff over there it's like capsicum maybe here don't have though like a set like this because it says good for two people yeah so we can get a set I don't know if we can finish it because in general we have small eaters but uh looks like there's an Overlord bundle fried chicken with pizza okay let's take this bit okay all right then okay hi uh can we get one overload bundle for two please okay look at that I remember that in Pizza Hut usually you can get only one pizza for .\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 2:\n",
      "really yeah two chicken two iced tea and like big pizza yeah to be honest a bundle that costs around a little bit less than Australian dollars pretty good deal if you eat it in Australia I think it's gonna be over or even Australian so yeah it's the value but I think so far this is the most expensive one let's not be happy maybe that can't go bad right lasagna and Hawaiian pizza I think I have quite a bit of expectation for pizza in general but I want to tell you guys a story when I was in kindergarten my teacher would make us pizza in kindergarten and I don't know why but in on Pizza there is peas like green peas and like it was disgusting it was just like the worst Pizza I had it's haunted my memories ever since in my childhood trauma I don't know but it's so disgusting I remember always when I was in kindergarten when I don't like something when it's macaroni with soup and everything you know the likes of it I would just pour it into my no the Highlight is I'll pull into my school bag so I don't have to eat because I cannot leave until I cannot leave until I eat everything so I just usually pour the soup and everything inside my school bag and my mom when she opened the bag I was like oh my goodness what's going on here so smart baby I think compared to the biggest pizza place in like fast food in Australia usually there is Domino's which is similar to Pizza Hut or similar to Greenwich here in the Philippines but uh Pizza the indominos is around usually if you get a special coupon there will be maybe around but this is a regular set in Australia it's only if you get a coupon but on average I think it's around Australian dollars yeah that that amount but yeah here are the I think the difference is also here they serve fried chicken and so on I think that's very common in other countries uh oh it's two two sets wow I thought it's one I'm gonna share one wow that's awesome okay all right let's let's try it I I wonder how different this Fried Chicken is compared to the other fast food chains how's the iced tea that so sweet it's okay maybe it is yeah just now we missed number because uh usually quite a number or I think you should just now open the machine no just now heard machine saying like oh they're called a number maybe I'm hallucinating then but uh this looks good all right let's dig in so on the menu today on the side dish we've got some fried chickens and I believe this is like a bread maybe like a cheese stick and also called lasagna and we've got some icy here and we're just missing the pizza which is coming along soon all right let's try this let's try it okay let's try it uh let's start from lasagna okay because I'm a fan of lasagna oh I'm gonna be transparent with you guys I've never been a fan of lasagna I don't know why but maybe my friends I always go to his birthday party and when I hit the lasagna I don't know why it's natural reaction yeah I remember when we lived in Seattle I give yeah there was a takeaway that was good let's see if this one matched that uh that one right there okay that's right feet mushroom inside okay one two three excuse me that's all right thank you thank you thank you that looks good it was you were already in my mouth okay one two three this video is sponsored by a live laugh the best place to buy Korean beauty products in the Philippines Welcome to our skincare

delivery Lincoln bio that's it for this app that's it stays like a good caramel lasagna okay yeah I think I'm slowly getting used to lasagna I think I'm used to its face people I don't know why but I didn't like the layers I felt like it was just eating flour but now I'm kind of used to it it's like eating a lot of pasta with that Wally used for us bread it's really cool I think my patient was there just now kind of important but it has increased a little bit good so for Today's Pizza we've got a Hawaiian overload pizza with pineapples and cheese and capsicum I believe now I'm so thinking are you meant to dip the into this stick into the gravy because it's for the chicken oh you're right don't forget rice sauce right yeah oh I finished mine already you finished your stick I think it's for fried chicken though it's a mushroom oh really mushroom sauce give those Rye if you know it's rice it'll be so nice it's like Julie beef mushrooms it will be rice a little bit too much yeah I'm sure too much coughs okay time to try six people looks delicious yeah so you juice juice I like pepperoni the most all right let's get this bye what do you think I like it well what do you use backpack like food Hawaiian pizza I think it's even better than uh Pizza Hut because Pizza Hut it's first it's expensive if you pay they give you like this size this is beautiful yeah no wonder it's so popular well we didn't know about because for me pizza I should be taste the same everywhere so I was just thinking like what's like you know how different can it be but it's actually a pretty good pizza I think in my opinion the only thing that I could compare with Pizza Hut is the cheesy crust if they're cheesy crust then it'll be perfect I don't know if you just ordered extra cheesy because I'm not too sure I need to find out I can say I like because it's fluffy it's like uh it's like this you have a inside so we have some new pizza I tried before it's so thin you know Gordon Ramsay would say if foreign I think Philippines always has its own version of fast food that is more affordable and quite tasty to you know I don't eat this one because I just have it I don't eat this one this is my favorite particular ly yeah it smells like fried chicken okay give a try I think it's okay just fried chicken yeah it's usually inside from the way around so it's well cooked but it's just fried chicken I know what yeah yeah not bad the thing that I find most intriguing after staying here in the Philippines for six months is that they'll be Filipinos love their friends which ones tastier Marina or this one no debate about sorry I'm trying to deepen the sauce as well the mushroom sauce foreign I know what you mean yeah I like my my food has a mix of different texture and flavor oh run some example will be will be adding your potato chips into ice cream yeah McDonald's you just quite interesting taste rice combinations are there check check no I mean other than fries and like shakes fries and oh yeah keep their fry butterfly flies into the shake it's so our dressing just in chicken monster already eat food chicken yeah it's a monster thank you very much oh roadblock all right thank you thank you very much oh I'm so full yeah it was really feeling I didn't expect that I thought I would come here and I thought we were just like yeah I don't know overall mixed review for me I'm very surprised I'm I can say it's uh better than McDonald's in Philippines I kind of agree let's make a ranking what do you think fast food okay for me I guess I'm I'm not fond of manganaso but I still love it because I think this is for me number one wow pretty much number one okay I don't remember the bad give me five second is a second all right yeah and no no no jolly beetle Jollibee second okay three ISO and that's it get all three only yeah I can give you guys a top buy for me I think okay all right so number one for me it's always gonna be my I'm a big fan of it uh second I think would be I think on my second might be trolling B second will be jolly B third for me will be Greenwich yeah for me yeah ciao King will be number four number five I think yeah but I think yeah my favorite part about grooming today was I was generally surprised by the portion for pesos you could get for two people it's very generous and you can get pizza at such affordable price it's a privilege to be honest yeah lucky let's come here today yeah I think it's time yeah I think it's a really good experience very feeling welcome to your Vlog hello yeah that's the thing when we always go and uh Vlog people always say hello very kind yeah yeah and she was so shy distance all right anyway thanks for watching this episode see you guys next time bye wow\n",

      "Whatsup people, welcome to a new episode here in the Philippines so after our trip to Tagaytay we actually come back home to Manila rest for few days and now it begins a new trip so today we are here in Coron already so in next few days we're gonna explore around coron and El Nido to show you guys some of the best landscape around so I know Coron and El Nido is very famous for Limestone close like the ones in Krabi in Thailand and also like beautiful clear blue water and that's about it because my family from Hong Kong is actually coming to visit us in the Philippines and we're meeting up in coron so my father actually flew in yesterday from Hong Kong and then after that my brother he actually flew in from Australia Melbourne to uh come and join us on this special trip for them super long trip but uh it's Alina's first time meeting them as well so yeah she's never met my father and my brother before so it's gonna be nervous to meet your family it's so exciting yeah I think you're the best girlfriend that's met my family so it's gonna be quite interesting yeah to be honest I'm me too and first time meet with like my boyfriend family oh really yes first time and it's also this is my first ever time vlogging from my family so it's gonna be quite interesting experience especially speaking English in front of them because usually back at home in Hong Kong we spoke in uh Cantonese but after years of living in Australia and also traveling now my first language is English so it's actually my fluent yeah Cantonese anyway um I believe when we arrived here so they were asking for a lot of hotels and we were told that we cannot ride tricycles from the airport to our hotel because it's around kilometers so it's quite far away but anyway um you've got a list of hotels here so basically when you arrive you just need to say we are from say like this hotel and then they will have a direct shuttle bus shuttle van if you don't tell them Hotel they won't let you go yeah and also you'd pay so for entrance yes so to enter Quran just then as you saw there was an environmental fee of pesos per person per person yeah per person and after that the shuttle here condo driver I thought it was free but no you have to pay per person again so anyway I think it's around the same price as tricycle so it's not that much of a big difference and just now just now we fly and our plane don't have conditions so we don't have icons so it was so hard they even say they even say we approach in advance that your aircraft's gonna be really hot but in the as it could be cooler but it was so hot just now it was a small flight as well it's only rows so the flight was going like like this so a bit uh scary anyway our minivani is here so um let's head out onto it and unless I go to the hotel you're nervous no I'm nervous of course I'm nervous it's okay don't worry my family is very nice I think last few few years I've become in in introvert yeah don't worry just uh tell them some Russian words and they'll be so happy okay okay all right so well welcome to coron luckily here I have icon yeah luckily he have aircon right how does this work okay ah like this so the egg one doesn't go away what does that mean yeah it's a normal transport Transportation like we don't we have buses but usually we use gazelka minivans these are called minivans yeah yeah it's like a Russian Japanese with the aircon version oh never mind around like pesos pesos is around the same price right I'm so excited to meet my father and my brother yeah speaking of uh while we're waiting for other passengers honestly I'm gonna talk about some background stories so I haven't actually met that uh met up with my father for the last five years just because coronavirus at the start and then after that it was just oh wait before that was two years not mad not meeting him and after there was coronavirus like in total five years I haven't seen it already only uh video call and my brother I met him seven months ago so yeah that's you um yeah it's going to be quite interesting for Alina amazing to see how they different or the same be family with brother how like they behave yeah My Brother Talks a lot just heads up my brother is going to talk to you a lot okay it helped me improve my yeah exactly um because Alina has been saying my English is so basic so yeah now I understand everything but I think on the drivers yeah he's waiting for other passengers to think so uh yeah I think here in Plano one they don't speak Tagalog so they speak a different language actually so yeah maybe they'll understand but um they don't speak Tagalog here I believe because I know around the Philippines there are so many different languages I don't know what they called here the language palawanis I don't know let's anyway let's try to learn some new words today and uh something that's similar to it okay hello yes hello how are you yes oh so only looks like the only uh passengers yeah yeah that's good yeah I get some rest then I think I think now now we're gonna um yeah because our flight was one one o'clock this time anyway now we're heading to the hotel so um yeah

      "Segment 2:\n",
      "not like how old is he let's say he's close to .\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 3:\n",
      "yeah let's say he's got I don't want to review the exacts yeah it's really crazy yeah he's uh that's why when he says like oh we're Three Brothers we were actually agrees yeah this kind of reminds me of uh the local areas oh like the islands that I went to Thailand it's very natural with fresh air everywhere that's what I like finally away from whatever the smoke yeah not complaining but Manila it's uh can be quite polluted sometimes yeah but anyway let's uh go and find a restaurant here and uh from why my father said oh this is a petty petty diving flag diving yeah Petty diving flag no idea Petty diving you know you know when you get a certificate for diving you come to like one of these places to get the center yeah be fine okay in the next few days we may be yeah I think so together I won't be scared yeah all right let's find food I don't know if this side let's look on Google Map to see what food options are there I don't know why but Alina's phone actually has better signal than mine even though we're using the same plan yeah everywhere like this not fair yeah yeah okay anyway where are the restaurant options they say there is like Thai restaurant Korean barbecue everywhere ask your father which way he going oh yeah let me ask him let's go back yeah for this trip I intentionally brought my uh water slippers away from our normal Center they said this is which one oh is it this is great yeah let's see more I think many people like so famous I don't see a tourist where is the tourists it's good that we are not in a tourist area for me I don't like going to tourist area I like going to the beach and open path and uh yeah I like going to local places I know I mean this is a hotel straight I think anyway we're in the main town so yeah it looks so modern and simple and it's cheap yeah it's at a good price I would say I wouldn't say it's cheaper it's a good price all right so we begin on a hunt to find some food here in the Philippines in Corona I mean and if we go up the hill apparently we are just a couple minutes away from the main street in coron town so I believe this is it and I'm going to my father they've got different things to eat but now it's around four o'clock so ideally we don't want to eat a lot so we're just gonna eat something small my favorite restaurant and dogs chicken yes fine you're fine you're okay don't worry okay it's more a bit more developed than uh just now I think they say has more things I think go it's around small street oh cover your ears guys this is uh whoa It's smoke Construction there are lots of um tricycle is around too but a tricycles looks a bit different this looks like one of those are Armored Cars you know what I mean I'm a cast that goes to bang and take money it's also one of those but modified from open the back inside oh actually do we have money to buy food yeah we do we still have yeah so you have some a couple hundred pesos yeah we forgot it's okay to be alone see many tricycles but they look so different all of them oh wow bigger bigger the tricycle is a custom yeah custom they try to make it something special yeah I think they can choose their own colors you know like when you it's like when you're in a game when you're in a computer game and you can choose choose your character and choose your like different colors yeah the chocolate colors here look very different and see there is this one smaller I think hello hello all right what else is there I think this is going to get a quick bite so maybe like a cafe if you want coffee yeah there's a cafe here we can get some Bakery if you want oh let's walk around yeah walk around and see yeah so this is the main coron town and you can see lots of tour companies over here as well motored by Grand so I wonder how much it is for one bike uh it doesn't say a price four hours hours hours so it's got hours it's not going today interesting something that uh usually in other countries according to days and even in other places yeah but I don't I don't I don't think we'll be traveling around with waterfire to be honest I won I know you won but uh yeah but I think because we're there four of us and my brother they don't drive other bikes so very likely they'll take tricycle go find a drive drive right your father can drive no can I yeah it's not very common to drive a motorbike in Hong Kong Australia yeah super it's a very scared of music I'm telling you copyright copyright all right so after walking around the streets for another like or some minutes we just haven't found any lots of a good Cafe options or restaurants around here I think even though it's a rather tourist town here there's not enough um like I guess like restaurants or facilities around here even though we've got like chicken manok um but uh not now not now we were thinking to get something like very small like a snack kind of thing um I guess like there are restaurants here but there's not enough variety but uh there is McDonald's yeah um I wanna even I wanna eat Jollibee hot dog yeah if they have one yeah they say having a McDonald in your area usually it means it's a symbol for like your area it's very developed last time when we're on our way to uh Pico de oroco our friend uh told us that last time yeah I've got McDonald's that means this is a very developed town yeah let's see what they have actually we have never had McDonald's in the Philippines so this might be our first reaction of McDonald's as well yeah all right anyway let's head right in and see what's uh in Philippines McDonald's oh through dry fruit throw Helena cannot pronounce it Justin cannot cannot pronounce dressed with you no one can no one can Russia there is true today all right let's Head Right In McDonald's yeah so many people inside yeah I think I'll be down for a burger or something yeah all right ladies first okay oh so many people in there oh it's a nice aircon okay outside or super all right let's uh hello hello all right um let's see what's on the menu so whoa we're here in McDonald's in Philippines they always have a rise actually they always have a horizon very possible meal so uh it's like Jolly spaghetti but like uh chick fried chicken with spaghetti with tomato sauce and they've got the same thing as for mushroom pepper steak one thing is different though is the um the top the chicken fillet with uh looks like corn corn sauce I don't know what that is but it's like a sauce and sauce but of course we're gonna end it with the McFlurry later so I'm not sure if you get the stomach for it I think I think I will eat apple pie yeah they they want to go to dinner and later I think we're gonna try to like I'm gonna spend some family time with them later so maybe we'll drink like a cup of beer and we're gonna try the first impression of San Miguel or something so I think it's gonna be quite interesting beer yeah only in the Philippines I think I think in I'm gonna have to but uh anyway yeah let's try to order food I don't think I put apple pie will be a lot different here so um all right all right yeah I actually only ordered the Apple five I think apple pie in general should be somewhat similar to other country so there won't be a lot of deviations not oily so it means um it's freshly fried so it's nice not to um no what's that word when um the chips get very soggy soggy that's a word and right here we've got a cheeseburger so um let's um see first impression our cheeseburger Yep looks very expanded meat plants inside and there's ketchup but please go to Russia fine it's your everyday sitting in toilet I Don't Wanna Be recover y yeah this is Sprite it's more like a water than Sprite I don't feel like a gas the bubbles inside I agree it's very diluted it's not a lot of soda inside chips fries were good I think it's like very freshly fried you can taste it it's not soggy at all right now on to the main start of our today's dish you can see inside there is some chopped onions some pickle tomato sauce so yeah it looks like a very standard cheeseburger I guess exactly the same no surprise yeah no surprises they're all onion not bad all right so after McDonald's just then I think to be honest the impression of McDonald it's more or less the same as other countries apart from the fried chicken and rice and those other fishes as well it's quite interesting and full disclaimer I would have tried a fried chicken but I didn't uh just because of my stomach issue I don't want to risk it anyway after McDonald's we came back to the hotel which is just going to take some rest because we're so tired and later the rest and charging our phone and later we're gonna go to somewhere maybe interesting place yeah maybe we'll go and grab dinner later okay let's go private boat tour USA tomorrow Private Island yep oh how many you said I saw in your message he said six islands six islands six islands and there are more places to go tomorrow how much uh um for the whole group just for the boat yeah and then um there's every island there is actually a tax or something that we have to pay like yeah usually there is one yeah so that's um so that works out quite well I mean if you go around six islands then we have to pay something per person something for the whole group yeah maybe that's my person yeah that's a per person so the is for the boats right yep for the whole boat and then on top then we have we have to rent out the alcaya oh okay so we will tow for Kaya to uh by the vote to the destination and then go around and then we can actually jump on the kayak and kind of like that's nice yeah yeah okay tomorrow yeah let's do it so what happened is that it's actually we start at seven o'clock um the guy the tour guide will actually come and pick us up and we go to market to buy something so that he can cook on the boat for us oh all right he cooks yes wow and uh no actually there's a there's a there's a chef owner in the boat and they you cook for us wow and he will and then the tour guide will take us to the island okay around yeah so then we finish the day around P.M back in hotel that sounds cool to you yeah sounds good sounds good to you guys yeah that's good then I actually attacked him now yeah let's do it that uh pick us up at seven o'clock in the hotel uh on his van and take us to the market and go shopping yeah sounds good it's gonna be a fun day tomorrow yeah it sounds like it so it's gonna be a full-on full fully packed uh boat trip tomorrow so uh we're gonna be like so burnt the whole day Under the Sun yeah it's gonna be complete Sunburn and these two they're actually doing another boat till after Quran from Coronado it's got called a top Expedition I'm sure you guys have heard about it before but I think they're gonna do it themselves and we'll meet them back in El Nido after a while so it's gonna be a lot of road trip boat trip for the two of them yeah I hope I don't get any seasick and hopefully it's not too choppy all right see you guys at dinner all right see you later all right so now it's around sunset time so it's time to uh grab dinner so apparently just then on this side there is a uh there's a coron town the main town with lots of food options we missed that just then we didn't see it but apparently there is a huge variety of options like Korean barbecue and even so maybe we can get that later yeah but anyway this is my father I'm hungry yeah it's okay didn't you just eat a lot I thought you ate like a three portions of seafood just now yeah yeah tell you the cheaper platter that we had was full of miniature craft and miniature together oh so it's also it's mini size yeah uh crap even the crap because I didn't get much of the crap at all right what's this size only oh no okay yeah right how much did you pay for the craft uh was it worth it how much did we pay eight for your pesos the car was one of a doggy oh excuse me yeah yeah I think the park is about pesos pesos yeah obviously we did not paying enough to get the diesel yeah I think it's rather tourist areas here so from what we observed just and everything was quite quite a lot yeah compared to other places yeah I think for motorbikes usually it's uh for a whole day it should be around pesos when we're in Cebu we saw that price but here it's pesos for one hour one to four hour okay yeah so and then the whole day is around like wow that's so good yeah wow so good price you can pay more than pesos about pesos so good it's a good price anyway this is my brother Jason yeah he flew all the way in from Melbourne and uh he uh took a red eye flight is that mean it's a last night he didn't sleep much so he's definitely three hours I think he was in Singapore last night ah do you go to Hawker Center uh what do you guys think do we look alike and uh what do you think of his accent is it a very Australian I don't know you tell me I think so I think the the real test is when you talk to Alina if she understands it means it's Australian blue all the way in from Melbourne and my father flew from Hong Kong so my family is all around you're well respect it looks exactly the same like a brother yeah my father looks really young to finding my neck just have a good metabolism family so skinny okay everyone so young yeah my father looks so uh so so young welcome to Asia how's your impression of Quran so far your first time seeing tricycles during my previous trip oh yeah and I think this trip will actually get to try try to try to ride on them yeah that could be cool because the last time we went here was actually in Cebu it's our our whole family second time right together in the Philippines welcome to the family yeah the new member new baby yeah yeah we walked down I think we walk up to here just then and we just gave up yeah are you so look at me this will be years of him later years years yeah yeah I think in the comments people will say you're very young maybe you look like Max like h Max Steel maybe feet away he's actually guys we are Brothers Three Brothers yeah it looks like it and a little sister yeah I think uh in in the Philippines the one thing you can try later maybe it's coconut they call it Buco here which means young coconut okay buco yeah yeah it's like a smoke opener but they said mostly and drinking here so hectic as uh as a night just now huh no we actually didn't come that far I think there's a lot of tourist stuff oh oh wait no we did oh look at that speaker yeah we're going so fast wait copyright copyright I'll walk like this the film is so fast yeah I think that's a impression of most foreigners when I first came to the Philippines it's the fact that they need to cover the nose because you guys may not know what to say in the Philippines and um because they're just lots of Vehicles like tricycles and motorbikes and everywhere we feel here so fresh that's true yeah after living in Manila this cannot be compared yeah we just got some fruits here we got like two oranges and two mangoes did you try for okay so oh two orange two mangoes that's good yeah I think it's okay yeah it's okay yeah oh so I was dying for some advisements here how was uh how was the fruits here uh more or less the same well we've only had one meal hmm what's up it was good yeah I know a bit small yeah I don't know if Corona Oneida is famous for seafood but if we had a chance I think tomorrow we're gonna go on a boat trip we got a decision to make so are we doing Korea tonight or are we doing Spanish I think let's do Spanish maybe okay yeah change my mind let's do Spanish today just because my stomach has been having some issue with meat Spanish rice will be nice oh yeah we walked past this just now but we uh walked away goodbye I think there is not a lot of Spanish options inside for what we saw this then yeah yeah I had a look on Google yeah it doesn't look very Spanish it doesn't look very Spanish thank you now you understand when I first came to Philippines why focused so much yeah Chicken manok on the side of the road hello hello oh yeah that's pork belly yeah it's called liambo I think so we see liamfo olympo yeah and this is chicken okay manuk and you see them grilling this is my memory in Cebu uh yeah the only thing I remember it's like a chicken rolling on the South Street and my mouth is watering already yeah so good it's okay plenty of chances we can eat this later I think we can just one night buy chicken and then come back and eat nightmare I think it'll be good idea come back here why is this woman holding a spoon because I want to teach you Asian Asian weapon and and uh Asian weapon yeah I see you guys three three of you guys reactions like put chicken like like this like this like a dog in the street yeah exactly now you know it runs in the family we love chicken yeah wow I feel like I haven't uh I was thinking we might go out there wait okay oh up there Rooftop Bar maybe yeah later for after dinner maybe it's nice yeah nice I think if you're up there you overseas the whole Harbor I heard you bought a bottle of wine I did yeah really yeah in the duty-free section I don't think it ended up being cheaper right like say a dance but what kind of wine is it super Nash wine I have no idea what it is I need to try it I was gonna pretend I know something but I like though yeah yeah that one yeah oh yeah you're right there's a lot of more options here there's creep in town uh Thai food oh I missed Thai food really we will see I need more questions yeah we didn't continue to understand we uh gave up very quickly but yeah it's got a huge variety of options yeah and I can see there's a lot more tourists around yeah I see this is the main town and why did they eat McDonald's yeah McDonald's no I'm not hungry I believe these thoughts has a name but I don't remember what kind of it but basically these stores they sell things in smaller portions we're looking at our mangoes come back that's uh every time we go to another country I always look for uh fruits hello hello I don't know if they they say kamusta here because different language yeah I need to ask later at a restaurant I'm doing a tour there's like a street fan doors like the skewers usually when it comes to viewers here in the Philippines it's usually intestine like chicken art intestines not a fan the real streets oh this is not the real Street this is not the real street oh wow crazy there is a street called the real Street all right are we Crossing further maybe one tip if you cross in the Philippines you need to put your hand out he went away you know me ah this is it I think ah yeah there you go oh there's a rooftop pass too looks nice and my camera perspective all right so this is where we're gonna have dinner tonight so we have dinner Spanish food Korean Spirits they just come but already know everywhere okay so funny we're drinking sangria Spanish wine drink and then we close in Russian yeah they're so tasty fruit wine foreign Spanish place so we had a really good dinner just then and I had some tough houses of cocktails just stand and we came across the other Sample Road and there's a Italian pizza here and it's the authentic open roast you can see the flame behind there as well Italian pizza have you had Original Italian Pizza before yeah oh I remember we went together actually yeah I think here I'm just saying we really missed out this part of Corona we didn't see there is a I think there's more like a tourist town there lots of foreigners around here as well and they also have different kinds of cuisines but I think we're still a little bit hungry I've got space because I mean these these guys they have like uh hungry family so we still need to order my favorite which is chicken manok inasau so we're gonna go and grab one of the chicken on the side of the road and uh maybe share between us and we've got some wine today so we're gonna have some oh hello hello kamusta is it kamusta hello hello I don't know if they speak uh anyway because I think it's different language I don't know if there's I think we'll go by walk maybe get chicken on our way back you really got to be careful in the Philippines crossing the road all right so now we've got we're going to the chicken place so um yeah hopefully we can get some nice chicken we saw two stores to send on the South Road I don't know what what stuff inside usually for chicken I'm chicken expert here usually there's spring onion inside or it could be just not stuffed or just like on it on the outside there is a honey glaze so I know some some minaso sauce and something like my natto sauce give me free agreements yeah a lot of Spanish Italian Spanish food oh my God to be honest yeah but

can I try this one Tai Chi thank you okay so we've got the tea I have never seen orange tea before so I'm excited to try that wow and we've got so much food guys we've got way more than what we were expecting but everything just looks so nice it smells nice as well right now we're gonna take it back and try everything but yeah we've got so much for you guys I'm so excited to try it all and I think we've never tried majority of it as well okay so we so we are condo and there's nothing else to say we just need something you just need to dig in to be honest let's start we're going to start off with Roti John that's what I love about Malaysians you know because they're they're very friendly yes they're all asking like where we're from and they were so good at like helping us yes what to pick as well let's start this one so a lot of the locals were saying that they only sell some of the things to Ramadan so that kind of makes it feel like a really good cultural experience and we've never experienced a Ramadan before this is actually our first time trying Rottie John this type of bread and omelette some chicken lettuce some spring onions and lots of sauce a lot a lot of sauce I've noticed that in Malaysia they love sauce like you're a saucy Saucy Nation um how is it not nice sweet chili sauce it's not too spicy as well and the bread the bread is just so soft this is nice it's really nice it was a big mouthful it was delicious honestly I wasn't expecting to um like that as much as I do because I thought it'd just be kind of like a sandwich but it's really flavorful it doesn't feel like bread I know it is bread it looks like bread but I'm not getting bread Vibes I mean we've got lots more we've got lots more to try can we try this because it's right in front of me I've been eyeing this up since we left so this is a vegetable spring roll we've had vegetable spring rolls before but let's see how this is cheers good crunch oh wow it tastes different not really at all I like not only there's I thought there's going to be greens I'm not sure what kind of vegetable this is right so uh maybe it's cabbage leave a comment Down Below guys what this is um because it's a hard workout do you try the sauce as well it's really good hey there's loads it's not that spicy I don't know yeah um it's a bit hot I thought all spring rolls would taste the same but actually that's got a different taste to it I mean I love that I'm not sure what this one is potato oh yes sir Samosa it's like it looks like that's so true okay let's go oh my God that's my favorite so far wow it's got like some kind of flavoring around the potato mmm that's so nice we should have got more of this coated in some kind of um it was really good I might just go back tomorrow like the combination of things I'm tasting right now is just incredible have you eaten the whole thing already yeah well done I'm telling you I'm hungry should we go to the vein yeah yeah all right so now my favorite part we actually had one on the plane last night it was quite funny the packaging said best last evening I highly doubt that the airplane one is the best one but hopefully this is gonna be better so if you don't know what national map is it's basically um the Malaysian national food and it is coconut rice piece of meat you can either be chicken or beef you've got your and anchovies anchovies nuts nuts and what's this um cucumber cucumber eggs and what's this fish it's actually come on a banana leaf and they were so good because everyone was kind of serving themselves but we didn't really know about how it was meant to how it's meant to work and they were so nice they just did it for us and they were like explaining everything so it's so good and I got this big piece of chicken here look how big that chicken is what's so nice about Nasi Lemak as well is I'm not sure what it is but it has this kind of like really crispy almost hairy coating but it's like almost like flakes of something um chicken is amazing it's so flavorful oh my word that's really good that's better than the other two we've had best Nasi Lemak I've had so far the rice is amazing as well so good there's so many different flavors I can taste coconut I can taste lemongrass I can taste like all these different spices and herbs on the chicken really juicy these sort of flavors I've never just a lot of flavors just going on but they're the sort of flavors I'm just I've never really had that often and the rice is just insane not too spicy either yeah the one that they um on the plane yesterday so he was like so spicy it's so spicy give the video a like if you're getting hungry watching us eat do you want some nasty lamac you know the food is good if I'm not talking that much yum can't stop the rice is just so nice any locals want to tell us kind of like how you do Ramadan uh give us a little bit more information because we've done a little bit of research on Google but it basically just tells you the very simple facts I'm enjoying it though I like trying all these different things and everything was pretty good price as well I think oh it's the best part it's time for some sweet sweet desserts so since we already tried this time we should try it first so we didn't mean to try it the guy was like please try it try it so he tried it honestly describe it it's like a bad name yes it looks like a bird's nest look at that it's like what even is that um smells so good as well ready Cheers Cheers wow that's so good and the texture is so strange but I love it it's kind of so crunchy but so it's so thin so subtle and it just kind of breaks in your mouth it's crumbly I wonder what it is it's so cool I don't even know the name to Google it I wonder what flavor this is this is pistachios it's pistachio I'm not really keen on pistachio but let's see um good wow no it's so crunchy I love this wow I don't know why we haven't tried this on our first time here last year I've never seen it is this only during Ramadan as well guys I tried it was amazing um yum it's one of my favorite desserts ever so you can have it every day if you want once a day pancake now we did actually the last time we were here but let's this one's different it's got sweet corn in it is that on purpose or did that just accidentally cut I'm not sure get in here cheers that's so strange it was nice dude wait yeah yeah there's a sweet corn in it we got the um the Nutty filling you can get chocolate and get some as stuff this is so strange I can't get over the sweet corn it's really sweet and then you've just got this corn flavor but it's nice the pancake's really good as well really fluffy all right so to finish it off we got this one here I literally just saw it and I was like so cute it's kind of like a mousse it looks like something that was like a liquid that's now dried um said it was coconut and oh like a spoon so it's like a mousse it smells nice is it in a Banana Leaf I can't remember what it's called oh this is like nothing we've ever had before is it good that's so good oh that's good that is nice it's not too sweet as well it's just perfect it's not rich yeah I can't believe there's not a single thing that I haven't thoroughly enjoyed like every single thing we've tried has been like out of good like there's not been anything it's just been like oh it's okay that's all been really good Malaysia just seems like a Foodies Paradise honestly the flavors are just incredible finish mine already anyway we've had such a good time today I really enjoyed interacting with the locals I just found it so wholesome that that first the first three they really they're so Lively as well they're so nice and they were really interested in like Czar and then Zar was obviously interested in him because at first I couldn't tell if he was joking or not because like they were all just shouting out they were like telling us to go around the store and then they're gonna show us how they how to cook the Roti John yeah they put inside it oh we forgot the drink and oh yes but we're gonna hold it there because we actually forgot to show you the Thai tea that we got so you can actually get this for just five ring it if you get it in a cup but because we're taking it away we thought it'd be better to get it in the bottle so this was actually tendering it so a little bit more pricey I would drink out of this we're in a glass might as well couldn't get from there I don't know what makes it orange me and Zoe were not we're not a big fan of tea despite the fact We're British we are actually we don't drink tea very often but I can appreciate tea though it smells like chocolate does it oh that is nice is it sweet um is it sugary it's a very small hint of tea yes it's very milky but I like that I like that it's like a subtle tea because like I said we're not big tea drinkers I find it a bit too strong but this that is nice a very wheat chocolate no it tastes like tea I drink that like that's nice but anyway guys hopefully you like the video if you did make sure to hit that like button and leave a comment down below press that subscribe and press

      "good morning everyone we're Nicole and Mico welcome back to our discovering the Philippines Series where we travel around the country to learn more about the culture and for me as a Filipino who's lived outside the Philippines for way too long learn more about what it means to be Filipino if you caught our previous video you'll already know that the moment that we landed in the Philippines we were quickly whisked away to a distant relative surprise th birthday party so today is finally the day where we are going out and exploring Manila all right guys first stop of the day is known as BGC here in Manila which stands for Bonifacio Global City I knew I wouldn't remember and it's known as like just a beautiful like place to come and do some really high-end shopping it's a very big commercial District I think there's like quite a lot of work options in the area as well like very businessy folks it is not very busy right now although typically it is but it's actually because we're still here a little early nothing's open I think it's .\n",

      "things open around so all we've come for really is coffee as we want a really nice coffee this morning yeah apparently it's like a beautiful like walking Street a very very nice place for pedestrians yes and I'm hoping a little bit of coffee will just Elevate the entire walk-in experience but we gotta find one that's open that's the hard part right now okay my love yes because they look amazing oh it looks it was expensive but oh man it's really good I think this like the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf we've seen this like there seems to be a chain here um it's beautiful honestly inside like there's good working space and like really nice comfy chairs reminds me of a Starbucks so if you're a digital Nomad you need it's not to work this would be a good one so we've been in Manila for a little while now we haven't done a ton of exploring and today is really that first day but what we've noticed so far is that there's no shortage of Comforts and conveniences here in Manila oh my god there are so many like uh restaurants and chains and shopping centers and so many great like places to get a good coffee and just yeah be immersed in like this Mega City it was a sign I just saw and it said that because there's a ton of cats here which is like kind of weird that it says that the cat population here is actually really controlled so they catch them they they are new to them and then they release them back here and then volunteers feed them so they ask you not to feed them because they get lots of food oh that's cool wow wow trippy this is the future folks newest billboard it's on the it's got a corner the billboard has a corner that's pretty that's pretty cool well look that's so cool you know I gotta say I swear I have seen more dogs and strollers than I have seen babies in strollers people really love their dogs here yeah I love it I love it thank you so that was the Manila Metro Network holy man sometimes you're gonna be very busy yeah but it's actually like pretty smooth like easy to get a ticket easy to jump on board it's simple to use you just gotta be ready to be squashed like sardines yeah but now we are starving and we're looking for lunch and although there are lots of good options around us there is a place that I've been very excited to visit and uh it's not the first for me been there a long time ago but it will be the first vertical I'm so excited those are so cool those are the tricycles and uh we haven't been on one yet uh but they're everywhere I really want to take one today and yeah we really want to get on one I'm hoping we can also Nicole just told me that the guy on the tricycle did one of these a very classic Filipino in fact I have lots of pictures of me like six or seven years old you know buds yeah first coming to Canada doing this what is that I don't know why we do it's just one of those things this is very Filipino don't laugh at me I'm doing that we should make that our thumbnail There It Is I've been waiting like years this is the legendary Filipino Jollibee one of the most popular if not the most popular fast food chain in the Philippines I think their specialty is like mostly fried chicken and rice whatever you want okay but there's spaghetti and other Filipino good foods like Filipino style spaghetti it is super good I've always wanted to eat a job it's been a long long time over ah it's almost over years I'm learning so much about Mikko so one of the things that you can buy here is rice and a burger patty and he used to do this at home we'd have leftover burgers and he would just cook up rice and just have the Patty with the rice and I'm like what are you doing I never knew that I stole that off from the jollibee's menu it's in your blood it's in my blood I guess I thought it was just my own concoction because I wanted some mean rice I'm pretty sure this is rice oh yeah it's rice I actually thought it was like a little burger patty I saw people getting on like a burger patty and chicken that's a lot no it's rice just to be clear I'm pretty sure you can yeah a burger patty and chicken oh great game that actually smells amazing do I use these really okay it feels very strange to eat fried chicken with a fork and a spoon but here we are I assume I assume I'm supposed to put some of this on here right how am I doing are you still doing good all right oh my God it's very good it's like elevated KFC that is really good gravy what if we get fried chicken Amigo's family we buy KFC but then in my head you get KFC and Fries but they always made rice and we had cabs in rice now I get it this is where that comes from it's a beautiful thing fried chicken and rice now Nicole finally gets guess where it's coming from I understand it took years but we're here oh that was great it was so good this is so good right now I would say that they should put up a Jolly Bee in every corner of the city and every street corner but I think that's already happened because there's jollibee's everywhere so good it tastes like home all right so we're gonna try the spaghetti now the spaghetti is like very different in the Philippines it's not like the spaghetti we would get in North America or Europe the spaghetti sauce is a little bit sweeter than you would expect and my favorite although not Nicole's favorite but they have like small pieces of hot dogs in it yeah okay you're gonna try this bite because I won't eat hot dog oh my God we're good I don't eat hot dogs so we're gonna just try the so exactly how my mom used to make it sweet spaghetti sauce uh hot dogs a little bit of cheese that was very good it's really sweet I think I gotta love our time here all right we finished our Joby lunch that was amazing I feel like the time just like disappeared like all that fried chicken made us a little bit sleepy honestly I'm actually quite tired but we just crossed the street and we're now at Rizzo Park and it's a beautiful Green Space really big Park uh there's a very famous Filipino man Jose Rizzo we'll talk about him more as we get to the Bane statue but the park was named after him and right now it's just a really nice walking area lots of people around it looks like there would be I think a fountain here like there's a big water just like turned on there I wish it was on I bet it's beautiful maybe there's a cool light show or something that we don't know about maybe all right as we make our way to this statue I thought it would take a second to share our impression so far of the Philippines well I guess kind of really only on manila but so far so we got out of the Philippines and I have to say a few things so I love that here in Manila we're very lucky in that most people speak really good English I didn't know if it's common knowledge but Philippines has two national languages Tagalog like Filipino and English so here in Manila especially everyone speaks English which is a real treat very easy to get around yeah it makes it very simple I also love that like as a female traveler I just feel really comfortable here I get to wear what I want I could just I don't it doesn't matter how I look I fit in and no one's like no one's giving me lots of stairs just like looks of curiosity but uh no more than any other person that is really lovely however holy man traffic yeah traffic could be crazy yeah and besides that I'm just like I love the people hey yeah it's like everyone's friendly and kind really polite really polite I think that's a great way to put it I love that people are so plate like you walk on the street and you're in each other's ways they're like make effort to get out of your way and they bump in you they're like oh I'm so sorry I'm so sorry so in a lot of ways it actually feels very similar to home in Canada that way like people are just really conscious of like this space they're taking up and how they're imposing on you it's really nice what I'll also say about walking around this park I feel like this is probably the only place in the world that maybe just maybe I might find a statue of a prominent figure that might look like me we made it to the original Monument I would say it looks like you I don't know maybe he's got really high cheekbones he looks pretty nice he could be an uncle maybe maybe so he is a very very cool guy there's some signs around here we've been doing some reading so he is a what was the word you used Patriot oh political activist political activist I liked this in the late s uh particularly when the Spanish were still colonizing Philippines so the Spanish were here from like the s to the very late s so this guy was actually killed for treason against the Spanish in and what is really cool is Philippines actually gained independence in so his death was one of the big things that really sparked a huge part of the movement and to get out from under the Spanish also what is really cool to me about this particular uh like sculpture is that his the remains of Rizzo the guy Jose Rizal actually moved here and they're under the statue they're moving in . wow I know right the statue's been here since the very early s so we're entering just about to enter like the walled City here which is called intramurals intramurals um but anyways there's this beautiful garden we're like oh let's walk in there and the guards are like harvesting mangoes from the trees here whoa hey you see that that was caught it wow we've made it to intramuros intramuros I said it right I always forget the words which is like uh walled City uh in Manila it's a very old city and it was built by the Spanish built by Spanish in the s and I guess it was meant to be like their political capital of Asia like the Spanish Empire's political capital of Asia so nowadays it's just like a beautiful place to come around because of colonial buildings like they're very beautiful here yeah there's lots to look at the architecture is really neat it's like their Spanish home Basin they've left over left all the buildings behind and now they're all bars and restaurants now they're all bars restaurant and cafes which is all right churches and then and there's a massive Church huge beautiful church right here I don't know the name but we're gonna see if we can find out but yeah it is uh it's just nice to walk around intramuros and gonna feel for the very Lively atmosphere atmosphere people are walking around taking lots of photos drinking coffees very nice all right so we're inside the Manila Cathedral now and it's a beautiful Church it is very well decorated at the center at the very front there's like a very gorgeous Statue Of An Angel it looks really really nice fun fact to know about the Philippines a lot of people are Christian I think it's like Roman Catholic is a religious base and then I think maybe another is like other variations of Christianity and then the rest of that is like Hinduism Muslim very cool foreign just like that we are in Fort Santiago which is like within intramuros it is like a what do you call it like a fort so it's like a stronghold um that the Spanish built soon after they like built and declared Manila a city they built this every every good walled City needs a port right yeah it's easy to get into though not very big defenses just pesos each and we're inside the Fortress it's beautiful lots of Green Space beautiful very easy way to go for Spanish weren't in a country is if they have a plaza de armas the plaza thought of us are we back in South America I feel like I'm suddenly transported to like I don't know Cuenca or something just like that we're at the water just get popped out right the water here Nicole would like me to point out that there's a guy on a boat very excited about it and she's very excited about it this spot is actually really cool because I can see like across the river there's like this obviously residential area and I can like see a bunch of guys playing basketball which is a big deal in the Philippines and like lots of very tiny little houses along the river here I think that is something that's been really interesting about Manila as we go around there are obviously like really rich places like BCG where we were earlier today the GC Mika says like we were earlier today and then there is also a lot of poverty here here in Manila and I think seeing like small areas like that with houses just kind of over on the river it's a small little piece of that so you definitely can find both here while we're at the end of the fort I think this is probably the best place to end the Vlog I actually learned a lot about Filipino history and culture as did I it's really cool yeah as did I hope you guys enjoyed coming around with us there's so much to do here in Manila this is just a taste of it we hope you enjoyed it checking out the city with us today make sure you hit subscribe we will catch you guys in the next one thanks for watching I love that part of Filipino culture where singing is like a really big thing it's a very musical cultures because this guy's been training on the karaoke machine you know it's whole life his whole life\n",

      "we're the Lockwoods and we're traveling the world to experience up close and in person all the natural wonders and distinct cultures that our kids would otherwise be consuming only through textbooks and TV we've left the hustle and bustle of BGC Manila and flown down to the beach city of Donsol where we're hoping to catch a glimpse of the glowing trees of fireflies and cash in a rain check for swimming with the Majestic whale sharks of the Philippines but speaking of rain we've had constant showers since stepping off the plane last night so we're hoping to attract a little luck this morning while we wait for our guide let's get to it welcome to Alicia Beach Resort in Donsol it's been an hour and a half drive to get to our Resort from the airport last night waking up here and seeing it in light is refreshing because when we came to check in it's just this dirt road there's nothing paved here so the sidewalks for the resort are just stones and our huts are pretty basic which is very typical for the hotels in this area there all boutique hotels with maybe about rooms but we have this big pool right in front of the beach and all of the rooms are basically beachfront because it's just this little u-shape all of the rooms are the same and none of them are connecting so we had to get two rooms and we are dividing and conquering a girl's room and boys room but they really do a good job keeping everything very clean we haven't seen any bugs in our room and also sadly Colt hasn't seen any geckos in his room no actually of course he found a gecko they have a restaurant on property so that's where you can get breakfast lunch and dinner and you can pay your bill at the end or with each meal service one really important thing to know about this Resort and all the resorts in this area they are cash only so bring a lot of pesos now let's talk Wi-Fi they have Wi-Fi in the restaurant only but since our rooms are really close to the restaurant we've been kind of Lucky and we get a little bit of it otherwise we're working on cellular but this is a very affordable area to stay in our rooms are about dollars per room per night so for our time here we're paying a total for two nights and two bedrooms about US Dollars it's time for the whale sharks we're gonna meet our guide and we have to take this trike to get there all four of us are gonna fit in it okay it was a very short ride it probably took about a minute and a half good morning so we start off with an orientation in here to learn a little bit more about what to expect time to get educated now out of all the phenomenal things you can do Aaron and I didn't bring our fins because they're awkward to pack and travel with for just one little Excursion so we are renting some fins here for a few bucks we already have our masks and snorkels the kids have their full snorkel set so they're all set you have to find the right fit oh look at this guy's helping us out thank you we should point out that there is statistically speaking a better chance that we won't see whale sharks today than that we will and that's because of the way they handle the interactions here in Donsol versus other places throughout the Philippines and throughout the world they do it very ethically they're not going to Chum the water to attract the whale sharks so that means there is a pretty decent chance we'll come up empty-handed but it's really all about the experience so we'll see if we get lucky today I don't know but that is specifically why we chose Donsol for our whale shark experience we wanted the most natural the most eco-friendly it's a risk but we're doing it because this is the kind of experience we want and if you want that experience too that's why we're showing you we're with Janelle he's gonna be our guide the rest of the way and in the water with the whale sharks hopefully but we're headed to our boat over here really wish us luck press that like button help us out with some good energy in the air and hopefully we can see some of these sharks these whale sharks they are this we're gonna be circling this area and we have three hours so if we don't see any whale sharks within those three hours no luck we're just going home without it but until then we are just waiting and circling so if you've been following our Channel some of you may know that when we were in Cebu last fall we had one of these excursions planned for the south of Cebu we ended up canceling that and instead opted to do the street food tour in Cebu City if you haven't seen that episode you can click up here to add it to your queue besides the fact that it was about a four hour drive from Cebu City where we were staying at our Resort down to where that was and it seemed like a really really long day we also decided that the information that we had heard about Donsol and the way that they interact with the whale sharks here was preferable to the experience that we would have had in Cebu it's almost guaranteed that you're gonna see a whale shark when you're in Cebu they throw Chum into the water to attract the whale shark so if that's what you're into it's the Boo and oslob is the place for you but for us we are risking it and that's okay with us because again like I said we're looking for the more natural experience for our family and at the end of the day worst case scenario is we have a three hour tour on a boat which we've paid over a thousand dollars to do before in various parts of the world yeah it's raining a little bit here and that takes away from a little bit of the enjoyment maybe but it's still beautiful water in a beautiful place so life could be a whole lot worse if you're wondering where the kids are they are down below here eating some snacks might as well eat some snacks while you're waiting for whale shark hopefully our luck is turning already the weather is clearing up a bit it's much nicer out now and we've got a guy Up on the Roof looking for whale sharks for us he'll be the first to spot them this is such a good lesson and perseverance or a grit because it's here with all of the rain it's it's coming in again the little chunk of blue sky that we had there for a few minutes is gone it's now grayer and Rainier than ever and it's just coming in sideways it's cold the kids are in there it'd be so easy to just say I don't think we're gonna see anything today let's turn the boat around head back and do something a little more fun playing the pool or something but always that chance so we're gonna stick to this even if it takes us three hours of standing in the rain and it's a little chilly this is not what we expected when we first signed up but it is what we expected as we got closer to the day knowing that the weather wasn't going to cooperate it's pretty much rounded up and we're coming up empty-handed unfortunately very unusual for our experiences we almost always luck out that's just the way the cookie crumbles sometimes so we're gonna get back in here probably get dried off and do a little local experience of some sort and get ready for our nighttime Firefly river tour on the plus side they are delivering us right to our Resort because we're right on the water and I guess we're just gonna get as close as we can we might need to get a little bit wet Colt fell asleep on some fishnets so come here buddy you can just head right on up there honey thank you it feels really nice out now it's not even raining here yeah but that's you know when it comes to Nature it's always unpredictable and that's what we love about it it's always changing you know Nature's a fan of our Channel always be changing one of the great things about where we're staying is that each of the room units has its own bathroom and that is not always the case for some of the hotels or Resorts that they have along this strip also they have hot showers it felt so good get warmed up and we were thinking about having lunch a couple doors down at Barracuda but since it is raining on and off we're just gonna stay here and have lunch at Alicia now it's raining so much you would think that it's the rainy season but it's not this is unusual weather for this time of year beautiful Alfresco seating by the water and I got be cool Express which is a local dish and it is meat green beans and some peppers that is delicious and very spicy the meat's really tender but the sauce it's cooked in is so delicious it's like a coconut sauce with a beef broth kind of a taste it's really yummy and I got some chicken curry I'm starving and it looks fantastic big potatoes in here I'm almost as excited about these as I'm about the chicken that's really good curry oh so these are um not like little chunks of chicken that you would just eat out right there actually still bone in so I have a little bit of work to do with mine but it'll be worth it because this is really really good I'm very impressed for such a small town and a small restaurant this is part of a tiny little Resort this food is so authentic and delicious now we're off to town we have to hit an ATM because we need more pesos we have to check out tomorrow and then we're doing our Firefly Tour on the river that is guaranteed we're not worried about that not happening today we're going to explore the downtown donsil area a little bit here this totally reminds me of our street food tour when we were with June in Cebu City walking around this is definitely a local hangout maybe we'll even find some balut in here I don't know but we're kind of exploring an indoor market right now it's starting to rain outside and can we just say again how crazy it is that it's raining as if it's the wet season even though it's not the wet season but it's just raining off and on and off and on I think that a lot of the dollars that come into the city are from the whale shark swimming until that wasn't even a thing it was just a sleepy little seaside village but scuba divers discovered the whale sharks here in .\n",

      "now it really reminds me of a loot if we were here longer we'd probably do another food tour but we only have about minutes I have to say I want to point out how awesome my hair is in the humidity that is the best part about humidity we are off to the fireflies okay we are here and it sure got dark on the drive over I'm excited about this I think it's going to be beautiful I'm glad that this is guaranteed it's so Charming the people here in donsil are so kind they are so nice I love this community and I I feel really bad that the whale sharks weren't there today uh because I really want to sell you on this community and help their economy and and come here so I know they're going to be there for you this rain just won't give us a break it is just as soon as we got in the boat it started down pouring and I think we might be having a little trouble with the boat literally said that the fireflies were guarantee it's less than that nothing is guaranteed but take it in stride and laugh it off okay three go we're clapping because the fireflies will respond to the Noise by lighting up more there they did it they twinkled up a bit more it's really pretty to see the fireflies in the trees and then go right into the sky the stars are out already it's a beautiful night who'da thought after that downpour we just had this guy is clear and we can see the stars so Ryan's built right there there are over species of fireflies in the world only one here in donzo and it's the smallest species it's about a half a centimeter long it's about half the size of the fireflies where I grew up in Indiana in the USA these are also very small like golden color as opposed to the the black ones that we had when I was a kid we're getting a little quiz we're supposed to guess how can you tell if it's a male or female my guess was that maybe the lights in the front for a boy and in the back for a girl and Phil and Brooklyn say that the male's light is brighter that's a pretty good guess Colt what's your guess I'm gonna think of the easiest explanation for this which is the females have a brighter light than the males we notice there are fireplaces keep on flying around the tree and there are fireplaced so just staying in the tree right so those fireflies that active in flying those are the male fireflies and the females are the one that is just staying in a tree and continuously blinking let's say that they are the lazy one female fireplace are lazy one even though from afar it looks like these are just all the same color of Lights there are four different shades or tints or tones there's yellow there's a pale red there's a bluish and there's a green and I can close up you can really see that but from far away you can't our new question is how many eggs do we think that each female Firefly can produce my guess is uh three a hundred or two hundred oh six to eight thousand each of the female Firefly they can produce an approximately eggs and on the can survive so almost a hundred Brooklyn got it right and during low tide is when the females go down and they lay their eggs in the mud they also kind of live together and cluster around the same tree like they have a home and they all stay around that area and the neighboring family will be next door and they kind of stay in their own territory but they might mix a little bit did I get that right they cannot mix at all they stay in their own territories so they have their own little homes and no mixing despite Mother Nature's Best attempt to keep us from all of our activities today uh we succeeded perseverance and grit and at the end of the day we got to see these beautiful fireflies it's a beautiful evening the night is still young we're not ready to call it quits we heard some good things about this Barracuda place down here restaurant bar just a couple of resorts down from our Alicia Resort so we're going to stop in here have a little dinner maybe a couple of cocktails the path to get here is super super muddy it's just off of the road and I think we've got to be close to the beach though it's not mud anymore it's sand now wow and lovely little porch seating and I know Phil's got his eye on this board over here with all the cocktails listed and Aaron's going to be very interested in the food menu with some really fresh Seafoods jack fish Barracuda of course Sashimi tuna calamari and they do pasta here so you can get a Bolognese or a pork in vermu what are you thinking baby oh I've got my eye on those prawns all right yeah I'm definitely diving into the margarita because Juliet said it was strong and that sounds good to me fresh squeeze juice and it is strong Juliet is a who this is her place and she is Filipino but she actually lived overseas for decades she was in Europe for years doing Chef work the United States for years I think she said her husband is German but she's a real character we're gonna have to eat fast monkeys are tired we are so close to the water it's pitch dark so we can't even see it but you can hear it and actually right up here at the very end you can see the little white caps as they break on the beach I think we're like feet from the shore it's gonna be beautiful during the daytime anytime you go to a new like Beach Town especially your friends tell you oh there's this one place that you have to go to and I really get the sense that here it's Barracuda and it's because of Juliet she's a fantastic Chef so if you come to Donut Soul definitely come by Barracuda I am such a happy camper these prawns are ridiculous they're ginormous they're like little lobsters they're so big I'm gonna be stuck by two prawns and Phil got the pork in vermouth and cream sauce this is delicious wow Juliet is the real deal and it's like the little places here nobody would know about unless you actually come here and stumbled upon it well we're telling you about it so when you come to donsil you got to get to Barracuda we're going to take our time oh the head fell off we're gonna take our time and really enjoy this dinner this is the best prawn I have ever tasted she put like a garlic rub on it it is the best flavor prawn I've ever had good night my favorite part of the locals here is probably Carmel she offered me her sweater and hat to stay warm gave us a bunch of snacks for the boats and lots of cuddles you know how much you love cuddles my favorite memory of the locals here was when I was trying to open up a coconut and they came running out with a butcher knife to help me I really enjoyed talking to Juliet last night learning about her her life in Europe and in the US and then here in the Philippines and she's had to struggle through so much earthquakes and tsunami and she really cares about this community and her food and it really shows in her food every tsunami do you mean by tsunami I meant typhoon I'd say my favorite memory is from walking downtown last night and just going past every little group of locals every little street food vendor every little retail establishment and getting really warm smiles from every single person you can tell that they're just very happy to have tourists here experiencing the local flavor and I think we all just nailed it like we can swim with whale sharks all around the world in the coming months but don't Seoul Hospitality that can only be found here it's family focused from our resort to the whale shark trip to the river tour these things were literally provided by passionate husbands and wives brothers and sisters working together to provide a welcoming experience for visitors who come in search of Adventure it's a testament to the Integrity of the donzo community the same compassion that we've experienced as guests is reflected in how they treat nature I mean this is a place that just years ago had no real tourism industry and once they realized what they had they chose to build it out the right way to focus on responsible ethical conservation and that's the real natural resource of donsil not the wildlife but the people we may have come up empty-handed in the search for whale sharks on this particular visit but we're leaving with Full Hearts for the privilege of spending a few magical days with another community of inspiring Filipinos but now we have to say goodbye as we're off to chargao hit that subscribe button and come along with us for more Philippines Magic we are the Lockwoods Erin Phil Reagan Brooklyn and Colt we're traveling the world to experience up close and in person all the natural wonders and distinct cultures that our kids would otherwise be consuming only through textbooks and TV we think it's a better way to learn and we're working hard to fund this little experiment in the hope that our kids will grow up wiser Kinder and more grateful for the beauty of our diverse planet and its people\n",

      "it's very hard for fried chicken to be fried chickening hey guys I'm Jian and today we are trying each other's Jollibee orders Jollibee is McDonald's if Filipinos made McDonald's and to think that is here in London in central London is mad Jollibee is known for their Filipino spaghetti and chicken so so yummy and crispy for me it's something which I grew up on it's something that reminds me of visiting family in the Philippines just full of joy I normally have Jollibee probably like every week every Sunday after church you know it's just part of our routine if you go to Jollibee and don't go for the chicken Joy then I just don't ready so mine is a two-piece chicken spaghetti chicken gravy loaded fries and peach mango pie someone's hungry that's a lot this is somebody who can eat what stands out to be the most is chicken noodle fries I actually didn't think this was a thing this is kind of like poutine I know this is weird but I don't actually have gravy with my chicken I just eat it on its own like this because I think it's it's tastier on its own chicken is always amazing but you know I'm bummed because this chicken is better with ketchup some people think that's weird but chicken and ketchup I think is a better combo than chicken and gravy I think the gravy is essential for when enjoying chicken Joy just eat it with the spaghetti at the same the same home even the presentation is nice I like how they've laid it out all the frankfurters are facing up we may as well just put the Filipino flag over the spaghetti we've taken over from the Italian sweet spaghetti with hot dogs is the best I grew up in the Philippines with with having much so every time my mom sends money from abroad my dad would treat us to Jollibee and I would always order this Filipina spaghetti one thing which I am morally against loaded fries just as a concept I disagree with it I think if you like it you're probably a child we have to put that gravy just over the top like look at this I know how I feel about that it's just a lot it's very tropical very Filipino pineapple juice is actually really effective at washing down the taste of those fries the highlight of any meal is the dessert for families meal right here it's it's just a bit of a mess I would give this meal a out of . I would give this a seven the school I give this is a three out of ten my Jollibee orders two Jolly hot dogs a yum burger fries and a Sprite two very different my normal overdose okay I've lost for words I've lost my words this has to be a joke no one orders this this is just common hot dog common chip and common Burger you'll go for the chicken joy and you'll go for the spaghettis something that you don't really get in other restaurants in London I'm not too sure how you would start this meal like would you start with a burger would you go in for one of the two hot dogs I don't know if this is because it's in the UK you're a lot more generous with the bread in the Philippines it's a flat pancake like you know it hasn't been exercising hip thrust or nothing it's a thick hot dog it's quite long as well but we leave it at that this is a heavy meal I'm like three bites in and I I I don't think I could seriously finish two hot dogs it's just a little bit a little bit too much frankfur for one day for me it's giving uncultured because Javier not getting chicken Joy or the Filipino spaghetti you're going for the dry dry two hot dogs and you're going for the burger let's see what that fries are saying kind of like McDonald's fries I don't know why you would pick Fries over rice I think this combination as a whole is isn't very adventurous do you know what actually I'll give this oil this uh strong three I would give this a out of .\n",

      "my Jollibee orders are Filipino spaghetti spaghetti spicy fried chicken uh Yum Burger and a coke oh nice this is literally all the OG stuff from Jollibee Philippines right here I mean I'm a definitely like the young burger and yeah chicken I think I'll enjoy it I'll enjoy it I like the variety we have spaghetti which is yes the only thing is it's just lacking a little bit on those sides a little bit more carb I mean the spaghetti but like I want some rice maybe even fries I'll settle for but I mean I think all in all I'll enjoy this meal it's just not gonna be full for me I love the spaghetti and Jollibee it's sweet there's cheese there's sausages there's nothing like it I grew up with the spaghetti for me as a kid like if you said spaghetti I would think of Frankfurt a sweet tomato sauce and cheddar cheese I'm Gonna Leave the burger to last because that's my favorite part so now I'm gonna eat the chicken oh wait do they have gravy so I'm just gonna be eating this dry I don't even know where to start oh it's a spicy chicken okay I see why I'm a chicken skin fan if they just did orders where you can just order the chicken skin that is me I like the spice and that I don't really go for the spicy one just because I like the original taste I don't really know what it is about the Yum Burger but this sauce that they got going on here is incredibly unique for me it's too much bread if I were to eat it I would take off the bottom bun and just make it a double way better than all the other bags I've had Jolly Beef should change the tagline to world famous hamburgers it's got all the originals all the ogs it's just missing a little bit of the sides and desserts that would have made it amazing first I was . now I'm like snow gravy I think this person's an all-rounder because we got spaghetti then we have a chicken and then we're moving to a burger in one sentence this order is don't judge a book by its cover I'll give this out of ten I'm gonna have to give this a seven out of ten I give this order my order is two-piece spicy chicken Joy meal with rice and gravy one Yum Burger one mango peach pie for dessert and a coke oh wow okay it's giving classic it's giving Filipino with the rice I really like this combo it's very similar to what I would order the spicy chicken stands out for me because not many people order it when they first released this I wasn't really sure how spicy it was gonna be I thought it's going to be like lame spicy but it's actually good spice chicken and rice combo is and the gravy yes you know what whoever ordered this order is like my favorite person now so thank you so for this rice we're gonna do it the traditional way we're gonna use our hands because you kind of hold it like this and you kind of use like the thumb to just push it in so here's the right I'm really enjoying the rice it's just normal rice I know I said I don't have the gravy let's see you might change my mind with this um let me try this young Burger it don't even look like the pie is in there I don't understand why you have to add the burger to this meal but this in itself yeah earlier I said everything needs to be dipped in the gravy I had just a really smart idea the best burger in the world and the best gravy in the world I think this person loves Jollibee a lot they know what they want from Jollibee and I'm sure they order this all the time I love like having all my starters and Mains and just a Savory but after having Savory you need something sweet and this is just perfect remember I said dip it in the gravy no I'm joking let's not do that I give this a day I would score this a strong eight out of ten so the score I'm giving this is a out of because not gonna lie they have every component that you need in a meal me that's cool I think people just appreciate the Finer Things in life you know sometimes you just gotta be simple go with like you know the classic Tito's order I lost nah I didn't they don't have good taste that's what it is if you really like this video don't forget to like And subscribe and just watch the rest of our videos because they're amazing\n",

      "good morning or good afternoon wherever you are and welcome to a new production series here in Cebu so we arrived in Cebu yesterday and it's super exciting because finally daytime because night time we couldn't see anything but as you can see we have big loads of laundry and this is probably our whole wardrobe of our in our luggage so so super heavy but I'm carrying all in one backpack and I don't feel my arms anymore because I don't feel the blood flowing in so heavy but anyway it's okay that's okay baby anyway we heading to our laundry place and it's around five minutes away and then after that oh someone close close our way out anyway this is Cebu so you can see it's not so much different from Manila at first impression because you can see many cars many motorbikes as well but the only thing is I'm not seeing any jeepney I'm actually not to sure if you guys can hear me because it's to go out here with all the traffics but anyway we're slowly walking to our laundry place and then after that we'll keep walking and we're gonna find some groceries because we've actually got a permanent place now here in cebu so we'll be staying here for one month we need to buy some groceries to stock up our our kitchen so anyway without further ado let's head over to the laundry wow I keep giving this so what's different about this in Manila what do you think more or less the same yeah yeah traffic's okay. I think I can drive bike here, you think you can drive motorbike here but yeah I for me I feel like it's more or less the same more or less the same many cars maybe more more motorbikes here maybe more motorbikes here and I guess last night when I was walking when I buy food last night I noticed there are many Angkas Angkas bike yeah remember the ride sharing app there are many many yeah like a taxi so here in here in Cebu there are many Angkas so Angkas if you guys don't know it already it's a ride sharing app specifically like motorbikes whoa what's going on here crazy crazy and here in uh cebu or manila the philippines I like driving bike, I want driving bike instead of walking yeah?\n",

      "See you later alright so that's one thing taking off our list so laundry is ready laundry is ready so because we have a big load of clothes just then so it's pesos which is around so this is the thing we've been calculating converting a lot of currencies because we travel a lot so we went to you know Thailand recently so we've always used Thai baht as a reference and also went to Indonesia as well yeah but for me I no need conversion because Russian money is exactly the same like a Filipino money yes it's very easy for you yeah then for me oh but I don't know how it is in dollar only in Russia I know guess it's okay price for laundry you think so yeah okay yeah she uh also next time we can wash by ourselves yeah but today we need to go to market exactly because I'm so hungry today morning we have so bad situation with food Panda we ordered food but they only bring us half the food. exactly that's the thing about food panda because food panda you know normally for service customers always right but food panda is always the seller is always right even though if for example just then we ordered chicken with rice and it's a whole chicken with two rice we ordered but then they only send us the chicken with no rice and we said wait wait our order is not complete we don't have rice and it's like sorry there's nothing we can do and trust me we're doing our best already so it's a bit ridiculous but anyway that's the situation with food Panda yeah because I'm so hungry because I didnt eat this chicken I want only just rice so now we go to market and buy many products buy many fruit many veggie and i will cooking russian food at home yes first time trying Alina's cooking actually for me so... be careful. back to talking about currencies just then the thing about uh one Australian dollars is equal to pesos so it's super hard for me to calculate but if you think like Thai baht then Thai bahts is actually half of Philippine Pesos and Australian dollars is one australian dollar equals to thai bahts that way it's easier for me to calculate and understand how it works but still a lot of quick calculations and maths just need remember like peso how much is Australian dollars wow I don't know three or four dollars I think three or four Australian dollars yeah yeah but anyway we'll put the calculations yeah it's two dollars huh really yeah one dollar it's uh . one dollar is pesos oh true it's two to three dollars you're right Australian is dollars I think she's better at maths than me or maybe I'm just bad it's normal dollars not australian okay right.\n",

      "Yeah for one week for one week yeah so many many food like spaghetti like you know meat and everything but now we're heading back and another thing it's like catching um transportation here in the Philippines it's actually quite relatively more difficult I believe because um for example we called like grab called like Joyride it was so hard for us to find any rides around here and the traffic isn't see we're stuck in traffic jam at the moment and so everywhere you go there's heavy traffic and I think best option you want to go around yeah big traffic big red line that you can see so the best way to go around Philippines I think sometimes if in Manila or even in Cebu it's where we go buy motorbikes sometimes and yeah it's probably a good thing that you know how to ride motorbikes and you get around later yeah justin so bad at riding motorbike.\n",

      "right now we are in Makati in Manila, the capital of the Philippines actually Makati is the financial center of the philippines many people they travel for business or even for holidays they stay in Makati that's why we chose to stay in Makati but it is so close to Greenbelt Greenbelt is one of the main attractions in Makati and we are going to check it It is near Christmas and there is a Christmas tree. if you haven't watched the previous videos go and check it, we have been in different part of Philippines and I think Makati is totally different from any part of the Philippines It is modern with high buildings but the other cities like Coron or Cebu we had different experience go and check it We were diving and as you can see I am a bit sick and I was suffering from flu I got better but I still am not hundred percent back I want to use my time in Makati, so let's go here there is no zebra crossing and we were watching other people how they cross and they just cross like this and we should do the same we found out that in Greenbelt there are various options of restaurants You can find Filipino's food or even international food and I found a Persian restaurant it is also good for shopping and the environment is really nice. It is so beautiful and now we are out of Greenbelt and apparently we are on a bridge we are going to another mall I like how they built this place It is so cool and fun though I think you're going to another mall You know when you go a mall in the Philippines or any indoor public places like hotels you should pass through security gates I think this is the case in all the Philippine We also experienced this is Cebu we were walking inside the Greenbelt and actually found the fun part of it we are trying to play some games these cows are so cool. actually the first time I saw them I didn't realize that they are just artificial and for your safety don't climb them I'm going to see if she is scared of me or not as I said there are many options here to have food and even not just food, coffee or anything since it is launch time and we are hungry we just chose randomly a restaurant to eat it looks cute and they had pasta, Pizza, salad, seafood and a lot desserts. we ordered pasta but this pasta I never had it before it is made with Dory fish I had pasta with Salmon but never had it with Dory I am going to try it here Bruno is lucky that he got his pasta which is a smoked salmon pasta with the cream I don't know why I didn't get my food I think the guy brought the food gave my foot to another table yeah I got my food I'm going to try and see how it it's really good it's with saffron it was worth waiting Bruno!\n",

      "this did not go to plan when i was like it's going to get real bad it got real bad today we are in the biggest mall in the philippines and the third biggest in the entire world the mall of asia so apparently this mall is so big it has over visitors per day yes per day this mall is so big that it has the biggest ikea in the world and an arena that holds events and concepts let's go have a look so my name is josie welcome back to my channel or welcome if you are new here this mall is so big that we're already lost and we've been here for two minutes so i think that's to give you a little bit of an understanding of how big this place actually is okay so for the last six months since i've been in thailand and singapore i've been searching for a dyson era okay there's a dyson stall here so we're gonna check but i don't have my hopes up since they're never in stock let's have a look okay no never mind moving on there's heaps of different kinds of of stalls or shops there's some i recognize from home there's some i don't there's some obviously international ones some american ones so i would probably say that you could find anything that you need here very safe to say so i was wondering why it was so cold downstairs and then i had a look and there's an ice skating rink in this shopping center what do you not have what is not here that is the question there is so many things um no one's on the ice right now it's getting cleaned i think but this is i think on the top level surrounded by so many places to eat as well but i don't know what else there could be what else could you put in a shopping centre at this point okay joke's on me after i said that we walked past and there was an archery range or like somewhere to shoot arrows now what else can they not be in here and laser tag okay well i stand corrected so so i'm walking on this food hall i have no idea where's drinks where's food where's what i am so lost and all i'm doing is looking for a drink there are so many options i honestly kind of want a coffee but i can't see i can't see where one is there's so many people here so it's not option that i can't even find anywhere that i want to go in a shopping center it is massive and it's quite confusing there's different buildings as well what we're going to do is we're going to have our sushi we're going to have our food first because i think we need some sustenance in order to walk around the shopping mall for the next few hours so we're going to try this sushi i've been craving sushi for so long and i haven't been able to find chicken sushi anywhere so they have chicken sushi here let's see how this goes i am so excited to have some sushi for the first time in probably six months the sushi's ready that was really hot all right let's grab the sushi as i don't know what those green things are on the top it's actually pretty good sushi in australia we have this sushi and it's called katsu chicken and it's the crispy chicken inside the sushi roll with usually avocado it is the best sushi ever i know sushi's meant to be fish but that's just my favorite and i can't find it anywhere since traveling so this is pretty close this is just teriyaki chicken with cucumber not the same pretty close though tell me your sushi order in the comments below or if you like sushi pretty good but this is a dish that like i order a lot in australia it tastes really different i don't know if they do it differently over here or something but i still like it it just tastes like less deep fried if that makes sense so those two things cost pesos filipino pesos which is about .\n",

      "Segment 2:\n",
      "in australia so pretty expensive not the cheapest option we probably could have got cheaper options but i saw sushi and i felt like sushi okay so there's a free wireless phone charging station here i'm gonna try it out because i need to charge my phone a little bit so let's see how this works um okay well that's not work actually i might just read the instructions please take care of your phone at all times remove phone kick up remove phone case while charging okay i guess my phone doesn't support it so there's quite a few different like sections of the mall like the malls are all different but they're connected by this like walk over this walk pass so we're just walking to the next one because we don't know what we're looking for at this point there's so many things here but this is a beautiful place down here where we were earlier and it's just got lights looks really pretty but they're all connected by this overpass and the footpath downstairs so let's walk into the next mall and see what's in there so this mall in particular this big one that we're in is like the cyber store the cyber one and it's basically covered in all of these like electronic shops there's cameras phone chargers little oh everyone's trying to get you to buy everything over there there's everything you can imagine sell things like phone sims everything to do with electronics in this one here so we're just gonna head around the back now i guess the water and to see what's on outside i think there's like some kind of like games or carnivals or something like that uh all i want right now is a coffee and i cannot find one because there's just so much around this mall is insane like so insane you do not need anything else this is a one-stop shop that's for sure let's hope i can find a coffee all right well i can't find like a coffee shop coffee shop because there's just too many things here so i'm just going to go into old starbees can't go wrong okay we are stocked up on coffee and we're about to go to the back to have a look at the arcade games and the eye and things like that but before we go anywhere if you're new to my channel welcome take two seconds to press the subscribe button like this video before we go on that really helps my channel let's go have some fun let's go we were walking around for a really long time in there and there was just so much to do so much to see i think you need like literally a whole day if you want to come to actually shop and do things um but thank you we're going across to the side um now where they're going oh let's go over crossing everyone's so friendly so we're gonna go and try and find the big ferret oh this game there's rides and stuff too this is so fun all right let's go have a look what they have here maybe play a few games and go from there but this is cool this is insane there's so many people here and everyone's having fun i see people and little kids and actually even older kids on these two bikes like these tandem bikes as well riding around everywhere there's people playing like basketball there's people eating there's people on this what's that called merry-go-round i think carousel and they're on the bikes there's people everywhere this is really fun this is such a cool activity to do or like something if you want to calm down and just have like a little bit of fun like with family friends like anyone you can play these games and i see a big ferris wheel at the end there so we might actually go on that because i haven't been on a ferris wheel since the london eye about years ago so might want to see the view from the top but this is crazy i can't even begin to describe to you how many people are actually here everyone has like a seat on the cement barrier overlooking the ocean the water everyone's looking out over that way people playing games it's so cool to see like everyone's here with their family yeah whereas like if this was australia you might come with your friends friends probably gonna be half empty most people will be at home but like the whole family's out here like there's grandma's out here there's little kids running around everyone's having a good time it's awesome we're gonna go have a look if we can get a spot on the ferris wheel it's about to literally rain i can feel it starting to spit down so let's hurry and see if we can get a spot on there to sort of stay away from the rain for a while and hopefully have a look out over this water this bay this looks so pretty let's go have a look five i don't think we have enough cash to go on we might quite literally be like one like nine pesos one peso short on going on this ferris wheel are you serious we need one more peso okay so we don't have we're like one peso short going on on the ferris wheel thing it's pesos we have it's per person and we literally have pesos like you actually have two in my hands . we actually have pesos genuinely so funny oh well let's look at it from here it means we can get stuck into some street food instead yeah let's go we'll spend our money on that all right oh hi hi so we're one peg so short to get on that so there's so many rides here so many fun things for you to do just so you know uh bring some cash but that's probably a blessing in disguise so now we can go eat some street food see what they have oh i can't breathe behind there play somebody see what they have maybe see if there's a little games we could play but definitely go grab some food to show you that let's go have a look at what they have that looks like a massive storm or like something over there so we should probably grab some food and leave before that hits unfortunately but look at that that looks that looks like a like a ski like a scary movie can i have this one the temp that yeah thank you okay so i'm gonna go on the drop one um okay it started to like really pour in rain and now everyone's rushing off everywhere and we're all trying to get upstairs and now it's raining everywhere and everyone is trying to get up and we can't there's too many people okay that didn't work that did not work at all i consumed when i was like it's gonna get real bad it got real bad real fast you know what you were seconds away from you were seconds away from being on that while this happened then like what then what final destination you've never seen that movie before i was sitting there and i was like surely they're not sending me up like so there's so much storm now like everything's like being like blown in the wind i'm drenched my camera's drenched we're all trying to huddle under these like we're all trying to hunt away we're all trying to huddle under here just held off from the rain and i guess if it doesn't pass we just go home i guess sorry about i don't want to go if this stays like this how are we gonna get home now all the power's out as well this did not go to plan all right so while we're stuck here and literally can't go anywhere because of this storm um let's just get a little snack from this lovely lady ready an oreo one twenty twenty so i'm gonna try one of these we actually have some similar back when we're in thailand i'll leave the link on the screen or in the description bar below but i think they're like chocolate and blueberry this one's oreo oreo is my favorite i love oreos i'll eat like the tube of oreos to myself all the time so let's have one of these there's an oreo on the inside there's an oreo literally in the middle of the like pancake thick oh that's good okay we're soaked we came inside that wasn't the way that um that was meant to go we're meant to be on the rides and having some more fun but that's cool at least we've got a little bit of a snack there a little bit of street food um but i guess that's all we can really do everyone's running inside my glasses are fogging i can't see but it was fun it's still fun so like i said this is my second day in the philippines so make sure you do like and

      "in this noodle series i have to show pansit which are filipino noodles that so many people love and rave about the way i make it is not traditional but when i served it during our family party during th of july my dad told me it was probably the best bunsen he's tried to be honest making fun sit is pretty easy my recipe just requires a lot of ingredients because i like to have a bunch of veggies and meat in the pan set so that i can serve it as a meal in itself you could simplify it by not adding as many vegetables and meat if it's your first time making it i like to make panset with a little more liquid than traditional pancetta so it's more flavorful and doesn't end up feeling dry i also put lemon or caramel see straight into the bun set because i realized that when i've given bunset to my friends or co-workers in the past they don't know that they should add the citrus into the panset so i just do it for them do you have any other noodle ideas i can try\n",

      "\n",
      "Segment 10:\n",
      "The first strategy: I looked for filipino natives Why did I do that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 11:\n",
      "Because I had just started learning tagalog immediatly after highschool So after highschool, I didn't know how to learn a language. But I was interested in tagalog.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 12:\n",
      "So I searched on google, I told google... How can one learning a language?\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 13:\n",
      "Google said, the first important strategy is to get native filipinos If you want filipino language, look for native filipinos.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 14:\n",
      "If swahili language, look for native swahili.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 15:\n",
      "That way!\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 16:\n",
      "So that's what I did Since maybe I was naive before and didn't have knowledge of the world \"The world of learning language\" So I did what they told me I looked for native filipinos on Facebook as well as on Messenger Because there are many filipinos on Facebook There are things I didn't like in that strategy Like, What will I say?\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 17:\n",
      "There are Filipinos who were impolite to me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 18:\n",
      "There were those who said, you're annoying!\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 19:\n",
      "Maybe I'm annoying because I'm a curiuos and inquisitive person And maybe I had many questions to people who had a busy life Beacuse there are people with kids, family, work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 20:\n",
      "They are busy, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 21:\n",
      "Then YOU, having many questions There i one who told me \"why are you learning Tagalog?\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 22:\n",
      "you can speak English.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 23:\n",
      "Just let it be\" But I learned it But I'm no longer using that strategy because as I said it is not helpful to me It is no longer helpful to me because I don't want dramas Because I'm intoverted and I don't like to be around many people I only did it before because I didn't have any other idea of learning a language But if the strategy is Ok for you, Go ahead and use it. It might not be helpful to me but maybe it will be to you The other strategy is reading I have read many books My challenge here was, during that time my phone was not good for reading and I didn't have a laptop The other challenge was that I didn't have any idea of the book I had to read I read any book that i came across For instance I read advanced book when I was just a beginner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 24:\n",
      "So that was one of the problems Then the other strategy I used is Singing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 25:\n",
      "I love Filipino songs So I really sang and sang Even when I was in the Kitchen, In the washroom or when in the house.\n",

      "I sang Because I really love Filipino music.\n",

      "Segment 28:\n",
      "Why are you like that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 29:\n",
      "I just laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 30:\n",
      "And since that day, she calls me \"a Kenyan with a Filipina heart\" The other strategy is talking That's one of the reasons why we are learning languages You are learning a new language in order for you to talk to another person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 31:\n",
      "Right?\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 32:\n",

      "\n",
      "Segment 33:\n",
      "But it's very important when you talk Ok, it's very important when you talk And the other strategy is listening I have listening to a lot of music, series, vlogs When it comes to mucis I like Zephanie's Chloe's... so many When it comes to series\\movies I like Maja, Janella, Andrea...\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 34:\n",
      "So many Like the \"DARNA' series.\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 35:\n",
      "It's nice And when it comes to vlogs I like Ivana. Ivana's pranks are great I usually listening to them. They are really enjoyable Thank you very much because I always laugh at those pranks Then there are pranks hat will make you cry. They help in learning a language The other strategy I used is mimic Because my ate used to always say She always told me Why are you like that? Why are you imitating me?\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 36:\n",
      "Don't be like that But I would tell her, I'm just like that But she now understands why I did it because she is learning Swahili now She is learning Swahili now So I always imitated When she would say anything to me, I would imitate Like when she says, \"what do you want to do today? I would say the same thing In imitating what she said, I knew something new in tagalog So in all the strategies I have told you I am no longer using only one The one for looking for natives But reading, Singing, speaking, Listening to music, mimic\\imitation; I use all of that In learning Italian and Spanish But I'm no longer looking for natives Instead of that, I use language exchange apps where I look for someone who has an interest in leaning languages Then I'll talk to that person If the person is interested, we will talk.\n",

heal a broken heart I want to see his take I mean it's been requested a lot it might be a really beautiful thing to witness so yeah let's uh hop on over to this this clip and see what's all about you ready no yeah you are nothing like starting off your week with crying tears of joy joy I haven't seen this so let this begin I'm literally already going to start it started off really abruptly are you the girl I told I know the one who prized Me You Love where did it go are you crying already no do broken heart that feels like he never he's really getting after I just can't let go how do you heal a heart that feels like never this again oh tonight I hold what could be tomorrow I pretend to let me go tomorrow I'll pretend to let you go is on dream and now you say you want to leave start and to go words I talk to never say how do you heal a broken heart that feels like keep never be this much again oh no I just let go how do you hear a broken heart that feels like it will never I want to see them pan to the crowd and see everybody crying what could be right tomorrow I prect to finally P it all behind me why find soul and find it I know how to live you go you go how do you heal the broken Heart the feels like this you never this must okay how do you hear the broken hearts that feels like down love this again tonight hold could be right tomorrow I wake me up let all be I know to you guys suck oh my God I want to see what's going on oh holy I know so you could definitely tell that it's a cell phone recording of a guy uh singing to his wife I mean the the title says it all right and uh he's Singing beautifully but I'm not even going to critique his vocal ability or his ability to sing I think he was just singing to his wife he did sing beautifully though he sang he had such a beautiful voice and he sang like with so much heart oh my God I'm not okay I'm not happy right now you guys not happy with you oh my God I mean definitely thank you so much this is a beautiful uh performance we didn't pause because it's just one of those performance where it's not even a performance it's just one of those videos that you just have to sit and watch in all and obviously it broke Taylor so be crying for so long after this I know I'm sorry I mean blame YouTube they're the ones that were commenting this stuff I know I can't believe how many requests we had for this oh do you want your heart to physically break inside and like you spend your last minutes on Earth crying your eyes out go watch this and it's such thanks you guys at a funeral it's such a beautiful display too right like the flowers the the whole the coffin I don't know why I'm thinking like wow that's a nice coffin well I know you said like you wanted the camera to pan so you could see like the crowd crying but I'm wondering if this is maybe something that you know he had like a moment alone like privacy maybe before or after the funeral like with his wife and this was like maybe taken then yeah we don't know I don't know I mean if I was in that crowd live and he was doing that I would interrupt him so many times by my freaking sobbing that he would be like okay I need you out I need you to go I need get out this is me and my wife yeah I feel like this is very like something that you would want to like more of a private moment yeah I think oh my God it was beautiful that destroyed me I do want to nitpick something oh I know one thing that I couldn't get over is why is he dressed like that not in like a tuxedo or a suit for his wife's funeral and then the cynic in me is like is this all staged like did he do this purposefully trying to cuz he could be just singing to a random person person's coffin just to make a viral moment you know what I mean I would really hope not I would hope not too but like you got to think he's not American so maybe it's not in his culture for them like maybe it's not typical for them to dress up a certain type of way for funerals like I have no idea or maybe it's the viewing before the funeral so maybe he just hasn't changed I mean I don't know I would really like to think that this wasn't just for views cuz that's super shitty if it was like one of those viral moment posts that later you turn out is like that's really just the son of the funeral homeowner and he's just like in a random thing singing to it yeah you know I could see I could see someone shitty enough to Stage something like this I'm not saying they did for sure I'm not I can see it as well also if I die first and you don't do something like that at my funeral I know you can't sing like that guy can no offense but I will haunt your ass every single day of your life you'll be dead you won't know I will know I will haunt you you'll be dead you won't know I will haunt you and you're a scaredy cat so I will make sure it is extra scaredy I'm not a scaredy cat yeah anyways you guys thank you so much for sharing this with us um I know it's been requested for like the last two weeks it's been blowing up our channel so sorry it took us so long to get to it um our Queen is very pregnant so we been uh kind of slow walking YouTube a little bit unfortunately YouTube's got to be sacrificed when it comes to this stuff so anyways thank you guys so much for watching let us know down in the comments what you think and we'll see you in the next one bye\n",

they have all of their like plates pan stove forks fridge they have egg eggs you can make your own eggs fruit some fruit and then you have an awesome lounge with this amazing view oh look at the boat can you see it that's cool hammock to lay in suits to sit in amazing view and villa to be in so wait real quick look at the secrets and i jumped in right from up here no you didn't that's dangerous don't do that so that's it for this villa we just enjoyed this one for my birthday but let's head on to the rest of the fun activities that we have we're actually on the way to check into our next place so let's do that and we'll show you the rest of the fun day that we have on boracay island so this is going to be my first time in an e-try you could do it yeah we'll see oh thank you oh thank you thank you so i think we just got a little scammed uh we ordered the we were on the tricycle thing and he just dropped us here but we have to go all the way down there by like a long way so i think he knew that and he just kind of dropped us here and we paid for it but you know what you live and you learn these things happen let's go for a long walk and i have no energy i need a coffee all right let's go i'm holding my shoes okay so it's not even in that street it's a bit further down so oh it's too early for this for me i haven't had a coffee yet all right so we're maybe halfway sure we have to go all the way to the very end basically so maybe he couldn't have got the tricycle down here but we're just pulling all this stuff and yeah oh thank you okay we are still still going i'm tired that's for sure i see the water now yay oh now it's sand this is harder so we just maybe you're playing the sailboat now no thank you we're gonna have some food thank you thank you so we're just going to go grab some food we just checked in to the hotel it's just for one night and then we're leaving in the morning the um room will be ready for us in about minutes so we're just gonna pop along the beach here find something i in case you can't tell have not that much energy today but that's okay we're gonna get into some fun activities this afternoon i'm gonna have some coffee i'm gonna have some monster i'm gonna wake up let's go get some food oh i need food we haven't even had food yet and then we're going to eat i don't know what i'm saying let's get some food this is beautiful that's what i'm saying look at this amazing so another thing i've learned about the philippines is that there's always a starbucks somewhere right on the beach i am not mad about that i do need a coffee um but we're still on the hunt for some breakfast because it's about midday we haven't had anything to eat yet today so okay so i think there's a fan here that you might hear in the video but it's so hot i need the fan um i just want to tell you why i'm really tired today so really quickly uh today last night i stayed up quite late because my first video in manila the first impressions one went up and uh so many of you liked it and subscribed that i hit k and so thank you so much but i was just i was so excited and so happy and like i just was too excited to sleep and i was like staying up i was like oh my gosh i'm so close i'm so close and yeah i hit it last night so that's why i'm a little bit tired it was on my birthday so what a good birthday present so thank you all for my birthday present of subscribers thank you okay so that was actually a really nice coffee and i'm really happy about that because i needed it but before we go out and we do anything else i just want to show you this room so we've just checked into this one we're only here for one night as we're leaving to the next destination tomorrow but i just thought i'd show you the room so as you walk in you have this beautiful room here it's um pretty standard but actually quite nice to be honest you have the desk that we need to use because we both work online there's a desk over here but there's also a dining room chair and table over there as well big bed looks like a king to me not sure what it like feels like actually let's just try oh it's actually quite soft okay that's cool because i like soft beds and then it looks straight out onto this little balcony that you have with some chairs and it has really nice greenery over there as well and then if you come through here around this little room divider you have the bathroom but on this side you have the toilet on this side you have the shower room and then you have the sink right there so this is where we'll be staying for tonight breakfast in the morning and then we're flying to the next place but right now we're gonna go and get like an activity done everyone in the comments in my manila video was telling me to do some uh like water sports on boracay island so we're gonna do that today we just gotta pick which one what do we have they've given us this which ones are they helicopter tour of the island oh how much is that about per person whoa i mean it's expensive but you're thinking what i'm thinking v no i want to do something like like that i can do you know like a helicopter is just kind of sitting there i want to do something if you're new here i broke my back about four years ago so anything with like impact on the water like kind of really scares me so i might be looking at maybe like a stand-up paddleboarding or like a canoeing or like something like that that might that might be a little bit safer um for me to do but let's pick one of them and then we'll head out in a second and show you the beach because we have like full-on front beach access from this resort hotel so that's really cool oh and as always i'm gonna leave the hotels and the villas and everything in the description bar below so we paid well michael paid for this for my birthday but it's not a collaboration i'm just gonna leave them below if you want to stay where we stayed as well okay so i just went down and i spoke to reception and i'm gonna do the parasailing um so i've never done that before and we're gonna go out and parasail over the island boracay island so i'm so excited um it was pesos going through this uh hotel that we're staying in i'm not sure what the going rate is but i'm just happy to have it organized and done um but we're just heading down there now and this is gonna be fun all right let's go let's go downstairs okay so we've just walked up the like laneway to the main street so this is the main street um and i think they're just gonna collect us and take us to the boat or where we're gonna go up i'm not sure um but i do feel some rain so i'm getting a little bit nervous okay we're just crossing the road to head into the car or the truck or the bus that's going to take us to where we go up in the air thank you hi so they've taken us to like the port or like the beach and then they've got a big line thing that goes out to sea there and i think they take us from here to on a boat a speed boat that takes us to like where we're getting on to parasail if that makes sense oh there's so many people out there i don't know if you can see that there's like seven people out in the air in the middle of the ocean okay this is where i tell you that i'm scared of the ocean but what if i fall in i probably can't swim i'm scared so we're just heading out now on the uh boat and i think we're going to where then we'll go up in the thing thank you thank you i got it i love something okay so we're on like a houseboat and obviously we go from this houseboat to this guy this guy okay i'm a little bit scared of the ocean in case you don't know so this will be oh look at everyone on the banana boat look so big booty we saw something like jump out of the ocean okay okay go faster go faster i'm going down i'm going down oh i'm so loyal to the ocean oh my go up go up go up please oh my gosh oh my gosh oh no oh no no go up get up go oh my god oh yeah yeah oh my oh i'm so high up oh oh my gosh i am shaking i'm shaking okay my biggest fear is literally open water in the ocean like this oh my oh my gosh oh my gosh go higher please i was so close to the ocean then oh my oh oh my gosh guys it's like i'm floating in the air but i'm so scared it's i can see like the whole sea below me oh it's kind of uncomfortable in my legs to be honest i'm holding on for literal dear life i think i'm coming back in now i'm going down yeah oh my gosh guys that was so scary but that was so cool oh my gosh please don't let me hit the water don't let me hit the water it's like my biggest fear oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh my gosh oh my gosh my gosh my gosh my gosh my gosh ah guys guys guys guys no no no no no don't do that don't do that oh my god he yelled shark oh no no no no no okay okay i'm okay okay i'm shaking oh thank you i think i have sea legs i said legs in the water and i went all right okay it's just started to rain here on boracay island it was coming through when i was in the water on the parasail but i haven't actually gone for a swim in the ocean yet and we're actually leaving tomorrow to go to another destination in the philippines so i have to go in the water i'm gonna have a quick dip stay in this beautiful water here for a little bit the water is beautiful it feels like quite warm with like a little tinge of cold but not really it's not enough to not want to go in or anything around me okay so we just got out of the water and we're just heading down this main sort of strip on the beach um because a few of you in my comments were telling me that i need to try is it jonas juice spa or something jonas is that right yep so we're going to try and head there and have a juice that you all recommended because apparently it's a must do when you're on boracay island so let's have a look okay so we just ordered our drinks michael got chopped peanut butter and i got pineapple mango so delicious i'm really excited all right so that was a really cool shake i don't normally often have like fruit shakes and that one was really nice and right now it's like the sun has just sort of got down and there's still so many people on this beach on this island so we're just heading back now but there's a massive day here i love the vibes of boracay by the way everyone has so much fun all the time it's just easy going it's the best this is like one of this is such a good island to come to you should definitely come here people will ask you if you want to go on a boat sail ride every two meters but or whatever right but whatever yeah yeah it's cool it's fun so that's it from beautiful boracay island in the philippines what was your favorite part of the vlog let me know in the comments below because mine was probably the parasailing even though that was the scariest one of the serious things i've ever done in my life uh tomorrow is a new destination still here in the philippines but i want you to try and guess where we're going as well in the comments below i had such a great day i loved boracay island i loved having my birthday here as well so that's it for now please like and subscribe if you haven't already and i'll see you in the next one in a brand new destination in the philippines bye you\n",

      "\n",
      "Segment 2:\n",
      "Guys in this video we are in El Nido so it's my first full video and I'm gonna tell you guys straight away that this day is not gone as planned because the weather can be pretty moody when you're out here on the islands, our boat tour was canceled so my brother's actually at the hotel doing a couple of things and I decided I'm gonna take a walk we've got some very dark clouds coming in so all morning actually we were surprised that the boat trip was canceled because it was so sunny but I guess probably some of the islands where we would go to take the boat to like the waves are a little bit dangerous so that's just something you got to keep in mind and if you're on a short itinerary you might be bummed out because you need to have a couple days of leniency depending on when you're here and what time of the year you're here if you want to just ensure that you're not going to have one of your days completely ruined and you won't be able to make it up on a future day because of the weather. So we're like the big thing to do in El Nido besides kind of cruise around explore like the island life is to go to all of the surrounding islands do boat trips, so there's like four different types of boat trips you can do and maybe I'll explain that to you in another video but like you know they're all like full day boat trips because there's so many islands in the El Nido area. So basically unfortunately because we did not get the opportunity to go on today's one that's one of the full sets of islands that we won't get the opportunity to explore. But anyways guys on a more positive note we are here inside the marketplace and we are going to be exploring this area.\n",

      "Segment 3:\n",
      "So we're gonna enter in we've got some markets here Okay, lang. All right very good very good so it looks like we've got ourselves a nice Marketplace over here and inside what can we find it looks like we've got some fresh hats on this side all right some really nice looking hats there but I'm looking for something more that says the Philippines so we're gonna keep looking a little bit more though see what else we can locate inside the markets as you can see they've they're preparing themselves for the rain so we will head on in here we got El Nido shirts in here Okay lang all right okay those looks similar to my uh Birkenstocks I'm wearing right there well I'm Gonna Keep Looking here guys I'm looking for something custom to El Nido most likely but uh yeah lots of swimwear in there a few different types of designer Brands I've seen like Adidas I've seen Nike and uh we shall see what else we see over here oh it's got the shirts hanging low all right some nicer shirts there swimsuits looks like it what do we got there El Nido Beach oh a red horse tank top that's one of their favorite beers around here Palawan so we're on the island of Palawan?\n",

      "no okay Barbies yeah yeah I would do for but that's the most I'll pay because when I was in Manila I bought a very similar pair like this and after four days of walking they broke so I don't know if these will break see for this . okay do you happen to have a change for a and I can try them on real quick try them on yeah all right go ahead and try these on guys they are which I guess is .\n",

      "Segment 13:\n",
      "in the US that's exactly my size Nike Air Max shoes so they do fit nice it feels like kind of like the ton go for a run in these yeah I will take them and uh change please is there is there a way to make the see how that liner comes out is there glue no blue yeah because as you guys can see this is one of my big hesitations because when I bought the shoes in Manila they immediately like kind of fell apart I put my foot in there and took it out seems like those are pretty sturdy but I guess we'll have to uh settle for that quality because this seems to be the the common standard for this um price range well I think we can always find a shoe repair guy to put new Bottoms in because I do like the design I'll change please thank you salamat thank you very much so we are a proud new owner of the shoes so I usually face uh some people who have an opinion where I shouldn't have negotiated the price and some people where they say I should have negotiated in more the reason why I negotiated it because honestly for like a really high quality pair of shoes is a great price right like is probably like $ or something like that close to it fifteen fourteen dollars but the reason why I negotiated down to which is like eight or nine dollars is because I'm literally in Manila and if you guys watch my videos I got a pair of like Air Force Ones there and within four days of walking around and I did walk like four miles but like at the end of the day if it's a high quality shoe you know it should last a while and I paid for those and so as soon as I put these Nikes on already the Bottom's like crunched up and they like broke right off so you can tell they're they're really just shoes more for show they're not meant to like last a long time or beat them up like you would with a pair of athletic shoes which is exactly what those are.\n",

      "it looks like they're building a brand new Spa right there and it seems like a pretty decent sized Beach Grill to the left a nice little food truck right there to the right some good Tunes I'll get some tacos that's one thing I'll tell you in El Nido everywhere you can go you can find Mexican food in the Filipino version not as white of sand as like the main beach in El Nido but like or maybe it's because it's wet at the moment but still a really nice Vibe here a lot of like tree coverage leading up to the beach which gives it more of that jungle feel and one thing I've noticed in the Philippines all around they have like a dedicated smoking area you can't just like smoke outside anywhere have you noticed that too bro that's the first time I noticed it all over the Philippines they have dedicated sections for smokers to go yeah guys so this is another perspective of seeing the area of uh El Nido this is the beach if you remember in the previous video when we were flying in that was the uh that was the dock right there the pier that we were looking out at and the plane basically flew right in there all the way down and landed as we're really close to the airport here oh actually this will be my first time touching the water bro Let's test it out see if it's any good all right oh yeah nice and warm so guys if you want to spend some time at Leo Beach if you got a lot of time in El Nido this would be from what it seems like a good place to spend like an afternoon in there's like shops and other areas that line this way and it's one of those beaches where if you're trying to enjoy the outside yet not get as much of a tan the tree coverage is is perfect for that I mean there's not too many beaches in the world I've seen that actually have like all these different types of trees that close to the beach so it is definitely what kind of sets this place apart and all down there I want to say there's like shops and things want to loop back this way bro so lots and lots of nice like uh cafes here it seems like giving up their smoothie bowls yoga classes and a uh a lot of like places to lounge around good digital Nomad working space to be close to the beach yet also close to a fresh delicious coffee in this area so yeah it's it's really nice guys you obviously been watching from the beginning of this video if you're still here and there's a lot of rain before but it can be moody here the weather and so you know you can just wait around for a couple hours and then well it's not like perfect beach weather right now it's at least not raining so it's still worth coming down if your part of your day gets rained upon and check out what's going on in this area. And I'm not sure if these are like hotels in these areas seems like there's some lounging areas up top bars on the first floor but it kind of has given me that Resort style vibe that first look definitely plenty of options if you've got a few days to do a little bit of a restaurant hopping in the area but yeah guys we only have a couple hours of daylight so we're probably not even a couple hours at this point probably one and a half hours so we're gonna keep cruising on the mopeds a little bit further to what's uh supposed to be an even better like Beach area so knock Pond yeah all right not fun as what is like minutes from here uh yeah nice all right so we'll cruise over to the knock Pong guys and uh you'll get a small little tour with us of today's uh excitement exploring the different beaches in the area good all right we're heading back out this way and looks like we're gonna be going to the uh right let's get this bread all right we're about minutes away and as you can see this is some of the nature here in Boracay more of those beautiful palm trees and just a really wet feeling climate around here I will say I love the island but you're hot sticky and humid all the time during this time of the year I like it because it's Island line been cruising for a bit uh very rural is a better way to say it not too much except more and more jungles but a nice peaceful drive especially now that the sun's coming out.\n",

      "Guys we've got a rainbow in the distance I don't know if you can see that on the camera but we've got a knife rainbow way out there in the distance from making progress we got local Filipino traffic right there is it one back uh over this way and we're gonna take a left we're actually at this house right here at the left of the corner and they told us to go this way so we just retraced our route spent minutes going this way all right all right we have located the beach after uh passing it there it is not fun beach oh it's muddy as hell let's hope I don't crash that's what bumpy ass road going down this way my friends foreign all right it's definitely a more villagey area over here that's a good sign whoa we got the Ducks hanging out here down boy down boy sit yeah this is one muddy ass Road holy wow it's literally sludge oh definitely if you're riding around here go real slow I got my feet on the ground almost what a mission you know which way bro all right we have made it what an adventure all right it's a interesting arrival spot here park the mopeds there right here we've got some really thick barbed wire you think they're keeping like a T-rex or something inside of here it's like the longest barbell I've ever seen so we've got some cows in there a little baby calf right there too and this is going to be the very commonly spoken about Beach that we're going to show you guys we're only up just a little bit of time here because unfortunately with a couple wrong turns and confusion on the directions we only just arrived about minutes before the Sun is setting and it looks like we're hitting a super high tide too from the distance here oh bro I'm thinking about getting a coconut you want one uh your coconuts coconuts yeah can we have two coconut please kuya two fresh ones with the slaughter device there we go chopping that thing right up so this is uh from Philippines coconut yeah locally grown El Nido coconut oh look at that spraying everywhere landu nice to meet you landu oh so we got one Delicious coconut right there oh don't want to get hit with that dagger and all right you're really just absolutely smashes that thing how many coconuts you sell per day what how many coconuts do you sell per day and magkano kuya okay all right oh I got it bro feeds Perfect all right let me just grab this for you brother all right each all right that's uh for you to buy you and your family one extra coconut too salamat kuya enjoy oh thank you bro hey so we've got two fresh are these King coconuts King coconuts all right here we go we're gonna go ahead and test this thing out drink about two-thirds of it right there delish my friends I do love the king coconuts when they're able to get them uh hold right out right when they're like ice cold you know if they keep them in a cooler but honestly this is so refreshing after a solid hour drive here right at the sunset we got a little Misty rain in the distance here but waves crashing a very light sunset in the distance behind that little mountain right there in this couple looks like tourists showing right there so it's really like it feels way more like a local beach than the other Beach we just showed you but still you know like definitely designed for the tourism but like not as like overrun as some of the other places we've seen in terms of like amount of development I just tasted this one and it's got like maybe it's not ripe or something it's got like a soury like bitter app never once had a coconut like that before all right so we're getting to a little Isthmus here as you can see we've got water on both sides coming in here and then coming in here and then we have both sitting right up there in the middle and it leads to this then there's like one little house sitting out there on that island in the distance and a couple more that just surround this just goes to show you like that's how there's like different islands in the Philippines they're just kind of like pop up in every direction you look you're gonna see all these little Islands oh look at this we've got a couple calves right here cruising around the beach pretty good life this little uh car right there is drinking a coconut Yum Yum Yum yeah a little one went for a little run got the Zoomies in them there's my brother's future house right there right yeah no it's a really really beautiful place it looks like it's someone's home hard to tell but yeah gate leading right up to this beautiful palace of a house surrounded by palm trees such a vibe so yeah guys a pretty quick look at the side of the island yeah I'm hoping to visit El Nido again in the future because obviously some of these videos have been pretty fast paced through here and I haven't like fully dove into the culture of things to do and you know everything in there but it's like a nice little highlight both to get me excited and you guys excited when I Explore More of the areas on the island of Palawan but we're gonna head on back we'll see you there kuya yeah brother it was a great time really nice time thank you all right guys and just made it back to the hotel room so as always thank you so much for watching and we'll

you think right there are two reasons the chocolate hills are called the chocolate hills the first reason is everybody says they look like Hershey Kisses and the second reason is in the dry months all the grass dries out and it looks like chocolate recently the hills have been nominated to be one of the seven wonders of the world UNESCO even declared these hills a world heritage site and the government is stepping in to develop the area for everyone to enjoy and just like that we're onto our next adventure I was driving a truck with Hills in the rice field and notice all of these little tarps out with the rice right and our driver said that they they drive for five days so they sit out here for five days to drive so here's the rice right here guys whenever I see these rice fields I always wonder myself how much energy and effort goes into growing and harvesting the rice and how much money can really be made off a bag of rice if any of our viewers out there know anybody in the rice game we would love to have an experience and maybe even make a video with the rice farmer and see how the process works so if you do know anybody comment down below and maybe we can experience it

first session it was also insane just watching the pros do their things with their flips and all their tricks Emilia absolutely killed it out the wakeboarding I think I still need some practice though he did say I was a bit of a pro so I was quite proud of myself it is such a cool sport and we kind of want to do more of it now let's move on to number two and this is probably one of the biggest reasons people come to the island and that is surfing there are so many different surf spots all over Xiao gal right up into the North and also down south there are so many different surf lessons surf instructors surfboards to hire whatever you're looking for you can find it on this island if you're a beginner Surfer or an advanced Surfer there's different waves and different beaches you can go to which will fit your difficulty or whatever it is now number three is an epic sport where you could do big rock jumps and you can chill on the beach it's such a cool spot the name is like I've tried pronouncing this thing a hundred times and I still can't do it so please forgive this spot is absolutely legendary and is so fun that you can only go here at low tide look up on the Internet and look when the low tide is you have to walk around the side of the beach and then you go to these Rock pools and you'll see locals and other tourists jumping off the Rocks into the water and it is pretty deep and the water is so blue and super clear the best way to get to this spot is by scooter and once you get there it's an entrance fee of pesos per person I think there's also a parking fee of like or pesos as well if you want to jump off the Rocks I would highly recommend bringing water shoes because the rock is super sharp once you finish jumping off the cliffs I highly recommend just chilling on the beach is a beautiful beach one of my favourite in Siargao also I don't know how to say Siargao sharagao shigal what is it I'm really struggling here I've said it too many times now the next spot is the palm tree Viewpoint again this is a super popular spot and you can kind of see how many palm trees are on shower girl there's basically a big flat layer in the middle and just gazillions of palm trees it's a cool spot to take an Instagram shot it doesn't take long maybe like minutes there and you're pretty much done this isn't the only spot there are so many different cool tropical palm tree roads a long Siargao so stop off take some photos get those Instagram shots if you don't already follow me on Instagram because that's where you get the live updates for what we're doing and yeah why haven't you already moving on to number five and that is Cloud this spot is super cool and it's basically one of the best surf spots in the world so if you want to watch the pros then you can there's a big broad walk unfortunately last year in Typhoon Odette it actually got destroyed so they're currently rebuilding it but hopefully by the time you get there it's back to what it used to be the waves there are super super large so if you are a beginner maybe stick to the smaller waves but honestly it's such a cool place just a chill on the beach loads of people gather there at Sunset and it's just a great atmosphere apparently to get into the Cloud area you have to to pay a hundred pesos per day per person but that money apparently is going towards building the broad walk also at Cloud Nine you can rent loads of surfboards there's loads of surf instructors if you are a beginner so the next place you have to go to in sagao is the cave pool and this is a much less touristy spot than other spots in shout out and I highly recommend it still because it's super fun it costs pesos per person and that comes with a guide but also you should probably tip the guide on top so this activity goes through a cave and you can actually see Bats inside and then at the end you can do super cool jumps and go on a rope swing this spot is not far from some other spots which I'm going to be telling you later in the video the number seven is a super cool activity which I think is a must and probably one of the top five things you have to do on the island and that is sugba Lagoon this place is like no other it's like Roger ampat in Indonesia it is absolutely beautiful the water is so clear it's just like a cool jungle fill almost like mountains in the sea it's awesome there's also a super cool jump spot where you can go up the dive board we went on a private boat and I think it costs like two thousand three thousand pesos for the private tour I will check that and put it down below you can drive there by yourself or go on a Land Tour which does loads of different spots and that will be a cheaper option for you if you're on a budget we rented a paddle board and paddled around the islands through the water and it even rained and it was super tropical and just epic epic Vibes one of my favorite spots on the island definitely check it out moving on to number eight this activity is one of the only places you can do this in the entire world and that is swim with jellyfish we just got into a Jellyfish lake and we're surrounded by jellyfish which is crazy and no you're not gonna get stung these jellyfish are actually stingless and so you can touch them and they'll literally touch you and you don't get hurt I don't even know why this is true but it is super cool and such a weird experience honestly getting in the water we were pretty scared we were like are they gonna sting but it's all right it's good fun but weird the Jellyfish lake is located in sahoten Cove and so you have to do that as a package tour I'm going to be telling you about southern Cove a bit later in this video right let's talk a little bit about transport and how to get around if you're looking to get around the best way is buy a scooter it just gives you the most freedom and if you want to rent a scooter the best way to do that is to ask your hotel they might rent them themselves or they can point you in the right direction we rented ours for pesos a day you know if you're on a bit more of a budget you can probably get it for pesos a day so if you're not confident on a scooter you can use the classic Filipino tricycles which are super cheap and a great way to get around and again if you want to do the tours you can do land tours and that prevents you having to go on a scooter if you're not confident on a bike don't push yourselves be careful and wear your helmet number nine come eat dinner at Kermit they've got amazing cocktails amazing food and even better dessert you are not going to be disappointed Kermit is a resort and a restaurant and honestly it has some of the best food on the island if you like pizza if you like pasta then you're going to be in for a treat we had an amazing pizza at this restaurant and also we tried like this seafood linguine pasta and it was Unreal I think it might have been the best pasta dish I've ever tried they've also got cocktails Gym Bar they've got a big old Pizza Oven they've got everything so if you like food check it out also if you are into yoga then you should do the yoga sessions at Kermit Amelia did them and said they were super cool with an epic area where you can look over their new pool spot number is a spot which doesn't have many tourists on it and there's two epic beaches near super Lagoon now I'm gonna be honest I don't know how to pronounce these so please give me a break but I'm gonna give it a go for you pamo round Beach which is actually part of the super lagoon area and then Kawahagan Island and these beaches are absolutely beautiful the Kawa Kawahagan island is actually has a sandbar and it is super beautiful super clear blue water and honestly from the Drone it looks even better from both of these beaches you can actually eat and there's a restaurant so you can have a full day there chilling and you can get boats here from the Dell Carmen Port now moving on to the next one number this spot is super super popular it is like the picture of Siargao and the spot that everyone knows about before they go and that is the rope swing to get into this spot it only costs pesos and it is super super fun Unfortunately they don't have the rope swing anymore but they've built this like wooden kind of jump spot and so you can jump into the river but be careful because it is not actually that deep on the river it is super cool just along this River because there's palm trees either side the other thing you can do here is actually get a little boat which is super low to the water and you go to like this secret little Lagoon and once you get there there is like little pigs there to go on the little boat ride to the secret Lagoon it costs pesos for the boat now moving on to number this is a place I promise to tell you more about and this is so Sohoton Cove this place is magnificent but do be warned it is a far away from General Luna I think it took us like two hours to get there and then it's like I think it took us three hours to get back because of the wins and stuff so just be prepared for an uncomfortable long ride on the boat and you will get wet so maybe bring a waterproof bag it costs quite a bit of money especially for Filipino standards and it costs pesos per person this obviously includes everything so all the fees all the transport as it is very far but is well worth it this is where you get to go to the Jellyfish lake which I told you about earlier and you basically go on a little boat tour around the island you also get amazing buffet lunch with so much food you won't be able to eat it all and then you go to a couple of other spots as well we even saw a little Stingray which was pretty cool even though this trip is quite expensive I do recommend it swimming with the jellyfish going around this Raja Ampat kind of area it is so cool and worth the money I'll leave a link down in the description to go on that tour now I'm going to recommend somewhere else that you should eat if you're in Siargao and that is Kurvada's this place is always super busy and honestly when they run out of food they run out of food it's basically like a buffet style place and you can choose so many different food Filipino food but they also do like pasta they even do brownies there is so much choice and honestly I don't know how they do it but every dish just tastes so so good the other great thing about this place it is super cheap and affordable so if you are on a budget as a Backpacker then I recommend coming here now number is not a super cool thing to do but one of the things to do is to just chill out at the end of the day you are on a super chilled surf Island Vibe so if you want to just go to the beach you just want to chill out in some of the super cool cafes get smoothie bowls all day then you can do that don't feel like pressured to always do loads of stuff whilst you're traveling because honestly traveling can be quite exhausting now this is probably the most popular tour to do on Siargao and that is the island hopping tour the Philippines is famous for its island hopping tools that this one is super cool and quite unique so each island is kind of different first of all you've got Naked island and if you don't know no you are not naked on that island it's just bear there is nothing on it but sand is basically a sandbar there's also Daku Island and Guyam Island and highly recommend checking these out because it is cool who doesn't love island hopping in the Philippines having an epic buffet lunch you're gonna love these islands now number is head right up north to the untouristy part of the island once you go past the rock pools on the island there's not as many tourists the locals are super friendly on help you out this island is covered in palm trees and you'll be able to go to beaches and be the only ones on them there's one beach you should check out is that that is Algeria Beach right up the north west north east and then there's also a waterfall which is the only waterfall on the island which we didn't go to but I think you should if you're there for quite a while now number is the last thing you should do in Siargao but I'm actually can just give you loads of tips also there are loads of hostels in shower gown so if you're on a budget there's loads of surf hostels and places you can meet loads of people also don't worry about ATMs there are loads of ATMs on the island also remember shower gal isn't super developed but it is developing fast this is going to be the new Bali hopefully it doesn't go too far because this place is so so beautiful right now but hopefully it won't be destroyed by mass tourism guys if you've got any questions about shout out please leave them in the description and if you live in Siargao or you've been to Siargao please feel free to answer any questions or recommend other things to do on this beautiful tropical island of shower girl thank you so much for watching please before you go before you go just hit subscribe it helps us out to keep traveling sharing these videos giving you advice thank you so much we'll see you in

      "it's been about a week and a half since I've been traveling in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and right before this I came straight from the Philippines and to be honest the first week that I was here in Malaysia I was craving Filipino food so someone actually recommended me to go over to this Filipino restaurant called Mabuhay Laguna Restaurant and mabuhay means welcome I did learn that from you guys so I'm heading over to the restaurant right now it's a Sunday today and apparently they have some type of like parties and celebrations going on Sunday this is also one of the few Filipino restaurants here in kl city apparently there's not too many so I'm gonna go check it out and eat my Filipino dishes so with Malaysia having some of the best food here in Southeast Asia honestly I want to say it should be the food capital of Southeast Asia but there definitely will be a lot of controversy along that if you put the restaurant up on Google Maps it'll direct you over to this this building right here but that is the old location however if you just turn around with the bright colors this is Mabuhay Laguna Restaurant so apparently there's a church around here that ends at p.m on Sundays so it gets kind of crazy so I got here at :am just because I want to be able to get a seat inside the restaurant so they also have rooms here where you can reserve for parties there and here which is cool so if you have like a birthday or something you can reserve here so that's ronny this is his restaurant oh what do we have here this is spring spring rolls what is inside of this meat?\n",
      "\n",
      "Segment 2:\n",
      "what's inside it like beef or chicken pork and that is the sisig sisig is the cheek of the pig is there a big party today?\n",

      "Segment 5:\n",
      "they have some type of functions you know oh this is probably chili I love chili and garlic like the oh this is really good and this is a small little shrimp shrimp yeah this is behind the scenes hi how are you wow is this like every single dish just for every dish these oh this is before adobo and this is for water spinach these are also proper Filipino desserts and snacks here as well it looks familiar oh my gosh there is a balut I don't know if I can have this again this beautiful lady is eating here like a balut balut this is her first time she eat it first time she eat it just just taste the the soup soup first soup first soup just taste the soup the soup it tastes like egg oh my gosh i'm not looking at it so here is also where i guess people come and sing after church service on sundays and already you see people sitting down and in the next or minutes or so I think more people will be showing up oh so the table is also reserved for me salamat po okay so this is the menu literally got a couple of pages here with specialties there's a lot and this place is also really good for families as well you got some silog menu rice egg and noodles I got myself a celery apple juice they offered me beer at first but I was like I could not have beer this early so and they also have a western food menu option as well I'm kind of feeling some sisig to be honest so I might go and order oh my god there's so many things sizzling sisig dang should I get the pork or the chicken okay I think I'm gonna get the sizzling sisig pork I definitely want steamed rice with that oh and they do also have local dishes here as well but I just want my Filipinos dishes as a starter I might also get myself what is this embutido deep fried Filipino meal I might give myself an embutido or so actually all the workers here except for the owner they're all filipino so fyi to that i think they're a little bit busy right now but I'm just gonna wait and then place my order so yes I've decided I will get the sizzling sisig I don't think I've actually had uh a dessert or the starter dessert like an appetizer in the Philippines so I guess the first time I'll have that is here in Malaysia there's also a lot of posters here parking is more fun in the Philippines bananas from the Philippines rocky roads are more fun in the philippines generally I think the point that they're trying to make here is that it's just more fun in the philppines even though i'm not filipino I can just tell that the people here it feels like more of a community and I guess this is where all the philippines hang out on the weekends i do want to order before the crowd comes in here I don't know how many people will actually show okay but let's see ate I'm gonna get the sizzling sisig sizzling sisig pork okay also embutido what is the difference cause they say they're both do you have a favorite like which one is better no what is this one oh tofu okay i will just get the embutido yeah i'll get that oh yeah can i have steamed rice it's exactly :pm right now so church service is over and there's going to be a lot of people showing up here so I'm walking up the hill to go up to the church and I kind of want to see this like all the people coming and how many of them actually will come down over to the restaurant the flock is coming they just ended church service up there uh don't hit me please ah so this is where all the people are coming down from church and it has to be no more than like a two or three minute walk down to the restaurant just right across the street people are coming into the restaurant now but I just kind of wanted to see that see there's already a lot of people who already showed up here and i think that's for me steamed rice and one steamed pork minced pork salamat po thank you I actually never had this meatloaf over in the Philippines before mm it smells good they're getting a little bit busy right now but I need my spices can I get the uh the chili with the garlic and soy sauce yes thank you alrighty so I got all my dishes I got the sizzling sisig with the pork oh it's dripping I want to show you guys and then i got to embutido I've actually never had this before but there's there's a meatloaf uh starter here so I got that and of course my rice and I did ask for some chili so I'm going to go and ask the chili and then napkins yes that so the first thing I always try to do actually is to take a first bite of the food without influencing it with any of the sauces so sizzling sisig wow it tastes like the one just in the philippines oh it's so good the dish is not complete unless they have my sauces I'm so annoyingly particular can I get the chili garlic not powder the pepper like the that the chili garlic soy sauce yes thank you yay yes salamat po thank you do you need this you know how how many peppers I'm gonna put down? a lot alright let's see what i can do here honestly he gave me a spoon but I might just like dump it alright so your girl got herself a big bowl of pepper soy sauce I do want garlic but I don't want to bother them again I'm just gonna make this make all together I will say though I think Malaysia has spicier sauces than the Philippines so Malaysia spice reminds me the most like Thailand and Thailand spice was honestly perfect for me let's see ah i'm so excited okay I'm gonna steal someone's napkins actually be right back okay I just stole somebody's napkins okay so I took a bite of this sisig that is crack so good alright this meatloaf they also gave um it smells like a sweet a sweet spicy sauce also so let's try this it's like a sweet meatloaf what is that inside it looks like a spam or something but it's pretty sweet it's good but I'm going to for sure eat this with pepper it's good so actually here in southeast asia in general when I first would ask for chili I would just say pepper and in america this chili the red chili here we call this pepper I guess it's because the name of this is called Thai Bird's Eye Chili but there was actually one time where I went to a restaurant and I asked if I could have pepper and he gave me like the pepper flakes and I was like oh no not that one but it's funny oh thank you aw she gave me a whole thing of tissues instead because i just asked a random table because i didn't want to bother them meatloaf is good with the dipping sauce that they give but I like my food extra extra spicy with everything yum the sisig I think the meatloaf with the dish is like adding a good finishing touch I asked the owner I was like what percentage of people here are filipinos and he said more than % of people who actually come here and dine in on sundays are filipinos if i were to compare dishes because I've never had meatloaf in the Philippines I don't know how to compare it but this sisig is really spot on it tastes like I'm really in the Philippines right now karaoke?\n",

      "okay so I will tell them that they can put it on because I think a lot of people do come here for karaoke and I don't want to be the reason why they don't enjoy their weekend I wonder if they sell chili bird eye with Thai Bird Eye Chili in the U.S because this has been a part of my diet for the last six months and I don't know if I can eat food without it honestly it's amazing so good I think my spice tolerance has definitely gone up it was already pretty high before I came to asia but it's definitely more now I will say also proportion this sisig is probably good for one meatloaf if you're here with someone else that you can share it but it's really good I'm really glad I came here it's like also before I ever came to the Philippines I've only had Filipino food like twice in my life I don't know why I never really came across um as a dish that I was curious to taste but I'm actually really excited to go home and try out all of the foods from all the countries I've gone to and I actually see the difference I think my time up here in Southeast Asia is still TBD but I have a better understanding of when I have to go home and yeah what a journey what a year it's been like I've been here for the last six months and I think it finally has occurred to me that my body is slowly just wearing out I'm not posting as much as I was when I first was here um I find myself more tired every day and sometimes I just want to do nothing but sometimes it's also difficult when you enjoy creating content a lot but you know that you should give yourself a break sometimes yeah thank you he was also saying too that usually when people sing karaoke here that they'll stay the whole night I don't know if I will be able to stay the whole night but I want to definitely see it and now I totally understand why people here in asia eat rice in the morning at first I was like I don't know anyone who does that but I get it now this sisig is really really good it's crack like I could probably eat this every day there we go karaoke I'm like sitting right in front of the music so everyone's kind of looking at me now so I guess the karaoke goes whenever someone wants to sing and that was cool it was just like this girl was singing and then the whole entire restaurant just kind of like stopped what they were doing and was watching her sing that's cool almost all the tables are full that's crazy I have a feeling here maybe you can fit like people in the main room, maybe? i'm also trying to eat slowly so I can have everything this is a random side note but I was talking to a couple of locals not just here in Malaysia but in other countries like Thailand and they were saying how they miss food from home like the home is in Asia and in the U.S they tried to find like local Thailand food or something and they were saying how they just weren't able to find food that tasted as good as home so they opted in for Mexican food and now I totally understand why because Mexican food they use a lot of lime and everything is so flavorful it's interesting because I think being here in Southeast Asia has made me appreciate my country more and everything that is there not just the food but just like the people and opportunities and the lifestyle they also took the chili away from me but I kind of want more if you are here in kl city there's a lot of a lot of type of food restaurants and dishes to try like all over the city but if you are looking for Filipino food Mabuhay Laguna Restaurant is a good choice not only is the food here really good but there's also a type of community here so if you're here and you're curious I would recommend coming here on a Sunday try to get here a little bit before noon because starting from o'clock it gets a little bit more packed here because the church service ends and people just end up coming here straight directly so this is probably the last time I will probably also have Filipino food until I get back to the states to be honest because I'm hopping over countries so in the next month I'm actually going to be going to three other countries so it's going to be a journey but if my body doesn't wear out I hope to make more travel vlogs uh at a at a pretty good pace at posting them everything was so good i'm so full thank you oh my gosh I shouldn't have taken the last two bites my stomach is going to expand this restaurant was also reviewed by Time Out Magazine in KL ok so i was abrout to leave and then i saw someone order this dessert so this is called a halo halo and i've never had this before in the philippines but apparently this is the filipino version of ice kachang so i don't know where ice kachang originated from but it is dessert and I really needed something sweet so okay ice cream stir?\n",

and you guys are part of the family because you guys are the like we do this because we're documenting our time but it means nothing if we don't have people in the other and even this aside guys our whole entire time we've been in the philippines these are the interactions we've had like the people have welcomed us like there was not even one ounce of hesitation like smiles like i know this for me this is delaying the smiles because literally that's all i received there's literally nothing but love we've made some of the best relationships and connections because being in the philippines it's true we might not show every every interaction we have i know we're vloggers but sometimes we just like to immerse ourselves so like we're not gonna film everything but like we've had some of the best times behind the scenes connecting with the people of the philippines and again i i don't know i don't know how to say it but like thank you for being so welcoming now it's like we legit mean it we would have never had this experience had we not put our trust in you all and getting to know what places to go to in the philippines what to do what not to do as foreigners and just all your recommendations are always always like on the forefront of our minds so thank you thank you thank you don't be shy if you are in cebu or if you happen anywhere or we happen to be where you live yeah let us know we'll meet you up for a quick meal quick chat anything to get to know where you're from who you are and places that we should visit we're down to meet up basically we're we're not oh hell when it's strong um we're down to meet people like we like to talk we like to learn this is uh we learn something new every single day and it's something you can't go and google and learn this stuff you wouldn't we wouldn't know half the things we've learned if we were just relying on google or like the internet mm-hmm true it's it's because of you guys and what you tell us and teach us so yeah you see us say hi do not be afraid if we look busy we're probably not or we might be but still come say hi we can't tell you the amount of times we sat at the starbucks and we've been approached and we're taken back by it because they're like um do they want a table or wait are you speaking to us we like look back oh awesome oh yeah hi yeah so kind we feel at home we do we feel at home in the philippines that's the best is reason one of why we love the philippines is for its food we're not food expertise i mean we bought we watch a couple of episodes of masterchef and hell's kitchen but we would say that the food here has been surprising to say the least i think the best part about it is there's a huge variety like it doesn't every island you go to every region it's different so it feels like you're always trying something new which is great because we're not used to that actually and guys if you go to a home and they're cooking dinner for you it's like a course meal am i wrong the best saying that you will leave the philippines knowing is that you will never go hungry if you visit any filipinos home i mean yeah you're just not you're going to be stuck you're going to be like to the point where like i don't want to eat if they're like no you got to eat if it wasn't for all these invites that we've received over the weekend to visit their homes we would have never ever been exposed to the filipino food that we've had thus far i think our friends thank god we've met them and they've been put into our lives we're very thankful for that they've they've let us try everything everything we've gone way out of our comfort zone wait and the result of that is that we're walking away with some really really favorite yummy food that we now know that if we were to look at it at a restaurant or even a street food vendor we'll know what it is what it should taste like and we'll be comfortable ordering it knowing that it's something that we enjoy eating yeah it's just and it's funny because when we first got here the filipino food we tried we liked it but it was like you know it's like i like it yeah but i have no interest in trying it again type of thing but then when we met our friends that would like home cook meals and explain it all and prep and we'd help or see it like it just tastes completely different so home food is just the best food yeah like fried sardines i'm obsessed with them cassava ube uh really good dessert okay first off ube is mine it is and he knows that i'm obsessed with ube if it has ube in it sign me up i'm gonna eat it i'm probably gonna love it i don't know what it is about this stuff i had no idea what ube was until i got to the philippines and now every time i see it i order it i end up loving it and you know what that's my favorite food in the philippines he's an uber kind of sort of a connoisseur so i know what i'm talking about guys also we've learned that the food here brings people together if you know them you invite them everybody helps like it's it's the type of life the filipinos are very very very kind people and this isn't this is a very generalization because everyone reading that has been beyond kind so it makes us want to have that type of camaraderie whenever we have a we know food brings people together but we haven't seen them brought together like this right would you agree no i agree i mean they asked this guy i don't know how they trusted this guy to cut the lechon at one of the fiestas they didn't ask me she told me okay you're cutting this it's like okay i can't say no to lida food brings people together and it's brought us closer to the culture and closer to people that we normally wouldn't connect with so i'm very thankful to go patrick oh my god this kid does not know how to get patrick what are you doing pee star say hi take him anywhere all right guys so reason million whatever infinite reason number whatever this is that we love the philippines guys there's so much to do and we don't mean just like go to a mall and do this no we're talking like hiking volcanoes cliff jumping like stuff you don't get to do anywhere else in the world in the philippines has literally allowed us to live our adventure dreams guys this place is magic like absolute magic it's not wrong i mean that slogan of it's more fun in the philippines couldn't be any more accurate and if it weren't for this beautiful country we wouldn't be tapping into our inner child and thanks to you all we have fully embraced it with all of our jokes all of our karaoke moments we've had on our travels and now bringing in the third person into our family cute little pizza i mean we would have had none of that had it been through our experiences here in the philippines it's not wrong guys he's not wrong we are living our adventure dreams like this being in the philippines makes us want to go to survivor to be on what is the other show amazing the amazing rate like all these things it's because the philippines offers adventures and you do not get this anywhere else in the world like you will be pushed out of your comfort zone and that's a great great great thing that's the thing the philippines is taught me to get out of your comfort zone go live life like we're living life and there's still more to do i mean like we want to hike mount april we want to go through the sand dunes no don't give away everything we're going to do no no no no no no no just have to stay tuned you want to stay soon all right guys so you made it this far and we figured well now it's time to give you the news we've been loving our time here in the philippines there's still seven thousand more islands or so to explore and we can't see ourselves reading anytime soon guys when i said we've had the best time of our lives because of the philippines i mean it like there is no reason we have no we have no want or desire to go anywhere else anytime soon none whatsoever because it's just you guys are just freaking incredible so we extended our visa how long we've sent our visas for another six months six months you guys for another six months guys like we we love it here and there we just like we

We could not find a lechon restaurant in the mall so we are going to look for it outside Ah the area around Ayala Centre is more modern with high buildings and there is a lot of condos too around and we also noticed some offices like company like we saw Amazon sign, accenture, grab maybe here it's more business district? I'm not sure but yeah we saw another another side of Cebu and it's really interesting and I also noticed that the Jeepney is kind of different from the Manila ones here it's looks more like a like a van Interesting to see that can be different between Manila and Cebu It looks like there is a night market here We can go and see Unlimited!!? But we are not that hungry.. haha We didn't stay very long at the night market it looks really nice but it started raining and just before going I just took an avocado drink look nice huh cheers So we found a nice restaurant here It's called Ayam.. No. Not ayam Ayer, ayer lechon Ayer lechon so we just wanted to try one that is like not famous yeah not really famous for I don't know if it's famous or..? Maybe it is Maybe it is yeah But we choose this one just because it's near our hotel actually But anyway it's just like a simple meal It costs only So we just wanted to just to know what kind of taste we can have in a normal lechon restaurant they gave us a sauce also but I will just try just like that. It's quite good It's a little bit too salted for me I think it's vinegar with a bit of chili too The same? yeah it's kind of similar But this is more sour.\n",

      "if you saw the first vlog of you noticed that i started to learn more tagalog i already finished chapter one of the book and now i'm ready to go for chapter two so this vlog is gonna be exciting guys because i will make a pandesal dough but first um let's make some dutch food okay i'm gonna show you one dutch meal so dutch food is really simple okay and what is so nice about dutch food uh we call it you know and i have a back here this is uh onions and carrots okay just onions and carrots okay uh and we call this hot spot fruit means vegetables okay and then here is a pork meat and potatoes and we're gonna basically use these ingredients a little bit of butter and that's about it some salt and then after that i'm gonna make a panda salt dough it's going to be exciting because i want to bring it to my parents you know a real filipino breakfast i want to make cinnamon from the sauce and i'm thinking to actually bring them some sausages like a longanisa okay so for the dutch food first i'm gonna peel these potatoes i'm using this uh potato peeler see it's very easy just like this to get the peel off and i think you call these patatas right in tagalog patatas but i noticed that in the philippines it's very hard to get potatoes and if you can get the potatoes they're quite expensive actually so i'm wondering if you can get uh potatoes easily in your region in the philippines so then once uh the peel is off i just cut it in a few pieces like that so now i wash the potatoes a little bit add some water and we're gonna add salt quite a bit of salt and then let's turn the heat on okay now this is pork shoulder it's about grams of pork shoulder okay so i'm gonna fry that in a little bit of butter just like that i think that's quite maraming i put a little bit too much butter but it gives more flavor diba now the nice thing about this food is so simple like i said you just what you do you put all the onions the hot let me open that back a little bit more guys ah that's better no so see how easy this is you just put everything the hot and then you cover okay we fry the pork shoulder in the butter now i can only fit three at a time so i'm gonna put three first and then the other two okay i'm very excited for the new vlogs because uh this is gonna be a continuous vlog okay so it will be continuous series on pinoy planet like i said i'm preparing for panda salt though after this we're gonna make panda salt dough we're gonna make a nice filipino breakfast for my parents so last video before this one it was the best moments of the food that i brought to my parents based on your recommendations on your um on the moments that you like the most i got the feedback from you so i put all together in one video if you have not seen that one yet you can uh please go ahead to watch it um so the next one is gonna be filipino breakfast so it is time to flip them over the pork meat let's go see not yet let me let me put it back because it's still not let's wait a little while longer so flip them around and you see now they're becoming nice and brown okay and the onion carrots and potatoes are boiling i wish that i could okay so the pork meat is done look at that guys so of course i've put a little bit of salt on both sides uh so these are very tasty for sure and now we can have a look at the carrots and potatoes and a little bit more thyme and also i'm going to remove some water so now i removed all the excess water there's still a little bit of water there that's okay and then we're going to use this thing to mesh everything okay smash it okay so now it's time to add some butter okay always nice i think about two tablespoons or so that is very tasty so and basically that's it so i just mixed everything the butter the potatoes the carrots the onions a little bit of salt you can also add a little bit of pepper if you like and then you just put it on a plate with the meat that's it so now it's time to play a little bit of basketball i'm gonna play basketball i like to play basketball so the sun is out let's do a little game and then when we come back i will try a few moments later so it's evening i finished the workout i just had a workout and now i want to prepare for lunga nissa okay so just a second i actually bought these sausages today these are japanese sausages but i couldn't find the longanisa in the store i think they don't sell it any longer so therefore i'm gonna try making my own longanisa because it needs to be filipino diba now i will add a little bit of salt okay some athene not so much because i also want to add a little bit of soy sauce filipino soy sauce sugar let's add a few then i have sweet paprika powder okay let's add quite a bit of sweet paprika powder gives it a nice um yeah a little bit of sweet smoky flavor kind of thing set up maraming diba that is quite a lot so then i'm not sure if you normally do it but i'll be adding a little bit of filipino vinegar cane vinegar so just uh maybe two two or three so it's time to mix everything and then i'll put it in the ref for uh like two hours you know i changed my mind um there's no black pepper so i'm gonna add a little bit of hot sauce okay just a tiny bit quintillon and then in the freezer overnight okay we'll put um put this on the way scale let's do like uh grams so then i'm just rolling this in plastic i think the shape already looks like uh longanisano luco it became many longanisa and actually they're all grams but this one is only .\n",

Either you're walking up or down a hill, wherever you go in this city, guys. But, you would rather that, than be in Manila where it's all flat, but the weather's hot.

common here beloved Filipino food very intimidating to me but for you guys I'm gonna try it and Molly is too she's very excited just kidding but I will all right guys so anyway breakfast here we go do we order here I guess we maybe order here and then we sit all right guys we're in the restaurant and the first dish has arrived this is called siopao it is a big fluffy bun this is actually a Chinese Filipino dish so it's very similar to like about that you've seen in some Chinese food probably the big fluffy pillowy bun filled with some kind of sweet delicious meat and they actually Mark which type of bun it is with this uh colored dot on the top of it Molly why don't you do the honors take the first bite how is it I feel good really let me try oh yeah this looks really good so it's got that kind of caramelized meat in there oh and an egg um and there's some sauce spicy sweet okay so and then in there there's a hard-boiled egg Molly wanted me to clarify that she's only not trying the balloon because she doesn't like eggs in general not because it is a fertilized fetus inside the egg if you liked normal eggs then you would definitely try the balloon right definitely anyway that's coming at the end guys stay tuned all right guys the second dish has arrived so here we have Mommy it's actually called Mommy this is a type of soup it's also a Chinese Filipino dish it's like a basically a chicken noodle soup but here it's made with pork pork is super popular in the Philippines and this goes great with the CIO Pao this is the breakfast soup let's give it a try and let's see how it is got noodles a little bit of greens some pork delicious very salty and you've got still The Fluffy bun to go along with it guys I don't know if this is allowed but I'm gonna try dipping the scopal in the broth yell at me in the comments if this is uh against the rules I think it's very good salty and sweet the broth is Savory it's oily you can feel it coating your lips but it is uh super super tasty that salty Umami flavor so we're gonna finish this up and then we are going to head to our next stop hopefully we save room okay guys we are on our way to our next stop down here in central Cebu City stay tuned we've got lechon coming up we've got street food and we've got balloon all right guys we're at our next stop now it is called sienti lechon here in Cebu and in the Philippines more broadly but especially in Cebu they are famous for lechon lechon is a cling a pig that's been roasted on a spit and then they chop it up in a variety of different ways they make sure that they always include some of the really crispy skin that's been nice and crisped up very crackly they chop it up with a big knife and yeah like I said it is absolutely famous here so we waited to try it until we came here to Cebu we've also got some garlic rice which is what it sounds like rice with garlic very famous here in the Philippines and delicious let's give it a try ladies first of course Molly go ahead oh you hear that all right so you got a little bit of pork Molly used to not like pork and now on this trip you're eating so much of it so much more all right all right I've got an excellent bite here with a lot of crispy skin first bite of lechon Cheers everybody foreign wow it is so juicy I think by slow roasting the whole pig they keep all those juices in there so juicy super tender super flavorful now let's try a little bit with this garlic rice and it probably goes great together oh very garlic salty heavy all right guys the last bite we want to try is with this special sauce that it comes with I don't think it's straight soy sauce but maybe a little bit of soy vinegar maybe some sweetness it was on the table so we'll give it a dunk here a little bit of that rice a little bit of that pork actually a lot of that pork and here we go yeah this is delicious very popular for Filipino celebrations get a whole pig and roast it this is incredible all right guys that lechon was delicious we are on the road again to our next stop the balut is drawing ever closer with every passing minute and I'm getting nervous but I'm also excited because it'll be an experience and that's what it's all about I'm doing it for you guys so stay tuned the balloon is coming at the end of the video but for now we're off to a very special iconic Filipino restaurant and here it is guys Jollibee how excited are you Molly so Jollibee is a super famous actually at this point International uh Filipino fast food chain there's their little mascot we're gonna go inside they serve a bunch of stuff but we're here for something very special yes so here at Jollibee their main thing is Fried Chicken which they call here chicken Joy very nice name for it and then they've also got Burgers they've got hot dogs with I think macaroni and cheese on it not sure I've never tried it they've also got what they call Burger steaks which are like burgers with this mushroom sauce and everything comes with rice it's very good however here today we are here to try something very special which is Jolly spaghetti okay and here it is do you want to do the big reveal oh wow obviously you got to do the honors since this is your favorite they have this place in New York actually in Midtown New York there's a Jollibee good okay so what is it about Jollibee spaghetti that makes it so special it's has cheese some kind of like white cheese on it and it has hot dogs in it yum yes so it's sweet spaghetti and uh it's not my favorite thing I like it okay it's it's like total junk food let's give it a bite here we go sweet Jollibee Filipino spaghetti good flavor to me a little bit strange definitely unique but a lot of people love it including this person here we've got some pineapple juice which is just sugary and delicious yeah that's so good yeah no it's tasty sweet spaghetti goes that's why we came to Jollibee stay tuned we've got more coming up soon so we're on our way to try the next food on our list it's actually going to be the second to last with the last of course being balut but the one that we're going to be trying right now is called and our Taxi Driver yesterday told us about it and he said it's a really common food with taxi drivers and one thing I've learned is that where the taxi drivers go to eat you should also go because they know all the best tiny little hole in the wall spots wherever they work and that's where we're headed right now I don't even know what it is I kind of forget so we're gonna go there check it out give it a try and uh yeah it's gonna be fun okay we're here and look at all of this fried stuff what is all this can you tell me is n't that it's Pork yeah small intestine okay what about these ones is it really uh pork belly okay what's this one made of um vegetables vegetable oh we don't want that only the pork right and there's even some crabs there okay so punko Bunko is just like a bunch of fried stuff okay cool and these are just uh this one is okay crispy so this whole place is just loaded with tables and they're each like their own station do you guys all work for the same company or so it's all one place that all serves the same stuff but all these different stands anyway it's all separate okay and everything comes wrapped in plastic so they can quickly reuse the plates and whatnot thank you you excited yeah we can just share it together this is the intestine oh pork belly and this is intestine okay everyone's wearing these bags ah okay yeah do I wear that because it's very greasy all right so here is a piece of uh intestine thank you here we go oh that's good tastes like crispy bacon it tastes like fried chicken okay now here's the pork belly pork belly again deep fried oh wow see that's the competition when everyone walks in to get them to come to their stall s wow I ate the pork belly just as that promotion started it's delicious similar very crispy here's a nice big it's like chicharron you're gonna like it this one yeah here's a big veggie roll also deep fried I'm gonna need a diet after this no more fried food for like a couple weeks foreign like it could almost be potato or some I don't know some kind of starchy vegetable cool experienced to come here this reminds me of getting compare in Turkey in ortakoi when you get there all the potato sellers are yelling at you to try to get you to come to their stall it's a cool experience I would recommend this come when you're hungrier though because there's a lot of stuff to try we only tried a few things but we've got a bunch of other stuff crabs should we try crabs since it was your idea you gotta try first I think you just dig it out with your fingers very fried they're very good so this is just like the kind of the head the back of the crumb I think they kind of stuff it with the stuff because I don't think the whole head is normally filled with me like that I think they empty it out and make maybe some kind of a meat mix maybe and then put it back in the shell for serving I'm not sure any Filipinos in the comments let me know if I'm wrong about that but let's give it a try oh okay very sweet so we're going to continue on to the final challenge of this video balut stay tuned bye-bye thanks Doug Barnard okay guys that was really good very crispy very fried but the experience I think is what made it so we're gonna try to find balut right now they just told us that it's more of a nighttime thing or a late afternoon thing and it's the middle of the day but we have to go to the airport soon however if we don't find it here I'm gonna get it in Manila tonight so it's coming up right after this no matter what all right guys I'm back in Jakarta now we couldn't find it in Cebu but uh we're here looking for balut and I think we found the right place I'm so nervous uh oh gosh I think it's right there gosh hello okay is it chicken or duck duck okay oh I'm so nervous all right I'm handing the camera off to Molly film well please I'll do my best one try yeah seriously or two no one our taxi driver is coming to to come with us to witness it's so much yeah yeah so can you tell me how to eat it please do I open can you help you poke with the stick thank you uh this side okay hit it here okay okay oh oh oh my gosh okay we're finding a little oh my God Sanju you're enjoying this more than me okay drink the juice okay I'm gonna drink the soup so just take a look in there first so you can see there's a little bit of yolk and there's a little bit of fetus so this is the real deal here guys I'm gonna drink the juice it smells like chickeny broth all right I'm gonna drink the juice it's very hot the juice is good yeah let's open a little bit more of this and we can see if we can get a better look at baby duckling yeah okay good are you gonna eat one with me okay good oh should I put salt yeah okay very nice okay well you have to drink your soup first so how many days how many days incubation days yeah I heard that's the longest I read online that it's to days is the best time but is less feathers and softer beak so guys in here just to recap we've got uh a fertilized duck egg so the embryo has started to form and oh did you eat it you show me how to do it oh you finished one bite okay I'm gonna do two bites come on is it good did you put the sauce on it yeah I'm gonna put stent okay okay okay so yeah is that oh is that the head yeah okay so here we've got a small duck uh embryo it feels like a mix between an egg and and something more oh you can see some veins there some feathers developing here yeah there's feathers right there see that black bit there is is some of the feathers and uh okay I'm not gonna I'm not gonna dissect it anymore hot sauce please thank you so much so we're actually gonna do this in one bite here okay um cheers to the Philippines thank you so much for a great visit this is a really big bite yeah two bites two bites here we go I'm glad you guys are enjoying it all right here we go one bite two bites actually if I didn't have just do one bite that's good yeah yeah thank you so first impressions while it's still in my mouth it tastes like a very firm egg with some hard bits in there I'm not getting beak and um claws as much as just like thickness like the body is starting to develop but there's no difference between like the meat and the bones of the baby yet it's all it's just a kind of hardness and it it tastes more like chicken than egg food very strong oh it's duck right sorry not chicken duck um okay good good to hear what do you say very strong knees and very strong sex both knees and also sex to be honest this is not that bad it's pretty it tastes like chicken the texture is a little strange but if you can see it there like here is just like kind of like egg white but it's getting a little harder and it's weird you can because you can see the the yolk part and then it's turning more into the bird part here which is all coming apart now I'm gonna finish this and get the job done by the way I should mention that because I changed my plate tonight I had a little more time and I had two beers before this only two but I think it's uh that probably helped a little bit all right we're gonna finish it this is no big deal guys I've had worse things that bite was easier that was more eggy the other one was harder I bit through probably the the formation of the body uh yeah thank you so much it's okay thank you I want to savor it the second bite was easy that that was just like eating a hard-boiled egg the first bite a little bit rough some tough bits in there let me just get it done so you guys know I finished the job guys this is the end of the food tour thank you so much for watching I hope you guys enjoyed the video subscribe if you haven't already we've got a lot more coming from around the world other than that see you in the next one bye\n",

and i mean a lot of people do those really really amazing runs but it's like it's like they're disjointed yeah i don't know like you know what i mean like i think about like looking at it and it's just like you kind of have like the dips but like hers are just like dude and she can do things with her voice that's just this doesn't make sense yeah and it's just her control she yeah she has optimal control amazing control also his voice uh is just fantastic and when i when you look at him you're like oh i didn't you know just the way yeah his voice sounds like yeah sometimes yeah like there are a lot of people that will surprise you where like they opened up their mouth and you just like i always think i go back to felix from straight kid with a deep voice where like when he opens

like here he's a wild boy for that one right there here i'll climb every morning okay dude so wild their voices are like meant for each other yeah really yeah yeah yeah but doing intricate runs like that is hard enough as an individual singer doing those runs and hitting them in harmonies in perfect timing like there's a re there's a reason why like generally it's solo artists that will do stuff like that or only sing parts on their own you don't harmonize parts like that you you don't unless you are a very high level vocal like like hey if they're not the next aladdin and jasmine like okay you know because like that those vote the way they fit together you know what i mean i'm not saying that you know i'm just saying right the way that the vocals fit together like that it was just like they both have a very soulful quality yeah like his voice is has that warmth to it like that very mid-range warmth and she has she's fluttering all ball around the clouds like dude i don't know much about him not only i kind of i'm curious to hear more about him too his voice was higher yeah really really good higher wow okay never ceases to amaze me with her like of all the stuff i i i really i had asked in a previous video that i did i don't know that i've checked the comments on it yet because it just came out but i'm really curious i don't think we've heard anything original by her yet

Travel clearances and fathers But be aware that an Australian sponsor can't go and pick up the child of his girlfriend or fiance and bring them back to Australia.

      "that should be it ta-ra today my parents-in-law in the philippines will try dutch food two types of giniling baboy at baka kilo oh it's so nice to cook in the philippines again can't wait to see the reaction of my parents-in-law this recipe is not completely dutch because i wanted to use ingredients that you can find in the philippines so that you can try making this one yourself konting toyo na lang also konting asin just a little bit make sure not to overdo it remember that we also have tomato ketchup and other ingredients which add flavor to the dish tamis anhang version isang tablespoon na lang white pepper cayenne pepper one package i like these tiny packages from the philippines these are really handy and also a some package of garlic powder this is a must for meatball recipe now i'm adding breadcrumbs i'll add one package of breadcrumbs it looks like a lot but this will really make the meatballs firm the amazing mascovado sugar from the philippines it's about isang tablespoon you might wonder why i'm cooking so much for my parents-in-law but you know every time i cook in the philippines there's like other persons joining us so i'm gonna make a little bit extra because we might get a lot of visitors i added one tablespoon cornstarch you can also add one more egg to make it extra firm but it's not necessary because we already add the bread crumbs you know i don't like to measure things exactly i always do it on feeling you know that's much nicer in my opinion so we're adding four cloves of garlic as well i wanted to leave the just the garlic powder but i know filipinos love bawang so we're going to add a little extra bawang i made sure to wash my hands of course so now we're going to grind everything mix everything mix lahat just mix everything together just mix lahat and we're gonna shape these into balls and they're actually gonna be pretty big make sure to mix it really well so that all the spices and two kinds of giniling and mix then just shape the balls meatballs and like i said pretty big just use approximately the same size just shape them like this you roll it and you're done pffeww sobrang iniit dito sa Pilipinas but i love the init so here's uh probably to meatballs that should be enough for a filipino gathering diba we're gonna peel the potatoes i'm cooking it's a dutch recipe with potato yeah it's potatoes and meatballs it's simple simple food in the netherlands you eat simple that's food dutch food so i hope you're gonna like it so now i'm doing all the potatoes and onions and carrots nanay is already curious peeling of the potatoes is easy but it takes a little bit of time nanay is helping me with cutting the potatoes ah this is pinoy style with the knife delicious iced coffee for me wow so now it's time for the carrots same thing as with the potatoes i'm just peeling them nice will you use this also for the halaman yes that is nice for the halaman right here you can just sit up here so we just chop it like this small pieces like you would make a pancit canton the rest of this dish is pretty simple just wash the potatoes in the dirty kitchen same with the carrots and the onions give them a little wash we're gonna turn it on the potatoes first it has uh about one and a half times the amount of water in the meantime we're gonna fry the meatballs here in the other pan oh this is going to be so brang sarap if you have not seen the grocery shopping yet i'll put the link in the description for the other video i'm going to put a little bit of salt on the potatoes are you also excited to see nanay and tatay's reaction how will they react to this dutch food because it's so simple lang do you have magic sarap i think that is really it's totally not dutch it is very filipino it should be very sarap see it needs to have a nice color like this is the potatoes are half cooked at this moment normally in the netherlands we use a masher for this but i'll be creative like pinoy so we just mash everything i removed the water as you can see i just left a little bit of water carrots patatas magic sarap we mix the butter and this is low heat so that the final moist can go out and it's pretty much done we put it like this we'll add one of the meatball in the middle it's like a doughnut right the sabaw goes on top like that kain na tayo tatay this is uh food from the netherlands from the netherlands yes it's a stampot stamppot can you say it yes potatoes with meatball and sibuyas at carrots next would you like to try it we have fish without fish there's no fish uh

      "hey what's up Chad here so many of you have probably heard of this incredible place in Manila the Venice Grand Canal mall it's really quite impressive the way they recreated a little piece of Venice Italy and made it the focal point of this high-end mall it's such a cool place to come to dine do some shopping or just walk around and take in the scenery and then of course you have the famous BGC right next door a massive business and lifestyle District it's super impressive with its modern architecture Lush Landscaping all the parks and endless dining and shopping these areas in particular are often called the bubbles within Manila and are quite different than the majority of Manila so I've been staying in a neighborhood called Tembo in Makati City directly across the highway from BGC and I want to take you on a little walk and talk to check it out and just see what it's like outside the BGC bubble hey what's up guys all right this that is BGC over there I'm walking against the grain here on the wrong side of the road that I want to show you all right so this highway right here divides BGC and Pembo Makati neighborhood that I'm staying in so all the amazingness of BGC is literally it starts right there we got SM aura mall right there and then you cross the road and it's a little different over here very different in terms of like the modern high-end fancy money money but this is more typical around the Philippines I like it I'm staying in here you can walk out you got wet and dry markets and yeah there's a lot more people it's not modern fancy but um

or island or part of the world or if it's something you want to see to determine if it's where you want to go like if you come to BGC could you come and stay in a place like this you know the place that we're staying at is right off of this Main Street you literally just walk out the door and you're kind of in the middle of this I love it but it might not be everyone's thing so videos like this

Kind of contrast but we're not complaining they provided a shelter absolutely for free this is a normal house for the Philippines by the way, we learned the price this room is per month it is exactly USD And it’s not that cheap there is no water now there is a toilet without a flush ladle and bowl instead of a flush ladle and bowl instead of a shower water is only at night, in the evening There is no water now, because of an afternoon time They keep it in bowls and buckets I guess for this money on the outskirts of Kyiv you can get something better to rent and somewhere in Zaporizhia for sure but not in Russia I bought a tempered glass for my phone in Hong Kong For local dollars Do you have a tape?\n",

      "okay guys so now let's start the plating of the bilal and so the chef has already put the chicken wings on the plate and now she's putting the butter so for those of you who don't know what bilal is below is something like a platter which has everything in it am i correct so she's putting butter like generously on it then they're going to put the dressing and for this the dressing was parmesan so and this is the lemon and the pepper so as i've been told earlier that for each below you can choose two flavors so the customer was ordered this one has ordered two flavors that is the garlic sorry so that's the parmesan and the lemon and pepper and that's i think parsley so see i'm myself a chef of half so let's see the next part whether you do the partition in the video in the in the plate in the platter of this so as you can see in this video that they're going to put a lot of things so now i think they're going to put boiled brinjals eggplant so those of the indians who are watching this they're thinking what is this it's a filipino staple do you call it tortang it's a part of the salad so they've put that they're putting the red onions tomato and then the delicacy that's a salted egg so as you can see the salted egg is having the color of the yolk which is being changed into dark yellow or orange as it's being processed for a long period of time it's a delicacy which i am telling you it's a must try if you want to try it alone you can go to bunker one and get it from there now the next part they're going to plate i think lumpia or something they're going to plate lumpia and the lumpia is having the filling of pork so those of you want to try lumpia the original in-house lumpy of wild wings they can try it so this is a medium-sized pillow this is the smallest size so as you can see guys in the smallest size there is so much food so just imagine how much will be there in the biggest size don't worry if you can't imagine i will be putting a picture of that and then you can see the size comparison so everything is being counted twice so now the next part that's the b horn so those who are thinking that what is bihar so bihar is uh filipino vermicelli noodles so that's been cooked with pork and vegetables and now they're going to put that into the platter so how much people how many people can eat this small one so it's good for four to five people and guys now the plate is being covered in foil but if you could i could show you the plate before it was made it is made up of bamboo so it's not harming the environment it's not made up of plastic so you can use it later also for making cmi if you want in the house for those of you don't know come on it's filipino momos with less coating more meat so the smell of the bee horn is making me irresistible to try it and now they're going to put the dressing of bihon that is made up of cabbage carrot chicken and if you want you can put tomas or the anything on that if you want at your house so the last thing which is going on this is the shrimp so guys just to let you know that i will not be tasting the whole bilal so that it's a lot of food i will be trying some part of it in a separate dish in a separate plate so this is the shrimp piece so the shrimpies are being made by uh frying them somehow in the pan firstly by boiling and then by sauteing them in the pan so those of you who love seafood they would love to see this scene right now of shrimpies i think it's made up of garlic yeah it's sorted with garlic yeah so there's something still left guys i don't know what it is they're going to surprise now so still more garlic is going on so those of you who love the dragon breath smell of garlic and along with this they'll be even giving you dipping sauce i think some dipping sauce so that you can dip your things in that only the food nothing else don't take it to the wrong way so now came the lechon so what is this called lechon yeah the lecture on roll and as i've been told earlier that the lechon roll is boneless so we don't have to do the hard work of taking out the bones and how many kilos is this one it's one kilo and i'm sure it's difficult to finish and it looks so nice so now the dipping sauces are coming the vinegar and the monk tomas sauce and now the plating is done so now they will be covering it up and they will be dispatching it thank you guys so stay connected bye bye okay guys so we are the last stage of our video that's the tasting version of the mini platter of bilal so only one thing is missing in this that's a leech on roll and that's a very big thing and i don't want to try that so just to let you know what it will taste like i know that it will be tasting like crunchy country pork it is very delicious if it's three or four people of you you can order one roll from kai from wild wings but it's since it's just me and my cameraman named so i don't want to waste the electron roll so let's try the rest of the things the rest of the things are the bihon the lumpia the shrimp piece the salted egg the salad and the dipping sauce so let's start this video by using the by tasting the lumpia so the lump is made up of pork and i have been told that i can dip it in the sauces so we have the gravy vinegar we have the ketchup and my favorite ranch so i'll be dipping into the ranch obviously the lumpia is having the density of the pore it's not that spicy so if you want to have the spicy one you can check my instagram and then go and order the chili gourmet spice thing thing from wheat so if you want you you can get it from them and even kai at while drinks about they have the dipping sauce of the spicy thing so if you want you can dip it with that so instead of half lump here left i'll be dipping into the gravy and let's see if this any different flavor according to me still lumpia with the ranch is the best so let's proceed to the next part of the video in this plate as you can see it's having bihon so for those of you who are thinking what bihorn is so bihar is the filipino vermicelli noodles and which are being cooked with chicken and vegetables and with some amount of soy sauce so let's try bihon have eaten me on a lot of times before also so this is the same type but the dressing which kai has made for the bihon which is made up of chicken so as you can see in the video also there's still some chicken on this pihan so this chicken is so tender that it just melts in the mouth so if you want to try some more different type of bihan you can ask kai and but i'm so sorry that this platter which we showed you earlier which i'm racing right now it's only for a limited time offer so maybe next christmas season or maybe next new year you can order that so now we have this the salad and then that we have the red onions the tomato and the salted egg so i will be tasting the salted deck for all of you picking one for the team i've tasted solid egg before also i love it it's having a different texture it's having different flavor then the other things which you can taste in the market so you can take it in your hand and eat it directly if you love to eat savory things it is for you i will just flush down everything down it's such a strong flavor of salted egg it's processed for around still where i remember it's processed for around to days so that gives it a different texture and different flavor so we have the last part of this video in which i'll be trying the shrimp piece which have been sauteed with the garlic so as you can see the head is still on and for those of you who don't know how to eat a shrimpy i'll be doing it now for you if you want you can remove the head and then eat it like this but i don't like to eat the shell also of the back tail so i'll be removing that but since it has been cooked in the\n",

this way as well okay cool let's go come on okay so then he comes through here through the front entrance up the stairs keep going up the stairs and it turns really hot about here because downstairs is air conditioning and upstairs even but you have a full dining table you have a kitchen over there you have a big lounge sits in faces the amazing view that's outside it is warm but there's fans at

this amazing view oh look at the boat can you see it that's cool hammock to lay in suits to sit in amazing view and villa to be in so wait real quick look at the secrets and i jumped in right from up here no you didn't that's dangerous don't do that so that's it for this villa we just enjoyed this one for my birthday but let's head on to the rest of the fun activities that we have we're actually on the way to check into our next place so let's do that and we'll show you the rest of the fun day that we have on boracay island so this is going to be my first time in an e-try you could do it yeah we'll see oh thank you oh thank you thank you so i think we just got a little scammed uh we ordered the we were on the tricycle thing and he just dropped us here but we have to go all the way down there by like a long way so i think he knew that and he just kind of dropped us here and we paid for it but you know what you live and you learn these things happen let's go for a long walk and i have no energy i need a coffee all right let's go i'm holding my shoes okay so it's not even in that street it's a bit further down so oh it's too early for this for me i haven't had a coffee yet all right so we're maybe halfway sure we have to go all the way to the very end basically so maybe he couldn't have got the tricycle down here but we're just pulling all this stuff and yeah oh thank you okay we are still still going i'm tired that's for sure i see the water now yay oh now it's sand this is harder so we just maybe you're playing the sailboat now no thank you we're gonna have some food thank you thank you so we're just going to go grab some food we just checked in to the hotel it's just for one night and then we're leaving in the morning the um room will be ready for us in about minutes so we're just gonna pop along the beach here find something i in case you can't tell have not that much energy today but that's okay we're gonna get into some fun activities this afternoon i'm gonna have some coffee i'm gonna have some monster i'm gonna wake up let's go get some food oh i need food we haven't even had food yet and then we're going to eat i don't know what i'm saying let's get some food this is beautiful that's what i'm saying look at this amazing so another thing i've learned about the philippines is that there's always a starbucks somewhere right on the beach i am not mad about that i do need a coffee um but we're still on the hunt for some breakfast because it's about midday we haven't had anything to eat yet today so okay so i think there's a fan here that you might hear in the video but it's so hot i need the fan um i just want to tell you why i'm really tired today so really quickly uh today last night i stayed up quite late because my first video in manila the first impressions one went up and uh so many of you liked it and subscribed that i hit k and so thank you so much but i was just i was so excited and so happy and like i just was too excited to sleep and i was like staying up i was like oh my gosh i'm so close i'm so close and yeah i hit it last night so that's why i'm a little bit tired it was on my birthday so what a good birthday present so thank you all for my birthday present of subscribers thank you okay so that was actually a really nice coffee and i'm really happy about that because i needed it but before we go out and we do anything else i just want to show you this room so we've just checked into this one we're only here for one night as we're leaving to the next destination tomorrow but i just thought i'd show you the room so as you walk in you have this beautiful room here it's um pretty standard but actually quite nice to be honest you have the desk that we need to use because we both work online there's a desk over here but there's also a dining room chair and table over there as well big bed looks like a king to me not sure what it like feels like actually let's just try oh it's actually quite soft okay that's cool because i like soft beds and then it looks straight out onto this little balcony that you have with some chairs and it has really nice greenery over there as well and then if you come through here around this little room divider you have the bathroom but on this side you have the toilet on this side you have the shower room and then you have the sink right there so this is where we'll be staying for tonight breakfast in the morning and then we're flying to the next place but right now we're gonna go and get like an activity done everyone in the comments in my manila video was telling me to do some uh like water sports on boracay island so we're gonna do that today we just gotta pick which one what do we have they've given us this which ones are they helicopter tour of the island oh how much is that about per person whoa i mean it's expensive but you're thinking what i'm thinking v no i want to do something like like that i can do you know like a helicopter is just kind of sitting there i want to do something if you're new here i broke my back about four years ago so anything with like impact on the water like kind of really scares me so i might be looking at maybe like a stand-up paddleboarding or like a canoeing or like something like that that might that might be a little bit safer um for me to do but let's pick one of them and then we'll head out in a second and show you the beach because we have like full-on front beach access from this resort hotel so that's really cool oh and as always i'm gonna leave the hotels and the villas and everything in the description bar below so we paid well michael paid for this for my birthday but it's not a collaboration i'm just gonna leave them below if you want to stay where we stayed as well okay so i just went down and i spoke to reception and i'm gonna do the parasailing um so i've never done that before and we're gonna go out and parasail over the island boracay island so i'm so excited um it was pesos going through this uh hotel that we're staying in i'm not sure what the going rate is but i'm just happy to have it organized and done um but we're just heading down there now and this is gonna be fun all right let's go let's go downstairs okay so we've just walked up the like laneway to the main street so this is the main street um and i think they're just gonna collect us and take us to the boat or where we're gonna go up i'm not sure um but i do feel some rain so i'm getting a little bit nervous okay we're just crossing the road to head into the car or the truck or the bus that's going to take us to where we go up in the air thank you hi so they've taken us to like the port or like the beach and then they've got a big line thing that goes out to sea there and i think they take us from here to on a boat a speed boat that takes us to like where we're getting on to parasail if that makes sense oh there's so many people out there i don't know if you can see that there's like seven people out in the air in the middle of the ocean okay this is where i tell you that i'm scared of the ocean but what if i fall in i probably can't swim i'm scared so we're just heading out now on the uh boat and i think we're going to where then we'll go up in the thing thank you thank you i got it i love something okay so we're on like a houseboat and obviously we go from this houseboat to this guy this guy okay i'm a little bit scared of the ocean in case you don't know so this will be oh look at everyone on the banana boat look so big booty we saw something like jump out of the ocean okay okay go faster go faster i'm going down i'm going down oh i'm so loyal to the ocean oh my go up go up go up please oh my gosh oh my gosh oh no oh no no go up get up go oh my god oh yeah yeah oh my oh i'm so high up oh oh my gosh i am shaking i'm shaking okay my biggest fear is literally open water in the ocean like this oh my oh my gosh oh my gosh go higher please i was so close to the ocean then oh my oh oh my gosh guys it's like i'm floating in the air but i'm so scared it's i can see like the whole sea below me oh it's kind of uncomfortable in my legs to be honest i'm holding on for literal dear life i think i'm coming back in now i'm going down yeah oh my gosh guys that was so scary but that was so cool oh my gosh please don't let me hit the water don't let me hit the water it's like my biggest fear oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh my gosh oh my gosh my gosh my gosh my gosh my gosh ah guys guys guys guys no no no no no don't do that don't do that oh my god he yelled shark oh no no no no no okay okay i'm okay okay i'm shaking oh thank you i think i have sea legs i said legs in the water and i went all right okay it's just started to rain here on boracay island it was coming through when i was in the water on the parasail but i haven't actually gone for a swim in the ocean yet and we're actually leaving tomorrow to go to another destination in the philippines so i have to go in the water i'm gonna have a quick dip stay in this beautiful water here for a little bit the water is beautiful it feels like quite warm with like a little tinge of cold but not really it's not enough to not want to go in or anything around me okay so we just got out of the water and we're just heading down this main sort of strip on the beach um because a few of you in my comments were telling me that i need to try is it jonas juice spa or something jonas is that right yep so we're going to try and head there and have a juice that you all recommended because apparently it's a must do when you're on boracay island so let's have a look okay so we just ordered our drinks michael got chopped peanut butter and i got pineapple mango so delicious i'm really excited all right so that was a really cool shake i don't normally often have like fruit shakes and that one was really nice and right now it's like the sun has just sort of got down and there's still so many people on this beach on this island so we're just heading back now but there's a massive day here i love the vibes of boracay by the way everyone has so much fun all the time it's just easy going it's the best this is like one of this is such a good island to come to you should definitely come here people will ask you if you want to go on a boat sail ride every two meters but or whatever right but whatever yeah yeah it's cool it's fun so that's it from beautiful boracay island in the philippines what was your favorite part of the vlog let me know in the comments below because mine was probably the parasailing even though that was the scariest one of the serious things i've ever done in my life uh tomorrow is a new destination still here in the philippines but i want you to try and guess where we're going as well in the comments below i had such a great day i loved boracay island i loved having my birthday here as well so that's it for now please like and subscribe if you haven't already and i'll see

      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: I won't be vlogging. And then I'll be going somewhere else in the Philippines. I don't have plans yet.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: I did have a flight booked to Cebu.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: There's an actual airport here, with like or flights a week, only to Cebu.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: And that's how I was gonna do it, but Philippines Air, or Air Philippines, whatever they call themselves, they just canceled my flight. Just like that, just canceled my flight, so hey, I guess I'm, I guess I'm rearranging my plans. Fortunately, I hadn't booked a hotel yet, in Cebu, so there's that. But, yeah, I guess I'm taking a bus back to Manila and then either taking a plane straight to somewhere else, that I haven't decided yet, or maybe I'll stay in Manila a couple of days. Maybe I'll pick up that football shirt from the Azkals and do something else in Manila. Maybe I'll stay in a different area than I stayed last time, in Makati.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: The first time I came to Manila, like years ago...\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: So I'll either stay there, or maybe just some random other city in the Manila metropolis. Because Manila is kinda like a metropolis, it's like different cities within the metropolis, you know. So, like Quezon or something like that.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: -Are you Filipino?\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: -Hiiiii I’m on this very special vehicle, and after two years of planning, I'm finally in the Philippines. And this video I'm going to cover my first impressions of the capital city of Manila It’ s p.m.. And I'm in Manila.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: It's and I'm in Malate, which is inside Metro Manila, which is actually like cities, by the way.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: - Philippines, Manila -I live in Makati.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: So the Philippines is actually a country of more than seven and a half thousand islands that are like dispersed throughout this archipelago. We're on Luzon right now, which is the biggest island of them all, with a population of like million. And I think it's more than like % of the whole population of the Philippines.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: So people have lived in the Philippines for tens of thousands of years and different waves of people have come from different parts of Asia and settled on these islands.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: The earliest settlers were Negritos, and after that, waves and waves of Austronesians came in who make up a majority of the population of the people living here today.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: And if you want to find out more about the history of the people of the Philippines, in the long run, you can check out the National Museum of Anthropology just right behind me right there in Rizal Park. Something really interesting is at the lowest administrative level in the Philippines today is still called barangays, which probably originates from the word balangay, which are these boats that the ancient settlers used to come to these different islands, Something that you'll notice right off the bat when you come to the Philippines is that people like to smile a lot.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: And with these walls start the story of modern day Philippines So in , this Portuguese explorer who was under the directions of the Spanish crown, was trying to circumnavigate the earth for the first time.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: And he arrived on the eastern islands of the Philippines. And when he arrived, he sort of claimed the islands for Spain, which in turn started the Spanish colonization of the area By the way Magellan never made it back to Spain.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: He died in the Philippines in this dumb battle, but some of his crewmates actually managed to go around the earth and go back to Spain, eventually.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: Something really interesting that a lot of people don't know is along with Magellan on his crew, was the slave that he had bought from Malacca in Malaysia today, like ten years before that.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: And when that guy arrived in the Philippines, he spoke the local language.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: But it is a theory that he might have actually been from the Philippines.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: So this guy, Enrique, might have been the first ever person to go around the whole globe.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: It was the year and the Spanish explorer named all these islands Las Islas Filipinas in honor of King Felipe at the second of Spain.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: And that's where the name of the islands Philippines actually comes from.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: So in , Spain officially started colonizing the place from New Spain, which was Mexico at the time.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: And in , the Spanish conquistador named Legazpi came here and claimed the city of Manila as the capital of the Spanish colony, in a sense.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: And he used that to set up bars base here and formed the City Council of Manila inside the walls of where I'm standing right now.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: And he called this Intramuros, which literally means within the walls. And that is the name of the oldest district of Manila, which I'm standing in right now, which is within these ancient big walls.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: So before the Spanish came along, there was no country called the Philippines with the islands that we see today. However, there were a lot of different island nations or kingdoms, and there were settlements and a lot of the places where you have big cities today and there were just settlements that were trading with regional powers like China at the time and were big trade hubs even long before the Spanish arrived.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: And by the way, Manila, back in the day, everything was inside these walls.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: The Spanish only left the Philippines like a hundred years ago, a little bit more than that. So you see very heavy influences of Spanish colonialism, not just in Intramuros, but like literally everywhere around the country, all the places, all the streets.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: A lot of cities have Spanish names.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: The guy who sort of settled in Manila, Legazpi, has his own city named after him, which I'm probably going to in a couple of days.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: So a lot of people, like almost everyone I've met here, has Hispanic names right in the middle of Intramuros, there's a Starbucks. There's a lot of American chains here.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: I just entered Fort Santiago, which is still inside Intramuros and when I was walking in, the lady asking for tickets was talking to me in Filipino because I think I look a little Filipino, which is probably why I have like a lot of viewers, if you're watching from the Philippines, My second biggest base is the Philippines after Bangladesh.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: So thanks to all , of you who watch my videos from the Philippines on Facebook, I'll try to do justice to your country for now, I’’ll try to do justice to your city.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: So at the edge of Fort Santiago, you'll see the Pasig River, which is sort of this old river that flows through the heart of Manila.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: This goes all the way into Manila Bay.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: And once the Spanish came and sort of established Manila as the capital of their new Spanish East Indies colony, which included the Philippines, Guam and a couple of other islands, This sort of became the western hub of the transpacific trade. For the first time, there was trade being done across the Pacific from the Spanish Americas, all the way to Eastern Asia, and this became one of the world's first global cities. You know, once Manila was set up as this trade hub for the first time ever across the world, there was this uninterrupted network of trade routes that went around the whole world, starting from Spain to the Americas now to Asia and back to Europe again.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: So of course, the Spanish came and colonized the place and that lasted more than years.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: But then in , the first Filipino revolution happened.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: It lasted like two years, which ultimately led to the Spanish leaving their colony.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: But at the same time, there was the Spanish-American War in .\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: So instead of the Philippines getting independence like they were hoping for, there was instead just a transfer of colonial power. So instead of being a Spanish colony, all of a sudden the Philippines was an American colony out of the blue.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: And there was another war that broke out between the Filipinos looking for independence and the Americans.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: But you know what's interesting is that how much of an influence that period of American rule over the Philippines has over the Philippines now.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: You can see a lot of American culture when you just walk the streets from the way people dress and kind of music they listen to.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: And more than eight in ten Filipinos today actually have a positive view of the U.S.?\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: Partially, it's because of the recent political alignment between the Philippines and the U.S.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: Like American culture is a big part of Filipino culture as much as Filipino culture is a big part of American culture.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: There's like million people of Filipino descent, like Filipino Americans living in the U.S. and out of them, . million of them were in California, and a lot of them were in L.A. where I used to live. So I knew like tons of Filipino Americans.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: People would often guess that I am Filipino American because it was so common to find Filipino Americans in California. It's not just Filipinos living in America, it's also Americans living in the Philippines. I think there's more than , American citizens who reside in the Philippines right now.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: So the cultures are very connected.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: -Are you Filipino?\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: This is my second day in the Philippines.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: I don't think I have to say anything else about how friendly people in the Philippines are.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: But finally, in , the Philippines became an independent country for the first time after more than years and being ruled by three colonial empires in a sense.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: Most of them live in the South though So right in the middle of this Muslim area is the Golden Mosque, which is famous for its like huge golden dome and is the largest mosque in all of Manila metro, which can hold up to , people from what I remember.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: It's such an interesting mix of culture.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: So you see Hispanic religiosity and romance and machismo, but you also see the American influence on clothing and pop culture and Western ideals.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: And, you know, interestingly, this whole area, Metro Manila, is one of the wealthiest regions in all of Southeast Asia. So while this is a part of Metro Manila, they're also places that look like this. So in the next video, we're going to approach Manila from a different part of town and learn more about the city and its different parts.\n",
      "Video Id: 2ftG8JuMzz4, Segment: Now, let’s go to the other side of the spectrum and have a taste of the Philippines’ more challenging delicacies.\n",
      "Video Id: 2ftG8JuMzz4, Segment: In the mountainous regions of the Cordillera where the history of precolonial Philippines is still visibly felt, etag is a doorway to the past of the said region.\n",

      "Video Id: oul9IITqAoA, Segment: Police and the military tried to prevent the ships from reaching the islands, but the interception were not significantly successful Most of the ships landed on the northwest part of Luzon Island.\n",
      "Video Id: CI8PSPP9vlE, Segment: I think Philippines is few of the countries in Asia that speaks English as a second language.\n",
      "Video Id: CI8PSPP9vlE, Segment: Having them raised in a bilingual environment is a very strong merit for their child's education.\n",
      "Video Id: CI8PSPP9vlE, Segment: And then second is, because culturally they feel close.\n",
      "Video Id: CI8PSPP9vlE, Segment: And third, when I talk with my friends, many of them have a dream of retiring in the Philippines. I think, it is very nice if you have someone beside you that can help you make your dream come true.\n",
      "Video Id: vk7_uI-V_9I, Segment: the loving people caring people so we because of that a lot of people take take their week at their loving kindness and as a sign of weakness okay but when you do that you're mistaken you're making a big mistake because they're so friendly and then people say well hey I gotta take advantage now you can't these people are nice but when you cause them harm when you hurt their feelings when you cause them to lose face fac is called losing face and that term is not just limited to the Philippines it is an Eastern uh uh term Eastern country Eastern side of the world term where Eastern countries Asian countries believe in faith you can find it in Japan Thailand whatever all of these Eastern countries have that terminology of losing faith and when you're losing face man when you embarrass them you shame them they will want to get back at you and when they want to get back at you they want to get a crack at you\n",

wife I mean the the title says it all right and uh he's Singing beautifully but I'm not even going to critique his vocal ability or his ability to sing I think he was just singing to his wife he did sing beautifully though he sang he had such a beautiful voice and he sang like with so much heart oh my God I'm not okay I'm not happy right now you guys not happy with you oh my God I mean definitely thank you so much this is a beautiful uh performance we didn't pause because it's just one of those performance where it's not even a performance it's just one of those videos that you just have to sit and watch in all and obviously it broke Taylor so be crying for so long after this I know I'm sorry I mean blame YouTube they're the ones that were commenting this stuff I know I can't believe how many requests we had for this oh do you want your heart to physically break inside and like you spend your last minutes on Earth crying your eyes out go watch this and it's such thanks you guys at a funeral it's such a beautiful display too right like the flowers the the whole the coffin I don't know why I'm thinking like wow that's a nice coffin well I know you said like you wanted the camera to pan so you could see like the crowd crying but I'm wondering if this is maybe something that you know he had like a moment alone like privacy maybe before or after the funeral like with his wife and this was like maybe taken then yeah we don't know I don't know I mean if I was in that crowd live and he was doing that I would interrupt him so many times by my freaking sobbing that he would be like okay I need you out I need you to go I need get out this is me and my wife yeah I feel like this is very like something that you would want to like more of a private moment yeah I think oh my God it was beautiful that destroyed me I do want to nitpick something oh I know one thing that I couldn't get over is why is he dressed like that not in like a tuxedo or a suit for his wife's funeral and then the cynic in me is like is this all staged like did he do this purposefully trying to cuz he could be just singing to a random person person's coffin just to make a viral moment you know what I mean I would really hope not I would hope not too but like you got to think he's not American so maybe it's not in his culture for them like maybe it's not typical for them to dress up a certain type of way for funerals like I have no idea or maybe it's the viewing before the funeral so maybe he just hasn't changed I mean I don't know I would really like to think that this wasn't just for views cuz that's super shitty if it was like one of those viral moment posts that later you turn out is like that's really just the son of the funeral homeowner and he's just like in a random thing singing to it yeah you know I could see I could see someone shitty enough to Stage something like this I'm not saying they did for sure I'm not I can see it as well also if I die first and you don't do something like that at my funeral I know you can't sing like that guy can no offense but I will haunt your ass every single day of your life you'll be dead you won't know I will know I will haunt you you'll be dead you won't know I will haunt you and you're a scaredy cat so I will make sure it is extra scaredy I'm not a scaredy cat yeah anyways you guys thank you so much for sharing this with us

      "Video Id: 7zaMbzqj8AI, Segment: we're the lockwoods and we've been traveling the world to experience up close and in person all the natural wonders and distinct cultures that our kids would otherwise see only in textbooks and TV since we've been spending so much time in the Philippines and since we've been using Manila as a hub for a lot of our Asian travels and since our good friends from the mom duty Channel have moved back here and encouraged us to be their neighbors we've decided to set up a second home base here in BGC since we'll be alternating mods between here in the U.S we need to hunt for an apartment that's not too big not too pricey and not too far from our besties so let's get started imitation is the greatest form of flattery and we are copying our very best friends the ocampos at momduty because they just found their condo here in BGC after looking for a while so we're gonna meet up with them and we're gonna get all the advice we can get and we're not meeting them just anywhere we're gonna go right back to the very first place we ever met them earlier this year the Mine Museum we're recreating our first date a little bit and it's just a few blocks from where both of us are staying right now my name is Melvin and with a Nancy how are you I have like my bandana for him so he I can wipe him all day all started guys right here it all started right here but here we are on a brand new day and we're gonna meet up with momduty another YouTuber family from California and they've been living here for a couple of months we're gonna experience the Mine Museum right here Rocio Melvin and their two kids Mia and Knox and they're the same age as Colt and Brooklyn so they're getting to know each other I feel like they're growing up together all right guys we gotta pick your brains about condo shopping here because we gotta find our place now that you have found your place but who wants to do it over maybe some mimosas at brunch mimosas for brunch I don't know let's go so freaking excited to hang out with the ABC fam this whole week we're gonna take them to Dr wine it is a little spot that's actually right under where we're staying right now and we've heard really good things about it this actually isn't our first time here because the very first time we were in BGC the Ocampos took us to Dr wine repeat history repeats itself yet again ah I forgot about that I didn't know he'd been here but our own little section over here private party uh I think I'm just gonna get the same thing the ocampo's got just copy everything so flattered it's a BGC but friendly I like Philippines because it's safe and there's lots of the people who respect people so they respect the area and look how clean it is the BDC check the rules not there's not a lot of traps there so that's a couple things I like about BC there's no trash it's old that's it sold we're moving now thanks Moxie that was a great point that Knox talked about because that's also something that we value Safety First just feels so good here I it's very family friendly yeah the walkability score here is like through the roof yeah the pedestrians uh are priority number one here so you get that feel of safety and you also have that convenience so when you're going I love the fact that you can just go down and walk out out of your building and you're in and literally steps away from all these restaurants like Dr wine I mean there's about plus restaurants around us combine that with the Warmness of the Filipino people and I'm not trying to be biased here because I'm Filipino but they are very warm and welcoming that's what I love about that so you combine that with this it's amazing the warmth that you get here the community that we've been craving for so long is so welcoming we really don't feel complete here without the lockwoods it's a lockwoods must move here please don't move be our neighbors I think we would probably come here every day if we lived in BGC this would be like our meeting our brainstorm meeting would be at Dr wine would it be a good idea to work with a realtor or do we just like go around looking for listings on our own well we recommend working with the realtor saves time it's more convenient and we highly recommend JR from SW real estate he and this team are amazing they have been so great at communicating with us Non-Stop and showing us around at all the different locations so we are going to give you that recommendation all right done yeah we're just gonna copy the realtor then yes copy copy all right I guess we're just gonna toast on it you know Phil the Ocampo Woods in the BGC let's let the apartment shopping begin it definitely sounds like BGC is a pretty safe neighborhood for our fam but as non-residents of the Philippines we still really have to think about protecting our family against the same types of risks we deal with back home yeah even with the great medical facilities and doctors here we could easily bankrupt ourselves if something went wrong and we didn't have the right medical coverage safety Wings been our go-to resource for those things that seem to go wrong for us on a regular basis like the time I got appendicitis in the middle of Mexico and had to have emergency surgery or the time Cole got so sick in Vietnam that he couldn't leave the hotel for days or all the times Colt gets bit by reptiles and needs antibiotics can I like Adventure our biggest benefits with safety Wing are the medical protections for sure but we like that our policies also cover us against travel delays and interruptions lost checked luggage natural disasters and emergency evacuation and we love that whenever we need help we get connected with a helpful human being in a matter of seconds everyone knows that travel these days carries enough risk you're really just rolling the dice if you're not being proactive about protecting yourself and your family use the link in the description or just go to follow abc.com Insurance to get a quick quote from safety Wing now let's go meet our realtor first we need refreshments lemonade medium with brown sugar may I get a winter melon milk tea with round shed brown sugar tapioca pearls sugar level level uh less ice cream we gotta go bring the juices with us we'll drink on the road because we we're supposed to meet our realtor in about five or ten minutes but luckily everything is really close together we're probably only a block away from where we're going and we're gonna walk from one building to another because everything is so close together and walkable here our favorite thing to do since we've been traveling the world for three years officially now and I constantly talk about how hot and humid some of the places we travel to are I'm officially retiring that concept you will never ever hear me say that it is hot or humid again I went the wrong direction today of all days it is so hot and humid can we please just get there I knew that was gonna be an issue the only one seems to be more confused about where we're going than Erin is Google Maps just keeps changing the location changing the directions right there it says Verve residences Tower two and that is where we're supposed to be are you Jr yes yes realtor too they've hooked us up all right so we have one place to look at him here today uh yes we're gonna check out the first place we're only looking at three bedroom units th floor oh th floor get this apartment you probably get used to it pretty fast I love the positivity nice and bright hallways and smells of fresh paint built in four years old you love it I love it oh my gosh this has to be my room because you know why in our apartment that we have right now I have this in my room and I every morning like because I wake up super early I had to just go out and stare at the sky while listening to music and this would be my bathroom so would this one come furnished yes yes yeah so all the stuff here States yeah the bed there is really small really yeah you guys can never fit on that boat together without no no it's short so yeah sure it's misleading we'll have to a really good start I love this unit and right here is High Street and this is the closet hallway so there are four total I'll get three so it gets one there's just one vanity sink in here but a walk-in shower I'm guessing there aren't bathtubs all right I want to look at this kitchen real quick love the countertop it's got basically everything I need but I'm a little curious the stove is very small for the space they allotted for it I've become one of the counter but I don't cook much so I don't think it matters I think that's pretty much par for the course same in the place that we're staying right now same with the refrigerator but yeah I mean especially for the uh ocampo's neighbors we are probably not going to eat in here very often maybe breakfast sometimes lunch for the most part we're going to be eating at every restaurant in BGC yeah that's true I'm not cooking but we're off place it is listed for a hundred and fifty thousand Filipino pesos which is approximately I think it's about twenty five hundred dollars USD per month I like that it's Plug and Play TVs not just out here we've got one in the in our bedroom so two TVs I mean we really don't have to buy anything as far as Furnishings we would have to buy things like towels and linens and you know there's still things we would need but this isn't the most important part most important part is the rest of the building let's go check that out thanks a lot Brooklyn is asking us how we rate it on different levels and so she's keeping track of the score what does this one have honey . we'll have to compare that because we still have to rate the building itself the gym and the pool and those points are out of a maximum total of then right because it's four of us so we're voting yeah can you start carrying a bandana baby so you can dab my face like Rocio does for Melvin yeah freeze outside is cooler I'm gonna take a quick look at the clubhouse area right now called the function room so if we wanted to throw a huge party with you Campos or a big meet and greet this is where we could do it the over wedding this is a huge huge room there's a lot we could do in here meet and greet was the first thing I thought of there's a play area I think this is for kids I think I think she's outgrown this okay let's go all right where's this gym very important uh-oh we lost everybody also where's Colt this water is really cold that's going to be nice especially for Phil on a very hot day that feels good all right we gotta go though this is the lounge area this would be good for meet and greet also okay now this is the real pool huh it's shared with both Towers so we were in Tower two this is Tower one and they only have one really big pool right now I am specifically focused on if there are any high places I can jump from into the water here's the jam plenty of cardio four treadmills four stationary bikes dumbbells racks free weights lots of benches functional equipment checks all the boxes it'll work we'll get the job done apparently there's an upper level we gotta check out this is like an open space dance studio you could do yoga up here or practice your Tick Tock dances whatever I feel like I would come up here if I'm alone and I would do my own little workout my isolated workouts for my abs stuff like that there's a degree different well Fahrenheit there's a degree difference between upstairs and downstairs in here I'm not sure what that is in Celsius five degrees seven degrees foreign I worry about her and our schedule so what do you guys think of this building and this unit I think this is my favorite one so far it's also the only one the accomplice here's another Factor we have to consider we want to be as close to our besties as we can and they're gonna be without giving anything away about two and a half to three blocks away from here not bad we'll have to consider that after Brooklyn tallies up the scores between the three units we're gonna see the next building we're gonna see is right next door and they have a coffee shop right at the very bottom and this building is called the Meridian this is a nice cool air-conditioned Lobby th floor for this one so a little bit lower which Aaron is probably happy about apparently a lot oh so a different layout here and it feels like it's thicker it feels more open all right so what's the price on this one this one is with parking but parking is about per month which we don't need when you say what does that mean pesos so this one is a little less but this is the master bedroom we're in here and whoo got dizzy but this is a really pretty view there's a lot of Park area right in front of us can't look and then this is the third bedroom so probably Where Brooklyn would be if we have this unit and it looks like there's a balcony but just Windows no access to it how many bathrooms in this one since there's no there's no ensuite for this room is it two two bathrooms here there might be another one in the maids quarters the yaya quarters I like how the kitchen is open I like this layout another bathroom yes yes but Yaya's bathroom so some apartments have that space so a yaya which is a Mater housekeeper can live in and stay there so the next place we see it's in the same building right thank you buddy I think you're welcome cool looks very similar to The Verve oh here's the gym I would say that the gym is very similar in in quality and versatility to the last place so either or is it on or something there you go it's just got a lot of weight on it Jr what kind of deposit do they require it's a standard is too much security deposit that will be returned to you after the lease and are all these prices negotiable are they pretty set they're actually pretty set so we have one more okay one more unit we had to come back down to the lobby because it is different Tower and a different owner of the unit what floor is this one on this is um . do you like hi oh it's late lunch time oh yeah the couch is really comfy but like I feel like after a while it's gonna feel stiff yeah dining table is great this room is great look at the mirror I'm taking that by the way if we get this I'm sorry I like that this has a vanity yeah and we're missing that where we're staying right now and then this is the the Hall of closets here of purple the Ube closet now I'm hungry for dessert and these lights are interesting I like them I think they're they add character so this is culture for cleanse I don't know this is called okay and over here actually all the bedrooms have this view this is High Street right below here and our real term is telling us that it's really pretty at night when it gets lit up oh and there's the Nike store we have a view of the D billboard D billboard okay so also three bedroom two bathrooms right not counting the yaya quarters that's right which is right over there a lot of counter space again with the ranges being much smaller than the space they fit into okay so this one this is the first I've seen a washer and a dryer uh it has the yaya bathroom and this is the first time we've seen an actual bed or mattress in the yaya quarter and this unit is pesos right in the same range I think it cuts a heavy door thanks heavy all right that's actually really exciting stuff thanks for showing us pleasure to meet you guys thank you but I don't know how the timing is going to work for us or not so we'll talk thank you so much I'm gonna go from least to greatest on water favor Apartments Belize it was actually a tie between the second and the third apartment um both of them were .\n",
      "Video Id: InP5_mgUUfE, Segment: we're the Lockwoods and we're traveling the world to experience up close and in person all the natural wonders and distinct cultures that our kids would otherwise be consuming only through textbooks and TV we've left the hustle and bustle of BGC Manila and flown down to the beach city of Donsol where we're hoping to catch a glimpse of the glowing trees of fireflies and cash in a rain check for swimming with the Majestic whale sharks of the Philippines but speaking of rain we've had constant showers since stepping off the plane last night so we're hoping to attract a little luck this morning while we wait for our guide let's get to it welcome to Alicia Beach Resort in Donsol it's been an hour and a half drive to get to our Resort from the airport last night waking up here and seeing it in light is refreshing because when we came to check in it's just this dirt road there's nothing paved here so the sidewalks for the resort are just stones and our huts are pretty basic which is very typical for the hotels in this area there all boutique hotels with maybe about rooms but we have this big pool right in front of the beach and all of the rooms are basically beachfront because it's just this little u-shape all of the rooms are the same and none of them are connecting so we had to get two rooms and we are dividing and conquering a girl's room and boys room but they really do a good job keeping everything very clean we haven't seen any bugs in our room and also sadly Colt hasn't seen any geckos in his room no actually of course he found a gecko they have a restaurant on property so that's where you can get breakfast lunch and dinner and you can pay your bill at the end or with each meal service one really important thing to know about this Resort and all the resorts in this area they are cash only so bring a lot of pesos now let's talk Wi-Fi they have Wi-Fi in the restaurant only but since our rooms are really close to the restaurant we've been kind of Lucky and we get a little bit of it otherwise we're working on cellular but this is a very affordable area to stay in our rooms are about dollars per room per night so for our time here we're paying a total for two nights and two bedrooms about US Dollars it's time for the whale sharks we're gonna meet our guide and we have to take this trike to get there all four of us are gonna fit in it okay it was a very short ride it probably took about a minute and a half good morning so we start off with an orientation in here to learn a little bit more about what to expect time to get educated now out of all the phenomenal things you can do Aaron and I didn't bring our fins because they're awkward to pack and travel with for just one little Excursion so we are renting some fins here for a few bucks we already have our masks and snorkels the kids have their full snorkel set so they're all set you have to find the right fit oh look at this guy's helping us out thank you we should point out that there is statistically speaking a better chance that we won't see whale sharks today than that we will and that's because of the way they handle the interactions here in Donsol versus other places throughout the Philippines and throughout the world they do it very ethically they're not going to Chum the water to attract the whale sharks so that means there is a pretty decent chance we'll come up empty-handed but it's really all about the experience so we'll see if we get lucky today I don't know but that is specifically why we chose Donsol for our whale shark experience we wanted the most natural the most eco-friendly it's a risk but we're doing it because this is the kind of experience we want and if you want that experience too that's why we're showing you we're with Janelle he's gonna be our guide the rest of the way and in the water with the whale sharks hopefully but we're headed to our boat over here really wish us luck press that like button help us out with some good energy in the air and hopefully we can see some of these sharks these whale sharks they are this we're gonna be circling this area and we have three hours so if we don't see any whale sharks within those three hours no luck we're just going home without it but until then we are just waiting and circling so if you've been following our Channel some of you may know that when we were in Cebu last fall we had one of these excursions planned for the south of Cebu we ended up canceling that and instead opted to do the street food tour in Cebu City if you haven't seen that episode you can click up here to add it to your queue besides the fact that it was about a four hour drive from Cebu City where we were staying at our Resort down to where that was and it seemed like a really really long day we also decided that the information that we had heard about Donsol and the way that they interact with the whale sharks here was preferable to the experience that we would have had in Cebu it's almost guaranteed that you're gonna see a whale shark when you're in Cebu they throw Chum into the water to attract the whale shark so if that's what you're into it's the Boo and oslob is the place for you but for us we are risking it and that's okay with us because again like I said we're looking for the more natural experience for our family and at the end of the day worst case scenario is we have a three hour tour on a boat which we've paid over a thousand dollars to do before in various parts of the world yeah it's raining a little bit here and that takes away from a little bit of the enjoyment maybe but it's still beautiful water in a beautiful place so life could be a whole lot worse if you're wondering where the kids are they are down below here eating some snacks might as well eat some snacks while you're waiting for whale shark hopefully our luck is turning already the weather is clearing up a bit it's much nicer out now and we've got a guy Up on the Roof looking for whale sharks for us he'll be the first to spot them this is such a good lesson and perseverance or a grit because it's here with all of the rain it's it's coming in again the little chunk of blue sky that we had there for a few minutes is gone it's now grayer and Rainier than ever and it's just coming in sideways it's cold the kids are in there it'd be so easy to just say I don't think we're gonna see anything today let's turn the boat around head back and do something a little more fun playing the pool or something but always that chance so we're gonna stick to this even if it takes us three hours of standing in the rain and it's a little chilly this is not what we expected when we first signed up but it is what we expected as we got closer to the day knowing that the weather wasn't going to cooperate it's pretty much rounded up and we're coming up empty-handed unfortunately very unusual for our experiences we almost always luck out that's just the way the cookie crumbles sometimes so we're gonna get back in here probably get dried off and do a little local experience of some sort and get ready for our nighttime Firefly river tour on the plus side they are delivering us right to our Resort because we're right on the water and I guess we're just gonna get as close as we can we might need to get a little bit wet Colt fell asleep on some fishnets so come here buddy you can just head right on up there honey thank you it feels really nice out now it's not even raining here yeah but that's you know when it comes to Nature it's always unpredictable and that's what we love about it it's always changing you know Nature's a fan of our Channel always be changing one of the great things about where we're staying is that each of the room units has its own bathroom and that is not always the case for some of the hotels or Resorts that they have along this strip also they have hot showers it felt so good get warmed up and we were thinking about having lunch a couple doors down at Barracuda but since it is raining on and off we're just gonna stay here and have lunch at Alicia now it's raining so much you would think that it's the rainy season but it's not this is unusual weather for this time of year beautiful Alfresco seating by the water and I got be cool Express which is a local dish and it is meat green beans and some peppers that is delicious and very spicy the meat's really tender but the sauce it's cooked in is so delicious it's like a coconut sauce with a beef broth kind of a taste it's really yummy and I got some chicken curry I'm starving and it looks fantastic big potatoes in here I'm almost as excited about these as I'm about the chicken that's really good curry oh so these are um not like little chunks of chicken that you would just eat out right there actually still bone in so I have a little bit of work to do with mine but it'll be worth it because this is really really good I'm very impressed for such a small town and a small restaurant this is part of a tiny little Resort this food is so authentic and delicious now we're off to town we have to hit an ATM because we need more pesos we have to check out tomorrow and then we're doing our Firefly Tour on the river that is guaranteed we're not worried about that not happening today we're going to explore the downtown donsil area a little bit here this totally reminds me of our street food tour when we were with June in Cebu City walking around this is definitely a local hangout maybe we'll even find some balut in here I don't know but we're kind of exploring an indoor market right now it's starting to rain outside and can we just say again how crazy it is that it's raining as if it's the wet season even though it's not the wet season but it's just raining off and on and off and on I think that a lot of the dollars that come into the city are from the whale shark swimming until that wasn't even a thing it was just a sleepy little seaside village but scuba divers discovered the whale sharks here in .\n",
      "Video Id: 8kcD3vk12AY, Segment: hey friends Mike and Jess here and welcome to Regeneration Nation TV today we are doing something a little different we are reacting to Filipino drinking etiquette I think this is very exciting we're trying to do some different content dabble in a little bit of stuff but also learn about the cultures of the music that we've been reaction reacting to that's very interesting to us like exactly personally I'm a bartender so I'm very excited about this just because it kind of relates to my other job this came across my recommended feed because excuse me I've been you know I've been wanting to dive more into the cultures that we're reacting to learn more about it so when I saw this one I was like dude this would be so perfect to react to with you being a bartender Jess like knows so much about I get I don't want to be wrong when I say this but you know so much about alcohol so I guess you could say I know about American drinking etiquette if we have drinking etiquette I don't know but I just figured that this would be a very interesting and fun video to react to I'm excited I can't wait to see you I'm very excited as well we're getting away from a music reactions a little bit but if you do like this video leave some recommendations for more stuff like this yes we've thought about diving into different things other than just music reactions but keeping it in like immersing ourselves in different cultures yes um I love to cook so something else I've thought about is you know getting recipes from you guys and and trying to cook them you know making a video out of us trying to cook meals and and tasting it for the first time as well and uh so yeah if you have any other recipes some recipes you want to throw at us yes please because he likes to cook and I like to eat and it's a match made in heaven and I feel like the video would be amazing but anything else as well so uh yeah I'm excited for this I'm excited for this let's get into it let's do it communal drinking is a vital part of Filipino culture from the smallest birthday parties to Big Town fiestas Filipinos just can't seem to get together without having a few drinks on the table however believe it or not amidst the chaos lies and age-old Order welcome to Philippines and this is Philippine drinking etiquette okay this guy sounds Australian and I'm not Australian in the Philippines aren't that far from each other yeah um I'm wondering about his ethnicity and how he you know thought about doing this video yeah I'm interested in that maybe it's a character his face though and he yeah he's okay yeah that makes sense he is playing a character it seems like as well yeah pain drinking etiquette I love it following the opening of the bottle the tangaro also called the Gunner and one of the into the characters of the drinking culture in the Philippines assumes an important role now prior to the commencement of the festivities a small portion of the intoxicating liquid is poured into the cap then subsequently emptied onto the ground this ceremonial offering to the spirits is considered essential for a safe and devil-free session for the homies yeah you're right considered essential for a safe and devil-free session the tanguero pours the drink every time measuring the liquor okay so the tinguero is like the bartender basically and yeah you know I don't know yeah interesting the participants are not given individual glasses this is in accordance with the tradition of bagay which means a show of trust camaraderie and in these days a United willingness to enter in a coveted Russian Roulette common glass passed in a round robin sequence dude could you imagine everyone at your bar sharing the same glass that I don't think that would happen but there are a lot of people that sit at the bar and they're like alcohol kills it alcohol will kill it so I feel like there's a lot of people that'll be like alcohol will kill it a covid Russian Roulette oh my gosh that's really cool I mean the parts that he was talking about before that the camaraderie the trust yeah I like the idea of that the we've done that I mean I remember when I first started drinking this is gonna get too deep into it but we would literally open a bottle and literally pass it around like it's awful horrible you do crazy things when you're young and silly but that's absolutely right after like not even care if you're not your willingness to enter in a coveted Russian Roulette as drinkers share a common glass passed in a round robin sequence that's cool it is frowned upon to take a pass but when a drinker is excessively intoxicated a substitute from within the group must consume the short in the drinker's place without affecting his or her own turn to maintain okay so it doesn't affect their own turn so they have to take their friends and someone else's you gotta take what that's the definition of taking one for the team man somebody's got to do it it's a hard job serious without affecting his or her own turn sequence it is customary post an assumption to return the shot glass to the center of the table will hand it directly to that tangero to be refilled for the next Drinker what it's chicken oil yeah please let us know in the comments I've never seen a packet of chicken oil like that I've heard of chicken being cooked in oil but not chicken oil hmm oh my gosh the composition of every drinking session varies however it is important to familiarize oneself with these characters has to be aware of their characteristics the Drunken Master a legend gifted with immunity from inebriation usually left with the task of cleaning up after all is said and done The Walking Dead these creature's will to stay conscious despite consuming overwhelming amount of alcohol is commendable and allows it to continuously engage with the group I'll be it for me sudden disappearances it leaves unnoticed bringing with it its share of the bills the usual catalysts of trouble it turns aggro and overconfident with every shot but that might be my mom sorry Mom this is so she's the werewolf it's literally breaking down every single Patron that I've seen at the bar they have a name dude you shouldn't send this to your other bartender you can start oh we got a werewolf over here we got a werewolf oh my God it turns aggro and overconfident with every shot the concert queen or King oh my a frustrated vocalist this creature bogarty karaoke machine in its quest for validation you're sleeping okay someone said that Roland abante they like them uh they prefer him when he's drinking and does karaoke I'm not sure we haven't got to that reaction yet I'm not sure if there's a video of him out there drinking while doing karaoke or something but I did see that comment I thought it was funny and now this makes me think of him he's the concert King oh I want to see that he doesn't need recognition though he doesn't need uh validation a frustrated vocalist this creature bogarty karaoke machine in its quest for validation the Sleeping Beauty with its loan tolerance for alcohol this creature lacks the ability to stay conscious with its introduction in its bloodstream because it is immobilized early on in the session the Sleeping Beauty is the primary target for embarrassing photo I'm such a lightweight and when we start I haven't I don't really drink that often but man when we first started dating I did get my face doodled a few times you did that's so crazy you helped I did help I'm sorry I didn't just doodled myself put makeup on him that's what it was I'm so bad but I mean I guess I deserve it for being a Sleeping Beauty you're the first one to fall asleep I'm the primary target primary target for embarrassing photos and unwarranted pictures of it too the runner the one task with the acquisition and Logistics of essential supplies to perpetuate the drinking session such as ice and booze one privilege of the runner is that it is able to choose the food it likes to be consumed by the group along with the alcohol you see for Filipinos no drinking session is complete without the accompaniment of food yeah usually use the greasy and fatty variety this is called and it comes from the filipino word meaning to pick up now it is acceptable for drinkers to grab small bites in between shorts what is that are those little like bits of rib or something uh it's some kind of meat but it looks delicious it looks so good even that little like bowl of something yeah that looks so good this is to remove the bitterness from the alcohol as well as prolonged intoxication as the food is hoped to slow down the alcohol from entering the bloodstream it is unacceptable however to consume the pollutant with rice as it is meant to be shared and not to be hoarded and treated like a meal in the event that's interesting all right all right I'm loving this dude this is very cool you can't have your own little plate you gotta just pick it up and eat it and share it with the rest okay I like that I like that I do like it and not to be hoarded and treated like a meal in the event that grease or fat is unavailable inexpensive nuts and chips are usually the viable Alternatives including some Boon out of creative Ingenuity like the tuna and Kanto crackers okay what that's the fancy stuff right there he literally put some elbow grease into it literally you can't tell me that you haven't had friends over and you're like I don't have anything in my fridge and you just whipped something else you literally just come up with something yeah I've done that a couple times I'm judging too harshly you're right though like you're when you're young I feel like when you're younger you don't care as much and like you you just get away with it and your friends are like wow this is awesome it's just because I don't drink as much anymore if I was drinking even at my age now and there was nothing else to eat I'd be elbow chopping some crackers you get creative something you would you do think of it you just get creative this is hilarious I've seen foreign cheese the clinking of glasses and the partaking of a shared beverage containing every participant's DNA is meant to honor old friendships celebrate new ones and in certain situations possibly avert oneself from being violated with a sharp piece of metal designed to break up ice that was so good that was so funny that was an awesome video that was very very fun and entertaining and educational as well yeah definitely I always every time we learn a little bit more about a culture uh it's like I want to adopt some of those things into my own life yeah and that is definitely that had a lot of those things well you already have the butt crack going for you so there's that hey they didn't need to know that they didn't they did not need to know that I don't need to know it either other people gotta share it with me sorry I already get enough crap from our sons for my crack showing sometimes okay I didn't need you getting in that was very entertaining and I couldn't believe like I love when you see different uh cultures like have we have similarities we do have similarities like when we get together we have a party we don't necessarily drink out of the same cup I mean depending on how much you drink at one of them sometimes you definitely do sometimes you just don't you just but it's not a it's not a necessity you know yeah if it was that would be I would not mind that sitting around a wooden table seems very familiar to me yeah just having a good time with friends and having like this communal time yeah just sounds so much cooler like you're not doing your own thing I would have a harder time with it because it's it's against tradition to turn down the drink and I'm like I I baby my drinks I get made fun of for it so much I baby my freaking drinks and I disappear here and I will pour one out sometimes and I'll come back like yeah I'm done I drink it how where's y'all's at I drank all of it I couldn't get away with that stuff here okay that's not good yeah you'd be right there all eyes on you you can't yeah Sleeping Beauty oh my goodness and like certain friend groups you get here it's definitely if you fall asleep first or if you pass out you're going to get messed with yep you're the one with the facial Doodles for sure yep but some friends are not like that but to know that it's like a common thing it's just like man I'm it makes me stressed out I can't go to the Philippines and drink with y'all man I would be in trouble yeah you would be I wonder when I would be able to go back in there and look at my drinking style I'll have to go check it out I feel like you're the first one the very first one the uh the Drunken Master the Drunken Master yeah right you can hold your alcohol okay I probably would be in charge of the cleanup later though because I probably would be exactly you're all responsible and stuff even when you're drinking it's crazy let's clean it up let's get it get it the best that's hilarious that was so freaking that was fun I look forward to more videos I hope uh people have some uh links in the comments below because uh that was really fun hopefully this spurred an idea in you of something to send us yeah if you've seen anything like this even if uh you're not one of our Philippine friends right now and you're watching this something from your culture as well we're interested in diving into every culture yeah definitely no limit to other cultures yeah and yeah about the food thing don't forget send me some recipes you got to tell me what to buy so I can trying to whip these creations up I can eat it I want to eat it I really want to know what they were eating we need some communal eating around here we do that would be fun all right friends we'll see you on the next one bye friend peace\n",

      "Video Id: aYxT9tCrADc, Segment: in this video I'll be giving you things you must do in Siargao this is your Ultimate Guide to the beautiful island in the Philippines the island is located in the south east of the country and is an absolute paradise and is known as the surfing capital of the Philippines you will most likely arrive at the Del Carmen Airport in Siargao Island and once you touch down there you'll get a shared minibus to your hotel this costs pesos per person if you are located in general Luna if you don't know me I'm John I spent over two weeks exploring the beautiful Tropical Paradise of Siargao and I'm going to give you so much valuable information so before we start just please hit the Subscribe button it really does help me out so let's start with number one and that is come to Siargao wake park the Wake Park is located just a minute ride from the general Luna town and honestly it is one of the funnest activities you can do on the island the Wake Park has literally been cut out of the palm trees and it looks so insane especially at Sunset even if you're a beginner or you're Advanced they take anyone and honestly if you've just started like me and Emilia had you can even stand up in your first session it was also insane just watching the pros do their things with their flips and all their tricks Emilia absolutely killed it out the wakeboarding I think I still need some practice though he did say I was a bit of a pro so I was quite proud of myself it is such a cool sport and we kind of want to do more of it now let's move on to number two and this is probably one of the biggest reasons people come to the island and that is surfing there are so many different surf spots all over Xiao gal right up into the North and also down south there are so many different surf lessons surf instructors surfboards to hire whatever you're looking for you can find it on this island if you're a beginner Surfer or an advanced Surfer there's different waves and different beaches you can go to which will fit your difficulty or whatever it is now number three is an epic sport where you could do big rock jumps and you can chill on the beach it's such a cool spot the name is like I've tried pronouncing this thing a hundred times and I still can't do it so please forgive this spot is absolutely legendary and is so fun that you can only go here at low tide look up on the Internet and look when the low tide is you have to walk around the side of the beach and then you go to these Rock pools and you'll see locals and other tourists jumping off the Rocks into the water and it is pretty deep and the water is so blue and super clear the best way to get to this spot is by scooter and once you get there it's an entrance fee of pesos per person I think there's also a parking fee of like or pesos as well if you want to jump off the Rocks I would highly recommend bringing water shoes because the rock is super sharp once you finish jumping off the cliffs I highly recommend just chilling on the beach is a beautiful beach one of my favourite in Siargao also I don't know how to say Siargao sharagao shigal what is it I'm really struggling here I've said it too many times now the next spot is the palm tree Viewpoint again this is a super popular spot and you can kind of see how many palm trees are on shower girl there's basically a big flat layer in the middle and just gazillions of palm trees it's a cool spot to take an Instagram shot it doesn't take long maybe like minutes there and you're pretty much done this isn't the only spot there are so many different cool tropical palm tree roads a long Siargao so stop off take some photos get those Instagram shots if you don't already follow me on Instagram because that's where you get the live updates for what we're doing and yeah why haven't you already moving on to number five and that is Cloud this spot is super cool and it's basically one of the best surf spots in the world so if you want to watch the pros then you can there's a big broad walk unfortunately last year in Typhoon Odette it actually got destroyed so they're currently rebuilding it but hopefully by the time you get there it's back to what it used to be the waves there are super super large so if you are a beginner maybe stick to the smaller waves but honestly it's such a cool place just a chill on the beach loads of people gather there at Sunset and it's just a great atmosphere apparently to get into the Cloud area you have to to pay a hundred pesos per day per person but that money apparently is going towards building the broad walk also at Cloud Nine you can rent loads of surfboards there's loads of surf instructors if you are a beginner so the next place you have to go to in sagao is the cave pool and this is a much less touristy spot than other spots in shout out and I highly recommend it still because it's super fun it costs pesos per person and that comes with a guide but also you should probably tip the guide on top so this activity goes through a cave and you can actually see Bats inside and then at the end you can do super cool jumps and go on a rope swing this spot is not far from some other spots which I'm going to be telling you later in the video the number seven is a super cool activity which I think is a must and probably one of the top five things you have to do on the island and that is sugba Lagoon this place is like no other it's like Roger ampat in Indonesia it is absolutely beautiful the water is so clear it's just like a cool jungle fill almost like mountains in the sea it's awesome there's also a super cool jump spot where you can go up the dive board we went on a private boat and I think it costs like two thousand three thousand pesos for the private tour I will check that and put it down below you can drive there by yourself or go on a Land Tour which does loads of different spots and that will be a cheaper option for you if you're on a budget we rented a paddle board and paddled around the islands through the water and it even rained and it was super tropical and just epic epic Vibes one of my favorite spots on the island definitely check it out moving on to number eight this activity is one of the only places you can do this in the entire world and that is swim with jellyfish we just got into a Jellyfish lake and we're surrounded by jellyfish which is crazy and no you're not gonna get stung these jellyfish are actually stingless and so you can touch them and they'll literally touch you and you don't get hurt I don't even know why this is true but it is super cool and such a weird experience honestly getting in the water we were pretty scared we were like are they gonna sting but it's all right it's good fun but weird the Jellyfish lake is located in sahoten Cove and so you have to do that as a package tour I'm going to be telling you about southern Cove a bit later in this video right let's talk a little bit about transport and how to get around if you're looking to get around the best way is buy a scooter it just gives you the most freedom and if you want to rent a scooter the best way to do that is to ask your hotel they might rent them themselves or they can point you in the right direction we rented ours for pesos a day you know if you're on a bit more of a budget you can probably get it for pesos a day so if you're not confident on a scooter you can use the classic Filipino tricycles which are super cheap and a great way to get around and again if you want to do the tours you can do land tours and that prevents you having to go on a scooter if you're not confident on a bike don't push yourselves be careful and wear your helmet number nine come eat dinner at Kermit they've got amazing cocktails amazing food and even better dessert you are not going to be disappointed Kermit is a resort and a restaurant and honestly it has some of the best food on the island if you like pizza if you like pasta then you're going to be in for a treat we had an amazing pizza at this restaurant and also we tried like this seafood linguine pasta and it was Unreal I think it might have been the best pasta dish I've ever tried they've also got cocktails Gym Bar they've got a big old Pizza Oven they've got everything so if you like food check it out also if you are into yoga then you should do the yoga sessions at Kermit Amelia did them and said they were super cool with an epic area where you can look over their new pool spot number is a spot which doesn't have many tourists on it and there's two epic beaches near super Lagoon now I'm gonna be honest I don't know how to pronounce these so please give me a break but I'm gonna give it a go for you pamo round Beach which is actually part of the super lagoon area and then Kawahagan Island and these beaches are absolutely beautiful the Kawa Kawahagan island is actually has a sandbar and it is super beautiful super clear blue water and honestly from the Drone it looks even better from both of these beaches you can actually eat and there's a restaurant so you can have a full day there chilling and you can get boats here from the Dell Carmen Port now moving on to the next one number this spot is super super popular it is like the picture of Siargao and the spot that everyone knows about before they go and that is the rope swing to get into this spot it only costs pesos and it is super super fun Unfortunately they don't have the rope swing anymore but they've built this like wooden kind of jump spot and so you can jump into the river but be careful because it is not actually that deep on the river it is super cool just along this River because there's palm trees either side the other thing you can do here is actually get a little boat which is super low to the water and you go to like this secret little Lagoon and once you get there there is like little pigs there to go on the little boat ride to the secret Lagoon it costs pesos for the boat now moving on to number this is a place I promise to tell you more about and this is so Sohoton Cove this place is magnificent but do be warned it is a far away from General Luna I think it took us like two hours to get there and then it's like I think it took us three hours to get back because of the wins and stuff so just be prepared for an uncomfortable long ride on the boat and you will get wet so maybe bring a waterproof bag it costs quite a bit of money especially for Filipino standards and it costs pesos per person this obviously includes everything so all the fees all the transport as it is very far but is well worth it this is where you get to go to the Jellyfish lake which I told you about earlier and you basically go on a little boat tour around the island you also get amazing buffet lunch with so much food you won't be able to eat it all and then you go to a couple of other spots as well we even saw a little Stingray which was pretty cool even though this trip is quite expensive I do recommend it swimming with the jellyfish going around this Raja Ampat kind of area it is so cool and worth the money I'll leave a link down in the description to go on that tour now I'm going to recommend somewhere else that you should eat if you're in Siargao and that is Kurvada's this place is always super busy and honestly when they run out of food they run out of food it's basically like a buffet style place and you can choose so many different food Filipino food but they also do like pasta they even do brownies there is so much choice and honestly I don't know how they do it but every dish just tastes so so good the other great thing about this place it is super cheap and affordable so if you are on a budget as a Backpacker then I recommend coming here now number is not a super cool thing to do but one of the things to do is to just chill out at the end of the day you are on a super chilled surf Island Vibe so if you want to just go to the beach you just want to chill out in some of the super cool cafes get smoothie bowls all day then you can do that don't feel like pressured to always do loads of stuff whilst you're traveling because honestly traveling can be quite exhausting now this is probably the most popular tour to do on Siargao and that is the island hopping tour the Philippines is famous for its island hopping tools that this one is super cool and quite unique so each island is kind of different first of all you've got Naked island and if you don't know no you are not naked on that island it's just bear there is nothing on it but sand is basically a sandbar there's also Daku Island and Guyam Island and highly recommend checking these out because it is cool who doesn't love island hopping in the Philippines having an epic buffet lunch you're gonna love these islands now number is head right up north to the untouristy part of the island once you go past the rock pools on the island there's not as many tourists the locals are super friendly on help you out this island is covered in palm trees and you'll be able to go to beaches and be the only ones on them there's one beach you should check out is that that is Algeria Beach right up the north west north east and then there's also a waterfall which is the only waterfall on the island which we didn't go to but I think you should if you're there for quite a while now number is the last thing you should do in Siargao but I'm actually can just give you loads of tips also there are loads of hostels in shower gown so if you're on a budget there's loads of surf hostels and places you can meet loads of people also don't worry about ATMs there are loads of ATMs on the island also remember shower gal isn't super developed but it is developing fast this is going to be the new Bali hopefully it doesn't go too far because this place is so so beautiful right now but hopefully it won't be destroyed by mass tourism guys if you've got any questions about shout out please leave them in the description and if you live in Siargao or you've been to Siargao please feel free to answer any questions or recommend other things to do on this beautiful tropical island of shower girl thank you so much for watching please before you go before you go just hit subscribe it helps us out to keep traveling sharing these videos giving you advice

begins a new trip so today we are here in Coron already so in next few days we're gonna explore around coron and El Nido to show you guys some of the best landscape around so I know Coron and El Nido is very famous for Limestone close like the ones in Krabi in Thailand and also like beautiful clear blue water and that's about it because my family from Hong Kong is actually coming to visit us in the Philippines and we're meeting up in coron so my father actually flew in yesterday from Hong Kong and then after that my brother he actually flew in from Australia Melbourne to uh come and join us on this special trip for them super long trip but uh it's Alina's first time meeting them as well so yeah she's never met my father and my brother before so it's gonna be nervous to meet your family it's so exciting yeah I think you're the best girlfriend that's met my family so it's gonna be quite interesting yeah to be honest I'm me too and first time meet with like my boyfriend family oh really yes first time and it's also this is my first ever time vlogging from my family so it's gonna be quite interesting experience especially speaking English in front of them because usually back at home in Hong Kong we spoke in uh Cantonese but after years of living in Australia and also traveling now my first language is English so it's actually my fluent yeah Cantonese anyway um I believe when we arrived here so they were asking for a lot of hotels and we were told that we cannot ride tricycles from the airport to our hotel because it's around kilometers so it's quite far away but anyway um you've got a list of hotels here so basically when you arrive you just need to say we are from say like this hotel and then they will have a direct shuttle bus shuttle van if you don't tell them Hotel they won't let you go yeah and also you'd pay so for entrance yes so to enter Quran just then as you saw there was an environmental fee of pesos per person per person yeah per person and after that the shuttle here condo driver I thought it was free but no you have to pay per person again so anyway I think it's around the same price as tricycle so it's not that much of a big difference and just now just now we fly and our plane don't have conditions so we don't have icons so it was so hard they even say they even say we approach in advance that your aircraft's gonna be really hot but in the as it could be cooler but it was so hot just now it was a small flight as well it's only rows so the flight was going like like this so a bit uh scary anyway our minivani is here so um let's head out onto it and unless I go to the hotel you're nervous no I'm nervous of course I'm nervous it's okay don't worry my family is very nice I think last few few years I've become in in introvert yeah don't worry just uh tell them some Russian words and they'll be so happy okay okay all right so well welcome to coron luckily here I have icon yeah luckily he have aircon right how does this work okay ah like this so the egg one doesn't go away what does that mean yeah it's a normal transport Transportation like we don't we have buses but usually we use gazelka minivans these are called minivans yeah yeah it's like a Russian Japanese with the aircon version oh never mind around like pesos pesos is around the same price right I'm so excited to meet my father and my brother yeah speaking of uh while we're waiting for other passengers honestly I'm gonna talk about some background stories so I haven't actually met that uh met up with my father for the last five years just because coronavirus at the start and then after that it was just oh wait before that was two years not mad not meeting him and after there was coronavirus like in total five years I haven't seen it already only uh video call and my brother I met him seven months ago so yeah that's you um yeah it's going to be quite interesting for Alina amazing to see how they different or the same be family with brother how like they behave yeah My Brother Talks a lot just heads up my brother is going to talk to you a lot okay it helped me improve my yeah exactly um because Alina has been saying my English is so basic so yeah now I understand everything but I think on the drivers yeah he's waiting for other passengers to think so uh yeah I think here in Plano one they don't speak Tagalog so they speak a different language actually so yeah maybe they'll understand but um they don't speak Tagalog here I believe because I know around the Philippines there are so many different languages I don't know what they called here the language palawanis I don't know let's anyway let's try to learn some new words today and uh something that's similar to it okay hello yes hello how are you yes oh so only looks like the only uh passengers yeah yeah that's good yeah I get some rest then I think I think now now we're gonna um yeah because our flight was one one o'clock this time anyway now we're heading to the hotel so um yeah see you guys at the hotel yeah the landscape here is just absolutely all right so after around minutes we're here we're driving so long yeah careful I don't know how to

      "Video Id: LtXiRN0P2VY, Segment: right now we are in Makati in Manila, the capital of the Philippines actually Makati is the financial center of the philippines many people they travel for business or even for holidays they stay in Makati that's why we chose to stay in Makati but it is so close to Greenbelt Greenbelt is one of the main attractions in Makati and we are going to check it It is near Christmas and there is a Christmas tree. if you haven't watched the previous videos go and check it, we have been in different part of Philippines and I think Makati is totally different from any part of the Philippines It is modern with high buildings but the other cities like Coron or Cebu we had different experience go and check it We were diving and as you can see I am a bit sick and I was suffering from flu I got better but I still am not hundred percent back I want to use my time in Makati, so let's go here there is no zebra crossing and we were watching other people how they cross and they just cross like this and we should do the same we found out that in Greenbelt there are various options of restaurants You can find Filipino's food or even international food and I found a Persian restaurant it is also good for shopping and the environment is really nice. It is so beautiful and now we are out of Greenbelt and apparently we are on a bridge we are going to another mall I like how they built this place It is so cool and fun though I think you're going to another mall You know when you go a mall in the Philippines or any indoor public places like hotels you should pass through security gates I think this is the case in all the Philippine We also experienced this is Cebu we were walking inside the Greenbelt and actually found the fun part of it we are trying to play some games these cows are so cool. actually the first time I saw them I didn't realize that they are just artificial and for your safety don't climb them I'm going to see if she is scared of me or not as I said there are many options here to have food and even not just food, coffee or anything since it is launch time and we are hungry we just chose randomly a restaurant to eat it looks cute and they had pasta, Pizza, salad, seafood and a lot desserts. we ordered pasta but this pasta I never had it before it is made with Dory fish I had pasta with Salmon but never had it with Dory I am going to try it here Bruno is lucky that he got his pasta which is a smoked salmon pasta with the cream I don't know why I didn't get my food I think the guy brought the food gave my foot to another table yeah I got my food I'm going to try and see how it it's really good it's with saffron it was worth waiting Bruno!\n",

I'm excited for this one okay oh contest all right let's have a little taste in this one nice very good thank you we were planning on eating but he was just like try it yes all right so we have now got our starter we've got our dessert the main all we need is the drink oh let's go let's go what's what's inside potato fish fish lost this one fish as well potato oh vegetable can I have um this one but it says five piece for Ringgit um can I mix yes oh can I get um three and two five pieces mix oh yeah spicy spicy yes very spicy combination no taste only you can found during Ramadan no oh is there any opportunity then so I gotta do it we're certainly during Ramadan you gotta do it we won't do it for the experience yeah hello what's the most popular this formula is this is the most popular yeah yeah can I try this one Tai Chi thank you okay so we've got the tea I have never seen orange tea before so I'm excited to try that wow and we've got so much food guys we've got way more than what we were expecting but everything just looks so nice it smells nice as well right now we're gonna take it back and try everything but yeah we've got so much for you guys I'm so excited to try it all and I think we've never tried majority of it as well okay so we so we are condo and there's nothing else to say we just need something you just need to dig in to be honest let's start we're going to start off with Roti John that's what I love about Malaysians you know because they're they're very friendly yes they're all asking like where we're from and they were so good at like helping us yes what to pick as well let's start this one so a lot of the locals were saying that they only sell some of the things to Ramadan so that kind of makes it feel like a really good cultural experience and we've never experienced a Ramadan before this is actually our first time trying Rottie John this type of bread and omelette some chicken lettuce some spring onions and lots of sauce a lot a lot of sauce I've noticed that in Malaysia they love sauce like you're a saucy Saucy Nation um how is it not nice sweet chili sauce it's not too spicy as well and the bread the bread is just so soft this is nice it's really nice it was a big mouthful it was delicious honestly I wasn't expecting to um like that as much as I do because I thought it'd just be kind of like a sandwich but it's really flavorful it doesn't feel like bread I know it is bread it looks like bread but I'm not getting bread Vibes I mean we've got lots more we've got lots more to try can we try this because it's right in front of me I've been eyeing this up since we left so this is a vegetable spring roll we've had vegetable spring rolls before but let's see how this is cheers good crunch oh wow it tastes different not really at all I like not only there's I thought there's going to be greens I'm not sure what kind of vegetable this is right so uh maybe it's cabbage leave a comment Down Below guys what this is um because it's a hard workout do you try the sauce as well it's really good hey there's loads it's not that spicy I don't know yeah um it's a bit hot I thought all spring rolls would taste the same but actually that's got a different taste to it I mean I love that I'm not sure what this one is potato oh yes sir Samosa it's like it looks like that's so true okay let's go oh my God that's my favorite so far wow it's got like some kind of flavoring around the potato mmm that's so nice we should have got more of this coated in some kind of um it was really good I might just go back tomorrow like the combination of things I'm tasting right now is just incredible have you eaten the whole thing already yeah well done I'm telling you I'm hungry should we go to the vein yeah yeah all right so now my favorite part we actually had one on the plane last night it was quite funny the packaging said best last evening I highly doubt that the airplane one is the best one but hopefully this is gonna be better so if you don't know what national map is it's basically um the Malaysian national food and it is coconut rice piece of meat you can either be chicken or beef you've got your and anchovies anchovies nuts nuts and what's this um cucumber cucumber eggs and what's this fish it's actually come on a banana leaf and they were so good because everyone was kind of serving themselves but we didn't really know about how it was meant to how it's meant to work and they were so nice they just did it for us and they were like explaining everything so it's so good and I got this big piece of chicken here look how big that chicken is what's so nice about Nasi Lemak as well is I'm not sure what it is but it has this kind of like really crispy almost hairy coating but it's like almost like flakes of something um chicken is amazing it's so flavorful oh my word that's really good that's better than the other two we've had best Nasi Lemak I've had so far the rice is amazing as well so good there's so many different flavors I can taste coconut I can taste lemongrass I can taste like all these different spices and herbs on the chicken really juicy these sort of flavors I've never just a lot of flavors just going on but they're the sort of flavors I'm just I've never really had that often and the rice is just insane not too spicy either yeah the one that they um on the plane yesterday so he was like so spicy it's so spicy give the video a like if you're getting hungry watching us eat do you want some nasty lamac you know the food is good if I'm not talking that much yum can't stop the rice is just so nice any locals want to tell us kind of like how you do Ramadan uh give us a little bit more information because we've done a little bit of research on Google but it basically just tells you the very simple facts I'm enjoying it though I like trying all these different things and everything was pretty good price as well I think oh it's the best part it's time for some sweet sweet desserts so since we already tried this time we should try it first so we didn't mean to try it the guy was like please try it try it so he tried it honestly describe it it's like a bad name yes it looks like a bird's nest look at that it's like what even is that um smells so good as well ready Cheers Cheers wow that's so good and the texture is so strange but I love it it's kind of so crunchy but so it's so thin so subtle and it just kind of breaks in your mouth it's crumbly I wonder what it is it's so cool I don't even know the name to Google it I wonder what flavor this is this is pistachios it's pistachio I'm not really keen on pistachio but let's see um good wow no it's so crunchy I love this wow I don't know why we haven't tried this on our first time here last year I've never seen it is this only during Ramadan as well guys I tried it was amazing um yum it's one of my favorite desserts ever so you can have it every day if you want once a day pancake now we did actually the last time we were here but let's this one's different it's got sweet corn in it is that on purpose or did that just accidentally cut I'm not sure get in here cheers that's so strange it was nice dude wait yeah yeah there's a sweet corn in it we got the um the Nutty filling you can get chocolate and get some as stuff this is so strange I can't get over the sweet corn it's really sweet and then you've just got this corn flavor but it's nice the pancake's really good as well really fluffy all right so to finish it off we got this one here I literally just saw it and I was like so cute it's kind of like a mousse it looks like something that was like a liquid that's now dried um said it was coconut and oh like a spoon so it's like a mousse it smells nice is it in a Banana Leaf I can't remember what it's called oh this is like nothing we've ever had before is it good that's so good oh that's good that is nice it's not too sweet as well it's just perfect it's not rich yeah I can't believe there's not a single thing that I haven't thoroughly enjoyed like every single thing we've tried has been like out of good like there's not been anything it's just been like oh it's okay that's all been really good Malaysia just seems like a Foodies Paradise honestly the flavors are just incredible finish mine already anyway we've had such a good time today I really enjoyed interacting with the locals I just found it so wholesome that that first the first three they really they're so Lively as well they're so nice and they were really interested in like Czar and then Zar was obviously interested in him because at first I couldn't tell if he was joking or not because like they were all just shouting out they were like telling us to go around the store and then they're gonna show us how they how to cook the Roti John yeah they put inside it oh we forgot the drink and oh yes but we're gonna hold it there because we actually forgot to show you the Thai tea that we got so you can actually get this for just five ring it if you get it in a cup but because we're taking it away we thought it'd be better to get it in the bottle so this was actually tendering it so a little bit more pricey I would drink out of this we're in a glass might as well couldn't get from there I don't know what makes it orange me and Zoe were not we're not a big fan of tea despite the fact We're British we are actually we don't drink tea very often but I can appreciate tea though it smells like chocolate does it oh that is nice is it sweet um is it sugary it's a very small hint of tea yes it's very milky but I like that I like that it's like a subtle tea because like I said we're not big tea drinkers I find it a bit too strong but this that is nice a very wheat chocolate no it tastes like tea I drink that like that's nice but anyway guys hopefully you like the video if you did make sure to hit that like button and leave a comment down below press that subscribe and press

So we're like the big thing to do in El Nido besides kind of cruise around explore like the island life is to go to all of the surrounding islands do boat trips, so there's like four different types of boat trips you can do and maybe I'll explain that to you in another video but like you know they're all like full day boat trips because there's so many islands in the El Nido area. So basically unfortunately because we did not get the opportunity to go on today's one that's one of the full sets of islands that we won't get the opportunity to explore.

to add to your playlist spotify amazon apple our brand new album is out now on all of them and more without further ado you ready all right let's do it okay there goes my heart beating cause you are the reason i'm losing my sleep please come back now there goes my mind raising and you are the reason but i'm still breathing i'm hopeless cause i oh wow oh very clear if keeping you safe her runs her runs are so clear yeah like and i mean a lot of people do those really really amazing runs but it's like it's like they're disjointed yeah i don't know like you know what i mean like i think about like looking at it and it's just like you kind of have like the dips but like hers are just like dude and she can do things with her voice that's just this doesn't make sense yeah and it's just her control she yeah she has optimal control amazing control also his voice uh is just fantastic and when i when you look at him you're like oh i didn't you know just the way yeah his voice sounds like yeah sometimes yeah like there are a lot of people that will surprise you where like they opened up their mouth and you just like i always think i go back to felix from straight kid with a deep voice where like when he opens another yeah exactly you're like no way oh my god okay okay me dude and some of those runs hitting in there with the harmonies what you right there i'm back i was just i could not i couldn't i couldn't it was too good couldn't not couldn't i had to move a little bit sometimes when things were amazing you just gotta move to i wanna i'm gonna go back i wanna go harmonies like when they first came in yeah it was like and they were like doing the runs with the harmonies yeah i wanna yeah i wanna okay i wanna go wild wild cause that's where did we where do we come in on the harmonies i think like here he's a wild boy for that one right there here i'll climb every morning okay dude so wild their voices are like meant for each other yeah really yeah yeah yeah but doing intricate runs like that is hard enough as an individual singer doing those runs and hitting them in harmonies in perfect timing like there's a re there's a reason why like generally it's solo artists that will do stuff like that or only sing parts on their own you don't harmonize parts like that you you don't unless you are a very high level vocal like like hey if they're not the next aladdin and jasmine like okay you know because like that those vote the way they fit together you know what i mean i'm not saying that you know i'm just saying right the way that the vocals fit together like that it was just like they both have a very soulful quality yeah like his voice is has that warmth to it like that very mid-range warmth and she has she's fluttering all ball around the clouds like dude i don't know much about him not only i kind of i'm curious to hear more about him too his voice was higher yeah really really good higher wow okay never ceases to amaze me with her like of all the stuff i i i really i had asked in a previous video that i did i don't know that i've checked the comments on it yet because it just came out but i'm really curious i don't think we've heard anything original by her yet yeah maybe she's just not and maybe she doesn't i don't know but if there is original stuff please please uh tell us dude in the comments she's she had gotten her teeth done her

      "Video Id: 2TmagN6RhkI, Segment: hello everybody my name is katrinka i'm a professional singer and a vocal coach and welcome back to my channel today i'm gonna be reacting to another of your really heavily expected recommendations and it's gonna be regina velazquez now i hope that i'm pronouncing her name correctly because she's been very heavily requested from what i've understood she is one amazing vocalist and she is up there with like a thripple of katrina velard and maury said and other fantastic singers today we're gonna be reacting to our gabi live on wish if you would like to see the whole performance don't forget to check the description of the video and there's gonna be the link to the original video and yes don't forget to subscribe our new upload schedule is up on the youtube banner and i'm also coming back to my streams i'll be streaming on wednesdays and on sundays check the streaming schedule in the description of my video there's also gonna be what we're gonna be doing on the streams so you can look forward to them and now without any further ado miss regine velasquez let's get into this i swear to god if she's gonna be just like another one on the same level i'll be jealous and she's also pretty shocked oh i love when they sing in their original language it has completely different atmosphere the melody is very addictive like i feel like already it's very well memorable oh beautiful the melody is very dominant and it's very memorable but it's still the way she sings it i feel like she's reciting even though there's a lot of melody in it but the way she delivers it's a very high-based song even though it doesn't look like that on the first side but she push and pull and she's just going it's incredible she doesn't even do big breath pauses just to keep the fluency of the storytelling that she's making in the song and what is really wonderful is that she's so fluent that you cannot even hear her switches from her chest voice to her mix it's just one beautiful stream it's incredible i love it very intricate you can tell beautiful ending of the princess um the very high high tone i think okay so what i'm absolutely swept away with is how fluent she is there is no visible switches between her registration whatsoever like you cannot hear them they are there because she is going fluently from one to another but as she's doing it's just so it's invisible it's completely invisible you feel like she's not switching at all but she is switching but just completely fluently at the very beginning she was just switching between her chest voice and her mix but now it's also up to falzetto like a very high falsetto that was a little visible but that was also a huge jump and she finished it with a beautiful full head voice it's very obvious that her voice is very mature it's finished it's done it's perfection it's really really beautiful kind of a voice and i'm really enjoying her whole technique is just so intriguing and delicate it's incredible you can also tell there's no nervousness in her whatsoever she's completely cool collected foreign oh beautiful run wonderful run look at her she's just such a jolly person very pretty one memorize the tune she's very relaxed like you can tell she's not just mentally very relaxed she is in a very calm collected place she's not stressed she's not tense whatsoever she's even like switching her sitting positions which is very typical for a wish but someone in the last video that i reacted on which someone told me that they have to sit because a lot of times they're actually in a moving bus which is then absolutely understandable why they sit but for belting it's really way more difficult than uh standing up her belts are effortless she has everything extremely relaxed and uh yeah i feel like we're getting to finally so let's see did you see the big a little rasp in her belt there was a little respite end of the phrase too so i think she did it on purpose her voice has so many different colors it's incredible her voice is like rainbow and she was just literally painting with tons and tons and tons of colors i know that i'm using where it's incredible and amazing a lot but especially with these singers that's how i genuinely feel inside and fuzzy and happy because i got to hear that that was pretty fast based song and singing this clean with this invisible fluent switches just takes a lot of control so she had an amazing voice control her voice had a wonderful color in all of her registers and her chest voice and her mix but also her head voice of falsetto was really major pretty heavy so it matched with the rest of them very beautifully but i would definitely call her like queen of switches because you cannot see them you cannot hear them you wouldn't find them if you try everything was very well done very intricate very detailed her voice is definitely a very major it's very finished done polished and also at a very last bill she had a little bit of a rasp and she then added it at the very end of the song where she closed her throat a little bit to create an effect i'm just gonna show oh my god this is such a beautiful human she's just a such a good vocalist that it was so obvious that she could invest all of her attention into the emotional side of the song into into transmitting the emotions into the music and completely sweeping you off your feet as the audience so wonderful thank you so much for recommending um regina i am absolutely honestly lord i thought this is gonna be very good but i didn't think it's gonna be this good so if you enjoyed the video don't forget to subscribe and tip the notification bell because every single time i upload a new video i respond and like first of the comments but first and foremost stay safe and healthy and i'm gonna see you next time bye you\n",

Wow let me go on and check other performance I want to do it in this okay noway! Lady Marmalade 😍 Aguilera pink and Mia I love this one yes the costumes for sure just because they are kids and they are male are very distracting from the talents they have it's fun but if you only hear you can feel the talent if you watch you will be distracted and also you know what they actually made a good job with them they cure a lot the details of the video and they are singing it with high heels I want to hear AGUILERA what's HIS NAME?\n",

      "Video Id: S4bNEgM483k, Segment: ..yes this one it's very distracting the costume but this is the format so .. it's fine I don't know how the kid will do the low notes because it's very hard the bearb! do Mariah Carey's parts is very very hard because she keeps switching from chest to airy and head voice so could be struggling for for him Exactly this guy is notconscious of what he is doing because Mariah Carey used to switch from chest to airy to head voice in one phrase so it's like and it's very very hard technically and she used to do her great runs so okay here too: 🎙🎙🎙🎙 let's see what will happen okay nice let's switch to another one ABBA MAMMAMIA Three Tenors \"Oh sole mio\" let's go with this one perfect pronunciation perfect this is not even Italian this is a dialect they are perfect L'aria fresssca like Napolitano let's remember these are kids years old this is something wow! Carreras Domingo & Pavarotti they are so so so cute they are fabulous next reaction of TNT boys I will do it with my son because he's years old my son likes Jackson and would be nice to see his reaction to them and you know what it's very hard to sing in this range for a kid I mean this opera lyrical classical way to round the voice is not so easy and you should have a very strong diaframma sometimes they were breathless but they did a great job great! The customer this time didn't distract me too much probably because I know a lot this performance done from the Maestros this was a very very great super super react to tnt boys I love them I'm a huge fan they are and years old let me know their names!\n",

      "Video Id: bKCr62Dk7Us, Segment: it's been about a week and a half since I've been traveling in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and right before this I came straight from the Philippines and to be honest the first week that I was here in Malaysia I was craving Filipino food so someone actually recommended me to go over to this Filipino restaurant called Mabuhay Laguna Restaurant and mabuhay means welcome I did learn that from you guys so I'm heading over to the restaurant right now it's a Sunday today and apparently they have some type of like parties and celebrations going on Sunday this is also one of the few Filipino restaurants here in kl city apparently there's not too many so I'm gonna go check it out and eat my Filipino dishes so with Malaysia having some of the best food here in Southeast Asia honestly I want to say it should be the food capital of Southeast Asia but there definitely will be a lot of controversy along that if you put the restaurant up on Google Maps it'll direct you over to this this building right here but that is the old location however if you just turn around with the bright colors this is Mabuhay Laguna Restaurant so apparently there's a church around here that ends at p.m on Sundays so it gets kind of crazy so I got here at :am just because I want to be able to get a seat inside the restaurant so they also have rooms here where you can reserve for parties there and here which is cool so if you have like a birthday or something you can reserve here so that's ronny this is his restaurant oh what do we have here this is spring spring rolls what is inside of this meat?\n",
      "Video Id: bKCr62Dk7Us, Segment: they have some type of functions you know oh this is probably chili I love chili and garlic like the oh this is really good and this is a small little shrimp shrimp yeah this is behind the scenes hi how are you wow is this like every single dish just for every dish these oh this is before adobo and this is for water spinach these are also proper Filipino desserts and snacks here as well it looks familiar oh my gosh there is a balut I don't know if I can have this again this beautiful lady is eating here like a balut balut this is her first time she eat it first time she eat it just just taste the the soup soup first soup first soup just taste the soup the soup it tastes like egg oh my gosh i'm not looking at it so here is also where i guess people come and sing after church service on sundays and already you see people sitting down and in the next or minutes or so I think more people will be showing up oh so the table is also reserved for me salamat po okay so this is the menu literally got a couple of pages here with specialties there's a lot and this place is also really good for families as well you got some silog menu rice egg and noodles I got myself a celery apple juice they offered me beer at first but I was like I could not have beer this early so and they also have a western food menu option as well I'm kind of feeling some sisig to be honest so I might go and order oh my god there's so many things sizzling sisig dang should I get the pork or the chicken okay I think I'm gonna get the sizzling sisig pork I definitely want steamed rice with that oh and they do also have local dishes here as well but I just want my Filipinos dishes as a starter I might also get myself what is this embutido deep fried Filipino meal I might give myself an embutido or so actually all the workers here except for the owner they're all filipino so fyi to that i think they're a little bit busy right now but I'm just gonna wait and then place my order so yes I've decided I will get the sizzling sisig I don't think I've actually had uh a dessert or the starter dessert like an appetizer in the Philippines so I guess the first time I'll have that is here in Malaysia there's also a lot of posters here parking is more fun in the Philippines bananas from the Philippines rocky roads are more fun in the philippines generally I think the point that they're trying to make here is that it's just more fun in the philppines even though i'm not filipino I can just tell that the people here it feels like more of a community and I guess this is where all the philippines hang out on the weekends i do want to order before the crowd comes in here I don't know how many people will actually show okay but let's see ate I'm gonna get the sizzling sisig sizzling sisig pork okay also embutido what is the difference cause they say they're both do you have a favorite like which one is better no what is this one oh tofu okay i will just get the embutido yeah i'll get that oh yeah can i have steamed rice it's exactly :pm right now so church service is over and there's going to be a lot of people showing up here so I'm walking up the hill to go up to the church and I kind of want to see this like all the people coming and how many of them actually will come down over to the restaurant the flock is coming they just ended church service up there uh don't hit me please ah so this is where all the people are coming down from church and it has to be no more than like a two or three minute walk down to the restaurant just right across the street people are coming into the restaurant now but I just kind of wanted to see that see there's already a lot of people who already showed up here and i think that's for me steamed rice and one steamed pork minced pork salamat po thank you I actually never had this meatloaf over in the Philippines before mm it smells good they're getting a little bit busy right now but I need my spices can I get the uh the chili with the garlic and soy sauce yes thank you alrighty so I got all my dishes I got the sizzling sisig with the pork oh it's dripping I want to show you guys and then i got to embutido I've actually never had this before but there's there's a meatloaf uh starter here so I got that and of course my rice and I did ask for some chili so I'm going to go and ask the chili and then napkins yes that so the first thing I always try to do actually is to take a first bite of the food without influencing it with any of the sauces so sizzling sisig wow it tastes like the one just in the philippines oh it's so good the dish is not complete unless they have my sauces I'm so annoyingly particular can I get the chili garlic not powder the pepper like the that the chili garlic soy sauce yes thank you yay yes salamat po thank you do you need this you know how how many peppers I'm gonna put down? a lot alright let's see what i can do here honestly he gave me a spoon but I might just like dump it alright so your girl got herself a big bowl of pepper soy sauce I do want garlic but I don't want to bother them again I'm just gonna make this make all together I will say though I think Malaysia has spicier sauces than the Philippines so Malaysia spice reminds me the most like Thailand and Thailand spice was honestly perfect for me let's see ah i'm so excited okay I'm gonna steal someone's napkins actually be right back okay I just stole somebody's napkins okay so I took a bite of this sisig that is crack so good alright this meatloaf they also gave um it smells like a sweet a sweet spicy sauce also so let's try this it's like a sweet meatloaf what is that inside it looks like a spam or something but it's pretty sweet it's good but I'm going to for sure eat this with pepper it's good so actually here in southeast asia in general when I first would ask for chili I would just say pepper and in america this chili the red chili here we call this pepper I guess it's because the name of this is called Thai Bird's Eye Chili but there was actually one time where I went to a restaurant and I asked if I could have pepper and he gave me like the pepper flakes and I was like oh no not that one but it's funny oh thank you aw she gave me a whole thing of tissues instead because i just asked a random table because i didn't want to bother them meatloaf is good with the dipping sauce that they give but I like my food extra extra spicy with everything yum the sisig I think the meatloaf with the dish is like adding a good finishing touch I asked the owner I was like what percentage of people here are filipinos and he said more than % of people who actually come here and dine in on sundays are filipinos if i were to compare dishes because I've never had meatloaf in the Philippines I don't know how to compare it but this sisig is really spot on it tastes like I'm really in the Philippines right now karaoke?\n",
      "Video Id: bKCr62Dk7Us, Segment: okay so I will tell them that they can put it on because I think a lot of people do come here for karaoke and I don't want to be the reason why they don't enjoy their weekend I wonder if they sell chili bird eye with Thai Bird Eye Chili in the U.S because this has been a part of my diet for the last six months and I don't know if I can eat food without it honestly it's amazing so good I think my spice tolerance has definitely gone up it was already pretty high before I came to asia but it's definitely more now I will say also proportion this sisig is probably good for one meatloaf if you're here with someone else that you can share it but it's really good I'm really glad I came here it's like also before I ever came to the Philippines I've only had Filipino food like twice in my life I don't know why I never really came across um as a dish that I was curious to taste but I'm actually really excited to go home and try out all of the foods from all the countries I've gone to and I actually see the difference I think my time up here in Southeast Asia is still TBD but I have a better understanding of when I have to go home and yeah what a journey what a year it's been like I've been here for the last six months and I think it finally has occurred to me that my body is slowly just wearing out I'm not posting as much as I was when I first was here um I find myself more tired every day and sometimes I just want to do nothing but sometimes it's also difficult when you enjoy creating content a lot but you know that you should give yourself a break sometimes yeah thank you he was also saying too that usually when people sing karaoke here that they'll stay the whole night I don't know if I will be able to stay the whole night but I want to definitely see it and now I totally understand why people here in asia eat rice in the morning at first I was like I don't know anyone who does that but I get it now this sisig is really really good it's crack like I could probably eat this every day there we go karaoke I'm like sitting right in front of the music so everyone's kind of looking at me now so I guess the karaoke goes whenever someone wants to sing and that was cool it was just like this girl was singing and then the whole entire restaurant just kind of like stopped what they were doing and was watching her sing that's cool almost all the tables are full that's crazy I have a feeling here maybe you can fit like people in the main room, maybe? i'm also trying to eat slowly so I can have everything this is a random side note but I was talking to a couple of locals not just here in Malaysia but in other countries like Thailand and they were saying how they miss food from home like the home is in Asia and in the U.S they tried to find like local Thailand food or something and they were saying how they just weren't able to find food that tasted as good as home so they opted in for Mexican food and now I totally understand why because Mexican food they use a lot of lime and everything is so flavorful it's interesting because I think being here in Southeast Asia has made me appreciate my country more and everything that is there not just the food but just like the people and opportunities and the lifestyle they also took the chili away from me but I kind of want more if you are here in kl city there's a lot of a lot of type of food restaurants and dishes to try like all over the city but if you are looking for Filipino food Mabuhay Laguna Restaurant is a good choice not only is the food here really good but there's also a type of community here so if you're here and you're curious I would recommend coming here on a Sunday try to get here a little bit before noon because starting from o'clock it gets a little bit more packed here because the church service ends and people just end up coming here straight directly so this is probably the last time I will probably also have Filipino food until I get back to the states to be honest because I'm hopping over countries so in the next month I'm actually going to be going to three other countries so it's going to be a journey but if my body doesn't wear out I hope to make more travel vlogs uh at a at a pretty good pace at posting them everything was so good i'm so full thank you oh my gosh I shouldn't have taken the last two bites my stomach is going to expand this restaurant was also reviewed by Time Out Magazine in KL ok so i was abrout to leave and then i saw someone order this dessert so this is called a halo halo and i've never had this before in the philippines but apparently this is the filipino version of ice kachang so i don't know where ice kachang originated from but it is dessert and I really needed something sweet so okay ice cream stir?\n",

      "Video Id: y9iCFcSaD58, Segment: After having our coffee, Jumi and Greg said that it's time to dig into some Filipino breakfast and trying Tapsilog for the very first time here in a local side of Boracay, which is actually pretty cool. And we got the Tapsilog which is going to be beef so then Gokce of course decided to get a whole big plate of what's called \"Bihon\" which is Jumi... Fried glass noodle Okay, so like not exactly like Yum Woon Sen in Thailand as Jumi was explaining, but I mean it looks delicious. It was a lot bigger of a portion that Gokce and I were expecting so hopefully Greg and Jumi help us with this delicious looking food! The \"silog\" is just the garlic rice and the egg itself so I'm going to start out with that! This is so good, I love eggs!\n",
      "Video Id: y9iCFcSaD58, Segment: and it seems like everybody is here right now! This is of course the Filipino famous Jollibee and we cannot wait to of course check it out for the first time ever!

      "Video Id: ARMdb7fgfQU, Segment: today we're in manila the philippines at the world's first chinatown also known as binando there is a massive selection of food here with a mix of chinese filipino and spanish influence but mostly chinese this is really delicious my name is josie welcome back to my channel or welcome if you're new here let's go eat in manila the philippines okay so we've been dropped here at the binando church also known as the minor basilica and we're kind of in the middle of literally everything that's going on right now as you can tell i've got the san lorenzo ruiz sign over there and there's just a lot going on there's people there's cars there's buses there's jeepneys there's everything in this intersection so we're just on the walk now down to chinatown to have a look around there grab some food grab some dumplings whatever whatever else there is but let's go have a look let's start our journey so i didn't actually plan on this happening but i've seen a bubble milk tea place here and i'm craving a brown sugar milk tea so let's start the video with that and then we can wander onto some food thank you so much so i got the brown sugar milk tea i never actually used to like bubble tea and then i tried this one and i like it and i haven't been able to branch out since so tell me down below what's your favorite flavor of bubble tea because mine's still brown sugar the good one still definitely my favorite yeah delicious we came here with empty bellies to have as much food as we can so let's get going for some food so we're just walking along we just found a place that just had some like pastries in the front counter so we're going to try this we asked her if it was a donut and she said no so i'm not exactly sure what this is at all uh donut no no but it has some kind of glaze over the top and it kind of looks fried it kind of looks doughy let's try it um it does taste like a doughnut so i'm not sure what the name is if you know the name of it tell me in the comments but it tastes like a donut if the light is going up it's either really hard to chew or maybe a little bit of stale i'm not sure so there's plenty of them in there which makes me think she wouldn't make that many if they were going to get stale if this is a little bit fresher i think it'd be perfect in saying that it's quite substantial because it is so like hard to eat and bready straight off the bat we have been to chinatown in bangkok and that was sort of more of the you know street vendors in the streets every cart outside on its own but here i'm finding it's not really like that as you can see it's kind of restaurants it's kind of lined on the side with all these different kinds of restaurants but there's not that many food stalls um there was a couple of things of fruit on the side of the road back there but not really like street street food if that makes sense but let's go look for something i think we were hunting for some dumplings first okay so we're here at tasty dumplings and surprise we've ordered dumplings we ordered fried dumplings it comes with two four six eight eight dumplings and then you have the soy sauce here on the side so let's try these i don't think i've had fried dumplings before only normal dumplings so let's give them a go oh that's one i have them a lot they're really good either dumplings i don't often have dumplings so by no means am i a dumplings expertise x expert but they're really good so when we got here there's probably like one other person and now the place is packed out so they must be getting the dinner rush right now so those were some pretty amazing dumplings if i do say so myself so right now we're just walking to place at number two and we're gonna get something a little bit different obviously than dumplings because we just ate them um but right now it's starting to get a little bit dark it's starting to rain a little bit but people are still out eating food we're in sort of not the most busy street but i think we're heading back that way in a little bit so let's see what's in this one let's keep eating we're just walking down this hidden lane but it's actually starting to rain right now so oh here we go so we've come to the lumpia it's newpo hang lumpia house and we're gonna try some of this we've seen so many people try this so i think it's our turn let's have a look so it was super quick to get the actual olympia i think they have them ready to go on the like table and they're just wrapping them up and conveyor building it for when people order it must be super popular this was pesos filipino pesos let's see what all the fuss is about so i believe olympia comes in a fried version and a non-fried version this is the non-fried version but i actually tried the fried version in my last video so i'll leave that on the screen and in the description bar below go check that one out but this is the non-fried so let me try it first without the sauce smells good i've never tasted anything like this before i ever i think it's got it must have some kind of like it's like sugar or something it's really sweet so it's kind of like there's a bit of grittiness but it's i guess just a whole mix of vegetables in there you've got like the wrap the soft sort of wrap on the outside and then you've got the like medley of vegetables and soft but crunchy things on the inside as well all right let's try it with the sauce there's definitely a sweet element to this like yes it's vegetables and yes it's a wrap but something sweet about it i really like this i could eat this all the time this is really delicious it's really like crispy on the inside but also soft oh so good i've heard they have this option for breakfast obviously people buy it at all hours there's people chowing down behind me right now we're sharing one but like i might get my own after this wow so we just got here to twanky and the line here is crazy it's literally out the door around the corner and down the street pretty much it's raining the rain is pouring down it's so busy inside so i got the asado with the adobo egg and i'm excited i've never heard of that never tried it don't know what it is but i think it's really local i think it's local filipino so we're going to give it a go and make the lechon kawali i've most definitely said that wrong so tell me in the comments below but they're both i think pork dishes this one's just like more like a crispy pork and the one i have more is i think of a traditional filipino food but it comes with the egg and i'm not sure if it's like roasted or not i don't know tell me in the comments below um but i'm gonna try it i've never had this one before so michael got a calamansi juice oh i really like that it's like it honestly tastes like a lime i think it's made out of lime is it lime it tastes like a lime juice it smells sweet smells really sweet which is strange because it's pork but let's have a go but the pork is cold i kind of expected it to be warm i'm not sure if it comes like that or if we were just talking for too long before we ate it but the sauce is really sweet the outside of the pork is kind of crispy but you still have the softness of it like it still kind of breaks apart in your mouth i'm a little bit nervous to try these eggs though i'm not sure why they've just got like a ring of brown around the numbers i don't know about it but actually read a little bit about this in anticipation of trying some local foods and um i said it was a sweet almost sugary tasting oh my god a sweet almost sugary tasting pork which is like right up my alley that's perfect so let's give it a go okay so throw up the bath it's really nice and i really love the sauce the pork is so nice it reminds me of like christmas morning at home with my family let's try without the sauce first so i had like a first bite of that and it was like a lot colder than i expected and also there was like a bit of bristle in there i hate grizzle if my teeth touch something hard it like freaks me out it's like when you're in the um ocean and something touches your leg and you're like that's happened to me that's michael's dish so he'll try it for you hold on there's like a a piece of bristle inside every single one of these these larger pieces personally i like gristle if this was hot perfect but it's still pretty good like this anyway and obviously the sauce being super sweet makes it even better for me the rain right now is crazy everyone has umbrellas so everyone's in there raincoats we're trying to get to the next place right now there's a lot of rain and there's a lot of scurrying along to the next place so we're here at wai ying fast food it must be pretty popular because we have been in this line for quite a long time so let's see if the food is worth it it's been a while but a whole group of like eight people just came out so maybe this is our chance to get inside let's see and the line is super long behind us we were so lucky we got here i walked back to get jose because he was hiding under the out of the rain and we just got here in time there's probably like maybe people behind us so pretty well we waited for about minutes outside in the rain so this must be the place to be if everyone else is waiting there as well now i don't often i must confess to eat this type of food so i had no idea what i was ordering but the waiter definitely told me the most popular which he said was the beef wonton mommy so we've ordered that i just went with what he said and he's also good we haven't asked some chinese tea i'm pretty sure which is warming my hand okay so we have a big big bowl of like soupy noodles it has beef it has wontons it smells like beef i think even water let's have a go let's look at these noodles let's bring them up let's have a taste so the vibes here are immaculate we're eating dinner and someone's on facetime with like their family probably behind us it's not like ultra modern at all it looks quite old and a little bit traditional so you're obviously coming here for the food we lined up outside everyone else lined up outside so this must be the place of super good food let's try these noodles full of noodles full of soup there's a little dumpling in there there's like veggies everywhere in there and of course the beef which is what the main thing that you want to eat something like this and when it lives in that soup it just cooks in that soup a little bit more that is so chewy it is so super chewy all right let's try the noodles not a heap of flavor with the noodles but texture-wise the consistency is really good and they broke apart super easy i think you like this josie normally hates soup we go anywhere like this she goes not soup but we've got it and she's trying it i do love noodles even if i don't like soup so let's go oh i like the noodles i openers a lot they're definitely like flavored probably beef because it's beef wonton i might try a wonton now i don't normally have wontons or anything like that so usually so i have a wonton in this ladle it's surrounded by all the soup few noodle noodles in there the texture kind of freaks me out a little bit i think i've had one of them what do you think of it the texture is strange it's like soft and like rubbery well not rubbery because it's soft i'm a little bit nervous but i don't like that at all sorry it's um too chewy i'm getting like bits of fat so even though this wasn't for me i can tell why people come here it is a very nice tasting dish the taste is on point we're gonna finish this off and we're gonna wander outside and we'll see when we get there so while the wonton beef mommy wasn't my favorite i can see why it's really really popular but i have a sweet tooth so it's time for something sweet before we end this video let's have a look so here at wonky bakery let's see what they have all right so we have a pineapple poppy oh what is it propio i've never seen this or heard of this if you have any information of what it is it just looks like pastry with like a filling um but i've never seen it before this one's pineapple let's go oh okay it's like crunchy and hard i expected it to be soft the entire way like i expected the pastry to be soft i expected the pineapple to be soft it's actually really chewy and hard totally different to what i expected it would be but it's pretty cool to snack on the pastry is falling everywhere though um that's pretty good that's nice it was like pesos as well so pretty good price so as you can see it's almost night time here right now we've been here all day that's at the end of our full day here in bernando chinatown in manila in the philippines some of it was really good i tried a whole bunch of things that i'd never have before and some of it wasn't my favorite but that's totally okay i've tried new things and that's what this is all about before you go please press the like button on the video and subscribe as well before you leave if you like my stuff if not no worries if you like this one i know you're gonna love the one that's on the screen right now i tried some other food

philippines again can't wait to see the reaction of my parents-in-law this recipe is not completely dutch because i wanted to use ingredients that you can find in the philippines so that you can try making this one yourself konting toyo na lang also konting asin just a little bit make sure not to overdo it remember that we also have tomato ketchup and other ingredients which add flavor to the dish tamis anhang version isang tablespoon na lang white pepper cayenne pepper one package i like these tiny packages from the philippines these are really handy and also a some package of garlic powder this is a must for meatball recipe now i'm adding breadcrumbs i'll add one package of breadcrumbs it looks like a lot but this will really make the meatballs firm the amazing mascovado sugar from the philippines it's about isang tablespoon you might wonder why i'm cooking so much for my parents-in-law but you know every time i cook in the philippines there's like other persons joining us so i'm gonna make a little bit extra because we might get a lot of visitors i added one tablespoon cornstarch you can also add one more egg to make it extra firm but it's not necessary because we already add the bread crumbs you know i don't like to measure things exactly i always do it on feeling you know that's much nicer in my opinion so we're adding four cloves of garlic as well i wanted to leave the just the garlic powder but i know filipinos love bawang so we're going to add a little extra bawang i made sure to wash my hands of course so now we're going to grind everything mix everything mix lahat just mix everything together just mix lahat and we're gonna shape these into balls and they're actually gonna be pretty big make sure to mix it really well so that all the spices and two kinds of giniling and mix then just shape the balls meatballs and like i said pretty big just use approximately the same size just shape them like this you roll it and you're done pffeww sobrang iniit dito sa Pilipinas but i love the init so here's uh probably to meatballs that should be enough for a filipino gathering diba we're gonna peel the potatoes i'm cooking it's a dutch recipe with potato yeah it's potatoes and meatballs it's simple simple food in the netherlands you eat simple that's food dutch food so i hope you're gonna like it so now i'm doing all the potatoes and onions and carrots nanay is already curious peeling of the potatoes is easy but it takes a little bit of time nanay is helping me with cutting the potatoes ah this is pinoy style with the knife delicious iced coffee for me wow so now it's time for the carrots same thing as with the potatoes i'm just peeling them nice will you use this also for the halaman yes that is nice for the halaman right here you can just sit up here so we just chop it like this small pieces like you would make a pancit canton the rest of this dish is pretty simple just wash the potatoes in the dirty kitchen same with the carrots and the onions give them a little wash we're gonna turn it on the potatoes first it has uh about one and a half times the amount of water in the meantime we're gonna fry the meatballs here in the other pan oh this is going to be so brang sarap if you have not seen the grocery shopping yet i'll put the link in the description for the other video i'm going to put a little bit of salt on the potatoes are you also excited to see nanay and tatay's reaction how will they react to this dutch food because it's so simple lang do you have magic sarap i think that is really it's totally not dutch it is very filipino it should be very sarap see it needs to have a nice color like this is the potatoes are half cooked at this moment normally in the netherlands we use a masher for this but i'll be creative like pinoy so we just mash everything i removed the water as you can see i just left a little bit of water carrots patatas magic sarap we mix the butter and this is low heat so that the final moist can go out and it's pretty much done we put it like this we'll add one of the meatball in the middle it's like a doughnut right the sabaw goes on top like that kain na tayo tatay this is uh food from the netherlands from the netherlands yes it's a stampot stamppot can you say it yes potatoes with meatball and sibuyas at carrots next would you like to try it we

      "Video Id: puxKH-_9xGM, Segment: hello everybody this is Doug and today I'm coming to you from Cebu City the Philippines we are still in the Philippines and I'm here with Molly hi and guys the goal of today's video is to try as much Filipino food as possible Cebu is known as one of the food capitals of the Philippines and they are famous for some very great Specialties as well as some general Filipino Classics so we have about five hours we have to uh try to budget our food consumption so we don't get too full too early and uh we're gonna do as much as we can and unfortunately it's our last day in the Philippines so this is going to be a great way to end the trip so we're off to our first stop we're gonna have breakfast here we go all right guys we reached our first stop it's called snow Sheen restaurant and it says where the people of good taste meet so I like that I think that's a good sign it looks really good by the way guys stay tuned till the end of the video because at the very end of the video I'm going to be trying balut which if you haven't heard of it it is an egg that is very common here in the Philippines where the chicken or the duck inside is fertilized so the embryo develops it's very common here beloved Filipino food very intimidating to me but for you guys I'm gonna try it and Molly is too she's very excited just kidding but I will all right guys so anyway breakfast here we go do we order here I guess we maybe order here and then we sit all right guys we're in the restaurant and the first dish has arrived this is called siopao it is a big fluffy bun this is actually a Chinese Filipino dish so it's very similar to like about that you've seen in some Chinese food probably the big fluffy pillowy bun filled with some kind of sweet delicious meat and they actually Mark which type of bun it is with this uh colored dot on the top of it Molly why don't you do the honors take the first bite how is it I feel good really let me try oh yeah this looks really good so it's got that kind of caramelized meat in there oh and an egg um and there's some sauce spicy sweet okay so and then in there there's a hard-boiled egg Molly wanted me to clarify that she's only not trying the balloon because she doesn't like eggs in general not because it is a fertilized fetus inside the egg if you liked normal eggs then you would definitely try the balloon right definitely anyway that's coming at the end guys stay tuned all right guys the second dish has arrived so here we have Mommy it's actually called Mommy this is a type of soup it's also a Chinese Filipino dish it's like a basically a chicken noodle soup but here it's made with pork pork is super popular in the Philippines and this goes great with the CIO Pao this is the breakfast soup let's give it a try and let's see how it is got noodles a little bit of greens some pork delicious very salty and you've got still The Fluffy bun to go along with it guys I don't know if this is allowed but I'm gonna try dipping the scopal in the broth yell at me in the comments if this is uh against the rules I think it's very good salty and sweet the broth is Savory it's oily you can feel it coating your lips but it is uh super super tasty that salty Umami flavor so we're gonna finish this up and then we are going to head to our next stop hopefully we save room okay guys we are on our way to our next stop down here in central Cebu City stay tuned we've got lechon coming up we've got street food and we've got balloon all right guys we're at our next stop now it is called sienti lechon here in Cebu and in the Philippines more broadly but especially in Cebu they are famous for lechon lechon is a cling a pig that's been roasted on a spit and then they chop it up in a variety of different ways they make sure that they always include some of the really crispy skin that's been nice and crisped up very crackly they chop it up with a big knife and yeah like I said it is absolutely famous here so we waited to try it until we came here to Cebu we've also got some garlic rice which is what it sounds like rice with garlic very famous here in the Philippines and delicious let's give it a try ladies first of course Molly go ahead oh you hear that all right so you got a little bit of pork Molly used to not like pork and now on this trip you're eating so much of it so much more all right all right I've got an excellent bite here with a lot of crispy skin first bite of lechon Cheers everybody foreign wow it is so juicy I think by slow roasting the whole pig they keep all those juices in there so juicy super tender super flavorful now let's try a little bit with this garlic rice and it probably goes great together oh very garlic salty heavy all right guys the last bite we want to try is with this special sauce that it comes with I don't think it's straight soy sauce but maybe a little bit of soy vinegar maybe some sweetness it was on the table so we'll give it a dunk here a little bit of that rice a little bit of that pork actually a lot of that pork and here we go yeah this is delicious very popular for Filipino celebrations get a whole pig and roast it this is incredible all right guys that lechon was delicious we are on the road again to our next stop the balut is drawing ever closer with every passing minute and I'm getting nervous but I'm also excited because it'll be an experience and that's what it's all about I'm doing it for you guys so stay tuned the balloon is coming at the end of the video but for now we're off to a very special iconic Filipino restaurant and here it is guys Jollibee how excited are you Molly so Jollibee is a super famous actually at this point International uh Filipino fast food chain there's their little mascot we're gonna go inside they serve a bunch of stuff but we're here for something very special yes so here at Jollibee their main thing is Fried Chicken which they call here chicken Joy very nice name for it and then they've also got Burgers they've got hot dogs with I think macaroni and cheese on it not sure I've never tried it they've also got what they call Burger steaks which are like burgers with this mushroom sauce and everything comes with rice it's very good however here today we are here to try something very special which is Jolly spaghetti okay and here it is do you want to do the big reveal oh wow obviously you got to do the honors since this is your favorite they have this place in New York actually in Midtown New York there's a Jollibee good okay so what is it about Jollibee spaghetti that makes it so special it's has cheese some kind of like white cheese on it and it has hot dogs in it yum yes so it's sweet spaghetti and uh it's not my favorite thing I like it okay it's it's like total junk food let's give it a bite here we go sweet Jollibee Filipino spaghetti good flavor to me a little bit strange definitely unique but a lot of people love it including this person here we've got some pineapple juice which is just sugary and delicious yeah that's so good yeah no it's tasty sweet spaghetti goes that's why we came to Jollibee stay tuned we've got more coming up soon so we're on our way to try the next food on our list it's actually going to be the second to last with the last of course being balut but the one that we're going to be trying right now is called and our Taxi Driver yesterday told us about it and he said it's a really common food with taxi drivers and one thing I've learned is that where the taxi drivers go to eat you should also go because they know all the best tiny little hole in the wall spots wherever they work and that's where we're headed right now I don't even know what it is I kind of forget so we're gonna go there check it out give it a try and uh yeah it's gonna be fun okay we're here and look at all of this fried stuff what is all this can you tell me is n't that it's Pork yeah small intestine okay what about these ones is it really uh pork belly okay what's this one made of um vegetables vegetable oh we don't want that only the pork right and there's even some crabs there okay so punko Bunko is just like a bunch of fried stuff okay cool and these are just uh this one is okay crispy so this whole place is just loaded with tables and they're each like their own station do you guys all work for the same company or so it's all one place that all serves the same stuff but all these different stands anyway it's all separate okay and everything comes wrapped in plastic so they can quickly reuse the plates and whatnot thank you you excited yeah we can just share it together this is the intestine oh pork belly and this is intestine okay everyone's wearing these bags ah okay yeah do I wear that because it's very greasy all right so here is a piece of uh intestine thank you here we go oh that's good tastes like crispy bacon it tastes like fried chicken okay now here's the pork belly pork belly again deep fried oh wow see that's the competition when everyone walks in to get them to come to their stall s wow I ate the pork belly just as that promotion started it's delicious similar very crispy here's a nice big it's like chicharron you're gonna like it this one yeah here's a big veggie roll also deep fried I'm gonna need a diet after this no more fried food for like a couple weeks foreign like it could almost be potato or some I don't know some kind of starchy vegetable cool experienced to come here this reminds me of getting compare in Turkey in ortakoi when you get there all the potato sellers are yelling at you to try to get you to come to their stall it's a cool experience I would recommend this come when you're hungrier though because there's a lot of stuff to try we only tried a few things but we've got a bunch of other stuff crabs should we try crabs since it was your idea you gotta try first I think you just dig it out with your fingers very fried they're very good so this is just like the kind of the head the back of the crumb I think they kind of stuff it with the stuff because I don't think the whole head is normally filled with me like that I think they empty it out and make maybe some kind of a meat mix maybe and then put it back in the shell for serving I'm not sure any Filipinos in the comments let me know if I'm wrong about that but let's give it a try oh okay very sweet so we're going to continue on to the final challenge of this video balut stay tuned bye-bye thanks Doug Barnard okay guys that was really good very crispy very fried but the experience I think is what made it so we're gonna try to find balut right now they just told us that it's more of a nighttime thing or a late afternoon thing and it's the middle of the day but we have to go to the airport soon however if we don't find it here I'm gonna get it in Manila tonight so it's coming up right after this no matter what all right guys I'm back in Jakarta now we couldn't find it in Cebu but uh we're here looking for balut and I think we found the right place I'm so nervous uh oh gosh I think it's right there gosh hello okay is it chicken or duck duck okay oh I'm so nervous all right I'm handing the camera off to Molly film well please I'll do my best one try yeah seriously or two no one our taxi driver is coming to to come with us to witness it's so much yeah yeah so can you tell me how to eat it please do I open can you help you poke with the stick thank you uh this side okay hit it here okay okay oh oh oh my gosh okay we're finding a little oh my God Sanju you're enjoying this more than me okay drink the juice okay I'm gonna drink the soup so just take a look in there first so you can see there's a little bit of yolk and there's a little bit of fetus so this is the real deal here guys I'm gonna drink the juice it smells like chickeny broth all right I'm gonna drink the juice it's very hot the juice is good yeah let's open a little bit more of this and we can see if we can get a better look at baby duckling yeah okay good are you gonna eat one with me okay good oh should I put salt yeah okay very nice okay well you have to drink your soup first so how many days how many days incubation days yeah I heard that's the longest I read online that it's to days is the best time but is less feathers and softer beak so guys in here just to recap we've got uh a fertilized duck egg so the embryo has started to form and oh did you eat it you show me how to do it oh you finished one bite okay I'm gonna do two bites come on is it good did you put the sauce on it yeah I'm gonna put stent okay okay okay so yeah is that oh is that the head yeah okay so here we've got a small duck uh embryo it feels like a mix between an egg and and something more oh you can see some veins there some feathers developing here yeah there's feathers right there see that black bit there is is some of the feathers and uh okay I'm not gonna I'm not gonna dissect it anymore hot sauce please thank you so much so we're actually gonna do this in one bite here okay um cheers to the Philippines thank you so much for a great visit this is a really big bite yeah two bites two bites here we go I'm glad you guys are enjoying it all right here we go one bite two bites actually if I didn't have just do one bite that's good yeah yeah thank you so first impressions while it's still in my mouth it tastes like a very firm egg with some hard bits in there I'm not getting beak and um claws as much as just like thickness like the body is starting to develop but there's no difference between like the meat and the bones of the baby yet it's all it's just a kind of hardness and it it tastes more like chicken than egg food very strong oh it's duck right sorry not chicken duck um okay good good to hear what do you say very strong knees and very strong sex both knees and also sex to be honest this is not that bad it's pretty it tastes like chicken the texture is a little strange but if you can see it there like here is just like kind of like egg white but it's getting a little harder and it's weird you can because you can see the the yolk part and then it's turning more into the bird part here which is all coming apart now I'm gonna finish this and get the job done by the way I should mention that because I changed my plate tonight I had a little more time and I had two beers before this only two but I think it's uh that probably helped a little bit all right we're gonna finish it this is no big deal guys I've had worse things that bite was easier that was more eggy the other one was harder I bit through probably the the formation of the body uh yeah thank you so much it's okay thank you I want to savor it the second bite was easy that that was just like eating a hard-boiled egg the first bite a little bit rough some tough bits in there let me just get it done so you guys know I finished the job guys this is the end of the food tour thank you so much for watching I hope you guys enjoyed the video subscribe if you haven't already we've got a lot more coming from around the world other than that see you in the next one

      "Video Id: REvaHqT3uro, Segment: it looks like they're building a brand new Spa right there and it seems like a pretty decent sized Beach Grill to the left a nice little food truck right there to the right some good Tunes I'll get some tacos that's one thing I'll tell you in El Nido everywhere you can go you can find Mexican food in the Filipino version not as white of sand as like the main beach in El Nido but like or maybe it's because it's wet at the moment but still a really nice Vibe here a lot of like tree coverage leading up to the beach which gives it more of that jungle feel and one thing I've noticed in the Philippines all around they have like a dedicated smoking area you can't just like smoke outside anywhere have you noticed that too bro that's the first time I noticed it all over the Philippines they have dedicated sections for smokers to go yeah guys so this is another perspective of seeing the area of uh El Nido this is the beach if you remember in the previous video when we were flying in that was the uh that was the dock right there the pier that we were looking out at and the plane basically flew right in there all the way down and landed as we're really close to the airport here oh actually this will be my first time touching the water bro Let's test it out see if it's any good all right oh yeah nice and warm so guys if you want to spend some time at Leo Beach if you got a lot of time in El Nido this would be from what it seems like a good place to spend like an afternoon in there's like shops and other areas that line this way and it's one of those beaches where if you're trying to enjoy the outside yet not get as much of a tan the tree coverage is is perfect for that I mean there's not too many beaches in the world I've seen that actually have like all these different types of trees that close to the beach so it is definitely what kind of sets this place apart and all down there I want to say there's like shops and things want to loop back this way bro so lots and lots of nice like uh cafes here it seems like giving up their smoothie bowls yoga classes and a uh a lot of like places to lounge around good digital Nomad working space to be close to the beach yet also close to a fresh delicious coffee in this area so yeah it's it's really nice guys you obviously been watching from the beginning of this video if you're still here and there's a lot of rain before but it can be moody here the weather and so you know you can just wait around for a couple hours and then well it's not like perfect beach weather right now it's at least not raining so it's still worth coming down if your part of your day gets rained upon and check out what's going on in this area. And I'm not sure if these are like hotels in these areas seems like there's some lounging areas up top bars on the first floor but it kind of has given me that Resort style vibe that first look definitely plenty of options if you've got a few days to do a little bit of a restaurant hopping in the area but yeah guys we only have a couple hours of daylight so we're probably not even a couple hours at this point probably one and a half hours so we're gonna keep cruising on the mopeds a little bit further to what's uh supposed to be an even better like Beach area so knock Pond yeah all right not fun as what is like minutes from here uh yeah nice all right so we'll cruise over to the knock Pong guys and uh you'll get a small little tour with us of today's uh excitement exploring the different beaches in the area good all right we're heading back out this way and looks like we're gonna be going to the uh right let's get this bread all right we're about minutes away and as you can see this is some of the nature here in Boracay more of those beautiful palm trees and just a really wet feeling climate around here I will say I love the island but you're hot sticky and humid all the time during this time of the year I like it because it's Island line been cruising for a bit uh very rural is a better way to say it not too much except more and more jungles but a nice peaceful drive especially now that the sun's coming out.\n",

      "Video Id: 8DYPxsr7kDI, Segment: today's video is going to primarily be towards you filipinas I normally am talking to the foreigners and actually I will after this first part in the same video after addressing you with Filipinas then I'll have some just some commentary for the the foreigners so let's go ahead and jump right into it what is the purpose here of this video I'll tell you what it's not I'm I don't know you I've never met you I'm sure you're a sweet woman but there is an issue that needs to be addressed and chances are if you're if your boyfriend sent you this video it's either because he's warning you ahead of time or this has already become an issue in getting to know you now I understand the culture in Philippines is very different things kind of move a different way but that's also true about Western culture or any culture really outside the Philippines and if you're going to date a foreigner my purpose here is not to criticize you my purpose is not to put you down in any way again I've never met you I don't know anything about you but my purpose here is to help you my purpose here is to make your dating experience with a foreigner go smoother okay that's the whole goal of this video so how can we do that well out of all the things that can happen especially when you're looking to make that first impression the first few dates we're talking about may be the first five dates especially if you're if you're still together after four or five dates you're kind of sort of entering into a regular relationship where you know each other a bit and but those first four dates or so is your chance to make a good impression now yes it'll be nice that you know you do your makeup or you put on a nice dress or you do your hair those are all good things to do to make a good impression but where so many Filipinos drop the ball and ruin things before they ever get a chance to even get started he's on this one important and I'll emphasize that again important issue which is showing up on time okay so you're it's your first second third or fourth date this is your chance to really impress him on this one key point so what we're gonna do in our example is we're going to say that the foreigner has asked you out you met him somewhere got exchanged numbers you talked a bit and now you're gonna have your first date or your second day and so you both talked about it and as you're talking about it you're discussing what time you get off work what time you get off school when is a good day when is a good time where's a place easy to meet these are generally how you set an appointment and the crucial part is what time so for our example we're gonna say that you're foreigner boyfriend and you agree after he has asked you what time you get off work in this example we'll say that you get off work at five o'clock and that you need a little bit of time to go home again do your makeup whatever and get to the place so let's say that you get off work five o'clock and you both agree that you're gonna meet at o'clock that gives you two hours you agreed this is enough time for you to get home do what you're gonna do and then get on a jeepney and get to the location now let's say that it's at the mall and you agree okay you're gonna meet at the mall at Starbucks seems like everybody meets at Starbucks so you're gonna be you both agree you're gonna get off work at : and then you're gonna do what you got to do and then you're gonna get there and you're gonna both meet both you're gonna both be there at : p.m. at the Starbucks at the mall so when you get off work at five o'clock and if you know that it takes to minutes for the jeepney to get from your home or wherever you're gonna be coming from if it takes minutes for the jeepney to arrive at the Starbucks at : p.m. this means you need to be on that jeepney no later than : because again you subtract minutes from o'clock and at : so you get off work at : you go home you do what you got to do you look at the clock and you go oh my goodness at : I better start heading out the door so I can get the jeepney because you already know sometimes the genies are full sometimes the genies are late so you're gonna need to get out there at : to get on the genie at : so that you can arrive at the mall by or : p.m. on time now that's what you need to do that's what you need to do and if you if your boyfriend or your upcoming date sent you this video it's because either you've already been late once before or his previous dates were late and he doesn't want you to be late because being late to a foreigner is very rude very rude and and I understand that there's Filipino time and all that but when it comes to a date you do not keep a date waiting and waiting and waiting you don't do that it's very rude so I'm gonna be talking to the foreigners here in a moment after we just cover this and and I will tell you right now general courtesy says that you wait for a business appointment about minutes if the person has not contacted you that they're running late and minutes ago by the person waiting has the option to get up and leave now if they get a text that says within those minutes I'm almost there I'm in traffic I'm on my way well then you can give them another minutes okay now here is the problem a foreigner will wait and it'll be five minutes to seven or even seven or even seven ten in our example and the foreigner will get a text from a Filipina saying I'm on my way and then he'll get another text at : saying I'm almost out of the shower I'm gonna go get the jeepney now here here is something that that drives foreigners nuts if you're gonna be somewhere at p.m. you don't leave your house at p.m.\n",

      "Video Id: CBmNk9pSsy4, Segment: So if you're considering medicine, or you know someone who is. Or maybe you're in the middle of med already and you're still clueless on what you're doing. I think it's important for you to know how long it takes for you to complete that road to MD.\n",
      "Video Id: CBmNk9pSsy4, Segment: The journey starts as early as high school when you pick your course and your college.\n",

      "Video Id: CBmNk9pSsy4, Segment: You can - just stop and really think about what you're getting yourself into. Really think about pursuing medicine.\n",
      "Video Id: CBmNk9pSsy4, Segment: But some people, including myself, we just go straight to med school.\n",
      "Video Id: CBmNk9pSsy4, Segment: Now med school.\n",
      "Video Id: CBmNk9pSsy4, Segment: Depending on the school, the first two to three years is usually spent in the classroom.\n",
      "Video Id: CBmNk9pSsy4, Segment: doing lectures, quizzes, reportings, case discussions, lab work, research, more quizzes, more exams, etc.\n",
      "Video Id: CBmNk9pSsy4, Segment: Fourth year is always Clerkship or Junior Internship.\n",
      "Video Id: CBmNk9pSsy4, Segment: or on-the-job training in the hospital where you get to rotate in different rotations in different departments and find out what you're really interested in. Now at the end of fourth year, if you get to pass your comprehensive exam and you fulfill all the requirements of the different departments in your hospital You get to graduate with an MD So you're a medical doctor but only by education it's good it's at four and we're late What good is that for?\n",
      "Video Id: CBmNk9pSsy4, Segment: You have to continue with your Post-Graduate Internship.\n",
      "Video Id: CBmNk9pSsy4, Segment: That's one more year of clinical work, still in the hospital still kind of as a student, but more level up than the Junior Intern.\n",
      "Video Id: CBmNk9pSsy4, Segment: Now after your internship, you spend two to three months for intensive review.\n",
      "Video Id: CBmNk9pSsy4, Segment: You can be a general practitioner.\n",
      "Video Id: CBmNk9pSsy4, Segment: There are so many other things a doctor can do after med school.\n",
      "Video Id: CBmNk9pSsy4, Segment: Residency is when you study some more to specialize in a specific field.\n",
      "Video Id: CBmNk9pSsy4, Segment: That's another three to five years of learning but this time no longer in a classroom setting but in the hospital.\n",
      "Video Id: CBmNk9pSsy4, Segment: Then there's another specialty boards after residency.\n",
      "Video Id: CBmNk9pSsy4, Segment: so if you pass that, then that's the time you can call yourself a.. dermatologist, a pediatrician, an internist, a general surgeon, an OB-Gyn, etc So after residency - what's next?\n",

      "Video Id: dGM9kDXdWcQ, Segment: So i'm going to teach you some things that you should know when you're dating offline or online with a Filipina In order for you to avoid being scammed and broken.\n",
      "Video Id: dGM9kDXdWcQ, Segment: uhhuh so first thing first thing, Whenever you meet a Filipina understand the they have a mentality that says they're entitled to get your money.\n",
      "Video Id: dGM9kDXdWcQ, Segment: In other words because they feel they’re poor and they don’t have money and you have a lot of money They're entitled to go in your pockets. And it's ok so, They have no regrets about lying or misleading you, They have no regrets about telling you things that are untrue, It's just what they do to get what they want.So filipinas are very very powerful women.\n",
      "Video Id: dGM9kDXdWcQ, Segment: Now filipinas can use their power for good or they can use that power for evil. Now the scammers, the filipinas that are scammers use a charismatic power for evil.\n",

      "Video Id: dGM9kDXdWcQ, Segment: They want your money. Anything they say to you is for the purpose of gaining your trust.That’s what they, the first thing Filipinas do is try to gain your trust.\n",
      "Video Id: dGM9kDXdWcQ, Segment: Now how do they gain your trust?\n",
      "Video Id: dGM9kDXdWcQ, Segment: And so Filipinas are artists at stroking the ego of a man Especially foreigners. And most Filipina scammers here are trained on what to sayAnd how to say things to foreign men. And the reason they are trained is because it’s big money, big money business.Filipina scammers work to hours a day - days a week.\n",
      "Video Id: dGM9kDXdWcQ, Segment: That way you can find out if they’re lying. Anytime you find out they’re telling a lie, get rid of them.\n",

      "Video Id: dGM9kDXdWcQ, Segment: The professional scammers are the ones that are hardest to spot.\n",
      "Video Id: dGM9kDXdWcQ, Segment: It may take several days, because they’re trained on when to speak about money and when they speak about money, They don’t directly ask you for money. Here’s what they do, They’ll say I’m so tired, and you say what’s wrong and they say, I haven’t eaten today im hungry and I did not want to bring this to you.\n",
      "Video Id: dGM9kDXdWcQ, Segment: Another thing is not only hunger, they’ll say the baby’s sick, mama’s sick, papa’s sickMy cellphone was stolen, or I don’t have enough funds, I really like talking to you,But I don’t have enough money to get back on the internet tomorrow, All that’s a bunchOf crap, okay?

      "Video Id: dGM9kDXdWcQ, Segment: It’s about protecting your assets.\n",
      "Video Id: dGM9kDXdWcQ, Segment: It’s about not allowing them to get in your pockets.

wireless phone charging station here i'm gonna try it out because i need to charge my phone a little bit so let's see how this works um okay well that's not work actually i might just read the instructions please take care of your phone at all times remove phone kick up remove phone case while charging okay i guess my phone doesn't support it so there's quite a few different like sections of the mall like the malls are all different but they're connected by this like walk over this walk pass so we're just walking to the next one because we don't know what we're looking for at this point there's so many things here but this is a beautiful place down here where we were earlier and it's just got lights looks really pretty but they're all connected by this overpass and the footpath downstairs so let's walk into the next mall and see what's in there so this mall in particular this big one that we're in is like the cyber store the cyber one and it's basically covered in all of these like electronic shops there's cameras phone chargers little oh everyone's trying to get you to buy everything over there there's everything you can imagine sell things like phone sims everything to do with electronics in this one here so we're just gonna head around the back now i guess the water and to see what's on outside i think there's like some kind of like games or carnivals or something like that uh all i want right now is a coffee and i cannot find one because there's just so much around this mall is insane like so insane you do not need anything else this is a one-stop shop that's for sure let's hope i can find a coffee all right well i can't find like a coffee shop coffee shop because there's just too many things here so i'm just going to go into old starbees can't go wrong okay we are stocked up on coffee and we're about to go to the back to have a look at the arcade games and the eye and things like that but before we go anywhere if you're new to my channel welcome take two seconds to press the subscribe button like this video before we go on that really helps my channel let's go have some fun let's go we were walking around for a really long time in there and there was just so much to do so much to see i think you need like literally a whole day if you want to come to actually shop and do things um but thank you we're going across to the side um now where they're going oh let's go over crossing everyone's so friendly so we're gonna go and try and find the big ferret oh this game there's rides and stuff too this is so fun all right let's go have a look what they have here maybe play a few games and go from there but this is cool this is insane there's so many people here and everyone's having fun i see people and little kids and actually even older kids on these two bikes like these tandem bikes as well riding around everywhere there's people playing like basketball there's people eating there's people on this what's that called merry-go-round i think carousel and they're on the bikes there's people everywhere this is really fun this is such a cool activity to do or like something if you want to calm down and just have like a little bit of fun like with family friends like anyone you can play these games and i see a big ferris wheel at the end there so we might actually go on that because i haven't been on a ferris wheel since the london eye about years ago so might want to see the view from the top but this is crazy i can't even begin to describe to you how many people are actually here everyone has like a seat on the cement barrier overlooking the ocean the water everyone's looking out over that way people playing games it's so cool to see like everyone's here with their family yeah whereas like if this was australia you might come with your friends friends probably gonna be half empty most people will be at home but like the whole family's out here like there's grandma's out here there's little kids running around everyone's having a good time it's awesome we're gonna go have a look if we can get a spot on the ferris wheel it's about to literally rain i can feel it starting to spit down so let's hurry and see if we can get a spot on there to sort of stay away from the rain for a while and hopefully have a look out over this water this bay this looks so pretty let's go have a look five i don't think we have enough cash to go on we might quite literally be like one like nine pesos one peso short on going on this ferris wheel are you serious we need one more peso okay so we don't have we're like one peso short going on on the ferris wheel thing it's pesos we have it's per person and we literally have pesos like you actually have two in my hands . we actually have pesos genuinely so funny oh well let's look at it from here it means we can get stuck into some street food instead yeah let's go we'll spend our money on that all right oh hi hi so we're one peg so short to get on that so there's so many rides here so many fun things for you to do just so you know uh bring some cash but that's probably a blessing in disguise so now we can go eat some street food see what they have oh i can't breathe behind there play somebody see what they have maybe see if there's a little games we could play but definitely go grab some food to show you that let's go have a look at what they have that looks like a massive storm or like something over there so we should probably grab some food and leave before that hits unfortunately but look at that that looks that looks like a like a ski like a scary movie can i have this one the temp that yeah thank you okay so i'm gonna go on the drop one um okay it started to like really pour in rain and now everyone's rushing off everywhere and we're all trying to get upstairs and now it's raining everywhere and everyone is trying to get up and we can't there's too many people okay that didn't work that did not work at all i consumed when i was like it's gonna get real bad it got real bad real fast you know what you were seconds away from you were seconds away from being on that while this happened then like what then what final destination you've never seen that movie before i was sitting there and i was like surely they're not sending me up like so there's so much storm now like everything's like being like blown in the wind i'm drenched my camera's drenched we're all trying to huddle under these like we're all trying to hunt away we're all trying to huddle under here just held off from the rain and i guess if it doesn't pass we just go home i guess sorry about i don't want to go if this stays like this how are we gonna get home now all the power's out as well this did not go to plan all right so while we're stuck here and literally can't go anywhere because of this storm um let's just get a little snack from this lovely lady ready an oreo one twenty twenty so i'm gonna try one of these we actually have some similar back when we're in thailand i'll leave the link on the screen or in the description bar below but i think they're like chocolate and blueberry this one's oreo oreo is my favorite i love oreos i'll eat

soaked we came inside that wasn't the way that um that was meant to go we're meant to be on the rides and having some more fun but that's cool at least we've got a little bit of a snack there a little

Travel clearances and fathers But be aware that an Australian sponsor can't go and pick up the child of his girlfriend or fiance and bring them back to Australia. And as you will read below, there are laws here about adults being in the company of kids they are not related to, and you don't want to put yourself under a cloud of suspicion.

There are so many shops around And so many people It's like mid afternoon -pm Usually when the sun is that strong people are inside and just going to the restaurant or staying in the mall but here it's lively even outside Actually, it reminds me a little bit of Colon Street in Cebu City because it's super lively maybe less people There's a market also I think There's also a shopping mall BQ mall just in front of us So yeah Quite interesting It is really interesting, there is many food here so I can see there is fruit and skewers It looks nice We'll come back here later.\n",

      "Video Id: 2ftG8JuMzz4, Segment: The challenge in eating balut is by eating the semi-developed duck fetus hiding under the shell, drenched in its own soup. The type of egg usually used in making balut is the egg of a mallard duck, commonly known in the Philippines as the “Pateros duck”.\n",
      "Video Id: 2ftG8JuMzz4, Segment: The thin membrane must be removed to expose the soup and the actual egg, then sprinkle just a tiny dash of salt and pour a small amount of sinamak- a type of coconut vinegar spiced with bird’s eye chili, garlic and ginger. Have a taste of the “soup” first, which has a slightly salty but surprisingly deep and refreshing flavor, enhanced by the salt and spiced vinegar.\n",

      "Video Id: 2ftG8JuMzz4, Segment: The egg yolk has a creamy taste while the whites have a tough and slightly crunchy texture.\n",
      "Video Id: 2ftG8JuMzz4, Segment: These are the good parts of the balut, but if you want to take your curiosity once notch higher, then you can eat the balut’s centerpiece: its underdeveloped duck. If you get lucky, you may get the duck that is nearly fully formed, which some may find quite off-putting.\n",
      "Video Id: 2ftG8JuMzz4, Segment: Since etag is hung in the open air, the dried meat has maggots crawling in its flesh because it was exposed to the elements and the flies. Because of this, etag also has a foul odor that can challenge the bravest eaters.\n",

a very very nice place for pedestrians yes and I'm hoping a little bit of coffee will just Elevate the entire walk-in experience but we gotta find one that's open that's the hard part right now okay my love yes because they look amazing oh it looks it was expensive but oh man it's really good I think this like the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf we've seen this like there seems to be a chain here um it's beautiful honestly inside like there's good working space and like really nice comfy chairs reminds me of a Starbucks so if you're a digital Nomad you need it's not to work this would be a good one so we've been in Manila for a little while now we haven't done a ton of exploring and today is really that first day but what we've noticed so far is that there's no shortage of Comforts and conveniences here in Manila oh my god there are so many like uh restaurants and chains and shopping centers and so many great like places to get a good coffee and just yeah be immersed in like this Mega City it was a sign I just saw and it said that because there's a ton of cats here which is like kind of weird that it says that the cat population here is actually really controlled so they catch them they they are new to them and then they release them back here and then volunteers feed them so they ask you not to feed them because they get lots of food oh that's cool wow wow trippy this is the future folks newest billboard it's on the it's got a corner the billboard has a corner that's pretty that's pretty cool well look that's so cool you know I gotta say I swear I have seen more dogs and strollers than I have seen babies in strollers people really love their dogs here yeah I love it I love it thank you so that was the Manila Metro Network holy man sometimes you're gonna be very busy yeah but it's actually like pretty smooth like easy to get a ticket easy to jump on board it's simple to use you just gotta be ready to be squashed like sardines yeah but now we are starving and we're looking for lunch and although there are lots of good options around us there is a place that I've been very excited to visit and uh it's not the first for me been there a long time ago but it will be the first vertical I'm so excited those are so cool those are the tricycles and uh we haven't been on one yet uh but they're everywhere I really want to take one today and yeah we really want to get on one I'm hoping we can also Nicole just told me that the guy on the tricycle did one of these a very classic Filipino in fact I have lots of pictures of me like six or seven years old you know buds yeah first coming to Canada doing this what is that I don't know why we do it's just one of those things this is very Filipino don't laugh at me I'm doing that we should make that our thumbnail There It Is I've been waiting like years this is the legendary Filipino Jollibee one of the most popular if not the most popular fast food chain in the Philippines I think their specialty is like mostly fried chicken and rice whatever you want okay but there's spaghetti and other Filipino good foods like Filipino style spaghetti it is super good I've always wanted to eat a job it's been a long long time over ah it's almost over years I'm learning so much about Mikko so one of the things that you can buy here is rice and a burger patty and he used to do this at home we'd have leftover burgers and he would just cook up rice and just have the Patty with the rice and I'm like what are you doing I never knew that I stole that off from the jollibee's menu it's in your blood it's in my blood I guess I thought it was just my own concoction because I wanted some mean rice I'm pretty sure this is rice oh yeah it's rice I actually thought it was like a little burger patty I saw people getting on like a burger patty and chicken that's a lot no it's rice just to be clear I'm pretty sure you can yeah a burger patty and chicken oh great game that actually smells amazing do I use these really okay it feels very strange to eat fried chicken with a fork and a spoon but here we are I assume I assume I'm supposed to put some of this on here right how am I doing are you still doing good all right oh my God it's very good it's like elevated KFC that is really good gravy what if we get fried chicken Amigo's family we buy KFC but then in my head you get KFC and Fries but they always made rice and we had cabs in rice now I get it this is where that comes from it's a beautiful thing fried chicken and rice now Nicole finally gets guess where it's coming from I understand it took years but we're here oh that was great it was so good this is so good right now I would say that they should put up a Jolly Bee in every corner of the city and every street corner but I think that's already happened because there's jollibee's everywhere so good it tastes like home all right so we're gonna try the spaghetti now the spaghetti is like very different in the Philippines it's not like the spaghetti we would get in North America or Europe the spaghetti sauce is a little bit sweeter than you would expect and my favorite although not Nicole's favorite but they have like small pieces of hot dogs in it yeah okay you're gonna try this bite because I won't eat hot dog oh my God we're good I don't eat hot dogs so we're gonna just try the so exactly how my mom used to make it sweet spaghetti sauce uh hot dogs a little bit of cheese that was very good it's really sweet I think I gotta love our time here all right we finished our Joby lunch that was amazing I feel like the time just like disappeared like all that fried chicken made us a little bit sleepy honestly I'm actually quite tired but we just crossed the street and we're now at Rizzo Park and it's a beautiful Green Space really big Park uh there's a very famous Filipino man Jose Rizzo we'll talk about him more as we get to the Bane statue but the park was named after him and right now it's just a really nice walking area lots of people around it looks like there would be I think a fountain here like there's a big water just like turned on there I wish it was on I bet it's beautiful maybe there's a cool light show or something that we don't know about maybe all right as we make our way to this statue I thought it would take a second to share our impression so far of the Philippines well I guess kind of really only on manila but so far so we got out of the Philippines and I have to say a few things so I love that here in Manila we're very lucky in that most people speak really good English I didn't know if it's common knowledge but Philippines has two national languages Tagalog like Filipino and English so here in Manila especially everyone speaks English which is a real treat very easy to get around yeah it makes it very simple I also love that like as a female traveler I just feel really comfortable here I get to wear what I want I could just I don't it doesn't matter how I look I fit in and no one's like no one's giving me lots of stairs just like looks of curiosity but uh no more than any other person that is really lovely however holy man traffic yeah traffic could be crazy yeah and besides that I'm just like I love the people hey yeah it's like everyone's friendly and kind really polite really polite I think that's a great way to put it I love that people are so plate like you walk on the street and you're in each other's ways they're like make effort to get out of your way and they bump in you they're like oh I'm so sorry I'm so sorry so in a lot of ways it actually feels very similar to home in Canada that way like people are just really conscious of like this space they're taking up and how they're imposing on you it's really nice what I'll also say about walking around this park I feel like this is probably the only place in the world that maybe just maybe I might find a statue of a prominent figure that might look like me we made it to the original Monument I would say it looks like you I don't know maybe he's got really high cheekbones he looks pretty nice he could be an uncle maybe maybe so he is a very very cool guy there's some signs around here we've been doing some reading so he is a what was the word you used Patriot oh political activist political activist I liked this in the late s uh particularly when the Spanish were still colonizing Philippines so the Spanish were here from like the s to the very late s so this guy was actually killed for treason against the Spanish in and what is really cool is Philippines actually gained independence in so his death was one of the big things that really sparked a huge part of the movement and to get out from under the Spanish also what is really cool to me about this particular uh like sculpture is that his the remains of Rizzo the guy Jose Rizal actually moved here and they're under the statue they're moving in . wow I know right the statue's been here since the very early s so we're entering just about to enter like the walled City here which is called intramurals intramurals um but anyways there's this beautiful garden we're like oh let's walk in there and the guards are like harvesting mangoes from the trees here whoa hey you see that that was caught it wow we've made it to intramuros intramuros I said it right I always forget the words which is like uh walled City uh in Manila it's a very old city and it was built by the Spanish built by Spanish in the s and I guess it was meant to be like their political capital of Asia like the Spanish Empire's political capital of Asia so nowadays it's just like a beautiful place to come around because of colonial buildings like they're very beautiful here yeah there's lots to look at the architecture is really neat it's like their Spanish home Basin they've left over left all the buildings behind and now they're all bars and restaurants now they're all bars restaurant and cafes which is all right churches and then and there's a massive Church huge beautiful church right here I don't know the name but we're gonna see if we can find out but yeah it is uh it's just nice to walk around intramuros and gonna feel for the very Lively atmosphere atmosphere people are walking around taking lots of photos drinking coffees very nice all right so we're inside the Manila Cathedral now and it's a beautiful Church it is very well decorated at the center at the very front there's like a very gorgeous Statue Of An Angel it looks really really nice fun fact to know about the Philippines a lot of people are Christian I think it's like Roman Catholic is a religious base and then I think maybe another is like other variations of Christianity and then the rest of that is like Hinduism Muslim very cool foreign just like that we are in Fort Santiago which is like within intramuros it is like a what do you call it like a fort so it's like a stronghold um that the Spanish built soon after they like built and declared Manila a city they built this every every good walled City needs a port right yeah it's easy to get into though not very big defenses just pesos each and we're inside the Fortress it's beautiful lots of Green Space beautiful very easy way to go for Spanish weren't in a country is if they have a plaza de armas the plaza thought of us are we back in South America I feel like I'm suddenly transported to like I don't know Cuenca or something just like that we're at the water just get popped out right the water here Nicole would like me to point out that there's a guy on a boat very excited about it and she's very excited about it this spot is actually really cool because I can see like across the river there's like this obviously residential area and I can like see a bunch of guys playing basketball which is a big deal in the Philippines and like lots of very tiny little houses along the river here I think that is something that's been really interesting about Manila as we go around there are obviously like really rich places like BCG where we were earlier today the GC Mika says like we were earlier today and then there is also a lot of poverty here here in Manila and I think seeing like small areas like that with houses just kind of over on the river it's a small little piece of that so you definitely can find both here while we're at the end of the fort I think this is probably the best place to end the Vlog I actually learned a lot about Filipino history and culture as did I it's really cool yeah as did I hope you guys enjoyed coming around with us there's so much to do here in Manila this is just a taste of it we hope you enjoyed it checking out the city with us today make sure you hit subscribe we will catch you guys in the next one thanks for watching I love that part of Filipino culture where singing is like a really big thing it's a very musical cultures because this guy's been training on the karaoke machine you know it's

so this vlog is gonna be exciting guys because i will make a pandesal dough but first um let's make some dutch food okay i'm gonna show you one dutch meal so dutch food is really simple okay and what is so nice about dutch food uh we call it you know and i have a back here this is uh onions and carrots okay just onions and carrots okay uh and we call this hot spot fruit means vegetables okay and then here is a pork meat and potatoes and we're gonna basically use these ingredients a little bit of butter and that's about it some salt and then after that i'm gonna make a panda salt dough it's going to be exciting because i want to bring it to my parents you know a real filipino breakfast i want to make cinnamon from the sauce and i'm thinking to actually bring them some sausages like a longanisa okay so for the dutch food first i'm gonna peel these potatoes i'm using this uh potato peeler see it's very easy just like this to get the peel off and i think you call these patatas right in tagalog patatas but i noticed that in the philippines it's very hard to get potatoes and if you can get the potatoes they're quite expensive actually so i'm wondering if you can get uh potatoes easily in your region in the philippines so then once uh the peel is off i just cut it in a few pieces like that so now i wash the potatoes a little bit add some water and we're gonna add salt quite a bit of salt and then let's turn the heat on okay now this is pork shoulder it's about grams of pork shoulder okay so i'm gonna fry that in a little bit of butter just like that i think that's quite maraming i put a little bit too much butter but it gives more flavor diba now the nice thing about this food is so simple like i said you just what you do you put all the onions the hot let me open that back a little bit more guys ah that's better no so see how easy this is you just put everything the hot and then you cover okay we fry the pork shoulder in the butter now i can only fit three at a time so i'm gonna put three first and then the other two okay i'm very excited for the new vlogs because uh this is gonna be a continuous vlog okay so it will be continuous series on pinoy planet like i said i'm preparing for panda salt though after this we're gonna make panda salt dough we're gonna make a nice filipino breakfast for my parents so last video before this one it was the best moments of the food that i brought to my parents based on your recommendations on your um on the moments that you like the most i got the feedback from you so i put all together in one video if you have not seen that one yet you can uh please go ahead to watch it um so the next one is gonna be filipino breakfast so it is time to flip them over the pork meat let's go see not yet let me let me put it back because it's still not let's wait a little while longer so flip them around and you see now they're becoming nice and brown okay and the onion carrots and potatoes are boiling i wish that i could okay so the pork meat is done look at that guys so of course i've put a little bit of salt on both sides uh so these are very tasty for sure and now we can have a look at the carrots and potatoes and a little bit more thyme and also i'm going to remove some water so now i removed all the excess water there's still a little bit of water there that's okay and then we're going to use this thing to mesh everything okay smash it okay so now it's time to add some butter okay always nice i think about two tablespoons or so that is very tasty so and basically that's it so i just mixed everything the butter the potatoes the carrots the onions a little bit of salt you can also add a little bit of pepper if you like and then you just put it on a plate with the meat that's it so now it's time to play a little bit of basketball i'm gonna play basketball i like to play basketball so the sun is out let's do a little game and then when we come back i will try a few moments later so it's evening i finished the workout i just had a workout and now i want to prepare for lunga nissa okay so just a second i actually bought these sausages today these are japanese sausages but i couldn't find the longanisa in the store i think they don't sell it any longer so therefore i'm gonna try making my own longanisa because it needs to be filipino diba now i will add a little bit of salt okay some athene not so much because i also want to add a little bit of soy sauce filipino soy sauce sugar let's add a few then i have sweet paprika powder okay let's add quite a bit of sweet paprika powder gives it a nice um yeah a little bit of sweet smoky flavor kind of thing set up maraming diba that is quite a lot so then i'm not sure if you normally do it but i'll be adding a little bit of filipino vinegar cane vinegar so just uh maybe two two or three so it's time to mix everything and then i'll put it in the ref for uh like two hours you know i changed my mind um there's no black pepper so i'm gonna add a little bit of hot sauce okay just a tiny bit quintillon and then in the freezer overnight okay we'll put um put this on the way scale let's do like uh grams so then i'm just rolling this in plastic i think the shape already looks like uh longanisano luco it became many longanisa and actually they're all grams but this one is only .\n",

awesome my hair is in the humidity that is the best part about humidity we are off to the fireflies okay we are here and it sure got dark on the drive over I'm excited about this I think it's going to be beautiful I'm glad that this is guaranteed it's so Charming the people here in donsil are so kind they are so nice I love this community and I I feel really bad that the whale sharks weren't there today uh because I really want to sell you on this community and help their economy and and come here so I know they're going to be there for you this rain just won't give us a break it is just as soon as we got in the boat it started down pouring and I think we might be having a little trouble with the boat literally said that the fireflies were guarantee it's less than that nothing is guaranteed but take it in stride and laugh it off okay three go we're clapping because the fireflies will respond to the Noise by lighting up more there they did it they twinkled up a bit more it's really pretty to see the fireflies in the trees and then go right into the sky the stars are out already it's a beautiful night who'da thought after that downpour we just had this guy is clear and we can see the stars so Ryan's built right there there are over species of fireflies in the world only one here in donzo and it's the smallest species it's about a half a centimeter long it's about half the size of the fireflies where I grew up in Indiana in the USA these are also very small like golden color as opposed to the the black ones that we had when I was a kid we're getting a little quiz we're supposed to guess how can you tell if it's a male or female my guess was that maybe the lights in the front for a boy and in the back for a girl and Phil and Brooklyn say that the male's light is brighter that's a pretty good guess Colt what's your guess I'm gonna think of the easiest explanation for this which is the females have a brighter light than the males we notice there are fireplaces keep on flying around the tree and there are fireplaced so just staying in the tree right so those fireflies that active in flying those are the male fireflies and the females are the one that is just staying in a tree and continuously blinking let's say that they are the lazy one female fireplace are lazy one even though from afar it looks like these are just all the same color of Lights there are four different shades or tints or tones there's yellow there's a pale red there's a bluish and there's a green and I can close up you can really see that but from far away you can't our new question is how many eggs do we think that each female Firefly can produce my guess is uh three a hundred or two hundred oh six to eight thousand each of the female Firefly they can produce an approximately eggs and on the can survive so almost a hundred Brooklyn got it right and during low tide is when the females go down and they lay their eggs in the mud they also kind of live together and cluster around the same tree like they have a home and they all stay around that area and the neighboring family will be next door and they kind of stay in their own territory but they might mix a little bit did I get that right they cannot mix at all they stay in their own territories so they have their own little homes and no mixing despite Mother Nature's Best attempt to keep us from all of our activities today uh we succeeded perseverance and grit and at the end of the day we got to see these beautiful fireflies it's a beautiful evening the night is still young we're not ready to call it quits we heard some good things about this Barracuda place down here restaurant bar just a couple of resorts down from our Alicia Resort so we're going to stop in here have a little dinner maybe a couple of cocktails the path to get here is super super muddy it's just off of the road and I think we've got to be close to the beach though it's not mud anymore it's sand now wow and lovely little porch seating and I know Phil's got his eye on this board over here with all the cocktails listed and Aaron's going to be very interested in the food menu with some really fresh Seafoods jack fish Barracuda of course Sashimi tuna calamari and they do pasta here so you can get a Bolognese or a pork in vermu what are you thinking baby oh I've got my eye on those prawns all right yeah I'm definitely diving into the margarita because Juliet said it was strong and that sounds good to me fresh squeeze juice and it is strong Juliet is a who this is her place and she is Filipino but she actually lived overseas for decades she was in Europe for years doing Chef work the United States for years I think she said her husband is German but she's a real character we're gonna have to eat fast monkeys are tired we are so close to the water it's pitch dark so we can't even see it but you can hear it and actually right up here at the very end you can see the little white caps as they break on the beach I think we're like feet from the shore it's gonna be beautiful during the daytime anytime you go to a new like Beach Town especially your friends tell you oh there's this one place that you have to go to and I really get the sense that here it's Barracuda and it's because of Juliet she's a fantastic Chef so if you come to Donut Soul definitely come by Barracuda I am such a happy camper these prawns are ridiculous they're ginormous they're like little lobsters they're so big I'm gonna be stuck by two prawns and Phil got the pork in vermouth and cream sauce this is delicious wow Juliet is the real deal and it's like the little places here nobody would know about unless you actually come here and stumbled upon it well we're telling you about it so when you come to donsil you got to get to Barracuda we're going to take our time oh the head fell off we're gonna take our time and really enjoy this dinner this is the best prawn I have ever tasted she put like a garlic rub on it it is the best flavor prawn I've ever had good night my favorite part of the locals here is probably Carmel she offered me her sweater and hat to stay warm gave us a bunch of snacks for the boats and lots of cuddles you know how much you love cuddles my favorite memory of the locals here was when I was trying to open up a coconut and they came running out with a butcher knife to help me I really enjoyed talking to Juliet last night learning about her her life in Europe and in the US and then here in the Philippines and she's had to struggle through so much earthquakes and tsunami and she really cares about this community and her food and it really shows in her food every tsunami do you mean by tsunami I meant typhoon I'd say my favorite memory is from walking downtown last night and just going past every little group of locals every little street food vendor every little retail establishment and getting really warm smiles from every single person you can tell that they're just very happy to have tourists here experiencing the local flavor and I think we all just nailed it like we can swim with whale sharks all around the world in the coming months but don't Seoul Hospitality that can only be found here it's family focused from our resort to the whale shark trip to the river tour these things were literally provided by passionate husbands and wives brothers and sisters working together to provide a welcoming experience for visitors who come in search of Adventure it's a testament to the Integrity of the donzo community the same compassion that we've experienced as guests is reflected in how they treat nature I mean this is a place that just years ago had no real tourism industry and once they realized what they had they chose to build it out the right way to focus on responsible ethical conservation and that's the real natural resource of donsil not the wildlife but the people we may have come up empty-handed in the search for whale sharks on this particular visit but we're leaving with Full Hearts for the privilege of spending a few magical days with another community of inspiring Filipinos but now we have to say goodbye as we're off to chargao hit that subscribe button and come along with us for more Philippines Magic we are the Lockwoods Erin Phil Reagan Brooklyn and Colt we're traveling the world to experience up close and in person all the natural wonders and distinct cultures that our kids would otherwise be consuming only through textbooks and TV we think it's a better way to learn and we're working hard to fund this little experiment in the hope that our kids will grow up wiser Kinder and more grateful for the beauty of our diverse planet and its people\n",

      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: He must to be dead, but all these crabs, I think have dug little holes. Sort of rolled up the little bits of sand, but they are everywhere. It's so like satisfying walking on this soft little bit of sand here and look at all these like little squiggly ones. They're like little, uh, dog poos.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: Anyways, we're gonna walk up this way. I haven't walked up this side yet, so, uh, we'll go and do that.\n",

      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: All this has just been done.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: Massive crab in there.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: who knows what's out here in the Philippines that can get you killed, could be a massive venomous jellyfish that you die instantly.\n",

      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: They camouflage really well though.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: You see a couple of them.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: When you walking by, they kind of feel your foot steps underneath, run off into their little holes.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: Guarantee it everywhere.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: Look how big they are. They're moving.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: Oh, that's one now. Oh, I thought that was like the out mark of another one.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: There's so many here. They're all under the sand. Some have moved, I think.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: They've obviously realized that they're gonna end up here for a couple hours stuck in the sun.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: That's so cool. Those are really cool.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: Kind of like beach restaurant, they got music blaring on the speaker.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: Later tonight for like a dinner on the beach.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: I think actually my hotel maybe has, uh, a few seats on the beach area that you can use to, uh, to eat your dinner at, which would be beautiful, you know, as long as it's not raining. But I think, I don't know, starting to get a little bit more gray, so the rain might be coming soon.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: Do you guys see what I see?\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: Yeah yeah. Ah, so you have to push it up.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: You need, uh, big muscles.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: Do you need, you need, do you need my help?\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: Does it get much better than that?\n",

      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: You just go in the white sand, wait, Yeah. But if you just pass, like where's, the horses are going there, so, oh. That's where the horses are going.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: Ah, I see.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: Damn if I was staying another day, I'd come out on the boat, but I'm leaving tomorrow.\n",

      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: No, no, I think I I'll come back in maybe like one month because I need to see the chocolate Hills.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: I have not seen them.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: That is good for sunset.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: So hopefully the cloud cover stays away and we can enjoy a nice little sunset for ourselves.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: They're kind of, these ones are like a little bit more smooth, but definitely not the, uh, oh, not the most pleasant things to stand on.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: But earlier on when I was over there in, in the morning, I would've shown like over here and now I was actually going to comment on these cranes that had been, uh, established, obviously this part of Bohol.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: So they're already getting the, uh, the foundations and buildings ready for that.\n",

      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: What are you shooting birds.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: I remember when I was growing up, we used to like make slingshots and stuff, but now there like generation, at least in Australia, kids, those that age, they're just, all they do is sit on their iPads and iPhones and play video games. You gotta get out, enjoy be a kid again, get dirty, be adventurous and adventurous.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: So it's gotten a little bit dark.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: The cloud is starting to come in.\n",

      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: Hair is probably a mess and I am tired as can be.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: So we've gotta make this quick, but, uh, there's the kind of day that we have upon us. I will be checking out in about an hour and a half, have a flight that I need to get to, as I was saying, maybe yesterday that at.\n",

And then, uh, I was originally thinking, I was saying, oh, it'd be so perfect to go for like a morning swim. But I realized that I have a flight, so I can't have wet clothes on me cause I need to pack up all my things, which, you know, there's everything here.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: um, so yeah, we can't be having gee my hair is a mess.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: I'll tell you what the weather gets a whole lot better when there's an infinity pool, overlooking the water or the ocean.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: I think somebody's getting ready for jet ski, but, uh, yeah, let's go get breakfast. Honestly, I swear this is like the hottest part of the day.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: I'm not hungry at all.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: As I was saying, my sleep has just been absolutely ridiculous lately, going to bed at like : AM.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: It's getting better as the, uh, the day goes on.\n",

      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: This is hard. One handed guys.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: We got approximately an hour until we need to, uh, head off to the hotel.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: What's this guy doing?\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: Definitely recommend this place.\n",
      "Video Id: --8n6A8Q6M0, Segment: well, over an hour, I'd say, uh, but hopefully you guys enjoyed coming along to this hotel with me. So we're gonna finish up the video here, everybody as always thank you so much for watching, chase your dreams, and we will see you all in the next one.\n",
      "Video Id: e2W9UaVhsX0, Segment: of that is because of the people i mean if it wasn't for some of our subscribers we would have never visited half the places we've gone to especially like at the transcendental highway we've had our friend who took us out for lunch we had our other friend take us around our neighborhood and have us try different foods and now we've had this friend here having us explore balamban and getting to know its people and its rich history first off we're in somebody's home but it's not just somebody it's now our friend so how this all started with one of our subscribers reach out to us on instagram started to have a conversation which we love you guys know this right now we love talking to you guys and then it just turned into a friendship a genuine friendship and then we got to know more about each other our lives and then they introduced us to other people that they know and here we are sitting in the home somebody we had no direct connection with no time not whatsoever but it's from the the connections we made from our subscribers in subscribers so to have this extension means a lot to us because it makes it feel less homesick and makes us feel warm and fuzzy on the inside and you guys are part of the family because you guys are the like we do this because we're documenting our time but it means nothing if we don't have people in the other and even this aside guys our whole entire time we've been in the philippines these are the interactions we've had like the people have welcomed us like there was not even one ounce of hesitation like smiles like i know this for me this is delaying the smiles because literally that's all i received there's literally nothing but love we've made some of the best relationships and connections because being in the philippines it's true we might not show every every interaction we have i know we're vloggers but sometimes we just like to immerse ourselves so like we're not gonna film everything but like we've had some of the best times behind the scenes connecting with the people of the philippines and again i i don't know i don't know how to say it but like thank you for being so welcoming now it's like we legit mean it we would have never had this experience had we not put our trust in you all and getting to know what places to go to in the philippines what to do what not to do as foreigners and just all your recommendations are always always like on the forefront of our minds so thank you thank you thank you don't be shy if you are in cebu or if you happen anywhere or we happen to be where you live yeah let us know we'll meet you up for a quick meal quick chat anything to get to know where you're from who you are and places that we should visit we're down to meet up basically we're we're not oh hell when it's strong um we're down to meet people like we like to talk we like to learn this is uh we learn something new every single day and it's something you can't go and google and learn this stuff you wouldn't we wouldn't know half the things we've learned if we were just relying on google or like the internet mm-hmm true it's it's because of you guys and what you tell us and teach us so yeah you see us say hi do not be afraid if we look busy we're probably not or we might be but still come say hi we can't tell you the amount of times we sat at the starbucks and we've been approached and we're taken back by it because they're like um do they want a table or wait are you speaking to us we like look back oh awesome oh yeah hi yeah so kind we feel at home we do we feel at home in the philippines that's the best is reason one of why we love the philippines is for its food we're not food expertise i mean we bought we watch a couple of episodes of masterchef and hell's kitchen but we would say that the food here has been surprising to say the least i think the best part about it is there's a huge variety like it doesn't every island you go to every region it's different so it feels like you're always trying something new which is great because we're not used to that actually and guys if you go to a home and they're cooking dinner for you it's like a course meal am i wrong the best saying that you will leave the philippines knowing is that you will never go hungry if you visit any filipinos home i mean yeah you're just not you're going to be stuck you're going to be like to the point where like i don't want to eat if they're like no you got to eat if it wasn't for all these invites that we've received over the weekend to visit their homes we would have never ever been exposed to the filipino food that we've had thus far i think our friends thank god we've met them and they've been put into our lives we're very thankful for that they've they've let us try everything everything we've gone way out of our comfort zone wait and the result of that is that we're walking away with some really really favorite yummy food that we now know that if we were to look at it at a restaurant or even a street food vendor we'll know what it is what it should taste like and we'll be comfortable ordering it knowing that it's something that we enjoy eating yeah it's just and it's funny because when we first got here the filipino food we tried we liked it but it was like you know it's like i like it yeah but i have no interest in trying it again type of thing but then when we met our friends that would like home cook meals and explain it all and prep and we'd help or see it like it just tastes completely different so home food is just the best food yeah like fried sardines i'm obsessed with them cassava ube uh really good dessert okay first off ube is mine it is and he knows that i'm obsessed with ube if it has ube in it sign me up i'm gonna eat it i'm probably gonna love it i don't know what it is about this stuff i had no idea what ube was until i got to the philippines and now every time i see it i order it i end up loving it and you know what that's my favorite food in the philippines he's an uber kind of sort of a connoisseur so i know what i'm talking about guys also we've learned that the food here brings people together if you know them you invite them everybody helps like it's it's the type of life the filipinos are very very very kind people and this isn't this is a very generalization because everyone reading that has been beyond kind so it makes us want to have that type of camaraderie whenever we have a we know food brings people together but we haven't seen them brought together like this right would you agree no i agree i mean they asked this guy i don't know how they trusted this guy to cut the lechon at one of the fiestas they didn't ask me she told me okay you're cutting this it's like okay i can't say no to lida food brings people together and it's brought us closer to the culture and closer to people that we normally wouldn't connect with so i'm very thankful to go patrick oh my god this kid does not know how to get patrick what are you doing pee star say hi take him anywhere all right guys so reason million whatever infinite reason number whatever this is that we love the philippines guys there's so much to do and we don't mean just like go to a mall and do this no we're talking like hiking volcanoes cliff jumping like stuff you don't get to do anywhere else in the world in the philippines has literally allowed us to live our adventure dreams guys this place is magic like absolute magic it's not wrong i mean that slogan of it's more fun in the philippines couldn't be any more accurate and if it weren't for this beautiful country we wouldn't be tapping into our inner child and thanks to you all we have fully embraced it with all of our jokes all of our karaoke moments we've had on our travels and now bringing in the third person into our family cute little pizza i mean we would have had none of that had it been through our experiences here in the philippines it's not wrong guys he's not wrong we are living our adventure dreams like this being in the philippines makes us want to go to survivor to be on what is the other show amazing the amazing rate like all these things it's because the philippines offers adventures and you do not get this anywhere else in the world like you will be pushed out of your comfort zone and that's a great great great thing that's the thing the philippines is taught me to get out of your comfort zone go live life like we're living life and there's still more to do i mean like we want to hike mount april we want to go through the sand dunes no don't give away everything we're going to do no no no no no no no just have to stay tuned you want to stay soon all right guys so you made it this far and we figured well now it's time to give you the news we've been loving our time here in the philippines there's still seven thousand more islands or so to explore and we can't see ourselves reading anytime soon guys when i said we've had the best time of our lives because of the philippines i mean it like there is no reason we have no we have no want or desire to go anywhere else anytime soon none whatsoever because it's just you guys are just freaking incredible so we extended our visa how long we've sent our visas for another six months six months you guys for another six months guys like we

      "Video Id: iM43LN5gdgs, Segment: I don't know If you guys can tell us in the comment section I want to try the combo of the meat and the rice together Maybe it's better I really like how they cooked the eggplant I am quite surprised by the portion of the lechon that we got It is not that expensive So yeah, pretty good deal I just remember that they they gave us that Let's try this one Maybe we can put this one in the other one So we can try both of them A little bit spicy Not too much but I like it It's a little bit sour too.\n",

      "Video Id: iM43LN5gdgs, Segment: Now we are going to a mall just near by Ayala mall I think this is one of the most famous one here in Cebu I guess We'll see Wow, I have the impression that here is really a lively part of Cebu There's really many restaurants and a lot of people too Many cars too Have to look everywhere when we walk because sometime you have sidewalk but sometime you don't So you have to share the same road as the cars and the motorbikes So it's a bit a little more challenging to walk But it's the funny part.\n",
      "Video Id: iM43LN5gdgs, Segment: Oh I think this is the other famous place to eat for the lechon House of Lechon.\n",
      "Video Id: iM43LN5gdgs, Segment: Wow, this is pretty huge and I feel good inside the mall The AC is not too strong Many shops that we know like H&M DIY DIY reminds us of Malaysia actually Wow, there's a lot of people here What's going on? We are really impressed by the mall We know that there is another big one SM city Cebu We wonder which one is the biggest? We could not find a lechon restaurant in the mall so we are going to look for it outside Ah the area around Ayala Centre is more modern with high buildings and there is a lot of condos too around and we also noticed some offices like company like we saw Amazon sign, accenture, grab maybe here it's more business district? I'm not sure but yeah we saw another another side of Cebu and it's really interesting and I also noticed that the Jeepney is kind of different from the Manila ones here it's looks more like a like a van Interesting to see that can be different between Manila and Cebu It looks like there is a night market here We can go and see Unlimited!!? But we are not that hungry.. haha We didn't stay very long at the night market it looks really nice but it started raining and just before going I just took an avocado drink look nice huh cheers So we found a nice restaurant here It's called Ayam.. No. Not ayam Ayer, ayer lechon Ayer lechon so we just wanted to try one that is like not famous yeah not really famous for I don't know if it's famous or..? Maybe it is Maybe it is yeah But we choose this one just because it's near our hotel actually But anyway it's just like a simple meal It costs only So we just wanted to just to know what kind of taste we can have in a normal lechon restaurant they gave us a sauce also but I will just try just like that. It's quite good It's a little bit too salted for me I think it's vinegar with a bit of chili too The same? yeah it's kind of similar But this is more sour.\n",
      "Video Id: iM43LN5gdgs, Segment: Okay let's try the skin now Mm.\n",
      "Video Id: iM43LN5gdgs, Segment: This one is quite good it's very crispy and it's not that salty compared to the meat So yeah it's quite good If you have to choose only one restaurant, which one will you choose? Rico Rico lechon Yeah I have to say that Rico is better you can feel that here the meat maybe it's a little more dry and it's too salted for me Rico is really tendery, juicy and it's not too salted And the sauce?\n",

      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: I'm more easy going.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Just enjoying, the peaceful times in this city, Baguio.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: I'm gonna, I'm gonna go and Google and find at least one thing that's out of this, kinda like, area, where I'm just spending all my time in this kinda area, which is nice, but I'll try and find something to do on the outskirts or something.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: So I don't know what way the day is going to go, but I'm gonna get out and about today, guys. So, all my time in Baguio so far, I've been spending it around this kinda like central area. I've been to the mall, the park, the markets over there.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: It's this kinda central area.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Paying $ a night.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Anyway, I'm planning on getting out and about today, guys.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: At least this place that I've chosen to go to today, Mount Kalugong, over there somewhere, there's an actual hiking trail, so yeah, apparently only an hour's maximum hiking, so plenty of, PM right now, plenty of time for me to get there, do my hike and come back. And The way I'm gonna get there, guys, is, I'm just gonna take a taxi there. I'm gonna go down onto the street and just find a taxi, to take me there. Because, I've researched that from the main town, down there, like outside the market or something, you can get a jeepney. You know, these kinda like, pickup truck things, that are really cheap.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: You can get a jeepney for like pesos, that will take you most of the way there, but you have to hike an extra minutes up a hill, to get to the starting point of the trek, or to enter the cultural village or whatever. So what I'm thinking is, I'll take a taxi there, all the way to the, you know, the cultural village, the start point of the trail, proper.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: So I'm not wasting...\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: That's not gonna be much fun.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: And get dropped off in the centre, there.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: So, yeah, that is the plan, guys.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Bro, you working now? ? ???\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: - Too far? Good for you.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Okay, so I just seen this guy, just parked up. He's gonna buy some medicine or something.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: A longer distance means a higher fare, right?\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: But then, yeah, he has to come back without a fare, so we'll see. I'll talk to him.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Yes. - Yes, okay.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: And how many minutes driving?\n",

      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: It's like a degree angle or something.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: They say they close the gate at PM, so I've got plenty of time.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Okay, and the ride was .\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Okay, that was good. Oh, looks like you've got a customer coming back.\n",

      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Okay, a little tip for you.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Ah, yes. Yes, yes.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: They were just hanging around. I think they were waiting for somebody to get dropped off.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Yes, walking. Yeah, walking. I'll go now, yes.\n",

      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: To the moon?\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: - That's where the crescent moon is.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: They have viewpoints and hangout spots, kind of like that, and...\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Ah, feels good.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: I know.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: I can hear it, I can hear the thunder.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: And the visibility isn't great, so I better, I better start walking then.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: There will be a start?\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: If you go straight.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: And another one, was like a crescent moon or something like that.\n",

      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: - Yeah, it's okay. Okay, thank you.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: So they've built this kinda, mesh wire, metal kinda trail.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: To who though, to who?\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: I have to register?\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Okay. Okay. Oh, I get a stamp.\n",

      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: This is meant to be a short one.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: It doesn't even look like that. I don't even see it getting any higher than here.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: You know, the swings and all that.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: I would normally keep it until I got to the peak or something, but like I say, it doesn't even seem like it's gonna be much of a challenge, so just consume it now, shall I?\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: I haven't had a good swing ride like that for quite a few years, guys.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: But it's just, we're in a cloud.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: As always, in Baguio, there's never been completely clear weather since I got here. You're just up so high that you're in the clouds all the time. Maybe if you came here at like AM or something, first thing, for sunrise, you'd get the amazing view.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: I'm too lazy to wake up at am.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: And looks like got a family having a picnic here.\n",

      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: How are you? Are you enjoying your McDonald's?\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Or a sundae. Okay, nice.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Oh, it's not too bad.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Let's try not to slip, here.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Look at this. Look at this valley down there.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Listen to how quiet it is.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Just hear a few dogs barking.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Okay, I'll make my way, further on the trail, so I don't disturb this lovely family.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: I think this is just the top.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Like, Somebody said it took them minutes to get to the top and minutes back down. Well that took me, if you're excluding the swing ride, that took me like minutes.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: I'm gonna leave it here.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Ah, they do overnight stays, here.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Okay, they have a big 'ol meal. Okay, good.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: I'm gonna make use of them.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: I was actually looking for somewhere up there that might be private.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Refreshed. Refreshed, guys.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: And more swings.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: I'll have another swing ride. That's what I'll do, guys. I'll have another swing ride.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: That's the best thing about this place so far, the swings.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: You guys going?\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Yeah, you can go ahead. Oh, you want me to go first?\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Let's try it. Pull myself up.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Are you okay? Okay, yeah?\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Then I got these from the Eiger store.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Are you helping him?\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Yeah, yeah I gotta be careful.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: And not too many people here, either.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: The view of this valley down there.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: How did they get the stock up and down? Did they have to do rock climbing or is there another way? I think, actually, they've got a wee path down there.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Maybe it's just for them.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: That's all farmland down there, in the valley.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Ah, on the other side.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: That's why it doesn't look recognisable to me at all.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: This is somewhere totally different.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: It looks like there's some kinda athletics track there.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: And a lot of farmland.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: It's gotta be done quickly.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: With brain freeze.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: It's just all the cream that's left. I need a spoon or something to eat that.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: But, yeah, success.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Yeah, I know.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: I'm trolling you because you got my one wrong, so I deliberately got your one wrong.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: You're like a wee polar bear, aren't you?\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: They surely get a lot of exercise coming up and down these steps.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: And back here. The easy way.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: To this actual place from Baguio, I took the easy way there with the taxi.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Now I'm gonna take the difficult way back. I'm gonna walk down that big hill and then try and find a jeepney. I'm not gonna go to that 'To the Moon' place because I could see it from that cafe.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: It's like a crescent moon made from, like plastic or something.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: But, yeah, I'm done here.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Gonna make my way out. See you, guys.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Bye. - Bye bye. And somehow...\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: I'm jogging, not because I want to be jogging. I'm jogging because look how steep the, the hill is.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: I see there's one right there.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: So... Like some of them have the destination written on them.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: I need to get across the road, first.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: It's up to you, sir. Oh, it's up to me?\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Then it's easier.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Ah, okay, so it's depending on the distance.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: - Yes. Or the kilometres.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Okay, so we must be going about kilometres, so it's .\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: You will? Okay, good.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: There you go. Okay.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: He's given me a, a pen and paper, here.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Ah, okay, and people can sit in here as well?\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: I didn't know you could do that. I thought you always had to sit in the back.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: So it's like a personal business.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Most people seem to be paying, most people seem to be paying when they get on.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: So I've learned the system.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: I'll be taking these more often.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: They usually have, like, the the destination they're going to on the front.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: And I think people just flag them down and then they stop.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: He kinda has to drive and deal with the money at the same time.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: They would have a conductor who would deal with the money.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Okay, I'll take the money. Okay, it's mine now. Okay, there you go.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: They would have a conductor who would deal with the money and the driver would just drive.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Unless it's in like the really, really rural areas, where they're a bit more friendly and relaxed, but in the cities, no.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: It's like too rigid with the stops. But here it's like, you just see it, you flag it, and it's good.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Nice casual system.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: I don't know if the government, if the government will phase... You think the government are going to, like, phase this kind of transport out?\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: - Yes. Why?\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: They are going to modernise.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: So, he's saying the government are, they've got plans to phase these out, replace them with some, kinda like, clean energy, maybe government vehicles or something.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Just now, these are all privately owned.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: That's how they do it. And I'm passing the money back to him, and then it goes like that.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Look, all the way to the end.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Now we're full, or almost full.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: - Okay. Okay, that was good.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Let's see if I can get out and see if I can recognise this place. I don't know where we are at all. I'm gonna have to see where I am on Google Maps.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: So we're only about minutes walk away from the park. My hotel's on the other side of the park to where we've been dropped off, but yeah, that was good.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: I can manage now with my two strong legs.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: The strong jeepney got me most of the way to where I want to be.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Guys, I'm gonna get myself a late lunch up there.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: I was maybe gonna show you guys the night market that they have here, every night from pm onwards.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: With people right in front of you, behind you.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: There's actually a lot of food options here, in the food court.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: Sizzling steaks, a Pad Thai, loads of good stuff.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: I'd rather be in some, like, individual, quiet restaurant.\n",
      "Video Id: mcWEmkXF4ik, Segment: So I think those are upstairs. And that is all the people waiting for a taxi.\n",

      "Video Id: F9z7b9ei2Lg, Segment: really yeah two chicken two iced tea and like big pizza yeah to be honest a bundle that costs around a little bit less than Australian dollars pretty good deal if you eat it in Australia I think it's gonna be over or even Australian so yeah it's the value but I think so far this is the most expensive one let's not be happy maybe that can't go bad right lasagna and Hawaiian pizza I think I have quite a bit of expectation for pizza in general but I want to tell you guys a story when I was in kindergarten my teacher would make us pizza in kindergarten and I don't know why but in on Pizza there is peas like green peas and like it was disgusting it was just like the worst Pizza I had it's haunted my memories ever since in my childhood trauma I don't know but it's so disgusting I remember always when I was in kindergarten when I don't like something when it's macaroni with soup and everything you know the likes of it I would just pour it into my no the Highlight is I'll pull into my school bag so I don't have to eat because I cannot leave until I cannot leave until I eat everything so I just usually pour the soup and everything inside my school bag and my mom when she opened the bag I was like oh my goodness what's going on here so smart baby I think compared to the biggest pizza place in like fast food in Australia usually there is Domino's which is similar to Pizza Hut or similar to Greenwich here in the Philippines but uh Pizza the indominos is around usually if you get a special coupon there will be maybe around but this is a regular set in Australia it's only if you get a coupon but on average I think it's around Australian dollars yeah that that amount but yeah here are the I think the difference is also here they serve fried chicken and so on I think that's very common in other countries uh oh it's two two sets wow I thought it's one I'm gonna share one wow that's awesome okay all right let's let's try it I I wonder how different this Fried Chicken is compared to the other fast food chains how's the iced tea that so sweet it's okay maybe it is yeah just now we missed number because uh usually quite a number or I think you should just now open the machine no just now heard machine saying like oh they're called a number maybe I'm hallucinating then but uh this looks good all right let's dig in so on the menu today on the side dish we've got some fried chickens and I believe this is like a bread maybe like a cheese stick and also called lasagna and we've got some icy here and we're just missing the pizza which is coming along soon all right let's try this let's try it okay let's try it uh let's start from lasagna okay because I'm a fan of lasagna oh I'm gonna be transparent with you guys I've never been a fan of lasagna I don't know why but maybe my friends I always go to his birthday party and when I hit the lasagna I don't know why it's natural reaction yeah I remember when we lived in Seattle I give yeah there was a takeaway that was good let's see if this one matched that uh that one right there okay that's right feet mushroom inside okay one two three excuse me that's all right thank you thank you thank you that looks good it was you were already in my mouth okay one two three this video is sponsored by a live laugh the best place to buy Korean beauty products in the Philippines

why but I didn't like the layers I felt like it was just eating flour but now I'm kind of used to it it's like eating a lot of pasta with that Wally used for us bread it's really cool I think my patient was there just now kind of important but it has increased a little bit good so for Today's Pizza we've got a Hawaiian overload pizza with pineapples and cheese and capsicum I believe now I'm so thinking are you meant to dip the into this stick into the gravy because it's for the chicken oh you're right don't forget rice sauce right yeah oh I finished mine already you finished your stick I think it's for fried chicken though it's a mushroom oh really mushroom sauce give those Rye if you know it's rice it'll be so nice it's like Julie beef mushrooms it will be rice a little bit too much yeah I'm sure too much coughs okay time to try six people looks delicious yeah so you juice juice I like pepperoni the most all right let's get this bye what do you think I like it well what do you use backpack like food Hawaiian pizza I think it's even better than uh Pizza Hut because Pizza Hut it's first it's expensive if you pay they give you like this size this is beautiful yeah no wonder it's so popular well we didn't know about because for me pizza I should be taste the same everywhere so I was just thinking like what's like you know how different can it be but it's actually a pretty good pizza I think in my opinion the only thing that I could compare with Pizza Hut is the cheesy crust if they're cheesy crust then it'll be perfect I don't know if you just ordered extra cheesy because I'm not too sure I need to find out I can say I like because it's fluffy it's like uh it's like this you have a inside so we have some new pizza I tried before it's so thin you know Gordon Ramsay would say if foreign I think Philippines always has its own version of fast food that is more affordable and quite tasty to you know I don't eat this one because I just have it I don't eat this one this is my favorite particular ly yeah it smells like fried chicken okay give a try I think it's okay just fried chicken yeah it's usually inside from the way around so it's well cooked but it's just fried chicken I know what yeah yeah not bad the thing that I find most intriguing after staying here in the Philippines for six months is that they'll be Filipinos love their friends which ones tastier Marina or this one no debate about sorry I'm trying to deepen the sauce as well the mushroom sauce foreign I know what you mean yeah I like my my food has a mix of different texture and flavor oh run some example will be will be adding your potato chips into ice cream yeah McDonald's you just quite interesting taste rice combinations are there check check no I mean other than fries and like shakes fries and oh yeah keep their fry butterfly flies into the shake it's so our dressing just in chicken monster already eat food chicken yeah it's a monster thank you very much oh roadblock all right thank you thank you very much oh I'm so full yeah it was really feeling I didn't expect that I thought I would come here and I thought we were just like yeah I don't know overall mixed review for me I'm very surprised I'm I can say it's uh better than McDonald's in Philippines I kind of agree let's make a ranking what do you think fast food okay for me I guess I'm I'm not fond of manganaso but I still love it because I think this is for me number one wow pretty much number one okay I don't remember the bad give me five second is a second all right yeah and no no no jolly beetle Jollibee second okay three ISO and that's it get all three only yeah I can give you guys a top buy for me I think okay all right so number one for me it's always gonna be my I'm a big fan of it uh second I think would be I think on my second might be trolling B second will be jolly B third for me will be Greenwich yeah for me yeah ciao King will be number four number five I think yeah but I think yeah my favorite part about grooming today was I was generally surprised by the portion for pesos you could get for two people it's very generous and you can get pizza at such affordable price it's a privilege to be honest yeah lucky let's come here today yeah I think it's time yeah I think it's a really good experience very feeling welcome to your Vlog hello yeah that's the thing when we always go and uh Vlog people always say hello very kind yeah yeah and she was so shy distance all right anyway thanks for watching this episode see you guys next time bye wow\n",

      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: So right in Quiapo is also this small area that is Muslim majority and I think it’s called like Muslim town or something. And when you’re entering the gates of this area you sort of see a Ramadan mubarak sign on top because the month of Ramadan is starting very soon.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: And even when you come into this area, you start to see the differences in people.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: You see a lot of men in prayer attire, you see a lot of women wearing hijabs and all There’s also this market here where they're selling all kinds of meat and fish.\n",
      "Video Id: Vx0TqLbcVpc, Segment: You know what's fascinating about the Philippines is the culture. And it's such a melting pot of different cultures, partially because it was colonized by so many different empires from different parts of the world, but also because it's in the middle of all these other places and has always been a trading hub.\n",
      "Video Id: 2ftG8JuMzz4, Segment: But what is balut anyway?\n",
      "Video Id: 2ftG8JuMzz4, Segment: Balut is best eaten by cracking a portion of its upper shell, just right at the top.\n",
      "Video Id: 2ftG8JuMzz4, Segment: It has a very crunchy texture, although it can be somewhat an acquired taste.\n",
      "Video Id: 2ftG8JuMzz4, Segment: is?\n",
      "Video Id: 2ftG8JuMzz4, Segment: Well, have you heard of Rocky Mountain Oysters?\n",
      "Video Id: 2ftG8JuMzz4, Segment: is a famous exotic hangover dish in the Philippines, and its main ingredient is none other than the bull’s penis and testicles.\n",
      "Video Id: 2ftG8JuMzz4, Segment: , and not any other number?\n",
      "Video Id: 2ftG8JuMzz4, Segment: What are these dishes, no one knows.\n",
      "Video Id: 2ftG8JuMzz4, Segment: As early as BC, records state that Mesopotamians cured their meat with sesame oil and salt; the Ancient Romans dry-cured their meat with salt to preserve it during long travels, where the soldiers of the Roman Republic and Empire can eat it as part of their rations.\n",
      "Video Id: 2ftG8JuMzz4, Segment: Don’t worry though, because before you eat the etag, the molds will be sliced away first, and washed with water to remove the maggots and lessen the saltiness of the meat. Once you get used to the thought of its origins, etag is actually not that bad, tasting like smoked bacon or ham. Coming in number four on our list is the Kamaru, a delicacy that may seem exotic even for local eaters, but once you get a taste of this bad boy, you will find it irresistible.\n",
      "Video Id: 2ftG8JuMzz4, Segment: Kamaru are usually found swimming in the water, or burrowing holes in the farm lands.\n",
      "Video Id: 2ftG8JuMzz4, Segment: That’s a lot of meaty insects for a dollar!\n",
      "Video Id: 2ftG8JuMzz4, Segment: These crickets are washed properly to remove the soil from their bodies, then set aside.\n",
      "Video Id: 2ftG8JuMzz4, Segment: The crickets are then mixed and tossed until they are crispy, but the insides are still soft and moist.\n",
      "Video Id: 2ftG8JuMzz4, Segment: Tamilok, known with its scientific name, Kuphus polythalamius is a type of shipworm, also known by its common name, woodworm.\n",
      "Video Id: 2ftG8JuMzz4, Segment: Although it has the name “worm” attached to its name, woodworm is not an actual worm.\n",
      "Video Id: 2ftG8JuMzz4, Segment: Tamilok is actually a member of the mollusk family, and to describe it as a shell-less saltwater clam is more accurate.\n",
      "Video Id: 2ftG8JuMzz4, Segment: Tamilok are usually found in decaying and rotting logs, or thick tree trunks submerged underwater.\n",

      "Video Id: 7zaMbzqj8AI, Segment: and the building in general was .\n",
      "Video Id: zTcCSyucYqI, Segment: okay guys so now let's start the plating of the bilal and so the chef has already put the chicken wings on the plate and now she's putting the butter so for those of you who don't know what bilal is below is something like a platter which has everything in it am i correct so she's putting butter like generously on it then they're going to put the dressing and for this the dressing was parmesan so and this is the lemon and the pepper so as i've been told earlier that for each below you can choose two flavors so the customer was ordered this one has ordered two flavors that is the garlic sorry so that's the parmesan and the lemon and pepper and that's i think parsley so see i'm myself a chef of half so let's see the next part whether you do the partition in the video in the in the plate in the platter of this so as you can see in this video that they're going to put a lot of things so now i think they're going to put boiled brinjals eggplant so those of the indians who are watching this they're thinking what is this it's a filipino staple do you call it tortang it's a part of the salad so they've put that they're putting the red onions tomato and then the delicacy that's a salted egg so as you can see the salted egg is having the color of the yolk which is being changed into dark yellow or orange as it's being processed for a long period of time it's a delicacy which i am telling you it's a must try if you want to try it alone you can go to bunker one and get it from there now the next part they're going to plate i think lumpia or something they're going to plate lumpia and the lumpia is having the filling of pork so those of you want to try lumpia the original in-house lumpy of wild wings they can try it so this is a medium-sized pillow this is the smallest size so as you can see guys in the smallest size there is so much food so just imagine how much will be there in the biggest size don't worry if you can't imagine i will be putting a picture of that and then you can see the size comparison so everything is being counted twice so now the next part that's the b horn so those who are thinking that what is bihar so bihar is uh filipino vermicelli noodles so that's been cooked with pork and vegetables and now they're going to put that into the platter so how much people how many people can eat this small one so it's good for four to five people and guys now the plate is being covered in foil but if you could i could show you the plate before it was made it is made up of bamboo so it's not harming the environment it's not made up of plastic so you can use it later also for making cmi if you want in the house for those of you don't know come on it's filipino momos with less coating more meat so the smell of the bee horn is making me irresistible to try it and now they're going to put the dressing of bihon that is made up of cabbage carrot chicken and if you want you can put tomas or the anything on that if you want at your house so the last thing which is going on this is the shrimp so guys just to let you know that i will not be tasting the whole bilal so that it's a lot of food i will be trying some part of it in a separate dish in a separate plate so this is the shrimp piece so the shrimpies are being made by uh frying them somehow in the pan firstly by boiling and then by sauteing them in the pan so those of you who love seafood they would love to see this scene right now of shrimpies i think it's made up of garlic yeah it's sorted with garlic yeah so there's something still left guys i don't know what it is they're going to surprise now so still more garlic is going on so those of you who love the dragon breath smell of garlic and along with this they'll be even giving you dipping sauce i think some dipping sauce so that you can dip your things in that only the food nothing else don't take it to the wrong way so now came the lechon so what is this called lechon yeah the lecture on roll and as i've been told earlier that the lechon roll is boneless so we don't have to do the hard work of taking out the bones and how many kilos is this one it's one kilo and i'm sure it's difficult to finish and it looks so nice so now the dipping sauces are coming the vinegar and the monk tomas sauce and now the plating is done so now they will be covering it up and they will be dispatching it thank you guys so stay connected bye bye okay guys so we are the last stage of our video that's the tasting version of the mini platter of bilal so only one thing is missing in this that's a leech on roll and that's a very big thing and i don't want to try that so just to let you know what it will taste like i know that it will be tasting like crunchy country pork it is very delicious if it's three or four people of you you can order one roll from kai from wild wings but it's since it's just me and my cameraman named so i don't want to waste the electron roll so let's try the rest of the things the rest of the things are the bihon the lumpia the shrimp piece the salted egg the salad and the dipping sauce so let's start this video by using the by tasting the lumpia so the lump is made up of pork and i have been told that i can dip it in the sauces so we have the gravy vinegar we have the ketchup and my favorite ranch so i'll be dipping into the ranch obviously the lumpia is having the density of the pore it's not that spicy so if you want to have the spicy one you can check my instagram and then go and order the chili gourmet spice thing thing from wheat so if you want you you can get it from them and even kai at while drinks about they have the dipping sauce of the spicy thing so if you want you can dip it with that so instead of half lump here left i'll be dipping into the gravy and let's see if this any different flavor according to me still lumpia with the ranch is the best so let's proceed to the next part of the video in this plate as you can see it's having bihon so for those of you who are thinking what bihorn is so bihar is the filipino vermicelli noodles and which are being cooked with chicken and vegetables and with some amount of soy sauce so let's try bihon have eaten me on a lot of times before also so this is the same type but the dressing which kai has made for the bihon which is made up of chicken so as you can see in the video also there's still some chicken on this pihan so this chicken is so tender that it just melts in the mouth so if you want to try some more different type of bihan you can ask kai and but i'm so sorry that this platter which we showed you earlier which i'm racing right now it's only for a limited time offer so maybe next christmas season or maybe next new year you can order that so now we have this the salad and then that we have the red onions the tomato and the salted egg so i will be tasting the salted deck for all of you picking one for the team i've tasted solid egg before also i love it it's having a different texture it's having different flavor then the other things which you can taste in the market so you can take it in your hand and eat it directly if you love to eat savory things it is for you i will just flush down everything down it's such a strong flavor of salted egg it's processed for around still where i remember it's processed for around to days so that gives it a different texture and different flavor so we have the last part of this video in which i'll be trying the shrimp piece which have been sauteed with the garlic so as you can see the head is still on and for those of you who don't know how to eat a shrimpy i'll be doing it now for you if you want you can remove the head and then eat it like this but i don't like to eat the shell also of the back tail so i'll be removing that but since it has been cooked in the\n",

      "Video Id: tjDZ9-6PxiQ, Segment: hey what's up Chad here so many of you have probably heard of this incredible place in Manila the Venice Grand Canal mall it's really quite impressive the way they recreated a little piece of Venice Italy and made it the focal point of this high-end mall it's such a cool place to come to dine do some shopping or just walk around and take in the scenery and then of course you have the famous BGC right next door a massive business and lifestyle District it's super impressive with its modern architecture Lush Landscaping all the parks and endless dining and shopping these areas in particular are often called the bubbles within Manila and are quite different than the majority of Manila so I've been staying in a neighborhood called Tembo in Makati City directly across the highway from BGC and I want to take you on a little walk and talk to check it out and just see what it's like outside the BGC bubble hey what's up guys all right this that is BGC over there I'm walking against the grain here on the wrong side of the road that I want to show you all right so this highway right here divides BGC and Pembo Makati neighborhood that I'm staying in so all the amazingness of BGC is literally it starts right there we got SM aura mall right there and then you cross the road and it's a little different over here very different in terms of like the modern high-end fancy money money but this is more typical around the Philippines I like it I'm staying in here you can walk out you got wet and dry markets and yeah there's a lot more people it's not modern fancy but um you know what like I didn't come to the Philippines for that people are super nice here there's lots of good food options you come out and you grab produce or you grab some fish go home cook it up I like that I really like that that's what I got used to so far in the last few months and uh kind of like being here and I can just pop over the highway and see whenever I want to but it's yeah you know a little more hustle a little more bustle people are coming back from work it's about p.m right now so the crowds are starting to pick up pretty much busy all the day throughout the day but it definitely gets super busy around this time so we got lots of different stuff dried fish lots of lots of fish options produce different vibe over here this is outside the bubble get your rice we got little Salon shops man you literally are right on the edge of where cars and motorbikes are coming through you got to watch your heels for sure all right this guy here Cooks milk fish right here on the barbecue we've eaten this many times so good we ate it the other day thank you I've eaten yeah this this place is pretty good too these guys are super nice what they got today they often have like Pompano and do they have here oh they do have some Pompano there tons of milk fish I got some tilapia primarily eating milk fish for the last while we're gonna go on a little Walkabout guys another walk and talk kick you all the way through Pembo Makati we're gonna go through a few this is it you got to just navigate through uh people in traffic and tribes trikes bikes if you're like a vlogger whoa that was close that was so close to my heel it's like a network of Alleyways we usually walk up and down these back into where we're staying men people are just flying we got ladders we got everything everyone comes through here we got little laundry shops down here everything you need everything you need Pembo Makati all right we even have little uh it's kind of like back home you know we have the car wash stations that are like that and it's just like a little tiny one for one like motorcycle at a time a little bit little neighborhoods like this have all of that

coffee shop coffee Booth I should say everything's tiny everything's Boutique I'd say pretty friendly everything's pretty friendly here all right so we got well we gotta love that pretty typical in the Philippines some barbecued uh meat you name it chicken pork intestines um what else chicken head I've never seen the chicken head was that there yeah yeah I've seen chicken feet absolutely I haven't seen the Chicken Heads barbecue chicken heads I'll be honest I'm not super adventurous when it comes to that that dog is real adventurous he'll eat a chicken head you chicken head right now deep fried food oh balut we got little duck eggs or something roasted nuts more milk fish on the grill guys you're getting a taste of everything here in Pembo Makati other world when you leave the bubble the BGC bubble baby but I don't know coming from the West like I like this I don't know like that's just how I feel being a little reggae music pipes and Pembo Makati alleyways streets everywhere there's something going on there's something for sale we got a coconut coconut cart over there hey dude what's up guys I would say most people pineapple oh that looks good we got clothing shop man I personally I think this is cool I like this stuff and if you notice there's not like there's no tourists there's really like no foreigners hanging around hey buddy how are you have a nice

for that what's up guys that's a big chicken right there dude I love it here all right folks that's kind of like a good chunk of Pembo Makati as far as markets people just going about their day you know getting the getting their food for dinner that's what I love about these little village like Villages little neighborhoods is that you just get what you need for like that day that that particular meal maybe the next morning and then the next day you do it again on the way home from work Rose is shopping for something here what do we checking here a nail file oh shoot yeah girl problems eh guys walk and talk I'm gonna do a bunch of these where I wherever I go in the Philippines try to make it feel as raw and natural as can be as if you're just kind of cruising the streets here whether it be to just see what it's like in another City or island or part of the world or if it's something you want to see to determine if it's where you want to go like if you come to BGC could you come and stay in a place like this you know the place that we're staying at is right off of this Main Street you literally just walk out the door and you're kind of in the middle of this I love it but it might not be everyone's thing so videos like this can kind of give you a feel for what your options are and just experience something unique definitely all of this is just great experience for me for sure love the reggae music all right we just got our laundry and we just went off the main street here where I was just walking and this is where the apartment is kind of in the back in an Alleyway it's a sort of a compound multiple it's a few apartments she airbnbs a couple out and the family lives here too and they got some they got the guard dogs right here hey buddy toffee hey buddy oh it's the friendliest dog ever anybody this guy welcomes us every time we come home eh that's where we're staying for bucks you can actually see the high rises back there that's an EGC literally minutes and you're in the BGC bubble loving that part of the Metro Manila which is obviously phenomenal so we did not plan for this so it's a mess Rose is frantically trying to tidy up actually you know what I have footage that I took the other day I'm going to cut to that and that'll show you the apartment when it's more clean all right this is what you get in a little neighborhood across the highway from b g c so you get a little mini fridge a little eating area everything you need for cooking nothing fancy you got the one burner you got the microwave makes some pretty decent meals though you got all your pots and pans you got your rice maker you got your sink pretty decent bathroom you get a separate bedroom in here it's pretty cute you know I don't even use that word cute but it's cute a little paint on the brick behind the bed you got a TV cable internet closet I mean guys for a budget apartment actually you know what before we wrap this up let's go get some dinner milk fish and veggies this is kind of where we started came down from up there BGC and uh yeah let's cross this Mayhem and get ourselves a couple of uh fish okay we got protein delicious milk

      "Video Id: FkBRtBZhNyc, Segment: yeah let's say he's got I don't want to review the exacts yeah it's really crazy yeah he's uh that's why when he says like oh we're Three Brothers we were actually agrees yeah this kind of reminds me of uh the local areas oh like the islands that I went to Thailand it's very natural with fresh air everywhere that's what I like finally away from whatever the smoke yeah not complaining but Manila it's uh can be quite polluted sometimes yeah but anyway let's uh go and find a restaurant here and uh from why my father said oh this is a petty petty diving flag diving yeah Petty diving flag no idea Petty diving you know you know when you get a certificate for diving you come to like one of these places to get the center yeah be fine okay in the next few days we may be yeah I think so together I won't be scared yeah all right let's find food I don't know if this side let's look on Google Map to see what food options are there I don't know why but Alina's phone actually has better signal than mine even though we're using the same plan yeah everywhere like this not fair yeah yeah okay anyway where are the restaurant options they say there is like Thai restaurant Korean barbecue everywhere ask your father which way he going oh yeah let me ask him let's go back yeah for this trip I intentionally brought my uh water slippers away from our normal Center they said this is which one oh is it this is great yeah let's see more I think many people like so famous I don't see a tourist where is the tourists it's good that we are not in a tourist area for me I don't like going to tourist area I like going to the beach and open path and uh yeah I like going to local places I know I mean this is a hotel straight I think anyway we're in the main town so yeah it looks so modern and simple and it's cheap yeah it's at a good price I would say I wouldn't say it's cheaper it's a good price all right so we begin on a hunt to find some food here in the Philippines in Corona I mean and if we go up the hill apparently we are just a couple minutes away from the main street in coron town so I believe this is it and I'm going to my father they've got different things to eat but now it's around four o'clock so ideally we don't want to eat a lot so we're just gonna eat something small my favorite restaurant and dogs chicken yes fine you're fine you're okay don't worry okay it's more a bit more developed than uh just now I think they say has more things I think go it's around small street oh cover your ears guys this is uh whoa It's smoke Construction there are lots of um tricycle is around too but a tricycles looks a bit different this looks like one of those are Armored Cars you know what I mean I'm a cast that goes to bang and take money it's also one of those but modified from open the back inside oh actually do we have money to buy food yeah we do we still have yeah so you have some a couple hundred pesos yeah we forgot it's okay to be alone see many tricycles but they look so different all of them oh wow bigger bigger the tricycle is a custom yeah custom they try to make it something special yeah I think they can choose their own colors you know like when you it's like when you're in a game when you're in a computer game and you can choose choose your character and choose your like different colors yeah the chocolate colors here look very different and see there is this one smaller I think hello hello all right what else is there I think this is going to get a quick bite so maybe like a cafe if you want coffee yeah there's a cafe here we can get some Bakery if you want oh let's walk around yeah walk around and see yeah so this is the main coron town and you can see lots of tour companies over here as well motored by Grand so I wonder how much it is for one bike uh it doesn't say a price four hours hours hours so it's got hours it's not going today interesting something that uh usually in other countries according to days and even in other places yeah but I don't I don't I don't think we'll be traveling around with waterfire to be honest I won I know you won but uh yeah but I think because we're there four of us and my brother they don't drive other bikes so very likely they'll take tricycle go find a drive drive right your father can drive no can I yeah it's not very common to drive a motorbike in Hong Kong Australia yeah super it's a very scared of music I'm telling you copyright copyright all right so after walking around the streets for another like or some minutes we just haven't found any lots of a good Cafe options or restaurants around here I think even though it's a rather tourist town here there's not enough um like I guess like restaurants or facilities around here even though we've got like chicken manok um but uh not now not now we were thinking to get something like very small like a snack kind of thing um I guess like there are restaurants here but there's not enough variety but uh there is McDonald's yeah um I wanna even I wanna eat Jollibee hot dog yeah if they have one yeah they say having a McDonald in your area usually it means it's a symbol for like your area it's very developed last time when we're on our way to uh Pico de oroco our friend uh told us that last time yeah I've got McDonald's that means this is a very developed town yeah let's see what they have actually we have never had McDonald's in the Philippines so this might be our first reaction of McDonald's as well yeah all right anyway let's head right in and see what's uh in Philippines McDonald's oh through dry fruit throw Helena cannot pronounce it Justin cannot cannot pronounce dressed with you no one can no one can Russia there is true today all right let's Head Right In McDonald's yeah so many people inside yeah I think I'll be down for a burger or something yeah all right ladies first okay oh so many people in there oh it's a nice aircon okay outside or super all right let's uh hello hello all right um let's see what's on the menu so whoa we're here in McDonald's in Philippines they always have a rise actually they always have a horizon very possible meal so uh it's like Jolly spaghetti but like uh chick fried chicken with spaghetti with tomato sauce and they've got the same thing as for mushroom pepper steak one thing is different though is the um the top the chicken fillet with uh looks like corn corn sauce I don't know what that is but it's like a sauce and sauce but of course we're gonna end it with the McFlurry later so I'm not sure if you get the stomach for it I think I think I will eat apple pie yeah they they want to go to dinner and later I think we're gonna try to like I'm gonna spend some family time with them later so maybe we'll drink like a cup of beer and we're gonna try the first impression of San Miguel or something so I think it's gonna be quite interesting beer yeah only in the Philippines I think I think in I'm gonna have to but uh anyway yeah let's try to order food I don't think I put apple pie will be a lot different here so um all right all right yeah I actually only ordered the Apple five I think apple pie in general should be somewhat similar to other country so there won't be a lot of deviations not oily so it means um it's freshly fried so it's nice not to um no what's that word when um the chips get very soggy soggy that's a word and right here we've got a cheeseburger so um let's um see first impression our cheeseburger Yep looks very expanded meat plants inside and there's ketchup but please go to Russia fine it's your everyday sitting in toilet I Don't Wanna Be recover y yeah this is Sprite it's more like a water than Sprite I don't feel like a gas the bubbles inside I agree it's very diluted it's not a lot of soda inside chips fries were good I think it's like very freshly fried you can taste it it's not soggy at all right now on to the main start of our today's dish you can see inside there is some chopped onions some pickle tomato sauce so yeah it looks like a very standard cheeseburger I guess exactly the same no surprise yeah no surprises they're all onion not bad all right so after McDonald's just then I think to be honest the impression of McDonald it's more or less the same as other countries apart from the fried chicken and rice and those other fishes as well it's quite interesting and full disclaimer I would have tried a fried chicken but I didn't uh just because of my stomach issue I don't want to risk it anyway after McDonald's we came back to the hotel which is just going to take some rest because we're so tired and later the rest and charging our phone and later we're gonna go to somewhere maybe interesting place yeah maybe we'll go and grab dinner later okay let's go private boat tour USA tomorrow Private Island yep oh how many you said I saw in your message he said six islands six islands six islands and there are more places to go tomorrow how much uh um for the whole group just for the boat yeah and then um there's every island there is actually a tax or something that we have to pay like yeah usually there is one yeah so that's um so that works out quite well I mean if you go around six islands then we have to pay something per person something for the whole group yeah maybe that's my person yeah that's a per person so the is for the boats right yep for the whole boat and then on top then we have we have to rent out the alcaya oh okay so we will tow for Kaya to uh by the vote to the destination and then go around and then we can actually jump on the kayak and kind of like that's nice yeah yeah okay tomorrow yeah let's do it so what happened is that it's actually we start at seven o'clock um the guy the tour guide will actually come and pick us up and we go to market to buy something so that he can cook on the boat for us oh all right he cooks yes wow and uh no actually there's a there's a there's a chef owner in the boat and they you cook for us wow and he will and then the tour guide will take us to the island okay around yeah so then we finish the day around P.M back in hotel that sounds cool to you yeah sounds good sounds good to you guys yeah that's good then I actually attacked him now yeah let's do it that uh pick us up at seven o'clock in the hotel uh on his van and take us to the market and go shopping yeah sounds good it's gonna be a fun day tomorrow yeah it sounds like it so it's gonna be a full-on full fully packed uh boat trip tomorrow so uh we're gonna be like so burnt the whole day Under the Sun yeah it's gonna be complete Sunburn and these two they're actually doing another boat till after Quran from Coronado it's got called a top Expedition I'm sure you guys have heard about it before but I think they're gonna do it themselves and we'll meet them back in El Nido after a while so it's gonna be a lot of road trip boat trip for the two of them yeah I hope I don't get any seasick and hopefully it's not too choppy all right see you guys at dinner all right see you later all right so now it's around sunset time so it's time to uh grab dinner so apparently just then on this side there is a uh there's a coron town the main town with lots of food options we missed that just then we didn't see it but apparently there is a huge variety of options like Korean barbecue and even so maybe we can get that later yeah but anyway this is my father I'm hungry yeah it's okay didn't you just eat a lot I thought you ate like a three portions of seafood just now yeah yeah tell you the cheaper platter that we had was full of miniature craft and miniature together oh so it's also it's mini size yeah uh crap even the crap because I didn't get much of the crap at all right what's this size only oh no okay yeah right how much did you pay for the craft uh was it worth it how much did we pay eight for your pesos the car was one of a doggy oh excuse me yeah yeah I think the park is about pesos pesos yeah obviously we did not paying enough to get the diesel yeah I think it's rather tourist areas here so from what we observed just and everything was quite quite a lot yeah compared to other places yeah I think for motorbikes usually it's uh for a whole day it should be around pesos when we're in Cebu we saw that price but here it's pesos for one hour one to four hour okay yeah so and then the whole day is around like wow that's so good yeah wow so good price you can pay more than pesos about pesos so good it's a good price anyway this is my brother Jason yeah he flew all the way in from Melbourne and uh he uh took a red eye flight is that mean it's a last night he didn't sleep much so he's definitely three hours I think he was in Singapore last night ah do you go to Hawker Center uh what do you guys think do we look alike and uh what do you think of his accent is it a very Australian I don't know you tell me I think so I think the the real test is when you talk to Alina if she understands it means it's Australian blue all the way in from Melbourne and my father flew from Hong Kong so my family is all around you're well respect it looks exactly the same like a brother yeah my father looks really young to finding my neck just have a good metabolism family so skinny okay everyone so young yeah my father looks so uh so so young welcome to Asia how's your impression of Quran so far your first time seeing tricycles during my previous trip oh yeah and I think this trip will actually get to try try to try to ride on them yeah that could be cool because the last time we went here was actually in Cebu it's our our whole family second time right together in the Philippines welcome to the family yeah the new member new baby yeah yeah we walked down I think we walk up to here just then and we just gave up yeah are you so look at me this will be years of him later years years yeah yeah I think in the comments people will say you're very young maybe you look like Max like h Max Steel maybe feet away he's actually guys we are Brothers Three Brothers yeah it looks like it and a little sister yeah I think uh in in the Philippines the one thing you can try later maybe it's coconut they call it Buco here which means young coconut okay buco yeah yeah it's like a smoke opener but they said mostly and drinking here so hectic as uh as a night just now huh no we actually didn't come that far I think there's a lot of tourist stuff oh oh wait no we did oh look at that speaker yeah we're going so fast wait copyright copyright I'll walk like this the film is so fast yeah I think that's a impression of most foreigners when I first came to the Philippines it's the fact that they need to cover the nose because you guys may not know what to say in the Philippines and um because they're just lots of Vehicles like tricycles and motorbikes and everywhere we feel here so fresh that's true yeah after living in Manila this cannot be compared yeah we just got some fruits here we got like two oranges and two mangoes did you try for okay so oh two orange two mangoes that's good yeah I think it's okay yeah it's okay yeah oh so I was dying for some advisements here how was uh how was the fruits here uh more or less the same well we've only had one meal hmm what's up it was good yeah I know a bit small yeah I don't know if Corona Oneida is famous for seafood but if we had a chance I think tomorrow we're gonna go on a boat trip we got a decision to make so are we doing Korea tonight or are we doing Spanish I think let's do Spanish maybe okay yeah change my mind let's do Spanish today just because my stomach has been having some issue with meat Spanish rice will be nice oh yeah we walked past this just now but we uh walked away goodbye I think there is not a lot of Spanish options inside for what we saw this then yeah yeah I had a look on Google yeah it doesn't look very Spanish it doesn't look very Spanish thank you now you understand when I first came to Philippines why focused so much yeah Chicken manok on the side of the road hello hello oh yeah that's pork belly yeah it's called liambo I think so we see liamfo olympo yeah and this is chicken okay manuk and you see them grilling this is my memory in Cebu uh yeah the only thing I remember it's like a chicken rolling on the South Street and my mouth is watering already yeah so good it's okay plenty of chances we can eat this later I think we can just one night buy chicken and then come back and eat nightmare I think it'll be good idea come back here why is this woman holding a spoon because I want to teach you Asian Asian weapon and and uh Asian weapon yeah I see you guys three three of you guys reactions like put chicken like like this like this like a dog in the street yeah exactly now you know it runs in the family we love chicken yeah wow I feel like I haven't uh I was thinking we might go out there wait okay oh up there Rooftop Bar maybe yeah later for after dinner maybe it's nice yeah nice I think if you're up there you overseas the whole Harbor I heard you bought a bottle of wine I did yeah really yeah in the duty-free section I don't think it ended up being cheaper right like say a dance but what kind of wine is it super Nash wine I have no idea what it is I need to try it I was gonna pretend I know something but I like though yeah yeah that one yeah oh yeah you're right there's a lot of more options here there's creep in town uh Thai food oh I missed Thai food really we will see I need more questions yeah we didn't continue to understand we uh gave up very quickly but yeah it's got a huge variety of options yeah and I can see there's a lot more tourists around yeah I see this is the main town and why did they eat McDonald's yeah McDonald's no I'm not hungry I believe these thoughts has a name but I don't remember what kind of it but basically these stores they sell things in smaller portions we're looking at our mangoes come back that's uh every time we go to another country I always look for uh fruits hello hello I don't know if they they say kamusta here because different language yeah I need to ask later at a restaurant I'm doing a tour there's like a street fan doors like the skewers usually when it comes to viewers here in the Philippines it's usually intestine like chicken art intestines not a fan the real streets oh this is not the real Street this is not the real street oh wow crazy there is a street called the real Street all right are we Crossing further maybe one tip if you cross in the Philippines you need to put your hand out he went away you know me ah this is it I think ah yeah there you go oh there's a rooftop pass too looks nice and my camera perspective all right so this is where we're gonna have dinner tonight so we have dinner Spanish food Korean Spirits they just come but already know everywhere okay so funny we're drinking sangria Spanish wine drink and then we close in Russian yeah they're so tasty fruit wine foreign Spanish place so we had a really good dinner just then and I had some tough houses of cocktails just stand and we came across the other Sample Road and there's a Italian pizza here and it's the authentic open roast you can see the flame behind there as well Italian pizza have you had Original Italian Pizza before yeah oh I remember we went together actually yeah I think here I'm just saying we really missed out this part of Corona we didn't see there is a I think there's more like a tourist town there lots of foreigners around here as well and they also have different kinds of cuisines but I think we're still a little bit hungry I've got space because I mean these these guys they have like uh hungry family so we still need to order my favorite which is chicken manok inasau so we're gonna go and grab one of the chicken on the side of the road and uh maybe share between us and we've got some wine today so we're gonna have some oh hello hello kamusta is it kamusta hello hello I don't know if they speak uh anyway because I think it's different language I don't know if there's I think we'll go by walk maybe get chicken on our way back you really got to be careful in the Philippines crossing the road all right so now we've got we're going to the chicken place so um yeah hopefully we can get some nice chicken we saw two stores to send on the South Road I don't know what what stuff inside usually for chicken I'm chicken expert here usually there's spring onion inside or it could be just not stuffed or just like on it on the outside there is a honey glaze so I know some some minaso sauce and something like my natto sauce give me free agreements yeah a lot of Spanish Italian Spanish food oh my God to be honest yeah but anyway yes gotta feed the family okay all right see you guys then all right so there is a chicken store here so uh let's try to order a chicken oh this looks good hello uh it's Issa is chopped yeah

      "Video Id: 1kErCqgIVMk, Segment: okay so some of you have asked for a house tour of uh our house here in the philippines try to get some a little bit better light there we go um yeah so i'm gonna just give you a quick tour nothing too in-depth but uh here we go okay try to reduce it down here okay there's the the top up on top we have the this whole middle section is just a stair column you'll see that then we've got a full upstairs patio area then the second floor second floor is where we live and we've got a little balcony there and then the bottom floor is where my brother-in-law's and their families live so we'll get started all right down there's a couple of little houses so all right let's get started little gate got our initials on it there's the door to one brother-in-law's apartment or and the other one so they'll open the door and go up the steps you got these little lights that come on those are nice at night and then we thought it'd be nice to put in this glass block kind of so it's not so dark just like a concrete wall when you come up the steps you also got this see i'm just opposite the steps here you get glass block all along here and then you turn and you walk this way and you can look out we got screens on all the windows and there's the upstairs so we'll go up there in a minute i'm going to show you our living quarters where we live this is our living room tv area we've got an air conditioner in case it gets too hot in here in the evening sometimes we'll turn it on not too often and then we've got screens on all the doors in our little balcony we can look out both ways we can look down if we see something going on my wife's beloved wind chimes trying to shut the glass door okay and we've got a little dinette we bought here this last animal glass glass dinette and we've got a cat otherwise known as ming ming in our kitchen um we actually have granite countertops and uh cabinetry everywhere it is unfinished at this point we are going to finish it hopefully before we leave we got a really nice stove i'm not sure where she got that where do you know where she got it sm maybe i don't remember the brand seems like it's some sort of japanese fuji denzo okay bought me a coffee pot the other day because i couldn't deal with the the nescafe brands anymore or copycar or any of those brands so you can kind of see what the uh the glass block looks like from the inside in our living quarters on the second floor so come around through here we've actually got two doors that open up to the stairs so it's kind of an open air we wanted to keep it keep it all open and we've got a good utility closet again we're kind of in the process of doing some fish finishing so we've got plenty of storage area here and then in here we call this we call this nani's room and well can't really see there we go it's a picture of my mother-in-law she's actually passed away about three or four years ago and this was to be her room she never got to see it so house was kind of built in memory of her dedicated to her you can see this area here let me show you some like this door see how pretty that is that's what all this dry wood is going to look like that's our plan is to get all this throughout the house finished like this we picked up a varnish stain combination at ace hardware it's called it just says like i think it's it's the lightest color chestnut or something like that with a matte finish i don't like the slick finishes i like the matte finish and yeah so we've got tons of storage here a little desk built in shelves i hope no dead bodies or anything fall out here i don't know what's in here yeah we've got tons of storage more storage than we want or need and these couple little uh built-in side tables those are nice somebody really did a great job all of this stuff is is handmade the guy came over to the house we told him what we wanted and he built it so that's all handmade this bed is uh made out of steel steel tubing welded cut welded put together by hand it's got a nice mattress in there i personally picked out all the tile which i like it i'm glad i got it then we have the small bathroom it's a typical filipino bathroom but we do have heated water if we need it draining the floor tile all the way up the walls small sink and toilet and we don't have a cabinet put in yet but we do have the wiring put in so all right and this is just an area kind of designated it for my office at some point just to pay bills to work on editing videos things like that cat he's getting around all right so walk into our bedroom and this is our master bath i i really liked that i couldn't that's one thing i couldn't wait to see was our master bath because they did a fine job on it they did an excellent job the toilet is a upgraded just a nice design the cabinets are really designed nice we even have the little switch there that turns on above there like a makeup light of some sort got a really good looking guy there he's doing all the videos for us and then the shower you know it's it's it's pretty standard got the water heater place to put everything i like things neat and orderly and then again this this door this is what all of our our woods are gonna look like in here and i just think that's beautiful really just a minimalist finish on it not too shiny and then we have these handmade little end tables side tables bedside tables and we're going to finish those out i think i'm going to start on that today again this uh this bed is all steel steel frame handmade designed hand cut now see the steel steel legs and it's no box springs but tell you what these mattresses that we've got we're from you guys probably know mf uh some kind of foam company makes these mattresses i'm telling you what for a couple hundred dollars they are some of the best mattresses i've ever slept on in my life so i'll turn off the light there i have lights everywhere all right so we've been to the kitchen already there's some of my wife's photography stuff that she's done she's really good at decorating it's one of her paintings actually she does what's called acrylic pour all right let's go upstairs really hot today got a fire extinguisher that's a must sorry i'm trying to put my glasses back on here all right so we've got lighting all the way up through here and these these stairs are all handmade hand cut and just designed by the metal worker that did it these windows were all put together piece by piece the guy did all of our windows all the same ones so we've got a screen we've got nice tinted glass throughout the whole thing a storm door here for rain and then up here it's going to get a little warm if you're out in the sun the filipino sun is it's very unforgiving but you get about out here at night i think i'll try to do a video to o'clock until dark it's really beautiful out here the sun sets way back there in the east goes down behind those trees it's just kind of breezy up here you stand out here on the edge and it's just like standing on the titanic or something it's just the wind blows maybe a little upstairs uh cr up here so typical filipino bathroom all right and then in back we've got a built-in sink which we need to get our tile put in but you know it's it's functional um i had them build me a grill last time i was here i didn't have a grill so we got a again a filipino-style grill you'll see these like built like this on the street they'll sell east out esau which is like intestines on a stick who doesn't love intestines on a stick come on and then if we ever wanted to collect water rain water we've got it set up to where we can just put a tank here or something like that and collect water we've got a lot of plants back here my wife's growing several different types of of uh food plants vegetable plants and then she's got alekbati growing there alekbati over there syrup with uh mungo of course shimpuri and then all of our little starters so yeah and then somebody asked about the baha'i kubo there it is that was built up here it's it's funny how much does it cost to get a baha'i kubo built you might ask and uh not much because when we built the house we saved all the bamboo scaffolding and we paid a guy labor took him a few days probably five six hundred pesos a day and he built this for us first we paid him we got steps right here got a nice floor benches on the side we hang close sometimes outside so we've got that and we've got some hangers here but most of the time you can sit in here if there's any breeze at all you just sit down and just kind of relax and catch any breeze that's out there so yeah got to buy behind kubo we got a grill we got the upstairs patio which in the evenings we spend a lot of time up here until the mosquitoes say it's time for us to go in then we go in i've really been fortunate on mosquito bites this time i bet i haven't been been bitten six or seven times maybe and then our our water tower we've got a pump downstairs good water pump and pressure tank so we pump the water up here to the top i thought i'd throw in a little bit of grilling action actual uh footage of the fiesta just a little bit see how the upstairs operates and kind of how it works what it's like up here when we're grilling hello um so that's it that's a tour of our house um again i didn't really want to go into the the uh two brothers houses downstairs they're nice neat and ordinary they're i mean orderly ordinary they're orderly uh they keep a really nice house it's not furnished like ours is uh as far as the the tile and the decorations and stuff they do their own thing and that's fine but uh yeah i enjoy enjoy being here why wouldn't i this is a dream this is was a dream you know the channel is called the philippines project and i almost have to close my eyes out here the channel is called the philippines project and this was definitely one of the projects so we get out of the sun so yeah this was built over about a year a year and a half probably at the most and then that's that's the the this top floor uh you know was put on ever all the concrete was done the plumbing electric everything was done we came back in we put down all this all this tile well we did we had somebody do it but we were here during all the tile installation pretty much all of it and you know so we went back uh in we hadn't been we didn't come back to march of march th we got in manila and so we've been here ever since and i'm going to go back to the united states at some point probably in june but i'm not trying to get in any hurry i'll tell you i'm enjoying my time here enjoying the philippines and right now we got some work going on downstairs in our on our floor we've got a a little bit of a water leak we got to chase down and it's different than america uh you got a water leak in america it starts tearing up a lot of stuff well here you gotta tear out concrete you know so that's kind of what we're dealing with but it's a slow leak we don't have to shut off our water or anything like that but both of my brothers-in-law they work construction full-time so you know it's pretty handy to have them around we pay them a little bit and they come up and they do whatever we need and you know we work together as a family you know so anyway that's my house tour if you have any questions about the construction or just have a comment please go down in the comment section and and drop down your comment just type it out and i'll get it and i like to respond if you've ever commented anything on this channel you know i'll comment back so uh also i'm celebrating today i was gonna celebrate yesterday we had subscribers so pretty pumped about that actually uh and um my goal is to get a thousand subscribers and i got up this morning we've got so that's even better and uh a lot of people are commenting a lot of people are going back and forth some other channels uh yeah that's just

      "Video Id: 8DYPxsr7kDI, Segment: I know that seems simple but it happens all the time and it drives foreigners and nuts because you cannot be at the Starbucks at p.m. if you're leaving your house half an hour away at p.m. it's impossible it's impossible you're not gonna get there in seconds if it takes minutes which again this is why you leave early now I know a lot of excuses come up and the text will be well I'm late I'm the the traffic and I couldn't get a jeepney and I was waiting on my babysitter and I just got out of the shower and my brother you know went to the sari-sari store how that connects with anything nobody knows but here's the thing is we foreigners know that every single day filipinas wake up every single day millions of them and they they get on a jeepney for minutes and they show up at work and they clock in on time every day six days a week if they got to start their shift at : a.m. or : a.m. they already know they got to leave early they already know they got to account for the jeepney they already know how long it takes to get from the street to their time clock so that they can clock in on time so we know you can do it which is why when we wait for up to two hours because we're being told I'm almost there I'm almost there and really you haven't even left the house yet or decided to stop by your sister's house to borrow some shoes at : when you should have been at the Starbucks at o'clock so I will tell you I'm telling you this because I want your date to go good so my recommendation to you filipinas is please show up on time treat it as if it was your starting shift for your job it's that important because we know you can do it we know you can plan and arrive the place on time because you do it for work all the time or you do it for school so when when you leave us waiting for half an hour an hour hour and a half two hours it tells us we're not that important to you we're not important enough that you would plan ahead and be there on time that's what it tells us so if what we're sitting there waiting alone thinking you know if she really wanted to be here on time she would have left earlier I guess she's really not that interested so as I mentioned a common courtesy is to wait minutes and if there's a text we'll wait another minutes after minutes even with excuses the person waiting has the right to just reschedule or cancel the meeting the date so do not expect a foreigner to wait more than minutes it won't matter how many excuses you got you could have been there on time and so after minutes if if you're not there expect that a foreigner may very well get up out of this chair pay for his coffee and leave and what he does after that he may give you another chance on another day you know he might reschedule and say you know I had plans now we're gonna miss the movie that I had planned or we're gonna miss this or that so we're gonna have to reschedule now if you're lucky he will reschedule on another day if you're not so lucky he's gonna say you know what she's just not taking this serious so he's gonna get out his phone and he's gonna go through his contacts or he's gonna go on one of the dating apps and or he's gonna just walk into the mall he's gonna find someone else to go out with who can be there on time so if you want a good dating experience with your foreigner boyfriend show up on time if you show up half an hour late minutes late an hour late don't expect him to be there don't expect them to be there I mean some men are very patient maybe even too patient and if you're lucky he's one of those guys but really he's already been insulted you've already been rude to him you already had him sitting there waiting for an hour because you didn't think it was important enough to leave on time okay so that's it that's it if you really want your date to go good plan on being there five minutes before if he says o'clock plan on being there five minutes to seven and you'll impress him okay now that's all I really have to share with you filipinas if you want you can end the video right now I'm going to talk to the expats now and we're just gonna kind of like go over this ourselves now if you've been dating in the Philippines for any period of time again I've been dating on and off here for the last six years and when I dated in the United States it was it would happen its life sometimes you do get caught in traffic and the thing is though pretty consistently if a date was going to delay more than - minutes I usually got a text and they would text I'm at such-and-such intersection they would let me know where they were so that I could calculate okay well you know traffic there at this intersection you know there's communication and and it's usually honest communication I'll give you an example I was now meanwhile in the Philippines give an example I was in CDO and I hadn't even planned on going out on a date that night but a Filipina contacted me on Facebook and said hey I heard you're in CDO I want to meet you at the mall and you know big fan of your videos all that I said okay so I got dressed and I said okay let's go meet at the mall at : and we can get some dinner and get to know each other so I arrived at : I got there a little bit early even though I had never been decidió I I got on the taxi early and and I got there at : at the mall and then I had to I'd only been there once before so I had to find my way to where we were gonna meet at the food court and by : I was there waiting at the food court and I waited until : we were supposed to meet at : and by : no texts nothing saying that she's late nothing and then around : I got a text and are you there well of course I'm there it's : or it's : and we were gonna meet at : so yes I am here and and then it became this tumbling random text I'm almost there I'm just about there I'm in the jeepney now this went on until : : now this went on until : it had already been almost two hours an hour and minutes and she finally at : said after already telling me she got out of the shower after telling me she's already on her way now at : she says oh my sister showed up so now she's gonna watch my baby and now can leave the house and I said well where are you how far are you from the mall and she goes oh it's not far it's only minutes now she's already an hour minutes late she already told me she's on her way and now she's telling me she's about to leave the house at : when she was supposed to be there at : and she's not gonna get there till quarter to : which is minutes before the mall closes so I told her no I'm leaving I mean I really shouldn't have waited beyond half an hour but again I believed the text she was sending me and that's the message that I'm gonna share with you expats I've made this mistake believing what they tell me now I have a whole new approach to it and this is what I want to recommend to all expats I think we need to communicate to all Filipinos through our actions that we're gonna have from now on a standard rule a standard rule which is if if there's no text to explain why they're late minutes after the date no text at all we're free to walk away if there is a text within the first minutes of them being late and they're saying they're on their way we'll give them another minutes because that minutes plus the next minutes makes minutes now if after minutes they're still telling us well I'm on my way I'm almost there when they should have been there a half hour ago we need to let them know it will be our decision whether we will exercise or exercise our right or not - now walk out because they're more than minutes late so if they say I'm almost there and and I'm like don't leave because I'm almost there we have the option to either leave at the minute mark or if they're telling the truth if they're telling the truth that they really are almost there give them one last minutes shot that's a total of minutes we don't have to give them that but if we're being really generous to the patient that day we go okay and if she's still not there after explicitly saying that she's almost there in the next minutes which is now minutes late we got to just walk we got to just leave even if they do show up at minutes we need to just go because it's just insane there has to be consequences this is why they show up on time at their job every day because there would be consequences they would be fired if they showed up at work every day an hour or two hours late they would get fired and and if this girl is trying to make a good impression on us and she can't even respect our time to show up within minutes of the agreed time she's understand we're rescheduling tonight's date is done in fact at minutes we really have the option to just walk the extra minutes is like the last bit of grace she's gonna get but really at minutes if she tells us after being minutes late that she's almost there and she's still not there minutes late we really got to start walking we just got to go and either reschedule that if we really want to go out with her reschedule it reschedule it to the next day the next weekend whatever there needs to be a consequence to making us wait it's just really extremely rude and and we also have the option of just going you know I I want to be with a girl who wants to be with me wants to be with me enough that she'll show up on time not leave me lollygagging around for two hours while she's picking out a pair of shoes at her sister's house before she even gets on the jeepney know we need to start down line minutes wait a little longer if there's a text within that first minutes if they're still not there in minutes and now it's the st minute we really got to just walk just walk and and if you're really that disgusted find someone else to date you know you're probably already at the mall just go and chat up to girl and ask her what time she gets off work and then take her out you know or get on get on one of the the dating apps and and say hey what are you doing at o'clock I'm already at the mall you know my date didn't show up you want to meet and then take them to the movies you know take them to a nice dinner because the other girl again you know if she's gonna show up late and unannounced bring along some friend that she never mentioned and and just show up with this other friend and say oh I hope it's okay well no that's not gonna fly either we need to just say you know I had a date scheduled with you you showed up half an hour late with a friend we're gonna talk about this over text but tonight's date is not gonna happen sorry and then just walk away and and you know again if she's gonna say well I got all the way over here yeah you got over here half an hour late with an extra friend so we really got to start laying down the law and again it'll start communicating through action that no the days of us waiting around an hour or two hours for them to show up and totally change the schedule totally change the plan totally everything that's got to end so minutes if they contact us we'll give them another minutes if they're still not there after minutes we have the free and clear option to just walk reschedule the date or get a date with someone else we really got to start doing this and I believe as we do they're gonna start realizing you know we should show up on time because the girls that show up on time there they're getting the dates with the foreigners and the foreigners are walking from the girls who show up two hours late so it's gonna take some time it's gonna taste some consistency and that's that's really what I'm putting out there for all you expats when you get out here don't don't become a doormat don't don't sit there and wait desperately for two hours for her to show up while she she's because here's the other thing if she tells you she's on her way at minutes after : and then she tells you minutes later she's about to get on the jeepney you know what that means she lied to you so not only is she showing that she can't be punctual she's showing that she can't she can't be counted on to tell the truth and if she claims oh well I misunderstood I thought you meant you wanted me to leave the house at : and and then just show up and I'll be there when I get there well even that is not a big improvement over lying because that shows that there's really a communication problem if you're gonna date a girl you want to date a girl that you could communicate with and if she can't figure out the difference between arriving somewhere at : and leaving her house at : you probably want somebody with better English skills than that so that's my recommendation to you expats a -minute grace period after that it's up to you you want to sit around for two hours fine I'm saying we need to start laying down the law and just saying you know if you can't show up within minutes of the agreed time I'll find someone who will that's what we need to communicate all right love to hear your feedback tell me your stories about Filipinos how late they showed up how how long you waited how it went and we'll talk about it there in the comment section all right see you then you\n",

      "Video Id: REvaHqT3uro, Segment: liters per person and basically put so we almost got two full leaders in here as you can see that gives us about a quarter tank and so we're gonna be cruising up this way see where we end up in the El Nido area all right guys we're just cruising down this way sometimes it's nice this is like a such a great way to see the island is just get on the bike have no destination in mind and go for a nice cruise like we are not sure what we'll find going Inland like this but you'll never know unless you try it out you know what I'm saying maganda hapon all right we're arriving to a place called Leo I'm not entirely certain what Leo is outdoor chilling spot maybe it's a resort or an area okay long the local guards there Sito Uno looks like a bunch of like restaurants and stuff there tricycle terminal oh wow that is literally a terminal of tricycles but these ones all look the same oh we got the Bros speeding up Full Speed Ahead oh we got a speed bump oh all right turn right to Leo Beach that was a nice little cruise to get here and it's just a little pocket I recognize this we're right by the airport so this is like a hangout spot you go left you're at the airport you go right I think this gets us to the beach got some major jungle Vibes though like a Wood Bridge that's bringing us through like I guess the swampland kumusta kuyo jungle this looks pretty epic that's for sure wow guys you just take a deep breath and you can smell the sweet smell of nature a little yes sir just this because this way is okay yeah can we check to see if anyone left excuse me sir thank you all right Full Speed Ahead oh yeah probably all right looks like this is one option for parking Maybe oh there's plenty of parking over here no worries I see two spots brother not allowed why is that restricted okay oh oh maybe it's a covid- camp aign camp which way kuya right turn we uh what about to the right to the right all right all right he's radioing him salamat thank you Po all right so let's see where this brings us it's like a big nature area we got people taking a walk over there just need to find a spot to drop the bikes around here vehicle park and motorbike parking right here all right and let's find ourselves a spot we made it looks like we have made it to the Leo area some really exotic palm trees I mean look at how tall this thing is and it's not until the very very top probably say feet maybe uh to meters something like that high so insane palm trees but it gives it such an exotic look this is an official welcome to the Philippines.\n",
      "Video Id: REvaHqT3uro, Segment: Hello El Nido.\n",
      "Video Id: REvaHqT3uro, Segment: Guys we've got a rainbow in the distance I don't know if you can see that on the camera but we've got a knife rainbow way out there in the distance from making progress we got local Filipino traffic right there is it one back uh over this way and we're gonna take a left we're actually at this house right here at the left of the corner and they told us to go this way so we just retraced our route spent minutes going this way all right all right we have located the beach after uh passing it there it is not fun beach oh it's muddy as hell let's hope I don't crash that's what bumpy ass road going down this way my friends foreign all right it's definitely a more villagey area over here that's a good sign whoa we got the Ducks hanging out here down boy down boy sit yeah this is one muddy ass Road holy wow it's literally sludge oh definitely if you're riding around here go real slow I got my feet on the ground almost what a mission you know which way bro all right we have made it what an adventure all right it's a interesting arrival spot here park the mopeds there right here we've got some really thick barbed wire you think they're keeping like a T-rex or something inside of here it's like the longest barbell I've ever seen so we've got some cows in there a little baby calf right there too and this is going to be the very commonly spoken about Beach that we're going to show you guys we're only up just a little bit of time here because unfortunately with a couple wrong turns and confusion on the directions we only just arrived about minutes before the Sun is setting and it looks like we're hitting a super high tide too from the distance here oh bro I'm thinking about getting a coconut you want one uh your coconuts coconuts yeah can we have two coconut please kuya two fresh ones with the slaughter device there we go chopping that thing right up so this is uh from Philippines coconut yeah locally grown El Nido coconut oh look at that spraying everywhere landu nice to meet you landu oh so we got one Delicious coconut right there oh don't want to get hit with that dagger and all right you're really just absolutely smashes that thing how many coconuts you sell per day what how many coconuts do you sell per day and magkano kuya okay all right oh I got it bro feeds Perfect all right let me just grab this for you brother all right each all right that's uh for you to buy you and your family one extra coconut too salamat kuya enjoy oh thank you bro hey so we've got two fresh are these King coconuts King coconuts all right here we go we're gonna go ahead and test this thing out drink about two-thirds of it right there delish my friends I do love the king coconuts when they're able to get them uh hold right out right when they're like ice cold you know if they keep them in a cooler but honestly this is so refreshing after a solid hour drive here right at the sunset we got a little Misty rain in the distance here but waves crashing a very light sunset in the distance behind that little mountain right there in this couple looks like tourists showing right there so it's really like it feels way more like a local beach than the other Beach we just showed you but still you know like definitely designed for the tourism but like not as like overrun as some of the other places we've seen in terms of like amount of development I just tasted this one and it's got like maybe it's not ripe or something it's got like a soury like bitter app never once had a coconut like that before all right so we're getting to a little Isthmus here as you can see we've got water on both sides coming in here and then coming in here and then we have both sitting right up there in the middle and it leads to this then there's like one little house sitting out there on that island in the distance and a couple more that just surround this just goes to show you like that's how there's like different islands in the Philippines they're just kind of like pop up in every direction you look you're gonna see all these little Islands oh look at this we've got a couple calves right here cruising around the beach pretty good life this little uh car right there is drinking a coconut Yum Yum Yum yeah a little one went for a little run got the Zoomies in them there's my brother's future house right there right yeah no it's a really really beautiful place it looks like it's someone's home hard to tell but yeah gate leading right up to this beautiful palace of a house surrounded by palm trees such a vibe so yeah guys a pretty quick look at the side of the island yeah I'm hoping to visit El Nido again in the future because obviously some of these videos have been pretty fast paced through here and I haven't like fully dove into the culture of things to do and you know everything in there but it's like a nice little highlight both to get me excited and you guys excited when I Explore More of the areas on the island of Palawan but we're gonna head on back we'll see you there kuya yeah brother it was a great time really nice time thank you all right guys and just made it back to the hotel room so as always thank you so much for watching and we'll see you in the next video\n",
