[Music]
the cim V I said I'm going to T to buy
fruits uh for my New Year's tradition so
let's go to TLA I let's buy some fruits
round fruits of different variety rounds
round represents money so yes let's go
like this one this
one we that
this don't know if get avocado it's not
so it's not super soft the
avocado
watch hi
guys okay it's New Year and you know
when it's you New Year we have so many
tradition s belief and everything so in
the Philippines we have the
belief or we have Traditions like you
have to prepare 13 round fruits or for
me it's 13 different kind of fruits
fruits are sweet so the whole year it's
your life will be full of sweets and
some of it are rounds so rounds for us
on the Chinese means money so here in
Bosnia what are your Traditions you can
comment down below what do you guys
prepare before the Christmas I mean
before the new year before New Year will
come because this one we prepared this a
day before or two days before the new
year so we always prepare this
traditions of ours
so the pineapple is for the Chinese is a
symbol of prosperity so you can see in
so many Chinese houses they have golden
pineapples that's being placed inside
the house red colors it's also a sign of
abundance and prosperity so we took that
from the Chinese you know so
many uh Filipino Chinese are living in
the Philippines so that's why I guess I
guess that we took that uh belief from
them so that's why my family we always
use although this is not super round but
since it's a symbol of prosperity and
abundance we usually use pineapple as
one of those 13 fruits
in the Philippines there are so many you
can find round fruits during these times
it's very expensive even one piece is
very expensive like one apple maybe it
will cost one Marka so yeah so now we
have to prepare the
fruits and M we also have Dr paper or M
are we going to make that like with
thing on The Cutting Board yeah that's
called Char ter board but tomorrow so
yeah this is called Prosperity Bowl so
this is one of those but I will make
three that's our tradition so first off
is this
one what kind of pineapple it's just a
pineapple DOA so yes I'm not going to

dark so this is for my chory board and
Dada bought me a green grapes so yeah we
have green grapes this

Rasberry can be considered fruits but I

the fruits first and then we will do the
rest like the rice the water the salt
the most important elements of your life
like you cannot live without water you
cannot live without R uh salt you cannot
live live without sugar so those are
