Hi everyone! We made it! We are in BGC, in Manila!
We came here, we came finally here! Let's explore 
around, to see why BGC is the most luxurious  
part of Philippines! Yo, guys just check this 
out! This is a Lambo on the streets! Yes, over  
there! Did you see it? Oh wow! yes! and that's 
a Bentley? yes this is a Bentley! okay not bad
you're beautiful
Gigi I want this car! yes I want it for me I want 
to be driven in one of those because this kind of  
car is not for you to drive it around this kind 
of car is for you to be driven around so I need  
this car and I need the chauffeur so we're gonna 
grind on those explorers until we can afford one  
of these cars deal or we can ask the guys really 
really nicely if they can survive GG it's more  
complicated like this easier you have to work 
your ass off and then you earn this car perfect  
okay we can do that whoever said that Philippines 
is a third world country has never come here has  
never set food in the Philippines just check this 
place out it is absolutely mind-blowing I mean it  
doesn't look like Manila anymore I mean I wouldn't 
have ever expected it to be so so fancy and so  
so clean and everybody obeys the rules here the 
traffic police is enforcing the rules like this  
buildings these are so cool I mean I would be very 
much interested to live in one of these I wonder  
how much the rent is in one of these apartments 
okay yeah yeah pretty nice I mean especially in  
that Green Building all the way up to the top 
that would be a perfect place to stay and you  
can Overlook the entire area from here I like 
it good one Mike that's a good one I mean hi hi
I want to say the things and the people are super 
friendly here and they're welcoming us to their  
city so that's super super cool okay as I was 
saying Bonifacio Global City it has been named  
after a person who fought for the independence of 
a Philippines against the Spanish another thing  
is the fact that this land is on the property of 
the tall green this tricked nearby Makati and it's  
also part of the Metro Manila you have these huge 
insane skyscrapers here that I don't know I would  
have never imagined they would have existed before 
coming here looks like New York or Seawolf or  
I don't know it's really really complicated 
to draw a line but it's it's not a third world  
country anymore some say that this is the also 
the safest area in Manila in the Philippines  
and it is the most pedestrian friendly area of 
Metro Manila you can see that a lot of people  
come here to work and to do their shopping and 
they live here a lot of apartment blocks a lot of  
offices this is the the thing that I noticed 
instantly when I came here a lot of apartment  
blocks offices and a lot of high-rise 
buildings it's it's pretty pretty insane
oh my God yeah I think it's the building and 
well this happened please subscribe to our

pay for the Drone back so hopefully somehow it's 
gonna work out anyway the sponsor of our video

a videographer this was the tool that I was using  
to edit now heading towards future me to tell 
you a little bit more about filmora filmora 11

to continue the video and now coming back to the 
video we can continue our exploration around here  
now we have arrived on the High Street and Gigi 
checked out this kind of interesting architecture  
they have here it's a boulder and some dogs 
and another boulder up there and some pipes
yeah okay interesting and behind us are all these 
big skyscrapers which are towering into the sky  
and we are looking for foreign yes because as 
you saw previously um something happened and well  
hopefully we can find the replacement 
here in uh in Manila but nevertheless  
forget about it it's just things Gigi material 
things they come and go anyway if you like it  
here in BCG well it's Lively modern super 
modern like I don't know if I'm in New York  
or in Philippines or in Seoul or anywhere around 
this world but this place totally looks like off  
the charts yes it is definitely something else 
I mean it's in super huge contrast with the old  
Manila we've been before yeah this one is totally 
different I mean I don't know it's like we have  
been transported into a different world Gigi 
into a part of the universe that is very true  
where Manila is futuristic and interesting and 
nice looking look at the puppy hello how are  
you oh you like you do more he prefers females 
okay yeah I don't know why this thing tofu hello  
this is the first time I ever in my life I've been 
rejected by a dog it's time for first here in uh
okay time to go thank you so much thank you uh 
yeah tell me that this doesn't remind you of  
the orchard in Singapore oh yes exactly now that 
you mention it it's more or less similar to your  
church except the fact that they don't have a 
very high-end super expensive mall around here  
which something tells me that they do considering 
the fact that they have like a Bentley in the  
Lamborghini shop and other high-end luxury 
cars around here wow guys cool this this tree
so this looks insane yes just look at this place  
oh man look at those buildings I gotta show 
you a little bit of the angle check this out
this is insane I mean just look at this just 
look at those buildings man with the whole like
scrapers and sky high buildings to save it's 
insane oh my God the secretive and they start  
to look even even more beautiful during the 
evening like as soon as the evening starts  
it looks even more beautiful yes I don't know 
how it's possible but it is this is the Central  
Square guys as you can see a lot of skyscrapers 
this is not vanilla I had no idea it would look  
like this like this is New York guys this is New 
York definitely just look at this like come on
what like what is this insane
so cool this is Michael cannot stop taking 
pictures he like what's going on I don't  
think we have a an area in our country that 
looks like this like a city that looks like  
this I don't think we have this maybe just the 
capital city but not even that one because like  
in Europe you have more like historical buildings 
but here everything is new and fresh and modern
later SM aura Mall here in this 
GC and Philippines is incredible  
already the Christmas preparations have 
started and this mall looks amazing  
unfortunately we're here not for pleasure 
we're here to look for a DJI store because well  
that can also be fun let's see it's a gorgeous 
gorgeous mall like I love how they they have  
started to make all the design for the Christmas 
season looks absolutely gorgeous especially when  
you're from up top and you can see like 
the how the whole I don't know like old  
levels being enlightened and so many cute and 
pretty lights everywhere yeah hello hi hello
hi hi hello can you help me out a bit please 
I think I can do anything through this
service center not much to do right wow it's wow 
yes it decided to meet a building and well not a  
smart idea today yes that's what happened yeah 
it happens do you have another DJI Mini 2 here
what about I have already one remote 
control I then I have already the bag  
I would just need a new drone only 
ah you cannot buy that drone movie  
it's all set remote control okay with the new 
one not the smart one right with the display only
cool see that's why I need you 
to like and share and subscribe  
and click on the video so that 
uh maybe I can get another one
I feel like in a parallel universe  
were two different manilas exist together one 
universe is the old Manila and the new universe  
is BGC or Makati and this kind of stuff that 
you can find around here so yeah it's pretty  
insane I don't I cannot believe they're the same 
city like it's pretty crazy and this is our food  
bag number one and inside we have some rice hi 
bag number two and inside we have some drinks
and bag number three and inside we have
hey Burger and I think my bag is this 
one because it looks different so mine  
has Teriyaki written on it so this is 
the Tomato teriyaki burger and mine has
something wiggly wiggly that looks interesting in 
it I don't know what it is but let's check it out
mine is straightforward okay
kimchi some pork some egg and spicy stuff 
okay so far so good interesting combination  
though rice Patty on a burger who 
would have thought kind of good
definitely needs getting used to from the middle 
of BGC we thank you so much for watching our video  
it's an awesome place and the Sun is going down 
the view is amazing and I don't know it's time  
to go I hope you liked our video thank you
