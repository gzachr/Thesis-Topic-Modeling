Hello, Grandma
We are here!
My grandmother probably has never talked with a foreigner before.
It is unpredictable how she would react.
And I'm also very curious.
It's going to be fun.
Erica, look at me.
It's so cold.
hahahahaha
What is that thing on your head?
No, because we don't have a towel anymore.
We have to wash, so I used a towel for the hands.
Hello, grandmother!
I cannot look at her eyes? I have to do this? my head? (bow)
You can have an eye contact after you bow.
(practicing) Hello grandmother.
I'm Erica from the Philippines.
Nice to meet you, can I say these?
I'm so nervous..
We are almost close to the flower shop.
Are these fresh flowers?
We got some flowers and now we are on our way to pick up Ricky's mom.
(Ricky's mom) I got you a cool mask for summer.
It's made of cool fabric.
I got Erica a kid's size.
Thank you so much!!!
Oh it feels really cool.
First, me and my mom will go in first.
And explain the situation to my grandmother.
And then I will come and bring you.
So for the meanwhile, stay in the car.
Okay
(no answer)
I think she is taking a walk outside?
Isn't that grandma?
Yes, yes she is there.
Your grandma?
That's my grandmother
I'm in the car, just waiting for Ricky.
I'm quite nervous.
The reason I didn't go with them yet is because,
Ricky's grandmother doesn't have any idea that he already had a girlfriend.
And she might get surprised that Ricky is already married.
Why are you turning all the lights?
Switch off all the lights, it's very bright today.
(hahaha, we turned them on for the video)
We have free sun light coming in from the outside.
Let me greet you with a Korean bow first.
hahaha
Okay, good.
Come here.
You always call me every weekend, right?
To ask when are you getting married.
Grandma: No, I seldom do it.
Haha, you always do it!
Grandma: So what?
You don't have to do it anymore.
I met this girl when I was in the 1st year of university.
Grandma: That ...that long?
She is a foreigner.
How many siblings does she have?
Are both parents alive?
Yes.
Have you met their family?
Yes I have, many times.
What does she do?
She is an international sales manager, working in Seoul
So she is a foreigner?
From which country?
From the Philippines.
She is a Filipina?
She came to Korea to study.
She holds a bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering and finished her master in Business.
And now she is working in Seoul, South Korea.
She is working in Seoul?
Then she must be fluent in Korean?
Yes, she does.
We have been looking for an opportunity to tell you.
And I think now is the right timing.
How do you feel granny? About me getting married with a foreigner?
Are you okay?
It's your decision..I'm not in any position to tell you what to do.
Me and my wife, we love each other very much.
It would be very meaningful if you could give us your blessing.
Of course, you have my blessing.
It's better than getting old without a wife.
hahahahaha
It's not that we are desperate in getting married.
It's because we love each other.
It's based on true love.
Didn't you also get married based on true love?
(intense beat)
True love my ass...
hahahaha
Because of COVID19, we weren't able to have a wedding ceremony yet.
But we have reported our marriage.
And actually my wife is with me today.
Do you want to meet her?
Of course, she came a long way.
Is she in the car?
Yes, she is.
Go and bring her up.
Okay I will go and bring her up.
Ricky's mom : He explained it beforehand so you won't be surprised.
What's most important is that they love each other.
It's a global era we are living now.
It's Ricky's life.
Ricky is in love with a woman and having his own family.
We should respect that. It's not our life.
True.
The girl is smart.
Ricky likes a smart girl.
Not only smart,
but also simple and not materialistic.
And also very kind and understanding.
Ricky found something special in her...
Ricky is here!
Let's go up.
I told my grandmother.
Oh babe, how was she?
Did you tell her I'm a foreigner?
Yes, I did.
Did you tell her I'm....********
That one, I didn't.
hahahahaha
Actually, she took it somehow cool.
Oh yeah?
Grandma!
We are here.
Hello grandma.
Welcome!
I'm Erica from the Philippines.
Have a seat.
Erica: Nice to meet you.
Erica: It's a flower.
Grandma: Thank you so much.
Erica, why don't you greet her with a Korean bow?
Grandma, have you received a Korean bow from a foreigner?
Never.
hahahaha
(Korean traditional bow)
Come closer.
You have come a long way.
Thank you.
You two look very similar.
hahahaha
Yes she looks like Ricky.
She is beautiful.
Thank you.
Ricky doesn't also look like a Korean.
Ricky looks like ...... from Turkey? Middle East?
(Do I ? hahahahaha)
Stay healthy, Grandma
Young people also need to take care of their health.
Since you have been living in Korea for a long time,
did you get used to the food here?
Yes, but I can't eat something spicy yet.
Do you want some snack? fruits?
We have had enough before coming here.
You guys had a lunch?
Did you have a lunch?
There is one more thing.
She is now...
Pregnant!
Oh...Preg...??
Congrats!!!!
(To Ricky's mom) You are now a grandmother too!
Where will you give a birth?
In Korea.
Who will be taking care of her postnatal care?
Can you do it for her?
I can't even take care of myself.
I would do it if I'm 10 years younger..
(she is now 89 yrs old)
Her name is Erica.
Tell your Filipino parents that I'm very thankful for raising such a wonderful daughter.
And also thankful for marrying Ricky.
Erica: Thank you so much.
Erica: I want to cry ðŸ˜‚
When will you have a wedding ceremony?
I think we better do it after giving a birth.
Yes, do it after.
Because of COVID19, you can't have the wedding ceremony anyway.
Does Ricky's older brother have a girlfriend now?
I can't believe Ricky is becoming a father.
Time flies..
The timing is very good for your age.
Nobody wants to give an old person a hug.
No, No That's not true!
Is she taller than me?
I think it's the same.
Wish she is a bit taller.......
hahahahaha
Take care of yourself.
And always think something positive.
Thank you Grandma!
I cannot believe I finally met your grandmother.
I think your hands are still shaking.
I just didn't expect her to be that warm-hearted.
Actually, me too, since I know her personality..
It was very... unexpected.
Thank you for watching our video!
Thank you very much.
See you again, and I'm really hoping we can share many of our stories
Goodbye ðŸ˜ƒ
