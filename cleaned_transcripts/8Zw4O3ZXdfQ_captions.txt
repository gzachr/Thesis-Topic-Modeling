in today's video we will go on a private 
boat tour around one of the most famous  
and beautiful places in the Philippines coron 
join my friend Roman and me as we explore some  
of the most astonishing places I have ever seen 
this is what you come to see in the Philippines  
but will it be totally overcrowded with tourists 
and will that ruin the experience what can you  
expect at a world famous place like this let's 
find out feel free to join okay hello H what is  
your name Russell Russell okay nice to meet 
you and you I met you already right no other  
guys okay another guy okay let's jump on the 
boat then all right so it's going to be just  
this boat and then I think we're just going to 
be four persons here so Roman my friend and then  
the two tour guides / boat captains / chefs 
they're also going to prepare food later here  
on the boat for us okay let's go to one of the 
most beautiful places in all of southeast Asia!
Asia these are a very typical Filipino boat 
boats shaped like this for example the boats  
in Thailand or Malaysia they look very different 
so I would call this the typical Filipino style  
of the boats here wow it looks very beautiful 
here with all these Limestone rock formations  
reminds me a little bit of some areas in 
southern Thailand yeah as you can see we're  
basically entering the Lagoon here now and wow 
this is already beautiful this is wow yeah the  
right from the from the peer to get here was like 
10 minutes now so very quick and easy actually
and the water looks already really clear here 
I can literally see the ground from here it  
might be hard to see on the camera 
but I would guess it's maybe 5 m or
so okay so I think we're going 
to enter the island here and then  
we have to hike up there and then 
from up there you have a beautiful
view yeah apparently one person 
died here before and since then  
it's mandatory to wear the life 
jackets oh maybe you can hold the
camera okay Sal much thank you very much okay so 
the plan is now first we're going to hike up there  
to see the the beautiful Viewpoint and then 
there's also a freshwater lake I think in the  
lagoon here and in order to swim there we need the 
life jackets but what a place look how beautiful  
it is here some little shops here some music 
playing okay guys are you ready for one of the  
most famous spots in all of the Philippines okay 
so this is the shot you always see on Instagram  
and on social media and then behind it it looks 
like this this is the side you usually don't see  
there's actually a cave right here which let's 
see how deep it is oh I think you can actually  
in theory enter the cave here okay so we have 
one or the most famous Instagram spot in the  
Philip now checked and yeah let's go straight 
to the next one then which is a lake which is  
around the corner here yeah I really have to 
remind myself to enjoy places like this more  
often when I film these videos I'm not really in 
a rush but you know like filming videos is like  
work for me so uh I have to always think about 
oh what what do I film what do I say something  
like that but then I look at the footage later 
at home and I always think oh wow this looks so  
incredibly beautiful like should have appreciated 
the moment a bit more and that's what I'm trying  
to do today as well okay are you ready for the 
next super beautiful famous spot this is the lake  
and I think it's a freshwater lake actually 
or mixed Lake but yeah check it out insane  
visibility yeah yeah it's very clear water here I 
as you can see it's almost nobody here now oh wow  
this is just uh wow it's no salt water it's fresh 
water right yeah so it's actually very very nice  
that this is not pure salt water so I was when I 
was jumping into the water I had some water in my  
mouth and you can taste immediately that it's 
not regular ocean salt water and you know the  
good thing about having a life jacket you can 
just float here which is actually pretty cool  
as well okay we are swimming to the cave here now 
but hey I'm really out of RS this is so beautiful  
just swimming here in the calm lake wow this 
is just the first place of today but I think  
already this is one of the most beautiful places I 
have seen in in the world yeah I think we have to  
swim through here okay oh wow this is amazing oh 
it's like a like a little cave in here with very  
clear water I can still see the ground here oh wow 
you can still see the sky yeah ah oh this is cool
wow okay in theory I think you can swim even 
further but it looks very dark it feels a little  
bit weird to just swim into the darkness I 
mean I can still see the ground oh this is  
a bit scary I think it's like another room like 
this actually yeah yeah but very dark very dark  
yeah and we made it out of the caveo that was 
interesting and you can't really see it from  
the outside if you don't know that there's a 
cave to swim into yeah already now one of the  
most beautiful places I have ever been to not 
only in the Philippines not only in Southeast  
Asia this is incredible reminds me a little bit 
about Co PP in Thailand if you do some Island  
tours there around Maya Bay also world famous 
it looks actually very similar how would you  
rate this 9.5 9.5 so there's still space left for 
improvements okay we are back on the boat we are  
leaving this beautiful first stop now off to the 
next beautiful one and then the idea is actually  
uh we're going to have lunch I think already you 
have some fish already here started to prepare  
already Fish and Chicken Fish and Chicken are 
you grilled or already yeah oh you grilled it  
over there yeah so that's actually pretty cool 
so we have a grill right on the on the boat and  
we have shrimp down there okay Filipino foods 
Pino food okay that look good P yeah ped ped
noodles you come here every day right yeah is it 
still sometimes no for one week sometimes race  
is one day so sometimes only once a week but 
you still think it's beautiful although You'  
seen it like maybe 100 times yeah this is what 
I like about having a private tour it's more  
chilled right it's not rushing from one place 
to the other together with 50 other people can  
take your time you can leave whenever you want 
you can stay as long as you want this is Twin  
Lagoon yeah here we have to use the kayak right 
yeah we can use the kayak that's a second Lagoon  
inside other side yeah and after that we can see 
the tunnel there inside yeah and we can go under  
but first then let's enjoy the food food that 
they prepared okay Chicken shrimp uh noodles  
and the fish water and Coca-Cola do you want to 
eat with us yeah I don't think we can finish this  
you want to eat as well you can eat as well with 
us I think this is too much for us yeah defitely  
I don't think we can finish this so I don't mind 
if they would actually join us oh but yeah guys  
what a place to have lunch right check out the 
view from here the water here once again super  
clear but this yeah we have a lot of boats here 
now so this is here one of the most famous spots  
around here obviously but still I would rate this 
a very beautiful place to have lunch definitely oh  
the noodles are really good wow I really like 
the noodles and fresh juicy pieces of chicken  
here all right let's also try the fish here so we 
can actually get huge pieces of meat here I think  
you can really taste that it's fresh fish probably 
uh it was catched this morning yeah would be nice  
place to chill for an hour that what he was just 
saying but yeah we didn't finish all the food so  
I will just invite the boys to uh to try to eat 
the rest and I think we are now going to take the  
kayak to uh yeah swim into the Twin Lagoon here 
you can see already over there many people are  
doing the same they're actually charging a lot of 
money here for The Kayaks you have to pay I think  
1,500 pesos extra if you do want to have a kayak 
here but without the kayak it's basically almost  
impossible to explore the Trin Lagoon that's what 
I have been told and actually I can recommend the  
place where we booked the tour yesterday I went 
around the town and spoke to several different  
operators and then the place where I ended up 
booking the tour they made the best impression  
we sat down together planned the trip exactly also 
the food is included here we have the kayak and  
we in total paid a little bit over $100 for the 
whole tour including everything and yeah if you  
happen to be here you want to book the same tour 
from the same place or a different tour as well  
I will leave information about the place where we 
booked it uh in the description we didn't finish  
everything too much but very Mas up up you are 
very good Chef yes you can you can finish if you  
want you speak tagal here or bisaya tagal Tagalog 
right but you speak bisay no bisaya lamik oh L  
but from cibu are you from cibu yeah oh okay okay 
so you speak bisaya what do you prefer Tagalog or  
bisaya no still longer in Palawan but little bit 
speak Bay little bitay only so so your Tagalog is  
better now oh that's interesting okay you know 
where Mas upal for delicious and in southern  
Philippines and South they say okay let's take 
a kayak ride through the beautiful Trin Lagoon
here all right how do I hold 
my camera and pedal at the same
time okay so this is the entrance to the 
Trin Lagoon and wow this looks equally  
as beautiful as the previous spot I would say 
oh there's one guy standing on the Rocks over  
there probably very cool photo spot and yeah 
in case you decide to Safe the 1,500 PES that  
you pay extra for the kayak then you have to 
basically swim through the Lagoon wow this is
beautiful okay check this out so we have 
to drive underneath there and I'm just  
wondering well we have to duck down a lot 
then yeah like this okay I think is that  
there's another kayak on the other side well 
you can go first we wait on the side here
okay so it's actually possible 
very possible very possible that  
sounds good okay no more incoming 
traffic yet okay all right I think  
we have to light down like this and 
then oh yeah actually this is cool
yeah W okay that was fun and now we are inside 
another beautiful Lagoon here but all these  
Limestone walks are all around us okay and I think 
we have to continue over there so we can basically  
make a loop back to our boat and they said it's 
going to take like 20 minutes or so okay so it's  
peaceful here it's quiet it's very beautiful we 
have almost no people in this part of the Lagoon  
just a few more people coming from there and yeah 
the sun is about to set actually that's going to  
be hopefully the highlight of today later in the 
video we're trying to see the beautiful sunset on  
one of the the places around here oh we just see 
there's a vendor here on the boat hello hello what  
are you selling here you have some snakes oh let's 
see if we can come closer and have a look here or  
Coca-Cola Coca-Cola oh check it out Coca-Cola like 
a swimming Market here how much is it 40 40 40  
pesos only wow I was expecting a very high price 
uh for the location here you have um Sprite right  
yeah oh that is very unexpected suddenly there's 
a guy here selling some drinks and snakes oh very  
nice yeah okay okay 40 as well okay you have money 
right okay thank you very much it's fine it's okay  
keep the change thank you very much what else do 
you have what snacks do you have here chip chip  
Chips let's have a look what he selling oh I'm 
about to lose the pedal oh I don't we we just  
ate we very full but I'm just curious to see what 
you're selling what the chips chips I have cheese  
Rings ring cracker oh so much crispy P what is 
this crispy oh no no I'm I'm very full I'm just  
curious to see what what you what you have you 
come with this boat from the from coron you have a  
boat out there okay very very good business I mean 
he's the only person out here selling drinks and  
snakes okay have a good day byebye okay actually 
guys when you are coming here I do not recommend  
to get the Glass boat cuz actually it's worthless 
you can't really see anything with this boat  
anyway and it's very difficult to operate this 
boat because we don't have a have a fin so these  
uh plastic boats the usual ones they have a a fin 
to stabilize the boat which we don't have here so  
it's actually very difficult to uh yeah oh thank 
you thank you this is actually very difficult to  
operate this boat and also they charge like 500 
P extra if you want a glass boat compared to the  
regular kayak so I recommend to take a regular one 
oh it's funny as soon as we stop we just this boat  
just turns around because there's no stabilization 
I think the girls over there struggling too it's a  
bit difficult to operate this boat see as soon 
as we stop we're just drifting away in circles  
okay we just figured out it seems to be easier 
when just the person on the back is doing the  
work then it's easier to stabilize the direction 
we're doing a turn again but now we're turning
again okay we made it back to our boat that 
was now like 20 to 30 minutes I would say  
very pictures so I can really recommend 
if you're coming here get a kayak because  
otherwise yeah you have to swim all the way 
around which would take way longer but yeah  
I can't really recommend to take this boat no 
no take a regular kayak all right have a look  
the sun is looking beautiful now I think 
we will have a good sunset today we were  
a bit worried earlier about it but I think 
we might be lucky so we have one more stop  
now which is a shift wre where we can dive 
to I maybe cannot dive because it's too deep  
for me but he is actually a free diver so he 
will be able to dive down and then the final  
stop will will be a beautiful place to watch 
the sunset which I'm really looking forward
to there's a shipwreck over there where's the 
Shipwreck coming from Japanese like or just a  
fishing boat I thought it's from the from the 
Japanese from the second world war oh that's  
another one oh okay so we have a fishing boat 
wreck here which apparently here is 10 m down  
so that is too deep for me to dive down actually 
I did it free diving course in the Philippines  
last year as well but I wasn't too successful with 
[Music] it all right so as soon as I jumped into  
the water I basically could see some fish right 
away right next to the boat there were these  
colorful fish swimming and then I was also able 
to actually see the Shipwreck but uh yeah I was  
not able to dive down but my friend Roman was 
able to dive down to the wre and he was able to  
capture this footage from inside the rack so you 
can see it looks really really old it's just a  
skeleton looking wreck basically but I think 
it's actually pretty cool if you are able to  
dive down it's about 10 m deep how was it down 
there nice nice yeah you could actually so he  
has some footage on his GoPro which uh yeah 
I will use on this video as well so you just  
saw the footage already so he took it with the 
GoPro so you can actually swim inside the shift  
rack right yeah it's it's open it's more like a 
skeleton of a ship visibility was not the best  
but still okay still uh worth it for you to go 
down yes yeah right okay now Sunset spot yeah  
last one all right so this is the final spot a 
beautiful little Beach right here with in theor  
at least a perfect Sunset View at the moment 
the sun is still hidden behind the clouds but  
I think it could look good if the sun goes down 
between the clouds later on very good good job  
today so far okay so if you come unprepared 
there's actually a little shop here you can  
buy some drinks and snacks now I'm just suddenly 
speaking German in the Vlog behind the walk could  
be a good place that's what I said okay so we do 
have one other boat here with a few people but  
that's all right other than that I think this 
is a very beautiful spot for the sunset that  
is about to happen in like half an hour I like 
the contrast here you have beautiful water on  
this side and then right behind you you have these 
huge Cliffs right here and then a little beach to
chill okay what do you say should we 
drink a Sunset Beer yes I am prepared  
I brought some beers for exactly this 
moment okay here we go the classical  
Sun Miguel light Philippines best beer 
in my opinion it was it was in your bag  
for like yeah it was in my bag okay cheers 
buddy cheers cheers and also cheers to you
guys good to have you here thanks for visiting 
me we are actually a friend since high school  
I think since 10th grade in high school yeah 
and he's currently traveling around in Asia  
you're already in the Philippines for almost 
a month right yeah yeah so he was free diving  
free diving what was the island cutes it's near 
seu yeah nearu so he was doing some free diving  
there and then he decided he's coming over so 
we can spend a few days here in this Paradise  
in the Philippines actually we have met many 
times around this year few weeks ago we met  
already in Malaysia when I was there for a few 
days actually we met in the Philippines at the  
beginning of this year as well in January yeah 
and then we met in Bali in April yeah so we're  
meeting ourselves all around Asia basically 
throughout the whole year but yeah usually  
I'm enjoying a lot of these moments just 
by myself because I'm traveling solo most  
of the times but it's also good to have a good 
friend here now definitely so cheers once again
not the most perfect sunset today but hey 
it doesn't need to be perfect every time  
in order to be beautiful right so
