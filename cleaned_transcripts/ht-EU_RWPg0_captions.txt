- Hi. I'm Beryl and the
theme for today's video is
canned corned beef.
- Hahaha!
Corned beef!
- Before we get too far,
I do wanna say that this video
is made in partnership with Wondrium.
I will get to that later.
Now, about canned corned beef.
When I think about canned corned beef,
I think about Spam.
And so like those two just
kind of like live together.
And I did this video on Spam
and it really changed the
way I looked at the food.
Okay, Spam.
I could've eaten like three of these.
And I think I have a similar
kind of pre-conceived notion
about canned corned beef.
It was something - I
did not grow up with it.
And I had always thought about
shelf-stable meats as
scary.
And I know that I'm not alone
in thinking about it like that
and so I thought that this
episode would be a great way
to disband those stereotypes.
The artist today is Adam Scales.
This is the first time I'm
actually doing a photographer,
which I think is really cool.
When I was talking to
him about photography,
he said that every photograph
is a bid for immortality.
I love it.
I love it.
I'm leaving a link to
where you can see his work
and you can support him in any way
that you wanna support an artist.
The first time that I
had canned corned beef
was actually quite early on.
I made a dish called
Internet from Indonesia
and I'm gonna show that dish to you now
'cause it is
very awesome.
Today, I'm making Indomie Telur Kornet.
Also known as Internet.
It's a bit of rice
with the indomie,
green scallion,
canned corned beef,
and an egg.
This is a really popular street
food actually in Indonesia.
I'm gonna chop up the green onion.
And then I'm gonna open
the canned corned beef.
This was my first time
and I really struggled.
Like a lot.
And then I struggled some more.
What?
Why is this so hard?
I don't -
Argh.
I tried to just use a
can opener from the top
but that was wrong so
I had to it again at
the bottom and success.
So I'm gonna cut it up
and cook it in a hot pan
so it gets all crispy.
It actually smells really good.
Boil the noodles per
the package instruction.
It's pretty obvious.
Looking good.
Okay, draining the noodles
and I'm gonna fry up my egg.
While I'm doing that,
I'm gonna plate it so
rice goes on the bottom.
Then I'm going to add the indomie
with the seasoning packets.
Cover with some green onion,
the cooked corned beef,
and the egg.
And I'm just adding some red chili flakes
and a little black sesame seed
and the dish is done.
Okay.
Whoa.
Oh my god, this is so good.
I need to come up with
a new phrase other than
"Oh my gosh, this is so good."
So I think that I probably
speak for quite a few Americans
when I say that I've not really dabbled
in the canned meat genre.
I know about Spam.
I've had Spam, I think it's good.
I have never had corned beef.
I actually didn't even
know that corned beef
came in a can.
Corned beef in a can is good.
Frying it up makes it all crispy.
It's salty, I mean this is definitely
a salty
dish but
I am not complaining
about that.
Love
salt.
I love it.
(speaks unintelligibly)
Opening the meat.
I don't - why was that so difficult?
It was a pretty
humbling experience.
I will say that.
If any of you are thinking,
"Oh, that looks interesting but
I don't know about the
corned beef in a can."
I hear you, I was there.
I'm telling you it's good.
Honestly.
And now, it is time to eat
some canned corned beef.
- Hi, Beryl.
I'm Elena.
I'm from Pensacola, Florida.
And I'm here today to tell you about
corned beef hash fritters.
Corned beef hash fritters
are something that I grew up with
and I love dearly.
Basically what it is, corned beef hash, is
boiled potatoes with spices
and then diced canned corned beef.
You mix it all together.
You could put it on bread or crackers,
very simple.
My mother would make it all the time.
But that was just the one part ingredient.
My favorite thing when I would come home
and see mom making corned beef hash
was that I knew that the next day,
we were gonna be having the fritters.
So with the leftovers,
she would fold in the corned beef hash
into just a basic pancake mix
with however many pancakes we wanted.
So you fold it in,
you put it in the frying pan
with a little butter
until it's golden brown.
It tastes soft and
savory and warm and salty
and it's just like your mom
hugging you when you eat it.
It's wonderful.
Canned corned beef or canned
meats in general get a bad rep,
they're misunderstood.
I think it's because
people don't understand
how to utilize their flavor.
They're intimated by it.
But once you take a step
and go for it,
it can be just something that
you will eat and eat and eat
for the rest of your days.
So I remember coming home from school
and I would see mom making
the corned beef hash
and I would be so excited because I knew
that the fritters were
coming the next day.
And it was something to look forward to.
And it was like no matter
what kind of day I had,
whether it'd be a good day or a bad day,
when I would walk in
that door and smell them
and see her folding it
in and getting ready,
I would just be so stoked.
And I go to bed happy and healthy.
And so I just wanted to share
that recipe with you guys
and I hope that you
take a moment to try it out.
And I think that you'll really like it.
And enjoy.
Thanks, bye.
- Okay, I've got my corned
beef fritter/pancake.
Using the pancake mix,
I thought that was so cool.
Something that I've never
even thought to do before.
Wow.
This is so -
If I had a fried egg for this,
that would be
so good. This is like
perfectly savory
because you know corned beef
is the ultimate savory food.
Which is everything that
I want in this world.
But then
the pancake batter just
has like a little bit
of sweetness.
And it creates this amazing
balance, oh my goodness.
I don't know what to say because
I'm so impressed right now.
What a way to start the episode.
I am
fully on board with this recipe.
I know that I haven't tried
the other dishes yet but
I will say that if you're
somebody who's like,
"Oh, I'm kind of curious
to try canned corned beef
but I'm still nervous",
this is absolutely a
fabulous entry point because
it's pancake first, corned beef second.
But you can still taste the corned beef.
I definitely would put this
on everybody's to try list.
You could even make
them tinier and do like
little appetizer ones if
you were having people over.
Or just make 'em full-sized
pancakes like I did and
honestly you could have it for
breakfast with a fried egg.
And that would be so good.
- Hi Beryl, my name's
Serena and from the Bahamas.
Today I would like to speak
to you about our national dish
called Fire Engine.
Fire Engine is made
from canned corned beef
which usually comes in a square can.
It's reddish in color
and very salty and savory.
In the Bahamas, corned
beef is usually eaten
in the morning for
breakfast over white grits.
Or in evenings over white rice.
Fire Engine is made by
sauteing sweet peppers,
onions, garlic, fresh thyme, tomato paste,
and canned corned beef.
I kinda like it because
it's quite convenient
and very easy to cook and prepared in just
little less ten minutes.
In the Bahamas, we are a
country that consists of
over 700 islands which
makes transportation and
refrigeration for a long
time very complicated.
So a lot of people preferred
shelf-stable meals,
sort of canned meats,
sort of tuna, mackerel,
and corned beef.
In my family,
Fire Engine is usually
one of the first dishes
that we would learn to make growing up.
My dad always let us help him prepare it
so it always has a very
special place in my heart
with memory of my father.
I think someone should
try it for the experience.
I think they may be surprised
at how savory and salty
but also very good it is.
Some people may find it intimidating
because of the sodium content
for preservation reasons.
But I think that it should be tried.
It is awesome.
- This is Fire Engine from the Bahamas.
I looked up why it's
called fire engine and
one of the things was that
because of the heat from the pepper,
it feels like a fire in your mouth.
Fun.
(laughs)
Mm.
The spices definitely -
(coughs)
(giggles)
Fire engine. (laughs)
The lime is adding a really
nice burst of freshness.
I think that the notion
is with a canned meat
that it's gonna be overly salty
and just kind of like,
maybe an overwhelming flavor
because of preservatives.
However,
this tastes super fresh.
I'm digging it.
It definitely has the flavors
of the Caribbean here.
It's -
it's really good!
I know
that the chances are that a lot of you
aren't gonna try a lot of these but -
This is just such a great way
to not only expand your palate but
to expand your world view.
This is my second dish.
I'm converted.
Canned corned beef for the win.
I feel like the tomato paste with the -
(coughs) Excuse me.
I feel like the tomato
paste with the lime juice
is blending to help alleviate
the saltiness of the meat.
With the rice, everything comes together.
It's like filling, it's delicious.
It's so flavorful.
I think when it comes to
having canned corned beef,
you're not gonna have a bland dish.
And starting from that point is like -
That's always a good thing, right?
- Hi everyone, I'm Tia.
I'm from Melbourne or
Narrm, the traditional
lands of the Kulin nation
here in Australia.
And the dish that I am going
to introduce to you today
is a baked macaroni.
So this dish as the name suggests,
is a baked pasta dish.
It combines tube pasta
with the corned beef sauce,
parmesan cheese,
eggs as a binder,
and then it's baked in the
oven until the top goes
all dark and crispy.
I like this dish a lot because
it's a real staple in my family.
The dish actually comes from Malta,
where my grandpa was born.
And based on the simplicity
of the ingredients
and the recipe,
we actually believe that
it was a wartime dish.
It's cooked in big batches
and it's easy to make so it would've been
a really simple way to feed a large family
on a tight budget.
Baked macaroni was actually one
of the first cultural dishes
that my nan learned to
make after she got married
to my grandpa.
She actually got the recipe
from my great-grandmother Magdalena.
And then she passed it onto
my mom and then onto me.
Growing up in a multi-cultural
family in Australia,
this dish has been one of the few ways
that we've been able to stay connected
to our Maltese roots
since my grandpa died.
And my nan still makes it for us today.
I think people should
try this dish because
it's extremely heartwarming.
There's something about the
combination of flavors that
makes me feel really happy and
given how difficult times have been
lately with this pandemic,
I think everyone could use
a little carb-induced joy.
- So this is a baked
corned beef and macaroni
bake.
Bake.
Corned beef and macaroni bake
from Australia.
But obviously the roots
of it came from Malta
and I loved seeing photos
of Tia and her grandmother.
Tastes like ragu.
Huh.
The curry is
interesting though.
Oh no, the shifting light.
Cloud...
go back.
The curry powder that I used
was
a curry powder from
my new grocery store and
Tia did say to use a mild curry powder.
But I didn't wanna buy more
curry powder so I was like,
this'll probably be fine.
I will say though, it
is definitely strong.
However,
I do think it still also gives
it a really nice back flavor.
The parmesan cheese crustiness though,
it's good.
Crusty parmesan cheese
is a simple pleasure but
something that I
cherish. (giggles)
This is a really nice twist
on a traditional baked pasta dish.
And a cool way to shake it up.
And honestly, this tastes just like
any sort of beef sauce but
was 10,000 times faster to make.
Like this dish took two
seconds to put together.
I did a little bit of
reading about Malta and
I was curious, why was corned beef there?
And it was because of British occupation.
The British really brought
corned beef everywhere they went
as a military force and
so you'll see corned beef
in a lot of places where
there were military strongholds from
occupiers.
And as you guys may know
or as you've learned
from this channel even,
when these outside
dishes and foods come in,
they get readapted and brought
into the local cuisine.
And so now, corned beef is a
part of Maltese cuisine which
was really surprising
and interesting to learn.
And this is a great segue to
talk about the sponsor today,
Wondrium.
And I wanted to pair with
them because I feel like
the concept of Wondrium is
to be curious about the world
and that is
me to a T.
I'm a very curious person and I feel like
a lot of you are curious as well.
And that's why you like this channel.
Or maybe you just like watching me eat.
I don't know. (laughs)
If you've never heard of Wondrium,
it is a site that hosts short
and long form documentaries,
tutorials, and how-tos that honestly cover
the gambit.
You can find everything from a documentary
about the foods that
people ate in ancient Rome,
all the way to how the
1960s shaped the Beatles
and the music that they came out with.
The videos are well-produced.
They're led by experts
and it's a great way to
explore your curiosity about things.
I did watch a tutorial on there
after the knife incident of last week.
And it was on how to
properly cut an onion.
Like keeping your finger tucked
and the different ways
that you can get a dice.
It was just really interesting
and it was great to be taught by a chef.
And I liked that.
If you are curious,
you can get a free trial.
Just go to wondrium.com/beryl
and they'll give you access
to their whole library.
- Hi, Beryl.
My name is Bethan and
I'm from Great Britain.
I live in Ceredigion in West Wales.
The dish I'm sharing with everyone today
is the corned beef rissole from Wales.
Around the world it seems there
are variations on rissoles
which are more kind of
like meatball-type things
but in Wales they're a bit different.
They're commonly sold
in fish and chip shops
and people rarely make them at home.
Welsh rissoles are traditionally
made with good-quality
canned corned beef.
I do think that corned beef
along with other preserved meats
is kind of misunderstood.
I think that people tend
to overlook them because
they're off-put by the
idea of meat in a can.
But that's really a shame because
it's such a versatile ingredient.
It's been around since the 18th century
and it's cost-effective and long lasting.
And if you prepare it just right,
it can be just as delicious
and comforting as fresh meat.
The corned beef is
chopped up and mixed with
cold mashed potatoes, sorted diced onions,
and your choice of herbs.
We tend to use dried thyme or sage.
Rissoles are pretty hefty.
And in my opinion,
they're a great pick-me-up
after spending a day at the beach.
Welsh weather tends to get a bad rap but
rissoles make up for any amount of rain.
And after swimming in the
freezing Cardigan Bay,
a rissole is just what
you want to warm you up.
The origin of the corned beef rissole
is actually quite unclear.
Some people suggest that
a potato and herb version
came to Wales from Italy
around the 17th century
and that corned beef was only added
during rationing in World War II.
However, some people can
remember corned beef rissoles
from before then.
So, obviously you can tell from my accent
that I'm only half-Welsh.
My dad is Welsh and
although I grew up in England,
I would often go over to
Wales to visit my family.
I first tried a rissole when my dad
took me to his favorite fish bar in Gower,
which is this really beautiful area
on the south Wales coast.
I distinctly remember how excited
he was for me to try them.
And that really made them extra special.
Whenever I have a rissole now,
they always make me think of him.
And since I moved to Wales,
I get so excited whenever
I get to share a rissole
with someone who's never tried one before.
I think people should try rissoles because
they're so unique and delicious.
And they're really perfect after
you've had a long, hard day
just to treat yourself.
I really hope you give them a try.
Even if you can't get a proper
one from a Welsh chip shop.
- So this is the Welsh rissole.
And like I feel like this looks
like what fried food looks like.
If that makes sense.
Like it looks perfect is
what I'm trying to say.
It's brown.
(ketchup bottle farts)
That was the ketchup.
And I feel like
you guys know, a little bit
of Kewpie never hurt anybody.
Ah.
Oh my god, it's hot.
I can't do it.
This was so hot.
Can you -
you probably can't see the steam.
There's literally steam coming out of it.
No wonder I struggled.
I need to wait!
What's wrong with me?
Wow. I mean, yeah, this is pretty good.
I don't think this is something
that I would make at home
but now, if I ever saw this on a menu,
I think I would definitely order this.
These took a little long to make because
you had to cool them so many times.
And I think that cooling
them all those times
is what made the batter so perfect.
That's definitely something
that I'd never rly thought about before,
like being patient before you deep fry.
You know how sometimes food sets a tone?
This is making me wanna be in a pub
after a long day of hiking
and having a beer,
or no, probably having a cider
and ordering one of these.
This was something I never
expected to make at home.
Thoroughly enjoyed it.
And I also feel like I learned
a lot about deep frying.
- Hi, my name's Giselle and
I'm from the Philippines.
The dish I wanna share with you today
is called cornsilog.
A "silog" is any dish
in the Philippines with
"sinangag" which is fried rice
and "itlog", which is egg.
There are different varieties
of silog dishes in the Philippines but
today's episode is all about corned beef
so I'm going to talk to
you all about cornsilog.
It's quite easy to make.
First, you make fried
rice with day-old rice
and lots of minced garlic.
The Philippines is a
nation of garlic lovers.
Cornsilog is usually a breakfast dish
so we like to use leftover
rice from last night's dinner.
Then, you saute your corned
beef with sliced onions
and of course, more garlic.
This dish reminds me of weekend
breakfasts with my family
and also as a late-night drunk food
after a night out with friends.
You can literally find silog places
everywhere in the Philippines
which are open 24/7.
So it's also a favorite
late-night hangover fare
after a night out of partying
and drinking with friends.
You should definitely try this dish.
It's simple, it's hearty,
and it's fool-proof.
A lot of people think of
corned beef as disgusting
and super unhealthy but
there are definitely ways
to make it delicious.
And just like with any other food items,
when eaten in moderation is okay.
Enjoy!
- So this is cornsilog.
And I can already tell you that
everything smells like
beautiful garlic in my house and
I love that.
Oh, like garlic fried rice?
I mean, yeah.
Mm.
Garlicky.
Mm.
I would say of all the
preparations so far,
this one tastes the most corned beefy.
Like there's not much
else in the hash, right?
Other than the corned beef.
Ooh, my -
Like, look at -
That's a runny yolk.
I mean, you guys know
this about me that I love
savory breakfasts.
Like this
might be the queen
of them all.
I know that I do a lot of
dishes from the Philippines
and that's for two reasons:
One, a lot of you guys
are from the Philippines
and request them.
And two, this is just really a cuisine
that I'm just not that
familiar with and I love
exploring cuisines that I
really don't know much about.
I'm finding things that I like.
Each element individually is
really good but together...
Mm.
It's like an explosion of
flavor, it's delicious!
This is something that I
actually did not mention but
I've been using a few different
types of corned beef and
I can't tell the difference
between any of them.
They all taste the same to me.
I do think though,
of all the dishes,
this one is making me the thirstiest.
I don't want any of those
high-sodium comments.
- Hello everyone, my name is Meralis
and I am from the town of Adjuntas
in the island of Puerto
Rico in the Caribbean.
And the dish that I want to
share with you today it's called
canoas de platanos maduro
rellenas de corned beef,
which more or less translates to
sweet plantain canoes
stuffed with corned beef.
Back home, this dish was
mostly for special occasions.
And
you can eat it either for lunch
or dinner.
I like this dish because
it's very festive.
It's nice-looking, it's very special.
And
I've never seen something like this
in any other country that I have visited.
Corned beef is associated
with hurricane season
at least in my household.
But the very recent memory
that I treasure very much
happened 15 years ago,
perhaps more.
And I was staying in a beach cabin
with my father and my sister
and my mother brought some corned beef
and rice and one plantain.
And we had such a lovely
dinner that afternoon.
It was very nice, I remember the flavors,
I remember the ocean.
I remember the laughter.
It was very nice.
And I treasure that memory.
And nowadays we still
talk about that dinner
so we definitely need to repeat that.
I'm not here to defend corned beef at all
but I have to say that it serve
its purpose back in the day
and perhaps in modern times like
in this day of time, it's not
as needed as it was before
but we can't deny that
it's part of our culture.
- This is the big one.
My stuffed plantain from Puerto Rico.
I mean,
this is definitely reminding me when I did
my banana episode
of the plantains with
melted cheese on top.
I've never thought to stuff a plantain.
I'm imagining this as a hearty,
hearty meal.
Whoa.
What?
It's like
sweet and salty
and
soft but also kind of crunchy.
I didn't grow up eating plantains
and so whenever I eat them
I feel like I'm always like,
"Oh my god, these are great!"
Plantains are really great.
And versatile.
The recipe that I followed I'm
leaving a link in the description.
The guy was so fabulous.
He honestly -
There was nothing fancy
about his cooking video but
it was just really easy to follow.
I liked it.
As far as the corned
beef goes in this one,
I've somehow not noticed it that much.
Like it feels meaty but
it doesn't have the same flavor that
the Filipino breakfast corned beef had.
There is just so much
happening inside that mixture
and then you have the plantain that -
I guess I'm not that surprised.
What is -
There's a sticker on
the bottom of the plate.
I kept being like, what is on my hand?
Oh yeah.
There's a sticker on this.
I was trying to be cool but
the whole time, I was like,
what is sticky?
This would be a really
great meal for a group.
Not only is it super cost-effective, but
it is hearty.
I mean, I'm full.
I had half a plantain, I
didn't even have the rice.
Like, I'm full.
(laughs)
One more bite.
I feel like that's the anthem, right?
I'm full,
one more bite.
Mm.
Having gone through this episode,
I now feel like I really do have
a better sense of this ingredient and
a better understanding of how
canned corned beef is used
around the world.
You can't judge a meat
by the tin that it's in.
I think most of all, what
I've really learned is that
there are food narratives that exist.
And it's worthwhile to question them.
And to question
whether or not what you've heard
is what you actually believe or if
you're just going with the consensus.
And honestly, I imagine
that most of the consensus
is just going with the consensus.
So
that's just to say
try new things because they
might really surprise you.
And that's it.
I hope that you guys like this video
and I hope that you give
some of these recipes a try.
They are all in the description.
And I will see you
next week.
