hey it's not an overcast day
oh my goodness this guy is over here cleaning 
his wheel what the heck is going on over there
all right Virgos so here is the Saint Peter 
and Paul Parish Church home of the Virgin
Makati City what's in there you 
know what let's let's go up in there
this is like Catholic area not sure what's truly 
in here but we can take a look for the last shown
hello so we heal so I guess 
they do their church out here
you'll see many women here with umbrellas and 
you say hey it's not an overcast day why are you  
swimming using umbrellas there's not even cloud 
in the sky almost well the reason why it's cooked  
to the heat a lot of Filipinos essentially 
want to keep their skin safe from the Sun  
I say hey let that sun hit you 
oh my goodness this guy is over  
here cleaning his wheelie in public what 
the heck is going on over there the head
all right you see a lot of crazy things here when 
you walk the streets this is the Room Philippines  
Makati CPS and then we got some dangerous 
stuff going on here we got our guys fixing  
super this is a Makati Felice for repair they're 
actually fixing your car underneath this guy can  
get his leg run over at any time he's doing 
serious repair in the middle of the street  
wow man what do you know it kind of reminds me 
of Los Angeles in Los Angeles they have streets  
just as skinny as this and they have people 
actually fixing cars just like that in the  
middle of the street it's pretty crazy we got 
some demolition going on here South Africa is
barangay poblacion
City look at these mango trees
Maybe I don't know what they are agonal 
Street and then we have this DM Rivera
[Music]
got some more construction here 
I guess this should help with the  
flooding there's a lot of super flooding in 
this area hey how you doing Paul all right
so here in the city center of Makati we have 
the Museo Nong Makati we have the Central Park  
right there which says so they still have 
the signs from Christmas times and then  
a wonderful Park usually in most videos that 
I make in Central America I always go to the  
center Park but I think that this area here has 
a lot to offer so I don't need to go to the park  
I go to the park all the time let's look at 
something else covered court for blast show  
one thing that I never understood is that why 
in the world the municipality cities from all  
over the world even in the U.S why in the world do 
you plant trees next to the corner of the street  
why the question is do you not understand that 
Roots will continue to grow and whatever concrete  
you put on top of it will essentially just 
bulge up now making this walkway unwalkable  
look at this right here this tree essentially 
had to be cut down because I guess it was  
growing into the street and also look at the 
sidewalk people from all over the world stopped  
putting trees look at this water line that 
essentially probably was separate look at this
on the corners all right it doesn't look good once 
the tree essentially grows to maximum strength  
let's keep going
this is not a knock of Makati this is a knock of 
everyone they want to keep the city beautiful but  
it will essentially make the sidewalk come on
see what's up bro how you doing 
what you got Ube what is this
fish really you make it yeah you make 
good food okay maybe one day all right  
so nice people here in the Philippines keep going 
oh man these these sidewalks are killing me man  
can't even walk the hell 
gotta walk around the tree
what me yeah it looks like LeBron 
James LeBron James yeah why [ __ ] it  
yeah yeah my beer I'm not that 
tall LeBron is like super tall  
Salama bro I like LeBron James I have his 
shoes not today these are Jordans 37s but  
normally I do wear some some LeBrons normally all 
right it's not my folks appreciate it okay all  
right so pretty much everywhere I go people will 
stop me and say Hey you look like LeBron James  
that pretty much got that in every country other 
than Ethiopia Ethiopia they call me Michael Jordan  
so I'm neither but it's cool but it's cool to be 
mistaken for our famous basketball players and  
you never know what type of new friends you might 
find like off the beaten path of Pete burgo Street
skewers do anything you want
have fun press roaster they got coffee 
from Japan fresh roaster coffee all right
pump the brakes stop sign you saw the sign now 
you Ace of Base preacher saw them dollar signs  
he on that paper chase stuffing profits in his 
pockets a wolf with a sheep's appearance and  
the reason he's making that scratch huh it's 
cause those ears itch pimping out the gospel  
the prostitution a false Doctrine lies whistle in 
the wind but we listen if there's a little truth  
mixed in find a pastor that suits you on your TV 
with a suit and tie it's a ride in his private jet  
and you'll be looking stupid fly materialism 
and selfish ambition is a foolish religion  
The Riches of God's Mercy is worth more than your 
Superstition tell me how does a Christian begin to  
develop the sermon in wisdom first we submit every 
symbol in sign to the authority of the scriptures
the con that's completely consumed by symbols 
and signs if you are that's fine but don't you  
find it interesting how most of the time your 
self-interpreting seems to coincide with what's  
deep inside your heart's desires seems rather 
convenient doesn't it I'm not saying that God  
can't do it not saying that God won't do it 
that might very well be the case I'm simply  
making an observation of how much weight you 
place on it what seems to be at stake and how  
much of your faith is actually banking on it 
and how much of your mysticism is mixed with  
your religious philosophic system sometimes 
what we believe to be true for my Supernatural  
Pursuits is actually a fluke a series of events 
that's used to distract you from the truth but  
I'll give you a sign that's obvious one 
of the most Supernatural actors that God  
has actually revealed everything pertaining 
to life and godliness there's this idea that  
an individual is somehow more spiritual if he 
sees these signs and symbols and takes what's  
normally invisible and makes it simple but I'll 
say the mark of a mature man is the one who reads  
God's word and understands and allows that to 
govern his decisions and his prospective plans
I like it when the wind shifts they say it's 
the movement of the spirit still Small Voice  
I hear it remember that time I saw that leaf 
fall I was positive it was God's call wait for  
witnessing close y'all miss it I sight Gideon 
Samson Paul Elijah saw the cloud split and know  
that God did it and does it still still his 
presence feels like chills right and if I'm  
honest it doesn't happen often something must 
be wrong it's boring with my life is more like  
the Book of Ruth than Exodus I've never seen the 
part another ocean of a cloud by day or pillar  
by night just the normal everyday working 
of life with things that suck royally is  
evidence of his royalty scratch your temple 
so deep and simple silly us ignore the plane  
we prefer a riddle dying to see a miracle 
while holding God's diary looking for signs
