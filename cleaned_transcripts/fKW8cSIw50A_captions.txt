Noel, is this a Spanish tapas restaurant?
No, it's a mix of Spanish and Filipino cuisines.
These are fried potatoes with a sauce (cocktail?)
This looks very good.
It's gin with lime juice and basil.
And Noel took the famous Sangria house from Picara, very spicy.
With among others cinnamon
Health!
It is delicious. 
With basil it's great!
Noel, what do you think of Sangria? Top ?
Very spicy?
Nothing to do with Sangria in Belgium ...
This mixture is a bomb! With the basil.
What did we order Noel?
Paella, croquettes,
and tuna with escabeche!
So first course, as a starter, meatballs?
No croquettes! 
Sorry...
but Filipino-style croquettes.
with spinach, Filipino version.
Ah it's vegetarian? No meat ?
OK !
Philippine-style vegetarian croquettes!
Visually, it's very very pretty!
It makes you want...
This is what is original here.
Filipinos are very open to new flavors
In Europe, traditional croquettes are often made with cheese, for example.
But in the Philippines, we adapt.
We put our Filipino touch.
There is also a meat version but I did not order.
No, it's very good Noel.
Delicious.
This is tuna.
At the escabèche.
The escabèche is a heritage of Spanish cuisine, taken up by Filipino cuisine.
It's a little sweet and vinegar.
I do not know what it is ?
It looks like mash ...
Mashed Sweet Potatoes!
It looks great!
Finally, this is where we realize that Spanish and Filipino cuisines are linked.
Many things are alike in the two kitchens.
Even the names are the same.
It's very interesting.
There is in particular the ceviche
The adobo also which refers to European dishes
It looks a bit like a bourguignon beef.
There are influences.
It's obvious.
The difference is that in Europe, we don't use soy sauce!
The Philippines is replacing traditional seasonings in Europe with soy sauce for example;
So what tuna?
Delicious !
Naturally with rice!
It's very good and fine!
The famous Paella!
Mix and table service!
It's original.
So it's a crab paella.
And the original aspect is that it mixes it, directly, in front of you!
I love it because it's not the traditional paella that you find in Spain.
Very good. 
With a large rice, like risotto
Is it crab?
Crab tempura.
The caramelized rice is very good.
It's crisp.
That's great
For our first restaurant in Manila, we eat super well!
Thanks to Noe's friend, Chimvie, for advising us on this restaurant.
It was therefore the test of the restaurant "Le Picara", at BGC.
