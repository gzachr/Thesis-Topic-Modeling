this video is brought to you by Squarespace  
we have finally made it to the 
Philippines welcome to Manila
it seem to be very very popular like I said 
they're everywhere we're gonna go inside and  
check it out and we believe there's 
something really really cool inside  
so I think I'll go for that like a piece 
of chicken and then like a it's spaghetti  
it is a Mad Mix yeah I actually thought it 
was a dish I didn't know it was an actual  
chain yeah like a field Channel I thought it 
was a traditional Filipino meal yes BGC it's  
actually very very nice that Samantha said 
it's spotless we've never seen a place so  
clean Jollibee you have to try Jollibee 
so we're like right we have to try it
the Philippines is maganda yes we are in Manila 
the capital city of the Philippines and in  
this video we're going to give you our first 
impressions of what this city is like this is  
where we begin our Philippines Journey but like I 
said we're standing right here in Manila and we're  
excited to check the CEO if you're new around here 
I'm Samantha and this is Keelan and together we're  
go time travels we're a travel couple that comes 
all the way from Ireland and we're so excited to  
be here in the Philippines in the capital city 
Manila we're going to be spending a bit of time  
in the Philippines or so excited to make some 
videos to explore this country so if you are  
new around here don't forget to subscribe to our 
Channel hit the notification Bell as well so you  
don't miss any other future uploads but for now 
let's go and explore this incredible City so as  
you can see around me here it's nice and green 
it's a lovely little Park called Manila it is  
one of those big massive Asian mega cities and 
I suppose it is a bit surprised about how big  
and how advanced the Manila is I mean it's one of 
the most densely populated cities in the world I  
think there's roughly about 14 million people 
that live here Philippines itself I think has  
over 100 million so it is a massive country big 
population like I said we've been discovering  
that these big mega cities in Asia they're just so 
big they're so Advanced and Manila is definitely  
no different I will say from the first look I 
think the skyscrapers the buildings that we've  
seen here I don't think I've seen any as big 
as in Manila and if you knew like from where  
we are in Dublin we don't have buildings like 
that so to see them is just incredible so yeah  
from our research we gathered that Manila 
was going to be sort of this crazy hectic
and we are staying in the Makati area so 
I don't know I suppose we have to explore  
more but maybe it's going to get more 
busier and more hectic we still have a  
lot more to explore but yeah so far it's really 
really but I will say it's a little bit windy
they are killed okay so we keep seeing these 
things right here they are called jeepneys  
and it is like a former transport in Manila it 
took a communal taxi basically and what they  
are is they're old American military Jeeps that 
the Filipinos have compared to them into these  
taxis which is really cool we keep seeing and the 
like the Tuk Tuk of uh of Manila if you haven't  
actually got one yet but uh I think we'll have 
to assume stage over the next few days in Manila  
we'll have to jump in the jeepney they seem to be 
very very popular like I said they're everywhere  
we're not too sure the real yeah works and you 
know I'm sure they have some sort of sort of plan  
that they drive through or whatever so we'll have 
to figure out and also the prices well but yeah  
this is them here they're really killed all right 
so we're heading to our first stop of the day and  
I've just ordered a grab he should be here any 
minute so it's great that grab actually works over  
here me and Kelly knows it all the time and it's 
just a really cheap way getting around the place  
there's a grabs mother there sadly 
that is not our grab our driver is here
hello foreign
autograph and we are at the Venice Grand Canal 
mall and it's an Italian inspired Mall as you  
can guess probably by the name of it but uh we're 
just looking here as well the Venice residents
anyway we're gonna go inside and check it out and  
we believe there's something 
really really cool inside
so as you can see there's an actual Canal 
inside it where you can take a gondola rides  
hello kale is that oh it's so cute isn't 
it like it's literally done out like an  
Italian architecture yeah it's like a movie set 
it's really really cool yeah I've never seen a  
shopping center like this so yes it's actually 
modeled off Venice hence the name of the mall  
and yeah the miles I mean since we've come to 70 
stage of the miles we've noticed there's such a  
big thing here in all the major cities that we've 
been you know Bangkok Kuala Lumpur and in Manila  
it's quite obvious that the malls are you know 
like I said a big thing they're so Advanced and  
big and large there's so much in them just stuff 
you don't normally see in Miles where we're from  
like this a little Venice literally in the middle 
of the mall the shop malls in Southeast Asia are  
on another level honestly this one is open air as 
well it's really really nice isn't it so anyway  
airpan is we're going to go and get something to 
eat and then we're going to try getting a gondola  
so we're getting a little bit hungry now 
and we're gonna go and try some foods and  
of course because we're in the Philippines we're 
going to try some Jollibee it's prepared loads  
about what everyone raves on about it and it 
is like the number one field chain here in  
the Philippines so I believe it's like a KFC 
or something like that I'm not too sure but  
we're gonna go check out the menu and see what we 
can get this is the uh the mascot Jollibee maska

and I don't think it's very vegetarian friendly  
it might be they do like little uh poiers or 
something like that yeah like a mango boy or  
something so I might just get one of them and 
have a drink or something like that have you I  
think it might be a little dessert food for you 
yeah yeah predominantly chicken but it looks  
a bit the menu like it's monster chicken and I 
love chicken I must I do and I think I'm gonna  
go for like there's a chip there's chicken there 
there's a spaghetti bolognese I see as well okay  
which is crazy but I think that's the thing 
like to try so I think I'll go for that like  
a piece of chicken and then like a spaghetti it 
is a Mad Mix yeah pasta and chicken we put the  
way they do it's like deep fried chicken so it's 
it's a bit mad but I think I'll go for that yeah
it could be told when we were doing research about 
Philippines Jollibee kept coming up I actually  
talked with a dish I didn't know it was an actual 
chain yeah like a field Channel I thought it was  
a traditional Filipino meal but now it's actually 
like the faster who joined right that was really  
really affordable it was 269 for what we got 
now unfortunately they didn't have to Spaghetti  
bolognes that's what I wanted to try and or the 
Jolly spaghetti it's called so I went for some  
rice chicken and I think it's like a little gravy 
that comes with it and I get a drink with it as  
well and then Keelan got like this little pie and 
yeah 269 in Euro so 163 peso really really good
needed to tell the good people but we're really 
struggling you think we'd be used to it by now  
we've been away for months we're melting it's kind 
of horror every day this is like a little gravy  
oh it smells like yeah probably time to dig in I 
want to just love this all over yeah the rice can  
get some as well what's your expectations of this 
scenes as I'm saying that you see it everywhere  
in the Philippines like even research and all of 
it everywhere it's like Jollibee you have to try  
Jollibee so we're like right we have to try it 
and my expectations are I think it's going to  
be lovey I love chicken and yeah it smells nice 
um chicken and gravy and rice you can't go wrong
you can't go wrong with fried chicken 
honestly it's lovely it's really nice  
the grape is nice as well I'll try a bit of rice
I like it yeah it's really good you can 
get the chicken spicy or just start playing
I'm not gonna lie I'm good I couldn't 
get the Jolly spaghetti yes it would  
have been perfect I was only saying 
to Galen some Jolly spaghetti in  
the Venice of the Philippines 
but I will try it again yeah
all right so I just tried this peach 
mango pie is absolutely incredible  
10 out of 10 for the point is it 
not nice a little bit messy though
it's very rare that on day one we find my 
most favorite field in the Philippines that  
POI was absolutely good it's like 10 out of ten 
honestly as soon as I bit into it I was like wow  
that is amazing so Jollibee we understand oh 
yeah the obsession we'll be having it again  
stay the atmosphere in the in the mall here is uh 
really nice it's it'd be great for kids because  
we're not listen there's a lot of characters 
dressed up around the place yeah and adults
it's more fun in the Philippines and 
more food in the Philippines thank you
the Philippines is maganda thanks lads
thank you
foreign
just leaving the mall now and we're gonna head to 
our next spot and sad news we didn't actually get  
to ride the gondola because he needed four people 
there's only two of us we did ask around a couple  
of people and no one wanted to yeah so yeah if 
you want to if you want to meet us at the Grand  
Venice Mall leave it in the comments because we 
need two more people to do that Gondola road so  
if you're willing to call meet us and do the the 
gondola ride well then let us know in the comments  
all right so we're just about to grab 
a grub and uh we're just happy coming  
across this it's outside the mall so 
it's a fair enough fortune and it says  
toss a coin in for good luck for 2023. so 
we're gonna leave a coin each one peso we  
have to make a wish there we have to 
make a wish and to translate go ahead
what you wish for I can't tell 
you that you know what I wish for  
two more people to come down 
and get on the Gondola with us
so our next stop of the day is the famous BGC so 
BGC is a business district in Manila and we're  
after coming into it and honestly it's like 
stepping into another city it's absolutely  
gorgeous most of the buildings here are actually 
owned by developers and you can really see it  
because the place is absolutely spotless so there 
is a lot of money in this area so it's made up  
of skyscrapers shopping malls cafes restaurants 
basically anything that you need there's also a  
lot of Green Space here so it's nice just to 
walk around to be seen you can rent electric  
scooters and you can also run some bikes as well 
so yeah there's just a lovely atmosphere here yes  
BGC it's actually very very nice this Amanda said 
it's spotless we've never seen a place so clean  
um BGC actually stands for Bonifacio Global City 
and I actually believe the reason it might look  
so new and so pristine is that it was I think 
only built in the early 2000s it was formerly a  
military base 10 out of turned it into something 
really really beautiful also we've noticed the  
streets delay of themselves streets and avenues 
so it's very American very American yeah it is we  
are already roughly in so many different shops so 
I think it's going to be great for shopping yeah  
they're kind of like high-end shops as you can 
imagine in an area like this there's also a lot  
of kind of uh luxurious Apartments I guess where 
they look at them um yeah I'm over here probably  
we're staying in Makati which isn't actually too 
far from here but um I think uh that's probably a  
little bit more kind of affordable area than BGC 
anyway but look how clean this place is that's  
a Shore usually you get rubbish kind of in the 
soils of the parts here there's literally nothing  
on the streets it's absolutely spotless well 
Glenn seriously I know we keep saying that  
and we've seen we always mentioned about with 
CE because I think we really appreciate when  
you see it a city that's nice and clean and 
there's not rubbish being left around nobody  
likes that but this place in particular is 
just as I said it's Immaculate honestly I'd  
say the grounds and all get holes don't know 
anytime just spotless all right so a quick  
stop for a smoothie because it's extremely 
hot honestly for a violent oh my God so this  
place is called Jamba Juice yeah you get 
a little uh they gave me a little card so  
if you get five they stamp each time and then 
you get one free come on over the Philippines  
yeah I'm not too sure actually I went for a 
Caribbean twist and yours is like a strawberry
my gosh that's exactly what I needed 
until some prices they were 220 pesos each
wait we're just waiting for our grab for our next 
stop should be told we could have probably stayed  
a bit longer here than BGC um but we are like I 
said we're not staying too far away so we might  
drop down again over the next couple of days and 
just maybe explore a little bit more I'd say you'd  
probably spend a day here but we've actually got 
some special plan for Sunset so we're going to try  
and make that now we're a little bit behind time 
but um Yes mine is harder to grab there so we're  
gonna try to head over to the other side of the 
city and maybe find a good Sunset spot in Manila
foreign
foreign
yeah for sure yeah we've read up that it's 
supposed to be a really nice place for Sunset and  
we made it we didn't think we would actually be 
honest because the traffic is but it is obviously  
a city and we were in like it was Jordan Rush Hour 
as well and we drove through some crazy parts of  
the city they're completely different to BGC as 
well yeah it's crazy to just like you can just  
take like a 20-minute taxi ride and see so much 
difference in where you were to you know where  
you are going and stuff like that so it was kind 
of an interesting fact it was a bit Safari life  
is the driver was it me hot and heavy with the the 
breaker the accelerator but we're here we drove by  
some really cool like it was Street filled vendors 
and some like the talk talks are really different  
over here as well so obviously we mentioned about 
the jeepneys earlier but there's also these little  
bikes and they're like it's like a cart stuck 
to the side I'm not too sure yeah so another  
different form of like a top took that we've seen 
in Southeast Asia so far but uh anyway yeah we're  
walking along here we read up I think it's like 
two kilometers long and it's lovely I see a ferris  
wheel in the distance yeah yeah but it's nice it's 
by the water as well as you can obviously see yeah  
yeah it's like I said is a bit different 
to what we've seen of Manila so far today
you're walking on I had read up online as 
well it's like it's a man-made Beach but  
um it's not actually sand we're just talking 
about here it's like stones isn't it yeah yeah  
it kind of looks like sand from like from 
the outside but when they're actually on  
them they're like little bits of gravel kind 
of thing you know but yeah I think it's called  
Dolomite uh I read I read up on it a little 
bit um and I think it's something to do but  
like it doesn't affect the water I'm not 
too sure I'm completely wrong on it yeah  
it's lovely there's a few people just chilling 
out yeah it's a nice seems like a nice area for  
people there's a storm and kind of relax and 
enjoy the sunset I guess we'll pick a little  
snack off but the vendors there on your way 
in and just chill out and watch the sunset
okay A bit loud and hectic up here because 
we're over like a moment away we're on the  
uh the Friendship bridge I think it's called It's 
called The American Philippines friendship Bridge  
so basically I'm I don't know if you're aware but 
like the Philippines was actually uh colonized by  
the Americans and the Spanish I'm not exactly 
too sure of the dates and stuff like that but  
um yeah so like we've already seen some of the 
street names for instance are very Spanish so  
that's obviously where the influence comes from 
as well but yeah this bridge is the American  
Philippine friendship bridge that was uh erected a 
few years ago so it obviously brings you from the  
bay across that Motorway that we were just looking 
down on obviously all right so we're currently and  
it took to so we need to get down to the order end 
of the bay and we taught we could walk it to be  
honest we should be reflecting at the ferris wheel 
you could stay in the distance four kilometers  
like an hour walk so we're after shopping and 
I took took her and 250 peso is the price and  
I think that's fair enough as well because there 
is a good bit of traffic to be honest isn't there  
like able to find a wheel in and out of it as 
well which was better than a taxi because we  
would have been probably sitting in there for 
longer and I think he said he couldn't get us  
there in 20 minutes it was great which is great 
so hopefully we can catch the sunset and enjoy a  
nice drink in one of the bars up there thank you 
thank you bye-bye oh we're here that wasn't so bad  
we actually got here really quick my hair has gone 
wild with the wind nailed out and this is like an  
amusement park I think he said I'm not too sure 
we just thought we could see a virus available  
we're gonna obviously take a walk in then and 
again it's by the bay so it should be nice
so we made it on for the sunset as 
well I have to say this part of the  
bay is beautiful we were at the wrong part earlier
I think this is the popular part to come 
to it's like full of carnival rides it's  
killed there's like a lot of people just 
chilling it's like a little grass area in  
the middle of it there as well it's lovely 
isn't it yes yes really nice so yeah as you  
can see behind me it's absolutely packed 
with people very popular spot yeah busy  
it really is we're a little bit hungry now so 
we're just looking at Mercy smell in the field  
there's so many field vendors so yeah it's 
great actually to have their options here
I think this is the walk as well that is a two 
kilometer walk I think I might got that wrong  
earlier but um because there's a pathway and 
like that it looks like a stretches for for  
a while anyway yeah so but uh yeah it's a kill 
spot if you're in Manila to come and check it out  
so our first sunset in the Philippines absolutely 
beautiful and I'm sure we'll have many more yes I  
was gonna say of course the many hopefully worth 
of many yeah sunsets are already sort of the world  
are just in Asia in general even India enough 
just absolutely on another level they really are  
right so we finally made it to the ferris wheel  
oh it seemed like you were so close but we were 
actually really far away yeah when you're down  
there looking at it you think it's only just on 
the road yeah it's four kilometers away this just  
goes on and on and on there's loads of different 
fun rides and carnival rides in that year to get  
on as well the ferris wheel would be cool I would 
love to get on it I don't know if we will know I  
think we're looking forward to having a drink 
now we'll just start relaxing it's been like a  
hectic day yeah so I think it's well deserved it 
at some point we will get on it it's really cool
foreign
it's literally like a painting what 
a way to end our first day in Manila
okay so we are back on our balcony here we'll 
give you a tour um in this video we might do  
another video on the include that image as well 
we're staying in Makati so I'm not too sure you  
might be able to see behind me we'll hold you up 
around like the 26th floor and we have a lovely  
view of the city so one thing that was missing 
from today's video was we never stopped for a  
beer and if you know me and Keelan we do like 
to try a local beer when we get to a new place  
so we picked up these berries we think they're a 
Filipino where you think so yeah they're called  
red horse beer extra strong so um their eggs 
are cold as well the main thing but we think of  
Filipinos beer we're not too sure but we're going 
to try it anyway and see what it's like cheers
it's quite nice it's refreshing it's quite nice 
what's needed like I said it's really really  
cold which we are not when we're walking around 
Manila in the Philippines it's really really high  
so this is definitely um needed after a brilliant 
day exploring honestly our first impressions of  
the city we love it we had a great day honestly 
try to give a different mixture I suppose and  
of different things and we've so much more 
to obviously see and do as well which we'll  
be doing over the next few days yeah so we're 
going to be in Manila for another few days so  
we're going to shoot under a couple of Vlogs and 
just to see all the things that we didn't see in  
today's video but I think it's about to say First 
Impressions really impressive we really like the  
city also actually let us know if there's some 
things that we should visit oh yeah in the city  
as well if you are a local and you're watching 
do let us know we have a couple of ideas but  
um yeah we're always open for for other ideas 
exactly especially from people who are from  
Manila and not just Manila the Philippines in 
general because we will be here for for a little  
while so if there's any place or anything that 
you think that we should do especially um season  
country and we'd really appreciate you just let us 
know in the comments below fields to try as well  
we always love to try local Fields yeah like 
I said I always love getting recommendations  
absolutely yeah like I said earlier on the blog 
I thought Jollibee was an actual Filipino dish  
I didn't know it was a chain so we're a little 
bit Rusty when it comes to local food so again  
if you do know one thing to be you know some that 
we should try yeah but for now we're going to wrap
