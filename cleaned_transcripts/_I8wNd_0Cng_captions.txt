Sacramento is home to a
thriving Filipino community,
yet some say there's still a
crucial resource that's missing.
1 nonprofit is trying to get a
Filipino Community Center to the city.
The Filipino community of Sacramento
and Vicinity has held fundraisers
for years to try to raise the
money needed to build this center.
Once built, it would provide
language and cooking classes.
It will also house a museum and
library showcasing Filipino history.
Some say that center would bring
a greater sense of community.
I mean, what do we do for?
To feel connected. We join
clubs, we join.
You know, we go to church.
There's so many ways that we want to
feel like we're part of something.
So I know for if we have this center,
it'll just serve our community
in a way where it's like
it goes into our our past,
our present and our future. The
nonprofits largest annual fundraising event,
the Mrs Philippines popularity contest,
is happening right now.
