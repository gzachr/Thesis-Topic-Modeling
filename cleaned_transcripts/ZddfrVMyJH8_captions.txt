what's up guys we are here right now in
Davao City and you are looking at me
here in Santa Ana Wharf
Santa Ana Wharf is where the area to get
ferry to get to tally code and faculty
and Island again this is Santa Ana work
with in Davao City how to get here you
can take a jeepney or you can just take
a taxi with from your hotel and you can
get to Santa Ana warf let's go to
Talikud and Kaputi-an Island
don't be alarmed of the militaries
around davao city because this is just
precautions  from the president
so to go to a Talikud island or kaputi-an 
you have to get the ferry from Santa Ana
wash and how to get to Santa Ana warf is
you can inform your taxi that you'll
want to go to the Talikud or Kaputi-an
and by ferry every 20 minutes or half an
hour or so there are fairies that going
to the island
you will purchase your ticket during the
entrance here in Santa Ana Wharf
the ferries pretty much spacious nothing
to worry they are not shaking like a
smaller boat coming to the island is
wonderful mostly this is where the local
goes and they will bring some food even
water they will bring because in the
island there are the food and water are
pretty much expensive and basically it
is really suitable if you are looking
for a comfort stay, it may not be
possible in this Kaputi-an or Talikud  island because there are only small
cottages in this area
also possible to have your own boat
private boat you could also pay a rent
somewhere in Davao City
it is also possible that you just get
into the ferry and it will take you
about one and a half hour traveling time
Welcome to Isla Rita
it's a good idea to stay here overnight
couple nights and you can bring your
camping gear because you are allowed to
camp here by the way however it is also
possible to stay to those cottages in
this island and do not forget there are
limited food in this area when I came
here so it is always advisable that if
possible you brainer
little fish and it is so wonderful so
nature
