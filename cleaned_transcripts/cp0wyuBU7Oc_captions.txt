Manila now today we have come to the Quiapo market  
area again in Hunt of some food some street 
food some Filipino food some absolute classics  
now the first spot we're heading to is I 
think we're going to start the day off with  
some halo halo for breakfast and absolute like 
quintessential Filipino dessert exactly dessert  
for breakfast we're doing it right here so I think 
there's a really good spot around here which we'll  
try and find I'll see you when we get there really 
busy today in the market really colorful so yeah  
we'll find it let's have a look ah you have you 
have Halo Halo okay how much is one one big one  
yeah can we get two please with everything okay 
thank you all right so this is the spot we're  
coming to another place I think it's gone famous 
so usually it's massive cues Jolli dadas Eatery  
we also sell palabok but you if you stay soon 
we're going to eat that in a different Manila  
video somewhere else now we're just in a little 
local food court here actually just down a bit of  
a Backstreet look at the street just like a small 
little Street it looks uh got all the trikes here  
and yeah we're gonna try 
halo halo for the first time
so what I was saying this place usually 
has a massive que right now what is it  
Tuesday after 10 in the morning there's 
no one here no Queue at all so let's see
oh are they the police is that is that 
the sign the police yeah so you can see  
we've got men in uniform here so that 
is usually how you know your spot is  
good when you've got police or other 
like Council government workers here
very first one ever it's massive 
and breakfast not the best breakfast  
is ever yeah you cannot dessert for 
breakfast I don't care it looks beautiful
all right so yeah our very first halo halo 
which I think means mix or something else  
in Tagalog how it's absolutely stuck so it's 
going to be hard to mix it up isn't it oh this  
is absolute Filipino classic I believe it's 
everyone loves this stuff let's just have  
a look what's in there we've got all kinds of 
stuff so we've got Ube ice cream is it or does  
Ube we have got some red balls some rice crispy 
looking like stuff just different colored jellies  
to be honest I don't know what's in here 
but I've got some flan in there as well  
to like leche flan so yeah it's gonna be 
hard to mix up wood oh God and then shaved  
ice obviously everything's a boba shaved ice but 
how do we mix it in t's in such a it's so full
this is tough we're back in slowly in 20 minutes 
no you can't you can't mix it up I'm just gonna  
try out Ube on its own actually Ube looks really 
interesting yeah so that's cool oh it's so sweet
oh yeah you can't mix it up [Music] foreign
really refreshing yeah
let's try something it's all melting it's 
obviously it's so hot as what is it like  
30 to 35 degrees or something let's get 
to look at that show you this it's all  
kinds of stuff here all right let's try and 
oh what's that jackfruit in there as well
[Music]
so cold
you know what it's not overly sweet
I thought it was going to be extremely 
sweet but look at all the goodness in there
I thought it was going to be 
extremely sweet but it's actually not
oh god
so many mental ingredients in there I don't 
even know what I'm eating every spoonful [Music]
yeah there's a very sweet banana in 
there as well I just got in that bite
it's all kinds in there I think there's jackfruit 
in there as well keep getting really sweet cheers
really sweet nice job bro
so there's also Jackfruit now my favorite fruit 
one of my favorite fruits in the world and look  
what we're eating is well cool actually 
you could just sit there and people watch  
because there's so much going on obviously 
we're like we're pretty much in the market
so many people around we've got a man in here 
now selling flip-flops in the restaurant [Music]  
I think you're just walking around with a big bag  
just flogging them to people 
yeah I think she's having it
she's trying them on anywhere all right 
I think we'll finish these now and then  
head into actual Quiapo market and try 
and get some other Foods it's a classic  
Filipino foods Balut it's probably on the 
menu I don't know what else we'll find out
there we go Now give me quick honest opinion 
on the hello hello I actually think I will  
prefer it a little bit sweeter and the ice 
like more finely ground because in other  
countries they use a special machine to make 
it like dust you'll see that i had to crunch  
through it thank you very much thank you 
thank you it was still very good though  
so yeah we'll head into the market but it's just 
a coffee shop here we might check out because  
it's so interesting types of coffee oh look 
peach coffee I think they've also got oh  
it smells good Filipino coffee this is Sagada 
Arabica I'm guessing that's from northern Luzon  
so we'll have a look at it and maybe grab some 
up for the rest of our trip because if everyone  
drinks like instant coffee and we don't drink 
that so what is best this is this is Filipino yes
is this the best premium this one's the premium
Mindanao ah so this is from Southern Philippines 
which one should we get should we get the sagada  
oh because we're gonna go to Davao yeah yeah 
we'll take 250 of this one please I got it  
yes please can you grant 
can you grind It For filter
155 pesos for 250 grams
there we go it smells well good in here now it's 
not so good I think it's a dark one it smells so  
good how does that smell each they are now 
amazing it smells kind of like chocolate  
yeah I was thinking though it got such a big 
bag of coffee really yeah look at him oh God  
yeah usually we just buy that one to grams but 
massive it's very big but this is 250. oh wow  
yeah we must usually only buy that 
thank you very much do you have change
