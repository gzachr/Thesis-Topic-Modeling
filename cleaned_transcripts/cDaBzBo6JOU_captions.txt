There are more than 7000 islands in the Philippines
and this is the beautiful island of Palawan.
Think clear blue water, sandy beaches,
and views that look like paradise.
This video is all about the foods I ate in El Nido,
a small town at the north end of Palawan.
We were under deadline while in El Nido
and spent a lot of time just working in our Airbnb -
that's just one of the realities of travelling like we do.
That means we pretty much ate
whatever was really close by and fast
so that we could get back to work.
We’re having a little pizza party here
and I realize that there’s nothing Filipino about this
except for the fact that we’re in The Philippines.
Dinner tonight consists of Hawaiian pizza,
Thai bubble milk tea
and Taiwanese winter melon bubble tea
and you know what?
Sometimes you just need a little slice of home.
This pizza was yummy and we were able to
order it ahead and just pick it up
so it was really quick
and we had this more than once.
Who else loves Hawaiian pizza?
Fun fact by the way: Hawaiian pizza
was actually created in Canada!
Comment down below with your favourite kind of pizza.
Our obsession with bubble tea began in Taiwan
so we couldn't resist getting more
at this cute little stand.
Marc clearly had a little trouble
with the paper straw though!
Doesn’t look like you’re having
much luck with that paper straw.
No luck with the tapioca.
Get me a spoon!
We’ll have to excavate.
If you're new to our channel you might not know
that we love Mexico and Mexican food
so it was a no brainer to try out
this Mexican place in El Nido.
We cooled down with pop in glass bottles,
which somehow always tastes the best
and had cheese quesadillas
and chicken burrito bowls.
One of our favourite lunches in El Nido
were chicken wraps.
We found this cheap and cheerful place
really close to our Airbnb
and it was perfect to just whip over
and get one to go.
Highly recommend this place
if you're looking for a quick and easy meal.
Found this little falafel place
and ordered a couple chicken wraps,
which look like that.
And they look very good, full of garlic
and tzaziki sauce.
Smells good.
So insanely garlicky, oh my god!
I can smell the garlic from here.
That’s crazy!
Everyone will know what we had for lunch.
Mmhmm.
The whole town.
You can probably smell it
right through the TV there.
They also have a breakfast deal
where you get an omelette wrap and coffee
that we never tried but looked good.
Sometimes only one of us could afford the time
to go out to pick up the food
while the other one stayed.
Hello!
I’m so happy to see you!
Coffee!
Thank you!
And chicken wraps.
Yes!
As you can imagine when working under deadline,
the place we frequented the most
in El Nido was the coffee shop!
This cafe called Kopi Bake
was a two minute walk away
and served up really nice coffee.
The fact that we could wait for them
in some air conditioning
and play with their super cute dog
was a definite bonus.
Hello!
I’m in love.
I loved walking back to the Airbnb along the main road
sipping my flat white and feeling very, very lucky.
We were just strolling along the main street
here in El Nido and we came across Kopi Bake.
Which has delicious coffees.
This was a flat white, which we could not resist
because we love them from our time in Australia.
And they also had a dog there named Batman,
which is a Bichon Shih Tzu.
So cute and reminded me of my dog growing up.
So if you need caffeine or pet therapy,
definitely hit that place on the main street.
Tell Batman we say hi.
Across the street from the cafe there's also
a bakery we went to for a quick breakfast
before our island hopping tour.
They have a variety of baked goods
but we went for classic comfort food:
banana bread.
One of my personal favourites.
Breakfast in a bag.
Good?
Can I just have a piece?
Maybe one was enough.
It’s really filling already actually.
It’s probably the heat.
If you haven't seen the video yet
where we go out on the boat for the day
and tour around different islands and snorkel…
Oh my god, we’re on the wrong boat!
…I’ll link it for you along with
more videos from the Philippines,
like where we visit with family in Cebu.
I hope you enjoyed this video.
Give it a like, if you did,
and remember to subscribe  for lots more
travel adventures with Marc and I.
Thanks for watching!
