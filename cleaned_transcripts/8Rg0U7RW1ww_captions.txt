uh okay so this video I'm gonna talk about
the NBI what my experience was getting it
NBI is a requirement for your 13-day Visa
so if you plan to get married here in the
Philippines this is uh something that you
need to obtain um to get your 13A Visa after
you're married of course so um I'm going to
talk about what I did I went to the Pollock
city which um it's a city near where I live
um well it's actually about an hour um I went
there and um once you arrive uh once you go
and apply for it you have to have a polo shirt
you have to have jeans and you have to have
shoes casual shoes or wear shoes you know
you can't have slippers you can't have muscle
shirt like this uh you can't wear shorts you
have to have jeans uh so I got there and then
um they will where did I put the receipt they
will send you to a designated area where you're
gonna go and pay so I went there and what
they do they put all your information um and
then uh it's like a form the lady puts it
in you know um where you're born where you're
from and all that so I told them I need uh
my MBI for a foreigner because of my 13-day
Visa requirement so um I went there and they
filled out the form and that's it I paid uh
let me see right here 235 pesos here's the
receipt I'm gonna put it right here for a
little bit that way I can see it more clear
and she wrote the number the phone number
in the back um the number for the office so
I can call um once I went uh there once I
went to the little place where they did the
whole stuff I just I crossed the street and
I walked in the NBI and they told me okay
um sit down and then she asked for my ACR
card and she asked for my passport so you
need those two things whenever you go and
acquire your your MBI um so I did all that
and as soon as I did all that she um got my
she got my hands and then she got Fingerprints
of all all my fingers so they do that and
then they they like put it in a paper there's
a paper like this and then they're like uh
okay let's turn this and that so it probably
took about 30 minutes the whole procedure
where the whole process I mean 30 to maybe
40 minutes and once I did that they told me
it's going to be three to four weeks so on
the NBI it says when I went and I did it and
then there's a printout on the printout it
says the day that it got printed so it took
a it took roughly three weeks I went
um I went on December 2nd and I went to go
pick it up December 23.
and right here on the top is actually valid
until December 2023.
the second so that means the NBI is good for
up to a year
um so I did it and then I went to go pick
it up and whenever you pick it up you don't
have to worry about you know going in a polo
shirt and all that you know I just went with
you know well not one like this but I had
like a casual shirt you know I had I still
have shoes when I go to a city I wear shoes
but I didn't have jeans uh whenever you pick
it up you don't have to wear all that so that
was it um now if you're a Filipino and you
want to get your NBI the NBI you can get it
within the same day all you need is an ID
and uh you can you can call to your local
and you can ask them what kind of ID can you
use um I did ask them in case I needed to
get one for my wife but I didn't it turns
out I don't um so that's how I got my MBI
um that's it 235 pistols that's one that's
one of the cheapest requirements that I had
to I had to spend money on um I am gonna do
a video a little more uh of the requirements
for the 13A Visa so if you're gonna get married
um and get a 13 a Visa then be on the lookout
for the video I'm also going to do a video
on the cinema the cinema is the requirement
that you need um for marriage to get married
I also have a video link of legal capacity
to Contract Marriage which is the fit a bit
and um that's somewhere in the videos you
can you can see it there right away um I'll
try to put I'll try to put that link in the
comments that way you can see it but that's
it I hope you know this helps if you need
