[Music] our family of fives on a quest to
experience 110 distinct cultures across all
seven continents by the summer of 2025.
we're about two-thirds of the way through
our 21 Day Tour of Southeast Asia and so far
we've experienced the beautiful city of Singapore
the world's oldest Chinatown in Manila the
tribal lagoons of coron and the resort heavy
island of Boracay today we're packing up and
heading Southeast to experience the natural
wonders of Bohol and to find out why this
destination is one of the most popular in
the Philippines but once again getting there
means first flying back up to Manila and then
catching the connecting flight back down to
the island well we're sad to leave such a
paradise as Boracay we are leaving with full
bellies I have to mention the brunches and the
breakfasts in Philippines out does the U.S
brunches that we've had every place we stayed
at that has a brunch is phenomenal amazing
friends and I love love this I think it's
called a Penang tart and it's so so delicious
I've had one every day so if you know more
about these please tell me and what is it
with green food I'm also really into this
it's b-i-k-o such subtle flavors and the cool
texture I love it again you know more about
that please let me know so I can learn but
we're gonna finish up breakfast here we're
gonna finish up breakfast here and head to
the airport because we're going from one paradise
to another one
those drummers are so nice so excited they
stand there all day in this heat and play
those drums with big smiles on their faces
it's a great way to leave on a happy note
and I'm now I'm looking forward to seeing
I mean this is stunning beaches and water
I can't wait to see what Bohol has to offer
thank you thank you
sir thank you Planes Trains and Automobiles
always quite a track
nomadic content creator Erin's pretty much
editing no matter where we are in the world
and Brooklyn and Colt are pretty much always
gaming
thank you this is about an hour flight back
to Manila [Music]
I spent that entire flight thinking we were
going into Bohol and it wasn't until kind
of our Final Approach when I was like this
doesn't look right at all that I was like
Ah that's right we're still going into Manila
one flight down now I think we have this little
rigmarole where we go outside of the airport
and then we have to go back through security
like two times to get to our new gate but
we don't have to pick up our luggage I feel
like we're on airplanes just as much as we
are on each island we just arrived in Panglao
so it's just a short ride away I think to
the resort we're staying at
the Resort is picking us up they're taking
care of the transportation no additional fee
it's included with the room all the kids are
walking home from school because school just
let out to make you miss an in-person School
Coot I've always missed in-person school but
I don't want to go back
 thanks Dad this is a nature Resort and
we have a little guideline here for all of
the animals critters that are going to visit
us house lizards big or small may also pay
you some visits Colt is gonna love that he's
an animal lover he loves it they all know
that yes everybody knows wow [Music] oh I
love it wow this is our bathroom and this
is our view this is awesome I look outdoor
shower we were just talking about this how
much we all love outdoor showers oh my God
that's hilarious it only seems like an outdoor
shower to everybody who's outside watching
you I have not had a single bite to eat since
breakfast this morning and babe I don't think
you have either right we're starving so let's
grab some dinner it's gonna be hard to peel
Colt away after good morning we woke up to
sunny sunny skies we're gonna go get some
breakfast and then we're off on our first
Bohol adventure and breakfast is included the
name Bohol comes from the name of a tree that
once flourished here on the island and unlike
the island that we just came from the Bohol
is actually one of the larger ones in the
Philippines it's the 10th largest island and
it's actually one main bigger island with
75 minor surrounding islands and we flew into 
and are staying on one of those for this trip
it's called Panglao and it is just off of
the southwestern tip of the main island and
you can access it via one of two bridges that
span the causeway and that's probably how
we're going to get into the main island today
for our adventure with our guide so cool tell
everyone what you got last night last night
this entire trip I've been trying to catch
a Tokyo gecko because we've been seeing them
all throughout the trip and last night I just
caught one I thought that you finally did
it [Music] did it wow did I really just catch
a toky gecko or am I dreaming because it really
feels like I'm dreaming because this is my
dream that's what this is my dream but it
feels like I'm dreaming congratulations thank
you he was so excited he said he was shaking
I mean he's been looking for this tokey gecko
for a few different Islands we've been on
and this is the first time we've caught it
we've gone out at night we've been searching
for tokey geckos but uh first success I love
how every island we're going to and have been
to is so different but we're really looking
forward to what Bohol has to offer the island
that we're on right now Panglao is widely
considered one of the top 10 dive sites in
the world but since Reagan and I are the only
currently certified scuba divers in the family
and she's not here because she's at in-person
school we're not going to be diving on this
particular trip probably do some snorkeling
but the main island is really known more than
anything for two primary things and that's
what we're about to see we're going to the
Chocolate Hills and we're gonna see Tarsiers
Philippine Tarsiers they are one of the world's
smallest primates and we just met our guide
Agnes and our driver Sami we're on our way
to the heart of Bohol this is the place
that we are going to so Agnes is just telling
us that the name Panglao means lonely and
that refers to a long time ago when there
were very few people on this island and
delicious mangoes have been my favorite favorite
fruit I've had since we've been in the Philippines
and it was particularly good this morning
we're driving through the man-made Forest
they call it that because in the 50s the Boy
Scouts and Girl Scouts they planted these
seeds to grow the trees and the reason they
wanted to do that was because it helps prevent
the mudslides and the landslides and protects
this area the trees are Philippines and one
of the protected forests we're here at the
tertiary Conservation Center what first year
tarsiers this is really difficult for me I'm
nervous about Yelling to the camera because
they get stressed out really easily and noise
is one of their one of their two biggest stressors
this is how big a baby tarsier is the size
of a thumb even the full grown ones are like
this big
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
thank you here's another one so as cute as
they are it's actually kind of sad because
these animals have been around for about 45
million years but now thanks largely to humans
they're endangered and they're expected and
on track to go extinct by the year 2040 and
that's primarily because of poaching and deforestation
but you notice their eyes are wide open and
their eyeballs don't move because they can't
move their eyes so they can move their heads
back and forth 180 degrees in any direction
and that's how they look around but there
are only about five to ten thousand of these
left in the wild anywhere in the world but
they get so easily stressed so easily frightened
and one of the things they do when they're
stressed is they bang their heads on the trees
and if you touch them they will get stressed
out enough that they will commit suicide by
banging their heads on the trees though Brooklyn
found another one
so sensitive [Music]
there's a rooster they're nocturnal so they're
sleeping right now I'm trying not to wake
them up Tarsiers are insectivores so they
eat a lot of butterflies and caterpillars
and any other bugs that they can find around
here believe it or not but that's a big one
wow so I can finally speak up a little bit
because we're much farther away from them
but what an incredible experience and I feel
so grateful that these kids get to see them
in real life instead of reading about them
in books or seeing them in captivity I don't
even think we can do that in the U.S I can't
imagine they could travel and at the same
time I think that's the first endangered species
I've ever seen in the wild and it really shows
you how fragile this planet is and how cruel
humans can be in a lot of instances it's very
sad that after millions of years it may be
coming to an end soon because of us but we're
off to the next place now which is another
Bohol trademark it's just a 15-minute
drive to get there their principal export
here is rice and there are all of these people
who are drying rice on the side of the road
I want to see what it's like they're going
to show us how they are missed come here pumpkin
quick quick says you always want to eat rice
you should see how where it comes from been
eating rice all these years and have never
really understood how it's harvested so didn't
want to miss this chance to see good morning
how are you thank you
you want to try yes yeah yeah sure okay can
you show me first yeah yeah oh okay yeah yeah
yeah be careful be careful okay okay yeah
[Music] yeah
sure
come here buddy
okay I'll help you and grab that and then
below
it just pulls right off it's like uh it's
like pulling little buds or leaves right off
of it can I eat it
[Laughter]
all right so you gotta find one that I can
peel oh yeah uh yeah okay oh yeah yeah here's
a green one are the green ones better no no
no the brown yellow one yeah okay the brown
one yeah all right and then yeah like kind
of snap it yeah peel first and I feel this
well yeah yeah no no no it's color red inside
yeah right here not white yeah [Music] I'm
full you have to think about this every time
you eat every grain of rice that's awesome
that's the coolest experience of the day thank
you so much for showing us how this process works it
really puts it in perspective when you see
where your food really comes from such a fun
teacher it's so cool so that was right at
the base of the Chocolate Hills and we're
heading up high and we're gonna do some stuff
up there welcome to the Chocolate Hills arguably
Bohol's biggest attraction there are about
1 776 easy to remember for us Americans because
it's the year of our independence of these
Limestone Hills scattered around Bohol
they were created by volcanic upheavals millions
of years ago and then smoothed over by water
erosion and now they're covered in grass that
turns brown just a certain time of year which
would be April and May here and that makes
it a big contrast with all of the Green from
everything else Lush around it so they came
up with the name Chocolate Hills because that's
what they look like but don't eat them because
they're not actually chocolate first thing
we gotta do is climb 200 steps to get to the
top of that chocolate Hill how do you feel
about that Brooklyn climbing 200 stairs to
the top of this hill like I'm gonna die well
for a kiddo who's not excited about climbing
200 steps Brooklyn sure is killing it out
in the lead I said the wrong words
[Music] 200 steps have nothing on the management
I hope that just means anywhere on these stairs
we love that rule [Music] I've reached 
the top [Music] okay now it's time to go down
there's always that question of whether it's
harder to come up or go down Works different
muscles going down is so much easier as long
as you don't trip stunning views so now we're
back in the garden we're just gonna have about
45 minute drive to where we're going for lunch
and that's its own little fun adventure too
and we have to have our masks again because
we're stepping on to a Riverboat dining experience
this is me at a buffet a little bit of everything
ooh coffee jelly I have to have some of that
I'm loaded up amazing she's got live music
here and everything it's such a cool little
atmosphere I'm looking at rice in a whole
new way now but this chicken curry is so so
good and now we're underway we've got another
boat coming our way it seems like it's a pretty
popular thing to do around here we saw a bunch
of different stations for different boat dinner
dining cruises but I might be biased this
one is the best [Music] it's nice
these are local songs and local dances and
the boat just kind of stopped up along here
and they let the drawbridge down so people
can go on and off and Brooklyn's gonna go
and dance [Music] it was so cool what she
did I'm so glad that she did that and it's
a great way to immerse yourself in a new culture
but we are turning around we're going back
and we're probably going to disembark pretty
soon I feel like I'm gonna cry because I have
so much gratitude it was such a cool day and
I I'm blown away every time we go to a new
destination in the Philippines how mind-blowing
eye-opening uh experience it's been so today
is another day just like that and we have
more to go we are not done yet taking a quick
detour to check out one of the largest churches
in Bohol this one is Lubbock church and it
was actually built originally in 1609 so just
over 400 years old but it was actually destroyed
in the 2012 earthquake here was a 7.2 magnitude
that destroyed a lot of the historic churches
around here they ended up rebuilding it so
what you see behind me now is actually pretty
new although it hasn't gone without issues
since then last December a typhoon came through
and it Rose the sea levels here so high that
you can actually see all the way up this wall
and the discoloration how high that water
went the water was literally at roof level
for a lot of the homes around here we're going
on more Adventures tomorrow in Bohol and then
we have more destinations in the Philippines
so please subscribe follow us along we love
you with each new community and culture we
encounter in our world travels we look for
ways to leave it better than we found it sometimes
that can be as simple as picking up trash
on a local Beach or buying goods from locals
without bartering for a lower price other
times we roll up our sleeves and help serve
those in need like this time but when some
of our viewers started sending a super thanks
money through YouTube this month we were touched
and we were inspired to pass that money right
back to the communities that are featured
in our content as our Channel grows these
gifts could start to have a real impact on
the vibrant people they support for this episode
you can give to a great Philippines charity
just by clicking the thanks button below and
making your gift 100 of our proceeds will
go directly to the charity to learn more about
that charity and this brand new program of
ours go to followabc.com give and thank you
