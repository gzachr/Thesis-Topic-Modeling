[Idol Truck / Approximately 20 K-PRODUCTs]
[A special guest here at Idol Truck!]
[Wow!]
[The members definitely look happier]
[This customer has lots of cash!]
[You can use this to massage your head]
[Cool / I'll take it]
[Really?]
[Who is this guest?]
[Second day at the Philippines / Fresh morning weather]
[Dara, just as fresh as the weather, is here]
[Where is Dara heading to so early in the morning?]
[The hotel breakfast buffet!]
[It's very wide and roomy inside]
[There is a variety of food]
[at the Hotel Seoul Restaurant]
[Dara / Entering]
Good morning.
[Confirmed her reservation]
[Where is everyone else...]
Oh, hi!
[Did someone come before Dara?]
I see we have seats.
[Jinwoo was the first to arrive]
Is anyone sitting here?
[Got the seat at the edge]
Oh, there's miyeok-guk here?
[DinDin and Aron arrived as well]
[Moving / Slowly]
[We're hungry]
[Saying hello with a bright smile]
I'm so tired...
[The aftermath of yesterday's work]
[Elegantly getting some soup]
[DinDin and JONGHYEON are seated too!]
[Like that, everyone got breakfast]
[Time / For Breakfast]
[Eating without words because they're all tired]
[We can see the fatigue on their faces]
[Breaking the silence]
[Usually doesn't eat breakfast / Eating to survive]
I don't eat breakfast either...
I choose sleep over food.
[Fighting, JONGHYEON]
[Me?]
[Starting the morning with some laughs / Thanks to our maknae potentially working more]
He says he's going to do all the work.
[Just kidding]
[Giving up]
I'll do everything.
[Stare]
[It's so fun teasing the maknae]
[Still / The first day went better than expected]
[True, true]
We really have to succeed today.
Oh, selling the machine?
I'll leave it to you.
Rock, paper, scissors? I'll win every round.
[What is everyone talking about?]
[On the first day / After business was closed for the day]
[Most items were all sold out]
[Big pile]
[Except for the machine / That was much more expensive than the rest]
Tomorrow, let's play rock, paper, scissors
and tell the customer we'll ignore a zero if they win
and sell it at its original price if we win.
[They're planning to win everything and sell it at the original price]
[Will that be possible?]
[WATSON and COMPANY POCUS / A mental wellness device for deep and healthy sleep]
[It is a little overpriced...]
JONGHYEON, try that...
[Teaching him a 'high-level' skill]
[Challenge the guests?]
[If they lie and say they're going to do scissors]
[and win with paper, that is just mean]
[JONGHYEON is pretty quick to read the room]
[This is going / to be fun]
Let's not do that at first
[but if nobody wants it, then they'll play the game]
Don't you end up with a certain anxiety?
[Idol Truck Aftereffect / It feels anxious if they can't sell everything]
[Agreed]
[Breakfast is almost over]
[These guys are done eating]
[Dara is going to enjoy some bread and dessert]
But if you're still sitting, how can we...
[So funny]
[A nice Dara is taking care of the others]
[After breakfast, everyone's going to get ready for work]
[The weather is suddenly getting bad again]
[Too much uncertainty to work outside]
[They decided to do business inside]
[Peeking]
We should put on stickers now.
[Idol Truck's official side job START]
[Thankfully / There's not a lot for today]
[Let's put on stickers]
[While everyone is quietly working...]
We really have to sell that massager today.
[Talking about cheating again...]
[If the customer wins, they decided to erase a zero]
If we don't do that, nobody's going to buy it.
That's true...
[In Philippine currency / It's about 350,000 won / So 15,000 pesos]
I bet you nobody carries around 15,000 pesos in cash.
If nobody has cash, we have to get my Queen friend here.
[Who is this Queen?]
[When they first got to the Philippines]
[Planning to force sales / Dara said she could get her friend to come]

[Feels the aura]
[If we recommend the massager to Vice Ganda...]
[what will happen?]

wait, we decided to wear that, right?
[They decided to wear traditional Filipino clothes today]
Let's go, then!
[Off to work / for the second day]
[The second location is very spacious]
[The K-PRODUCTs look very good on display!]
[Everything is here!]
[Let us work to sell everything today!]
[Time to begin the second day of business]
I'm nervous all of a sudden...
I'm more nervous because the setup is more legit.
[Overcoming nervousness by reading product descriptions]
[Idol Truck will begin now]

[But this local is looking for soju]
[A real review by a Korean]
[Good thing he's honest]

This seaweed isn't as popular as we thought, right?
