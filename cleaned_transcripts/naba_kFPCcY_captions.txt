which ingredients do i always have in
the kitchen when i make filipino food or
any food
the first one is my go-to secret sauce
that i add to almost
any savory dish i make fish sauce
there's lots of different types and some
are saltier or better quality than
others
i just use whatever i got yes fish sauce
smells super strong but i only add a
little bit to my dishes
also i don't just throw it in at the end
i let it simmer in the dish until it
cooks down
by the time the dish is ready nobody can
tell there's fish sauce in there
if i have a hard time giving the dish a
good flavor i turn a fish sauce to help
me out
i put it in pansit which is a popular
filipino noodle dish aroscada which is a
delicious filipino rice porridge
it's similar to kanji or juk and my
lumpiat doesn't taste as flavorful
without fish sauce i always gotta put
it in there and even spaghetti when i
saw an article saying david chang puts
fish sauce in spaghetti i was so happy
it really brings a depth of flavor to
the spaghetti that you can't quite put
your finger on
so yeah grab a bottle of fish sauce to
level up the flavors in your next meal
