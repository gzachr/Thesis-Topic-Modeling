- My mouth is burning.
Hi, I'm Beryl.
And it's been a while since I
did an instant noodle video.
It's also been a while since
Osh has been in a video.
Hello.
It's been a while since I
did an instant noodle video.
So, I felt like it was time,
I went through the comments
and I picked three recipes
from three countries to try.
Let's go.
So, we're starting out
with a noodle sandwich
from the Philippines.
I'm starting by toasting my bread
and I'm using these Chow Mein noodles.
I couldn't find the noodles
that were in the post.
So, I just have to go with
what seemed the closest.
Here we are, it is me struggling,
per usual, with the pot,
can't catch a break.
Adding the water
and I had to break up the noodles,
they didn't fit for
some reason in this pot,
even though most of them do.
Mm, they're snug though,
snug as a bug in a rug.
Does anyone else know that phrase?
Noodles are looking good.
I'm adding the spice packets
and mixing it up.
And,
we have a spill.
Congratulations.
Noodles are done.
I am frying up an egg.
I love this pan.
The yolk broke, oh well.
Bread is ready and I'm going to assemble.
We've got the bread on the bottom
some noodles and a stray noodle,
get out of there.
Top it with my fried egg and cover it.
And for everyone who loves
a good cross section,
dang, look at that.
Noodle sandwich.
Okay, so this first
one is the street food,
Pancit Canton sandwich.
I could not find that
brand of instant noodle.
So, I looked for a similar
style and you know,
that's what we're working with.
Oh yeah.
I'm very, very into this.
I can only speak to how
these noodles taste,
but they taste really good.
Definitely a carb bomb,
but it's a carb bomb
that you'd want.
You know, the noodles have enough flavor
that it doesn't just feel
like so much dough and
bread in your mouth.
The egg is a nice touch, I recommend it.
I feel like the idea of a noodle sandwich
is probably a bit taboo sounding.
Like, people would probably say,
why do you need the bread?
You already have the noodles.
And to that, I say,
get out of my business.
I'm contemplating if I want
some more of this other half,
because I do have two
other noodle dishes to try.
Rajat, do you want the rest of this?
- [Rajat] Yeah.
- I've saved half for
you minus one tiny bite.
- [Rajat] I could add some hot sauce.
- All Right.
So, this submission is from Rwanda.
And, I don't get many
submissions from there.
So, I was definitely
happy to see this one.
I am using the Indomie
hot and spicy noodles.
It's cool how these noodles
are found all around the world,
you know.
So, I'm going to start by
cutting up this spicy sausage
and I'm going to cook it in a pan
and I'm using my wooden spoon.
And if you guys think I
only have one of these,
you're wrong, I have like 20.
We're gonna cook the noodles, you know
same old, same old.
They do look nice.
And I'm gonna add all the spices.
And I'm also going to add the sausage
and now I'm gonna take a pitta bread,
rip it up and I'm going to put it inside
and mix everything around.
Doing my normal plating,
adding a pop of color.
That's my specialty.
And some black Sesame seeds
'cause it looked nice
and ta-daa.
This one is from Rwanda.
And I thought it was interesting,
because of the combination
of the bread and the sausage.
So, thought it was worth a try.
Whoa, Whoa.
Spicy.
Oh, wait, the bread was kind of fun.
I think that the bread is
actually more interesting
than I thought it was going to be.
At first, I was like, Oh,
it's just going to bulk it up.
But actually, it has a really
nice texture that blends
with the noodles.
Kind of like the noodle
sandwich we just did,
but different because, this
has absorbed all of the spice
and it is spicy.
My mouth is burning, but
it tastes really good.
I actually never had the spicy Indomie
and whoa, they're not
kidding, it's got heat,
but then I've also got
spicy sausage in here so,
we're playing a dangerous game.
And you know, when you're
talking about fine dining,
one of the things that chefs do
is they play with the texture.
And so, if you're going to
do that with instant noodles
it does elevate it
having those different types
of sensations in your mouth.
So, I get what's going on here
and I'm here for it.
Very good.
Next noodle dish.
This dish is from Morocco
and you can't see my table below, because
the comment is too big, but here it is.
Couldn't find Indomie beef
so, I'm using this one and
why can't I open the package?
This is, this is humbling.
Okay, There we go, beef flavor ramen.
cutting up a carrot.
My knife skills by the
way, have vastly improved
since I started doing this.
Water in the pot.
Ramen in the water, carrots and peas,
oh, all the peas.
I'm using raw garlic.
I don't know, maybe it should
have been garlic powder,
but you know, spoiler alert.
It tasted, okay.
Flavor packet, going in,
a little bit of soy sauce.
I thought that was fun.
And okay, so here's my pepper.
And I was thinking, you know,
they did say to use all the pepper.
So, there it goes.
I'm using white pepper powder,
because I'm out of black pepper.
And that's what we're doing.
Plating is happening.
Putting a little bit of chili oil on top
and my signature green pop of color,
ta-daa.
Okay, final one is from Morocco.
This is actually the first
one that has some broth.
ASMR.
I'm questioning whether
or not my carrots cooked.
I'm feeling like they didn't.
Oh, they did.
So, there were some
interesting additions to this.
The one that I liked
that was like he said,
you got to add a whole
packet of hot pepper,
so, here we go.
I think that the beef flavor mixed
with the soy sauce is actually quite nice.
The hot pepper is, it's there,
but it's nice, like it's not so bad.
She says at the first bite,
we'll see how I'm doing a couple bites.
Peas and carrots are always nice.
You know, get some veggies in there.
You don't want just eating noodles.
I just need a quick drink.
Just one second.
Oh my god my mouth is on fire.
I know I should be doing
like milk or something, but.
I don't understand people
who can do those spicy noodle challenges,
that's just not me.
I think this is good.
I think it was a little too spicy
for my taste buds.
If you like spicy, this was a great recipe
and something that anybody can duplicate
you just need beef flavor.
Once again, your recipes
impress me beyond words.
I would love to do it again.
Leave me some recipes to try
and I would love to make
them in my next video.
With that,
I will see you all later.
And I'll try to finish this
very spicy bowl of noodles.
