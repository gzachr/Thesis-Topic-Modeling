Now we are going to explore this new island
and the good new is that it is only for us
there is literally nobody !
who said that El Nido is crowded and full of tourist?
Today we are at El Nido, Philippines
we are on our way to do a boat tour
the tour ... ?
TOUR B
We ll spend the whole day on the boat
it ll be an amazing experience, we took a private boat for 2 people
we are heading to our meeting point at 8 am
and then we ll go and try to avoid the crowd
view stunning landscapes and take a breakfast on the boat
it ll be TOP
We just arrived to the company
We booked our boat tour with the company BELLITATOURS
Victor is bringing us to our boat, there we ll meet our captain
this is our small kayak to reach our boat
arrived at the boat
we arrived to the boat, this one is only for us I can't believe it, this is crazy
So perfect
Oh, we ll put our lifejacket
thanks
lets wear this orange life jacket
to be well protected
I wear my most beautiful life jacket today
He just told us that on the tour B today there will be nobody
So this is a very good new
Here is our captain and its crew
First he told us that we ll do the tour D
because this is the one we booked yesterday (we do the 4)
but the captain couldn't be here early morning
so finally we changed
and we ll do the tour B
We just left the pier and they are already cooking very good stuff
We ll go to a beach close to this huge rock
For the moment good new we don't see anyone
I hope we ll be alone on the beach
The captain is kidding, he breaks so that his friend can fall in the water
We arrived to ...????
This is specific to El Nido
you can see that in the city and all around
these huge sharpy black rocks
we are exploring this new island
and the good new is that this is only for us
there is absolutely nobody
Who said that El Nido is full of tourist?
the good thing about taking a private boat
So we are free, we can choose how long we stay on the island
which island we want to visit first and when we want to change we come back on the boat
The captain advises us to do it reverse to avoid the crowd
and that's what allows us to be alone on beautiful islands like this one
The sand here is so thin, this is incredible
so soft
This island is very cute, there is a crazy blue water color
I want to dive in it and explore its underwater life
I'm sure I m so beautiful like that haha
lets explore what is underwater
I already saw some fishes
This snorkeling was very interesting
We saw many beautiful things but the fish bite my butt haha
I don't really like that
Oh, I think he's ready to fly the drone
it ll be sick !
For real
this is heaven on earth here
This is a small island like in the movies you know
the island you imagine when you have to draw an island
coconut tree, white sand beach, crystal clear water
it s here
we found it
this is so beautiful
ready
we visited everything
we arrived to the second stop of the tour
we are at a sand bar but this is funny because this is high tide
so we nearly don't see it
it is very small
we landed on the sandbar
for our second stop of the day
what do you think about it
it is ..
pretty small, it's so funny
but once again we are alone and this is cool
what are these holes
some crabs are hidden here
crabs in huge holes like that ?
the captain told us that this is the second, no the third time
he comes on this sandbar and he advises us
to stop here because this is cool and because he knows
vincent has a drone he told us here is
the best spot for you to fly the drone
so ll fly
ok this is wonderful
this is so cool to do islands tour with a boat
it's always a surprise every time
mostly today we have a day without tourist
so this is very enjoyable
and with all the islands we see during the boat tours, I'm wondering why everybody go on the same islands at the same time
for the tours
with more than 200 tourists at the same place at the same time
there are so many beautiful places to discover
I tell it to you but I think that Vincent
is part of the red team in Koh Lana
we can see it with his short and headband
look at it
nothing nothing
Koh lanta red team ?
he got me ðŸ˜‹
lets go again
we are now at the third stop
which is
the cathedral cave, a huge cave
some don't go here again because it is unsafe, before people used to go inside and swim but this is not the case anymore
they just show it from the outside now, to take a picture
and let's go again
Here is the fourth stop
we ll enter in the small cave through a tiny hole in the rocks
so small entrance. Landing on the beach
fourth stop
first we ll visit the inside of the cave
from this small entrance
this view is stunning, we don't know which is the perspective but
this is huge and pretty cool
when there is no more tourist, it becomes very calm here
we just hear the bats
the cave is really stunning
I've never seen any cave like this with weird shapes
rocks like
grey or green
with a funny soft touch
it s so beautiful, we visit it fast but you have to see it
end of the visit, we come back to the boat
now we are going to the snake island
lets go again
We arrive to the fifth stop
an island/sandbar
and we ll finally eat for lunch
we just arrived to the snake island and I have to confess
this is wonderful
First adventure, cross the water to reach the beach
We can also buy
in yellow kayaks, some coconuts
with local rum inside haha
We are going to discover the snake island
and our captain told us that we can climb the hill to have a beautiful viewpoint
We are trying to find our way to go to the top of the hill
I don't know why but I'm not sure this is the goos way
Do you think we are in the good direction or not at all?
euh, I don't see the hill anymore
this is there so I guess this is this way
We try to find our way
exploring the jungle
there are also some yellow hike signs
a real normal hike
I know someone who's taking a rest in the shadow
No, I'm watching butterflies
Are you hot?
No no no, I'm watching butterflies
Some few more steps
I do hikes in swimwear, I think I didn't get the concept of it
We reached the top of the snake island
with a panoramic view
and this is worth it !
even if we are in the water, in the sky, on the ground
the landscape is insane
vers-y very beautiful
and now we are going to eat on the boat
SalomÃ© is hungry
I think they did the BBQ and prepared everything
I saw a pineapple and some fruits
So many good things to eat soon
This is the best moment of my day
I am so happy
The lunch is absolutely crazy
Look at what we ll eat
Watermelon
They prepared everything just for us 2
Mussels, rice
pork, shrimp, fish
Vincent is going to pilot the boat
He's our new captain
Here is the bonus island
bonus because normally we finished all the Tour B stops
And he said, Vincent, because you have a drone
I ll bring you to a crazy beach for it to make beautiful shots
So he brought us here
On this amazing island
With the most beautiful crystal blue water we saw today
the colors, aie aie aie
This is the end of the tour B for today
after this crazy day
we saw so many different landscapes
and tomorrow we ll do one more tour
this is the end off this amazing day and this video
