foreign
welcome back to my YouTube channel I hope you 
guys are doing good and I am finally doing a  
reaction on a slapshock song after like more 
than four or five months I guess uh the only  
reason probably why I don't do a reaction for 
slapshock videos is like it really upsets me  
just to make myself realize the fact that you 
know Jamir Garcia says no more with us you know  
I really idolize him for what he has done the 
way he was like leading the band and his death  
is like you know it's it's something that will 
be very hard for me to you know even explain any  
one of you you know I have been a big follower of 
this guy for many years now but nevertheless guys  
uh keeping it very short so I am going to check 
out the official video of salamin uh probably I  
think I might have seen this before but I 
don't really remember and there are a lot  
of songs of Slapshock which probably I have 
not heard also that's that's for sure but  
having said that I will still idealize 
Jamir Garcia like he was an amazing man  
when he was really good in what he was doing 
really makes me feel sad about his demise but  
um so we are going to check out the official video 
of salamin that's what and as for the YouTube  
channel I can see that the song was released 
the official video was released in 2013 it's  
like almost 10 years after the song is out I'm 
making a reaction for this one wow time flies  
fast man I mean like things change so easily but 
nevertheless guys in case if we're here for the  
first time guys let me remind you that my name is 
Addie I'm from India I make reaction videos and  
travel culture music movies and a lot of other 
things in case guys if you want to support me  
and if you want to see my future content you can 
And subscribe and that really helps you know and  
also if you want to support me financially you 
can be a part of my YouTube community and be a  
member of my YouTube community that really helps 
you know um that's it guys so without wasting  
much time let's give it up for slap shock 
rest in peace Jamir Garcia there we go guys
I guess I know this video I think this was my 
first slapshock video that I have seen like  
a couple of years back oh and I guess this 
is a story of a guy who is a boxer probably  
um he wants to be box but he's stuck with 
his job or something like that oh man that's  
really I don't really remember exactly but 
I think I have seen this oh that's nice man
what the money
Son Of Me
Solomon
oh man I mean like uh it's it's such an amazing 
song but it really makes me feel sad whenever  
I hear his voice you know it's kind of a really 
emotional moment for someone like as a Metalhead  
like me there are a few artists from around the 
globe that have you know always idolized like  
Jamir is one of them and you know just watching 
him like just makes me still believe that how  
is it possible that he's not even live man that's 
like really it's kind of heartbreaking for me man  
I wish we had like there are some artists I wish 
we had a chance to you know get them back in this  
world again one of them definitely for Chester and 
Jamir is one of the second person I would really  
close my eyes and just tell God like you know 
please bring him back but this is not possible  
Right but at this and just to tell you that yeah I 
have seen this video but I don't exactly remember  
what but I remember the story oh God like I 
can't believe that you know when I actually  
watch this video he was alive you know maybe 
back in 2000 in 17 or 18 I guess or something  
like that I started I watched this video and now 
things are so different now back in 2023 whoa
United
mean
I'm
instead of me
I'm with you
oh man I actually did not remember the end of 
the story this is the first time probably I am  
just actually just trying to remember this now and 
uh I don't know what exactly to say now but all I  
can say is like you know rest in peace America 
but a beautiful music video man I mean like  
but you know it's it's kind of really um um it's 
really sad you know uh bands like linkin park or  
maybe you know Audioslave or even um when I 
sometimes Place old songs of Slipknot that  
reminds me of Paul Gray or Joey jordison it's 
as a metalhead you know it's kind of really  
emotional moment you know for me but I would 
always say that the music that slap shock has  
made will stay with us forever no matter what and 
I probably I don't want to say anything about it  
because I just want to give this video as simple 
as possible but just to tell you guys that you  
know I love this guy and I'll forever love this 
guy so with this note guys I'll end this Vlog but  
I hope you guys to see you again in future keep 
following if you feel if you want to subscribe  
me you can do so and if you want to be a part of 
my YouTube channel be a member you can do so but  
I'll be back again with another video Until Then
