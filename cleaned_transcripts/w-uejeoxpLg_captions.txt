so this video is basically just gonna be what it's 
like being a foreigner here in the philippines  
i've been here for three weeks now and 
uh you know it's different and honestly  
i mean i haven't seen too many videos about 
it so i'm just gonna talk about what it is  
because it is different because when you're in 
countries like i was in indonesia for two months  
when you're in indonesia you look around and 
everybody is indonesian and you think well  
obviously right that makes sense but no seriously 
it's crazy because i'm from the u.s and when you  
look around you see people like from europe africa 
middle east you see the world you see the whole  
world depending on what areas you live in but 
when you're in these countries man everybody  
everybody's what it is everybody is what the 
nation says you go to the mall right now and  
do some immigration stuff and uh we'll get into 
it yeah we're going sir uh ayala circus mom okay
how much sir how much 60 60 60
okay all right
here we go 60 pesos baby
these things are awesome get a little 
bit of shade too you got the reflector
so i will say this um you know it's  
definitely cheaper here in the philippines um 
but you can definitely spend i've noticed i  
think it's a little bit more expensive than it 
was in indonesia and honestly you can spend um  
i mean like for instance this this ride right now 
i'm taking the the tricycle it's 60 pesos which  
is just over a dollar it's not too far it's 
only like a couple kilometers um or i could  
take a taxi and that would probably be like three 
dollars right and it it doesn't sound like a lot  
if you're from back home if you're working 
and stuff but i mean if you're living here  
i mean it adds up and also it is expensive if 
you're living here you're making a certain wages
so the first thing about here in the philippines 
is honestly i a lot of people always look at you  
and i don't know personally if it's because 
i'm fat or if it's because i'm a foreigner  
but a lot of countries like indonesia like 
people were always staring at me they were always  
looking at me and like i said i don't know if it's 
because i'm fat or if it's because i'm a foreigner  
but sometimes it's uncomfortable and i personally 
don't really like it it took me a little while to  
get used to it because see why especially when you 
walk into local places it's like everybody just  
stop like it's like the plates crash in movies and 
everyone's looking at you like what the [ __ ] is  
going on here now the second thing about being a 
foreigner here in the country is it's different  
kinds of food so there's this place called maung 
innesol i'm not too sure i think it's like a  
filipino chain but uh but the filipino food is 
obviously a lot different than the food back home  
so that's something that's really cool i like the 
filipino food they get they use a lot of vinegars  
a lot of vinegar sauces which i love like 
vinegar with the meats you can dip it like  
a spicy vinegar sauce sometimes and i love 
that i will say though there is a lot of  
american influence western type influence in the 
food choices here so it is there's a lot more  
stuff like western style food you could say 
if you're into that versus how it was like  
in indonesia there was a lot of that depending 
on where you were but there was much much less  
there was there was it was pretty much indonesian 
food wherever you go whereas here you i feel like  
you have like a lot of options so another one that 
i have to mention is that it's hot it's hot here  
and it's the rainy season right here so it's extra 
humid i'm not sure if it's always this humid but  
it's 100 humid every single day and where i came 
from it's actually the opposite it's extremely dry  
so for me i sweat it's sweaty but honestly 
it's good i like it so the weather is it's  
tough here sometimes i think the last thing that 
i like about being was different in the foreign  
philippines is people here are very polite 
everyone's always saying yes sir yes ma'am  
excuse me sir right whereas i feel like back home 
it's not like this so much when you talk to people  
that are older you're like yes sir yes ma'am but 
i feel like here it's like all ages so that's  
something nice and i feel like over time people 
kind of lost that what's up baby how are you doing
and i feel like over time people have you know 
they've kind of stepped away from that and it's  
nice it's nice being a society where people are 
polite there's a lot of respect people are very  
uh respectful here so i definitely love that so i 
just want to do a quick video about what it's like  
being a foreigner in the philippines um so far 
i'm loving it like i said before it's my third  
time here so i'm not new here and i'm loving it 
so far i'm gonna be in manila for a while and i'm  
gonna head out to other parts i'm gonna be here 
for two more months so let me know if there's any  
places you think i should go some beach places i 
think i'll probably wind up in palawan for a while  
but anyways thank you philippines i love you 
thanks for watching we'll see you next time
you
