that everyone today everyone rides free  
today give me a swing ho ho ho here we go oh
my God
we're about to scare Waleed right now
give me all your money we got him 
welcome back to another video my friends
bro I was waving to you from the metro and you 
didn't see me you were staring at me for a bit  
and I'm going like this and I'm like whoa he 
doesn't see me so I ran across hid behind the  
bushes when you look this way and then as soon 
as you look back that's why he sprinted delete  
that no we got him again welcome back to 
another video my friends that is some high  
energy to start the video yeah you know not 
today bro we got him we got him all right so  
it is time to do a little bit of exploring guys 
let's do this okay so we're gonna be heading  
down to the theme park here now we've got two 
options bro what do you think jeepney or coco
I feel like the jeepney might be fun thank you  
all right well we probably gotta cross to the 
other side bro if we want to get a Jeep thing
this is Jeep decentral here they're 
moving in and out we're just trying  
to find how we can get over there and they 
all have their own like customizations here  
all right let's hear you got a slight 
little space we're going through  
oh bro don't get lost in there 
I almost lost my right arm hello
all right we got to get to 
the other side somehow bro
yeah that's gonna be tough all right we 
need to get across this street right here  
oh that's gonna be tough that's gonna be tough uh 
we're gonna we're gonna go right after this guy  
no definitely not all right we found 
a little way to get around here hello  
we are oh we've made it safe and sound what do 
you think this is the one bro all right well  
hop on bro it's gonna be a wild ride [Music] all 
right we'll ask him uh we gotta get one near um
okay guys we are going towards uh
does this one go toward Dolomite Dolomite Beach
this one
over other side okay salamat kuya  
all right we gotta go all the way 
to the other side to get over there
I think there's an underpass I was about to jump  
the fence bro holy crap yeah that's 
like playing Frogger right there guys  
these logs I don't recommend you to try them 
at home or in your own City ah that would  
have been the way to get across there was an under 
Passage much easier going this way that's for sure  
wow and look at this right when you get down 
here you've got all these beautiful wall murals  
I wonder if it's actually painted uh yeah it's 
actually painted at first it was such a clean  
painting I thought that maybe it was a uh like a 
picture printed out but that's real pain [Music]  
these are definitely real pictures though [Music] 
kakuya I'm not sure if he's okay long right now
all right
oh bro it is gonna be a hot day today I already 
feel it yeah yeah what am I saying it's gonna  
be it already is it already is look at it 
all right this might be our guy right here  
hello is this going to uh dolomite
a Dolomite [ __ ]
[Music]
yeah go in this one okay all right bro 
hop on bro we're getting we're getting on
[Music]
all right well we made it on [Music]
oh yeah wow all right and much easier than 
walking bro I'll tell you that come on
all right perfect happy to hear okay 
this is what you call a wild ride yeah  
and this is what happens when you meet 
Mac and you start a journey with him  
exactly nothing can happen after I've had 
a Red Bull and after I've scared him the  
uh the adrenaline's pumping today 
his heart's pumping more than five
you guys can see now cruising through this 
way during the day not as much traffic here so  
we're going at a much quicker Pace the nice part 
about these Jeep these guys is they're constantly  
running if there's no traffic at pretty much 
any moment when you're at the jeepney pickup  
spot you're going to be able to hop right on get 
from point A to point B for a really cheap price  
I want to say it's about 20. uh pesos depending 
on the distance you're going so for us I want to  
say yeah it'll be somewhere around 20 because 
I've taken a similar route like this before  
and uh yeah that's you know like 30 
cents roughly a little less right there
hey very good yeah
hey hey you see him he was taking a video of us
yeah yeah guys this is definitely 
a new route for me to get down to  
Dolomite Beach so we might be going 
on a little town tour to get there
hello oh brother we we've got the comfiest 
ride in town brother oh no no not a chance  
brother no brother we got a great ride

be I think just a little bit further here the last  
time I took one of these I got off at the exact 
stop I just was like this has got to be the spot  
and we arrived okay yeah we're passing Dolomite so 
we're gonna take it a little bit further and then  
once we get down there then we'll walk the rest 
of the way to the theme park there it is everybody

subscribers coming in goodbye guys you can see  
how hot it is today in Manila I look like I just

country I've been to out of 55 countries now 
that you can find jeepneys so it's a super cool  
experience to get around it's iconic for the 
city of Manila too are there jeepneys in Cebu

disgusting I'm sorry you guys got to look at  
that luckily you don't have to smell that though 
that is just how hot it is here in Manila with  
the humidity level this High I've like never 
sweated this much in my life guys that was such  
a fun jeepney and uh you know it's just it's uh 
some people are gonna look at this video like bro  
why are you spending so much the second time you 
did that on the chimney it makes people's day you  
know you never know who's having a bad day I mean 
it's a small expense for me just under 20 bucks  
basically everyone to get home safe you never 
know maybe someone could buy some baked goods  
for their kids or something like that by saving 
the uh you know 30 20 30 patients they were gonna  
play so now we're gonna be heading over to the 
Walid right over to the uh star theme park right  
down the road we got to figure out a way to get 
across this street though we're at the rainbow  
crosswalk that you've probably seen in a previous 
video and so uh yeah I guess uh it's gonna yeah  
it's gonna take like five minutes I feel like 
to get across here oh no 63 seconds remaining  
we have made it a nice little Ocean Breeze right 
around here it's the first time I've made it in  
the Dolomite area during the daytime like where 
it's not during the daytime but let's say midday  
when it's you know Peak Sun directly above us and 
you know we're still hours away every other time  
I've been down here it was like right around the 
sunset time so it's cool to be down here now we've  
got some sort of Street card up here not sure what 
we're about to come across though hello brother
my name is Patrick Patrick the king of 
Manila yeah yeah okay this is my wife I  
there and your Marketing Manager for her no 
NASA tourism oh tourists yeah tourist stand  
she sells something you like Manila Dolomite 
I love Manila Dolomite yeah just wait for  
a while oh we're going this way brother 
we're gonna run we're gonna run wanna race
was I fastest taking my clothes sir 
you're getting your clothes where  
you going now hold on hold on I don't 
want to agree to anything yet brother  
hello it's good to see you it's my wife 
your wife yes I remember you how are you  
oh loving dolomite we just 
we just had a maserat coconut
we got off at the wrong stop yeah that's that's  
the good stop what oh we're gonna we're 
gonna stop over at the theme park first
there we're going to Star City theme park 
yeah yeah yeah it was nice seeing you nice  
to see you guys goodbye my friends 
thank you so much see you all right  
okay so we got up on the wrong oh that's I 
would have never expected that I thought I  
thought this was maybe a guy that was coming to 
sell or something but it happened to be the the  
husband of the uh really nice lady that was 
on the bus I think her name was Jennifer uh  
uh and so all of a sudden he just brought us 
there so I was racing him Full Speed Ahead  
I was so excited for dolomite yeah I know right I 
told him it's way back there bro you haven't been  
no to be honest and maybe Filipinos will or will 
not agree with me but I didn't really find the  
actual Beach at Dolomite very good it was a nice 
for a sunset photo but you're not allowed to swim  
there there's only a rock there there's no food 
stands inside and so I don't know I don't really  
know what the purpose is I'm not saying guys 
don't go to dollar mine Beach like the beach  
itself but I'm just telling you I don't really 
know what there is to do because I only know  
beaches as like a place to swim that just to like 
take a photo all right guys fast forward about 10  
minutes we uh walked a bit further got a little 
more sweat going we have a full puddle right here  
I know it's disgusting but hey that's life and we 
are almost to the theme park right here now I'm  
kind of worried because I don't hear screaming in 
the distance I don't hear much going on this could  
be an afternoon thing because it is a Monday that 
we're here however I have no idea because there's  
a lot of cars here so maybe we'll cross and see 
or it's possible the rides there just are not  
that scary so people aren't screaming but I don't 
believe that I feel like it's got to be closed and  
I'm gonna be so bummed if it is don't even Jinx 
that I don't know probably after the mission  
we went through oh you know what that means bro 
we're going to the zoo if that doesn't work out
soon so let's put it this way these Adventures 
that and that riding that jeep knit in itself  
was a was a fun time so always a good 
time so it's all worth for something  
I believe this is the 
entrance to the theme park and
