up high in the mountains in the northern region of 
the philippines there's a culture and it's dying  
the kalinga people head hunters 
men who killed men in a tribal war  
men who cut off heads and were inked for the 
sign of strength one odd is the last of her kind  
the last mombabatok of the kalinga tribe she has 
tattooed headhunters but our journey starts here  
in metro manila in a car park it's 8 p.m now 
and we are waiting to be picked up around 1am  
we'll reach banawa arc and around 3am we'll be 
waiting for the sun to rise and getting ready for  
the jungle tractor buscalan village getting day 
is challenging it's in the lesser known part of  
the philippines my heart is pounding this is not 
an ordinary journey this is a trip of a lifetime  
how are you feeling colin there's a couple of 
things that are bothering me at the moment is  
i really don't sleep well on public transport 
so it's gonna be a long long long night on that  
hopefully i can get a little bit of sleep because 
it'll be nice to get some sleep before this  
epic adventure starts tomorrow and and the 
other major thing is whether we actually get  
to meet why not she's super old now um i know 
there's a few people that have gone out there  
and she wasn't well enough or she wasn't doing 
the tattoos which would be it'd be disappointing  
i'm not a disaster because her nieces and 
things are still doing tattoos apparently so  
it's not a disaster but what an amazing experience 
if we get to meet her as well looking forward
just send us a message of the count away 
but this is a different car registration  
i don't i'm not sure if the one has changed 
now or this is somebody else i don't know
let's say we made it we found 
our bird he's our driver today  
it's different car registration not the 
one we was looking for but we made it
okay guys it's 9 15 so 15 minutes later schedule 
but we're on the road so let the journey begin
it's eleven o'clock we're having a quick stop um  
it's my first toasty from 7-eleven just having 
a quick snack before it's actually not too bad
we have a break it's been five hours since 
we on the mountain roads and the last couple  
of hours has been really really rough um 
i'm feeling restless i can't get no sleep  
every time i close my eyes i can see these head 
hunters and i think coffee would be good now but  
there's no coffee here it's currently how far 
and the mountain roads are so steep and curvy  
um but we've reached banana arc what i can 
see here people stop to take pictures here  
but on the left hand side there is a man holding 
at the end on the right hand side of the ark  
there is a woman there both half naked in 
traditional clothing it's very interesting we have  
a few more hours of the mountain 
roads and hopefully we will  
reach the area audi boise look who met me here 
oh my goodness these are the cutest puppies ever
oh that was a nice good morning but yeah we 
have a few more hours of the mountain roads  
where we will reach the area from 
where we will get ready to do the hike  
you can already feel the temperatures that have 
dropped with approximately 10-15 degrees already  
it's quite chilly need to get the coats out
i spent the last seven 
hours trying to get to sleep
now i'm gonna spend the next 
12 hours trying to stay awake  
there's something quite magical about a sunrise  
it's very dreamy romantic i think it's probably 
dreamy because i'm half asleep but it's just it's  
stunning it's beautiful you can see for long the 
rice paddies are incredible getting closer guys
this is amazing albert our driver he just 
said that but now i rise is around 20 pesos
it's so beautiful it's so beautiful 
here i've been so blessed in four hours
it's just taken a minute to stop 
and meet the cloud on the way  
this cloud is amazing you've never 
seen anything like it this is studio  
i honestly think this is the prettiest 
thing i've ever seen it's blown my mind  
i think we have to quickly 
stop and pick up some guides  
so i guess they're going to take us up the 
mountain now so nelly's hanging out with them
okay okay okay okay so after 12 hours on the road 
now now the van's taking us as far as it can go  
so we've been met by these two guides and now 
we're going to take a hike up the mountain  
let's hope we get to meet her that'd be amazing  
we have reached the area from where we will hike 
to buscalan village there is no direct road to the  
village hence why i mean i'm not surprised it's 
very steep we need to go through the mountains  
so we're taking only the essentials with us 
i'm literally taking just one backpack with me  
ready to go the mountains look so cozy
our tour guide she's a local 
lady she keeps shouting  
in her language let's go let's go she's so 
excited look at her skills that's impressive
on the kick man
she's she's very skilled lady 
very skilled look what she's doing
wow this is impressive
we're getting closer of this mountain 
is that moment we have been waiting for  
buscalan village makes us smile  
we made i can see the village we made 
it half of the mission is accomplished
the best thing about buscalan village 
is that there is no phone signal here  
you can be fully present reconnect with 
nature socialize with people and simply be  
we're staying at the home stay it's warm 
and tranquil we'll be sleeping on the floor  
this brings memories back 
from my childhood i remember
a bit sad i remember being snuggled in between 
layers and blankets my nose freezing cold grandma  
selecting tobacco late hours to stay on the market 
even the freaking coffee here reminds me of home
life passes by and if you don't stop and look 
around it's all gone it's lush here peaceful quiet  
my saucy face buscalon is an old ancient village 
it's located on top of the mountain so they could  
see the enemies coming i'm glad that the 
village has kept its authentic looking feel  
despite the amount of people with the 
tracks local families have opened their  
homes for visitors like us who have come 
here to preserve the culture they have  
oh
is
hi
so we just found out that she's actually here and 
she's tattooing today so we just picked uh i guess  
need all ready to go so we're going to go and 
find one out soon and get out oh i'm so excited  
i'm actually a little bit i think a little bit 
nervous i think when you because we research  
quite a lot so we learn about the culture and 
learn about what what the history and everything  
so to actually get tattooed by her quite quite 
overwhelming actually quite overwhelmed one odd  
this history written in highs 
it's not clear how old one god is  
back in the days it wasn't a practice to record 
a child's birth they say she is 105 years old  
from the age of 15 one god has been tattooing 
head hunters and women from the kalinga tribe
they said abu wang od has called 
me first to get my tattoo done  
but i'm not sure where to go and 
where she is so let's find out
i don't want just
she learned from her father he was considered 
a master tattooist traditionally only men were  
allowed to learn the art of tattooing one god was 
an exception she had a talent her signature tattoo  
is the three dots which symbolizes her two nieces 
who are blessed to practice the hand tap tattoo  
she taps the ink into the skin with a 
precise motion it hurt but i can bear it  
there's a ritual for every custom in kalinga 
and tattooing is one of them headhunters were  
warriors who had killed and were rewarded with an 
eagle title returning from bata with a decapitated  
human head was seen as a victory they would 
light fires and celebrate long into the night  
feast on a slaughtered buffalo and drink 
rice liquor from the skulls of the enemies  
so that was um i mean it was an absolute honour to 
be to have this now and um yeah it's really really  
cool it's it was over as quick as it started 
i mean but it was yeah what uh what uh what  
an amazing honor to be tagged by by the legend 
herself i have chosen to have it right here but  
the first thing she did is i want you to have it 
here so i say i have no choice but to say yes but
i don't even know i don't know what to say i feel 
proud to continue to carry this tradition and  
this is what i came for for the journey and for 
continuing the tradition and this is what it would  
mean to me no matter what continue the journey 
one goal chose to keep the tradition alive and  
hustled her apprentices the art they carefully 
mark the patterns on the skin using a rice talk  
the ink is a simple mixture of charcoal and 
water we watch them scratch the charcoal from an  
old burnt pot and prepare it in a small coconut 
shell every design has a symbolic meaning like  
spiritual guidance and protection some of the 
designs are snake skins scorpion mountains and  
compass the hand tap tattoo too is prepared here 
in the village the girls place lime thousand  
beautifully decorated bamboo sticks they get their 
needles from a calaman city behind one god's house  
okay so mine's all done now it's actually 
mountains and it means a journey and strength  
which is quite apt for the journey that nelly 
and i are on not just traveling um you know the  
journey of trying to find out finding our way 
as sort of short filmmakers uh vlogging entries  
you know the only experience we had seven months 
ago was i really like to watch movies so you know  
these are these aren't just hills we're 
climbing these are these are mountains  
for me it's really apt to get a mountain tattoo 
in the mountains it sort of stands for the journey  
we're on together very happy very glad we did 
it it was quite painful towards the end actually  
there's like two hours that took so i mean the 
last the last half an hour was was quite painful  
because it got quite sore nellie's 
just getting hers finished off now  
i'm sure she'll explain more about what it 
is and what it means to her i'm having the  
traveler compass guidance to me it would always 
mean the journey it would always mean direction  
keep going never give up it will remind me 
of a journey here and every tap will mean  
a memory for me every time i didn't give up every 
time i kept going you can't not cross all these  
miles and not go and find the local waterfall 
so we're gonna take you for a little trade  
when i heard him going to the mountain i took 
my boots off and i came all booted but make sure  
you take your slippers on because i lost my boots 
after that too but it's perfect now nature baiting
i find the um the rice terrace is absolutely 
mesmerizing if you're not sure why they build  
them in tears um it's quite a simple and a very 
clever way of doing it so the rain hits the top  
and as it fills each reservoir it just 
drops down drops down drops down drops down  
water in each each level as it goes absolutely 
amazing must have ages to dig them out and get  
them ready but it's it's worth it look so 
so amazing it sounds like it might rain  
in fact we was praying for rain the 
mountains look cozy when it's raining
so
so
today felt like a lifetime like we have 
been living in the mountains for a while  
like the sun has been shining for centuries 
the rays are heavy in the end the humans and  
the crops are longing for rainfall at last 
the rain has come we can rest now traveling  
makes us face our fears every day every day 
we do something new we have never done before  
meeting the legendary one odd keeping the 
culture alive is a great honor if i can  
give you something from this journey it would be 
if it scares you it's worth it face it take it
