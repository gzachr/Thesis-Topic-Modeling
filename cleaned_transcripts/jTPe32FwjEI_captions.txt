i am the mother of joe coy and today i
am reacting to his jokes about me my mom
cured everything with dick's vaporizer
that is true
my mom never hit us she just scared us a
lot and she used to flex like that
that is my action all the time when i
listen to this joke it's so funny
because it brings back memory especially
the vicks vaporub that is very very
total i still do that
we use those words not in such a bad way
that you meant what you're saying
because you know it has a different
meaning in english but you see the
filipinos use that to emphasize what you
really want to to emphasize that is true
or you meant that right and we do that
even up to now i still do that where's
your lunchbox joseph
what do you mean you don't know where
where did you go
you go from house to school school to
house where did you live
well majority of that is true but i
don't use the word you know that starts
with f
once in a while i use that but for funny
entertainment with my kids because my
kids really enjoy it when they hear me
say by the words and sometimes i really
rip it to them you know and oh ho boy i
love yelling
even up to now i still yell but i hardly
use that when my kids were growing up so
i don't know where joe got that every
time i hear him in his comedy act my
goodness that word is flowering his show
you know filipino mom on their kids
dreams can't have a dream what about
what are you talking about
i told my mom want to be comedian she
cried why
why do you want to be a communication
jose
all your aunties are nurses
your cousins are nurses
do you see any clowns
well not just nurse
it's just that i want my kids to have a
degree you know i want them to have a
job with permanent pay i thought that he
was enrolled at unlv but i didn't know
he was pursuing comedy him and i
explained to him
that you know uh being a comedian it's
not for sure because you have to have a
show that is only the time you will make
money which is i think it turned out
okay god bless you mom you hooked up
with a soldier and had a kid in america
[Applause]
my mom and dad divorced when when i was
like 10 11 years old my mom had to raise
us on her own
she did that on her own tough as
when joko was young he loves to watch
eddie murphy that's where he got his
cursing
no and he loves to curse anyway seem bad
and then he loves bill cosby so i can
see already a trace of comedy act in his
act should i say when we were presenting
him here in las vegas we rented huntred
theater so joe was
asking me mom can you help me this will
be my first show it's so funny because i
don't know how to decorate the theater
so i went to 99 cents i bought these
streamers and i was putting the
streamers all over and i told them you
know the way we will make money is this
we will make a program of your show so
what i did is i went to my friends that
are professionals i got the cards and i
enlarged them to be a size of eight by
eleven and i made as a book i put two
holes and i put a black ribbon and i i
just went ahead and gave it to my
friends josie you're making money out of
our business card
after joko's show they said you know
what
your son will go places
and i remember that
nobody
can exist in the world alone having
jokowi having issue and showing how
filipinos are and that's really how we
are the advice that i can give them is
this when you see a filipino up there
put a foundation underneath them so they
can still reach their pedestal in life
whatever they're doing you know because
not just that they are filipinos but
they are human beings they are people
that you should be helping
because they need their your help at the
time for the parents i mean you know be
there for your children support them for
whatever they want which i didn't
support jo ko at first because you know
i didn't trust the the job you know of
being a comedian for me i think it is
very
unpredictable if you have the degree
anything on your disposal is something
that will do good in the future i guess
i am one of those old filipinas that
if you don't have it you can't say that
much
but my goodness the tenacity in him to
do what he wants to do because right now
joko is in his place now whereby he can
say that i did it on my own
which i respect because the filipinos
that are watching him can relate to his
jokes i think jo koy is a
an example
of a filipino but loves is his cop
filipinos you know and the thing is it
doesn't always necessarily to have a
degree to be successful if you pursue
what you want to do and do the best you
can for what you have right now you can
at least say i've done everything in
essence don't give up
hi i'm josie harrison i am docusmoms i
have my own radio show with phlb radio
we are broadcasting that here in las
vegas nevada
