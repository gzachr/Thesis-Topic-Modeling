Good afternoon from
Suvarnabhumi Airport here in Bangkok, Thailand.
Khob khun mak krup. (Thank you very much.)
Thank you.
Today, guys,
this Scottish explorer
is following in the footsteps of the Spanish conquistador,
Miguel López de Legazpi.
That's right.
Just like Legazpi did all those years ago,
I'm off to "invade" Manila, Philippines.
Fortunately, about four and a half centuries
worth of technological progress
means we can go to Manila by
a comfortable plane ride,
not by a dangerous boat ride.
And it will be a comfortable plane ride because
yer man is flying business class today
with Thai Airways.
I'm sure my journey to Manila
is gonna be a lot more comfortable
than it was for the Spanish,
all those years ago.
Right. It should be H. Yeah, Thai Airways.
Let's go for it.
Sawasdee krup. (Hello.)
- Sawasdee krup. (Hello.)
Where are you going, sir?
I'm going to Manila.
Manila?
- Yes, just like Miguel López de Legazpi.
You know, the Spanish conquistador.
The Scottish explorer.
????.
- Going to Manila today.
Sir, you're travelling,
- Yes?
on the business class.
Yes.
- You can use our lounge.
Thank you. So,
- Silk Lounge, Royal Silk.
you can use the fast track lane.
Ah, there's a fast track?
- Around row A.
Row A, right.
- Go straight and this way.
This way.
- Okay.
Then onto the Royal Silk Lounge.
- And then after that is our lounge.
Okay, khob knun krup (thank you.)
Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.
Okay.
So,
we get fast tracked.
That's good.
A lot of the times you fly business class,
you don't get fast tracked through security.
But when it's usually with the,
the airline of that country,
you can get fast tracked.
So that's good. I'm flying Thai Airways today,
and Thai Airways,
this is their airport, isn't it?
This is the main airport for Thai Airways.
So, I find...
Could it be this way, 'International Departures?'
They said something about row A.
Yeah, there it is there, "Fast Track."
Well, that was good.
It was fast track security and immigration.
So I checked in, and got through security and immigration
in about 3, 4, 5 minutes max.
And now
I can head to the Royal Silk Lounge and relax.
"Airline Lounges."
This one here, "Royal Silk Lounge."
"D, East."
okay, so my flight is going from D3,
and that's D3 down there.
And surely the airport lounge is
somewhere close to there. So,
that's convenient.
And here we are.
It's actually next to Gate 4, so
I'm only one gate way.
That's good.
More time in the lounge.
Sometimes the lounge can be like
20 minutes walk away from your gate or whatever,
and it just,
you know,
reduces the amount of time you have to relax.
Okay, guys.
I did see back there,
there was a roped-off part for first class.
My flight doesn't have first class.
It's just economy and business. So,
yeah, this is where we are.
And I haven't had lunch, so
some of this stuff is gonna come in handy.
Some wee sandwiches and stuff.
I'm sure I can
grab a few of those and stick them in my backpack
for later.
Some
"Seafood pies."
"Spinach and cheese pies."
"Chicken nuggets."
"Spring rolls." Aye.
I'm pretty sure I'm gonna be able to load a plate full of
good stuff here.
"Taro buns."
"Barbecue buns." There's...
Ah, yeah.
That's what you like, isn't it?
Them.
Those Chinese buns.
And some spaghetti Bolognese.
Thai green curry.
Ohhh, look at that, fried fish
right there.
Ah, some nice, steamed
veggies.
And, of course, some rice.
We're in Thailand.
Of course.
The land of rice.
I'm pretty sure this lounge is bigger even than this.
Yeah, it goes all the way up here.
Let's go and have a look to see what's up here.
I think that might be a smoking section in there.
And...
Yeah this is just more seating.
This is more of a quiet area.
Good.
I think I'm gonna load up a plate of goodies
and bring it somewhere up here to chill.
Oh, the air conditioning is nice and cold here as well.
I like it.
I like it. (x2)
Right. Let's find ourselves somewhere to settle down.
Oh, and there is more food here as well.
There is more
"Chicken stew pie."
Good.
More chicken nuggets, spring rolls, and stuff.
I think it's the same stuff that was down there,
except...
Oh, no, no.
That's some Indian food, some Gobi masala.
Ah, and they have
chicken green curry in wee individual,
individual bowls there.
That's nice.
And some more rice, of course.
Oh this is a "Halal corner." That's it.
So this is for Muslims,
specifically, but I'm sure
anybody can eat that.
Okay.
I'm probably gonna be at the back of the class
like a bad boy.
Let's... Oh, there's a bar here as well.
That's good.
You can get all these spirits
for free.
Yer man
doesn't drink alcohol, so
I always miss out on value in these situations.
In lounges, on business class flights and suchlike.
Okay.
Where am I gonna settle?
Maybe just...
Dunno, decisions, decisions.
Which comfortable seat should I take?
Maybe...
See, this isn't really set up for eating.
Yeah, this is more for relaxing.
Look, the guy there's eating a plate of food,
but he's not got a table.
Okay.
I'll go for the less comfortable seat, but
more comfortable for eating.
The table, right here.
Ah, that's good.
They have USB and power sockets.
Lovely jubbly, guys.
I'm gonna enjoy
this light lunch right here,
and I will see you guys on the flight.
Yum, yum.
Mmh.
This is good.
Sweet and sour.
Mmh.
Well, it's about 20 minutes
until the flight is due to take off,
but it's not boarding yet.
I know it's not boarding because that's my gate right there.
D3.
I'm just sitting watching it.
This is good, though.
If this was any other type of
lounge situation,
I'd probably already be at the gate by now, you know?
40 minutes before the flight.
Now it's 20 minutes before the flight,
and I'm still relaxing here because
apparently the flight's delayed.
Is the plane even there?
I do see...
Yeah the plane is there.
That is it.
It's connected, so
I dunno what's going on,
but they're not boarding anybody.
Okay, guys,
we're finally boarding, right here.
And
I'm kinda glad for the delay, actually.
It meant that yer man could take a nice,
clean
business-class dump
in there.
Fantastic.
I'm feeling nice and comfortable
before my flight.
Let's go for it.
Looks like they're boarding business class,
right now.
What often happens is, I turn up late
and they've already closed the business class
check-in, and then I'm stuck
with all the economy passengers.
That's happened a lot. Because,
like I said, you want to maximise your time
in the lounge, don't you?
Right.
I have to go all the way there, and down around.
Sawasdee krup. (Hello.)
- Sawasdee ka. (Hello.)
Khob khun krup. (Thank You.)
- Khob khun ka. (Thank you.)
Sawasdee krup. (Hello.)
18-A.
Okay, this one.
- This one? Okay.
So here we go, the Royal Silk cabin on this...
I think it's a 787-900 Dreamliner right here.
And this is the type of seating arrangement you like,
isn't it, the herringbone?
I'm in 18, which is this one.
Yeah, the herringbone
seating arrangement,
right here.
That's what you like if you're travelling solo,
because then you don't have any stranger
sitting next to you.
Maybe some of you who,
you travel with a couple,
you tra...
Oh.
I've broken it already.
Guys, I've broken the seat.
Huh.
I've just,
I've just broken the seat.
I was gonna say, you guys who travel as a couple,
might like the other type of
seating arrangement where you have
two seats next to each other.
This type is perfect for me, though.
Right. I'm gonna have to do something about this.
I've broken my seat.
Oh.
- Yeah.
I just stepped on it and it just came off.
- Ah, that's okay.
Does it clip back in, or?
Can I just push it back in, or?
- Maybe he can just fix it.
- Give me, give me.
The engineer?
Yes.
- Ah, okay.
Okay, fixed now.
- Is that it?
Okay, thank you.
Sorry about that.
- You're welcome.
My clumsy, big feet
broke it, but the engineer fixed it.
We're grand.
So let's check out this seat then, guys.
First of all, we've got the electronic windows right here.
So there's no shutters.
You just use this to make it...
Well, you can dim it.
There's five different levels,
from fully open
to dark.
We've got the
TV right there.
The thing with this type of arrangement
where you have to kinda like clip the TV out,
SHHH!
- is
you can't have it
open during takeoff and landing, so
you lose some entertainment time there,
unfortunately.
What else? Oh, yeah, the seat belt has an airbag in it.
Check that out.
For some added safety.
So if we have a minor crash,
this might come in useful.
- Shh shh shh.
We've got an airbag.
And, here.
Quiet!
That just kinda pulls up.
I guess more privacy if you're sleeping.
And, let's see, this,
I think this it's just for storage.
Yeah, it's a wee storage compartment right there.
There we go, guys.
Very nice.
The flight time to Ninoy Aquino International Airport
Alright, let's try out these
noise canceling headphones, right here.
Pretty decent.
Peanut's, sir.
- Thank you.
It's for me, Coke Zero?
Mhm.
- Yeah, okay.
I'll give you the whole can.
Cheers.
Other people getting champagne served.
I see lots of champagne glass being served.
Me with the Coke Z.
Better than champagne.
Thank you.
- Meat and salmon.
What is it?
- It's the first course.
Crab meat and salmon.
Ah, okay.
Thank you.
Something and salmon.
Looks like chopped potato and mayonnaise.
Let's give it a taste.
Yeah.
That's what it is. It's chopped potato and mayonnaise.
I'm pretty sure that's what it is.
And some...
Oh, yeah.
Some shred of,
shreds of salmon mixed through it.
The salmon caviar on top.
It's nice enough.
A nice, light appetiser.
Oh.
I almost dropped that in my lap.
I've got the,
I have got the napkin just in case.
Khob khun krup. (Thank you.)
- Welcome.
Okay, garlic bread. Lovely.
Oh, nice and hot as well.
Lovely.
All crispy on the outside, nice and soft in the inside.
Soaked with garlic butter.
Mmmh.
Mmmh.
Okay.
- For your meal.
Thank you.
Okay, so
I've just been served the main.
Looks like a very small portion,
but it's
Thai green curry beef
and
some sort of omelette.
Okay, let's give it a go.
I had
chicken green curry in the lounge,
and it wasn't very spicy at all.
I guess
they're catering more towards international passengers.
Usually Thai curries are spicy as heck.
The one I had in the lounge wasn't.
Let's try this one on the flight.
Oh.
That is spicy.
That's proper Thai spicy.
Oh.
Oh.
I wasn't expecting that at all.
This is gonna be quite a challenge for yer man
to finish this.
Would you like some more bread, sir?
Ah, no thank you.
Actually,
now that I've had, like, three or four bites of it,
it's not that spicy after all.
Just really the first bite.
I'm getting used to it.
It's delicious, a delicious green curry flavour.
And the beef,
perfect,
tender, soft, juicy.
Mmh.
Oh, yeah.
Yum, yum.
I enjoyed that, actually.
The secret was just avoiding these chilies right here.
Without the chilies,
not too spicy.
Thank you.
Yeah. I can give you first a cheese plate, sir.
- Oh, pudding?
Okay, great.
Pudding is coming.
Ah, okay. Good.
A wee cheese plate.
Thank you.
Yeah.
Well, I was expecting a cake, but
this little cheese plate is nice enough, isn't it?
These are little, dried strawberries.
Very sweet.
Lemon meringue.
- Lemon meringue?
Okay. Thank you.
- Do you want some tea or coffee, sir?
Eh, no, thank you.
Thanks.
Okay, guys. So,
the cheese plate wasn't instead of the pudding,
it was in addition to it, so
we've got a nice wee lemon meringue as well
to finish things off,
Mmmh.
Oh, yeah.
Very creamy.
Very creamy. (x2)
Lovely jubbly.
Time for a wee nap, I think.
And that's us, fully flat.
It is fully flat as well.
100% flat.
And how comfortable is it?
Well,
almost fully comfortable.
It's just my left foot
is kinda touching the...
Is touching this, you know?
If I wanna fully extend my feet, I kinda
have to keep them together.
It's quite comfortable,
just not 100%.
But,
yeah,
it doesn't look like they're gonna turn the lights off
or anything, so
l won't get any kinda proper sleep
It is only, like, 5 PM Bangkok time.
Like, 6 PM
Philippines time, so,
yeah.
I'm just gonna lie here and chill, though.
It's nice.
Khob khun krup. (Thank you.)
- Khob khun ka. (Thank you.)
Okay, guys, here we are,
Ninoy Aquino Airport in Manila.
First time I've been here in 7 years.
I had planned to come here in 2020, but
certain regulations got in the way of that. So,
I'm finally here,
at last.
Here we go,
the local currency.
Next step,
get a SIM card.
I think I'm gonna get the Globe one.
I'm gonna get the Globe one.
Okay, sir.
- Yeah.
Hi.
What is the plans?
Oh, this is...
- We have this package, sir. You can
"100GB."
- choose.
That's huge.
????.
- Okay.
How many days you stay?
Eh, 30 days.
30 days? That's enough.
It's 30 days, right there. Yeah.
- Ah, "Valid for 30 days."
Okay, I'll take this one.
- Okay, yeah.
1,500.
So that's about $27 USD.
About $1 a day.
Cheaper than
You know, paying for data roaming or whatever.
I'm pretty sure the Filipinos,
their data packages
are a lot cheaper than that.
Probably, 100GB is overkill.
I'm never gonna use 100GB, but
wherever.
Your cell phone and passport, please.
Okay.
So, the lovely lady
is taking care of that for me.
So, as always, when you arrive in a country,
you can get your SIM card a lot cheaper.
Like in Thailand, the easiest way to do it is
not go to the airport and pay like
1,000-2,000 baht,
it's to
go into the city centre,
go to any random 7-Eleven
and pay like 50 baht for the SIM card,
and get like a 200 baht
data package that lasts you for a month.
So I could have done that here.
Probably got, like, a 10GB data package,
and it would have been plenty.
Probably would have paid like a 10th of the price. But,
the thing is, when you do it at the airport,
they sort it all out for you.
Like, they register your passport and suchlike.
I remember when I went to Pakistan,
it was a nightmare.
There was only, like, one,
one office of the telecom company
who could register a foreigner with their passport,
and you had to go to their head office.
Any random little shop couldn't do it.
Okay.
Already?
- Okay.
Oh, you want me to unlock.
Okay.
- Yeah.
Okay.
- Open, please.
Open? Okay.
One advice, guy,
don't leave it anywhere.
What's that?
You just leave it here,
your wallet.
- My wallet?
Yeah, don't, don't...
Really, ah?
- Yeah.
I wasn't thinking.
Yeah, distracted.
Yeah, but airport's kinda safe.
But maybe not out there, right?
- Yeah.
Yeah, outside.
Yeah.
- Yeah, outside.
Okay.
What model is your camera?
Ah, it's a GoPro 9.
9?
- Yeah.
What one is yours?
I think it's...
- Let me see.
It looks like 10.
- 10.
Yeah.
- Yeah.
Okay.
- Nice.
Good luck.
- Yeah, see you, brother. You too.
Good luck with your job.
Okay, so,
that guy's here looking for work.
And he's got better camera than mine.
He's got the GoPro 10.
I'm on GoPro 9.
Okay.
You're a blogger, sir?
Yeah, I'm blogger.
What is the name of your...
- Ohhh.
- Are you gonna subscribe?
Yeah. Of course.
- Yeah, what's the name?
- Guys,
I've been in the Philippines for like 10 minutes
and I'm already getting a new subscriber.
What's the name of your...?
- What is your n...?
First you tell me your name, then I'll tell you my name.
Secret.
No!
- My name is Rose.
What is it, Rose?
Yeah, it's Rose.
- Ah, it's a beautiful name.
Like a flower.
Okay, my name is Dale.
Yeah, I saw already.
Oh, yeah, she's took it from my passport.
It's the same
- Mr. Dale.
same name for the YouTube channel,
and Facebook.
Dale?
- Ah, really?
- Yeah, YouTube or Facebook.
And TikTok, sometimes.
TikTok also?
- Sometimes TikTok.
Dale.
So the plan has been purchased,
and now she's registering the Internet.
Kinda complicated process.
She's registered my passport and everything.
I'm glad they're doing it for me.
And I don't have to do this myself.
I'd probably spend the whole evening trynna
sort this,
so it's good to do it here,
before I leave the airport.
It's your first time here in the Philippines, sir?
No, I was here 7 years ago.
Oh.
- yeah.
I've only stayed in Manila and
went to Cavite.
- Do you know how to speak some Tagalog?
No, nothing.
Why?
You must.
- All I know is "Po."
Po?
- Yeah, I can say something and then "Po."
It means "politeness," right?
Yes.
- "Respect."
Yes, sir.
Yeah.
That's all I know.
All I know is "Po."
And here they have Grab pick-up points?
Yes, sir, outside.
Ah, okay. Once I get internet, I will do Grab.
Yes.
- You think Grab is the best way, or?
Yes, sir.
It is the best way?
Ah, okay.
- It's a fixed price.
Fixed price?
Okay, I'll do that.
- Sir,
try it first, sir, before you...
- Okay, I will try it.
Before I hand you the money, I'll try it.
- Yes.
Okay.
- Yes, of course.
Let's see.
Okay, yes, it's working.
Fantastic.
- Okay.
Okay, good.
Fantastic.
Who are the people on the banknotes?
Are they famous, or?
Old presidents, or?
Old leaders or something?
Leaders, like that, yeah.
- Leaders? Ah, okay.
Okay.
They should have one with Manny Pacquiao.
They should put him on the money.
It will be good.
- Thank you, sir.
Okay.
- Okay, thank you so much.
I'm gonna order my Grab now.
Mister Dale!
Hi.
How are you?
Very good, sir.
Can we take a picture.
Hi.
Okay.
A picture. Yes, sir.
- Are you working here at the airport?
Ah, okay.
I just arrived.
Can we take a picture?
Yeah, sure. Okay.
- Yeah!
Getting a picture with the airline staff.
Hi!
- Okay.
Hi, everyone.
Hi.
Okay, who's taking the picture, me?
I'm the one taking the picture.
Hi!
Okay.
Okay, okay.
Where do you want me to stand, in the middle?
Yeah.
Okay.
- One, two, three.
????.
- There's no scammer here in the Philippines.
What's that?
There's no scammer here in the Philippines.
No scams? Okay
- Yeah.
- Yeah, no scams.
If there is, I will find him, for sure.
They always seem attracted to me.
They will find me, in fact.
I don't really go looking for them.
Thank you, sir!
- Okay.
No problem.
See you next time.
Okay, thank you.
- Bye, sir.
How about us?
- Okay.
Huh?
- How about us?
How about you?
We need your picture too.
- Oh, you need as well?
Okay.
- Yeah!
Thank you, Sir Dale.
- Okay.
No problem.
- Have a good day.
Thank you. I will
- Enjoy your stay here.
order my Grab from here.
Okay, my Grab is booked.
Thank you so much for helping me.
- Thank you, sir.
Have a nice day.
- Okay, that was nice.
She helped me set up my Grab.
Change it to the Filipino number,
and
told me which pick-up point to get,
which is right out here.
So that's good.
No need to bargain with any taxis.
I haven't seen any taxi touts around here.
I remember
the last time I came to Manila, 7 years ago,
there was tonnes of people hassling you.
"Taxi, sir. Taxi. Taxi."
Doesn't seem to be that way anymore.
I think it's more,
it's more organised, which I like.
And Grab is here.
So I'm just taking Grab.
That's what I'm used to doing.
If Grab's available, I'm taking it.
No hassle.
Here we go, Grab.
I'm looking for the pick-up point called "Grab booth."
So that's where I came out,
and the pick-up point is right here.
Hello?
You're at the pick-up point, or no?
I didn't see you, I'm looking for your number plate.
You are at departure, yes?
Ah, you want me to come to you, or you come to me?
Ah, you will go there? Okay.
I will wait, okay?
Okay.
A bit of a mix-up.
The
guy is at...
He's right above me, in fact.
So I was looking at him on the phone.
It says he's here,
and I can't see him anywhere.
And apparently, I've chosen the one for departures,
and I'm at arrivals.
So departures is right above me.
So he's literally, like, above my head.
Anyway, he said,
he said he's come to me.
I said to him, "You want me to go to you, or
vice versa?"
He's coming to me.
Yeah, it looks like he's having to do the full loop.
He's having to do, like, a big loop
all the way around,
to get back to the
area that I'm at.
Not departures, arrivals.
Ah, this is you. I see you.
Okay.
This is the man right here.
Okay.
Mr. Julito?
Yes, sir. Welcome.
- Okay.
Sorry for the mistake.
Ah, okay, sir.
It was my mistake. I'm very sorry.
Okay, sir. No problem.
- Yeah.
Yeah, going to Makati, Salcedo.
Salcedo?
Yeah, Salcedo.
Somerset Hotel.
Thank you.
Okay, thank you, brother.
Thank you, sir.
Okay, so this taxi ride was...
????.
- Hi.
It's okay.
I'll get it, it's okay.
Thank you.
This taxi ride was.
Thank you, bro.
Hello, sir. Let me...
- Hi. It's okay, I got it.
Okay.
- This taxi ride was 450 pesos.
About
$8. About $8 USD
Not too bad.
That's including the highway toll as well.
Yeah, I gave him an extra 100 as well, because
I made him do that loop at the airport.
Hello!
I'm checking in.
Oh, sweets.
What have we got here?
"Deliciosa candy. Tamarind."
- Yes, sir.
Okay.
Mr. Dale.
Yes, how did you know?
You don't even check my passport.
- I was watching your vlogs.
Oh, really? Ah, okay.
Your name is Earl?
Yes, sir.
Just like the TV show.
Yes.
You have booked a Studio Premier for 9 nights?
Yes.
- And kindly update your details here.
I think everything is correct.
- Full address and
also, we have a no-party policy,
and the property is non-smoking.
No parties?
Oh!
- Yes.
Why no parties?
They have a no-party policy.
Yes.
- It's okay.
I'm here for peace.
It's okay.
Okay.
- I'll be needing your signature
here.
- Okay.
This will be the total of your stay, sir.
Okay.
63,633.
- That's a big number.
That's a big, big number.
- Yes.
Yeah, okay.
That's for 9 nights, though.
So...
How would you like to...
- I think it works out at, like, $130 USD per night.
Yeah, I'll give you my credit card.
Okay, there you go.
I remember it works out, like,
$130 USD per night.
Hotels in Manila tend to be
kinda expensive for what you get.
Especially, I've just come from Bangkok, and
yeah, I think it's about...
Everything here is about double
of what it is in Bangkok, really.
So, yeah,
I'm gonna show you what you get for 130 bucks
here in
Manila.
I'm gonna show you what this tastes like as well.
This tamarind candy.
"Deliciosa."
Let's see if it really is "deliciosa." (Delicious.)
Hm.
Doesn't really taste like ta...
It tastes like grape.
Yeah, I think it tastes like grape.
It doesn't taste like tamarind.
It's nice, though.
Thank you. Enjoy your stay, sir.
- Okay, thank you so much. Thank you, Earl.
Have a nice stay, sir.
- Okay, thank you.
Okay.
Mmh.
I'm liking these candies.
I might grab myself
a handful to take to my room,
the next time I'm down here.
Okay, so
I'm 3102.
I think that means 31st floor.
How big is this hotel?
Oh, it's
already
here.
Oh, yeah, look at all the floors they've got.
Oh, wow, so I'm on the 2nd highest floor.
Let's see.
Oh, very fancy, isn't it?
Check it out, guys.
The artwork on the wall and all that.
Okay, 3102.
It looks like there's only eight rooms on each floor.
Hmm.
There's only three rooms on this side.
So that's good.
It means I probably...
Yeah, there's only two rooms next to each other.
So I only have one neighbour.
I'm probably only sharing a wall with one neighbour,
which is
good.
Oh, wow, I've got a kitchen!
That's something I wasn't expecting.
I can't remember booking a room with a kitchen.
I've also got
a water container.
A full,
a full,
a full water cooler!
That's kinda cool, isn't it?
Okay, I'm gonna take my bag off.
Every time I do the room tour,
I forget to take my bag off.
Okay.
I need to get some light in here.
There we go.
That's every light in the room on,
so we can properly check this place out, guys.
So what do you think?
What do you think of this place?
I think it's quite nice.
It's spacious.
Everything is clean, modern, in good condition.
There's no scuffs anywhere.
I mean, look at the carpet.
A carpet is something that would get
worn out over time.
This is in perfect condition.
Everything's very modern, fancy.
You know,
the lights, the decorations and all that.
The bed looks comfy.
Is it comfy?
Oh, it's kinda hard.
Asian style.
I'll soon get used to that.
And it looks like
they've given me a freebie here.
I think it's free anyway.
It doesn't say it's free.
It just says, "Welcome home."
I'm assuming,
if you're saying "Welcome home"
and having it on the same tray as these
"Cacao Nibs" and  "Coco Chips,"
I'm assuming that's free. So,
I'm gonna eat them as if they're free, guys.
And,
yeah, just a very, very nice room.
Comfortable.
Bed to sleep on.
Sofa to sit and chill.
Got the working desk here.
Plenty of room
for yer man's two big, strong legs
to get under that desk.
You know?
You know yer man's pet peeve, when he checks into a hotel
and he can't fit his legs under a desk.
That has happened multiple times to yer man.
Nah, not here.
Plenty of room
for the legs.
And this.
This is gonna have to get moved.
'Cause this is where I'm gonna
be sitting with my laptop.
Can I move this?
Yeah, that can get moved a bit.
But that's nice. That's...
How many litres would that be?
Like, bloody
15 litres, or 20 litres, or something.
I dunno, but it's gonna be for my whole stay.
That's good.
Normally, you get two wee bottles of water.
Two 500-ml bottles.
1-L.
And 1-L isn't enough
for one person for one day, is it? So,
yeah, we've got the big old
fridge-freezer right here.
So that's good, I can buy some ice creams
and then keep them in
the freezer.
Normally, I don't have that in a hotel.
And a big fridge.
How many cans of Coke Zero can I fit in that.
We're gonna find out.
I brought some,
I brought some goodies with me from Bangkok.
I had 40 kilos of luggage allowance
'cause I'm flying business class,
so I had to make the most of that.
Basically,
every piece of space,
I had to do the whole "extender thing" on the suitcase,
and basically use that extra space to buy
cans of juice, cans of Coke Zero, and suchlike. So,
saves me doing the minibar hunt.
Now, I get to save some time
and go straight to the swimming pool.
The swimming pool, he said, is open til 10 PM,
and it's, I think...
It's not even 9 PM yet, so I've got an hour.
Basically, I can end the day with a lovely swim.
Now, let's check out the bathroom right here.
Nice, big mirror.
Nice, big, illuminated mirror.
Again, everything in perfect condition.
Got some fancy
hand and body lotion there.
And soap.
I don't really like bars of soap.
I've actually brought some liquid soap
that I like to use.
We've got the nice, big overhead rain shower.
Look at that.
Look at
that, guys.
And the attachment as well, is pretty
powerful.
Look at that.
That looks pretty good as well. So,
got the choice of the both of them.
Fantastic.
And more fancy
shower gel, conditioner, shampoo.
Okay.
Brilliant.
Looks like that's a laundry basket there.
And,
in the full kitchen,
what do we have in this cupboard right here?
A washing machine, guys!
A washing machine.
A full...
Is it a washer/dryer?
Hmm.
I think it is.
When it has like "/," it means
that's for washing and that's for drying.
Like, you can,
you can wash 8 kilos and dry 5 kilos.
Yeah, "Dryness level," dryness level.
So it's a washer/dryer.
Fantastic.
How often do you have in a hotel?
Usually, they're making you pay for their expensive
laundry service.
No, not here. Just buy some washing powder...
In fact, do they give you washing powder?
Yeah, there's laundry detergent,
right here.
Fantastic.
Microwave.
I don't think I'm gonna use any of the...
Oh, that's an actual microwave/oven thing,
'cause it's metal.
I can actually use that as an oven.
Yeah, there's like the
cooker there. Is there more...
I thought I'd turned on every light.
Oh yeah.
Oh, there's just this one.
Yeah, there's the
stove there as well.
Yeah, I wasn't expecting this at all.
Will I use it?
I dunno.
Maybe I'll buy some eggs or something,
and then I can make myself an omelette
now and again.
But generally, when I'm travelling, I like to eat out.
I'm trying the local food every day.
Let's see.
Is there's a safe?
Is there an in-room safe for yer man's laptop?
Oh, there it is, there.
Ah, I dunno if the laptop's gonna fit in that, guy's.
Hmm.
Is it gonna fit in it at an angle?
I don't think it's gonna fit in that.
That's unfortunate.
Yeah, they've basically had to make the safe
the same size as the cupboard.
Okay, that's the first negative.
I always find something
negative about everywhere that I stay.
That's one negative,
is the...
And the price, it's a bit expensive.
But that's not just this hotel, that's Manila.
And the view from the 31st floor.
Well, it's too dark to really get a view,
but down there it looks like there's a park,
That looks like a park down there.
And it's all big buildings.
Buildings even bigger than this. So,
yeah, I'll check out the view in the morning,
but for now...
Okay, before I go to the swimming pool,
yer man's own minibar.
Let's get that fridge
filled up.
Shazam!
The minibar is complete.
Well,
maybe not for nine days that I'm gonna be here.
I don't think this is gonna last me quite nine days,
but it's gonna last me a couple of days at least.
And that's the important thing.
It's saving me some time right now.
Time that I can be using
to go for a wee swim. That is
why indeed yer man is dressed...
Who am I dressed like?
Who's yer man dressed like?
Big Hugh Hefner, that's right.
Your man always dresses up like big Hugh Hefner
when he goes for a swim.
You gotta,
you gotta get the dressing gown on, don't you?
But this is what's gonna last me
the next couple of days.
Some Sprite Z with lemon, some Coke Z,
and 7up free with fiber.
We've got the Fanta Zero,
and even Lipton lemon ice tea Zero.
Also the Milo choco bars, they're lovely.
So they are.
Milo choco bars.
What else is lovely are these protein bars.
And that's why I've got about a bloody million of them.
These come from Korea.
These choco protein bars
and the nutty ones as well.
We've got some green tea chocolate.
Your daily nuts.
You gotta have nuts on a daily.
Keep you nice and healthy.
See, it's a fairly healthy minibar this, guys.
There's, you know, there's a bit chocolate here and there.
Nuts, protein bars.
It's a balance, guys. It's a balance.
You gotta snack.
You gotta have your snacks, don't you?
But sometimes you want something a wee bit healthy.
Just a wee bit.
You don't wanna be eating Mars Bars and Snickers
for every snack, do you?
We've got some "Pretz - Tom Yum Kung" bread sticks.
These are tasty.
Got some UFO bowls noodles.
These are definitely not healthy,
but these are definitely tasty.
I had these before when I was in Indonesia.
This Nissin UFO bowls.
I don't know if they come from Japan
or Indonesia, but I was eating them when I was in Indonesia.
And I found them in the imported section in Thailand.
We've got just a bunch of granola bars,
some almonds dusted with dark chocolate.
Again, fairly healthy.
Just a wee bit,
a wee bit of dark chocolate in there as well
to give you a nice taste.
To make it feel like you're,
you're eating something tasty,
but at the same time you're getting
all the almonds with it's vitamin E and all that.
So it's, you know, a balance, guys. A balance.
And we've got the "TARO Fish Snacks."
So these are like dried fish with wheat
and they're kinda shredded.
And this one is seaweed flavour.
Some of you probably think
that sounds absolutely disgusting, but
let me tell you, those are absolutely delicious.
Yer man has eaten them quite regularly
when he's been in Thailand.
Now, yeah, time for a swim.
Let's do it.
Let's go to the pool.
And it's good that this pool is open until 10 PM.
A lot of hotels that I've been staying at,
the pool closes at just after sunset.
Like 7 PM or something.
So maybe this is an indoor pool.
We'll see.
On the 7th floor.
Hmm.
I think it's gonna be an indoor pool.
If it was gonna be an outdoor pool,
it would probably be like on the roof
or something like that, not on the 7th floor.
Kinda random.
Okay, we'll find out anyway.
Okay.
In fact, the gym is in here.
I'm gonna check this out first.
See what it's like.
Ah, that's good.
Got a cable machine, there.
And...
Ah, yeah, I've used this type of equipment before.
You can put on, like, a running trail,
and it shows you like a video of a running trail
while you're running.
It's kinda cool.
But...
Very wee, but you can definitely get a workout
in that, can't you?
I think...
This is not the way that came in,
but I think this might be a shortcut to
the swimming pool.
Yeah, there is the swimming pool, there.
And it's outdoors.
Oh, check this out, guys.
I'm getting it all to myself.
Fantastic.
Again, yer man does it.
How many times have I checked into a hotel
and I just get the whole swimming pool to myself.
Almost every time.
Let's check it from the end.
It looks like a long one.
It's very narrow, but very long.
Check this out, guys.
There you go.
Nice and long, nice and long.
That is fantastic.
I'll get a good swim in that, so I will.
A nice bit of a breeze as well,
which is surprising because,
you probably can't see, for how dark it is,
but we're surrounded by skyscrapers right here.
And this would be,
you know, a nice place to chill during the daytime.
You get a lot of shade under here.
You'll probably get shade from the buildings as well.
I'd be surprised if any sun
gets through these massive buildings,
but look, plenty of places to chill out.
This is gonna be nice.
It's gonna be a nice place to chill out.
Now, yeah.
Gotta do the
honourable thing and have a shower
before I go in the swimming pool.
I see a lot of people,
at hotel swimming pools,
they just come from the room or they come from wherever
and just jump in the pool.
You're supposed to take a shower first.
I thought that was
standard etiquette.
I just don't see an outdoor one.
Okay,
in here, I guess.
Well, guys, I just had my shower in the bathroom
and then I came back out here and discovered...
It's kinda hidden 'cause it's kinda dark,
but they do have two showers out here as well.
No worries, though,
the shower in the bathroom
had all the nice soap and everything.
Same as in the room, so that was nice.
And now,
what else is gonna be nice, is yer man's swim.
The end of a long travel day.
How much do you like a good swim?
How much do you like it after a... Well,
it wasn't really a long travel day, was it?
A 3-hour flight from
Bangkok, where I checked straight in.
Straight through security.
The flight was nice and comfortable. Straight through.
I can't say that. Straight through.
Straight through.
People always tell me,
"Try and say, purple burglar alarm."
Apparently, Scottish people can't say,
"Purple burglar alarm."
But I can say it easily.
Whenever anyone says,
"Say, purple burglar alarm," I say it.
But I can't say "Straight through."
Straight through.
Anyway, I was straight through.
Shrayed shrew security at
Manila and Bangkok,
and the flight was nice and comfortable. So,
yeah, I'm not even feeling like I had a long travel day,
actually.
It's good.
It's good when you travel business class, isn't it, guys?
Isn't it?
Aye,
it is.
Nothing else to say about that.
Okay, let's have a wee swim.
Ahhh.
Yes!
Nice and refreshing.
A wee bit on the cold side.
I don't think this is heated at all.
I don't think it's heated, but it's Manila, isn't it?
It's a hot city, so,
yeah, just a wee bit cold.
Just enough to refresh yer man.
Make him feel good.
Make him feel ready for adventures in Manila.
And tomorrow,
am I gonna have an adventure tomorrow?
Well, probably not an adventure,
but I think I'm gonna
have a wee look around this Makati area
where I'm staying.
This is kinda like a fancy area of Manila.
Everything's very clean, modern, etc.
Kinda like this hotel, you know?
So I don't how adventures it's gonna be, but
I'm gonna continue this vlog
tomorrow.
A wee trip around Makati, guys.
A wee trip around this fancy area of Manila.
Ohhh.
Yes!
And it's the next day, guys.
Almost the next evening, in fact.
It's 5 PM already.
So, when yer man woke up this morning,
it was raining, so
he just went back to sleep,
and now he's out and about, finally.
The rain has stopped.
Just a few puddles around, but
this is the park that is right outside my hotel,
that I can see from my window.
So, where is my hotel?
Oh, that's it, there.
Maybe you can see through the trees.
The Somerset.
And this looks like it's a wee dog park.
Lot's of people
taking their wee doggies for walks.
Very nice.
Yeah.
Some people exercising.
And
according to Google Maps,
this is a weekend market as well, so...
I dunno where they would put the stalls.
Maybe it's in the grass, or what? But,
according to Google Maps, this is a weekend market.
Nothing much going on right now, though.
I'm heading down to an area called "Greenbelt."
Some kind of...
Well, it says it's a mall,
but it looks like a park on Google Maps.
It's all green and stuff.
So I think it's like a semi-outdoor mall,
that's like a park area, and like, yeah,
semi-open-air mall, something like that.
Looks kinda nice.
But yeah, check out the area that I'm staying in.
It's very nice and clean.
Lots of trees.
Lots of
condos, skyscrapers and stuff.
Very clean.
Looks very safe as well.
Just the types of people that you're seeing around,
look like,
I dunno, more of your,
more of your high-class
people, you know? So,
yeah,
this is the area. Makati.
The last time I stayed in Manila,
I stayed in the area called Malate, which was...
There was a lot more action.
There was a lot of street food, and things like that.
More of my kinda area, but this is nice as well.
It's nice to relax.
It's nice to, look, walk on
nice, clean pavements like this, you know?
You can walk,
you can check your phone.
You can talk to your GoPro
without worrying about tripping up.
There's no obstacles,
No beggars grabbing you.
No potholes that you're gonna stick your feet into.
It's all good.
It's all good. So,
yeah, I'll be staying in this area,
and then going for adventures, maybe sometimes
to other areas. Some,
you know, big markets and suchlike.
But for now, I'm going to
the big
fancy shopping mall-type place.
Greenbelt.
Looks like this guy's gonna help us cross the road.
Or is he?
Waiting?
Crossing?
No!
Underpass.
Not crossing?
Yes.
This one is only for priority.
Huh? Only for priority?
- Priority.
Wheelchair?
- Yeah.
Ah, okay.
I need to take the next one.
Okay, thank you.
Okay.
So he won't let me cross the road.
It looks like the women are getting to cross.
He said it's only for priority.
I don't get it. Okay.
He's telling me to go away,
but all of them are waiting.
Are foreigners not allowed, or wherever?
It seems like just ordinary Filipino
girls and men are, like,
waiting to cross the road, but I'm not allowed to,
for some reason.
I need to be on the other side of the road.
Hopefully, there's a way across here.
Yeah, I don't see another way across.
I'm trynna go down that way there.
Down that street,
but there's no way across.
That's crazy.
That's crazy how he won't let me cross the road there.
I don't understand.
Oh, I think this is...
Is it a metro station or something?
Yeah, it looks like I can get down there
and across anyway, so
it's probably better.
Okay, so this is the mall here.
You see here, it says Greenbelt 5.
I think there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
It's all split into sections, and in the middle
is this green area that's like a park.
There's kinda open air restaurants and stuff.
Very nice.
What else is gonna be very nice,
is some air conditioning.
I'm going for the fully indoor bit, guys.
It doesn't look like it's very hot, does it?
The sun's not out or anything.
It's just so humid.
So, so humid.
Okay, I gotta get through security.
Hopefully, they're not gonna make me wear a mask.
Hi, brother.
It's okay?
Okay, good.
That's nice, straight through.
They don't care about the camera.
Do you guys remember
when I was trying to go into malls in India
with my GoPro? Oh.
The hassle I was getting from security guards.
"Turn that camera off!"
Ohhh, a camera.
Oh, no.
What's he gonna do with his camera?
No, here, you just walk straight in.
It's nice.
No mask as well.
That's,
that's something that I was worried about
when I was coming to the Philippines,
the whole mask thing.
But it looks like we're all good.
Everything's normal, guys.
Everything's normal.
Look, even the locals,
even the locals are not wearing masks.
So it's all good.
And yer man,
enjoying some air conditioning.
I would like to enjoy some Filipino food.
"Fely J's."
That sounds like it's maybe...
That's Filipino food, Fely J's?
Pinoy food?
Yeah, Filipino food.
This one, Fely J's?
Ah, okay.
What is the best one in this mall?
Here.
Oh this one?
- Japan, Japanese.
Oh, Japanese? I'm looking Pinoy, Pinoy.
Pinoy?
Pinoy. Only this, Fely J's?
- Yes.
Ah, okay.
Maybe I'll go there. I'll have a look around, and come back.
Thank you, bro. Thank you.
Ah, okay, so that is...
Oh, yeah, it says here.
"Filipino and Asian home cooking."
Okay.
I'm worried.
I walked past a security guard,
he give me a wee look, didn't say anything.
So I guess cameras are allowed.
That looks like it's Chinese.
Yeah, the first vlog in the Philippines,
we gotta be eating Pinoy food, don't we?
Another one that looks also
like Japanese, I think.
Although the name is "Honolulu."
But it's got like Japanese or Korean
symbols.
I dunno.
But, yeah, at least I've got a plan, that Fely J's.
If I don't find anything else,
I'll go there for something to eat.
I'm just kinda wandering around,
soaking up the AC, right now, guys.
It's all good.
Check this place out.
This mall's nice.
It's not too busy. Look, you can,
you can freely walk around in peace.
Looks like an art gallery there.
This is good. So,
yeah, like I said, there's different sections.
This is Greenbelt 5,
and there's just different sections like this,
with the park in the middle.
Maybe we can see it from here.
Yeah, the window.
Yeah, right there.
That is the green area.
Looks like these guys are gonna be doing some live music.
There's another cafe down there.
That looks like Pinoy food as well.
Maybe I'll go and check that out.
Some kinda exhibition for dresses.
Okay, let's check this place out.
"Cibo."
I think it's Pinoy food.
"Spaghetti." No, that's Italian.
I think it's just international.
Yeah, I think it's just international food.
Yeah, pasta and stuff.
Italiano?
Yeah.
- Italian food? Ah, okay.
I'm looking Pinoy food.
I'm looking for Pinoy food.
Is there a good one here in the mall?
Pinoy food?
- I'm sorry?
For Pinoy food?
I've seen one, Feny J's.
Feny J's.
Only Feny J's is the best one for Pinoy food?
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you. Okay.
Italiano.
This is
Italiano food right there.
That's the thing.
Like, when you're in these fancy malls,
you never find the local food.
Hello.
- It's like that in Thailand.
Hey, how are you?
I'm good.
What's your name?
I'm Fred.
I am watching your video.
Really? Ah, okay.
Watch this one.
Watch this one here and give it a thumbs up.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Good.
- Okay.
I'm trynna find some Pinoy food,
but it's all international food here, right?
Yeah, this one is...
- When Filipinos come to the mall,
they want, like, Japanese, Italian.
- There's a lot of Filipino dish there.
Like that one. Filipino...
- The Feny J's?
Yeah.
- Yeah, I was thinking about that.
I'm gonna have a walk around,
and maybe that's what I will end up eating.
The Feny J's.
Yeah.
- So you're here eating
Japanese, right?
This is one is Hong Kong.
Hong Kong? Oh, yeah, the Hong Kong style.
Ah, okay.
Yeah, I'm just looking.
This is my first day in the Philippines,
so I'm looking for Pinoy food.
- Nice meeting you.
You too, bro.
I will watch that.
- And thumbs up?
Okay, thumbs up.
Never forget the thumbs up, guys.
Never forget the thumbs up.
Okay, so,
yeah, I was saying it's like that in Thailand.
You go to a mall in Thailand,
there'll be like one or two Thai restaurants,
but like 80-90%
it'll be Japanese and international, you know?
That's the thing. It's like,
the locals, they're used to eating their own food
in local places, at home and stuff.
When they come to a fancy mall, they want...
What they consider fancy is like
international, you know?
Like, imported stuff.
Australian beef steak and, you know,
Japanese
ramen bowls, and sushi, and
Hong Kong rice.
All that kinda stuff.
Okay.
I think I'm gonna end up at that
Fanny J's.
I'm just soaking up more AC first.
Oh, there's a Pepper Lunch.
That's one of yer man's favourite
places in Asia.
I eat there a lot when I'm in Thailand,
Indonesia, and Japan.
It actually comes from Japan.
It's like a...
Kinda like a steak restaurant,
but they serve it to you sizzling on like a plate.
On like a hot plate.
It's nice, it's cheap, and it always hits the spot,
guys, Pepper Lunch. But
not today.
Not today.
It's Pinoy food for yer man, isn't it?
Look at this.
Nice and, nice and quiet.
I think this is where I started, actually.
Hm, okay.
So this is the directory just for Greenbelt 5.
Look how many shops and restaurants there are.
These are all the restaurants, here.
So this is just one of the,
I think it's five,
I think five sections.
It's absolutely huge.
Looks like a fancy Chinese restaurant up there.
Okay.
I think I've soaked up enough of the air conditioning.
I'm gonna...
I think it's on this level.
I'm gonna go to that Feny J's.
Hello, sir!
Hi, how are you?
Yeah, I'm good.
- Good.
Yeah, Dale, Dale Philip?
- I'm going, I'm going...
Yeah?
- Yeah, Dale Philip.
Yeah.
- I'm going to eat Filipino food now.
Ah, yeah, downstairs.
- Yeah.
Feny J's, right?
- Jollibee.
Jollibee?!
- Yeah.
Oh, they got Jollibee here?
- Yeah.
I know you ate Jollibee.
Yeah, I had in Dubai.
But I've never had in Philippines.
I need to try.
Ah, you want to try?
No, but now I want to eat sisig.
I'm gonna go to...
- Ah, sisig?
Yeah, sisig.
You think... There's only one
Pinoy restaurant I've found, Feny J's.
Baksilog.
Baksilog? Ah.
- Yeah, but already closed now.
Ahhh, okay.
Yeah.
Most of this mall is like Japanese and
Japanese?
- and Hong Kong and stuff.
I will eat the Filipino, though.
I'm determined.
Ah.
Determined.
What are you doing here? You're working here?
Yeah, yeah, Ogawa.
Ogawa? What is Ogawa?
Yeah.
Oh, this is like massage chairs and stuff.
- Yeah. Yeah.
Can I try?
- Yeah, yeah.
Yes.
- Okay, I'm gonna get a try.
Yes.
- I'm gonna get a free massage.
Yeah.
- Yeah?
I saw your vlogs many times.
Really? Ah, okay.
- Yeah.
Can I put your shop in my vlog?
Yeah.
- Okay, so it's massage chairs?
Yes, sir.
Ah, okay.
- It's for massage.
Very fancy.
Wow.
And do people rent these, or they buy them?
Yeah.
- For their home?
- ????.
We're selling.
They selling too.
- Hi, how are you?
Hello.
- Okay.
I've just come to check out your massage chairs.
Yes.
- Okay, so people buy them for their home?
Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.
Yeah.
I sometimes see these in the malls.
You can put in some money
and have, like 5 minutes, 10 minutes, and stuff,
but these are ones you buy for your house.
Okay, what is the best one?
This one, sir, it's the
Master Drive AI.
Artificial Intelligence.
- It has AI?
That is a voice command.
So you can get...
Oh, voice commands?
So you can say, like, "Massage my calves,"
Yeah.
- or something.
It will do it?
Ah, okay.
Okay.
Can I try it, or no?
It's not for trying?
- Yeah, you can try.
I can try?
Just,
remove your shoes.
Shoes, yeah? Just the shoes? Okay.
Take the shoes off.
Okay.
"Master Drive AI."
Only
500,000.
500,000 pesos. ($9,070 USD.)
I don't even know how much that is.
I think that's like,
like $10,000 bucks or something?
Yeah, like, like $9,000.
$9,000 USD.
Okay, so what happens?
This turns it on.
So I'm just kinda reclining.
Feels like I'm in an aeroplane, business class.
That's what it feels like.
Very nice.
- And you can put your hands here.
Ah, wow.
- Inside.
I put inside?
Ah, okay, so it massages my hands.
Okay, well, only one of my hands is gonna get massaged
'cause I'm vlogging.
So...
Oh, wow.
And what's this? This for your phone or something?
You can keep...
Oh, it's squeezing my knees.
- Yeah, for your phone or tablet.
Ah, so you can watch while you...
- For the controller.
Yeah.
Oh, so my back is getting kneaded.
It's like kneading my back.
And then it's squeezing my knees.
Yeah.
So this is like air pressure or something?
It's like inflating?
- Yeah...
Ah, yeah, and there's, like, something that's like a...
It feels like if you get a massage and they're like,
using their fist to, like, do your back.
That's what it feels like there.
Yeah.
And it's hot as well.
Heated?
Yes, it keeps you nice and warm.
- Yeah.
Ohhh.
And the bottom of my feet, it's like...
There's like a ball that's like,
again, like the fist on the bottom of your feet.
Oh, everything is getting done at once.
Ohhh!
And it's,
it's really getting into the back.
This is good.
They should have these on aeroplanes in business class.
Can you imagine that,
if they had something like this?
And it's all warm,
you know?
It's like if you have, like, a heated car seat
or something like that.
It's...
Oh, good.
Oh, yeah, now it's squeezing, like, here.
It's squeezing here.
So this...
Yeah.
So many
things, and
what about the voice control?
How can I do that, the voice control?
Just say, "Hey, Ogawa."
Hey, Ogawa?
- "I'm here."
Ah.
Hey, Ogawa, massage my bum.
"I'm here."
No. It's not massaging my bum.
Hey, Ogawa, massages my ass.
"I'm here."
It can do, or no?
Eh, you just say first "Hey Ogawa,"
- Your butt?
then you
- Yeah?
- "I'm here."
wait for that response.
Ahhh, okay.
- And then you command.
Ah.
Hey, Ogawa.
"I'm here."
Massage my butt.
"????."
Oh!
Okay.
It's tilted me this way.
Okay.
I don't think it's massaging my butt.
There's no massage for your butt, no?
Eh, it's...
Oh, yeah it is! It's getting!
Oh, right in the base of my back.
It's moving down the rollers.
Yeah, I can feel it.
Oh!
Oh ho ho ho ho ho.
It's...
Oh, yeah, it's got it!
It's right...
It's totally massaging my ass.
So the rollers, like, came down
from, like, the base of the back,
and then it's just like massaging...
Oh ho ho ho.
This is good.
Oh, yeah.
This is good.
I want one of these.
I want one of these things.
Only...
- Dale, I've subscribed.
Only, only 500,000 pesos, right?
Yes, sir, but right now, we have a discount.
Yeah?
- From 499,000,
you can avail it for only 300...
20?
- 30.
330.
- 330? Ah, okay.
So 330...
I'm trynna convert to dollars.
That is like, like $6,000.
Yes.
Ah, okay.
- Like that. Something like that.
Yeah.
I think it's worth it, if you've got the money.
If you've got the money and you've got, like,
a home to put it.
Unfortunately, I don't have anywhere to put it.
Oh, yeah. It's, like, got a real grip.
I can't even take my arm out now.
It's got, like, a grip on it.
So, yeah.
It will not take long, so
- Yeah.
just a seconds to release.
- Ah, okay.
That's good,
that I can just tell it to massage my butt,
and it just started massaging my butt.
That's so good.
Can you imagine you're like here.
You're just, like, watching TV or whatever,
and you just feel like
you want your butt massaged.
Just say, "Hey, Ogawa."
Hey, Ogawa.
"I'm here."
Massage my neck.
"Alright, right away."
All right, right away.
Okay, so she's putting down my...
Of course it's a girl.
She's putting down my feet,
and now we're gonna,
we're gonna get the neck.
Here we go.
So, nothing is happening just now.
Just moving position.
Oh, yeah it is still massaging my feet and stuff.
Oh, now I can feel the rollers going all the way up my back.
???? this
thing.
This thing here?
- Yeah.
You'll feel it then.
- Ah, okay.
More the pressure.
- Yeah, I feel it more.
Yeah, it's very hard.
It's like,
you imagine, like, some snooker balls or something.
That's what you're getting massage by,
these rollers.
Oh, yeah.
That's good.
It's right,
right, just,
just under my neck, right there.
Just where you want it to get massaged.
Like, right there, your traps, basically.
Your traps.
Oh, yeah.
That's good.
And how long do people normally sitting on it for?
Like, 30 minutes, or?
Eh, this model is maximum 30 minutes
of time, yeah.
- Maximum, uh?
Oh, then it will turn off?
In case they fall asleep or something, then.
Yeah.
- After 30 minutes if will automatically turn off.
But the,
- Ah.
the last position in the sequence, that is still...
Like, for example, it was reclined.
Yeah.
- So it not automatically
back to the original position.
Like, setting position.
- Yeah.
So, like, if you are sleeping.
So it will not disturb.
Ah, sleeping. It will just turn off,
but it will stay in the same position,
Yeah, yeah.
- so you can just sleep.
Yeah.
- Oh it's vibrating now.
It's like, "dddddddddd," on the back of my neck.
"Dududududududu."
- It has, sir, 22 massage programs
and then 500 customisable options.
So you can do everything.
- Ah, yeah.
Okay.
- Like, you can feel the
massage like a human touch.
Ohhh.
- ????
Yeah, it's good.
I like it.
Okay, hey, Ogawa.
"I'm here."
Stop.
"End massage."
End massage.
"Sure."
Okay, I'd like to go on for longer, but I'm hungry.
I'm...
I came here to eat Filipino food,
and instead I got Filipino AI chair massage.
But it's good.
Thank you so much for that, guys.
That was awesome.
Ah, sorry, we have, also the
portable back massager.
It's a portable one?
- Yeah.
If you want, you can bring that anywhere.
Ah, right. You can take that on an aeroplane,
or in a car, or something.
- Yeah.
Yeah, this one.
You can put it around your chair.
Any kind of chair.
- Oh, these ones here?
Ah, okay.
- Also reclining.
Bed, sofa.
- Ah, right, and it's
even got a bit for your feet.
- This one in, you can use this in your car.
Are you selling many of these?
Yes, sir.
- Like every day someone is buying, or?
What is normal?
- In a day, it's one, two. But...
Some days different?
Yeah.
- Some days, one or two.
Some day, no.
- Yes.
Like that?
- Yeah, yeah.
Ah, okay.
It's good.
And you guys, do you get commission,
or it's just like you get salary, or?
How does it work for you guys?
Yeah, we've got commission.
- Oh, you get commission as well?
Ah, it's good.
So if you're selling a lot then you are also a benefiting?
Yeah, yeah.
- That's good.
Yeah, that's a good type of, good type of job.
Okay, guys, I'm gonna go down to eat sisig now.
Yes, sir.
- Okay.
Oh, I need to get my...
I took my wallet and everything out,
so it wouldn't get damaged.
Yeah.
- Almost left without that.
Yeah, my phone, my GoPro batteries and my wallet.
Okay, I need these.
Okay.
Okay, good.
- Okay, sir.
Okay. I'll see you another time.
- If you want some portable,
we also have a promotion.
- Ahhh, okay.
I'm...
Luggage problem.
I'm travelling around.
No, that's all very light.
- Yeah.
Only, I think,
1.5 kilo, that one.
- Yeah.
Portable.
- Okay, I will think about it.
Maybe.
When my back is sore, maybe then I will think about it.
Okay?
Thank you.
Thank you, so much, guys.
- Yes, sir.
Bye-bye.
- Okay.
That was nice.
Unexpected massage.
I just kinda invited myself in
and then invited myself for a massage.
Thank you.
Okay, I'm going...
Oh, yeah, I was going...
This is why I was here.
I was coming down these escalators.
Yeah.
I like that.
Okay, here we are.
Hello.
- Hi.
Filipino food?
Yes.
- You have sisig?
We have.
- Oh, yeah, that's what I'm looking for, sisig.
Ah, table for one?
- Okay.
Table for one, please.
Can I sit...? Okay, thank you.
Okay, good.
First Filipino meal of the trip.
Some sisig.
There is a picture menu.
Oh, a picture menu, that's good.
- Sisig.
This is the sisig here?
Sizzling sisig.
Ah, okay.
And what should I order with the sisig?
Some vegetables, or?
- Like,
if you want, the fresh wok veggies, this one.
Yeah, sisig and...
- Sisig and
"Fresh wok veggies."
We have this one, broccoli and shiitake mushroom.
- This goes with the sisig?
Ah, okay.
Okay, I will take those two and something to drink.
- Any rice?
Do you want rice for your meal, sir?
So rice goes with sisig as well, yes?
Doesn't come with rice.
Doesn't come with it?
But is good with rice, or?
Yes.
- Ah, okay.
Yes, rice as well.
- One plain rice.
Yeah, plain rice.
- Some drinks?
And drinks...
We have here.
- Let's see.
I will take
- ????.
the ripe mango, please.
Ripe mango drink?
- Yeah.
Okay.
- Thank you.
That sounds good.
Some sisig, rice, fresh veggies and
fresh mango.
Fantastic.
Looks like they've got "Lamb Kaldereta" as well.
It's like a, Kaldereta is like a stew.
That looks lovely.
Ho-ho.
Okay.
Food is ready, sir.
Okay, good.
Oh, it's a lot.
Did I order that much?
Okay, this is the sisig here.
This is the sizzling sisig.
- Oh, it's sizzling.
Oh, it's sizzling s... Yeah, it is sizzling.
- Sizzling.
It's like when you go to Pepper Lunch
and you get the sizzling plate.
Yes. This is the fresh wok veggies.
- Okay.
Okay, nice.
- Shiitake mushroom and broccoli.
And the rice.
Okay. Thank you.
- Enjoy your meal, sir.
So, this sisig right here,
what it is,
is chopped pork.
It's chopped pork belly, jowls and ears, apparently,
and some chopped chicken liver mixed in there as well.
You can see, like, different colours. So,
I've eaten sisig once before,
but it was in Dubai, so it wasn't pork.
It was made with beef, I think. So,
I've had it and I like it,
but it wasn't the authentic one. So,
this is the authentic one right here, the,
the pork.
Yum, yum.
Okay, guys, so,
it's served like this, rather than on a plate,
I think, because
people share their food in this part of the world, you know?
When Filipinos go out for a meal,
maybe they'll order like 3 or 4 different things,
between, maybe, 5 or 6 people,
or maybe between a few people,
and they'll just share everything
Like, somebody'll take a couple of spoonfuls of the sisig,
couple of spoonfuls of something else.
Me,
I'm eating the lot of this myself.
That is half a plate's worth of sisig right there.
And some rice, right there.
And the veggies.
Looks like it's in some sort of gravy.
Yeah, I think it's...
I think it's a fish gravy.
I think it's a fish gravy. (x2)
I'm using the serving spoon to taste it,
but like I said, I'm the only one eating, so
I'm allowed to do that.
I can even eat from this if I want to.
Yum, yum.
Okay, let's try the sisig.
There we go.
All this chopped meat. You can see the different colours.
It's all over the table.
I haven't even had my first mouthful,
and it's all over the table,
guys, but...
Okay, let's just stick it in my mouth.
Oh.
Oh, wow!
Oh, yeah.
That's better than the one I had in Dubai, for sure.
Oh, man.
It tastes like,
it tastes like really fatty, juicy bacon.
That's what it tastes like.
And it's really well-seasoned.
And very salty, very,
very seasoned.
Crispy on the outside.
As you can see, it's been sizzling.
So it's like, there's all these crispy bits,
but it's all soft, and fatty, and chewy in the inside
of each of these little chunks.
Oh, my God!
That's amazing.
Yeah, and, like, the nearest taste is just,
just bacon. Like,
bacon with seasoning.
With a strong seasoning.
Mmh.
Oh.
So, guys, I thought I had sisig before. I didn't have sisig.
Whatever I had in Dubai, it wasn't sisig.
It was just chopped beef.
It was just bits of chopped beef.
This is something else.
Something else entirely.
Mmh.
Mmh.
Mmh. (x2)
Oh, yeah.
So there's one red pepper there.
I'm not gonna have that.
It's not spicy. It's not chili-hot,
I guess, unless you chew into that.
But, yeah, other than the pork,
there's chopped onions through it, that I can see.
Chopped onions and that's about it.
A fairly simple thing.
They just chop up some pork and some chicken liver,
season it.
Then it gets
fried, sizzled,
and then it gets stuck in Dale's mouth.
Yum, yum, yum.
Oh.
That bacon taste, guys, that bacon taste. Yum, yum.
Mmh.
It might be easier eating this with the spoon, in fact, so...
Every time I get a forkful, bits fall off
'cause they're little chinks.
Maybe if I just scoop up a spoonful.
Oh, yeah.
That's better.
Mmh.
Oh.
Mmh.
Mmh. (x2)
Mmh. (x3)
Guys, that sisig lasted about 2 minutes on my plate.
I haven't even really touched the side dish,
the vegetables and the rice and stuff.
I just demolished that sisig.
I feel bad about the bits that are on the table now.
Yeah, I could eat another plate of that.
But,
yeah, I will eat another plate of that at some point.
I'm sure I'll be back
here or in other Pinoy restaurants, eating sisig again.
Fantastic.
And a nice, fresh mango juice to wash it down with.
They do give you a paper straw,
which is kind of annoying, but
otherwise, I'm very happy.
Very happy about this meal. Yum, yum.
So guys, I've gone from
eating delicious chopped pork belly,
bacon, basically, to
eating broccoli and rice.
But, it's all good.
You gotta stay healthy, haven't you?
You've gotta get the broccoli inside you.
It's "991," okay.
1,000 pesos, basically.
It's about 18 bucks US.
Kind of expensive for the Philippines.
For Filipino food.
For some sisig, and vegetables, and rice.
And a fresh mango juice.
I don't know how much that would cost
in, like, a very basic type of restaurant, you know?
Out on the streets, away from this fancy area.
I dunno.
Maybe, like, $6.
Maybe a third the price. But,
yeah, when you're in a fancy mall,
it's never gonna be that cheap, is it?
But definitely worth it.
That was 18 bucks well spent, for sure, guys.
Feeling fantastic right now.
Okay, so
I think I'm gonna go to another mall, actually.
There is something I've been hearing about.
Hello.
- Hi, how are you?
Where are you from?
I like your videos.
I'm from New Zealand.
New Zealand? Ah, wow.
You're normally in India, aren't you?
Yeah, I've been, I've been around.
So you're vlogging now?
- And now, now in the Philippines.
Yeah, I just had the,
just had some sisig.
Ah, yeah.
- Have you tried it?
Yeah.
- Oh, it's amazing.
Yeah, I've been here 4 years.
- It's like, it's like...
Oh, you've been here a while?
Ah, okay.
- Yeah.
What's, what's the best Pinoy food, you think?
Non-Pinoy food?
Yeah.
Anything but.
Anything, really?
Ah, you don't like it?
You...
- Not the street food, no.
Ah, okay.
Yeah.
- The restaurants are good.
Yeah, I just had sisig.
It was a nice clean restaurant.
Yeah.
- 'Cause we're in an, obviously, in a fancy mall.
So this is the place to try it.
Yeah, it's okay here.
- You're not gonna get food,
you're gonna get food poisoning or anything in the mall.
Like, eating it here, yeah.
- No, you can eat it here.
Alright.
So this...
- No. If you go to the good Filipino restaurants,
it's nice, but I'm not keen on the street food here.
Ah, okay. You just don't...
Don't really like it here, to be honest.
You... Yeah.
- You don't risk it for, like, the hygiene?
Yeah.
- Hygiene reasons? Ah, okay.
But here in the mall...
- Would you risk it?
Yeah.
- I don't mind.
She doesn't mind.
This your family?
Yeah. Yeah.
- Ah, okay.
So you're living here in Manila, or?
- Yeah, for now.
Yeah.
- Ah, okay. Good.
Yeah.
Fantastic, yeah.
Keep up the blogs, yeah? I'm watching them.
- Nice to... Yeah, nice to see you guys. Okay.
Enjoy the food.
- Okay, that's good.
Yeah, so...
Yeah,
this guy has been living here 4 years,
and he doesn't dare do the street foods.
So maybe that tells you something.
It's like...
Yeah.
My friend in India, who was actually an Indian guy,
he didn't dare risk the street food there,
and he was Indian, he was actually an Indian living in India.
But I don't know, it's tempting, guys.
It's tempting, the street food.
You're walking down the street,
you smell some delicious smell,
you just wanna try something.
Anyway, I dunno why I came up the stairs.
I don't know. I think I was just...
'Cause I was wanting to talk to that guy.
I'm actually thinking about heading to another mall.
There's like, some other mall.
I don't think it's actually in the Makati area,
but it's in an area next to Makati, called
Bonifacio Global City.
BGC.
And it's like Venice.
Apparently it's, like, a mall like Venice,
where they've got, like, canals and everything like that.
You can take, like, a gondola ride and stuff.
So that's where I'm thinking about
going and checking out right now.
It looks like it's sunset.
I don't think we'll see...
I don't think we'll see a sun set, guys,
'cause it was very cloudy.
Yeah, so it's sunset time,
but we don't get to see a sunset.
Anyway, I need to find somewhere where
I can get, like, a Grab or something like that.
'Because I think it is like...
If I try and walk it, it's gonna be like an hour or something. So,
gonna find somewhere I can get Grab
to get out of here and go to the BGC.
Okay, I think this is just taking me outside
into the central park area.
I'm not gonna get Grab from there.
Ah.
Ah, so I think it's different sections.
This is a section for bars and restaurants.
These are all kinda like outdoor,
outdoor bars and stuff, here.
Hey, YouTuber.
- Hi, how are you,
Mr. Grab driver?
Where can I get a Grab taxi?
This way, yeah?
Yeah, I'm gonna go to BGC now.
I see you in,
in Facebook, in
- In Facebook? Ah, okay.
Dubai, Indonesia.
And now in Manila.
Yeah.
Okay.
Give me thumbs up, bro, when you see.
Okay, thank you.
Yeah.
Your name?
Ralph.
Ralph?
- Shout out, Ralph.
Okay.
Thumbs up, Ralph.
I see you, your video in Indonesia.
- Thumbs up for Ralph.
Many...
- Indonesia? Yeah.
Before here I was in Indonesia.
- Ah, yes.
Yeah, now in Manila.
Good luck, bro.
- Okay, thank you, bro.
Thank you.
Okay.
So...
Hi.
This... I need to get a Grab taxi, outside?
Go down, sir. Eh, go straight.
Straight?
- Go straight.
Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay, thank you, brother.
Okay.
Let's go get a Grab taxi out here.
Okay, so I'm looking for a good pickup point for
my Grab,
and how about here?
"King Philip."
King Philip, right here.
Yer man, Dale Philip,
will wait outside the King Philip store, and
get a Grab. Surely a Grab can stop here and pick me up.
Okay, that's where I'm gonna use for my pickup point.
Okay, Grab is coming.
It says he's making one stop first,
so he's gonna drop somebody off down there,
and then come back for me.
And it's gonna take
9 minutes.
So,
I'm gonna be waiting around here for 9 minutes, guys.
Is there anything,
any shop for me to go to and get some juice, or?
Oh, it looks like that's a 7-Eleven right there.
Okay.
I'll jaywalk across the road and get myself a wee drink.
Ah, look, they've got Vanilla
Coke Zero right here.
Vanilla Coke Z.
Never tried this before.
Fantastic.
I used to like, when I was a kid, having
ice cream in my Cola.
Make a Cola float.
Oh, okay.
Just this one.
42.
42, okay.
One, two, three, four, five...
Thank you po.
Thanks.
Okay.
Vanilla Coke Z.
Oh, thank you po.
Okay.
That's the only word of...
The only word of Tagalog I know is "Po."
It's like saying...
I guess it's like, saying "Krup" in Thailand.
It just adds politeness to the word.
I think specifically in Philippines, it means, like, "Respect."
It means like, "I respect you."
Anyway, King Philip over there,
that's where I'm getting picked up.
Gonna stand there and drink Vanilla Coke Z.
Ahhh.
How are you?
Good.
I'm going to BGC now.
I'm just waiting...
- Oh, BGC?
Yeah, just waiting for my Grab.
- Ohhh.
Wait.
- He's coming in one minute.
Just wait there.
Oh, we're getting a selfie?
What are you doing?
Eh, I'm going out and drive.
This is your bike?
Yes, sir.
- It looks powerful.
Yes, sir.
- How many CCs?
Oh,
only 125, only.
It's only 125?!
Oh, but it looks powerful.
Okay.
Thank you.
- Okay, no worries.
See you, bro, see you.
Okay.
- Dale, be careful.
Huh?
- Be careful.
Be careful? Okay, I will be careful.
- Okay.
Thank you.
Okay.
Very considerate.
Okay.
I think that's the be...
That's the way to get around, actually, is on bike,
in this Manila traffic.
When you have, like, all these cars,
the bike can just go through the middle.
It can just filter through.
You know?
And this, a popular form of transport in Manila.
Look how packed it is.
Guy's hanging off the back.
That's called a "jeepney."
It's like a,
a converted Jeep made into like a bus, basically.
And they all have like, set routes.
You can't just flag it down and say,
"Hey, I wanna go there."
"I wanna go there."
Like,
locals will know by the number,
like, what route it takes.
Just like the songthaews in Thailand.
If you ever travelled in a songthaew in Thailand,
it's like that.
They're very cheap but they have a set route.
Ah, I don't need.
Thank you. Thank you, brother.
Okay, so
my taxi should be coming this way.
Okay, thank you.
Bye.
Okay.
So he just called me to say sorry.
He's been in this traffic jam for about 10 minutes.
I think he's almost here.
I crossed the road.
King Philip left his castle and crossed the road because,
yeah, otherwise he's gonna have to do a U-turn,
and that's gonna be more of a nightmare.
He's already been waiting.
It said 1 minute on Grab, and that was like 10,
maybe even 15 minutes ago.
Yeah, he's just on the other side of those traffic lights there.
But,
he was at these traffic lights right here,
like 10-15 minutes ago.
That's just one street.
It's taken like 15 minutes to
go down.
I don't even think this is the heaviest traffic area of Manila.
But it is...
these guys here are just pressing on the...
They're just pressing on the,
the horn
Wow!
- Dale Philip!
Hi, how are you?
Hello!
- Hi. What is your name?
My name's Paul.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
I see you...
- The traffic is really bad today, right?
Rush hour.
What?
Rush hour.
Yeah, it's normal.
- Yeah, traffic.
It's normal? Ah, okay.
He says it's normal.
My car is this colour, but it's not this car, I think.
NCF.
Let me check, in fact. Let me check
if this is my car.
No, it's not this one.
I think he's still stuck at those traffic lights.
Yeah.
It's like
just after 6:30 PM,
so it's rush hour, guys.
This place, this BGC place,
where the Venice Mall is,
it was supposed to take an hour by walking,
so that's why I was like,
"Okay, I'll get a 10-15 minute taxi."
But it looks like
I probably would have been faster walking, to be honest.
I probably would have been faster walking.
Look at this.
Nothing is moving.
Oh, here it is.
"NCF 2264."
Okay, this is my, my guy here.
It was supposed to be a red car or maroon.
This looks like black.
Okay, I wonder if I can get in the...
Can I come in here?
Okay.
Friendly-style.
Okay.
Traffic is really bad, right?
- Yes, sir.
Okay.
- Traffic, sir.
Bad traffic, Manila traffic.
Everyday like this?
Eh, yes, sir.
In rush hour, sir.
Yeah.
So I'm going to Venice.
Yes, sir. Yeah.
- Yeah, Venice Canal.
What's it called, Venice Canal Mall?
Sorry?
- Yeah. It's called...
Name for this place, Venice Canal Mall,
or something like that, right?
Yes.
Yeah.
- It's a nice place, sir.
It's nice? Okay, good.
- Yeah.
Eh, it's look like, eh, Spain?
Like Spain? Like Italy.
Ah, Italy, yes.
- Yeah, Venice.
Yes, sir.
Okay.
"Venice Piazza."
Okay.
Okay, thank you, sir.
- Fantastic.
Thank you so much, brother.
Thank you.
Okay, sir. Thank you, sir.
- Okay, so,
because I have my
credit card linked to the Grab app,
I don't have to mess around with cash in these situations.
It's like,
it just comes straight off my credit card.
Okay, this is the Venice Canal Mall.
I don't see any canal, guys.
Hello. How are you?
- Hello.
Good evening.
- Hi.
Okay.
Let's see if we can find,
find the canal.
That's why I'm here.
I wanna gonna go on a wee gondola ride,
or something like that, guys.
Oh, it says here,
"Grand Canal, Gondola and Cinema."
Ah, here we go.
This is the canal right here.
I don't see any,
I don't see any gondolas, though, guys.
I don't see any gondolas.
I thought that's what you could do here.
I thought you could take like a wee boat trip on it.
Let's have a wee look around.
Maybe there's another,
another section to it.
But
yeah, very fancy, isn't it?.
Is that a...
I think it's like condominiums,
or a hotel, or something, right there.
Yeah.
Yeah, it looks like condominiums,
so people actually live in here.
People having their apartments right here,
next to this nice mall with Starbucks, and
Italian restaurants and suchlike.
Hi, sir,
- What's up here?
Good evening.
- Hi. What is in here?
????.
- It's a restaurant?
Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.
- Ah, okay. I...
I'm only looking for Pinoy food today.
????.
- Okay.
Asian fusion, sir.
Chef Fusion?
This one is Asian fusion.
- Asian.
Oh, Asian fusion?
Yes.
- Yes.
- Ah, okay.
Yeah, I'm just looking for Pinoy food.
Thank you.
- Okay.
You can find.
- Okay...
Is it possible to take a boat on this, or no?
I don't know, this side, sir.
Oh, but another side, maybe?
Yes, sir.
Ah, okay.
Thank you. Okay.
- You're welcome, sir.
She says,
"I don't know about this side, but maybe another side."
Oh, yeah, I see. Look.
There's like a wee swan thing there.
I was hoping for a proper gondola, like Venice style,
but there's like...
Oh, yeah, there is.
I see them.
There's boats right there.
I think it's just that nobody is doing it right now.
I could get the whole Venice Canal to myself, guys.
But it's, aye, it's all international restaurants.
There's a Denny's there.
Looks like more Asian food.
"Peri Peri Chicken."
Fake Nando's.
Yeah, like I said,
at Filipino malls,
very few restaurants selling Filipino food.
It's like,
The Pinoys that come to a place like this,
they wanna be eating international food,
don't they?
Okay,
let's have a look.
Yeah, look, there's like...
There's about a dozen, a dozen boats right here.
And what are these guys doing?
Hello. I'm looking for a boat ride.
Okay.
Yeah, I think it's closed.
Darn it.
Oh, man.
Yeah, this is the place for it right here.
Look.
This is the place for the boat ride, but
it's all closed off, isn't it?
Arghhh.
Yeah, and this is the other side of it here.
It does it look like there's
anywhere else, it is really just this.
It is really just that,
where you can get on the gondola,
and nothing else up here.
It's very disappointing.
Have I just come at the wrong time,
or something like that?
I don't see any reason why it would be closed off.
It's not like they're draining the canal,
or doing maintenance, or anything like that.
4 kilometres, about a one hour drive,
in Manila's traffic,
to get here,
for nothing.
For nothing, really.
Just to be walking amongst these
Italian restaurants and stuff.
Ughhh.
Yeah.
This is the end of it right here,
and nothing.
Nothing at all.
Just everyone standing here getting their selfies.
Should I at least get a selfie?
Should I
get something out of this trip?
Let me get a selfie with the canal.
Okay, we've got a selfie with the canal.
I didn't get a gondola trip.
Okay.
Darn it.
Hmm.
Oh, there. It's says here "Gondola ride."
These are the gondola drivers, I think.
But it's all closed off. Look,
right here.
I wonder what's going on.
If there's another way to get in there.
I think maybe the other side looks open.
Those guys are,
those guys are dressed like that for a reason.
They're dressed like that for a reason.
I need to find...
I need to find a way in to there.
Ah, here, "Gondola rice tickets."
Hi.
How much is the gondola ride?
Oh, it's per person, 500.
So it's about $9 USD.
I want one person, please.
Eh, it's okay with you to share?
Huh?
- You have to share with other person.
I have to share?!
Oh, my God!
It says "Minimum of four persons."
So that means, if I wanna take it,
I need, like, a minimum of four people.
So it's 2,000.
So that's gonna be like $36,
like, $36 USD if I wanna go myself.
I got nobody to share with.
Can you give me discount since it's quiet time?
No, sir.
No discount?
I don't have any friends.
You have to share with other persons, sir.
I have to share with another person?
Oh, but very expensive for one person, 2,000.
Yes.
Ah.
You cannot give me, like, discount?
They, they have no customers.
No, sir.
No?!
Oh, my God!
I'm gonna have to pay,
I'm gonna have to pay 2,000,
2,000 pesos
to get the boat all to myself.
It's a lot.
It's like $36 bucks.
Ugh.
Should I do it, guys, should I do it, for the vlog?
For the vlog, should I do it?
Okay, let's do it.
Okay, I will do it.
Yeah, I will,
I will take the whole boat for myself.
Okay.
I came all this way.
It took me one hour to get here in the traffic,
so I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna pay my,
pay my 2,000.
Okay.
At least
I don't just get the whole boat to myself,
I get the whole canal to myself.
There's nobody else, no other boat
on the canal, so
that's something.
- The gondolier, sir, meet you downstairs.
Downstairs? Okay.
Yeah.
Here we go.
It's just as well I seen that ticket booth as well.
I thought the whole thing was closed off, you know?
Because they've got that closed off.
They should have a sign that tells you
"Go that way from the ticket booth," you know?
Okay.
Hello.
Ah, yeah, there are other people.
There's two people there going.
Hi.
Okay.
Okay, this one for me?
Okay.
My own...
Ohhh.
I nearly tipped over there.
I stepped right heavily.
I stepped heavily on the edge.
So I get my own boat.
Because I got no friends.
I've got no friends here, so I get my own boat.
Eh, wait photo, sir, souvenir.
It's free.
Oh, we get a free photo?
Yeah.
- Ah, okay.
So a photographer is coming?
Yes.
Ah, okay.
It's printing or digital?
Eh...
- Digital.
Digital? Ah, good.
Send to my phone?
Yeah, good.
It's not digital, sir. It's a hard copy.
Hard copy? Ah.
No, no digital, no?
????.
Ah, okay.
I will ask them.
I will try and get a
digital version,
then I can maybe make it thumbnail
or something like that, guys, can't I?
Here's the photographer.
That's good, at least they don't try and sell you this extra,
like in the theme parks.
Okay.
- Free photo.
Free photo? That's good.
Okay.
Tell me how to pose.
How do I pose?
More happy, sir, more happy.
- Like this?
Yeah.
- Like this?
Yes.
- Okay.
Ah.
Good? Ah, okay.
And you do...?
It's printing or you give, like, email or something?
Ah, hard copy printed.
Ah. But can I get the digital copy, or no?
Ah, yes, you can.
Ah, okay, brilliant.
Fantastic.
Thank you, brother.
Okay.
So we do one loop?
Yes.
- All around?
Okay, good.
Fantastic.
Nice and relaxing.
Look at this, above us.
The lights.
- Sir,
you are blogger?
What's that?
- Blogger, sir?
Blogger? Yes, blogger.
Yes, yeah.
- Okay.
Okay.
Okay, thank you.
- Okay. Good.
We've got, I think that's 4 photos.
Brilliant.
Like I said, normally at these kinda attractions,
that's like an extra.
That's how they up-sell you, you know,
stuff like that. But,
yeah, this is nice.
I'm not sure if it's
$36 nice,
but it is nice.
I dunno, it would maybe be, like, $5 nice, $10 nice.
But,
yeah, it's a minimum four and maximum six.
It's a bit tight for six people.
If you had
five skinny friends, you could do it, though.
And this is a good way to check out this mall.
I can see if there's anywhere I might wanna
have a bite to eat after this gondola ride.
Anywhere here to get halo-halo?
????.
Everything, like, Italiano, Spanish.
Everything international here, right?
Yeah.
- International.
Mexican maybe.
But I need to eat Pinoy.
Yeah, I need halo-halo.
Eh, Jollibee.
Oh, Jollibee is here?!
Yeah.
- okay, maybe I'll go to Jollibee.
I will get myself a...
????.
- What is good at Jollibee,
mango pie or something, right?
And then McDo.
Say again?
- McDo.
Bakdo?
Yeah, McDo.
Makdo?
- Yeah.
McDonald's?
McDonald's.
McDonald's, that's not Pinoy, it's American.
I'm asking for Pinoy food, he's like,
McDo, McDonald's.
Maybe they have Pinoy food.
McDonald's, they have a lot of, like,
regional foods, you know?
Like, in Dubai, they have, like, "McArabia."
It's like a flatbread kinda thing.
Maybe they have something Pinoy here.
Maybe they have halo-halo, who knows.
I will try it.
Eh, yeah, so
if I don't see anything else,
I will try the Jollibee, for
the mango pie.
That is
what people were suggesting to me
when I went to Jollibee in Dubai,
but they don't have it.
Or they didn't have it back then.
I think they might have it now
at the Jollibee in Dubai, the mango pie.
Yeah.
I'm just seeing a lot of the international stuff.
There's a Thai restaurant there,
Dairy Queen,
Burger King, etc..
Yeah.
How many trips you're doing every day?
Eh, 20 times.
20 times every day, up and down?
- Yeah.
Ah, okay.
And all powered by your hand.
Yeah.
- With the right hand.
Ah, always the right one?
- My muscle.
So this one is more strong?
- No, this side, no.
Oh, look at this!
He has, like, big muscles here.
More than this, right?
Okay, 'cause he's always using the right one.
That's brilliant.
Yeah.
One arm like Popeye.
Yeah.
This is nice.
Nice, casual pace, guys.
Nice, casual pace.
You get a lot of attention from people.
Everybody's, like, looking at me from the side
'cause I'm the only one doing this.
I seen another boatload of people,
and I don't know where they went.
They maybe went in the other direction.
But it's not a loop, it's just like a,
it's like a dead end there and a dead end there,
like that.
And these guys over here,
I don't know what the point of these guys are.
I think you just...
I think you take a photo with them
and give them some money.
They were waving at me, but
I didn't wanna give them too much attention
because then they're gonna expect a donation, aren't they,
right there.
Hello.
Okay, I'll wave to them.
I'll wave to them from here.
Hello.
I'll wave to them from here
because they can't get any money out of me.
Okay.
How are you?
Okay, that's our,
our friends who are also
sharing this canal.
So that's good, there was two boatloads,
and they sent one of them...
Well, sent those guys down that way,
and me up that way, so we, kinda, aren't
aren't, basically, going in parallel together.
We get, like, our privacy.
That's nice.
And they're a couple,
having of in a nice, romantic time.
Me,
on my own,
paying for it myself.
Just like I probably would if I was bringing a girl.
I'd probably end up
paying for it myself, anyway.
So it's all good.
Yeah.
Yeah, I bet those apartments are expensive right there.
You get a view of the Venice Canal.
How many years this place has been here?
This place?
Yeah. No, this place?
- 7 years.
7 years?
Ah, okay, so fairly new.
7 years.
Looks like we're almost finished.
Oh, they've got a boat boatload right there.
See,
they split the...
They split the money between six of them.
They're smart.
Not like your man.
Oh, in fact, I think there's more than six,
they've got a baby there.
So they've actually got seven.
The babies go free, apparently.
Can we photobomb them?
Can we photobomb them? (x2)
Oh.
He stopped it.
I wanted to photobomb.
I wanted to give them a photobomb, and he, like,
pushed his hand against the,
against the bridge to stop it right there.
Thank you so much, brother.
What is your name?
My name, sir, Arnold.
Okay, nice to meet you.
Thank you so much.
- Thank you, thank you.
I just need to...
- ????.
Okay, I just need to be careful.
- ????.
There we go, successful.
- ????.
Okay, now we get our photo.
- Your photo, sir.
Yeah.
- Fantastic.
Okay.
I get photo?
????.
- Oh, you've already printed?
Yeah. ????.
- Ah, okay. Nice.
Okay, fantastic.
Can I get, like, one for email or something?
Like a digital?
There's additional payment, sir.
It's an additional payment for the digital one?!
Ah, okay.
No worries.
I've got my own camera, so it's good.
I'll take it out of my camera.
Thank you.
Okay.
- Sir, ????.
- ????.
There's more photos.
Huh?
- Three.
- There's more photos.
Oh, there's three more coming?
- Yeah.
Ah, okay.
So I get all of them, at least, printed.
Ah, the swan, I think you can actually peddle it yourself,
like, without a driver.
It's probably why they were half the price.
You didn't have to pay for the driver.
Okay, that's my fourth one.
Okay. Thank you, so much.
You welcome.
- Thank you.
Okay.
So...
Thank you, thank you.
Okay, so,
you get the four prints for free, but
you have to pay extra if you want them
to give you the digital one, which
doesn't cost anything.
It's just, they send you a file.
So strange.
It should be the other way around. Like,
they give you the digital one for free.
Like, they send you an email,
or give you a download link,
and then you have to pay extra for the printed ones.
They've got it,
they've got it backwards.
But whatever.
These photos, they're really zoomed in.
They're really like...
Really, it's like, you just see me.
You just see me, you don't really see much of the canal,
or the boat, or anything like that.
They're all like that, so
yeah.
He took one from far away, didn't he?
Let's see.
Yeah, there, that one.
See, that one's better.
That's like,
it gets the full boat almost in frame,
and the driver, the gondola driver. The
gondolier?
Is that what you call the driver of a gondola?
The gondolier, the captain.
The gondola captain.
That's a cool photo.
The other ones, they're just really zoomed in.
It's like just me taking up the whole frame,
with a little bit of the
boat behind me in the background.
Anyway,
I will take these photos.
Hopefully, I can fit them in my pocket.
I haven't brought a bag or anything with me today, so,
hopefully I can keep them undamaged.
And now I'm gonna go look for a wee snack.
I think it's gonna have to be Jollibee, guys,
because I don't see anything else Pinoy here.
To get, like, a halo-halo or something like that,
that's what I'm in the mood for.
Something sweet.
How do I get upstairs?
'Cause there was a lot of restaurants up there.
Oh, there's an outdoor bit, with pigeon feeding.
I don't like that.
I really hate pigeons,
but there's a tower or something.
Maybe there's something we can go up,
right there.
I will check that out.
I think that's over that way.
Just now...
Sorry.
Just now, I'm gonna get up here
and have a look at the restaurants.
This is the Jollibee, right here.
Let's see.
Oh, I was gonna get myself a peach mango pie,
but they have something called a "Choco..."
A "Choco Mallow Pie."
It looks like marshmallow and chocolate.
Let's see what they've got.
I'm only interested in sweet food, guys, so
I will have a look. Right there,
there is...
That's the dessert menu there.
"Peach mango pie," that's what I'm after, actually.
Peach mango pie and
I think the only other option is...
Oh, there's f...
There's sundaes, right there.
Okay, I'm gonna get
a mango graham fudge sundae,
the peach mango pie,
and then the one that was on the door,
the chocolate mallow pie.
Are you in the queue, or?
Or waiting, waiting for your food?
Yeah. You can order here.
- Ah, okay.
Oh, you have to order?
You have to?
????.
- Okay.
Okay.
Can you show me what to do?
I've never done this before.
Oh, yeah, I want that.
Eh, this one?
Yeah.
- I'm getting all the sweet food.
Ah!
- Ah, no, not available!
Not available.
- Oh.
You can ask if it's available.
- Okay.
Sometimes it's not available,
????...
- Oh, sometimes it's not there, but have it?
I will ask them.
Yeah.
Hi, is the chocolate mallow pie finished?
Yes, sir.
-  Oh, it's all finished?
Okay, okay.
Yeah, it's finished. Ah.
Ohhh.
- Next time I will try.
I'm gonna...
- Try the new, try the...
They have this new mango graham fudge sundae.
That's new.
Mango graham fudge sundae?
Yeah, I'm gonna try that,
and the mango, peach mango pie.
Peach is here.
Ah, yeah, desserts.
I already had dinner, now I'm looking for dessert.
Yeah.
- Peach mango pie.
I'll get three to go.
Okay, peach mango pie, one.
Yes.
- Add to order.
And then I need the...
Oh, I don't see that there, the new graham
fudge sundae.
- Ah, the graham fudge sundae.
Yeah, it's not on the menu.
- The graham fudge sundae.
No, they don't have it.
That's like a new special one.
Oh, there it is.
Okay.
Mango graham fudge sundae.
Okay, fantastic.
104 pesos.
- You, you want to review?
Yeah.
Ah, okay.
So I pay for it here as well?
- Yeah.
No, you, you can...
Takeout or dine in?
Eh, dine in.
Here, here.
Pay at the counter?
Ah, so I can use my credit card here, and then...
Or I will just...
- Or this one.
Yeah.
- I pay at the counter.
Then you wait for your number.
Ah, okay.
Ah, so you're just waiting to collect?
Yeah.
- Ah, okay. So you get a number,
and then you wait for them to shout it?
This says your number, you can go to the counter.
Ah, okay.
Thank you so much.
- They, they ask you "What's your number,"
you can tell them,
this is your number, "3024."
- Yeah.
Okay, good.
Thank you, so much.
No problem.
I am 3024.
3024.
You order is one peach mango pie and mini sundae.
Yeah.
It's peach and mango pie, and
the ice cream one. This one, mango graham.
104 please.
Okay.
Oh, this is my pie, peach and mango?
Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Okay.
I wanted to try the chocolate mallow one,
but you're finished, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We don't have.
- We don't have, sir.
- Yeah.
Okay, I think I need a spoon or something for this.
Ah, spoon.
Yeah, I don't think I can eat this one with my hand.
It'll be difficult.
Okay.
Fantastic.
Thank you.
No problem.
Okay.
Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, so much.
Okay, let's try this out.
Peach mango pie and
mango graham ice cream.
Okay, so 104 pesos.
Less than 2 bucks for this
dessert combo.
Should it be a combo?
I'm feeling like this is gonna be
something I'm gonna be dipping, the
mango pie into the ice cream.
This is very hot.
That's why I got that idea.
It's like,
I dunno, when you get a hot dessert
and it comes with ice cream,
you combine them and then it's good.
Let's give a bite of this
mango, peach mango pie.
Ah.
Oh!
Guys, it's so hot.
Ah.
I burned my mouth, and then I burned my bloody...
Oh!
I burned my mouth,
and then I burned my bloody fingertips as well.
Oh!
That should come with a health warning.
I got scalded.
I got scalded by the filling there.
You can see... I don't know if you can see it,
but there's steam coming off it.
Okay.
They made it fresh. I waited.
Like, this was ready, and they were like,
cooking this one, so...
Or frying it, deep-frying it.
I'm gonna try this one first,
the graham mango ice cream.
Lots of
little chunks of graham biscuit.
I think it's the same kinda
mango filling that's in the pie,
and then ice cream.
It's something like a
McDonald's McFlurry.
Oh.
Oh, wow.
Oh, the chocolate as well.
That's like your typical
chocolate sauce you would get on ice cream.
Oh.
That's ultra,
ultra, (x2)
ultra, (x3)
ultra, (x4)
ultra, (x5)
sweet, guys.
Ultra, ultra sweet.
Ultra, ultra delicious as well.
It is delicious.
And refreshing.
Right. I think
I wanna try this pie on it's own, just to
see what it tastes like, but
I think I'm gonna,
I'm gonna dip it in the ice cream.
Oh.
Sugar rush.
Mmh.
Oh, wow.
Okay.
Oh.
It's so sweet.
Okay.
I think this bit's cooled down.
This bit's cooled down, so I'll try this.
Oh.
Oh, yeah.
I'm tasting more of the mango than the peach.
But that's delicious,
right there.
This...
There's little chunks,
little chunks of the,
I guess it's mango.
Little chunks of the mango.
Covered... It's like a mango jam, basically.
It's like a chunky mango jam
inside a
hot, deep-fried pastry.
That's what it's like. Now,
my idea, my idea.
Oh.
It's still hot.
I'm gonna...
My idea... Actually, I'm not gonna dip it.
I'm gonna break it up, and just mix it in with this.
Oh.
Oh, my God.
It should have,
it should have a health warning for sure.
My God.
Right, sod it.
I can't even break it up.
I can't even break it up. (x2)
The whole thing's getting
cooled down.
Dunked and cooled down by my ice cream.
Okay.
Here we go.
Mmmh.
Oh.
That's better.
Oh.
And the ice cream is even more sweeter now, but
more crispiness. I was getting a bit of crispiness
from that graham biscuit,
but now it's,
now it's is even more crispy.
Mmmh.
That's the combo, guys.
That's the combo.
That's the way you've got to eat it.
Don't buy...
Don't buy one of these pies on its own
and scald your,
scald your mouth and scald your fingers.
Buy it with the ice cream, and enjoy
the delicious,
combo.
Mmmh.
Mmh.
Oh.
Mmh mmh mmh.
And now, the mango pie has melted it.
Guys, it's just a,
it's just a milkshake now.
My ice cream is just a milkshake.
I don't even need the spoon.
Tanked it like a milkshake.
Fantastic.
Okay, I'm looking for a bin to throw this.
If I was at McDonald's in the UK,
there would be bins,
so that you can clear the table for the,
for the next person, but they don't seem to have it.
Where do  I throw this?
Throw?
Garbage, garbage.
Where do I put the garbage?
Ah, okay.
- Just give it to me.
Thank you, thank you.
See you guys.
- Thank you, sir.
Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.
Okay, yeah.
I think, I think in the Phi...
I think in the Philippines, people like service.
So it's like,
maybe that's not something people want to do,
is like, put away their own garbage.
So they do it for you here.
I like that system better.
Hi.
Okay, everybody's friendly here.
Okay,
I'm gonna find a,
gonna find a bathroom to wash my sticky, burnt hands,
after that delicious Jollibee.
Okay, hands are clean now, guys,
hands are clean. Now I'm gonna check out this
Pigeon Square, or Tower, or whatever it was.
There's another section of this that I haven't seen, that
I should check out before I leave.
This is it here,
"Venice Piazza and Pigeon Feeding."
Ah, here we go.
It's like a quiet area with a wee market.
A wee market area right here,
where you can get some
fruit juice,
and suchlike.
Some Korean sushi,
the kimbap,
there.
Yeah.
That's nice.
Some grilled meat on sticks,
and suchlike.
Yeah, cool.
It's very quiet.
Looks like that'd be a nice, peaceful place to sit and chill.
We're outdoors as well.
This is outdoors.
And that's some tower.
I don't know if you can get up it or not.
Oh, and you can get a wee train ride
as well.
I'm gonna get
a wee Grab ride.
A wee Grab ride back to my hotel and chill.
So that is me for this vlog.
I will see you guys on the next adventure.
