peace be upon you
we are sorry we know that we were late
we were busy
today we'll go with you to try Indian snacks
not snacks like chips
we mean the street light fast snacks that we are eating in between meals
like in Egypt (Hommos elsham) and (Bileela) something like that
so we'll go to try 2 kinds of Indian snacks
we'll take you to the Emirate of Sharjah, Al Qasimia district
we'll try and let's see how it will be
let's go
here we are beside Al Mahatta Park
and beside it directly we'll find this Cafeteria that we are talking about
they are specialized in Indian snacks
we'll add the address in the description box
so you can check it out
as you can see the park beside us here
and the cafeteria will be opposite side
we ordered (Karak tea)
and this snack called (Daiburi)
This (Daiburi) consist of a small puffed chips
like a small puffed bread and crunchy
inside it there's a mashed potatoes with Indian spices
and a sweet sauce added on top of it
this sweet sauce consists of tamarind and dates and spices
then adding blended yogurt
and this yogurt is giving the final look of the dish
also to give the dish a fresh taste
then at the end adding green coriander and 
pomegranate
(Karak tea) is the Indian spiced tea with milk
let's try the Daiburi
it's little hard to pick it
it's little spicy
with a sweet taste
along with yogurt and pomegranate
so nice
there's a wonderful palate contrast
also there's fresh onion on the top
giving it a very good taste
the spices in it called (chaat masala)
and there's a green chili sauce also here
we'll finish this one then we'll go to another cafeteria beside us here
specialized in another one
it's little different because it has no yogurt
it comes with a liquid that's why it called (paniburi) as in Indian (Pani) means water
it's different than this one but they are using the same puffed chips
and almost the same stuff inside it
we can't describe how's the taste is so delicious of course it's spicy
because any Indian food is spicy
but the taste of this mix is so nice
you feel the joy while eating it
it's addiction
we'll finish this one then we'll go to the next as i said
we'll see the other one while they are preparing the (Paniburi)
wait for us
This is the Cafeteria where we'll eat the Paniburi
Pani means water in Indian language
that's why you'll find this liquid
i'll tell you what's this liquid
and this is the same puffed chips
and inside it as you can see
like how he was filling it when we were outside
a mix of mashed potatoes and spices
and fresh onion and this kind of crisps
something like vermicelli
this liquid has 2 elements
if you noticed outside
there's a sweet liquid sauce it's red color
it's made of tamarind, dates, chili and cumin
it's little thick with sweet and sour taste from the tamarind
and the other liquid is green and so light like water
it's made of green chili, fresh mint, green coriander, indian spices called (chaat masala)
cumin and salt
the guy here mixed the 2 liquids together normally each one comes separately
we should hold the chip and add the liquid inside it and eat it
to imagine the taste
it's sweet, sour, spicy and fresh
the taste contrast here is wonderful
of course along with the fresh onion and the mashed potatoes which gives it a creamy taste and texture
with the crunch of the chip
the taste is wonderful
you should fill it completely by the liquid
and this what gives it fun in eating
