just crushing it i'll just put it that way yeah 
oh let's go see these little kids are doing it
bye guys
so before you come here you'll see that 
there's lots of people selling candles  
with multiple colors so each 
color represents a certain  
prayer that you're wanting to ask um ask the lord 
for it's just a nice gesture it's like i went for  
jose and i it's multi and then we got one for our 
family and friends that we always like as well
the name of where we're at is for pillar 
and many people come here not only to  
pay respects to mama mary but also for 
sunday warships they have outdoor seating  
and it's actually sunday and that's why you 
see so many people here and it is said that  
they also don't took in their respects because 
there was a point in the 70s when there was a  
huge tsunami and mama mary here at fort pilar 
actually protected the city of san blas city
did you guys know any chance we get 
to visit a church we are going to 100  
go and i'm so glad we do it's it's it's like 
a nice mental reset it makes you just calm and  
it's exactly what you need sometimes

with us that we're gonna try a local delicacy

a little snug but go see if it fits babe

how long did it take how long 
did it take you to make this one  
one week yeah this one the finest this one
until now i'm already 44. well you're an 
expert that's great beautiful that's beautiful  
we have different kinds of color this guy we have 
the smaller one also for premium okay so are they  
uh naturally dyed it's a commercial threat you 
are using the commercial the commercial oh okay
what happens if you mess up you start from 
here oh so this is where she stops okay  
oh wow you have uh how long would it take her 
to uh was there one day one day one or two  
please start wow can you change it if you have 
mistake you know here because it's different  
you see this one okay it's perfect design it's 
not nice for reference to make this one ah okay  
so we asked how they made a mistake but the way 
that they're doing it is the image they're making  
there's a clear space and they can see that image 
there as well as they're doing it so they can  
visually combine both of them and see if they 
made any mistake in here but guys this is i'm  
really exhausted watching this process this is not 
like i'm going to press on the machine and let it  
go this is an entire process and it's beautiful 
to see and then you see all the final product
it's it's it's a talent at what age 
did she start learning how to eat
okay the grandmother and teach my awful and um  
okay are there seven-year-olds right now 
that are doing justice i keep it alive yeah  
like can you tell me what were you doing at 
the age of seven because these women were just  
they were learning how to start weaving at 
that age the age of seven watching cartoons  
and being a little brat probably playing 
with like plastic toys from walmart and stuff  
not this i would never in my million no 
but again these are traditions my mind is
five which an american that's like  
25 30 why do you wear this oh to keep 
that straight think about the balance
yeah it makes perfect sense support also it 
keeps this tight so she's working it's not like  
jumping around yeah that makes total 
sense again it's the details like
they have the best core strength ever in 
the entire world this is not something and  
they do that how many hours a day do 
you will you do this maybe it's eight
oh i don't trust myself i don't want to 
ruin your work this is like very beautiful  
like the action yeah yeah this is intense 
i'm already like wanting to like get up now  
because of my back yeah so they have the 
strongest lower back but like this is crazy
yes i have a weak core she even said it that's 
what we said was like that's something you  
have to have a good core or you can't sit up 
like that that's no joke all right excuse the  
sweat but we had to ask if there's a meaning 
behind the print or the colors that they use  
and there's not it just comes to them so 
whatever they think of and see they visualize  
that's what they do and that makes the whole 
entire process even more creative yeah and amazing  
i can already tell you that if will was a weaver 
his weaving patterns would just be images of  
brittany's performances absolutely the day in the 
life of brittany and it will sound like hotcakes  
but it's beautiful very very very fascinating it 
is we're gonna keep watching them because it's  
like they're like the ultimate multitasker is 
to like move all these like pieces to make this  
lots of pieces and they're talking and they're 
listening to us and they're giving us a story like  
kudos yeah this is beautiful and i hope 
this tradition never dies exactly forever
like okay now that you know all 
the work that went into it they  
make it in so many different accessories 
and what was on the shopping spree
and then get going guys okay what did you 
think of the experience i want i want even more  
that's the thing if we weren't here if we were 
here for longer i know i love these type of things  
and the fact they were so inclusive with us 
we just made it that much more amazing and  
again you can take it away a child right now i'm 
very happy let's just say they're very prideful  
of what they do so it's kind of hard to say no 
to all the items they are able to make later
jeepney's everywhere you're not escaping from 
the philippines so don't think otherwise yeah  
my impressions of the town yeah it's a great city 
it's like it's so lively there's lots of spanish  
influence in these buildings there's so much to 
see and do like it's one of those things like  
there's a store after store after store building 
after building but everybody's been very kind you  
know of course people are going to see this big 
camera curious what it is but i don't know it's  
a very easy walkable city and there's 
a lot to see and do give me love give
else me me feel this also another really 
good thing is guys it's much cooler than cebu  
here there's actually like you 
know a breeze which is nice
you and me yeah that's zamboanga i love you 
guys legitimately to come here to a place  
that if you read up on it it might have a 
stigma attached to it right unless you go you  
don't actually get to see what the place is truly 
about and the hospitality and the kindness is no  
different from point a in the philippines at 
point b and that zombonga is showing that like  
they're just as kind friendly accommodating as 
anybody else in the world it doesn't matter what  
your race is what your pride is any of that 
everywhere we've been it's been phenomenal
like i said this whole line is going to
as you guys can see there's a skate park 
there's a playground there's a fountain  
don't even give me startling lots of 
food and just wait where's pee start  
will go get your son oh my god right now 
if you do not get your pantry pat patrick
patrick okay
giving me
