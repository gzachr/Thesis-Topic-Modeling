and they eat it um at many occasions in the house
welcome back to pinoy planet it has been a while 
since i last made lumpiang shanghai for my sister  
i really like this dish from the philippines 
nice and crispy with rice and good sasawan  
but i did not yet make it for my parents so 
today i will give it to my nanay and tatay
your tips to use celery instead of 
parsley so today i'm using the celery
also based on your recommendation last time 
i'm grating the carrot instead of chopping  
it easier and it might be good for the texture 
here's the giniling giniling na baboy at baka
maraming salamat po again for all your 
recommendations another one was to use a  
white onion white sibuyas instead of 
a red sibuyas that i used last time
is
black pepper at asin
finally some fresh celery  
adding a lot of celery and also lower salt to 
make it slightly more healthy version we're  
actually cooking this dish together because 
you told me how to improve on the recipe
ingredients i made sure to wash my hands of course
it's time for the wrapping technique you remember 
when i gave the lumpiang shanghai to my sister  
i was not able to wrap it nicely but i think 
i found a technique so i'm just using a little  
bit of i guess that is one way of wrapping 
the lupine shanghai and i'm also trying it  
slanting now to see the difference i have a 
feeling that this will do a little bit better
fold this one
in and then roll it again
i'm happy now with the result looks good
the question is which sawsawan 
would you choose for lumpia shanghai
for the sasawan three different types 
one is just chili sauce and the other  
one that i'm going to make will be a 
sawsawan with a vinegar onion and sugar  
nice and then we have one more this will be 
just ketchup and mayonnaise combined this is uh  
50 water based on your recommendations 
in the last video and also fifty percent  
vinegar i'm also gonna add siling labuyo it 
has sugar salt sibuyas now it's time to fry  
the lumpiang shanghai here's the fryer it's 
already mainit we have the rice of course
how do you keep the lumpias warm 
like this a toaster plate on top  
turn it on there oh from the philippines
a famous dish from the philippines called lumpiang 
shanghai and here's the warm rice of course  
and in the philippines they don't say 
bon appetit but they say attack attack  
that means attack attack here's 
a real filipino sawsawan this is  
ketchup and mayonnaise and this is chili sauce 
my mom made the barbecue sauce and there's also  
atchara enjoy finally i have a roll roll 
so many people in the philippines they eat  
shanghai with the fingers yeah with the 
hand you can eat with your hands yeah  
and they eat it at many occasions in the house 
they eat it with the family and you can buy it  
on the street how do you like it bruh nice 
sarap how is the look from the philippines
no time to answer no time to answer
can you try the sawsawan the dipping 
sauce from the philippines this one
that's a vinegar base is it nice  
that's a pinoy planet sawsawan because many 
viewers advise me how to make it i loved it sour

many people also said uh you can just use a 
regular chili sauce so there's also chilis
in the philippines they eat a 
lot of rice it's coming for more
