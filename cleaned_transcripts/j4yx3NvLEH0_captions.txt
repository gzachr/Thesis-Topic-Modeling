hey guys michael here and in this video we're 
going to be talking about the types of scams  
that filipinas do to foreigners now before we 
get started welcome to our channel welcome back

subscribe click the bell icon to be notified of  
any new videos that we release in a weekly basis 
so just to let you guys know this channel is meant  
for foreigners and for expats who are thinking 
about either coming here to the philippines to  
either visit to be able to meet your future wife 
to be able to meet your future girlfriend or maybe  
just to have some fun so let's go ahead and get 
started and talk about some of the top scams that  
we have seen being done by some shady filipinas 
to some foreigners now before we even get started  
just want to be able to let you guys know that the 
filipinas are amazing women and not all of them  
are scammers don't believe what some people say 
out there that all filipinas are out to get your  
stuff but guess what there are the very few and 
most of the time the reason why filipinos are able  
to scam some expats and some foreigners is because 
those expats and foreigners don't know any better  
or sometimes just don't even pay attention so let 
me go ahead and help you guys with some of this  
top scams that are being done the first one is the 
can you help me scam what happens is you meet this  
filipina online or you maybe meet this filipina 
somewhere in the streets if you're visiting here  
and then all of a sudden something comes 
up just because you're starting to talk  
to her you're having conversations all of 
a sudden they're gonna say can you help me  
something came up now how does that work well 
guess what her phone broke or you know she's  
having she's being kicked out of the house that's 
a big thing right oh my god i don't know where to  
live i got kicked out and blah blah blah can you 
please help me please please please please help me  
okay so that can be a problem right and of course 
here we are the you know mr white knight i want  
to save this poor young filipina because she's so 
pretty and she's so beautiful that okay fine you  
know a person like this would never scam a person 
listen guys we're all humans things happens but  
at the same time as people do take advantage of 
people so don't fall when the sentence starts with  
can you help me okay that's just one of the 
things and just pretty much can you help me with  
blank fill in the blank and that's what's going 
to be happening the moment you hear this the  
moment is those those bells those alarms 
should start ringing in your head and say  
michael said that anything after can you help me 
blank i should pay attention the thing though is  
guys you guys don't even have anything established 
here just a communication wise so don't let that  
get to you guys all right another scam that 
happens is my my dad died oh i tell you one thing  
her father died about five to ten times with five 
to ten different foreigners already because guess  
what guys it's all about power by numbers that's 
how scams happen if i can try to cast the net wide  
to 100 people and if i get one person to just jump 
at it to try to be that white knight to help me  
it's gonna happen it's all by power by numbers 
the more i get to explain and tell the story  
you know a good version of them my dad died is 
oh my grandma's in the hospital my mom is in the  
hospital oh the bills are so high i don't know how 
to how to handle this oh they won't admit my mom  
until i'm able to put a deposit in now that is 
some true there's some truth to that like a lot  
of the hospitals here in the philippines unless 
you have a down payment they're not even going to  
bother seeing you you you know you're you're 
you're going to pretty much die if you don't  
have that down payment so that is going to happen 
the next one is you're you're talking to someone  
you're having great conversations you're having 
a text uh communication with this person and then  
all of a sudden you want some confirmation to see 
if this person is the real deal and the best way  
to know if this person is the real deal is to be 
able to at least first let's go have a video chat  
let us have that video chat and all all 
of a sudden they give you this thing  
my phone's broken my camera and my phone 
doesn't work so i'm not able to do that  
and then of course here you are you're like but 
i want to see you and what's funny is a lot of  
these things these type of scam starts the easiest 
way to know it is when you start talking to this  
person and start messaging each other without you 
even asking they'll do what they call a photo bomb  
where they just send you like a mass amount of 
photos like like 10 a minimum bam bam bam you  
know some sexy photos here and there and all of 
a sudden bikini photos all of a sudden might be  
some naked photos but now you saw the photo now 
you're like but i want to see you live if you  
look this this amazing this sexy this beautiful 
this young this innocent yet have a naughty side  
all these photos maybe i can see you in video 
but oh all of a sudden her phone is broken or my  
favorite one yet is oh i am only using this bone 
of my casing i'm using my calcium spun so i am not  
able to text you all the time so sometimes i it's 
not available because my phone it's broken and  
i don't know how to pay for it at this moment so 
here you go you're like oh let me go send you and  
then all of a sudden they're putting a request but 
i want that iphone and event i want an iphone 12  
so i can make better photos for you right they're 
gonna say some stupid stuff like that something  
so generic but once again they cast a wide net 
to a bunch of people and someone's gonna break  
i've seen this happen a lot i've seen 
foreigners and expats complain about this  
but at the very same time as i hear a lot of local 
filipinas here complain about the same thing as  
well and the reason why they're complaining is 
because the few filipinas who are doing these  
scams unfortunately is making the real filipinas 
the good ones the good natured ones the real ones  
who are deserving to have somebody to care for 
them look bad and what's even amazing is a lot  
of even these scammers can't we're not even 
filipinas sometimes they may be some filipinos  
or they may be some filipino ladyboys or even 
a bunch of nigerian scammers that's right  
for some reason lots of nigerian scammers are 
around pretending to be filipinos pretending to  
be thai people because guess what we all know that 
western men has what we call the yellow fever the  
asian persuasion the asian flu the asian you know 
pill they want to get them some of the yellow skin
right that that darker 
beautiful island skin sometimes  
so we need to be able to be understanding 
that these things are around but at the  
same time is not judged the whole entire 
group of females from the philippines  
they're going to say something like 
i want to wear something sexy for you
right that's another one that they're going to say 
right so you know hey you know you want to buy me  
something and i'll put it on for you i'll tell you 
guys one thing right now at this very moment they  
probably already have that little school girl 
outfit they probably already have that you know  
dominatrix look they probably already have that 
little police outfit they probably already have  
that sexy nurse outfit because some other idiot 
already bought that for them or what they do is  
they know other people that have it and they'll 
put it on for you so here you are sending them  
some money all of a sudden thinking that yeah i 
bought that for her but no no she already has that  
she already has photos that she already 
hacked already to a lot of other people
all right the next one is i want to stop working 
at the bar because don't you want me to be  
all yours baby i don't want to work there no more 
because i just did that to be to take care of my  
family the truth is i want to be able to meet that 
right american i just want to be able to meet that  
right australian for me that's gonna love me and 
care for me and once again the white night strikes  
again and i'm like i'll save you think about that 
if it goes if it's something that happens with  
others trust me they're gonna jump on it and use 
it also to see if they can get you because if they  
cannot get you they will get someone else another 
good one that's and this happens a lot with  
men that come down here to visit 
filipinas meet them and stuff like that  
and then all of a sudden they give you 
the sob story saying that i am pregnant
you know this this was done 
actually to a friend of mine  
and the girl was telling him oh i'm pregnant 
unfortunately my friend told her i don't think  
you remember the time we spent together 
because unless your mouth can get pregnant
then it wasn't me
now i told him it was kind of mean for him to say 
that but at the same time as i'm like he's like  
man michael this this girl tried to lock me down 
this girl tried to entrap me which is hilarious  
so he says it was just desserts i gave her 
the same type of nastiness that she gave me  
trying to accuse me that i got her pregnant and 
guess what two months three months later after  
if this happens to you you start sending her 
some money all of a sudden what oh the baby  
something happened now i have hospital 
bills can you pay for that too
that's pretty crazy in it isn't it  
another one happens is that you know especially 
this happens a lot if you end up with a bar girl  
you know they may put a complaint 
on you and say that you rape them  
and guess what a filipina's word over a foreigner 
sexpat that's what they'll try to brand you as  
all of a sudden you're in trouble so you 
definitely want to be able to be careful  
here's another bar girl scam that happens you know 
especially some of you guys who you know you guys  
just want to enjoy you guys want to experience 
you know especially a lot of you guys who  
be like i just want to experience a threesome 
for example right and then here you are you met  
this girl at a bar and you're talking and then 
all of a sudden she's you know she offers you a  
threesome and you're just like your little 
child giddiness it's just like oh my god i  
get to finally experience something that only 
happens in porn videos and then all of a sudden  
you jump in the matter she's like okay i have 
a friend but what you didn't know is you didn't  
check her id and turns out to be her friend is 
underage and then all of a sudden guess what  
the cops bust in the door later on while you're 
sleeping and the girls are gone already and they  
put a complaint and all of a sudden now you were 
what a pedophile now you have to figure out a way  
because the cops and the girls are kind of 
all in it and now they're all up on you now  
you have to try to what pay your way out there's 
nothing wrong about you picking up girls in the  
bar there's nothing about wrong about you going 
to the red light district and p burgos or going  
to the red light district in angela city i have 
nothing wrong with that it's all about enjoying  
yourself and being safe guys and that's what we're 
doing some of these videos be safe about things
you have to understand that these are the 
potential things you never put yourself in  
those situations you know don't allow yourself 
to be that if you're going to be doing some of  
that stuff picking up girls you know you know or 
finding a girl as they may say still be careful
and especially some of you guys going to like 
some really shady hotels you want to pay 15  
instead of the typical 35 and above
right just to save a buck save 15 dollars 
sometimes when you want to save 15  
you end up spending another thousand 
dollars because of that idea of yours  
and that goes by with picking the shady hotel 
and going to the other side of things and trying  
to pick up somebody in the street rather than 
going to one of the more established bars and  
guess what here's another great scam that happens 
they might end up being a lady boy now look if if  
that's your cup of tea h more power to you man i'm 
talking to the straight guys here the ones that  
i didn't know that was possible i didn't know 
that they would look that good guys there are  
lady boys here that looked way better than some 
filipinas that even filipinas are so jealous of  
so you have to be careful because there's 
so many types of scams such as these
and in the end it all plays into that inner 
um i would say horniness that you may have as  
men that us men may have so you 
have don't let your bottom head  
make the decisions and think for you and make this 
head right here be the one that pays attention
so many foreigners have been scammed but guess 
what i've known foreigners who've scammed  
filipinas as well and i'm going to share 
with you guys some of the some of the  
other scams that foreigners actually have done  
to filipinos here as well i'm going to 
share some of that with you in another video
