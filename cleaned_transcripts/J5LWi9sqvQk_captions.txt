thank you
it was the Rolling Stones that said you can't 
always get what you want honey but if you try  
sometimes you just might find you get what you 
need I'm gonna hope that that's going to be the  
case of my situation in this video where um 
I have spent about a week in Manila now and  
unfortunately things just haven't been going great 
if I'm being honest where the first three four  
days I was actually very sick with a stomach bug 
that I had on the tail end of my trip from Bali  
so I did the responsible thing and just rested 
in those days the days where it was beautiful  
and sunny out but now when I'm thankfully feeling 
better as you can see we are dealing with the tail  
end of manila's rainy season it's a little rain 
obviously never hurt nobody but uh it does make  
things much more complicated for me to film and 
make it aesthetically pleasing so I'm gonna try my  
best I'm gonna try my best guys because I really 
want to shine Manila in the best light I think  
it's a really cool City and I have been enjoying 
my time here so the area that I am in right now  
let me actually flip the camera this is BGC and 
it is the second largest business district in  
Manila after Makati the area that I am staying in 
but all along I had plans to shoot my intro here  
because it has all these cool skyscrapers lots of 
amazing street art but yeah that's how it goes it  
is just gonna be raining probably all afternoon 
so instead after walking around here for well  
maybe 20 30 minutes I'm gonna do as the locals do 
and I'm gonna take you guys eyes to an epic Mall  
foreign
I have taken you guys is not just a mall 
not just any mall is the Venice Canal Mall  
I had actually seen the small in somebody else's 
video so I knew that I had to make a trip to check  
it out for myself and since we are very fortunate 
that the rain has stopped at least for a second  
um let me actually take this time and tell you 
guys about some of my first impressions of the  
Philippines the very first thing that happened 
right as I was passing through immigration uh  
here in Manila really caught me off guard was 
first of all the immigration officer spoke  
amazing English very impressive but second of 
all he asks me a peculiar question where well  
first he's just like where are you from and 
I was like oh you know Calgary in Canada and  
he was like where in Calgary and at first 
I was like is this a trick question like  
why why does you know he want to know that 
and so I said well you know in the southwest  
corner of the city that's where my mom lives 
and he's like oh is that near Chinook Mall  
and I was like what how do you know where 
Chinook mall is totally took me off guard  
that an immigration officer knew so much about 
Calgary where honestly the majority of people  
don't know where Calgary even is and then to play 
off this point I was just walking down the street  
and some really friendly people uh just came up to 
talk to me once again spoke perfect English that's  
going to be a theme of my first impressions is 
that everyone here speaks incredible English but  
second of all as we were talking they were saying 
that they had some relatives in Red Deer so yeah  
absolutely wild that I feel like I've met so many 
people that know so much about Canada all in all  
my first impressions of the people here is that 
they are incredibly nice I feel so welcome and  
uh from a tourist standpoint overall it has been 
quite easy to get around and figure things out
thank you
and look at this guys just like in Venice 
they have the love lockets as well on this  
gorgeous bridge and another thing that I 
feel is definitely worth mentioning as a  
first impression of the Philippines is that 
they have started celebrating Christmas so  
early it is the end of October right now and you 
will see like Christmas lights over there just  
decorations all over the place Mariah carries 
on every radio station and it's funny because  
I feel like we celebrate Christmas fairly early 
in North America maybe about mid-november the  
Christmas decorations will start coming out but 
apparently they've already been up for like two  
or three weeks here they start in the beginning 
of October so like three months of Christmas
thank you and another very important 
thing that I have been saving  
for when I arrive in the Philippines 
is trying the famous Jollibee  
from what I've heard this place is the equivalent 
of like KFC I guess because the primary thing that  
they serve is fried chicken um I've had some 
Filipino friends that I actually worked with  
um at the Thai restaurant I used to work at 
in uh Toronto we had like half Thai staff  
half Filipino and when Jollibee opened in Toronto 
they were so psyched look how cute their mascot is  
I love this little b character so yeah I want to 
give you guys my first impressions of Jollibee all  
right guys my order has arrived well actually I 
am missing I think it's called the Boku pie they  
said it'd be ready in five minutes it's like a hot 
coconut pie I think oh perfect thank you very much  
there we go pie so this will be my dessert 
look how cute uh but yeah for my main I  
decided to obviously try something that 
you would not see in Canada which is fried  
chicken and then also their famous spaghetti 
and then I got this which is a sarsi float  
I have no idea what Cersei is it kind 
of looks like Coke or Pepsi but I don't  
know so I thought I would try it all right the 
light the lighting is not fantastic in here but  
we're gonna have to work with it let us begin 
with the sarsi look find out what star C is
beer very nice really nice yeah to me 
this would just be like a root beer float  
delicious and now we have the famous chicken 
and spaghetti let's begin with the chicken
foreign
I mean I haven't had KFC in quite a long time 
but I'm pretty sure this is better than KFC  
fantastic Fried Chicken like I'm 
not kidding you guys like 10 out  
of 10 for the Fried Chicken I'll be honest 
though with the spaghetti it's not looking  
super appealing if you know what I mean 
it just looks very Bland like just tomato  
sauce a little bit of cheddar and I don't 
know these kind of fat noodles on top so  
oh what in the world you guys there's hot dogs 
in the spaghetti okay interesting interesting
it's okay it's okay I'll be honest and say I 
wouldn't come back for the spaghetti I'd probably  
get fries instead but the chicken is fantastic 
I would get that with a side of fries root beer  
float in my opinion is very good we definitely 
get it again and last but not least let's try this  
little oh okay I'm worried I ordered the pulo one
okay I'm actually a little bit confused 
guys because I thought I ordered the Pula  
one that's the coconut one but on this side 
it says peach mango maybe they just use the  
same packaging for all of them I don't know 
yeah it's just cute little pie um let's try it
um
I did get the one I ordered it is like a 
white filling inside which is the coconut  
and it's really very happy with this very good 
first impression of Jollibee I can definitely  
see why people like this and I will definitely 
try it again while I'm here in the Philippines  
so welcome to Manila guys a city of many contrasts 
and home to a population of approximately 15  
million people in the metro area if you stick to 
the more tourist areas of Manila you will find  
that it is very Foreigner friendly really easy 
to get around overall quite safe and very modern  
but if you are looking from the bird's eye view of 
the city there is of course a lot of poverty some  
that is very extreme and there are some parts 
of the city that would be extremely dangerous  
for tourists to visit as a solo female traveler I 
overall found it quite easy to get around and in  
sticking to the fairly safe areas I didn't really 
have any problems a few safety suggestions that I  
would have for both men and women that are coming 
to Manila for the first time is to really pick  
the best possible area for your accommodation 
something really Central second of all I would  
never recommend getting the regular white taxis 
off of the street it is definitely better to use  
grab the top safety precaution you really have 
to watch out for even in the tourist areas is  
of course pickpocketing try and have your bag in 
front of you not have too much money on you at one  
time and just don't be swinging your cell phone 
around everywhere that's really the main thing  
now that's not to say you can't go to the more 
local areas I actually did just that and you  
will see the full Vlog uh as my next video where 
I actually hired a local tour guide who was super  
nice and we went into an area that I didn't see 
any tourists in and I was definitely a bit of  
a circus attraction but people were super nice 
and it was just a really eye-opening experience  
into what life is like for the average person 
here in Manila you guys know that I like to  
focus on the best parts of each place but 
I think it would be irresponsible of me to  
not mention some of the things you should watch 
out for and while Manila is a fantastic City you  
can't just walk anywhere you can't go to every 
single district and not be at risk of certain  
things happening so just keep those things 
in mind and I'm sure you'll have a great time
now if you're looking for a recommendation of 
where to stay in Manila especially if you're  
coming here for the first time I would say Makati 
that is the area that I have chosen to stay in  
a little closer to the district that is called 
publishion it's fairly accessible to other areas  
the tourists would be interested in and it really 
has everything you need now to give you guys an  
idea about pricing as far as accommodation goes 
in this area well let me give you a very first  
a general example of where I'm staying love di 
Makati not sponsored obviously it's a very popular  
hostel chain in Southeast Asia but I did choose to 
stay in a private room which was 40 US dollars a  
night and if I remember correctly their dorm rooms 
were going for about 15 US dollars a night if you  
wanted something a little bit more high-end and 
there are some beautiful you know luxury hotels  
here in Makati I would say that a three-star hotel 
is going to start around 70 US dollars a night  
and then if you want to stay somewhere really 
fancy like the peninsula over here those kinds  
of five-star hotels are starting around the two or 
three hundred dollar a night range overall I think  
this is a great option for anybody who's coming 
here for the first time because like I said it's  
very tourist friendly you do see quite a bit of 
foreigners walking around this area it's also nice  
because they have pretty long Boulevard so you can 
actually go for walks it's really easy to get grab  
taxis here or to use the public transit so all in 
all a great place to start your journey foreign
now another must if you are coming to Manila 
is the historic area of intramurals this is  
the oldest part of the city dating back to the 
16th century when the Spanish had colonized the  
Philippines so a very touristy area but very 
beautiful and to see it I decided to do a bike  
tour with this local company called bam bike 
Eco tours I'm standing right in front of the  
building but one thing I didn't anticipate 
is that a lot of the roads are cobblestone  
so I don't know how comfortable that is 
you know biking wise I guess we'll find out
foreign
thank you
I feel like this is the perfect place to end 
off today's video friends this is Park Rizzle  
just outside of intramuros lovely place to go 
walk around but that brings us to the end of  
my introductory uh video to Manila I hope you 
found it helpful and I will actually have one  
more video coming out after this one where 
I visit a much more local part of the city  
that I definitely wouldn't recommend visiting on 
your own you definitely need a local guide and  
I guess one last thing I want to mention is that 
unfortunately I only have three weeks three weeks  
here in the Philippines which sure to the average 
person just on vacation would be a very long time  
but for somebody filming doing a full-time 
job it's really not a lot of time the reason  
I can't extend my time here is because I'm meeting 
somebody very special at my next destination and  
have to be there at a specific time so really the 
only two places that I'm going to be doing in the  
Philippines is Manila and then I'm flying down 
to Palawan and I will do a few different stops  
on Palawan before leaving to my next country so 
100 I'm gonna have to come back to the Philippines  
this is just a tiny Taste of everything this 
country has to offer so as always let me know  
your thoughts in the comments guys have you been 
to the Philippines specifically Manila I guess for  
this video leave your thoughts and suggestions 
down below and as always I'm sending you guys  
so much love I hope you're having a fantastic day 
and keep being your own kind of beautiful bye guys
