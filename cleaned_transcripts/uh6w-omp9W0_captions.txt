had an epic day out squidding with my
good friend luke ryan from tackle west
see how i catch and cook this squid in
its own squid ink
using some basic ingredients you have at
[Music]
home
[Music]
we headed out mid morning to catch
ourselves a feed of squid
and it didn't take too long for the
action to heat up
[Music]
want to keep tension on oh my god
here bass andrew has just hooked
the goliath drag
light yeah
that is a monster squid
that's bigger than the squirrel before
bigger than i've ever thought of
this andrew's
[Music]
now as we headed back i got to thinking
of how i was going to cook this
massive squid the kraken
[Music]
today i'm going to cook one of my
favorite dishes from the philippines
it's called adobon pusi so it's a squid
adorable
and basically all the ingredients you've
got at home generally
apart from the squid uh but yeah you've
got some pepper
sugar tomato chili
garlic and onion and we've got a
filipino vinegar here but you can use
sort of white vinegar that you've got at
home
you don't use any balsamics or apple
ciders or anything that like a nice
neutral vinegar
and then a little bit of soy sauce
but the fiesta resistance
is this squid that i caught yesterday
that is huge look at the size of it
look at those beautiful clear eyes
that's so fresh
the other thing that we're going to be
using is the ink sac from the squid
so that'll give it this really beautiful
deep dark black color
all right so let's get into it i'll show
you how to clean the squid first
the squid has a backbone that's kind of
like hard plastic
and it's inedible so we need to remove
that from the squid by gently
maneuvering it away from the body
now because i'm using the ink sac i've
got to be very careful not to break that
so i just have to be gentle
there we go and look there's that
ink sack right there so we want to keep
that because we're going to be using
that for the cooking
now what i want to do is just cut
just in front of the eyes where the
tentacles are just here
all right and you've got to pull out the
beak
and this is a very big beak look at that
yeah so that's its mouth
all right let's put these aside for a
second
and then i'm just going to cut off above
the eyes
that was just the brain it's not the ink
sack don't worry about that
all right and i'm gonna put that aside
as well i'm gonna use that
so there's also little suction caps on
the end of the squid tentacles
you can just run your thumb over it
doesn't matter if you don't get them all
off
they sort of break down when you're
cooking them a little bit anyway
i'm gonna take that end bit off because
this is such a large squid that's really
tough
[Music]
and generally that you'd use a much
smaller squid for this
and this would be a bite-sized piece but
this is
a plate size piece all right so i'm
going to do it around about a centimeter
thick
[Music]
all the way across and we're going to
leave the wings on
so i give it a really cool shape
looks a little bit like the flying numb
now you can remove the skin but i like
to leave it on because i think it gives
it a really nice rustic look
and a beautiful color okay and then just
slice the tentacles up into
bite-sized pieces now don't forget to
like
and subscribe to my channel for loads
more food love
the other thing i'm gonna do is dry the
squid off on some kitchen towel
because if it's too wet the water stews
it when it hits the pan
i'm going to do these in batches because
these are such big pieces so
i want to sear them off a little bit but
only half cook them because we're going
to finish them off in the sauce
but i just want to get a little bit of
color on them so i'm just going to
quickly
sear them in a hot pan with a little bit
of vegetable oil
i first tried this dish in the
philippines in a
a thing called a dumper which is a wet
market you go there and you there's all
live seafood everywhere and you go on
selector you want some squid you want
some prawns
you just go and grab whatever you want
you take it to a little restaurant or a
store there
and they cook it up for you in any sort
of style you want and that was the first
time i tried this adobe
so you'll see it's getting a nice bit of
color on there now
and that's what we want it's that
beautiful little caramelization
all right so the squid is just half
cooked now you can see with the
this is why i left the skin on you get
all those beautiful purple
bits of color through there and just
looks really gorgeous and that gives
nice um color to the sauce as well
now i haven't put any seasoning on this
it's only half cooked but
[Music]
that is so beautiful so fresh so sweet
caramelization okay first uh
about four or five cloves of garlic into
some vegetable oil
just gonna toast it off a little bit
just get a little bit of color in it
all right so a little bit of color on
that garlic now
so in with the onions okay so now the
fun part
we're going to do the ink sac so we've
got the ink sac we've got all these
innards as well which
they contain a lot of fats and that
really brings a lot of flavor to the
dish as well so we chuck it all in there
we are going to remove it we chuck it in
there
and then we're going to break get it
getting closer
it's going to break the insect
and get all that ink out look at that
color
can you see how black that is whoa this
is a big ink sack too
that's a lot of ink this is going to
taste gorgeous
see that beautiful black color
oh it smells fantastic
okay so we've got that
we're going to chuck in our tomatoes and
a couple of green chilies
and just a little dash of the vinegar at
the moment which helps release
the ink from the sack
also just to release a little bit more
of that ink just add a little bit of
water to it
and now we're going to let it stew a
little bit
okay now we can pull this fat and
innards out now
[Music]
now we're going to let it cook and let
those tomatoes break down a little bit
okay at this point we're going to put
the squid in there
it's not going to be in there for very
long we're just going to release some of
the juices into the sauce
and just to finish the cooking this
massive squid's a little bit big for
this little pan
just gonna add a little bit more water
as the squid's been cooking for i think
about three minutes in the
the sauce i'm just going to pull it out
now we're going to add some more flavors
to it
and we're going to reduce it down the um
squid's out
and we've got this beautiful black gravy
sauce there
just going to add some pepper
just a little splash of it
and then a little bit of sugar
just give a light stir
just to circulate the sugar
and then we're going to leave it for an
another five minutes i guess just to
thicken it right up
and of course we need some soy sauce
which will give it that nice salty or
mummy flavor
okay so that's been cooking for a few
minutes now i've added a little bit of
salt
but it's thickened right up so i'm just
gonna quickly re-add
this squid back in there
beautiful fresh squid
just a little stir through we're not
cooking it anymore we're just going to
warm it up a little bit
a little stir through and that's it
that's ready to go
[Music]
i'm getting excited
onions chili
garnish with a little bit of chili and
there we have it
