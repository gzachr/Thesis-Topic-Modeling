good morning from the lovely little town in 
the north of Palawan called El Nido this is  
considered to be one of the most beautiful 
places in all of the Philippines so the top  
attractions of El Nido are definitely 
the many islands and islets that they  
have here it's really beautiful nature and 
the easiest way to see all that is to take  
a local boat trip which is what I'm going to 
be doing this morning but before we do that I  
want to grab some breakfast and also show you 
guys the town site because it is super cute

so there are four main boat tours here in El Nido 
a b c and d a is the most popular one if you only  
had you know one day trip where you could do 
a boat tour that's the one that they say you  
should do today I'm going to be doing 2 or a but

we have made it to seven Commandos Beach this 
beautiful strip of white sand amongst the palm  
trees and apparently there's a resort further 
on down here so if you actually wanted to stay  
on this island that's also an option one thing 
I want to say right off the bat is that I am  
so grateful that I bought this thing here in El 
Nido you see everyone walking around with these  
waterproof bags and it's a really good thing I 
purchased it because to get in and out of the  
boat as you can see they can only come in so 
far so you have to kind of tread through the  
water to get on and off your boat meaning there's 
a good chance that your stuff will get wet if you  
just had it in a regular bag so I highly urge you 
guys if you're bringing any kind of electronics  
or anything else you don't want getting wet 
make sure you have of some kind of waterproof  
bag to get it in because you are basically 
waiting in pretty tall water to get on the boat

s we just got to Shimizu Island which 
is super gorgeous and look at the lunch  
that we are going to have in just a couple of 
minutes here yeah yeah do you want to try oh
yeah
it's gonna tickle it's so cute you 
want it sure keep it little friend
so it's a bit of a sad story how this 
island actually got its name there  
was a Japanese tourist named Shimizu 
who was one of the first tourists to  
actually come to this island and as he was 
exploring he found these underwater caves  
and unfortunately he ended up passing 
away in that area so it was after hand  
that the island was named and you can 
actually go to the underwater caves now  
um if you are Patty certified and go on a group 
tour so that is a very sad history of this island
look at this spread the shrimp chicken 
yakisoba pork that's seaweed right yeah  
oh my gosh that's what they 
use uh for ASMR you know right
that's awesome we also got some fish 
about 20 cups of rice lots of fruit
foreign
we are at a place called The Secret Lagoon and 
I have to tell you it was so treacherous trying  
to get down here um don't even think about 
doing this tour without renting like water  
shoes to protect your feet because almost 
every single uh Beach we've gone to there  
are like huge rocks everywhere so imagine like 
you're getting off the boat and trying to swim  
amongst the waves and then it gets so shallow 
and you keep like hitting rock after Rock after  
Rock so I hope it's gonna be worth it there's 
like a big lineup of people uh to enter this  
sort of like cave you wouldn't see it if you 
were further away it's this little hole that  
opens up to I guess a lagoon so hopefully 
it's worth the Trek but that was intense

back in town guys the Sun is going to set 
fairly soon here but I thought it would be  
fun to show you a little bit more of El Nido 
town and also go try some local Filipino food
hello I think yeah that'd be great thank you
what would you recommend 
for a Filipino specialties
the our chicken adobo chicken adobo okay
all right guys my food just arrived we 
got chicken adobo I have not tried this  
yet but I've definitely heard of it 
very popular and then I just got a  
mixed stir fry because I got to get the 
veggies in got a San Miguel pale Pilsen  
looks like the perfect meal let's 
do a taste test we're gonna take
that falls off the bone
it's very tender it has a very kind of distinct  
wood I think it's because of the sauce 
that it's marinated in and I actually  
really like that I got the vegetable dish 
because there's something in here that I  
don't I don't know what kind of vegetable it 
is whatever this is I don't know what it is
I don't know what kind of vegetable it is 
but it's good very hearty and yeah all in  
all delicious I mean nothing's too crazy 
it is just rice chicken and vegetables but  
really well done and for the chicken itself 
I think it's only about three US Dollars  
and then the vegetables is actually more 
the vegetable dish is probably like four  
dollars U.S so all in all seven dollars 
and then the beer is about two very good
thank you
all right guys I'm here with Andy also a fellow 
YouTuber and we are in the small Lagoon right  
very beautiful Waters here and actually 
very shallow we almost got stuck um but it's  
super common here and the waters are like super 
turquoise beautiful scaling Cliffs it's amazing

so guys we are at our fourth destination um 
but unfortunately it was pouring rain when  
we got here so I don't have contacts in today 
because my eyes are hurting and obviously I  
can't wear my glasses when it's pouring rain so 
I wasn't able to join uh the half of our group  
that went into the cave but just wanted to let 
you know that if you go on two or see there is  
supposed to be like a really cool taste that 
is here that you can go but I had fun swimming  
with the other half of the group here and 
it is really really beautiful absolutely
so friends we are at our last stop of the 
tour which is Paradise Beach all in all  
I have had an absolutely fabulous time in 
El Nido I would definitely come back and I  
would highly urge you guys to visit if you're 
in the Philippines also just want to make a  
note of how lovely all the people on my tours 
have been like Filipinos in general from my  
experience so far are like the friendliest 
people they're so welcoming and as a Solo  
Traveler it's just been so nice to you know be 
included and be part of the group so it's just  
been a really fun time let me know in the 
comments if you guys have ever been to El  
Nido what were your favorite things to see and 
do and as always I'm sending you guys so much  
love I hope you're having a fantastic day and
