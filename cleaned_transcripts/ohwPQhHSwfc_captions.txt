without any further ado arthenari and let
me be the one okay let's go
[Music]
just that first stone should tell you exactly
how this performance will go because it was
so lightweight but so stable it was he was
barely touching that tone but it was so stable
and he has a little bit of huskiness in his
natural tone and if you add a little bit more
air in those husky tones oh gorgeous okay
we're gonna start from the beginning because
i didn't want to interrupt immediately but
i just wanted to be like if you don't see
how this performance will be from just that
first time [Music]
he truly is the soul king like the soul as
a genre fits him [Music] but it doesn't change
[Music]
[Music]
a little bit of a voice breaks here and there
it's mainly the difference between when he's
going with a full unnatural voice
so strong beginning dispersed into a lot of
air it's very typical for bluesy and soul
type of singing which he absolutely mustered
uh please let me know if he ever like disclosed
who are his like favorite singers or who are
his like a singing idols because i would love
to know i i think it's gonna be mainly from
this kind of sphere like a blues and and uh
and more of the soul type of r b singing because
it is so heavily influenced by that is really
gorgeous also that little bit of a voice break
the little bit of a yolo so typical for that
as well very beautiful [Music]
so nice full belt again he knows exactly when
he should go with a belty voice and where
he should lift it up to that very gorgeous
a little fan but nicely cushioned with a
nicely reconnected back very premium
[Music]
[Music]
sun came out [Music]
[Music]
literal sun came out for arthur here such
a gorgeous work with the voice and vocal orange
he um is so carefully choosing which places
he will use actually his natural belt and
where he's gonna go in that very like angelic
gorgeous head voice and he's hitting it so
precise that high tone was literally angelic
very very pretty but thanks to his grounded
quality it was not too metallic and thin it
was actually it still had a very very very
pretty color [Music]
[Music]
that run okay i will replay this part because
that part was gorgeous you can actually hear
his work with air and those higher tones how
the air is you can literally hear how the
air is going through the vocal cords and how
gorgeously stabilized it is there and it's
creating this beautiful sound then he absolutely
showcases his control with that slide down
so ah that little riff on the way down so
we're gonna get a stronger chesty part where
he knew that it's gonna sound very strong
and very um kind of dominant in the sound
to go with his full voice which is very very
beautiful and then we're gonna get a very
nice jump from that nicely anchored in a very
high
such a pretty place that was so well done
with so much like thought put into it okay
so listen to this part [Music]
[Music] excuses [Music] i love you [Music]
dear jerker [Applause] absolutely jerker of
a song oh my god oh just imagine somebody
would sing you this song and don't tell me
you would not be like a melted puddle on the
ground just ah so gorgeous every single time
i listen to arthur like i'm excited every
time but every time he exceeds my expectations
like by miles like by miles and miles it's
really a pleasure to listen to every single
piece that he sings because he's he puts so
much detail and so much thought and so much
care into every song he sings he gives so
much emotion and he knows his strengths he
knows that his core voice is pretty pretty
substantial and big so imagine he would be
belting the like majority of the song it would
be very overpowering but he is so incredibly
secure in those like higher registers of his
voice and he's using them so gorgeously he
is doing a lot of jumps from natural up to
those like uh higher places
that little jump that little technique is
so pretty i personally like to use it a lot
too it is a nice jump that is anchored and
then like diffused into that higher space
and uh he's working with air very very beautifully
as well he has a lot of times he starts from
the very clean tone and disperse it into much
more much more aspirated uh end of that phrase
overall that is a really nice play with dynamics
which i always appreciate but he is on another
level with that and it's nice to sit down
and listen to every part of the song and the
way he approached it and the way he studied
it and study what he did it's really really
fascinating but aside from the technical aspects
of his singing there is a soul in it there
is a heart in it and that is that is the most
important thing about arthur when he delivers
a song it's so believable that's what you
want to achieve and with not yelling at them
with not having the belt session of the century
but with actually capturing them with your
voice and the way you work with it so this
is why he is so incredibly admirable well
i'm very this was a gorgeous rendition of
let me be the one and i'm very excited for
