good morning,
it's really our last day in Cebu
This is that car I'm not sure if we
showed this to you but
It's our little vroom vroom in cebu
here we go
it's not as warm today
but it's humid
and it's a little overcast
I don't know
if it's gonna rain, but we'll work with
it all right, so where we going first?
further out?
I think that sounds like a good plan
50 pesos
thank you
hey guys today we are at the beautiful
Sirao gardens just outside of Cebu City
on the other side of the mountain,
that overlooks the city
you can see
beautiful terraced gardens here with
flowers and lots of different foliage
and statuary this is called little
Amsterdam because some of the flowers
and the windmills that they have in the
gardens are reminiscent of Amsterdam
now if you want to get the picture of
the famous hand that everybody puts on
Instagram you actually have to go to the
garden next door which is about a
hundred yards to the left as you're
facing the entrance and pay fifty pesos
per person to get into that garden to
get that shot
totally worth it because that is
actually a nicer garden I think what we
think with great views and vistas
there's a bit of construction going on
today but we still got some great flower
pics and it's great to be out here in
nature amongst the trees and the fresh
air on the other side of Cebu City and
in the heat
it's also really hot out
and we haven't had breakfast
So, next on our agenda is to grab a bite to
eat maybe something to drink
share coke with a friend
getting some
corn for breakfast
mmm
smoky and tasty
that hits the spot
we are just down the road from the garden
at the beautiful Temple of Leah
Which is truly a monument of love,
this is a building built in the
classical style by a wealthy Filipino
businessman as a monument to his wife
who passed away, she originally traveled
and collected a lot of different things
so they were gonna build a small vault
to display all her things but he wanted
to build something much bigger because
he loved her very much and so they built
this temple here which they
named after her called the temple of Leah
it's not completed yet they are actually
going to put a restaurant in on the top
it sounds like
but they have the scenic
view, panoramic view you can see Cebu
City from here
you can see from of the
surrounding mountains and landscapes
really beautiful place to come and we
can't go in into the building into the
interior unfortunately because of the
construction but we can walk around on
the inside of this atrium right in front
which we are going to do show you some
some of the stunning aspects and the
chandeliers here of the buildings and
these two Golden Lions in the front
almost looks like the New York Public
Library but a really beautiful building
right here in the center of
the Philippines on Cebu Island
okay so
you can walk all around this building
and just peer into the windows here it's
open to the air you could almost reach
in and I can literally touch this clock
here which I'm sure it's worth thousands
of dollars and it's I guess it's all her
stuff that they're storing in some day
are going to display but now it's just
kind of left in this
essentially like
leaving it in your garage and there's
some amazing pieces in here
I don't know
where they come from but I'm sure they
were acquired over a lifetime of travel
and are just kind of sitting here and I
guess this is what happens when you pass
away and you don't have any kids to give
your stuff to or you just want to keep
it in memoriam I'm sure it'll be an
amazing awesome like museum experience
once they get all this pretty remarkable
but also pretty remarkable to see it in
its current state under construction I
would have thought they would take more
efforts to kind of protect it from the
elements but here it is
and here it is
for us to see
and we're taking a good
long look at it because it's really
really interesting actually
okay we have made it down to the
harbor you guys
and we're at Fort San
Pedro, hoping to go in and see Magellan's
cross, as you may be able to hear it's
pouring down rain I don't know if you
got some of the shots earlier but coming
down the mountain
and open up the sky open up
and raining rushing down the mountains
everything like that it's not the first
time we've been in a rainstorm on this
vacation we have a big umbrella and it
kind of comes and goes so we're sitting
here in the car we're just kind of
waiting for things to die down a little
bit before we make a run to the front
door up here and go inside
it's warm out
it's a little bit wet but I think we can
handle it what do you think
we're here at the cross of Magellan
Ferdinand Magellan the cross that
actually encased in this outer casing of
would probably or ostensibly to protect
it from the elements and then you have
this little fresco around the outside
maybe the scene of him planting the
cross the story is that Ferdinand
Magellan when he first arrived in the
Philippines ordered a cross to be
planted you can see that up there
I guess that this is that cross although
some say that when Magellan crew
left
that's probably taking down or destroyed
so this may or may not be the original
piece but nonetheless there is a
monument here there's a church here
Ferdinand Magellan was the first person
to circumnavigate the globe so he
essentially was the first travel blogger
right and rode or sailed all the way
around the world from Spain to the
Philippines and unfortunately was killed
on Mactan Island where the airport is
near Cebu and did not make it the rest
of the way back to Spain by his crew did
so his crew is actually the first people
to sail around the world it's pretty
interesting piece of history and a nice
part of the history of the Philippines
and Cebu Island here
