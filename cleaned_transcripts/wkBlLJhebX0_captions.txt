i still can't get over how banging
breakfast was whoa they're banging i'm
not gonna this is genuinely the best
thing i've had in a while
hey guys i'm lyra from ghoulasgrub and
today i'm gonna be challenging my friend
godfrey to make two traditional kosovan
dishes and i've challenged my friend
lirum to make two filipino meals for the
day this is gonna be great to see how he
fares so the two meals i've challenged
lyra to make are for breakfast he's
gonna be making a banana spring roll
called turon and for dinner he's going
to be making the delicious barbecue pork
skewers i've been quite kind to godfrey
with these so the first kosovan dish is
called lucuma these are basically fried
doughnuts the second dish is pasul it's
basically a bean stew it's a good taste
into kosovo and cuisine for him i think
fingers crossed he enjoys it i'm excited
i'm starving let's go
beautiful delicious breakfast lucuma now
with the lakuma it's not a traditional
dose it doesn't need to proof it doesn't
need to rise you don't need to wait
around it's super simple all it is is
some plain yogurt a couple eggs some
baking powder a bit of flour you whack
that all together into a bowl until it
forms a dough simple as what could go
wrong right you say right look this
ain't right am i supposed to do this
once the dough has been formed all you
need to do is cut out any shape that you
want oh yeah
i think i've got that plaster heartbeat
now fry until golden brown on both sides
you're going to watch them puff up it's
going to be really cool oh
they're rising
hey i burnt the first batch
this batch is looking
somewhat better and then you just enjoy
with whatever you want either and feta
like i do or if you prefer sweet nutella
i hope you enjoy my man here are my
lakuma's ones looking burnt hella burnt
it's probably my best one oh no wrong
i don't think i cooked it for long
enough you know
[Applause]
however
it's not bad no i think i undercooked it
a little bit i started seeing it getting
burnt so i was like oh no so i panicked
liram hooked me up with some hot sauce
feta cheese and some edge bar
oh oh oh
that is buff when i go custom while i'm
asking for this for breakfast and the
lucuma is like fluffy but it's got a
nice crunch on the outside i'm going to
try it with nutella
[Music]
because this is fresh and with nutella
it bangs wow thank you for showing me
this this is such a good breakfast i
would have this every day
in fact i might have it for the next
week because i still got those left
is basically a plantain spring roll i
know it's a bit sweet for breakfast but
i thought why not start lyriums they are
for the treat so to start off you peel
your plantain and then you cut it into
flat rectangular shapes next step is
getting your bowl of sugar and covering
your plantain in the sugar i've actually
never cooked plantain before it's gonna
be interesting then you get your
jackfruit and you cut them up next this
is where you build your spring roll so
you get the spring roll sheet get your
plantain then your jackfruit and then
you roll it up nicely sealing it with a
bit of water right i've rolled up the
two on i've got 13 of these bad boys i
can't wait to fry them and try them the
next bit is where it gets messy because
you're going to be frying it in oil and
when it's nice and golden take them out
this looks
absolutely delicious my mouth
is watering i don't really know
it's crispy as hell
[Music]
let them cool down for a bit
oh
that is so good
oh my god
and you can see kind of formed like a
caramel layer almost
like the sugar from the coating of the
plantain but if anything was added to
the crunch in the flavor so godfrey
where have you been hiding this for me
absolutely delicious i would 100 make
this again i can't get over how banging
breakfast first so i've eaten so much
thank god we're not doing lunch we're
moving on to dinner
there's not much to it it just takes
time it needs a bit of love and a bit of
care so you need to soak the beans
overnight then beans had to soak
overnight here they are the beans
and then whack the heat on you boil it
for around an hour and then in a
separate frying pan you're gonna add
onions sweat those down with some chili
flakes some paprika really add in some
flavor i've also given him some jokes so
he can cut that up and it's gonna add
even more flavor to it
it's got like bits in it and all you're
gonna do is add that to the beans and
water and there you have it you have
pasoli
i'm excited to see what he does with it
good luck to you this person and sergio
smells so good these pastel beans
basically are the legit stuff because
this came straight from kosovo so shout
out to liran for hooking me up
oh the pastor's got so much flavor
inside it by itself i don't know if
it's because it's soaked up the rest of
the soup the sujo goes so well with the
salt it's it's like savoy but much
better there's a bit more flavor to it
there's a bit more kick to it i'll have
it again and also i feel like you can
mix and match with the kind of meat you
put in this i definitely want to try
this with beef as well as the sujoo and
it goes so well with bread oh if you get
a soup right which i feel like i have
it's banging
when you go to a filipino barbecue these
are often the star of the show first you
want to get your pork and cut them into
cubes and put them to one side
filipino's loving ingredient called
banana ketchup so you're gonna need it
for this bit interesting
oh
that's good get your banana ketchup
seven up soy sauce vinegar oyster sauce
brown sugar ground pepper and garlic add
the marinade to the meat and let it sit
there for about an hour
next grab your skewers and start putting
your marinated pork onto the skewers now
we've got to create the barbecue sauce
which is the banana ketchup oyster sauce
and some sesame oil mix that all up this
smells incredible this glaze
oh oh yeah
and get that ready for when you're
cooking the meat so my barbecue
is out of action so i've had to settle
for one of these
little bad boys
time to put your meat on the grill and
let that cook for a little bit
once they cook turn them over and apply
your glaze and let that cook i'm so
jealous of learning right now these are
so tasty and trust me once he has one
he's not gonna want to stop tell me this
doesn't look incredible if you could
smell this right now you'd be very
impressed like they're sweet
savoury pungent
without further ado let's just dive in
right
[Music]
wow
first and foremost i'd like to thank
myself because that pork is cooked
perfectly super juicy i'm not like this
is genuinely the best thing i've had in
a while and you know what there's proof
godfrey show them the screenshot like
just flavors i never would think to put
together worth it godfrey you're a man
thank you this trumps the plantain
spring rolls even though those were
delicious this is my number one like
thank you for the recipe and this is
going to be a part of my staple diet
what an intro to customer food that was
for me even though i had to cook it the
person was delicious even with this a
joke but for me the star of the show had
to be the fukuma first thing in the
morning it was just
beautiful right i've had my taste in the
philippines and i must say it was
absolutely delicious if you enjoyed this
