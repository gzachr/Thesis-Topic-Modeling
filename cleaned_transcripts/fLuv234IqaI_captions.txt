(upbeat music)
(laughter)
- Mackenzie!
- Oh, that was thick.
It was good though.
(playful music)
- Have you ever had Filipino food before?
- I've had like, a little bit.
I went to PCN last year, and that was like
my first exposure to Filipino food.
So I don't know a lot about it.
- I've never had Filipino
food outside of Hawaii before.
So I think it's gonna be interesting
if there's a difference
within the cultures
of being from Hawaii and
having Filipino food there,
and having Filipino food
here in the mainland.
- It's hard to explain,
because in the Philippines
they have a lot of different regions,
and each region has their
own specific dishes.
So for us, it's a lot of grilled
meats and grilled fishes.
Those are always my favorite
because it's very home-y.
- Yeah.
- I'm excited to try it.
And eat.
- I'm actually really looking
forward to the lumpia,
because anything fried is delicious.
- Yeah, Filipinos fry everything.
- The first thing is vegetable lumpia.
So in here, there's
usually just green beans,
carrots, it kinda just depends.
Oh, looks like they have
some noodles in here.
And then for dipping
sauce, it's usually just
Thai chili sauce.
So, you wanna try one?
You can have that half.
- Okay.
(laughter)
- Okay, we can cheers it.
- Oh, hell yeah.
(laughing)
- It's really good.
It reminds me of the ones
that my mom used to buy
at this little street market.
But they would have it
with chili pepper water.
And that's my favorite
dipping sauce for it.
It's really good with
Thai chili sauce too.
- That sauce is very good.
- That's good.
Anything with sweet chili
sauce is good though.
- It's very pickled.
- Is it?
- Which is interesting-- yeah.
I guess it's more of the vinegar.
That's like a spicy vinegar.
It's pretty good, it's
different from what I'm used to.
But then, I'm Filipino too.
- It's yummy, it is good.
- It's a little falling apart.
- Just a little.
- So what do you think of it?
- I think it's good.
- It's like a Filipino spring roll.
- Uh huh, if it wasn't
falling apart as much.
But, pretty solid.
- I like it, it's different than
other lumpia I've had before.
It's thicker, but it's good.
It's really good.
- It's good, and I feel like
if you're buying this at
a food truck too, you kind of expect more.
So, it was good.
I like it.
- Filling.
- Excited to try more.
- Okay, so our second dish is pancit.
And this is something that's
at every Filipino party,
whether it's a birthday or graduation.
And I think it's kind of just like--
I think someone explained it to me like,
it was for good luck or
having a good, long life.
Because, look at the noodles.
- Usually pancit is any
sort of rice noodle dish.
So they can put all
sorts of things in there.
It's kind of like,
whatever you have around.
Usually there's like, carrots and celery,
usually protein, sometimes they put
hard boiled eggs in there,
which I think I saw.
And then you squeeze some lemon
over it and it's super good.
I'm excited.
- Cheersies!
What do you think?
- Oh yeah, that's pretty good.
- And there's pepper.
- Ooh, pepper-y.
- Yeah, lots of pepper.
- I should live long for this.
Long life.
(laughter)
- Oh, it's good!
I like it.
- Is it weird that I think it tastes like
chicken noodle soup a little bit?
- No, it does.
- It does.
- I mean that's the thing
about pancit, it's very home-y.
- Yeah, comforting.
- Exactly.
- My grandpa's from the
Philippines, so he used to
make me Filipino food
when I was growing up.
And everything was super fresh.
The meat and everything was
like, made in my backyard.
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah, this is very familiar.
- Yeah.
- This is like-- this is the
pancit we have at every party.
- Yeah.
- In the big, aluminum containers.
- Growing up, I always used to go to my
great grandma and my great grandpa's house
and my grandpa immigrated
to Hawaii from Loag in like,
the early 1900's to work on
the sugarcane plantation.
So, he used to make
Filipino food all the time.
That's really all he did.
He loved cooking and I was
his favorite grandchild,
so he just cooked me whatever I wanted.
And yeah, I think that was
like always just something fun.
That my mom used to just
drop me off at their house
and they would take care of me.
So, I think that's like one of the
biggest memories of my childhood.
Just hanging out with my great grandpa.
- Aw, that's so cute.
- Everything was really good.
- Everything was good.
It was very-- yeah, home-y
is the word I'd use.
- Yeah, for sure.
- It's very familiar and comforting.
- I thought it was super good.
Like, I would definitely
eat lumpia and that,
what was it called again?
- Pancit.
- Pancit again.
Like, pretty good.
And with all the garlic
that's infused in the food.
- Yeah, especially if you
have the lumpia fresh,
and it's still crispy and hot,
that's like the best time to eat it.
- I do think that the lumpia was good,
it was just not what I was expecting.
And I think when I think of Filipino food,
it's always like, "well
this is what I'm eating
when I'm sitting on the
couch with my mama,"
and so I think maybe
just my expectations were
a little off, but it was still good food.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- I think it was really good.
I think it tasted like
someone made it at home.
Like, kind of reminded me
of my grandpa's cooking.
That's like really comforting,
just being so far away
from home, that I can kind
of feel like that just from
some of the food here.
- I wish the lumpia was hot,
but it was still really, really good.
I think anything fried,
the best time to eat it--
- Right when it's piping hot.
- Exactly. And it's super crispy--
- And it burns your mouth a little bit.
But it's like--
- It's so worth it.
- Exactly.
- Definitely gonna try to explore
some of the Filipino places around here.
- I would say definitely
if you haven't tried
Filipino food before, definitely try it.
It's delicious and awesome.
- A great way for you to
celebrate Filipino heritage month
is taking your friends out to
eat at a Filipino restaurant
and maybe trying something
new, like how we did today.
So, I'm definitely gonna be
taking all of my housemates
and trying to find a Filipino restaurant,
so we can all experience
my culture together.
