live and many of them said Canada so in this 
video we're gonna go on the streets of Toronto

Filipinos about life in Canada uh hi what's your  
name hi my name is crystalin crystalline who 
is this beautiful girl here this is Maui Maui
what kind of dog is she she's an Australian 
Shepherd and Border Collie mix and if you  
don't mind me are you Filipino by chance I am 
yeah born and raised in Scarborough actually so  
here in Canada about my parents are both from the 
Philippines oh what a big coincidence I just came  
from the Philippines I was there for five months 
so cool uh tell me what do you like about Canada  
what is there not to like about Canada I I  
will say kind of um the multiculturalism I 
think is what really hits home for me right now  
um it's definitely the free health care yeah I 
went to uh to the US not too long ago actually and  
um ended up almost breaking my leg oh wow and 
that was like a big eye opener for me so I think  
definitely the free healthcare here um I don't 
know it's it's hard to say I've lived here for  
28 years I love everything about Canada have you 
been back to the Philippines ever um I have once  
uh I think I was in grade five maybe around 10 
11 years old unfortunately that was the last  
time that we went back but a beautiful country 
for sure of course I have to agree for sure and  
is there anything that you dislike or that 
can be improved maybe about Canada in Canada
the only thing that I dislike and I actually don't 
think there's any way of changing it but just it's  
it's how busy it's getting maybe it is just here 
in Toronto I'm finding that in these last few  
years the infrastructure and like the condos all 
we keep doing is building up and I feel like we  
do not have the room for it you can't keep up on 
the road no I think that's it though there's not  
really anything we can do I like that there's 
a lot of inclusion I like that we're bringing  
in obviously people from other countries but that 
is it's getting a little bit busy for sure and uh  
if you remind me asking are you schooling 
right now are you working what do you do  
um I actually manage at a place called The Keg 
so it's a steakhouse I did finish school quite  
a while ago actually I ended up doing 
um early childhood education at Ryerson  
um but as you know life kind of happens and things 
change so the goal right now actually for me is to  
move up in the industry and eventually in the next 
five years maybe even my own Cafe our restaurant  
sounds amazing well thank you so much for your 
time I appreciate it yeah it was my pleasure

so tell me when did you come to Canada from the 
Philippines I came this last December 2020. oh  
so you're very fresh to Canada yes I am tell me 
what brought you to Canada from the Philippines  
I am actually an international student so I study 
business marketing here in at Seneca College oh  
very nice and how has been your experience what do 
you like the most about Canada so far well I think  
mainly the people itself people are just very I 
think um kind same as uh what what Filipinos are  
how Filipinos are like to other people so the 
people and also how the government balance its  
um you know Industries like for example the 
buildings and also these views the Park yeah  
for sure it's a beautiful place now tell me some 
things that you don't really like about Canada
can I be honest yeah of course be honest I've 
done this in the Philippines so now it's your  
turn to talk smack about Canada I think when it 
comes to wait I can't really think about something  
think about maybe your lifestyle right now what 
can be improved cost of living infrastructure  
oh yeah number one thing is the cost of living and 
special inflation it's just so huge right now like  
um if you are living just a minimum wage earner 
you can't really afford living here especially in  
Toronto because it's just so expensive so yeah I 
think the inflation rate excellent now if you had  
any advice for someone from the Philippines that 
wants to come to Canada what would you tell them  
um if you have a dream of coming here to Canada 
I think just go for it um there's nothing really  
I think I mean I would suggest coming here in 
Canada for your own future as well especially  
have if you have families uh Canada is really a 
great country especially when it comes to their  
health system their education so uh yeah just 
don't give up awesome thank you so much for your  
time I appreciate it you're welcome now do you 
have any social media anything you want to promote

been here for six years okay six 
years and what brought you here  
uh well a lot of my family members are here so 
okay it's easier for us to be like together of  
course and tell me what are some things 
you love about Canada so far um Medical
uh because here a lot like you know 
medical staff are covered mostly covered  
by the government which I love yeah that's 
that's one thing I would like and I'm also  
uh the difference between the Philippines is like  
um even you graduate it's hard to find a 
job but here even your high school graduate  
find a lot of jobs because we've establishment 
here actually how do I say they support the  
students for sure yeah okay and tell me one 
thing maybe you don't like about Canada so far
of course that's huge amount of taxes but you 
know I mean when it comes to like medical stuff  
I would say that it is worth it okay but it's 
just you know if you're making minimum it's really  
thank you so I think uh cost of living is positive 
living is high rent um accommodation is like
really bought accommodation and
to the room what about the Canadian Winters we got 
used to the snow and everything I got used to it  
but I still love summer like the best time that 
you're waiting for it's easier to go to work as  
well like when it's snowing I mean when I was back 
home you see the movie it looks really good but  
yeah it looks pretty but like reality reality is 
not really it makes it it makes it hard too okay  
and are you single are you married if you don't 
mind me asking what's the relationship status  
I have a boyfriend okay is he kidding yeah 
people want to know are you Canadian or is  
it Filipino he's Canadian okay and is there 
any difference dating Canadians and Filipinos  
sorry is there any difference dating 
a Canadian compared to a Filipino
um that's a hard question I think it's it depends 
I mean there's no I think in general like I don't  
have any preferences um also even you're a 
Filipino when you live in Canada for so long
