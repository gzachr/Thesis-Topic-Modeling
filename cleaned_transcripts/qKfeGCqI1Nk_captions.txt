Good to see you all
This is Chanwoo from CHANWOO’S LIFE
[Applause]
So today,
When I visited Philippines
[Taro shaved ice]
I really enjoyed Halo-Halo
[Back when traveling was easy in 2018]
I remember Jinhwan
Had already been to Philippines a couple times
So he also enjoyed Halo-Halo very much
[Find out what happened]
[Via the link above!]
[Perfect for hot autumn days]
I had a sudden craving for Halo-Halo
So I searched it up
It’s not exactly Halo-Halo
[Mais Con Yelo]
Filipino Corn & Shaved Ice
The ingredients are
Frozen milk, corn, condensed milk
And that’s it
I’ll be making Halo-Halo
[Halo-Halo + Mais Con Yelo]
But add corn
[Chanwoo’s Self-Made Combined Shaved Ice]
[Yelo Halo]
To briefly explain the ingredients
[Milk shaved ice, corn, condensed milk, pudding, Injeolmi, cereal, mango, red beans, ice-cream]
[Milk shaved ice, corn, condensed milk, pudding, Injeolmi, cereal, mango, red beans, taro ice-cream]
[Taro ice-cream]
Halo-Halo is made of taro
So let’s get started right away
[Cheating]
Since we’re putting in corn
We need to get rid of the salty taste
Let’s put it in water for about 10 minutes
Get some water
Should I just dump it all in?
You should first filter it
There’s corn water
Good idea
Get rid of the corn water
Leave in water for 10 minutes
And come back later
Then the salty taste will be gone
Now with the milk shaved ice
[Start!]
Making Chanwoo’s Yelo Halo
1. Put milk shaved ice in a cup
But first I wanna try this by itself
[Yum]
Mm
2. Spill a little bit
[Wiggle]
I spilled it all over
Milk shaved ice
I’m not sure of the exact amount
3. Get self-conscious
Oh this is it
This much
4. Have another bite
[Mm]
Ugh I’m so bad at decorating
I will go with the safest choice
And that is?
Mango
How can you say that…?
5. Put in some mango
Is this too much?
Already I can see
It looks good
6. Put in some cereal
A little
Red beans
7. Put in some red beans
[Not-so-easy red beans]
Rice cake and jelly
I really like the kind of rice cake in shaved ice
Oh
So anyway
8. Put in a lot of your favorite toppings
[Spill]
Maybe that’s a little too much
Lemme try some
9. Keep calm and try some
Mm
[It is Injeolmi]
Injeolmi taste
Jelly
This looks suspicious
Or should I go with this?
This is just my style
I will try to scoop it up nicely
[Busy hand]
10. Scoop up jelly and add to the cup
[A pinch]
[So little]
Why are you laughing?
It’s sort of
I always say this when I’m making something but
Looks good
Should I add some of these as well?
These little fruits?
And next
The corn
Let’s bring the corn
Whatever
Put in a lot of corn
It’s covering the toppings underneath
If you look from the side
There are so many toppings
Look
Cereal
Rice cake
Corn
Red beans
Mango
Jelly
It’s finished everyone
[Chanwoo-made]
Filipino Corn Halo-Halo
I made it
[Whispers]
Ice-cream… You forgot ice-cream…
[Sassy]
And condensed milk
Be quiet!
I was just about to put in ice-cream
[Stubborn]
In the end
Now that looks like Halo-Halo
Even though I probably won’t finish it
I’m worried about gaining weight
I used to really like condensed milk
With strawberries
That’s enough
That’s it
It’s complete everyone
It’s everything that makes you fat
I could see this
Don’t you all agree?
Since desserts are so overpriced nowadays
We could charge 10,000 won
[Happy thought]
I will try it
I wonder what it tastes like
I’m trying to dig in
[Not so easily]
But the toppings are not letting me
The corn is so good
Just having the ice-cream with corn
It sort of tastes like
When you’re having Halo-Halo
I don’t exactly remember
But the taste was definitely original
I haven’t tasted anything like this in Korea either
Tasty
It’s very tasty
But one downside is
I shouldn’t have put in the jelly
It doesn’t get along
[Grape flavor]
When will I get to the shaved ice?
[Mining]
[Finally]
[Yum]
[Crunch]
I finally got to the shaved ice part
Shaved ice with cereal is my fave
If I had to get rid of one topping
Then I’d say
Get rid of the jelly
Add more cereal
And it would be nice to have
A shaved ice cup
Since we can’t travel
We have to make our own snacks
I wanna travel
So today,
I tried making my own Halo-Halo
It was really good
If the original one was a 9/10
I would give this one an 8.5/10
It was that good
[Except for corn, ice-cream, jelly]
These ingredients are from Sulbing
Maybe that’s why it was so gowkld
Maybe that's why it was so good.
These ingredients are easy to find
Jelly, cereal…
I’m sure you can try this at home
[And Chan-gus]

I’m sure you will invite me over for some real Halo-Halo
