this video is brought to you by Squarespace
we are in the Philippines I will be doing
the number one thing to do when you come to
this beautiful country that of course is Island
Hopping God I've never seen a beach like this
with the colour of the water [Music]
[Laughter]
the Philippines is made up of over 7 000 Islands
some of which are regarded as the best in
the world in today's video we'll be taking
the very popular tour a from El Nido to the
surrounding islands of Northern Palawan
no thanks
I know yeah good we we did have hopes to get
one of those wet bags we haven't got one yet
and it goes to sell them on his head now so
I hope we don't forget that all right so we're
just waiting on our boat and story child or
a just been the one that has been most recommended
to us supposed to be if you're going to do
any of them tour a is the best tool to do
so yeah we're really excited being given a
little sticker and that's just for our lunch
then so launch has been clouded as well and
so yeah we'll just wait a boat we can leave
these here yes oh and you come back you will
get here okay okay thank you so much welcome
all right okay so the price of the tour in
total was 1600 peso each but we have to pay
extra I think it's 300 pesos when we get to
the Lagoon to rent kayak that's where the
two of us and then just here we're after uh
paying 400 peso to rent some shoes and our
snorkels nice so we think they're boring the
boat now yes there all right let's go okay
so we have to walk through the door
weather update glorious so hopefully it stays
that way there is a bit of a storm due later
on today so we'll see how how far we can uh
we can make it with the lovely sunshine
this one oh there you go around that way look
boy Kraken start as usual Rambo anyway we
got it we got told it was just in time so
I'm getting on the right one now
to do this thing would have gone around everyone
on the boat asking their name and National
ity
what's your name sir Keelan Kayla yeah
Samantha are you from Ireland Ireland
seven Commando Beach
[Music] he actually seems like a big crack
as well so I think it's gonna be a great day
[Music]
we're here oh my God
it's amazing he's just going through where
what we can do here so we can basically get
in for a swim if we want um snorkel then as
well we have our snorkels so yeah it's amazing
isn't it there's a smartest header it's five
stops on this tour so if they're all as good
as this one it's going to be Sunday because
these these little beaches that they just
find on these Bowl trips are just like you
know the little jams little pieces of paradise
they really are the only way you can get over
to them is viable
but he can see right true insane isn't it
yeah it's unbelievable
and now I didn't think it could get any better
Paradise Island yeah God I've never seen a
beach like this like a natural roar I know
what happened until tomorrow where we see
another one or something like you know what
I mean yeah the Philippines so well definitely
I can see why they are now for the best beaches
in the world because they're definitely so
far the best beaches that vote me yeah we

for sponsoring today's video and continuing
to support content creators like us the beach
itself is actually quite small it's kind of
just like a little Hidden Beach I guess you'd
say and then it's like a little palm trees
and stuff like that so there's bits you can
come in and get a little bit of shave um yeah
they're playing a bit of sports and there's
like a little kind of a shack up here that
I think is selling like coffee or or cocktails
probably more likely yeah
um yeah it's 10 tomorrow and like I said four
stop it's absolutely gorgeous beautiful it's
a fairly busy to be fair and like we said
about El Nido it's all about tour a b c and
d and so you know most people when they come
to La though they actually do the island happened
tour so that's we're gonna have a lot of people
that are on these beautiful islands but um
if I'm being honest I don't think it takes
away from just how beautiful it is to be here
I was just gonna say that yeah it doesn't
it's so beautiful that yeah it doesn't matter
that it's crowded with me take away from it
honestly we're just so happy to be here yeah
[Music]
wait so that was a lovely little stop we think
we're getting called back over to our boat
we're not used or there is a few votes pulled
in but we actually didn't get in for a swim
in the end and we do have plenty of stuff
so that's why when we chilled in we just had
like a juice and it was just nice chill out
when people watch it and take it all in
as well and the reason why it's called deeper
Lagoon is because there is a little hole in
the cliffs that we have to swim through to
get to it
there's no secret anymore thank you
wow
[Music] Sweet let's do it
oh it's again the queue
you're getting a queue [Music] basically there's
a queue to get through the little nap there's
only one Gap that brings the shoes to the
next one so that's the way it's just kind
of trying to organize chaos basically
later
all right
so basically it's a small Lagoon um it's absolutely
gorgeous honestly the water is so calm and
Kaitlin are just saying it just doesn't float
around here it's just so relaxing it's so
nice it's a perfect temperature as well and
everybody's just chilling there's some gorgeous
spots it's like open as well you can see up
above it sort of has some like green Greenery
coming down the Rocks it's just really really
stunning and then like the formation of the
cliffs to make this little degree on is just
amazing honestly natural beauty at its best
also it's not too deep because we're actually
standing in it as well so some parents you
can't stand when you go more into the middle
of it but at the moment we're sort of over
at the edge and you can actually touch the
ground yes as he was saying secret Lagoon
obviously because of where it is and how you
get here it's uh you're not going to stumble
across this you kind of need to know where
you're going hence the name secret Lagoon
but it's not so much a secret as he said when
we're leaving the ball there's loads of people
here and as well there's only one way in and
one way out so that's where there's um it
kind of blocks up and stuff like that so I'll
take us a bit of time to get in but that's
Amanda said now that we're here it's absolutely
gorgeous it's very unique I don't want to
give over some and something like this before
where it's just completely closed after everything
else it's just like a circular Lagoon and
surrounded by big Cliffs and then you can
just swim it's all calm as well in comparison
to when we were coming in the waves were literally
just throwing us all over the place and uh
here it's just like it's like just dead the
water is just you can just flow it's absolutely
beautiful [Music] thank you [Music]
[Music]
okay sorry
bye [Music] okay yeah
[Music] um
thank you very much oh yeah and how much
I love that yeah I got a bear to the boat
where would you get it everything is
be there just stopped now so we're basically
as you said it's like turning into the little
Club in restaurants and we're having some
food which is included as well in the tour
and the set office was amazing honestly the
food smells delicious and it looks delicious
so I can't wait to dig in
come on
[Music]
foreign
[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
Okay so we're stuffed after that lovely lunch
and then somehow we have to swim it's not
he's just saying there so this is a snorkeling
spot for that he said it's not the best snorkeling
spot so uh control your expectations I guess
is the is the right way of putting it but
we're going to get in anime and swim and and
see if we can see anything I'm too sure if
this is stop three or four but after this
then we have a canoe uh stop as well so our
kayak sorry so we're going to stop um in a
lagoon and do some kayaking as well but for
now it's just a little bit of snorkel you
can see here this is how the lands cook the
lunch it's like a little stove to make the
field the waste and then here is the leftovers
pushing the squids for pineapple muscles
through and yeah now I'm staring in the ship
you can feature it without snow snorkels on
like since he drove from here it's Crystal
Clear so clear look oh my God
amazing isn't it
right so we're back in the water we have a
little snorkeling stuff after having Foods
the field was really good as well uh we're
nice and full the city always makes you really
hungry but uh this water is so clear honestly
the coral is absolutely gorgeous it really
is there's not many fish in this part which
he told us that there probably wouldn't be
but it's just it's absolutely stunning
[Music]
thank you [Music] thank you [Music]
we found an email
[Music]
first okay
it's easy easy when you know hell isn't it
so easy so yes we've made it into the kayak
so we've got to um kayak down through a lagoon
they say it'll take about 50 minutes so um
but yeah so just the kind of cliffs open up
and you just go straight through it's absolutely
beautiful um it's quite busy as well a lot
of people are doing this so this is kind of
like I suppose the the highlight of the tour
is to do this um to do this kayak trip through
the uh the Lagoon so
you okay over there yeah he's doing all the
work oh my God it's absolutely stunning isn't
it again another paradise
oh my God how amazing is this it is absolutely
gorgeous underwater is actually so calm so
it's quite easy to kayak as well Caitlyn's
doing all the work there himself now I'm having
a little break and it's a perfect time of
the day as well and this one is absolutely
even down you can also rent these kill ones
as well they're like clear and they're just
[Music] fashion into it so yeah it was 300
pesos to rent the kayak that we're on or you
could pay 500 and rent the clear ones so we
just went to the normal kayak
is actually just canals everywhere bodies
ever some people even swimming
all right swinging left you don't want to
go into that cliff
there you go good good sharp torn lovely jobly
right now
get it that well we made it through without
scratch
for pros
right so we just have to stop them for a little
break
oh God I'm leaning on the side of it it's
so peaceful absolutely it's on the label I
just said one of their Awards this whole Vlog
is also saying how beautiful place is but
it's real like literally rewards to destroy
though amazingly pretty this country is yeah
there's no words to describe but only it's
literally stunning Paradise beautiful gorgeous
wow and then you go you go to one place this
might be the nicest place I've ever seen and
then the poll goes in 120 Minutes a year in
another place let's have endless amounts of
uh of student locations I can see why tour
a is very popular now I'm sure the other tours
are incredible as well and obviously if you
had more time we probably would do them all
because it's so beautiful but this is actually
the Highlight I think is renting The Kayaks
and the seller for tour a but uh we enjoyed
every bit of it didn't we yeah yeah the whole
tour the whole tour was amazing you know what
as well I have to say and we will leave a
link in the description but ton the nicest
fellas we've done tours all through South
East Asia and they're always great tours but
sometimes the fellas they own it can be over
here or sometimes they can be very rushed
as well oh yeah did a couple in Thailand and
sometimes
so nice to something Hollywood Airport's name
and everything yeah you know what I mean they
just go that extra little step it's great
it really is like they ask us their names
once at the beginning of it and he remembers
them and I think that's really great isn't
it like do you know what I mean to be calling
those Mario names and he's just he's so nice
as Kaylin said so friendly it's just a great
tour I'm so glad that we picked it honestly
like they've made the tour and they're so
it's so relaxing as I said some tours we've
done before have been very rushed but the
whole day has just been a dream it's just
so relaxing I mean it seems like we have a
lot of time at each spot so the tours are
very well planned out right left left now
left that's it that's right
big rockware that's real 80 feet right
okay yeah so right and left and pivot pivot
hit it
there's no left left oh yes Samantha I think
I see a little sea snake just to the left
can you see that wait yeah
keep going right there
all right Cole's there for a minute
Samantha doing all the work for a change
and chill look at the size of the clip and
now the cliff said spectacular that's the
word I described the most dominant and impressive
yeah truly told this entire tour has been
jar dropping do you know what it's so quiet
although you can hear other people that are
kayak and talking okay fine but in general
it's so peaceful and quiet isn't it you can
hear the nature in the world like just living
and for his little scrape it wasn't so bad
we didn't capsize which is always a bonus
in situations like that
over close to The Rock's Nails mounted look
you can almost touch them
well at least you've never been for Philippines
now is your time to put it on your pocket
[Music] foreign [Music]
