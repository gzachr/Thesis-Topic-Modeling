hello people welcome to a new episode here in the 
Philippines and we're now in Manila and we're here  
in the I would say a rather new area even though 
this area is Taguig so technically BGC is within  
Taguig but we're here in a very local area 
that I've never been here before I think this  
is actually our first time uh actually last time 
the first time we actually explore local area was  
the haircut video but this is local as local 
as you can get really so in the past in this  
channel we've made like budget content we've made 
luxury content But ultimately my goal of vlogging to  
show you guys my real travel experience whether 
it's the local side or the modern side yeah let's  
see so as you can see we're in this area of 
turkey and this is so different I think before  
this Vlog I didn't even know that like Target 
is this big and BGC is only like a dots of it
see lots of
cheese what is this so today it's not so 
we actually have a reason coming to this  
area today is because um so I've ordered like some 
supplements from America and the shipping company  
said it's arrived in Manila since February 14th 
oh actually oh you're in area got some grilled  
lamb Paws there yeah so talk about deliveries in 
America so it's actually arrived hey hello oh come  
in area hello hello yeah everybody's so friendly 
in Philippines uh but yeah so I was talking uh  
America and it's arrived in the Philippines 
actually last month in 14th of February on  
Valentine's Day it's arrived already for some 
reason it's got stuck in the delivery office  
even custom approved it I saw the status but yeah 
it's currently just stuck in uh office so now  
we're heading to Target post office hopefully you 
can find out what's going on with the package and  
uh if if all goes well maybe we can even get the 
package today all right let's find a post office
ah target post office here it is hopefully 
uh maybe they have our package here  
all right let's see let's see what they have 
here all right so yeah we've got this email  
here that says it's arrived the Philippines as 
the 14th of February and the shipment is arrived  
destination and handed over the local Postal 
Service it's went through custom already so I  
believe if there is a chance at the package 
might be stuck post office it might be a  
Target because you know we live in BGC all 
right so let's ask what's the view about it
luckily uh today there's not a lot of people  
around so uh looks like it's 
not going to be a long line  
in Worcester uh just want to follow up to see 
like where my package is the tracking number
because I saw online it arrived in 
February 14th it arrived in February  
14 but I still haven't received it yet so 
just thinking where where are the packages
looks like he's on to something now so uh 
maybe we'll be able to get our package today
as well yeah see that's the thing in the 
Philippines so we ordered this last month actually  
in January and arrived in February oh that's what 
he says yeah sure you have it here have here okay  
all right or they might actually have it here 
looks like we came to the right place but it's  
so strange because uh they don't send any uh 
emails or text message telling me the package yeah  
so I was just half guessing the whole 
time but uh and those who thought it  
was custom issue but then turns out 
it's arrived the post office already
okay all right thank you
wow this area is really something new to me  
it's so different to the other 
side of modern side of turkey oh
something
yeah so this is uh our first Philippines post 
office experience I guess and uh yeah it uh  
compared to other countries usually like usually 
in Australia especially usually in Australia on a  
war here they will have like lots of envelopes 
like lots of boxes and I just pick your own  
envelope and you can pay like it's a prepaid 
envelope Etc and usually on a counter like  
there are many computers and there were guides 
any behind it just to really like it it's like  
a fish here really just your paper the envelopes 
and the package and the boxes that you need for  
your delivery I also have heard a lot of rumors 
about like some sort of like scandals for post  
office here in the Philippines I'm not too sure 
if they're accurate or not but sometimes sometimes  
sometimes you might I need to ask you might be 
asked or be scammed to pay for like a big fee  
for receiving International Parcels so let's see 
what the situation is later I hope later we don't  
have to pay for anything because I think I saw 
online on quora there is like a case where some  
foreigners actually have to pay almost the same 
price as the package cost because scam Etc so uh  
hopefully uh we've got it here and we don't have 
to run around run around different post office  
to find our package it's so strange though they 
didn't send me any emails or text message even  
if it arrives post office so I've been waiting for 
this for one month already and I'm really worried  
that you might be lost but looks like they're onto 
some things hopefully we can take our package here
ah looks like it's going to be a big box
ah this one wait this one
okay let's squeeze right in hello is there
good morning
112
right on top good morning
wow they use our paperwork in the Philippines 
they have like a book record thank you wow  
yeah so here in the Philippines when you 
receive package sometimes you do have to  
pay specialist International pasos I think 
uh because for some reason for example if  
I write my address at home in BGC anyways it 
goes to the post office and they charge extra  
for the local service so it's something very 
interesting only in the Philippines I think  
usually the sender would pay everything including 
the exact like DX shells like DHL Express it comes  
directly to your home and you don't have to pay 
extra all right so now that we've got a package  
it's time to go get breakfast right all right 
sell them at poor thank you thank you thank you  
yeah so nice and anyway now we have a second 
mission actually so today apart from post getting  
our post uh Paso we are also getting breakfast 
here so I think we have never actually had a  
proper Filipino breakfast so I'm very interested 
by now what exactly is Filipino breakfast and  
um I Heard Filipino people actually eat rice 
or breakfast everything rice I don't know if  
they have other ingredients but uh let's 
just say so we know like top sealog Etc  
hello hello oh coconut Chris I still haven't tried 
this one yet maybe I should come back later and  
try it there are lots of like military um like 
uniform around maybe this is like a police station
um as you can see many chimneys around this 
area are something that it's only if you get  
a BGC then you'll see because cpgc is 
not allowed to have gymnast apparently  
so I think sometimes we go out of local 
areas what we call our BGC we do try to  
take some Local transportation 
like Japanese Etc or tricycles
all right where can we get Filipino 
breakfast let's see let's see
hmm military better not show the camera 
because otherwise I want to get I will  
get we'll get into trouble what's with me 
today my voice not talking very properly okay
oh there's not even a road for me to walk 
just very narrow roads yeah this reminds me  
of uh Java in Indonesia it's something 
like this Fried Chicken mostly selling
bubble tea seasick what else
people um I heard I'm in oh
whatever it bites me I have to worry you bite me
they are like Street dogs everywhere 
yeah sometimes when I see the street  
dogs and then you know compare with the 
ones in BGC they look very luxury and  
they even have clothes sometimes I see these 
doggies I feel so bad yeah hard with animals
I like these ones I want to get 
one of these and drive in a BGC  
yeah save some time walking around for 
example when you go from our place to  
market market usually it's around 15 20 
minutes walk with this for five minutes
right there maybe go to like 
a karundari or something to  
grab some Filipino breakfast I said a 
random Chicken on the street so strange
what else
they're like small shops like this
let's see what else is in this area
I just know the traffic here can get 
pretty chaotic because there's so many  
people in there this kind of buses 
as well Taki transportation service  
I haven't seen any food so far but that's a 
cosmetic it's like a looks like a mini Pharmacy  
Etc everything grocery oh this looks very 
modern actually let's go and have a look  
looks like something like a 7-Eleven but 
uh looks quite important in a local area
the squeaking sound what have they got here 
they've got tiramisu wow this looks good  
tasty what else they've got some really 
interesting products here that I really  
didn't expect to find in local area um 
they've got small package of Cocoa Crunch  
normally Helena and I will get the 1kg one 
like the Costco comes with two buck big boxes  
I've got fluffy pancakes this is so delicious 
guys this is like a has like a sweet version in  
it I think it's sweeter than normal pancake but 
it's more fluffy and Lena and I love this as well  
hmm yeah I think other than that it 
just looks like a pretty standard uh  
shopping grocery shopping market yeah other than 
that it's more or less similar I guess but uh  
yeah this looks really modern in this local area 
compared to everything that this really stands out  
honestly this kind of reminds me of my days of 
backpacking when I had to carry like 20 kilograms  
of backpack just walking around the local streets 
in Thailand uh usually Bangkok I will carry a  
massive big backpack and just walk around shopping 
malls people think I'm a weirdo in Korea people  
think I was like I don't know some idiots are 
homeless maybe in Korea because I was compared  
to Koreans they are usually very well dressed 
they are they have like um even in summer they  
wear long sleeves I don't understand but usually 
Koreans they look very tidy look very clean that's  
why when I go I was wearing a bandana I was 
the only person in the on the streets wearing  
a colorful t-shirt so uh it was quite interesting 
people think because usually in Korea they always  
wear black and white so that's the first time when 
it came to Korea I wasn't too used to it because I  
was the only person wearing green t-shirt on the 
streets when can we find food there is no food  
Filipino food Filipino breakfast
maybe I should ask some Locos ask some 
locals where I can get breakfast they
okay yeah I want to find like a Korean 
Dairy kind of thing I don't want to just  
get a street food today because 
oh there's a water station yeah
so this is how water station works is how they 
fill up the water and are sent to our home
just out of curiosity we came in this area and we 
saw this bike shop so I'm just really interested  
and uh curious to find out how much exactly 
it is to it's like to get a bike or rental  
or something it says 1 000 pesos for one bike 
for 30 months oh I believe it's uh like rental  
then 30 months is 2849 pesos extractor 1 
000 down payments interesting I was just  
thinking from uh for Alina mostly because Alina 
can drive a bike I cannot so I cannot rent some  
of these and I know many of you guys suggest 
that I should get a bike but uh you know it's  
quite dangerous to drive a motorbike in Manila 
especially if you don't know how to ride one
this looks like a proper place let's 
see let's see what they have here  
hello hello good morning hello good morning
what uh what do you have for breakfast sorry 
uh what do you what do you have for breakfast
okay
foreign
so this is a traditional Filipino 
breakfast yes okay I will try it  
it's my first time having a Filipino breakfast 
that's why so the difference all right maybe we'll  
sit here all right let's have a look at the menu 
oh is that is that Russian that looks like Russian
because uh Alina if you see it here 
then she'll understand this I think  
oh Batangas I know that word goto 
Batangas what's uh what's Goto patangas
we are big cows beef and cow oh mix oh it's like 
a mince means no it's like a fruit oh interesting  
there are many like different evenings uh 
oh so it's like mix of organs uh internal  
organs oh it reminds me of that Korean Dairy 
experience that we had uh not long or with cello  
and Allen saucing and you've got many sealocks 
here so last time I think Jello explained to  
us that sea or like a lot of people which 
ones maybe it's c is rice or C is egg one  
it's egg one is rice sea lot and then 
you mix the other ingredients like hot  
sealer concealer maling sea lock I don't 
know what Marling is so that's gonna be  
quite interesting to ask about it later a long 
sealog the Longines I know fancy look bangers
yeah it's really loud here
so uh let's wait for the meal 
and see how it tastes like  
um I think it's a sea lock maybe there's 
rice later but we're getting sizzling  
um time to try it it's a hot day today super 
hot day yeah and uh the one in the Philippines  
everyone loves going to the malls sorry Liam 
PO is pork belly is it liempo it's pork belly  
haha Liam Liam Paul it's a pork belly liempo 
pork okay I'm interested to try it sizzling
and uh they've got lots of uh condiments 
yeah some chili flakes Calamar C I think  
and I don't know what that one is some sort 
of nuts Etc and maybe hot sauce I don't know  
Papa Papa oh beef and so it's 
like corn dog con concealock I see  
is that also like corned beef ah okay okay so 
this is a sizzling lempo signature dish the best  
okay all right why are there Russian words 
there Russian word puck [ __ ] pop boys
the owner the owner of course it's

uh mashed potatoes oh mix mix that's yum yum so  
you're really good at cooking Filipino dishes 
working as a chef like for almost 20 years 20  
years and been working in a cruise ship also ah 
right I've been in Dubai before and I've been away  
I've been in Bahrain wow you've been traveling

InterContinental Western wow that's awesome  
Italian 2016. that's awesome wow yo um your 
family your family is very lucky yes this  
is my wife yes your wife is very lucky 
you can cook everything that's awesome  
you can teach me how to cook some 
Filipino food maybe yes if you want  
I actually learned how to make a sinigang 
I learned the other day but use powder in  
it exactly yeah oh all right that's a sizzling 
that's uh that kind of changing is uh sour yep  
uh Tamarind yes Tamarind yeah yeah so just a 
little bit different to Tom Yum because of the  
coconut yes the coconut yeah and a little bit 
spicy ah like we talked about food here whoa
that's awesome oh one more one more 
so you can enjoy your gravy that's  
awesome I love my rice with a lot of 
sauce yes yeah is that like Filipino  
breakfast usually it's rice yes 
that's awesome okay let's head out
your husband can cook many things all right 
let's see I'm gonna maybe sit here okay  
we'll stay here then let's see if it's delicious  
is it Masada yes okay I trust you from Justin I 
am from Hong Kong James I am from Hong Kong yeah
so uh James has been to uh many Middle 
East countries thank you yes so in  
Philippines culture you don't use knife 
I only use spoon and pork like uh right
always
So Soft you don't need to use knife yes okay 
let's try it all right thank you thank you  
thank you thank you all right so today is my 
cheat day usually Alina doesn't let me drink  
Coca-Cola at all any soft drinks but today I'm 
gonna cheat because she's not here but anyway  
let's get some natural lighting and let's try 
this um seasick here this kind of reminds me of  
the fast food in uh in Hong Kong Restaurant like 
fast food because usually in Hong Kong they have  
rice as well but this is more like a lunch 
usually with lots of gravy issues like maybe  
garlic sauce or black pepper sauce and we've got 
the lamb board here the main dish in Hong Kong  
is maybe like chicken drumstick but not right 
it's just a grill and also maybe like ins like  
fast food kind of Curry usually but I like 
food rice with uh gravy a lot of cream right
yeah okay it's quite soft
and what it is about the sauce actually 
the sauce determines everything
masala very massage
the sauce is very nice Italian boys
basically I can finish all the rice if there's 
enough sauce and the sauce here is amazing it  
tastes a bit like um I don't know if you actually 
add butter in it but it is a bit like butter
pepper and something else
thank you oh do I need to 
add like kalamasi yes okay  
so I just get one like this yes and 
then I squeeze it in like something okay
teach me how to eat properly 
so like this you should yeah
take two hands and then
okay take two hands yes okay
and this one those are fried garlic this one is a  
pillow Blitz I'm okay with the chili 
but a garlic can all right let's see
yeah the sauce is really delicious thank you 
taste butter there's butter in it yes yep
unsalted right let's see all right 
I think I'm mixing with the fried  
garlic is gonna be even more delicious that's it
makes everything more tasty you know
it smells good already
oh yeah
it's amazing
especially seeing how they cook it 
makes it even more tasty you know  
when you see the whole process of making 
it usually you make sure you want to die
why is the Philippines so famous 
for the emperor like not avocado
like why in the Philippines Liam boy is so famous 
because we can use that flavorful like foreign
yeah okay all right I think uh adding the garlic 
for a garlic in a color Master really elevates how  
old is especially um with the butter the calamari 
brings out sourness in it and it really like pops  
make it pop oh and as you can see our GoPro 
it's in the ice bath right now but it's just  
overheated so I'm just going to chew it down 
a bit so uh James got us some extra gravy here  
it's gonna pour it right in oh yeah it's not 
sizzling anymore but still that will be good  
enough for us to finish the rice all right it's 
a very delicious meal so I finished everything  
on a plate now well of sauce luckily we've 
got the sauce and now all thanks to the chef
