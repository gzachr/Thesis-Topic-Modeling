Hey Xiaoma!
It seems like the strangers in New York City
Really enjoyed the halo halo, eating it for the first time
And I was like, yeah duh, it was great
So they were like, okay
Well how's about we make you some taho
And you bring it to them to try
And I was like, "Taho? I've actually..."
You know what, I've never had that before
So
They made us some, guys!
And...
I am so excited to try this today
Because I've actually never had taho before
It's really kind of rare in New York City
Oh my god
This looks so beautiful
Okay
Wow, it's nice and warm
Now that is nice!
Wow, it's really silky
Oh my god, this is good guys!
So they made us a bunch of tahos, little mini tahos

So what is it?
So it's tofu
So it's tofu
A little bit of caramel sugar

Sago pearls as well, like tapioca
Okay! So this is mine, right?

...sweetness?
Yeah
Well...
Are you ready?
Cheers!
Ready? Bon app√©tit!
Oh lord!
Eat it!
I'm getting...Cream of Wheat vibes! [American hot breakfast cereal]
It tastes like Cream of Wheat, oatmeal
What's the texture, though?
I don't like the texture!!!
Hamilton!
Come try this!
I'm sorry though, because the culture...
Like I'm here for the culture, but it's...
My tastebuds are not...
It does taste like Cream of Wheat!
Cream of Wheat
A little bit, yeah
It's not bad but
It's not my forte...
It's not a prank...?
It's not a prank
Is it gonna make me sick?
It is not gonna make you sick
Is it like ice cream?
It's warm
What's in it?
Tofu, sago pearl
Okay, well I'm gonna tell you right now, I am a texture person
Already, this is not the texture I enjoy
I don't like...gelatinous things
And this seems rather gelatinous
It's a little sweet...
Just do it!
It's not bad!
Cool, there we go!
Not bad!
"Not bad"!
Not bad!
It's better than it looks?
It's fine! Yeah I like it, thanks!
It kinda just tastes like oatmeal or something
Somebody actually said that today 
Oatmeal
Yeah, this is
Yep
Girl: It's okay, it's not as bad as you think it is!
Guy: Looks strange!
Yeah
It's actually not bad!
Really?
No! You want to try?
Man I'm not big on tapioca
But you are big on tofu
I am big on tofu
He does like tofu
Okay
Very skeptical at the beginning
Yeah, it's like sweet tofu
Thank you!
Cool, have a good one guys!
Do you want this back?
No, it's yours!
I'm taking it back!
So it's basically like a tofu based...
It's warm!
Sweet, it's a little warm, yeah
Is it like flan?
Actually people have been saying it tastes like flan, today
This is interesting!
The balls dripped out!
Have you seen anything like that before?
No, I can't say I have!
This is interesting
Tastes like oatmeal
Oh you know what? I guess a little bit
Kinda like oatmeal with cinnamon in it
No, I don't want to!
Have you ever seen anything like that before?
No, never!
I mean...it's okay, it tastes like tofu though!
Want to try? It's like sweet tofu!
It's okay though, I like it!
Have you ever had any flavors like that before? Like other desserts?
No, not really, no!
It's not poison?
It's nothing weird, it's not poison
This is a dessert?
Yeah, sort of like a snack
How do you like it?
It's not bad!
Yeah, there we go!
I like the texture
It's weird, but...
It's okay
Why is it weird?
It's more like a texture thing
This...tofu...sweetness...
Is not a thing in America
And people are just like
Really...I felt like today, were...
Very weirded out by the...
The texture...
You know, it's not really a thing in America, this type of food
But you know?
People tried it, and they actually were surprised by the flavor
So that was really cool
But then yeah, you give it to Chinese people, they're like...
"Oh, we've seen this before!"
But it was cool that they liked it as well
See you next time!
Bye bye!
