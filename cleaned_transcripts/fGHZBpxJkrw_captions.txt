Good 
morning my loves
We don't have electricity today.
So, what we did is we saved some hot water in our flask
Brown out as what we called in the Philippines or black out
I don't know when the electricity is back
What they said is for whole day
but we do not know
when it will be back
or what time
the electricity back
Look!
They are wrapping the bales
I'm in the car as we going  to tesco
because John
He will buy something! It's heavy duty glue
for the jukebox
and
we have problem in our carhahaha
We have a problem in our car
Because the left rear tyre is soft
John is finding solution
We forget something
the letter that we have to post
We forgot about it
we have to go back
because it's important letter
John:You needed some money for that.
Mia: This is from you(it's his letter)!
John: Look the face on her.
John: Come on passenger you should be ready now.
Mia: SEE! This is what I get!
Mia: He bully's me.
John: Bully?
John: We're running late.
Mia: He bully's me.
This is it we finally going to tesco

I don't think I will be vlogging because it so busy
And look! my husband is knocking
I can't believe how busy the tesco is

We also  bought a little shopping bag
It's super cute!
I will show you later
We are here in post office to send a letters
After post office will go home
It's so annoying because I cannot do my editing and we don't have a wifi
and my cellphone is almost dead
I don't know!
Look at our dog
They are very happy when we are home
I will show you what we bought in Tesco
First
We bought foil
This is just a top op groceries
So, we paid Â£22.30
I don't know how much that in peso
Let's do some calculation
Let say for example the exchange rate pound to peso is 70
Oh my god! its about php1500
Its expensive
We did not bought a lot
Look, our strawberries!
We did harvest some!
It's twice already we harvested them
And they are so sweet!
Afterwards, we will put add some icecream
they are small but sweet
by the way we already have our lunch
John requested to have some strawberries and icecream
I am preparing Sir John's dessert
My arms is so big, I am really getting fat.
John will have strawberry
because I  have my jelly
And we still have no electricity my loves
This is my jelly I add raspberry to it.
This is what we do!
I'm having jelly.I add fruit. and afterwards ice cream
I don't know why I love jelly
my happiness is so shallow
Delicious!
