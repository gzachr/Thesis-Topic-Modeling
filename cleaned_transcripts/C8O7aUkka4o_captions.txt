You already know from my previous video,
that I like living in Russia
If you haven't watched it yet
make sure to check it out
And in this video, as I promised,
I will tell you what I do not like in Russia
Let's go!
Hello everyone
My name is Mary Jane, I come from the Philippines,
but in the last year, I have been living in Russia
When I first came to Russia
I went to Moscow
and of course I was pleasantly surprised
I liked everything there:
apartments, sidewalks, parks
public transport!
But then I left Moscow and realized
that it's not all like that around Russia
Traffic jams
Traffic jams, of course, exist all over the world.
But I think that in Moscow
it's one of the biggest drawback
It’s probably striking
because the rest of Moscow is very cool
Although I’m not sure that traffic jams in Moscow are worse
than in Manila - the capital of the Philippines
We have big problems with this too
Roads
In the comments section of my videos
people asked
why am I saving up for a tank
This is a joke from the video
where I balanced wheels
We drove by car
and when I noticed a very bad road
I said
damn, I need to buy a tank
This is Russia!
Of course I don’t like such roads
Of course, this is not everywhere
But there are roads in our city
that are really bad
and significantly different from Moscow
Aggressive driving style
At first I thought it was just my friend,
and then I took a taxi
And I noticed that the taxi driver
drives about the same:
Often switches lanes,
speeds up and slows down
Surely not all drivers in Russia are like this
but almost everyone with whom I went with are like that
I was shocked
and I was afraid for my life
Maybe this is because in the Philippines
my dad always drives very carefully
Unpredictability of the weather
In my last video I said
I like the weather in Russia
But
what I don't like about it
is it's unpredictability
and fickleness!
When I look out in the window
it seems to me that the weather is great
but when I go outside
it usually turns out
that...
I wore the wrong clothes
I don't understand anything
It's so hard to understand
what clothes should I wear
so I won't get sick
This is because I did not grow here
and I have little experience
In the Philippines, the weather is always hot
therefore it's easier to choose what clothes to wear
White Nights
This has been my recent problem
My body clock is ruined
due to the fact that it gets dark very late (around 9pm)
And I don’t feel it is already late evening
So I often go to bed around midnight
And the sunrise, on the contrary, is so early
that I wake up too early
Around three or four in the morning
Fortunately, I recently ordered
a mask like this for myself
And now I sleep much better
I actually ordered 4
as a gift to friends and family
So if you want to
sleep well
Or you're looking for a gift for your loved ones
I will leave the link in the description below
Big mosquitoes
I was very surprised when
I first saw mosquitoes here
For example, the one I saw the other day
Oh my gosh, so big!
This is the biggest mosquito
that I've seen in my whole life!
In this video, I have mentioned that
many things in Russia are bigger than in Asia
but I didn’t think that mosquitoes too
Ok fine, it's not so bad
that they are big
they are actually easier to see
and one more, they are noisy
In Asia, you don't hear them at all
And in Russia they can fly in another
end of room
but you can hear them like they are flying
over your ear!
Mosquitoes always bite me
that's why I do not like them
Who the heck loves these mosquitos?! No one!
Ah, frogs love them!
Bureaucracy
When I first experienced
filing documents in Russia,
it turned out to be quite a pain in the a**
I was given a list of the necessary documents,
I submitted them, but it turned out
I need more documents
which were not on the list
what the hell?
And what makes it more complicated is
that I understand Russian quite poorly
therefore the submission of any documents
usually gives me anxiety
Of course I know that bureaucracy
is a problem all over the world
and Russia is not unique in this
In the Philippines, for example,
bureaucracy is also quite common
But I just wanted to share my experience
and talk about what I don't like
Russia, that's all
Storm-water system is missing?
I recently saw posts where
it showed floods in Russia
I thought it was fake
And then my friend said that floods
really happen in Russia
And that storm water drainage systems
are missing almost everywhere
And even such a developed city as Moscow
can easily be flooded
I was surprised!
I did not understand how this is possible
In Southeast Asia
floods happen often
Therefore the storm water drainage system
improves from year to year
For example, in Thailand, all roads
are built right after storms
Of course, it doesn't happen immediately
especially in Phuket where they build,
for some reason, tunnels instead of overpasses
But unlike Russia, at least they have it
In the Philippines, floods still occur
in some parts of the country,
but the government is working
to improve the situation
In general, I did not expect that in a
developed country like Russia
that floods are possible
That's why I was surprised
"why don't you have this?"
If you know the answer write in the comments!
Some food are not available here
Of course, food in Russia is
not like in Southeast Asia
There are products and dishes that we have
that are completely ordinary and cheap
and here it’s hard to find
I began to think which of those
food I miss
And it turned out that there are many of them not available here
Judging by the comments of the Russians
for some reason they think that we in Asia
eat insects and cockroaches
This is not the case, we have a lot
wonderful and delicious dishes
You’ve never heard of many of them,
What a mistake, they're definitely worth trying
And cockroaches and insects
It's more like exotic food for tourists rather than for locals
In general, I will definitely make a video about
what food is worth trying in Asia
So subscribe so you won't miss that!
I wonder, what is it that you don't like
in Russia and what do you think
can be done about it?
I will be waiting for your comments
Salamat po! (Thank you!)
