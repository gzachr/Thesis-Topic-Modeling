Hello from Baguio,
the Philippines coldest city.
And I am,
believe it or not, I'm in the mall right now.
SM City Baguio Mall.
This is actually the sky terrace that they've got on their rooftop,
where people can just chill out
and admire the view
of Baguio.
Check this city out.
So,
the number 1 reason that I'm here, in this city,
is the weather, and it's fantastic, guys.
It's like 24 degrees C,
a nice cool breeze.
This is about as good as it gets in the Philippines,
as far as weather goes.
I've only been in Manila so far,
and I just hated it, being outdoors.
The weather's so hot, so humid,
so uncomfortable.
But this is,
this is amazing.
It's like 1:30 in the afternoon
and it's like
a perfect summer day in Scotland.
So it is.
So check this city out.
This is a university down there.
The University of Cordilleras.
That is my hotel over there.
In fact, I can see my exact balcony,
right there, the Orchard Hotel.
That's where, I just walked to the mall
past the park where I was in the previous vlog.
I did a
nice little pontoon
loop around that lake, there.
And, yeah, this is the rest of Baguio.
I don't know what there is to really do in this city.
I've had a look online,
"Things to do in Baguio."
There doesn't really seem to be much.
Like I said, the number 1,
well, the only reason I'm here is for the weather.
I was actually planning on coming to Manila
and then going down south to some islands or whatever
and then
the weather got me so bad in Manila that I was like,
"Where's the coldest place?"
Google it, "Where's the coldest place in the Philippines?"
Baguio! That's where everybody goes when they want some cool weather.
It gets down, under 20 degrees at night.
It's fantastic, guys.
Anyway, yeah, this is the mall,
right here.
Amazing, isn't it, that the mall has this
kinda "Sky Terrace" and people just kinda
hanging out here, mostly in the shade.
There.
There's some kinda,
I dunno if it's a bouncy castle
or something like that.
But,
I'm gonna explore the mall a wee bit
and maybe find myself a nice
matcha...
Oh, there's a cafe right there.
Like a Matcha Frappuccino,
or a Taiwanese bubble tea,
or something like that, guys.
And as you can see, the whole mall is open air.
There's no air conditioning and it doesn't need it, either.
It's just this open air
and
they just let the wind,
the breeze, flow through and it feels good.
They've got some ceiling fans on the lower levels as well.
But no AC.
Probably the only, kinda, fancy mall
like this, that I've been to, that doesn't have AC.
And another big terrace, here, on this side.
But nobody hanging out,
apart from one dude.
Because,
yeah, there's no view on this side, so
it's that side over there for the view.
But, we do get a view of the beautiful
Philippines flag
and,
yeah, people getting dropped off in buses,
in taxis and such.
People who don't want to walk up the big hill.
You have to walk up a big hill to get here.
In fact, you have to walk up a big hill...
Either you're walking up or down a hill,
wherever you go in this city, guys.
But,
you would rather that, than be in Manila
where it's all flat, but the weather's hot.
Here,
you're walking around, it's all hilly, but
the weather's nice and cool, so it feels good, guys.
Give your legs a bit of exercise.
Hello. Can I take a picture?
- Hi.
I know you.
- Oh, okay, sure.
Oh, really? Ah, okay.
- Oh, yeah.
What's my name?
Ummm....
- You don't know? I know, you don't know.
I don't remember.
- Luke Damant.
Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.
Let's take a picture.
Okay, nice to see you.
Okay, cheers.
So they've got a Starbucks, right here, guys.
Look at all these guys with their laptops,
just sitting, using it as their personal office.
I would hate that. Hey!
I would hate that. Somebody just doing their homework, right there.
Yeah.
There's a big queue.
I will...
I was thinking about getting a Matcha Frappuchino
in there, but a big queue.
Yeah, I would hate to have a business,
where people just come and use it as their
personal office.
Use your WiFi, your electricity,
buy like one coffee.
So, I don't understand why they let people do that.
And I don't understand why people want to do that,
either.
I knew a guy who lived in Chiang Mai,
and every day he would take his laptop to a different coffee shop and
hang out and think he was cool.
"Digital Nomad."
Digital gonad,
that's what he is, a digital gonad,
sitting in a coffee shop.
Just sit in your house.
Just sit in your condo, just sit in your hotel room
and do your work.
Why do you need to be sitting in somebody's coffee shop,
to do your work,
with people disturbing you and
look, all these people coming in and out.
I don't understand it, guys.
I don't understand this whole concept.
I don't even like coffee.
I only ever go to Starbucks for the matcha
frappuccino.
But,
yeah, the whole concept of this coffee shop culture,
I don't understand it, guys.
I do not understand it at all.
Ah, this is nice. The cool breeze.
The cool breeze that's running through
this mall is fantastic, guys.
Now, I'm looking for a bubble tea.
That's what I'm actually in the mood for.
And I see over there,
they've got Tiger Sugar.
I've had that before in Bangkok, Thailand.
That's really good, actually.
It's a Taiwanese bubble tea,
Excuse me.
- Hi.
Do you blog on TikTok?
Blog on TikTok? Yeah, sometimes.
- You?
Yeah.
I don't like TikTok that much, but...
Thank you.
- Okay, no worries, yeah.
The only reason I put my content on TikTok is,
if I don't do it myself,
then somebody else just re-uploads my stuff there.
But, yeah, TikTok's basically a waste of time
for your man.
- Hello.
Hi, how are you?
You're getting boba tea?
What is this one?
Which one is it?
It's a latte?
Black milk tea with milk.
I think that's the one she's got.
I think I'm gonna get that one, there.
They've got their top 12 best sellers,
and they've got one with Milo.
Milo Boba Milk With Cream.
I think I'm gonna get that.
Hi, how are you?
Can I get a picture with you?
- Oh, yeah, sure.
How are you guys?
You from Baguio or you tourist?
I'm a tourist.
Tourist, from where?
From Pangasinan.
Ah, okay, Pangasinan.
Yes.
Is that in Luzon?
Yes.
- Yeah, okay.
Northern Luzon.
Northern Luzon? Ah, okay.
Okay, we getting a selfie?
Okay.
He's too small.
Can you?
- You want me to do it? Okay.
Okay, good?
Okay, I think I got us all in.
- Thank you, sir.
Okay, no worries.
Take care.
I'm gonna get...
- Can I get a picture too?
Oh, yeah, sure.
I always watch your blog.
- Okay.
Really, uh?
- Yeah.
You from Baguio?
No, I'm from Pangasinan.
Everybody's from Pangasinan.
Thank you.
- So Pangasinan people, they come to Baguio a lot?
For the weekend, or?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, because today's Saturday.
So you come for weekend? Ah.
I like your blog.
Okay, nice to see you.
- Nice to meet you.
Yeah.
- See you, guys, see you.
Okay.
Gonna get my
boba tea.
Hi.
Why don't you have a bubble tea?
Your friends have one and you don't have.
Not thirsty?
She don't have one.
- I'm ordering.
Ah, you're ordering for both of you? Ah, okay.
- Yeah.
Hi, I want the Milo one.
160,
so that's about $3 USD.
Thank you.
Okay, so,
when I was in Manila,
I was getting my Taiwanese boba tea from Coco.
It's an international brand,
well it's a Taiwanese brand that you get in a lot of countries.
And they were giving me paper straws, and they were awful.
I couldn't even finish a third of the drink
before the straw was going all soggy.
So I hope here,
in Tiger Sugar,
that they have
proper plastic straws.
You need a proper plastic straw,
especially when you're sucking up the bobas.
The paper ones are useless. So,
yeah, hopefully
hopefully there's no law or something that's forcing them to use the paper straws.
Hopefully this brand
has the plastic ones,
but we'll see.
That's what I'm hoping for.
If they don't have plastic,
if they don't have plastic straws,
I won't be drinking it again.
It's just,
it's just not a good experience.
I'm all one for not wasting plastic and stuff.
When they give me plastic bags in markets and stuff,
I usually say "No, just put it in my backpack."
No point wasting the plastic, but
it's not a waste when
it's for your boba tea.
You need it, it's essential.
Essential.
It's my one?
Ah, okay, no bag.
Somehow I got my one before you.
You ordered before me.
- Why?
I don't know.
This the Milo one, yeah?
Yeah, I got VIP treatment.
She's not happy.
Okay.
I'm gonna.
- I am joking.
Ah, joking? Ah, okay.
I'm gonna stab this.
It is a plastic straw, guys.
It's a plastic straw and yer man's happy.
I'm gonna take this up to the Sky Terrace
and enjoy it there, guys.
And check this out, guys.
Look at that.
Does that look delicious or what?
The boba pearls at the bottom.
We've got the caramel
all along the sides
and it's like a
cream mousse that's inside it.
And the Milo powder as well.
This is gonna be fantastic.
Nice and cold as well.
Ohoho.
Shake it up a bit.
Okay, back onto
the Sky Terrace, here.
Let's see if I can
pop this straw in without making a mess.
Sometimes I do make a mess,
so, let's give it a...
Really, you want a flat surface,
to put it on.
I don't have a flat surface.
Okay.
And you don't want to be delicate, guys.
Just one hard pop.
One hard push, like this.
There you go.
That's it. See, I didn't spill it at all.
Fantastic.
Nice and cold.
Oh, that creamy,
that creamy, cream mousse.
Mmm.
Oh, wow.
Oh, it's so sweet.
Normally when I get these boba teas,
I ask them for, like,
50% sweetness.
I don't think they had the choice there.
I dunno if they had the choice but I got a full...
Wow!
That is so sweet.
And so...
I just got a leaf. I just got...
A gust of wind just blew a leaf in my mouth.
So creamy. The cream is really thick.
It's like full fat, double fat cream, you know.
Mmm.
It's like a,
it's like a brown sugar taste to it as well.
Mmm.
I'm not really tasting the Milo, though.
That's the thing.
I think what they've done is, right here,
they've put the Milo powder on top.
So I need to, like...
I should have shaken it up a bit more.
I only shook it up a little bit, but,
I gotta get the straw into the top to get the Milo.
The Milo taste.
I see there.
There's little bits of the Milo.
Little bits of the Milo, guys.
Mmmmmm.
That's it.
That's the Milo right there.
Oh, lovely.
It is very powdery.
It still needs...
You really need to mix this up to get the
the Milo mixed in.
Everybody here just chillin',
enjoying the weather.
Look at this.
Happy, happy people.
Everybody tourists.
Haven't spoken to one person yet,
since I got here,
who lives in Baguio.
I've been out and about on the streets and stuff.
Many people come up,
the viewers from the channel,
and
I always ask them "Are you from Baguio?"
"No, I'm from..."
Somewhere else. Somewhere else in Luzon.
Today's the weekend, so it's like,
easy for other people on this island, Luzon,
to just, like, drive over a few hours.
Maybe stay in a hotel for one night or something,
and have it as, like, a wee,
like a weekend break,
a weekend break spot.
Enjoy the cool mountain air.
Lovely.
Ahhhh!
I've wasted most of the...
I've drank it all and there's still loads of bobas left.
Hate that.
Anyway.
I would rate this highly, guys.
I would rate this,
I dunno, 9 out of 10,
or something.
A 9 out of 10 boba tea.
Not a sponsored video, as always.
None of the videos are sponsored.
But,
yeah, definitely one of the better boba teas
that I've had.
And the
plastic straw.
Okay, we'll give them an extra 1 point for the plastic straw.
10, it's a 10 out of 10
boba tea, guys.
I'll definitely be having that,
basically every time I come to this mall,
I'll be having that.
Anyway,
let's get out of here.
Okay, nice to see you guys.
I'm maybe gonna go to this,
there's a fairground or something, right?
I see like a big Ferris Wheel.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, I'm gonna maybe try that.
Yeah, it's a big Ferris Wheel.
Hey.
Nice to see you.
- Can I take a picture?
Ah, okay.
I love your blogs.
- Really, uh?
Yeah.
- You from Baguio?
????
Ah, okay.
- I'm from ????
Okay.
A video.
Heyo.
Oh, it's a video?
- Yeah.
Hey, guys, from Baguio.
We're just chillin', drinking some boba tea.
It's good. Nice, fresh air here in this city, right?
It's all good.
Follow her.
Okay.
- Him.
Follow her? Uh!
Too progressive!
Got the pronouns wrong.
It's definitely a "him," guys.
Definitely the other gender.
Okay.
Thank you.
- Okay. Okay.
- Can we have selfie with you?
Okay, nice to see you, guys.
- Thank you.
See you.
I'm your fan.
- Okay.
Okay, guys.
So, yeah, there's some kinda fairground.
When I look out from my balcony to this mall,
I see there's, like, a big Ferris Wheel.
So,
I googled it,
and it's in some kinda fairground.
The rides look really boring.
It's really like, there's no thrill...
It's not like Disneyland or anything like that.
But I do like a good Ferris Wheel.
You get a good view and all that, eh? So,
I'm maybe gonna see if I can
make my way into that
amusement park, just for the Ferris Wheel, guys.
There's a big queue for taxis here.
But, luckily this
ammusement park is only 3 minutes walk away,
according to Google Maps.
So,
taxi not required.
Strong legs in action.
Let's go for it.
Ah, here it is, here.
The big pirate boat, swinging.
This is the Sky Ranch
amusement park.
That's what it's called, Sky Ranch.
So,
looks like that's the ticket booth, right there.
Hopefully I don't need to pay for
like a full day entry pass or something,
just to go on one ride.
Hopefully it's like,
you can pay just to go on each ride or something, because
yeah, I'm only here for...
Well, actually, I might go on that. That looks like fun.
I'm only here for the Ferris ride,
the Ferris Wheel, but I might go on this pirate ship.
Looks fun.
Ah, I see there, it says
50 for admission, or 80, probably for adults.
Okay, thank you.
????
- Okay.
Get the admission ticket,
which is... Ah, it's for weekends.
So today is a Saturday, you have to pay 80.
Okay, one ticket please.
Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.
Okay, so,
looks like I've got a QR code
or something, and then hopefully
you can just buy one ride, for one ticket,
or something like that.
That's my QR code.
I get a stamp?
Stamp, sir.
Okay, Sky Ranch Baguio.
Let's go.
And yeah, this is the Ferris Wheel that I see from my balcony,
every day when I look out.
Baguio Eye, it's called.
Like the London Eye, but a bit smaller.
And then I'm probably gonna do this Super Viking.
That will be the boat, there.
And then, I think everything else for little kids.
There's only 2 for big kids, I think.
Okay.
That's what I'm gonna do.
It's not so expensive either.
So that's like,
that's like $1.80
and that's like $2.70.
So it's not too bad at all.
Hi.
One ticket for Baguio Eye,
and one for Super Viking.
Okay, thank you.
Can you take a picture with my son?
Thank you.
- Okay, no worries.
Hi, how are you?
- Picture?
Ah, okay.
- Hi, sir.
You have the duck fishing?
- Yeah.
Fishing for rubber duckies.
Asian style. Peace.
- Yeah.
Okay.
Okay, nice to see you.
Nice to see you.
- Okay.
Where do I go to get on this?
Baguio Eye?
- This one, eh, this way.
This way? Okay.
Hi, sir.
I think I can get straight on it. Thank you.
Thank you, sir.
- I think I can get straight on it, guys.
There's...
Doesn't look like there's anybody on it
and doesn't look like there's any queue.
Oh, check this out, they have air conditioning.
They have AC units inside the
cabins. That's good.
That's really good.
I remember I took the cable car in Pokhara,
Nepal,
and I was like "This would be perfect if it had AC."
It was a bit too sweaty and stuff.
Hi.
Why so scared?
It was good?
Good? Yeah? Okay.
Here's my ticket.
Thank you.
And I think it just continuously goes at this speed.
It never stops.
It never slows down, it never speeds up.
It just stays at this speed,
guys, and you get like a full loop
to enjoy the view.
So it's not any thrill ride or anything like that.
Yeah, I think we've got to jump into it quick,
because it doesn't stop, right?
I just jump in? Yeah, okay.
Just jump in.
Oh, my own personal,
my own personal
cabin, right here, with air conditioning.
And you can adjust the temperature as well.
Okay, nice.
Nice, refreshing
Ferris Wheel ride.
Okay.
I think it's gonna take a while.
It's going,
like, so slowly.
It's gonna take a while.
I'll see you guys when we get to the top.
And here we are, guys.
We are at the top.
So this is as good a view
as we're going to get.
And how is the view?
Well, as you can see,
the visibility isn't great.
We always,
in Baguio,
seem to be
in a cloud.
I don't know if it's haze.
It's definitely not pollution,
like you get in Manila.
It's...
The air is very clean
and fresh here,
but it always seems to be this kinda misty,
fogginess
that you have here.
And I've never seen clearly,
like the top of that hill or anything like that.
So,
yeah, you're up high though.
What do you expect?
You're up in the mountains.
But,
yeah,
this Ferris Wheel,
probably not worth it, probably not worth it.
There's no thrill to it.
It's not going fast.
It's going very slowly and
yeah, the view's just the same as you're getting
from, like, the Sky Terrace on the mall.
That's the mall, right there.
Yeah, the view's just the same as you're getting from the Sky Terrace on the mall.
I dunno.
It might be nice and romantic
if you bring your wee girlfriend here
and you know, you're alone.
Nice romantic setting
on the Ferris Wheel, but
yer man on his Todd Sloan (own)
right here.
Okay, I'm gonna finish this
ride off, and then
that's what's next, guys.
Okay.
Time to get out.
- Thank you.
Okay.
Fantastic.
And they've got one of these 'Dare to Drop' things.
The drop tower. But it's a baby version.
I've done ones that are like
10 times the size of that,
in
Mumbai at the Imagicaa
and the one in Jakarta at the Dufan.
Right, I'm gonna put my camera in my pocket,
because I don't think they're gonna let me take this on
the ride, so I guess I'll just
you know,
hide it,
and then
bring it out once the ride's started.
Let's try that.
Yeah, I think they're fine with the camera.
People taking their phones and their bags on and stuff,
so, yeah, it's not like...
You know, in Europe, if you're on this,
they won't let you take your phone and your camera and stuff.
Oh, really?
- Too much "Health and Safety."
????
- But... Oh, this.
Oh.
Breathe in.
- Yeah.
Oh, that's good, it's
just at your waist. It's comfortable.
Yes.
- Okay, so we're secure.
And the best seats to get on this ride
are the ones at the very top.
Like here and there.
You get the highest, guys, and here we go.
Waaaaaay!
Okay, it's good.
It's good.
Nice, cool breeze. I'm enjoying it.
Wohoooooo!
What are these rides, here?
That's strange.
It looks like they,
they have to peddle or something to take it round a track.
It's like a,
it's like a self-powered roller coaster.
No power required.
It's a green,
it's a Greta Thunburg approved
roller coaster, right there.
Whoooooooooooa!
Wayhay!
This is good.
This is better than the,
the Ferris Wheel, that was too slow.
You know, the Ferris Wheel, it goes very slow.
Yeah.
- Yeah, this is whooooooa!
Wohoo!
This is good.
It's made for dating, only.
Yeah.
Yeah, for dating. That's what I said,
it's for like taking your girlfriend or something. Yeah.
- Yeah.
For,
for romantic time.
- Yeah.
This is for thrill.
Thrill time. Whooooa!
Whoahohoho!
Yes.
It's good.
Oh, I wish there were,
I wish there were more rides like this in the theme park.
I would,
I would spend an afternoon here,
but it's like,
you can see how small this,
you can see how small this is.
Whooooooa!
You can see how small this area is.
I hope one day they can build this up into being like
something bigger with a huge roller coaster.
It would be good.
Eh, you were riding the horse.
I was riding a horse?
In Pakistan?
- Yeah.
Yeah, you seen that one?
Okay, that was fun.
That was also fun.
This is more fun, though.
Yeah, I was actually trying to go to an amusement park.
I was trying to take a horse ride to a place called Chunky Monkey.
- Yeah.
It was like an amusement park like this,
but I never got to go.
They just took me all around the beach,
and back to the beginning,
to try and get money from me.
Yeah.
So, yeah,
this is the fun I would have been having,
if I actually went to Chunky Monkey, guys.
If I'd went to Chunky Monkey.
I'm at
Sky Ranch,
here in Baguio.
Okay, nice to see you guys.
- Yeah, nice to see you.
See you.
Okay, guys. I'm going
out of here.
So,
from this mall,
theme park area, there's a big hill
that's like the main high street, so
let's take a stroll down there, guys.
So this is the main road here, guys.
I believe it's called Session Road.
But it's basically the high street of
Baguio and
of course, the first
business that you see is a Jollibee.
Just like every high street
in the UK, there would be a McDonalds,
every main street, I guess, in the Philippines has a Jollibee.
I think there's a McDonald's down here as well.
I see a KFC,
actually, so
it's got the lot, but
this is the main
street in town.
It's on a very steep hill.
Like I said,
everywhere you go in Baguio, you're gonna be
up or down a hill.
Keep your legs nice and strong.
And it's all, like,
random stuff for the tourists.
Fast food.
Stuff like that.
Some buskers as well.
And check out the buildings, guys.
Aren't they beautiful?
Look at that. They look very old
classic, but well maintained.
And also well maintained is,
the sidewalk here, the pavement.
Nice and wide.
Obstacle free.
That's what you like, isn't it?
A lot of these cities in South East Asia.
Even in the main cities,
the pavements are a nightmare to walk on.
There's obstacles everywhere.
Bangkok for example.
If you ever tried walking around Bangkok,
it's an absolute nightmare. No, not here.
Nice, big, wide.
It's about as wide
as the actual road,
the pavement.
Pedestrians are obviously
you know,
more respected here than they are in other parts of
this continent.
Lady selling strawberries here.
100 pesos for half a kilo.
They look good.
But, right at the bottom of this road,
is a big public market.
Like a,
a fresh market with fresh fruit and vegetables.
So if I want some strawberries,
that's maybe where I can get some.
And I also might get myself
Like, something touristy
like a Baguio t-shirt or something like that.
It is a,
I think it is a locals market.
They're selling, like,
meat and... Hi, how are you?
- Excuse me.
Can I get a picture with you?
- Yeah, sure.
They're selling, like, meat and
like, fresh vegetables and stuff, but
it's a big touristy town,
so there's probably gonna be, like,
there's probably gonna be, like,
stuff like that.
A nice Baguio t-shirt,
will be nice. Okay.
Okay, good.
Good one.
Okay, nice to see you guys.
- I'm a big fan of yours.
Okay, good.
Okay, see you guys.
Where you going? You going up to the mall?
Oh, yes sir.
- Okay, I've just been.
It was good.
- Ah.
Okay, nice to see you.
Okay, see you guys.
Thank you, sir.
- Okay.
Okay.
Yeah, let's head to,
let's head to the market,
get myself some strawberries and a t-shirt.
At least I've got,
at least I'm not gonna be wandering around the market aimlessly, guys.
I see some of these vloggers,
they go to markets and they don't really know...
They just end up buying random, like, pens,
like pens and just the most random things that you can imagine.
I try to go with a mission, guys.
Just like I had the mission at the Divisoria market in Manila.
I had the mission to find the football
t-shirt.
The Philippines national
football jersey
and it never happened, did it?
But at least I had a mission.
You know, at least I kept it real.
At least I just didn't go around buying random junk.
I actually,
I actually stuck to my mission.
This guys is
lifting
boxes that are about the same size as him.
Okay.
And it's a nice big open square
at the bottom
of the high street that I've just come down.
And I believe...
Oh, that's it there. I see the sign.
Baguio City Market.
So that's the public market in there.
Here we are.
So,
yeah, public market.
Not much for the tourists.
I'm seeing loads of masks.
Maybe they are for the tourists.
I dunno.
For the local tourists who love their masks.
But,
yeah, there's this outdoor bit
and then it looks like there's ways in, to this kinda indoor bit,
right here. So,
mission number one, guys,
strawberries, find the fresh,
the fresh section.
Here it's all
the brush
section. A whole section for
brushes, brooms,
and all that.
That looks good.
An ice cream vendor, right there.
Okay.
It looked like the strawberry ice cream as well.
After I buy my strawberries, I'll buy some strawberry ice cream,
as well.
That will be good.
Ah, I see strawberries there.
I dunno, they,
they're cheaper, they're like half the price
of the ones I seen on the street.
But they don't look as good, they don't look as fresh.
Ah, so there's different prices.
So there are ones that are 150 a kilo.
These are also 150 a kilo.
The just look different.
I think this is like the variant.
Pam...
What is it, Pambyan?
- Pambyahe.
Pambyahe.
Ah, okay, so there's different
like, breeds,
of strawberries.
Okay.
Let's see which ones look the juiciest.
Which ones are the best?
This the best one? Ah.
Can I try one?
Sure.
Okay, I get to try one. Nice.
Thank you.
Gonna give me the best one? Okay.
This is Pambyahe.
Pambyahe.
- Pambyahe strawberry.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, very sweet and very juicy.
Yeah, they're nice.
That's what I want.
So, are they...
You have to buy half a kilo?
So that is like $2.70 for half a kilo.
Are these the packs here or these different ones?
They're not the same.
These ones aren't the same?
So these are not pre-packed?
You have to pack them?
Okay, can you pack me half a kilo, please?
Thank you.
Okay.
You have farm in Baguio for this?
Farm, yeah.
Okay, so they're Baguio strawberries.
Locally grown.
Which ones are your getting?
You're getting those ones?
I get these.
Oh, these? Ah.
I think these are different to the ones I'm getting.
- Yeah.
????
- Oh, you got a lot.
Yes.
The difference is size and the price.
Ah.
Because...
These are cheaper?
It's cheaper.
And they're smaller?
It's a little bit smaller.
- Ah, so...
Oh, yeah, they're the same variant but it's the size.
Same category.
Same variety, yeah.
Ah.
If you're going to look somewhere in Manila,
or some other parts of Baguio,
this one is very good.
Ah, okay.
Local recommends,
this variety.
- Both of them.
Both of them? Okay, good.
- Yeah.
Where are you from?
- I'm from Scotland.
Oh!
- We also have strawberries but only for 2 months or something.
The strawberry in Scotland is?
No, the strawberries are good,
yeah, but only good for, like, July, August, like that.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And the rest of the year we have to get from Spain or Argentina or something.
Yeah.
You know the
strawberry in Thailand is very big, rather than this.
Ah, okay, like,
you say it's like Thailand?
No, although,
this strawberry is locally grown here in mountain province,
but in Thailand, the strawberries is very nice.
It's very big?
Yeah.
- Ah, okay.
Hi. No, no thank you.
Okay, so it's 150, yeah? Oh, wow, it's a lot.
Half a kilo. Thank you. Thank you, so much.
Okay. Hi, how are you?
- Are you the blogger?
Can we take a picture?

Which blogger?
Ah, okay.
Sure.
Okay.

It's gonna be nice to snack on.
For my mini-bar.
Thank you.
- Okay, good.
Nice to see you.
Okay, yeah, so I'm normally eating chocolate and nuts
and protein bars and stuff
for my in-room snacks.
And now I've got some fresh, locally grown strawberries.
I'm happy about that.
Now,
There was a lady selling strawberry ice cream as well.
Hi. Somebody just tapped me on the...
Okay.
They just tapped me on the left and
went past my right. That guy there.
Yeah, there's
somebody selling strawberry ice cream,

Yeah, strawberry only.
What is your other flavour, lemon?

Wow, those strawberries took up half the space in my bag.
So I'm not going to be able to buy much other stuff in this market.

Oh!

Yeah.
Mission complete.
That was a lot easier than
the market mission I was doing in,
- Hey!
in Manila. How are you?
How are you?
- Good.
Nice to see you.
Okay, yeah.
Yeah, I have one more mission, which is to
get myself a local t-shirt.
Something with Baguio written on it,
or like a Philippines flag.
Hi.
- Hello.
It's so funny.
They're like,
waving at me and then
they're so shy, like, a lot of Filipinos.
Like, as soon as...
They wave at me, but then as soon as I turn the camera on them, they're like,
hiding away.
Mmm.
Oh, yeah.
Oh.
The little jelly chunks.
Yum yum.
Okay, I gotta eat this quickly, guys.
It's not hot.
It's only, like, 22 degrees or something right now, but
I gotta...
It's melting so I gotta eat it.
Hi.
- Can we take a selfie?
Okay.
But I'm eating my ice cream. It's gonna melt.
Yes, sir.
Last one, sir.
Okay, Mr Dale.
- Okay.
No worries.
Okay.
Can we take a picture?
- Oh, man.
But, okay,
it's melting though, it's melting.
Yeah.
Thank you.
- Okay, no worries.
Guys, my ice cream is dying.
It's melting. Oh my God.
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay.
You got it, you got it?
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
A video.
I take a video.
- You take a video? Okay.
Hello.
- Hey, guys, from the public market in Baguio.
We're eating strawberry ice cream here.
It's melting a little bit, though.
- Mmm, so yummy.
But nice to see you guys.
Okay, cheers, bye.
Okay.
I'm gonna scoff this as quickly as I can, guys.
Mmmm.
The little chunks, the little chunks. Lovely.
Okay, I managed to consume the ice cream
without wasting any.
Great success.
There's all these,
looks like local sweets,
that they're selling there.
That looks interesting.
Hi, how are you?
What is this?
Look like a Filipino sweet.
Yes.
It's made with milk or cheese or something?
- Cheese.
Oh, it's like a cheese...
Yes, cheese.
And what is the syrup stuff, here?
Looks like
Fruit? Mango or lemon?
- No, sir.
I dunno what it is.
Creamy cassava, sir. Creamy cassava.
Creamy cassava?
Yeah.
- Ah, okay, and cheese on the top?
Yeah.
- That's cheese on the top.
Ah, okay.
Is it...
- You must try this.
Can I buy just one piece? Is it possible?
- Yes.
Oh, okay. How much is one piece?
- 12.
12? Oh, okay, it's good.
Yeah that's good.
Okay, so it's like 10 cents.
Okay, I will buy one piece, please.
- What's the name of your blog?
What's the name of your page, sir?
Dale, Dale Philip.
Dale Philip?
- Yeah.
Okay, that's 12 pesos.
And I get this. What is the name for this sweet?
- Creamy cassava.
- Creamy cassava.
Creamy cassava?
And that's what's in it? It's cassava?
- That's the one
of our best seller.
- Your best seller? Ah, okay.
And you have other stuff. Okay.
If this is good, maybe I will come back and buy more things.
- Okay, sir.
But I'm gonna try it.
Thank you.
Okay, gonna try this,
somewhere,
that I can get some peace.
I don't really know how I can eat this without making a mess.
It's all,
it's all sticky.
I would really like to
I dunno, eat this with a fork or a spoon or something,
but
let's see if we can do it like this, guys.
So, it is a jelly on the bottom and
cheese on the top.
Cheese on a sweet.
Is it gonna be nice?
It's not very sweet. It is very cheesy.
Yeah, it's a very cheesy texture.
A very light cheesy taste.
And then a jelly that's not very sweet, on the bottom.
It's decent enough.
I would say like a,
a 1 or a 2 out of 10 in sweetness.
Maybe even like a 1 or 2 out of 10 in cheesiness.
And then 10 out of 10 in jelliness.
It is all like jelly and squishy.
I like it.
I will snack on these. I will get, maybe,
maybe 4 more
and then some of the other stuff that she's selling.
I think they're all similar stuff,
like this, but maybe
instead of cassava, it's something else,
some other fruit.
Maybe they've got some ube one.
Ube is very popular here.
Mmm.
Yes, sir.
I like it.
It gets the thumbs up.
- You like?
You like?
- Yeah, it's nice. It's not too sweet, right?
Not too sweet.
It's just like a nice
smooth, creamy taste.
I like it.
- Thank you, sir.
And what are the...? Oh, this one looks good.
Is this like...?
- This one, black rice.
Black rice? Yeah.
It looks like a sticky black rice sweet.
Sticky sweet. I had something like this in Indonesia.
Yeah, I had something like that in Indonesia.
- Ah, yeah, in Indonesia they have.
Yeah.
- Where you came from?
I'm from Scotland.
Ah, Scotland.
- Okay.
Please subscribe, okay?
On Facebook? Okay.
Okay.
Dale.

Video creator.
- Aye!
Dale.
- Yes.
Dale, yeah.
Oh, this one has ube?
Yes.
- It's ube, right?
Ah, okay, it's ube and cheese.
So it's like that,
but instead of cassava it's ube?
Yes, sir.
- Okay, I'll definitely get some of that.
Okay.
So I'm gonna, like...
I'm probably gonna get a piece of each one
and I'll go and try them all out.
Yeah.
They look good.
Did you subscribe?
Yes.
- Or "follow." It's Facebook, right?
It's called "follow" on Facebook.
She followed me on Facebook.
It's good.
Okay, so I'm gonna get one of the ube ones.
I'm gonna get one of the black sticky rice.
And then I'll get two more.
I'll see what's good.
Then we'll go, maybe...
Maybe I'll take them down to the park that's nearby
and try them out, down there, in peace.
Okay, so I want one of the ube ones.
You want?
- One of the sticky rice.
And then, maybe... What is this?
This one, maja blanca.
Maja blanca?
- Maja blanca.
This one ube ????.
This one's also ube?

Promoting.
But he walked away.
Okay, see you.
It didn't work.
Didn't work as well as...
The last time I helped a Filipina lady
sell her goods, was in
Kuala Lumpur.
If you haven't watched that vlog, check it out, guys.
I went around the Filipino mall in Kuala Lumpur,
with a Filipina lady,
and helped her sell her,
it was some kind of like banana
thing that she was selling.
Hi. Okay, sure.
- Can I take a picture with you?
Oh, hello.
Hi, sir.
Good? Okay, nice to see you.
Okay.
How's my box coming along?
Okay.

Yeah, I'm Dale. Nice to see you.
I see your videos.

Where are you from?
I'm Philippines.
Yeah, but Baguio or another place?
I'm from Leyte.
Ah, okay, from Leyte?
- Yes.
Okay, good.
I have a friend living in Leyte.
Oh.
- Yeah.
But, you know, when I'm walking around,
I didn't see anyone from Baguio.
Everyone is a tourist here.
Oh, yes.
- Everyone.
Okay, nice to see you.
- Thank you.
Okay.
Yeah.
Oh, okay, we're getting some of this

Yeah, looks like it's...

And also this one.
Another ube one.

Okay, sir. But,

Yeah, 12 each times 10 is 120.
It's good.
So it's just over $2.
It's good.
That amount of sweet treats for just over $2
is pretty decent.
Sir.
Yes?
- Can I take a photo?
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
- Me and you.
Here's your 120.
Oh, you want me to hold this?
- You've been so many places, sir.
Yeah, so many. Oh, yes.
So many, but now, Philippines.
After Baguio, I don't know where to go.
Where should I go after Baguio?
Next, where should I go?
You can try Banaue.
Where?
Banaue rice terraces.
Where is it?
- Banaue rice terraces.
Banaue?
One of the 8 wonders.
It's one of the 8 wonders? Really?
- Yeah.
How far from Baguio?
It's only,
eh, 8 hours.
8 hours?
Yeah.
- Oh, wow, that's a long time.
Okay.
Eh, maybe. I will think about it.
The Banaue rice terraces.
- Banaue?
Banaue.
- Banaue?
Banaue rice terraces.
- Banaue rice terraces.
That's where she's saying I should go,
Banaue rice terraces.
- One of the 8 wonders of the Philippines.
8 wonders of the Philippines?
It's my province.
Oh, it's your province?
Yeah.
- Ah, and you come to Baguio for working?
Yeah.
- Ah, okay.
Thank you, sir.
- Okay, it's a good one.
Okay, nice to see you, guys.
Okay, bye, bye.
Bye, bye.
- Okay,
so, I'm gonna take this to the park
and
I'm not gonna try all of them, guys.
It's like...
That would kill me. Look at the size...
It weighs, like,
I dunno, it weighs like a couple of kilos at least.
It's like a couple of kilos there.
That would absolutely destroy me.
I'm gonna try,
I'm looking forward to the ube ones.
Ube is delicious, so
you'll find, when you come to the Philippines, guys,
if you come here
on your travels,
and you see anything purple coloured,
and it looks unusual,
that should be a reason for you to try it,
not for you not to try it.
Yeah, these purple coloured desserts,
they're all made with this ube, this kinda like,
this yam.
It's kinda like, something like a sweet potato,
but
tastier in desserts.
This purple colour.
And
yeah, it's delicious.
So, those are the ones that I'm looking forward to.
Right, the park is,
the park is just over there,
over that side of the road, so
that's where I'm gonna sit and
try these out.
So, I'm walking through the park now.
All the benches seem to be taken.
It's very busy. Look at the lake.
The lake is busy as well.
This is a Saturday afternoon.
Everybody's enjoying.
Hi.
- Can I take a picture?
Okay.
I saw you in Facebook.
Oh, really, Facebook? Good.
Are you Dale?
Yeah, Dale.
- Yeah.
Okay, no worries.
See you.
Okay, what I'm actually gonna do.
Oh, there are some free benches there.
But I've already changed my mind.
I'm gonna
just walk back to my hotel
and eat this on the balcony
of my hotel.
And
then I'll be able to eat it with a wee metal spoon.
Enjoy it more than getting my hands all sticky.
And also,
I have to carry it like this, flat, so
you know, I have to go back to my hotel, anyway,
to put it there, because,
if I carry this around,
in this wee backpack,
which is already half full with my strawberries,
which I should really just go and put in the fridge, you know,
yeah, they'll get in a mess.
Imagine the mess, if they were all,
these jelly sweets,
were all swishing around
in,
in my bag,
as I go on my adventures around this
beautiful, beautiful city.
They would be in a right old mess, so
let's make our way back up to the Orchard Hotel.
Home sweet home.
Where I get to enjoy
this lovely view right here.
I get to enjoy this lovely view,
with my lovely
local treats.
And check them out, guys.
Check them out.
Look at the colours.
Look at the vibrant colours
on these sweets.
They look delicious.
I know that the one that I had,
was delicious.
So,
let's get stuck in, guys.
Right here, on my nice balcony.
I'm all refreshed.
I've changed my t-shirt.
I've washed my hands,
even though it doesn't look like it.
I've still got the ink mark from the
amusement park.
If I'm...
The next vlog I'm doing, if I still have this,
people are gonna be calling me a dirty so-and-so.
Saying that I never wash and stuff.
I've washed. I've tried to scrub it off.
It's not coming off.
But, yeah,
here on the balcony, got the metal spoon,
just soaked up some air conditioning,
changed the t-shirt, freshened up.
Coke Zero Vanilla.
Ahhhh, yes!
A much better idea than sitting in that park,
trying to eat this
sticky, gooey,
goodness, right here.
And it is goodness.
It was a bit healthy, that,
that one that I tried.
Was it...? It was this one, here.
It was this one here, the creamy cassava.
I was
very low on the sweetness.
Yeah.
Like I said, like 1 or 2 out of 10 on sweetness.
A little bit of cheesiness,
and then it's like all jelly. So,
a few of these look like the same,
but it's maybe different ingredients.
Instead of cassava, for example,
it is...
Well this one here
looks like it's...
Come on.
Looks like it's the ube, right there,
with some orange stuff on top.
I don't think that's cheese
on this one.
Ohhh!
Ho
Hoho
Hohoho
Hohohoho
Hohohohoho
Hohohohohoho
Hohohohohohoho
Hohohohohohohoho
Mmmmmm!
Oh, yeah, that's better.
That's better than the cassava one.
And yeah, not to sweet.
So this,
I dunno if all these sweets are like this,
and they're not too sweet,
but,
it's very, very low in sugar.
Which is good.
You could eat a lot of this and not feel like
you've had too much sugar, you know?
I'm not gonna, obviously, eat...
In fact, I'm just gonna take one spoonful of each.
I'm gonna keep the rest for later.
Probably last me a few days.
She said this one was sweet, though.
I remember her saying
this one was sweet.
And that's almost...
Didn't drop it. It's still on the,
it's still in the box.
This one's almost all the ube.
The top layer is just very thin.
It just tastes the same as the other one.
And again, not too sweet.
Right. Oh, I want to try this.
This is like the,
the black sticky rice one.
So this is like what I had in Indonesia,
at the street market there. It was called Wajik,
I believe.
In Sumatra, in Danau Toba,
there was a street market, and it was very cheap.
Just like this one
12
pesos.
That is like
20 cents.
20 cents a piece, guys,
for this
homemade,
homemade treat, right here.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
It's that glutinous chewy rice and there's like a bit of,
a bit of the rice texture in there.
So you've got, like, the...
Some guy's motorbike just
making noise for the whole of this,
the whole of this area.
It's like that sometimes.
Some of these guys, they have
just the loudest exhausts on their motorbike
and there doesn't seem to be any regulations about it.
They just go around
causing noise pollution. It's annoying.
Especially when you're here,
in peaceful Baguio,
just chillin' on your balcony,
enjoying some Filipino version of the Indonesia
Wajik.
But, yeah, there's little pieces of the rice there,
so you've got, like, that texture, you know,
but it's all, like, sticky and chewy,
and it's nice.
And this one, it's not as sweet as the one I had in Indonesia, so
I think it's just this baker,
this
sweet shop lady.
I think she likes to make it not sweet,
which I appreciate.
You can eat more, you can eat more.
Next one I want to try, though,
is this.
This is a very thick one.
And she said it was made with milk.
And I very much like milk and anything dairy, so
I'm assuming I'm gonna like this.
Mmm.
Oh, yeah.
It's a little bit sweeter than the other ones.
Yeah, it's like a milk jelly.
Yeah, just a milk jelly. That's what it is, guys,
That's what it is.
Now, are these different?
Yeah, this is.
This one's got ube on the top
and then some kinda jelly stuff on the bottom.
Mmm.
I prefer these ones though.
The ones that have the thicker,
the thicker layer of ube,
'cause that is just the best taste,
out of all of this, the ube.
Guy's, the ube, ube, ube
is the best taste.
Right,
I'm gonna
not eat anything else from this.
I'm gonna kinda just like, put it away all nicely,
after having the good idea to come here,
and not have it all messed up in my backpack.
So,
yeah, I'm gonna like put this away.
That's gonna last me a few days, guys,
for sure.
I'm gonna be snacking on that.
I've got the fresh strawberries as well.
I've got plenty of snacks.
That's what you want when you're in a place like this,
when you've got your own balcony, because
yeah, you just wanna, like,
sometimes just sit here and just
you know, look out onto the view,
think about things,
enjoy your life,
enjoy your peaceful life, here,
in peaceful Baguio.
Well,
it is kinda peaceful.
It's very busy.
It's a very popular place.
There is a lot of
domestic tourists here.
It can get a busy down there.
But when you're up here it's peaceful, isn't it?
Check this out.
No noise,
until the next motorbike comes past.
Very nice.
Anyway, guys, I'll see you down there.
I'm gonna go back out to that market,
'cause we haven't completed
the second of the two missions that I had.
Which was to find myself some kind of Baguio t-shirt.
Some kind of souvenir of this city before I leave.
So,
yeah, we always complete our missions.
Even if I have to, like, finish the vlog tomorrow.
Even if it started pouring with rain, right now,
I would finish the vlog tomorrow, guys.
We complete our missions.
Let's do it.
And I think I might have tempted fate
by talking about
if it pours down with rain, guys.
The clouds are black.
There's a bit more of a breeze.
I just feel like a storm is coming.
So check it out,
there's Transformers and stuff for the kids.
You, like, take a photo and just pay whatever you want.
Like 20 pesos, whatever.
Up to you, I think.
But,
yeah, hopefully I can make it to this market before it start raining.
Everybody still seems to be hanging around, enjoying themselves, so
I guess they don't think it's gonna start raining.
But,
yeah,
sky is looking suspicious, guys.
It's looking suspicious.
- Hello, bro.
Hi, how are you?
Good.
Okay.
Wonder who this is?
This is Daniel Hudson Burnham.
Ah, okay. Let's read about him.
Daniel Hudson Burnham.
So this is Burnham Park,
so it's named after him.
And it's a world renowned American architect.
So, I can't be bothered reading it all, but
I'm just gonna assume that he was the guy who designed this park.
Nice one, mate.
It's a nice park. One of the better parks
I've seen on my travels, actually.
It's very nice.
Okay, it is spitting down with rain, so
I'm just gonna get myself into this market down here.
Ah, good. Shelter.
Now, I can look down
on everybody else
getting rained on.
Fantastic.
All salons.
Got something there called
a "Brazilian Blow Out."
A Brazilian blow out? I know what a Brazilian is.
What's a Brazilian blow out?
Is it instead of,
instead of waxing all your hair off,
they use like an extra powered blower.
Like how you,
you blow the leaves away from your garden.
Like an extra powered one of them to blow the
hair away from your 'you know what.'
Is that how that goes?
Oh, no, they're closing this.
Oh, this is the shopping centre.
Ah, this is not the market,
is it?
I've taken some wrong turn, somewhere.
But this is not the market.
This is some actual shopping centre.
I wonder if I could get my t-shirt in here.
Even though they look like they're
starting to close it
already.
Yeah, this is like one of these little,
little sketchy malls.
Look at that, less than $2 for a pair of Adidas shorts.
Very nice, eh?
Good value in this place.
Yeah, I don't see any of the touristy t-shirts that I'm looking for.
Hi, how are you?
Good?
Yeah.
Okay, I might have to go back to that public market, because
I definitely...
I seen some, actually, when I was eating my strawberry ice cream.
But I was concentrating on the ice cream.
And then I meant to go back to it.
I meant to go back to it and then I found the sweet stall.
And then that was it.
Hey man, how are you?
- Hey man, I'm okay.
Good.
- Oh!
Hey, it was a fist bump, not a high five.
Give me a fist bump, fist bump.
Okay.
Anyone selling Baguio t-shirt?
Baguio t-shirt?
Baguio t-shirt?
- Yeah, like a t-shirt with "Baguio."
Like this.
No?
Okay. I will have a look around.
I think no English.
Okay.
Yeah. Oh, there's a wee food court in here as well.
A 'Sisig Station,"
right here. It smells lovely.
It smells,
it smells like the spices of Sisig.
It smells nice.
Okay. Oh, "Exit To City Market."
Okay, that's where I wanna go.
I always watching your videos.
Nice one.
So he drove 12 hours in Luzon to come to Baguio.
Yeah, and you're gonna stay for a week, right?
Eh, no.
Until Monday, only.
Oh, just the weekend? Ah, okay.
- Yes.
Ah, okay.
And have you done anything interesting here?
Eh, no.
This is our first day in Baguio.
- Ah, okay.
So you're just chillin' in the city?
Yeah, everyone I speak to, they're not really doing anything,
or going anywhere, they're just kinda enjoying the weather,
the cool weather and stuff.
It's more cool than in your province?
No. Here? Yes.
Yeah, it's like much fresher, right?
- Yes.
Because I'm,
we're from Isabela.
Isabela?
Isabela is a province.
- Isabela? I don't know it.
It's a province, also in Luzon.
It's south Luzon?
- Northern part of Luzon.
Wow, more north than here?
- Yes.
Ah, okay, so near the sea, or?
Mmm, near to?
Near to the water, near to the ocean, or?
- Yes.
Ah, okay, so it's lowland.
And Baguio is highland and cool.
- Yes, yes.
Ah, okay.
Well, I hope you're enjoying.
It was nice to see you.
Nice to see you.
- Okay, I'm going to the market now.
See you.
Okay.
Let's...
I think this is only one way traffic.
Oh, I think we're straight into the market.
I think we're straight into the market here.
Yeah, this is it.
Okay, I just need to hope that the...
Oh, getting wet.
I just need to hope that the
the t-shirt stall isn't shutting down.
Oh, this is the lady I bought the sweets from.
I'll tell her it was nice.
Hello.
I'm gonna tell her.
Hey, they were nice.
The ube one was...
Oh, the ube one's sold out already.
Yeah, it was lovely, yeah.
It was very nice. Thank you.
Okay.
Just thought I'd,
just thought that I'd let her know that her
produce,
her baked goods...
Hi, again.
It was very nice.
The ube one was delicious.
Okay.
Yeah, just,
nice to let her know that
her goods are nice.
Now, here, yeah, look.
See, that's what I seen before.
There's, like,
Baguio t-shirts, loads of them,
right there.
They have XS to XL, only.
So, XL will probably be good for me.
If it's,
if it's Filipino sizes.
There's a huge,
huge demand for this one.
Look, there's like 8 people,
waiting here.
And this one, also, is selling Baguio t-shirts.
There's a huge selection.
So,
yeah, which one looks good?
Probably the one with the strawberries on it.
That would be nice.
Or the one here with the license plate.
Hmm.
Sorry, can I have a look?
I'm gonna have a look.
So it's 2 t-shirts for 180.
That's a bargain. That is like
$3 for 2 t-shirts.
Like $1.50 each.
Wow.
And.
Oh, wow, they feel good.
They feel good as well.
It's not all that stuff stuck onto it,
that I don't like. It's nice and smooth.
Okay.
I need to find myself
two of these that I like.
Well, the first one that caught my eye was the strawberry one
and then the license plate one.
I think that's gonna be good for me.
I'll see who's working here.
Hi.
Do you have XL size for these white ones?
Yes, we have.
- XL? Ah.
So, I want the one with the strawberry
and the one with the license plate.
For the license plate we don't have XL.
Oh, really?
Oh, those were the two that I like.
- Have more prints, sir.
Okay.
We have other prints.
Let's see what you have.
Oh, this one has a big thread coming out of it.
It's only the excess.
XL.
Ah.
"City of Pines."
Yeah, there's a big,
there's a big pine tree right outside my hotel.
Right across from the balcony,
this huge pine tree. So,
I guess it's known as the city of pines.
And gonna look for the strawberry one.
Where's the XL of the strawberry one?
Can I try for size?
Can I try it on?
- For the white one, we don't have.
You don't have a sample?
Why not?
I'm going to...
- It's white.
It's white? Ah, so it will get dirty?
- Yeah.
Yes.
- Okay, well,
I dunno.
- That one.
It's your size, sir.
- Baguio city.
Oh, yeah, it's nice and smooth.
That one's good, sir.
- I like this one.
Hmm.
Yeah, I think that's,
that's probably gonna be the best.
Okay, well,
it's unusual that I don't get to try,
but it's so cheap that, if it doesn't fit me,
and I have to just give it away to somebody else or whatever, then
it's fine. Like $1.50 each.
I'm actually gonna,
I'm gonna buy it and then I'm gonna,
I'm gonna wear it. This one here, the strawberry one.
I want to wear that about.
So it's 180 for 2?
- Yes, sir.
Okay, good.
It's a good deal.
You're busy like this all the time?
No.
- No?
'Cause it's the weekend, right?
- Yes, sir.
Ah, okay.
Yeah.
I'm gonna wear this one.
Yeah, I will buy it then I will wear it.
Where will you keep it?
Uh?
No, I will just...
Yeah, I will just wear it around.
I'm gonna...
Oh, you look good.
- Okay, good.
How does this look?
- You look good.
Yeah, I know.
It's the perfect fit,
so just as well.
Okay, that's good.
And the other one is mine.
I don't need the plastic. I already have a bag.
So I will just, yeah.
And this one too.
Can you take this one? Okay, good.
Fantastic.
Okay, thank you so much.
- Thank you.
Thank you. Nice doing business with you.
Okay, that's good.
That's a nice, quick transaction, compared to
you know, some touristy markets,
in some places, you have to bargain. No fixed price.
There, the fixed price is already so cheap.
Like $1.50.
Probably, you could bargain.
You could even bargain if
you were gonna buy like 10 t-shirts or something like that.
You know, like gifts for people back home.
Something like that. You could even bargain it down from that,
but you can't bargain, when it's already 2 for 180 pesos,
you can't bargain.
Even me.
Even Bargaining Dale
didn't even think about attempting that.
Guys, I'm very happy, this
perfectly fitting...
Hi, how are you?
How do you like my new t-shirt?
- Oh, yeah.
It's good, uh? Strawberries.
- Good, yeah.
Some good strawberries in this market as well.
- Yeah.
You from Baguio or tourist?
- Baguio.
Oh, but you are the first one.
The first one.
Every time I speak to someone they are a tourist.
You are the first one from Baguio.
I watch your...
- Oh, thank you so much.
Nice to see you, bro.
Okay.
Yeah, that's the first
The whole day, the whole day I've been talking to people
and asking them where they're from. That is the first,
the first Baguio person.
Hi, how are you?
Are you Dale Philip?
- Yes, I'm Dale Philip. How are you?
Can I get a picture?
- What is your name?
Paul.
- Hi, Paul, nice to meet you.
Can I get a picture?
- Okay, yeah, sure.
You wanna do a selfie, or?
What's your name?
- You gonna do a selfie? Hi. Dale.
Dale? You're Dale, really?
- Yeah.
Hi.
- THE Dale?
THE Dale? Yeah.
No, THE Dale is Dale Earnhardt Jr.
I'm the other Dale. The blogger one.
Can I take a picture with you?
- Yeah, okay, sure.
Good one.
Okay, that's a good photo.
See you, guys. Enjoy your time here.
Okay.
- Thank you.
That's good, guys.
Mission complete, mission complete.
Yer man got his,
his Baguio t-shirt.
Looking like a right tourist.
Looking like a right tourist here.
I don't normally like to look like a right tourist.
Especially places like, I dunno,
like Bangkok, Hanoi,
these types of places, because it makes you
a prime target for
scammers and such, but
my whole time in the Philippines, so far,
Manila and Baguio, I haven't met one scammer.
Even, I took the metered taxi,
the white metered taxi.
Didn't try to rip me off.
Just turned on the meter and
gave me the cheap price.
So it's good. I don't mind,
I don't mind standing out like a tourist.
Everybody's a tourist here in Baguio
anyway, aren't they?
The strawberry,
the strawberry city.
Lovely.
Check this out.
They're selling burgers for 15 pesos each.
It's like $0.25.
Wow.
About $0.25 for a burger, guys.
That's the patties right there.
Hi.
They're very cheap.
15 pesos. Very small price.
It is good.
Okay. I'm gonna join the queue.
There's...
Looks like it's popular.
Look how many they're frying up, right here.
So they're obviously planning on selling all of those.
Wow. Look at how they make them.
They've got a system where they just,
you know, they open like 12 buns,
Okay, you wanna take a selfie?
- Yes, sir.
Okay, yeah, they open like 12 buns and then
sauce, mayonnaise, patty.
Okay, it's a good one.
Yes, sir.
- Okay, nice to see you, guys.
Welcome to Baguio.
-Okay.
What is your top? From where?
- SLU.
Okay, that's your university?
Yes, sir.
- Ah, okay, nice one.
Nice to see you guys.
Okay, I'm gonna get a burger from,
from this shop right here.
15 pesos, guys.
Hello.
May I have a picture with you?
- Okay, sure.
When have you ever had a burger for 25 cents, guys?
Okay, you got it?
- Yes.
Okay, good.
- Thank you, thank you.
When have you ever had a burger for 25 cents?
I think,
I think I'm out of the queue now.
I was in the queue.
Okay.
Oh, it's okay? Okay.
Yeah, I think,
the queue kinda like avoided me and started...
Okay, it's fine, I'm number 3 now.
Yeah.
I can't believe it.
Like,
if you're from the UK or America,
how many years ago was it,
where you could buy a burger for 25 cents, or 20 pence
in the UK?
I guess most of my viewers aren't old enough to remember those days.
When would it be, like in the 1970's or something?
Jesus.
And they obviously make their money on quantity.
It's a whole system. Look, she's
she's frying up maybe like 50 of them right there.
50 burgers at once and then
they've got the system right here.
Just one burger, please.
Okay.
They're so fast.
They're faster than I can get the money out my pocket.
Sorry.
Okay.
The smell.
The smell is delicious, guys,
of all those burgers frying up.
Okay.
Gonna walk back down to the park and eat it
on the,
on the park bench, in peace.
Guy selling henna tattoos.
I've practically got a tattoo from my
trip to the theme park earlier on.
They tattooed me.
Okay, we've got a nice
bench right here,
where we can sit down,
and try this burger out, guys,
Let's have a look.
We've got the nice, soft bun.
And in the middle. the beef patty,
right there.
Basically what you would get with a Big Mac, guys.
About the same kinda portion size, but
a very different price.
A very cheaper price, isn't it?
So cheap, so cheap.
If this is anywhere decent I'm gonna be pleased.
Uhoh.
Yer man's littering.
Can't be doing that.
Okay, under there,
should stop it from blowing away.
Yeah.
For the price, you can't complain,
if it's anywhere near decent.
So let's stick it in the gob
and give it a go.
Mmm.
Hey, how are you?
How are you?
- You good?
Yeah.
- Nice to see you.
Okay.
What do I think of this burger?
The patty's delicious.
It's not like a,
it's not like if you go to McDonald's and you get, like, the
beef patty, which is just beef and salt.
They just make it with beef and salt.
This has got little chunks of green stuff through it.
Maybe some green pepper or something.
And it's very,
yeah, it's very seasoned, it's very peppery.
Kinda like how the Jollibee burger was.
Jollibee burger was, like, flavoured like that.
Flavoured with some spice.
And
this is the same.
Not as nice as the Jollibee.
The Jollibee one had some delicious sauce on it.
This is just your standard
ketchup and mayonnaise, but
for the price, for the price...
I can't even believe that it's only 15 pesos.
For the price, this is very, very nice.
Mmm.
Superb.
Enjoyed that.
Thoroughly enjoyed that.
Hey, how are you?
Okay.
Cool.
Nice.
Waited until I finished my food. That was good.
Some people don't do that.
Okay.
Selfie.
- 1, 2, 3.
Okay, good.
Nice one.
Ah, okay.
- Can I get a selfie?
I know you.
Dale Philip.
- I'm checking out your t-shirt.
Who's on your t-shirt?
- Parokya.
Parokya?
- Local band.
Ah, it's a local band? Ah, okay.
- Yeah.
They're rappers, or?
- Yeah.
They're rappers? Oh.
Yeah.
- Okay.
I know this guy.
Thank you.
- Okay, nice to see you.
- Hi, sir.
Hi, how are you?
- Can you take a picture, please?
Oh, with you? Okay, sure.
- Yeah.
Hi.
Ah, okay. Okay.
Okay, we've got a queue.
It's good.
They all waited until I
finished my burger.
So that's the good thing.
- 1, 2, 3.
Okay, next.
Thank you, sir.
- Okay.
- Are you a blogger?
No problem. Nice to see you. Yes.
Hi, blogger.
- From Scotland.
Oh.
- Yes.
Nice.
1, 2, 3.
- I want follow you.
Okay next.
We're all sisters.
All?
- Yeah.
No, I'm the mother.
Oh, you're the mother and sisters?
Ah, okay.
- Yeah.
So, mother and four sisters.
Oh, wow.
And you come here on vacation?
Yeah, vacation for three days.
3 days? Are you enjoying the weather?
It's so nice, right?
- Of course.
So nice.
- 1, 2, 3.
Okay, and mama.
Okay.
Okay.
1, 2, 3.
Thank you.
- Okay, nice to see you girls.
Okay, see you.
I'm gonna head back, guys.
I'm gonna head back to
my hotel, but
yeah, the vlog's not over.
I think I'll do something else tomorrow
and just continue the vlog,
shall I?
What's up vlog?
- Hey.
A lot of,
yeah, a lot of vloggers, they just try and make, like,
a new vlog every day.
I'm more easy going.
We can make this a really good vlog if we just
continue it tomorrow.
And then if it's raining tomorrow
we'll continue it the next day.
No pressure, no stress,
guys. Just enjoying,
the peaceful
times
in this city, Baguio.
Okay, I'll see you tomorrow.
We'll find something to do.
I dunno what. I'm gonna,
I'm gonna go and Google and find at least
one thing that's out of this, kinda like, area, where
I'm just spending all my time in this kinda area,
which is nice, but I'll try and find something
to do on the outskirts or something.
Good afternoon, Baguio.
Guys, it is now Sunday afternoon,
1 PM and yer man is chillin'
here on the balcony, with
his wee strawberries he got from the wee market,
over there, yesterday.
Lovely.
Enjoying myself here,
in this city.
Enjoying the fresh weather.
The cool breeze.
There's always a cool breeze.
Even when it's sunny,
you know, you don't feel uncomfortable.
There's a bit of sun coming through the clouds, here.
So this side's all bright
and there's like dark clouds over there.
So I don't know what way the day
is going to go, but
I'm gonna get out and about today, guys. So,
all my time in Baguio so far,
I've been spending it
around this kinda like central area.
I've been to the mall, the park,
the markets over there.
It's this kinda central area.
This hotel is actually really good,
really well positioned for, like,
you know, getting around.
Yeah, I notice a lot of the hotels on
like Agoda and stuff,
a lot of the Airbnbs, they were further out.
They were like... You see how there's buildings up there,
up on the hills and stuff.
They were in places like that, which
wouldn't be so convenient.
This park's really nice,
the mall's really good and everything, so
yeah, I think I chose a good hotel here.
It's the Orchard Hotel.
Paying $100 a night.
I think their cheapest rooms were like $60 a night or whatever, but
I have the balcony, don't I?
I have this balcony here
and the view, which
is definitely worth it.
I was a bit disappointment when I checked in.
The room just looked like a standard room.
And you know, I'd paid, like, the upgraded price,
for like the premier room or something.
And I was expecting something a bit special.
And I was like, this just looks like a standard room.
But I guess this is probably what I'm paying for, because
on the other side of the hotel
they're not gonna have any view.
I don't even know if they have any balcony, but
this is well worth it, guys.
If you come to this city, Baguio,
you gotta get yourself a nice view and a nice balcony, because,
yeah, you'll just be standing here,
you know, chewing on your strawberries,
enjoying life.
You know, every day.
Anyway, I'm planning on getting out and about today, guys.
so, I've had a look on Google Maps
for places to go
and I have decided I'm going to go to a place called,
I think it's gonna be, like
over the peak there,
called Mount...
What is it called again? Mount
Kalugong, that's what it's called, Mt. Kalugong.
And it's like a mountain with an eco park
and like a cultural village or whatever,
but the main reason I wanna go there is
there is a hiking trail
that's maximum like an hour, so
a nice easy hike with a nice view.
If it will be clear.
And, yeah, that seems a good idea for something to do,
because all the other, like,
tourist attractions that I see on Google Maps,
like, you see photo icons over there,
over there and stuff.
And you click on it and it's just like an Instagram spot.
You know, it's like some kinda viewpoint
where people, they go there to take
like an Instagram shot and
nothing else is really there.
At least this place that I've chosen to go to today, Mount
Kalugong, over there somewhere,
there's an actual hiking trail, so
yeah,
apparently only an hour's maximum hiking, so
plenty of,
1 PM right now, plenty of time for me to get there,
do my hike and come back.
And
The way I'm gonna get there, guys,
is, I'm just gonna take a taxi there.
I'm gonna go down onto the street and just find a taxi,
to take me there.
Because, I've researched that
from the main town, down there, like outside the market or something,
you can get a jeepney.
You know,
these kinda like, pickup truck things,
that are really cheap.
You can get a jeepney for like 12 pesos,
that will take you most of the way there,
but you have to hike an extra 30 minutes up a hill,
to get to the starting point of the trek,
or to enter the cultural village or whatever.
So what I'm thinking is,
I'll take a taxi there, all the way to the,
you know, the
cultural village, the start point of the trail, proper.
So I'm not wasting...
I don't want to hike up a dirty road or something like that for 30 minutes.
Especially uphill.
That's not gonna be much fun.
Yeah, I'm gonna do that,
take the taxi all the way there,
and then maybe I'll walk down the hill on the way back and try and
do the fun option and take the,
the fun and cheap option,
take the jeepney back into town.
And get dropped off in the centre, there.
So,
yeah, that is the plan, guys.
I'm gonna sit here and enjoy my strawberries
and then
we will get out
and try and make our way to
Mt. Kalugong.
Bro, you working now?
????
You can take me?
Where?
- Mount Kalugong.
Kalugong.
- Mount Kalugong?
Too far.
- Too far?
Good for you.
You don't want to take me, no?
Okay, wait.
Okay, so I just seen this guy,
just parked up.
He's gonna buy some medicine or something.
He says it's too far to Mount Kalugong.
By Google Maps, it's like
25 - 35 minutes drive, so
I dunno, surely that's good for a taxi driver.
A longer distance means a higher fare, right?
But then,
yeah, he has to come back without a fare, so
we'll see. I'll talk to him.
You want to take me?
Yes.
- Yes, okay.
He's gonna take me, Mount Kalugong.
I buy medicine for my
????
Okay.
We going by meter, yes?
By meter, yes?
Okay, good.
And how many minutes driving?
Maybe 25 minutes?
- No!
No?
- Too far.
Too far? How many minutes?
Maybe, if there's no traffic,
we can reach in 40.
40 minutes? Ah, okay.
How much do you think, by meter, it's going to cost?
Eh...
Almost 200.
Almost 200? Ah, okay.
We'll see.
- 200.
Ah, okay.
We'll see. Depend how long.
With the traffic and stuff, right? Yeah.
But today is Sunday.
Little traffic, right?
- Eh, too many tourists.
Oh, many tourists are coming?
Yes.
- Ah, okay, so...
From the strawberry farm.
- They're causing the traffic?
The tourists are causing the traffic,
in Baguio.
So Saturday and Sunday in Baguio are busy times?
- Yes.
Because people coming from other places in Luzon?
Yes, sir.
- Ah, okay.
And weekdays are quiet, yes?
Eh, same here.
The rush hour.
Ah, okay, just the rush hour?
Ah, okay.
Ah, that's nice, they're painting the buildings.
????
Ah, okay. I seen something like this in Indonesia.
They paint them in all the different colours.
Like the rainbow village.
Very nice.
- From there you can see the,
going up there.
- Okay.
Yeah, I might check that out at some point.
Ah, okay.
So there's stairs there.
You get a good view of the village.
Ah, okay, so it's like a viewpoint there.
Okay.
See the traffic.
Yeah.
So you're gonna get this traffic coming back?
- Yes.
Okay, I'm sorry.
He's gonna get all this traffic coming back.
so everyone is going into Baguio?
- Yes.
Now, why?
So are these all tourists or local people or what?
- No. Local people.
Local people? Ah.
Okay.
So even on a Sunday,
even on a Sunday all the local people are causing traffic jams.
And it's like 1:30 PM or something like that,
so it's the middle of the afternoon.
So we're almost there.
Mount Kalugong is up here.
So if I took...
Ah, Mt. Kalugong.
Okay, there's the sign.
So if I took the jeepney it would have dropped me off there.
Yeah, the jeepney would have dropped me off here.
So this is what I would have had to walk up,
if I hadn't taken the taxi.
Oh wow, it's so steep.
It's like a 60 degree angle or something.
Wow.
We are here.
This is the entrance.
They say they close the gate at 6 PM, so
I've got plenty of time.
Okay, thank you so much.
Okay, and the ride was 175.
Okay, that was good.
Oh, looks like you've got a customer coming back.
Yes.
You want this taxi?
Yeah.
- Okay, good.
Good for you. You get a ride coming back.
Okay.
Yeah, it's good.
Okay.
Okay, a little tip for you.
Okay?
- Thank you.
Nice one. Thank you.
Okay.
- Okay, okay.
Good timing, right? Good timing.
Okay. Yes, okay.
- Good timing. Ah, yes. Yes, yes.
It's okay.
That's good.
They were just hanging around.
I think they were waiting for somebody to get dropped off.
I'm going to do the hiking trail.
Hiking?
- Yeah, there's a trail, right?
I dunno.
I will look. There's like walking, walking, hiking?
Eh...
- Yeah?
Okay.
- Yes.
Okay, see you.
Yes, walking.
Yeah, walking.
I'll go now, yes.
Okay.
Okay, so this is the village.
I heard you had to pay
100 pesos just to come in here, but
there's nobody at the gate,
so I've just walked it
and now I'm looking for
a hiking trail.
I guess it will probably be taking me
up there.
Guys, how to get up there?
I can go this way and up? Okay.
I better be quick.
I just hear thunder.
I can hear thunder.
Hi.
How are you, brother?
Nice to see you.
Yeah, I'm going...
- I watched some of your videos.
Really, uh?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
I see you going around looking for food.
Yeah, well today I'm just looking for the hiking trail.
There's like a way to have a nice view, right?
Yeah, there is.
There's actually 3 spots here.
We have
- Okay.
Mount Kalugong, which is one of them.
We have the other one which is on...
- Yeah.
Eh, what do you call this?
Agro tourism.
And the other one is
"To the moon."
To the moon?
Yeah, we have a rocky mountain. We call.
Rocky mountain? Ah.
- That's where the crescent moon is.
Ah, okay.
They have viewpoints and hangout spots,
kind of like that, and...
But Mount Kalugong is more like of a trail, walking?
Yeah?
Yeah, they have like...
- Okay, well that's what I wanna do.
I wanna do some walking, get some fresh air.
Ah, feels good.
Just as long as it doesn't rain.
I think it's gonna rain.
Yeah, it is gonna rain. I know.
I can hear it, I can hear the thunder.
And the visibility isn't great,
so I better,
I better start walking then.
- I suggest you should go to both.
Okay, the rocky mountain and the...
Rocky mountain and Mount Kalugong.
- Mount Kalugong.
Okay, I'll do the trail to Kalugong first.
So I just go over there, yeah?
There will be a start?
- There will be a pathway.
If you go straight.
Go up there and then
Kalugong is this side.
On the right side in,
rocky mountain will be just on the left,
eh, right side, and then
Kalugong's...
- Kalugong's left? Okay.
Okay, I will go for it now.
Nice to see you, brother.
- Nice to meet you.
Okay, see you.
Okay, good.
Got some good advice.
I thought there was just kinda like one place up here,
but he said there's three distinct places,
with three different managements.
So, Kalugong is like the hiking trail.
There's some rocky mountain,
which is like rock formations.
And another one,
was like a crescent moon or something like that.
He called it 'To The Moon'
or something.
I don't know.
We'll figure it out.
I'm probably gonna go for the... Hi.
What is it? Oh.
A selfie, first.
- Okay, selfie first.
Okay.
Let's go for it.
- It will be cool.
Thank you.
- Okay, nice one.
Okay. Hey little dog.
Are you trying to be scary?
You're not scary.
Look at the size of you.
You're tiny.
You're barking and running away from me.
You''re tiny.
Why you barking at me?
Okay, guys.
Yeah, I guess somewhere we'll find the start of the trail.
Ah, here we go.
So this is taking us to Mount Kalugong
and there's another one, 'To the Moon,'
there.
So,
looks like some
people joining us on the trek
that we're gonna overtake right now.
Hey, guys, can I overtake?
Is that okay?
- Yeah, it's okay.
Okay, thank you.
Cheers.
Enjoy your hike.
Okay.
Let's do it, guys.
So they've built this kinda,
mesh
wire, metal
kinda trail.
Otherwise I dunno how you would get up here.
Ah, here's it's saying we have to pay something, 100.
To who though, to who?
Hi, guys.
Okay.
Ah, here.
Hi, how are you?
I have to register? Okay.
Okay.
Oh, I get a stamp.
Payment of 100.
100, okay.
Okay, so I can go all the way up here,
and then come back down
and then see the rock formations there.
And then there's a coffee shop.
- Yeah.
Okay.
Thank you, so much.
You're welcome.
- Okay.
That's nice.
Got some advice.
So, this is the trail up here.
Yeah, let's go for it.
Can't help myself, guys.
I can't help myself.
If I see stairs, I just wanna, like,
run.
And I'm going the wrong way as well.
Wrong way, I think.
Ah, darn it.
That is like somebody's hose or something.
Oh my God.
Do you hear that, guys?
I'm gonna get soaked.
So,
I did pack the essentials.
Guys, I've packed the essentials just in case.
The essentials when you go hiking.
You need
a poncho.
That's a
Thailand 7-Eleven,
like, 20 Baht poncho right there.
A plastic sheet, basically.
So, I've got one of them.
Also in the bag is
a can of
Coke Zero Vanilla flavoured.
And 2 GoPro batteries.
And that is it.
That is,
that is the essentials, guys.
GoPro batteries, Coke Zero,
and a wee poncho
for when it rains.
But,
aye, good. This is meant to be a short one.
Apparently half an hour
to the top.
It doesn't even look like that.
I don't even see it getting any higher than here.
I think this is just basically a
another tourist spot.
You know, the swings and all that.
Get your Instagram shots.
Probably not much hiking required.
We'll see.
Gonna have a wee sit down here though and enjoy the Coke Z.
Ah, yes.
Yes indeed.
Mmm.
Lovely.
Rewarding myself with refreshment.
I haven't even started the hike.
I would normally keep it until I got to the peak or something, but
like I say, it doesn't even seem like it's gonna be
much of a challenge, so
just consume it now, shall I?
Mmm.
Lovely.
I haven't had a good swing ride like that for
quite a few years, guys.
Quite a few years.
Enjoyed that.
Right,
what's up here? I think that's where the trail goes.
Over here.
More spots where it would be nice to, you know,
take your Instagram shots.
Perched up there,
taking your selfies and that.
I think,
on the other side of this, would be a great view.
But it's just, we're in a cloud.
As always, in Baguio,
there's never been completely clear weather since I got here.
You're just up so high that you're
in the clouds all the time.
Maybe if you came here at like 6 AM or something,
first thing, for sunrise,
you'd get the
amazing view.
I'm too lazy to wake up
at 6 am.
I can barely make it for the breakfast,
which ends at 10 am.
Which is,
actually, kinda garbage at my hotel.
The breakfast ain't that,
ain't that good
at all.
And
looks like got a family having a picnic here.
Hi.
- Hello.
Oh, they've come up here to enjoy McDonald's.
Okay, good.
I follow you on Facebook. You're Dale Philips, right?
- Really?
Yeah, I'm Dale Philip. Hi.
Hello.
- I just came...
Hello. How are you?
Are you enjoying your McDonald's?
- Yes.
Okay, you got a McFlurry.
Or a sundae.
Okay, nice.
Okay, how is the view looking?
Oh, it's not too bad.
Let's see.
Let's try not to slip,
here.
The view.
That's not too bad at all. Look at this.
Look at this valley down there.
The mountains.
Beautiful.
Listen to how quiet it is.
Just hear a few dogs barking.
Some chickens and stuff.
Lovely. Okay, I'll make my way,
further on the trail, so I don't disturb this
lovely family.
Enjoy, guys. See you.
Bye bye.
Okay.
Is there more of a trail here or not?
I think this is just the top.
There's no trail down there, no?
Just here and back?
Ah, okay.
Yeah, I think that's,
that's basically
Unless there's something down here. Yeah that's
basically it. So I had read that
the whole trail was like an hour.
Like,
Somebody said it took them 30 minutes to get to the top
and 20 minutes back down. Well that took me,
if you're excluding the swing ride,
that took me like 3 minutes.
3 minutes to get to the top, here.
Maybe they were talking about that road.
You know, that road that they had to hike up.
Maybe that was the hike for them, but
yeah,
this is interesting.
Sometimes see this at Buddhist places,
where they stack the rocks.
And somebody's lit a
a little bonfire or something next to it.
I wonder if that was some kinda religious thing.
Somebody came up to do some kinda
religious thing up here.
Okay.
Let's ruin everybody's stories.
Hi, guys.
Okay.
Eh, yeah.
Nothing else up here.
I'm gonna go and check out this rock formation down there then.
Now I've got a tough choice, guys. There's
paper to the left and plastic to the right.
I've got aluminium.
So where does that go then?
I dunno, paper or plastic?
I'm gonna leave it here.
'cause it doesn't meet
either category.
Okay.
Rock formation.
Ah, they do overnight stays, here.
Cabin rooms.
And you can have a bonfire as well, for an extra 200.
Doesn't say how much the rooms are though.
But I guess it's these,
right here, these kinda
cabins, you can stay overnight in them.
Oh, and have the bonfire there, I guess.
It's nice.
- Hello.
Hi, how are you?
- Fine.
Okay, they have a big 'ol meal.
Okay, good.
Enjoy, enjoy.
Ah, so this is the
the rocky mountain here.
There's toilets. I'm gonna make use of them.
Right here.
I was actually looking for somewhere up there that might be
private.
Usually when you're doing a hike,
you don't need to find an actual toilet, do you?
But,
yeah, okay, I'm gonna use this.
Refreshed.
Refreshed, guys.
Now, this isn't really a trail, it's just
this rocks where you can, again,
it's just suitable, really, for
taking your Instagram shots, I guess.
But there is a nice view here.
And more swings.
I'll have another swing ride.
That's what I'll do, guys.
I'll have another swing ride.
Okay.
That's the best thing about this place so far,
the swings.
Ah, some rock climbing required.
Actually have to climb to get through this bit.
You guys going?
Yeah, you can go ahead.
Oh, you want me to go first? Okay.
Let's try it.
Pull myself up.
One here.
There we go.
Yeah, it is proper rock climbing
that you need to do to get up here.
Proper, proper.
Fortunately I came here in the right footwear.
Oh!
She just slipped. Are you okay?
Okay, yeah?
Okay. I've got the right footwear on.
I got these in Indonesia. Eiger.
My
trusty North Face hiking shoes
finally wore out when I was on the Indonesia trip.
Then I
got these
from the Eiger store.
It's like a local
Indonesian brand that's kinda like North Face,
but it's a lot cheaper.
I think these were only like,
like $40 or $50,
if I remember correctly.
Okay, this is a dangerous bit.
I've gotta step over,
here.
Okay.
No problem.
The problem is,
camera is in one hand so I only have one other hand,
to like balance myself and stuff.
Okay.
I'm trying to think which way I should go.
I think this way.
I think it's this way, yeah.
This way, yeah?
Yeah, I think this is gonna be the best way.
Okay.
It's
way more challenging than I thought.
Compared to that hiking trail.
I thought because the hiking trail was so easy,
this would just be like another
another walk in the park.
But,
hey, this is,
this is pretty dangerous actually.
Okay.
Dangerous.
- Yeah.
He is able to do it?
- Yeah.
Are you helping him?
- Of course.
Okay, of course.
Sense of adventure.
Nothing like it.
- Oh, wow.
Yeah, it's good.
Look at that.
Wow, I...
- Some sharp rocks though.
Yeah, yeah I gotta be careful.
If there was something like this in the UK,
they just wouldn't let you...
Unless it was in,
unless it was in nature,
they just wouldn't let you come here without
I dunno, signing a waiver and
I dunno, they probably wouldn't let kids
do that either.
But check this out. This is nice.
This was worth risking our lives for, wasn't it,
on those sharp rocks.
Check this out.
And not too many people here,
either.
Fantastic.
Look at the view you get from here,
guys.
The best view.
Oh my word.
Yeah.
Okay, let's have a look from here.
Check it out, guys.
The view of this valley down there.
Lovely.
Oh wow, guys.
There's an actual
cafe up here.
How did they get the stock up and down?
Did they have to do rock climbing
or is there another way?
I think, actually, they've got a wee
path down there.
Maybe it's just for them.
Maybe,
maybe the visitors have to do it the dangerous way,
and they get to just go down this wee
you know,
trail here.
Plenty of people.
Hi.
They've got a wee balcony as well.
Hello.
- Hello, sir.
Oh, look at this. It's beautiful.
This is the best view, right here.
That's all farmland down there,
in the valley.
Very nice.
I dunno where Baguio city is.
Where is the main city, Baguio?
Baguio.
- It's that way?
Ah, on the other side.
That's why it doesn't look recognisable to me at all.
This view. Compared to,
you know, I've been looking out from my balcony every day.
None of this looks recognisable,
but it's away on the other side.
This is
somewhere totally different.
It looks like there's some kinda
athletics track there.
Maybe for a university or something.
And a lot of farmland.
This is the only flat part of Baguio that I've seen so far.
Another viewpoint there.
Very nice.
Matcha green tea frappe.
Ah, okay, good.
Can I,
can I take it out to the balcony?
Ah, okay, good.
Say again.
- What name?
Dale.
Dale. I'll just call you when it's done, sir.
- Oh, okay.
You want me to pay now or when I collect?
- You can pay later.
Oh, pay later? Oh, okay.
Okay, thank you so much.
- You're welcome po.
Thank you.
Okay.
Got a nice matcha green tea
to enjoy this
beautiful green view with.
Fantastic.
And they've given me a wee matcha green tea Pocky,
inside, to stir it up with.
They've also given me a paper straw, guys.
A paper straw.
I'm gonna have to drink this quickly.
If you are given a paper straw
to drink something like this with,
2 minutes, it's soggy, it's a soggy mess.
It's gotta be done quickly.
I'm just standing here, ruining people's,
people's Instagram shots.
With brain freeze.
I tried to drink this so quickly, I got brain freeze.
So I'm just like,
I'm stunned right now.
I'm trying to drink it quickly before the
straw disintegrates.
I think that's it, already.
Oh, wow, I demolished that.
It's just all the cream that's left.
I need a spoon or something to eat that.
But,
yeah,
success.
That's how you have to do it if you get the ol' paper straw.
Where are you from?
I'm from Scotland.
Oh, I thought you were from Australia.
- Why?
I'm really bad. I thought, your accent.
Yeah, I thought you were from America.
Oh, close, Canada.
Yeah, I know.
I'm trolling you because
you got my one wrong, so
I deliberately got your one wrong.
Good.
Okay.
Okay, it's a good photo.
Mount Kalugong.
Okay, thank you.
It was nice.
Okay, I'm gonna see if I can
get down
this trail here. Yeah.
Looks like this is
a wee path down,
that's gonna be a lot easier than
the
way that I got here.
Ah, good.
Look at this. They've made
steps out of old car tyres
and filled them with cement.
That's nice, isn't it.
That's the way to do it.
Hi doggie.
You're like a wee polar bear, aren't you?
They surely get a lot of exercise coming
up and down these steps.
And back here.
The easy way.
So,
I did the difficult way there.
The easy way back.
To this actual place from Baguio,
I took the easy way there with the taxi.
Now I'm gonna take the difficult way back.
I'm gonna walk down that big hill
and then try and find a jeepney.
I'm not gonna go to that 'To the Moon' place
because I could see it from that cafe.
It's like a crescent moon
made from, like
plastic or something.
And people just kinda like sit in it
and use it as like a
another Instagram
shot, place.
But,
yeah, I'm done here.
Gonna make my way out. See you, guys.
Bye.
- Bye bye.
And somehow...
I'm jogging, not because I want to be jogging.
I'm jogging because look how steep the,
the hill is.
Somehow, guys, I managed to stay dry.
I was almost certain that,
I was almost certain that I was gonna get soaked,
when I was up there, and it's still thundering.
It's still thundering but
it hasn't rained yet, so hopefully
I can find a jeepney
before,
before it does start, if it does start.
So right at the bottom of the hill, there is a jeepney,
but it's going this way.
I'm assuming any jeepney going that way
is pretty much going into Baguio, so...
I see there's one right there.
In fact, there's always jeepneys, aren't there? So...
Like some of them have the destination written on them.
That one said "Baguio."
I need to get across the road,
first.
Going to Baguio.
Are you going to Baguio?
- Yes.
Okay, I will jump in.
Okay, good.
That's good.
And this one's empty. Every
every jeepney I see
is
always full.
Do I pay him after?
I pay him now or pay him after, money?
I pay you now or at the end?
It's up to you, sir.
Oh, it's up to me? Ah, okay, I'll pay you now then.
Then it's easier.
That's the fare rate.
How much is it?
17.
17?
Ah, okay, so it's depending on the distance.
- Yes.
Or the kilometres.
Okay, so
we must be going about
7 kilometres, so it's 17.
Okay.
Your blog?
Dale Philip.
- Dale Philip?
Yeah, okay, we're getting
new subscriber from the jeepney driver.
That's good.
Okay, I will, I will.
You will? Okay, good.
So 17 pesos.
That's like 10% of what the taxi ride was there.
The taxi ride was 175,
so it's like 10%
for the jeepney ride, and
we;re getting the jeepney ride in comfort.
Look at this. Nice and empty.
Like I said, every time I've seen jeepneys so far,
they've always been absolutely packed.
Okay boss, that's 17.
There you go.
Okay.
- Thank you.
No worries.
He's actually,
he's actually serious about subscribing.
He's given me a,
a pen and paper, here.
That's good.
Okay, there you are, brother. Thank you, so much.
Dale Philip.
Ah, okay, and people can sit in here as well?
They can get the passenger side.
That's good.
Friendly style.
Next time I'm gonna sit beside the driver.
That's, yeah, good.
I didn't know you could do that.
I thought you always had to sit in the back.
Ah, okay. Next time I'm doing that.
Yeah.
- Yeah.
Shotgun. Call it shotgun.
You are the owner of the jeepney?
Yes, sir.
Ah, okay, so you're the owner and the driver?
Ah, okay. So it's like a personal business.
Ah, okay.
Most people seem to be paying,
most people seem to be paying when they get on.
So I've learned the system.
It's good.
I'll be taking these more often.
If I know the route.
They usually have, like, the
the destination they're going to on the front.
Yeah.
And I think people just flag them down and then they stop.
Like this girl, right here.
Hi.
The driver has to multitask.
He kinda has to drive and deal with the money
at the same time.
It's not like the...
Some, like, buses
that I was taking in Sri Lanka,
the public buses,
they would have a conductor.
They would have a conductor who would deal with the money.
Okay, I'll take the money.
Okay, it's mine now.
Okay, there you go.
- Thank you.
They would have a conductor who would
deal with the money and the driver would just drive.
This guy does everything himself.
Ah, okay.
So he just told him he wanted to stop.
It's not like a bus where they have pickup points and drop points.
It's like,
you just tell him, "I want to stop."
Or you just see it passing and you flag it down.
You can't do that with buses,
in most places anyway.
You can't do that in Scotland.
If you try and flag a bus down between stops,
it won't stop for you.
And generally they won't let you off between stops either.
Unless it's in like the really, really rural areas,
where they're a bit more friendly and relaxed,
but in the cities, no.
It's like too rigid with the stops.
But here it's like,
you just see it, you flag it, and it's good.
Nice casual system.
And how old is your vehicle?
20 years.
20 years?
- Yes.
How long will it last?
I don't know if the government,
if the government will
phase...
You think the government are going to, like, phase this kind of transport out?
They are planning to remove us from the streets.
Really, all the jeepneys?
- Yes.
Why?
They are going to modernise.
They will use modern electric buses or something instead?
Maybe.
- Something like that?
Ah, okay.
- They make electric bus.
Electric bus? Okay.
But you think this will happen in like 1 year, 2 years?
Maybe 3 to 4 years.
In 3 to 4 years, you think?
Ah, okay.
Wow.
So,
he's saying the government are,
they've got plans to phase these out,
replace them with some, kinda like, clean energy,
maybe government vehicles or something.
Just now, these are all privately owned.
And, like,
each one of these jeepney drivers is like a,
an individual business owner, basically.
Just like an independent taxi driver, except
you know they're picking up
multiple people
on a set route and
yeah, local people, they
rely on these
for a cheap, easy way to get around.
So,
yeah, I dunno if that's ever gonna happen,
like, they're really gonna do that,
try and phase out the jeepneys or not, but
yeah, for now, they're just kinda essential for the local people here.
So,
when somebody new gets on, they pass the money up,
like this.
That's how they do it.
And I'm passing the money back
to him,
and then it goes like that.
Look, all the way to the end.
That's the system.
Now we're full, or almost full.
Okay, this is the terminal.
Yes.
- This is where you're stopping.
Oh, and he's gonna subscribe to me before I get off.
Okay, let's make sure we get the subscription.
Wait, I don't have.
I don't have data, maybe.
- Yeah, that's me, yeah, Dale Philip.
Yeah, subscribe.
Okay.
Thank you, brother. Thank you, so much.
- Okay.
Okay, that was good.
I dunno where we are, guys.
Let's see if I can
get out and
see if I can recognise this place.
I don't know where we are at all.
I'm gonna have to see where I am
on Google Maps.
But, I'm definitely most of the way back,
at least.
We were in that jeepney for about half an hour.
Ah, okay.
So we're only about 5 minutes walk away from the park.
My hotel's on the other side of the park
to where we've been dropped off, but
yeah, that was good.
I can manage now with my two strong legs.
The strong jeepney
got me most of the way to
where I want to be.
fantastic, guys.
And I will finish this vlog,
back where I started it.
Up this hill, at the big mall.
Guys, I'm gonna get myself a late lunch up there.
And that will be
this epic vlog,
this nice, wee
adventure in Baguio.
I was
maybe gonna show you guys the night market that they have here,
every night from
9 pm onwards.
I actually checked it out a couple of nights ago when
I wasn't vlogging, but
to be honest, it's not that great.
The food options there weren't that great,
and then they've got a kinda cool
market area where they sell second hand clothes,
second hand Nike shoes
that they've kinda like refurbished and stuff.
But it was so busy.
It was so packed with people
that you're just kinda like walking like this.
With people right in front of you, behind you.
It wasn't comfortable to like walk around and browse.
I can't imagine how I would vlog there.
I wouldn't even be able to
Stick my arm out, guys,
to hold the camera. So,
yeah, I'm gonna skip the night market for this vlog
and we'll end it with a wee bite
up at the mall.
There's actually a lot of food options here,
in the food court.
Sizzling steaks, a Pad Thai,
loads of good stuff.
Oh, that ramen place.
I was eating there when I was in Indonesia.
That's a good chain of
ramen, but
it's all a bit crowded and stuff.
I'd rather be in some, like, individual, quiet restaurant.
So I think those
are upstairs.
And that
is all the people waiting for a taxi.
Since it's raining outside,
there is a massive queue for a taxi.
I will definitely be walking, regardless,
regardless if it's raining or not,
ill just be walking back.
But
where are the food options, guys?
Where are the food options?
This looks good.
It's like a Japanese ramen restaurant.
I don't recognise the brand at all, but
they've got a nice balcony area right here.
What looks like it's gonna be a nice place to sit.
Yes indeed.
Okay, that's where I'm going, guys.
Ramen Nagi.
Yes, sir?
Hi, I want a table for one, please.
Table for one.
- Yes, to eat ramen.
So I just write my order on this?
Yes.
- Okay.
Can I get the balcony?
Yeah, here. Yeah, that's good.
So they've got an indoor section there.
And then
this open air.
I'm liking the open air.
Usually I would be indoors,
soaking up the AC, guys, but
not in Baguio.
Circle which one of ramen, sir.
Okay.
- And you customise the soup base.
So everything gets customised?
- Yes, sir.
The soup base.
- For richness of taste, sir,
that's the saltiness of ramen.
The saltiness? Ah, okay.
For the special sauce, that's the thickness of flavour.
Thickness of flavour? Okay.
- That's the amount of garlic.
Garlic.
Pork, we have shoulder or belly.
Uhuh.
For vegetable we have onion and cabbage.
What level of spiciness do you want, sir?
Ah.
Okay.
- Then, what noodles. Thin or thick.
And then the dullness of noodles.
- Oh, wow.
So much customisation.
There's like...
- For the first time, sir,
you can take chef's recommendation,
that's a standard take.
Ah, okay, so I would just circle one
and then just take the chef's recommendation?
- Ah, yes. Yes.
Ah, okay.
Well, I think...
For the 'Limited King,' sir, that's our special product.
This is the...? Oh, it's oyster.
- We have Oyster King.
Ah, yeah.
- Ah, okay.
I don't think I want that. I think I want pork.
You want pork?
- Yes.
So they're all pork?
Eh, they are all pork bases.
Ah, okay.
But we have different.
Like here, sir.
For the Butao King, sir,
that's our original.
Red King is our spicy version.
Yeah.
This is looking good.
- Yes, sir.
Black King is squid ink ramen, sir.
It's sweetened ramen?
Squid ink.
It's squid ink ramen. That's why it's black?
Okay.
For Green King, sir, that's Italian style pesto basil.
Italian pesto?
Ah, okay.
I think I'm gonna go for the original one.
That looks good.
The Butao King.
Yes, sir you can ????
- Okay, so I circle that.
And write your name sir.
After you finish, you...
And give you this?
Okay, thank you so much.
- I will be right back, sir.
Girlie. That's your name?
- Yes, sir.
Okay, it's a girl called girlie.
Okay.
Okay, let's customise this.
Okay, so I think I want light saltiness.
Special sauce, I'll just go for normal.
Garlic, normal.
And pork, shoulder or belly?
Hmm, well belly is normally fattier
and shoulder is meatier.
I think I'll go for shoulder.
And vegetables, we can get green onion or cabbage.
I'm gonna go for green onion.
Spiciness, we'll go for a 2.
Just enough to give it a bit of a kick.
It's 1-5
but there's also a 6-10
that you can tick there.
So, they're saying, "On your first visit we suggest 1"
"for standard ramen."
And 2 is... Oh, wow.
2 is actually double of 1.
Okay, well I've circled it already,
so that's it done.
And the noodles, you can choose
how thin and how soft.
So it's thin or thick.
And then... I think I want thick
and
normal.
Yeah.
And you can add different stuff like egg,
tamago.
I think I'll add egg.
And
what else would be good to add?
I think that's bacon, right there.
No, it's just different parts of pork.
I think it's fine as it is.
They've got beers, sodas.
So I'm gonna circle a Coke Zero,
right there.
And
give them my name.
And then I will be looking forward to
nice nice bowl of pork broth.
Hi.
I've customised everything.
So it's a Coke Zero, there, for the drink.
I'll just repeat your order, Sir Dale.
- Okay. Yes.
You ordered Butao King, sir,
shoulder, green onion for toppings.
That's Level 2 spicy.
- Yeah.
Thick noodles for...
And you have extra tamago (egg)
then one Coke Zero for drink.
- Yes.
Do you have any additional order sir?
- Okay.
No, that's fine.
Is there side dishes?
Oh yeah, there's like gyozas and
chicken karaage.
Gyozas are our best seller for side dish.
Ah, okay.
I will just eat the ramen first,
then if I need more, I will ask for more.
Okay.
Yeah, loads of good stuff here.
- Just a reminder, sir.
No takeout for the ramen, even leftovers.
10 - 15 minutes serving time.
10 - 15 minutes?
- Yes.
Okay, thank you John.
Excuse me, sir.
If you have any additional order, just call.
- Thank you.
Okay, thank you.
- Excuse me.
Okay.
So 10 - 15 minutes.
Everything made fresh, that's good.
That's how you know
you're getting something good.
When you order something that comes straight away,
it was already pre-prepared.
But this, fully customised and everything made fresh.
Good.
Mr Dale.
- Hi.
Okay.
That's my ramen.
It looks beautiful. Thank you so much.
Enjoy your ramen while it's hot, sir.
Okay.
This looks absolutely beautiful, guys.
Absolutely beautiful.
This creamy,
creamy broth, right here.
Look at this.
Wow.
We've got the thin slices of pork shoulder.
Very meaty.
So it was a choice between shoulder or belly.
The belly would have been more fatty than this.
We've got the egg that I added.
A full...
I think it's... Oh, yeah.
It's like a semi boiled egg.
As you can see, the yolk is a bit soft, right there.
So I'm gonna break that up.
That's gonna be lovely.
I always like a,
a nice egg
with my ramen.
And,
yeah guys, let's mix it up a bit.
There are some extra condiments you can add,
like this umami vinegar,
sesame seeds.
I believe this is,
yes, it's chili powder.
I think, some kinda like pickled stuff,
as well, but
you know what?
I think this is gonna be delicious
on its own.
So,
let's try the noodles,
let's try the noodles first.
Hwo!
Hwo hot.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Oh, yeah.
These thick noodles,
just the right texture.
A wee bit soft,
a wee bit chewy but not too much.
So, that was,
I think there was like 5 choices between
hard and soft
and with the thick ones you couldn't choose soft,
it was just normal, so
yeah, these are like perfect
ramen noodles.
And I can taste the broth of the noodles already.
It's very creamy, very creamy, guys,
And
they've given me a spoon, so
I'm gonna take a,
a good ol' slurp of the broth,
after another mouthful of the noodles.
Mmm!
And I'm not slurping them enough.
You need to slurp,
you need to make that slurping noise.
That's what they taught me when I was in Tokyo for the first time,
in the ramen restaurants there.
They were saying you need to
make that noise that lets the chef know that you're,
you're really enjoying it.
And lets see if I enjoy this broth.
Oh, wow.
Oh, it's nice.
I can't describe the taste,
other than it's very creamy.
You can see that kinda yellowy,
that yellowy colour,
it's just a very,
so rich in flavour as well,
so rich in flavour.
I think here was an option on the customisation about richness,
and that was about how salty it was.
It tastes salty.
I've got the lightest version of the saltiness
and it tastes salty.
Mmm.
Tastes very fatty as well.
As you can see,
there's a lot of, like,
oiliness on the top, there.
It looks a bit oily. That's because
it's oily.
It's a very fatty,
fatty, creamy broth.
Mmm.
Now, the meat itself.
Very lean.
Like I said, it's very lean
cuts of pork.
Mmm.
Tasty, yeah.
It tastes very lean as well.
Like I said, the broth's very fatty, so
they compliment each other, actuality.
If you got the,
if you got the pork belly,
maybe you'd think you'd just be eating, like,
pure fat, you know, but
that's a good balance, the
the pork shoulder and the
the creamy broth
and the delicious
noodles, right here.
Cleared the bowl.
So satisfying.
So satisfying, guys.
Okay, it's
657.
Okay.
- I received 1,000 from you.
Okay.
So 657,
that is like,
it's like, maybe $11 or something.
Probably as much as you would pay
if you went to some kinda local ramen shop in
Japan or whatever.
This was classy ramen.
Nice and classy.
Sitting right here on the balcony area,
in the fresh air.
Very much enjoyed that.
Dale Philip.
Dale Philip.
- Yeah.
Okay, sir.
- On YouTube and Facebook.
We will be following you.
- Oh, really?
Thank you, Ronnie, thank you so much.
- Okay, sir.
Okay.
So the ramen staff are gonna follow me.
- Dale Philip?
Yeah, Dale.
Dale Philip. Okay.
That's good.
I like that.
I get some value for my
actually, I think like $12.
I get some value for my $12.
I get the ramen and I get some new subscribers.
It's all good.
And a cheeky wee
bubble tea, for the road, guys.
I'm ending the vlog,
right where I started,
here on the Sky Terrace.
Lovely.
And do let me know, guys,
if you watched this vlog all the way through without skipping,
because
I want to know who the legends are.
But,
I've got another couple of days in Baguio,
that I'm just gonna spend to myself. I won't be vlogging.
And then I'll be going somewhere else
in the Philippines.
I don't have plans yet.
I did have a flight booked
to Cebu.
There's an actual airport here,
with like 3 or 4 flights a week, only to Cebu.
And that's how I was gonna do it, but
Philippines Air, or
Air Philippines, whatever they call themselves,
they just canceled my flight.
Just like that, just canceled my flight, so
hey, I guess I'm,
I guess I'm rearranging my plans.
Fortunately, I hadn't booked a hotel yet, in Cebu, so
there's that. But,
yeah, I guess I'm taking a bus back to Manila
and then either taking a plane straight to somewhere
else, that I haven't decided yet,
or maybe I'll stay in Manila a couple of days.
Maybe I'll pick up that football shirt
from the Azkals
and do something else in Manila.
Maybe I'll stay in a different area
than I stayed last time, in Makati.
The first time I came to Manila,
like 7 years ago...
I was actually just there for a visa run,
from Thailand.
I was just there to visit the Thai embassy.
I stayed in
Malate, it was called,
and it was more of a local area.
Lots of street food and stuff.
I enjoyed that area a lot more than I did
Makati.
Makati's nice, it's just...
It's comfortable, it's nice. It's just a bit boring, to be honest.
The real,
the real life was in Malate.
So I'll either stay there, or maybe just some
random
other city
in the Manila metropolis.
Because Manila is kinda like a metropolis,
it's like different
cities within
the metropolis, you know.
So, like Quezon or something like that.
Maybe I'll find one of those places and stay there
and check that out.
Or maybe I'll skip Manila entirely and just go
straight to somewhere else.
I'll figure that out
later, guys, when I go back to my hotel, there.
Gonna wander there now with my
bubble tea, so
yeah, I'm gonna enjoy the rest of my time here in Baguio,
make plans for
the next destination
and I will see you there
on the next adventure, guys.
You know what?
Am I missing something, guys?
Look at me.
Do I look like I'm missing something right now?
Where's my Ducati bag?
Where the heck is my Ducati bag?
Did I have it when I went to my ramen place?
I think I did.
Let's go to the ramen place and try and get back my
Ducati bag.
Let's see.
Well my table hasn't been taken by anybody else.
I left my bag.
Your bag, sir.
- Yeah, I left my bag.
Did you collect it?
Yes.
- Ah, okay.
Luckily I remembered before I,
before I went back.
Okay, they've put it away safe for me.
Okay, you got it?
Okay, thank you so much for taking care of it.
Thank you.
Okay, cheers.
Okay.
Mmm.
All's well
that ends well, guys.
See you next time.
