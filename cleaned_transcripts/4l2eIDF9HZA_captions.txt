we have some beautiful shrimps here frozen these 
are frozen but we will turn these into a really  
nice japanese tempura so we're gonna make 
them very crispy light tasty full of flavor  
and of course we're gonna combine it with some 
filipino-style food i wonder if you use these  
kind of shrimps in the philippines frozen so 
for now we're gonna just put some water here  
of course you can also use a fresh shrimp 
for this one and just leave it for a bit  
tempura is such an amazing dish from japan and 
it's also very easy to make therefore today i  
will show you how to make this masarap na hipon 
the japanese way and you can also do this very  
easily in the philippines of course so when i will 
be able to go back to the philippines i might be  
able to cook this in your barangay let's hope so 
diba the last time i made aussie pie thank you  
so much for all your comments and it was really 
nice to making the aussie pie for the first time  
australian meat pie and i combined it with potato 
salad pinoy style potato salad it was really  
nice to try and if you have not seen the video 
yet i'll put a link for you in the description  
i'm now drinking this lemon juice and this is 
actually pure lemon so it's not only the lemon  
juice from inside but it includes the peel the 
white and the yellow inside outside as well as the  
seeds i just put the whole lemon it's very ma'asim 
like a hundred times more ma'asim than sinigang
but i think it's a it has a lot of vitamin c so i 
drink it just to stay strong you know so the way i  
prepare the shrimps usually for tempura is just i 
take off the ice and then put them on a chopping  
board then i take the sharp japanese knife and 
just take the shrimp like this and then carefully  
make some cuts on the inside okay very careful 
of course because this knife is really sharp  
not too deep and just a few and in this way uh 
what will happen is the shrimp can become straight  
instead of curly you know so later it will be 
straight like that you can then also clean the  
shrimp on the inside i know not everybody does it 
but i always prefer the shrimp to be really clean  
and then just put them on a paper towel like 
that now it's time to prepare the batter okay  
so i'm using a tempura mix here this 
is a high quality tempura mix bud  
that being said if you don't have this tempura 
mixture what you can do is you can also  
just uh get a cake flower you know i would not 
recommend the all-purpose flour or bread flour  
but if you have a cake flour something with a low 
protein you can also use that in the philippines  
one more thing about the shrimp once you made 
the cuts in the belly side you can actually  
crack you can crack the the shrimp a little bit 
backwards you hear you will hear that sound like  
and then they become straight like this see 
now the uh batter we can use two chopsticks  
okay so you can just add some water and then 
mix it a little bit don't over mix it if you  
don't have chopsticks you can also use a whisk 
but make sure not to over mix it okay but first  
let's prepare some filipino food of course 
because we're gonna combine it later i will  
make a sinangag but first i'll make a sisig 
okay and this is mackerel i never tried to make  
a sisig with mackerel and today i want to give 
it a try frying pan konting mantika yung bawang
let the bawang get brown a little bit so i got the 
fish here and i was thinking to remove the skin  
um because that might be easier for the fish to be 
chopped might be syang i'm not sure yeah you know  
what i think it's syang right to throw away the 
skin it has a lot of nutrients let's include that  
the skin a little bit in the oil with the 
garlic and then let's add the remaining fish
now i made lots of different sisig types i made 
a pork sisig and chicken sisig even i made a  
tuna sisig and salmon sisig before but i think 
like i said this is the first time that i'm making  
the mackerel sisig making it a little bit flaky 
now now let us add lemon juice i like to add quite  
a bit to make it more maasim sisig is so easy 
to make so we're almost finished with this one  
and then it's time to fry our tempura shrimps 
hopefully sometime soon again i can go to a  
filipino restaurant because they're almost gonna 
open so i might try one um in the coming weeks or  
so and make a nice vlog there there was already 
a lot of black pepper and salt on the fish so  
i'm not gonna add black pepper or salt let's set 
aside the seasick for now like i said we're just  
gonna put a little bit of water and mix it with 
the chopsticks another thing is that the water  
should be really cold okay try to use the 
coldest water you have now don't worry if  
there's a couple of lumps left in the batter 
that's perfectly fine with tempura all you  
need to do is just put the shrimp in one side the 
other side just like that so that it's covered in  
better and the end you don't need to put just hold 
it like that okay you like masarap na hipon tested  
if the oil is hot enough so now let's put in the 
shrimp don't put too many at once especially if  
it's a small pan like this i'm just doing three 
or four ah they start to make those crispy sounds
look at that tempura so once they are done you 
put them on a paper towel and they are super  
crispy already now in terms of the dipping sauce 
it is very simple what you can do you can just put  
a certain amount of soy sauce take a same amount 
of japanese mirin now this is a japanese product  
of course if you don't have mirin in you may 
also use a filipino cane vinegar for example  
similar amount then you add a little bit of sugar 
konting asukal okay not too much just a little bit  
and you finish off with some good old patis in 
japan they often use a katsuobushi salmon flakes  
or something like a not something like a but a 
dashi they use dashi made from kombu the kelp  
but you know the the purpose of that is to 
give the tempura sauce the umami flavor okay  
so i think the patis works fine so you 
can just use a soy sauce a vinegar and  
sugar and also uh patis stir everything and boil 
for about two minutes that's enough it is just to  
get the alcohol out a little bit okay by the 
way if you are waiting for visitors you know  
what you could do with a tempura is also re-fry 
them so you can take them out a little bit sooner  
okay and then as soon as the visitors are coming 
you would just uh refry them again for let's say a  
minute or so just to make them hot and actually 
they will become more crispy now last time it  
was australia this time it is japan now i'm 
already wondering what the next country will be  
but of course you can also put it in the comments 
if you have a specific request now this is very  
nice guys look at this if you're making pinakbet 
or any other vegetable dish what you can do you  
can just use those vegetables for making tempura 
so don't make sayang ah don't make sayang no just  
kidding guys in fact i think that the vegetables 
from pinakbet can really be used well for tempura  
because often in tempura in japanese cuisine 
also those similar vegetables are being used
very good so i made a delicious sinangag 
certainly became a delicious meal see  
with the um tempura spinach and tempura shrimp 
as well as some delicious mackerel sisig
there we go the mackerel sisig is a must try 
it's maanghang but it's very masarap i think  
the combination is really good with the japanese 
tempura and so i hope you liked this episode  
and i'll see you next time with more filipino food
