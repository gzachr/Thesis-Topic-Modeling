hi guys! first of all we just want to
thank our returning subscribers for your
continuous support and to our new
viewers today and new subscribers thank
you so much for watching pinay mom's blogs.
Today we are here in Amstelpark which is on
the south side of the city centre here
in Amsterdam and we've never actually
been to this part before but we are
lucky that today happens to be the
second Sunday of the month and so every
second Sunday they sort of have like
this open market at this park
If you live in the area or somewhere
here in the city this is indeed a must
place for you guys to go to with or
without kids with their open market
weekends it's a great place for you to
discover new products, taste new food or
just enjoy the weather and your
surroundings.
We have spirellos!
One thing that I was curious to try was
this Hungarian fried bread called
lango≈°. This is a classic and your cheese is underneath. Yours is the same
except I have the sour cream as well. The
dough tastes like that of a funnel cake
except that this has grated cheese on
top with sour cream for our Filipino
viewers the closes I could think of is
like the dough of
"maruya" without the banana though. Are there other fried breads back home I'm
not sure let me know at the description
box below.
Another special treat of this park for
our kids is this maze.
I like it! T'was so cool!
In the beginning it was a little scary but em...
it was super fun.
And now we're heading towards the kids
playground they have a lot of options
over here too.
even a petting zoo
