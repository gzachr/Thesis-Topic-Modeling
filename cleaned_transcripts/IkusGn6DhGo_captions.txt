Which stage are they on?
Do you know?
Wow...their voice are melodious, beautiful, and harmonious...
Oh...Sejun is like wearing earrings...
I really like seeing Stell wears suspenders...
His chest looks broad...
Very good...
Evidently, Ken's voice is soft and melodious...
Seen here guys...
I really love their style here...
Really...really...love...
Among all the videos I watched, I love their style the most here...
The top is grey and under is black...
Very suitable for them...
What motif is that?
The motif of the clothes they wear...
Like a round shape, but I don't know...
Here I focus more on Ken because evidently his voice is soft and melodious you know ...
Usually I only pay attention to...
but here I like Ken's voice when singing this song...
My goodness...Their voice...
Handsome, good at dancing, evidently their voice are melodious...
and their voice can come together...harmonious...
Really unified...
Sometimes there are boy groups whose voice breaks when singing, but they don't...
Their voice can come together...
Supposing that I can meet them directly...
Watching their concert live...
Definitely I will bring a photo of Sejun and Stell...
Too bad...The video is a little bit...
Ouch...
Ok, I can conclude...
I really love their song "Hanggang Sa Huli"...
So Soft...
and the way they sing the song really blends in...
Melodious...Really blends in...Harmonious...
and unified...
I also like their style here...
Their clothes...among all the videos I've seen, I like the colour of SB19's clothes here the most...
and I'm here the first time, focus on Ken...
My goodness....I don't think that Ken's voice is so melodious...
Earlier when singing...
Usually I only focus on Stell and Sejun...
They both are my favorite...
but here I focus on Ken...why?
because his voice amazing...so melodious...
Ouch...My goodness...
Their song is soft...really blends in...
Then they sing earlier, it seemed on stage...on which stage was it about? guys...
I really hope to watch SB19's concert...
So I can bring the photo and shout...
