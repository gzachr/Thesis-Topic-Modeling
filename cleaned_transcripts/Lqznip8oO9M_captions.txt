coming in the taxi Taxi's here I love the
taxis on the Philippines but because they
use the taxi meter and they don't try to charge
you more money they just stick to the taxi
meter so definitely this is the best option
to move around when you're in the city well
for the people that don't want to try the
deepness I think that jeepneys are the very
best way to move around because you with the
locals and they're always want to talk to
