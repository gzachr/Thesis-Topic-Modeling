Oh, my God.
It is just the perfect recipe for a good day.
Want some beer?
Sure.
Oh, it's big bottle.
Oh my goodness.
Three Tarzan?
Good morning from Bohol here in the Philippines.
Everybody guys, this look
how gorgeous this place is.
Crystal clear water.
It's just honestly such a vibe, perfect
temperature to be spending the day by the beach.
And that is exactly what we're gonna do
today because I'm staying about 200 meters
up that way at a $200 per night hotel
on there for the next couple of nights.
And I arrived in the, uh, last night.
Uh, it was raining.
It was kind of a little bit miserable.
So I was like, you know what?
We'll wait until the weather is good and boy,
or boy did the weather turn out good today.
This water guys, if you know me, I'm Australian.
I live in Sydney.
I live by the beach and I absolutely
love being by the beaches.
So it is just absolute paradise right
here, right by the beach, uh, the hotel,
super nice room overlooking, uh, the water.
There's a really nice mall next to it.
Uh, they have like kayaking
paddle boarding that you can do.
We can see somebody over there doing
some paddle board and a really cool thing
about this area of the beach is that
right now it's high tide in low tide.
It actually goes like all the way out.
So you can like walk basically to
like where all those boats are.
I don't even know if they would be like in
a couple hours, they're gonna be beached.
So we are gonna be expanding the
day here, enjoying the luxury.
Uh, and we'll bring you all along for the journey.
So Tara na and, uh, join me.
As we explore the luxury hotel here in
Cebu $200 per night and worth every cent.
We got a little photo shoot going on here.
I think for the hotel, I saw them setting
up all the cameras, uh, up at the pool area.
But, uh, man, look at all that we've got a DLSR.
We've got another DLSR, not like five DLSR.
And here I am just with a GoPro, but, uh,
yeah, I think that's to do with the hotel.
But as I was saying, I have like plenty
of kayaks and paddle boards here,
the hotels actually just up there.
Um, but this whole beach area here is
all a private access for the guests.
Here we go.
Kayaks and whatnot.
So we'll definitely take out the kayaks today.
It is damn hot.
I'll tell you that much.
Um, but yeah, the Modala beach resort, this is where
it is and uh, that is where we are heading.
It's honestly like such a beautiful area.
Like right now it's super hot, so
it's perfect time to be swimming.
So we'll head up to the pool.
Um, but in the evening time, when I
arrived here, it's just like so beautiful.
Just walking along here, walking along the strip,
there's a, a big, like, kind of mall area with
like some really nice restaurants and stuff.
But here we go.
This is the entrance.
Oh, the beach front entrance.
Wow wow.
Wow.
Does it get much better than this?
I don't think so.
Look at that.
Palm trees, ocean mountains in the background.
And an infinity pool.
So we're gonna have a quick little
swim to, uh, start the day off
right.
Get all the batteries and phones out.
My feet are super Sandy, so
gonna shower off quickly.
There we go.
Some countries that I've noticed actually
require you to, um, kind of shower
before you actually get in into pools.
But all right, look at this guys.
Beach chairs and whatnot, but.
This is paradise.
Look at this.
Honestly, like I've stayed at some pretty
nice places around the world, but I think an
infinity pool overlooking a beach, like right
here, honestly, like I don't think it can.
There's very few places in the
world that could beat this.
And I'm just super stoked to be staying here
for the next couple of nights on Cebu island.
It, uh, but honestly,
I should be, I should be showing that way.
I shouldn't be showing the view of
my face when there's this beautiful
view of the beach just over there.
Damn.
That is good.
Let's go under.
They also got a bar here for the guests.
Let's see what they have on the menu.
Oh, Hey brother.
Do you have a menu that I could look at please?
Serving all kinds of alcohol drinks.
Perfect.
Thank you.
All right so we got appetizers pizzas sandwiches, which one
is the best cocktail?
You want a sweet cocktail, strong cocktail or?
Yeah, like a sweet cocktail.
Uh, margarita.
All right, I'll have one, uh,
classic margarita, please.
Okay.
You want frozen or, uh.
Yeah, frozen.
Thank you.
Can life get much better than this?
A frozen margarita on the pool in Cebu?
I don't think so.
So, uh, where's margarita
classic margarita, 185.
That is around just under four us dollars.
So actually very affordable for the
price that the menus actually like,
actually that's very cheap for drinks.
Um, the food like sandwiches, beef burger,
that's like 12 us dollars pizza around
like seven us dollars for that one.
Um, it's nice.
All right margarita is in the works.
You can see it there.
All the materials and ingredients are being
added to that one and, uh, a bit of ice.
Oh yeah.
We did ask for frozen.
So that's a cool machine.
That'd definitely chop your fingers
off if you had 'em in the wrong areas.
So let's see.
Oh perfect.
Nothing like a margarita and an infinity
pool on the side of the beach.
You might have to get jet skis later on.
That looks so it's like so much fun.
All right guys, I put two and two together.
It's a wedding.
So I'm guessing the people that I was
filming earlier, the bride, uh, not the
bridesmaid, the best men, the groomsmen, and
there's either a bridesmaid or a, the wife.
Um, so that understands.
Ah, thank you very much, brother.
Amazing little margarita, frozen
margarita here on the, uh, the water.
Get a, a cheeky thumbnail.
Oh, that's good, Marky.
Very delicious.
Thank you.
How good?
You know, sometimes they don't let glasses in
the pool, but these are actually plastic ones.
So no chance of them breaking, but wow,
this is just incredible.
It's actually really nice margarita as well.
Some margaritas have had super, uh,
like they add just so much salt to the
edges, but this is like a nice balance.
And you always gotta go to
the frozen margaritas guys.
You can't be having the normal
margaritas on tropical islands like this.
You gotta get the frozen one
to combat the summer heat.
And guys just look how beautiful
this is the contrast to colors.
It's kinda like white sand to turquoise water.
And then you have the blue water, like
the deep blue, and then the dark blue sky.
It is just the perfect recipe for a good day.
All right guys done at the pool.
When I was walking down here earlier, I
saw her on the right side, little koi pond.
Look at all these guys, big, some big
ones in there as well, but here they're
all like gathering over to the side.
Maybe they think that I'm
gonna feed them or something?
No, I don't have any cheese paratha for you guys.
I'm sorry.
Not here in the Philippines.
Unfortunately.
I can ship them over to you,
maybe like a three day delivery.
So I, yeah, 72 hour wait for that, but this
is, uh, kind of the main lobby area, again,
like just, we're kind of like on the edge of
Cebu, so I'm right near the airport, right?
Like five minute drive from the airport.
So it's kind of just like this one strip
of land that separates that side of the
ocean and also on that side of the ocean.
So you literally have kind of like views
everywhere you go in the water here.
It's just like literally the perfect like
climate, like apparently it's rainy season
right now, yesterday was really the only
kind of rain that I experience so far,
which is just like in the evening time.
But apart from that, like the
weather is still so like goddamn good
here even during the rainy season.
So you gonna head up to the room now and I'll
give you guys a quick little tour of that one.
Uh, pretty nice room.
Good view.
Nice, uh, nice amenities and whatnot,
level five top floor for the king.
And, uh, yeah, let's go into the room, Tara na.
All right guys.
We are back in the room.
So as I was saying, $200 per night to stay at
this place has amazing facilities and everything.
The pool, the beach, absolutely incredible
private beach access for all hotel guests.
But the room is actually really nice room,
as you can expect for paying $200 per night.
So this is kind of like the first, uh, look
in point little bit, uh, oversaturated there.
So you can't see the view, but I'll show you
that in a moment, let's go into the bathroom.
You guys all know how much I absolutely
love the good old bathroom reviews.
Of course, we got the bum gun.
Tell you what I was back in
Australia a couple weeks ago.
And, uh, it is a travesty that we
don't have the bum gun in Australia,
or it's not like normalized.
I don't know.
I don't know what the hell people in Australia, the
us, all those countries, what are you doing?
Adopt the bum gun.
You need the bum gun.
It is the most practical,
efficient thing in the world.
I don't know why Australia doesn't have it.
but fortunately there is one thing
Australia does have, and that is showers,
uh, just like everywhere else in the world.
But these showers here, guys tell you what,
this is actually a very underrated, um, kind
of design here, a shower that gets pushed in.
So a lot of the shower, uh, doors,
they kind of get pushed out and
then they collide with the big door.
So, you know, little, uh, architectural
design there that actually helps
the functioning of the bathroom.
So got our shower gels, the bad glee
Ishka shower, gel conditioner shampoo.
And of course got like a stainless steel.
Um, shower, head, and you all know
how much I love the taps or the
shower heads that come from the floor.
not, not the floor, come the floor,
or we gonna have it down there.
Shouldn't straight up at us.
No.
I mean, from the roof, um, that actually
enables it to simulate a rain forest or some
rain here in the tropical island of Cebu.
So I love that kind of stuff, but more
importantly, guys, I have stayed here for a
night and big statement here, but this could
be the best bum gun I've ever used in my life.
That's why I was, uh, raving
on about it so much earlier.
But look at this, how good is that guys?
Perfect radius, perfect strength.
And it cleans all the areas
that you are in need of.
So 10 out 10 for the bun gun.
I approve.
It is, uh, coming in handy when I need
it the most now heading on in to the
closet here, we've got two bathrobes.
Unfortunately I'm only needing one
at this present point in time, but
they're still there if you need it.
You know, you come back from the beach, you
have a shower, you wanna sit on your balcony.
You don't wanna come in, your singlet.
Or, you know, your, your wet clothes, chop on
your bathrobe and enjoy the, uh, enjoy the view,
which I will show you in at one second time.
Now I checked in yesterday and I slept on that
bed and I left this one perfectly, just so you
guys could see the, uh, the welcome home, uh,
thing made out of, I think, uh, Palm leaves
or Palm tree leaves, something like that.
But now that I've done this
video, I can mess it up.
done.
You're not welcome home anymore, Luke
Uh, but yeah, this is the bed.
Uh, we got two beds there.
Not really sure what the purpose of that is.
I'm only one person and we've got a big couch
here that is actually like recently comfy.
No, it's not.
I thought it was comfortable.
Maybe it's comfortable cause there's
about 10,000 pillows there on it.
Uh, giving us a little bit of cushioning,
but you know, I guess it serves its purpose.
You don't want to be sitting on your bed
all day or sitting in the office chair.
You can, uh, kind of like lounge back a
bit, read your book, uh, watch your Luke
Damant, videos, whatever you want in life.
Um, but yeah, nice little workstation
here with some Molo water.
That's actually the name of the hotel.
Not sponsored, I'm paying full price for this.
And then of course, heading on out to.
The balcony, everybody.
This is where the fun happens.
Nice little drying rack.
There.
It is super hot when you compare this to
the AC room in there, but couple chairs.
Uh, but yeah, I'm glad we got the fifth level.
Cause we get a view.
Of all the water there and all the water
on that side, as well as I was saying this
kind of stripper land, like the airport is
maybe like a couple kilometers that way.
And it's just like this big
strip of land in either side.
It's just like surrounded, uh, with ocean water.
So it's a beautiful view, you know, that's
the, the checkin area, the reception,
there's the koi fish, uh, pond over there.
Uh, and you just sort of enter through there.
Oh, look, a little Jeepney
tricycle tuk tuk combination.
I've never seen one.
That's like fully enclosed.
It's like a tuk tuk,
but on a motorbike wheel.
Interesting.
Um, but yeah, this is the room.
Everybody look out just, it is so beautiful.
I just, I, I just can't get over it.
Honestly.
The Philippines, you just continue to impress me.
It is God gorgeous out here.
So as I was saying, guys, we're
gonna be spending a day here.
Uh, I'll be doing all the activities,
the paddle boarding, the kayaking
we'll explore around the area.
And, uh, yeah, we'll just
bring you along on the journey.
So Tara na let's, uh, play the next clip tara na.
Well, actually just quickly.
I, uh, purposely left these
in here from yesterday.
I didn't wanna try them out,
but there's mini fridge here.
Uh, and there's these kind of
weird, like interesting, uh, juices
of some sort bought a Gatorade.
We'll have to, uh, fill up the mini
fridge later on with some goodies.
There's a 711 down the
road, so we we'll go out there.
Grab some chocolate, grab some, uh, Coke.
Coca-Cola not Coke zero.
We can't be, uh, having that kind of stuff in
the body, even though Dale would not be too happy
with that, but you gotta get the real stuff.
You can't be having Coke and, uh, not having the,
the, the real deal you can't be having zero sugar.
What are we in 2022.
Anyways, I'm gonna try this thing.
It kind of looks like pineapple juice.
Um, looks a little bit fermented at
the bottom now, but we will try it out.
Okie dokey.
Open it up.
I think pineapple.
Oh no, it's not.
It's like it's citrusy and lemony it.
It smells like lemon juice or
orange, maybe a mixture of the two.
Well, it's definitely not orange juice.
I'll tell you that much.
I think it's just mixed fruit, kind of like.
I do not know what this is.
I, I don't know.
it has like a faint, uh, smell and taste of
orange, but it's not like the full flavor
that you get when you have orange juice.
It does taste actually pretty nice though.
So not sure what it is.
Maybe if you're a Filipino watching
this, have you seen anything like this?
Um, here at the Philippines, maybe it's specific
to this hotel, but I like it anyways, as I was
saying, I'm looking out to the beautiful view.
We are going to explore, uh, the rest of
the resort and the nearby surroundings.
Um, so tara na, let's bring you guys all along
with the journey guys again, sorry for the
interruption, but I'm feeling incredibly
sad because I just finished that last clip
about five minutes ago, reviewing the room.
And I just realized I didn't do a bed test.
I feel like I've lied to you guys.
I feel, uh, I feel guilty for not
doing the bed test two beds here.
And your man can't even do one bed test.
So I slept on that bed last night.
I haven't even like touched this bed apart
from smacking the, uh, the big leaves
that were there saying welcome home.
Um, so we'll do one here.
That one, honestly, last night it was okay.
It was pretty hard when I slept on it.
I presume this is the same, maybe.
Um, but yeah, it was like, okay, it was mediocre.
And I, I got rid of the pillows, chucked.
'em over onto the big couch there.
Cuz these pillows, I don't know why
hotels ever add these ugly pillows.
Like just gimme four super soft white pillows.
I don't want this ugly artistic design.
like, what is this color here?
Come on.
Like, what is that?
It looks like you've used fishing line.
That you got from the beach, wrapped
it around a couple of chicken feathers.
And that's your pillow done?
But bed test everybody here in the
Philippines in Sibu $200 per night,
a hotel 3, 2, 1, too hard, too hard.
It is so hard.
Just the exact same as the other one.
Disappointing, to be honest, look like you
can just tell this is a hard bed, right?
Like just like, listen to that.
Look at, listen to that.
Thud.
I don't know.
That's interesting.
I've had some really good beds
here in the Philippines at the
places that I've stayed at there.
It's, it's hard, but the pillows, I
think they make up for it a little bit.
Not as soft as I would like,
but I think you get like two.
Yeah, this one's a little more softer.
This is kind of like the firm one.
And then you have these ones
that completely useless.
So, all right.
I promise now after three interruptions,
That we are going to go and
explore the rest of the area, tara na.
Let's do it.
All right so we're just walking out
of the resort at the moment.
Uh, my room is, uh, which one is it
somewhere on the top floor there.
Uh, but I'm gonna go down to the street
here because you can either access like the
kind of shopping area from the beach front.
Um, but I will actually just
like show you the front entry of.
I think it's at, oh, actually might just be here.
Um, so we'll go in there in a second.
All right, here we go.
The Moadto strip.
I don't have a mask, so I'm not
sure how this is gonna end up.
Hello, morning.
How are you?
Thank you.
Oh, it's not that busy yesterday afternoon.
It was super busy, everybody, I guess.
Right now it's like 11:00 AM.
So things are, uh, slowly, beginning
to open up, but it's actually just like
such a nice modern kind of, uh, area.
It's so beautiful.
It's beautiful grass here.
The hop, skip jump.
But you got so many beautiful restaurants.
There's also like a second floor where
there's some like, uh, beach cafes, some bars
and whatnot, but man, this grass is nice.
Super soft, super nice grass.
So yeah, maybe later tonight we'll either
get some food from here and then bring
it back to the hotel room or we can get
a, uh, a bit of food, uh, in room dining.
But yeah, I think, I think this
is, this has nothing to do.
With the, uh, hotel.
They're not affiliated, I don't believe, or
that may be completely incorrect, cuz this is
actually, oh, I just trot on that black bit.
That is so hot.
I may actually be wrong though,
because this, um, this right here is
actually part of the hotel as well.
That is where I had breakfast this morning.
Is it connected?
No, it is not.
Gee I'm lucky.
I don't have a room over there.
That would be absolutely horrible.
So yeah.
Completely different entities.
We got the hotel room, we got the hotel
establishment and then the Moadto -
Oh it's Moadto strip right towards the beach.
So let's go, uh, Oh, look at that thing.
there's so many just cool, like
little things on this beach.
Let's go check that out.
So again, I don't know if this is public or like,
I think actually this is storm, so which one's
storm, maybe one of the ones up on the roof, but
I know that area is specifically for, uh, here.
You can see there's a sign there exclusive
for Modala guests only, but look at this, a
USA army truck or something that is so sick.
Wonder if we're allowed in, I guess so.
Ah, where are the keys mate?
Honk honk.
This is actually so cool.
Look at all the gears four drive low drive.
We've got a couple of masks,
down there.
How many kilometers?
Only 50,000 kilometers.
Oh my God.
That is crazy.
That is so sick.
I don't know if it is like a souvenir
or what actually, what is the purpose of
this, but either way, it looks super cool.
As I was saying earlier in the day, though,
guys, yesterday evening, this was just like
all sand for like, like a hundred meters.
So the tides here of like the depth of the
ocean on the bank is just like, it's all flat.
So when the tide does come in, it's
like super, super low and super high.
Oh, that's so gorgeous.
Just literally clear water.
You can see it all the way through.
It's crazy.
Hello, where can I get a towel from?
Oh, he's oh, he's bringing some.
Oh, what else you got?
Jet skis.
Horseback riding.
Oh, you have horses?
Yeah.
Where are they?
They're here.
There.
Ah, how much does it cost?
One thousand five hundred.
Oh, that's good price.
It'll be criminal.
Uh, not to get a horse later this evening.
Maybe you can do it in high tide
or you have to wait till low tide,
Yeah.
Yeah, you can do any time?
Only for low tide sir.
So this afternoon.
Okay.
Maybe we'll do that.
So many cool things, but the, the
paddle boarding and kayaking is free.
Yeah.
Okay, perfect.
Maybe I'll I'll wait over at the beach.
Thank you.
Lots of activities that you can do.
Plenty of fun for the day.
The good thing is with the horseback
riding is that it's a fixed price.
You're not getting three tarzan at the
end of your ride, or at least you hope not.
Anyways, let's wait for a towel.
And, uh, yeah, look so yesterday, as
I was saying, it's, it's just crazy.
Like this volleyball net was like in
the, like middle of the beach, but it's
just changed so much with the high tide.
Fascinating.
Honestly, I don't think there is many
better things in life as getting into
the ocean in super crystal clear water
and uh, yeah, like it's getting, it's
kind of just like, oh look, little fishy.
It's kind of like just staying
at this knee length or this knee height
have water, but this is just unbelievable.
This is just absolutely gorgeous, such an
amazing place to stay right by the beach.
This could be, uh, honestly, one of my top,
uh, places I've stayed, but it is such a vibe.
The Palm trees, there's all the, the
bridesmaids for that wedding that I was
mentioning earlier is just absolutely perfect.
Seriously.
I'm frosting it.
I'm frothing.
I love this.
We've been walking for a couple minutes.
We're about like 50 meters
offshore and it just keeps going.
Same height.
We're at like waist level at the moment.
Oh, we're actually, we're
reaching some, some seaweed now.
Oh, it's actually, it's getting deeper.
It's deceptively deeper.
Now the water is like, literally so clear
that it looks like it's shallower here, but
I'm slowly getting submerged  to neck height.
Oh my God.
I, when I was walking here, I was like,
oh, it looks like it's getting shallow.
It must be like a, a little bit of a sand
bank here, but I'm almost fully submerged.
This is so deep.
It's so deceptive.
Wow.
Just so beautiful guys.
Excuse me, ladies.
Over there.
The water may be getting a little bit warmer
shortly, if you know what I mean, cuz I'm peeing.
uh, you know, there's two types of people
in this world, people that pee in the
shower and people that lie about it
oh my God, this is just absolute paradise.
This is just incredible.
I'm thoroughly enjoying this guys.
You know,
a lot of the hotel videos.
They're, they're fun.
They're fun to do the luxury ones, but
I'm actually very, uh, content right now.
I think it's just because we're by the ocean.
This is like one of the first, uh,
places that I've stayed at right by
the ocean that I've actually filmed.
and the fact that you just have like
beach access, you walk like about 20
meters from your hotel room to the beach.
It makes an Aussie that grew up
on the beaches, incredibly happy.
Just one, please.
Thank you.
All right, let's do this.
All right.
Jet ski.
Hey brother.
Can I please do, um, what is the difference
between beginner and advanced jet ski?
Uh, the, difference sir is the
beginner is, uh, low power.
Oh, low power.
Uh, it is, uh, a different one?
- Same, same.
Oh, same, but it is different power.
All right.
Well, I will, uh, so what we got advanced
one hour, is it like, is it a big
difference between beginner and advanced.
So you think I should do
advanced or beginner?
- Up to you.
All right.
I like to go fast.
Uh, we do, um, I'll do the advanced
15 minutes jet ski, please.
I can just do for my room, right?
I can, uh
- Room charge?
Yeah yeah.
That's okay?
All right guys.
So 4,500 pesos that's around $90 us.
The exchange rate is like 50 pesos to a dollar.
So you just kind of double it.
It is by myself or somebody comes with me.
Somebody here, if you want.
Oh, who, who will come?
Can I go by myself?
That's okay.
Not a first timer sir?
No, not jet ski.
I've done before I did it in Pakistan.
Oh, perfect.
Um, out there.
Yeah, maybe.
Ah, yeah.
Jet ski.
Yeah, you can leave there.
Thank you.
So.
All right safety precautions are done.
Let's go.
What's your name?
Lito.
Lito.
Yeah.
You are the jet ski expert?
Not, not really.
Not really.
That's not what I want to hear.
You're meant to be an expert.
All right.
Here we go.
Kawazaki.
So I remember when I was in Pakistan in
lake Attabad, we had like the two options.
We had the Kawazaki, which was considered
this like the Japanese brand, which it is,
or then you had the local, uh, brand and
like the Kawasaki was so much more expensive.
Um, so I think we got the local one.
It still went pretty fast though.
Uh this is, low power.
And this is the high power.
Ah, so it's different key for the power.
I was wondering how that worked.
So it's so important.
I hop on.
Yeah.
Okay.
Wait, so you were coming with
me or I'm going by myself.
You by myself.
Okay, good.
Yeah.
So how will I know?
15 minutes.
You will call me back?
You want to test this one?
Uh, can I switch outside?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just, uh, try to select this
is the high power.
Okay.
And then if you want to use this one.
Yeah, yeah.
Uhhuh change.
Okay.
I start with the yellow.
This is start.
Yep.
- This is a start.
Yep.
- Stop.
Yep.
- And then accelerator.
There's no brake, right?.
No, no brake, sir.
Okay.
Reverse.
Ah, okay, perfect.
So I start, start.
Okay.
Oh, all right.
Thank you.
We are off and racing everybody.
Oh my God.
These are fun.
Haha.
Oh yeah.
Wow.
I haven't rid the jet ski by myself ever.
This is just pure bliss.
Oh my God.
It is fast.
Oh yeah.
This is low power as well.
And it's fast.
Oh my God.
Look how pretty.
This is everybody.
Oh, my God.
We're about to lose my hat.
Wow guys, this is incredible.
I didn't know how fun jet skis were.
All right, let's stop this.
Let's uh, put in the high key, baby.
We're not here to go slow.
We're here to get, oh no.
Do I not put it in, right?
Maybe it's the other way
There we go.
All right guys.
I'm honestly, oh God, it is so much faster.
Oh my God.
The I'm putting, I'm taking my hat off.
The difference is insane.
Literally insane.
Look how much like recoil layers.
Oh my God
Guys its so fast.
Like I literally, this is crazy.
Look how blue the water is.
Oh my god.
I lost my hat.
I lost my hat.
I lost my hat. My hat is over there.
Guys we hit 55 kilometers an hour.
Oh no.
Oh no.
I went over my hat.
All right I see my hat.
I need to get it before it sinks.
I don't really want to jump off this thing.
Because then it could be a recipe for disaster.
Come on.
There we go.
All right hat is secure guys.
When I say this is fast, like I've rid motorbikes.
I have my motorbike license.
I used to have a motorbike at home.
Uh, but this like the acceleration
on this thing is absolutely Ludricous .
Like ridiculous.
Like there's actual G force on this thing.
Oh my God.
This is crazy.
Absolutely ridiculous.
You know?
Oh guys, I'm actually just shocked
at how much power this thing has.
Like -
Wow.
Oh, my God.
I, I got so scared that I went over my own wave.
I tried to go on the outside of
it, but I, it, it caught up to me.
It is ridiculous how fast this thing is.
Wow.
I don't know how jet skis are measured.
I know like motorbikes at.
Maybe this is horsepower, but it is just
ridiculous at the power that this thing
has just look how beautiful the views are.
Everybody like the water is just so clear.
Well look at these beautiful like
rock formations on the outside.
I'm sure that we some like fish
around, um, the, oh my God.
All right.
I think our 15 minutes is up.
I should really head back and just see
how much longer we have back we go.
I gotta be careful here.
Just cause it's like, so
shallow, lucky, like jet skis.
They're not power by all right.
We still got six minutes.
He gave me the, the, uh, the thumbs
up or saying six minutes or whatever.
So we're gonna absolutely pin it outta here.
I'll put you guys in my life
jacket so I can have both hands.
We'll do a donut, oh actually we'll go where the water's calm.
All right, we'll do a donut here.
Woohoo.
Oh my God.
This is just ridiculous.
They're doing, uh, Oh, there's a flying fish.
Hello?
I, I saw a flying fish.
These guys are doing super scuba diving.
I literally saw a flying fish.
Ah, we're low on fuel.
Look fuel down.
We've been shredding too much, or maybe
that's the indicator of, uh, 15 minutes.
Damn.
That was incredible guys.
Good.
We're coming into shore.
Wow.
It is very fast.
like incredibly fast.
Oh, it's just, thank you.
This is how you know it's
time because the fuel?
- No.
Oh, so it was -
Yeah.
All right.
Brother thank you so much.
That was so much fun.
Gee, we should have done the kayaking first.
I don't know how anything's gonna beat that now.
Hey, very good.
That's so much fun.
It's so fast.
Yeah, I should put, I'll put
the here, uh, room number, sir.
Uh, 520.
Thank you so much.
I'm back at the pool.
I just realized I left my
hat downstairs at the beach.
All right.
Got the hat.
Let's go for another swim.
All right back at the room guys.
It is, uh, around like 1:00 PM.
I think it is, uh, 12:32.
It is damn hot outside.
Um, so I'm seeking cover
in the AC for a little bit.
We'll chill out when it
cools down in the afternoon.
We'll uh, explore some more
areas out in the paradise.
Absolutely loving the vibe here.
Just Palm trees, all that good stuff.
So much greenery, so much blue.
It is, uh, yeah, the perfect combinations
to, uh, have a good time here.
So tara na.
We'll uh, see you later this afternoon.
All right.
So it's around 3:30 at the moment, had a
quick little nap and got a red bull for, uh,
some energy, but we're backed down at the beach.
So this is the, the Moadto strip
that I was speaking about.
When I was mentioning saying that
yesterday, it was super busy.
It just clocked in my mind yesterday was a Sunday.
So obviously it was a weekend.
Today is Monday and the resort that I was
staying at, uh, and just this whole area,
it's so much quieter on a, uh, on a weekday.
So it's good.
When you hear, especially on a Monday after
it's really busy, uh, during the weekend, but
the tide is starting to come out like, uh,
it's going into low tide, so you can see, like,
that's what I was saying about all the boats.
There's a couple boats in there
that are literally beached.
The jet skis are beach.
Uh, there's no, uh, you're not gonna be
able to drag those jet skis through 50
meters of sand to get to the deeper water.
Um, but yeah, we're just
gonna roam around the evening.
Enjoy the, uh, the cooler weather with a little
bit of red, red bull for some caffeine, but you
can tell every single afternoon and evening,
uh, in the Philippines is always a lot more
cloud cover, especially in the rainy season.
So we, uh, are expecting probably a
little bit of rain in the next hour
or two, uh, given the cloud formation.
So.
Let's enjoy the sun while we
have it, I suppose let's do it.
So yeah, all of this, just like a couple hours
ago was all underwater and these are all like
little crab holes and these little, uh, bits
of small rolls of sand have been crabs that
have, oh, look, there's crab right there.
Is he dead?
I don't know.
He's not moving.
He must to be dead, but all these
crabs, I think have dug little holes.
Sort of rolled up the little bits
of sand, but they are everywhere.
It's so like satisfying walking on
this soft little bit of sand here
and look at all these like little squiggly ones.
They're like little, uh, dog poos.
that is so funny.
Anyways, we're gonna walk up this way.
I haven't walked up this side
yet, so, uh, we'll go and do that.
Yeah.
So all these holes here, there's
all just like crab holes.
So give you like kick over where the mounds are.
You can see little holes of crabs
that have gone in like this one here.
It's a crab hole.
That one there, another crab hole.
It's crazy.
All this has just been done.
Since the tide's gone out.
Look, that's a big one.
Massive crab in there.
Surely it's a huge hole.
Anyways.
We'll stop disturbing the wildlife
and we'll make our way down here.
Whoa.
Look at this.
A massive jellyfish.
I'm not gonna touch it cuz you never know.
If, uh, they're poisonous or whatnot, there's
a couple of jellyfish, um, in Australia that
are really, really dangerous box jellyfish,
IgE, tiny little ones, but usually the
big ones they're not too, too dangerous.
So maybe, I don't know.
I don't even want to, I don't wanna risk it.
who knows what's out here in the Philippines
that can get you killed, could be a massive
venomous jellyfish that you die instantly.
And, but it's so cool.
Just coming down to the wildlife here
and as the tide goes out and just seeing
what was under the ocean, uh, previously,
but here here's another one over here.
This poor little guy he's gotten stuck.
I don't really know what else I can do for
you, buddy, but I'll give you some more water.
Yeah, they, they just get caught in the
tide because it goes out so rapidly.
There's no way that they can get out and
they probably just get roasted in the sun.
Hello?
What are you searching for?
Oh, worms.
Whoa.
Oh.
Oh, you have one?
Oh my God.
No, no.
Oh no.
What is that?
Oh, it's a stick.
What is, this is worm?
And you find them in.
Sand.
Yeah.
Oh, wow.
Try.
You can eat?
Really?
Yeah.
You cook or you eat raw?
Delicious masarap?
All right.
See, look at this little guy.
He was running around my feet.
Look at him.
Look how fast they are down.
Boy, go on quick, quick, quick run, run, run.
no, that's so agile.
It's crazy.
Now he's playing.
Daddy thinks that I don't see him in the sand.
They camouflage really well though.
Perfect color against the sand.
You see a couple of them.
When you walking by, they kind of feel your foot
steps underneath, run off into their little holes.
It's hundreds down there.
Guarantee it everywhere.
Well, I just noticed here, I saw one
starfish and I started to look closer
and there's literally like hundreds
and hundreds of starfish just around.
Look how big they are.
They're moving.
I didn't know.
They moved that fast.
Jeez, they're flying.
But in this, this little area here.
Oh look, you can see, this is where
they previously were or is that that?
Oh, that's one now.
Oh, I thought that was like
the out mark of another one.
So, wow.
There's so many here.
They're all under the sand.
Some have moved, I think.
Yeah so that one, there was the outline there
of one, but they made their way into the
water, but just look how cool that is.
Ooh.
there are hundreds and hundreds of them.
I don't, I don't wanna tread on.
But yeah, you can see like
the out outline of them.
They've obviously realized that they're gonna
end up here for a couple hours stuck in the sun.
So they make their way over into, into the water.
That's so cool.
Those are really cool.
Kind of like beach restaurant, they
got music blaring on the speaker.
We better stay away.
So we don't get copyrighted  but, uh, maybe
that will be the move coming, uh, here.
Later tonight for like a dinner on the beach.
Uh, or maybe even my hotel.
I think actually my hotel maybe has, uh, a
few seats on the beach area that you can use
to, uh, to eat your dinner at, which would be
beautiful, you know, as long as it's not raining.
But I think, I don't know, starting
to get a little bit more gray,
so the rain might be coming soon.
Oh my goodness.
Do you guys see what I see?
Look at that.
It's darling, the 3 tarzan horse,
but the brown version darling was white
in, uh, Karachi, but now he's brown.
What do you do with the jet ski now?
It's beach.
It goes up?
Yeah yeah.
Ah, so you have to push it up.
Yeah.
And then where does it go up there?
Up there?
Ah, it's too heavy.
It's too heavy.
You need, uh, big muscles.
Yeah.
Do you need, you need, do you need my help?
Uh three tarzan behind me, jet ski, man
behind me and a beautiful ocean view.
Does it get much better than that?
Oh, she's getting a three tarzan ride.
Watch out.
It should only be doso don't pay anything more.
Just for context, the volleyball net.
Remember how I was saying like five hours ago,
it was like literally up to like knee length.
Now it's like completely beach and
you can actually play volleyball.
So that just gives you an idea of how
much this tide actually comes out.
From the land.
It's just so shallow.
It's crazy.
Look at this guy.
This guy's got a crab in his nippers.
He's moving.
So look, buddy, you dropped
your, you dropped your crab mate.
Here you go.
Have it back.
He's just there.
Yeah.
I left it for you.
I'll leave you alone.
You can go back.
It's so fun.
Just playing with the wildlife
here and seeing everything.
I love this kind of stuff.
Hello.
Where are you from sir?
Australia.
Thank you.
Oh you drinking red horse?
Yeah, want some beer?
Sure.
Oh, it's big bottle.
Oh my goodness.
Is this your boat?
No, the, uh, other one.
Oh, the other one.
Yeah.
Uh, you're looking for the boat?
Oh no.
Tomorrow I'm leaving.
I fly back to Manila.
Oh, okay.
But thank you for the red horse.
Did you visit already Virgin island?
No, not yet.
Just like five minutes from here.
Oh, on the boat?
Yeah.
You can, uh, witness the sandbar out there.
The sand bar.
Yeah.
Long white sandbar.
Ah, and there's like fishing
stuff or it's just sand.
Just sand.
Yeah, just sand.
But this place was good for snacking.
Yeah, maybe I'll take the ice out.
Oh, you don't need the ice.
Okay.
Okay.
Because sometimes the water is not good.
Yeah yeah.
Yeah.
for like foreigner for you guys.
It's okay.
Yeah.
Oh, nice.
What's your name?
Joseph.
Joseph.
I'm Luke.
Luke.
Nice to meet you.
You're just alone going here?
Yeah, just here for a few weeks.
Ah, okay.
Travel.
So how's the weather
condition in Australia?
Cold, cold, like 10 degrees.
a lot better here.
It's nice.
Yeah, you can, even though it's rainy
season, it's still, you can have
good weather.
There's a private beach there.
Oh, up here.
Yeah.
Then you can see the sunset,
uh, over on that side.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Maybe I'm I'm going that direction.
So, uh, okay.
You just bring slippers cause uh, the
way going out there is not really safe.
Ah it's it's like hard.
No, there's some rocks, so -
I'm Australian
we don't wear shoes.
Ah  we have like always barefoot.
Okay.
Do you need slippers?
Or you are yeah.
Used to it.
You just go in the white sand, wait,
Yeah.
But if you just pass, like where's,
the horses are going there, so, oh.
That's where the horses are going.
Ah, I see.
So what is the boat used for, for tourists?
Uh, tourists, sometimes fishing.
Yeah.
Damn if I was staying another day, I'd come
out on the boat, but I'm leaving tomorrow.
Yeah yeah.
So how many days you spend here in Bohol?
Uh, just two.
Not enough.
Not enough.
Because, uh, if you do like one day for
island hopping and one day for countryside tour.
Yeah.
No, no, I think I I'll come back in maybe like one
month because I need to see the chocolate Hills.
Yeah yeah.
I have not seen them.
So I need to come back.
If you come back, just rent a,
a car, you just by yourself.
Hello.
How are you?
Take a car by your own.
Just look at the map.
Yeah.
How much does the car cost to rent?
For example, you just take
a 2000 pesos for 24 hours.
Okay.
Quick little chat, quick little
beer with that kind gentleman.
People are just so like willing
to just help you out here.
They're so friendly.
You a little doggie there, but he was
saying that this path up here leads to
a sunset, like a secret little beach.
That is good for sunset.
So hopefully the cloud cover stays away and we
can enjoy a nice little sunset for ourselves.
All right.
Can see what he meant by the rocks.
They're kind of, these ones are like a
little bit more smooth, but definitely not
the, uh, oh, not the most pleasant things
to stand on.
And that's an Australian saying that,
we don't wear shoes half the time.
especially at the beach, it's
criminal to wear shoes at the beach.
But earlier on when I was over there in,
in the morning, I would've shown like
over here and now I was actually going to
comment on these cranes that had been, uh,
established, obviously this part of Bohol.
It always was like a massive tourist area.
Um, but obviously now that the, after the pandemic
in the Philippines are starting to open up this,
no doubt will become a top tourist destination.
So they're already getting the, uh, the
foundations and buildings ready for that.
Not sure why they're not working on a Monday.
I'm not, I'm, I'm a little bit surprised
that there's not a lot of people there, but
we're gonna keep walking around this way.
See.
If we can find this little beach that
I was told about, oh, they're shooting.
They got sling shots.
Hello?
You have Slingshot.
What are you shooting birds.
Bird?
Yeah.
Or coconuts.
Ah, that's a good old days.
I remember when I was growing up, we used to like
make slingshots and stuff, but now there like
generation, at least in Australia, kids, those
that age, they're just, all they do is sit on
their iPads and iPhones and play video games.
You gotta get out, enjoy be a kid again,
get dirty, be adventurous and adventurous.
We are being walking on the edge of these rocks
here, horse poo, grass, more rocks and water.
it's uh, Oh, my God.
Look how colorful those starfish are.
Look how bright they are.
Ow.
This hurts.
Okay.
I don't know if you can see in the camera
though, look how red that, that starfish
is and the pink ones next to it.
And they're big as well.
That is crazy.
That is so beautiful.
All right guys.
So it's gotten a little bit dark.
The cloud is starting to come in.
I made my way over to the secret beach.
Um, that that guy was telling me about and I
actually filmed the next video that you'll see.
So I just spent the past two hours doing a Q and
a on the beach roaming around asking all your
questions, um, that I asked on Instagram earlier.
So, uh, that'll be the next
video that you guys see.
Uh, and I think it'll be a pretty good
insight, but yeah, certainly at pretty dark.
Over here.
Now we are, uh, gonna head back to
the hotel, but it is just so peaceful.
Like I was just chilling on the beach,
talking to the camera for like an hour or two
answering questions and I was just like, wow.
I feel so content right now.
Like, just look how, even though it's not
sunny, it's just like just, ugh, good vibes.
Such a beautiful scenery here.
Honestly.
Incredible, absolutely loving it.
So we're gonna head back to the hotel,
my throat for like speaking in the past
three hours straight is killing me.
So, uh, hopefully we can get a bit
of appetite for dinner tonight.
Uh, but if not, we'll head down to
breakfast tomorrow morning, so I
don't know what the next clip will be.
Uh, but let's roll it now.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I can't.
I'm not paying 3000 bro.
So right now it's around 6:00 PM.
This is the time that I kind of
arrived yesterday and it was raining
so much, but it was so beautiful.
Just like walking down here at this time.
This is the wedding that
I was showing you earlier.
They were doing photo shoots here,
but it looks like they've hided out
this, uh, this hotel and the kinda like
beach area to have the, the function.
So such.
A pretty area.
So nice.
Be on the beach
with all the lights and stuff.
We got some flowers.
Hello brother.
It is wedding time, but, uh, we're gonna
head back up to the hotel room now and we'll
see the, the rest of the night takes us.
Good morning.
Everybody.
Hair is probably a mess and I am tired as can be.
I've been going to bed so late lately
and, uh, breakfast finishes at like
10:00 AM and it's like nine 50.
So we've gotta make this quick, but, uh,
there's the kind of day that we have upon us.
I will be checking out in about an hour and
a half, have a flight that I need to get to,
as I was saying, maybe yesterday that at.
For it's like 10 minutes away.
So I booked a, a taxi, uh, it was 800 pesos.
So, so around like $16, which is pretty
expensive, you could probably go to the
street and, uh, get it for like five bucks
maximum, um, like a took took or something.
But I just wanted, uh, to know that it
was here at 11:30 when I need to need
to leave, but yeah, pretty cloudy.
Uh, we got blue skies over that side,
uh, and, uh, clouds over that side.
So hopefully there's no turbulence on the
flight, but gonna quickly head down to
breakfast, uh, eat as much as I can, even
though I'm not that hungry, get a coffee.
And then, uh, I was originally
thinking, I was saying, oh, it'd be so
perfect to go for like a morning swim.
But I realized that I have a flight, so
I can't have wet clothes on me cause I
need to pack up all my things, which,
you know, there's everything here.
Lots of things in here.
um, so yeah, we can't be
having gee my hair is a mess.
Sorry for having to put you through this.
Geez.
Sorry.
anyways, let's go down to breakfast.
See you guys down there.
I'll tell you what the weather gets a
whole lot better when there's an infinity
pool, overlooking the water or the ocean.
It just, uh, it makes a difference,
but we're heading down to breakfast
now, as I said, not too hungry.
I'll have like a bite to eat
and maybe a coffee wake up.
Um, but I have like five minutes  to do so that's
when it closes, but the beach is looking good.
High tide again, as you can see,
people got their kayaks out.
I think somebody's getting ready for
jet ski, but, uh, yeah, let's go get breakfast.
Honestly, I swear this is like
the hottest part of the day.
Like the morning time it's around like 10:00 AM
and it is so hot, but here's the breakfast area.
Everybody you have out outside seating your
inside seating, but we'll go in, get the
last bit of the buffet breakfast and then,
uh, hang around for an hour or so.
Yes could I have a black coffee, actually
No, just a coffee with milk, please.
Thank you.
All right.
This is what you call breakfast of
champions, everybody bacon and eggs,
a chocolate muffin and a, a bread roll
I'm gonna force myself to eat this.
I'm not hungry at all.
As I was saying, my sleep has just been absolutely
ridiculous lately, going to bed at like 3:00 AM.
And, uh, I don't know, it's
crazy, but a little bit of bacon.
They love bacon here in the Philippines,
and I love bacon as well,
but we're gonna eat this.
We are gonna get a coffee to
wake us up, and then
we gotta check out,
unfortunately, it's always the saddest time of
the day when you have to check out of a luxury
place, but it means that there are new adventures
on the way that's possibly the worst chocolate
muffin I've ever had, but I'm gonna eat more.
Oh, not the worst one.
It's getting better as the, uh, the day goes on.
Amazing.
Thank you so much.
Amazing.
Could I actually sugar here?
Perfect.
All right.
Is here.
Ah, amazing.
Thank you.
Water.
Yes, please.
Thank you.
Amazing.
Oh, oh, made a mess, thank you very much.
This is hard.
One handed guys.
Anyways, I'm gonna eat this.
We'll uh, catch up with you in a second.
So open up this little bread roll here.
Kind of reminds me of like
Turkish -
It's super soft, but chuck the egg on top
and uh, we're gonna make ourselves a
little bacon, egg sandwich, and that is
a perfect way to, uh, to start the day.
That was really nice.
Mmm.
All right.
Thank you.
Coffee done.
We're wired again.
We're back alive.
We got approximately an hour until we
need to, uh, head off to the hotel.
It is such a beautiful day.
Like the, the only thing I can think
of is having a swim, but we're in a bit
of a predicament because I don't have
any, like, I can't have wet clothes cuz
they're all gonna get packed into a bag.
What's this guy doing?
Anyways, we'll head back up to the hotel room.
And, uh, I think that'll,
that'll be about it, everybody.
We'll see, we'll see what we come across.
We are back at the room, I'm gonna get, uh,
everything packed up and I'm gonna head on out to
the airport, but it has been an amazing stay here.
How can you not just love the
beautiful views that you have?
It's been so much fun.
I've really actually enjoyed filming
this hotel video, riding a jet ski
is doing all those fun activities.
And just like more specifically,
it's been by the beach.
It is just such an amazing feeling when you
can stay somewhere and literally see all this
blue water and greenery everywhere you go.
And, you know, a two minute walk and
you're right at the beach from your room.
So it is been fun.
Definitely recommend this place.
Uh, as all my hotel videos, it's not sponsored
or anything, I just settled the bill there and it
ended up being, uh, I stayed for two nights.
It ended up being 500 USD around about,
uh, maybe 520, including all the, like
the jet ski, uh, room service, uh, and
obviously the room charges as well.
So, uh, yeah, it's been fun.
I really enjoyed this place and
this is gonna be a long video.
well, over an hour, I'd say, uh, but hopefully you
guys enjoyed coming along to this hotel with me.
So we're gonna finish up the
video here, everybody as always
thank you so much for watching, chase your dreams,
and we will see you all in the next one.
Goodbye.
