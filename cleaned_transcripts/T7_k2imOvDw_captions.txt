 
Rice cooker
I can speak tagalog
 
Heyo! It's Léah with an H
Let's get to know each other better
As I'm doing the Filipino Tag
 
What is it?
It has launched 2-3 years ago
There are questions that need to be answered
And they are about the Filipino culture
Because for those who don't know it yet
I'm half Algerian from my father's side
and half filipino from my mother's side
So in terms of food, it is the jackpot!
When was the last time you went to the Philippines?
It is recently!
From September 2017 until February 2018 for my internship
Name 1 filipino dish that you love & why?
You cannot pick 1 filipino dish
because in the Asian culture
you don't eat 1 dish with 1 side dish
You eat multiple dishes with multiples side dishes
Let me pick 3 Filipino dishes
I changed the rules, I do whatever I want
 
It is a stew/soup made of tamarind
you cook meat and fish
and I love it made with salmon
It tastes so good!
Second dish
Filipino people know!
It is a dish based on chicken
marinated in soy sauce
and it is so good with rice
It is close to the Chicken Yass
My Gabonese friend made me taste it
I was like "Sister! That tastes like a filipino dish!"
For the last one, Filipino BBQ or the lumpia?
 
mmmm *hesitating* the filipino bbq
Name 2 items that represent the filipino culture
Again, I cannot quote only 2 items
So I am going to give you a house tour
And show you that I am real pinay
Sorry for the mess
I've just walked on a Filipino grocery bag
 
Now let's go to the kitchen!
 
Let's check the drawers
 
You have all the sauces from the Asian supermarket
 
 
More Asian sauces
We stock all the rice in a rice box
We don't buy the small bag of rice but
the 20kg rice bag
And we put everything in this box
Let me show you how it works
You just need to push these buttons
then pull the container
and you have the rice!
Now let's go to the bathroom!
Here you have the famous...
 
 
This item is so practical to clean your butt
 
 
It is the Filipino broom
Can you speak Filipino?
Yes I can speak tagalog!
So 1 or 2 sentences
Let me think
I am going to say Filipino Pick Up lines
Wait, I have nothing in my mind
 
Why?
Because I only have you in my mind
 
From which part of the Philippins are you from?
So my mother is from the South of Manila, Muntinlupa
 
and my grandmother is from Pampanga!
That's why she cooks very well!
Thank you for watching my video until the end!
The concept of a tag is to tag people!
So I am tagging 2 friends
April Visda & Charlène Figaro
so girls I hope you're going to do it!
I can't wait to hear  your answers!
 
That's the effect you know! Nevermind, bye!
