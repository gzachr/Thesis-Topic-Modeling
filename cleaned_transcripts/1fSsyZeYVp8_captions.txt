unless you don't like sardines but
otherwise just put prawns if you want
you can put prawns tapos
i also fried some tilapia
i don't know i just fancy tilapia so the
nephroscope and suggest
and see
um
yeah so tara
[Music]
it looks really yummy and i am having it
with
fried tilapia it's crispy fried
and then a little bit of rice and then
my um salsa one is spiced sweet vinegar
homemade
looking forward to this let me try it
opo here in the uk i think what is it
called i think it's some
squash
basically it's like
the texture is similar to um
let's eat guys
[Music]
mmm
[Music]
[Music]
dip it in this
sauce
[Music]
hmm
[Music]
i can hear a peter potter
without you mr pickle
[Music]
um i'm gonna have to eat with
bare hands now
[Music]
hopefully
[Music]
i'm just gonna finish my food and then
i'll get back to you once he's home
he's home guys
munching grapes okay
i still can't get used to using my
camera so i am using my phone
really how do you think you may not
inside though the camera is about 20
times more expensive
don't know the sound that's got guinness
hanging in it
why
you don't like the sound of guinea sound
in it
why don't you like the sound of it this
guinea's saying what's guinness song is
it sauteed
oh okay
something else
i thought it was one of your bloody
fishy posts
no there's no fishy taste in it
but there is
[Laughter]
[Music]
oh
it's the filipino sardines that we
bought from the shrimp doesn't matter
where they swim from they you normally
like it if i cook it with eggs is that
filipino sardines does that mean because
they swim in the philippines
[Music]
but i just really been fancying this for
ages so i thought i'm going to make it
for me and then we might as well let him
taste it yeah why not
what did you say i said i'll take you
you want my honest reaction
i might as well yeah of course i do of
course but before that what did you say
when i opened it i got a bad feeling
about this
no that's not what you said what did i
say he said what the frick
okay putting me nothing what the frick
this is what it looks like look at that
it looks so yummy it looks like curry so
far i like the bowl
it looks like curry look it does yeah
okay what's that that's awful
that's the filipino cordial type of the
one we bought from the shop
i know you love cool yet
[Laughter]
[Music]
don't lie
i love courgettes
okay the sauce
[Music]
i got a bad feeling about this
actually it tastes better look
i know it does and it's it is slightly
um spicy you can um
taste the spice of the sardines that was
the sardine
i get the trying other side of the spice
i didn't put a lot of salt in it so in
fact i didn't i can put i can get the
twang of the sardines a little bit i'm
not a sardine lover i don't like
sardines that much
it's okay
but no like i said i didn't put
any salt in it so you can actually eat
it on its own because normally in
philippines you have it with rice some
of the food you make me i'll have a bowl
full on rice yeah but i don't think i'll
go for a bowl full of that
[Music]
maybe just
side portion
you you you can have it as a side dish
yeah
how do you rate it from one to ten
comparing to your other filipino foods
no don't compare it to any filipino just
rating from one to ten six
that's not bad i thought you're going to
say five
six i'll give it a six because you
cooked it because it's you you're a good
cook well nothing is special in it it's
just sardines because you're adobo it's
11 out of 10.
if it's your coloretta it's nine out of
ten because your mom gets 10.
mama she gets 10 out of 10. you're adobo
is 11 out of 10.
i know you're not gonna like everything
but this is just going to be the
beginning of the series of what we
called what what we're going to call the
kim series now it's my turn to give her
something typically english no no
[Music]
this is going to be the beginning of
what we call tikkim series in
philippines amazing
it means it means it's a taste test of
all the filipino food that you haven't
tasted before so you're going to have to
taste it okay everything that i haven't
even made it for you before
everything because i don't cook
everything for you because i know you
don't you're not gonna eat it or you're
not familiar with it so chances are
you're not going to like it but now if
it's got too much fish i'm going to cook
a lot of food that i haven't even cooked
myself
or i i haven't even tried myself and
you're going to try it with me so this
is going to be the beginning of the kim
series okay
so can we go to jollibee as well
[Music]
that's traditional filipino food in it
who said it was he went down another
they came back and said they've eaten
filipino food they've been to jollibee
um what's his name ian yeah
he has filipino food every day and
especially breakfast but where does he
go
so there you go guys he rated it
um six out of six out of ten
so it's not bad it's not really why is
that
it's not really a fail but it's not a
fail like i say i wouldn't say i won't
eat it can you have another bed nope i
don't know
i can have another spoonful but like i
say that's not spoonful that's that's
barely a teaspoonful when we have a when
we have a it looks like mushroom
actually
the texture is like a bit mushroom
because i didn't overcook it i thought
it was mushroom
when i looked at it when i saw it cut up
into slices oh wait somebody's tapping
me here
oh look somebody's stopping me
