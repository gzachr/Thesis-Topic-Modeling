kamusta Khan my friends and welcome to the
Philippines. It is my 55th country and I have
just arrived after a nine-hour flight as you
can imagine I am pretty tired but we had a
great staff on the flight here. Thank you
so much Salamat Salamat thank you. I'm a vlogger
yeah oh wow enjoy your stay yeah thank you
so much I'm really excited to be here oh yeah
all right we're the last ones off the plane
oh thank you so much it's a World Nomac so
guys on the last one coming off the plane
because I was sitting all the way back in
row 72. Best For Last there we go bye thank
you so much yeah so already guys within seconds
of Landing here such nice uh people all around
so really excited to explore this place thank
you so much and we're gonna go ahead and get
through customs guys and we'll see you once
we get out there
All right welcome to the Philippines. Hello.
All 
right so this is the Manila airport seems
like it's a pretty massive airport here. I'm
guessing multiple terminals and yeah guys
I didn't Vlog anything on the flight because
I've made so many airplane videos at this
point that sometimes they get a bit repetitive
so this time I was like all right I'm gonna
start the video right when I land in Manila
and we're just gonna get straight into things
it was you know a nice uh cruise from I flew
in from Riyadh Saudi Arabia and then now I
yeah slept probably like four or five of the
nine hours and ate a couple meals and you
know pretty good food and really nice staff
on the plane but wasn't too much to share
with you guys because it was dark pretty much
the whole night so on a plane so yeah guys
now we're gonna head over to immigration and
head into the city let's go oh we got a really
long line here so
is uh is this the line for foreigners too
we're here
thank you so much hello uh which line do I
go on uh any line sir okay do I need to get
a Visa or anything uh you have to prepare
your errables okay perfect thank you all right
thank you so guys one thing that you have
to fill out that I think literally started
like very recently is you need to fill out
one of these e-travel documents and then you
get this QR code so make sure you do that
before otherwise it'll take you obviously
time to do that when you're in line and uh
yeah now next up we just gotta go through
customs and we are in literally no line guys
took me like 20 seconds asked how long I'm
staying and uh that's it stamp my passport
and now we just go through here because I
didn't check a bag got the carry on today
and the backpack and now we're heading right
through here all right and we're here Philippines
it's been a while I made my first time ever
okay it's really chill when you walk outside
on the arrivals so I guess I need to find
a spot to get some cash first looks like we
might have an ATM right over here with a long
line we've got globe and smart Okay so these
might be the SIM cards you need hello sir

so yeah guys that is the room tour a nice
place and it looks like last but not least
oh I gotta test the beds oh I could honestly
fall asleep right now
um if there's no sleep on the plane my friends
I would sleep but we gotta explore let's go
all right and we're closed so we're heading
down gonna see if we can find a little bite
to eat guys because I am starving I need my
first meal here in the Philippines guys, unfortunately,
I was gonna try and shoot a few less dark
or nighttime videos because just in a lot
of my Nepal videos it was so hard to see like
with at least still decent quality so let's
go to the lobby here so hopefully we'll be
able to find some areas that are more lit
up so if I'm taking you out at night you can
at least see things better I don't want to
say that it was like that in all of my Nepal
videos that I filmed that night but there
was just a lot of them that I edited after
and I was like geez that is so dark you can
barely see me all right we're back at the
ground floor
out this way hello my friend
[Music] [Applause]
perfect thank you all right guys wow at this
hour you can just hear all of the church bells
going off we've got a lot of different foods
we're going to be trying over the next uh
coming days foreign
that's like a fruit Maybe [Music]
all sorts of cheese there Blended ice that
might be a little something good to uh enjoy
on the way over there
okay oh they've even got some coffee there
too okay well let's see if we've got anyone
here
hello what's your best type that you have
I'm thinking I'm probably gonna go with one
of these uh chocolate chills
nice to meet you Rizza thank you, sir, what's
your name my name is Mac uh what's your best
flavor here the most popular okay let me go
with that one please super taroise yes okay
I'll do I'll try a regular please and what's
it what is taro one only oh yes please just
one and what is taro is that a fruit
hey coffee
well that looks very good super thorough ice
it's gonna be my first time having one of
these [Music] oh so there we go it looks like
we put all the ingredients in there and there's
some sort of machine that blends it is from
Taiwan all ingredients are from Taiwan okay
all right this is your shop no um
oh this looks fantastic made perfectly by
Rizza how much 100 100 105. okay uh not yet
it's my first uh first item that I bought
in the Philippines do you want me to go inside
and get change no sorry
95. Solomon Reza thank you very much
thank you
yeah that's for you thank you thank you
uh we are going to be trying this delicious
thing out right here guys let's go ahead and
get this straw in there
to be honest, I have absolutely no idea what
I'm gonna expect to be tasting here in just
a moment but it's got like multiple layers
we have like a Green Layer there and it almost
looks like Silly Putty if you know what Silly
Putty is where it's like the stuff you like
play around with it's almost like a stress
reliever it mixed with like a bunch of different
I don't even know what those are but let's
try it out here
whoa
so weird there's like gummies in it mixed
with a little bit of chocolate
so weird I would say like a sour twist at
the end of some of them I don't even know
if that's the right way to explain it but
as you can see there's like so many different
layers let's try the top layer
okay so it's more of like the better way to
explain it it's more of like a Jello texture
on the inside of there but it tastes quite
nice I moved locations there guys I would
say the best way to explain this if you like
things that have texture you'll love this
then but I I will say like having so many
different layers with every straw full like
or every gulp I take through here
literally a different flavor but it's cool
I like it a lot it's a nice little like first
taste into what it's like here but all the
ingredients are Taiwanese what I believe they
said oh we got a little piece right on
free cat hanging out
oh and I think we even have bubble tea mixed
in there yeah they see those little brown
balls those are the components used in bubble
tape so it's like a hybrid of like many different
things that I've had in the past but uh yeah
it's pretty good it's uh two dollars about
101 uh pesos Filipino pesos so two dollars
for this uh uh I mean I'd say it's a pretty
good price for being right downtown in the
city I will say guys I drank through like
one third of it and it's almost like eating
a meal because there's so much stuff in it
it's not just like a normal drink all right
maybe for fun we'll take one of these bikes
here Coastal car
sincerity restaurant sincerity that's right
yeah yeah hey yeah all right perfect we're
gonna go for a little cruise on this thing
yes sir
[Applause] all right we're going full speed
ahead on this thing cool yeah

in front of us we got multiple types of traffic
on the road here
the channel is uh World Nomex YouTube channel
yes sir ah new subscriber [Music] thank you
very much brother
it is a 
world nomad thank you sir thank you
so yeah guys as you can see we've got this
uh probably like two or three people in here
you know like I mean we've got room for multiple
you can probably get up to four or five if
you really squeeze people in
we're going for a little cruise around the
neighborhood though we're taking the long
way brother
perfect

a little bit of everything I
over the world
thank you oh sincerity right here yeah perfect
perfect good we have arrived we have arrived
McConnell 100 all right
guys hook me up at the locals price thank
you brother thank you
ah hello my friend
yes sir salamat kuya all right so we're gonna
go over here to uh sincerity guys this looks
like the spot but I don't know if there's
any availability no open tables
hello all right let's see here we're gonna
be going upstairs and trying something out
hello is there an upstairs this is more seating
oh perfect that can go this way thank you
uh which one left side all right thank you
uh the secret passage okay we have made it
guys I was standing outside hoping a table
was gonna open up and then I saw a bunch of
people walk out and I was like where did they
come from so it must mean we have oh multiple
floors we've got the second floor and we can
even turn all the way up to the Third
all right hello how are you uh sit anywhere
I can sit wherever thank you all right so
this is recommended to me by Ian uh a buddy
that I work with and we are checking out what
we're gonna be eating here we've got chicken
seafood pork soup snacks rice okay Prosperity
packages so it seems like we've got a ton
of good options but in the area that I'm staying
at he recommended this place in one other
places like some of the best tasting at good
price uh spots so I'm gonna do what I always
do and probably go with the whatever I'm recommended
to get so we shall see hello yes uh what is
your most popular item uh we have fried chicken
oh okay I'm thinking I'm gonna have to go
with the the first option on the Fried Chicken
yeah and that's uh that's enough to make me
quite full just a half okay anything else
okay perfect that sounds great what about
are there any like specialty uh drink or beverage
together we own the house oh it's good Coke
and Ken all right we'll we'll do coke uh oh
what was the second one I'll do that one then
yeah yeah that sounds great and that should
be it then okay perfect
nice to meet you name's Mac all right so we've
got some delicious uh recommendations here
supposedly the uh most popular items people
are going to be ordering here so I'm excited
to try this out my first full meal here in
the Philippines all right we got the coke
here and also we've got some crushed ice it
looks like ice at the top oh like bubble tea
oh it's such a unique flavor it's like the
I don't even know what those are called like
the bubble like there's similar texture to
bubble tea but they're not like round
and they taste like
hard to say but the food looks delicious this
is for me maruming Salama thank you um this
one's called uh okay and this is your favorite
yeah all right looks looks delicious and that's
the chicken wow that's like enough for like
three people to eat this
thank you oh my gosh look at this chicken
right there oh yum yum yum let's give the
smell oh my God that's gonna be good that
is gonna be good all right we're gonna push
the uh we're gonna push the plates aside and
bring this it looks like maybe some sort of
gravy that goes on top that'd be my guess
and maybe some uh additional items to mix
them up with sauce for the chicken what's
this one go on on here yeah oh perfect okay
and then this on top of here okay great thank
you salamat all right I think I gotta start
with all right well I already know I'm gonna
love the Fried Chicken so I'm gonna start
with the Kik Lang two pieces and it's loaded
up with pork we're gonna toss a little bit
of this but actually before I put this on
here I want to test the flavors let's see
if I can pick it up all right let's try that
thing out it looks like there's pork in there
some veggies maybe fried a bit
wow that's a cool flavor something I haven't
experienced before it's like a crunch on the
outside we got the pork mixed in with some
of the pork fat on the inside and almost like
um I wouldn't want to call it sweet but you
got a semi-sweet taste in there let's try
dipping it in the gravy there
[Music] now I see the purpose of this we're
going to want to dump that all on there um
oh yes that is a match made in heaven yum
yum yum
soak up just a bit that is good the Key Club
I've never heard of this actually blah blah
blah blah
very delicious thank you for the recommendation
I arrived in the Philippines today so I'm
still practicing learning uh some of the local
language
so we've got a nice little taste test for
that this chicken is calling my name right
now so once again I'm gonna try the chicken
without the sauce to dip it in first just
to get a taste of that crunch
is oh that's really good Holly it beats KFC
bro
[Music]
a really moist chicken on the inside that's
how you can tell it's cooked well that oily
Chew in the crunch of the skin makes the taste
buds really happy and then we're going to
add a little bit of the sauce on thank you
let's see how things are now let's go ahead
and toss that right on there and let's try
this bite off
so I would say that's like I think that's
ketchup let me ask is this ketchup it is ketchup
okay my taste buds were accurate thank you
so I guess that's common here putting a ketchup
on the fried chicken it tastes good
a nice crunch but honestly guys yeah like
half of the chicken plus this I mean I'm gonna
be walking away uh with a nice big belly guys
you can take a closer look at the uh texture
of this basically it looks like it is cooked
inside of this um I don't know if I would
call that like a a skin or a bread because
I've never had it um but it's super super
good the chicken I've made through probably
30 of it but uh probably will need to take
some of it home with me because it is a lot
of food to eat but overall it's like high
quality you can tell it's freshly cooked and
delicious here so really a uh a place you
want to go if you have a huge appetite I had
that like big uh tea slash drink right before
this so that like filled up my stomach partially
and now trying to take down all this is a
lot of food but it's delicious
so guys the total for me to eat all that comes
out to about 435 which is 7.85 so basically
feed I don't know you could probably feed
two people very well on that three if you're
not super hungry you know so I'm gonna box
it up and I'm gonna see if I can find some
of the kids on the street because they seem
like they were pretty hungry because one of
them snatched my bubble tea so maybe maybe
a little hungry for the chicken then so let's
pack it up and head down 435 there's uh with
the tip foreign thank you so much so we got
the food to go we'll see if we can find someone
to donate it to outside and let's pack up
guys delicious meal on it looks like the filming
uh last one in here
all right we are heading down then
iOS
thank you very much very delicious thank you
all right so that was a uh nice meal my friends
a lot of meat that is for sure this belly
is more full than it needs to be right now
but a delicious place to try out some food
so pretty good price for being in the city
I mean eight dollars for that big of a meal
uh you know like I said you can split that
with two people probably uh four bucks per
person so pretty good prices for a place that's
super well known highly rated and it's been
around for a while but it seems like just
into the early evening this area shuts down
kind of early because it gets dark a lot of
these businesses are closed I guess a lot
of them are banks but the church right there
is lit up so bright with all of those different
like strobes on the side of it and guys if
you've been watching this video from the beginning
of the video like keep in mind I haven't slept
really much in the last 36 hours so that's
why my energy is just like cool I need sleep
but I'm trying to stay awake long enough that
way when I go to sleep then it'll be like
late enough tonight where I can wake up in
the morning and hopefully assume like a normal
sleeping schedule pretty quick but we shall
see if that happens
let's say we got the fire department doing
a little street cleaning
well done
all right we'll see if we can find any of
the uh the kid that we're asking for food
further down in Chinatown and hook them up
but it's better to give it to someone than
you know I don't know if the restaurant would
dispose of it or what would happen to it so
I figured I'd pack it up and find someone
you know people are sadly uh pretty hungry
if they you know one of them came up to me
and snatched my bubble tea drink it's not
a bubble tea but something I got out of my
hands so I remember you that's for you I brought
you food okay that's better than uh coins
yeah and uh anong pengalang Mall all right
have a good day
I'm glad I found him specifically because
he was one of the guys who was like give me
a coin give me coin and uh he came up a little
aggressive so I wasn't gonna give him coins
when he approached me like that I don't think
I was filming before but he seemed like a
nice kid so he'd give him some food you know
makes me happy knowing that his food's gonna
for sure go to him you know because uh depending
on where you're at if you um depending on
what country you're in different places what
I've learned is that unfortunately a lot of
the times kids are sent out to get money and
you give them the money and then it usually
doesn't go to them it goes to either a mom
or dad or a boss or you know depending on
the country of cartel or a gang so I'm never
going to make that assumption but that's why
I prefer to get food because you know hopefully
it's at least going to directly lead to them
getting some Chow in their bellies for the
night so yeah guys really cool uh experience
for the first night here in Manila we got
a lot to explore in this country we're gonna
do as much as we can hello brother hey

back to the hotel room guys I am going to
get in some gym clothes and finish off with
a little tour down there check out a bit more
of the hotel and hit the gym let's go
all right we are heading down to the gym I
honestly have no idea how I have energy to
hit the gym after not sleeping in a day and
a half but want to start the routine out right
so
yeah that Bonnie needs it after all that chicken
yeah we're gonna go to the gym at floor number
two from your function room news Cafe basement
Lobby now so the one thing I'm not happy with
the Ramada is is that the internet at least
since I got here has not been very reliable
in the room very very weak so hopefully that'll
change on some of these other floors gym this
way hello uh the gym right here thank you
all right gym right here looks like we're
the only ones here 6 a.m till 10 P.M and oh
hello oh maybe that's it right there and they
said let there be light
hello brother how do I turn on the lights
brother
uh brother how do I turn the lights
oh perfect last one of the night oh no aircon
it's good how it is thank you so much all
right so we've got the gym here so we're gonna
be uh doing a nice session let's say we've
got the treadmills here we've got a pretty
old weight set but pretty old I mean probably
30 years old but we got enough to get the
job done we got curls and bikes elliptical
so let's get into it guys as I always tell
you I'm no fitness instructor I'm no trainer
so don't take my advice I'm just gonna set
us up for a quick 30 minute workout see what
we can do in here let's start with the treadmill
[Music]
[Music]
oh guys that was a much needed workout I'll
tell you that if you get into cold water on
Deck here come on yes
all right that was nice okay these are good
evening oh all right I'll see you in the morning
oh and good morning guys from the crack of
dawn it is about 7 A.M and I am finally getting
out of bed now finally actually this is uh
quite early for me as you guys can probably
imagine I look super tired but I am a little
jet lag went to bed like seven hours ago so
I figured it's time to go check out the hotel
breakfast let's head on down all right down
to the cafe
good morning good morning all right we got
breakfast uh bright and early senior buffet
style it looks like
options so we got a nice little uh good morning
how are you uh yeah my room number is
1105. thank you all right let's see we've
got multiple choices for eggs already here
pre-made so that's gonna make the decision
easy I think I'll probably have to get one
of these already ready to go yum
still nice and warm good morning how are you
uh Royce yeah very good see what we've got
over here
oh garlic rice for the morning now that's
uh that's gonna be a heavy heavy taste to
have a couple slices on there pancakes too
yeah this will be good to start off salamat
kuya
you know bread okay probably needs a little
bread right can't have breakfast without bread
right that looks like a great piece right
there that one's calling my name we'll take
that one and see how this works how does the
toaster work brother
okay secret uh secret way to do it
all right well we got 
cookies right here dark chocolate cookies
that looks like it's gonna be a must
Good Cookies yeah you bake them Royce no they
smell delicious we'll get two of them on there
now normally I wouldn't have cookies for breakfast
but today's a special day
a cheat day exactly I went to the gym last
night here at the Ramada so how how nice to
meet you my name is Mac all right oh that
looks fantastic perfectly made yes
got some fruits there too looks like we're
gonna have to get some freshly made juices
right here pineapple and we'll Double Down
orange juice get that one going and get that
one going oh they're filling up fast and loaded
up the cups are a bit bigger than the machines
loaded up with some ice should we get them
ice cold
oh and of course the most important thing
of the morning we got to get the uh brewed
coffee right there that'll give us some energy
to get the day going
load it up right again
all right so here's what uh breakfast is looking
like we've got a bunch of options here nothing
healthiest breakfast I've ever had but enough
to get some energy to start the day I think
this was a new record for the earliest I have
filmed the video but uh that's all thanks
to jet lag I don't think we'll be waking up
at 6am every day [Music]
so thirsty pineapple juice right there and
a nice Orange and do exactly what your parents
tell you not to do start with dessert
mm-hmm should we freshly baked cookie melt
in your mouth
next I think a little egg and bacon toast
will do the job there we'll go ahead get that
on there we're going to turn this into a little
burrito here the yolk's gonna explode
let's try it out
um
oh yeah it tastes like we're home my friends
a nice chewy bread the light crunch from toasting
it yolk just pouring in and out of it and
then some bacon on the inside for even more
of a crunch guys by the way I never mentioned
how much I'm hand i'm hand like 350 for five
nights here so it's kind of expensive I will
say but Manila in general from what I saw
at least this time of the year that I'm here
um accommodation prices are a bit more and
while I was sitting down I was told that uh
breakfast wasn't included but I'm pretty sure
a guy told me yesterday I don't know if it
was on video or not that breakfast wasn't
included so I guess I'll pay an extra ten
dollars now on top of that [Music] the noodles
are good to have that like Asian Taste to
them you know like the Asian noodle paste
when you expect to taste these ones that you
can find in a lot of the Southeast Asian countries
I've been to off the top of my head I can't
remember the name let's try out this orange
juice
thank you
that is fantastic
thank you so much
of course okay thank you very much thank you
very much oh thank you so much thank you very
much thank you sir you too

customer service from the Ramada they knew
I had a Wi-Fi issue being in the room that
I was at so they went ahead and switched me
to another room so I'm going to snap my fingers
we're gonna show up in the other room oh guys
and we are here so it actually seems like
the room they moved me into is a little bit
more spacious I feel like it's slightly bigger
and they set us up with a thank you card there
what do we got in it oh my gosh whoa they've
got like all these treats inside that is okay

sweets to try out even a little milk as well
