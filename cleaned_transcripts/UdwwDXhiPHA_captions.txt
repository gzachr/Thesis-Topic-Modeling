- (gasps) It looks so pretty.
- It does look good,
and I'm not afraid
to eat this one! Yippee!

- (FBE) In honor of the holidays,
today you will be trying
Christmas food
from around the world.
- Oh! Cool.
I did a video before
trying other Christmas foods.
I think most of them were good.
Some were pretty bad.
- I wanna try Christmas food.
I'm really excited.
- I love food. I probably
like any food given to me.
- I am not sure
about Christmas food.
All I know is that
it'll be different.
- I love Christmas!
i like actually setting up cookies
for Santa Claus.
I'm excited!
- It's probably gonna be sweet,
'cause it's Christmas.
You know, it's a holiday season.
I'm ready to get on the sugar rush
from eating a bunch
of holiday sweets.
- (FBE) Here is your first one.
- What in the world is this?
Ew. It's wet and soggy.
- It looks like just
a big mash of food together.
- It looks kind of like
meatloaf with, you know,
a little plant on it.
- Oh. It's meatloaf.
- It's good, yeah.
I actually like this.
It tastes like eggs and sausage.
- I kind of feel like it was a mix
of that eggplant or something
and a grape leaf.
- (FBE) This is called embutido.
It is a meatloaf-like dish
made with ground pork.
While it can be served year-round,
it is often served on Christmas Eve
in the Philippines.
- Oh! I think my mama,
she is part Filipino.
I've been wondering
what they eat on Christmas Eve.
- (FBE) All right,
here's the next one.
- Oh, no. Not fish.
- It has the shape of fish.
It has the texture of fish.
- It looks like it has
frosting or sour cream on it.
- Mm, it kind of
tastes like fish and chips.
I would never eat this
on Christmas,
because then the next day,
I'm probably gonna throw up,
'cause the taste is
still gonna be in your mouth.
- Mm-mm. I'm getting
a flavor of frosting in this.
I do not like it.
It's disgusting.
- I'll do it!
Eh! It was really salty
for some reason.
Salty and slimy.
And then there was sour cream,
I think, on top of it.
- It has a really weird texture
when you put it in your mouth
and is really chewy.
It's like a new taste
I've never tasted before.
- (FBE) This is Swedish
pickled herring,
which is a type of fish.
- That's why I don't like it.
I don't like fish.
- (FBE) It is often served
for Christmas as well as Easter
and midsummer. It can usually
be found as part of a smorgasbord
that includes cold fish, breads,
cheese, and sometimes
even dessert.
- Yeah, I wouldn't
eat this for Christmas
or any time of the year,
because I just didn't like it.
- (FBE) Here is the next one.
- Oh, so it's bread.
- It does look good,
and I'm not afraid
to eat this one! Yippee!
- Mm! It tastes good.
It's some sort of raisin cake.
- Mm.
Yup, that's raisin.
I do not like raisins,
but I do like this.
- Mm. Mm.
It tastes like a lemon cake.
A lemon cake
plus bread or something.
And I see there's little raisins
or little other fruits in there.
It's pretty good.
- (FBE) This is panettone,
also called Italian Christmas bread.
While its origins are unknown,
legend has it that
in the late 1400s,
a young nobleman fell in love
with the daughter
of a baker named Toni,
and created "Pan del Toni"
to impress his love's father.
- (chuckles) That's cute.
It's an amazing story
to start off a 600-year tradition.
- Legend has it
that in 2017,
a boy named Tyler
fell in love with this dish
and wants to eat it all.
- (FBE) All right,
here's the next one.
- Wow.
(gasps) It looks so pretty!
- I knew there was gonna be
some kind of chocolate in this.
- It smells good.
It smells chocolatey.
- Mm. It tastes
like chocolate cake!
I'm not sure why,
but it's pretty much
like chocolate cake,
except for that it looks
like part of a log.
- Oh my gosh.
It is so good.
It's basically like chocolate cake,
and then there's
chocolate frosting inside.
I mean, if you don't
like chocolate,
then you're not gonna like this,
but almost everyone
in the entire world
loves chocolate,
so this is delicious.
I love it.
- The outer layer is
definitely chocolate
and tastes like chocolate,
but once you hit the light brown,
it's coffee.
- Sadly, I have no guesses
of where it's from.
- (FBE) So this one
is called bûche de Noël,
also called a Yule Log.
It is a traditional French dessert
served around Christmas,
and it's made with sponge cake
that is shaped to look
like an actual log.
- Oh! I see the log now.
And it has a flower on it.
- If you look at my plate,
you can kind of see
how I feel about it.
It's delicious.
And I wouldn't mind if I had
this for Christmas this year.
I'm looking at you,
Mom and Grandma.
- (FBE) All right,
here's your last dish.
- What is that stuff?
It looks kind of
like a doughnut,
and it feels kind of
like a doughnut.
- Is this pan dulce?
- If you turn it like this,
it looks like a seashell.
- It looks kind of like pudding,
pudding and milk combined.
- The stuff on top
just adds flavor to the whole thing,
because the bread underneath it
tastes like nothing.
- That is good.
Kind of tastes like cake batter.
- I don't know
if I like it or not.
It kind of tastes
like warm, melted frosting.
- This is really dry,
but really sweet,
and this is really moist
and really sweet.
Put it together,
extremely sweet and amazing.
- (FBE) These are treats
found in Mexico.
The bread is called concha,
and while it can
be eaten year-round, it usually
makes a presence for Christmas.
And the drink is vanilla atole,
and is made with corn.
It is extra popular
during Christmas.
- Oh. That's
what this stuff is.
I think that's weird,
because corn is for eating
not drinking! (laughs)
- It is so good.
I love it!
- (FBE) What did you think
of these Christmas foods
from other countries today?
- I think that they
were really good.
Most of them
just seemed like
a year-round food kind of,
but they were still really yummy.
And I actually
really like them.
- Some were pretty similar
to American traditions,
but some were also
a little different,
which is good.
I like variety.
- They were just delicious!
And I'd love to have 'em
during Christmas time.
