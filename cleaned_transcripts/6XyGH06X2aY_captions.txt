apparently there are like scratches like
wounds
in my left eye the doctor said i must
have slept with my
eye like half open so my eyes got dry
and then it ended up getting a wound i
woke up and i started freaking out
because i thought it was like a stye
because i first i thought it was an
eyelash that went in so i was like
looking for
it everywhere and i couldn't find it and
then it was getting worse i was like
maybe i'm getting a stye
he just prescribed me some eye drops and
eye medicine
and i should be good by tomorrow but it
still hurts to like keep them open for a
long
time so i have to walk like this and i'm
afraid that people are gonna think i'm
winking at them
so on my way here i was literally like
because i don't want people to think i'm
winking at them that's creepy
anyways i'm going to get my medicine
[Music]
i actually needed like new pajamas and
i think i like this i got these gray
ones
now i'm going to taizo because i have a
few things to buy
i also ended up going with the yellow
pjs
[Music]
i'm trying to put in eye drops whenever
i remember
and also i'm on my way to the nail bar
to get my nails done because
my extensions have grown out a lot and
i'm actually going with hayan today

film over my eye all right i got the
orange bowl

[Music]
[Music]
but it's over when it's over yeah i've
been having my closure all my feelings
y'all
wrote em all these words in my disposal
got this bad thing my disposal
i don't know what to do with it
[Music]
gonna throw this into the washing
machine
heat i haven't bought pajamas in a while
but i needed some like cozy pajamas for
the winter
i was debating between the silk one and
this flannel one
but um this is a hundred percent cotton
and
i have a pair of silk pajamas but i
didn't really like them because
it gets worn out really quickly and it's
so hard to wash because i have to take
them to
dry cleaners so i just went with the
cotton one this feels really good
for the laundry detergent i've been
using rubio's
and then i'll put about like seven drops
of this fragrance oil
into the softener
also my left eye is hurting a lot less
now
thank goodness i also got a record
cleaner
it's made out of velvet yeah i needed
one because i have a lot of vintage
lps as well and you need to take good
care of those
there's a lot of dust on it already it
got
so clean whoa
i like my nails
[Music]
i really gotta clean i don't have time
to be doing this
she gotta love this christmas but it
ain't with me i watch the snow falling
down like it's rack city
back to my hometown back to the whiskey
back to texting all your exes on
so today i'm gonna be repotting these
babies
i honestly it's my first time doing this
so
hopefully i don't mess it up but i
bought new
pots to house these babies because i
thought these
clear glass ones looks really cute
i gotta look it up on google and get it
right
how to repot seven simple steps with
pictures
[Music]

control i wish i had like a backyard so
i could just
do it there
whoa okay i think i can put it in here
now right
[Music]
yeah i'm done with the first one
oh it's so cute love
all right on to the next one
this one's still wet because i just
watered it yesterday
i don't get it why is this one so wet
compared to that one when i watered them
both yesterday
the soil is different is that what it is
ew yeah
[Music]
this is so wild
it's growing everywhere this has gotten
so tall over the years i mean not years
over the months i'm so proud
all right i am finished
oh my gosh how cute
love it love
please girl well also i got this holiday
car from ghani
and this is something you can plant
it has wildflower seeds in it it says to
soak the card in water overnight
then cover lightly in soil water daily
and watch
wildflowers grow
so cool i'm gonna do this thank you gani
do you see the plant it's adorable
okay i did way too much work considering
that i just woke up so i'm gonna make
myself a bomb ass
lunch i'm finally gonna make myself this
fancy canton chili monsieur
flavored ponzi canton like um stir fried
noodles
one of my soundcake listeners sent this
to me along with the other filipino
snacks that you guys saw me soobien and
joan try together
i've been meaning to try this for so
long and i am finally giving it a try
after many many months so
thank you so much for sending this over
i heard that it's really delicious so
i'm super excited okay first i gotta
boil
the noodles in water it's really really
easy to make
my eyes are so little this is
not going to fill me up i don't think
okay time to mix it all up
i should have definitely made two
because this is
not gonna fill me up
i could definitely smell the calamansi
it smells kinda sour
wow i don't think i've tried anything
like this
this is definitely not a flavor you can
find in korean dishes i feel like
i think i was expecting something like
mikoring the indonesian
stir-fried noodle but it's different
well i don't know if it's because this
is chili karamanchi flavored
i think they have other flavors and i'm
not sure what that tastes like now i'm
really curious
but this has a slight kick to it because
of the
sour taste from the calamansi
this is a very addictive taste i like
next time i eat this i'm definitely
making two
or more i feel like i'm doing mukbang so
yummy
if you guys have a filipino smart or if
you guys can get your hands on these
try it
[Music]
