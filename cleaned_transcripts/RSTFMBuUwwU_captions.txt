The British
had agreed to withdraw from Southeast Asia
and the future of its former colonies
was at stake.
Northern Borneo was one of them
They had been administered by the British
for decades.
But for centuries before that,
they were part of the Sulu sultanate.
The Sultan of these islands
had long before agreed
to form part of the Philippines.
And now that the British were leaving,
they were determined to reclaim these lands.
But a year later,
they became part of Malaysia instead.
This caused the Philippines
to break off all diplomatic ties with Malaysia.
Shortly thereafter,
they set up a training camp on a remote islands
to secretly prepare
for a full scale invasion of northern Borneo.
Were they actually going to invade Malaysia?
or would perhaps
a surprise twist of fate prevent
an ongoing conflict.
This is the north Borneo dispute with hindsight.
This story
starts with the Sultanate of Brunei,
The Bruneian Sultan used to administer
the entire coast of Borneo.
But due to piracy, colonialism
and internal strife in the early 17th century,
much of their territory was already lost.
Brunei was now embattled in a civil war.
While its neighbor was thriving,
the Sultan of Sulu was allegedly
asked by the Sultan of Brunei
to send reinforcements.
And as the story goes, he agreed.
As the Civil War
ended a few years later
in the favor of the Sultan of Brunei.
He gifted the lands of eastern Sabah
to the Sultan of Sulu.
These are some of the earliest origins
of the dispute.
the Sulu Sultan now administered these lands.
In the centuries that followed,
They gained notoriety for its acts of piracy.
They would raid
the Spanish settlements in the Visayan area. 
They stole goods and captured slaves.
Turning the Sulu archipelago
into a regional center for slave trade.
the soldiers
used much
lighter and more agile boats than the Spaniards,
making it easy to outmaneuver them.
But this changed
when the Spaniards acquired
much faster steam boats and the pirates began
to lose their momentum.
The Spaniards conquered
some of the islands that used to belong
to the Sulu Sultanate
They still administered much of northern Borneo.
Their actual influence was limited.
The people here had very little loyalty
for the Sultan,
and other lands
were effectively led by another sultan.
the Spaniards in the meantime
tried to do something about these pirates,
and they attacked the settlements
that they frequently used.
The eventually broke
through to their capital city.
And after years of war,
they signed a peace treaty in which the Sulu
Sultanate was formally included
into the Philippines
and displaced
the lands of Norte and Virgil, by extents
within Philippine borders.
But this moment is subject to debate.
The peace treaty that they signed
can be interpreted differently in its Spanish
and in its Sulu version.
And an argument can be made
that the peoples of northern Borneo
never had much loyalty for the Sulu Sultan.
The sultan is after joining
the Philippines, underwent rapid changes.
The Spanish
abandoned the region
after the Spanish-American War.
The Sultan then signed a document
which either leased or ceded some of the islands
to the British.
For this,
the Sultan received a payment of $5,000 Malayan dollars
per year.
he later settled this ambiguity
by signing another agreement confirming
that he indeed ceded the lands.
For this,
he was paid another hefty yearly stipend.
The Spaniards later took control
over the Sultanate
while renouncing every claim to northern Borneo
And the Sultan later
relinquished all of his remaining
political power.
Now it's the mid 20th century.
The sultan
lost its power in northern Borneo.
the Spaniards had left a long time ago,
and the British were now gradually
decolonizing their territories.
This was an opportunity
for the Philippine government
to rekindle their claim.
The president formally announced their claim
to northern Borneo,
but this was refuted by Malaysia.
He based himself primarily on a study
from the U.N.,
which found that a majority
of the people of Sabah
expressed the wish to join Malaysia.
The federation was formed shortly thereafter.
But when President Marcos came into office,
the conflict really heated up
Under the codename Project Medeka.
he collected his military dream team.
the first phase of the mission started
in the early months of 1967.
Marcos Since 17 men
to secretly infiltrate
the Filipino communities in Sabah,
they posed as forest rangers,
mailmen and police officers, their goal
was to convince the Filipinos living there
to want to break ties with Malaysia.
It was a form of psychological warfare
and reconnaissance.
And after a couple of infiltrations,
they felt ready to prepare the invasion.
They scouted several
hundred young men
from the south of the Philippines,
almost exclusively Muslim minorities to train
at the island of Corregidor, in the Bay of Manila
They received training in guerrilla operations
and in jungle warfare,
not knowing what they were training for.
But when they learned
that the objective was to invade
and to reclaim Sabah,
a large number of army recruits
deserted the Philippine army executed
many of them.
This event was one of the main catalysts
of the Moro conflict
which devastated
much of the southern Philippines.
this conflict was fueled by Malaysia,
who supported the rebel groups
fighting against the Philippine government.
If you want me to make a separate video
about this, let me know in the comments below.
The dispute is still very much alive.
On February 11th, 2013, a small boat
with a few hundred militants,
some of whom armed
arrived in Sabah from Tawi-tawi.
their objective was to resolve
the territorial claim to Eastern Sabah,
and they were sent by the descendants
of the Sultan of Sulu.
The standoff lasted a couple of weeks.
There were attempts to solve
this issue diplomatically.
But in the end, the Malaysian security forces
launched a major operation and flushed them out.
The dispute over
Sabah is still very much unresolved.
Indonesia, responded
to forming the Federation of Malaysia
in a completely different way.
