today we are heading to Sohoton 
Cove, Siargao one of the most  
beautiful spots in the Philippines 
let's jump on the boat and head there
testing the ladder it's a little 
bit wobbly if I fall in don't follow
this water only
so we have just arrived we actually have no 
idea where we are but that boat Journey was  
so so loud and we could be at Sohoton 
Cove but I'm not really sure we've got  
to go sign in we're definitely in the area 
yeah but it's a two-hour boat ride and it  
was quite far to be fair but yeah this place 
looks beautiful we're a bit worried about the  
weather though because it did look a bit gray 
but over here there's some blue sky so yeah
so we are just waiting to get on a smaller 
boat to go to the spots around Sohoton Cove  
we've gone for a little swim and it's beautiful 
around here the water's so clear you can see like  
really really far down deep as soon as as far 
as you can see until the light just disappears
don't worry these are stingless jellyfish
this is crazy I've never seen anything like this 
you're literally like bumping into jellyfish  
all the time there's so many around here and 
they just don't sting you it's just like jelly  
right it's the most unnatural thing I've ever 
done here's another jellyfish this is the coolest  
thing ever it does remind me of Curry on a bit 
okay it's so beautiful but it's got loads of  
jellyfish everywhere and you can actually go near 
them usually you would you know run away oh one  
time okay that's a bit weird you could always kick 
them don't you also this is not jellyfish season  
come March there's so many more jellyfish [ __ ] 
like he said there was Millions just all over the  
place it's like swimming in jellyfish it's not 
water so there you go I'm almost out of breath
here's a jellyfish
so we're about to hold our breath for eight 
seconds and go into this cave underwater so  
the guy basically pushes you down and pushes 
you through so I'm a bit nervous I don't know  
if I can call my best friend I've just broken 
my GoPro so I can't take you with us but we'll  
see you on the other side so we went in 
the cave and basically they pushed you
push you through because you have to hold 
your breath but it's so cool when you reach  
the other side yeah they kind of built up and 
I was a bit scared but to be fair if you can  
hold most people can hold their breath 30 
seconds it's not actually that long it's  
just quite intimidating because you can't 
see what's coming for you but when you're  
in the other side it's like emerald green 
and it's so cool I wish I could show you but  
obviously my GoPro and I couldn't bring my phone 
so you've got to come here yourself and do it no
right let's go get some food because 
I am starving I'm so hungry let's go
foreign so guys we just had an amazing Feast of 
all that food as you would have seen we had loads  
of fish rice noodles and fruit it was frozen like 
so much stuff look there's a stingray whoa is it  
Stingray it's not a manta ray I think it's I think 
it must be a sting ray so we're at titican Lake I  
think that's how you pronounce it and there's so 
many jams the rope swing there's like some high  
dive boards as well it's pretty good it's so cool 
after lunch hopefully you haven't eaten too much  
so you don't throw up but yeah you can jump in 
and it's so cool around here oh my God let's go
come on
so we are now heading back to General 
Luna and it is another two hour drive  
drive a boat ride so hopefully it 
won't be too choppy on the way back  
's on the way here it was pretty crazy wasn't 
it the weather looks a bit better now though  
so yeah hopefully it's all good fingers 
crossed let's go back to General Luna
foreign
Cove but today we're doing something different 
we are heading to a cave pool which is supposed  
to be a popular thing on shower Garland 
we're not sure what to expect though here  
we go so we have just arrived at the cable 
it's like six minutes further on than the  
river swing which we did in one of the last 
videos and yeah let's go in you ready yeah  
where are you from from here is it Sahh a 
gau or Siargao, Siargao okay that's good  
to know I think we've been calling it 
wrong shower girl but it's Siargao okay
is it cold oh look at this oh it is a little 
bit chilly oh wow we're going through there  
oh wow this is cool
we're near the exit of the cave now here we are  
start glistening in the water 
isn't it brown bat poo water lovely
for all this cave oh look there's a jump 
spot further on and jump off there yeah
that's one way of swimming faster way this is fun
so we have just finished at the Cave pool and 
honestly it was so much fun you get to climb  
through the cave it was so dark we actually saw 
bats which obviously I couldn't show you because  
this GoPro is not very good in the dark but highly 
highly recommend coming to the cable if you've got  
water shoes I would bring them we got flip-flops 
and a media kind of lost hers I was it's really  
hard to swim in flip-flops as well but the rope 
swing and the jump spot are really good fun as  
well the entrance fee is 100 pesos each and and 
then you can kind of tip the guide as well so yeah
so we've just arrived at kermits for 
dinner and this pool area is amazing  
you have to come try this restaurant 
and also we just tested their new gin  
bar and you can basically choose any kind of 
little things you want to put in it yourself  
so I've just got my seafood linguine with pomoduro 
sauce and it looks so good look how fresh that is  
look what I've got that pizza so Joel's got the 
Kermit Pizza which is like their Famous Pizza
foreign
and honestly those cocktails were amazing 
definitely recommend the pizza kante also  
that food as you would have seen was so so good 
as you probably can hear they've also got a DJ  
in tonight and so they do have DJs in and like 
every week or so so definitely come here and  
check out Kermit so we've just got back from 
Kermit and honestly that was an amazing meal  
but we've had an awesome couple of days going to 
the cave pool earlier and obviously the sirot and  
Cove tour yesterday was amazing it is a long 
way but still recommend going because that  
jellyfish swim was just incredible thank you 
so much for watching don't forget to subscribe  
because we've got loads more Filipino videos 
coming we will see you in the next video bye
