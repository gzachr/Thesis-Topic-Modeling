So many restaurants suffered
during the pandemic,
but one restaurant tour stricted
her business model and found an
entirely new marketed top vegan.
Filipino chef Raina shares more of her story.
Why did you decide to
create vegan Filipino food?
Yes, selfishly was because
of for myself, really.
I mean when I turned vegan I.
I'm like a meat eater, you know,
six years ago before I turned vegan,
and I wouldn't want to miss
out on my childhood favorite.
So really, how I created a menu
was for me and I just got lucky
that everybody else loved the food.
So I I'm my worst critic.
So I created this dishes and I was
like this is not good enough or it's
just not like how I used to eat it.
So I literally did it for me and
I I for some reason I got lucky.
That people loved it as well,
so she refrain and tell us how were
you impacted by the pandemic. I mean,
the restaurant industry really took a
hit that it effects you the same way
we had three restaurants going.
We were struggling already.
It it's restaurant business is really
difficult and I also went some.
I went through some really hard personal
personal stuff last year and I think
it really was the best thing that ever
happened to me because it allowed me to.
Get out of those situations where
I didn't want to be in and it gave
me a chance to restart and reset.
So I closed all those three restaurants
and I came out of Chef Raina and you know,
came out as myself,
which you know it's I felt like my authentic
self came out as Chef Rina this year.
As I opened our brick and
mortar in Brisbane it's
amazing and I think again the pandemic
really has for those of us who made
it through what she just said that
authentic self thing is very important.
So look you really making plant based.
Asian food popular.
Tell us about that.
How has it been received and
where we're going?
You know what's the future look like?
Uh, so when I first turned vegan,
Filipino Filipino food vegan,
I definitely had mixed, you know, reviews.
Of course the vegan community was very
supportive and thank God for them.
They they came and I was
sold out every night.
There was a line out the door, it was.
It was amazing how I was received.
But then also there's the traditional
Filipinos where they come in
and they they cussed me out.
And they're telling me that I I,
it's an oxymoron.
Vegan and Filipino are all about the meat.
And so I I was called a lot of names
and and which is OK with me, you know.
But as soon as they tried the food.
They were hooked and they were like Oh
my gosh, this is vegan and so for me,
I appreciate the vegans appreciating my food,
but when a meat eater says that it's one
of the best things they've ever eaten,
I that that's when I cry on the inside.
That's
awesome and remember Chef Raina,
you know sticks and vegan bones
may break. OK, never mind.
I guess that's not a saying
yet, but it might be so.
