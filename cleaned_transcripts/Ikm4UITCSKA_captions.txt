an actual market and so I'm excited to see what we 
can find and buy before we go there to the market  
that we're actually going to stop by a theme 
park which is yeah Sky Ranch which is about five  
minutes away so hopefully it's open we're about to 
find out if it is or not maybe we'll do a little

behind the Hall of Justice which is the Filipino

marketplace right now and we're gonna head on

coffee I've ever bought at once oh yes oh

because like it creates that friction the 
coffee beans are hot now Salama thank you  
oh wow so there's a whole bunch of like yeah 
sweets and candies we could buy around here  
fresh pineapples oh those are the small 
ones yeah yeah well by your standards  
oh those are huge yeah yeah that 
one looks like a normal size yeah  
guys ever since I got to the Philippines 
there's like fruits that I've never seen  
before like different shapes or different 
variations like I was with yet in a previous  
video and he had yellow watermelon I had never 
heard that in my life we got honey over here  
fresh coconuts don't smell bad but they taste good 
oh what a cut what kind of fruit is it yeah yes
enjoy yeah enjoy
dragon fruit I love dragon fruit yeah yeah we had 
a dragon fruit smoothie which was nice that's a  
massive coconut Market over there and it's uh 
overall like for a fruit market very clean in  
here walking around there's not really like 
any like trash or anything and everything's  
organized here let me look closely wow so 
this is where you said your wife gets the  
majority of her uh like fruits and vegetables 
or just whenever she's here yeah yeah lots of  
Cheaper places to go but this is the more 
practical way to go right yeah yeah very  
good prices here I mean because because if 
we go to the cheaper places what you have to
right right exactly it takes a little bit 
to get here so you gotta have a reason to  
come out here yeah all right and so 
over here whoa that's one Jackfruit  
look at that guys look at the size of this 
that's bigger than my head my hand for scale  
look at how big that is that is insane so this has 
got away like probably 20 kilos or more maybe more  
and how like what do you use 
Jackfruit for like smoothies
eat it raw yeah or you uh you put it 
into the on top of desserts oh on top  
of desserts yeah wow so you can you 
can eat like uh a hundred times off  
one of them yeah definitely but yeah it 
is it is nice very in a maserat jackfruit
Jackfruit yeah so you can get slices of it
oh [__]
very very good do people ever uh do people 
ever buy like an entire one yeah they do  
oh wow they do they they wait first and then 
they negotiate the price wow if they agree on  
the price they cut it in half like that one 
whoa they wrap it oh so she's my she might  
be buying the whole one no she just showing 
you how much it weighs oh okay she is yeah
that one is what's your guess I'm gonna say 
20 kilos 20 kilos okay you know your jackfruit
21.5
and so so that like comes off of a tree 
so you have to like watch if that falls  
[__] oh okay so you don't have difficulty 
in yeah yeah exactly if you have to climb up the  
tree to get that will be able to that's insane is 
this like the world's largest fruit or pretty much
that little fruit in my life
21.68 kilos and so this is 3,000. 3250 so that 
means this thing costs about 60 US dollars to  
get one and uh you know you could probably 
that would take like 20 people to eat it wow
very nice very nice you got to be pretty hungry to 
eat that or you got to be the size of a dinosaur  
yeah delicious that's your favorite fruit  
favorite yeah so these are the 
seeds and you can boil it now
okay it's eatable wow
you get them all out of the Jackfruit directly 
okay first to soften them up then you can eat  
it wow and you eat the skin of the Jackfruit 
too no no no okay you can do you like it okay
wow, it looks looks delicious 140. wow
guys I'm in shock that is such a massive fruit 
I've never seen anything like that before
so that was the uh fruit and 
vegetable market right over  
here it looks like on the other 
side there's the dry Goods Market

things that you get really really tasty uh fruits 
in these areas this is the Meat part oh the meat

cauldron of the soup and then you can 
just see the steam coming right up and
filling that thing right up there oh wow that's 
gonna be a lot of soup for us to drink there  
so yeah they make it in these huge huge cauldrons 
and then you basically order it in these bowls  
where you can share it amongst a certain amount 
of people so we ordered the two to three person  
one there's a four to five there's a six to 
seven so if you're bringing the whole family  
here you can get a nice big bowl of it and here 
it is salamat look at this so This is the bulalo

thing it's a plain one plain wax wow that is  
very flammable as you can see that thing is just 
roasted that's going to keep our uh soups nice  
and nice enough oh we gotta we're gonna full-on 
flame under there yeah it's gonna start boiling  
the soup a little in yeah thanks there we go spoon 
okay oh wow yeah even the Cup's already heating up

gonna do the soup we just had a  
delicious breakfast before this so Salamat Angel
official soft drink of the NBA this is the 
most like uh brightest like the this must  
be the brightest Mountain Dew I've ever seen and 
this is real Mountain Dew that they recycled the  
bottles oh okay that makes sense because it's like 
highlighter color yeah it's cool though I like  
that they put it on top of light bulbs light bulbs 
so it luminates wow yeah well that's pretty cool  
all right time to uh to dig in go ahead
and let's go ahead and get this 
cauldron filled up there toss that there
foreign
that's going to be delicious nice and hot
okay a little more there a little bit 
of that broth to keep it going okay yep
sure there we go oh is this this is
make sure we get you some meat in there not 
too much that's okay yeah any more broth yeah
all right let's go ahead and uh dig in first 
time my friends have been bulalo so this is gonna  
be great I'm excited to try it out all right 
here we go we're gonna give it a shrimp here
oh that smells so good and guys since it's 
a little colder up here it's so nice having  
this fire because it's kind of keeping 
like my arm right here nice and warm  
perfect for this uh this type 
of weather having some soup
that's that's incredible that is incredible 
the so this is what type of meat is this in  
uh this is cattle okay so beef yeah you know so 
this beef is like super super chewy cooked just  
right and it's so juicy because obviously 
it just soaks in the broth of the bulalo
it's a really nice like um taste 
to have like the broth here  
it's like a you know oily looking broth really 
light you know so it's nice to have even it  
on a full stomach they cook it around four 
to five hours four to five hours yeah okay  
so this kind of just sits in there in that 
massive cauldron you guys saw in the back  
there four to five hours and then when it's 
ready to serve it's just nice and chewy and um
I love that that's an incredible soup I would 
give that like a 9 out of 10 soup oh the bone  
there yeah oh no you do the bone marrow I can't do 
the bone marrow that one's for you Ian yeah I'll  
do it later yeah I actually tried the bone marrow 
and I slipped a big there's a bone marrow and I  
don't like um texture that's soggy yeah they're 
like squishy because it reminds I don't know  
yeah but luckily I did just try that's the yeah 
as you guys can see that's a delicacy both here  
in Nepal people love the bone marrow but I wasn't 
for me that wasn't for me so Ian how does this uh  
bulalo uh soup compared to other bulalo soups 
you've had yeah it's different yeah because uh
and is this is this like a type of dish that um a 
Filipino family would cook at home yeah too yeah  
okay so they buy the beef okay yeah they brought 
it they cook it for three to four hours yeah yeah  
flowers the most and then the meat softens 
up including the bone marrow inside including  
that bone marrow yeah then it's ready usually the 
family members fight over that oh yeah yeah they  
love the bone marrow yeah that's that's the best 
part then you know I I had that same experience  
because um if you guys saw when I was in Nepal uh 
Kyle and Medina they had me taste the bone marrow  
and I was like okay it looks kind of weird but 
I'll try it out and then I didn't like it and it  
was a massive piece and they were like whoa you 
got you had it and you don't even like it and I  
was like well next time now you guys can have it 
but it's a delicacy so we just put a little pepper  
in there guys squirt a little of the Limelight 
uh thing and then we're gonna put some soy sauce  
and we're just gonna totally morph the flavor of 
the bulalo and we're gonna see what happens now  
that's gonna be a completely different bite yeah 
mix it okay and nice and mixed there all right
oh I think we're onto something there that 
is really nice because I I don't know what  
the right way to explain it without any of 
that in there I would say sweet would not  
be right but like borderline like could use 
like something to make it a bit more salty  
and so adding that soy sauce and that pepper in 
there just gave it a bit more of a kick to it
just took a bite of that pepper it's not 
as hot as I expected it to be actually
perfect for the soup though oh yeah ever 
since Nepal guys like just a little bit  
of pepper on everything uh or like 
like actual Peppers really helps  
so here's how we sometimes do it but Luigi's 
own actually this is how I do it so I'm gonna  
squeeze that right in there I get full 
of it here and I get one here [Music]  
that I've got the soy sauce oh oh so you 
literally mix it up right in that bowl there
so it depends on your yeah if you want 
more soy sauce because they're less yeah
this
is the chop up the peppers
just to take out the spice yeah
you can stop it [Music] pre-mixed in there yeah  
wow all right well we gotta 
try uh Ian's recipe here
it's got a little thing yeah oh yeah
okay let's get that going that changes 
the color of the brass to be a little bit  
more of a brownish color because 
I think it's gonna taste so good
oh yeah that's nice
with that in there like you can feel the 
spice a bit more in the back of your throat  
and it just gives it a stronger flavor that's nice 
yeah much better like that I prefer it with with  
Ian's a special recipe so everybody does it the 
only so there's there's no perfect or there's no  
complete way to do it yeah yeah exactly everyone's 
got their own touch to it so you know some people  
as Ian was saying you put a little more soy 
sauce maybe put a little bit more pepper if you  
like things spicier calamansi or sometimes they 
put vinegar a little bit oh yeah Filipinos love  
their vinegar on food don't they yeah yeah so it 
depends on your taste bud preference yeah so good
I will say guys the Mountain Dew 
tastes similar but it almost tastes  
like a slightly less syrupy or less 
maybe a bit more diluted version and  
the typical Mountain Dew I've had 
out of like the can for example
I like it though it almost feels like a healthier 
Mountain Dew guys that pepper is so freaking spicy  
um just ate one fourth of one my 
mouth is on fire holy sh that's  
10 times spicier than the hottest 
pepper that I had in the pulp whoa
oh my God
guys my eyes are watering holy 
crap I did not expect that  
because when I had the very Talent of the 
pepper just in a bite before it must have  
not had that much like concentrated like parts 
of the spicy insides that the peppers have but I  
had more of like the middle piece there and it 
just totally lit up my mouth that was amazing
we've got it freshly bagged up there yeah okay
so guys the really cool part about the Philippines 
is Ian's telling me that like everyone's really  
good about never wasting their food so like 
you know he's telling me when his wife didn't  
finish his food he's finishing it you know 
when you're at the table with your friends  
or family someone's always going to finish the 
meals here and I even saw that in uh I wasn't  
filming this day uh but I saw that inside of 
a uh restaurant how much uh McConnell 260.
thank you yeah and so he was telling me that I was 
at a restaurant and I saw a sign and that it said  
basically like no waste policy because at buffets 
they basically just want to make sure you're not  
like filling up your plate and then leaving half 
of it and then it goes to waste so it's uh it's  
cool to see that um things are just like really 
conserved then also Ian's telling me like talking  
about each one of these types of food up here here 
like the tawilis and uh I'll thank you very much
leave that for Angel  
um yeah guys so that was a nice experience having 
the uh bulalo uh very delicious we're gonna keep  
exploring a little bit more of the market maybe 
stop by the theme park and uh and then we'll show  
you a little bit more and that'll be the day here 
the bulalo was a maserately thank you very much  
yes yes we'll be back again thank you all right 
we're heading back this way to get the uh fresh  
kilos of rice 46 uh pesos per kilo so that's 
2.2 pounds for under one dollar here hello
what are those things this is called Suman it's 
a sticky rice so sticky rice I have heard of  
sticky rice yeah so um these are different 
varieties yeah we have white rice and then  
we have from other different root crops wow 
they steam it steam it yeah and then this  
this is the sweet sauce sweet sauce to put on 
it yeah so it's a nice little like uh snack  
tab yeah yeah or coffee very good coffee yeah 
so is it is it eaten for like breakfast lunch  
or dinner yes okay or even dessert or even 
dessert oh okay if you're still hungry yeah  
even though it's heavy I was gonna say I want 
to try it but right now my stomach is so full
all right yeah we're going round two take two 
at the uh Sky Ranch so we just got to the theme  
park here luckily the rain's calmed down just 
a little bit here but we are going to head in
main entrance this way salamat okay  
oh right when I said that guys the rain's 
not uh going anymore literally just started  
to increase but that'll make it a fun time to 
explore the theme park all right right here
hello uh for two people please [Music]
thank you hello
good morning
oh thank you thank you hello thank you
all right guys the nice part about coming 
to a theme park on a weekday and early  
in the morning is nobody's here so if we 
want to do anything there's probably not  
going to be any rides well what are these 
things rent a ride can go cruising on that  
it's like a two-wheeled type of cart we might 
have to try that out in a bit you know it looks  
like some sort of virtual reality setups here 
so at this theme park is is how it works is  
basically you just buy each ride yeah okay let's 
go passport ticket okay no passport ticket then
yeah the coasters closed probably I think 
they're testing that oh they're testing yeah  
yeah just depends guys it's gonna go from uh 
roller coasters to roller coaster water rides  
so just depends on what we want what do 
you think get a game of ring toss going
anybody oh they're small little Rings 
these are going to be hard stay in The  
Cauldron to win two balls okay so we need to get  
this one seems more do what do you 
think Ian you're gonna play this one
me too me too that's why I'm a vlogger
all right let's uh we'll get 
this going whenever she's ready  
for us I guess two balls two out of two 
balls must stay in The Cauldron to win  
so these things look like 
they're gonna be super bouncy
and if you make or is it two balls 
yeah two out of two balls must stay  
in The Cauldron to win no crossfires so 
basically it's not Frost Park like when  
you stand here you just have to shoot there 
you can't shoot on the other baskets oh okay
oh put the cash right here okay
oh
[Music]
yeah
oh that's hard what's the 
what's the what's the uh Secret
all right yes you have to release it low yeah I'll  
release it though then fastest 
two dollars I've ever spent
all right yeah it doesn't seem like too 
many of the rides are moving at this hour  
because the rain that's a bummer yeah guys there's 
one of the roller coasters we'd be going on it's  
kind of like a mini one that goes around in a bit 
of a Loop I'm sure it's decently fast but I don't  
know enough to stop soon if we're gonna get the 
opportunity to uh cruise on it but there's a lot  
of like uh shops here marketplaces looks like some 
food stands to get all like your Carnival type of  
uh snacks that you want you know ice creams we've 
got shakes nachos lots of stuff oh we can even get  
some fresh Gatorades I have literally no room in 
the belly to have any more food at this hour so
we'll try it all right
sir how are you good morning sir 
very good are these things available  
all right uh mug Connell 100 pesos
five minutes
hello can I have one for the moon rock
uh five minutes yeah
right there whatever let's do 
it let's do it for 100 each
all right there we go so guys five minutes on this 
Moon Rock ride you get uh two people on there for  
just under four bucks so pretty good price for it 
and we are gonna go for a cruise all right [Music]  
go for oh
just go around here okay I was 
hoping you could get this thing  
in full speed Ian's I think scared 
you've ever been on one of these Ian
oh
it's kind of hard to control all right yeah 
it goes like probably two kilometers an hour  
guys and when you turn it right 
it just tosses you on the ground
that's kind of nice though I feel like 
we're living in the future right now  
we can go explore this place
oh yeah
[Laughter]
oh yeah
that's good honestly guys it's good they 
don't make these things go too fast because  
I feel like they would like cause some 
serious trouble at these uh theme parks
it's pretty fun to have as like a car going 
cruising on the roads like this hahaha
everyone's looking thinking about getting one 
now anything everybody's curious earlier yeah  
exactly because it's the only ride that's 
operational right now yeah we can choose  
what type of snacks we want guys except for 
the lazy way to get around the theme park
okay long
so we can't go to the other side just 
uh just gotta do circles around here oh
you ever go on the roller coasters when 
you're here Ian no not no not too much
look at it get a proper spin on this 
thing it looks like we can do all the  
rides we're on a bit of a roller coaster 
and then a spinny ride at the same time
we've got we got a funnel Foreigner thinking 
about going on nope yeah I'd say probably five  
minutes on this thing the perfect amount of time 
because since you can't go too far in it you can  
just kind of toss yourself around and uh look 
at look at what you want to go on next but uh  
oh looks like oh there's a moving unicorn come out 
the car we're gonna have to race them I think well
all right Full Speed Ahead
and sometimes I'm wondering if the 
thing's about to roll back on us  
all right we're chasing 
the competition right there  
oh we got another one looks like everyone's 
going cruising we got a horn on this thing
Ian's like what did I get myself into so they have 
a do they still have control of this thing like  
with the remote I think so just in case yeah 
just in case we're going into no man's land  
or if we're trying to see like going on the road 
with it yeah because I think this is for kids so
yeah yeah good point it will take over yeah they 
could easily crash it into one of those stands  
over there I wonder if we can order something 
here come out the car maserat food here yeah  
okay we got Oreos there Ian you hungry for 
some Oreo not really all right hello hello
are these delicious yeah okay which one's 
the best one [__]oh it's got a  
chocolate ice cream in there that's tempting 
might have to come for dessert in a bit oh
we're all out of battery
hello [Music]
what time's up we gotta hop out  
all right well that's what happens 
guys it just cuts out on us all right
what'd you think yeah first 
and last time you'll ever go on
it's a nice little Cruiser if you could take 
them around the park that'd be sweet you know  
take them through the rain yeah I don't think 
so it seems like it's going to be going for a  
while oh we weren't the only ones to go on that 
now seems like everyone wants to go cruising
they're gonna crash that thing
it looks pretty funny though when you 
see that thing driving around because  
it looks like it's just floating across 
there it's different when you're watching  
it yeah yeah now I see why people are staring 
because it does look it does look pretty funny  
especially when you're just 
like this and spinning around
oh yeah when you're actually in it it 
feels like it's gonna like roll over  
but it's actually like quite stable
well what do you think Ian I don't have 
any room in the belly to eat so yeah
so guys well you at least know there's 
a theme park here so if you came on a  
better day than us you'd be able to 
avoid the rain but that just means  
we'll have to come back but the police 
here the most likely police okay long
yeah let's do it oh yes please
[Music]
it looks like we got five new future subscribers  
yeah all right from United States thank 
you thank you brother nice to meet you
nice to meet you Lopez nice to 
meet you all goodbye my friends  
the police yes and and Five New a tourist 
police thank you very much uh really nice  
guys that's the amazing part guys you've seen 
us in all my videos down in the Philippines you  
can go up to any group of people even police and 
they're so friendly so welcoming and uh you know  
those small interactions are probably like my 
most favorite things whenever I go to a country  
if you feel welcomed by anyone you walk up to 
then uh you know for me that's like my favorite  
type overall of uh experiencing you know there's 
beautiful landscapes and places there's beautiful  
things to do and all these things but if you 
got a beautiful culture that is number one  
goodbye kuya so guys we're doing our last stop of 
the trip here and we're hoping that the weather  
clears up uh 23 minutes away which is about 10 
kilometers uh we will get over there and we shall  
take you guys with thank you guys we're coming 
across one of the most famous Starbucks here in  
the world which as you can see the reason why 
it's so famous isn't because it's Starbucks  
it's because this Starbucks has an incredible 
view but I will tell you Starbucks every  
Starbucks I've seen now in the Philippines is 
always packed so Filipino people without even  
me asking the question I can confidently make 
the statement that they love Starbucks here  
you like this I mean how could you not 
you know you know I mean the whole parking  
lot guys is full on a rainy day you know good 
spot to work on your laptop hang out for a bit  
and here we are guys at the world's 
most beautiful Starbucks viewpoint
oh wow look at this right down into the jungle 
we even have a helicopter pad down there I'm  
not sure what that space is used for but there's 
like some uh cool looking Village right down there  
all along here and then just looking right out 
into here there's the volcano just kind of from  
a different perspective here and wow you can 
actually see look at that bamboo that is pretty  
tall already is it true that bamboo grows like a 
certain amount per day like I don't know like six  
inches or something yeah they go faster yeah 
wow and what is that uh do you have any idea  
what that building is down there that has the uh 
helicopter pad it's like a jail I have no idea
some sort of uh it's a really unique I mean 
it's in the shape of a you hard to tell  
so yeah guys those are the views right over here 
and it's a super modern Starbucks like a Starbucks  
aside from the views you won't really see too 
many of them like this modern because I mean look  
at this first of all we've got two floors we've 
got one floor people all down there hanging out  
hello we've got kuya's down there waving to 
us and then up here we have an outdoor patio  
with a lot of seating and then the entire inside 
Area to have a coffee and then another patio on  
the side so that just goes to show you how many 
people this Starbucks can hold I think even this  
parking lot is part of it as well so that means 
there is literally multiple levels of parking for  
this massive Starbucks I think this could be one 
of the largest Starbucks I've ever been to in my  
life and you're going to be shocked because 
I'm not even stopping for a coffee right now  
unless Ian you want a coffee no or 
a hot chocolate I'm good yeah okay  
there's a park here well the people of spark 
are you gonna pass by it okay sweet later  
see because I was showing you that the 
parking is multiple levels and then even  
here there's bike parking here there's 
tuk-tuk or um tricycle parking on this  
the level that's crazy wow that just goes to 
show you how popular of Starbucks that is
thank you kuya and the sun's coming out hopefully 
it stays we shall see so this area over here it's  
pretty busy is there like a school yes 
okay yeah I was gonna say it seems like  
it's a bunch of kids outside walking around this 
area a lot of picking up and dropping off people
oh because that's cool high school or how does it 
work in the Philippines is there like grade school  
middle school-high school or yeah so uh grade 
school is up to grade six middle school so two  
grade seven eight then Junior High School is 9 
10 senior high schools 11 12. okay so it's pretty  
similar almost the same as the only recently they 
did that oh really okay but for the longest time  
I did not pass Ed uh grade 11-12. like uh before 
it used to be all the same school yeah so it's a  
great School of the grade six and then High School 
okay directed High School yeah and then College
okay so we're arriving right now to cross 
winds uh and right when you walk in you got  
this cool looking like I guess windmills type 
of structure coffee project you can just tell  
by the name and the design of that coffee 
shop it's got incredibly delicious coffee  
so if you want another option then 
Starbucks this is your option here

Colorado of the Philippines you know like we're

seen and we have the Christmas Market right here

and fair Gardens so it's a small little like Fair  
area where it looks like there's maybe another 
coffee shop yeah just so much Napa sign
