we explore the history and culture in chinatown  
welcome to chinatown

don't hate me but i'm going to skip this one 
binondo the oldest chinatown in the world  
and like many other chinatowns who became more of 
a duties attraction binomial is as real as it gets  
you will see filipino chinese continue to work 
and live here with all the joys the sounds and  
the dead of a typical third world town but the 
food the food is what keeps bringing people here  
over and over again you need to come visit 
binondo on an empty stomach when it comes to  
traditional chinese delicacies and b teen is the 
spot you wanna be now i'm gonna go and grab some  
and they have an assortment of traditional flavors 
you would want to add them more to your cart
moon cakes are about moon watching and lunar 
appreciation they symbolize the full moon and  
they're usually eaten in small wedges accompanied 
by tea you can probably find them nowadays in your  
country too well and after all the sweetness 
there's a little surprise inside in the middle  
i wasn't expecting this one a bean filled 
pastry and a favorite gift for families  
we've got the custard one now this is an 
angel's delight and now for the [ __ ] one  
it tastes like it's made out of a rude vegetable 
this one the custard one is definitely my favorite  
you still hungry let's go 
find chinatown's hidden gems
you know i'd be shocked if you don't 
like an egg custard because i love  
that custard it's still warm which is great
wow crispy it's like a sweet scrambled 
egg when it's still warm deep fried banana
wow lots of things are sweet here i 
think nelly this one's just topped it wow
if you ask a local where to find 
a traditional chinese restaurant  
binondo is a surefire answer and this one is 
right next to the canal but that's the beauty of  
it isn't it the recommended dish here is garlic 
frog legs and i'm gonna have a portion of them  
excuse me do you have your garlic froglets yeah 
you have that okay i'm gonna have one person  
don't hate me but i'm gonna skip this one
delicious absolutely freaking delicious okay 
i guess i need to try it now my only concern  
is where they get the frogs from it's actually 
alright it's like chicken a bit of fish to it
it's a hot bun part of the dim sum cuisine 
but this one's slightly fried at the bottom to  
have this crispy finish
this is turning so good okay i can't have all 
the fun on this one this one looks delicious  
so i love steamed buns and the 
meat and the pork inside it  
a little crispiness in the back yeah 
this uh this is my favorite so far guys
see these big fried sweet tasty sticks 
that's a chinese donut i'm gonna get one
i managed to find out the name of this 
crazy donut it's called biko or utau  
chinese donut yes beautiful 
it's the first time i tried it
these lovely gentlemen just say that 
they usually have it with soy milk  
thank you but this is so crispy and 
to my surprise it's not sweet at all
when the spaniards were making the 
rules for the humble filipino nation  
they granted the chinese immigrants the privilege 
to govern themselves the chinese continued trading  
in an area just outside the walls of the city 
far enough that they couldn't interfere with  
how things weren't but close enough that they 
could still be monitored by the government
zombae dumplings we actually googled it and 
this place is on guru map it's not a shop  
it's literally in the in the in the window 
you just order it there and we're just about  
to find out how it says open here hello 
are you open which one do you have the paw
how much is it 200 so the minimum order 
is 14 dumplings and it's 200 pesos for us  
and we just need to wait five 
minutes for them to get ready
these dumplings are simply delectable i can 
watch stuff the stuff wrapping them all day i  
don't really like vinegar but i think you're meant 
to have the mood vinegar so i'm gonna have some  
they're piping hot just come out of the window
absolutely beautiful i bet they're still using 
grandma's recipe this is a really modest shop so  
i'm gonna have to assume that these are absolutely 
delicious for people to come and try these
and right they are absolutely delicious
whilst this place is full of culture and 
incredible food there's also a dark side  
just by walking the streets you can feel 
that the energy but you can also feel  
the financial struggle some of these 
amazing people are going through
usually it's the alleyways 
that hide the best kept secrets  
now i didn't get to finish my dumplings but i'm 
sure she will enjoy them more than i will do
there's just something about 
chinatown that i find attractive  
from the charming smaller to some of 
the corners seemingly attached by time  
and so many eating places from grandma's time 
that they're just waiting for us to discover
we've got original fresh lumpy 
it's based on spring roll  
we didn't think we was gonna get one 
they're that good they've actually sold out  
but the lady came over and she said you can have 
one if you like so we've got one let's try it
this is really really good and 
it has coriander so delicious
i think after today we can consider ourselves 
as video foodies if you're new to the channel  
please like and subscribe and strap up tight 
because you're gonna love the next destination
this corner is for the brave souls 
if you're looking for authentic  
fear [ __ ] the street food you've 
got to come find this balloon stand
