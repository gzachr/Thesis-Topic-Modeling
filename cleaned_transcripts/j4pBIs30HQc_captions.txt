[__] my friends good morning and
welcome back to another video here in the
Philippines and in today's video guys we are
in Boracay so if you saw my last video I actually
flew in here met up with my brother and we're
actually like back where we left the video
off we are at the breakfast spot so we're
gonna go ahead we're staying at the uh Hanan
Regency and find ourselves a delicious plate
of breakfast items we've got the Bro right
over here man the myth the legend and we're
gonna get ourselves some morning Chow here
we're getting that protein going my friends
ball ham with pineapple looks like bacon to
me I'll put it in here yeah okay we're gonna
put this thing right inside there yes Victor
so we're gonna get that thing going and probably
we gotta we gotta get a piece of toast going
there too maybe one of these wheat breads
yeah and then I'll do the trick
and there we go we've got the toast there
we've got ourselves an American breakfast
here in the Philippines down here we got ourselves
some chicken sausages definitely want to toss
those in the mix some fresh fish right there
if you want to Chow on fresh fruits are looking
a little lean at the end of breakfast I think
it stops at 10 so we've only got about 30
minutes left or pancake syrup that looks like
what we're looking for
that my friends looks delicious kuya yeah
I know enjoy you too all right my friend that
is it this is going to get us going for the
uh the meal right here and some fresh juices
when I snap my fingers two fresh juices will
show up whoa two fresh juices just popped
right up let's dig in bro you like that we're
gonna dig right into this hash brown test
it out a little food review yeah
yeah the gold fashioned breakfast sandwich
I'm gonna take us right back to the US toss
that thing right up on there this and this
it's going to be heaven right there in the
form of a sandwich
as expected with the buffet it could be a
little bit warmer generally but you know earlier
on the warmer it's going to be but it's got
a nice infusion I think we need a little more
egg though to get that runny feeling that
you want when you're having one of these types
of dishes
mm-hmm okay now now we've got it this is it
guys double layer egg one's a fried egg one's
sunny side up I'm gonna take down an orange
juice
we'll take down an apple juice
two fresh juices down
hash browns not not impressive they don't
have that proper crunch to them the crunch
you get when you get like honestly I always
use this as an example of hash browns it's
not like a McDonald's hash brown it's probably
not a good hash brown
this awesome is good nice warm taste to it
French toast is good we've got a nice doughy
texture to it and the waffles art you're back
with a coffee thank you brother yeah food's
delicious
hmm ings we've got some sort of Music going
on over there
the pan yeah the waffles are good too it's
kind of same with all of them I got the last
ones on the uh on the rack so it could be
a bit warmer but overall I like the doughy
texture to him and
okay pancakes take number one haven't had
too many pancakes that are like thicker than
a pizza tell you that's quite delicious
all right guys we just finished up a delicious
breakfast and here is a nice clear look for
you at the beaches beautiful beautiful Blue
Waters here we've got our good friend here
comotica okay long that's great and we've
got uh yeah just that picturesque white sand
you imagine on vacation along with the contrast
of these beautiful palm trees let me tell
you guys we need the sunglasses on it it is
going to be a hot one here so me and the bro
are taking on Boracay. Are you ready, bro?
There you go you know it bro you guys we're
gonna take a stop back at our hotel so we're
staying at the Henan Regency we've got these
big goldfish down in there hello there goldfish
give me those things it's a big catch right
there bro yeah you getting hungry
see you guys at the Hennan complex they have
like four different places so actually there's
like the Hanan Regency and then the henna
on like three other names and they're all
like one major complex in this part we got
a nice pool area here and really nice rooms
here I think ours is right up here on one
of them so yeah like uh not like any crazy
fancy room but um good for Boracay clean overall
a lot of families here and it's a bit of a
maze to get around this place though and we
have found a room which is 242.
this is the Caribbean the bro we're staying
at it's a really comfortable beds I actually
slept here last night and it's one of the
best nights of sleep I've gotten in a while
I don't know if I was just so tired from waking
up from flying and only sleeping four hours
but pillows are comfortable beds are really
really comfortable and you know you got the
good setup powerful AC which is exactly what
you need when you're out here we've got views
of the pool
hello good morning yeah that is the uh the
place I want to say it's something like maybe
a hundred dollars per night I'll have to double
check on that but um overall yeah nice accommodation
uh plugs are a US style plugs right there
and a TV and nice bathroom that the uh bro
is in right now so guys that is the modern
bathroom right in there so we're heading in
and going to explore boracai you guys so of
course we're going to walk out it is absolutely
pouring outside so that's going to slow us
down but we're going to make a quick stop
at the gym but I'll tell you I do not like
this about Hanan they closed the gym between
12 to 2.
this is such a great time to work out right
after having a bite to eat and it seems like
they've got pretty decent equipment inside
there but I guess we won't know it's about
12:20 now so this is the problem with being
on the islands the weather can be extremely
unpredictable and the weather says all-day
it's going to be 40% but from what I've heard
from other friends it'll come in for a quick
rain like just absolutely pour down and then
it'll be sunny out of nowhere and then it'll
come back so hopefully we'll get that luck
though because today is our only full day
to explore Boracay. Okay lang. Perfect all
right well some people are still swimming
in the rain this is what it's like in Boracay
a lot of the times guys expectations versus
reality oh are we locked out oh no it's open
but
okay all right we got the towels in the bag
and we're gonna go for the walk nice thing
is is there is a bit of coverage from the
palm trees but the rain's coming from the
side there so yeah it's not bad but definitely
takes away from that uh nice picturesque Island
life when you're just soaked in the rain oh
got some delicious street food around here
all right guys well what to do when there's
rain get a massage here so I think this is
going to be the stop right here
okay long comotica

Lori all right we're looking for a really
nice massage for a good price here yeah oh

a couple hours but more of Boracay to explore
thank you very much oh perfect thank you so
much yeah very nice yeah that was great thank
you so much
we've got ourselves in a nice tea to try out
after that massage because it was so so good
honestly one of the uh better massages I've
gotten recently in terms of like the one of
the Styles where they're just running their
hand up and down right on the I guess like
muscles or wherever you have like knots and
that was fantastic that's what really happens
and this is what we call a proper happy ending
having some tea after
um oh yeah you can taste the ginger in there
that's fantastic nice and hydrating
thank you so much take a photo oh let's do
it yeah

body it's ready for anything now you can move
around in all different directions great place
you gotta come see Lori in the squad here
yeah Lori thank you very much nice to meet
you see you goodbye ready bro yep
and it might be time to get some lunch then
seems like the rain stopped a little bit got
the umbrellas out but uh still going enough
to uh stop some of the boats from being out
on the water so a lot of markets all in this
area you get some fresh shirts here all types
of flip-flops and looks like you get your
hair braided there come outside it's tempting
I don't know if it's gonna work for me all
right maybe later maybe later yeah all right
I might be back massage oh just did one and
it was fantastic salamat yeah it's crazy guys
that's just a little rainfall it drops the
temperature here a lot like it's actually
a little chilly with a shirt being wet from
raining before and I guess if we walk a little
bit further my brother was telling me that
it's going to be like less of a busy area
less restaurants more like uh bars right there
on the beach so there's really a lot of different
places you can check out it I mean if I had
more time I'd probably stay in Boracay for
you know like 10 days or so really check out
every square inch of the island and check
out some of these different restaurants and
things like that but unfortunately I had to
cut the camera there for a second because
the noise is unfortunately only have about
two days here oh thank you oh dear Channel
too I'll subscribe guys so we got to the end
of the road here right in front of the hotel
and then as you can see we've got a nice long
stretch of beach we're gonna be going cruising
down for about 15 minutes or so and we found
a nice highly rated place we're gonna have
a lunch I have a meal at right here in boracai
so a cool place to just walk around guys that
is the nice part about Island life is pretty
much everywhere we've been here so far you
can find something else to do and something
else to explore so it's actually kind of nice
that it's overcast today because when I first
arrived here yesterday just sitting outside
you're gonna get yourself nice and sunburned
with how hot it is here in the islands so
guys we got a nice set of Street stands right
here then some of those bars on the water
we got kuya right there comotica okay long
and yeah just a lot of like relaxation places
you got kind of like bean bags to sit down
right over there Sunny Side Cafe looks like
a nice spot to wake up and enjoy a coffee
oh oh we're going here bro
this is it
ah hello comotica
now this is the spot we checked out
I'm gonna
hop on yeah yeah okay long yeah perfect how's
the food here it's good it's good yeah nice
nice
oh this is where you guys went last night
yeah yeah
2 A.M nice that's great all right to you guys
nice to meet you until next time
so guys a little context you might see some
people throughout this video and maybe tomorrow's
video uh actually my brother owns a luggage
storage company that he started about uh four
years ago bro yeah and basically uh if you're
a traveler and you are let me give you a great
example you just arrived to Manila and you
had a great weekend there and your flight's
9 p.m. but you got to check out your hotel
at 11 A.M. and you want to go over to BGC you
might want to look for a place to store your
bags so you open up the Bounce app and you
can locate a place to temporarily store your
bags so you can go and have another full day
of exploring so that's a very basic way of
explaining it but um so my brother's got a
uh part of his team who are out here from
the Philippines so they're doing a retreat
in Boracay and that's how I ended up here
for a couple days overlapping so I get the
pleasure of chilling with a bro plus uh meeting
some of his team members so yeah guys that
was a uh four of 15 of the team members that
join the trip so now we're heading down this
way and I think we're almost to the restaurant
but you can see here just as you continue
down the beach there's just more and more
activities you can do it looks like some little
island here where people are taking photos
and going out on kayaks at this point it looks
like some of the water sports or maybe only
The Kayaks are coming back right now and yeah
that's that's uh what it's like here on an
overcast day in Boracay because if you recognize
these flip-flops I almost didn't realize that
I was like how can my feet are getting uncomfortable
and it's because it's the flip-flops from
the massage place
okay Lang
so yeah they're uh we're gonna have to stop
on the way back get the flip-flops that I
left there so you guys as you can see we've
got a lot of uh Beachside restaurants as we've
seen pretty much this entire walk kind of
gives me uh someone of a reminder of a co-pp
in Thailand obviously different in many ways
but also similar in terms of like uh very
much designed to fit a like seven to ten day
vacation where you just come hang out on the
islands have a couple beers enjoy a lot of
coconuts water sports and many things so it's
it's definitely like uh really nice if you're
in Manila because you can pay like 50 bucks
take a flight down and live here like relatively
inexpensively from what I've seen in terms
of like a moderate accommodation price uh
our hotel at the Hennan Regency you know it's
like I think just over 100 per night for it
hello
and yeah so basically it's uh it's not gonna
be cheap but for a beachfront accommodation
you can expect to pay a little bit more so
yeah lots of uh Street dogs hanging on the
beach right I guess we'd call them Beach dogs
around here and the restaurant we're going
to I guess is on the other side of this mini
mountain right there so we're gonna see if
there's a way to get around it if there's
like a walkway you guys probably can't see
it in the camera but it seems like there's
people kind of trucking around the side of
it guys so we just got on this path right
here so our inclinations were correct that
if we walk along the beach we would eventually
find a path that would get us there faster
than Google Maps when we pulled it up in Google
Maps it wanted us to head back up to the road
and basically zip all the way around but instead
we could get this really like cozy ocean path
to get us to the other side and it's like
I think you could probably even ride your
bikes on here because it's cement and there's
not too many low-hanging trees I think it
should get us all the way there I would assume
that's the purpose of it we got ourselves
two pass okay well what's the password to
get through
is it a hole there or you can take this little
little Bridge oh this is cool nice little
romantic area [Music] all right and then right
around this way oh this is a little spot you
can fall right in if you're not careful oh
and that was to the other side right there
the little hole to sneak through wow welcome
to Boracay officially my friends this place
is awesome all right then it turns into like
this uh Sandy rocky area with a bunch of boats
kind of just hidden right back here but aside
from that there's nothing else around here
looks like there's like some people swimming
and some houses up there that'd be a pretty
cool place to stay but it's very like low-key
over here obviously where we started this
video super touristy a lot going on here you
can really feel like you have the place to
yourself oh it's cool they've got like a comforting
design just boats sitting there up on the
cliffs here's a boat that's just kind of like
the hand railing I guess for walking up the
pathway all right we got a little private
beach over here another pocket once again
like I was saying not as crowded over here
oh they've even got an ATM this is the restaurant
yeah sweet all right the bar restaurant at
Denny Beach so if you guys want a nice little
adventure to get there change it up a bit
come down here
all right Denny Beach find ourselves a table
right over here it's definitely got that Bali
Vibes feel or the island bites I guess it's
a better way everything made out of bamboo
okay thank you thank you chicken curry oh
all right so we've got some delicious foods
here what am I gonna go with Trina nice to
meet you Trina what's the most popular thing
here uh we have this our best seller this is
oh tuna okay pan fried oh okay so a lot a
lot of good seafood here yeah and what about
options for no Seafood
Swedish meatballs okay foreign
yeah that sounds perfect all right and then
a lemonade and an iced coffee please
all right guys we're doubling down on beverages
today we got ourselves a nice iced coffee
right here and lemonade and the Bros got himself
a watermelon juice so you know me when we're
exploring in the whole video series in Manila
I probably had like seven fruit juices a day
that is fantastic
I think Lemonade's probably easily one of
my absolute favorite drinks to have in the
tropical weather there's just something about
it something about that refreshing feeling
as it goes through your body and then of course
an iced coffee that'll give me a nice little
buzz here [Music]
could use a little cream in there but that's
on me for not asking very tasty pure and it's
a lighter coffee as you can see you know like
for black coffee you'd expect it to be like
you know like dark black but this almost looks
like an iced tea at first glance take you
guys for a little tour of the place real quick
so Dini Beach and they're open from 10 to
9 every single day and this is the bar area
hello good good afternoon
thank you all right and I'm back here got
a little more uh what do we have here dining
View Villas so we've got some places you can
stay here toilets back there just looks like
some candles for the uh evening time and I
would assume that's the uh bathrooms for men
and women based on the drawings there Como
Estacada and yeah a lot of seating just to
peer right out into the beautiful ocean view
so I can imagine if there wasn't any clouds
right now at sunset time this would be a very
gorgeous place to be enjoying a nice ice cold
nice cold brew so I've got a couple more minutes
and then we'll show you guys what we're having
for food yeah I wouldn't had pesto for today
but I just I just was craving it all right
and we have the food arriving here that looks
masarap
much look oh yeah yeah just please freshly
crushed anong pangalang Mall Rooks nice to
meet you Rooks that looks fantastic
oh yeah it smells very delicious um all right
let's go ahead and just jump right in here
guys we've got bread there we're going to
taste test that in a bit but this pasta smells
so good [Music] it's that it's hot but that
is Italian wow I would have never expected
that I'd be ordering a pesto creamy basil
pesto right here in Boracay but um let me
tell you it's very good I would give it a
um probably like uh seven or eight out of
ten for pasta that I've had so far in the
Philippines a nice amount of sauce to it decent
sized portion there I think that should be
enough to fill me up good creamy taste to
it honestly I can barely analyze the flavors
because it was so hot when I took that first
bite it burned the tongue a bit
but tasty though indeed could use it maybe
slightly more um pesto in it to make it just
the the pesto taste a bit stronger I'd say
like the creamy mix in there is a bit overpowering
but [Music] Bread's got a nice doughy Italian
bread I think it'll be even better if we mix
that right there in with the basil mm-hmm
[Music] mother up
I gotta add some new words to the vocabulary
here soon guys I only know uh the basics that
you've probably seen as I've gone through
the video series here but uh first first step
when learning a language anyways master the
basics and then slowly expand the vocabulary
how's that one over there bro it's great nice
nice enjoy chicken laksa nice that's a Filipino
special maybe yeah nice guys so absolutely
uh polished off that plate right there just
to give you an idea one of these pestomials
right here on the water in Boracay comes out
to about like just over 400 pesos so it's
about uh eight US dollars so pretty good price
when it comes with bread and then you know
add on a lemonade and coffee in there it's
probably like a 12 meal roughly uh for just
me to eat so you know what you pay for with
uh the island views you can definitely probably
go Inland and Boracay find some Street stands
and get them for a very small fraction but
for the Vibes I'd say it's a great value thank
you very much right very delicious meal here
guys we're going to continue on with the adventure
take the pathway right around and see where
it leads us to all right the pathway continues
this way so this is going to get us I think
all along the edges I don't know if this path
is in As Good of condition you can see some
uh holes wouldn't have been fun to be the
tourists walking over this one this caved
in and I could use some repairs I'm guessing
we're going to get into uh some unique areas
all right we've got some little cave right
over there and then a stair set to go around
definitely seems like a path less taken with
all the stuff that's on the stairwell these
are the places you're not always going to
find on TripAdvisor just going for a walk
is how you find them
all right made it to the top
seems like there's a nice little uh spot to
hang out right there perfect spot for sunset
yeah it seems like these are more like modern
day ruins okay smells like the jungle over
here whoa so there was something down here
that was absolutely destroyed
look at this seems like it was some sort of
structure so maybe a restaurant or a platform
for boats hard to say
I would guess based on how it looks though
that some sort of natural disaster played
a key part in it whoa there's a whole Rock
right there has turned into a mural all right
we made it a little further yeah it seems
like there was some sort of like break they
built here with the cement and yeah there
was a lot of Destruction that has happened
right here as you can see the shingles from
the roofing and what looks to be like I guess
what was once maybe a set of connected islands
with concrete Bridges and they even have like
a stairwell down there if you go swim maybe
pull up some boats so really only the like
the very thick areas of cement Foundation
are what have survived through whatever this
let's say a natural disaster or something
did to it because you can see we've got structures
of a building all the way up the walls here
and they can't be that old drop a comment
below if you can tell me what this is or once
was whoa so the daring could make the jump
I do not recommend trying that because you'll
go plunge it into the water
this place must have been awesome though there's
like tables out there with tiles a nice little
spot yeah probably a concession stand right
there to get some delicious fresh pineapple
shakes wow Boracay West Cove is what it was
once called oh hey look at the foundations
right there looks like basically equivalent
to a some sort of like wood chuck ate the
uh the uh the tree trunk you know you can
see those foundations that has a similar look
to it probably just from a immense amount
of erosion oh look at this we've even got
the old bathroom there there's still a toilet
that survives wow and a staircase that leads
down to I don't know maybe some rooms of the
kitchen basically everything's been gutted
out of this place probably anything that can
be reused whether it's Metals materials or
anything the only thing that is remaining
is it toilet and the walls and a little bamboo
Hut right over there the place is amazed you
got stairs that lead you down to this level
you got a little ramp that leads you up there
like this place must have been the ultimate
beach party spot oh there it is Boracay West
Cove it looks kind of like something like
you'd see in Santorini Greece way back in
the day wow that looks like such a vibe these
trees right here about the only thing that
are standing that still look pretty nice and
then I'm guessing this was the pathway to
get up to the road or to the hotel so just
stay a little higher up here we've got a open
Pavilion here which there's people working
bags for sale so this must be where the commercialized
area begins again because there is a relatively
like newer looking bamboo staircase right
up the road from the hotel that leads to a
nice Beach we're actually trying to figure
out if there's anything further down this
way there is it's just that we can get around
let's try we're gonna try and hike down these
stairs and see what we can find over there
yeah oh who's got he's out of there is the
mini one uh he's like I've been through those
before
oh faster one right under here actually I
haven't felt the water temperature yet let's
check it out oh actually wow that's much colder
than I expected it to be I'd say if it was
hot out right now it'd be a really refreshing
dip
oh Tide's really starting to pick up so yeah
guys didn't seem like anybody else is adventuring
over to this area probably because it's an
overcast day in the afternoon but there are
I think uh still people using this area to
go and post up they got a fishing boat sitting
right out there you got a couple boats docked
up right there I'm not sure if we're gonna
be able to get around but we're gonna check
it out seems like there's a little like sewage
passageway that's blocked off there maybe
not sewage but like drainage and then over
here it looks like I don't know if we'll be
able to get around this
all right well the Bros made it this far I
definitely could use the hiking shoes today
yeah I think that's where the end of the road
is bro
there's a slit and we can go through here
I don't know if I'm down to uh get wet because
I have my batteries in here
okay yeah they don't they don't want us to
get there very easily
right on the other side
yeah it definitely looks like we'll be getting
wet if we go that way bro
yeah
I know I've got the uh a massage flip-flops
really high quality right here from the Mandarin
premiere not meant for rock climbing oh there's
a little opening to go through here tight
little cave oh
some little things just drop ah made it through
all right we're heading back up to the top
all right we made it up to the top we got
some wild goats over there or not well definitely
domesticated whoa seems like there's some
of those are statues so there's a guy that
looks like he's holding a gun next to another
statue and then some goats that are just chowing
on the leaves right there
okay lang maybe in a bit brother enjoy the
red horse all right we're walking through
the locals area right here guys as you can
see a lot of fun going on and this is how
most people get to that beach they take these
uh three-wheelers the tricycles and they take
them yeah or a boat and they basically just
go off-roading through here but it smells
like a delish barbecue over here had we not
have Justina I'd be like let's stop by yeah
look at this guys the all the different [ __ ]
or the roosters are just on stands there's
one there's one there's one they're all just
kind of like running their own territory and
who can bark the loudest [Music] that's rural
boracai for you oh Wesco of an old west Cova
van been repurposed [Applause] yeah well there's
a lot of roosters yeah okay long cute kids

Got'em laughing there.
First like, what's he's saying? Speaking some Tagalog 
oh almost a crash oh go Bulls okay lang
Guys, we're now on the main road here and look
at that we went from basically that like dirt
road to a brand new road and I'm guessing
it's because this road leads to like Shangri-La
and a few other places but um you can tell
that uh this area is a bit less visited by
tourists that's more mainly for locals in
the area with some of the markets they've
got and like local repair shops that probably
service this specific region because we've
walked a little bit further and it seems like
the road must be brand new construction because
this whole area hasn't even been built yet
but we're looking at the Grand Vista which
has seen better days up there hello is it
the local city bus Hop On Hop off around Boracay
local dental clinic too can give you a quick
checkup all right we got the uh all the locals
around here
a little barber shop right there too hello
hello
oh cute little Filipino kids
no card no ride so I guess you could only
get on that if you have a card yeah lots of
these little electric tricycles people take
around a couple buses like this the clue app
is what I guess a lot of people used to book
excursions around here
right on the side of there get up to 80% off
on Borocay tours I wonder if Luke is like
a local uh it is okay wow all right we got
some uh Fresh Markets here I'm really missing
my flip-flops now well look at this guys you've
got the locals there and then right here out
of nowhere comes one of the massive Resorts
and it's just bamboo lining the whole way
to get you up there that's crazy we have made
it to Boracay new Coast this just kind of
popped up out of nowhere Cove one Beach Cove
two three and Keyhole with a couple security
guards they must be blocking something nice
guys it looks like we have located Shangri-La
a bunch of really beautiful structures kind
of built right there into the uh jungle here
of Boracay [Music] kuya mamuti that's great
all right
all right we got ourselves a nice little Cruiser
here yeah
all right we have made it inside of the Shangri-La
Resort
it looks like a whole new world when you enter
in here the definition of paradise wow that
is a gorgeous view
all right we are deep in the jungle now
is the entrance
right there yeah all right we've got the Boracay
Lobby
[Music] um
guys welcome to the uh Shangri-La as you can
see we've got a little island statue here
wedding cakes in there and a uh a grand entrance
so it is an absolute Vibe inside of this place
wow definitely one of the coolest shangri-las
that I've ever seen for sure
we've got the lobby Lounge right here and
this will probably give us some nice views
of all of the property
we got the nice big Christmas tree over there
I think we've got a passageway right out here
bro there we go there's the Shangri-La Beach
down there and this is insane so modern all
right gonna make our way down to the beach
I think it's going to be to the left right
over here uh that might be another way down
well now we took the elevator down to level
one got the health club here could get a quick
gym pump in but right now the beach is what's
on the mind so there's a doorway out but it
doesn't seem to lead to anywhere so we're
gonna see if we can make our way to the beach
down here and here it is a perfected Pathway
to get us over there all right we've got a
uh nice little Fountain pathway leading us
right down here well you can see why this
place is like 540 per night for a room at
this time of the year really beautiful pool
area and just everything's like perfectly
designed in this area right over here we have
finally made it right to the beach got a little
live performance going for the night too yeah
much different Beach than we showed you guys
earlier in here a small little one too from
here to here and a good little vibe we've
got the friends over there looking at us
all right so they're setting up for a big
show
oh we're just taking a look right now brother
salamat so guys that was a quick little stop
right down here at the uh Shangri-La I just
figured we'd uh walk in here see what it was
like show you two very different sides of
Boracay in the last like 20 minutes of this
video so yeah it's a really really nice setting
here got hammocks in the distance great landscaping
and just a lot of areas to kind of roam around
I feel like you're in the jungle yet a very
luxurious version of the Jungle guys this
is the other base that was like a small little
one this one is massive and it stretches all
the way over there and I think it's all part
of the uh Shangri La there's some sick looking
Villas I like the very top up there that's
insane such a massive complex okay so we just
walked all the way along the beach and then
we got to the moving pick area and this is
like a much more modern look like the shangri-lot
you're gonna get like that Hut that like honeymoon
type of like uh jungle feel over here it's
like everything's super modern all the buildings
all up into the distance right there and yeah
honestly both of them have their competitive
advantages probably for me I'm more interested
in the uh the modern side I like that a bit
better than Shangri-La and look at this guys
such a beautiful sunset we're seeing got a
lot of people swimming here at the last moments
and just an incredible view of it glowing
right there all right that is a much closer
look at the moving pick right here these are
amazing must be a relatively new resort because
everything looks like pretty fresh construction
around here and this one does feel a bit busier
than Shangri-La generally from what I my experience
usually moment picks slightly less expensive
than Shangri-La because usually Shangri-La
is like the highest end some of the highest
end hotels you can stay at so I think you
know Movin picks up there in terms of price
and quality but it might be slightly less
okay guys so this place actually my brother
just looked up the average hotel price here
is about 230 so it's less than half that is
probably why it's a bit busier and it seems
like you know visually speaking it looks like
it's got a lot more rooms but that just might
be because this kind of like pops out and
it's built a bit closer to the ocean whereas
uh Shangri-La is kind of like spread out through
the jungle a bit more okay it looks like we're
actually in the uh Crimson now we're not in
the moving pick unless those are one and the
same no different okay
so it might have just confused it guys this
might be the uh the Ultra Modern places the
Crimson we're gonna get a nice view comotica
and look at this views the sun is sneaking
away on us though yeah yeah let's ask our
buddy if we can see hello brother where's
the where's the best spot up here to see the
sunset right here oh over here salamat oh
there we go we're starting to see it a bit
more
and salamat and look at this there goes the
Sun
for us all right thank you very much
and guys I just made it back to the hotel
so thank you so much for watching today's
video we went all over Boracay honestly it
would have been better if the weather was
a bit better because we would have done some
more water sports but tried some good food
today starting out from the hotel over to
the restaurant about I don't know 25 minutes
down the road and then after that got to see
a couple of the cool hotels over there and
yeah we got a nice little look into what Boracay
is like but honestly there's so much to explore
I wish I had more time here but hopefully
I can get at least one or two more videos
before I leave here soon and my friends that's
where we're gonna go ahead and end today's
