now on this channel we might not get everything 
right when it comes to your top 10 videos and even  
on our last video with the top seven golf 
courses in the Philippines because of the  
outlandish amount of comments going out there and 
feedback from the community at large we decided  
to go back and look at the top 20 golf courses 
now within this unbelievable country of golf  
it's one of the most underrated golf countries 
in the world so let's start us off at number 20  
on this list typically of top tents and swinging 
in and we're not pronouncing because that was one  
of the feedbacks Down Below let's zoom on in to 
our number 20th golf course on this list and if  
we're getting anything wrong so far comment down 
below we're using your comments of course is a  
par 68 that stretches 5 152 yards from the back 
tees there's three sets of T's here it looks like  
majority of the holes are par fours and Par threes 
of course is a public golf course and I will warn  
you there's some private golf courses as we move 
forward so take advantage of these public courses  
built in 1986 of course has a rating of 65.6 a 
slope of 122 and it's got driving range putting  
facilities restaurant a bunch of other amenities 
to get you going for your vanagoff and 5 400 yards  
from those back tees arguably as far as you can 
go let's zoom on out so now we can look at number  
19 on our list course is not open to the public it 
is a semi-private but more private looks like it's  
appeared to be more of a military Golf Course here 
executive style stretching 5 5410 yards of course  
has a slope of 129 and is a par 70. it also has a 
rating of 67.2 has a little bit of History being  
built in 1980 the golf season is open year round 
we're able to pull some interesting pictures of  
this golf course throughout and it looks like 
it could be a Hidden Gem there's not too much  
information outside of some of the information 
that we're telling you right now arguably maybe  
even be higher on this list that's why we need 
to use your comments down below to make that  
judgment but so far you can see it's not too far 
from cities and it's arguably a beautiful gun of  
course now let's take a look at our number 18th 
Golf Course for this incredible country with golf  
zooming on in to number 18. unfortunately this is 
one of those private golf courses but as you can  
see right off this is a very unique golf course we 
hope to hit up on this channel it's a part 72 and  
it plays all of that stretching 6600 and 14 yards 
the course has a slope of 123 and a rating of 73.1  
not too much history here being built in 2014. 
this golf season is open year round and it's a  
Gary Player designed course Pinelands is arguably 
the private Oasis on a mountain as you can see  
right now should be a little bit higher on our 
list but that's why we're using your comments to  
drive this conversation of top golf courses within 
this country we got a lot of good feedback on the  
last video and that's why we went back and dove 
into the top 20 here zoom on in to number 17 now  
throughout this country so much good golf so 
many great things to visit of course here is  
a par 72 that stretches along 7 385 yards and it 
plays all that 18 holes listed as a Parkland style  
course now we're going to take a limb and say that 
this is a private golf course based on some of the  
pictures we couldn't find as much information as 
we would have liked on this particular golf course  
but we were able to find some good pictures 
of this course and this is why we put it in  
at number 17. we look forward to traveling the 
country and playing some of this incredible golf  
throughout the country and I want to point out 
this hole right here looks like it could even be a  
floating part four on a lake those are the things 
that we're looking at to bring it over the list of  
the top 20. so this is now number 16 on our list 
we're slowly moving through but we got some great  
golf left let's zoom on in to number 16 here which 
is more of a Pineland style course here classified  
as a resort style course you probably have to 
stay at the resort to play it it's a par 72  
that stretches along 7100 and 21 yards course has 
a slope of 131 and a rating of 74.9 at a couple  
previous name changes throughout its years but 
currently sits at the name right now now I will  
say the course has more history than the other 
ones listed on this being built in 1964. it is  
listed also as open year-round let's zoom on out 
because we're now breaking in to the top 15 golf  
courses throughout the country we're even getting 
closer to our top 10 list that we're looking  
forward to taking a look at let's zoom on into 
another military style golf course there's a few  
of these and they have to be noted because they're 
beautiful we're going to call it a public golf  
course if somehow you can get onto it but chances 
are it's not public but it's listed like that it's  
a part 72 that stretches six thousand six hundred 
and eighty one yards it has a slope of 132 and a  
rating of 71.5 got some good pictures of this guy 
of course but not as many as we would have liked  
to have found of course has that much information 
that we can't find we look forward to maybe even  
playing this golf course throughout our trips 
and I will say the country does have some good  
golf so hopefully we can get out here and try to 
play some of these courses and we can't find when  
the course was built but it's probably you know uh 
maybe 90s let's let's argue but put those comments  
down below if we get anything right we can't find 
that information but let's zoom on in to number 14  
now on our top list we're often not a golf course 
can slap you across the face and that's what this  
course here did at Sun Valley looking into it 
it's public golf course that has an opportunity  
for all of us to play but most importantly 
it's incredibly looking par 71 that stretches
6569 yards for a slope of 121 and a rating 
of 72.1 it's been shout out at our that was  
one of our original golf courses that we might 
have missed on our previous list and now we put  
it back on here to make sure it's counted and we 
shouldn't have missed it because it has a ton of  
History being built in 1964. it's an Arnold 
Palmer design course and it's one of those  
hidden gems that sometimes just sneaks through 
the cracks let's take a look now at lucky number  
13 on this list of top golf courses and there's 
a lot to like here at this course zooming in to  
number 13. a lot of golf located at this private 
Resort doesn't look like it's going to be public  
but we're going to list number one out of two 
of these courses which is a par 72 stretching
7314 yards of course aren't that old being 
built in 2017. it's open year round there's  
a reason why it should be because you're going 
to want to play this golf every day if you get a  
chance to play it looks like it's an incredible 
golf course with a ton of water on it but most  
importantly it didn't break into our top 10 
so it makes you wonder what's going on with  
the top golf courses within this country this is 
a private course so if you get a chance to play  
it or if you've played it as a non-member let 
us know and write down in the comment section  
zooming out we still have 12 more golf courses to 
take a look at on this list of world golf courses  
so let's zoom in in to number 12 on this list 
and if you made it this far it can't hurt to  
subscribe fortunately is another private golf 
courses that we're probably never going to be  
able to have the chance to play but we want 
to talk about it because it's built and it's  
a private course that looks unbelievable in this 
country and it's on our top list so the course  
stretches 7044 yards and had multiple name 
changes throughout its history we don't have  
the exact date of the course bills built in the 
90s it looks like and it also was built by Mary  
had which is a famous goth designer within the 
golf Philippine area now I will note that this  
course doesn't have as much information as we 
would have liked but we could see from aerial  
footage that there is an incredible private 
golf course and sometimes we just don't get  
the information we would like on these private 
golf courses so we're priced out so let's zoom on  
in we'll zoom on out first there's a lot of zoom 
in on this channel but we're zooming around and  
we're looking at number 12 and hopefully we don't 
bring that up again but we're going to take a look  
now at our number 12 on our list let's quickly 
get there because this course is on a mountain  
and it doesn't even look right so let's see if we 
get some good pictures of this we gave it to the  
Sun Valley course here at this Resort now it looks 
like it is public if you're staying at the resort  
so what an incredible golf course it's a par 72 
that stretches 70 and 15 yards it wasn't built too  
long ago being built in 2014. a lot to like here 
with the driving range and another golf course but  
most importantly there's picturesque views on the 
side of mountains where you can lose a few of your  
golf balls and you can see that each hole is kind 
of separated from each other but there's a lot of  
golf here with two courses being listed at least 
that's what we have on our list let's zoom on now  
because of course that we're looking at number 10 
is breaking in our list in half so at number 10  
there's an incredible Northwood Golf Course 
and it's not the one in California let's take  
a look now at this incredible Parkland slash 
Pineland style course it's a private golf  
course then we might not get a chance to play 
in a course but it's a par 72 that stretches  
another seven thousand and 32 yards that's one 
thing out here these courses they play long  
it was built in 1999 as Bermuda grass it's opened 
year round and was designed by Garmin Marsh in  
1999 he had some updates looks like in the late 
2000s we got some good pictures of this course  
and it's very well known within the country now 
you can see there's even more than maybe 18 holes  
here so we didn't provide the best information but 
there's a lot of golf within this facility and we  
hopefully can get that out there but because it's 
one of those private courses hopefully we'll get  
on the grounds and get more information while 
we're there let's take a look at number nine on  
our list as a private slash Resort so there could 
be an opportunity to play here it's a par 72 that  
stretches 6900 and 74 yards it has a slope of 
123 and a rating of 72.5 it was built in 1998.  
it doesn't have too many years under its belt 
but most importantly it was built by Robert  
Trent Jones Jr had some updates by Donald knock 
and also Gary Glenn in around that time look  
like the whole team kind of came together to build 
this private Oasis uh surrounded by a town so now  
you're probably wondering what's going on we're 
getting close to the top eight golf courses well  
if you made it this far hit that subscribe button 
we're constantly going back and updating these  
videos and the proof is in the pudding because 
you're watching that video right now that's one  
of the updated ones let's take a look at number 
eight on our list now it's important to note this  
is opinionated and some of these could even be 
a little bit higher like this golf course here  
it's very interesting and hopefully we could find 
a member on this channel to take us there because  
this is a private course that all together looks 
like there's a couple nine holes we don't know I  
mean it looks like a little bit over 7 000 yards 
for both of these course holes here but there's 18  
holes of incredible golf located on this facility 
it was built in 1997. it's open year round and was  
built by famous goth architect Bob Moore had some 
updates in the late 2000s but it still sits as  
one of the most prestigious private golf resorts 
in the country there's a ton of nine holes and  
maybe even 18 holes there's just a lot of golf 
within this facility let's zoom on out because  
it's taking a look at those type of golf courses 
make you wonder what number seven has to offer  
so now when let's take a look here as we continue 
to go through the country and bring you those top  
golf courses and if we missed anything write down 
in the comment section so here we are at a number  
seven few golf courses here we're gonna have to 
absolutely give it to the Legends courses which  
we had some information on of course stretches of 
6566 meters it is a slope of 136 so it's pretty  
challenging and has a rating of 73.6 it's built 
in 1992 so it's a little bit of history and it's  
Jack Nicholas design course which we do like Tom 
pick was also involved in the designing of this  
guy of course and you can see right off the bat on 
the layout you got some streams coming through you  
got a nice residential area you got a beautiful 
campus for golf with picturesque backdrops let's  
now look at and this course did make our list 
originally so let's take a look now at number six  
so knock knock on the door it's whack whack golf 
club and there's a lot to like here also at the  
course that started controversy on this channel 
we thought it was public it's not it's a private  
golf course and it's one of the most prestigious 
private golf courses within the country a few golf  
courses here we'll have to give it over to the 
West course which stretches along 6 540 yards the  
course has a slope of 137 and a rating of 71.7 but 
look good looking in it's open year round it was  
built by AG AMG worldwide which built some other 
golf courses within the country it's got a team  
of golf Architects and they're very well known 
but look at this it's kind of built within the  
city we got some cool aerial footage on that now 
we're breaking into the top five golf courses the  
original list of top five has now been brought to 
you so let's take a look at the Riviera Golf Club  
another course that has made our list on the other 
video and we have to give acknowledgment when  
acknowledgment is due and with this course you can 
see off the bat something unique's happening here  
but good luck getting in because it's a private 
Resort style course it's a par 71 that stretches  
7057 yards it was built in a time we don't know 
because we can't find much information on these  
private golf courses other than some pictures we 
were able to pull from the internet the course  
stretches six thousand and 522 yards it has a 
par of 72 and it looks like five different tea  
boxes to choose from and the whole number four 
being the most challenging it's been arguably  
one of the best golf courses for most people that 
have had a chance to play it and it might even go  
a little bit higher on our list during these 
updated videos but the country's got a ton of  
good golf so it's hard not to argue with number 
five there let's take a look at the number fourth  
golf course of course that beat that course out 
zooming in now to number four it looks like they  
got two golf courses to choose from we'll give 
it to the mountain course but yet another private  
Resort style course when I say two golf courses 
two nine hole golf courses nine holes in that  
there's only a par 36 with the mountain course 
but we put them together you got an incredible  
golf course it's built in 2012 and it's listed as 
built year round the goth designer was David Dole  
it also had some major updates by Kevin ramskin 
in the late 2012. it looks like they both came  
together to put together some credible golf here 
if you look right off the bat you could see this  
course might even be a little bit higher on our 
list with some of these holes kind of on the water  
very unique very interesting but it also makes 
you wonder what number three has to offer the top  
three golf courses left in the country so let's 
take a look now at that Golf Course yet another  
private golf course now this course one last 
updated video on the top golf courses within the  
Philippines but not on this one it dropped down to 
number third it's a private Resort Parkland style  
course that's a par 72. of course stretches along 
7067 yards with a slope of 139 it's a hard golf  
course and it's a support rating is a 74.4 ton 
of history and that's why we didn't miss it on  
the first couple videos being built in 1995. it 
also is open year round and was built by famous  
golf architect and player Arnold Palmer you can 
see right off the bat that this is a unique golf  
course with a couple hazardous water and then you 
can see it gets a little open here on looks like  
to be the back nine it's got all the amenities 
you need but it's not the number one Golf Course  
so without further Ado we're now looking 
at the number two Golf Course right before  
we sneak in to number one so let's zoom on in 
to that golf course on this list it's private  
it's elite and we missed it before and that's 
because there's not much information on it but  
you could see cannot hide from aerial footage 
it's a Parkland style course that stretches
7117 yards with a slope of 132 and a rating of 
74.9 the course was built in 1994 and it's very  
hard to even get a tea time or involve yourself at 
all with members on the golf course it's built by  
Robert Trent Jones Jr and had some updates by Gary 
Glenn I will say that this course is incredible  
based on some of the pictures that we're able 
to find but it's not our number one golf course  
and a lot of the fans had to do with bringing this 
course here that you're seeing to number two snuck  
through the cracks and now we need to acknowledge 
it so without further Ado let's bring to you the  
number one golf course so far for this channel 
now we might go back and update it but chances  
are we won't so let's zoom on in to number one 
on this list unless we got it wrong and we use  
your comments down below but this was one that's 
been listed as an elite private course but most  
importantly the number one course consider to 
be the gem within the Philippines the course  
stretches a true Long 7 500. and 26 yards from 
the extreme back tees for competition but from  
the frontes it's only six thousand eight of three 
I will say that is not too much information other  
than that it's extremely secretive and there's 
three tee boxes located there the number horse  
hole is number two on this course and I will say 
the front is a 36 in the back is a 36. it's all  
in all a par 72 if you add those both up but 
there's nothing else to add up if you pull  
in some of this aerial footage of this incredible 
golf course now if we got this wrong or you don't  
agree with the list write down in the comment 
section below we cannot address that enough we  
use your comments down below to make updates 
to our videos keep a look out for more videos  
to come we're hitting all the golf courses in 
the world and we hopefully will hit this course  
as well this is World Twilight golfer launch 
control this is Houston we uh go for launch
foreign
