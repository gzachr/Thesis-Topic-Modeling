This is my Vietnamese friend right here.
Please follow him. What do you do?
I travel around Vinh City and I travel
around Vietnam and I think a lot of...
lot of destination in Vietnam, you can
you can go to Vietnam and I go take
you there.
Alright. So this is what's gonna happen...
You're gonna cook today.
Actually, I don't cook so much but I think I can do that.
So he's gonna be cooking a Filipino dish.
OH MY GOD. Yeah oh my god. It's gonna be
really exciting.
I believe that my friend Duc can do that!
it's gonna be a cooking challenge basically. I'm
gonna be giving the instruction how to
cook this Filipino dish called Adobo... Pork Adobo.
Can you say that? "Adobo"
Yeah. 
It's Philippine word? Yeah. It's a
Filipino word. It's easy to cook and here
are the ingredients...
Oh no we're not gonna do that.
And we're going to buy the ingredients now.
we're going to buy from the supermarket
and probably the local market so come
join us.
Alright, so we just arrived in BIG-C Supermarket.
And are we going to buy the ingredients
we're going to use for the cooking
challenge. Are you ready? Yeah I'm ready.
All right let's go. Okay we need some soy
sauce. This one will do.
Alright so there's a lot of... we just need
white vinegar.
Is that vinegar though???
It's NOT vinegar. Is that vinegar?
Is that white vinegar? (Duc speaks Vietnamese) White vinegar? Yep. Rice vinegar.
White or rice? Oh we need
white vinegar. Yeaaah there you go.
That's white. That's it. The thing is
it's too big, like what are we gonna do with... haha
What are we gonna do with the vinegar?
We're just gonna, like, use this, like this.
We're looking for the coconut cream
and it's kind of hard not to understand
the aisles. Normally I would just check
the names of the aisles, unlike here, it's quite
challenging. Alright let's get some pork.
Just grab anything. This one?
It's enough? Yeah. oh that's way too small.
Get a bigger one. Can we get
two of that? Two of that? Yeah.
Duc: Okay? Jake: Alright.
So we just got all the
ingredients here and we're ready to
pay.
There you gooo. So, we got the ingredients already. And we still have to
go to the local market to buy some potatoes and...
Duc: A lof of ingredient here is a little bit strange with
me. Honestly.
Right yeah. It's gonna be exciting how it's 
gonna turn out later.
Alright. We just got the ingredients right
here. That was so tiring!
That was so tiring! That was so tiring! I
lost my ticket in the supermarket oh my
god. Yeah he lost the ticket and then we
had to do a little bit of... I don't know
explanation to the guards.
I think it's the same with the Vietnamese food.
I think I can do that. We're gonna start cooking. 
And now I have onion
garlic and some potatoes here. 
And basil. Two pieces of pork. And soy sauce, right?
White "venegar" Vinegar, vinegar.
Yeah let's start cooking. All right first... you have to
make like a boat-shaped potato... wedges.
potato wedges.  
Duc: Is it like this? Jake: No...but, it's not like that.
It's wedge, like, a boat-shaped potato, like
that like that yeah, and then you have to... It's too big! Yeah.
uhh, no. Oh my god. We can do it with the next potato.
A little bit Vietnamese food and a litte bit Filipino food.
2000 years later. Finally he's doing it properly.
We're gonna set it aside. Let's prepare
the oil in the pan.
Fry it? Fry the potato? Yeah. Is it ready? Yep. Ok.
Jake: I don't know what he's doing but he's
just throwing everything into the pan...What???
Duc: You told me to fry it. And I fry it.
Oh my god. I don't know. 
Eventually...
Your potatoes are burning. OH MY GOD.
Oh my god.
More... Three?
Are you ready for the next step? Yep. 
Saute the onions and garlic.
Jake: Let's see how it's gonna turn out.
Duc: I think it's ok.
Jake: Are the onions translucent? 
Duc: Translucent?
Alright and add it there. That's a lot of meat. Quite nice.
Oh I think it's ok.
Jake: He's very confident with that. Normally it's  ten to fifteen minutes.
Chop it.
Add it?
Haha. You're not supposed to put everything.
Oh I think it's... put everything to it, the smell is very strong... I like this, the basil.
I think I passed.
Hahaha.
So how did you feel about the cooking?
Yep. It's really different.
Filipino food and Vietnamese food. And I can't believe
I can do that. So we're gonna do a taste test.
I think when you look at it, you quite don't like it but...
the smell is really good you know?
Yeah it smells so delicious I just hope
that the taste would be the same.
All right let's try it. So this is the
one without the coconut cream.
I don't know but in the Philippines we cook it for 10 to 15 minutes to make sure that
the meat is tender. This one is a bit tender.
A bit tender? A bit tender? 
Yeah. It's fighting against me.
But it's good.
You use chopsticks very good. 
Wow.
Definitely way way better than one without the coconut cream.
Actually it's a little bit burned. The potatoes. But it's still good.
I think Duc nailed the Filipino dish.
Just a little bit pale and maybe more vinegar next time.
