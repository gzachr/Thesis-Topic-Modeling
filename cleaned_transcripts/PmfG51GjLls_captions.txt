and good morning everybody from the Philippines
in Manila coming out here and I've been looking
for like a local fresh like um breakfast dish
and one of their most like special ones it's
called tapsilo now I I don't know if I'm wrong
so in the comments you guys could see if I'm
wrong or not but tapsilo is like rice it's
like meat and it's like an egg so I'm trying
to look for a restaurant that gives that um
Vibe but out of my partner with me I don't
know where he went until I could smell it
what'd you go I was wondering where you went
so we're gonna get some uh some good tapsilo
and then hopefully we can find other dishes
at this restaurant but supposedly it's like
five stars it's a local area I always see
it busy so we're gonna walk out there and
try to see if we can get some good food and
some good fried breakfast money changers that
way okay so you want to go get money exchange
first okay so we're gonna go get my buddy
we're gonna get a money exchange and then
we are gonna go get some tapsilo for me and
try a local Filipino dish because all I've
been eating over here I'll be honest with
you I think the Philippines hands down has
the best fried chicken I've ever tasted so
far and I don't think anything's gonna be
there from Jollibee to the restaurants I've
been to fried chicken has been like the best
over here so I can't wait to go and try some
local food dishes around here so right now
this is kind of the street it's a Sunday so
it's really chill nothing too crazy right
now um it's not busy but at night this street
alone it's right next to the Avenue is is
pretty packed especially that 7-Eleven because
the snacks over here at 7-Eleven is a whole
different vibe like it's a whole different
thing so if you guys want me to do like a
7-Eleven um I can definitely do a review on
the 7-Elevens over here but they have all
the meats they have food they have everything
you can think of I mean they got Korean restaurants
they got hummus restaurants they got um I
mean they got everything so once we get to
that restaurant I hope you guys are ready
for a local Filipino dish inshallah wali's
Journey you guys just started let's go ready
huh oh you're right wait you don't want to
be on camera no no I don't do I don't smoke
I don't smoke
no no I don't need x-ray vision you're good
thank you nope I'm psych I'm Cyclops I got
this but thank you thank you brother so uh
when you walk around they try to sell you
electric cigarettes and shades but you know
I'm Cyclops so I don't need them but you know
at least he's trying nice guy doesn't want
to be on camera so if he doesn't want to be
on camera then I'm not buying just kidding
but it's all love so now we gotta find and
when you exchange exchange and I don't see
the money exchange it's an old Barber Shop
oh it was an open 24-hour money exchange but
it's not no more yeah it's close all right
and uh the street looks pretty cool they got
LBC they got all the restaurants is that Greek
food right there they even got autogos Greek
food right there yeah I think um is that Shawarma
don't tell me they got Shawarma yeah all right
so coming out here we might as uh oh it's
a Mediterranean like pizza or whatever so
I mean we might try it but I feel like we're
gonna no it's just pizza so I gotta I gotta
have a good Filipino dish you want to go down
Avenue we'll go down all right let's go so
we're gonna go down the Avenue so the hardest
thing is when you're traveling the hardest
thing for travelers is money exchange so for
me luckily the ATMs do work but I highly recommend
when you're traveling uh make sure you get
like a card that doesn't charge you any fees
and you can pull out the ATM I'm from America
so for me the Charles Schwab the Schwab card
is amazing they'll charge you the fees but
at the end of the month they pay you the fees
back so I would highly recommend getting a
Charles Schwab checking banking account um
best thing I've ever had because I can pull
out money with no issues everywhere and they
don't like put holds on it that's what I love
about it so we're gonna go down this street
and try to get oh look at that money changer
24 hours this is the most smallest susses
This Is Us bro money exchanger like I feel
like oh masha'allah they have they have they
have the writing bro I can't some alaikum
yo I'm trusting this one 100 you even got
a donation box oh you know I Gotta Throw Down
for the Masjid I'm gonna throw down hold on
the one thing I love is seeing the the Masjid
so if I see the Masjid I'm gonna throw down
on the Masjid I I think it's always good to
support mosque in other communities so there's
a donation box show the love to the magic
awesome so my buddy's gonna get some money
but as we walk on the streets and uh try to
see the locals you got money exchangers here
you got Baker Deli right there I mean the
deli looks already awesome you got the this
is the main street over here they represent
Bitcoin in the Philippines so remember that
but as you can see they have a lot of stuff
over here they got the dry cleaning and dry
cleaning super cheap so I just love the fact
that we get to connect with people and just
uh just like just the streets alone not everything
is is like it's really like modernized they
cleaned up the streets it's really nice it's
not like it's a high-end place to be in the
Philippines like every every city has its
bad and it's good but it's so far the Philippines
really stepped it up especially like the BGC
area so as you guys can see they have a lot
of food corners and um I might just go into
the bakery Deli I might I mean we might as
well check it out right they got pizza they
got local dishes and we'll see what they got
but for right now I think for me if I go in
there I'm eat something and I really want
like a local Filipino dish so let's hold off
and see if we can get some some local Filipino
dish I know where some good tapsi [Music]
look what empty food Corner yeah yeah okay
I'm gonna try it thank you I believe you thank
you so I guess we just asked and we're about
to go get some uh tapsilo she said there's
food corner so I'm gonna try it out why not
yeah additional right here so you got the
food corner right here and they got Topsy
low so I'm gonna try it one time this is here
if it's actually good but they said it's it's

seller it's it's beef yeah it's beef with
rice and an egg trust me one of this uh strawberry

low so local Filipino dish the good thing
about it is you get to see the people cook
it right in front of you it's kind of great
clean kitchen and everybody's super nice and
how long have you had this shop for sir you're
the owner oh okay okay gotcha so this is this
has been about two years and and somebody
told me about this place they said it's really
good so okay they said the chef with the Kyrie
Irving is good they said don't let him cook
yeah that's it why is suspended yeah that's
why I think it should be him they said it
was him it should have been you so that's
it so we're gonna wait on some good uh tapsilo
and it's gonna be rice it's gonna be this
and then we got oh it's healthy okay so it
says healthy and it's Apple yo spicy sir uh
no no no spicy no spicy no yeah for him spicy
for me no okay so cheers on the Apple supposed
to be healthy let's see
that is interesting so there isn't a lot of
sugar in this I'm looking at the sugar it's
literally nine grams of sugar and it still
tastes pretty good okay that's the beef right
there and you gotta open flame
it's actually uh pretty decent I've never
had that kind of it's it's very refreshing
for the morning it's not too sugary yeah yeah
a lot of water I like that
so we're gonna be eating real good um anything
else you recommend sir how much is the Topsy
though it's 90 95 pesos okay okay and then
what else let me see do you guys have like
appetizers or something no we don't have let
me see what you guys have come on noodles
you guys don't have a lumpia huh I can't find
lumpia anywhere okay so okay and uh so you

is good for one person okay good good is the
chicken is the butter chicken half is that

we're having 14 pieces 14 pieces of chicken
chicken that's half a chicken okay that's
and it's in its Fried Chicken right okay okay

pieces or something minimum 14. I don't think
I can be 14 but I can eat one or two
300 we got 9.95 for Topsy low 95 so it's gonna
be like less than five I think it's gonna
be too much it's gonna be let's try the Topsy
low and then see after that yeah we're gonna
wait yeah we're not gonna We're not gonna
go too crazy like we did the other day with
our Fried Chicken so uh we're gonna wait on
the uh tapsilo and then we're gonna see how
good it is and we'll tell you our honest review
and I'm a little scared for the kid that's
cooking it Kyrie Irving really really worried
about this kid but we're gonna try our best
what's your name
nice to meet you so it's always good in your
name sir Edward Elmer and yours you should
be cooking you look like you can cook not
him you don't have you have the right jersey
eye so that's it so we're gonna try the Topsy
low and see how it is this is local street
food cooking it right now fresh and the kid
is actually just made the egg and we're gonna
see what else he's gonna do I think he has
the beef ready and oh look at that he's got
the fried egg ready look at that I love it
oh Andy got the light for me oh they already
cooked it oh look at that oh this is spicy
for sure yep you could tell that's the spicy
one with the red chilies everybody likes the
vinegar I feel like the vinegar is the local
dish so they got rice they got beef um and
they got an egg so all this together is supposed
to be topsido so I'm really excited to try
this dish uh okay so we gotta get a nice Fork
here we go what's that in there what's this
what's this hot sauce ketchup oh banana ketchup
do people use banana ketchup with this for
egg interesting okay so I'll put a little
banana ketchup on the edge
well for the beef too yeah the vinegar oh
vinegar okay everybody likes the vinegar so
the vinegar is really good on beef I didn't
know that oh there we go and I put a lot but
I'm okay with it so there you go we got rice
we got egg and we got beef top Sello Bismillah
let's try it out so the egg oh when I hear
somebody say next to me I'm happy to hear
that I'm really happy to hear that here's
the meat right here [Music]
yo the the tops alone with the garlic right
garlic oh my God so they have fried garlic
right there as well chili garlic sauce chili
garlic so and then you have green onions yeah
oh yeah I'll try a little bit of green onions
okay yeah
homemade chili garlic okay so we got a little
bit of garlic as well pour that on the rice
you can never go wrong with a little bit of
garlic that's when you know when a man knows
how to eat is when they got toppings like
this so I'll be honest with you this was the
dish that I was looking for for a local Filipino
dish and the meat is really done well so I
gotta admit Kyrie Irving did a good job really
good way to spend it suspended but working
hard I love it um the meat is very tender
there's a lot of flavor in 
the meat [Music]
it's really good how do you what do you think
about it that is really really good I'm very
impressed by the Filipino dishes yeah the
rice the meat all together at once hmm man
that meat is good I think so far Filipino
dish the fried chicken and the Topsy low so
far really really good hmm whatever they put
look at how that meat is so tender you just
don't know it until you try it um the egg
is just in addition to the rice but and just
banana ketchup has really changed the flavor
for me I'm impressed I'm really impressed
what is this right here beef sauce what do
I put this on on my whole dish
oh hell yeah so this looks like beef gravy
I'm gonna put some on my rice I'll tell you
right now this kind of reminds me back in
Hawaii it's called Paris Paris so we got Paris
and we're gonna put it in the rice and here
we go
oh yeah that's the right cup I wish you gave
me that sooner with the meat that's really
good wow
there's gravy we're driving really changes
your rice I can actually put a lot of that
I love gravy when it comes down to putting
it um wow
really really good
all right so when you do the Topsy low I highly
recommend the chili garlic the vinegar and
100 if you don't get this gravy the beef gravy
you're missing out this is really really is
it up
don't tell him though I told him that okay
talking to you yes great job chef mmm really
really good wow
that meat has a lot of flavor really ready
to go it's not over today I will guarantee
you hit up another spot after this and we
have a lot of we have a lot to do today but
this is not the only spot I gotta hit up like
a local good like dessert place I need to
find like a good Bakery and then so far this
has been delicious I'm very very happy with
the meat this is like the morning like morning
hangover cure really good
I got a local Filipino dish now we're on the
prowl for more dishes and we're gonna keep
on continuing so the total through all that
with the most nicest people ever uh that came
out to 230 pesos Which is less than literally
less than three bucks which was two big meals
two juices he gave us a bunch of gravy and
I mean that was obviously like very happy
to try a local Filipino dish and that was
the right people to go to it's not a fancy
restaurant it's a hole in the wall but very
very impressed so now we're off to go get
a fried banana and they say that this is like
their dessert special so it's a fried banana
with sugar on it so we're gonna go get that
right now and see if we can find they told
us it's on the right over here so we're gonna

me ask him where the fried banana is if it's

place hello sir quick question where's the
place for the fried banana the fried banana

first thing I already found what I'm gonna
eat is a fried banana I haven't had one and
I've always wanted to try one look at that

good food I want I actually want like Olivia
real bad but I haven't found the lumpia yet
but I'll definitely do it yeah exactly yeah
I'm gonna try that for sure I wonder if it
is what it is here that's for you you'll be
on YouTube soon okay is that is that lumpia
that's lumpia is it chicken or beef it's not
pork right cheese oh it's cheese okay hello
sir is the Olympia is there just is it just
is oh vegetable oh hell yeah can I can I get
one vegetable
[Music]
uh I definitely gotta try a vegetable one
that's it oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah oh yeah oh yeah hell yeah how much how
much is it 12 pesos okay 12 pesos so that's
an egg roll though there is no lumpy over
there so I didn't know
so we're gonna try some of that 12 pesos just
to get a small amount [Music] gotta look for
some change I don't think I have changed so
I have a look
let me look for it so it costs about 12. so
I gave him 100 and it got a little frustrated
because they're like why are you gonna give
us a hundred over uh 12 pesos you should order
more but I just wanted one vegetable uh egg
roll and then uh let's try it out see how
it is I'm gonna try it in the cup
oh yeah
really good for vegetable egg roll I'm it's
actually really hot I almost burned myself
but the flavor to the like it's not like so
a lot of food over here it's not like too
salty but the good thing is it's not overwhelming
to your stomach where you can eat more which
is awesome so that was that vegetable oh there's
the Moss right there oh no that's not the
mosque over there Christian okay you know
which way we're going
wow
overall best egg roll I've had so far now
we're kind of lost and we're gonna go look
for the major thank you so much and now we're
out to the next races and we're gonna keep
on walking and we're almost there to the Moss
but this egg roll was actually really good
I was actually pretty happy that we got this
I asked him for lumpia but they gave me negro
I don't think it was lumpia that they had
so we're gonna go and check out a couple other
things but there's a lot over here as you
can see it's still packed the streets are
uh just selling everything so we're almost
there at the uh we're almost there at the
mosque so once we get there I'll definitely
see if there's any other good halal food we
can try I know what we just saw and we saw
Oreo red velvet cheesecake I'm definitely
gonna go and try some cheesecake I know you
want some too bro oh bro that's what I'm saying
hello how you doing can I get uh one order
of the uh the Boba oh which one's your favorite
uh
I was looking at the Oreo or the red velvet
cheesecake are those both good okay so let's
do the red velvet cheesecake um I don't want
any sugar okay no sugar uh let's go with the
uh small salad yep yep that's it you guys
have a garbage can where's the do you have
a garbage garbage I can throw that away thank
you awesome so they have all the milk tea
I'm gonna get the red velvet I'm never gonna
say no when I see Oreo or rub velvet today
I skipped on an Oreo and try to grab out of
it so let's see what it's like how much is
it sir 160 for a small red velvet and uh the
man is legendary gonna make it
so I'm gonna give them five and let's see
he's about to make it right now and then we're
gonna see how good it really is and I'll tell
you guys the taste test on the red velvet
but man's making it right in front of you

it was the red velvet cheesecake one um gotta
check out the flavor and see what it's like
all right we're off to the next and we're
mixing this up I messed up I should have shook
it all right here we go
I can't even get anything out of it go it's
not coming out
all right hold on I'm I think I'm being tricked
here hold on
[Applause]
[Music] pretty good
no sugar awesome tastes delicious really good
all right off to the next one while we walk
around Isn't that cool to have a Dragon Ball
Z seat on your motorcycle I love that all
right and we're off to the mosque had to grab
some of boba whenever I see it I've been addicted
I'm gonna try every one of them before I leave
to the Philippines we finally made it oh we
got a Street Barber just cutting hair with
a blade I've never seen that so we are officially
in a Muslim town and you can see like all
first of all the mosque and then everything
over here is halal and watch out for the car
there we go wrong way I thought you were making
me push me the other way yeah I thought you
I was about to fall no this is a Muslim town
so it's very beautiful and they have a mosque
and they're building stuff over here but it's
kind of cool because everything out here is
like very fresh in uh halal food so it's always
good to see like the um the fried food and
everything is halal so um very very nice I
guess we'll go down there and check out more
of the market but look at the beautiful Moss
man it's really beautiful that's what I'm
saying hi hi so that is their beautiful Moscow
here and then this is all of the center of
all Halal towns so it's always good to see
like um some restaurants and maybe some sweets
we can buy along the way it was a man shaving
that guy's head with a razor single blade
I've never seen that and he was going 100
miles per hour and yep I've never seen that
in my life so we're gonna go check it out
see what else they have and um just walked
down this street and this is all like the
Muslim town so I want to buy maybe a potential
gift for like my family before I do get out
of here in off the Philippines but I'm here
for a while so so far this was probably I'd
say this was like the best experience of just
the street food I have a bunch of like stuff
you can buy um I need a garbage can there
it is so the you know as I started drinking
That Boba I did no sugar and it kind of messed
up the flavor to the to the Boba Tea but here's
the streets of what you see and uh I'm guessing
the Muslim town so I wonder if they had like
Muslims they had like some sweets or some
sugars or stuff like that where we could buy
they even got Fried Chicken on the street
they got fish as you can see fresh fish just
caught up oh that's insane and then you see
all the flavors of I mean look at that yo
you already know that chicken is probably
is is probably super awesome you know really
good you can smell the flavor of that when
they make the chicken out here it's no joke
so far every place that we've been to the
chicken has been amazing and you see everybody
just selling everything and it's just been
a great Vibe so far um so we'll see if there's
anything else we can definitely buy maybe
um something we can eat and something we can
drink up because that boba tea kind of killed
the flavor to my body so we'll check out something
else and see what else we find and I could
see like the flavors of like the chicken they
cook everything out here um and you can see
they have all the meat out here that's chicken
they have a bunch of other stuff so we'll
check it out see what else they have was that
was that all of the uh the Muslim Towner I
think oh okay Ramadan oh awesome oh so that's
the outside so should we just keep on looping
around or should we go that way do they have
a do they have a they have maybe some sweets
for us we can have like a like a baklava or
something that would be awesome so we're gonna
check and see if we see anywhere we can get
some like some sweets oh they even got uh
mesban Food Express which is like a Halal
uh Euro place which is awesome they have that
so we're gonna check out and see what else
they have if they have any sweets for us I
love like I love this because it's so calm
and peaceful over here and you can buy a bunch
of clothes and no one really like gives you
a hard time how you doing brother boom so

down the outside and just does the church
and as you can see it's they're doing it but
you see everybody literally standing outside
