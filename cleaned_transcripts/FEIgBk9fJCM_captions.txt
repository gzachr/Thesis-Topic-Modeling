holy crap it's good i'm not a fan 
of this it's a texture thing for me
what's up everybody it's will and jose and we are 
about to go meet our friend nico who is going to  
go take us to try some local filipino street 
food we're excited we've never tried filipino  
food and this is our first time yeah we're super 
excited and let's go see we can find it's here
while we wait for our friend nico to meet us here 
at the market we figured we'd share with you where  
we've been staying and it's this cute little town 
named moaboa yeah this is our first time in the  
town center by the way yeah it's very cute 
we're really liking it um it feels like a much  
smaller town like everybody knows each other 
it's known for like it's white sand beaches  
the snorkeling the sardine run like the turtles 
like all of that type of stuff so of course  
who doesn't want to be there with it also 
the shades are because the sun is so bright  
um and i have light color eyes yeah and light 
color eyes like you know if you know you know the  
sun hits them differently allegedly no it's sorry 
you have boring eyes but anyway yeah we really  
really like it here and people were so surprised 
with how long we were gonna stay here yeah because  
we booked our accommodation for six days and when 
they heard six days they're like yeah they gasp  
just like that or like not even exaggeration they 
they literally ask us why we're saying that long  
like what do you mean why are we saying that long 
and again i i i can't stress it enough the people  
have been so kind to us every single place we've 
been even if we're just walking down the street  
like they they're very very very kind so we 
have not once fell out of place oh i think  
he's going to go you ready that is not nico 
oh it is okay yeah all right that's nico all  
right guys enough of the blabbering let's show 
you some food and try some new things thanks  
for watching like wish us luck man wish us 
luck all right how's it going buddy what's  
going on the legend nico's here are you that's 
okay lots of traffic always in the philippines
that makes sense just dip it in this 
and just eat the whole thing okay
it tastes like a pork rind it doesn't 
really almost yeah i don't mind it  
i don't mind it at all i have another piece 
and you can try it it's like i don't mind this  
at all gotta protect your hand from all the 
oils all right so dipping it in the vinegar
isn't it bad is that it's good it's 
good it does taste like a pork rind  
it's like crunchy for like fresh like 
this is this nico it's a honey rice  
simple special rice and then how do you open 
it oh it's just right here it's drinking pork  
see it's like steamed rice and bamboo right 
coconut leaf clearly i'm not listening  
okay so nico what are we trying here oh this would 
be called grill egg quick quick quill a quick  
point yeah it's quite quick there's no egg there's 
no bird in there right not yet not yet oh man
it looks like a a barbecue beef ball like a 
buffalo chicken bubble chicken ball but it's not  
no the quilt quail eggs taste like the yolk cook 
like they have that texture it's not spicy though  
it's not spicy no it's not spicy it needs to be 
spicier all right then the next one to the next  
on to the next the food so far honestly i'm i 
like it it's just it's one of those things that  
you see but you never try because you think it's 
gonna be some weird outlandish thing not at all
what are you excited to try the most the intestine 
yeah because i've we've seen intestine before and  
it's intestine so it like kind of freaks you out 
right the camera eats first there we go all right
it's a texture thing for me her barbecue sauce 
is bomb as hell though well let me try the  
chicken finger her uh foot yeah the balls 
of like your nails looks like your toenail
oh yeah wait there's a lot of meat in there
it feels like everything else on the 
chicken like chicken there's like chickens
wait
i'm not a fan of this i'm not 
a fan of it i'm not a fan of it  
let me try this and this is just sausage right
this one's good
like a classic oscar meyer hot dog  
any american will eat an oscar meyer hot dog 
so if you ever find yourself in the philippines  
get yourself these little sausages just to let 
you guys know the market is located right here  
at the port you can get anything from your fresh 
meats to fresh produce along with your street food  
right now they're serving us our cow skin stew 
i'm very curious to what they would taste like  
skin is the one thing that i can't stomach 
like fruits i'm a textured knot so like if  
it's slimy or like i'm like but i want to 
try it because it can be very very very good
my eyes are tearing up and it's hot i'm not 
used to eating things are like gelatinous yeah
would i eat it again no but  
it tastes like a noodle that's just 
been a little bit overcooked the soup is
good what do you want the one with natural or 
the one would be the milk all natural natural
this is actually way better than 
any coconut water i've had oh man
i'm with you it's good right
do i like this one it's not as thick like i feel 
like this this almost has a texture of water  
where i don't know why i feel like they cooked 
a juicy pad before it has like a thicker texture  
to it this is and i think i know another reason 
why i like this one better it doesn't taste very  
coconutty it does taste like coconut but it's not 
like oh bur coconut e that's a thing so we got  
the one with milk he talked me into it 29 pesos 
he didn't have to convince me i want to try it
you know what it tastes like it feels like 
the milk is when you have cereal it's like the
don't think about it okay
so we had a small little dinner before the grand 
finale and that is baloo what's the process like  
i don't see makeup uh after the duck laid the egg 
you count the days and then 16 days you get the  
16 days 17 days you get the 17 days and then put 
it in storage so then we can cook it until then  
and they just boil it right yeah that's 
like the definition of farm to taste  
literally literally farm to table so nika when 
did you have your first below uh when i was about  
grade school uh grade four i tried balut 
but i vomit all it all did you really
he's way better let's try the 16 
it's not nearly as uh feathery
sauce salt and sauce
you can peel the white one yeah like that 
and then make it soup and then after the soup  
spill a little bit more yeah yeah okay 
it's okay and then put some vinegar  
good like that we're gonna eat the meat 
more meaty than yours are you ready
just like that
it's good it's like a boiled 
egg you literally just taste the  
yolk to be quite honest with 
you i'm not even mad at it
okay yeah it tastes like a good broth okay 
peel it a little bit put some a little bit salt
that's the whole bert is anything left  
look you can see the bird you kind of see it it's 
a duck i can see it's beach it's actually walking  
oh glad eat me okay eat it all right eat it 
all yeah just do it don't think about it okay
oh my gosh what is that oh i think i bit 
up half of its head did i eat that yeah
all right feels more better 
right that was an experience  
that i don't think i want to ever redo again why 
we're having another one 24 no you're kidding me
all right so if we ever go on amazing race or 
something like that or fear factor we have this  
under our belt think about that you 
see that amazing race we're your dudes  
i'm not gonna lie i'm a little 
nervous but um i can do it it's
inside
it's odd because it has like a it's a duck 
so it's got like meat a meat texture to it so  
i'm a little confused right now my mouth 
doesn't know what's going on okay i can't  
think about this i'm not gonna just eat that you 
can have some vinegar if you feel what i have to
this one's way more potent oh this one 
doesn't have the piece i have to miss does it  
yeah i ate the whole thing yeah you 
ate the whole thing even the yellow
all right bottoms up
i'm just gonna eat it
cheers
good
so this when you're eating it you're 
more aware of what you're eating  
16 days felt like i was just eating an egg yolk 
yeah this one i was definitely eating a duck
yeah you know what
yeah but i didn't chicken out jose what can 
we say today has been quite the experience
