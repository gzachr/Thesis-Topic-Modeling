the Philippines but it's 40 degrees out
almost every day right now so I'm going
to show you guys what we do in these
super hot days first thing in the
morning I go for a run feels so
refreshing to run next to the ocean I
can't do this at all in Tokyo Mike was
doing her yoga behind me I went for a
run just came back and we are trying to
find a place for Michael to do her yoga
and we came across this place which is
pretty awesome
apparently it's not open yet it's open
from May first but the owner was fine
enough to let us just like use this
place for yoga and yeah and I think
she's going to show us around the place
