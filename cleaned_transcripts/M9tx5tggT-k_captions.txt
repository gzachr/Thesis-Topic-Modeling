hello everyone and welcome to a new video yeah 
thank you so we are in the beautiful city of  
manila manila we changed countries love it 
we love this oh already yeah well yeah the  
guys so we changed the country we are now in 
philippines yeah and after sri lanka and india  
manila it's like a blessing it's like a blessing 
we can't find here lots of food we everything love  
it but even in india you can find lots of food but 
we love asian food that's why for us indian food  
is good as well it's good it's amazing yeah but 
apart from that yeah yeah we're really impressed  
because i was expecting a bit more of a same 
style like you know yeah yeah yeah but manila  
is so developed science so many restaurants 
so people are way way more civilized yeah more  
nice exactly i mean it happens many some people uh 
bumping into me and then apologizing you know yeah
yeah and people respecting cues 
and and the traffic as well  
no no honking yeah you rarely uh could hear 
one horn yeah yeah i mean it happens but yeah  
everywhere yeah after coming from india in sri 
lanka it's like yeah and here we find lots of  
stuff because we bought the microphones yeah yeah 
i mean yes well much more cheaper yeah cheaper  
than india or sri lanka but yeah apart from 
that thing is we ended up with our accommodation  
next to mall of asia which we had no idea it is 
that huge it's absolutely huge you can't feel  
me literally there are hundreds and hundreds of 
stores and hundreds of restaurants you know i  
don't know maybe two mile area radius from our 
accommodation so everything we've ate so far it  
was nothing but amazing ten out of ten everything 
we found we had also last evening ramen which oh  
so manila for us it's such a lot of things 
yeah we love it we absolutely love it so  
yeah we came today yeah so now we are 
in the center yeah you'll see here  
this is like more the historical yeah the 
all center yeah yeah and this area we came  
to explore today is the chinatown yeah with babe 
i think you said it's like the oldest chinatown  
outside of china obviously in southeast 
asia probably yeah yeah so let's see what  
do they have for us here yeah let's see we 
do apologize but we interrupt our regular  
program because meanwhile something happened so we 
had to add this part now yeah in this video yeah  
so we were uh searching for another camera yeah 
on your camera for murder to take better photos  
because our old canon yeah it's really old and she 
doesn't really like how it takes for especially in  
low light yeah and the technology advanced so much 
in the last five years that yeah mind blogging  
what how much did he change yeah and i couldn't 
do with this camera because this is on the  
gimbal stays on the gimbal most of the time 
and it's uh yeah we have to turn off the gimbal  
take it off put it back you know it's a hassle 
yeah so basically we were searching for a new  
camera body and we went for the sony a1 but yeah 
in sri lanka in india the prices were prohibitive  
yeah crazy crazy way way too much expensive 
and then today we went to the mall of asia  
we were telling you that we are staying 
close to it and the sony in their store there  
they told us they have one available in their 
main depot yeah yeah yeah and they can bring  
it for us in about two hours and guess what we 
got it so now we have to give them a shout out  
to these amazing ladies that serve us yeah guys

always we are way too early here  
we do believe that action starts here 
in the afternoon yeah and then continues  
for the entire evening because in london 
normally it's like that it's all day long  
but here oh look some street food

there are not many stalls vendors with street 
food yeah only the restaurants are selling  
here is some chicken oh these are like hot 
spots with what with chicken but with chicken  
yeah pot with chicken oh they're looking 
good baby ginger duck hello ma'am don't  
worry we're just looking what what do you 
have here what's that chicken duck that
is some sort of boiled boiled and then maybe fried 
smells interesting i don't know what sorts of  
condiments can you smell it smells like and you 
put oil up there somewhere yeah oh that's nice

after that i don't know oh how much is one portion

no you only sell by whole piece 
that's not okay we want only one  
to try no she serves by peace so no peace no 
peace no no no no only full okay man thank you  
but it's not expensive for them yeah one thousand 
that's like twenty dollars for one dog thank you
okay thank you yeah
so hot
it's good because it's that flavor
thank you ma'am thank you oh it's hot
oh my day guys thank you thank you it's 
good it's so good wow it's flavorful  
so good i like it i like it as well so so good 
and you can feel all the flavors yeah there's some  
all sorts of things going on there we don't know 
what but can we give her some something that she  
gave us this is for you man please please i want 
to please please thank you so much thank you bye
it was so good that's worth buying and 
having it at home yeah yeah for dinner  
by the time potatoes yeah exactly with rice 
by the time you get home it's already yeah  
yeah yeah cool enough to but still warm yeah oh 
it's so good it's good yeah and she prepared with  
so much care yeah i mean she put oil she put like 
who knows all sorts of spices spicy was so good  
but one piece is too much for us yeah especially 
if we don't plan on eating in now yeah duck
oh she wants one
it's good i mean oh good these guys know how to 
make that out of bed they respect food here baby  
they know how to make it yeah yeah we've 
never had since we have arrived something  
that we not to like but yeah everything was 
love everything on the road was love love so  
not too much to ask guys yeah yeah no no no just 
put some effort into it yeah just put some care  
and then yeah because also when we cook at 
home because in india we used to cook and  
we did good food we enjoy it we put our 
soul in it exactly and make it nice and  
so guys when we eat at restaurants yeah yeah as 
a tourist i expect the food to be better than  
what we do at home yeah because that's why you 
are going into a special place dedicated to food  
where a cook a chef cooks for you yeah yeah yeah 
and when then in nine out of ten situations you  
give me [ __ ] food crappy food that you don't 
know how to cook yeah yeah how am i supposed to  
be happy be happy and tell people that your 
country is amazing it's [ __ ] yeah because  
a country is not all about spicy there's much more 
to it yeah there's the people there's the food  
yeah yeah so you have to judge it by everything 
yeah everything exactly the whole adventure  
exactly not just the things which are nice 
and that's it i mean if you care about  
these things because we do yeah yeah we can agree 
that not all people care about food not all people  
care about the people here and they yeah they 
actually yeah they really have zero interest in  
you know analyzing and i don't know maybe yeah 
expressing their opinions or telling the negative  
things that happen to them yeah yeah 
but that's other people we are we yeah  
and this is us what do you say about laundry 
crisis oh forgot to tell you finally finally
we washed so two loads yeah two different 
loads into hello in two different  
washing machines yeah plus drying machine yeah 
plus how do you call that wave conditioner that  
smelling softener fabric softener yeah yeah for 
the smell and for the softness of the clothes  
plus the washing powder yeah so everything  
six dollar thirty cents yeah yeah and then in 
sri lanka and india we would pay anywhere between  
50 yeah it's because of the system that you 
guys have there yeah it was less less clout  
because today uh yesterday we had lost because we 
bought bought new yeah exactly went to wash them  
so in sri lanka or india yeah we would have had 
to pay for that at least thirty dollars yeah yeah  
it's absolutely crazy we hate we hate we hate 
these countries yeah for this reason only  
it's enough for me not to go back because it's 
such a constant pain and such expensive i mean  
how can you explain that it's expensive to 
wash your clothes in sri lanka and india  
then germany yeah are you guys crazy yeah and how 
travelers do not talk about this yeah yeah i don't  
know what do they do do they wash them by hand in 
your hotel in your room sink or how do you guys  
wash your clothes i don't know but it's crazy it's 
oh my oh okay let's stop because yeah i only have  
bad memories yeah yeah yeah so washing doing your 
clothes shouldn't be a serious thought or serious  
problem yeah you should should be like here yeah 
you have your laundry mat you take them there  
uh they don't even need to be attended but here 
they are yeah because you pay for like 20 cents  
extra and they will take them out of the washing 
machine and put them in the dryer for you yeah  
to the sun right to the sun exactly so so you 
don't have to come back you know yeah to put them  
yourself but even if even if they will be fully 
automated we know personnel yeah you put them for  
to ask them one hour you'll be back put them in 
the dryer for half an hour and that's it yeah yeah  
pay five dollars and move on get on with 
your life yeah not looking for you know  
yeah i know and for for one month because 
i asked like 100 to wash the clothes i mean  
100 dollars per month oh that's crazy to do our 
lunches it's beyond beyond crazy and the clothes  
arriving some days not exactly they're all three 
hours exactly this was finished in two hours yeah  
yeah back in slack india usually they'll tell you 
one two three days oh look baby what i found this  
bank rcbc this one you told us 
no babe that's hs hs bc yeah
so yeah now that now that my rent is over 
about the clothes rushing yeah otherwise  
i think we'll land this here yeah yeah because not 
much to see here not much action it's because of  
the hour definitely yeah and also it's sunday 
guys yeah people don't get out uh you know  
that already work now i know necessarily but 
most of them no it's sunday so they should go  
yeah yeah so they should be at home resting yeah 
so that's why i reckon they don't uh they are  
not out they will be in the afternoon maybe kill 
something yeah maybe maybe so then yeah we will  
be more yeah more busy here but 
otherwise yeah i mean even now you  
have plenty choices of restaurants to 
have yeah true true chinese authentic you  
guys saw that well those two they had lines 
like literally dozens of people waiting so
yeah maybe you'll find something that 
we're filming and we can then we'll  
definitely do it yeah yeah okay thank you for 
watching thank you like always take care bye
