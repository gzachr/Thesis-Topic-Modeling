I'm making pancit bihon for my parents today 
we'll leave this in the hot water for a while  
so let's open the door it's 
a beautiful weather today
Pogi
Today instead of lemon i will use lime 
to make the pansit really fragrant  
baboy i'm using approximately 600 grams of 
fatty pork meat i'm gonna chop it in pieces
i'm gonna make this pancit a little bit 
more special i'm adding the pork meat to  
the water i'm gonna boil this for about 
20 to 30 minutes to make the meat soft
i have some beautiful carrots here  
but we also have some spring onions 
here in the garden i've got a few
besides these carrots and spring onions 
we will also use the repolyo some sibuyas  
bawang and some fresh herbs but i'm curious if 
you use any other vegetables for pansit bihon  
let me know in the comments okay i'm cutting the 
spring onions very fine these are really tasty  
these come out of the garden as you 
saw and i'm making them really i'm  
cutting them in small pieces but they 
add lots of flavor to this dish for sure
i wonder how my parents are doing 
at the moment maybe they're already  
gutom :) no i don't think so we're 
gonna bring this a little bit later
now the pork is getting dry quickly 
adding mantika to make it crispy
start smelling amazing
i told you i will make this a 
little bit more special version  
pancit bihon special i'm using this chicken 
stock which i will add to the mixture already  
crumble it a little bit and this 
will give a little extra flavor
what i really like about this dish from the 
Philippines it's so easy to make and also you can  
adjust it a little bit so if you 
have a different vegetable right  
you can adjust it according to your 
taste i will do that by adding one  
sili so i will add this sili it's a little 
bit maanghang but i will add only one i give  
it an extra kick sili goes in fresh parsley is 
amazing i like this one so i'm also adding a few  
but not yet i will chop these and set them aside 
for the last moment first the repolyo goes in
some finishing touches i'll use a little bit 
of garlic powder not too much black pepper  
mixing everything then i'm gonna transfer 
it to two woks okay i'm using two woks today
double pansit bihon
now adding the pancit bihon noodles 
half of it goes here half i said
now i'll be adding some soy sauce to both okay 
just a little bit because there's already salt  
from the chicken stock so i'm not gonna add too 
much i'm really curious to my parents filipino  
food reaction we'll finish this off with the 
spring onions from the garden some fresh parsley
and a little bit of lime juice it smells 
amazing let's bring this to my parents
this is the kind of hobby my father brought 
this from japan in 1927. this is also from  
japan i don't know the year but it's very old and 
this is from asian pottery right yeah yeah asian  
pottery this is from europe it's bavaria porcelain 
porcelain yes and it's a chinese i forgot chinese

is it spicy a little bit but not 
so much and here's a lime oh yeah  
you can add some lime juice on top
also some extra salt if needed 
but i think it's already salted
you have to mix it through because 
maybe some meat and vegetables are

a carrot and repolyo which is the cabbage

bit spicy but not too much fernite not you
