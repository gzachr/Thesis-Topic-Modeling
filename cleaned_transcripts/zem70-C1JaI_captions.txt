Namaste, Salaam Walequm, Sat Sri Akal..
The time is 12 midnight and we are at Mango Avenue...
And here is one special person with me..
Give me high five...
This is Jaika from Philippines...
Hi Jaika... Welcome to Mithilesh Backpacker channel.
Yea..
So she is my follower and she is watching my videos...
Yes I like it.
What you like about my channel ?
I like you because you know... you introducing fellow Philippines.
And showing Philippines is friendly...
Yea that's true.
I am happy and...
Like I am sorry I wan not aware that Mango street is famous for what...
I told here lets come and meet at Mango street
And she was saying... Its midnight and you want me to come at Mango Street
I saids yea... What's wrong in that.
And after that I searched on Google and came to know about it.
Now he's came to know that where we are.
Yea after coming here and watching all over around the
place I came to know that what is Mango street actually.
So Mango street is basically for adult night life...
So...
Ig you want to enjoy your night life so just visit Mango Square In Cebu city.
I don't think that its a right place to come here.
For enjoying night life....
Accordig to me go to clubs, bars enjoy there better than going for adult night life.
I would never suggest you to go for adult night life.
What do you want to say about Indians...
Indians..
Hi Namaste...
Namaste... you know about it ?
Ohh by the way...
Come here Jaika...
By the way...
There is a darkser side...
Because I have lots of friends in Dubai
So I know...
And she has travelled to 35 countries...
Yea..
And she is like a cabin air hostess
And from Frankfinn Institute...
Yea.. so thatswhy I'm little bit jealous also because I haven't travelled 35 countries
I just travelled to 15-16 countries... And she is like 35 countries.
Soon I will also go...
But I am like not working for airlines, I need to pay lot of money for the airlines.
You're lucky.
You too.
Yea... Me too ?
Yes.
Why ?
Because Cebu city is special in Philippines and yoiu know about people here.
Yea because Philippines people are very friendly.
So its like...
Whenever you travelled to Philippines and just go on the
street and say Hi to anyone and you'll make a new friend.
You know... They will always smile to you.
And they will always ask Peso... Peso... Peso
{laughing}
But...
If they ask from me about Peso.. Peso
I will say... I don't have any Peso with me.
He has only 5 Peso... He is very rich.
Yes... 5-5 Peso is always with me.
Rich... I am rich ?
Yes.
And by the way...
Iam not rich... she is rich
Because when I met her she was saying that do you know about this bag...
And...
YSLR... as a cabin crew
And its cost is like...
How much is the price of this bag...
Its 60,000 Peso...
Means its about 1000-1100 dollars
And I was like if you see my T-shirt, jacket and everything its like 700, 1200 Peso..
If you count me whole as everything my phone, my wallet and
everything then also it will be like 10,000 Peso at most.
And she has a bag of...
Can I get this as gift ?
That bag...
Ok.
Really you wanna give me this bag...
No way...
This is Horizon 101...
What is this ?
Mango Avenue...
And what is about that ...?
This is like the tallest tower here in Cebu city
The Horizon 101...
There are lots of people here who are living below poverty line.
So what do you want to say ?
Thye are very needy...
Yea..
But that is the life you know because of the corruption of the Philippines..
That's the reason..
And also you know...
The problem here  in Philippines... They know that they are not
so rich and cannot afford but they always like making babies..
That's the problrm here.
I think if you are the parents
If you know that one child is enough because I don't have job, I
don't have more money to feed my baby and send him to school...
But why they are making more and more babies...
In India also we have this problem.
You already know that India is at number 2 in the
highest population in the world among countries..
First is China and second is India.
So I am not only showing the good side of Philippines,
this is the best country for the people here.
But I will also like to focus on the things that we need to improve it.
Like...
For the people, proper family panning is needed.
Whenever...
And most important things for the girls of Philippines... Don't just trust on the boys
First make them marry to you...And then onl;y go for like kid planning and everything.
Because I have seen like most of the girls going like
love and everything and then after the boy leaves her
And fo the boy also... Don't play with the girls emotions.
That is called Phillipines style...
Yea... That is Philippines style ?
So what do you want to say about me ?
I like your eyes, your noise and smile...
Because Indians have big eyes like me...
{laughing}
And my eyes...
Ya...
Its good.
Ohh really ?
Seductive..
Yea..
Before...
I will not say anything...
I have stopped flirting and everything...If you see my
Russia videos and everything people were saying me flirty...
Don't awake the animal of Mithilesh Backpacker.
{laughing}
I'm reformed now and let me be that way only..
Don't make me the way i used to be...
I was very flirty before...
Hello...
Otherwise my girlfriend will kill me and would say that you are flirting now also...
I need to be...
Ok... Ok..
Respectful..
Behaved..
Behaved..
And I don't want to go with the flow...
{laughing}
Darling you're so cute..
I like you and the way you smile also...
I have an Indian look... right ?
Yes you have an Indian look.
So we can have Indian baby also..
{laughing}
Just kidding... jokes a part.
On the serious note... We have gave a lots of
messages for proper planning and everything.
And...
That's it.
Go for it... Enjoy and come here in Philippines
We will not gonna show Mango street...
Welcome to Cebu....
And most important thing like...
I am not going to show you Mango street because I came
here and later came to know about the reality of this place..
And may be you have time on Thursday can you show me the places around...
Yes...
Because my money is already finished...
So she can afford Taxi and all the places she can show me...
{laughing}
Thatswhy I met her...
Ohh you can pay for my taxi...
You are just using me...
{laughing}
No I'm not using you, you are my follower so you can do for me atleast that much.
Ok... as you say its a friendly thing.
Yea as a Philippinee... I know that people can afford you.
And she is already rich.
We can walk and we will walk....
She wan't me to like a dieting...
Walk... Walk.
♫ Music ♫
You saw this toer...?
Yea...
You can hold it, you can talk to the audience.
Hi..
What should I say...
Anything you have on your mind, you can say it to the audience.
{Filipino language}
Did you understand anything ?
No I can't.
I can understand like...
Do something or....
what...
I only know 2-3 words... like Salamat, Melgita't,
{laughing}
For the people who disrespect the girls
It is for them only.
{Filipino language}
We say Hello as...Kamusta
Kamusta.... , Kamusta Po, Kuya...
'Kumusta po kayo'....that means 'How you are doing' ?
In India we say Napunsak... Napunsak means the guy who can't produce the baby...
{laughing}
It is in that way...
Places you want to tell where audience can visit..
Moil Boil... and Kawasan falls..
If you go to Kwasan falls you go for Canyoneering...
What is that ?
Just search Google that what is Canyoneering...
Ok Google...
Google for it...
Because when I met her she was saying you haven't cover this place and this place
And I was like from last 2 days I was in hostel only, I'm not going anywhere
The she says ok we can go for certain places...
Because here in Cebu city specially foing towards
South and North, there are lots of waterfalls
Island also... Its good.
And that Cebu tower also...
Yes.
Cebu top.
Cebu top is also very famous...
You can see all the views from Cebu city.
And you specially go at night time.
Night time ?
Yea.
And you take a meter taxi, don't take Grab or any else
Meter Taxi will be cheaper ... Its like
No...Its expensive.
If you want to go exactly, you just see on the
highway there are lots of motors going ....
That will be much cheaper.
Ohh my guide... where you have been from so many days ?
{laughing}
Don't take taxi... Because if you go by taxi its
so expensive an you will spend like 600-700 Peso.
But if you ride by Jeepney, it will only cost for 20 Peso
Then after that...
On the main highway you just rent a motorbike
I think you will need to pay only 100 or 200 Peso.
You can see more.
From so many days people were saying that take a
meter taxi and everything will be cheaper for you
And all those people were trying to fool me...
{laughing}
Where were you from so many days, you have to guide me everything that...
This is the way, from here you will get Jeepney and reach there.
Thatswhy I told you if you are going to Kawasan falls no need to take tour guide.
Because you need to pay 200 Peso, so you don't need to hire a guide,
 just follow all the people going towards Kawasan falls.
Ok... That was so important...
You don't need to pay any tour guide..
Thwy will take like 5 dollars..
Yea 5 dollars for 1 or 2 hours...
Yea.
So it will be very expensive, so don't take any tour guide.
Better... I will follow her whatever she said
I will watch this video again and will go there
I will go through Jeepney and it will be like a natural...
Because Jeepney is very famous here, whenever you come here try the jeepney ride.
She is going to teach me something...
What you wanna teach me ?
'Mahal Kita'(I love you)
I already know Mahal Kita...
Ok, what is your reply....
'Mahal Kita Po'.. ?
'Mahal Din Kita'
'Mahal Din Kita'... Ok
But after the video...
For the Jaonna video you want to say...
After watch Joanna video she is saying that I have said wrong
Like 'Mahal Kita' saying...
'Mahal Kita'
'Mahal Din Kita' {Love you too}
Ok.
So...
Love you too.
I love you too... Let's go then.
{laughing}
Let's go Sogo then...
{laughing}
You know what is Sogo here?
Ya I know... I'm a traveller vlogger so I know little bit that what is Sogo here...
Sogo is like a short time stay... Its a good place.
{laughing}
You have been there ?
No I'm not been there.
I have gone there for a video and nothing else.
I just went there for a video nothing else, nothing wrong is there.
Because I need to show the audience that what is Sogo..
So I have been there.
