a lot of people know
filipinos are some of the most beautiful
and nicest and beautiful people in the
world

there you go yes smart talented whatever
i'm not bragging just because i'm
filipino but susie has never really seen
like filipino actors and actresses just
you know japanese um actors actresses
americans
whatever maybe some korean because i
watch a lot of k-drama but today i
actually want to show suzu some of the
top actors in the philippines and i want
to see
you know what you think of it sure i'm
excited i only see that good as an
actresses from jolie b commercial so
i have a high hopes i mean
if they look somewhat like me then you
know
oh no
so we're going to start off first
with the original
hunk
of the philippines okay mr
piolo
pasquale
[Music]
oh wow wait he's filipino yeah
is he mixed i don't think so i think
he's like legit
like his nose are pretty tall
this guy was like wow every
girl
every woman in the entire country every
woman's crush was feeding over this guy
yeah he has like sexy vibes wow
no i'm just saying like in general like
i think okay that's why i i can tell
like why other women are like oh my god
i mean if i was a girl i'd be hot for
him too i mean look at him he's such a
hunk that's great i mean
if somebody like show me this picture
and then ask me
which country do you think he's from i
don't think i can say philippines
he's one of our national treasures
the next one another actor who i think
probably pretty new i don't maybe not
but i've seen him in some dramas or like
some tick tocks i guess but his name is
coco martin
okay
they're very different from the previous
scary so i'm sorry i'm so bad at
remembering people's snakes he has a
baby face
that he does his
nose is very very tall he doesn't have a
filipino nose
like me yeah
but wow
okay
oh okay he looks like zac efron
maggie he looks like zac no he does not
like high school musical wow i think
he's a good-looking okay okay good so
far so good so he's a he's a actor he's
a necklace okay wow okay i want to see
them like acting wow i'm curious are
they like cheesy when they ask for like
it's natural like american
tv shows i think that's another
video that we need to do because i
wonder if people want to watch me react
to it let us know but yeah filipino
dramas are someone though
let's just keep it
[Music]
so the next one is he has a weird name
but i think he's he's you know
i guess uh i can't really describe him
but his name is mr ding dong dantes
sorry is that his real name or actor's
name i have no idea
hi ding
i want to talk to his parents and ask
why you name your kid ding dong but
filipinos have some weird names too a
lot a lot of filipino people name their
kids very
unique names i would say that but alvin
is very typical outside i said a lot not
everyone
okay okay so he looks like uh the first
guy we look
piolo no way
oh it was it no way piolo is definitely
much more handsomer no i feel the same
vibe from him okay he just has that
manly kind of
yeah um to him right it look he looks
like it looks like he's like halfway
half philippines or something that's a
thing like a lot of a lot of like the
famous people in the philippines are
kind of like mestizos this makes diesels
i like that yeah but then in general
like i believe a lot of philippines has
like a different
what blood i mean it makes vladika i
don't know yeah i'm wrong oh yeah it's
definitely that because we're mixed with
a lot of things like i mean like 500
years of spanish rule oh yeah but
there's still certain filipino pure
bloodline filipino and there's some
people that are like you know
mixed i wonder what your blood is i want
to know if you were like 99
filipinos or
something else
filipino
okay but i think yeah he's looking good
next one is one of the newer people
who broke into the list he's one of the
younger guys and his name is mr daniel
padilla
daniel padilla oh my god he looks like a
host
japanese host oh really
you know what i think he looks like he
kind of looks like the filipino version
of harry styles
oh
okay yeah i get it is he young yeah i
think he's pretty young let's see how
old he is he's only 26. yeah he's same
as the agent it's me you know ready yeah
that doesn't give you the right to hit
on her daniel he's probably held like a
model girlfriend whatever anyways i
think he had a relationship with one of
the like top actresses or models or
people with a picture he has a different
face so i don't know which one is his
true face but it's definitely it's
definitely the hair you know he does
have a lot of different hairstyles but
he's definitely handsome he's handsome
yeah
i wish i had his face it came out what's
that mean
what's that mean
wow
stop okay next one is probably one of
the more iconic actors in the
philippines
mr
jericho
rosales
oh hey
he looks japanese majid a little bit oh
but no no not really maybe some some
photos yeah i could see it actually
yeah he's filipino i can't tell oh my
god
like i feel like at this point i'm only
seeing like
filipinos in like tv shows because like
whenever the tv crew goes to the
philippines they go to like rural area
and then you see like i i don't i
shouldn't say it but you know you see
like very tanned um filipinos like
working in the farm and whatever
whatever or like a small bender or not
bodega kind of yeah yeah sorry sorry
store that's what we call it sally sally
store yeah that's what we call like
delis or bodegas in the philippines yeah
so that's what i've been seeing on the
tv show and whatnot so i was like seeing
those like actors and i was like oh my
god like
they're good looking yeah you have me as
an example i know
stop it girl
okay next one
is he's actually a brazilian model wait
what but he's modern
he's a brazilian model but he got famous
in the philippines for like a photo
shoot or something so i think he does
some work in the philippines
but his last name will surprise you what
is it daniel
matsunaga
japanese
his parents i believe is japanese
brazilian japanese oh wow
what is his nationality i think
brazilian oh okay but does he speak
tagalog too i have no idea but i think
he just works in the philippines but the
thing is when i googled top filipino
actors of 2021 he was one of them so i
was like all right let's pop him in the
list wow i mean i can definitely tell he
has a mixed
blood that's crazy yes
daniel matsunaga stripping you
stop
yeah it's interesting so far what do you
think so far the guy has really really
really good facial features as an actor
and i'm surprised like i wasn't like
expect this at all it kind of shows like
class differentials in the philippines
like you know if you're really lucky or
you look good you're born with good
facial features
you can make it out but you know
i'm sorry everyone um why everyone just
