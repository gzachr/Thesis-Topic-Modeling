and uh even here you have construction
going on people are building and
and uh
doing good it's pretty weather today
though
it's a little hot oh look at all those
roasters
yeah they have several roasters
no no fights now right no more fights
you stay a little close to this thing if
you're talking
and then we'll we're just gonna head on
down to the river
they said they have a river down here
right
so we're gonna we are going to
do that
but anyway this is a
typical little filipino community
[Music]
sometimes when i blog i'll just film it
and then when i get home and edit then
then i put the voice on
so i sit i have my home microphone and
i put the boys on that way
yeah it's kind of
fun to do it that way that way you can
script it a little bit
what the river river is over here yeah
okay so let's go down there and then
we'll take her
down there because you're falling down
there oh is it deep
what's the river called i don't know
what's going to eat it
yeah but it's one of those
coming up coming from the mountains a
little bit
[Music]
little dogs everywhere huh
can you get out out here also do you
have to go this way
oh there's the river oh i see yeah yeah
yeah here we see
and that's the uh what what bridge is
that
uh i don't know how it's called the
bridge it's called bridge only
and so is that the highway though
yeah it's highway going i don't know
where it's going oh okay
well it's probably s attacks or nlax
right
so that's cool all right so they uh they
uh
hi yes
it's it's my blog how are you
yeah good so they they uh banked it
with concrete and everything so that's
pretty cool yeah
what are you saying you bought
your country now no no
no that's the river uh they have a
i don't know if you're walking there
because it's so
danger walking there right where
there is it dangerous yeah why is it so
if
if you walk there why is it dangerous
oh yeah yeah no no we're not gonna go
down here
so apparently some people live down here
by the river too right
some people live down here also
okay here we have a packed up jeepney
right so they can get out this way
all right okay that's all i saw
tour this tour in the river
the streets are not
fully developed but
anyway this is the reality how people
live here
in many places including the provinces
and this is actually part of mabolica
city right so
it's uh almost smack downtown
but you go you go to the side a little
bit
and you end up right here
yeah it's hot today sun is out
and uh but that's okay
that is okay
[Music]
[Music]
music yeah it's okay well i
when when background music comes like
that because
i i take it out in the edit oh because
it's copyright right yeah it could it
could uh
it could cause you to have a copyright
strike
but i am when i edit the video
i listen to the music and if it's too
much
then i'll bring it down a little bit and
i'll
put my own music on it oh already
because i don't know how full time you
see because
if i i have vlogging uh they have a
background music
right that's why i copyright my video so
yeah well you you do that but
so for instance karaoke all that
yeah you all get strikes yeah some some
are not bad though
yeah you know because the pro the
problem becomes when you get monetized
and they run ad on that video the money
doesn't come to you
or sometimes sometimes it goes to the
uh to the guy that actually made the
music yeah
and uh sometimes they allow you to split
it so you you split
and uh all right so here we are back
again
he just showed me the river
oh i didn't go down i don't want to go
down to the river
it's a big no but it's a big it's a big
concrete
