What's the most expected of hopping?

Snorkeling after eating

I have to eat there
Curious are locals hopping there much?
But do locals do it everyday?
just enjoy alone
-Philippines is heaven
-I think so 
-so when we get boat
Can we play freely on the ship?
Basic safety regulations should keep
But we can play freely
If you want to dive, you can dive
things can be lost. so they say keep them on boat
Dive and play. And
playing on water and journey on boat
its not end. they cook ramen
-on the boat

The real good thing is when you go to the hopping place
The car picks up when we comes
-in front of our hotel 
-that service
Shouldn't you find your own?
Originally it is but
its better
what should we eat?
I've been to one place, Blue Elephant.
Let's go there together with our schedule.
You must go there. there is awesome
Its rooftop restaurant.
the reason why am i recommend here
Our rooftop restaurant is expensive
You can secure it at a very reasonable price and also rooftop
The atmosphere is good
The food is delicious
Or find a local restaurant
That will be fine
When I used to go, I only went to tourist spots
I went to a place where many Koreans
Or go to a local restaurant that many locals eat
Will it communicate naturally?
You like to make local friends.
Go and make many friends
There are many locals here Manginasal
Like a 김밥천국 in Korea. Atmosphere was same
Is it a franchise coming out now?
-yes it is
And I went Gerry's Grill was
Here sell meat, seefoods also
Taste is guaranteed.
And garlic rice. there it is
We'll go look for restaurants like this.
Somewhere is. but how about you
I
go anywhere and there a lot of people,
if crowded, i go there.  smell good
Its really adventure style
I want to resemble this part
You must eat jollibee
Eat with chicken and rice
I also find and have at least one main dish.
We'll think about it, if you like the schedule, let's go together.
Ok so i ll follow you
end this eat things.
And good thing is beer is cheap
It was so cheap that I drank beer instead of water
It's too bad that I can't drink much
We'll be drunk for 24 hours
We are think about hocance ( hotel +vacance)
must do hocance
hotel swimming pool
What is hocance?
-hotel plus vacance
vacation in hotel?
Eat hamburgers with music
Get beer and drink 
-and swimming
You have to chill and
you can do next plan
Next year we are gonna 30 years old. must chill
When we arrived at destination
Feel the mood even during the day
I have to feel the mood at night
of course
Want to drink when night come
Downtown. Go there and local pub
Or pub where has good music
-ahh good 
-with a san miguel
Because you can drink at night and make friends there
-thats good
-i just excited when i think
Except for the time of sleeping in the hotel from morning till late at night
There's an atmosphere we feel
How many hours do we sleep? 2 hours?
3hours
4hours
 
If you go to the locals, you should get to know the locals.
Then I feel their country
Go to locals and ask "what do you eat?" 
"where is nice place at night"
They know hot places
-just go and ask
-so f4f instagram?
-make friend
-yes friend
enjoy together and go hotplace together
At first.  As a whole
They are kind
When I ask something they answer kindly 
than korean
last one. language?
language is English
-Can i use English there?
All of them speak English.
They have a Tagalog language, but good at English.
So thats comfort
So final one is
We are waiting Cebu for 2 weeks left

-Feel?
Time goes too slow
My heart has already left
Time goes too slow  but
What can I do? Enjoy this feeling as much as I can before I go.
Looking for something delicious or something to enjoy
Hold on. I can only stand it.
