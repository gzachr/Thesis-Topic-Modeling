 
I found a love
 
for me
 
But darling just die right in
and follow my lead
Well I found a girl
beautiful and sweet
I never knew you were the someone
waiting for me
Cause we were just kids
when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up
this time
But darling just kiss me slow
your heart is all l own
And in your eyes you're holding mine
Baby I'm dancing in the dark
with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
listening to our favorite song
When you said you looked a mess
I whispered under neath my breath
You heard it
darling you look perfect
tonight
Well  I found a woman
stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams I hope that someday
I'll share her home
I found a love
to carry more than
just my secrets
to carry love
to carry children
of our own
We are still kids
but we're so in love
fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright
this time
Darling just hold my hand
be my girl I'll be your man
I see my future
in your eyes
Baby I'm
dancing in the dark
with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress
looking so beautiful
I don't deserve it
darling you look perfect
tonight
 
 
 
Cause baby I'm
dancing in the dark
with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass
listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel
in person
you look perfect
I don't deserve it
you look perfect
tonight
