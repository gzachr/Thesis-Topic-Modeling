It´s Now United
Hey, RedOne!
Hey! You already know!
I gotta reach for the life
That I'm living for (living for)
I gotta look to the sky
When It's gonna pour (gonna pour)
And no fear for the fight
When you're about the score
And that's a matter of fact
'Cause when you see me,
You see me, you see me balling
Body to body I hear 'em calling
Yeah
We going up we never falling
Oh, no! Oh, no!
Let's Go! Let's Go! Let's Go!
'Cause this is how we do it
There ain't no other way
You see it how we moving
Love find us everyday
This is how we do it
And there ain't no other way
So we can roll together
Roll together
'Cause we all know
Together is always better
'Cause this is how we do it
Yeah, yeah!
This is how we do it
Yeah, yeah
है कोशिश मेरी जो भी करूँ राइट करूँ 
 (I try that everything I do It right)
नेगेटिविटी से हर एक सेकण्ड फाइट करूँ 
(Fight against n egativity every single second)
इस अँधेरे में खुद को मैं गाइड करूँ 
(In darkness, guide myself)
इस अँधेरे में किसी की मैं लाइट बनूँ 
(Be someone's light in this darkness)
हाँ बक बक करे पीठ के पीछे 
(Backbitters blabbering behind my back)
हाँ क्यूंकि मैं हूँ आगे वो है सारे पीछे 
 (Because I'm ahead and everyone's behind)
प्यार करने वाले रहते सरांखो पे 
(Those who love me will be honored)
मुझसे जलने वाले रहते जूतों के नीचे 
(Thoso who envy me will remain under my foot
'Cause this is how we do it
There ain't no other way
You see it how we moving
Love find us everyday
This is how we do it
And there ain't no other way
So we can roll together
Roll together
'Cause we all know
Together is always better
'Cause this is how we do it
(Yeah, yeah)
This is how we do it
(Yeah, yeah)
It's all about love
How do it, how we do it
I gotta reach for the life
That I'm living for
I gotta look to the sky
When It's gonna pour
And no fear for the fight
When you're about the score
And that's a matter of fact
Beause this is how we do it
There ain't no other way
You see it how we moving
Love find us everyday
This is how we do it
And there ain't no other way
So we can roll together
Roll together
'Cause we all know
Together is always better
