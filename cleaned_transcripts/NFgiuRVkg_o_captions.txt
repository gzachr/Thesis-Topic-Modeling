[Music] our family of five is on a quest to 
experience 110 distinct cultures across all  
seven continents by the summer of 2025. we're 
on the penultimate location in our three-week  
Southwest Asia trip and that has us here in 
Panglao but we're not content to just sit  
on our thumbs all day so instead we're meeting 
back up with our local guide from yesterday and  
heading off for a day of Island hoppy through 
some of the most incredible reefs Waters and  
beaches of the Philippines and we're capping 
the experience off with a Hidden Gem back at  
our seaside resort so be sure to stick around 
until the end good morning I am enjoying my  
coffee right outside of our suite on our balcony 
that wraps around and has this gorgeous view right  
over the water I mean I feel like I'm right 
on the water right here but I'm gonna drink  
this up because we gotta go we are starting our 
water activity all around Bohol right now after  
a day in the jungle yesterday I'm looking forward 
to spending a day out on the water on a boat if  
you haven't seen that episode yet check it out 
you could probably click up here to add it to  
your queue they packed us a sack breakfast 
that we're taking with us on the road our  
transfer is just a 10 minute drive to the dock 
and then we're on a boat the rest of the trip  
we're getting on the boat in Panglao the city 
and we're leaving from their main dock we were  
just here last night because we met up with a 
fellow content creator travel Creator and he  
brought us out here he lives out here so showed us 
all around town we had breakfast right over here  
breakfast I said breakfast yeah he said 
breakfast dinner like if he said breakfast
here's breakfast we'll see if we can find all 
things hopefully we're getting an early start  
because sometimes some days it can be kind of 
crowded with other boats and other people out  
there but we're getting an early start there 
haven't been too many boats that have left the  
dock here this morning so it shouldn't be very 
crowded out there when we're looking at the  
Dolphins and that's just the first step of what 
we're doing today definitely not the first ones  
here Dolphins travel in pods so there's likely 
a pod cruising along right there where all the  
boats are surrounding so we're trying to get in 
on that Circle so we can see them too they come  
out and play in the same area every morning 
so they all the boats know where to look from
[Music]
our guide Agnes says there's only a few out 
today but normally there are tons so if you  
come to Bohol you might find a lot more Dolphins 
than we are today but still it's so beautiful to  
see them out in the wild because they are 
completely doing their own thing in their  
own habitat and we're just observing them that 
that was a cool little moment but now we're  
off to our first destination which is Balaicasag Island and we're gonna do some snorkeling  
and just enjoy one of the most beautiful 
beaches in the Philippines let alone the hall
and this is balika song which means a crab 
upside down is that right yeah upside down  
crab I should mention that this is 
actually pretty early for us it's 7  
20 a.m because we had to get the kids up 
at 5 30. they're still yawning a little  
no idea what she's talking about this is not 
earlier for us that's true it's not really for  
Phil and I but the kids are tired because 
they're still jet lagged this is beautiful
this is pretty much the thing to do here after 
checking out the Dolphins out there because  
every boat that was with us out there with 
the dolphins is heading in here now and it's  
basically a big setup of like restaurant areas 
this small island is actually inhabited they  
have a school and everything and the population 
is about 1 000 people so very small island but a  
little Community here and their main source of 
income used to be fishing but now it's tourism  
obviously a lot of the families that live here 
have this beachfront living so these homes right  
here that they've then built essentially little 
restaurants onto the front of and they only serve  
on this side of the island a portion of the year 
and then when the winds shift they actually move  
this little operation to the other side of the 
island they don't move the housing of course they  
don't move the restaurant and that component of 
course but a lot of the people who live here are  
actually families extended families so maybe the 
one generation has a house and a little restaurant  
operation on this side of the island and maybe 
the parents have one on the other side so they  
just move the people they move the service so 
that the boats can still make it ashore even  
with whatever Direction the winds and the waves 
are coming from the children who live on the  
island who are Elementary School age actually 
go to school right here on the island and the  
school that Erin mentioned but once they go to 
high school they go to the mainland and a lot of  
those are people who have family that lives on the 
main island so they go and stay there during the  
week and then they come back here Friday after 
school and get to spend the weekend with their  
family here there are a lot of things that have 
really impacted this community the typhoon that  
came in a few years ago and of course the pandemic 
really hurt their economy here because the tourism  
was down but luckily tourism is starting to 
come back full force so we're hoping that the  
whole community recovers and we're going to help 
them out she showed me uh this is a real girl
yes for yourself yes I can make it for you if you 
want into my mind I want the shark try this one I  
can give you a good price yes okay thank you enjoy 
thank you bye-bye we've already mentioned how some  
of the best scuba diving on the planet is here 
in the Philippines and in fact it's in bahal but  
some of the best diving in this entire area is 
right here on this island in fact it's so good  
that the government here has built a resort on 
this island it's the only one here and it's just  
on the other side of the island the typhoon did 
some major damage to that Resort too and it's not  
quite back in action a lot of the huts are still 
really damaged so they're working on bringing it  
back apparently it's a really good Resort and 
again my dive partner Reagan is not with us  
on this trip so I'm not going to be doing any 
scuba diving nobody else in the family is scuba  
certified just yet but we are about to head out 
and do some amazing snorkeling we are off to find  
we're off to the holding area now for our little 
snorkeling adventure and I can't wait to get in  
the water because it is toasty here and just the 
idea of jumping into some nice cool water sounds  
pretty amazing right now we kind of took our 
sweet I'm getting here so it is getting more and  
more crowded but like Phil said it is government 
owned and so we have to pay a tax to snorkel here  
so we're just waiting for taxes to be paid I'm 
the worst each one of these boats can carry two  
passengers so we're taking two different boats we 
have two different guides and we're already ready  
all right we're already at first point which is 
called Turtle Point and this is where we're gonna  
look for some turtles so I'm gonna swap the camera 
over to my goggles oh it's funny how some places  
we go the turtles are so afraid that the moment 
you touch the water they are off like a bulk of  
lightning and then other times like here they're 
totally chill all right now we're off to the real  
guide spot where we're gonna spend some more time 
in the water Erin's negotiating with uh her guide  
right now to try to get into place away from some 
of these other boats it is crowded it is crowded  
and this is very unusual for our experiences 
when we do excursions like this we're trying to  
go to fewer touristy places when we travel 
and do more off the beaten path local kinds  
of experiences nevertheless it's beautiful so 
we're gonna hop in and get some views from this  
beautiful coral attention beautiful yeah it is a 
little stressful but we are pushed out a little  
bit further from the other boats and we're going 
to snorkel that way uh but we cannot go into the  
shallow coral area that's restricted by 
their government so we're staying right  
on the Cliffside which is the best snorkeling 
because that's where all the activity is [Music]  
about it or not still with uh still with the 
journey I don't know if you fell by the office  
footage down there but Brooklyn borrows my face 
mask and have the GoPro on top so a lot of that  
is from her definitely a very different experience 
than we had in Coron where it was totally secluded  
and private but I understand why that is such a 
famous diving spot the cliff side underwater is  
really really beautiful and so active and Colt 
said he saw somebody free dive down so deep he  
couldn't see him anymore and then a little bit 
later he starts seeing the snorkel the bright  
green color of it and more and more you can 
see that that person was coming back up but  
that always blows my mind I don't have the lung 
capacity for it no doubt about it it's a beautiful  
place to just sit and chill so I think we're 
gonna maybe uh just wade back into the waves  
a little bit and wait for lunch to be sir food and 
it looks like their specialty Seafood we got crab  
fish prawns and then there is chicken and looks 
like this might be pork and my favorite the mango  
the Philippine mango is so so delicious oh and 
there's more there's more there's a shell soup  
I'm gonna start with that actually oh my gosh 
there are huge huge clams in here wow every time  
we've eaten in bahal they've only served a fork 
and a spoon and we heard that's because when the  
Spanish took over these colonies here they didn't 
trust the locals enough to give them knives so  
everybody learned to use the sport fork and the 
spoon Like a Knife where the spoon would hold the  
food and the fort would serve as a knife I'm not 
very good at it but there we go just like that  
voila I'm gonna try one of these little skewered 
ads yeah that looks so good that is pork and that  
is good it's got a slightly sweet glaze on it 
and that's what they were making right back there  
we are stuffed and back on the boat going to a 
sandbar I think it's called the Virgin Islands  
indeed it is it's called the Virgin Islands 
I can honestly say this is the loudest boat  
I've ever been on it sounds like a 
lawnmower from the 70s but worth it
so The Sandbar is just a little past my knees 
too and uh yeah Colt wants to go out to the  
trees that are buried over here half buried I 
should say so we're walking that direction she  
says that it's pretty high tide right now when 
it's lower high then you can really walk on it  
so if this was low tide this entire area would 
have The Sandbar above water and it's about the  
size of four to six football fields I would say 
and the trees would be completely above water  
in the middle of the trees already looks 
like he's lost in the forest he loves me  
quiet we found a cult in its natural habitat 
very curious that one wants to show us oh
attempting to share his prey I'll share my prey 
with you I think the tide might be going out and  
it is getting shallower by the second here but 
there's one area that we see right in front of  
us where people are literally sitting on their 
butts so we're going over here to check that out  
yeah this is way more shallow than when we first 
got in well I'm pretty sure we saw all of the main  
touristy water attractions that Bohol has to 
offer we're going to get back to our Resort and do  
some activities on property there Brooklyn don't 
sit out there that's dangerous you could fall off  
Daddy's will be silly I feel like Agnes was great 
we had her for two days and we booked her through  
our Resort the Mithi Resort and Spa I found this 
place all on my own and it looked like it was the  
nicest Resort on the island and a friend from the 
local till this time it was the nicest Resort on  
the island but they have their own activities 
they have a cave that has a swimming hole in it  
and it's included with our stay to have a guided 
tour event so we're gonna go check that out now  
this will be our first time here so we're not 
endorsing anything yet but it should be pretty  
cool and it's walking distance so why not how 
far away is this I don't know oh not very far  
uh oh Colt it's freezing I'm not gonna like 
that is it that cold Brooklyn then thank you
[Music]  
this is awesome and then it's 
just for us now huh [Music]  
oh my gosh look how crystal 
clear the water is wow oh [Music]
there he is listening
[Music]
non-porously activity that we're doing [Music]
seriously so cool now I feel like we can say that  
we have been in a Filipino 
bat cave all by ourselves
show me oh my gosh they were adorable 
let's take a close-up with a big one it  
always looks like your mouth is bleeding 
but look that's the color of their tongue
be careful with them where the resort pool is 
much much warmer this is obviously a saltwater  
swimming pool which makes me wonder if the hot 
tub Jacuzzi on our balcony is also salt water if  
it is and I just wasted a bunch of time rinsing 
out all of our snorkelism this afternoon [Music]  
there are three different main pool levels and 
then a bunch of little sub pools that might be  
happening it's so warm oh maybe it gets warmery 
this is probably about 95 degrees we're gonna  
take out the third one because it tastes like 
a husky you know how there are different you  
know levels and sections and each of them 
have a little bit different temperature
that sounds even warmer oh it feels 
so nice I bet this one's 100 degrees  
what do you think the perfect 100 yeah as much fun 
as this is I think we need to head back finish up  
a little bit of online school and we're editing 
more videos that too and then get ready for dinner  
we're eating dinner so early because Phil and 
I skipped breakfast and the kids skipped lunch  
and this little drink is so good this little 
concoction is called a cooler and it's kind  
of like the Filipino version of say an agua 
fresca so just water with some flavors in it  
and this one is coconut and pandan it really is 
real good he said pandan is some sort of a like  
a leaf that's aromatic it is nice to eat over the 
pool and over the water beautiful views the resort  
has a three-star rating and that's probably 
because it is a nature resource which really  
translates to they don't do anything intrusive 
to keep the bugs and critters away so in our  
room there might be the occasional bug or lizard 
which Colt loves what do you think do you mind it  
um no I would say I mind the bugs except you 
know why the toky geckos are here they want  
to eat the bugs this all makes sense this is 
why Colt's been able to catch so many toke  
geckos here it adds up and that's not even to 
say that the bugs are bad it's kind of like  
camping but with much nicer accommodations on 
that note we're gonna head back to our tent
foreign that's so pretty
you're just in bed working and doing school 
and suddenly we hear this got fireworks now
all right back inside guys so we have 
to leave our room at Mithi Resort and  
Spa and we're on our way to Cebu but instead 
of taking a flight all the way to Manila and  
then flying all the way back down to Cebu 
we're taking a much easier route per usual  
before we get in the van Colt's got to let 
go of a lizard so cute all right look at you
oh it's it's adorable
we're taking the ocean jet 
Ferry preservation [Music]  
all right we've got a two hour Voyage ahead 
of us it's going to be nice and relaxing and  
that's pretty much it for this episode so stick 
with us make sure you subscribe because we've  
got another episode coming up when we devour 
Cebu crash in the entire city with each new  
community and culture we encounter in our 
world travels we look for ways to leave it  
better than we found it sometimes that can be 
as simple as picking up trash on a local Beach  
or buying goods from locals without bartering for 
a lower price other times we roll up our sleeves  
and help serve those in need like this time 
but when some of our viewers started sending  
us super thanks money through YouTube this month 
we were touched and we were inspired to pass that  
money right back to the communities that are 
featured in our content as our Channel grows  
these gifts could start to have a real impact
