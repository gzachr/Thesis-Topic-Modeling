last i think several several months 
ago it happened this year for sure  
several months ago there was somebody who was so 
mad at me cursing at me actually because she saw  
a picture of me i was younger in the picture 
and i was painted black so i had a black face  
i wasn't actually doing a black face i was 
celebrating the ati atihan festival in the  
philippines the ati atihan festival in the 
philippines happens every january i think  
it starts january 15 and it's about a week of 
celebration and the festival itself means to be  
like the itas so the items are the first settlers 
in the philippines i should be showing a picture  
of them right now on the screen and i i did 
add a video a separate video about the itis  
and it had been disputed by other people some 
people cursed at me some people say i'm saying  
it wrong some people saying some people 
said i actually said it right but anyway  
regardless of what you were saying i do 
welcome comments i welcome people sharing  
their own research just so you know when any 
researchers come to research some facts are going  
to be disputed some new research are going to 
unravel new facts and whatever but i welcome the  
conversation that's the reason i'm doing all of 
this video uh all these videos i'm not an expert  
but i do welcome i my goal is to just start the 
conversation so please go ahead and continue  
leaving a comment with whatever it is that 
you want to share so the atiya tihan festival  
is because and started because of 
the itas i it started in the aklan
and but it's now being celebrated all over the 
philippines how it actually started is sort of  
uh contested there are two versions of the 
story but both versions started with the datus  
so apparently a group of data switches uh so 
at that time the political and social structure  
is different it's not the democratic where people 
vote or whatever so in their groups there's a  
chief stain and that's called that so they were 
escaping they were trying to get away from the  
malays of borneo because it was being ruled by 
less than decent people and so they wanted to  
leave so this is where the the story differs 
um in both stories they this group of that  
was actually escaped in the first version 
they ended up in the highlands where the  
itis are and so the itis welcomed them they 
provided them shelter welcomed them in the  
community and gave them food and so what the that 
this malays actually did is to paint themselves  
black and join the itas in their dancing and their 
making in honor and to thank the people that were  
generous enough to accept and give them shelter 
on the second version it was the other way around  
so they escaped this malay this that was actually 
escaped their place and settled in the plains  
and then at one one point the itis from the 
highlands experienced some bad um harvest  
and they ended up in the the plains with the 
malays and the malays provided them shelter  
and welcomed them and the i test to thank them and 
to honor their their host they danced for them and  
as music is such a huge part of of the itis and 
and the philippine culture actually in general  
so to thank them they danced and they sang and 
they celebrated for the whole night and for  
the whole week or whatever and then since then 
it was being done yearly uh but because since  
the colonizers arrived primarily the spaniards 
they converted a lot of filipinos to catholicism  
not everybody but a lot a huge part of the 
philippines were converted to catholicism  
and they span it they span the celebration sort of 
changed it so that it honors the santo nino or the  
baby jesus so as you know catholics have different 
saints they also have different representations  
of their saints of the saints and first 
so for jesus christ there's a baby jesus  
and they honor the baby jesus with that eft hand 
festival so if you ever get a chance to join the  
celebration and experience the celebration 
that's what you're going to get into your  
if you really want to join paint yourself black 
your entire body wear their clothes you're going  
to wear different headdresses to be like the itas 
big curly hair there are different other other  
different headdresses that you can wear you're 
going to be joining the dancing and the singing um  
all sorts of celebrations it's a happy happy 
celebration one heck of an immersion to the  
philippine culture and certainly happy and 
i hope that this is something that continues  
i hope that people younger people will continue 
to sort of nurture this this this aspect of our  
culture because it's such a lovely part of our 
culture so yeah if you ever want to experience  
that january go to kalibo plan and brace 
yourself for one heck of an experience
