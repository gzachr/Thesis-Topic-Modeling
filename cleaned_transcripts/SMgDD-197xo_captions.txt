do you have a hard time eating food that
looks like this i get it
this is latin a spicy taro leaf dish
that's one of my favorite filipino
dishes for me
this is like the flavors of the island
in one dish there's creaminess from
coconut milk savory broth from the
shrimp paste and a spicy bite from the
chilies ginger
and other aromatics i can't describe the
flavor of taro leaf but online they say
mild and nutty apparently everything
tastes nutty i love trying dishes that
don't look picture perfect
i learned this the first time i tried
indian palak paneer when i see dishes
like these i think there must be so much
flavor packed in there
in hawaii they have a squid luau dish
which is very similar to
so my sister and i eat latin with
grilled squid try it and let us know how
much you loved lying
