welcome everyone to our brand new adventures
and a brand new country after 28 hours of
travel we have landed in this chill remote
picturesque town of Coron this beautiful Island
Town in the Philippines is one heck of a place
and we've got an action-packed 48 hours to
show you the sights the smells The Taste and
of course the amazingly gorgeous boat tours
here in Coron
[Music] good morning we're on our way to the
hot springs this morning it's just before
9 A.M we are getting ready to rock and roll
it is a sunny day we're about halfway through
the drive it's about a 20 minute drive from
coron town to the hot springs we thought we'll
just stop until the road conditions because
if you're kind of an amateur scooter rider
I think you might want to double think taking
the scooter right out here maybe jump on a
tricycle because it's mostly this like clay
rough gravel that you can kind of see coming
nice and early has meant we've avoided pretty
much all the crowds you can see it is pretty
much a completely empty car park except for
like two motorbikes in front of me so I think
we're gonna have pretty much our own private
experience
morning we've just got through and it's actually
300 pesos per person so 600 total for the
two of us and this is actually such a cute
little area there's absolutely no one here
at the moment except for I think some other
people just turned up at the same time as
us what I really love about this is that they've
got some little shaded pools as well so if
you don't want to sit in the bowling Sun you've
got some seating and some nice Rocky areas
and then of course you've got the massive
pool area right down the open the most popular
time to come is Sunset and I can imagine why
because it'll be a little bit cooler and you'll
be able to really enjoy these hot pools we've
come just after 9am and it is hot today the
sun is out but I think we're still gonna enjoy
it we're going to really feel that relaxation
I'm not the best with spas or hot tubs I last
about 20 seconds and get too hot in fact it's
already like 30 degrees and now I'm hopping
in the 40 degree pool I'm not too sure how
I'm gonna like it but here we go oh once I
can't touch the ground oh geez don't want
to fall over ah this is pretty delightful
oh yeah so the bottom of the pool was also
lined with a bunch of Pebbles which feels
really odd but kind of really satisfying between
my toes this is so relaxing for our very first
day in Philippines and Coron I couldn't think
of a better start oh my goodness this is so
nice it's so warm I love hot baths this is
right up my alley the cool thing about this
place is it's salt water it's one of the few
places in the entire world that has a saltwater
hot pool after about an hour at the hot springs
we are going to head back and I think grab
some food to eat because I'm really starving
what we found with these Hot Springs is that
they're actually really nice like the photos
online do not do this place just as the water's
so clean it's so crisp I was quite amazed
about that [Music] foreign
[Music] Springs and it's just a bit past lunch
time so we're on the Trek to find something
scrumptious and delicious around KRON Town
Bron town is located on bethunger Island and
there are two main ways to get here either
by plane or Ferry coron town is pretty condensed
so you can easily walk around everywhere however
if you want to rest those legs you can easily
jump on a tricycle which are available like
honestly everywhere even the locals take them
so a jump on a tricycle and maybe between
25 to 50 peso for a trip around the town you
can also hire a scooter which we have done
I've got my screw license so I'm pretty comfortable
running my scooter around this part of town
the cost to hire a scooter is around 500 pesos
per day I definitely notice a little here
and the Filipino English they have a bit of
a twang to how they speak and then also I
notice it and the food there are lots of like
burgers and and that sort of American style
food so we popped around the corner and we've
come across this Filipino restaurant called
Inner Cell eats Cove and they just serve like
grilled chicken leg grilled chicken breasts
what else they have like pork belly pork skewers
they sell just a an array of classic Filipino
dishes and this would actually be my first
official Filipino food taste I'm pretty excited
to give it a go and see what I think I got
the chicken breast with rice and that comes
to 175 peso this dish has just arrived in
front of me and blimey it looks delicious
Char grilled chicken and then we've also got
a bunch of sauces and these little containers
here he said to mix this one with this it's
a surprise there's no labels so we'll just
give it a go and see what happens I guess
I'll just eat like a bit of a carnivore no
oh my God that is like the best barbecue chicken
either oh
um
lovely char grill moist okay we got some of
the sauce in here
oh yeah sweet a little bit Tangy he is giving
this chicken such a huge prey so I'm gonna
give it a go
all that sauce that's like so sweet oh that's
really yummy okay yep a solid nine yep definitely
[Music]
[Music] the sun is starting to set we've got
our bags packed because we are walking somewhere
way up there to mount tapias which is the
big old mountain here in Coron it's not really
a mountain kind of more like a hill but 721
steps in this heat so we might die a little
bit from heat but should be fun the good thing
is that if you get up there walk down you
don't walk anymore they have a bunch of tricycles
just sitting down at the bottom here to take
you your lifeless body back to your hotel
all right Brett step 100 what's that maybe
12 of the world I don't really know math that
well
step 200 feeling a little bit less positive
we're getting a beautiful Sunset already it's
time to come through the trees the start was
definitely more steep it's been a little bit
easier now so it's taken us about 10 minutes
to get to the halfway point I can see the
top just over there I think to reach the top
it would take a normal person maybe 20 to
30 minutes but if you'd like to go to a little
bit of a slower pace and take more stops along
the way maybe 40 minutes we're going to go
up maybe fly the Drone take some sexy pitches
hey look at that lovely lovely lovely 500
sign
so close oh like 20 steps to go I just have
sweet all in my eyes I'm drenched but we've
made it the last last of the last high five
Haley you made it maybe a few kgs lighter
but well worth it this view is next available
[Music]
so we're just leaving the viewing platform
behind us because there's a little path to
go further on that leads down to some hills
I think oh no this is it right here oh this
is stunning Mount Tapia stands at 210 meters
tall so it is a walk for all ages as it's
not too intense so Sunset is just after 6
PM so we suggest to leave somewhere just before
five if you want to get up here cool down
and actually enjoy yourself we started at
about 4 30 and we got here just after five
I gotta say I think if you walk over the Viewpoint
and come to this other side it's actually
much much prettier there's not as many people
here got the long beautiful grass I mean it
is breathtaking this view here it's absolutely
incredible I mean this is the stuff that dreams
are made of I feel like we are the luckiest
people in the world because we just got the
most amazing Sunset we took some lovely photos
flew the Drone and now we're gonna start the
trick down the mountain and grab some food
to eat I think we've already scouted out a
little kind of rooftoppy Eatery bar place
so we'll go check that out and bring you along
[Music] spotted I think this little Rooftop
Bar Place hello there is called Alfresco coron
I think is the place that some little finger
food some Mains some drinks we are starving
so let's get involved [Music] have just sat
down we've got little seats along the bar
here because all the seats are packed so I
think if you want to get a seat maybe come
at like six so earlier we're here like 7 30
and we're like one of the last places to get
a seat but we're looking through the menu
trying to find something delicious and some
of it sounds amazing [Music]
that was one interesting event for dinner
the food was good but everything else was
pretty awful it took them about over an hour
and a half to give us two appetizers they
forgot about our Mains the drinks are pretty
much a water down or nearly tripped the service
was like marginal they didn't clear plates
for like an hour the seats were so uncomfortable
it looks nice but yeah it wouldn't wouldn't
recommend going there unless you maybe go
early this is wrapping up day one and we'll
see you again for tomorrow all right welcome
to a day two and we have saved the best to
last and today we are jumping on this boat
behind us and we are going on a massive island
hopping experience tour with experience Coron
travel and tours they're an amazing company
run by Tom and his wife we've got the boat
to ourselves so come along and see what we
have in Sofia here at the market picking something
to eat for our tour got fishes got veggies
got a bit of everything up here [Music] oh
gosh oh gosh I have a whole package oh my
goodness so we're just getting some Meats
for lunch they've got an array of chicken
or liver some pigs here if you really want
that but we're gonna just get some chicken
and some pork for the crew on board to make
us food and then there's like other sections
that have like Fresh Veggies rice drinks it's
quite a unique experience coming here I mean
I've never really seen meat and whole Pig's
heads like that before people have said that
it's quite smelly I actually don't think the
smell is that bad at all I think it's completely
fine so definitely come and check this place
out [Music] laughs
this is our boat behind us it looks deliciously
awesome we've also paid for a clear kayak
which you can see on the on the side there
that's in there so we'll do that at one of
the really clear lagoons later today as well
[Music]
all right we are very very close to the first
designation but unfortunately the rudder I
think is just broken so they're trying to
Mad Panic fix it all we've got some bro and
then we've chucked along there's a few days
late day of things going wrong our first tour
guide broke or hurt his friends but luckily
CJ
I think if you come to Coron you've got to
learn to just sort of go with the flow things
are going to go wrong but just just go with
the flow and enjoy yourself I think we're
gonna have to switch boats um later on or
soon because no I don't think they can steer
but I mean you gotta just roll roll with the
punches you can't let this get you down now
new boats just arrived we've just that's our
old boat right there we've jumped on to this
new boat which is actually probably much nicer
a lot bigger to be honest even has a dressing
room out in the back these guys have got I
think they're going to leave the boat here
come out tomorrow and fix up the bow I'm actually
pretty stoked because we've got a little bit
of an upgrade with the phone this is a bit
bigger like it's got this is even a dressing
room so I feel more comfortable with our staff
so all good here we arrived at our first spot
it's called
we will put a a little description or something
or what it's actually called because I know
I'm not saying it right the snort theme was
really good though the only downside so far
is that we have to wear life jackets I'm a
pretty confident swimmer so I normally never
wear life jacket but you know that's partly
safety here so you just got to go along with
it right after our first stop we are coming
into kayangan Lake which is definitely one
of the most popular spots here in Coron it
is so peaceful and sunny here I think because
of the little delay that we had this morning
with a broken boat we haven't missed all the
crowds so again the big tour companies that
have arrived in their big groups of like you
know 10 15 20 people on their boats [Music]
Neil begins a another hike up I think it's
like 300 awesome something stairs it is so
so cramped here just endless amount of people
the lake looks beautiful but you know we're
squished squish against some rocks I brought
my bag I didn't really know what was happening
I just grabbed it and I kind of regret having
this big thing um with me but but you will
jump in the water I'll take the GoPro so I
can have a little swim about the good thing
is you don't have to wear the life jacket
if you're a confidence on it you just need
to kind of hold on to it which is great for
me but if you need the life jacket jump in
and wear it so just after we hopped in we
swam for like five ten minutes and now it
has actually got really empty which is a lot
better than it was 10 minutes ago oh my goodness
this water is so nice it's so warm oh foreign
[Music] mission complete of the first Lake
that was really nice as it got um really quiet
at the end there like I feel like Hayley had
had the whole lake to herself for a bit now
we're on our way down I think we're gonna
move stop at a beach have lunch and then carry
on
[Music]
we have made it to a vanilla Beach which is
where we're going to have lunch we've just
parked a few boats over walking through the
water to our Lunch Spot we've come to this
little Hut right on the beach for lunch
I've had for lunch
oh my goodness this is a lot of food um I
don't know if we'll make a much of a dent
in this but we'll get our best go I forgot
chicken adobo we've got pork some like vegetarian
noodles an eggplant dish pineapple enough
rice for a whole village um mango banana some
lady gave us some watermelon and then we've
got a soya sauce to Mush all together and
enjoy [Music] for a 10 minute boat ride and
have arrived at Twin Lagoon we're gonna jump
in some kayaks because it is so beautiful
here we've got a clear kayak so we can sort
of look through the boat and see what's in
the water I can't wait so let's go I have
the engines behind me
doing all of the work [Music]
CJ is a sneaky little fish and he swam underneath
the rocks because he's just a Vance man where
we've got to go over these steps and jump
in I think
[Music] so we are here soon at Lagoon 2 here
at Twin Lagoon I've got my little office chair
rock here all set up it is so stunning so
bright here we've got a few kayakers we've
got a few few boats set up this is Christine
Philippines swimming magicness [Music] foreign
[Music]
right here is our Sunset spot called Sunset
Beach I think there's only one other boat
here so we've kind of you know got this romantic
Sunset Beach to ourselves I think Haley and
I are gonna chill out relax go for a swim
a snorkel maybe stay here for like an hour
or so and then probably pull the day but we'll
see how we go we have just arrived at Sunset
Beach and it is so beautiful and peaceful
here we are the only ones here so it is like
our private own Beach which is amazing I'm
ready just to watch the sun go down and relax
foreign [Music]
after an amazing 48 Hours here in Coron I
definitely see the popularity and why so many
people come here though Corona does get dwarfed
a little bit by its big brother and more popular
option El Nido but we have love Coron it's
cheaper more affordable less people it's a
lot more of an authentic experience so we
definitely rate this as a must-do when you're
here in the Philippines we are packing up
getting our gear sorted and we're going to
jump on the boat and call it a day we have
had a marvelous Sun soaked day here so I'm
looking forward to getting back to our hotel
and maybe taking a really really long nap
because I am exhausted oh I am glad to be
on dry land of that bit of a nightmare of
a tour oh my goodness what a [ __ ] show
that was anything that could have gone wrong
went wrong so it started off with our tour
guide not showing up at all and we had to
find a random replacement and then our boat
broke down in the middle of the ocean and
we were standard for over an hour so pretty
much going private was redundant because we
ended up going to all the spots at the same
time as the big tour groups so all in all
I mean we still had a somewhat good experience
but probably wasn't worth the amount of money
that we spent just because of the issues we
had I 
think we
uh on that subscribe button hit that Bell
and say hi to us in the next video
