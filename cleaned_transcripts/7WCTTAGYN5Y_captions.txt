everyone welcome to Pai's kitchen today I am making 
it another Filipino dish this one's such a classic  
it is pancit canton which actually means Cantonese 
noodles so it's a Filipino interpretation of a  
Chinese dish it's stir-fried noodles and this one 
uses egg noodles which I love because I find egg  
noodles really easy to work with but there are 
many many different types of pun seed out there  
and I would love to know what your favorite 
type is and describe it to me let me know in  
the comments all right let's get started let's 
talk noodles so for this you definitely want  
egg noodles about medium thickness not too thick 
not too thin I mean you can get any those dry or  
fresh I prefer fresh because I find the texture 
a little bit more chewy and satisfying it's also  
faster to cook but if all you've got is dry that's 
totally fine too moving on to vegetables vegetable  
options are really up to you for this would think 
about texture and color right so I've got here  
some really beautiful colors here I've got some 
Chinese broccoli make sure you slice the stems  
really thin and then just roughly chop the leaves 
I also like carrots for that you know nice bright  
orange color and I like to use a julienne peeler 
to just make nice little shreds it's actually a  
really convenient tool one of my absolute favorite 
tools in the kitchen for some red and a little bit  
of heat I'm using this long pepper here now at my 
grocery store they label it long red pepper it may  
actually have a different name but it's sort of 
like a bell pepper but much thinner with a kick  
a little bit of kick okay so I like that you can 
just use bell pepper you can use cabbage you can  
use snow peas sugar snap peas anything you want 
okay now the next one is very important Chinese  
sausages some of you may know a slap Chung it is 
Chinese sausages that are quite sweet and really  
fatty really nice and chewy so think of it as 
like salami a sweet salami so this is made from  
pork but they do make chicken ones as well they 
also make some out of liver so there are actually  
many different types so just you know make sure 
you read the label before you buy it and now the  
sauce so it's a very simple stir-fry sauce using 
my three favorite sauces in the kitchen and that  
is oyster sauce and fish sauce of Filipinos and 
I share the love of fish sauce and also a little  
bit of soy sauce and I am using Filipino brand 
soy sauce Silver Swan for this just because it  
is more intense than the Thai ones and just give 
that a quick stir with a new mini whisk a blue  
one I'm just gonna add my black pepper right here 
you don't have to mix it into the sauce but I find  
that I forget it and when I'm cooking so you know 
what just throw it in now then I make sure I never  
forget it that is it let's get started cooking so 
I'm gonna start by cooking the noodles first I've  
just got plain boiling water here all my noodles 
are going in now mine will only take one minute  
but that's going to depend on your specific 
brand of noodles if it's thicker it'll take  
longer and also fresh noodles have different 
levels of hydration so like some will take a  
little bit longer so just make sure you give it 
a taste make sure it's cooked through all right  
so that's done for me I'm gonna take these out 
and then to stop these from cooking I'm going  
to dunk it in some cold water I also find that 
it helps wash off any starch around the noodles  
it helps the noodles separate more easily in the 
wok but you don't want to let these sit in here  
like for a long time where it's gonna continue 
to swell up just dunk it cool it down and then  
drain these right away all right so I've got my 
wok here and the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm  
gonna render some fat out of my lab Chun sausages 
so I still need a little bit of oil for a little  
extra loop but not too much without having to 
wait for the oil to get hot and without dropping  
a plate of sausages just add these in and then as 
you can see there's like a ton of fat in there and  
that will slowly render out into that oil that 
we first added and it will flavor the oil with  
the flavor that's in the sausages so once the 
other side starts to blister that's when you  
go into run them around it doesn't have to be all 
blistered because a lot of the sausages will like  
to curl up very nice so that looks good to me 
so I'm just gonna turn the heat off for now and  
then just remove the sausages be very quick with 
these and just wash them because there is quite  
a bit of sugar in the sausages so they can burn 
rather quickly did I burn a couple oh no it's not  
burned it's just extra caramelized that's what I 
always tell myself when I burn things and then one  
more protein I'm gonna add now this is completely 
optional you can just do the Chinese sausage just  
alone but I'm also gonna add some shrimp okay so 
I'm gonna turn the heat back on and now that oil  
is well flavoured with the sausage flavor add 
my shrimp to sear I always like to move cook my  
protein separately just so I can control exactly 
how done they are and if you don't want to get  
too many oil splatters make sure you dry your 
shrimp just a few seconds per side this room  
did not take long so maybe like 30 seconds on 
each side and they are done alright and that is  
it they are firm and curled up and orange now 
I know that oil doesn't look so hot right now  
but it's so much flavor from the sausages from 
the shrimp and now we're gonna add more flavour  
by adding some aromatics so onions garlic going 
in heat not too high you don't want to burn the  
garlic too quickly just try to break up the onions 
now if you like your onions super soft and melty  
and sweet you can add your onion first let that 
cook down a little bit then add the garlic so now  
you notice that the garlic is starting to brown 
slightly around the edges that's your cue for  
adding your vegetables and the wonderful thing 
about the choices of vegetables that I chose is  
that I can add them all at the same time like 
if you've chosen something that's harder that  
takes a longer time you may need to add that first 
cook that down first or blanch it first so look  
at that look how pretty that is hmm now just to 
spread some love I'm gonna add this little bit of  
sauce on the vegetables give them a chance to get 
seasoned and once the vegetables are wilted going  
in with my noodles I switch weapon for the rest of 
the sauce over the noodles and then I toss like my  
life depends on it oh you know what I forgot to 
do it's cut the noodles sound not too late I'm  
gonna quickly take scissors and just snip a couple 
of times just because I find it's so much easier  
to work with to eat anyway just after they're a 
little bit shorter and now you're just trying to  
get everything mixed together drying the noodles 
allowing the noodles to absorb all that liquid mmm  
they can smell that black pepper now everything's 
dry I am NOT gonna forget to put in my shrimp if  
there's juices collected on the bottom of the 
shrimp Bowl just go ahead and pour that in it's  
extra flavor and my lap Cheong as well oh there's 
some extra caramelize on we're going to pretend  
that never happened and that is it you guys it 
is done how easy was that look at that mmm you  
want to make sure you pay attention and grab all 
the veggies and the shrimp and the sausage because  
it's kind of hard to make sure you get an even 
distribution of everything so ideally I would like  
to finish this dish by giving it a good squeeze 
of calamansi on top to brighten up the flavor in  
calamansi are these tiny little Filipino online 
they look like tiny lines for the flesh inside  
is orange I could not find that anywhere I was 
like three different stores they don't have it  
in Vancouver well right now anyway so what I'm 
gonna do is like a makeshift thing so I've been  
told that common sea tastes like a combination of 
lime and orange juice so that's exactly what I'm  
gonna do so I've got here just some tart orange 
juice you wasn't being tart not super sweet and  
I'm gonna just add some lime into it and that 
will approximate the effect of calamansi I even  
tried looking for frozen juices couldn't find 
that too but this is ooh you can just do lime  
I'm just being particular here ooh there we go 
you know just like a pop tie you know it's just  
like lightens and brightens everything give that 
a good toss get some sausage some vegetables oh I  
can smell that citrus that is exactly what I need 
right now if you think Asian comfort food this is  
the embodiment of Asian comfort food chewy noodles 
and you know you've got vegetables for some crunch  
but it's well-balanced flavors you bite into 
the sausages and get chewy and sweet a little  
kick from black pepper brightness from the citrus 
I mean it's so so good really kid-friendly too by  
the way there's nothing spicy in here and it's one 
of those dishes that once you start it's really  
hard to stop so speaking of that I'm gonna go so 
I can finish the rest of this bowl so the recipe
