Mabuhay!
KIM n LEE here
Let me tell you about today's menu
We ate Pansit canton last time
and the sour taste was awesome, right?
-chili mansi flavor, nice!
then, I became curious
Korean noodles + Calamansi powder
(Is it similar to Filipino noodles?)
so, we're gonna try this!
-I think it will be delicious
Jin ramen, Fire noodles, Chapagetti
and Calamansi powder
let's cook it
-okay!!!!
I'm ramen chef
this is coconut yogurt juice
oh, powder
-it's the most important ingredient!
this is Korean jin-ramen!
-okay
and sprinkle that powder
jin ramen + calamansi
it's too much!
-one more time~
too much!
too much powder....
-Lime man, just try it
yeah, I am Lime-man
but I can't eat that well
let's go
goooo
why do you eat first!
-because it was spilled!

-nice scent
the taste has changed perfectly
Korean ramen -> Filipino ramen

-thats lit!

-yes
sour taste makes better taste
tasty, daebak(awesome)
woah, you have to try the soup!!!
-soup?
yes
it tastes like Filipino foods
-small powder changes the taste a lot
why?
-Smith looks funny
damn hot...
this is Korean ramen but tastes like Filipino
-similar to Pansit-canton
-really
It wasn't expected, because it's just a small powder (but wow...)
I thought it would harmonize with the noodles (non-soup)
but, harmonize with the ramen(with soup) also
whenever I eat ramen, I should sprinkle it
-I think so
Korean ramen & Calamansi
I can feel the rich taste
no rice...T.T
I wanna eat rice and soup together
that's ok
-I'm not ok
