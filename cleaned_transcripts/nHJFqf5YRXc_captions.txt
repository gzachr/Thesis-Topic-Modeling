Hi peoples
I've been away for a while with my reactions
Today I want to resume
I want to start over with a singer you love. Me too.
Morissette Amon
I found out that she started with THE VOICE
She performed in a blind with the song love on top
Today we will listen to that song
You will see Morissette Amon, in the first performance at the voice
From now on there will be a synchronicity problem.
The video is accelerated. I kept it all so as not to repeat the video.
I did not want to distort the true nature of the reaction. sorry.
let's go to hear
well, this was the first performance of Morissette Amon at THE VOICE
It did not go really well, only one judge turned
But it is true that she is a great talent
I do not know what position has been classified at the end of the show
I'm sure she came up very high
Ok people. Sorry for my voice.
Hello everyone
I look forward to the next videos
You get more and more numerous
Bye!!!   :)
