the only difference in Thailand and here
is before I said Canadians were the
nicest people yeah yeah we're going to
the main thing is um it's too much to
feed the woman no no what do you think
of the Filipino people always happy
always smiling hello you beautiful
people and welcome back to living abroad

streets of Cebu City Philippines ask
some foreigners exactly why they think
Filipinos are number one in the world so
a lot of times in these videos people
always keep mentioning Filipinos being
the best people in the world I'm going
to try to get some more detail as to why
that is and if they had any experience
dealing with Filipino locals before I do

happy yeah excellent thank you so much
for your time I appreciate it thank you
thank you hi what's your name my name is
Roderick and where are you from I'm
originally from Buffalo New York I live
in Hawaii right now okay and what brings
you down here to the Philippines
um I mean this too
get away from Hawaii in high prices you
know you can't beat the exchange rate
here
food is good yeah people is pretty real
real friendly okay tell me a little bit
about the people have you had a chance
to interact with any locals yeah I ever
have basically some of the staff at the
hotel and some people some of the people
I've met here they are well mannered
well friendly and um real real nice yeah
and I'm easy to talk to don't have any
Hang-Ups about anything like that so for
sure do you ever feel like concern for
your safety or anything around here or
anything no no it's pretty much I read
up on I read up on the area before I
came here and basically pretty pretty
safe the main thing is um
people here they basically speak English
even as a broken English you cannot
communicate yeah not like some other
country where you just don't know
anything I take for like example
Thailand if you're gonna probably sort
of rural area
you died you're sucking yeah you know I
agree so you've been to Thailand oh yes
okay have you noticed any differences
between the two countries so far during
your stay I have I have I travel all
over southeast Asia you know and I
thought about retiring you know the only
difference in Thailand and here is
the country has built up more and they
have more medical facilities for you
compared to here yeah because if you
decide to retire here you live out in
the province you might have a lot of
problem you might have a problem if
you're trying to yeah need medical
assistance not like entirely you have
hospitals and everything yeah well
hopefully none of us have to experience
that anytime soon yeah yeah but it
happens it happens you know you know
prepared I guess yes yes all right man

very nice is this a place you can see
yourself living or retiring oh
definitely yeah come here Tom and ich
and yeah settle down with a nice girl
and yeah yeah the climates yeah I'm
gonna see how the climate is pretty
humid here but I guess you must be used
to it
well tazzy's
um
fairly colder than here at the moment so
it took me a few days to sort of
acclimatize didn't it yeah easy to give
it easy to um get used to thank you so
much for your time no worries you have a
good day hi what's your name uh where
are you from Italy Italy and why are you
in the Philippines
because in Italy is a
it's too much to feed the woman
it's very too much difficult yeah and
very complicated yeah I hope is
is easy yeah I don't know so are you
here to meet a friend a girlfriend a
woman are you here by yourself
a woman in the Philippines and how long
have you been here
you've been in the Philippines for two
months did you talk to many Filipino
people what do you think of the Filipino
people
but for now I think I'm friendly yeah I
want to speak
but I think it's good is very quiet yeah
it's so often always good that the
people are awesome thank you so much for
your time I appreciate it thank you hi
what's your name my name's Worley uh
where are you from
um Atlanta Georgia and what brings you
down here to the Philippines a little
holiday and
maybe even uh to retire here how do you
like the rain so far rainy season right
content course yeah you know for sure
how long have you been here uh uh a
Baltimore what are your thoughts about
the Philippines what do you like the
most in a month
I like the people yeah they're probably
the friendliest people in the world
I was gonna ask about the people next
but I'm glad you mentioned it is there
anything specific everybody keeps saying
that people are the best well well I
never thought because before I said
Canadians were the nicest people yeah
I'll just use this I'm a runner yeah
after the rain in the streets here I get
kind of uh slick yeah I I took off a
spill oh no I don't know anybody yeah
all types of people ran over to check on
me I was fine but all types of people
checked on me yeah that's amazing
incredible right a lot of time in the
west people might just walk by I'll have
to I get hit by a car we're on a
sidewalk
wow
nobody cares about it yeah I know it's
very different over here like Canadians
are known to be nice but usually you
have to spark a conversation or
something I find the Philippines a lot
of people take the initiative by smiling
or saying hello oh yeah they smile all
the time
okay now you mentioned about maybe
possibly retiring here do you have any
specific locations in mind have you been
anywhere
that's my hard part because I would like
to check out like the bow
um
Halloween I heard it's a beautiful day
yeah I'm sure but there's so many places
I don't want to you know
yeah but you know Manila is way too
crowded I've never I've only been to
like BGC for a few days so I'm not very
experienced about Manila it's
and Toronto wants that right yeah
another major city that's like busy busy
right
it's crazy freezing traffic
I hear it's like some of the worst in
the world from another traffic so
yeah
you know I thought about getting a
scooter here yeah
might be risky right in Manila no no way
all right now do you have any concerns
about health insurance how do you like
stay up to date with that stuff in case
something does happen well I have
traveled also I mean that's
smart thing to do what about your like
relationship status are you seeing
people are you single you're not single
uh
honestly for me
just because
I don't know if you're familiar with
Philippines I'm not really familiar but
maybe you can help us all out you don't
really know too much so
for me if I'm gonna stay here I get
everything needed forward
the lot's really built for the
Philippines I see it so if you know from
what I hear they all want to move in
with you and all that once you move in
anything you acquire I forget I don't
know the time frame yeah it's kind of
like they get part of it okay so if
you're gonna buy a condo
you buy the condo before I got you so
buy everything before your relationship
just in case it doesn't go well even if
you get a scoop it yeah
I don't I don't know the time frame but
that's the kind of stuff okay excellent
but do I think that's gonna happen you
that happens everywhere right yeah
Canada but I think yeah
but I think people
will be aware definitely I mean
it's just like it's not like it's just
like any place else in the world
got it all right well thank you so much
for your time you're very informative
and helpful thank you thank you hi

love to know your experience in the
Philippines what do you like about it so
far
I really like it yeah uh you know just
going around seeing things
trying to get in how the People
speaking of the people have you had a
chance to interact with any locals for
looking at yeah now what do you think of
the Filipino people oh they're just
they're just wonderful guys quite
surprising is this a place you can see
yourself retiring perhaps yeah yeah
how's the cost of living here compared
to Australia uh he's it's fair yeah
a lot cheaper the money goes a lot
further right yeah yeah and thank you so
