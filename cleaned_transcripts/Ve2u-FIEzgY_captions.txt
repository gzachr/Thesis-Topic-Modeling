I just have one of the most beautiful faces in the Philippines.
[He's funny / too]
[Who's his friend?]
In Korea, if you have Sandara Park, in the Philippines
we have Sandara Pork.
[Holding in his laughter / I'm Sandara Pork]
[This Filipino superstar has a great sense of humor]

What's the best thing to buy?
This is one of the best items we have.
[Not even hesitating to take out 'that' item]
[Interested in its uniqueness]
What is this?
This is a product to massage your brain.
Massage my brain?
[Taking the effort / to demonstrate]
[To be honest / The electric current is massaging his brain]
What does it do to my brain?
Am I going to get smarter if I use this?
It'll relax your brain, I guess.
[Vice's friend is going to try it on to test out the effect]
[Joking / Give me the biggest one]
[Making it the biggest size]
[Will the massager have a good effect?]
[Done putting it on]

[Okay goodbye]
See you guys later.
[...?]
[But it's 80% off]
[Just kidding]
In cash, though.

[Happy to see a superstar and sad to see him leave]
[Lots of gratitude in this farewell]
[...?]
[Caught you!]
[Joking / Joking]
[Vice Ganda making everyone laugh until the end]
[Such a comedian]
[We have to acknowledge that sense of humor]
[His demeanor itself is that of a superstar's]
When he's outside, cars can't get by.
[They're still into the moment]
Wow, the amazing thing is that
he came all the way here just because Sandara was selling things.
[Even has the manners of a superstar]
[The staff never invited him / Vice Ganda just came at once with one call by Sandara]
He's a bigger star than I am.
[Even bought all the diet pills]
[He cleared an entire section]
[Joking / Should've sold other things]
[You are Vice GOD]
[Idol Truck / Let's work until we sell everything!]

[If they win in rock, paper, scissors / Idol Truck will erase a zero]
[The customers are heading to DinDin]
[Let the plan begin]
Do you have any cash?
[Will they]
[have cash?]
[...]
I only have 1,000 pesos.
[Oh, is this going to be hard?]
[We'll buy it if it's on sale]
We're sorry, it's already 80% off...
[Moving right on to the next target]
[Being very upfront]
[She doesn't have that much cash either]
[Okay / Idol Truck respects freedom of purchase]
[The second they were about to give up...]
[JONGHYEON got an idea]
Directors, we'll give you this chance as well.
[The chance to buy a 300,000 won product / with just 15,000 won]
[This isn't forced, this is a chance]
[But they have to win rock, paper, scissors]
[If they lose, they have to buy it in the original price]
[Murmuring / It doesn't seem like a bad deal]
[We're all family here / Why don't we all finish strong?]
[Oh? / Who will go for the challenge?]
[Today's star is here]
We'll let you choose someone
you think you could beat.
[This player chose DinDin]
You know usually people who want to play end up losing, right?
[The person who wanted to play / Uneasy]
[There's just one item left]
[A one-game match for an all-sold-out sale]
Do I try and read him or not?
You have to!
I...
I am going to go with scissors!
So I'm going to cut you off!
[DinDin taking the initiative with scary words]
[I'm going to go with scissors too]
[Our Black Cow PD isn't backing down]
Why am I getting nervous?
[Who will the winner of this challenge be?]
Rock, paper, scissors
[Please]
Shoot!
[Rock / Rock]
Shoot!
[Didn't you say you were going to go with scissors?]
[They tied the first round]
[Whoa]
[There is no backing down here]
[Strategy time]
[He can hear everything through his in-ear device]
[Whispering without knowing they could be heard]
I can hear you through my in-ear.
[We forgot]
[There's nothing we can do now]
[Then since things are like this already / Whatever]
[Will there be a winner now?]
[Loser / Winner]
[What...]
[Thinking hard]
But to think about it, if this turns out this way
it doesn't look good on us to the person who bought this before.
[That's not going to work]
[That's a whole other story / DinDin could get this with his fee]
[Even my tricks aren't working...]
[Congratulations on your sold-out sale!]
[They're very happy after working so hard]
[And one member is hurt]
[DinDin doesn't feel that happy]
[But we really sold everything!]
[Every item is sold out now]
[Great work, everyone!]
[After a game of loss / they're going to eat a nice dinner]
[Everyone gathered at the restaurant happily / except for a gloomy DinDin]
I feel like we had more items than yesterday.
[Lots of cash]
[And yet they still sold everything]
[Multiple people counting because there's too much cash]
[All focused / in counting money]
[The members are collecting insights on today's results]
[How much will they have earned?]
[!]
[What's the total?]
[Just DinDin's cash alone / is 41,000 pesos]
[Wow]
[So if they add everything together]
How much is it?

[Nice / Nice]
Wow, there really isn't much time until your birthday.
[Saying cheers with water]
[Happy birthday, JONGHYEON]
[Drinking water very well today]
[Let's dig in first!]
[The menu is shabu shabu!]
[A great meal after a hard day]
[Shabu shabu after a long day of work]
[makes even Sandara dance]
[Looking blank-faced for some reason]
I want to try expressing the flavors too.
[The shabu shabu on this side won't boil]
[Confused]
[Whatever, not my problem]
[Not my problem either]
[Unexpected sadness at a foreign country]
[In Korea, we're popular celebrities...]
Don't we have to put these in too?
Crab and all?
[But the members don't care about us...]
[and are putting crabs in their shabu shabu pot...]
If they knew better, they'd give us one, right?
Yes, these guys are on another level.
You could go 'try one'!
[They know no friends when it comes to hunger]
But you have a lot of food too.
You could give us some crab and mussel to put in our pot!
But they put everything in theirs!
[They do have mussels though]
[Everything was halved fairly]
[Oops]
[Thought our team was halved for a while]
[Finally the soup is boiling]
[First bite after waiting for 10 minutes]
[Yum]
I bet I'm going to be puffy tomorrow too.
[Even if that happens, they can't give this up]
Wow, this is over tomorrow.
[A bit sad]
[Just yesterday, they were really nervous to open]
We're almost there, and it's quite saddening.
It's going by so quickly.
[Now that it's almost over, they're sad]
[An end to such a long day]
[They were going to go back to the hotel...]
DinDin, can I get my hopes up for this?]
[Choosing a song / At karaoke to celebrate JONGHYEON's birthday]
[Don't get them up too high]
[So honest]
You're celebrating your birthday in the Philippines!
This is the least we could do!
Spending my birthday with you guys in the Philippines.
[How happy!]
[Surprise!]
[Everyone prepared a birthday PARTY for JONGHYEON]

[Whatever this looks like, happy happy birthday, JONGHYEON]
Happy birthday, JONGHYEON!
Make a wish!
[Blowing out the candle after a wish]
[May your wish come true]
Happy birthday!
I think this is the first time I sang this live.
[Great job]
[He was actually very embarrassed]
[But JONGHYEON is happy nonetheless]
Thank you.
[And the Director is singing a song next]
You are born to be loved!
[A voice that brings tears to the eyes]
[Fake crying]
