Here we come!
Today, Well..
On October, I went to Philippines
and I couldn't forget the local foods in PH,
So We found the Philippines restaurants
And Coach Joongseob have plan to visit PH soon,
Yeah, One of the PH Television station invited me, so I will visit the PH soon,
Now, the food has come
Let me show you first,
So this is
Well, Normally the Sinigang has shrimp, but this one has pork
Is it Korean version?
Well, I don't think so
I think it has lots of version
And the next one,
With shrimp, please try
The eggplant on it
seems like the eggplant, yes
Let me try the squid first,
Delicious!
This is my very first time to try the PH food,
For sure, I have to try the others though,
Delicious!
Well, Most of Korean foods have the spicy taste,
But this one is
Wonderful combination with rice
Cause it's the Garlic rice
In this menu, There are the PH words, such as Masarap
Eat it first,
Nice, Isn't it?
Much better with rice
This Pusit looks like very smiliar to the Gerry's Grill one
What does it taste?
Similar
Oh is it?
Similar, but I do prefer this one
For me, This one is better than the Gerry's Grill
Based on the Barbaecue sauce,
This sauce has spicy taste, you should try
Okay, Let me try
Squid, Let me try!
I am not sure that you guys can see this
With barbaecue sauce, and also grilled
Oh, Okay
It's very soft, but the texture is rough
The texture of the squid, yes
We are not the professional food youtuber, but
And What's next?
I tried the Sinigang with shrimp before, and this one has only pork
Like Kimchi stew in Korea, the most popular food in PH
This one,
Porks, and lots of vegetables
This soup is like the Soybean Paste Stew with Beef Brisket
It must be brand new taste for you
I'm so excited
What?
Now you know why I mentioned the Kimchi stew
Oh~
Okay, Let me explain this
It's totally different what I expected
It looks like the soybean based soup,
But when I taste it,
taste like the aged kimchi stew
Interesting
Yeah it is
When I try this at first time, I was totally surprised
Maybe because of the Shrimp, Isn't it?
No, It's same
Oh okay
The smell is same as the sinigang with pork
So nice, I love the PH foods
It has pork... ( I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HE IS SAYING! )
Anyway, I love this soup
And I heared normally people love to eat the Sinigang after drinking!
This Sinigang is very smiliar to the local PH Sinigang
I can say that Korean can eat without any hesitation
Those three dishes, so nice
Maybe that's why there is the Ph restaurant in Korea
Probably lots of people who wants to try Ph food visit this restaurant
Yeah, If I had visited PH,
I definitely want this foods
It's very smiliar
mukbang
A few weeks ago, My Girlfriend visted the Boracay
She visited the Gerry's Grill, but coudln't eat
cause all the menu was out of stock
so She told me she really want to try the PH foods
People like his girlfriend, I highly recommend this restaurant. The taste is very similar to Gerry's Grill
And also at the Gerry's Grill Offical Facebook account, they uploaded our video!
We just finished! How was it?
It's empty!
It was my very first time, It's not that familair
but nice, delicious
Brand new, and also nice
For me, I tried those foods before in PH,
I can say that the taste in this restaurants, JOVI'S GRILL, is very similar to Local PH food
We enjoyed well,
We will meet you guys next new contents!
BYE~
