today's the day that we are finally going
to my childhood hometown of Bacolod Philippines
it's been 15 years since I was last there
and it'll be Nicole's very first time visiting
the good news is that Pocola is just 100 miles
where we are right now in Baraka the bad news
is it's on an entirely different Island two
islands away from here so we're going to be
taking a series of tricycles buses and boats
together thank you thank you sir thank you
hello good morning here we go again
thank you
I think that's us this is a little bit too
easy I expect some sort of Road breakdown
or boat breakdown happening at some point
friends are watching rural Philippines goodbye
is actually pretty fun unless you're just
good
thank you
okay vote number two of this day
[Music]
[Music]
oh my gosh guys Warren Bacolod this is the
first time I've been here like 15 years you're
back and when I went back 15 years ago it
was only for like a short visit I was like
a teenager before that I was like six years
old when I left here crazy
that is the end of a very long travel day
see you tomorrow
all right guys so we decided that the best
way to explore we'll call it today is to get
ourselves a scooter we all know we love a
good theater so we're back 
on the road
so cool I'm in your hometown yo what's your
first impression baby you like it I like it
I like it it's so green and Lush and it's
so so humid like of course we are really really
close to the water in the ocean here again
so far I you know but bacolitz is like uh
some way smaller than I remember in some ways
bigger than I remember like there's not as
many like tall buildings as I thought
because I was expecting it to be like a really
big city but it seems like a very more of
like a very homey town maybe it's because
like you were small when you were here you
know you know like if you go back and revisit
your Elementary School like it seems so big
when you were there and you revisit I was
like even a teenager I remember doing that
being like this school is so small like everything
is so small here maybe that's kind of like
what it's like here you know yeah maybe like
six when you were like living here
all right
so Nicole and I are just stopped at the immigration
office here in bakola because we tried to
get our visas extended when we were in Boracay
but it didn't work out it's a long story but
anyways now that we're here at the immigration
in Bacolod find it kind of interesting and
ironic that we're here extending our Visa
so that we can stay in the Philippines for
even longer and also this very same immigration
office is probably where like my parents applied
to like maybe immigrate to Canada or like
or like you know started some sort of process
to like move to Canada when I was really really
young so it's strange to come almost like
full circle maybe you know there's a six-year-old
me running around here a long time ago in
this same lawn chair at this immigration office
who was waiting to take a photo so they could
put it on his very first passport so they
could get on a plane for the very first time
to go to Canada lucky me that all that happened
the other thing that we've learned since coming
to Philippines
Visa yeah yeah everybody in the comments who
are Filipino and are going to tell me about
the balak buying Visa I'm sorry I just figured
it out now yeah I know we didn't know when
we entered the country so it turns out because
Mickey was born here we he aren't I because
we're married could have come here visa-free
for up to a year yeah but I didn't know that
when we entered the country and you can only
get balaca Bayan when you enter the country
so and so we're now here we're here on a tourist
visa extending it and paying hundreds of dollars
but it's okay because Philippines is worth
it yeah Philippines is worth
[Music] foreign
[Music]
stomping grounds does anything look more familiar
yet honestly everything is just uh brand new
for me it has been a long time it has been
a long time I also really feel like we have
left tourist Philippines yeah this is not
I don't think many tourists come this way
definitely Nicole sticks out here
so we've now entered the community that I
believe um for my old houses I gotta just
say first of all that I actually don't know
that we'll find it um I actually don't know
the exact address of my house I uh found it
when I was a child living in Canada uh using
Google Street View I saw like the gates in
like the house that looks like it's ours I'm
pretty sure that's it I don't have an exact
address I like sent that via WhatsApp to my
mom and she's like yeah I'm pretty sure that's
the house he like literally has the coordinate
like the GPS coordinate that's what we're
going on yeah I just have GPS coordinates
of where we should go
so far the community looks nice yeah
stunning I feel like we're coming to a dirt
road are we supposed to go from here straight
all right yeah the maps Google Maps has to
keep going oh boy by the way guys um if there's
just like a random floating like microphone
like a floating black thing in any of the
scenes today uh apologies we're trying out
a new mic hopefully it sounds a little bit
better than what you've heard before when
we have whenever we use this camera um but
if there's like random like Harry Potter stuff
like just like something's floating that's
our new microphone that's the magic of YouTube
everybody yeah to be honest I can't imagine
how much this place could have changed in
like 26 years since you lived here yeah it
probably is like actually I don't know I don't
really know what to expect the only real way
I can identify my house is by literally the
fence the other way I can recognize it is
because I remember there was a store beside
my house that I used to always buy chips from
and by buy chips I mean that I would take
the chips and tell them that my mom will pay
you back later later you just have like a
running tab with the store lady yeah yeah
well my mom did I just I just put it on her
it's a kid so you're supposed to do I think
this looks familiar
okay
I think this is it right here on the right
yeah it's right here the gate has changed
the gate has changed because it used to be
red right yep but this is this the store this
is the store right it looks the same right
oh this this that is the store you should
go see it you should go see if you still own
some money yeah I know pretty quick so this
white this is the fence or this is like the
gate that I remember but it used to be red
my mom says they like repainted a couple of
things and they also like change the fencing
and I think the house is probably completely
different but this is uh I think this is it
this is the house oh there's a cat
wow this house hon thank you what do we do
I mean I don't know can we park the bike and
just walk around
wow it's crazy to think that I I'm that I
used to live here I'm pretty sure this is
it because I remember the left side of the
house over there had the roof um like it was
like separate it was like a separate roof
like just like it is now but the thing is
this roof is brand new because it's so much
taller I remember when I was a kid it was
so low I could almost reach it myself so I
was thinking that you know maybe if the house
is the same I can ask to go see a tour from
the like the current like owners now but like
yeah it'd be so weird also it's completely
different so it's it's not it's not the same
housing all these memories flooding back no
no they've got they've upped their uh security
system though their security systems we used
to just have like a cement wall with like
broken glass on top to act as a deterrent
yeah um but now they actually have like barbed
wire hello all right
[Music]
I lost so much [Laughter] before yeah okay
so right as we popped out the camera just
so that we could take a better like video
of the house uh we just suddenly had a swarm
of people come up to me so apparently a lot
more people know me than I expected and that
you and that you know now because I mean yeah
yeah people just came out and said it's me
going it's like and then they're saying that
like oh I heard someone speaking English and
like I know like my mom said that like he
was coming by to like say hi and stuff and
I might be him so yeah I don't understand
any of that that's cool that's what happened
I didn't know and then Nicole's met them now
too I have heard about these people like for
the last 15 years like all of my adult life
and then they were really like eyeing you
to hunt I know that word thank you really
really cool to find like put a face to a name
and like yeah and I think feel the community
like it's so cool yeah that you haven't lived
here for 25 years and you walk in front of
your house everyone's like oh Miko if I went
back to the place that I was when I was six
I don't think anybody would anybody would
remember me so it's really cool it is kind
of cool yeah I think people are still living
here truly just like really neat to just be
in what feels like a strange place and be
recognized yeah you know wow so cool even
though we came looking for my childhood home
we didn't stay at the house too long The Neighbors
extended a warm Filipino reception and took
us out to dinner later that night despite
the fact that it's been 25 years since I lived
in the Philippines we were quickly welcomed
back into the community as if no time had
passed at all after sharing laughs stories
and lots of chicken we went back to the house
where we met more neighbors for my childhood
and even played with the next generation of
neighborhood kids in a funny way we came looking
for a single house and in the end found a
community that defined my childhood more than
I realized before we headed to dinner there
was just one last thing I wanted to show Nicole
I think it's actually called the rooms yeah
yeah actually a tourist attraction here and
I didn't realize but I live like only minutes
away from it well I think you always knew
you just didn't really realize that the tourist
attraction yeah that's true I thought it was
just a bunch of ruins the playground for children
in the community
[Music]
that's that's the ruins yeah holy smokes this
is like a castle
wow okay when you said runes I pictured like
ruins like like in Scotland or something not
like a castle you played on this as a kid
yeah I remember yeah you know what actually
uh it's actually a lot bigger than I remember
I remember just like jumping on rocks and
parts of the ruins but this is actually a
lot more well-built than bananas it's like
a real it's like a real standing thing I feel
like you understood this to me all these I
I think uh yeah I think my memory is a little
fuzzy guys it's pretty cool why did you come
here we had to pay to get in here I don't
know probably snuck in or something like that
I learned a bit more about the ruins so
so Farmer they had like sugarcane fields for
fields which is really popular there's lots
of farming of sugarcane so this man was really
wealthy him and his family built this Mansion
it was their home then during World War II
the axes actually burnt it down so that Filipinos
couldn't use it as like a military base to
operate that was actually burnt it for three
full days the intention was to burn to the
ground but it actually held up pretty well
like we bought these runes now and I think
this was super cool the runes are actually
in the private ownership of like the great
great grandchild of the original sugarcane
businessman who bought this place and built
it how cool nothing there about some hoodlum
neighborhood kids burning it down as The Story
Goes
I didn't even know about it that's why we
escaped to Canada
well it took us 15 years but thank you so
much for finally bringing me here I got it

hasn't been in the Philippines what's going
