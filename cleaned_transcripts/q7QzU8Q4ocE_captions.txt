- Beautiful churches
here in the Philippines.
This one is up in the
middle of the mountains,
we're quite high up.
Sometimes it gets cold up
here, and I got to say,
it doesn't get cold very
often in the Philippines,
so it's kind of a pleasure when it does.
So at this church,
they're building a new one
just next to it, but you could see
there's some statutes here
and a beautiful old face
of this old church in the beginning,
we'll see what it looks like in the future
once they build the new one.
So we're here up on a
mountain in the Philippines.
There's a lot of farmers around here.
It's a beautiful spot, but our focus today
isn't looking at beautiful
places as much as it is looking
for some fresh vegetables for Delish Deli.
We're hoping to connect
with some local farmers here
so we can both support them
and they can help support our restaurant
as we look for some great ingredients.
So glad to have you with us, let's go.

Hello.
So we drove about an hour
outside of the city today
to this beautiful mountain area.
The air here is so clean and pure.
It's a little bit colder
than when you're in the city
because the elevation is so much higher.
And when you look up from
the very top of the mountain,
where we are, what you see
is not only beautiful green scenery,
but also lots of farms,
people planting crops.
Often those will wind
up in the city to sell
to people there, but also
selling to locals here as well.
And we're hoping that today
we'll be able to find more
of what we need for Delish Deli.
Let's keep on our track.

Some amazing ginger here,
just kinda lying in the dirt,
ready to be bought.
I bet it tastes pretty good.
So we're here, these young
kids took to their parents
who are out here farming,
trying to help us find
some tomatoes on this particular farm,
but it looks like they're
just a little bit too small
to fit our hamburgers.
So hopefully more in luck next time.

We're looking for some a little bit bigger
for like a hamburger.
- [Man] Um, maybe these.
- Maybe these are the bigger size?
- [Man] Bigger size?
- Okay, I understand.
So we'll see if we have any luck here.
We're still cruising around.
We found some tomatoes
on the back of this truck
and we saw that they have
some lettuce in the back.
So hopefully we'll have some success here.
Thank you.
So we struck out again trying
to get some big tomatoes.
They look pretty delicious though,
so we still picked up a couple
of kilos that we'll use.
But hopefully we'll find some bigger ones
a little bit later today.

I talked before about Filipino ingenuity,
and this is one of my
favorite examples yet.
We've been traveling a long time today,
just to get from one side of
the mountain to the other,
to have a look at different
farms for vegetables.
And here you could see what they did is,
they did a zip line from here,
way over to the other
side of the mountain.
And the zip line is just to
carry vegetables and fruits
to the other side of the
mountain to shorten the trip.
So, well done Philippines.
(bright music)
So not a lot of luck today.
Tried finding some
vegetables for Delish Deli.
Had a great time traveling around
seeing the beautiful
scenery, but unfortunately,
we're gonna need to leave the
vegetables to another day.
As always, thank you for taking the time
to listen, and take care.
