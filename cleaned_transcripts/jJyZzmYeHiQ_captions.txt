SINCE ISLAMIC TERRORISTS
KIDNAPPED A MOTHER AND SON FROM
CAMPBELL COUNTY.
GERFA
AND KEVIN LUNSMANN
WERE ON VACATION IN THE
PHILLIPINES.
A GROUP LINKED TO AL QAEDA
BELIEVED THEM TO BE WEALTHY
AMERICANS... AND HELD THEM FOR
RANSOM.
DATELINE NBC WILL AIR THEIR
REMARKABLE TAIL OF SURVIVAL
RIGHT
HERE ON WSLS TOMORROW NIGHT.
WSLS 10'S ANGELA HATCHER IS
WORKING IN COLLABORATION WITH
DATELINE NBC TO SHARE THE
LUNSMANNS
STORY.
LINDSEY... MANY OF OUR VIEWERS
WILL
REMEMBER THE LUNSMANNS' ORDEAL.
I ACTUALLY REPORTED ON
THEIR KIDNAPPING FOR WSLS SIX
YEARS AGO.
BUT DATELINE IS TAKING US BACK
TO
THAT TIME... AND TAKING THE
MOTHER AND SON BACK TO THAT
PLACE.
GERFA LUNSMANN SAVED UP MONEY
FOR A SUMMER 2011 TRIP TO THE
PHILLIPINES.
SHE WANTED TO IMMERSE HER SON
KEVIN, THEN 14, IN HER NATIVE
CULTURE... SPENDING TWO WEEKS ON
A PENNISULA WITH
FAMILY.
GERFA LUNSMANN - "I WAS
PREPARING TO SEE THE SUNRISE ONE
MORE TIME BEFORE MY LONG
FLIGHT HOME WHEN THEY CAME."
KEVIN LUNSMANN - "IT WAS REALLY
TRANQUIL AND THEN ALL OF A
SUDDEN I HEAR THE SCREAM I
WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO
SCREAM IT WAS AND THEN I
REALIZE IT WAS MY MOTHERS
BECAUSE I NEVER HEARD HER SCREAM
LIKE THAT BEFORE."
KEVIN LUNSMANN - "I COULD HEAR
MY
MOM TALKING TO ME SAYING GET TO
THE MAN GROVE GET TO THE MAN
GROVE WE'VE GOT A RUN BUT I
WASN'T SURE WHAT WE WERE
RUNNING FROM AT THIS POINT."
GERFA'S FIRST THOUGHT WAS
ROBBERY... TO JUST GET OUT AND
LET THE GUNMEN TAKE WHATEVER
THEY WANTED.
THEY DIDN'T GET FAR. KEVIN
LUNSMANN - "WE WERE
STOPPED IN HER TRACKS ON THE
BEACH AND MEN WITH ASSAULT
RIFLES HAD SURROUNDED US." THEY
DIRECTED THE MOTHER AND
SON ONTO A BOAT.
KEVIN'S OLDER, FILIPINO COUSIN
GOT IN TOO... HOPING HE COULD
PROTECT THEM.
GERFA LUNSMANN - "THEY WERE NOT
TALKING TO US THEY WERE NOT
SAYING ANYTHING THEY WERE JUST
LIKE LOOKING AT US."
THEY LISTENED FOR THE SOUND OF
PASSING BOATS DURING A
TERRIFYING THREE HOUR VOYAGE...
BUT NOTHING.
HIS MOTHER'S SCREAM HAD STARTLED
KEVIN FROM HIS SLEEP.
OUT THERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
OCEAN, HE HOPED HE WAS JUST IN A
DREAM.
KEVIN LUNSMANN - "I JUST STARTED
PINCHING JUST PINCHING AND I
WASN'T WAKING UP. "
THE NIGHTMARE CONTINUED WHEN
THEY MADE IT TO SHORE.
THERE WERE MORE MEN WAITING FOR
THEM... TO LEAD
THEM ON A TRECHROUS, BAREFOOT
HIKE THROUGH A
JUNGLE SO THICK, THE MEN CUT A
PATH WITH KNIVES.
A COMMANDER ARRIVED AT THE
CAMP... AND SPOKE A DIALECT
GERFA KNOWS.
HE DEMANDED 100 MILLION DOLLARS.
GERFA LUNSMANN - "SO I WAS
TRYING
TO BARGAIN WITH HIM HERE WITH MY
LIFE THIS TIME SO HE FINALLY WAS
LIKE WELL HOW ABOUT $10 MILLION
AND THAT AMOUNT IS STILL
RIDICULOUS I KNOW THERE'S NO WAY
I COULD TALK TO HIM OR
CONVINCE HIM THAT I DON'T HAVE
THAT MONEY."
GERFA LUNSMANN - "AND I JUST
LOOK
UP UP IN HEAVEN AND I'M HOPING
HE
CAN TELL ME WHAT TO DO AND THIS
BEAUTIFUL STAR JUST LOOKS
DOWN AND I POINTED AT THEM AND
SAID IF YOU CAN GET THE STAR
MY HUSBAND CAN GIVE YOU 10
MILLION."
NIGHT SKY AFTER NIGHT SKY THEY
SAT INSIDE A TINY CAGE.... MADE
FROM LIMBS.
DATELINE NBC RECREATED IT BASED
ON SPECIFICATIONS
FROM GERFA AND KEVIN. THE SOUNDS
OF INSECTS AND
BIRDS AT CERTAIN TIMES HELPED
THEM KEEP TRACK OF DAYS.
KEVIN LUNSMANN - "WE DID KEEP
TRACK OF THE DATES BY
ENTERING THEM INTO WOOD INTO THE
CAGES WE DIDN'T PUT IN BUT
AT A POINT WE HAD GIVEN UP ON
THAT BECAUSE AFTER A SPAN OF
TIME YOU BEGIN TO FEEL HOPELESS
AND YOU DON'T WANT TO KEEP
FILLING IN THOSE TALLY
MARKS BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO
KNOW HOW LONG YOU'VE
BEEN THERE."
THEN SUDDENLY... ONE DAY...
AFTER THREE MONTHS...
KEVIN LUNSMANN -"THEY JUST
POINTED AT MY MOTHER AND SAID
SHE'S LEAVING."
KEVIN KNEW THEY WERE LYING WHEN
THEY TOLD HIM SHE'D BE BACK.
THE CAPTIVES HAD BEEN WAITING
FOR FOOD ALL DAY...
GERFA PROMISED TO BE BACK FOR
DINNER.
DID GERFA RETURN TO HER SON? HOW
DID KEVIN GET FREE?
WE'LL PICK UP THEIR STORY WHERE
WE JUST LEFT OFF TONIGHT
AT 11.
AND BE SURE TO WATCH FOR
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEWS WITH THE
LUNSMANNS AS THEY RETURNED TO
THE PHILLIPINES WITH THE
DATELINE
CREW... LEADING UP TO DATELINE
NBC
TOMORROW AT 1O... RIGHT HERE ON
WSLS.
IN THE STUDIO, ANGELA HATCHER,
WSLS 10.
