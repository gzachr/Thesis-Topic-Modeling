welcome to dumaguete
also known as the city of gentle people
and rank as one of the best place to
retire
in the world it is also known to be home
of some of the best natural attractions
in the country today let me take you to
one of the famous waterfalls here
in the island the pulangbato waterfalls
from the blue ocean colors by the city
we will be taking the greener route
and drive uphill there is one way to get
to the falls
and that is through a scenic road
through the mountains and rivers
going up is not as challenging as it
used to be
since there is only a short stretch of
rough road compared to what it was
back in the day
to get there you could simply commute to
the next town
named valencia and take a motorcycle for
hire
to drive you up you can also take a
public jimny
direct from dumaguete city as it has a
regular brute
up to the intersection going to the
falls from there
you can hire someone to drive you on a
motorcycle up to the falls
or do a quick 15 minute uphill hike
from the same intersection commuting
would cost you around four to five
dollars converted from philippine peso
another easier way is to go through a
tour guiding agency van
with a group of other tourists or rent
your own motorcycle
or scooter you could use to drive
yourself up there
if you know how to but today we decided
to go
up with our own personal car this is the
most comfortable and
fastest way to get there which would
take 15
to 20 minutes from the city on our way
to our destination
the view is refreshingly breathtaking
you can see the mountains
filled with healthy forest and the river
slowly changing its use the change of
river rock color
is one of the signs that you are
actually on the right path
but one place you can't miss is the
sulphuric vents
just at the entrance of the road
intersection going to the falls
the cloud-like gas emissions are a
result
of what used to be an active volcano the
geothermal plant a few kilometers away
uses this as a source to produce
electricity
some say this helps release pressure
from the mountains
i must warn you though the vents are a
beautiful sight
but get too close you'll feel the
extreme heat from the boiling water
and steam it produces and inhale its
pungent odor
a lot of tourists make this a stop over
for photos
since this isn't a common site you will
see elsewhere in the country
just a few steps from the vent there you
will find the intersection
where the sign going to the falls is
located
we then take a right turn to a smaller
road through a narrow bridge
across the river here you can start to
see the rock's color
starting to be evident from its source
and
our destination you will also get to
pass by a hot spring
that is like a natural sauna we then
drive
uphill through another bridge and
finally reach
our destination
[Music]
welcome to pulang battle falls which is
translated to
red from the local word pulac and rock
from the word
the false name is taken from its obvious
red-colored rocks
which gives it the distinct
characteristic compared to
other neighboring faults a few
kilometers away
ulangbato falls is located in the koi
valley
in the town of palinpinon valencia
negrosi rental
a two dollar fee is required to get in
the place
with that you can enjoy the place for
the whole day
they recently upgraded a viewing deck
where picture taking is
perfect with the falls as your backdrop
they also added a hanging bridge
and a concrete pathway to get you down
to the waterfalls
easier quicker and safer the natural red
rocks are a result
from the presence of sulfur but it's
nothing to worry about
since the sulfuric content is minimal
and thus making it
safe for swimming the natural lagoon
found at the basin of this waterfall
is very cool and refreshing almost like
an
ice bath who wouldn't be tempted to take
a dip or jump in
the pool is actually deep enough for you
to dive in
many tourists and locals climb their way
in the surrounding rocks
and use it as a diving point
the natural design surrounding the
waterfalls is amazing
it is almost as if someone chiseled
layers of rocks and formed them
into these rectangular and triangular
shapes
some say this was a result when lava
passed through here
centuries ago as this mountain is a
potentially
active volcano
the water is actually clear when you
look up close
even the pool produces an almost
aquamarine color
which complements the orange and red
color surrounding it
you can come all year round but better
to avoid rainy season
the water from the falls gets to be a
bit murky
[Music]
despite the presence of structures
nature is still dominant
with flora presence all around the place
from colorful leafy plants to giant fern
bamboo and flowers
[Music]
this attraction has now become one of
the most
famous places tourists come all year
round
even celebrities have come to see this
place for themselves
people here love that you can both
appreciate nature
and spend quality time with both
families and friends
but if you are not into getting wet they
have a snack
area just in front of the falls where
you can sit and relax while enjoying the
view
they also have rooms where you can spend
the night in
you can also rent tables and native
cottages
or a whole convention area for bigger
[Music]
groups

so

[Music]
so
[Music]
aside from the main waterfall there is
also a smaller waterfall that provides
water for the man-made pools this is
perfect for families and their kids
people often prefer this compared to the
cold
and chilly waters of the falls

so if you are in the philippines come to
dumaguete city
and experience its natural wonders like
the pulangbato waterfalls
i highly recommend it for those who love
to be in the comfort
of being with nature
[Music]
you
