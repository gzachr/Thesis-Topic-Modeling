Hello everyone welcome back to my
channel! So for today as what you can see
from the title below this is going to be
my graduation makeup tutorial video for
this year 2018. Sorry if my hair looks messy, I just tried a deep wave curling iron a while ago.
the thing is I don't have a hairspray to hold the curls of my hair.
That's why my hair is all over the place.
So, without further a do, let's proceed to the video!
So, first things first, I need to put moisturizer on my face.
And for me what I would like to use is the IWHITEKOREA Aqua Whitening vita moisturizer.
And this product is popular in the Philippines.
I will just spread the moisturizer on my face mostly the areas that are dry.
So, let's talk about graduation. I graduated last 2012. It's been 6 years since I graduated.
So for the primer, I will use this NYX Angel Veil Primer.
I think a lot of people are already familiar in this product,
because there are a lot of local and international youtubers who loves and raves this primer.
By the way I will just spread the primer right on the center of my face.
Usually, I don't put primer on the outer part of my face. I don't need to put the product  all over my face.
For the foundation, what I have in here is the wet n wild photo focus foundation in the shade of bronzed beige.
I used and tested this already with flash photography and this foundation is really good with flash.
And this foundation is medium to full coverage. Actually it is not full coverage, it is somewhere in between of medium to semi full coverage.
So, I 'am just going to apply this foundation all over my face.
I know this applicator is unhygienic because I need to dip back and forth the applicator to the bottle.
So it's up to you guys if you want a full coverage foundation
By the way, my skin type is DRY.
