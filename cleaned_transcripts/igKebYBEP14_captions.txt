Hi guys! this is movie park in Bottrop,
Germany
before we start we just want to thank
our returning subscribers for your
continuous support and to our new
viewers today and new subscribers thank
you so much for watching pinay mom's blogs.
Yes! (speaks in dutch) This theme
park consists of seven areas that are
based on movies and TV series.  There are actual film studios nearby the park
much like that Universal Studios in
California for those of you who've been
there. This was formerly named Warner
Brothers movie world Germany in 1996 but
this parks actually been open since 1967
under various ownerships.
Because we have younger kids we stayed
most the time in the Nickelodeon area
but before we show you that area there's
an interesting stunt show here on Studio
6 that we'd like for you to watch!
if you'd like to watch more of the stunt
show and I recommend you should click on
this link on the upper right side of
your screen or on the description box
below.
And now we will show you Nick land.
What we like about this side of the
theme park is that although they are
very strict with height requirements on
certain rides there's plenty of soft rides
for the little ones to choose from
and the latest addition to Nick land is
Adventure Bay which opened only this
year and featured paw patrol characters
meet and greet.
Now it's time for a quick lunch. We're
staying here for two days so stay tuned!
