NARRATOR: Playing hide and
seek with aircraft carriers
is a new kind of warfare.
With longer range planes, the
Japanese may strike first.
The battle of the Philippine
Sea will be the biggest carrier
battle in naval history.
American radar picks
up incoming planes.
The Japanese have found them.
Carriers scramble their
F6F Hellcats to meet them.
The two massive navies are
still hundreds of miles apart,
so it comes down to one pilot
against another in white
knuckle split-second dogfights.
American ships blast
away from below.
Japan made its planes lighter
by shedding heavy armor.
They gained range
but lost muscle.
In aerial fist fights, they
simply can't take a punch.
American Hellcats shoot
down over 20 planes
from the first attack wave.
Naval anti-aircraft
fire hit a dozen more.
One Japanese bomber scores a hit
in the Battleship South Dakota.
Twenty-four sailors are
killed under a halo of smoke.
Then a second attack wave
comes in, 128 planes.
Navy pilot George Kirk joins
the fray in his Hellcat.
GEORGE KIRK: Zero came and
zoomed right in front of me.
He was chasing another Hellcat.
We crossed, and I was
able to light him up.
I saved that other guy.
NARRATOR: This attack wave
fares even worse than the first.
GEORGE KIRK: They
hit no ships at all.
Many end up in the sea.
NARRATOR: By the time the
fourth Japanese wave comes in,
they are scattered
and disorganized.
Some don't even find
the American fleet.
It's a complete route.
Americans nickname it, The
Great Marianas Turkey Shoot.
