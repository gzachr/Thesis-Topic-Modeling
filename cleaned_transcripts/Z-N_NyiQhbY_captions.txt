Morning everyone.
We just made it back to San Fernando.
We were visiting friends in another part of town.
And now we're heading out of San Fernando to Lapu-Lapu
So, we're grabbing our bags and getting ready to head out.
Roosters everywhere here.
Training to fight.
Ok, our ride is here.
Bye! Bye! Thank you.
This way sir.
So, this is our hotel room.
We have a nice little kitchen unit.
Nice beds.
Ok TV.
And this is the view from the balcony.
We're here at the supermarket.
Just picking up some snacks for the hotel.
The mangos in the Philippines are amazing.
I have to say like I could eat almost an endless amount of the fruit here.
I'm going to get some calamansi.
It's good with drinks and stuff.
Ok, we're back at the hotel now.
Just kicking back for a few hours.
And then we might check out Cebu City.
Keeping the ball rolling.
There's actually a lot of foreigners here.
Mango Square.
We're checking out J Ave Super Club
