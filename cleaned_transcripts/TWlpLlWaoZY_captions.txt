that you guys on YouTube like to see 
people trying to eat McDonald's so we  
figured while we're in the Philippines we'll 
try the Filipino McDonald's so let's [Music]
go okay so right off the bat I'm seeing if 
they have a spaghetti I haven't seen there  
elsewhere um they have chcken nuggets sh 
Burgers fish Fried Chicken on the which  
I do notice a little bit more in other 
countries and sa making matches we are
in right now and yeah we're done it's 
done the bathroom we will [Music]
order okay just looking at the menu here's how 
the sections go they have the M mix andax the  
drinks the coffee the fries chicken mixure 
about and then this is something I noticed  
in Asia the pasta and rice bowls so I'm 
not going to get that but we'll take a  
look at that so they just have the pasta The 
Rice Bowl Happy Meal which is everywhere and  
all right we're going to order something 
else I noticed different about this is the  
options of fries I've never seen this they 
have the Twister fries large fries shake  
shake fries with cheese and barbecue 
I think they shake it up with a season
interesting okay so the total is 612 which is 
just a little over $10 right and this is what we
got all right see you when you're
eating all right now we're waiting for our food 
I'm sorry I'm extremely red we were out on the  
boat all day if you guys are new here we are an 
American family that lives in Bali Indonesia and  
during our children's School breaks we like to 
travel um so if you can please go ahead and drop  
us a comment subscribe to us give us a like let 
us know what type of content you want to see we  
love to have fun and create content for you guys 
but now we're going to get into eating something I  
noticed that I've never seen anywhere is they 
have gravy here maybe that's because people  
like to eat gravy with the chicken I think it's a 
popular thing with fried chicken in the philippin  
okay so they only have ketchup and gravy here 
which is interesting seen in Indonesia where  
I live they have chili which I love and the 
one thing that they don't have I've noticed  
anywhere over here is honey mustard which is my 
absolute favorite the McDonald's honey mustard  
sauce is the best um but okay it's ketchup 
for today so now I'm just still waiting on the
[Music] food okay looks good okay so dy's 
going to go first let me go first guys so  
let's try curly [Music] fries oh they're 
really good all right really good 10 out  
of 10 and he got a quarter pounder with 
cheese quar Pounder with cheese all right  
the burger looks very large compared to the 
bun all right how you spiced up pepper do  
this thing to go tastes like Checkers or not 
Checkers but um Arby's tastes like Arby's fres
than looks like a lot of hambur
here yeah all right your turn how

into it all right trying the curly
fries just like obvious like he said let me 
try it with the gravy I'm not a gravy person
okay they're good I'm very hungry right 
now the Coke and fit water down but I  
think it's because so hot out the 
ice is melting and we'll get into  
the cheeseburger fun fact I never ate 
cheeseburgers since I was pregnant with  
my small little baby and now I love 
them so now I'm going to CH bur po

pickle tomato and like I like no salt

food not fast food like McDonald's is really  
the best way to go you know the realest food
