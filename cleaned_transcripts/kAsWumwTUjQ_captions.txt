so you're notified every time we release
a new video so today's a food uh savory
first one is
frying from fry and pop nachos
garlic crackers yeah this looks so
interesting
this reminds me of the shrimp chips or
the shrimp crackers um i think we
purchased some from vietnam a long time
ago and just kind of plop it into the
hot oil and it like puffs up but these
look a little bit different it's
onion and garlic
my favorite type yeah and i cooked them
in the hot hot oil it takes only eight
seconds to cook
and
this is it yeah it smells good and it
looks delicious
it looks different from the shrimp chips
i have to say the shrimp chips is more
like
like
random you know like
wavy shaped you know chips whereas these
are kind of like ridged
yeah so it's quite interesting
this one is similar to a shape is
different but similar to puri
puri foodie ah the indian food
yeah similar but
different shape and puri is a hollow on
the inside as well okay so are you ready
yeah i'm actually kind of excited for
this
and garlic is not super yeah yeah i was
just going to say that yeah not very
strong you know like um i usually try to
avoid eating anything with onions or
garlic
like save if i'm gonna go meet someone
but this one you don't have to worry too
much you do have the onion garlic flavor
but it's very very subtle and once again
very crispy and delicious
it's really good
the next one is a package of crackers
from a brand called sunflower these are
sunflower crackers cheesy onion flavor
crispy thin yummy all in one that's what
it says in the package and this package
comes with 10 packs
of four
bin crackers
they are i think they're
like much thinner than like the saltine
crackers for example maybe
half the thickness of those
hmm it smells really i smell it i can't
see
because it's too thin
cheesy onions smell it love it i know
right
it smells really good
this makes me so hungry
[Music]
this is delicious
this will go really great with beer or
even wine
i love onion i love the cheese i love it
i love the cheese and the onion
these are really good crackers
very light and flaky and
i think this would taste even better
with some cheese on the top
cheese on top of the cheese on your
crackers
yeah
sounds good that's right that's right
next up is called the ding dong mixed
nuts from jbc okay mixed nuts why i do
like mixed nuts how many kinds
um well on the package it says
this one has um green peas cracker nuts
peanuts
fava beans and cornick i'm not sure what
cornick means what what's cornick
what is that so five like corn nuts
like five items yeah i do see the green
beans i see the fava
um i see the peanuts
so
maybe maybe this is a cornick oh i don't
know
let's just try
and cracker nuts what are cracker dads i
don't know okay i'm gonna just pop a
whole bunch in my mouth so at the same
time
ah
the corn nuts so those are called
cornick
yeah they call them corn nuts in america
i see here in japan what do they call
corn nuts
i don't know
i forgot we do have them here do we have
we do but i forgot what they're called
giant corn
it's called giant corn
that's right
villa ready
salty
perfect with beer this one
yeah there's no specific flavor i think
it's just mixed nuts salted mixed nuts
really just salt i think i don't know i
don't know
but they have rainbows right well there
is sugar
and of course vegetable oil
and of course monosodium glutamate which
is a flavor enhancer yum yum yum so the
next one is from jack and jill and these
are chicken skin
neat mango juan or me monk one
and these are crackling chips with
chicken skin flavor chicken isn't that
interesting it's not chicken flavors
chicken skin flavor which tells you
that i'm just assuming
uh in the philippines they love chicken
skin
oh
i'm assuming of course is it like
coricola
yakitori ingredients
yeah i mean yeah there are many people
in japan that like chicken skin as well
my mother her favorite yakitori which is
guru chicken on skewer
is a liver and chicken skin very crispy
type yeah she doesn't like regular
chicken yakitori yeah i know you're not
really a huge fan of chicken skin but
i'm curious to see
what this smells like
chicken skins because this is not
chicken skin it's a snack
oh my god they made it taste like
chicken skin
it tastes like
salted
chicken skin that has been deep fried
damn
that's delicious and you know this is
made with potatoes
yeah it doesn't even seem like you're
eating potatoes it actually for me
i only taste the chicken skin no
i like this
opinion
you don't even like the taste of chicken
skin
i love that one
okay let's go on to the next one called
yeah it does
i wonder if it tastes like ritz crackers
it kind of does remind me of ritz
crackers
the difference though is it's not salted
the ritz crackers i believe that there's
on one side of the the cracker
i i
i remember there's some salt
but this one there's no salt
i think this is very good for
patty
with some cheese but they're good on
their own has a slight sweetness which i
like
um
yeah like a good cracker should be
next is called tomi super sweet corn
flavored corn chips so these are corn
chips that are flavored with sweet corn
i like that yeah me too and they do look
like corn chips they remind me of fritos
i wonder if they taste the same looks a
little bit of farm mom crispy type not
no crispy
oh it's different from just regular corn
chips
who like cream corn yeah it tastes like
cream corn to me
um
in japan
i think a japanese person would say
this reminds them of uh corn potage soup
kind of reminds me of that too
interesting
i thought it was just going to be like a
sweeter
corn chip
but it actually tastes like sweet corn
so next one is chef tony's country
cheddar popcorn yum
wow this looks yummy i love popcorn
my tub of happiness my type of happiness
i love i love that it comes in this tub
you know
that you can close again so you don't
have to finish the other one oh and look
at that
you love that i do and it looks so much
better than like just plain popcorn
you can you can like literally see the
flavorings on the popcorn
really good popcorn wow
what is it
mmm
it's like sweet cheese popcorn i don't
remember
the
cheese popcorn with the sweet onion but
these are matches
you know what this reminds me of um
you know the chicago mix from garrett's
popcorn they have they combine cheese
and caramel so you get both the cheesy
and the caramel flavor kind of reminds
me of that
not as sweet as that because this is
country cheddar with just a little bit
of sweetness
interesting
finally we have two packages of instant
noodles
the first one is uh pansi canton
calamansi flavor and the second one is
fancy canton chilemansi flavor
kalamansi is delicious it's a citrus
fruit
that's very popular in the philippines
in japan we have something similar in
okinawa right
yeah i wonder if it's the same thing
and
these two are from a brand called lucky
me
and it's advertised that they're using
dinner noodles
it says
yeah and each bag comes with um
a flavoring packet as well as a dark
sauce and some what it looks like oil
some kind of oil
okay so pretty straightforward to make
it only took about three minutes
and you prepared some toppings to go
with the boiled shrimp chicken and green
onions this one is a surprise noodle and
a little bit different from making way
for japanese noodles
first i we put the sauces and
condiments on the plate and mix it
and after that
boil
noodles
3 minutes drain water and put on the
sauce soup
and mix it right super super easy sorry
and then put the toppings on and finish
yes
toppings easy i imitated the pikachu of
the podcast
well you did a good job
and cheeky yeah i i just cannot wait to
try it out now i don't know if this is
the calamansi or the chili monsieur i
see i think this one is lighter color
okay so
so maybe it's the color one
[Music]
[Music]
super refreshing yes the calamansi river
the very different chicken
wow
but the sauce has so much flavor so it's
not just citrusy but it's also
savory
flavorful
[Music]
[Music]
um
the texture of the noodles
is perfect two and a half minutes
perfect
wow
this is yummy
like i could eat
two bowls of these i think the
foreign noodles
i totally agree with you i do yeah
japanese
i wonder what it is
maybe it's because um the japanese
noodles we use a lot of soy sauce based
sauces
so you know soy sauce is salty to begin
with and also even our like um tonkatsu
sauce the yakisoba sauce you know it's
kind of like the worcestershire sauce
but even that is more of the salty side
a little bit sweet salty not but not as
salty as this
okay so let's try the next one okay yeah
uh definitely this one was a kind of
monthly one because there was no spice
in it
okay
chili monsieur pancakes
basically
it's the same refreshing calamity flavor
but with
chili there's chili sauce or chili
spices
caffeine has a cake cake
first i thought
it was the same
with the first one
but later
the spiciness
but it's a lot
comfortably spicy foam oh it's good
sometimes it's it's fun to try
other countries instant noodles
i love them i mean
one of one of my favorite things to do
is try instant noodles from different
countries mm-hmm
[Music]
can you guys tell that we are actually
super enjoying these noodles
i want to look for another flavor
me too
me too i wonder what what other kind of
um
noodles the philippines has
i'm sure they have soup noodles as well
i'm assuming they have soup noodles
yeah maybe other flavors that doesn't
have kalamazoo
that'll be kind of interesting maybe
they have like instant spaghetti because
i know that the philippines their
spaghetti is a little bit different
it is similar to spaghetti napolitan
that we have in japan but sweeter i
think their ketchup is a little sweeter
um yeah i i only had it once in my life
so i don't quite remember
exactly but i remember it being sweeter
but
you know this was a lot of fun for me
because i'm very interested
in filipino cuisine and it's so
unfortunate that
we don't know that much about filipino
cuisine we really know
well now we know pancetta and we know
olympia we know porca dobo chicken
nugget because we love those of course
we know how to hollow
but
what else do we know i think that's
about it so
what were your favorites today
yeah this is pretty unfair because the
panzer is incredible
but everything it was pretty interesting
for me
these crackers everything was delicious
to me nice
and also this sunflower crabgrass yeah
even even that one cheese
yeah
i i i found the the popcorn to be
especially tasty that popcorn is also
very good yeah country cheddar that
that's pretty superior popcorn in my
opinion and this sweet
is also it's going to be like stupid but
but i guess i guess if um we were to
choose um our favorite i guess mine
would be the panzi kenton as well that's
delicious so good and then my second
favorite would be
the um
actually the sunflower crackers oh
cheesy onion crackers i've never really
had like uh crackers that look like like
this but with a cheesy oniony flavor and
you know it's very very thin and light
once again thank you so much angela for

wait to try out the sweets that you sent
