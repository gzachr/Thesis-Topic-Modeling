okay so I made it here into the shop and 
unfortunately the owner isn't here but one  
of the people who works here so um we're gonna 
check out we're gonna he's gonna show us some  
of the bikes and talk about the prices so 
how much is this one uh this one is ADV uh  
1000 per day one thousand per day yes this 
is one thousand per day okay it's the Honda  
that's a nice one by the way what about this 
one this is the aerox this is the version two  
why connect uh 900 per day 900 yeah and then 
this is the index and Max version 2 also but  
not the keyless one not the the ABS one so 
this is 800 per day 800 per day yeah guys  
are doing construction out there it's too loud 
but that's the one that I rented right here yeah
155 CC right yeah okay um how much is that 
one normally uh 800 per day and then what  
about that other 125 right there the meal 
one two five hundred five under four days
you see it's also uh 500 per day okay so 
this other two 125 cc's are 500 per day yeah  
um 150 cc but it was all uh printed out printed 
out okay yeah and then uh what you guys do when  
you work like let's say people rent it for a week 
or two weeks will you be like discounts or were  
you guys working yeah we did discounts like if 
you're gonna rent the all for the units like  
less 50 per day like if it's seven uh 800 then it 
will be 700 per day okay and then for a month less  
to 100 per day okay okay so I know these prices 
are pretty expensive they're kind of ridiculous  
but there's really not too many shops here in 
Cebu and I think the prices are honestly just  
pretty expensive so the lady was cool she hooked 
me up she gave me a good deal because I'm making  
a video about the shop and it was good I had no 
problems with the bike everything was smooth it  
was easy I just gave her my driver's license and 
I uh was checking out gave her 2 000 peso deposit  
which is about 30 35 bucks and uh you're just 
supposed to bring it back with a full tank of gas  
so yeah it was easy it was good check this place 
out for sure also to rent though it's an extra  
helmet was only 100 pesos for the week so that 
was a good deal and it was unlimited kilometers  
as well it was unlimited miles they said you can 
take it all around the island and it's all good  
so let me know if this helped let me know in the 
comments if there's any other questions that I  
didn't answer and I'll answer them and I hope you 
enjoyed this video and we'll see you next time
