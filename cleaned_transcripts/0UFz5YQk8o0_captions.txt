Hello everyone
Today i make this video in the afternoon
usually i make it in the morning
i hope that lights are good
Today i want to listen a new singer from wish 107.5
I hope she's good as the others
But I have no doubt
i'm sure she's very good
She will sing a version of Listen by Beyonce
i'm curious to listen that version because
I've seen that there is also a version of Morissette Amon
And I know you like it so much
We will soon hear that too
I had a small problem with the Janelle Salvador video
Due to copyright
I do not know if it is visible to everyone
I think that in some countries it has been blocked
well..
I want to talk about something
I'm not a true music connoisseur
You have a guy in front of you, that listen music as like you
that listen dragged by emotions
by the notes
When I listen to a song
I feel any musical variation, i think music is most important than words
But the fusion between words and music
Can give even stronger emotions
The chills on the back
tears
A powerful song, can charge you in the morning
I appreciate any kind of feeling that it transmits to me
I feel that song has come
All this is not just from notes
But also the way the singer sends to you his message
Now let's hear this girl
Among all the videos I've seen, the one that struck me more
it was Morissette Amon
Both with the voice and with her way of singing
she fascinates me
I like how she transmits her words
her sound
Now, this new girl is called eumee capile
let's see how she goes
I'm speechless
I like, I think she is a little girl of stature
But she's an incredible powerful voice
I like her expressions
One of the things I admire in a singer is how much he can transmit emotions even with the look
With the gestures,
With the movements
The way he closes his eyes
This girl has it all
Very good, Eumee
It's a nice fight between her and Morissette Amon
But, for now, Morissette is still in the top spot
Good Eumee, beautiful voice, beautiful interpretation
The only "defect" is that she use too much virtuosity with the voice
But she can afford this
i like she
So...
You've seen how she struck me
i'm human as like all
I think even some of you have had the same reaction
But for now, no one singer has made me feel the chills in my back
Will there be a singer who will succeed in doing so ??
