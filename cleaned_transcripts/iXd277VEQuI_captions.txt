Good bye Manila.
Today guys, I'm leaving this big city.
I'm going down south to one of the islands, Bohol.
One of the beautiful, beautiful islands
here in the Philippines and
on the way to the airport right now,
thanks to Mr JR, he's picked me up in his beautiful
Toyota Innova car.
So I just called this from Grab, and normally with Grab
I'm just getting an ordinary,
kind of beat up car, but I got this
beautiful Toyota Innova and riding in style.
Apparently this used to be part of Grab Premium
but they don't have Grab Premium anymore, right?
The two things merged, when business slowed
down during the pandemic so
yeah, for the price of an ordinary Grab car
I'm riding in style today. Thank you
Mister JR. Okay.
Let's make our way to the airport, Terminal 4,
is where we're leaving from, the domestic terminal.
Thank you JR. See you next time bro. Cheers.
- Have a good one Dale.
Have a good one, have a good one.
I'm going to Bohol.
Thank you. Cheers.
Okay guys, so this terminal 4,
looks like kind of a budget terminal and small.
It's only really Air Asia and a couple of other airlines,
that I don't know what they are
and apparently there's no lounge in this airport.
None at all.
Terminals 1, 2 and 3, they have lounges
and terminal 4, they don't have a lounge so,
that's unfortunate.
Straight through security, so that was good.
Just a little security bit there. In fact, that's the check-in area there.
You can see how small this airport is.
And this is the departure lounge here.
Like I said, no actual lounge that yer man could take advantage of.
I'm just kind of stuck here for the next hour and a half, actually.
Yeah, I guess I'm gonna find some breakfast from
one of these wee cafes.
Cafe France has sandwiches and stuff
and Vin-Vin's Cafe has what looks like Filipino food.
And the prices, like 175 there for rice and beef.
So you're talking maybe $3.50 or something for a meal.
Not too bad for airport prices, to be honest.
I think that's probably what I'm gonna end up doing and
maybe a wee Mister Donut for dessert.
Thing is, if I buy food, where am I gonna eat it?
All the tables are are taken, guys.
Well, I've got plenty of time.
I'll just hang around a bit until there's free tables,
then I'll go and get myself some food.
And for now I'll just plonk myself down here and chill.
So they're boarding one flight now to Surigao,
so a bunch of people clearing out but for every person that's cleared out,
I think at least one more has come in.
The place is still busy, and I'm starving guys.
It's 10:30 AM. I'm not normally hungry in the morning.
A lot of times I skip breakfast but today I'm starving.
I'm not even normally awake at this time, at 10:30 AM.
And I'm starving so I'm gonna get something
and I've noticed over at that side there, there's a Papa Johns pizza.
What do you think guys? Pizza for breakfast?
I dunno. I'm gonna feel like a little bit of a degenerate
eating pizza for breakfast but, yeah.
I feel like it. I feel like it right now guys,
so I'm gonna get some pizza.
Hi, are you selling by the slice?
Yes sir.
Can I get?
Per slice and per box.
What is it?
Per slice, per box.
Per slice or per box?
One slice is?
70.
- 70 pesos.
Can I have two slices of this Hawaiian?
I think it's Hawaiian.
Ham and pineapple right?
Yes.
Okay, that'll be good.
That's good.
Don't have to wait. It's already ready.
140 sir.
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you so much.
Okay, I'll sit here and enjoy my pizza.
If I want more, the Papa Johns
is right there so it's good.
I'll sit and munch these two
slices for now though.
Where are you going today?
Surigao.
Surigao? That's the flight there.
Surigao.
No, no, later.
Oh, you have a later flight?
Ah, okay.
What time is your flight?
1:40.
1:40?
Oh my God.
Why you get here so early?
Early birds.
Yeah, my flight is at 11:40 and I feel like
I'm waiting a long time.
Wow.
So you have another three hours?
Yeah.
Wow.
It's better to be early than to be late.
Right?
Yeah, but like, do you live in Manila or?
Laguna.
Laguna?
Ah, okay.
You were here staying in a hotel or something?
No.
We came from Laguna.
Laguna?
Laguna from here.
Laguna. How far is Laguna from Manila?
Like an hour from here.
Oh, so you had to travel an hour to Manila?
Yeah.
So you didn't know about traffic and everything?
It's really traffic.
Oh, sometimes you could get stuck in the traffic.
That's why you were early?
Ah, okay, I understand. Yeah.
My hotel...
- You're vlogging?
Yeah, I'm vlogging.
My hotel's only like 20 minutes drive.
So it was easy for me.
But still I feel like I got here too early.
But no problem there is pizza.
So, it's all good.
- Yeah.
It's a good pizza.
Yeah, it's a good pizza. It is a good pizza.
Guys, they have an all-gender toilet.
That's good. I like that.
A toilet that nobody uses but anyone can use.
So, I just made use of it. Nice and clean.
A nice clean toilet, guys.
Right, now looking for a drink.
There's this Seattle Coffee down there.
I don't like coffee but maybe I can get
a matcha green tea or something.
Ah, they do have matcha green tea latte there.
All this is coffee, which I don't like,
but they have one matcha green tea latte.
And guys, look at that.
They have Caramelized Spam Collection.
They're advertising Spam croissants and Spam Sandwiches.
That would never work in the UK.
Spam is considered like the lowest quality,
cheapest food that you could possibly get.
Like, if you're homeless basically, that's what you're eating,
Spam, so they're advertising that as if it's something
special or something.
Kinda weird.
Hello, how are you?
Good, I want matcha
- I'm fine, thank you.
green tea latte please. The large one.
Hot matcha sir?
You can do ice?
We only have ice blended.
Ice blended? Yeah, good, okay.
Large?
Large, please.
210. Your name?
210, Dale.
Your name?
Dale.
- Dale.
Thank you for paying exact amount, sir.
Okay, 210.
This for me? Oh, looks good. Thank you.
Welcome.
Good.
This is just as good as the matcha frappuccinos I get from Starbucks,
except Seattle, they have the plastic straw, so it's more enjoyable.
Have fun.
Yeah, you too.
Enjoy your time at the airport.
Safe flight.
Okay, gonna join here.
-Dale?
Hi, how are you?
Fine, sir.
You're working here?
Yeah.
Ah, I've seen you've got the badge.
I'm going to Tagbilaran.
Yeah, I'm a follower.
In Bohol, that's,
hopefully I've got the right place,
it's called Taglabar...
Tagbilaran
Yeah, Tagbilaran.
But Bohol is the place that I'm going.
Please wear your mask.
You don't have a face mask?
Yeah, but I'm drinking.
Yeah, okay, okay.
I'm drinking just now.
Okay.
Wow, they still make you wear face masks here. Unbelievable.
Pretty much every country in the world,
you can board a flight without a mask,
but in the Philippines you still need a mask.
Wow.
I'm drinking.
Wow, I thought we were taking a bus to the plane,
but we're actually just going for a walk.
We're being led like sheep to the plane,
and I'm literally the last person to board, guys.
So I bought the premium package so that I could board first,
but I'm actually boarding last, but I'm okay with it.
And I thought this was gonna be easy because
I thought had booked the first row, a first row seat.
I've actually booked the emergency row seat, in the 14th row, so
I'm gonna be in the middle.
This is gonna be a bit of a hassle.
Okay, I'm the last one on.
- Exit row...
Exit row, yeah?
- Yeah
Okay, so I'm the last one on.
Hopefully I can find room in these
overhead compartments for,
look, they're all full.
Hopefully I can find room for my baggage.
Yeah, that's my seat there.
Right there, got the window seat.
Ah, plenty of room. That's good.
Doing good.
Sorry bro, I'm gonna jump in there.
Okay, good.
And it looks like, nobody in the middle seat, guys. That's good.
Nobody in the middle seat. I'm the last one on.
We did good.
Did good.
Plenty of leg room, guys. This is nice and comfortable.
Right here, as you can see. Definitely worth it.
Definitely worth paying for that premium package,
even though I didn't get my priority boarding.
I'm actually getting a meal as well, included,
so that's something to look forward to,
during this two hour flight.
Two hour flight, Manila to Bohol.
Whenever the seat belt sign is on,
you must return to your seat
and fasten your seat belt securely.
So guys, this is what I've ordered as my meal.
I pre-booked it online, actually. There was four or five choices.
Yeah, I think four choices, and this is the one that I chose, the tapa.
Beef tapa. So I've had that before. It was called Tapsilog.
Silog is rice and egg. So this comes with rice and egg.
So this is basically tapsilog, the chewy kind of beef jerky with rice and egg.
And these are the other choices. You can get chicken,
this nasi lemak, the Malaysian dish,
and a Thai basil chicken.
So all the Asian choices.
You've got your choice of the Asian meals there.
And I think you can actually buy more stuff,
actually on the on the flight, like coffees, teas, sandwiches, noodles, M&Ms,
all sorts of snacks, they come around.
You have a choice to buy them.
Looking forward to my beef tapa.
Thank you.
Be careful, it's hot
I'll just put it on your tray table.
- Okay
Thanks.
And yours.
Cheers.
- Enjoy your meal, thank you.
Okay.
Yeah, it's not bad at all. It's not that much different to the
tapsilog I had in the restaurant in Manila, actually.
So for an airplane meal it's pretty decent.
And I'm just looking
out at the clouds guys and
doesn't that over there look like a face?
Is it just me or does that look like a
face sticking out of the clouds there?
A big old head.
Looks like there's some kind of little island resort there.
Looks proper isolated from the main island.
Here we are, landing in Bohol.
Well actually landing in the Bohol Regency.
This island we're landing on is called Panglao.
It's a small island that's right next to the big Bohol island and connected by a bridge.
That's where the airport is and that's where my hotel is gonna be.
You see all these resorts along the coast there.
Yeah, gonna be staying in one of those.
Dear guests, we have just landed at Bohol Panglao International Airport.
The time now is 59 minutes past the hour of 12.
Bye, thank you.
- Thank you.
Thank you so much, thank you.
So this flight, Hi.
- Hello sir.
This flight was about 200 bucks, including the premium package,
which is kinda expensive for a short domestic flight.
Actually it was only an hour and 10 minutes but it's only just after 1pm,
right now. We took off at, I guess 11:40, 11:45 ish and yeah,
if I was taking the same kinda distance flight in the UK,
it would be like a quarter the price, a third the price, like that,
although I did book this flight a few days ago, so I'm probably
paying the highest price of any of these guys.
I'm pretty sure most of these guys probably paid
like half as much as me, but it's all good.
We're here now in Bohol, guys, and the weather's dry. That's nice.
And with this premium package, I'm supposed to get priority baggage,
which means my suitcase should be one of the first ones out so,
let's see if that actually happens.
What the heck is this?
African Swine Fever. I've never heard of that before.
Is this gonna be the new pandemic or what?
Oh, they're saying you can catch it from Chorizo or siomai.
Maybe they're saying you shouldn't be taking them on the flights or whatever
because you could be spreading this new,
the new 'Rona, the new version of the 'Rona, guys.
African Swine, what is it?
African Swine Fever, ASF.
And the first bag is out and it's not mine, guys.
And the second and third and fourth is not mine.
Ah here we go, number 21.
So I don't know if that was really priority or not, 21.
I guess it is. Look how many people are here, guys.
It probably was priority. It's all good.
Okay, now I gotta find transport to my hotel.
It's only three kilometres away, so should be quick and cheap.
Although I can't use grab here so I don't know if I'm gonna
have to bargain or what.
Or if there's like set prices or if there's metered taxis. I don't know.
I just know that Grab, you can only really use it at places like Cebu, Manila, like the big places.
These places, it doesn't work.
Maybe I should ask the girls here at the Welcome to Bohol desk.
Hi.
- Hello
Where to get a taxi here?
There's a taxi.
There's meter taxis or it's the...
Only car and rental cars.
We don't have a meter taxi.
Don't have a meter taxi?
- Only private car.
Ah okay. I have to bargain with them or they have set prices?
They have fixed prices.
They have fixed prices? Ah okay, thank you.
Cheers.
- Okay
Okay.
Apparently there's fixed prices. We'll see, guys. We'll see.
Oh that is, that guy is that guy is actually holding a sign for my hotel.
I wonder if he can take me there. Henann.
Yeah, I'm going to Henann.
How many people?
- Just one.
Okay, the car also is not free. 200 peso, one person.
It's 200 pesos one person?
Yeah but if you are alone sir, you pay 400 peso.
I pay 400, really? Ah, I thought this was like a...
You're working for the hotel or no?
Yes sir, all the guests from the hotel is not free.
It's not free? Ah.
You have to pay for the transportation.
Ah, okay.
Also, book in advance, also.
So it's 400. How much is it if I take one of these?
The same price, sir.
Ah, okay. I will check with them first and then come back. Okay.
So my hotel actually has like a shuttle service but
you have to pay for it. 400 seems a lot for 3 kilometres.
Hi.
You need a car sir?
How much to Henann?
600 sir.
- 600? Ah.
He's gonna take me for 400.
400?
- Yeah.
It's okay, I will go with him. Yeah, he says it's...
Where you going sir?
Henann.
- Henann, okay.
Going to Henann is, are you alone?
- Yeah.
Yeah 600.
- 600. Ah, okay.
This guy, he's gonna take me for 400 so I will go with him.
How about 500?
He's gonna take me for 400. Why would I do 500?
400, let's go 400.
- No, no, I'll take the guy who's there.
He offered me first.
- 400
Ah, he offered me first, 400.
Okay.
He's trying to say, "Okay he's taking you for 400, I'll take you for 500."
Yeah, same price, yeah, so.
Okay, so you...
- I can go with you?
Yeah.
- Okay sir
You're the driver or no?
- No, sir.
You're just for the airport?
- Yes, sir.
Ah, okay.
You can pay, is it okay to pay directly to the driver?
Oh, pay directly to the driver? Yeah, no problem.
Yeah, okay. Jonas.
I will call the driver for you.
Oh, he will come? Ah, okay.
It's close, right? It's only a few kilometres away?
- Yes sir.
Like 10 minutes, 5 minutes, like that?
- Yes sir.
Okay, good.
Thankfully guys, I've booked a bike.
Hey, oh, he's here?
- Yeah.
Okay, thankfully I've booked a motorbike for this trip
but I won't be picking it up until tomorrow
but that should solve the transport problem for this island,
for getting around, because it seems like taxis are gonna be pretty expensive.
And this guy recognised me, right? He's seen my Beef Wellington video.
Good one. Nice one.
That was a nice review, also.
- Okay, good.
Okay.
So, yeah, looks like we're getting a mini bus, basically.
A little van taking us, just for yer man.
A van for yer man.
Yeah, it is. It's a wee mini bus right here.
What?
Hi, how are you? You my driver?
- Yes.
Okay, only me. Only one. This big,
this big vehicle for only yer man.
- Yep.
- Yes.
Okay, to Henann.
Oh, what was that?
- Thunder.
Thunder?
Oh, I came for a beach holiday. Why's there thunder?
I came for a beach vacation. The first thing I hear is "Bop-bom!"
Thunderstorm. I brought the Scottish weather with me,
to Bohol.
Here we are already.
That was a short ride.
Like four minutes, five minutes.
This looks like a big hotel.
- Yep.
It's like a whole resort. Convention centre, multiple buildings, etc.
Hi, how are you?
Terrence.
- Good, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Leto. See you next time, my friend. Cheers.
Okay.
Okay.
Hi.
Sir, you can have your check-in there and
I will keep your luggage here, sir.
- Okay, thank you.
Yes, sir.
- How are you?
Can I have your booking voucher, sir?
Ah, I don't have any such voucher.
Have you an e-mail, sir?
I booked on your website.
What about in your emails, sir?
- Okay, I will check.
I have an email with a reservation number.
Is that good?
- Yeah, can I check?
- Yeah
- Yes, this one, sir.
Excuse me sir, your luggage number, sir.
Okay, thank you.
- No problem, sir.
Bag is waiting there? Okay.
Its good?
- Philip Dale?
Yeah, Dale Philip.
So you won some awards?
Luxury awards.
So they won World Luxury Hotel Awards in 2016 and 2017.
Nothing recently though. Where's the 2023 one?
- Not yet, sir.
- Not yet? Coming, coming?
- Yes
- Okay
For your breakfast, sir, you can have that here at Doral Cafe at the second floor.
Its included in my rate or no?
- Yes, it's included.
It's included?
- It's free sir.
It's 6 to 10 a.m.
- Okay
We also have breakfast here at Sea Breezer.
Yeah.
From 7 to 10 a.m. You can choose.
I can choose which one? Ah, which one is best?
Which one is the best one?
- This one is better, sir,
because it's near the beach, but it opens 7.
This one is just upstairs and it opens 6.
Ah, okay. I will try this one, I think.
If I wake up before 10 o'clock.
- Yes.
Not always I can do that.
And we also have dinner buffet every night at Sea Breezer.
Okay.
- From 5.30 until 9 p.m.
Okay.
- Reservation is until 5 p.m. only here at front desk.
Okay.
Standard check-out time is 11 a.m. If you have any concerns, dial number 6 or 7, front desk number.
- Okay.
- Reminder sir all rooms no smoking, including balcony,
no fake tattoo or henna tattoo that might stay in our linens,
and no bringing outside foods that might cause foul smell in your room.
Okay
I also have to discuss something here sir.
- Okay
and here sir, this is Christina's restaurant.
There is a complimentary access to all suite rooms, VIP rooms here.
Oh, so it's like an executive lounge?
- Yes sir.
- Henann lounge, it's called Henann lounge.
- Henann lounge, ah okay.
You can go there sir from 10:30 a.m. until 7 p.m.
Ah. And there's always drinks and snacks there?
Yes sir, free, drinks and snacks.
Ah, okay. Good, I like that.
- And this yours.
- That's good.
Inside, sir, is the opening and closing of our facility.
- Of everything? Ah, okay.
And I will give you one towel card. You can exchange this one, sir, with beach towel at the pool area.
- Okay, yeah.
- Please return upon check-out to avoid charges.
- Okay no problem.
- Here is your room key sir for your WiFi user name and password,
your room number and your last name.
- Okay, thank you so much, thank you.
Cheers, thank you.
- Enjoy your stay. Thank you.
Okay, that's good. I get executive lounge access.
I didn't know I was getting that, so I booked a suite,
rather than a standard room, guys.
I booked a suite here and apparently it includes the lounge access.
They were offering to take me to my room,
but you know I like to do the room tour and stuff myself, so.
Thank you. I'll give you my card.
Yes, I can have your room number, sir.
- It's 5040.
5040?
Thank you. Thank you, Terrance.
Thank you so much. Cheers. Cheers, bro.
Enjoy.
- Okay
Yeah, I kinda insisted on taking my bag myself,
because I don't like the guy to give me the room tour.
I like to do the room tour with you guys, don't I?
So let's head to...
Well, my room is 5040. It can't be the 50th floor. It's probably the 5th floor,
actually. Let's see where the lifts are.
No problem.
No problem at all.
- Perfect timing.
- Yeah.
I think I'm on 5.
You've been here a while already, yeah?
- Yeah
What's it like?
Oh, it's always hot. It's hot.
It's hot, yeah. I'm sweating already.
I just...
Yeah.
- Yeah.
I'm just here.
But it's usually sunny, just...
Ah, okay.
Okay, see you.
- Bye, have a great time.
Yeah, guys, it's hotter than Manila here. It's so humid.
It literally feels like you're in a... in a sauna.
But hey, it's like a beach resort,
so it's like, it's not so bad as it is when you're in the city
and you're feeling like that.
Okay.
5040.
Let's check out our suite here at the Henann Alona Beach in
Bohol. That's where I am.
Okay, so we've got a king-size bed.
Fantastic. Oh, they've given...
They've given yer man some wee sweet treats.
I like that.
A little...
A little welcome there, some sweet treats.
Okay, I could do with that actually.
I'm feeling...
I'm feeling like a sweet treat. That meal that I had on the plane,
didn't have any dessert.
It was just the beef tapsilog on its own with a bottle of water.
Now, guys, I am paying 250 bucks a night for this room.
What do you think? Is this a $250 a night hotel room,
Or not?
I would say it's more like a...
I dunno, it depends where you are. If I was in Manila,
I would be paying, like, well,
that hotel at the Somerset, I was paying $130.
Like, half the price.
So, basically, it's like,
because you're in Bohol, because you're in
a fancy beach resort, you pay basically
twice as much for the same kind of standard, but
this is a high standard,
by the looks of it. I'm impressed straight away.
I've got a balcony,
Which I love. Guys, I love when I have a balcony.
It's just nice to just chill
in the fresh air and check it out, guys.
Check it out. This is part of the resort here.
I can't see the beach.
The beach will be down that way.
But I think it has a private beach.
Look at the...
There's multiple swimming pools here, guys.
There's that one there.
There's a long one there.
They might all be connected, in fact.
Look at this. This is gonna be nice.
I'm looking forward to this.
And some of the rooms actually open right onto the pool.
That would have been nice, guys.
Although, I've had that before in Thailand.
I was in Ko Tao and I had that.
And kids were swimming right up to my door.
It was annoying. I was getting the noise from it.
So maybe, you know, it's a good thing and a bad thing.
The good thing is you just step right out and back in to your room, you know?
You don't have to get all dried off before you get up the lift
just to take a shower again and get wet again.
And down below, we've got a koi pond.
There's all these koi fish that I can see. Big ones.
Big massive koi fish down there.
But this is the resort.
I'll take a walk down to the beach after we've done the,
after we've done the room tour.
That's nice. A wee place to hang your clothes.
Good.
So far I'm impressed. Big, nice flat panel TV.
50 inch.
50 inch TV.
Everything in good condition.
I always check that. I like to see how worn out things are.
And this looks to be in perfect condition, guys.
Okay, should I continue the room tour
or should I just start munching these...
should I just start munching these wee treats?
I think I'll just start munching these wee treats.
Guys, what have we got?
Chocolate brownie.
What does it say?
Welcome to Henann Resort.
And a letter addressed to yer man, right here.
What does that say?
Basically, it's just what they gave me downstairs.
It's all the times and stuff. It's not like any kind of personalised thing.
It's just all the opening and closing times.
But that's nice, the chocolate brownie.
Some other wee cakes.
Some kind of like red velvet cake.
Mmm. Good.
That's a nice wee pick-me-up.
A nice wee pick-me-up, guys.
So, we've got some magazine.
Oh, another TV. What's the point in that?
I guess you've got one TV for when you're at the sofa.
And another TV for when you're lying in bed.
Hmm. I guess that is handy.
We've got the...
a big open bathroom there.
That's good. You've got a separate
shower and bathtub.
I always appreciate that.
Separate shower area there.
Nice and big. And then,
yeah, it's a nice long bath.
That's good. It is a bit stained by the looks of it.
That looks like, I don't know, it's all pink there.
Why is it pink?
Very strange. Is that actually liquid?
No, that's stained. A bit of staining there.
But otherwise, very nice. Very nice bathroom area.
Isn't it, guys?
Aye, I like it.
I like this room.
So, yeah.
How about the resort though? Do I like the resort?
Well, we're gonna have to go and explore a bit, aren't we?
Let's check out things like the gym,
the beach, etc. guys. Let's go for a wee wander around and a swim.
Let's go for a swim, for sure.
Well, just as I was about to go out and explore this resort,
I went for a dump and I came back out and it was pouring with rain guys.
It was pouring with rain and it's now 20 minutes later, it's finally stopped.
You can see how wet the ground is, there.
Everybody cleared out from the swimming pool but people are coming back now.
I think it's gonna be that way.
Guys, if you look at the sky, there's these
clear patches, there's these dark patches.
I think it's gonna be sunny and it's gonna pour down with rain
and it's gonna be sunny again.
Like that. I think that's gonna be the way it is here, but
in the 20 minutes or so that I've been chillin' in my room,
it's given me a chance to setup my laptop and do our speed test, guys.
Check this out. 88 megabits download speed, 82 megabits upload speed.
I was not expecting that at all in an island resort.
I'm super, super impressed by that
because in Manila I was getting 5 megabits, 10 megabits.
So I thought it would be even worse.
I was thinking if you're getting that bad
of internet speeds in 5 star hotels in Manila,
what's it gonna be like in an island resort?
Like 2 megabits? No.
88 megabits. That is incredible, guys.
What's not incredible though is this desk-chair set up here.
Look, this desk is too small to get your legs fully under.
You can see here, I've got my legs half under, guys, and they're pressed up.
My foot is on the ground and
you know what I'm... My leg is actually pressed like that.
It's gonna cut off the circulation to my legs if I wanna like get myself...
I can't even get myself fully under the desk so
that is a huge design flaw and
just ridiculous how many hotels get this wrong.
You can't match the chair to the desk.
I mean, come on, make the chair a bit smaller
or make the desk a bit higher.
You've got to fit your legs under the desk for goodness sake.
And I hate these desks that are opposite the mirror as well.
Like you're sitting working at your laptop and you have to look at yourself.
Every time you move your head there's this like
distraction in front of you so
normally what I'll do is I'll get the
cushions or something
and I'll stack them up or I'll see if I can take a painting off the wall
and stick that there because it's just too annoying, isn't it?
Look, you're sitting working and you're just seeing something moving,
in front of you. But yeah, the biggest problem is this.
I mean, I've had worse...
I've had like desks where you can't even get your legs under a wee bit.
I can get half my leg there.
So I can actually sit and work like this.
That's not a problem.
It's just not fully comfortable. Like it should be.
But this, if you look, it's not attached to the...
It's not attached to the wall.
So I could potentially lift this desk up a wee bit by
getting folded pieces of paper and putting it under each of these legs.
So yeah, I think there's just enough room to just lift it up a wee bit.
So that's probably what I'm gonna do.
Probably these pieces of paper they've given me with the times and stuff.
Probably just gonna fold them up into squares and...
Yeah.
Is there multiple sheets?
Yeah, there's multiple sheets.
Yeah, I'll just do that. There's like notepads there.
I'll be able to do it guys. I'll be able to make that comfortable, you know?
Lift the desk up a wee bit, cover the mirror, that'll be fine.
And check this out guys.
Lying on the floor is the hotel's minibar.
Why is it lying on the floor?
Why do you think the hotel's minibar is lying on the floor?
Well, if you've watched my videos before,
I think you will know that the hotel's own minibar has been replaced by
yer man's own minibar. Yer man's.
That looks much better, doesn't it?
The Coke Zero Vanilla.
The chocolate bars. Oh, this is good.
This hazelnut. Oh, this is the almond one.
There's a hazelnut one there.
Yum, yum, yum.
Got the matcha latte, almonds as well.
You've got all sorts of nuts, protein bars, sugar-free
Gatorade, more protein bars.
Yes, that's what you want.
That's a proper minibar.
And it doesn't cost...
I don't even know how much that would cost.
Is there a price list,
anywhere?
No, there's not even a price list.
Maybe I get that for free.
Maybe I get that for free because there's no...
Yeah, there's no price list.
Surely if there's no price list, it's for free.
Right? I dunno, but maybe it's because I'm in a suite.
Oh yeah, I've got access to the executive lounge
where snacks and drinks are free anyway,
so surely they would just give you that for free.
But I don't want any of that.
I don't want sugary Coca-Cola. I don't want beer.
I don't want this
minute-made orange juice, or this sparkling water.
Sparkling water is horrible.
I just want what I've brought myself, so they can keep that.
Guys, they can keep that.
Anyway, this is gonna be nice and comfortable, guys.
This room is gonna be nice and comfortable
after I, you know, just fix up that.
Do a bit of furniture alterations.
After I do my furniture alterations.
Maybe I should start travelling with something like beer mats or something.
I should start travelling with beer mats like a stack of them
that I can put under the legs of desks
when they give me that stupid design flaw.
What nutcase,
what psychopath designed that desk and chair, guys?
I want it to know. I want to find the guy
and give him a piece of my mind.
Anyway, let's go out and explore the resort.
Maybe go to the executive lounge and get some free snacks and drinks.
So let's have a look around.
This is the lobby where I came and checked in.
There's a wee cafe there with the Ensaymadas, these little buns with cheese
that I've had before.
And then some western style creme brulee, but with ube.
An ube creme brulee cake.
Oh, that looks nice.
290 per slice. Okay.
Some sweet treats right there. Good.
Let's...
I think we can head out this way.
I think.
Yes, this is where I'm looking down onto from my room, guys.
The pool. Is it one big pool?
I think it might go all the way around.
I'm gonna see.
But these rooms are nice, aren't they?
The ones where you can just step out.
I dunno, guys, would you like it?
Would you prefer that or not? Let me know what you think
if you would prefer to be there,
with the kids just splashing around right
in front of you, making noise.
Or would you prefer to be...
Well, mine's is one of the top ones.
I think that's one of my ones there.
Right there. Would you prefer to be there
or would you prefer to be
right there. There's pros and cons of each.
Now let's see if this whole pool is connected.
Because if it is, I'm gonna just do like a lap of it
when I get in. Yeah, it goes all the way around.
All the way around to... Oh no, it stops.
It stops in the middle because there's a bridge.
They could have just built that bridge over the water
so you could swim under it.
But you haven't. You have to get out and then go around.
Like that.
Oh, and there's some villas there.
It says "Exclusive for villa guests." Hello. How are you?
So this is a villa area?
- Yes, sir.
Okay. I can't go. I only have a normal room. I don't have a villa.
How many villas are there?
12, sir.
12 villas? Ah, okay.
So, are they connected or
each villa is independent?
Yes.
- Ah, okay.
So yeah, villa 10. So that whole thing is one villa?
Yes, sir.
Ah, okay. So they're a standalone detached villas.
Like that.
Do the villas have private pools or anything?
- I saw your...
You saw me, yeah?
- Yes, sir.
Okay.
????
I see you, sir.
Oh really? Ah, good.
What's your name? Jerick.
Nice to see you. Yeah.
- Yes, sir.
Any of the villas I could do a tour or no?
Any ones are free? They're full?
Only the villa guests can enter.
- Only the villa guests can come in? Ah, okay.
Peasants, peasants like me have to stay in this area.
No problem.
But you're looking... You're security?
Ah, security. You're looking after. Ah, where are you from?
Ah, this, ah, I'm...
In...
You're from Bohol or?
- Yes
Ah, okay. You're actually a Bohol man?
- Yes, sir.
Ah, okay, good.
I'm going to explore your island tomorrow.
Today I'm just relaxing.
Tomorrow I'm getting the motorbike and I will go around.
Yes, sir.
Yeah, good.
I saw your vlogs, when you're in Sri Lanka.
In Sri Lanka?
Yes, sir.
Ah, okay, good. That's what you seen.
You seen the Sri Lanka vlog.
- Really amazing sir.
Okay, nice one.
- Thank you for coming here sir.
Nice to see you. Ah, okay.
That's good.
Got a fan of yer man but I still don't get any special privileges
to go and explore the villas.
Yeah, I think they've got private pools and stuff
but they're probably pretty expensive.
Considering it's just like
that ordinary hotel room that's supposed to be
a suite that I've got.
It's 250 bucks a night. Imagine how much a whole villa is.
But,
yeah, you don't get much value staying in
a villa when you're on your own.
If you're with a family you get the value
because you would probably have to pay for two hotel rooms anyway.
So you might as well, you know, if it's double,
if it's 500 bucks a night or whatever, even like 6, 7,
pay for the villa, have your privacy, etc.
Right, I don't know exactly where I'm going.
Just kind of wandering around here, guys.
Again, I think you can't swim under this. You have to actually get out.
Yeah, but this one's got a swim up bar.
You can swim up and sit on the chairs there.
Aye, very nice.
Okay, let's continue exploring.
How are you? Good?
I'm just exploring.
I think I will look at the beach, Alona Beach.
It's close by, yeah?
- Yes sir.
How are you?
Can we take a photo?
- Jarik again.
Sir can we take a photo?
Ah, okay, no problem.
This is it?
Good? Okay, nice one, nice one guys.
I'll go check out the beach.
Alona Beach, right here.
It's this way, yeah?
Yes sir.
- Okay.
There's also a spa and a beach club.
Dunno if beach club is like nightclub,
like a party, beach party type area.
That's probably what it is.
Beach club.
So I think this is a private beach.
I think this just belongs to the hotel.
And another pool right here.
So this is probably the beach club.
It's probably like a pool party type area, but just now it's quiet.
I would actually come here and swim
rather than the one that's closer to me
because you'd get this all to yourself guys.
Pretty much. You'd pretty much get this to yourself.
Yeah.
It's nice.
Nice and quiet.
And another pool down there as well.
How many pools are there?
Christina's pool.
Hi, how are you?
Just looking around.
Yeah, there's another pool right beside the beach,
down here. Wow.
This is, if you like swimming pools guys,
this is a good resort to come to, if you like swimming pools.
Yeah, this is actually, yeah,
it's one big pool that's connected, but again it's with a bridge.
Like if they want some design advice from yer man,
I would say just make these bridges so that you can like
swim under them, so that you walk over the water
and people can swim under.
That would be a much cooler design.
I don't know why they didn't think of that.
Why is it just yer man who thinks of these ingenious design ideas?
And this is the beach here.
We've got a security guard looking after it.
We've got some showers right next to the beach to wash your
feet off before going back to your room.
We've got a big group of people who don't look like they're dressed for the beach,
right here.
And...
Yeah, oh, we've got guys doing tours like island hopping and such.
You're doing tours, yes?
Ah, okay. So, for 4,000 pesos, you can do a private tour.
You get your own boat and you go around different islands,
can do dolphin watching and such like that. Okay, good.
Nice to see you, bro.
Okay, so, yeah.
Trying to figure out if this is an actual private beach for the hotel or not.
Christina's, so that's the, that pool there,
but that says it's henann dot com,
so that actually belongs to the Henann Resort.
But check this beach out guys.
Check out the water, nice and clear.
People actually enjoying swimming and snorkeling.
Unlike the beach I went to in Manila where...
Well, it was just me basically.
It was just me that was just dipping my toes in.
The water's just obviously, near Manila,
it's just obviously not clean enough to be swimming in, but here.
It's clean, isn't it? You can see.
It's crystal clear guys.
I think what I might do is...
I might come out and go for a swim in the sea.
And a swim in the pool. I was gonna take a swim in the pool.
I think I might actually do my swim right here.
I mean, why not?
It's probably better actually to do it in the sea.
Good. I just checked out the beach. It's very nice.
I think I'm gonna go for a swim.
Yes, sir.
- Yeah, I'll change and then go for a swim.
At that beach over there.
Yes.
Hello.
Okay guys, I have changed into my shorts and flip-flops.
Guys, these flip-flops are the only flip-flops I've ever owned,
that don't hurt my feet.
You see here, this part, it's all nice and soft.
Usually this part kind of like digs into my feet
or the thong ones, that Australians called thongs,
that have the little bit that goes between your toes.
That also will blister me.
But I found these ones a couple of years ago
and they're perfect, so I keep using them.
These, I think it's, oh it's Under Armour. Yeah, Under Armour
flip-flops.
Now let's make our way to the beach.
Take me to the beach.
Ah, and these rooms here have like a terrace area.
I don't know if there's different prices for the different types of rooms.
Like the ones coming out onto the pool and stuff.
There's my man Jerick again.
How are you?
But when I booked my room, that was the
only one available, the suite actually.
It was sold out because today it is a Saturday,
guys. So, I think that's the way it is with Bohol.
All the hotels seem to be almost fully booked for today and tomorrow
and then they were all free later in the week,
like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
And I think it's that way with Bohol.
Like, a lot of people come from Cebu.
They just take a ferry over, like a couple of hour ferry and they're here.
So you'll get, you know, people just coming for weekend vacations,
quick weekend vacations like that, who live on the Big Island nearby.
And yeah, I did say my room was 250 bucks a night.
That's average over the five nights that I've booked it for.
I think it was maybe like 350 bucks a night
for like Saturday, Sunday
and maybe like 100 and something the rest of the days,
and it it averaged out though for five nights, like $1,250 guys.
And you think, when you spend that much,
they would just give you a free transfer from the airport
considering it's three kilometres away.
It's only like four minutes drive, five minutes drive.
Why can't this hotel, this massive resort,
have like their own private shuttle bus
to take guests to and from the airport?
It just feels a bit, you know,
like you're getting nickel and dimed, you know?
It just feels a bit cheap that you have to pay one of those.
Basically it was like a private transfer, like 400,
just to come down the road,
when you're already paying like $1,250 bucks.
But I think I can, I need a towel guys.
I can take the towel to the beach?
It's okay? Okay, that's what I want to do.
So you keep this as a deposit, right?
And I take this? Okay, thank you bro, thank you.
Okay, that's good.
I can take my towel down to the beach and just grab one of these chairs.
Okay, I'll take this one here.
And they've got this rope.
I think that separates the beach from the resort.
So maybe it's not actually like a private beach or not.
I still haven't figured that out, whether this beach bit actually belongs to the resort or not.
Okay, gonna go and go for a wee dip.
Okay, maybe tomorrow, not today.
I'm just gonna chill around here.
I need to advance the booking.
Need to advance the booking.
I think about it later. Thank you.
Okay, over there they're doing kayaking and stuff.
I wouldn't mind doing that actually.
Can't be bothered doing a full, booking a full day tour with a guy.
I don't know if I even want to commit to, you know,
spending like 8 hours, 9 hours going from island to island.
It's nice enough here.
Why do you need to go to different islands
just to do the same thing?
Just to swim in the sea and be in the sand and stuff
when you have it right here, in your own resort, guys.
Yes, look how clear this water is.
Crystal clear. It couldn't be any clearer.
Guys, it couldn't be any clearer. So, yeah.
A lovely area. No pollution at all.
Quite quiet.
It's not like some of the, I guess, more popular islands.
Some of the islands in Thailand I remember going to,
there were so many boats revving their engine,
mucking up the water and stuff.
There's none of that here.
There's just a few boats there.
They're all over that bit there, yeah.
Yeah, not too, not too crowded either.
This is nice.
I'm gonna go investigate the kayaking
because I wouldn't mind actually doing that, the kayaking.
I don't see any kayaks. I see canoes.
That's a canoe, right? Not a kayak.
And then I see these paddle boards.
Is that what they're called? Paddle boards.
But, yeah, what these guys are doing looks more like a kayak.
Hi. Oh, I'm just looking, just looking.
Yeah, these canoes or kayaks?
Yes, they are crystal kayaks, sir.
These are kayaks? They look like canoes.
These are like a canoe but it's new.
Oh, it's a new style? Ah, okay.
How much does it cost to take them out?
500 one hour if you want.
- 500 one hour? Ah, okay.
And the half hour is 250.
Oh, you can take for just half hour? Ah.
Yeah, sure.
- But if you're late, you will charge me for one hour?
No, no.
It depends on you.
Oh, it depends on me if it's 35 minutes or what.
And it's just this area here.
I think there's like a rope.
Yeah, there's a net.
There's a net.
Ah, okay, all the way around.
Yeah, I see it.
Only this area. Don't go out.
Only this area. Ah, okay.
You have a net to...
You know it's what your boundary.
Until what time? Until it gets dark?
It's up to you if you want to start today,
now, we can start...
Ah, not now.
I will come back later.
I'm gonna get my GoPro chest mount and everything.
So that I can do.
- Is that a GoPro?
Yeah, I will get the chest mount and then I can paddle.
You make blog?
You know, yeah. Blog, yes.
Hi, guys. Shout out, guys.
Shout out to who?
Welcome to my channel.
- Shout out to who?
Shout out, Jerick.
Your guide for today.
You're Jerick?
- Yeah, Jerick.
Okay, I just met another Jerick in the hotel.
Pig, pig, Jerick, pig.
Jerick Pig?
Pig. The legit Jerick.
You're the legit one?
Oh, that one, that Jerick's the pig.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Oh my God.
Bro, he's gonna see this and be angry.
He will come looking for you.
No, don't think about that.
Okay.
But you know this Jerick, yeah?
Yeah, yeah. My friend also.
Oh, your friend? Ah, okay.
That's why you're joking.
All people here is a family business.
Ah, okay. Ah, okay, like that.
And there's massage ladies as well.
Yeah, also my auntie, my...
Ah, okay.
My neighbourhood.
They working for Henann or they're independent?
Yeah, yeah. This is my own job.
Ah, okay.
I'm not connect in the Henann.
So after this rope, this is like public beach?
Yeah, this one is public beach.
Public beach? Ah, I was wondering that.
I was wondering if they own the beach or not.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No one can control it.
- No, it's public beach.
Yeah.
- But after the rope,
it's private, the resort.
Ah, I get it, like this.
So if you want to drink or swimming some,
no one can care.
Anyone can come and do this?
But how would they get here?
They'd have to come from
what, down there or something?
I don't think there's access for the public.
That area is a private place.
So only here, the private, and then...
Yeah, but how will the public get here?
From around there?
Yeah, from here and that cliff.
Ah, or if they come by boat,
they can drop off or maybe something like that.
It's up to you, if want to try a boat or walking from here.
So these aunties, they have their massage business?
Yeah, yeah.
Are they all independent or there is like one big boss?
Yeah, yeah. It's dependent on the guest.
This resort is many guest,
Yeah?
fully booked.
They have possibility, always customer, get massage.
Oh, they come here?
- Yes
Because there is a spa in the resort, but expensive.
So more cheap to get from the aunties here.
Ah, okay.
How much do they charge for the body massage?
They have a menu so you can...
Ah, okay, yeah. I will talk to them.
Yeah, maybe I will do that.
So it's a good thing.
This is good for you because you make a blog.
Yeah, I know. I need to get the chest mount first though.
Otherwise it's difficult because you need two hands to paddle, right?
Yeah, yeah. But it's okay. You can, if you want alone,
I give you one, one,
you have paddle.
Yeah, one paddle. Yeah, but I need two hands for one paddle.
That's the thing.
You know? I can't do it with one hand.
Oh, that? The paddle boat.
Yeah, yeah, single paddle.
The paddle board.
Yes.
What do you call these? Paddle board?
Standing board.
Standing board?
- Yeah.
If you have the balance?
Nah, I don't have balance.
I can barely snowboard or anything like that,
so it ain't gonna be,
that ain't gonna be for me.
It's gonna be this.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I've done kayaking before but never like this.
It's kinda like a...
It's only from Philippine.
Oh, only Philippines? Ah, unique?
Only Philippines, yes.
Unique? Ah, okay.
This is a...
The first by this one is from in Boracay.
Ah, so it was invented in Boracay?
Yeah, in the Boracay.
Ah, okay.
This is very legit in the Bora.
Ah, okay.
Can research in the YouTube.
Yeah.
It's very...
It's a new...
legit item so...
I have a brother who works in the other country
so he buy this unit.
Ah, okay.
I make my own business.
You make your business from this?
Okay, so all this belongs to you?
Yes.
All this is yours?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. My support is my brother.
Ah, okay.
He always give me financial, give money, so...
Everyone is...
Family is strong in Philippines, right?
Family help each other,
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- a lot in the Philippines?
It's a make brotherhood.
Ah, okay.
So the relationship of the
Filipino, it's very hard.
Yeah.
Okay, I will go get my chest mount and some money for you.
250, right? For half an hour?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay, I will bring 250.
Okay, sounds good.
- Okay
I'll do that guys. I will go for a
kayak. A canoe kayak.
Can't remember what he called them.
A special type of Filipino kayak
that is unique to the Philippines.
I was gonna go for a swim but...
Yeah, that sounds like a better idea,
just now. I'll go for a wee paddle,
just now, as I walk back, down here.
Oh, the water is lovely.
It's just a lovely,
a lovely temperature, guys.
Nice.
Clear.
The sand I'm stepping on is really like finely...
finely...
It's very fine.
It's very fine. It doesn't feel sharp on your feet, you know?
Like some beaches, you're getting like all those sharp bits
on the soles of your feet.
No, this is...
This is great. Okay.
Yeah, I'll go get the...
I'll go get the chest mount then.
Hi again.
I'm much better prepared now, guys.
I've got the baseball cap on, to protect me from the sun if I'm gonna be
out there for half an hour.
I've got the chest mount so I can attach this
to that and to have my hands free.
I've got some Gatorade, some sun cream.
Well prepared for a wee kayaking session.
In fact, I'm not prepared.
I'm heading back.
I've forgotten one thing.
Out of all those things that I listed.
there's one thing missing, guys.
There's one thing missing. Try to think...
Try to think what yer man might have forgot.
Dale Philip.
Ah yes, I'm Dale Philip. How are you?
Somebody just called my name.
How are you, bro?
You good?
You working here?
Yeah.
Ah, okay. I'm just
gonna go for kayaking now.
Okay, nice to see you.
I'm a subscriber.
You're a subscriber? Okay, good.
Nice one.
Okay.
That's nice. I just randomly heard my name from over
the hedge but can you think
what I might have forgotten?
Guys,
What could I possibly
need for kayaking apart from
hat, is it glasses?
I could do with some sunglasses.
I have some but not essential.
I've got the hydration in there, the Gatorade bottle.
I've got the sun cream.
I'm not gonna get burnt.
I've got the chest mount for the GoPro.
But I don't have,
I don't have any money, guys.
I don't have any money to pay the bloke for it.
I forgot to bring my wallet or just some...
I was gonna bring the exact amount of cash
so that I don't have to kayak with my wallet
or leave my wallet unattended.
So, yeah, 250 pesos.
That's what I don't have, that I need to have, before I go kayaking.
Okay, 250 pesos.
And we are now going fully
Point of View style, guys.
This camera is going right here.
Ah, this is good, guys.
This blue, blue flavour.
The best flavour, guys.
Blue, the artificial
blue flavour. I love it.
Hi.
You want now?
- What's that?
Yeah, the kayak.
Yeah, I'm gonna go with Jerick.
Okay, me, Jerick.
You're Jerick? You're not Jerick.
- Yes, I am.
Jerick, blog, yesterday.
Show me, show me. You're not Jerick.
Oh, you're Jerick, okay.
How do you expect me to recognise you when you're hiding like that?
You could be anybody.
I take my mask.
You could be Leonardo DiCaprio, I don't know.
You could be anybody.
I take up my jacket.
Ah, okay.
Yeah, I went and got money for you.
You know, I came, I got my chest mount.
And then I came and then I forgot,
I have to bring money for Jerick.
Take the money now, otherwise it will get wet.
- Yeah yeah.
Okay, so I'm doing half an hour.
You have to kayak, right?
Oh, man, I forgot this.
Okay, hold this for me. That's deposit.
You have a deposit now, it's my room key.
Okay, now all I'm carrying is this, the Gatorade.
Yeah.
Kayak?
Yeah. Okay, good.
Massage.
Yeah, later I will come.
Oh, is this your menu, here?
No, that's for doing braids.
Oh, this is the massage here.
Swedish massage, 800 for one hour?
Yeah.
Ah, okay, that's okay.
One hour.
Okay.
You working until it gets dark?
All day?
Okay, maybe later I will come and get the Swedish massage
or one of these Filipino traditional massage.
That's without oil, right?
Filipino traditional, like Thai massage.
Yeah. Okay.
Only shatsu, no oil.
What is shatsu?
Oh, no... Only shatsu is no oil?
Yes.
Ah, okay.
Okay, maybe later, okay? Okay, aunty.
So Jerick is taking my kayak into the sea.
Filipino unique kayak.
What is the name? Filipino kayak?
Filipino kayak.
Canoe.
- Filipino canoe?
Another words, canoe.
Okay.
I just throw this in here.
It can go anywhere, right?
It can roll around and then...
Yeah, you drink energy?
Yeah.
Okay.
Gatorade.
Wait for it.
So you gonna give me a push?
Yeah, I push you.
Okay, Jerick's giving me a push.
Yeah.
Here we go.
And I can go anywhere around the net?
Okay.
Freedom, guys, freedom.
Let's go for a wee paddle around
this beautiful, crystal clear water,
beach area. Alona Beach.
Here in Bohol.
Okay, I'm getting it right now, guys.
This bit is where you
should be pushing against.
Not that bit.
So you want to be
doing it like this.
So you actually
are pulling the water efficiently.
Right, let's go right to the edge.
Let's do the full,
the full loop of this.
And it looks like they're building some new resort,
right here.
Also on Alona Beach.
So you've got the Henann where I'm staying, right there.
I don't know if there's anything else after that but
it looks like this is also gonna be like one of these
five-star beach resorts,
coming soon, right next to it.
Right, let's see if we can go and investigate
the little rock area right here.
What do you reckon?
Do you reckon I can
get through there, guys?
I'm gonna try and go for it.
It's gonna be difficult because the paddle's gonna be in the way.
I'm gonna try not to scratch up the
kayak. Let's see if I can
slow down a bit, actually.
Because maybe if I scratch this up it'll be like the
jet skis in Thailand where if you bring
it back with a little scratch on it they try and scam you.
And...
Oh, there's a big old crab right there.
Check that out. Can you see it?
Can you see it, guys?
Wow.
That's like an exotic crab, right there.
Wow. I'm gonna see if I can get closer to it.
Yeah, I don't think there's any way for me to get through
here without...
Oh, there's loads of these crabs, guys.
There's loads of them.
I don't think there's any way for me to
get through this without...
I'm gonna use my hands to pull against the rocks.
Ah, that's it. I can do it.
I just gotta watch out that I don't
grab a crab,
and get my hand bitten.
This is really sharp.
I wish I brought my
FiveFinger, my Vibram shoes.
Wow. Check them out.
Check these crabs out, guys.
They're like green.
They've got like yellowy brown legs
and green bodies.
That's cool. I've never seen crabs like that.
Aye, I could actually walk on that if I brought my FiveFinger shoes.
I might do that tomorrow
so I can walk around on these rocks but
yeah, just touching it with my hand I can tell
I wouldn't be able to stand on that, at all.
Guys. Oh, I'm actually out of bounds.
I've just noticed I'm out of bounds.
So this is the rope here.
The net that
is our area that we're supposed to stay in.
So I better get back in, otherwise I'll get in trouble.
There's a boat right there.
Looks like it's bringing back some tourists, so
a popular thing to do is, there's guys selling trips there.
They'll take you on a snorkeling trip.
They'll just take you right out into the ocean.
The boat will go like 15 minutes to a bit
where there's coral or something beautiful,
there's a lot of tropical fish, and then
they'll just let you snorkel off the boat for a couple of hours
and then bring you back.
Some of them will even take you to like another island to eat lunch.
All that.
All that kind of thing.
I don't know guys. I kind of like just
being around the resort area.
You can come and go to your room as you please.
It's really convenient, you know.
That's normally if I'm at a place like this how I'll do it.
Right, so, I've got to one corner.
Let's do the full loop.
As I said, I paid for half an hour.
I've been out for about five minutes.
I've got plenty of time to be able to do this.
We got some traffic right here.
Try not to run them over.
Somebody snorkeling.
They've got the tube.
Hi.
They've got the tube there.
There must be tropical fish under here.
So this is like a clear boat, guys.
You can see down underneath the sea.
It is pretty much clear.
You can see about just as much as you can see
from the actual water itself.
So that's pretty cool.
It's a pretty cool idea.
These boats.
And here are some couples down here, doing the standing boat.
That looks like a lot of effort.
And needing a lot of balance.
That lady looks like she's gonna fall.
The guy over here,
the guy over here looks like he's doing
it much more professionally.
But this lady looked like she's gonna fall.
Go, go, fall, fall, fall.
Ah, darn.
I want her to fall, just because it'll be funny.
Just for my own entertainment, I want her to fall.
You can tell she's kinda like,
she's losing her balance.
Maybe I can make her fall.
Maybe I can just bump into her boat.
Hi, guys.
Doing good?
Oh, sorry.
Oh.
Just about bumped into you.
Hi, how are you?
You look like you've done this before.
You look confident.
- No, I haven't.
You haven't? It's your first time? Oh.
You look more confident than the couple ahead of you.
She looks like she's gonna fallm I think.
Don't you think?
We're in a race though.
You're in a race, to where? To the rocks?
To the rocks? Go, go.
You can't let her beat you.
You can't let her beat you. Go, go.
I'll give you, I'll help you. I'll give you a push.
Give you a boost. Come on.
Go on.
Giving them a boost.
But I'm almost knocking the guy over.
Sorry man.
I'm being more of a hindrance than a help.
Sorry.
I'll leave you alone.
Okay, I've knocked them off in like the opposite direction.
Okay.
Ah, lovely.
The Gatorade.
The first time I came to the Philippines,
I couldn't find any sugar free drinks.
I couldn't even find Coke Zero.
And these days they've got Coke Zero Vanilla flavour
and they've got Gatorade No Sugar,
and Sprite Zero as well, so
progressive, progressive Philippines.
They are getting on board with
the sugar free drink movement
that yer man is always promoting.
He loves a good sugar free drink.
Save the calories for the food, guys.
Save the calories for the food.
A starfish right underneath me.
Right underneath me is a starfish.
I've been trying to get over it to show
you guys for about five minutes.
But it's right there.
Hopefully you can see it.
I can see it.
It's kind of hiding in the dark seaweed.
But it is a big old yellow starfish, right there.
So, I haven't seen any fish.
Well, unless you include the starfish.
But, yeah, I've seen some crabs and
that starfish and that's about it.
I'm kind of looking for more but yeah,
it's just there's all this seaweed on the bottom
and whatever is there is hiding underneath it.
Okay, I'm gonna return the boat now.
I'm not sure how long I've been out for.
Maybe 20 minutes, maybe 25 minutes.
Thankfully I didn't take this for an hour.
I think an hour would be too much.
I feel like if I'm gonna continue being out here,
I'd rather just be swimming around or snorkeling or something.
But, what I actually feel like doing is going to that executive lounge
and getting some snacks guys, some free snacks.
How can you pass up on free snacks?
Hi po.
Where is the Henann Lounge?
Henan Lounge, sir?
- Yeah
It's near the Christina, sir.
- That way?
Oh, it's near Christina?
Inside Christina.
It's inside Christina? Ah, okay, so I will go that way.
Okay, thank you.
Okay, so the lounge is where that beach club is.
Guys, I've got changed, I've had a shower,
feeling refreshed.
Gonna get some snacks from the executive lounge.
I don't know how good it's gonna be.
They can vary. In certain hotels, certain Hiltons,
the executive lounges are amazing.
You can practically get a whole dinner out of all the little bits and pieces
they have vol-au-vents, sandwiches and all that.
And then other lounges, it's just like,
almost nothing.
They have like, some sponge cake and like a cheese sandwich
or something like that and that's the only choice.
So, yeah.
Let's see what is available here.
Hello po.
I'm going to the Henann Lounge.
Henann Lounge?
- I can get in with the flip flops or no?
The Henann Lounge.
I can go in like this? No problem, or?
No problem.
Oh okay, good.
I was checking.
Okay.
Very good.
Because some of these business hotels I've been staying at,
like the Hilton's, they have a dress code for the executive lounge.
Like no shorts and such like. No sportswear or no, you know, flip flops.
Like that, but this is a beach resort so, yeah.
They'll let you in, dress for the beach I guess.
How are you?
I'm looking for Henann Lounge.
Ah, yes, may I know your room number?
- This is the Henann Lounge? 5040.
Yeah, this way, sir.
Okay.
Ah, this is it right here.
Okay.
This is, I couldn't find it.
I was looking everywhere.
Yeah, room 5040.
Oh, wow, you got all sorts of little cakes and stuff.
Look at this.
Oh, those are like what I got for the
welcome cakes in my room, but there's more.
Mocha Cream, Puto Kutsinta.
I don't know what that is.
That's Filipino dessert.
Yeah, I knew it's Filipino because there's cheese on top.
You always put cheese, like in Ensaymada and everything.
You always put cheese on top, right?
Oh, there's like...
Fresh fruit kebabs.
Fruit kebabs.
Mini pork brochette.
Brochette, okay.
Loads of good stuff.
Squid flower with buffalo sauce.
Sisig lumpia.
Oh, wow, I'm gonna try that. I love sisig.
So it's sisig inside a spring roll.
That's usually, we eat during when we drink, some hard drinks.
Ah, okay, it's like that.
That's what it's like.
It's like bar food.
Yeah, so I love sisig, but they've got sisig inside lumpia,
so it's like a sisig spring roll.
- Yeah
That's good.
Okay, condiments right here.
And awesome bruschetta, like little pizzas basically.
And then all dried meat and cookies and everything. Oh, good.
Cold cuts.
Yeah, there's a lot of good stuff.
Okay, thank you very much.
A lot of good stuff here.
Look at that.
Some chocolates.
Okay, I'm gonna start munching.
And is there drinks as well?
Yes, sir, yes.
Oh, it's a menu for drinks?
Okay, yeah, I will sit here.
Yeah.
Oh, in fact, I will sit here. Better lighting.
Okay.
Yeah.
Here's your menu sir.
- Oh, so it's a menu for drinks?
Our alcoholic drink starts at 5 to 7, sir.
Ah, okay, oh, so you only have for two hours,
but I don't drink alcohol, so it's all good.
I can drink any of this at any time.
I will take a pineapple juice please.
Okay, sir. Thank you.
- Okay, thank you.
Okay, I'm gonna get some of those sisig lumpias, for sure.
And I think they come with a dip as well.
Philip Dale?
Dale Philip.
Ah, okay.
The opposite.
Ah, the opposite.
Yeah, Philip's my last name.
Philip is your last name?
Yeah, a lot of people, they just see Philip
and they think, "Oh, that's a first name."
So they think, "I must be Philip."
Ah, so you're Dale?
Yeah, I'm Dale. Dale Philip in the Philippines.
Okay.
So this country actually named after King Philip of Spain, back in the day.
So, yeah, I'm Philip in the Philippines.
I'm gonna take three of these. I know that I'm gonna like them.
Normally I would just take one of each,
in case I don't like it, you know?
But I know I'm gonna like them.
Mini pork brochette.
Hello, sir.
Hi, how are you?
Good sir, thank you.
Good.
Welcome to Henann lounge.
Thank you, so much.
Okay, that's one of everything.
Well, almost one of everything.
There's a mocha cream cake there, guys.
I don't like coffee, so I'm skipping that one.
But, yeah, like I said guys, these executive lounges.
And your pineapple juice.
- Oh fantastic. Thank you, so much.
So the lounge open til 7 o'clock every day, right?
- Yeah
7 o'clock, okay.
So.
Oh, no, that close 7 o'clock
and then open by 10.:30 in the morning.
10:30 in the morning?
- Yes
10.30 till 7?
Yes, sir.
Every day?
Yeah, every day.
- Oh, okay.
That's good.
Like I said guys, these executive lounges,
if you're smart, you could get your dinner out of this
because you could just keep eating like these kind of things,
the meat things and such like,
and then they'll keep replenishing them.
You can come and go eat, eat, eat like that guys.
But I think, I might just try and,
I dunno, be reserved and just eat this for now and
actually go to the dinner buffet, they've got a big dinner buffet here,
later on that I fancy trying out.
But for now, I'm gonna try these out, right here.
Mister Dale do you need some forks?
Yeah, good. You read my mind.
I was about to get up and get some. But you read my mind.
Thank you, so much.
You're welcome.
- Okay.
Okay, first thing I'm gonna try is this sisig,
lumpia sisig spring roll.
They're lovely.
It's just sisig in a crispy on the outside,
soft on the inside spring roll.
It's nice. The texture is perfect, the taste is delicious.
It's coming with a chili.
It's already spicy so I'm not even gonna attempt to eat that with it.
I think that's like a chaser or something.
She says they normally eat these with alcohol,
when they're drinking, like bar food.
Maybe it's like a chaser, I dunno.
I'm happy with this.
And this thing right here, I think it's supposed to be cauliflower.
It's deep fried and battered which,
as a Scotsman, I approve of.
And covered in some kind of sauce.
Yeah guys, that wasn't cauliflower. It's actually squid.
It's like squid that's formed into the shape of a flower.
I thought I read cauliflower on this thing but yeah, it's squid.
One more meaty thing to try.
Looks like a little meatball, right here, dipped in,
maybe a tomato sauce.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, lovely.
It's a meatball and it's a sweet sauce.
Oh, lovely.
Like I said, I could have
like 10 of each of those different things
and feel like I've had my dinner.
Now, dessert.
This one.
Filipino, because it's got cheese on top.
Creamy and sweet.
Nice.
And this, I think it's just fruit.
Yeah, it's like, I dunno,
looks like a ball of mango, water, no papaya.
Mango, papaya and maybe peach.
That's melon.
That's papaya.
And that's mango. Okay.
I got it right. Mango was there but I chose the wrong one,
for what I thought was the mango. And then
the red velvet cake.
I had these when I checked into my room.
There was a couple of them on a plate waiting for me.
That's fantastic and this executive lounge,
I can come here anytime I want between 10.30am and 7pm.
Everyday of my stay.
Fantastic. Thank you, so much.
Can I take sir?
- Yes, finished.
I ate it all and enjoyed it all as well.
It was tasty.
- Already done?
Yeah, I'm done.
I'm gonna go get a massage at the beach now.
Yeah, before they close.
I think they close when the sun goes down.
So, yeah, I will go get the beach massage.
It'll be fun. Thank you, so much. Thank you.
- You're welcome.
I'm feeling refreshed as well because they got the AC unit.
Guys, everywhere in this hotel is like open air
and this is like the only place I've been in the whole hotel resort complex
that's ahh, nice and cold.
Okay, this is one of the few places that have AC, right?
Everything is like open air.
You must feel good working in this part
because it's nice and...
I feel cold here.
You feel cold? I feel perfect.
Because it's like my country. It's like Scotland.
Scotland?
- Yeah, Scotland.
It's like nice and fresh.
Like that. Okay, see you next time, Mary Ann.
See you next time.
Sir can I have your...
- Oh, I need to sign for it?
Yeah, for management only.
For management, okay.
- Your name and your signature.
Thank you.
- Okay, she just wanted my autograph.
No problem.
Yeah, I have to sign when I come in and out so that,
you know, somebody else isn't just using my name and room
number to get free snacks.
Guys, that was fantastic. I enjoyed that.
I'm really happy with the selection there.
That's like one of the better executive lounge experiences I've had.
And I'm gonna be having that multiple times while I'm here.
Fantastic.
Here are the massage.
Yes, I came for the massage.
Mama.
Yes.
You're looking for mama?
Yeah, mama.
You're looking for mama?
Yeah, mama.
Okay, I think mama wants to give me the massage.
Hi, Jerick.
You're in disguise again.
You're trying to protect from the sun, right?
Yeah, because I bought sun screen.
Ah, okay, yeah, otherwise it's dangerous
if you're out all day every day.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay, it's smart.
- Enjoy your massage.
Okay, thank you.
See you tomorrow if you're available, okay?
Yeah, tomorrow I'm gonna take the bike.
Yeah, I'll be, maybe I'll go to Chocolate Hills.
Okay.
Oh, mama is coming? Okay, good.
You can wait because my mum prepare the...
Oh, she's going to prepare? Okay, I will wait.
I will sit here. This is a chair, right?
Sit here, You can sit here.
Ah, okay, I can sit here? Okay.
That looked cooler as a seat, but I'll take the plastic one here.
You want also scrub?
No, I don't want scrub.
Hello, sir.
Can we take a picture?
Ah, okay, no problem.
Gonna get a picture here.
Are you an actor?
Are you a blogger?
No, I'm Leonardo DiCaprio.
Yeah.
That's why I'm at the beach.
Thank you, sir.
Take me to the beach.
No problem, bro.
Yeah, I already follow you.
Really? Ah.
Yeah.
Nice one.
Facebook and Youtube.
Facebook and YouTube?
Yes.
Yeah, everybody should do that. They should subscribe on both.
If they're only subscribed on one, they should subscribe on both.
Yes.
Yeah.
I saw your, the worst place that you there.
The worst place that I went? Where was that?
That you buy some, I think that is.
Ah, no, no, no.
The camel? You ride the camel?
The camel, I ride a camel and a horse?
Yeah?
Yeah.
He said the payment is only.
200
And he asked 5,000.
5,000?
Yeah, not 500, 5,000.
I saw that one.
Yeah, he asked for 25 times the price.
Oh yeah.
Okay.
Okay, good.
So I'm here, face down.
This is my head, face down,
and then after 30 minutes,
we will change.
Okay.
Nice and comfortable.
And it's under a tree, under a coconut tree.
Hopefully it doesn't fall down on my head.
It's not gonna fall?
It's not gonna fall on my head?
This is a coconut tree, right above me.
That'll be a nasty surprise, won't it?
That is okay, sir.
Okay, I'll be all relaxed and then...
Okay, it's all good.
So you're using this oil, coconut oil, right?
Yeah, coconut oil.
Okay.
Nice one, guys.
Nice one.
This is a good way to end the day.
A nice relaxing massage.
She's wiping all the sand off me.
Otherwise it's gonna be like a scrub, more like a scrub than a massage.
No, I don't want the scrub.
I just want the massage, oil.
Okay.
Okay, over like this.
Yeah strong is good. I like strong.
Strong is always good.
Yeah, good.
Good.
Guys, I asked for strong
and that's what I'm getting.
I'm getting strong.
It's okay?
Yeah, it's good.
I'm gonna feel good afterwards.
Hi!
Hi, how are you?
Good.
How are you?
Good.
Enjoying the massage?
Yeah, I'm enjoying very much.
She's very strong and she's doing it properly.
- You are vlogging it?
Yeah, I'm vlogging it as well.
Have fun.
Yeah, thank you.
Yeah.
So sometimes when you get a massage, guys,
they will use too much oil because it's easier for them.
They can just kind of like glide over your skin.
But she's using just a little bit of oil.
It means that she really needs to like press into you.
Do you agree? Excuse me
Hi.
She will also try to do massage for you.
She also wants to give me a massage.
Okay, come.
She can, can.
Can, okay, go, go.
Go, come on.
Come, come.
She wants to do the massage for me? Come, come.
I will break your back.
You'll break my back?
You're not strong enough. You're a little girl.
You're a little girl.
Okay, she's gonna give me a, she's gonna give me a bit of a rub down.
How do you use your muscles properly?
Okay.
Teach her, teach her, so she doesn't break my back.
This will be my part-time job during weekends.
Okay.
How much for a massage?
Oh good, yeah, good.
How much for a massage?
Stronger, stronger.
Stronger.
I haven't eaten yet, I'm still hungry.
I'm still hungry.
You're too soft.
See, you're a little girl.
You're not strong enough.
She's not strong enough.
Nah.
Whats your channel?
Dale Philip.
Dale Philip.
You need to get bigger muscles before you can be a massage lady.
You need bigger muscles.
Maybe I'll just go to the gym during weekend.
Yes.
You need like six months of weight resistance training and then...
Six months.
Yeah, you need like six months.
Oh, my gosh.
You have to pay for the monthly...
No problem.
After that, you can be strong massage lady and make the money
back from the gym membership.
So how much per hour?
Per hour?
They charge 900.
900?
Yeah.
How many persons per day?
One hour.
One hour per massage?
Yeah, but I think they are doing like
five or six people per day.
Six people per day.
Yeah, it's okay, right?
Six people plus times 900.
Yeah.
Times 900.
Yeah, that's good, right?
I can do proper massage with you.
How much more if the guy is much bigger?
Oh yeah, if they're bigger it's more difficult.
Yeah.
I think the more fat that a person has, the
more difficult it is to do a massage
because you need to press in more.
You need, because you're massaging the
muscles, you need to get through the fat.
You have to get through the fat to get to the muscles.
So yeah, the more overweight a person is, the more difficult it is.
This is a challenge and I failed the challenge. I still have to...
It feels nice.
I see you again after six months.
Okay, after six months you come back with
bigger muscles and give me a more stronger.
Oh, that's better, that's better.
Oh, yeah.
Thank you.
After six months, I'll just build some muscles.
But hey, it felt nice but like this, the
strong massage is like the proper one.
It makes you feel like good afterwards but, thank you.
Thank you for that.
But I'm not paying you anything.
I'm not paying you anything for that though.
I'll get my payment after six months.
After six months, okay.
Okay, see you.
I'll ask you for my payment after six months.
Okay, thank you.
I'll build my muscles first.
Philip.
Yeah, Dale Philip.
She has also, she's blogging sometimes.
She's blogging sometimes, really?
Okay, nice.

Okay, if I type Christine into YouTube, there's gonna be so many.
1,000 Christines?
Christine Suarez.
Okay, everybody, look for Christine Suarez on YouTube.
Okay, see you.
Bye bye.
That was nice.
See you in six months, yeah.
That's good.
What you think, she good or no?
No, no, I know.
Too soft. She's too soft.
Yeah, she's not strong like you.
I wonder what happens when it rains and they're giving massages.
Do they just continue or what?
Do they just stop the massage and pay them like half?
I don't know.
But it can just rain randomly here, guys.
Okay, good.
Now, we're halfway through, guys. Gonna flip over and
lie like this.
Feeling good.
She's doing it properly.
She's doing, I've had a lot of massages in
my life and she's definitely
doing it properly.
It's good.
Okay massage? Head?
Head, yeah, head is okay.
Hello, sir.
Hi, how are you?

Dale Philip.
Yeah, I got it.
Okay, you working here?

Same Jerick? oh, you're Jerick's team?
- Jerick's my cousin.
Cousin, oh, big family. Big, big family.
He's with my auntie. Your auntie, ah, Jerick's mother?
Yes.
Ah, okay.
What do they do? I was wondering, what do they do when it starts raining?
If they're giving like one hour massage and it starts raining like after 15 minutes,
what do they do?
Just go, just go.
But the guests have to pay for the massage or what?
If they only do like 15 minutes?
It's up, auntie.
Ah, they will pay half or something like that? Like that? Ah, okay.
And then it's free.
Also free.
Also free?
Yeah.
Ah, okay.
Just joking.
Joking, ah, okay.
Bye bye.
Yeah, bye bye.
Okay, that's nice.
Almost night time.
The sun is already
basically set over there. Sun has set.
Yeah, sunset.
Sunset after.
- Yeah.
Yeah, I think we've got 15 minutes left.
Oh, it is just starting to rain. I can feel, I can feel the rain.
I just felt some rain dripping on me.
So it is starting to rain.
So I'm just finishing off with the legs here.
The strong legs.
Rain is coming now.
Rain, yeah.
She's trying to finish me off quickly.
Because, yeah, I think it was just some lightning there.
I can feel a drizzle on me right now.
It's actually refreshing.
It's so hot here.
I didn't think anywhere could be hotter than Manila.
Manila was roasting.
It was humid.
This is even more roasting, even more humid.
It's crazy. But right now it feels great.
Sunset time.
The sun is down. It's a bit cooler.
And we're getting a little bit of a drizzle
on us right now.
Jerick, is this a new hotel?
Jerick.
Jerick.
It's Jerick, right?
Yeah.
Hi.
This is new hotel?
The owner's, the owner's Henann.
Oh, the same as Henann?
Yes.
But it will be a different hotel, a new hotel?
But different, the name.
- Extended?
Oh, different name?
Yeah yeah yeah.
- Ah okay!
This is the extension of the Henann.
Ah.
But this is not same name of Henann.
Ah, so it will be another hotel.
Make another name.
Yeah.
Maybe it's ????
Ah, okay.
You can read.
Ah, right. But the same owner.
Yeah, same owner.
But good for you, you will have more customers.
But the problem,
someday if this one is finish,
Yeah?
I cannot find the area.
They won't let you stay in this area, you think?
You know the Chinese very...
What, it's Chinese owner or?
The Chinese owner, he cannot allow to be in area.
This area?
Yes.
You think or for sure it will be like that?
For sure.
For sure. Ah!
Also the massaging.
Also the massage? Oh, so you will have to move somewhere else in Bohol?
That's why I told my boss.
Yeah?
Sir, someday if the ????, the owner of the Henann,
if already finish, maybe, we need to find another area.
For our ...
- Yeah your business.
Your business, yes.
For our business.
- Yeah
For me is very difficult.
Ah, right.
Because now, if you get some permit,
for this one it's very difficult.
Ah, okay, but you have the permit now for this?
Yes, of course.
After this is finished one year, two years?
We have already permit, but the problem is the area.
Right, okay.
The area.
Just now this is public land, right?
Just now this public beach.
- Yeah, for me.
For me, this is the public area.
But after this hotel is done.
The Henann, they grab.
All the land?
Yes.
Ah, right, like that.
Okay. I just seen....
Because if you have money, you have power.
Like that, yeah.
Yeah, I just seen this new hotel and I was thinking,
oh, it's more customers for you.
But I didn't think about that, that they might be taking this land from you.
That's why I'm always,
I always tell my brother, because my brother is the owner of this unit.
Yeah?
I'm always tell my brother,
brother.
Don't always order many unit.
Oh, right, if he orders another 20 units, 30 units.
Because someday we don't know.
Ah, like that.
The owner.
Yeah.
Owner, like signal.
Yeah.
Then you have all these units?
Go away.
Nothing to do with the units.
Yeah, that's my point.
Ah, good.
Sunset massage.
My GoPro's picking up the sunset,
but it's not picking up me.
Hey guys, I'm like a silhouette right now.
Okay, thank you so much, mama.
It was so good.
What a good massage that was.
Okay mama, tip for you.
Okay?
- Thank you.
No problem.
Okay, so.
Bye bye.
Bye bye.
So the price for the massage is 900, which is just over $15,
which is a bargain. Oh, these guys are waving at me.
Hello guys.
Hello.
Enjoy your sunset swim.
They've got the whole beach pretty much to themselves, enjoying the sunset.
Check it out, guys.
They've got the whole,
the whole sea for themselves.
I don't know why I'm filming myself.
I'm in the pitch dark right now, but,
yeah, gonna get back to my room and chill.
