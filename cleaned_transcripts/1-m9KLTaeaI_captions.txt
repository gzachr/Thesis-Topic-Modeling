Hello guys, welcome again to a new video,
and right now we are here at the Albay Park and Wildlife Center.
Look at this, and it's literally sandwiched between two prisons,
so Mads, a question for you: have you been bad today?
No.
No, you have not been bad;
otherwise, I should leave you in one of those prisons there,
but I think you were bad last night, right?
Don't say that.
So on the right side of the Wildlife Center,
we have the Legazpi City Jail,
and on the other side of the center is the Albay Provincial Jail.
To be honest, I would love to check out what a jail would look like in the Philippines,
but of course not as a prisoner because I think that would be really bad.
But enough about that.
Let's do what we came here to do, and let's visit the Albay Park and Wildlife Center.
Let's go, guys.
What is the entrance fee?
₱50 for an adult and ₱20 for a child.
So we arrived in the park, guys.
The entry fee was ₱50 per person,
which is less than a Euro,
so that's really cheap.
Oh, look, how beautiful is this bridge over here?
So nice with the small lake or pond.
Beautiful.
So let's see what we can find here in this park.
And here we have the sign, guys.
I love Albay Park and Wildlife.
To be honest, I don't know if you can expect much from this park.
It's not the biggest zoo; it's like only five hectares big,
but we will see.
Over here, they have a small playground for the children with a dinosaur over there,
so we need to be careful.
Do you want to rent a kid's bike Mads?
No.
No, you're okay.
I don't know how to ride it.
Because it's too big for you, but they have smaller ones on the other side. Look.
See, it's a four-wheel-drive, Mads.
Maybe I'm safe.
Okay, where should we go, Mads?
Here.
We go that way.
Oh, I think you can even take a boat here on the water.
Here we have some birds inside,
so I can only see one bird, but...
It's a Philippine eagle.
Yeah.
So those are like all different kinds of chickens and pigeons too.
Where is the Nicobar pigeon? I cannot see it.
The Nicobar Pigeon, what a beauty!
It looks like a small peacock.
The beautiful Philippine deer.
You like those Mads?
Yeah, I'm looking for Rudolph. I think he's the one.
For what are you looking?
The Rudolph of Santa Claus.
Well, I'm happy to see that they have enough space to run around.
Because sometimes in some zoos it can be a problem,
but here they have space enough for sure.
So it seems the park here has around 350 animals
of around 75 different kinds of species,
and yeah, some cages might look a little bit small to be honest,
or like this one here,
so sad all by himself, no friends at all, so sad right?
I think when you look up animals,
it should be obligated to have at least two of them
because otherwise it's a lonely life right?
See another nice, beautiful bird here,
but he's also all alone.
Hello, look at him.
There, we can see a cheeky monkey.
Mads, did you see a map somewhere?
Because It's very difficult to find out where the animals are.
I haven't seen it yet.
Yeah, I haven't seen a map either.
It's not the biggest park, so maybe if you just follow the trail,
you will see all the animals anyway.
And it seems over here we have the lizards.
There you can see one of the lizards.
It's a huge one.
Look at this one.
So this is a monitor lizard.
Oh, they can get like two meters long and weigh around 20 kilograms.
At least those ones aren't alone.
Oh, look, they have you.
There's a lovebird.
Where?
It says love bird on the sign.
Ah, love bird.
We are lovebirds. Yes.
This is Mads favorite type of animal.
Yeah, that is also python.
I have goosebumps.
You have goosebumps.
For a second, I was thinking this is scary:
the chicken next to a python,
but then I looked at the other side of the cage,
and there we have a python, so it's actually his meal.
Poor chicken, but it seems he's not hungry yet.
Hello chicken.
If they will give me the chicken, I will cook it and make adobo.
Look love.
She's so scared of snakes.
Let's go check out the lovebirds, Mads.
Yeah, let's go.
I think they're over there.
So hot.
Here we have a beautiful example of the lovebird.
Nice music.
Look at this one.
The hornbill, beautiful.
This is actually my favorite bird.
So beautiful, right?
Coco.
I wonder if he speaks Tagalog.
Kuya, Ate?
No.
Salamat po.
Here I am, here I am. How do you do?
Black, black, Black sheep.
It's not a black sheep; it's a white sheep.
I'm sorry.
The domestic sheep.
You know I can speak sheep language.
Look.
I am better.
See?
See, they reply to you.
Hello.
Mads, you were shocked?
Yeah.
Be careful, Mads, because they will lock you up with the sheep.
They will think you've escaped.
Okay.
Most of the species they have here are all birds, but it's very interesting.
These look really beautiful, too.
Look at this.
So nice.
They say it's a Philippine deer, but it's a black sheep.
And look at all the birds nearby,
and over there we have a wild horse, I think.
The baboy, the native pig, they're chilling.
They eat a lot, and then they sleep.
Little bit like you, then Mads when you eat.
No, you too.
That was a good one.
The beautiful peacocks.
Look at this crocodile! Oh my God, it's huge.
He is quite a bit smaller than Lolong.
Lolong is...
Yeah, Lolong is something different of course, but this is a big one.
(Lolong was the largest crocodile in captivity, measured at 6.17 m or 20 ft 3 in).
They're sleeping.
Three meters, two meters, two meters and a half?
It's my first time to see a real crocodile.
Ah, it's your first time to see a real crocodile, Mads.
before Lolong is from the museum.
Yeah.
But it's only bones.
It's a really big one.
So this you like more than snakes?
Okay yeah.
I'm thirsty.
Let's have a drink Mads.
Here in this building, they have...
There is a shake.
A food shop here in this building, you can find some drinks.
It's like some food corner around here.
Yeah, you can have some pizza or something else.
Ah, look, they have cool refreshments.
What you want?
Its okay.
So I will have a Royal Tru lemon.
Thank you.
₱45. ₱45.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Oh, a nice, cold Royal.
Ah, amazing.
Oh, and it's really ice cold.
So what will you have, Mads?
I buy a melon shake, and V-Cut my favorite.
Ah, your favorite. Not sponsored.
It's chips?
It's chips.
And what kind of flavor?
Potato barbecue.
Barbecue spicy. Ah okay.
You want?
I will try one. Yes.
Let me see how are these chips you like so much.
Yeah, they're good chips.
It's not like really spicy.
You're right, Mads.
But it's a real potato.
You're sure it's a real potato?
Yeah. Did you see them make it?
I don't know.
Then you don't know for sure if it's a real potato.
Yeah, it's quite nice here.
If you are hungry, you for sure can find something here.
Thirsty, shakes, pizzas, hot dogs, spaghetti...
A small food corner here, or should I say a small round food dome.
Can you go up here?
I actually think you can go up here.
Let's check it out.
Let's see what's on top of this food stand.
Oh, it's closed.
Are you kidding me?
Oh, I was shocked.
No, you cannot go here, or you can?
Oh yes, you can go here.
Lets see.
Here we have a view.
Ah, there they are.
See, you have a viewing deck here I would never find.
Oh my God, the slippery here.
Crazy.
Oh my God, so slippery.
I almost felt.
I need to be careful here.
So let's show you guys the lake where we entered with the bridge.
Oh my god, it's so slippery here.
Now I get why nobody comes up here.
You can break your neck here.
Ah, a small Chinese or Japanese garden.
A really small park, to be honest.
But for yeah, less than a Euro, what can you complain about?
Let's go back down to the food stand.
Oh, and finally here we have a map of the park.
I finally found it, so we have seen,
oh, this we have already seen, yeah, all this part,
and here are the lion and the tiger,
so this one we need to check out.
So where are we?
Food court.
So we are here somewhere.
Ah, and the ostrich,
the one that Mads wants to see, we saw already from the top of the dome.
those are here as well,
and then we actually saw most of it.
So let's find Mads again.
She's waiting there.
I will tell her the good news that I found the ostriches.
Mads I have some good news and I have some bad news.
The bad news is that we almost saw everything here.
The good news is that I found where the ostriches are.
Ah really?
Yes. Elphant?
And I found where the tiger and the lion are as well.
And what are you having now?
Watermelon. Watermelon.
You want to try?
Yeah, it's my favorite shake, beside vanilla.
Mmm, it's nice.
So let's wait for Mads to finish her shake and her chips,
and then we go see the ostriches, a tiger, and a lion.mmm, it's nice.
You will see the ostrich.
Yes.
I already see them.
You see them?
Where's the giraffe? There is no giraffe?
I don't think so.
Ostrich.
Where is the ostrich.
We don't have like cabbage to give them?
Ostrich!!!
Look, they're there.
Yeah.
Is that the sound they make?
Oh, look, he's coming.
They're really big.
They are taller than me.
Yeah, and then me too.
They're all three here, Mads.
Look especially for you.
Oh, they want to bite you, Mads.
They want to bite you.
Look look.
They're so beautiful.
The Donkey.
Yeah, Mads It's here, the lion.
Wow.
This is actually the closest I've ever been to a lion.
It's Simba.
Simba.
See, it's Simba; he's coming.
It's so sad that there is only one lion.
He's so thin.
He's very thin.
He's very thin.
Yeah, and he's all alone, so sad, in a small cage.
It's such a beautiful animal, but at the same time,
it's so sad that he's here all by himself.
Yes.
So beautiful I've never seen a lion so close before.
The lion is pooping.
Oh, he's pooping.
Yeah, see, come closer.
Oh yeah, he pooped,
but it's sad, to be honest.
Really sad.
He should at least have a female lion.
Yeah.
Okay, and I think the other cage is where the tiger is.
The tiger lets go.
So let's see if we can see the tiger.
So, I think here is the Tiger.
Oh yes. Oh my God, he's very thin as well, but it's a beautiful animal.
and again, all by himself,
so sad but such a beautiful animal;
it's my favorite animal.
They are biting also?
Yeah, yeah, Mads, they do.
They are not friendly?
No, they're not friendly.
If you would go close to them, they would eat you.
Oh, really?
Yeah, yeah.
They look nice, and they look cuddly, but...
They are so thin.
Yeah.
Oh, look, he can almost put his head through there.
I love it, guys.
Ending our visit here to the Albay Park and Wildlife Center
with a visit to this beautiful animal here.
The perfect way to end this visit to this beautiful park.
Unfortunately, yeah, it's mixed feelings.
Yeah, if you see those animals alone by themselves all day.
Yeah, it's quite sad.
Should I at least have a buddy and a bigger space to wander around.
But yeah, I can see it's actually a nice place to come with kids if you're from the area
or you have some time to spend in the area.
You can see some different kinds of animals.
It's a very small park.
I think you can see most of it in what,
one hour and a half or two hours.
Yeah, something like that.
Ride in a tricycle or in a taxi.
Yeah, it's not so far; it's just next to the Legazpi City Airport
and sandwiched in between two jails.
So now let's go to another destination.
Yes.
And we will end our video over there.
Let's go, guys.
Bye bye, tiger,
and bye bye, lion.
Bye bye, Simba.
Okay, let's go then.
Oh, we didn't go to the Dino Park, but it's okay.
Because they're not alive anyway,
but it's quite nice to see some dinos.
Koi fish.
Their fishes.
Koi fish.
It's a really beautiful bridge.
So guys, we will now leave the park and go to our next destination,
Lignon Hill.
Let's go, guys.
It's also a prison here.
Look at these murals here on the way to Lignon Hill.
Really nicely done.
Stop using drugs.
I think this is actually the walls of the other prison,
so it's like...
I see it's all about drugs for some reason.
Ah, see, I was right.
It is a prison.
So this is the Albay Provincial Jail,
and that was the Legazpi City Jail.
Yeah.
So what's the difference?
The border.
This is the local one, and and for example, these are the more dangerous criminals,
or what do you think?
I think if a people or person will commit a crime within the certain of border of Albay,
they go here,
and if they commit the crime in Legazpi, they go there.
Ah, okay, it's not like that prison is more strict than the other one.
Yeah.
I thought it was something like that.
That this one, for example, had the more dangerous criminals in it,
and the other was like for short-term criminals
or something like that for light offenses.
I don't know, but I really like these murals.
So, for example, here we have a graveyard with tombstones
with the words rest in peace written on them,
and here we also have the Grim Reaper with the key in his hand.
Something like that,
and I think these are prisoners.
Maybe they try to break out of the jail.
I don't know because here's like a jail.
And the Grim Reaper has the key or something of the jail; I don't know.
What I think instead of staying in jail,
they still have a good heart and believe in God.
Yeah, maybe.
We all know what this is.
I think it's all about temptations.
So like you can see here, you have the words drugs
drag you down, down, down,
and then you see a dead tree,
a tombstone, and here a syringe with some pill.
Yeah, and here are some tennis fields as well.
Tenniscourt.
And I think we should go that way now, right over there.
Mads, can you do tennis?
Yeah.
Because you're a professional, you were a professional badminton player.
Yeah, I do play tennis, table tennis,
and all the things that we cross towards with a racket.
All the things you play where you like to hit a ball with.
Yes.
Yeah um...
Oh, look what we have here?
This is beautiful too,
the Eiffel Tower.
We have some pirate ship down there,
the globe,
a pigeon, the whale shark down there as well.
Quitinday.
Or it can be Bohol.
Oh no, Bohol would be brown.
Yeah Quitinday.
Quitinday Hills,
and here the Mayon volcano.
We have as well, and what is this then?
The San Francisco Bridge?
San Juanico Bridge.
Ah okay.
Ah, and the rice fields.
The rice, Banaue.
Yes, the rice fields.
Look, they already said here. Use low gear. Steep Hill.
So it will be a climbing adventure, Mads.
Yes, let's do it.
Let's do it.
That looks like some old army trucks down there.
We just were passing by.
I have no idea how far the climb is,
but we will see.
Ah, it's here I think.
We're greeted by the friendly dogs,
and there I can see welcome.
Hello doggies.
Lignon hill.
Yeah, welcome to Lignon Hill.
Lignon, Lignon, whooohoo.
So steep.
It's not as steep as the way to our hotel,
because that's a lot steeper.
Look, we have a Japanese plane there.
I actually heard that in this area there are Japanese war tunnels;
maybe it has something to do with that.
I don't know.
So guys, we're hiking towards the top now of Lignon Hill,
which is a prominent mountain in the city of Legazpi.
It rises around 512 feet, or around 156 meters,
and yeah, it's quite hard, to be honest;
it's getting steeper and steeper, but we will make it,
and then we will hopefully enjoy a beautiful view
of the Mayon Volcano and the City of Legazpi.
How is it going, Mads?
It's okay.
Yeah, we can make it.
We already have a nice view from here.
By the way, you can already see
We already climbed a little bit.
I'll show you.
You can see it here.
Between the vegetation.
Yes, actually, you can see it over there;
it's Legazpi City Airport, the Landing Strip.
Oh my God, well, it's good that it's not so sunny anymore
because otherwise it would make this climb even harder.
Oh, look at that, from here you can see the City Airport.
And then over there, the city of Legazpi is behind it.
Most people, when they go on vacation they always gain weight.
When I go on vacation, I go back and they say to me,
Oh, you lost weight. You didn't like the food?
No, it's because I always go on these hikes,
hiking all day and walking all day.
Sometimes I even forget to eat,
which is not good, but okay,
at least it's good for my tummy.
This is quite steep, Mads.
Wait love.
You want to wait a second.
Mads needs to catch her breath.
Okay, let's do it.
Don't force yourself; we have time.
Yeah, dear.
We have a bench here, Mads.
You can rest for a bit.
The four way test of things we think, say, or do.
Yeah, look at this amazing view here already.
I think we're almost there, guys.
We almost made it Mads.
Look, we're here.
Or is this the highest point?
We did it. Oh, that was a tough one.
So what can we do here, guys?
There of course, we have the Mayon volcano,
but he's hiding again.
I think here we have some shops but...
The shops are closed.
They're all closed?
Okay, thank you so much.
Where are you from?
I'm from Belgium, and you?
Philippines.
From here, this area?
So you did your workout.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's a hard climb.
And here's the view.
So it seems that all the shops are closed,
but maybe we'll have a nice view from the other side as well,
so let's take a look there.
No.
No, viewpoint from the back side of the building.
Is it actually something new they're making here,
or because it looks empty?
Oh, Mads, you came from the other side.
Yeah.
No, there's no view here.
Yeah, so no shops,
so if you decide to hike here,
be sure to bring some bottled water with you.
Like we did.
Yeah, fresh water from the tumbler.
Sponsored by Ellen (Mads sister).
So beside of Mayon volcano over there,
this point is actually the highest point in Legazpi,
with an amazing view over here.
I will show you, guys.
Look at this.
I took this path here.
I wonder what is there.
I'm going to leave Mads behind for a while.
She's so tired.
Oh, nothing here, to be honest.
That's a zip line.
An old zip line or something like that.
There's not so much to do here except the view to be honest.
Actually, there's nothing to do here except a beautiful view,
but I think it was worth it.
We had some cardio workout,
we saw some beautiful views,
but I think we should go back down soon
because I think soon it will start to rain, Mads.
Yeah.
Yeah, look there.
The Mayon is covered by clouds.
Mayon didn't show.
No no.
So let's go?
Yeah, I think we should go, Mads.
Maybe just have a look there and then we can go.
It is a beautiful sight, though.
It looks little bit like Rice Terraces in front of the Mayon volcano.
Yeah, unfortunately, there is not much to do here except the view;
the shops are closed, the zip line is closed.
So guys, I think this was it then for this video.
I hope you guys enjoyed our adventure here in Legazpi,
and I will see you guys again soon from Cebu City.
So take care, guys.
Cheers. Bye-bye!
What do you mean, Mads? There's no Grab here?
They can't go up here.
So we need to go back down?
O no! Let's go.
Let's go. We can do it.
I was thinking...
We did it first, right?
Yeah.
So we can make it.
Your legs are shaking?
No, yours are.
Oh.
You have spaghetti legs.
And you? You have strong legs?
Yeah.
Oooh, don't complain.
Like a buffalo.
Oh, don't complain now. Oh my God.
Like a buffalo,
I have legs like a buffalo, and then at night I complain,
and I always say, Oh aww, Mads, Mads.
I have pain in my legs, but she never massages me.
What really?
Yeah.
I've massaged you many times.
Yeah, you jump on me and hurt me even more.
It's starting to rain now, even.
Oh my God.
Okay, good luck to us.
It's raining.
