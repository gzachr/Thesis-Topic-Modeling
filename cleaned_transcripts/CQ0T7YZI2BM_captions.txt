so close so close
wow that was crazy
she actually died for it too but i
couldn't get it
oh nice
nice what a blog
wow both teams are
doing pretty good the balls up for a bit
going back and forth back and forth
i think this is the final set uh two
sets one by philippines
to set one by indonesia
oh and outside
[Applause]
oh
nice that was a good one i like the way
like
both the guys and the ladies the way
they fake it one person
jumps to say that they're gonna hit it
and then they don't and somebody else
comes
confuses the opponents
she's good twice so she's happy
some of those shots are like pretty fast
[Applause]
oh
and outside
nice
nice
oh oh
wow what a nice
[Applause]
she almost got it
oh
[Applause]
nice oh
[Applause]
oh my goodness
[Applause]
nice
[Applause]
indonesia wow that was
nice from both sides
nice
it's a lot of back and forth back and
forth
there you indonesia is coming back
um
[Applause]
uh
[Applause]
to change size i guess because of half
time
[Applause]
the game is in philippines so they have
the
home crowd advantage
the fans go nuts when they score
[Applause]
nice there you go good work
nice
[Applause]
doing
[Applause]
oh
i've seen most of the time even with the
guys too when they block it
it goes out
nice safe
wow see you again it's tough
filipino fans just celebrating
game that like these are more fun
because
both sides are like so close basically
like anybody can win
but if it was for example the
philippines was three and indonesia was
one
uh set or the other way around indonesia
was three and one and like
eh you already know who's gonna win
right but in this case
they're 2-2 and even the points are
pretty close
10-12
yeah there you go finally work didn't go
out
11 12 they're coming back the sisters
are coming back
nice oh wow what a save
oh no 12 12
[Applause]
no 13 11.
this is intense
[Laughter]
you guys see it hopefully it shows it
she runs oh no i didn't show it
[Applause]
oh nice wow what a save
wow this is the kind of game that they
call that
nail biter because you're just like ah
who's gonna win you're cheering for the
scene your team and then the
points are so close
[Applause]
super close
yeah it's in
oh that was another nice one
they're coming back good
[Applause]
that was beautiful such a nice touching
over the net
[Applause]
they fixed it that they're going to hit
it hard and
it's good
[Applause]
oh
ah the final set its first two 16 i
guess wins
nice beautiful that was
that was amazing so paul
close philippines was actually leading
14 and indonesia was 12 then they got 13
then i guess 14 15 and then
last 16. wow
amazing
the ladies deserve a round of applause
because they did
really really well really really nice
guys this was
enjoyable like i said it was really
intense because he's like who's going to
win who's going to win
and uh in the newsroom was actually
behind throughout the game
at at least a fifth set and then finally
close to the end they started going up
and they took the game
like i said in the previous video this
is really nice to see because
it puts the sisters and you know in a
world-class
event in front of the world to see that
for example
the muslim woman is not oppressed the
reason in certain countries
like afghanistan for example or other
asian countries where the woman
is oppressed it's not because of
religion but rather it's because of
lack of religion and it's due to culture
so just wanted to clarify that like i
said in case somebody didn't know or
they had a question hopefully that
helped them and thank you very much guys
for suggesting this video because it was
really interesting and intense so i hope
you guys enjoyed it
