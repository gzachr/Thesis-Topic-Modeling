what's going on folks this is Lehman Thomas and 
welcome back so today I'm going to be checking out  
another video about Philippines so the reason I'm 
starting to react to more on Philippines videos  
because I'm planning on a little vacation around 
the world I have picked Australia Maldives uh  
Indonesia and my fourth option is Philippines 
so I'm just I'm gonna travel to either one  
of the countries so I'm learning more about each 
countries every day so I'm really excited to check  
this video out I think this video is going to be 
a eye-opener or let's say this video is going to  
be very real on what's going on in Philippines 
and how tough It's to get everything and what  
are the problems we might face on Philippines so 
really excited to check this video guys so check  
Emmy and John Jonah and Philippines Channel we 
have like 27 subscribers 27k subscribe just like  
us so go check them out subscribe to the channel 
let's check this video out a bit scared as well  
to be honest I felt unsafe and that I wanted 
safe when we first arrived I wasn't actually  
what's going on I specifically said that this 
would not be a country where we settled down it  
we couldn't just understand how anything worked 
welcome to another day in paradise yes we're in  
Paradise we're in Chicago and today what are we 
doing babe we got some questions a few weeks ago  
and a lot of people asked like what we think of 
the Philippines and so we think this episode is  
gonna be us talking about that like why did 
we actually yeah and our likes and also a  
few dislikes about living in the Philippines to 
be able to do this I think we need some coffee  
if we need some snacks so let's head over and 
get some pandas out yeah let's go okay foreign
Philippines displays the exact place in 
Philippines kind of looks like Kerala  
Kerala which is a state near my state I'm 
from Tamil Nadu so this looks familiar
what the heck
are they riding a cow
are they riding on a cow what's going on 
wow that's that's will never happen in India  
why not talk about it at our most beloved place 
within the Philippines right there and we have  
a few things we're gonna plant this little one 
so we're gonna show you what we did last time  
yeah and we're kind of failing with that 
thing last time so that's why we need this  
one yeah and we didn't upload a video last week 
because I've been a little bit sick nothing uh  
dangerous what do you say what yeah nothing 
too serious it was just a small cold but I  
was coughing and it was not very nice to film that 
so now I'm better and okay guess what they should  
buy a good civilization for their camera because 
this looks so shaky it's making me dizzy slightly
I'm just in love with Philippines 
right now when we first arrived  
I wasn't actually too happy about it I we 
specifically said that this would not be a country  
where we settle down in and I would love it but 
we arrived in Cebu in March 2020 so right when the  
lockdowns were happening where are they going so 
I think the big piece the number one is we could  
not find decent food we were vegan at the time and 
trying to find vegan food in Cebu City as a total  
novice and having no idea where to go impossible 
we just couldn't find any of these in food at  
all okay today when there's this entrance this is 
their entrance to the property so it's going to be  
hard to find any vegan food in Philippines right 
so I think I'll be fine nowhere near Wigan I am  
stretching out the fence on both sides and 
then when you enter the idea is where are  
they even living what's what's this place 
it looks like a village what's this place
massive plants coming up and the only the 
tiniest direction oh wow what massive plan  
it's a Banana Leaf it's a banana plant we call 
it volatar in here in Tamil Nadu we call itar  
you can Google it that's the name of this plan
banana trees and I'm not sure what they're called 
actually but we call these guys the elephant ears  
which I think is really really cool but they're 
all kind of dying at us after we we planted them  
so hopefully with today's little pruning they can 
do better okay it's quite time already coffee time
okay let's get down to business guys [Music]
yes
vegan food and also we couldn't just understand 
how anything worked nothing made any sense you  
went to the supermarket and like the lines were 
forever and everything was done manually and we  
find what we need them one thing that I'm 
thinking of like it's not why we didn't like  
the Philippines but one thing that's different so 
when we went to the store in the Philippines the  
first times and there is a cue to them can clear 
and sometimes they were no queue like people were  
just standing like in not a line it just stood 
like wherever and it felt like people try to cut  
yeah cut in line and go okay first and in Sweden 
that's really rude we are really strict with our  
pews and lines you have to stay in the queue like 
of course it happens and people do it as well but  
everyone will be super mad at that person right 
so that was something that we thought it was a  
little bit annoying yeah I was thinking about like 
going to the market like we are used to you going  
to the supermarket and you find everything you 
find everything from veggies to um fruit to Rice  
to Pasta to meat like whatever you want to have 
here which we like now like you have to go to the  
market to find fish you have to go to the market 
to the veggie Market to find veggies we have to  
go to one store to buy um whatever you know and I 
said we used to go to one place and here you have  
to go to like 10 places to do your like normal 
shopping which which was a little bit annoying  
in most Kobe times the supply chains 
were having problems even we came from  
Australia they were running out okay to 
be fair that's how it should be because  
we don't know what's what's going to happen 
with the fish and its bacteria we don't want  
that to mix with the vegetables to be fair that's 
how it should be these European peoples always  
eat frozen food like frozen chicken they 
cut the chicken and keep their own fridge  
and say that's fresh no that's 
not fresh that's old that's frozen
toilet paper right yeah so everyone was having 
problems at the time but it was such a big  
difference from what we were used to yeah that's 
the right word and the also thing you have to be  
fair like we have to counting kovid and all this 
because everything was not like it should be
um we're talking about tourists being 
attract in in the boxes and measures
yeah hopefully it was only rumors but that made 
us a little bit scared as well to be honest I  
felt unsafe and that I wanted to leave the country 
uh we have been here for two years now and I feel  
super safe like wherever we go boom hold on we've 
helped Millions they've been here for two years  
dang it let me just watch it 
again are they here for two years
yeah hopefully it was only rumors but that made 
us a little bit scared as well to be honest I  
felt unsafe and that I wanted to leave the 
country uh we have been here for two years  
now and I feel super safe like wherever we go boom 
so they've been here for two years what's what's  
the first then or did they say nothing works 
here it was the first they know what's going on
part of our entrance the whole point is for this 
to be a jungle every time you come home we're  
met by this oh nice I'm so looking forward 
to that do they live here I must say one of  
them Philippines is the nature here even though 
because everything grows so quickly compared to  
back home this kind of tropical climate right now 
that's also a bit of a hindrance our stairs and  
continuously overgrowing and we can't really 
be bothered to do anything about it it's just  
plants everywhere all right what do you want to 
do first thing I love this it's so green it's so  
refreshing to see even it'll be awesome if you 
guys if I go and check out them my place here is  
also green and it's in it's a good place to live 
also but it looks it looks more like India as well
what do you want to fix their private property  
stairs because I sleep before okay this is all 
right some new fresh day here uh we didn't have  
too much to share we continue this Vlog today 
we're at homemade taste here in Chicago where  
you get nice vegan homemade food and we're playing 
Ginga how are we doing babe pretty good I'm gonna  
I'm not too sure about that 
this move then boom okay
[Music] that people in the Philippines are just 
the most smiling and kind people that ever met  
during my travels right from the get-go I came 
here during Kobe there was a lot of restrictions  
but yet the individual people always super 
friendly to us yes I have experienced that because  
my 70 to 80 of my subscribers are Philippines 
and they have only been nice to me and if I  
makes a silly mistakes they correct me in a 
soft manner which I really like and I also  
have encountered with the other country people 
especially I don't want to name the country but  
it starts with the N uh um those people 
are rude so rude don't like them at all  
spiritual to help us out in any way they 
could wouldn't you say yeah and as I said  
when my mom was here when she was like 
falling people always try to help and  
that's why we'll be feeling all the time yeah 
Philippines people are good like genuinely
yes
rice and what's that and I think this is also how 
we're solving for that not finding good food in  
the Philippines we find the right places this is 
a great vegan place in Chicago sorry uh and we  
always love the food here and this time it's 
tempura tofu and Chinese style Teriyaki okay
the doll wants a bit of it
that was homemade taste so let's get feel okay
okay this is what I came for the 
peaches I really want to explore  
the beaches and all the tropical Falls and 
everything that's what I came for here guys  
let me know if there's any video about more 
about the beaches and all the tropical stuff
the beach
not nominated what do you say yeah yeah to 
um like like the best beach destination in  
the world oh wow I don't see that I want to see 
that we're living here I want to see that let  
me know it really feels like we are in the 
rainy season right now it just started here  
on checkout I know it's a bit different like 
the rest of the Philippines love whatever but  
it started to rain so we head back home and now 
it's sunny now it's sunny again but that's how it  
rainy season is here right it's raining a little 
bit and the sun it's raining a little bit it's  
back and forth wow this is getting interesting 
there's always to help us done by clicking the  
Subscribe this Philippines thing which I'm 
doing is right now getting interesting guys  
okay so so I find nothing to complain in this 
video and there's a title saying uh nothing  
works here but I did not find any such thing 
which won't work yeah things happen in certain  
places certain countries certain things happen and 
this is just a slight error from the people which  
they accept it but when it when we are coming 
from European countries we people find people  
may find it different because that won't happen 
in their country but I don't think this is a  
big error because I will easily settle in in 
this country if I go there because I watched  
two videos and two videos have a lot of common 
things from India and Philippines so I would  
love to come to Philippines I want to explore the 
like an exotic stuff guys let me know let me know
