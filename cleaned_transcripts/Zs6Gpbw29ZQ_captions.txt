hey everyone it's michael here again and welcome 
to another one of our videos in this video we're  
going to be talking about the nine types 
of filipinas that you should actually avoid  
dating or getting into a relationship with right 
and at the very same time as i'm just gonna go  
ahead and add an extra bonus type of filipina 
tours later so we're gonna make it 10 types  
of filipinas right so before we even get started 
don't forget to subscribe to this channel if you  
like the content also make sure you click the 
bell icon to be notified of new videos we'll  
be releasing three to four videos every week of 
content for you guys the main goal this channel is  
to provide expats and foreigners tips and tricks 
and ideas about filipinos especially if you're  
planning to find yourself a filipina over here in 
the philippines to either date marry or maybe you  
just want to come here to the philippines and have 
some fun right so let's go ahead and get started  
the number one this is the money focused filipina 
now typically you're gonna be able to know right  
away who is this woman now i'm not saying that 
some of them are scammers right but you know  
this is a precursor for finding out that this 
woman could potentially be a scammer when they're  
asking already about money and what i mean about 
money focus it's not just about them going to you  
and say hey can you send me some money it's not 
just that type of filipina not just that type of  
person i'm talking about when you start hearing 
them you know it's all about something in regards  
to monetary focus like she wants to have a house 
she wants to have a car you know she wants to be  
able to make sure you know there's there's just 
so much that she starts talking about it's always  
about money and other than the fact that she wants 
money she also talks about she's always not having  
enough money she's having problems financially she 
she can't take care of her family you know if this  
is the primary focus where majority time the 
conversations the topics that you're having with  
her it's related to something monetary then that 
right there could be a potential person that you  
should actually avoid now listen we all have 
problems when it comes to money sometimes you  
know especially in the philippines over here in 
the philippines that's going to happen as well  
it is it is the truth it's one of the biggest 
problems a lot of people have is something lack  
of money right but at the very same time as if 
that's the only sole focus of a person who they're  
always talking about just money this money that 
lack of this lack of that then right there alone  
is a person that you should actually avoid dating 
the second person the second type of filipina that  
you as a foreigner or expat should actually avoid 
is the person who has anger issues now listen  
when we first meet somebody it's all about the 
honeymoon phase but eventually you're actually  
going to start finding out more about a person you 
know they're going to get mad easily right that's  
just gonna happen sometimes this is actually part 
of somebody who's just super jealous like they're  
bringing in their past experiences with their past 
relationships into your relationships and you as a  
person who is deciding to actually get with the 
filipina the truth is guys we should not bring  
our past baggage our past experiences past you 
know mistakes that we've done or past things  
that were done to us by our you know person the 
person we had in our previous relationships right  
so we definitely want to be able to 
avoid that the next one is the number  
the number three type of filipina that you should 
avoid dating is the one who's not a good person to  
have a conversation with like listen you know the 
whole physical aspect them looking so beautiful  
sexy cute them being very sexual and taking care 
of you in the bedroom those are all great things  
and should be involved you know in a relationship 
but at the very same time as you must be able to  
have a great conversation you guys must have good 
communication between each other now here's the  
thing guys you know potentially that when you 
meet a filipina that they not they might not be  
that good in english you know a lot of filipinos 
speak great english and so a lot of filipinas  
you know actually you don't even know that they 
have a filipino accent like it's like they've been  
living in the united states or they've been living 
in europe or they've been living in australia  
right but at the very same time as you want to be 
able to have a communi have a good communication  
with somebody to be able to talk about not just 
the physical aspect but something about spiritual  
something about the more emotional things to 
know what they want and at the same time as they  
need to be able to understand and know what you 
want as well without good communication without  
great conversation a relationship is pretty much 
doomed and about to be failed it's going to become  
a failure right so make sure that you know you 
have great conversations you don't just want to  
be able to start talking to a filipina then all 
of a sudden she's gonna say hi bye hello how are  
you i'm good i'm great you know how is work you 
know all those kind of things those are so basics  
they need to be able to want to know more about 
you and you need to be able to know more about  
them and they should be able to give that to you 
now there's a couple things that you need to do  
or you can do and that is listen you know they're 
trying to learn your language so why shouldn't you  
try to learn the tagalog language or maybe visaya 
language or ilonggo language whatever their  
their dialect uh is in the philippines maybe 
you should actually learn that as well okay  
because they learn english if they learn english 
why can't you learn you know their language why  
can you learn tagalog you know i do um i try to 
do my best to learn the tagalog language and to  
learn the other dialects as well i'm not saying 
become a great conversational person in that  
language or in that dialect but at the same time 
is to be able to understand so there's something  
of a similarities between us so great conversation 
is an important thing number four is this filipina  
who's unfortunately loves to drink and loves 
to use drugs either or or both at the same time  
now you guys understand filipinos love what 
they call gimmick which is pretty much they  
find excuses every day to go out to go drink trust 
me i have not gone out with with filipinos and it  
doesn't have to it doesn't involve alcohol there's 
always for some reason alcohol somewhere whether  
it's some cheap gin from san miguel or a cheap you 
know beer and stuff like that it doesn't matter or  
cheap rum cheap tequila it doesn't matter it's 
always going to be some form of alcohol involved  
when it comes to a filipino gimmick or gathering 
it's just natural right even during funerals um so  
you have to understand that you know there's one 
thing where you want to you can drink occasionally  
but when alcohol becomes the only reason why you 
and your significant other can actually have fun  
then ultimately that's going to cause problems 
and we all know it we all see what happens with  
alcoholics you know eventually if the person 
needs that in order to become a normal person  
then there's going to be problems later on so you 
definitely want to stay away from a filipina who's  
into pretty much these little vices drugs or 
alcohol now the fifth thing that filipinos you  
want to avoid dating is a person who's very 
greedy this is kind of goes with the whole  
money focus thing as well but this is the person 
who always is you know either greedy or they're  
envious of other people you know you hear them 
always talking oh this person just bought that  
or this person went here or this person had this 
vacation or this person's you know husband bought  
her a ring or that person's boyfriend you know 
took her on vacation all these different things  
greed and at the same time is you know being 
jealous of other people right and not enjoying  
what they have at that moment with you these 
type of people are are someone you should avoid  
now the sixth one is something you're gonna hear 
from pretty much almost everybody um there are  
some people say it's okay and listen i may offend 
some people here if you guys listen to this video  
you're gonna say something like you know mine is 
you know it's not nothing like that and the sixth  
type of person that you should technically avoid 
dating are bar girls right and you know let me  
put a caveat in this you know not all bar girls 
that you know starts working at the bars here in  
the philippines if you know what i mean those 
go-go bars where you can take out a girl you  
know for a minimal fee um what ends up happening 
is not all ball girls are made the same there's  
the ones we call who just enjoy this and this is 
their life and they take advantage of it they just  
know they just know the game right don't hate 
the player hate the game is what they say right  
but they just know the game that's being played 
and there's some girls out there who are naturally  
just innocent but this is the only choice that 
they have to be able to take care of their family  
do those exist a lot of them do they're just 
doing this to make sure that they're doing  
their job to take care of the family or maybe 
put themselves to school it's the whole you know  
stripper story you know they're they're stripping 
for now just to become a nurse later on right  
but yes there are those stories and so but at 
the very same time in majority wise you know  
meeting a bar girl can potentially cause problems 
for you it's literally a 90 to 10 percent chance  
that you're gonna get a bad bad bad results with 
it now there's gonna be guys like i said that  
watch this video they're gonna say well you 
know my girl is nothing like those i'm happy  
i'm enjoying my life with my bargain more 
power to you that's great for you i'm glad  
that that's where you are at that moment and and 
i'm glad that you were that 10 but the other 90  
of failures on relationships because guys decided 
to date a bar girl or marry embargo is more  
out there and so you guys have to understand 
is you know listen it's not it maybe not even  
them it's maybe even also caving to social 
pressure meaning that they have friends they  
have relatives that then says oh do this do that 
this is going to work for you this is how you  
ask for more money this is what you get more for 
that you know so i would say just thread lightly  
if this is an area that you want to do if you 
actually want to date or marry yourself a bar girl  
if you want to enjoy and have fun you know 
go ahead do that i will not say anything or  
or hate on you or um or judge you as a person 
if that's something that you want to do  
listen we're all adults here do what you need 
to do in order to be able to make yourself happy  
now the seventh one um type of filipina is the 
overtly flirty woman these are the person who  
just always loves attention um you know and 
so yes i i know a lot of filipinos just you  
know philippines is the selfie capital of the 
world that filipinos love taking photos taking  
videos of themselves dancing looking sexy um but 
what i'm talking about just flirting is it's not  
just taking those photos that's perfectly fine 
just posting those videos that's perfectly fine  
but when you when they're actively um you know 
on their feed and like flirting with people and  
saying thank you so much or you look you look good 
too to a guy or maybe you guys go out in a bar  
or club and stuff like that and you know she's 
the good-looking girl and everybody's just all up  
on there just trying to get her attention you 
know and she's leaving you behind you don't want  
a girl who's over flirtatious with other people 
so you want to be able to stay away from that  
number eight are the lazy people there are you 
know filipinos are hard working people it's just  
ingrained in their culture i mean you know 
if you're from the united states you know  
which i am from and you know you know a lot 
of the hispanic and latin communities you know  
especially from mexico you know they will cross 
that border even if they have to be illegally  
doing that in order to be able to work 
and provide for the family the filipinos  
i always say is like the mexicans of the world 
because filipinos will fly into any country  
they don't mind staying there illegally 
so that they can actually work and provide  
for their families and you know a lot of filipinos 
sometimes live outside the country to work  
as domestic helpers and don't even see their 
family for years just so that they can provide for  
their kids for their husbands and you know their 
wives happens all the time but yes you are gonna  
come across some filipinas that are also lazy 
as heck right and that's the last thing that you  
want is a lazy person because if they're lazy 
just in life because what they're going to be  
lazy in the bedroom they're going to be lazy in 
the house taking care of chores i'm not saying  
that they should be the only person doing chores 
at home you should help out too if you actually  
have a real relationship but you need to stay away 
from some of the lazy filipinas out there because  
there's a lot of them too and just because they 
look sexy and cute laying down there looking good  
that does not mean that you should go for that as 
well right so stay away from the lazy filipinas  
the ninth type of filipino should avoid dating are 
you know these are just the mean people right to  
service people um so i used to do this this thing 
i heard i remember i read this thing and actually  
i said you know this tip and so what you would 
do is pay attention to the person you're with  
and when you go on a date and see how they are 
towards service people like you know i purposely  
look at that and pay attention so if a girl is 
like you know making fun of the service people  
the server or treating them badly or giving them 
attitude especially on the first date or second  
date or third date you know right there alone if a 
person is mean to service people imagine how they  
are going to be with family with friends with kids 
okay so really pay attention to that it's it's  
you know it's one of those precursors where you 
see somebody is just a real mean person you know  
and so when you see that i would literally say 
walk away or say you know what i can't do this  
now those are the nine types of filipinos that you 
should avoid dating but i'm going to share with  
you guys an extra one this is the bonus type of 
filipino and this is the filipina who may be aware  
that you have a girlfriend for now but she's 
willing to interject herself or trying to  
flirt with you to kind of make you leave 
your current girlfriend your current wife  
for her these are the girls that you need 
to stay away from right because guess what  
if she did it with you just imagine her type 
of personality the type of person that she is  
right like i i've always referenced this one 
joke about chris rock where he says when a  
woman when a man sees a man with a great woman 
he says i need to get me a woman just like that  
when a woman sees another ma another woman with a 
great man she says i need to get him right so you  
have to understand these type of aggressive women 
you know are a bad seed and you should stay away  
from dating so i hope this video kind of helped 
you guys out with the different types of women  
or filipinas that you should actually avoid dating 
let's go over to the 10 of them one money focus  
anger issues not great a conversation alcoholic 
or into drugs is greedy super jealous bar girls  
30 girls lazy girls the people that are mean 
to service people and lastly a girl that  
pretty much is willing to be your mistress 
almost or your side chick to try to get you to  
convert to her and leave your current girlfriend 
behind right so make sure you pay attention to  
that all right so i hope this video helped you 
guys out once again our goal here is to help  
a bunch of foreigners and expats like myself who 
moved over here to the philippines we're planning  
to move here to philippines or just come visit 
here to be able to find your wife your and your
