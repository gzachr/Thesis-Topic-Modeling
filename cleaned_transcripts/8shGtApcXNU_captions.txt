according to google translate it says
so i want to learn more tagalog and that's 
what this video is about 99 of the viewers of  
the channel are filipinos diba i made a goal for 
myself to start learning uh more tagalog this year
do i say that correctly but i definitely want 
to try i feel excited about it to every vlog  
that i make talk a little bit more tagalog you 
know a few words few sentences here and there  
a little bit of taglish diba i know that 
filipinos are very good in english that is  
always easy when i go to the philippines you know 
can still converse in english but i do want to  
converse more in the native 
language in tagalog because  
in that way i can also learn more about the 
culture right and it's always nice to speak to um  
people in the country in their own language i 
think that it's really something that is a nice  
experience so i will do my best to be honest i'm 
still a little bit struggling with the language  
uh at the same time i really want to go 
for it you know and make it a goal to  
really uh speak the language so by the way 
i'm uh driving in rotterdam the netherlands  
so what tagalog do i know so far um 
i know kotse i know sapatos i know
those kind of sentences you know words and small 
sentences i know but i want to really level up a  
little bit and um so that i can converse you 
know and have a real conversation in tagalog  
that would be really amazing you will see the 
the journey you know on pinoy planet you will  
see me learning more tagalog and also put it 
into practice i hope it will all work out well  
and i will do my best so that i 
can um really become better in the  
language of the philippines sandalia sandali ha i 
need to make it so it's the next day and we have  
a lunch here this is a typical dutch lunch so how 
do i say lunch in tagalog so this is my tanghalian  
fries and a burger so kain na tayo let's eat
