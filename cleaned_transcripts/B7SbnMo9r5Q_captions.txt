[Music] thank you
[Music] [Applause]
hello everyone again welcome back to my YouTube
channel my name is ivani so today I'm going
to try the Jollibee here in the Philippines
so I have tried the Jollibee in the Malaysia
but I heard the one in Philippines still the
best well let's see [Music]
thank you [Music] can I have one C3 and I
want palabo uh one Buko pie and then one chocolate
Sandy foreign
[Applause]
[Music]
now I'm waiting for my orders so I'm so excited
to try I wonder how it tastes like the one
compared to the one the one in Malaysia let's
see [Music]
finally my Jollibee food is here so for those
who don't know actually Jollibee is originated
here in the Philippines and for what I know
Jollibee has more than thousands of branches
and franchise around the world so anyways
let's see what I have ordered here so I have
my favorite chicken Joy thank you yay next
one I have the joy spaghetti and we also have
this young Burger it's cute Yum Burger next
one we have this palabok this one they don't
have it in Malaysia okay and also we have
this book Pie this one also they don't they
still don't have it in Malaysia yet maybe
they will consider it in the future but Malaysia
have the peach mango pie and also actually
I I ordered the chocolate sundae but it's
not available at the moment so never mind
and the last one we have this famous pineapple
juice let's eat
[Music]
foreign
[Music] right now let's just dig into this
Jollibee orders one by one so I'll start with
the chicken Joy first since I love fried chicken
so let's try the chicken first look at that
wow
okay let's try this
I can feel the spicy and also the it's very
crunchy it's nice
by the way guys this is how we eat Jollibee
here instead of the chili sauce we need to
dig deep in in the gravy like this yay so
nice
shut up by the way um the one in Malaysia
I mean the gravy the Jollibee gravy in Malaysia
is very limited you cannot request like as
much as you want but the one in Philippines
you can request more or maybe unlimited I
think yeah and also the gravy here is more
thicker as you can see the texture is more
thicker compared to the Malaysia it's very
thick so the Malaysia one is a little bit
watery yeah so yeah I think it's the best
one is still in the Philippines I think guys
if you guys know me so well um I actually
don't really like spaghetti because you know
the origin spaghetti in from Italy is like
sour because they have tomato right but the
one in Philippines is actually very special
because uh the spaghetti in the Philippines
is the sauce I mean it's like more to Sweet
type I think it's because the people here
in the Philippines they love like spicy uh
sorry I mean like they love sweet so they
make it like the spaghetti sauce is sweet
as you can see they have sausage here and
also have some like cheese on the top
it's gonna mix it first and then let's eat
it together thank you
wow look at that okay let's try the spaghetti
and compare to the one in Malaysia okay this
is a lot
[Music]
the sauce here in the Philippines is really
so good converted to Malaysia yeah it's so
nice I don't know it just stays so delicious
here
I love and I feel like the sauce also more
thicker right so nice
this is the only favorite yeah this is the
only spaghetti that I love because the spaghetti
sauce literally the spaghetti sauce is sweet
yeah since I don't like something that's too
soury as in spaghetti so this is but this
one is exceptional
[Music]
thank you
so next one I want to try this all about uh
this menu they don't have it in Malaysia because
they need to make it Hollow this one is contains
Park as you can see here there's some pork
floss or pork cracklings and also they have
this small shrimp a few pieces of small shrimp
and egg and then I don't know what sauce is
this so let me try later and review it to
you and the last one we have this uh calamansi
or like so let's try all right so we need
to add this for more flavor the slime into
our palabok
okay then that's how you eat it you need to
mix it all together
yeah so nice
I'm so curious about this one because they
don't have it in Malaysia I wonder how it
tastes
so let's try you can smell the light so fresh
it's nice
so special this flavor I think I never eat
it anywhere so far
hmm
and I can taste the sourness a little bit
[ __ ] up the lime
oh yeah I'm so excited and I forgot to drink
all right let's try this pineapple juice
it's nice
so refreshing
wow
sorry a little messy
thank you
okay let's try the Yum Burger
all right this one they have it in Malaysia
so if you guys are from Malaysia you guys
can try if you guys never try it so this is
the Yum Burger looks like with the cheese
yeah and some yeah that's it so let's try
I think it's slightly different the one compared
to the one kale
nice
look at that
problems
shut up shut up definitely definitely better
the one in the Philippines
all right let's try our pie for dessert
okay foreign
means
coconut so it's a coconut pie this one they
don't have in Malaysia but Malaysia have the
peach mango pie the fish mango pie quite not
bad you guys can try it so I want to try the
one this one the Boko pie okay let's try it
wow foreign this looks very nice okay this
is how it looks like guys it's just so crunchy
and fresh
[Music] so crunchy look at that these are
actual coconut meat inside the pie wow
I can taste the coconut meat
it's kind of like melt in your mouth look
at that because the coconut is juicy
