hello and welcome to couples Quest we're
Matt and Danielle and today we have
something very special planned we're
going waterfall hopping in Cebu
Philippines
the waterfalls and the Philippines have
truly blown us away they are so
impressive not just in sheer size and
scale but the color of the water too we
have never seen waterfalls this blue
anywhere else in the world
we have a bunch of incredible waterfalls
to take off today so let's get to it
[Music]
we're made some new friends
[Music]
we're at inambakan Falls look how
amazing it is
there's a few people here we got up
bright and early we left mobile
yeah it's crazy beautiful so this is the
biggest waterfall of I think five years
and this is probably the most popular
one I don't think as many
and then head on
[Music]
taking enough photos and videos
of the waffle so now it's time
because I'm jumping in
it's not the easiest to get to see how
Danielle does
you okay
I made it
[Music]
that guy's showing us away
[Music]
foreign
thank you
[Music]
so that's the first level of in them
back and I think I've said it right I
probably didn't remember and that's the
first level there's five in total so
we'll see how many we get to but at the
very least we're gonna go to number two
guys
oh Rose she's gonna take our bags there
because I noticed that there's one way
here but there's a little cave and she
said it's like a Hidden Gem that you can
still that you can go through so
it's gonna go exploring
oh this is so cool
foreign
[Music]
thank you
ready three two one
[Music]
[Applause]
put this down yeah
crazy man absolutely crazy that's level
number two Tick Tock and now we're
heading for number three
another good waterfall day
it really is
[Music]
so yeah don't think as many people come
up past even the first waterfall Rose
was telling us that it's basically only
foreigners that come up this far and so
far since level one we haven't seen
anyone but it's super beautiful with
highly advised checking out the other
four this one is like a little like two
Little Rock pools and it's the water is
still clear and beautiful and you
literally get it to yourself it's it's
Paradise
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
that was waterfall number four
now just one more left number five and
again really short walk to number five
there's a couple of places where you can
jump and one of them is even a jump back
down into number four so that should be
pretty fun Danielle made a good point
just now
everyone talks about the islands in
Philippines
but even somewhere like Cebu the views
the mountains
the palm trees just the nature in
general
is just amazing
we absolutely love it we really took our
time working our way up the various
levels in and back and forth and a small
group caught up with us at the end but
there's plenty of room for us all in
this natural Paradise
oh good
[Music]
okay so the only way into five is to do
that jump that you just did and now
we're working our way back to jump back
into four
Danielle's struggling
together
I don't know what it is
[Music]
[Music]
Hello friends waiting for us
[Music]
[Music]
foreign Falls
and we're gonna have a little track
apparently it's very Scenic so I'm
really excited for this one yeah looks I
mean already there's some amazing views
um it was
200 pesos per person entry fee and then
20 pesos for the bike and that's 200
pesos includes like maintenance fee for
the Falls
um
money for the local Village and a guide
so yeah we're gonna go explore more
waterfalls oh yeah and obviously
included in that fee is also these
trusty helmets
it takes around 30 minutes to get to Dow
Falls you walk across this beautiful
bamboo Bridge through streams over
slippery rocks and various steps it kind
of reminded us of a smaller version of
canyoneering at kawasan Falls
the nature hair is phenomenal you can't
help but stop and stare at the beauty
all around you as you make your way
through the jungle and that blue water
again how is it this blue everywhere you
look in the Philippines

Little Steps now
[Music]
we were quite surprised halfway along
the track when we turned around and saw
a friendly little dog joining us we
named him Jerry
wow look at this
you made it a lot of people
so it'd be good to come here first thing
but I wasn't driving that hour and a
half again
and it's still beautiful
[Applause]
[Music]

Jerry loved the waterfalls just as much
as we did
[Music]

waterfalls and stunning natural scenery
