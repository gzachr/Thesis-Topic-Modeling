Mabuhay hey guys it's tristan and today I'm going 
to be reacting to Michelle Dee’s interview with  
boy abunda after Miss Universe so guys in the 
past I’ve seen past miss universe Philippines  
winners like Catriona Gray and Pia Wurtzbach on 
this show but the reason why I'm so interested  
in this one is because after miss universe 
Filipinos were so angry many of them they  
were saying that Michelle dee was robed and had 
to be in that top five and generally I'm sure  
that in this show they are going to address 
that so that's why I want to react to this  
because I have a lot to say also and I want 
to hear things from Michelle dee’s this own  
point of view yeah so let's get right into it.
I am a l for words for all that but here I am  
so overwhelming I did not expect it but 
you know hard work really pays off that  
I'm just so glad all of you saw that
I can't speak Filipino but I'm going  
to try seriously they one as to make sure 
that I give 200 300% of my fight whatever  
I can afford to give and to really show all 
of you and I'm glad that you all saw that all  
the effort like hope I made you all proud that’s 
not the ending we wanted but everything happened
Michelle did you get into the top 20 because 
you deserved to be there or did you get into  
the top 20 because you topped the fan vote? 
Um if I got into the top 20 because of the  
fan vote that would have been announced but 
what came to my attention was I got it through  
Merit that's why they didn’t announce
So guys I want to say something before  
they continue. At miss universe I always hear 
them say vote for your favorite to enter the  
top 20 but on the finals night they 
don’t always announce who won the fan  
vote they just announce the top 20 so it’s so 
confusing personally I think michelle dee even  
if it was not fan vote, she deserved it 
but let me hear what they have to say
what was that I know Salvador apologized Universe
okay I mean all I know is that kind of came during  
like right after I didn't make the top five and 
I was trying to compose my thoughts my feelings  
and then I saw the post and that obviously kind 
of messes with your head the wait what happened  
but of course you know I mentioned this in 
my broadcast channel I said I wish we lived  
in a perfect world but we don’t and as much as 
there shouldn't be room for error there was and  
ultimately we just had to leave it the destiny 
they're not going to change results it's not  
the steve Harvey moment as much as wanted to be 
in the top five I was prepared for the top five  
it wasn't my destiny to be part of that they 
apologized they said it was just an honest  
mistake and I choose to just want 
to accept that instead of live my  
life full of this what if and curiosity I 
really have no choice but to accept that
the Philippines was robbed, I want to get your 
feelings i I want to get your thoughts uh do you  
think you were robed of the top 5? I would rather 
choose to say I believe I was prepared for the top  
fire um I don't know what I could have changed 
I gave 100% of myself that gown that iconic gown
because the swimsuit gets you to the 
top 10 the gown gets you to the top 5 um  
I again as much as I want to say that I 
deserve to be there it wasn't my destiny
the just asking this because this is one 
everybody wants to ask I know I mean you know  
for Q and A is what I trained for the hardest
generally according to me for that top five  
honestly my mind was like Philippines had to be 
there mcihelle dee had to be there I have no idea  
why michelle dee was not there seriously I'm still 
bit sad but generally things happen seriously it's  
not just her time and like I said before in my 
life reaction for the top five if there were  
there because the judges choose so they deserve it 
yeah the judges picked them so for Michelle dee I  
think so far top 10 is something big seriously, 
personally I also wish she was in the top five  
but I'm so happy that shes accepting it, it 
was destiny it was meant to happen although  
she trained for q and a the hardest but things 
happen yea so I’m happy with the way shes talking
my loss in 2022 really reinforced the feeling 
that you should never celebrate until the crown  
is on your head that's why I never manifested 
that I am who is going home with the crown I  
just wanted to give 100% of myself really show the 
whole universe what the Philippines has to offer
yeah philippines awesome so awesome philippines
now not a lot of people are complaining 
that she won, the beef here is  
that Philippines did not make the top 5
exactly that's true I think is true because 
personally I have no issues with Nicaragua  
winning I think she was deserving 
she's a good mom she's so gorgeous  
she's perfect seriously the problem 
now is that Michelle dee was not in  
the top five personally I'm not I'm not 
complaining a lot like it does hot hurt  
me the way it hurts Filipinos seriously so 
but I agree with what they are saying here  
seriously Nicaragua winning we are not upset but 
Philippines not in the top five that’s the issue
how close are you to miss Thailand? We actually 
kicked off a really good friendship one of the  
best things in pageantry is meeting you 
know me little girls amazing girls just  
like-minded persons and it just so 
happens up me and thailand me and  
Anntonia actually got to get to know each 
other we have a lot of things in common
but guys seriously Michelle and Anntonia 
like I just love them so much they're  
so gorgeous they are queens that I've Loved 
ive reacted to them here I love them so much  
and then thai people support me Filipinos 
also support me so generally Michelle and  
Antonia I just love their friendship so 
much their friendship the moments like at  
Miss universe it was really something seriously 
I think they were the best friend group at Miss  
universe according to me because they were just 
over the top seriously I just love them so much  
you call each other mummy and daddy … we kind 
of just picked up on let's leave out let's talk  
about the special awards voice for change 
award the spirit of carnival award I read  
a statement of how proud your sponsor is about 
you the fan vote the best national costume award
for the national costume winner I don't think it's 
a good thing that they announce the winner after  
the contest seriously I mean because the hype is 
over the contest is over if they were doing that  
then that means they can also announce the new 
miss universe after the contest and I don't think  
it's good seriously and also guys Philippines 
winning the best personal costume I just feel  
like they announced this because Filipinos were 
angry and all that so they wanted Filipinos to  
calm down in the way that's I feel seriously for 
other special awards like miss friendship miss  
photogenic and all that I think they can enter 
the top 20 but not the top five because yes you  
did so well you're the best but in general when 
you combine everything together like swimsuit,  
evening gown, question and answer you are not the 
best so I think special awards should enter the  
top 20 and not the top five I love it this 
is my concept brought to life by Micheel I  
yeah I love the costume the costume was gorgeous 
first foremost I'm just so happy for Michael the  
third best national costume for the Philippines 
congratulations but at the same time I don’t know  
why it was announced late maybe because of voting 
and tabulating but I’m just happy to be the winner
what she was saying to Philippines they 
were doing some photo shoot and all that  
I was so angry with that seriously miss anne 
like she is the owner of miss universe but  
sometimes is irritating the way she was talking to 
Michelle and all that I did not feel comfortable  
that seriously I'm just happy that Michelle took 
things calmly she just smiled at the camera and  
left I don't like the way she's talking about I 
don't know the way she's talking guys the way she  
does I don't just I don't like it seriously she 
wants everything to be about her miss anne jkn and  
anyways let's continue seriously I don’t have much 
to say I have a lot to say but not here seriously
before you ask the question whatever 
that is I just wanna say that this  
is just fun … we know it's for fun we 
know we know yeah but I want to hear  
how she’s going to answer if you could spend 
one year in another woman’s shoes who would  
you choose and why? if I could choose ….. she's an 
amazing symbol of cultural preservation she's is  
an amazing symbol of .. she has been defying 
boundaries stereotypes and that is something  
that I have tried to inspire everybody around 
the world which is to own your unique story own  
your Traditions love where you came from love 
who youre with who you're surrounded with and  
truly with that unique store you can make your 
country proud you can show the universe what  
your country has to offer in my case my love for 
my country can really shake the whole universe
guys you see right she said everything 
she was fast yeah but at the same time  
she was talking I understood love for Country 
talking about the woman breaking stereotypes  
all stereotyoes aging and she still had ten extra 
seconds I just feel that I just feel that if she  
was in that top five she could move to the 
top three and who knows seriously who knows  
guys who knows I'm so Happy with michelle 
right now I can't lie like she owns it
you know right after prelims competition ive 
been training for parsarela for a while thank …
by the way guys I also like the fact that 
when any question comes up or when she's  
talking about something she be like thank you so 
much this person thank you to this thank you to  
this like giving credits to all those who helped 
her and her team I like that so much seriously  
I love giving credits I love appreciating 
others and I like if I'm also appreciated  
so I love that so much about Michelle she's so 
thoughtful and I think it's a really good thing
guys when I saw the gown my body was like 
go watch my reaction seriously go watch my  
reaction go watch my videos all Michelle’s 
stage moments, they were over the top 
that idea the inspiration the amazing 
groundbreaking I know cuz I said it so  
many times this gown would be iconic and it 
is this is honestly I was so nervous when  
were call top 10 cuz in my head I was like how 
am I really seeing this gown worth celebrating
how because generally the gown was iconic the gown 
is good but if you don't make that top 10 nobody  
would see the gown its frustrating at some point 
seriously and personally I really wanted to see  
Cameroon’s gown at the top 10 seriously its 
so sad I heard that she was overall 11 I don't  
know if that's true or not but I was really 
looking forward to seeing cameroons gown at  
miss universe finals night but anyways I'm so 
happy that we placed for the first time in the  
top 20 so yeah thank you so muchyou’re your 
support to miss Cameroon we appreciate a lot
what about the move on Thailand
I mean quite frankly I think miss  
universe is essentially alive because 
because of the supporters because of  
everybody they're so passionate hey 
even though she might not have had  
bad intentions the way it was executed 
that could have been better um I frankly  
think that always a better way to be more 
respectful to the fans of course so that it  
just done with it I try to see the best \
she talking good about people that’s good
oh my
God they should invite me please 
they should invite me too seriously
Guys look at michelle’s 
brother, he’s hot seriously he’s 
And he’s wearing shorts you see 
it’s not a bad thing to wear shorts

do have black rider coming up of course
