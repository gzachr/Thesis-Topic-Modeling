hi guys! this is Montebello Villa hotel
in Cebu City and we are going to stay
here for a couple of days with my family
to go to Oslo to do the whale shark
experience. I must say this hotel has
quite its charm with its elegantly
decorated lobby friendly staff great
amenities such as entertainment
facilities for the young and older kids,
swimming pools and Wellness Center
and I must say it's go to wedding venue.
We saw two wedding receptions during our
stay
Their rooms are spacious it's fairly
decent-sized for a family of four and
during our stay we were hoping to get a
really nice garden view but this will
suffice.
The kids love the pool.
And we were also enjoying our stay but
of course we're supposed to go to Oslob until
Since our tour has already been paid for in
advance we could not cancel and so my
husband decided to go ahead anyway and
joined his sister and her family
Thankfully he's still filmed so let's
have a look.
(music plays)
That was a treat wasn't it?
Too bad my boys and I missed it.
And another thing we missed that I didn't
even know was part of the tour was a
little foot spa by the Tumalog waterfall.
Eh foot spa care of little fishies which is
actually a variety of toothless carp and
what they do is they nibble dead skin
off your feet.
And here is the Tumalog waterfall.
A lot of people say that this waterfall is
so magnificent it felt like it came
straight out of a movie. Have you heard
of Avatar? This video though does not do
it justice.
So sad to have missed this tour but all
the more reason to go back and it was
really sweet of the tour guide to send
us some love. Thank you!
Hi to those people who are staying in the hotel. Merry christmas!
I love you. I wish you were here. But they're having fun. I'm sending my love from Oslob to the Montebello resort.
Magandang araw. Salamat po. Salamat po. Mabuhay Philippines!
