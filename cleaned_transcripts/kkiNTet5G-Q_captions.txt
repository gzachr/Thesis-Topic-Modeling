like you don't want to do anything and
you're kind of sad all the time
you just want to lay down on your back
like oh yeah you don't want to eat
anything
that yeah i had that moment because
you know as a contract worker

i think he was a little confused at the
time because i'm not the kind of person
yeah i usually move a lot in the house i
can't just sit
or i can't take a nap like i had to do...
did you just burp???
omg... That smell so bad
I was trying to stop it but
sorry Lol
the second question is how did we
resolve it
we take our time a little bit and
like sleep even though we can't sleep
and
the other morning like one of us go and
hug the other person then it's all
good it is all over. yeah, so in short
we resolve it by LOVE

so, for the final question
2014 january starting from that day i
was working as a contract worker in
korean restaurant
and here in canada yeah here in canada
for of course yeah here in canada
and i was the only
worker at some point and
our owner hired one more
worker from abroad that was roy
it is really funny how it started
because we used to hate each other
at first it's not love at first sight, it was
hate at first sight
tell them why. as i said
i was the only worker in the kitchen
so i was kinda under pressure
to make him learn fast and you know the
koreans they
we love everything fast yeah she's in
short she's she's the one assigned to
train me
and i'm the only filipino guy there at
the time i wasn't
so good at english i know that i'm not
so good right now but before
i couldn't even speak it like this. So it
was kind of hard to teach him
and for sure he couldn't understand me.
i guess? and when he can't understand he
just turned
back on me so i get mad at him
yeah you did that you basically turned
back on me
and then looked the other side like i
was telling you
hey i'm not done yet here yeah so
oh hey roy! so i have to bring him back
here and then
you have to do this like this like that
okay? Lol
you know there's another reason why i
hated her because
she always say this 'BABOYA'
so i was like she she didn't know that
my mom is fluent in korean. right?
i asked my mom what does this mean like
'Baboya'
So my mom said oh it means
idiot i was like what?!?!
I was so surprised so i was like
what
the this girl is really a
that is the start from that moment
because we really hated each other
but also we were the only people that we
can
like depend on it like help on each
other
yeah depend on each other like help each
other talk
each other sometimes when there's a
problem we can we have to solve of
each other like if you have
questions about the job
and i have to make him understand like
so
basically we spend whole time together
full day
whole weeks together so yeah
so after that we became like
good friends really close after a few
months
he came to our job we also hired another
filipino girl
as a contract worker one day after a few
few months the girl said that roy likes
me
in front of all of us
yeah she did. You don't remember?? we were pilling off the shrimp.
yeah she said uh that he likes
me but he didn't say anything so and
i don't know how what to express myself
so how do you express yourself yeah how
to express myself
so because i i didn't feel anything more
than friend
at the time so i didn't know what to do
but
he didn't say anything so that happened
and that ended just like that nothing
happened nothing
happened
and then yeah i thought my turn
so i think i remember that so i went to
my brother's house
i went to visit him christmas day and
then
she said that i called her i don't
remember it he was so
drunk yeah i was so drunk and then
because i was i think
i already it's not love like
oh it's not love
he said it's not love but he was like 'Jinny~ jinny~' 
and after he came back
something happened that i can't remember
too
yeah i mean it was the new year's day
because
it's a new year's our first new year's
day
and then like a group of our
uh workers and a group of my friends
workers
we were went out the chicken wing place
because they had a new year's
party or something they called a band
and then singing like a
celebration yeah so after work we all
met in that bar and i i was so
drunk .oh yes it's her turn though,
I got drunk
christmas and she got really drunk
new year's eve i was really durnk. i can't remember.
Here's the catch guys
so i was surprised.omg Jinny is so drunk.
where's Jinny?? i was looking for
her
and at that time i really like her right
so
so i want to be like my eyes always on
her
because there might be some guys like
come on bro
don't come near to this girl we're not
together right
i'm being possessive so
i couldn't find her on that bar inside
that bar so
and then suddenly i saw her on the
parking lot because
just here's the bar you know there's a
parking and there's a lot of drunk guys
outside
new year's yeah yeah i went outside and
i saw her in this
rack just like there's a parking lot and
there's a rack
where you put your supermarket cart
you're sitting there i was like what the
hell happened to her
so i went there and i ran
and then i went i was asking you
hey are you okay? are you okay?  and then
she was like this
this is what happened okay
she was like this opened her eyes she's
basically sleeping there she was sitting
down like this
so drunk and then the moment i went there
And then I asked her. 'hey, are you okay?'
omg she gave me the look like
I was like..
did I like that????
Oh my god. Jinny what's happening to you
And then suddenly she Kissed me
how did i kiss you? like how???
so it's it's a baby kiss
so i'm like
bro i was like oh my god you know that i like
you
are you playing with my feelings
right now? like what are you doing now
i confirmed that oh my god she likes me
because she kissed me
but at that time i was i was confused
still
confused right so so what i did was okay
i'm going to level up let's do this
i'm going to make lego
yeah so after she returned, returned from that trip
to korea we made it official
i made a video like asking her. it's
so sweet video
And he prepared the ring that
is little big
yeah we have coupling we still have we
still have it but we don't wear it
anywhere because it was so old it's
already good
no because Roy got a injured. If you know my youtube
channel there's a video that
had an accident so that he can't wear a
ring
and i was wearing a ring by myself and
then
now it doesn't mean anything because
since i'm the only one
so we decided to take it off and then
uh like last year when he proposed to me
he bought a ring for me that's that's
the ring i have
now yeah but i'm not wearing it i know
you guys are a lot of you guys still
questioning why i'm not wearing a ring
because it's a real diamond so i don't
really wear
every day but i do wear when we go
date. yeah that's that's like how we met
how we started and where we started
yeah so uh again we would like to say
