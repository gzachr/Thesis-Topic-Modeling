We hope that our food can offer a 
new perspective for Filipino food,  
but remind you of the food that maybe 
other people have grown up with.
I'm Geri. And I'm Ethan. And we are 
the owners of Baon Kainan.  
Baon Kainan is a Filipino comfort food food cart. We do our 
own spin on Filipino food while still paying  
homage to the food that we grew up with. The first 
part, "baon" is a Filipino concept of taking food  
on a journey with you and then "kainan" means 
eatery, so together, Baon Kainan is to-go Filipino food.  
Our food might not be the same as what you grew 
up with, but it is an expression of what we grew up  
with being Filipino Americans. We do chicken adobo. 
We also do a mushroom adobo as a vegetarian, vegan  
option. What we do is a little different and 
kind of a cheffy take on adobo. So instead  
of soy sauce we use tamari. We also smoke 
the tamari ourselves to just give that extra  
depth of flavor so to speak into the adobo 
sauce. Rather than water we use chicken  
stock that we make in-house as well. With all the 
aromatics that go in it, we blend it all together  
and thicken it so it's more of a mouth 
feel and it sticks to the chicken better.
Chicken with garlic, kare kare fries, salad and a bibingka. We work well together because he will take his cheffy techniques and  
what he's learned being in the culinary industry. 
But because I've learned just on my own and have  
done home cooking, I kind of help with and just 
making sure you know it's still an approachable  
dish and something that everybody will enjoy 
just as much as we enjoy it. And so I guess I
put the homey twist on it. Our goal is to really 
just spread that awareness of Filipino food and  
Filipino culture. We're just grateful to be here 
because there are a lot of amazing food carts  
and food establishments here. We hope that people 
come visit us and see what Filipino food is about.
