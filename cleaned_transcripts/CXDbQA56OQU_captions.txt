She was convicted of being an accessory
to murder for which she got 50 years
and what he said was that
she got out of prison because
they paid to someone important
and he was just telling us 
that if you have money
you can get anything here...
Damian: We're in the 
mountains on Mindanao.
Damian: Near the city of Cagayan de Oro.
We arrived here yesterday from Tagbilaran.
Damian: We're starting 
our journey with Mindanao.
Damian: We will move
every two-three days to some other
places and show you what this
dangerous island looks like.
Damian: We try not to stay in one
place in plain sight for too long.
And in general, we hope
they won't kill us there.
[A day earlier...]
Damian: The tradition here is that
they fish out the coins.
Damian: We're looking for a car.
Damian: We encountered a cannon
from ropes.
Damian: Guys are after work.
Damian: They helping.
Damian: They fished out the money earlier.
Damian: Listen guys, it doesn't ends here.
Damian: We drive about two minutes here.
Damian: And here goes 
a large group of people,
some students.
Damian: Mario, a homeowner from Bohool,
said there is some kind of school here
with 30,000 people.
Damian: Perhaps they are 
the ones who are going now.
[We're going to boarding house 
which I shown you in last episode]
Damian: To Cagayan de Oro we arrived about
seven o'clock a.m.
Damian: We sailed at ten 
o'clock from Tagbilaran
so we were on the boat all night.
Damian: The first thing we did was
go looking for a
place to stop.
Damian: On the ship we 
booked two nights in a hotel but
we noticed that the place did not suit us
so we concluded that we 
had to look for something else.
Damian: And we managed to
find a new place.
Damian: A boarding house
which you already 
seen in the last episode.
Here sometimes it is not easy 
to find a place to stop because
if there are some companies here,
they often do not give addresses.
Here there are often no street 
names, no house numbers.
The post office operates 
on the principle that
they know
where a
neighborhood is and who lives where.
That's the principle on which it works.
I have always received packages
from "Lazada" or such Philippine "Allegro"
where the address was inaccurate,
there was no street name, house number.
Instead, it was written a third
house from the left with a white gate.
Also, it's just as an aside.
We found this boarding 
house, we agreed that
if we spend two days in the hotel
we will return here.
Damian: We went to the hotel 
to leave our stuff.
And then we went to the market.
Very briefly guys, I'd like to tell you
about the "SurfShark" app
that people need to mask
what they are doing on the net.
I mean, people who want to mask
what they are doing on the net.
And in my opinion, everyone should do it
because why should these
things bubble up somewhere later.
To hackers or anyone else.
Nowadays there is a lot of technology to
steal data, to steal
payment card information
and online information in general.
Also, if anyone would like to
increase their security,
especially surfing on the web,
protect own data,
protect own payment cards
then the "SurfShark" app
helps a lot.
Regarding payment cards.
If we are in a place
where we use public WiFi
then it's not so secure anymore for
payments, but if we use
the option that "SurfShark VPN" gives -
- masking all data -
- then we are safe.
The second thing is that
when we are in a country
and we want to watch on Netflix
some movies, programs
from another country
that are shown only in that country,
we don't have this possibility
until we change our IP address
to that country, which is
what "SurfShark VPN" also makes possible.
Damian: Besides, there are
many apps for example
for transferring money where
a person who travels
and visits different
countries where there are
various online restrictions...
Online restrictions in the sense that
this app in a particular
country does not work.
Damian: Then what do we do?
Then we simply
change the IP address
and we are already
online in another country
and this is thanks to "SurfShark VPN"
and the app then already works.
You have the link to download
the app below this video.
If you enter "Ucieczka do Raju"
when signing up,
you will have 3 months
for free, really worth it,
let's back to the video.
Damian: First impressions 
when it came to the city
of Cagayan de Oro are very positive.
Damian: Especially people.
Damian: There are a lot 
more products, too.
Damian: In this market you 
can find a lot of vegetables,
fruits, people.
Damian: You can go to such a night market
when the sun goes 
down because it's a bit cooler
even though it's also hot at night.
Damian: But it's much more pleasant.
Damian: You can practically 
buy anything there.
From clothes, used shoes -
- they often sell them.
Damian: We're buying 
watermelons, he cut for us.
Damian: Behind there's security
guard, who's sitting on hammock.
Damian: You can see better now.
Damian: He keeps an eye on cash machine.
Damian: Interesting task, eh?
Damian: After staying in the 
market, we went to the party
that evening.
[The next day - 
Exploring the mountains...]
Damian: Here there are 
a lot of mines on this island
and what you see are mines too.
Damian: There are 
copper mines, gold mines,
I don't know if they are legal,
because gold mines are illegal for sure.
Damian: It's unlikely that 
we'll not be able to find
anyone with whom 
we can discuss this topic.
Damian: But, we'll track it.
Damian: In any case, there are a lot of
natural resources here and
they are extracting them.
The person you saw just now
is the person we met at the market.
He approached us
and started asking where 
we were from and so on.
He said he has lived in the city
on Mindanao 16 years.
What he was talking about
was...
Maybe from the beginning, 
because it's a short story.
He told us
that he had here five wifes,
and three houses 
and everything he got lost.
And that story he was telling us
it was his
wife who was...
How it says?
Let the cameraman help me, 
what was the word?
Not "suspect" but...
We both have memory lapses, wait guys.
She was not prosecuted
but was
convicted of being an accessory to murder
and got 50 years.
And what he said was that
he got out of jail 
because they paid someone
important and mentioned that if
you have money you can 
get everything done with it.
I wish I had taken a contact to him
because I think we could have 
done a nice interview with him.
But we were in a hurry 
because the sun was going down
and I still wanted to record in the market
and didn't think about it.
That guy even though he was a bit strange
must have had an interesting story
and rich experiences but
unfortunately we are 
unlikely to hear it again.
Damian: In such places where tourists
don't normally come
 it's always
a big action, a big 
action in the sense that
kids start running after us
and dominate
the shouting
they are excited that
some foreigners have come,
they ask millions of questions
and it's hard to get rid of them.
Damian: As I say, 
sometimes it's a lot of fun
nd sometimes I want some peace
to record something else
but it's impossible because 
there are 30 children who...
Damian: Someone is hitting some pot here.
Damian: There are 
30 kids running after you.
Damian: These kids asked 
millions of questions and
what is your Youtube channel
saying they would subscribe and asked
me to give them a lead.
Damian: So I went to the store and asked
for a pen and a piece of paper
and wrote the name of my channel and
Tikotka for these children.
Damian: We high-fived and left.
I've never beaten so 
many high fives in my life.
He asked me where we live.
Yesterday there was a miss contest.
You can see what went on there.
Damian: There was 
a really nice, cool party
right on the beach.
Damian: We were 
surprised that it was so well
organized because this district
looks not the richest, but
Filipinos are famous for
organizing events -
- today there will be a fiesta, 
yesterday there was a miss -
so it's done on a grand scale.
Damian: Before the event itself,
we talked a lot about
believing in yourself,
how to achieve your goals,
how to
push your manifestations forward,
what to do when doubt comes,
why doubt comes.
Damian: I recently read
online and it inspired me a lot
that God
works by faith
and Satan works by doubt.
And when a person doubts it is
under the influence of Satan precisely.
This can be interpreted metaphorically
as one prefers, but I actually
believe that it is so.
Damian: After such a half-hour 
conversation regarding
dealing with doubts,
because we are trying 
to deal with the rubber -
- because there's no address, no contact.
Damian: So what to do in such a situation?
Damian: After this conversation, 
we came to some specifics.
I'm not going to tell you 
now about our solution to this.
We found that we needed 
to build some kind of bridge
between doubt
and faith, so that we could 
jump from doubt to faith.
Damian: The continuation of our
 conversation was at the event,
in the sense that the 
presenter asked questions
to the candidates,
and at points asked them about
how to realize their dreams,
how to
believe in yourself,
to never give up.
I say to my friend:
Hey, I feel like in a dream,
like we have the answers 
to theses questions
we asked ourselves five minutes ago
and there is an answer to 
our questions right away and
great feeling of...
It's hard to describe, it doesn't matter.
I think you know what I mean.
Damian: Beauty contest were 
over, it was really fun,
nice party, they played music
until four in the morning.
Damian: Today is another day.
Damian: We got our first response from
someone about rubber.
Damian: So we're waiting for contact,
we've got an email so that's a good sign.
Damian: Earlier, we were looking 
for this place and this person,
but then we found nothing.
Damian: We were asking people, 
because the address is on Google Maps
but when you go there 
there is nothing.
Damian: There is no name of the street,
the name of this company is given,
but the company doesn't exists there.
From current matters at my place,
the car is at the mechanic's
and we are waiting for it to be repaired
so then we will pick it up 
and we will be more mobile
because at the moment 
we do not have a car.
So now we're just
staying in our neighborhood and here
we'll be recording the music video for
the first promo set
of the album called "Anty Przekaz" which
which is already delayed 
and I'm sorry for that.
That's all, and in the next episode
propably it will be Marawi
but I'm not entirely sure.
We're so excited about Marawi and
pray for us to be good there.
We're not scared, it's more excitement
but you know, it can be different.
 So...
