I was distracted when I came here
because of all the beautiful women you
could just about hand pick any woman you
want there's a big difference in the
modern
Filipino for under 1500 I have never
seen an angry Filipino they were
throwing fruit at me
hi please tell us where you're from and
how old you are lastly I spent most of
my life in Hawaii and
um I'm going on 87 87 years old you look
very healthy thank you I'm a clean liver
and I've been taking vitamins for 60
years
and I could exercise so I think that's
all part of it how long have you been
here in the Philippines
22 years on and off so what brought you
here initially why did you come to the
Philippines I had a Filipino wife
last night
we were living in Hawaii
and of course Hawaii is very expensive
so she said look why don't we move to
the Philippines because as you know I'm
from the Philippines so everything will
be cheaper we can build a house which we
did
so
we made the transition okay let
everything go and came here
lived and I loved it and you loved it
what do you love about the Philippines
specifically what kinds of things you
enjoy well I I like the tropics I've
always been in the tropics that was I
served in the military in the Royal Air
Force in the UK
for four years and that's what
introduced me to the beautiful weather
the beautiful country environment etc
etc you messaged your wife earlier are
you still married right now or no no
we've got a divorce after 10 years okay
and the reason we split up
is
I was distracted when I came here
because of all the beautiful women and
it can happen to anybody yeah speaking
of the beautiful woman uh what's it like
dating Filipinos compared to Hawaii is
there a big difference it absolutely
there's a big difference however
there's a big difference in the modern
Filipina now when I came here and let's
say around 22 years ago
super easy to meet Filipino women
but with cell phones and social media
and so on
that got in the way because as you
probably know yourself
it's no eye contact yeah
you can get you can Bang into them while
they're on their phone right yeah
whereas before you go to the mall
and you could just about hand-pick any
woman you want because there wasn't as
many foreigners
yeah they wanted to meet foreigners
because we were a novelty I see so it's
very very easy to meet the girl and very
nice respectable girls
and uh
now things are different with that
um
you can't just go hang out and even
walking around and all you can't really
form a quick relationship I understand
for those people that are looking to
form a proper long-lasting relationship
what are the best method for them to
meet Filipina do you think still well of
course on lioness than usual way right
if you meet somebody by chance
well that's it it is by chance because
in my opinion it doesn't happen often
yeah I think the best way is to get
introduced by something if you meet a
girl
and she's not doesn't seem right for you
because you have a sister do you have a
cousin who might be interested in
meeting them and those are vendors how
to reach someone else because a lot of
us want to meet a foreigner but
they just are holding back for some
reason yeah they're not talking about
just me oh God in general which is what
I hear from my friend
so
there's always tender and all the
unusual
online apps right so services or what
about these days are you seeing anyone
are you just single what are you doing I
don't know how to put it I do have a
visitor that prompts in to see me yeah
once or twice a week okay and we have an
arrangement
it works quite well
I've known this person for a few years
but now that she's
over the mark okay
I feel bad saying this I've kind of I've
kind of got a limit on
how old I would like
a person to be yes
I really have no reason to complain
because of my correct that looking at
the other way this is what I want true
so
um
what I have right now is is quite good
okay
but I have no intention of ever marrying
again
my marriage dissolved about 12 years ago
let's see
and
in between that I've had relationships
but not for marriage but I understand so
um
I really I didn't realize that this
would happen but I really really like
being on my own
because all those years
that was never really allowed
in between relationships it was just
like continuing you know okay so I never
really had a break the only break I
would have would be when I went
to fear and make an excuse myself
and that kind of worked
yeah man we need our freedom sometimes I
mean on all we need our own space so
it's understandable it's crucial and so
I've had a taste of that for actually
over a year okay and I'm so happy with
it being able to finally do whatever I
want without a complaint about anything
yeah and uh
I really like that and when I want to
meet somebody it's here it's easy for me
because I would really I have gathered a
few friends together
some are friends with benefits that's it
so that kind of keeps me going
interesting so what about like health
issues health problems many people are
concerned that the Philippines doesn't
have the you know the systems or the
capability to meet their health needs
that's an excellent question because
it's a tremendous issue and
even people here have died
of their sickness okay because
especially some local people because
don't have the money and whatever
disease they have
they'll just live with it hoping
it'll go away yeah or some family member
will offer to pay the medical expenses
so this is even myself it can hit me
anytime yeah fortunately I live very
very well I live cleans
and I I watch my vitamin intake
and I read up on all the issues
so on about the Health and Longevity
okay because my goal is to hit a hundred
so I've got what
14 years to go I think you can do it you
look very healthy to me I think I can
make it if I just keep doing what I'm
doing I said so I'm living a stress-free
life
and walk every day good luck yeah
and I don't even get tired
which is amazes me because they say well
walk until you're out of breath yeah so
I do that and I I don't get out of
breath I just end up somewhere new when
is it going to happen you know
so I'm grateful for that okay that my
problem now is I interfere with other
people's lives because I want to share
how I live with other people that live
in unhealthy lifestyle
chips
diet soda which is all Bs yeah
and it's hard for them to give that up I
notice Filipinos love eating food at the
malls every weekend or anytime we get
unfortunately it's not real food you
know
what they eat is
I'll give you some examples if you go to
the little food stores
and then be cooking something like a bat
with oil
that oil
could be recycled half a dozen times
okay and you wouldn't know it true so
who knows where it's been
all right
and uh surprisingly there's very little
food poisoning here I guess we're all
including myself that must be immune
because of some of the stuff for those
people that think about budget and stuff
do you think it's reasonable for someone
to live in the Philippines as a single
man for under 1 500 USD definitely
possible because there are people that
can live on under six hundred dollars
but what about the standard or quality
of living can they have air conditioning
or just do they have to eat every meal
at home or you think it's still
reasonably okay
of course it depends what part of the
country you live you know there are
parts of the Philippines that are very
cool you don't need an air conditioner
if you go to a place like bagayo up in
the mountains yeah have you been there I
haven't been there yet I keep hearing
about it yeah okay if you go there
you'll see everybody wearing jackets wow
I miss jackets yeah so this is what you
will find there and people like that
kind of temperature that kind of
Lifestyle
and it's optional you know you can maybe
get tired of it you come down to the
heat yeah
the beauty of the Philippines is we have
over 7 000 Islands yeah take your pick
you know explore as many as you can
any regrets from the past 22 years I've
come to the Philippines something that
you wish you did differently Maybe
not in going to the Philippines yeah
Philippines
it's my Hawaii
okay you know
I love Hawaii it never leaves here okay
always here yeah
but
what this place has to offer and make
a selection of things you can do in the
Philippines
beautiful water and the water is warm in
Hawaii the water is cold
which is hard to believe
tropical island
but that's because you're out in the
middle of the Pacific Ocean yes you see
so in this little thing Filipinos
themselves
I could stay here just
for the people they make up everything
right
unbelievable
if you go to New York
any of those places the horror stories I
hear from people
it seems like so many people are angry
in the U.S Mainland there's always
something to be angry about
I have never seen an angry Filipino yeah
I've never seen a feeling yelling at
somebody
uh they're so passive
that in a nice way for sure yes they
could be if you've loved one the wrong
way yeah they might just blow yeah but
I've never seen it but as long as you're
respectful towards them they are the
same towards you right respectful then
yeah because some foreigners
are not too good at that
I've seen it myself yeah they have yeah
it's really not something that I want to
be part of yeah you know I'm I'm a
foreigner you know and you're just a
helper they have the sense of
entitlement maybe right yes I've seen it
yeah
so I do treat people respect and I smile
at them as often as I can but when I
pass them by yes it's hard for me to
ignore them so I
give some kind of sign that I'm
approachable or
like them yes and that always seems to
work and sometimes it even stop and chat
okay but
um the Filipino mentality I don't know
how they do it
tomorrow
there's thousands out there that don't
know where their next meal is coming up
how can you be laughing and joking
around and knowing that it's true you're
absolutely right and I think that's why
so many foreigners like myself and
yourself love the Philippines because
there are many countries similar
tropical or whatever but it's just
something about the Philippines I think
and um lastly you mentioned something
about videos and making videos like that
so tell me a little bit about that what
do you mean I've been here all this time
and I have left many times because like
you I'm a filmmaker yeah and I would go
all around Asia to collect my footage
and come home and edit
and um
now I'm kind of running out of countries
see visit many places before and you
decide to settle in the Philippines
and then I got hooked up with a
guy in England
who made video travel guides and that
involved videos
to attract
British people to Asia to the Caribbean
anywhere that
British people like to vacation
we would go there and make videos this
is a perfect place for digital Nomads
it's a good base number one and
the people that you may want to shoot
are very receptor I've shot in some
places I forget where it was
uh they play in I don't know if it was
Thailand or not
either Thailand or
China or something okay but they were
throwing fruit at me when I was shooting
them
like this you know
and no smiling hmm but it's different
here right everybody
makes your videos look like a fantastic
now video of course work on some people
find your videos you have a YouTube
channel or

and she had
oh yeah she had a big cyst on her breast
okay
and somebody said you have to go to the
hospital
went to the hospital told her how much
it cost thousands
just for a biopsy yeah and so here comes
the healing event

advised to go there which she did
and I found out I got to meet this girl

okay very good and uh
so she said seriously yeah so I'm
sitting about this close to her yeah
this is her
and the faith healers behind me
he's got a long stick crotting sting
yeah
so
the session starts and the Healer says
to me okay I want you to feel the lump
okay so it's no problem feeling your
breast I can go off of that so I'm
feeling her breast and sure enough it's
a big sister
yeah yeah I got it I got it
