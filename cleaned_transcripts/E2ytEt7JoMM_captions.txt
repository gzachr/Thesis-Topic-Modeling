for the first time let's dig in  
hello hello hello hello good job but we are here 
today to try the filipino dessert hello hello and  
i am telling you i am hecka hecka interested in 
this because it looks nothing like what i expected  
yeah i had no idea honestly what to expect 
but this yeah this looks good before we dig  
into it i'm just gonna let you guys know that 
we did google translate the pronunciation of  
hello hollow so this is what google and 
a youtube video told us how to pronounce  
hollow hollow so yes instead of halo halo hello 
hello so hopefully it's right fingers crossed  
we're doing our best here guys but let's get 
right into what halo hello is if anybody does not  
know hello hello is a popular cold dessert 
in the philippines made up of crushed ice  
evaporated milk or condensed milk in various 
ingredients including ube sweetened beans  
coconut strips sago pinpig rice boiled taro or 
soft yams and cubes slices or portions of fruit  
preserves and other root crop preserves flan and 
often topped with a scoop of ube ice cream whoa  
there's a lot potentially going on here for this 
big it's pretty big it probably doesn't look that  
big on camera but for this it was eight dollars 
and 65 cents canadian i know i know a lot of  
you guys are gonna be like what that's like two 
dollars it's a big dessert we're in canada yeah  
it's inflation and we're also eating a very cold 
dessert on a very cold day so we crazy really all  
right let's lift the lid off whoa whoa first 
observations i really really like that purple  
all right i've seen so there's purple and then 
i like how it's white and then it looks like  
red on the bottom and there's like another ice 
cream here of uh so really quickly based on the  
descriptions that could be in it 
there is crushed ice i see that here  
yep got it crushed ice check i'm guessing there's 
evaporated milk or condensed milk in there  
probably some milk in there down here it 
looks like there's the sweetened beans  
we'll get there more yeah there's a whole 
bunch of stuff at the bottom like okay stuff  
this is the ice cream on top of this ice cream 
ice cream and this might be the oh that's the flan  
we had fun before we did that's how i recognize 
that oh yeah all right let's just take bites and  
figure it out let's just get into it because 
there's so much there's a lot to eat here it's  
gonna take us a while to get to the bottom i'm 
gonna try the ice cream first i gotta get my  
lid off got it i got a bit of everything 
here okay this purple ice cream i know oh
mmm i like that i'm trying to figure what 
flavor it is and that flan is really good  
wow you can tell i can really 
taste it is my tongue purple  
that was the world's slowest tongue stick out um 
the ice cream tastes like milky i don't know what  
ube ice cream is let us know down below what ube 
and if i'm going to be right ube ice cream that's  
what it says on top let us know what it consists 
of because it has a really like coconutty flavor  
it does it's very it's going to sell it's very 
soft but it's so good it's very tasty you're going  
to taste some of that this is there's so much to 
dig into this is really good too though oh that  
ice cream though man there's so many layers to dig 
down into here oh my god i like the flan better  
how it's like ice cold well if you sort of scoop 
down a bit you can get some of that like condensed  
milk or whatever there too i want to get to the 
how do i get to the bottom i gotta dig i guess  
or we just have to eat really fast i got something 
i got something there it's like a surprise every  
spoonful there is so much going on in this i can't 
believe oh look it looks like a cherry or like  
what did they say uh portions of fruit preserves 
oh i got the bean the sweetened bean yeah  
there's so much going on here there's the bean 
all right let's try the cherry like a jelly bean  
oh that's not a cherry what 
is that no it's a cherry  
it's like a maraschino cherry no 
i don't think there's a cherry  
no i know we've been talking a lot but there's 
a lot to enjoy but i do have you have a fun fact
let's hear it but there's clearly a sugar cause 
it's hidden halo halo is considered to be the  
unofficial national dessert of the philippines 
the term hello hello literally means mixed  
together in english by extension this spelling 
has come to describe any object or situation  
that is composed of a similar colorful melange of 
ingredients very fancy i love learning about like  
what the word in english means because it 
makes so much more sense now i wonder if like  
just eat the layers or you can mix it all up and 
eat it i don't know i mean the ice cream on top  
is so good though like that's by far my favorite 
i think my favorite here is the flan man it's good  
it's better than i think it's better than 
the remember the flower it's better ice cream  
oh weird did you get a piece of fruit the 
sweetened bean what does it taste like it sort of  
tastes like a jelly bean without the hard outside 
um candy coating like this reminds me if you've  
ever had like a jelly bean and you've taken off 
the hard candy coating and just eat the insides  
that's what it reminds me of people do that i used 
to really yeah when i was a kid that was weird  
that seemed like a lot of work yeah i used to take 
a long time to do jelly beans when i was a kid  
i'm gonna be honest the bean kind of freaks me 
out it tastes like a sweet and cold bean i don't  
like the bean i don't i don't find it has a ton 
of flavor to it oh yeah it tastes like do you  
get any of these cherry things the cherries are 
pretty good this is just honestly interesting  
an explosion of flavor in your mouth yeah this 
ube or ube ice cream is delicious and i love the  
color purple eating purple ice cream is fun i'll 
say that really prince but purple rain honestly  
though overall it's not overly sweet or anything 
that's a that's not nice and it's not like  
you know the ice cream we usually get here like 
you get like rocky road or something that's like  
eating the frozen candy bar this is more like a 
natural sweetness to it with the fruit and stuff  
it's really nice it doesn't give me a sugar high 
watermelon sugar high is that a sun i got a hair  
in my mouth watermelon sugar yeah cherry styles 
doesn't look good was it from your own head  
i don't know we'll just go with yes this would 
be super refreshing in the summertime oh yeah  
it would especially with all the ice chips in it 
oh yeah it's kind of like a mix of like a sundae  
and like a slushie so if you're having a day where 
you feel like a slushy ended ice cream you can't  
decide which one you want here's your answer huh 
i don't even know i just ate chunk of something  
i do have to say i love everything about this but 
i'm not a fan of the beans but i don't generally  
like beans well you you hate chili and stuff like 
that so that brown bean was not good i had a piece  
of clear fruit it was delicious yeah that's what 
i just had it was like oh i didn't the beans are  
not my jimmy jam yeah i mean sorry guys we're 
just talking a lot of it but look we've hardly  
made a dent i don't know i got a whole bunch of 
stuff here see those that brown bean wasn't good  
you guys have stood up some layers mine's all 
turning into purple that's okay you'll probably  
have to squish it around yeah did you try one of 
these cherries i did okay that's what i thought  
tasted like the jelly bean oh no no no did you try 
one of these i did try one of the beans afterwards  
i would probably skip the beans yeah i'm here 
to be honest what is your favorite part of it  
the flan by far yeah what's your favorite part 
ube ice cream it's awesome ice cream the flan  
was really good and i kind of agree with steve 
the flan was way better ice cold like in here  
yeah i just loved it in here i don't know because 
with the ube ice cream or something it just really  
hit differently does it make you want to get and 
jiggy with it it does make you want to go i can't  
think of a flawed pun but before we close up the 
video i do have one more fun fact i kind of was  
a little slow on the fun fact oh that's okay 
all right fun fact number two hello hello was  
featured in an episode of anthony bourdain parts 
unknown when its host anthony bourdain visited a  
jollibee branch in los angeles bourdain praised 
the dessert and posted a photo of the dessert  
on his twitter account which he captioned oddly 
beautiful i included this fun fact because he is  
right it is really intriguingly beautiful to look 
at like it's weird i don't know if it's just the  
purple ice cream the different colors but it it 
it is easy to look at the presentation was great  
i feel bad for what i did to it but i think that 
just happens but even now even once it gets melted  
though it's still like this beautiful like purple 
color too it looks really nice i guess that is  
it for our first time trying hello hello yeah i'm 
glad we did it was delicious absolutely i knew oh
