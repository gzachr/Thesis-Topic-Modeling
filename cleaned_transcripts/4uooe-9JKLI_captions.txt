- It feels like you're winning
the lottery.
- I love this texture!
- I'm hoping this was worth it.
(laughs)
- (PvF) Have you tried a lot
of desserts from around the world?
- I've tried McDonald's 
around the world.
- Right.
- That's about it.
- (PvF) Unfortunately it is
a Try Not To Eat challenge.
- Oh no! (laughs)
And is an international 
desserts edition.
This is your first
Try Not To Eat, right?
- I think so, yeah, yeah.
- I'm gonna eat, I don't care.
I always eat.
- I want to experience something new,
like, there's, if I see something...
- I wanna feel something!
- Yeah!
- (PvF) Well, we will be
presenting you
with amazing desserts
from around the world.
If you succeed at not eating any,
you will be rewarded,
but for each item you try,
you must eat one bite
of our punishment dessert.
- Could a dessert be that bad though?
- I've had one of your 
punishment meals before,
it was not fun.
- You're gonna fall under
my peer pressure, Sylvia.
- (laughs) Probably.
- (woman) Today, I'll be talking about
Kouign-amann.
- Kouign-amann,
is this like Swedish?
- Oh.
- Ooh!
- I was very wrong, 
it's France, yeah.
- (woman) ...and amann 
meaning butter.
- Ooh!
- Butter cake!
- Looks delicious.
- Hell yeah.
- That's a good solution.
- More butter,
it's all you need.
- Nice!
- I wanna try this!
- Oh, just butter?
- Stop, it looks so bomb.
- Yum!
- Butter dog!
- Look how beautiful she is.
- So, butter cake?
- This is sexual.
- That was like seducing.
- I'm like drooling.
(Daniel laughs)
- I think I'm gonna fail.
I'm gonna eat this.
- Wow, these look even
better in person.
- Right?
- It looks very butter doughy.
- (PvF) Warm, buttery, flaky,
rich and decadent,
don't even begin to describe this
first treat from Brittany, France,
which is described as 
the fattiest pastry in all of Europe.
- That makes sense,
it's a third butter.
- Look at this,
this is so satisfying.
- It just smells so good.
- I love pastries.
- It's like, just a big croissant.
- Holy crap, look at that.
- You should do it.
(buzzer rings)
- Mmm.
- It gives me the vibes
of a croissant,
so I feel like it's just like
a very sugary croissant.
- Croissant.
- But like a cake.
- I love croissant.
- Me too.
(buzzer rings)
- Yeah, just like sweet,
buttery, flaky.
- Don't you think it's worth it?
- Mm-hmm.
- I think this is so worth it.
- The worst part is I'm terrified
of whatever this punishment is.
- This, with like hot chocolate.
- Yes.
- Kouign-amann.
- Kouign-amann?
- (PvF) Kouign-amann.
- Kouign-amann.
- Kouign-amann.
- Kouign-amann.
- This is so good.
- I'll take the risk, I really don't
think it can be that bad.
- This is kind of a dream come true.
- Yeah, this is so good!
- 'Cause I love bread.
- It hurts, 'cause it looks
beautiful.
- The winning desserts
are always so magnificent.
- It's gonna make this so much worse,
'cause I'm gonna be watching her eat
all this beautiful stuff.
- Please pack this up for me.
(Sylvia laughs)
- Oh, I love these!
I have these literally in my freezer
so I don't know if I need to eat it.
- I've never seen this before.
- (laughs) Brown sugar boba?
- I've been wanting to try
these so bad.
- Uh oh.
- Oh no!
- Boba tea as an ice cream.
- Oh no!
- Do you like boba?
- Yeah!
- Yeah, it's like boba ice cream.
- Boba ice cream?
- Boba milk tea ice cream bars.
- No, why? (laughs)
- Yeah, I'm tearing this up.
- They're actually very good.
- Whatever the punishment is,
it is worth it. (laughs)
Yum!
- Oof.
- It's the exact same thing!
- (PvF) These viral brown sugar boba
ice cream bars from Taiwan
made quite the splash when they
hit the markets last year,
and after one bite,
you will know why.
They're cold, refreshing,
and delightfully chewy.
(Izzy babbles)
- No, this sucks! (laughs)
- Willpower. (laughs)
Willpower with a sad face.
- Yes please!
(buzzer rings)
- I freakin' love ice cream!
- Mm-hmm.
- Don't look at me like that.
(laughs)
- That is so good.
- This is horrible.
I'm just trying to hold out. (laughs)
- Eat the ice cream bar!
- No no no, okay.
- Ugh, this hurts.
- (whispers) Yes!
- It smells so yummy.
(buzzer rings)
- That's so good.
- What would be torturous
is if I have to watch you
eat the best thing they have,
and I can't.
- What's your favorite boba flavor?
- This one.
- That one?
- Brown sugar.
- Mm-hmm.
- And I love brown sugar.
- It feels like you're winning
the lottery, like, pure joy.
- You're a wonderful salesman.
(both laugh)
- Exactly!
- 10 out of 10,
do recommend.
- I'm good.
- I passed.
- I passed!
- This is probably one of the more
painful shoots I've done in a while,
'cause I love sweets.
Angel hair dough?
- Ooh!
- Oh, I think I've had this.
- I have never seen that before.
- This texture looks amazing.
- It looks like cheese!
- Oh, that's what that stuff is.
Crushed pistachios.
- Yeah!
- I'm intrigued.
- My childhood friend 
was Middle Eastern,
and her mom made us that a lot,
and so I've had it before.
- Oh, this is interesting.
This is very...
- It looks like it'd have
a nice crunch.
- Yeah.
- Whoa!
- Mmm, I'm just gonna hold it
with my hands.
(fork clatters)
You saw nothing.
- You got attacked!
- You saw nothing.
- (PvF) So this traditional
Middle Eastern dessert
is made with finely shredded
semolina or filo dough,
and soaked in a sweet
sugar-based syrup
and layered with cheese
and pistachio,
for a treat like no other.
- Definitely not American dessert.
- It is very tempting.
(buzzer rings)
- Whoa.
- (PvF) You ever had anything
like this before?
- No.
- I wanna try it really badly,
but then again...
- Honestly, if there was gonna be
a dessert that would end me,
it was this one,
and the fork fell on the floor,
so I'm taking that as a sign
from the higher beings.
- Dang!
- I wanna try it just because
when will I ever get to try this?
- Exactly!
- I just feel like the texture's
gonna be out of this world.
Again, I'm going in.
(buzzer rings)
- (PvF) I gotta say,
this one is really good.
- That's evil,
you're really tempting me.
- Some parts of it,
you can really taste the cheese.
Other parts, it's like so sweet.
- It's kinda like cream cheese,
like more a tart cream cheese,
and then the crunchiness and then
the little sweet sugar on top.
That's good.
- (gasps) Oh!
- I do wanna try it.
(both laugh)
- Do it, do it, do it!
- Okay.
(buzzer rings)
- I love this texture!
- It's certainly the most
unique one so far,
I've never seen anything
like this before.
- No.
- Oh, this looks...
- Dawg, you are one step away
from taking a...
(buzzer rings)
- Mmm!
- I'm really enjoying this one.
- It kinda looks like, okay,
what are the Tribbles, from Star Trek?
- You weren't lying, oh my God!
- Describe it to me.
Describe it, use your words!
- Warm.
- It's kinda like cheesecake.
It's like an upside down 
cheesecake.
- It's so soft,
the cheese is perfect.
- A+, 10 out of 10.
- This is so good.
Yeah, A+
- This is so good.
- It was really, really, 
really, really, really good.
- (PvF) Is this your favorite
Try Not To Eat so far?
- Definitely.
- (PvF) One on his...
- Thank you. (laughs)
(Jayka laughs)
- I'm gonna roll home.
- No, literally! (laughs)
- Ah, I love mochi.
My dog's name is Mochi.
- Oh, I've had mochi before.
- (gasps) Oh.
- Is this in Little Tokyo?
Oh, I've been here.
- Mochi's cool.
- Mm-hmm.
- So mochi.
Mochi's delicious.
- OMG.
- (gasps) It's so cute!
- Ooh, she's so pretty!
- Oh wow, they do look gorgeous.
- Oh, it's so pretty!
- (PvF) So, wagashi are gorgeous
traditional Japanese confections,
and today, we have a beautiful
kiku mochi
that's shaped like a Chrysanthemum,
with a white bean center.
And let's just be clear,
ice cream mochi is not mochi.
- Never mind, I was wondering
why this is room temperature.
- (PvF) Ice cream mochi
is what us Japanese people made
so that other people
would start trying mochi.
- Fair enough.
- I guess I'm gonna try it then.
'Cause I wanna see the real thing.
(buzzer rings)
- I'm like getting into it.
- I feel like I'm a fraud here,
'cause I love sweet things,
but I'm passing up
on all these sweet things.
- I had mochi recently,
so I'm gonna sit this one out.
- Did you like it?
- Yeah, I love mochi.
- Let's do it.
- Woo!
(buzzer rings)
- Mmm, it's so soft!
- It's like Play-Doh.
Aw, it looks so cool, I love that.
- Sylvia!
- No!
- Seriously, you're not gonna,
you're gonna back out of it?
- Mmm.
- It's so soft!
- Oh yeah.
- It's like pillow.
- This is so yummy!
- I'm actually starting to 
get nervous about the punishment.
- This is just, I'm hoping,
I'm hoping my patience is worth it.
Halo-halo.
- Oh, halo-halo!
- Let's make some Halo-halo.
- This is my country.
- Oh, is this Filipino?
Right, yeah.
- Hmm.
- So it's snow cone?
- Yum!
- What is that, condensed milk?
- Oh that's ube, huh?
- So halo-halo means
mix-mix.
- Interesting.
Oh, is it gonna come like that too?
- Looks like you have
everything in there!
- Thank you!
- Wait, is this beans and...
- Why am I smelling it?
Like it's gonna smell like anything.
- (PvF) Here you go.
And finally, from the Philippines, 
we have halo-halo,
an extremely popular cold dessert
made with everything
and the kitchen sink.
- It looks pretty good.
The beans throws it off
completely for me though.
I just, I can't.
- With ube ice cream!
(buzzer rings)
- I have such a weak spot
for taro though,
so this smells just like it.
- I've never had it.
- Mmm!
(buzzer rings)
- There you go,
how you vibing,
how you feeling?
- Oh, mmm!
- Oh?
- You know what's funny?
(buzzer rings)
This one's like 
the coolest one so far.
- There's a lot of different
textures going on in there.
- (PvF) It's only one bite
of the punishment food then.
- Yeah, but there's a prize food.
(laughs)
- Wait, I have to take a bite
for everything I eat?
- Yes.
- I did not,
I don't think you made
that clear enough! (laughs)
- Mmm!
- But I don't want beans,
that's so gross!
You know what, we're gonna,
we're trying this for the culture,
not just ube.
I'm really nervous, 
I'm not gonna lie.
- Why are you nervous?
- I'm gonna take a bite
and taste the bean,
and be like bruh. (laughs)
I'm scared.
- The beans are sweet.
- Mmm.
- I'm so happy right now,
you guys are feeding me
all of my favorites.
- I hate this, 
'cause I will pass.
- (both) This is so good.
- I have sensitive teeth,
but the pain doesn't even matter.
- I'm hoping this was worth it.
(both laugh)
- I hope it was worth it!
- (PvF) You like it?
- I do, I do like it.
- (PvF) You do know there's
a punishment coming.
- I don't care, bring it on.
(laughs)
- (PvF) So unfortunately,
you were tempted 
by our sweet, sweet treats,
and for that I'd like to share
a personal dessert with you.
When my parents were dating,
my mother,
well, she wasn't the best baker,
but she really wanted to make
my dad a treat,
so she whipped up her finest
batch of cookies,
except she mixed up the salt
and the sugar.
- Oh no.
- These are gonna be salty.
- (PvF) My dad loved her so much
that he suffered through
each and every cookie,
even though they tasted
pretty much like the ocean.
So for your punishment,
we have a fresh batch
of Mama Iizuka's cookies.
- This is actually 
like precious though.
- Hey, that's so cute!
- If your dad can do it,
I can do it.
- (PvF) Congratulations!
- Yes!
- (PvF) You were able to resist
all the treats,
and for that, guess what?
- What?
- (PvF) You get everything!
- Yes!
- Yes!
- Oh come on!
- Oh my goodness, let's go!
- This is a lesson in life.
Gluttony is never the answer, I guess.
- Look at the ultimate flex,
I got the three salt cookies,
and she has this.
- I've never seen it
where you still get to eat everything
and enjoy all these 
sweet treats.
- (both) Cheers!
- Oh, that is salty!
- Cheers.
Okay, you were right.
There are far better than
I thought they were gonna be.
- That is so salty!
- Oh, it's so nice and delicate.
- I thought at first,
it wouldn't be that bad,
'cause like, salt is good
in dessert,
but then I was like oh,
there's literally no sugar.
- Mama Iizuka, 
this is for you. (laughs)
- Come on, Mama!
- This is for you!
- Getting more intense.
Oh geez!
- Uh-uh, no, no!
(whimpers)
- I'm so excited right now.
This is the best reward
I've had in one of these episodes.
- I hate this. (laughs)
- Mmm, delicious!
- This is...
- That was brutal.
- This is wonderful.
- That's mean,
this is mean salt.
- Well you don't know how delicious
this butter thing is gonna be,
'cause you didn't try it!
How is it?
- Ah!
- A ha ha.
- Ah, ugh!
- (PvF) Any regrets?
- (both) No!
- These are really funny,
and I actually kinda
wanna try them anyways.
- Alright, I'm not scared
of a salty cookie.
- Oh, you took a big bite.
You're gonna regret that.
- That was a...
Is it bad that I kinda like it?
- What!?
- Ooh. (coughs)
I got like a, ooh!
- I don't care how much
I love you, no.
- Thank you guys so much
