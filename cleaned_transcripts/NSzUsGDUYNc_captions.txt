okay I think that's him
wait wait wait wait there he is we got
him this is why Filipinos are the nicest
kindest most amazing people in the world
sit down to the end of this video find
out why we think that let's go
first of all I'm excited to be back in
the Philippines I'm here in Manila with
pom pom are you happy to be back in the
Philippines yes and this is my first
time in Manila as well I'm so excited
I'm gonna share the story of what
happened to us yesterday and sit down to
the end of the video and see if we do
anything to repay this gentleman back
for his kindness yesterday we arrived
from the airplane airport right it was
like raining cats and dogs and we took
shelter under this little area it was
raining so hard we didn't want to walk
anymore and somebody came out looked at
us and offered us an umbrella and
naturally of course I would say no no
thank you but he was very insistent very
kind so he was like um
five times and he's still
yeah he doesn't know us he doesn't know
who we are where we're from who I am who
Palm is uh we've never seen this man
before and within 10 minutes of our
first day here in Manila this guy
offered us the only umbrella he had
first of all I was really really like
shocked to be honest
yeah it was very insistent you know we
took it no shame I really
like um our food is getting cold so we
took the umbrella now today we're going
to go ahead and show them some
appreciation for what he did to us his
kindness he didn't have to do anything
he doesn't know Us Palm what should we
get him I think
fruits yeah
I don't know to be honest there's a lot
of fruits here and everybody gets fruit
all the time yeah but not everybody
likes fruit like we do
um oh what about jollibee's I know I
love jollibee's around here yeah
yeah let's buy some jollibee's and along
the way we'll show you guys our
neighborhood right so yeah let's go
let's go
I see some fruit here
hello
how much per kilo
171 kilos I just want a half a kilo
apples now these two and this is three
for a hundred right yeah yeah give me
just two of these as well
how do you say uh Apple in Tagalog
thank you so much appreciate it
actually we had chicken yesterday so
maybe you could stop by McDonald's for
you and I again for Jollibee okay let's
do the KFC there too right a lot of fast
food joints on this corner
it's very loud here in Manila a lot of
things happening a lot of people a lot
of noise
everybody's saying hello
super busy here at McDonald's so we'll
just order it to go
um yeah so McDonald's is really tasty
and affordable here because they come
from the West is about half the price so
you know what I think we should try to
use one of these tricycles huh see what
that's
let's see what that's like I have no
idea how to do this
Bus Let's do Cabela Street like 400
meters
how much is it
yeah yeah that's what familiar how much
is it
30 yeah
I think I've gained weight
I guess it's gonna have to eat
McDonald's every day right now if it's
too hot to be getting Popeyes right so
you know what we should I mean not
Popeyes Jolly we're gonna wait for him
to finish work as well I think that's a
good idea and let's wait for him to
finish work just so you can take the
food home maybe right I mean you're
gonna come here and live here you're
gonna start to learn to how to use
public transportation yeah like a
tricycle although it's only like 400
meters it's just too sunny too hot we're
carrying too many things and why not
split the cost and you know
two people and take one of these fun
rides
okay thank you thank you so much
so only 30 or two people always give
them 15 because you know I'm such a nice
guy and that's it this is where we're
staying right now
all right so we got the Jollibee chicken
let's hope the guy is there because if
he's not there we have a whole bunch of
chicken to eat all by ourselves so let's
go see if he's there
but now we're on a time crunch we only
have one minute to get there at 5 30 I
think he finished his work so let's see
if we can catch him on time
good
oh check out the time it's 5 31 we're
one minute late I hope you're still

yeah so yeah that's it we're gonna tell
you guys uh
a little bit more after I catch my
breath
I've caught my breath and that's what
happened to us today our first time here
in Manila together and we experienced
such kind people and the guy was
genuinely just being nice yeah he's so
nice like he he said like no no
no no he won nothing he saw how much you
refused to even take the you know the
Jollibee he wanted nothing to do with it
he was so insistent but I wasn't going
to leave without him knowing how much we
appreciate it right exactly and you're
gonna find people being kind in the
Philippines all the time without wanting
anything back all the regular people our
neighborhood right now actually we're in
Mandela young which is like called a
tiger City because it's rapidly
developing and it's really really nice
here you get a nice mixture of very
local but also right around the corner
it's like skyscrapers and tall buildings
and one thing that I really really
impressed here just like we're waiting
for the tricycle right he just tell
exactly the same price as local because
like we asked someone local yesterday
also so yesterday before we took the
tricycle I asked somebody how much it
was for a ride yeah I sit around 25 but
I guess you know he said 30 for two of
us yeah and you know he could have said
any number really because I'm obviously
a foreigner yes and palm you know I know
you look a little Filipino but whatever
but you're obviously Thai anyways let us
