Hello everybody.
My name is Katriinka.
I'm a professional singer
and the voice coach.
And welcome back to my channel.
Today, we´re going to be reacting
to a very special lady that  you've
requested so much that it was nearly
impossible to run away from you guys..
It's going to be a
wonderful Katrina, Velarde.
I hope I'm pronouncing her name, right,
if not, let me know down in the comments.
Uh, you guys requested her almost as much
as Morissette and Oh my God, you know it.
I am a huge fan of Morissette,
so I genuinely cannot wait
to discover Katrina too.
We share a name let's share the music too.
And now without any further
ado, let's get into that.
Okay.
So is everyone there in
Philippines, this beautiful.
I might be moving.
Listen, what the hell is this?
I'm jealous.
very light, very precise.
I like it.
she has a very beautiful tone quality.
Okay.
Let's talk about it.
What is really interesting is
her a combination of just lightly
touching the notes and going.
Very much just with her mix and
head voice and being just very,
very sensitive about about it.
But then choosing to open certain notes
because she's like giving us the bait.
We all know that she's going to
open and belt notes later, but
she's just giving us the hint like,
Ooh, look, look what I can do.
Look, look, I'm just going to give
you a little, just just a little.
A little taste.
So you can have that
anticipation for later.
Her whole jaw and vocal
chords are extremely relaxed.
That's why she has such a stable,
beautiful tone in her whole tone.
Quality is really, really pretty,
let´s continue, nice low notes
now we see how much she can go in
just real quick.
I love her vibrato.
It's really vibrant and
it feels like sparkles.
Like I dunno how to explain it better,
but sometimes when vibrato hits good, it
almost feels like in the fairytales, like,
you know, when the sparkles fall down the
round you, that's how her vibrato feels.
And it's really beautiful.
It's adding the magic into that song.
so the switch was very, very nicely done.
But I think what's the most admirable
on it is how strong her head voice is.
Like it's very full body.
Usually when singers add their head
voice just to like spice things up,
they have very, very, very thin.
head voice very light, but her is like
really, really full and like full color,
full body head voice is so beautiful.
Oh, my God, I wasn't
not breathing with her.
It happens every single time.
Ooh.
I like Katrina.
I like Katrina a lot.
Okay.
So her technique is fantastic and this was
allowing her to hit those beautiful belts.
They are very bright.
They're very shiny, which sometimes
can be harmful for the song,
but she was just holding them
so brilliantly that it was just.
Incredible.
It just makes you hold your breath with
her, not even attempting to breathe
because you feel like you're going
to miss the second miss a heartbeat.
She doesn't use too much, of voice breaks
or voice cries or growls, but she focuses
on, on, on the power of her voice.
And also on their fantastic technique,
her jaw was relaxed the whole time.
There was not a one moment when she would
be like clench, like, which happens a
lot of times when people are like pushing
the tone out of themselves, they like
kind of like clench, like all together,
their throat with the jaw, everything.
But she, on the other side, even
pulled her shoulders back when
she was letting the huge tone out,
she went ha like a super sayan her
breath control and the whole control
of her vocal chords was fantastic.
And you couldnt saw it on the fact that.
Not just that.
She was working with her whole body, but
her whole body supported the high notes.
It was not hold from here from
the throat, from the vocal cord.
It was the whole body working.
towards that note her diaphragm
her diaphramgm he heard the
....... ................ where do you come from?
And also including her diaphragm.
That's it.
Let's also talk about the very last note,
because that one was absolutely insane.
She did change different notes and
the vowels that she was singing
them on and made her run up and back
down to the original  placements.
It's pretty awesome.
When a singer belt something and
they're holding it forever and now
you're like, Oh my God, when he's
going to breathe, it's just so amazing.
Like she did not just hold it.
She changed it up.
She spiced it.
up.
And it was just one very long phrase.
That was really beautiful.
And there's been run up down
everything within that one short
phrase and it resulted in some,
some of the grandest finale but
for now I hope you enjoy the video.
And, uh, I hope you had a good time.
