of course you would have this culture shop so  
especially if you married or have a girlfriend in 
the province area so there are major adjustments  
especially if they're in a remote area there's no 
water there's no electricity so you really need to  
adjust and be flexible of what they can give you 
yes so here is this for like men who have started  
to date or have married uh a Filipino woman and 
are now coming to live with them maybe it seems  
like directed at somebody who I don't know I'm 
let's let's watch more before I say anything else  
of what they can give you yes so here in the city 
we always have this big containers to store water  
and we use a Dipper and sort of ways there's a 
lot of ways to use the Dipper most especially  
if you want to take a bath so guys let's go ahead 
and go to the comfort room and I'll show you and  
how to use the Dipper the magic Dipper okay 
so let go guys hi guys so we are here in our  
comfort room it feels like more of the audio is 
coming from my left ear does it feel like that  
for you okay I was just making sure my headset 
wasn't broken let show you my head we use the  
Dipper especially we take a bath or take a poop 
oh the way she I love the way she said that so  
our comfort room is so small in the Philippines 
the most standard comfort room is just this big  
yeah it looks bigger than ours big the same as 
your big comfort room the size is really bigger  
so us it's just this small you can just stand take 
your poop and you can stand here and take a bath  
so that's just the size of the comfort room every 
time she says take a we mostly use this Dipper at  
the side of the container so gosh the most of the 
arrangement of the container in the Philippines  
is they put the container beside the bowel so 
that's the most Arrangement here but there are  
cases that especially in the province their big 
containers are outside so you really need to get  
water from outside oh gosh like say for example 
their container is here beside the door so you  
need to get water here and you to use it here oh 
but most of the time multiple times is beside the  
ball here under the faucet yes so if you were 
to poop let's see with the pooping cuz most of  
you guys use tissue so here in the Philippines 
you cannot put the tissue inside the bow so most  
of our bow are not built for like putting tissue 
there no you need to put the tissue in the garbage  
can but in the province you need to get tissue 
or you need to buy a lot of tissue cuz they're  
far away from the convenience store you need to 
go to the city in order for you to buy tissue  
so it's inconvenient if you really want to use 
tissue cuz you're still in adjustment stage but  
if you're ready and curious to know how to use 
the Dipper let's go ahead and do the stepbystep  
process this is like an oldfashioned Bess you 
take off your penss you step by step okay and  
you get oh this is so embarrassing I sure there's 
a Dipper guys cuz sometimes there's no Dipper and  
you need to go outside to get the Dipper gosh and 
that would be uncomfortable if you're already in  
that position done pooping already I forgot to 
how usually wash it ask me and Roger can you do  
a stepbystep demo okay I got you so hopefully not 
too step by step we get our video removed so of  
course you need to get the water make sure which 
hand you'll be of course washing your butt and  
which hand will you use to hold the container so 
the one that you'll be using the container is the  
clean one the clean one or the Dipper so this is 
my clean hand to hold the oh my gosh I don't know  
if I'm ready for this so I just get the water 
and try to pour pour the the water here at my  
back and you use this to of course clean your 
butt your butthole then afterwards you need to  
pour it like this oh my God this is definitely a 
shock you don't need to go sideways okay I'm just  
showing you how to pour it like that and while 
you're pouring it you're washing your butt of  
course I'm never shaking anyone's hand done doing 
that if your butt is clean already then you put  
the again at the container wow get soap so you'll 
be using again guys don't use the dirty the dirty  
hand yes you need to get the soap with your Clean 
Hands oh no this one this is a process they here  
so you need to wash your hands the dirty hands 
here then get where's the bleach like that that  
wash first your hands and then after washing your 
hands you you're not going to rinse the soap off  
like that oh my gosh here and afterwards it's only 
when she says the word butt I giggle like a little  
she even said the word butthole so they have a 
they must have like a drain in their in their  
comp this is their shower right here too sometimes 
I wet myself I wet water I put water on my pants  
so you need to be cautious you need to make sure 
that your pants are not in the way when you try to  
get the water man what a process since you're just 
the only one in the toilet you can put your pants  
hang there some actually some Filipinos would 
be naked if they would they would poop because  
after done hang my clothes over out or take a bath 
most of them but if you just pooping you can just  
take out your trousers your pants you can hang 
that at the door you can have hang it everywhere  
especially they have their uh hanger there so you 
could just take that off in order your pants not  
to be wet yes I would definitely have to do that 
way to do it's so messy I would have to I would  
especially first getting used to taking your 
pants off so you just need to make sure that  
the water is far away from your legs like that 
so you would just do like this she's a pro at  
it she is pour the water afterwards you can have 
a clean butt so if you're done doing your butt's  
going to be clean after this definitely so you 
need to wash your hands again to make sure it's  
so clean yeah cuz we're talking about poop here 
afterwards you can flush the toilet some toilets  
doesn't have these types of containers at their 
back most of the bowel in the province is just  
the bowel itself so you really need to get the 
zipper again and pour the water up until the poop  
is gone yeah so that's how they try my go in the 
province but worst case scenario there are worst  
case scenarios there especially if they don't 
have a bow so where do they poop so they poop  
at the forest I mean that makes sense handy if 
you have a tissue you can use your tissue but  
if you don't have a tissue you can use the leaves 
leaves or leaves corn can bring a container yeah  
you can bring a container full of water you could 
do that and Roger had get it on that conversation  
that part he's like that's my preferred method 
but there are also that they would just bring  
water and after that after done pooping they would 
just wash their hands in the house that's it there  
are cases like that so some would use paper worst 
case oh my gosh like notebook paper like in the  
province right now it's improving so some of them 
has already toilets or a comfort room but most  
don't so you need to adjust yourself you really 
need to know if they have a comfort room or not  
so common question is that how to dry their hands 
and butt yes so how do you try to dry your hands  
and butt so that's most of your questions guys 
so of course if you go to the comfort room you  
need to have the towel with you you need to have 
a hand towel and a butt towel though to have AET  
hand or a wet butt you can use the towel and you 
can wipe your butt so that's the comp scenario but  
for us Filipinos this is for Filipinos guys okay 
so most of us we just put our pants again and it  
would just dry up the the wet sface in our butt oh 
my gosh we would just put directly our pants on or  
our shorts but for our hands we just do like 
this we wipe it on our back or some actually  
wipe it on their their t-shirt like like that so 
that their hands would be dry what if I'm inside  
the mall so when it comes to inside the mall guys 
so there are areas where you can dry gosh this is  
such a there are machines that you can dry your 
hands at the side yes but some actually if they  
don't want to line up in drying their hands they 
would just shake it after shaking it they will  
just wipe here again what about my butt so for the 
bud you can use tissue if you have tissue so make  
sure if you would go to the mall you go elsewhere 
you have tissue with you cuz sometimes there are  
public toilets that don't have tissue okay most 
wow cuz if there's a lot of people especially  
there's an event they have no tissue at all so 
you need to have tissue with you all the time  
so that you can wipe your butt you can wipe your 
hand P or you could just for the hands you could  
just easily shake them just wipe it here right 
cuz it's already clean you put already soap in  
your hands that's already clean especially if 
you went to the the the sink area you wash it  
there and you could just shake it there that's it 
oh my goodness that's what I was going say why do  
I need to have a hand towel and a butt towel I 
just cleaned my butt with soap just drip that  
Su is Fab I I mean that I would prefer I am not 
a tissue user I don't like using tissues I like  
using wipes I like that like super clean feeling 
he thinks I'm weird but I've been doing this since  
the boys were little I've taught them to use wipes 
which is probably created little monsters they can  
you they we use tissue we use tissue in this house 
I'm not going to say we don't use tissue it's just  
I have to use wipes as well this is getting very 
TMI but um I like the idea of cleaning your butt  
thoroughly or something for I would just use that 
bathroom with the shower next to it and just when  
I go just get in the shower right after that makes 
sense to me I mean it does like especially when  
you don't have but like this is such it would 
be a culture shock cuz I'm just so used to the  
preferences that I have like the toilet paper 
is right there if I need to get in the shower  
the shower is right there I don't have to scoop 
water in order to do that in order to flush my  
toilet it's it's just a flush like you know what 
I mean like I don't have to do those steps so I  
can't even imagine like yeah I have such a huge uh 
respect and different of like thought process when  
I think about other people in different countries 
because they don't have it exactly like I need to  
appreciate what I have as probably what I'm trying 
to say but yeah they don't have it as easy as we  
do in some places especially like but they become 
used to it yeah this is crazy this is such a shock  
to me it is TR in a sec if you don't want to 
wipe your hands on your your your dress your  
t-shirt your pants but for us Filipinos we just 
normally shake it and just wipe it behind your  
back thinking about people being like on a first 
date um any type of Tiss but if this is normal for  
our but yeah let it soak in the pants it's just 
H just a small amount of water in your butt so  
the pant the clothes that you're wearing would 
just absorb it and it would just dry it'll dry  
yeah and it's clean it would just dry so here in 
the Philippines that's the most common thing and  
how you use the Dipper and that's the step by step 
thing in using the Dipper hopefully guys this is  
informative for you and I hope that I answer all 
of your questions and how to dry your butt and  
your hands dude we need a butt counter how many 
times did she say but I love the way she said in  
our next Vlog no hate just love bye oh no hate 
just love I love that I love that she seems very  
sweet yeah that was a little that was informative 
apart for $170 a month wow that's the next thing  
that caught my eye wow I'm very intrigued about 
living in the Philippines and this this made me  
a little bit more intrigued about finding out 
what it's like to live in the Philippines um  
different things about it but yeah I look forward 
to watching more either on our own time or on the  
channel I don't know but I'll probably just watch 
it it was very informative it was a shocker to me  
it was um the craziest like thing that I have as 
far as the story along these lines of wiping your  
butt in weird ways like I had to go to a program 
when I was younger uh with a group of kids and  
it was traveling through the woods and canoeing 
down a river and so there were no bathrooms so we  
had to dig our own hole and bury our poop in the 
woods so animals wouldn't be attracted to it and  
it was just so different from what I grew up doing 
that the first few times I just I was I mean you  
have to go out into the woods by yourself and but 
it just you're out in the open and it just feels  
like somebody's watching you the entire time and 
just burying your own poop like that and they did  
give us toilet paper to use luckily uh we didn't 
have to use like leaves or anything like that you  
know maybe they I don't know maybe they didn't 
trust us to find the right types of leaves yeah  
because kids you could wipe your butt with the 
wrong leaf and have a horrible rash for a long  
time get that poison ivy a real magic Dipper to 
get that rash to go away that would be horrible  
but this is not like an out this is like your 
situation all the time this is just something  
that I had to go experience for a few weeks 
this is like the way that they live all the  
time which is like such a shock to me mhm just we 
appreciate them putting this video on because she  
was very open in what she was talking about and 
I feel like when you're talking about something  
especially this you can't really sugar coat it 
or you can't really use code words like when you  
you just got to be direct about it especially 
when you're giving information to people so I  
really appreciate their openness and opening up 
to us and letting us know what it's like for them  
and also for the other people that live in the 
Philippines but I I enjoyed that a lot it was  
definitely an eye opener on you know different 
ways that people live but what is my experience  
camping probably and the last time that I remember 
was when we went to uh the keys to visit your mom  
and we went to the island and we camped on it and 
they brought a Lowe's bucket and I was like what  
are we what are we supposed to do with this but 
literally that's where we went to the bathroom  
and I don't even remember going on that island wow 
I just remember peeing and it was so uncomfortable  
because I'm just not that person I can't do it 
I I I get stage fright I get uncomfortable I'm  
looking around me there's bugs you know like 
it's it's a whole different situation but wow  
I forgot all about that we did we camped on just 
an island for 3 days with no there's no bathrooms  
there's nothing out there so we had to bring our 
own jugs of water of fresh water Y and I think I  
might have just held held it the whole three days 
I don't remember I mean going P is easy uh number  
two I think I might have just held it cuz I have 
no recollection of going on that island yeah I I  
definitely held it I just went number one because 
I don't I couldn't do that no thank you it was  
a small island too okay there was nowhere to go 
and like get your privacy no not at all no oh my  
goodness wow this was very interesting definitely 
something that you don't think about when you're  
thinking about traveling to another country it's 
like something that kind of just skips over your  
mind like oh I'm just going to go to the bathroom 
and it's going to be just like I do at home no  
not when you go to the Philippines to depending on 
where you go anyways yeah like she said uh it gets  
it sounds like it gets worse and worse and weirder 
and weirder depending on where you where you are  
going to be visiting but man wow the magic Dipper 
it helps you not to take what you have for granted  
for sure and it's it's easy to do that when you 
live every day and you get into the habit and  
you're just used to doing things a certain way and 
then you hear somebody else has to do it a certain  
way and they're used to doing it that way like 
that's normal for them um I just those is very  
eye opening very it was a culture shock if we were 
ever to go there without watching this video we I  
would be just my eyes were very open definitely 
they were very wide during this video at times  
wow the biggest shock to me is just using your 
hand like I water we have Beday here I've never  
used one but I've heard of them okay they just 
like shoot water up at your butt and clean you  
I still don't know how they work cuz it's just 
it doesn't make sense but but I've never used  
one of those but the water thing it's like okay 
you're going to just rinse yourself with water  
but getting your hand your your raw hand involved 
it's it's wow I did not expect that I feel like a  
little kid are talking about bathroom and butts 
and going poo every time he said that too I  
was giggling a little bit just because just the 
word I it just makes me turn into like a little  
immature kid like seriously she talking about 
butts oh my gosh that was so funny it was like  
very informative but it was just also funny uh 
yeah thank you guys for that video and yeah we're  
subscribed we'll look forward to more content from 
you everybody else watching we hope you enjoyed  
don't forget to go and support them directly 
and we'll see you on the next one bye friends
