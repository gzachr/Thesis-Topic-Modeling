OKAY GUYS!
GLOCO said that he's on his way.
But he's going to be late
because of the heavy traffic in EDSA.
ANYWAY~
since we're already here in MegaMall
WHERE SHOULD WE EAT?
We'll eat in "Mang Inasal",
PM2 WITH UNLI RICE
(silence)
My Fuhrer...
uhh..
Unli-rice is...
Unli-rice is now banned by the government
All thanks to Cynthia Villar
(long silence)
(dead inside)
(long silence)
You'll have to stay...
Keitl
Yorjel
Kreps
and Burgdorf
(everyone leaves except them)
(door slam)
WHAT THE FUCK YOW?!
WHAT THE FLYING SHITTY FUCK YOW?!
For fucks sake!
Out of all the shitty problems in our country,
they paid more importance to THIS?!
And my daughter was supposed to celebrate her Debut there!
(cries)
Do they have any idea how expensive rice is?
I swear if I see that stupid cynthia villar-
I'm gonna have her chug down chicken oil
UNTIL SHE F*K-ING DROWNS!
Boss, she told everyone that eating vegetables is a better-
SHUT!
THE FUCK
UP!
YOU KNOW NOTHING!
But Boss, you could get diabetes!
I ALREADY KNOW THAT!
I LEARNED IT WHILE I WAS IN NURSING!
ITS! B*LL SHT!
I ALWAYS HAVE MY CHECKUP WITH MY DOCTOR
EVERY MONTH!
AND HE SAID THAT MY BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL IS NORMAL
SO DON'T TEACH ME A LESSON 'BOUT DIABETES!
And I'm pretty sure that I won't get Diabetes Type II
Because it's not like I'm eating Unli-rice everyday!
Damn it, dude!
I'M NOT THAT RICH!
F*ING SHT!
They're so stupid!
I WANT TO F-ING DIIIIIEEEE~~
How the hell are you supposed to finish a big-ass piece of chicken with only one cup of rice?!
I LUST OVER RICE!
just kidding~
But seriously,
If I see that bitch-
I'll make her eat vegetables right from my ass!
Let's see how she'll like my ORGANIC SALAD with Mustard dressing on top~
Or maybe we should eat HER instead?
I'm sure her meat would taste good, right?
It's okay Ana, they still have Unli-GRAVY in KFC
How could they do this to the Filipinos?
you know...
I was supposed to eat 10 cups of rice today...
Or nine...
I wanted to eat till I puked.
I'm gonna eat everything,
even the bones!
Start cooking some rice
We're gonna bring a pot of rice over there
and no one will stop us!
But their soup still tastes like socks...
f-ing disgusting
