>> So, why should you care about
what happens in the Philippines?
For one, we spend the most time
on the internet.
More than ten hours a day.
We spend the most time on
social media globally.
And as we found out,
lies laced with anger and hate
spread fastest.
When you only look at content,
it's a Whac-a-Mole game.
I want to figure out
what the lie is,
then look at the network that
spreads the lies.
That's the nervous system.
We started looking
at one account
that was attacking,
"All journalists are corrupt."
One account that had
25 followers.
They were all following
each other.
We fact-checked
every single item.
These were all fake accounts.
We began to count and found that
26 fake accounts
can influence up to
three million other accounts.
Three million.
I think the first attacks,
this word "presstitutes,"
you can even track this word.
Mocha Uson starts
to popularize "presstitutes,"
Thinking Pinoy picks it up,
then it's repeated
a million times.
To make you distrust
institutions,
to shift the way you think.
In May 2017, we did a story
on the transcript
of Trump's call with
President Duterte.
"'Rappler' just made the
Philippines a legitimate target
of North Korean
nuclear missiles."
It's laughable,
but people believe it.
It jumped to,
"I can smell an arrest
and possible closure of
Rappler.com."
Then from there, we go to
sexualized attacks.
Fuel misogyny-- women are
a favorite easy target.

it took them another two years

what happens in America

Just earlier this month,
I spent time with the Cambridge

Christopher Wylie.
The whistleblower said
they tested the tactics
of how to manipulate you
in our countries.
And in other countries in the
global South.
And the reason why he said that
was because our,
we don't, we don't have
strong governments.
They can get away with impunity,
and then if it worked in our
countries,
then they would, his word was,
"port" it over to you.
So the first step is,
I think we have to realize that
something horrific has
already happened.
And that we are
at this existential moment
where, if nothing significant
is done,
journalism is only the
first part.
Journalism, and democracy
