foreign
yeah how are you chilling inside  
because you know the Philippines it's hot yeah 
it's so hot sorry about that just now uh yeah
it's about I don't know it's okay mind if I 
stop vlogging yeah okay all right so as you  
can see in the background here we've got some 
tricycle we've got some jeepney meaning that  
I've just left BGC and today we're doing 
something very special I'm here with my  
friend is it jello jello yeah I was thinking 
like yellow yes okay jello jello so uh we're  
gonna do a uh illegit experience I'm trying to 
pronounce it yeah Karen Dairy okay it's my first  
time trying it as well so I don't know what kind 
of like Filipino dishes I'm gonna try today I'm  
gonna trust you okay I'm gonna recommend some 
good things okay let's go all right let's go  
yeah so this area is actually uh Makati and 
today the Korean corindaria that we're trying  
today it's called salt sausage so yeah it's 
my first time here at the current area so I'm  
very excited to try and apparently Mark Williams 
actually came here before so um all right let's  
have a look they're in there okay carindaria all 
right let's see oh yeah so this is literally yeah
are the locals do it okay I want to live 
like a local today so uh let's try it
I actually have never seen this food before 
so yeah so it's gonna be very new to me yeah
so basically is the point what you want 
Oh do not too long yeah okay all right  
that sounds interesting most of these 
are Filipino food like we have the fish
skewers okay oh what is this
all right fish right between coconut 
milk coconut milk okay is there a  
key ingredient okay then the rest 
usually are pork okay so this is  
sweet is it like grilled sweet yeah 
and what is this one this one is oh
today
okay I trust you yeah yeah I'm 
just gonna go with the flow today  
wow a lot of people working in 
the background and so I realized
when you come with your local friends 
and I know exactly what to do because  
otherwise if me and Alina come along 
we'll be so confused but yeah luckily  
we come with our jello today is 
it what's the island called again
the meats that we ordered it's it's puppies yeah 
what does that mean like some organs you said yeah  
it looks like seasick but uh I think all of 
the ingredients are like the internal organs  
right okay I usually don't ask what as well so my 
friends do not know yeah yeah fair enough I think  
even in Hong Kong we eat a lot of like internal 
organs especially beef yeah like the the liver  
tribes I think you guys that you don't want but 
uh chicken feet as well so like chicken feeders  
okay I have I'm brave today so I'm gonna try 
some I think that's gonna be so easy for you  
yep and we ordered uh like the important one 
we saw in the video yeah I I think that's one  
of their best sellers yeah okay all right yeah 
but I know I think you've noticed that Filipinos  
really love their meats yeah I I know it is yeah 
yeah there are only a few vegetable options here  
like like vegetarians find it difficult yeah 
they come here in the Philippines all right
yeah okay
yeah so this is the setup usually 
of how locals do it yeah mostly all  
streets you're gonna see something like 
this yeah a lot of smoke going around I  
think it attracts people to come to the 
store Yeah so basically it's like uh
uh their lunch is it like normally like 
relatively more affordable than like other  
places or is it like how are prices like here oh 
I think it's really uh it's really cheap thank  
you it's really cheap like most uh employees or 
drivers so they choose this kind of place because  
especially in Manila when you go to a restaurant 
yeah yeah it's really expensive here like yeah  
as compared to the provinces so this is 
really a good option for students wow
it looks amazing you've got a lot 
of calamasi and Chile over there  
got muscles this is a staple staple okay yeah 
right true in every restaurant I see this one yeah
usually dip everything I know it is 
soy sauce yeah my favorite exactly  
lowest subscriber yeah I watch your videos 
I think it's still your number one really  
uh yeah it's still my number one I think mine 
now so um but yeah lots of really interesting  
looking dishes and I look forward to 
this one squids there are a lot of
but this one is a little bit bigger than 
those right this is the one of the best  
yeah okay this piece on the reviews that's why 
we chose this one yeah um but you can see uh  
places like this like sometimes they're 
just houses yeah yeah like local houses
all right thank you oh this looks nice the polalo  
all right you have to take this one take this one 
it has more meat oh no let's share everything okay  
okay and uh this is for washing handle no this is 
oh no this is interesting right because in like  
I know the Chinese they were just like yeah and 
then we wash them there it's a bit different okay  
is it like we're just gonna wait for you so 
this is our Bobby's yes so like like what  
I said I don't know what's inside what's inside 
but it tastes good okay this is the chicken liver  
it's like a curry kind of thing it's 
more of like a fusion oh this is heart
never had that before everything's  
okay for you today so this is more 
like the standard way of cooking yeah
adobo adobo but with tomato sauce interesting 
right like Filipino style tomato sauce or normal  
tomato sauce yeah because I know Filipino 
is like rather sweet like Jollibee kind of  
yeah that's correct okay try it all right I'm 
excited to try so excited because there are so  
many dishes that I haven't seen in before in my 
life and uh yeah especially these two the colors  
are really nice the authentic experience like uh 
this is as local as you can get yeah that's what  
I'm looking forward Siri that's the thing about 
traveling you know you gotta go into the local  
areas and experience local culture I always want 
to find a traveling yeah if you've noticed like  
they're probably places like this but not so 
much exactly yeah because it's really set up like  
there's a modern city yeah so everything there is 
really uh fusioned with yeah modern stuff so yeah  
but this is how everything that's awesome yeah I'm 
really glad I'm here at the experience I think all  
of your subscribers will probably go to their 
local calendar yourself it is okay right guys  
um yeah don't eat people watching this 
video yeah you're gonna get hungry all right  
and uh I know that you are you like 
a pasta yeah yeah that's what I do  
yeah uh so basically that's why 
I usually on the birthday but on  
the weekends it's a little bit busy 
yeah yeah so I've been here in Manila
which is called uh The Culinary capital of the 
Philippines so most of the so most people who  
knows how to cook they say the best ones come 
from our problems oh okay yeah actually my mom  
has her own place like this yeah it's just 
that we just have we have to drive a little  
bit uh maybe next time we'll go there that'll be 
awesome because there are still a lot of different  
types of food for richer City so these are more 
the general Manila um maybe Philippine style  
right because you can see this mostly anywhere 
yeah but there are dishes that are usually uh
this looks so good like barbecue kind of  
belly it doesn't even look like pork Bell looks 
like um I don't know if you know it's like oh  
yeah yeah like barbecue Park in Hong Kong 
it looks very similar to them okay so you  
know how to do this now I think so I think so 
it's like it's just like yes okay oh thank you
you want in yeah
I remember because the first time when I had 
a chicken yeah and the people were like oh I'm  
watching in pain it's culture but I'm sure you got 
a lot of oh yeah I'm able to watch they say but  
um yeah I'm glad I learned it the hard way and 
um now I'm familiar with the flavors it tastes  
so much better right yeah definitely yeah I 
think it elevates adds a bit of like extra  
sourness into it so I could kill him and see no 
oh really lime the closest thing we thought was  
lime we were like why do you add lime there on 
the table like why is it there but okay why is  
it so small exactly yeah that's what we thought 
like this should be long and I Coca-Cola normally  
like live oh yeah okay so we can try some food 
all right I'll put this here so that we can see
I'm really excited to try it because the food 
just looks amazing and it is my first proper  
experience of trying local food actually 
oh really yeah because you add some on
yeah move the table a little bit
what okay okay
just be careful living on the edge wait what
yeah on the same side on the same side there you 
go okay awesome all right so it's gonna be a food  
episode and uh see all the food We've Got Rice 
mussels bolalo and mix uh Origins and uh Papito  
bits bobbits and Liam po we've got the cute 
squid real Grill Street as well so wow I never  
eaten so big Brews good people actually so uh all 
right let's try all right all right have you ever  
imagined anything beside the road literally 
no I have done like a local food in Thailand  
but not like this yeah south of the road so it's 
gonna be easy you start with the suit all right
all right make sure it's still 
recording okay cool it's time for soup
can I drink like this yeah that's how you do it 
oh really tasty right yeah strong pepper smell  
too yeah it's very strong flavors apologies my 
GoPro got cut off because it was overheated but  
basically the bolalo has so strong flavor it 
tasted very dense like it was cooked for many  
hours kind of reminds me the broth of Vietnamese 
pho it was very tasty yeah so we're just talking  
about like um I think yellow was very very 
happy to hear that I'm gonna stay here for  
the Philippines one year there's a lot more to 
see definitely many more to see because we've  
only been to Cebu Manila bottle that's it so and 
they are seven thousand islands exactly you cannot  
just leave right so yeah I really want to go to 
Boracay I heard a lot about the place yeah and  
um also El Nido Palawan those places gotta go 
in your lifetime I think solo photos online yeah
and even Manila I haven't been to like all the 
places yeah trying a lot of local food so yeah  
I think it'll be quite a good experience of 
Manila yeah um there are a lot of cities in  
the north yeah and even you know when you go 
north of the Philippines just by driving okay  
they're a lot more cheap
uh North North Carolina  
it's like a city that's completely different 
yeah yeah so it's colder yeah and I plan to go  
to Target as well yeah the guy there is near like 
especially right now which is less than two hours
yeah we're gonna go there next month actually 
I was just there two weeks ago no way yeah how  
was it it's really cold now really cold wait 
let me pull it yeah yeah good so I get you too  
or this one
that's cool whoa oh but it's not balanced 
that's better that's my phone right all  
right now I think you have to try this one 
okay all right super the difficult ones first  
for me it looks like minced beef so uh it's 
not that challenging yet I'll show you guys so  
um this looks like just means beef 
right but uh it's actually something  
else like August so all right 
let's try it I I think it's lumps
and everything else you can think of all right 
excited never tried these uh organs before so I  
was gonna go find a message all right let me 
put the camera that's right all right begin
I think for me every time when 
I eat something new it's just an  
interesting experience for me because 
even when I eat balut for me it was a  
just an interesting experience yeah because I 
don't know how it tastes like until I try it yeah  
and it's not everything to get to encounter 
exactly right yeah all right let's try this
what happened
oh slightly nice flavor right 
it reminds me of tofu actually  
but don't think about what it is wait I forgot 
what is this four piece um the the organ lungs  
lungs right interesting it tastes quite soft like 
tofu so um yeah it gives a bit of a cake I like it  
I think I like spicy food after going to 
Thailand traveling there for many months so  
um yeah it's good in the Philippines they 
are a few spicy dishes but not a lot right  
really a little bit but in Marina so everyone 
at the chili yeah right just a little bit  
it's a little bit not the spiciest Thailand 
North Korea yeah even Hong Kong they cannot  
eat spice usually oh so um I only filled up my 
spice tolerance when I went to Thailand after  
one month because in Thailand everything it's 
always spicy when you say can I have little  
spice paste it means super spices when you 
say no spice it's still spicy for some reason
crazy that's why when I went to Korea 
it was nothing anymore okay next dish
we can try this one all right let's quick ly
all right guys so you're even see 
the sweet ah just right here so  
first I'm trying cubic speed 
you think we can finish it
just for the flavor yeah so you don't eat it 
oh you can eat it okay right it's good as well
first time seeing like uh
like marinade inside
all right this morning when I had breakfast 
with Alina Alina was like where's my knife  
gotcha it's okay because I grew up 
using the [ __ ] soon to eat anyway  
and then this is the one that 
goes here ah make sense okay
sweet it's like you chew one thousand 
times you're chewing because that's  
right it's really good it feels 
like doing the beach right yeah  
how do you do this so tasty you brought me 
to the right place to uh it's a good question
I'll show you how soft it is so like this one 
cut done it's like a cake yeah it's like cake wow
yeah it's good because you're 
right there are some Village squid  
they're very hard for sure this is the 
softness I've ever had it's very tasty  
and it makes it really well the um hello 
masi and spicy sauce it really goes well
thank you so far what got your attention
um I'm saving the one for lunch yeah I 
think that one really caught my attention  
because the colors there just looks 
like barbecue box and I really love  
um but I think so far the sweet really is very 
impressive uh So Soft amazing and I guess like  
the this fish is this yeah the drop is the puppies 
I keep forgetting the name Bobby Bobby the Bobby  
is uh something new to me I would say I don't know 
if I like it or don't like it it's something in  
the middle something new yeah so it's spicy but uh 
interesting I would say yeah I don't necessarily  
um like think of it as long as you think of 
as a dish um that's new to me very interesting  
tofu oh we haven't tried chicken 
hot yet yes that's next oh okay
yeah I understand why a lot of 
people recommend this place again
it's just beside the street but the food 
speaks for yourself yeah yeah authentic
no it's your first time 
here as well this one right  
all the time right wow what 
happened this is the wind yeah
so um I was going to say 
something I got distracted
but yeah carindaria is definitely an 
interesting experience I would I think  
if you're an international visitor I think it's 
a good experience to come to a care India we just  
experience our local ETR want to start off the 
road with many like signature Filipino dishes  
as well and this is kind of experience that you 
don't get to eat when you're in BGC or like modern  
cities I think we have got one that's similar in 
uptown and it's like in a small food court there  
is something like this many trays yeah but it's 
still more high-end already yeah yeah you have  
those Jollibee like the small trailers who sell 
similar food right but again it's a little bit  
modern yeah right but the food everything the 
Filipino yeah actually uh Whenever there are  
people there are a lot of ofws right Filipinos 
working abroad usually when they come home
they say for Christmas many people 
they overseas they will come back  
to celebrate the family so this is the 
kind of food that they will have yeah  
Filipino food right and even like there are 
Filipino communities on different countries  
they set up places like this ah right 
that's Jollibee in this one Jollibee and
I was hoping there is more in Hong Kong 
Australia even yeah that'd be so nice yeah  
I think uh one thing that I have had a lot 
was definitely my nozzle I didn't need to  
give local food a chance as well yeah and now 
you're used to eating rice oh for sure I mean  
like I grew up eating rice it's a little bit 
more challenging just because I think growing  
up in Russia she doesn't eat a lot of rice 
it's different mostly just buckwheats and like  
um buckwheats or mashed potato so not a lot of 
pasta or rice in general so something different  
I noticed in the Philippines most restaurants 
they like many many many wise and spaghetti so  
yeah she's still getting used to it sorry 
Filipino style spaghetti exactly yeah  
we're trying to find like normal tomato but 
we just give up for like we don't want to try  
the Filipino style yeah usually you just get 
the real authentic Italian pasta restaurants  
yeah Italian restaurant yeah usually the 
reason why the Filipino spaghetti is sweet  
um usually it's keyboard for kids on parties 
right usually when a Filipino kid gets a  
birthday usually the wish is spaghetti really 
yeah it's like a birthday cake yeah with the cake  
but honestly it's spaghetti and fried chicken 
that's why I think if people like the taste of
I'm dying to try the second dish whoa 
you finish all your rides already yeah
chicken liver all right this is gonna be uh quite 
a man a bit of mental challenge but um let's try  
it let's try it okay let's dig in together or even 
like the nature joins us see like branches here  
okay
all right I'm a little bit nervous to be honest 
but uh well I think it's gonna be an interesting  
experience I think we need to uh you can show 
it first it's so clearly yeah chicken pot  
uh interesting I don't know okay all 
right anyway that's right one two three
come on
wow
tastes like a good quality uh chicken chicken 
chicken thigh I know it it was completely  
different to what I expected I thought the 
chicken pot would taste great mushy but oh  
wow interesting I well I didn't expect that 
really what about you that was really good I  
think even the sauce makes up for it yeah I agree 
yeah I didn't realize it's gonna be like that that  
um like chicken like boiled chicken Style 
yeah exactly I was very surprised okay
this one oh yeah oh the big chunk yeah my goodness 
all right all right I'm gonna put it back here
okay
actually can I get to you uh okay so that 
big pie is the liver so I'm gonna try it  
okay this looks a bit mushy this one so 
that's it go deep in the sauce um no okay
peace I like the sauce the sauce is amazing the 
texture it yeah I was right it was a bit mushy  
but it kind of reminds me of chicken breast now 
but uh it's more mushy the chicken breast I think  
overall liquid it doesn't taste that bad I guess 
it depends on the sauce as well the sauce will  
cook really well so overall the dish like really 
elevated the organs yeah yeah I like it personally
I'm surprised but uh yeah I guess 
you don't know it until you try it so  
yeah so usually the reason why 
Philippines so it's your release like this
because Filipinos didn't really um we're not 
used to having a lot as a people like even even  
historically so usually we try to not waste any 
part yeah of the meat yeah I know that because uh  
from people when we look for apartments we stayed 
at an area called like a hotel called My Town New  
York on my state which is a bit out of beaches in 
the local area and very often walk past the fresh  
market and we saw pig heads outside and for me 
I'm just not very used to seeing this because I  
know that Filipinos they use um so that's what 
I'm assuming that's why they got that you know  
originally came from The Province I'm talking 
about oh right yeah yeah your area your area  
invented there even before using a 
recipe for season has chicken liver
a little bit creamy
it's a little bit mushy right yeah
blend it yeah
makes sense like mince kind of thing all 
right but that big head yeah it's just uh  
we're walking on A Street Castle you one 
day we're so happy and we're just so easy  
I know it's like a horror movie big face 
yeah so um yeah that's something that we  
uh you gotta get used to when you come 
to the Philippines as a International
get a lot of Filipino numbers yeah
oh yeah yeah everything even blood oh yeah
I guess it's sort of a bit similar to most 
Asian Styles actually but I think Philippines  
have seen more organs yeah all right right we 
saved the best for the last let's see if it's  
left up to uh yeah the expectation looks good 
though it looks amazing all right let's try it
So Soft I like it wait
ah too much okay
oh
okay this doesn't justify because I dropped 
the meat inside so it's so salty now okay  
I'm gonna have another one it's crispy 
though and the meat itself is a little  
bit salty so right that's right okay 
let's try one without the soy sauce yeah
one without a salsa
this orange stone it's already 
so delicious yeah yeah wow
you remind me of something like very tasty 
exchange rate yeah that's really tasty coming  
in Hong Kong we eat something called the pork 
neck yeah it kind of reminds me a little bit  
um but you do pork neck softer but this is so 
nice the the crisp on the skin yeah very nice  
okay yep okay you guys see all the smoke there or 
the lambo it's cooking over there so um foreign
Magic
just not I think Philippines we haven't 
noticed a lot of veggies yeah yeah
really something common that's 
why actually it's a little bit  
more expensive yeah I know that but of 
course there's a lot like you have yeah
vegetables vegetables we have to pour some 
along like the eggplant sorry the egg oh yeah
then we have more of the Chinese things going 
with like chop suey it's also mixed vegetables
um
and most vegetables that you get 
in silica ah yeah fair enough  
I mean yeah it's good that they put a Veg 
it's usually pick um like is it cabbage  
yeah in bolalo which is a good I think one 
reasons why last time we ordered because  
it's all veggies meat in their soups everything 
is balanced so all of that one but in terms of  
yeah salad it's not coming in a Philippines so 
one thing we notice as you said is we went to  
grocery shopping because we always buy veggies 
and meat at the same time we noticed veggies  
regardless of whether it's import or like even 
local Metro it's rather more cost more foreign
onions right yeah oh
do you know the reason why um craving 
they said a lot of traders who ordered  
all of the supply Yeah so basically 
they messed up the the supply chain  
yeah set up right yeah them them I 
guess uh no it's easy for a while
uh what we've tried here I 
think is just some of the  
um other food but there are a lot more when you 
go when you go to bring provinces right we haven't  
tried vehicle Express and the more spicy one um 
and then and then they also have like versions  
you know when you go to different places they have 
their own version of the city yeah they have their  
own version of uh liempo yeah so it's really but 
these are the more standard ones I agree yeah I  
think I've seen like something similar colors in 
like most uh like the herindarius yeah like the  
orange color and the yellow color the curry you 
know what these orange ones they are different
I think there there are four types sitting on the 
meat that you use but it's the same sauce amazing  
and usually I think there is a like adobo as 
well adorable as well has different kinds of  
versions has different kinds of versions 
that's right yeah there's Tamarind there's  
uh Sun Bowl So based on what souring agents 
use I know tamarine is the most common one
which is like a green uh like it's in mini mini 
cucumber that that's that's how it looks and  
then watermelon yeah yeah but I was thinking like 
watermelon not even sour not even sour so where  
does the sour Asian come from yeah I think it has 
a little bit uh cameras right but the most common  
one actually is the one you buy in those things 
it's just a powder oh yeah fair enough I think  
that's the most recommended way of cooking yeah 
you're actually trying to cook City gun at home  
yeah we're planning to make an episode about it 
and we're asking like what kind of ingredients do  
we need um they say oh just buy powder powder 
to make your life easier is it a lot harder  
if you use uh yeah because you have you have to 
like there's another process for it but I think  
it's worth it I think it's just different yeah 
when it's cooked and thick I think you can do it  
I think so I think you can because it's just 
it's not that hard it's just a little extra step  
okay all right cine gang here we come here oh 
but so far what do you say I think uh yeah I  
think this is the first time I've been trying 
like really offensive local food and I must say  
it's like beer I think it's a little bit different 
to the kind of Filipino people that I had at man  
um it's a little bit different I think here 
you get to eat the more like Street flavors  
like not there's an end it are more Street 
flavored style food in a way because I when  
in my travels I usually like the extreme style 
football simply because it's uh more close to  
the local experience and we find out the 
culture of the people exactly like for  
example just eating a normal skewers like 
on the streets um yeah that really shows
yeah show a different perspective of Philippines 
and yeah like I wouldn't have known about the  
calamasi with uh the dips if it wasn't 
because of this YouTube channel really  
yeah it's something that you cannot like you can 
read online but not a lot of tourists would like  
do that I think anything one good thing as 
well is extremely recommended to go with the  
locals yeah because it's safe relatively safe 
in the Philippines but because sometimes when  
you go to streets yeah inner streets like this 
it's just really better have somebody take you  
around and you know let's do uh like give you the 
context exactly if you're trying right you even  
know what you're ordering yeah just now if I was 
coming here alone I'll probably order what's this  
one yeah I'll probably just even order one dish I 
won't even try everything but yeah I like I like  
the orderings today got a huge diversity of uh 
different like meats and areas uh these are mostly  
pork this is this is beef beef yeah there you are 
right yeah I even got Seafood there I don't got to  
eat every day this is the chicken we have yeah 
oh yeah the pork chicken beef everything here  
awesome I think now let's just enjoy food yeah and 
have some bro talk all right see you guys in a bit  
so uh really delicious Filipino meal just on the 
side of the road so really interesting current  
area experience that you don't get the experience 
everywhere else in the world but uh Jello actually  
is so nice uh he shouted me out the meal so it 
was uh thank you so much man so yeah and even  
offered me to buy me a drink after after lunch as 
well so uh now now I'm gonna go and buy you come  
on drinks ice cream as well on me and uh whoa 
sometimes oh local Street Food yeah that's uh  
crack I think I've had it once yeah last time 
I had it I thought it was Fishbowl but anyway
that's it for this Vlog and uh back to 
aircon because outside was so hard but  
uh hope you guys enjoyed this episode 
and I'll see you guys next time goodbye
