welcome and today we are heading to Cebu City 
we're going to see whether you should go if  
you're traveling the Philippines we've never been 
there so we're interested to see what it's like  
and whether you should stay for a night or two 
we are currently in the middle of bowhole near  
Carmen so we've got to get a bus and then a 
ferry over to Cebu so let's start the journey
so after that crazy minibus ride he was 
driving so fast but at least we got here  
quick we're getting the 1040 Ferry it's over 
to Cebu City so this is going to be cool  
um yeah excited to get this Ferry I think it's 
like more of a local one it costs 800 pesos  
which is like 11 quid every Ferry we've got in 
the Philippines you always get a terminal fee  
as well I don't know why they don't just add 
it to the ticket but yeah that's what they do  
so we've got to go get that so we can go to 
the toilet and stuff uh we got our tickets  
thank you so we had to pay for 100 peso each 
from the bags and then 30 pesos for terminal  
fee I don't know why they just don't add it 
in altogether but that's what we had to do
so we're just harassed by loads of people but now 
we are in Cebu City which is going to be awesome  
uh no thank you no
so we have just checked into our Mad Monkey hostel 
here in subu city it's a pretty nice place it's  
got like good bear toilet all that stuff and now 
we're gonna head to SM City which is like the big  
mall because hopefully it's going to be Christmasy 
and we want to check out the city let's go  
so we've just started walking we're gonna try 
and find a taxi but there's none in the area  
at the moment but we'll try and flag one down 
in a minute so we have just come into the SM  
City and this place is packed it is a Sunday 
so it's super busy but I actually need to try  
and get a new GoPro because I broke my other one 
in uh shower GAO if you watch that video so whoa
thank you so I am now on the new GoPro the 
hero 11. how does it look does it look cool  
the guys were so helpful in there and yeah 
basically sorted it all out and finally got  
a new GoPro after breaking it in shower girl so 
it is the next day we had lots of stuff to do  
um around and like get a new GoPro get some new 
flip-flops but it's actually quite hard walking  
around Cebu like there's so much going on and 
there's not really any Pavements here either
buco so we just saw some guy chopping the Coconuts 
in the street I don't know where if there's like  
a main center of the town I just don't really 
know where to go really when we're after the  
hostel where we should go no one really told us 
anywhere they just told us like San Pedro Port  
which is near where we got the ferry one of the 
funny things I've seen on Tick Tock is that in the  
Philippines they have a lazy way of saying hello 
and that's just like raising their eyebrows and I  
see it all the time now after I've seen that Tick 
Tock and it's just so funny so I've started doing  
it back like hey and yeah it's just a nice way of 
acknowledging people but not saying anything look  
at all the wires there's so much electricity 
going on there's also a storm at the back  
whoa if that storm hits these wires electricity 
is going to go off I don't want to be around here
so they are the classic jeepneys that's 
like the best way of getting around town  
and it's really cheap as well we got 
one when we're in camiguin Island  
um and they you kind of just hop on and 
then hop off and they're yeah really  
good value for money but there's 
so many in Cebu here's another one
it is definitely warmer in Cebu than it was on the 
islands like you can feel the humidity and like  
I don't know maybe a bit of pollution and stuff 
it's just hot out here I'm sweating already hello  
nope okay
hello
there is loads of construction going on back 
there where there was a big crane there's a  
couple of big cranes going on here so maybe 
this city is developing quite a bit and you  
know in five years it could be a bit more 
modern or just like more going on I don't  
know but I also want to say I think our 
hostile Mad Monkey hostel is located in  
a really bad location it just feels like 
it's in the sub herb somewhere and it's  
not really in the center of town or where 
you can see some of the good sights so yeah  
I think that's something where we're staying 
does affect like what we've seen of this city  
one of the cool things is you also get loads of 
bakeries in the Philippines and if you want to  
have a really cheap breakfast there's a Backpacker 
we don't want to spend much money then you can  
just buy them for like a few pesos each for like 
a little bit of sweet stuff so yeah that's one way  
for a cheap breakfast here oh so we are back in 
the hotel room honestly it is hot out there thanks  
to the AC it's actually manageable so I wanted to 
have a little chat with you about Cebu City and  
whether you should come here because obviously 
you've kind of seen the area now but should you  
come here should you stay a night two nights three 
nights so what I'd recommend is probably saying  
just one night in Cebu City so there are a few 
things you can do like Fort San Pedro which is  
like a 1700 Fort um which is where we arrived on 
the ferry and you can all so go to SM City which  
is a massive mall and there's also a new SM City 
which we haven't been to but it looks loud looks  
really impressive so a lot of the things to do in 
Cebu are actually out of the city itself so you  
need to get like transport out so maybe recommend 
staying other places we're going to be heading  
to mobile next which is like I think a three or 
four hour bus journey and in Mobile there's lots  
of different waterfalls hikes like canyoneering 
obviously and I'll be doing more videos on that  
shortly if you've just landed in Cebu whether you 
come from Manila or it's somewhere internationally  
then I would only recommend staying one night 
and then head to Mobile Bowl hole or city hall  
or whatever you're planning to go next because 
you can't just use this as one night and then  
go off also we're staying in Mad Monkey hostel and 
I wouldn't really recommend it like it's actually  
not been great I think it's fairly good for social 
but everything else has been pretty run down I  
just wouldn't recommend staying here I'm sure 
there's much better hostels you can stay in Cebu  
especially if you're on a budget they overcharge 
on food they even charge for water which is it  
actually mandatory in the film a pinster and 
provide service water if you're at a restaurant  
or a bar so there you go so I hope that was useful 
whether you should stay in Cebu City honestly just  
the one night two nights maximum and you'll be 
good that'll be enough in the city thank you
