Let's learn how to be a backpacker
Pandhu is sick
This is my 1st time got sick while backpacking
Fourth day
I wanna die :(
My stomach's getting sick, 20 hours boat trip
This is how he looks
He couldn't handle anymore
On the way to the guesthouse
How much we need to pay this ride?
60 pesos, 1 dollar
I think it's a floating house, I saw pictures in the website
Kids
Looks like my hometown
Good morning
Sorry yesterday I didn't vlog on the 1st day in Coron, because I was totally sick
Some kind of fever, high level one
But today I'm better
We'll go island hop to around 5 spots
Now I wanna give a bit tips for you guys who are too lazy to take shower, like me
We can use a baby powder
For shampo!
My hair now is so messy. 3-4 days haven't wash my hair
Just put the powder on your hair
It's alot softer now than before
Good luck !
Hey guys today I'm getting better after yesterday almost die, forgot to bring the herbal medicine
We're gonna do TOUR A CORON to around 5 spots. Cost 750 pesos, or around 20 USD
Worth the experience
1 island to another is far. So it's not possible to do an indie trip, unless you want to rent and hire the whole boat for you
So this tour we take is a 'open trip', we're gonna share the journey with other travellers
Thanks for watching this video. Tomorrow we're gonna explore more
Make sure to subscribe so you won't miss the updates
We're gonna fine dinning
But this is cheap. Still good for backpacker
Because Coron is actually touristic eventhough it looks like village near the sea
Hard to find street foods
Almost only restaurants. So you need to smart to choose which one is nice and cheap
This one is cheap
Around 2 USD, with this view
Don't forget to give a like for this video :D
