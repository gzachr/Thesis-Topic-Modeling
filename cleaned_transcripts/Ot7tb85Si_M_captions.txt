in this video we're going to be talking 
about where filipinas can be found  
who are looking to meet some foreigners before 
we get started this is michael here and our goal  
in this channel is to be able to give you guys 
information if you're a foreigner an expert expat  
looking to find yourself a filipina whether to 
date to marry or just to actually have some fun so  
let's go ahead and go straight into the content 
but before that don't forget to subscribe with  
this channel and also click that bell icon to be 
notified of any new videos that we're releasing  
and we will be releasing three to four videos 
every week starting this year so let's go ahead  
and get started first things first before you 
start looking for that filipina to to hang out  
with whether just to chill and have fun to start 
dating make them your girlfriend or eventually  
find your wife you need to first ask yourself 
which one of those three is you as a person  
are you ready to settle down and marry 
someone or do you still want to just look  
for somebody to date or are you looking for 
somebody just for a quick having fun hook up  
you have to make that decision first you have to 
have a clear vision of what you guys want once you  
made that decision now i'm going to share with 
you guys what you guys can do from there right  
so and what i'm going to share with you guys 
are things that i've you know information i  
got from other foreigners and expats but 
at the very same time as information that  
i've experienced myself you know haven't been 
able to come to the philippines several times and  
is currently here right now at this very moment 
so let's go ahead and get started the first place  
okay or the first set we need to find out is you 
need to figure out first what city do you want to  
go to okay what city it is first and it's not just 
what city but do you want like a metropolitan area  
or do you want more of like a small provincial 
area that's the first thing right what where do  
you want to go so i'm going to share with you guys 
several of the you know cities whether it's large  
cities or small cities you know that i've been to 
in the philippines but at the very same time as  
other cities that maybe i've never been to but 
i know foreigners are hanging out with because  
they're having good experiences there as well 
so the first main city to be honest where you  
should go is the metro manila area you know it's 
you have your makati you have your quezon city  
you know and these are the different places where 
you need to go and all those different things now  
the metro manila area the manila area is right 
smack where you know the where you land when you  
arrive in the philippines where the main airport 
is so manila area is the metro manila area is a  
really prime rich area to be able to find a 
lot of more modern filipinas as you can say  
when in this area i love quezon city i love 
the bgc area for example those are you know  
some great places to hang out with as well there's 
a lot of like nice cool places to go to their bars  
restaurants or what they call restos a little some 
nice small coffee shops as well you know juice  
bars and everything so you know i prefer being in 
a major city that's the type of person that i am  
um and just let you guys know if me sharing 
these stories i'm gonna about to do with you  
guys it's probably gonna get me in trouble 
with my girlfriend because she doesn't like  
hearing about you know my past stories but 
i'm doing this pretty much for you guys right  
another place i like to go another major city i 
want to go to i love used to love going to is the  
cebu area um now the way i compare cebu to the 
metro manila area is you know just think about  
new york as the first city and then you know 
chicago is considered the second city right  
um so cebu is like the second city compared to um 
manila area but there's the third major city or  
major area where it's moving up nowadays which 
is the davao area so a lot of the foreigners  
you know and expats that you see are pretty much 
concentrating themselves in the metro manila area  
cebu and the davao area as well now you know in 
cebu which is in the visayas region so first of  
all you have to understand in the philippines 
there's over 7100 islands and so they're kind  
of divided into three groupings that's your 
luzon which is in the north area besides the  
middle part of the philippines and the mindanao 
areas the southern part of the philippines  
um so cebu is in the visayas region um so there's 
um there's a separate island from cebu called you  
know and that's where dumaguete is so there's 
a lot of foreigners and expats for some reason  
that's going to the dumagueta area yeah you know 
it's a decent area um you know a lot of housing in  
there a lot of there's some nightlife stuff to do 
there as well but it it's more of like a smaller  
provincial type of uh area compared to a place 
like cebu and especially of course metro manila  
um we're seeing a lot of other foreigners like 
in the bakalad area um in the negros occidental  
area as they say and at the very same time is 
pretty much just all over the place another  
good place that i kind of enjoyed it's a 
very small city area it's in cagayan de oro  
and that's also a fun place to go to as well 
the thing though is when i was in kagandora i  
was visiting some friends of mine who 
were in special forces and they were  
unfortunately part of the skirmish going on when 
there was that little small mini war going on in  
marawi i think it was called and you know so 
you know it was it was an amazing time to to  
to go in the kageyande area but either or it's you 
just have to figure out what type of person you  
are now there's the good old place called angela 
city right and of course that's where you have  
your walking street so if you're one of those guys 
that just wants to come down to the philippines to  
have some fun you know walking street is a place 
where pretty much they say disneyland for for  
foreigners um in the philippines and so you know 
but at the very same time it's just because you're  
at angela city and you know one of their main 
attraction for tourists is the red light district  
that they have there that does not mean that all 
women live in angola city are you know are working  
girls so you know there's a lot of amazing stuff 
going on they actually had the like the sea games  
held in in the angeles area um which is like a 
you know like an asian olympics i guess you'll say  
and so you know endless city is starting to move 
up um and it's it's not just a place where you  
go to sow your wild oats as they may say or 
enjoy yourself in the red light district um but  
that's it all depends on what you are as well you 
know what's your what's your decision right um  
where you're trying to put yourself are you here 
to have fun and live a bachelor life are you here  
just to figure out somebody and date somebody 
or are you here to look for somebody who you  
eventually want to marry so you just have to you 
know i always tell people like if you're going to  
move here to the philippines you definitely want 
to first visit the philippines first and not just  
all of a sudden pack your bags and you hear all 
these you know you watch all these videos from  
all these other expats or foreigners or locals 
here and you just say okay i think philippines  
is for me let me move out there no come out here 
enjoy yourself you know because i know guys who  
you know who listen to to other um vloggers and 
they literally packed their bag they've been to  
manila or they've been to cebu but then all of a 
sudden they hear dumagueta is a good place to go  
to and they go there and they go crazy because 
they don't like the area right so you know if  
you're gonna move out here and go around first see 
where you feel is a good thing for you to be in  
and then commit to that but at the very same time 
as you know don't sign no long-term leases as well  
because you know it's nice to be able to just pack 
your bags and move somewhere automatically and  
that's honestly why i like the lauzon area because 
in the luzon area you know i can be in the metro  
manila then all of a sudden if i want to i can 
hang out and be in angela city if i don't want to  
be in hangout city i go to subic bay i can go to 
baguio you know it's it's a bigger land so you can  
do there's a lot of transportation you go so 
many different places easily you can hang out in  
casual city you can be in metro manila you can 
go a little bit down south and hang out in the  
gaitai hang out in the cavite area in the laguna 
area there's just so much stuff to do in the  
luzon part that's why i prefer being in the luzon 
region compared to the visayas or the mindanao's  
um there's also a lot of people that are going to 
behold bohol is also another island separate from  
cebu and it's just pretty much a ferry ride over 
so there's a lot of a good amount of uh foreigners  
and expats that are living there as well um so 
just just pretty much depends on what you want to  
be now that's the first step is figuring out the 
city figuring out um you know if you want a more  
secluded provincial type of a feeling or do you 
want the city life but let's start talking about  
you know where you can find a bunch of filipinas 
now you know one thing i tell you guys filipinas  
are are amazing women and they just want to 
be able to meet someone to fall in love with  
that's going to take care of them that's 
going to give them comfort that's going to  
protect them right but there is a large surge 
of you know because of the globalization of  
the world nowadays you know filipinos it's 
it's starting to become a normal thing where  
you see a filipino with a foreigner and a lot 
of filipinos are looking to meet with orders  
and because of also like i've said in several 
other videos where you know a lot of filipinas  
are really starting to get turned off by the local 
filipinos and they would just rather have the  
idea of being with a foreigner because it's just 
number one the idea that they have a foreigners  
is all positive most of the time and at the 
very same time is you know a lot of filipinos  
will sometimes won't admit this but they'll 
say privately is that they want their kids to  
be mixed race because you know when when when 
a filipino is kind of a mixed race especially  
you know mixed with a lighter skin uh or just 
a different you know gives them a different  
mix makes them different they just have a better 
status standing here in the philippines you know  
that's why if you watch a lot of the entertainment 
here you see a lot of the actors a lot of the you  
know a lot of the singers here musicians a 
lot of the people that become famous here  
are actually mixed race filipinos okay so you 
know the first place that you can definitely  
find a lot of filipina are the malls like compared 
to the u.s where you know i think they said like  
by 2025 about 30 of all the malls in the united 
states is gonna shut down here in the philippines  
malls are opening left and right i mean and so 
you know the best place to find somebody that you  
want to be with is where people gather right 
and the malls are a perfect place to go into  
now you know if you start asking me this 
question well michael okay you told me  
where to go you told me to go here you told me to 
live there how do i meet them well that's going  
to be a little bit of a longer video and we'll 
definitely come up with more videos like that  
for you guys to show you guys what i've done in 
the past i'll share my a little few tidbits here  
in this video that i'm sure i'm doing right now 
with you guys but the malls are great places you  
know and the third place is coffee shops now yeah 
the malls have coffee shops right and so that's so  
you definitely will meet girls in coffee shops and 
at the very same time as i'm going to add a little  
like little thing here for you guys who are you 
know planning to do some bachelor stuff here  
you'll be surprised if you hang out at a 
coffee shop and you definitely are a foreigner  
um and you want to meet somebody i guess to 
approve a girl who's going to approach you  
just hang out outside the coffee 
shop don't hang out inside trust me  
you know if you're like in the bgc area in the 
quezon city area in the moa which is mall of asia  
um and you're in the outside portion 
of things somebody will approach you  
if once again you're here for some fun and 
bachelor stuff if you don't want to go to  
um those red light districts i've been approached 
so many times at those places it's like the  
weirdest things i mean there's this coffee shop 
that i um when i come to kazoo city for example  
and i hang out there um there's a starbucks there 
right on what they it's pretty much off t mug and  
thomas morata right and the starbucks there right 
it's called imperial uh plaza and guaranteed  
at nighttime over there there's gonna be 
some girls that's gonna be approaching you  
um what's really nice is um the guard the security 
guard for that starbucks you know he knows i'm not  
into that kind of stuff and so if i get approached 
he just pretty much shoots them away kind of um  
because i just go to starbucks just to enjoy 
myself and have fun but you know talking about  
starbucks you know i've met you know i've i've 
met a lot of women in starbucks myself you know  
um and the the most important thing is 
just to approach somebody and talk to them  
um but like i said we're gonna go through the more 
tactics and tips on how to approach women and talk  
to them in these type of places that's perfectly 
fine but yeah you know i literally you know was in  
a starbucks it was a it was a two-floor starbucks 
i was in the second floor and you know i was um  
i was uh just having a smoke um and literally i 
was just having coffee and you know these these  
these girls were just having a conversation 
you know she you know they were hanging out  
with some friends and i just literally said like 
hey listen it seems like you guys are having fun  
that's amazing other than the fact that you're 
having fun can you share something with me of  
something that i can do in the area that's a 
good place to eat you know and i started talking  
to this one girl and she said well you know this 
this is a good place to eat like great well let me  
go ahead and go over there i was like you know 
what since i'm going there do you want to come  
join me for a quick meal and maybe have some good 
conversation with that as well and she said yeah  
and so we ended up going to that place and 
that became pretty much our first date of um  
but nothing serious came of it we'll just say that  
um because i'm gonna get in trouble uh sharing 
this sharing this conversation but those are  
the simple things that you guys can do and go to 
places and starbucks is a great place to go to  
and what's even nice about in the philippines is 
that there are other than the fact that starbucks  
is everywhere but i actually like going to these 
um unique boutique uh coffee shops and they're all  
over the place here it's it's it's such an amazing 
thing i i love going to unique coffee shops  
because i just like to just chill just have some 
good coffee and those are great places to go to  
as well and you know people go there to chill like 
a lot of people think that when you you come here  
to the philippines if you want to meet yourself a 
woman you know well go to the bar go to the clubs  
well you don't have to you can 
go you can meet people everywhere  
the you know what's the best pickup line 
ever hello my name is michael what's yours  
simple don't try to come up like oh my god 
does your back hurt no oh it hurt it doesn't  
hurt because you know it looks like you 
hurt yourself when you fell from the sky  
you know stupid pickup lines i i can't even say 
it correctly you guys are probably laughing at  
me right now because i don't do pick-up lines 
just have a conversation that literally is the  
best thing ever just say hello and most men can't 
even say that to a woman that they're attracted to  
quick tip also if you see a woman and you are 
attracted to her and you want to converse with her  
the moment you see her you have 15 to 20 seconds 
to make an action and say hello and if you don't  
you're going to create your inner objections 
to not even approach her you're going to start  
saying well she probably has a boyfriend or she's 
probably busy or she probably doesn't want to  
talk to you she's probably not attracted to me 
she's probably bisexual she's probably lesbian  
you know you're gonna start coming up with so many 
different things before you even can approach her  
you see a woman you like her your approach that's 
tip of the day but we're gonna have more videos of  
tips and you know how to be able to approach women 
or you know how to deal yourself when you're in  
a bar we'll come up with those later on but right 
now i just want to be able to tell you guys where  
you can find filipino women's that are looking 
for foreigners coffee shops malls and another  
place that's growing a lot here in the philippines 
are what they call tea shops milk tea shops where  
you know they they sell those you know um like 
frappes or tea and cream tea infusions milk teas  
and they put those bobas or these big tapioca 
balls and they give you these large ass straws  
to drink them and just don't choke to death those 
places are fun to go to also the next thing is  
obviously definitely restos it's pretty much short 
for um restaurants that has a bar in it as well  
um so a lot of resto places here you can go there 
people are hanging out at night time there's good  
food uh there's some drinks so you can definitely 
meet people and what i like about rustos over  
clubs is the fact that it's more chill i'm one 
of those guys who's more chill i want to be able  
to have a conversation i want to be able to hear 
what they're saying not going to clubs where just  
things are just pumping and i can't hear 
anybody and i have to yell out right so  
you know definitely want to be able to 
do that now here's the thing guys though  
i saw a couple of videos where somebody said 
you know the best people you know if you go to  
restaurants to meet women hit on the the servers 
but they have to be super extra nice to you that's  
why they're probably going to deal with you 
a little bit but let them work first you know  
you know don't try to hit on them and put them 
in the spot especially they're serving your meal  
and here's the thing not to say i've 
never done that but why don't you first  
you know have some basic conversation don't 
hit on her and you know what when food is done  
when dinner is done when lunch is done you can 
leave and what you can do is a few minutes later  
or a few seconds later when you walk out 
you walk back in you talk to her and you say  
listen there might not be another chance i might 
not come back here again but since i'm here  
is it okay if i text message you later on do you 
have a viber or an instagram go straight forward  
for that one okay it gives that sense that you 
know what you came back for her it gives that  
extra feel to it okay but don't be like you know 
i'll have the prime rib uh let me get an orange  
juice or let me get a beer and by the way can i 
get your number two don't do that that is so so so  
messed up and then also don't try to look like 
this mr mr suave guy because you're with your  
friends hanging out and having dinner and you're 
trying to ask a girl out now remember filipinos  
are very shy so don't put them in the spot 
okay don't put them in the spot just come  
back leave your friends outside right leave 
your friends outside go back in hey and say  
so leave your friends outside go back in put 
it aside and say hey thank you so much i really  
had a good time you did an amazing job taking 
care of us but i may not come back here again  
i don't want to lose this opportunity so is 
it possible if i can give you a call later on  
text message you do you have instagram 
viber or what's your regular cell number  
just go ahead and ask that plain and simple it's 
gonna work pretty well okay number five are clubs  
a lot of people meet people meet girls in clubs 
here because you know it's night time people are  
going out you know so you definitely want to go to 
a lot of places that are more club-ish if if you  
want to go to a club don't just go to those one 
club areas you know go to a place where there's  
clubs right next to each other a good area 
of that is bgc area in the metro manila area  
there's a lot of clubs a lot of bars right next 
to each other there's rooftop bars as well you  
can definitely have fun there um and there's 
a lot of people dancing but you know if you're  
more of an older type of person you're you know 
you're you may not like the music i mean i'm 42  
and some of the music that they play is just too 
pumping and it's just gives me a headache right um  
and so i like the normal 90s you know 80s hip-hop 
type of stuff or give me a little bit of you know  
soft rock and i'll be a happy man um but some of 
these you know electronic music um emd or what you  
call that stuff that's just too much for me right 
and it's kind of weird if you're gonna be an older  
gentleman dancing in one of these clubs right so 
you definitely don't want to do that plus you know  
i can't dance so it's not like it's going 
to look it's actually going to be a um  
a developmental of a low value if i if somebody 
starts sees me dancing right so you know clubs  
are not places for me but if it's for you hey go 
ahead and go in there and do it right now um we  
talked about restos and we talk about clubs now 
we're going to talk about just bars right just  
straight up bars there's two types of bars here 
in the philippines that you should be aware of and  
one are regular bars you know like wine bars 
some more just chill let's talk martini bars  
there's a cigar bar here that i've been 
to once um and so those are the regular  
bars now there's the second type of bars and 
those are what we call girly bars go-go bars  
you know pretty much the strip clubs of the 
philippines those are where you meet women
to take out as i may say right so there's 
nothing wrong with that to go to those places  
i will i've been to some of those places um at 
the very same time as i don't judge people to  
they frequently go to those places because if 
that's your cup of tea that's your cup of tea  
right that's what they're there for so more 
power to you right i'm sure i'm going to be  
at one of those places again in the future there's 
nothing wrong with that okay but the thing here is  
if you want to meet a filipina for a relationship 
as a girlfriend as a future wife i would stay away  
from the second type of bar the go-go bars to 
girly bars i wouldn't want to meet you wouldn't  
want to go there now some of you guys may judge 
this video of mine and say well no no no michael  
my filipino wife i met at a bar like that and 
we are happily married mazel tov more power to  
you i'm glad that you're one of the one percenters 
that got lucky but the other 99 who's thought that  
they could actually marry and have a relationship 
who or you know with a filipina from a bar  
you know a girl you know um a girly bar well 
they'll tell you their story they've been scammed  
it didn't work out crazy stuff happened okay so 
if you are successful with that i am super super  
super happy for you now i'll tell you guys one 
thing a lot of the girls that are working at these  
clubs they're not there because they're just like 
you know they're in their head they're prostitutes  
in their head that you know they're just you 
know they just enjoy the lifestyle of of getting  
paid uh for flesh right some of them go there 
they know and they do their job because they have  
to take care of their family it's family first 
so i'm not judging everyone that works at a bar  
my thing is you have to do what you have 
to do to survive but a lot of the times is  
the guys that end up dating or marrying some of 
these bar girls they end up dating or marrying  
the bar girls that are very um energetic we'll 
say or very aggressive you know and so that's  
my part of that right so but if meeting girls at 
bars like wine bars or martini bars and those kind  
of things um or even just bars where they have 
live music um i i like that as well like you know  
if you go to the malata area they have this one 
street of like outdoor drinking kind of stuff and  
that's that's fun as well and you're gonna meet a 
lot of people there um and guess what if you're a  
foreigner if you're an expat um you're gonna gain 
attention people are gonna notice you right people  
might even strike a conversation with you and 
at the same time as a lot of people here they  
actually want to have conversations in english 
and so at every opportunity that they can get  
they can practice speaking english they will so 
you know just speaking to some of them they'll  
just start talking back to you because they get 
to practice their english so take advantage of the  
fact that you know you speak english you speak a 
different language that you can converse with them  
so those are type of bars now the last 
one where you can find yourself a filipina  
that um that's looking for foreigners this is 
strictly online dating right majority of you guys  
probably met your filipina significant other 
through online dating because a lot of people  
online date nowadays and they go through what they 
call ldr which is a long distance relationship  
okay and then once you have that relationship then 
you come visit them for the first time here in  
the philippines that's how typically what online 
dating is all about for foreigners and filipinas  
right the thing knows it's finding the right 
um online dating site and um what i'm gonna do  
throughout the videos that we're releasing we're 
gonna release um videos that just shows you guys  
let's say you know okc which is okay and then 
we're going to do some reviews of other online  
dating sites but the typical online dating 
sites where you're going to find yourself um  
a filipina that's more popular nowadays 
is okc which is um okcupid it's a free app  
um but i would always suggest people to go ahead 
and do the paid app uh the paid version because  
what happens is if somebody likes you and they 
swipe right on you and they that means that they  
like you you won't be able to see those the ones 
who are liking you if you're if you don't have a  
paid account um all you can do is send them a 
message and hopefully they send you a message  
but to be honest the trick in okc is to actually 
um send a message you know and you know the woman  
i'm with who i'm very serious with right now i 
met her through okc actually and it was totally by  
accident and the truth is you don't most filipinas 
are not going to be paying for their um for their  
profile or for their subscription they just use 
the free one because you know guys come to her  
luckily enough for her she actually paid she she 
was really serious about finding someone and she  
actually did the paid app as well and i did the 
paid app and i was there for only you know like a  
couple days and she was too and you know we ended 
up talking and you know fast forward to where we  
are now which is an amazing thing um but another 
one that gets used a lot is filipino cupid um  
and another one is christian filipina actually 
uh filipina cupid i took a look at that  
um once and everything and i just i use it maybe 
for like a week or so um i'll actually try to  
make a review in that um would you guys 
as well um filipino cupid uh to be honest  
and i've spoken to a lot of other uh foreigners 
and even locals here they say that there's a lot  
of like a lot of fake profiles a lot 
of guys pretending to be girls there  
a lot of like those nigerian scammers are there as 
well but then vice versa to the women a lot of the  
women are saying that a lot of the guys that are 
in there are a bunch of perverts um that they've  
experienced more perverted guys over there so a 
lot of them are actually you know jumping into  
okc nowadays now what's nice about okc is that 
you can be in the united states for example then  
i can set my location um to be in let's say metro 
manila or quezon city or cebu and you can do that  
and you can see the people there because if if 
you click the part where i choose my location  
you're going to find people within your area 
so you can actually do that would choose a city  
another app that gets used a lot is tinder the 
thing here is you know tinder us and still in  
the philippines as well tinder is a hookup app 
i mean that's the place you go to to hook up  
with people to be honest i'm not joking around 
so it's it's always been branded as a place  
for hooking up and so for you to think that you're 
going to find somebody who's going to become  
serious through tinder is really not the right 
choice especially if it's because it's a hookup  
app now unfortunately there's some women out there 
who don't know that that's what it was really for  
they do go to tinder hopefully hoping to 
meet somebody so but that's far from the norm  
so that's what tinder is another app that's really 
going really popular is badou and another one  
is called bumble right but bumble is more 
of a female-centric app where the female  
has more control of what's going on in that 
particular space um so online dating i have  
all i can say for all in dating you know it's 
worked for me and it's worked for a whole bunch  
of people out there right just think about online 
dating as a club right you go to okc it's a bar  
lots of women in the bar but what you can do 
is you don't have to go approach that group  
approach that group you can just sit down send 
messages see who responds and have a conversation  
so it saves a lot of time but if 
you want to do it like the old ways  
you know hey come down here go to some bars 
go to some clubs go to the coffee shops and  
hopefully that that person you're looking 
for walks in there or is in there okay so  
those are the different places where you can find 
you know a lot of filipinos looking for foreigners  
and that's gonna i hope this video helped you
