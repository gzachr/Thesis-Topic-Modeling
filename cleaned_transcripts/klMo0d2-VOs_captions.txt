We have questions here that I printed earlier
and every questions will either answer both or none and either Mia or John
He got his own rules! Difficult to explain
I need to put the wind muff filter again as its windy

This is very unprofessional video its not organized
Look at him!
the first question is
What are you saying?
so the first question is..
Be honest
Darling I dont fart I break wind
Every time we go somewhere and he will said I break a wind and I was like what!!
John: Darling, You don't have to give the secret
John: Ahh!  it's not John because
"MIA"always reminds John about it....
Mia:so how John can forgot about it
John: Exactly!
Mia: Mostly it's John
John:yeah I'm not good at  remembering stuff like that
Mia: I know the answer to this one!
John: there's no question about it!..
excuse me!!!....2 glasses of wine shes deadly
I'll drop dead if I drink like two glass of wine
I'm
not a drinker John doesn't really get
drunk because it is another
thing is
when I when I am with John I learned the
bad habits to him
his teaching me a bad
habit
I never drunk before
john:I have no reason to keep a secret
so your answer is.... none....
well...
she wouldn't
tell me about a youtube for a long time
so thats the secret
because I feel shy about it yeah
okay its a secret
but it's not a bad secret that should ruin
our relationship
John : oh, it  could..!!
See violence..this is what I have to put up with
I'd certainly don't
don't give me that much I go to bed
Mia: No!John is
just like
Sometimes
John!
You need the raise your thingy
it's John
yeah I always messy
John:Well I can assure you I put my hand on
my heart I could tell you I would never
cheat never happen in my life and I
ain't going to start now because I
wouldn't like it done to myself
so why do others their, thats simple !
The rule is just to
raise this that one or this one
so it's none yes no one
yeah John
I give you that!
its only  because Mia has had her no
personal money but she has now so
now she could buy me lots of presents
so remember
I have no reason to lie
No..you lying sometimes!
No we will skip that question
no there's no lies to
be said I don't like because I don't
need need a reason to lie right okay so
About what?
also John
okay yeah both yeah right
whoa yeah because when his mad when his
when he is mad he won't speak to me and if I am
mad I won't speak to him
I don't speak so I don't say something I'd regret
later - yeah that's right
I think both
Why me?..... you work at home work so both
Yeah I work at home so I do stay home
but I work at home
you run away..you always leaving me
on what?
in general things no matter you
earn profit with that you still spend more
money that's the question is who's more
likely to spend more money
probably  me to be fair
come on this but it's so it's John
I only spend money on returnable money not
disposable money because I don't waste
on disposable money much mainly
returnable money because I'm
business minded
Sit properly like that.
I'm just sliding down because you keep beating me
You notice I been putting the corner the naughty
corner
it's me
cuz I don't give in because I'm tough
because He got an ego that's why he don't say sorry
He got a pride
no principal
no you got a
pride you always think you're always you right but you are wrong sometime
how can I be wrong when I never am
You're such a bad person
You get jealous!
JOHN: I never been jealous in my life
He's not showing it and He's not admitting it
Look at his guilty face
And he like, Why the lights is on!!!!???
Wasting electricity
Why me?
All you have to is read messages on my phone
Its both
You're sweet
Sweet? Yeah but I am not clingy
You're clingy
its only cuz it think your younger
and you came from different country
What do you mean?
cuz your insecurity
what you mean insecutrity?
Everybody has an insecurity specially when they are younger
its quite normal, I used to be like that
What makes you think that i am insecure?
unless you are just clingy because you are jealous person
because John if you look at his feet it so soft and he is very soft person
He's handsome...
and she's the queen of Mindanao
What you mean the queen of Mindanao? I don't know where he got it
We don't really have done that ,aren't we?
Personal
