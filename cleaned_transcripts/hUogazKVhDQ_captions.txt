Hi guys, welcome back to my channel
And if you are new welcome so for today's video
I'm going to call my family and friends using the language that they don't know. So for example, my family is from the Philippines
I'm going to speak Korean to them and if I'm going to call my foreign friends who don't know
Filipino I'm going to speak to them in Filipino, so
The languages that I can speak are the following Wow, so I can actually speak English Filipino
Which is Tagalog and I can also speak Ilocano that I like in my hometown. I can speak a little bit of Korean
I know a little bit of
Spanish and Cantonese, but I don't think I'm going to use those because I'm not fluent in speaking those languages so
Most probably I'm just going to use the three languages that I am fluent of so for now
Let's start. I'm going to call my friend and let's see. So my Korean friends. Oh my goodness. Don't tell me they are all busy
