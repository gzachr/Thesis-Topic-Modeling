Today, we arrived at the Philippines
the Philippines is an archipelagic country, each island of them has different food and different food
and some of them are very famous and attract so many tourists
like this one which is considered as one of the most beautiful around the world
the island of Boracay
this island was totally closed in 2018
due to the excessive number of tourists that came to it
that destroyed its beaches and its marine life, by throwing plastic and garbage into the sea
everyone was shocked by that decision
Hotels and shops were closed
and no tourist was allowed to get in there
but
Filipinos agreed to the decision unanimously
and everyone contributed to clean up its beaches
until its official reopening
there are also some hidden and unknown islands to the tourists
like this untouched islands
which are our new destination
we're starting from this one that gossip says it is haunted
which is Siquijor island
but first, we need to reach Cebu
and then to Siquijor
Guys, we're going to Siquijor island
it's not very touristy, that even Filipinos do not visit it often, because they're afraid of it
coughing before the pandemic was totally fine  😅
Siquijor
look at this
from mother nature
I have no idea what is going to happen to us
this island is too small
you gotta leave the whole world behind and come here
it's almost empty of tourists
because of the rumors about it
but we save it
keep evil away from us
Guys, this is our second day in Siquijor island
the mysterious island
we're heading to a cave in the middle of it
despite its coasts and beaches
From here, it looks like a Canadian glacier ice cave
so obviously, we're going to discover it right now
of course, you can rent all the accurate equipment and gear from here
she has 58 years old
and you can see how much energy and excitement she has to do it
how much she's strong
but we're going deeper into this cave
we're now in the middle of the island
One of the most deadly incidents in Southeast Asian countries
is falling from a scooter bike
and that's what happened to our friend
😔
things were Okay at first but ...
a half an hour later
Guys, this waterfall is our final destination
that we're going to see it very quickly before leaving this island
which is absolutely breathtaking. You can stay in it for a week or for a whole month
you can isolate yourself in it
and people here are absolutely amazing
this is where I discovered that Filipinos are the nicest in the whole world
I started my adventure The Philippines herein
and here I'm back after visiting so many countries
I discovered that The Philipinnes is the world's
Friendliest country
You can find so many countries
that hold in high regard and respect to foreigners
but in The Philipinnes it's special
it's really special
Here, we are in this river
people are jumping from so many cliffs
and I'm trying to get some beautiful footage for you guys
entrance here is almost free, you don't need so much money
and you can stay for the whole day
this island is absolutely fantastic
but we need to leave as soon as possible
because we have a new trip to Cebu
we're heading directly to Cebu from here
because there's an important thing to show you up, guys
Let's Go
the second island was in Cebu too
where it's known by swimming with sharks
which are not harmful because they're trained
people are afraid of it because they think it has ...
Magic ... and it has ...
Devil 😈 and evil 👿 eye
forget about all of that
we come here to defy that but we found nothing
our situation was so normal
and there's nothing related to these widely-known Superstitions
before keep going guys

they are so huge
but it's known to not attack
humans ... they feed them in advance
besides, they're peaceful
but ...
no
it looks like a hippo 🦛
now, we're going to swim with it
it is so huge
it's almost 20 people combined
Let's Go
in the name of Allah
