a photo right right there it's
crazy like can you can you picture yourself 
in this situation like you just sing your  
heart out and as I said he he was trying to 
get I kind of I'm not even like cuz clearly  
I'm a little bit emotional not trying to go 
I'm trying to hold back as much as I can but  
it's like this moment right there uh it's 
heartbreaking and it's beautiful in a way  
um but damn like I said he was just trying 
to get as close as he can he was singing  
his heart out and then he he's just trying to 
get as close as possible and that's F even if  
you haven't been through obviously like I'm 
I don't think I'm old as this man not yet  
anyway um definitely have not been in the same 
situation like this specifically but yeah it's
like it's yeah it's tough I can't I can't imagine 
I feeling this way it's not something I would look  
forward to but yeah um you can feel the pain 
when you definitely it makes you think like  
someone you've lost with I think as you get 
older we're definitely all be into funerals  
but so you know this man where his emotions 
are coming from and yeah you can you can see  
he's laying it all there and and like I said at 
the start of the video I felt like I want to do  
a reaction to this um just yeah show show a bit 
of love show a bit of love to this man cuz I know  
he's going through the pain you're going to see 
people like me and I don't know if I think I saw  
someone else react to it like popped up but like 
yeah we're like feeling his pain but not really  
not really cuz we're not feeling how he's feeling 
we're feeling his emotion but not what he's going
to not what that he's going to go through 
every single day that's that's real so I'm  
going leave it there as I said I don't 
want to get too deep and too yeah too  
emotional but yeah uh just putting some 
attention On this man's the love he
had has he always you can tell he will always 
have that love for this woman you can see that  
his body language everything I touched on I'll 
leave it there if you have any more emotional  
ones like this and you like seeing me get sad let 
me know uh cuz yeah these ones definitely touch  
me even not being in the same situation but you 
can yeah you can imagine if it was you that's for  
sure I'm going to leave it there I'll see you 
in the next one that was tough that was tough
