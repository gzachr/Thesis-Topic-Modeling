- What?!
- Yes!
- Dude, you know
these Filipino streets
be smelling crazy!
- Uuumami, this is good.
- (PvF) We've got a selection
of Filipino street foods
for you to try today!
- Oh my god. Yes!
- Oh my gosh, we get to eat it all!
- (both) Yes!
- Try Filipino street food?
(gasps) Yes!
- Try-- yessss!
- We want to try it.
- Have you ever had
Filipino street food?
- No!
- Oh my god. Never.
- I've never even had Jollibee's.
- Yo! This is--
- My palette is about to...
- (PvF) Also, this is our
second episode doing
Filipino street food,
so if you don't see some
of your favorites,
like turon or balut,
be sure to check out
that video and then come back here
and watch this one.
- And let her know
in the comments
if we missed any.
We can have a third one!
- Yes!
- Also, I am going to try
my best with these pronunciations.
I apologize in advance.
- You're gonna do better than me.
I know that much.
- She's trying her best.
I can't pronounce my name.
- (laughs) "I can't pronounce
my name."
- (man) First of all,
pork blood.
- Pork blood?
- Ohhh. It's very cubey.
- Pork blood skewers?
- Pork what?
- Pork blood.
- Pork blood?
- (man) Chicken feet.
- Ooh.
- Oh yeah, I love chicken feet.
- (man) Pork ears.
- Pork ears? Okay.
- Ears!
- Cool.
- Ears?!
- Ohh, ears?
- Oh, they're all skewers.
- Oh, just a whole skewer.
- Wow!
- Ohhh.
- Yo, get-- what?! Yes!
- Oh, that's blood.
That's definitely pork blood.
- (gasps)
- (PvF) For our first round,
we've got a platter of inahaw,
or Filipino-style
barbecued skewers.
- Wow.
- (PvF) And a variety of sauces
to go with it.
- I personally haven't tried
any of these.
- (PvF) Up first,
Betamax, which are grilled
blood cubes cut into rectangles,
representing the shape
of Betamax tapes.
- I was just gonna say,
is that what that comes from?
- (React) Yeah.
- Really!
- Betamax?
- This looks like chocolate.
I don't think it's chocolate.
- What?
- It's pork blood.
It's pork. This is pork blood.
- This is a little rough for me.
- This is...so interesting!
- Smells like-- it smells like pork.
- Kind of like pâté or livery kind of.
- It tastes earthy.
It tastes like dirt.
- Yeah. You can taste
the pork blood for sure.
- Yeah.
- Oh, and you can kind of
taste the iron.
- Texture's like of a--
I don't know, chalky chocolate cake?
But then the taste is NOT that!
- It's not a consistency
I'm really used to.
- Yeah, I don't really
like the consistency.
- But I can get there. It's not bad.
- (React) Next up,
we're gonna try inahaw fish balls
that go great with the spicy
vinegar dipping sauce.
- The ball nature of it
does not throw me off at all.
- Mm-mm.
- Great taste.
- Mmm! I like these.
- Yeah, fish balls? Come on. Say less!
- I'm going one for the vinegar
and then one for the barbecue.
- Oh, that's not bad.
- That's great.
- This is good.
- Oh yeah, it's good.
- This is good.
- Oh yah.
- You maybe have finally fed me
enough fish. (laughs)
- (laughs) Are you not a fish person?
- No.
- Oh!
- No, no. It's there. It's there.
- Oh, the vision!
- (Benison) Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.
- (PvF) Before you dig in,
I wanna tell you guys
a little bit about Cook Unity.
Ludo Lefebvre?
Fabio Viviani?
Esther Choi?!
There are meal services,
and then there is Cook Unity!
Where else are you gonna
get to eat some meals
from some of the best chefs
in the world every single week?
I honestly think that the only thing
wrong with them
is that there are too many choices.
Seriously, looking at all
the different and, more importantly,
diverse offerings,
makes me so excited
about what I'm eating this week,
what I'm looking forward
to eating next week.
And honestly,
that What's New section
is the first thing
I check out every time I log on.
And I love knowing
that they make these meals
fresh in regional micro kitchens,
packaged in compostable, recyclable,
or reusable packaging,
and they're delivered
fully cooked,
so all you have to do
is heat it up and enjoy.
This week, I got some Japanese
beef curry from one
of my favorite chefs in LA,
Brandon Kita.
Some panang, some dan dan noodles
from Mokbar by Esther Choi
that I have ALWAYS wanted to try!
Oh! And some street-style Cuban pork
with garlicky mojo?
If you've ever watched
this show and wanted to travel
the world with us
in our street food episodes,
then frankly, Cook Unity
is your ticket.
And the best part
is that their weekly
subscription services
offer over seven different
dietary options,
including vegan, paleo,
and gluten free.
Plus, they're super flexible.
You can pause, skip weeks,
or cancel at any time.
So, go to cookunity.com/pvf,

Seriously, you won't regret it.
- Oh, cheers.
- Cheers. A little drippy cheers.
- All right, wow!
You ate two balls.
- I mean! How about tha--
- Jaime's two balls deep.
- (laughs) My god!
- It's like sweet, like bouncy
and spongey at the same time
and delicious.
- (PvF) All right.
Up next, we have Adidas.
- Oooh. All right, the chicken feet.
- That's gonna be the feet!
- (PvF) Adidas,
named for the popular sports brand
because of the foot's resemblance
to the three stripes
of the Adidas logo.
- (chuckles) Okay.
- Ohhh, I see!
- All right, bro.
- Damn! These chickens
be walking like this, dude?
- Oops, I took the whole nail.
- See, that's what frightens me.
- It's quite tough.
- Damn, dude.
I have no idea what to expect here.
- Here we go.
Three, two, one.
- Here we go.
Oh, sh--
- There must be a lot
of collagen in this?
- Definitely.
- What the crap?
- What is going on?
It feels amphibious.
- Yeah!
- (Chris laughs)
- Yay!
- A lot of cartilage.
- Mm-hmm. Mm.
- Very chewy.
- (PvF) Okay, up next,
we have isaw, or pig intestines.
- (squeaks)
- It's gotta be this.
- Isaw will either be pig
or chicken intestines.
- What are these?
- Intestines.
- These are like little lollipops.
- I don't know.
You know how I feel about guts.
- No guts, no glory.
- Yeah, well, I have my own guts.
I don't need to borrow some.
- (both laugh)
- Mmm, interesting texture.
- Hmm.
- Smell it, bro.
The smell is a little turning off.
- Hard for me to eat organs
because this is what is cleaning
your whole system.
And so, I feel like
we shouldn't be eating
the pool filter.
- Smell a little funky!
- A little dirty.
- And these are your intestines.
This is what the poop goes through.
- Inner parts of the intestine
are a little more soft.
- Not what I expected.
- Hmm.
- It's kind of crunchy on the outside.
- I kind of like the the color
that goes on, though.
The red, the orange, the yellow.
- (Jair) I'm just a little nervous.
- It tastes very cleanser-ish,
you know what I mean?
- Oh yeah. I tot--
- Right?
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
- Uh-uh. I didn't like that.
- Why?!
- It's sphincter, essentially,
is what we're eating.
- (coughs) I did not care
for that one.
- (PvF) All right,
we've got one more.
Grilled pig's ears,
or Walkman.
- Because you listen to Walkman?
- Oh, wow. That was clever.
- Hel-- oh no, wait. They're ears.
- Look at how soft they are.
- Sauce.
Now, that's got some chew.
- A little cheersy. Cheers.
- Wow, this is a thick ear.
This pig had really good hearing.
- Now, all this is like...
- Very chewy.
- ...texturally so different.
- Mm-hmm.
- The flavor's really good.
There's a little meat on there.
- It's all very soft,
bouncy meats.
- Mm-hmm.
- Chewy bacon.
- Yeah.
- Right?
- (PvF) Well, these were all
from Dollar Hits here in Los Angeles,
a very popular
Filipino street food restaurant.
Would you go there?
- Yeah.
- I would, yeah.
I'd go back for these fish balls.
- Me too. And this pig ear.
- Yeah.
- Go off.
- Dude, go off, Dollar Hits!
- Wow.
- This be hittin'.
- What is this?
- Oh, some type of braised meat.
- Ooh, it's a soup?
- Wow.
That looks good!
- That looks yummy.
- Oh, some kind of soup?
- Ohhh!
- Ohhh, I'm about to eat
all of this.
- Yeah, that's going down.
- (PvF) Beef pares
is a Filipino beef stew
that's a popular comfort food
and often served
in small restaurants or food stalls.
It's typically served
with garlic fried rice
and a clear soup.
The word pares means to pair,
and it's said this dish got its name
because it's usually paired with rice.
- Ohhhh.
- That smells sweet.
- Oooh, lord!
- Everything's going down, bro.
- Oh my god. That's really good.
- It's a little sweet.
It's tangy.
- Now, see, I would just
pour this all in here.
- (PvF) Go for it.
- (Chris) Yeah.
- Ohhhh.
- (PvF) This dish is believed
to have originated
in the Chinatown district
of Manila, where it was
developed by Chinese immigrants
who adapted their traditional
beef noodle soup recipe
to suit local tastes.
- That is really good.
- Mm-hmm.
- Ohhhh, that makes sense.
The beef parts taste pretty similar.
- I would eat this every night.
- Mmmmm!
- Savory, I guess, umami flavor,
where you're just like, "Mmm,
I want another bite."
- Mm-hmm.
Uuumami, this is good.
- (laughs)
- This juice. So light.
- Mmm!
- Sweet-ish, but salty.
- It tastes like a comfort food.
- The star anise is
definitely coming through.
You get some of that warming.
But with the sweetness
of the brown sugar and everything,
I don't know,
it's just really balanced.
- I want this one to never end.
- There's no punishment?
Just be clear. Okay.
- (muffled) Quick, she's coming.
Go away!
- Oooh!
- Oh, well.
- Ohhh, noodles.
- Yes!
- Dude, look at that flame, bro,
that wok style right there.
- Ooh!
- I love the noodles.
- Wow.
- Ooh!
- Oooh! That's like chili noodles.
- Oh my god. I want that.
- Ooooooooooh!
- Oh yeah.
- (PvF) Pancit lomi
is a popular noodle dish
with thick, egg-based noodles,
meat, vegetables, and a savory broth.
It's very popular on cold
and rainy days and served
at many street food stalls.
- See, I love noodles.
I could eat that
on a cold day,
in a hot day, in a rainy day.
- (softly) This is good.
- Yeah? (laughs)
- This is-- I like.
- The noodles are so soft.
- Just break down so easily.
- Mm.
- These are good.
These are really good noodles.
- Very gelatinous.
It's like super--
- Yeah!
- Really thick broth.
- It's a really thick soup.
- Oh yeah, what are they--
are these scallops?
- I would eat this.
- Yeah, I would eat this.
- Pancit lomi?
- Pancit lomi.
- Pancit lomi.
- I mean, I could be
just butchering it, but...
- Right, right, right, right.
- ...that's how I would say it.
Sorry.
- This is giving me life.
- Well-flavored.
All of these dishes so far,
they got good flavor.
- Very flavored.
- Pancit lomi?
- (PvF) Yeah.
- This noodle soup dish.
- (PvF) Mm-hmm.
- Dude, you know these
Filipino streets be smelling crazy!
All the garlic, they'd be--
oh my goodness.
- Ooh.
- I think it's gonna be
something sweet.
- Ooh.
- Oh, a drink?
- Ooh. What is this?
- That one looks like fruits maybe?
- Oh, shaved ice?
- Can't ever go wrong
with shaved ice!
- That looks so good!
- Ooh, it's like a snow cone?
- Whoa. Yeah, I don't even--
I'm gonna stop while I'm ahead.
- It's a snow cone, treat?
- It's a snow cone like boba.
- It's like shaved ice
meets a Slurpee.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Oooh!
- What the what?!
- (PvF) Hold it up. Sit up straight.
Jaime!
- I'm sorry.
- Jaime!
- Oh! That's so good.
- (PvF) Sago at gulaman
is a refreshing Filipino drink
made with sago,
or tapioca pearls,
and gulaman, or gelatin cubes,
mixed with a sweet
and fragrant syrup
made from brown sugar
and pandan leaves.
- (both) Pandan.
- That's what I was tasting!
I mean, it looks like it.
- Mmm.
- Hold up. That sound a little sweet.
- Oh yeah, you don't like sweet stuff.
This is definitely sweeter.
- I got the little gelatin in there.
- Just gulp it, bro.
- Cheers, bruh. Oh my, my.
- Fire.
- Oh my gosh.
- Oh yeah.
- It's so good!
It's got like the flowery taste.
- Oh my god.
I got a ball in my throat.
- Wow, that's really nice!
- Mmm!
- Oh, it's like a--
those are boba?
- (both laugh)
- Sugar's just gonna be
racing through my blood
after this, isn't it?
- This is so good.
- Mm-hmm.
- Dude, this looks cool too.
It looks like a--
I'm sipping a lava lamp.
- Bro.
- (PvF) Given that neither of you
have anything left...
- Yup.
- (PvF) ...ready for the next one?
- Mm-hmm.
- Ube?
- (gasps) Ube!
- Oooh.
- Oh, it's ube, yo!
Ah, come on!
- I've never had ube.
- Ooh.
- Oh! What's that?
- It's like
purple sweet potato, right?
- How is purple a color?
I mean, I understand
it's red and blue.
- Ohhh, that corn syrup
is what's thickening it up.
- Is it like a pudding?
- Fascinating color. Look at that.
- That's looking thick!
You see that bounce on it?
- Oooh.
- Are those nuts?
I will always love nuts, bro!
- Whoa.
- Yeah, it's like a combination
of pudding and jello.
- Oh, cute.
Is that coconut?
- (PvF) Ube maja blanca
is a dessert made with coconut milk,
cornstarch, sugar, and ube,
and has a gelatin-like
pudding texture.
- Mmm!
- Hmm. Oh. Okay.
- I thought we were gonna
fist bu-- (laughs)
You're good, bro.
- No, we're good.
- This looks so cool!
- First of all, it's beautiful.
- (Chris) Yes!
- That is not what I expected.
- New one.
- Boop.
- What's this consistency?
- Yeah, it's kind of got
a flan kind of consistency
to it on the bottom.
The white part
is like the flan, right?
- So, how much of this
do you have back there? (laughs)
- Mm, this is good!
- Slap it on your tongue like...
- That's bomb.
- Yeah.
- It's almost like not cheesecake.
- The consistency is
what's throwing me.
- (PvF) This dish is often served
at special occasions,
like fiestas or holidays.
- If I were at a birthday party
and they're like, "We've got
ube maja blanca," I'd be like...
- Oh, I'd be like,
"Where is this at?"
- "Give me some!"
- Yeah. Bring that on out.
- Like, oh baby!
- It's so...
- (both) Firm.
- Yeah! Like a firm...
- But squishy. I don't know.
- Yeah. How do they do that?!
- That is fantastic. Holy cannoli.
- That's really good.
- (PvF) That is what an ube looks like.
- Hmm. Ohhhh!
- Okay, yeah.
- Wow, this is not food coloring.
It's just really bright purple.
- Ube, ube, shube.
That's Pig Latin
for "I love you, Nicole."
- Wait, what?
- I don't think that's what it was.
- Don't check it. Don't check it.
- Well, guess what?
We've got one more.
- There is a punishment!
- More?!
- No? We just get to try more food?
I still don't believe.
- Oh, it's like all different colors.
- Oooh.
- What is that?
Is that like a blue green?
- Oh?
- That looks like jello.
- Oh, is this halo-halo?
- That doesn't look like anything
I can identify.
- What is that?
- I've never tried actual halo-halo.
I've always wanted to.
- We got all colors right now.
- Is it fruit?
- It's called halo-halo?
- Halo-halo.
- Oh my god, look at
the deep purple again!
- Oh my gosh, I'm so excited for this.
I've always wanted to try it.
- Ohhh, and condensed milk over there?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.
- Okay, that's like a dessert.
- Halo-halo means, like,
mix it, mix it or something?
I don't remember.
- (Jayse) Okay.
- (both) Ohhhh.
- Oh!
- Ohhhh!
- Oh my!
- Ahhh!
- What?!
- Yes!
- (PvF) Halo-halo means mix, mix.
And you should absolutely do that
before trying this sweet
and cold dessert
made with layers of shaved ice,
evaporated milk, sweet beans,
fruits, jellies, and ice cream.
- Oh, you're really just...
- I'm pounding it, bro.
- Mix, mix, mix.
- Mmmm!
- Wow, it's becoming
such a deep purple!
(whispers) I love purple.
- It's the color
you can't believe exists.
- I don't see it.
It's so unbelievable.
- (snickers)
- Mmm!
- Mm.
- Yeah? Oh?
She's going through
a journey right here!
- I'm beating eggs over here.
- Gotta get a little bit of everything.
- What the [censored] was that?
- Oh my god.
- My mind is blown.
- It's all fruits. You're good.
Ew, ew, ew, ew. Ew!
What was that?!
Don't ever do that again, Jair!
- Do you know what it was?
- I think it's fruit.
- (both laugh)
- Thicker than other parts.
- What is this?!
That's what I'm talking about.
- Wow. That is gooey!
- I thought it was hair.
- Each bite tastes different.
- So different. The texture
of each jelly thing
is completely different.
- Dude, this is delicious.
Mmmm.
- What is on my fork?!
- (PvF) That's a spoon.
- Oh.
- One kind of tastes like jello.
And that one was almost like
a Sour Patch Kid kind of.
- It's gonna taste good.
It's fire.
- (gags)
- It's a party in here.
That's for sure.
- Yeah, very good way to describe it.
- It's just like a candy milkshake.
- You gotta bite it. Bite it.
Mmm, yum, yum, yum, yum.
- My eyes are burning.
- (laughs)
- Yum, yum, yum.
Think yummy, yummy.
- Yum, yum, yummy.
- (laughs)
- There's beans in here too,
which actually tastes really good.
- Oh. That's what--
okay, so that's what it was.
That was a bean
that I was tasting?
I was like, "That did not
taste like a gummy."
- (PvF) Some people believe
that all the colorful layers
in halo-halo represent
the diversity of the Philippines.
- Mm.
- Mmmm!
- I'm so happy right now.
- Oh, the jelly cubes.
Those are different too.
- (PvF) Well, that does it for today.
- Mm-hmm.
- (PvF) Any final thoughts?
- This is great.
- (laughs)
- I feel like that's
like a halo-halo.
- Halo-halo.
- Goodbye, goodbye.
- (laughs) Just looks like
she's in trouble.
Like she's busted
by the principal or something.
- I completely forgot
we were filming. I was just so...
- She was like, "You wanna do outro?"
She's like, "No, I'm good."

what I've been missing out on!
