No introduction needed here! Today, we're going to show you how we make lumpia.
First throw in two chopped onions into a food processor.
Followed by half a bunch of green onions, and
one chopped medium carrot.
Typically people chop everything by hand, but we like to use a food processor to chop it up just a little more finely.
Then add the vegetables to two pounds of ground pork. And add four teaspoons of garlic powder,
half a teaspoon of black pepper, and two teaspoons of salt. And mix all the ingredients together.
Next we're going to roll the lumpia. Make sure to prepare one scrambled egg to use as your paste.
Just our personal preference, we recommend using these lumpia wrappers.
First take out a couple wrappers and cut them diagonally, and lay them out like so. Then using a piping bag
squeeze out horizontal strips of meat at the bottom edge of each wrapper. This technique not only helps you make lumpia  quicker,
but also helps you wrap lumpia rolls that are about the same size.
So now just roll up your lumpia. And seal the end corner with your scrambled egg paste. And repeat!
Once you're done, rolling pour in some canola oil into a pan and heat up your oil on high heat.
These lumpia took us around four minutes to cook, but your times may vary.
A good indicator for when they're done is that they'll be a nice golden-brown color.
When your lumpia are done, transfer them to a bowl with a strainer to allow the excess oil to drain.
Then all you got to do is drizzle your lumpia in some sweet chili sauce and let's eat. If this ain't elegant tasty,
I don't know what is!
