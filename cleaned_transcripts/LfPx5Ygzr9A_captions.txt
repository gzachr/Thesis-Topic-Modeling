judging by the background that we have here
we are at the Magellan's Cross because here
the famous Portuguese explorer Magellan came
and put on a cross for the people to see and
to get here we took kind of a jeepney bus
foreign
what is your impression of this thing Gigi
yeah people are super nice because I'm pretty
sure as soon as I know where I want to get
down they will help me like even though I
don't have the map oh my phone they were healthy
like you have to go down here but is it the
Jeep need or is it the boss well this is GG
this is confusing for me gonna see this one
is more like a jeepney but not really I don't
know it's kind of like a minivan crossed with
a jeepney cross with a bus crossed with a
Russian Maxi taxi everything okay interesting
transformation method so picture this guys
you are in 1521 your Spanish explorer actually
a Portuguese explorer and you're going by
ship and you're exploring the new world and
then all of a sudden you stumble upon some
islands and what is your first thing to do
you set foot on the island and you put the
massive cross in the sand and then hundreds
and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and
hundreds of years later the people of the
area they built kind of a gazebo kind of a
kiosk thing around your cross and then they
make another cross out of wood and in case
the old cross so that the core is preserved
and then hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds of years two crazy Romanian explorers
are coming trying to discover where the famous
explorer Magellan one twin and they stumble
upon your cross and they say huh interesting
this is a interesting hobby that this guy
had okay putting crosses in random places
but Jokes Aside this is basically the birthplace
of Christianity in Manila and what the perfect
way to start the video then with where Magellan
first stumbled upon Philippines cool right
and now right behind behind for um Magellan's
Cross we have the entrance to one of the most
important historical places and religious
places here in the Philippines actually the
place where religion came to be Christianity
came to be in the Philippines and that's actually
here inside this place and you see a lot of
people going in and out I think it's a even
more popular um religious pilgrimage spot
than Magellan's Cross and this is Basilica
Del Santo Nino this church is a little bit
special because this is a church of San mimo
which is a funny story how this became called
like that 44 years after Magellan came here
and brought the cross with him and christianized
the area and the natives he also brought like
a small Idol shaped like a baby Jesus and
if you left it here in the end there was a
skirmish and he left he died long story short
the idol got lost and 44 years later in 1565
Miguel Lopez he came here to see how Philippines
is doing and accidentally they found inside
of a house the statue and after that immediately
they decided okay this is the image of Jesus
this is very holy this is very something special
so they decided to build a church around the
area and this is how this area started taking
shape and there are lots of Legends revolving
around the small child that they found they
say that sometimes the child somehow gets
transformed into a real child who does all
sorts of interesting and kind of pranks on
people sometimes buying fish from locals sometimes
helping other people go by boats to their
ship and all sorts of interesting apparitions
of the small kid and Pope John Paul II when
he came here also he was fascinated by the
story and he started praying immediately at
his Shrine inside the church that's so cool
so basically this small statue is here since
1521 so technically since 500 years ago and
just like that we exited the church and we
are now inside this Courtyard but it's huge
and massive open area praying place and with
Gigi constantly reading and learning new things
about the Basilica that's very fascinating
interesting how Christianity started from
a small little thing
grew and grew and grew and now everybody everywhere
on the planet more or less
okay let's go around and explore a little
bit more because I kind of like the game so
what do you think about Cebu at the moment
like raw offers involutions is it similar
to Manila or not really it's like the way
from pasai to libertad in Manila this one
okay
if we leave the bazaar area
[Music]
shout out to the guard they're the security
yes she was sitting literally like the love
for sure Royal Guard not being bothered by
the fact that the music behind this is like
what
okay
I think it's the largest university here in
the visayas right okay because that's the
name and it was the point where we got down
from the bus okay interesting it's way more
peaceful and way more relaxed than vanilla
yeah yeah that's why I'm a little bit conflicted
I don't know if I like it that much because
the thing that I like most about Manila was
it's chaos and it's I love that I know this
kind of thing but I like it here also I don't
know here you have time to think about the
stuff you're doing and uh and you can feel
the breeze of the sea flowing through your
cap okay interesting hello These Are karaoke
machines right These Are karaoke machines
yes yes All karaoke machines okay interesting
and you would put the coin inside and choose
your song and sing together with your friends
yes
videoke yeah videoke can you choose your phone
please stop and you can sing here Thomas
[Music] all around the world and you can speed
it up okay oh nice interesting I haven't seen
something like this since the 90s in my country
we used to have something similar but karaoke
was never that popular I've never seen something
like this I'm the first time in my life okay
Romania yeah oh see Michael I'm matching with
the karaoke machine I think that's a that's
a sign I'm matching with the videoke machine
I think that's awesome for me to get it huge

34 500.
34 500.

I saw those buttons but oh well that's a different
story for a different time [Music]
foreign
[Music] [Applause] [Music]
thank you [Music]
[Applause] [Music] this guide has been the
Civil Metropolitan Cathedral it is a very
imposing building with massive pillars and
very finely intricate detailed artwork representing
phoenixes representing flowers archangels
and it's quite modest which I like it it's
not very very ornate because it's it's pretty
massive already as it is like it's very Grand
and it's I think fit for a city like Cebu
where the whole Christianity started from
your puppy
very nice
[Music]
remove it
thank you thank you Mom
okay thank you I'll be there
oh thank you puppy it's the statue of humabon
he was the Raja back then when Magellan came
to visit here the first time so he has a statue
over there let's go
three pieces for cream Okay so and this is
seaweed yes okay with seaweed and with cucumbers
I think thank you okay let's see of course
good thank you very good this is a perfect
snack to enjoy while you're exploring Cebu
hmm food want something to do I'm okay thank
you why do I have the feeling that you only
let me try the weird food yes please so that
you don't have to do it come on but the seaweed
is the best literally um it's nice and crunchy
and crispy and um not spicy because I put
spicy stuff yummy yummy yummy what a big snack
imagine Gigi [Music]
would have been different and deciding I shall
build up fourth elsewhere would this be a
good place to build your 4G I mean it kind
of overlooks the sea a bit of course I think
they decided what was best for them back in
the day yeah I mean Miguel Lopez is
he decided to build himself a fort here and
they also built him a obelisk behind there
and nowadays is being used more or less by
the kids as a tick tock hangout Place back
in the day it was different oh we're at Sports
San Pedro yes [Music]
the Port of San Pedro describing an official
report 1739 it's a triangular in shape and
made of stone and mortar hello [Music]
[Music] in the past basically according to
that face it was made out of wood okay hello
I think we have to give to get the sentence
Romania hi where are you from Romania Romania
Romania yes welcome to my blog thank you okay
that's so good welcome to his Vlog we are
Romanian and we are welcoming into this Vlog
oh that was so sweet the same thing that happened
to us like back in the day in Manila where
are the guys yesterday they were like hi hello
Vlog welcome to my everyone yes okay so now
we're inside this fort and it looks more or
less like a fort I mean it has whoa strong
cold three of them four on two and three and
it has an entrance and it has cannon balls
and cannons it has peoples and it has palm
trees and I wonder how the view from up top
is because this should be really interesting
this is the purpose of the fort right yes
Overlook everything around you
we have Corners with grass and nice people
around and cannons and [Music] condoms in
the corner very beautiful fort and this is
basically overlooking the entire Square
and exercises and well it's a different generation
back then during the Conquistador times I
thought they would have thoughts that children
and youngsters in the 21st century would come
here to do Tick Tock and to play and sit around
and do nothing but yeah it's a fun Saturday
afternoon so what can you do then hang around
the fort enjoy the nice weather enjoy the
Sun and stay with your friends and explore
around I was thinking like if Cebu and Manila
both of them have a four they must be similar
in some kind of way right but apparently no
like they're not similar at all this one is
very different than the other one the stones
are made from Coral they're so nice oh okay
yeah it reminds me of of the Ford Portuguese
fort in Hormuz actually in Iran beautiful
place also the stones were made out of coral
anyway I'm diverging so you cannot compare
the two like long story short no no way no
way this has a different shape it's way sunnier
somehow and uh it's less spooky the other
one has a really terrifying story and uh it
made my it gave me goosebumps this one is
like more Sunny even though it has most more
or less like the same kind of history behind
but here yeah like it's super sunny thank
you oh man GG I like this area I like it a
lot this whole park here is amazing everything
is green everything is nice and peaceful and
laid back and people are relaxed they don't
do much it's a Saturday and everybody's bad
just having a good time basically somehow
I don't know why but Cebu gives me like Borneo
Vibes especially the former indigenous people
of Cebu before the colonization from the Spaniards
they are kind of like the even tribes of the
ovorno what do you think oh very nice very
interesting point of view similar style of
wear similar style of tattoos similar style
of I know wanting their freedom and fighting
for colonization interesting very interested
to learn more about this about the culture
the past and the like the before the era kind
of that would be nice that would be very nice
but to the magic of YouTube and editing we're
gonna go now to
happen encountered when he came onto this
island his scribes were saying that he had
to jump into Thai high waters now for me it's
only anchor high and they had to fight with
the opposing forces of laplapu in order for
them to conquer this place for their friend
King on the other side as he was doing it
we can do it as well through this water and
head to our final burning place come on
following Magellan's Journey we reached this
place where basically he came on land and
he got killed by Lapu-Lapu and his men after
trying to circumnavigate the globe he ended
up in the Philippines and he became friends
with humabon the king and the local ruler
of Cebu and he sent Magellan basically on
a quest for him to show his friendship and
kill his arch enemy what do you think about
this Village um it's like a lot of
people of the anti-colonialism and like individuality
and the nation of the Philippine people right
it's also in the same way 
kind of a memorial for Magellan and for the
first circum yeah because he remains were
never found because Lapu-Lapu once killed
him once he killed him he didn't want to give
up the body he kept it as a kind of a trophy
as a war Trophy and therefore nobody knows
where the remains of Magellan were buried
or were scattered around there are a lot of
people here coming and chilling and enjoying
the lovely day it's a very popular touristic
attraction here for everyone a lot of tourists
foreigners also come here to see hula pulapu
was and to learn more about maktan yes and
about the history of Ferdinand Magellan the
crazy Portuguese who sailed around the World
stopping in the Philippines okay and that
being said we are nearing the sunset it's
an amazing place but nevertheless we are hungry
and we have to go get something to eat so
by the medical of teleportation we will go
back again to Cebu [Music]
very good very good very nice place perfect
week thank you for watching guys
