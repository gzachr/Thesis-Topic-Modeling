on this episode of trying something new
we arrive in Oslob and meet the famous
mother Theresa explore the nightlife eat
dinner at 7-eleven swim with the whale
sharks and visit similan island we had
to head to Bohol so we decided Cygnus
shortest route which was a sketchy three
hour boat ride across the ocean
all right we're in the area we're in the
general vicinity but our driver doesn't
know where it is so what kind of asking
people along the way okay perfect while
we were checking in the room Ryder
decided to be sneaky and hopped into the
driver's seat and blasted the sir
okay we just arrived at Mother Teresa's
here I love what do you think Thanks the
turquoise wall thinks it as a hue of the
ocean guess what I'm doing sleeping on
the bench but the best part of being in
Mother Teresa's is a location right
behind me is the whale shark expedition
that leaves it six in the morning so we
have to get up at 5:30 and just walk
next door the first thing we did when we
got there was signed the book for the
tour so medic Theresa can take care of
the tickets so in the morning all we did
was walk out of our room and be one of
the first ones in the book
got off the bus in town
and now we don't know what
seven chicken feed you guys want some
chicken feet
no no why not have you ever tried it you
guys hungry
we also try some sky I think we're gonna
live off of lilies big shop when we told
everybody we were coming to aslan they
said you know what you just go there for
the whale sharks you get in you get out
you're done we have two days here and
there's not even really much restaurant
so the kids just filled up in 7-eleven
and me and Sandy are trying to find a
place to eat
what are you doing next a nice wiener
so we panic and went into 7-eleven I
filled up I'm snicker bars and Sandy
bought 500 pesos where the junk cheap or
muffin
after walking around for a few hours
trying to find something vegetarian tea
we decided 7-eleven was the spot to be a
lamb 7-eleven is the busiest place here
who would have known that 7-eleven would
be killing it in the Philippines
would you have thought 7-eleven would be
like the hotspot it's like Walmart even
the owner of our hotel is in there
having a snack so we've had some girls
at the pool they're in here
I bet the one of those out she's in here
inside outside pack as the Sun set on us
love this little sleepy town woke up the
night market was booming so how much is
it oh I think you said 185 hahaha ok so
it's 25 pesos each
how are ya we're so good huh sweet
mangoes after a long day of exploring it
was time to get a tricycle and head back
to Mother Teresa's for our 5:30 a.m.
wake-up call to swim with the Welsh how
you feeling right now
so we had about a 15-minute ride back to
our hotel in the middle of the night
pitch black this guy think the monsters
gonna get her
so a while back ago we made a video
about whale sharks but we didn't show
you our before and after part two a
journey to awesome I'll say you said
it'll be funny alright so if you've seen
this part no need to comment and tell us
that you've seen this part and now that
you see next time a good job buddy
every five we now return you to regular
programming this is going to be a
shorter version of our whale shark video
here's the thumbnail and there will be a
link at the end of the video if you want
to see something really funny definitely
check out that video haha get nervous
eggs in the morning 6:00 in the morning
no good we just woke up you see all the
boats right there for the whale sharks
look at that sunrise guys whoa beautiful
day
oh my god okay I got really big
butterflies right now right how you
feeling how you feeling
guys it must be right here
when I first jumped in the water I could
not believe my eyes
they were huge so when you first get in
the water it's absolutely pandemonium
everybody's in the water oh my god it
was one of the coolest experiences I've
ever had to see the whale sharks in
person it was really cool I would choose
there too didn't the water that day I
sat in the boat and spotted the whale
shots when I first saw the word shark I
thought it was gonna eat me whole when I
turned around he was right next to me so
I had to swim as fast as I could
I love the will sharks out of our three
months of traveling through Southeast
Asia this moment right now was one of
the highlights
that was such a cool unique whatever
kind experience it's almost like you
don't want to end you just kind of go to
the shore like if you did chance and in
the Philippines
check out the whale shark
so about 30 minutes ago
we were sitting on the beach having
breakfast and we said hey that island
out there looks pretty cool
let's go check that out we asked our
hotel lady mother Teresa can we go to
that Island in 30 minutes later we're
walking down some crazy cool back road
some guy picked us up and you said let's
go to the island so oh where we go I
think it has the water we've been
looking for which is the turquoise
right well the weather is perfect the
Sun came out the clouds are mispelling
feels a little windy doesn't like it
when it's windy neither do i one of the
funniest and most interesting parts of
traveling like this is getting on and
off of these boats knuckle that guy's
old she's a nun does anyone know what he
just said if you do comment down below I
hope it wasn't say anything bad about us
on our face I was gonna beat to get to
the shore you have to walk through
different boats or on skinny planks that
seem to keep getting skinnier would you
walk the plank
Schuyler found a sign that said no drone
flying and she was very upset
when we first got to this island we
thought we'd be able to walk around and
grab some lunch from the hotel but soon
enough we found out it's a private hotel
and all we can do is hang out on the
sandbar so we had to hit the high seas
and search for some grub
so
I don't know about this dismount here
I hope you're ready for another sequence
of us getting on and off a boat but each
one is so different and exciting that we
have to share it with you go nice go
good so just focus good
and just like that we are back on the
shore oh my god where the heck for
Jimmy's clothes I'm wearing my European
swimsuit he need to get a bigger
swimsuit we headed back to her room at
Mother Teresa's where we set our
goodbyes to our new friends and got
ready to embark on our next journey to
behold thank you
how come you're not carrying a bag boy
they got my stuff she's caring and just
like that we're off to the next location
we're headed to the hole was way too
much luggage and not enough time to get
him
but that's how we roll Ryder
Nona watch
and here we go again on the infamous
yellow bus you going to
you landed in a tree all those more than
one
this is where it gets a little tricky we
had to choose between two ways to get to
panglao island the longer Safeway would
have taken about half a day to get there
the shorter way was about a three hour
boat ride
but I read a bunch of reviews and it
sounded kind of sketchy we ended up
choosing the shorter route leave a
comment down below and let us know which
way you would have taken
okay so we're finding out very quickly
you need to talk to the right people to
get you where you wanna go Gina is that
Kristen for us because we were being
opossum
and now we're here we're gonna Bank last
night I was so confused I don't know how
we're gonna get here and I love that it
all worked out and the most interesting
thing is I think are we taking one these
little boats I don't know we got to take
a boat to a boat this is a three-hour
journey for the next set so hopefully
three hours not on one of those in three
hours on a decent book but if it is one
of those is what it is all right time to
pay up
it's what you get on a three-hour
journey show me your new shirt you got
today
kids about to get on a boat okay we come
on we just let it go okay guys walk down
the stairs please
don't fall in the hole guy
all right we thought you were gonna tip
over in 25 feet of water and watch all
of our belongings sink to the bottom of
the ocean we're here guys this this hold
still it's fine
everybody's okay these guys are badass
and know what they're doing so what do
you feel right now
can you help so we made it on the
everybody but we made an iron we're good
it's a smaller boat than I really wanted
but she looks pretty good so Ryder must
have had a few too many red horse last
night and now he's yakking over the side
of the bun
hey hey
I have to say it is absolutely
impressive to watch how these guys get
the luggage on and off the books like
what do you have on you that boat ride
was absolutely treacherous horrible and
a bad experience and I have to say it's
not true because we had a wonderful
experience and we really really really
planned this trip with less luggage
and Ryder will walk so we've got
everybody carrying him everywhere
we met these awesome guys on the boat
coming here - where are we penguin
island they're from Estonia and they
also have a blog and we have to check it
out but yeah they have 3000 gigs of
footage footage all over you can make so
many videos to the house and I'm glad
it's not a tricycle it's this big thing
so it's 200 pesos which is four bucks
one thing that we absolutely love about
this type of travel is all the new
different experiences we get to have as
a family and all of the new amazing
people we get to meet and the ability to
see the world with our kids and expose
them to so many new and exciting
situations it's funny because we say
we're doing this for the kids
but I think me and Jimmy are really the
ones that are getting the most out of
this journey we might be the biggest
kids of all
we are always counting ads and Kathy
bags we have too many bags but not too
many have AC credit
so I definitely think the hospitals are
a cool option but it's just not a good
option when you got three kids I
understand the whole backpacker thing
you're in and out you sleep there but
with kids it's just not for us so we
splurged a little bad we paid $55 a
night for here and I think it's probably
worth roughly all right let's go eat oh
my god Ryder locked us out he could not
not lock doors only what do you love
locked us out of both spots guys let us
in all right new ice cream then I guess
you're not getting ice cream funny guys
