I'm nervous
are your nervous joao?  yes
it's made from rabbit
no it's not
So I'm in Porto right now right I 
have a connecting flight to Lisbon  
and I missed it I feel like I'm the only 
one stressed out but you know when I was  
like coming up to the reception of the gate 
when I told them I missed my flight because  
I was from a connecting flight they were like 
"oh no problem we'll get you on the next one" 
this is the first time I've ever 
been to Lisbon and it's incredible  
Portugal is kind of strange it's very relaxed
and I think that's a good thing right and  
that's like the general attitude if you look 
around – there's no one- no one's in a hurry
foreign
so this is Joao he 's Portuguese 
and he lives in Lisbon 
he's a really good friend of mine and 
I wanted to visit him for this episode
is it normal to grab beer s while you're waiting 
for a train because he just bought it there  
no so you can take them on the train we need to 
drink before the train's here but it's okay to like
it's fine
so Portuguese custard 
custard tart so pastel de nata 
and you know it's just like a really sweet pastry 
is it very popular? It is. the most popular thing   
that and the coffee. This is – what is it called 
pastel de nata – so it's a custard pie, yeah a custard pie 
which tastes like Buko pie - like you could, with 
some training you could eat at one bite one bite
okay let's see if tomorrow at the end of 
the day you can eat that one yes one bite  
man okay a challenge, that's real good – okay perfect
what are we lining up for? Maybe 
the second best, yeah the second best
Pastéis de Nata
all right it's a pretty substantial line right
I don't know if I'm pronouncing it 
correctly but these are Ginjinha shots 
we've had so much of these but they pair
with anything so you can get it at any bar  
or restaurant what are you putting it? some white sugar I love it I love it so  
much you can put some cinnamon in there 
have you had cinnamon lately
Hell yeah
Should I go? I'll do it. Okay, cheers, my friends.
To Portugal – To Lisbon!
Salut amigos!
So this is pate?
yes sardines pate, is this sardines? yes the little fish.
so it's sardine pate, yes - but there's like other types of pate 
yeah, there are other – 
oh, that's so good
so what kind of food are we eating?
basically you know daily Portuguese food, what we eat every day
If you have an hour, you're doing some construction 
work and then you come and just eat this
well maybe not with the starters – but 
then you get it. It's very flavorful it's  
like you know like what you see is what 
you get and it's also not that expensive
I really enjoyed going out at night too people are so passionate people  
are so lively you know they just want to 
have fun and I really enjoyed it 
Joaoee. Yo. Where are we going?
We are going to Palazzo de pena
My goodness– which is just there! it's just there you can see it
how long do you think that walk is? 
well uh maybe five minutes.
It's not so far, is it?
alright
so what time is it now 5 30 
and the last ticket is at six so we  
have 30 minutes to get up there 
you think we'll make it? 
yeah sure, we'll make it
so what happened
ah dude
oh we're still a little bit far 
away um what's the ticket for joao?
For another monument
we almost got it, we almost made it man
yeah, the view's crazy
so we're here
It wasn't the red one
um surprise yeah the other one is just 
actually decent you know it's not that  
good this is this is the real deal 
you know this is the real castle
This is the one you see on Game of Thrones - Exactly
Not red ones, who the fuck goes to red castles? exactly!
where are we trying to go? We're trying to go to 
Central Lisbon and they have the greatest  
Filipinian food in Europe 
Alright so we're 
on our way to inasal at this point but then we get  
there it was closed there there was no one there 
so um we called them and we called them a bunch  
what'd they say?
they say uh that they didn't arrive yet 
that they maybe are arriving at some point soon
Filipinian people
drives me nuts 
so this is what I'm saying 
that it's so relaxed 
what'd they say?
they're so funny
what did they say?
how many are you? 
just two yeah
what that means oh in an half an hour 
okay! can be, we can do it
so they're there already? 
Yeah
alright on our way to inasal
so there's a lot of hills 
in Lisbon apparently yeah  
so this is very normal, what is this – like 100 steps? maybe more 
look how high that is
Jesus Christ
It's this right here!
so when the cruise ships come yeah 
a lot of 
the employees are from the Philippines 
and they all come here to eat
so that's why they are talking about the ship before and tomorrow it's coming
a big ship so it was like tomorrow you'll have a big variety 
so downstairs they have karaoke
The restaurant, and they sell like, oh my god, 
religious stuff
because they are very religious
so this is Inasal Filipinas 
honestly when I first came in here I felt like 
I was transported to the Philippines right away 
There were Mama Mary figures
 There was karaoke
This Chicharon Bulaklak is perfect so when I saw 
that they had it on the menu right  
before we were coming I knew I had to 
get that and that was their specialty too  
what do you think? I think it's like popcorn and fries yeah and chips at the same time right 
so it is like appetizer right it's good the 
food was incredible 
so we got some papaitan
They gave these to us for free
Did you like it Joao?
yes I really like it really tasty 
pretty similar to the flavor profiles of Portuguese food right
yeah I would say so, it's liver isn't it?
What did you think of that one?
the vegetables
I got a piece of garlic
amazing
I'm nervous 
You're nervous?

that's what my parents  
told me – we don't do rabbits it's 
not a it's not a dish we don't have rabbits
it's not too bad
