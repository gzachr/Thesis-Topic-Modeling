because I guess right now like love is not enough 
like what do you call this is David I'm gonna put  
I'm probably gonna put that in the beginning of 
this interview that's funny that's good okay I'm  
listening after five months of partying you're 
done she's ready to get married now so reach  
out to her she's ready here's my name yeah I know 
why should I marry you yeah give a nice gentleman  
send your bank statements yeah Andrew uh what's 
the cover letter your resume and convince her why  
you're the one for her because this is a sweet 
girl she's trying to put on a facade but really  
in the heart she's a true nice country girl and 
it's obvious it's nice it's nice so this is the  
continuation video this is part two from the 
video yesterday we're gonna dive a little bit  
deeper and finish off the conversation with 
Judy so let's get into the video so Judy so  
you're single now you said right yes okay so 
have you ever had a boyfriend before yes I have  
one one when I was 20. okay in your 20s yeah 
so four years ago yeah and that relationship  
is kinda I'm very conservative of the time so 
I used to so you were ready for marriage then
see it's not crazy but yeah I don't know so 
that was your mindset then yeah and then he  
is the only one who heard a speak about it so 
yeah kind of but the things is not um because  
of the pandemic and then things is not work well 
because uh like I feel like we have we are in the  
you know like different stage like like we're 
not oh YouTuber was he 20 also yes that time  
he was 26 right now oh he was 26 yeah and I am 
20 years old wow so was he Filipino or was he
a Filipino have foreigners yes really he was 
living here in Manila yes and he works here  
so was he from another country that he was 
or was he born here were you born here oh  
he's born here oh okay okay how long did that 
last for like here one year so what happened  
uh who broke up with who what who broke 
did you break it up with him or did he yeah
this pandemic so so you guys weren't living 
together no no way oh okay we're kind of  
long distance also like he live in from like two 
hours away oh he lives where was that at Quezon  
City okay okay so so you sent him a text that's 
nice of you from that until now we really even  
crossovers so what did he say did he say what  
is what was his reply did he text 
message you back or call you back
okay what did he text you no I'm sorry it 
didn't like this like yeah yeah that's it  
like everything yeah he didn't even ask why um 
because the time no he didn't did he ask why or  
not no okay yeah see that's how it is because 
my uncle so my uncles have this song well they  
both sing and play the guitar and there's a part 
of the song where he says I didn't even ask why  
when she said she was leaving oh so that guy 
so he didn't even ask why so he already knew  
I already you know like everything is not good 
that time yeah yeah up until this point you  
say you've been very conservative and then she 
said she flipped so she got so she flipped like  
a pancake I was telling her she got buttered up 
and then now the syrups on her but I want to know  
what you mean specifically specifically by that 
what do you mean you flip you think because some  
people are so conservative that when you say you 
flipped yeah it's really just like you're dating  
now you know what I mean or is it like you really 
flipped and you're like going out to the club all  
the time meeting random men is it like that or is 
it more like just talking you know to different  
boys and stuff like that no what I mean is the 
flip is because I used to be that the student  
like you know because I'm not student anymore and 
then I met this this uh this girl so after I met  
them like you're French you got a wild friend you 
said right yeah like here's the thing uh there's  
always one there's always one I know this I know 
that like what is this is this last video like  
is this U.S I don't think so if I'm still in the 
Philippines that kind of feeling really yeah like  
we are always weekdays party girl like weekdays 
weekends right oh it's in the party we don't have  
life it's kind of like that just partying yeah 
just partying child liberated yeah right yeah so  
so then would you say so let's try to sum that 
up a little bit would you say that it's you're  
just partying more or you're dating more or maybe 
combination oh so it's more like party partying  
talking but uh it's not good to talk because they 
are what they call this like empty uh for example  
if the guy yeah invite me to take him here let's 
watch like Netflix Run Okay okay so you don't mean  
like that yeah for example okay okay so she's 
still very good girl is that what you're saying  
I mean for a girl for example one another is a 
guy invite me to swimming like oh no no swimming  
really you're like are you okay so okay so when 
you say you flip then let's get this let's try  
to condense this okay so you said you flipped you 
just mean really you're just partying uh partying  
and uh being a third wheel a third wheel of 
those girls yeah her your wild friends yeah it's  
kinda I of course I saw them like I I know what's 
happening so you mean just because you're around  
it you feel like you're kind of wild okay yeah 
it's kind of so you're still like at heart you're  
still like a sweet country girl right yes but yeah 
but I feel lost like no like so you need a man to  
save you no no no I can find myself like oh yeah 
yeah okay this is not me anymore I have goals in  
life it's kind of like so you mean you got it out 
of your system so like you party and you're done  
with it okay okay actually I'm already tired of it 
like really after how long it's months of partying  
and you're done with it yeah and you know it's 
kind of no no way I don't want to go in I'm tired  
of life I always for example I Look to myself 
like like that's like no this is not you because
come here so what are you so are you saying you 
need to stop that and get married and have kids  
I need to stop focus on myself develop some skills 
maybe uh like YouTube channel like YouTube channel  
guys come on yeah what's the name of that by the 
way Judy Florida yeah all right or like something  
new something that can be like something that can 
makes me happy because yeah cladding drinking is  
good like it makes you happy but when you wake up 
just headache yes regret you spend money yeah yeah  
you didn't waste anything like I know you did that 
for a long time yeah like it I said to myself it's  
been a long time I don't want to do it for a year 
I don't want to be this like a bad habit or thing  
yeah yeah so then your your last boyfriend was 
half Filipino yeah but you were telling me that  
you don't like you prefer foreigners yeah right 
so why is that well first let me try to do this  
so you were telling me earlier that Filipinos you 
said they don't grow up which I find fascinating  
I'm curious about that so just try to tell me 
give me a few examples okay yeah most of them  
not all but most of them they are so immature 
like so hard so hard for them to get mature or  
um also give me give a couple quick examples short 
examples just a couple how to say example like  
like for example they don't have they don't have 
goals like oh okay like for example they choose  
to especially they are very easy to be addicted to 
one thing like for example mobile Legend like that  
oh video games you know like mobile games like 
we don't have they don't think about their future  
even they have kids already so let's less ambition 
yeah and then what's another thing the another  
thing is kind of like they don't care about their 
future kids like that like they're just thinking  
about about prison it's kind of I don't know not 
all but that's the thing so is there anything else  
was it just the immature thing was that what it 
was like very mature and then uh like no ambition  
yeah yeah and then uh I don't like Filipina jeans 
also Filipino jeans yeah you're saying yeah it's  
common here it's common here in the Philippines 
really in Asia they want to have mixed babies  
like white yeah European with with uh mixed with 
Asian yeah future Miss Universe yeah yeah all of  
them right all the Miss universes are half half 
right yeah yeah they're all half a half yeah and  
in the Philippines they love the beauty pageants 
yes it's really loud that's why they want to have  
like mixed babies because you know the best chance 
to win Miss Universe yes and to be a superstar  
yeah yeah so are you so do you interact with a lot 
of foreigners do you date foreigners or not really  
um for no not really I want to focus on myself 
yeah I just I'm I'm waiting for it I'm not I'm  
not looking for it you know yeah you know looking 
forward but they find you though don't they right  
it's kind of hard to hide isn't it yeah yeah so 
do you get approached like let me ask you this  
because you live in Makati right so there's 
a lot of foreigners there not really yeah I  
know so do they hitch do they do they approach 
you on the street do you get approached on the  
street like what happens like do you want to get 
for example like ask your number and also uh last  
night we just eat and at the at that open like 
open food court in Makati yeah and then when I  
look like it hit it like that though wow you gave 
her that you gave her that I hope you're drunk and  
like like I look again and then was like I don't 
think that works in any country I don't think  
that'll work in any country unless you're like 
Thor maybe if you're Thor then that works right
over yeah so then so a lot of guys 
approach you then sometimes sometimes
I don't entertain because you know yeah she's busy 
girl she's focused right you're ready for marriage  
I mean I'm not into the boys who's in the club 
oh yeah you see good music and then party with  
girls like have fun but not to get some okay 
Target like yeah yeah not Club boys no thank you  
you meet her at church you can meet her 
at church your chances are better yes yes
so is there a specific country that you 
like is there specific like do you like  
Germans or do you like Australian guys you 
like Americans is there anything specific  
or not really not really just like that shade 
of white yes just white yeah just white shade  
the white or the better yeah because yeah yeah 
yeah they want that milky yeah the Milky cream
because it's funny because back home it's like 
the opposite right yeah you're really white it's  
like like it'd be like oh like you look sick you 
know I mean like oh you need some sun you know  
but here's the opposite oh I need sunscreen yeah 
it's like yeah you need whitening you need your  
skin whiter that's the beauty standard here for 
sure 100 yeah so if you are white you're perfect  
you're beautiful when you're white but me I love 
my skin you know like yeah you know is this your  
natural skin yeah I mean you're fairly light 
someone say your wife right right yeah yeah but  
you know like I love my skin because it's really 
hard to put gluta or something also because you  
can go outside I'm kind of adventurous ones 
that's the whitening stuff right yeah there's  
a ton of whitening stuff here like the Soaps 
and like shampoos they have injections I that  
was a for I never knew about that until I came to 
Asia actually yeah everything is about whitening  
here in the Philippines yeah there's no tan thing 
yeah no sanding yes see growing up in high school  
girls were very white so they would go to the tan 
salon and they would lay in those machines to get  
darker it's like a complete opposite right yeah 
they'd be like oh my God you're so tan you know  
like so is there so what's what's new what's next 
for you there the modeling stuff oh yeah so so for
