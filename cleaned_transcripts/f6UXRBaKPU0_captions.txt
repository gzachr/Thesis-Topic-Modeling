(Seongbuk-dong)
(The restaurant we visited today)
Hello, this is Hoon from Hoontamin
Hello, this is Che bella, the daily life YouTuber
We're here to have Filipino cuisine today
It's my first time trying Filipino food
I've been to Cebu before
I have tried it there
Let's check the menu first
I'm curious, I've never had the local food
Then what did you have in the Philippines?
Korean instant noodles?
Something like that...
There are various kinds of dishes
I want to try authentic Filipino dishes here
I've never had one in the Philippines either
I finally got to have it in Korea
I heard this 'Pancit Canton' is good
And I want to have meat too
I'm a meat-lover
Do you like meat?
Meat is irresistible
Today, we are going to have
'Pancit Canton' with shrimp
'Sizzling Sisig'
And 'Liempo'
There's Tagalog here too
I heard that English is mostly used in the Philippines
That's right
So some people go to the Philippines to study English
And this restaurant was recommended by the people who studied in the Philippines
I heard it tastes just the same as what we have in the Philippines
They have an open kitchen
The vibe of the lights and ceiling
Above all things, this tree
The interior design is full of wood
So all the dishes we ordered are served
This is one of the most popular stir-fried noodles in the Philippines
which is made with pork, chicken, shrimp, and vegetables
I heard this is a usual dish that local people in Cebu love
You might like it since you've been to Cebu
It's my first time trying this
'Che bella' ordered it with shrimp
This is one of the most famous traditional dishes in the Philippines
It's made of minced pork, chicken, fish
and onions, peppers and garlic are added
and it's served on sizzling hot plate
I heard the one I ordered is made of meat from a pig's head and onions
There's an egg in the middle
It must be delicious
And this is a must-have, I ordered a barbecue dish too
Barbecued thick pork belly with sauce
I wonder how the sauce tastes
Let's dig in
Do you know which is the most delicious food?
The dish that other people ordered
So I'll try this 'Pancit Canton' first
There are noodles below
And big plump shrimp
It smells good
How is it?
It's really good
The taste of big shrimp dominates my mouth
And the smell...
I smell something like a chicory
It smells really good and it's savory
We have spicy dishes in Korea
Something like spicy noodles made with pepper seasoning
Or the noodles with meat broth base
We don't usually have stir-fried noodles in Korea
I love these stir-fried noodles
I think I've seen this vegetable a lot
Is this 'Morning glory'?
Let me try this
It's okay even if it's wrong, our viewers will let us know
I think you were right
Let me try the noodles too
Is it okay?
Is it similar to what you had in the Philippines?
It's different, I've never tasted something like this before
What have you eaten in the Philippines?
I should have eaten something like this...
It's so delicious
There are spices, but I'm not repulsed at all
And now, I'm going to try the 'Sizzling Sisig' I ordered
I think I'd better have this with a spoon
It's been cooked even more on the hot plate
This is perfect
The texture is amazing
It's chewy
And it's naturally sweet because of onions
I'd rather say it's sour
It's salty and sour
But the texture is really chewy
I guess this sour taste
comes from this sauce
That's it
This sauce is sour
It looks similar to the mayonnaise
This is more salty and sour than Korean mayonnaise
I think it's not the regular mayonnaise
Please do let us know the secret of this sauce
The upper part got cold a bit, so I could feel two textures at the same time
It's good
It's not pig's trotter, is it? I think the texture is similar
It's meat from the pig's head
I think this is going to be so good if I have this with rice
I need rice
Finally, it's time for the meat, 'Liempo'
Meat is irresistible
Dip it in the sauce
I need some time alone
I want to have it all on my own
The sauce is amazing too
The meat also has sauce on it
It has the savory taste of pork belly
And it's crispy on the outside
So I could feel the softness and crispiness at the same time
And it's even savorier with the sauce
I already feel the sauce all around my mouth
And the flavor of the meat is mixed...
Try this
I'll try it
I should have ordered it and had it all by myself
It's good, right?
I think this is the best among the dishes
I love meat
It's good that we ordered this
It's a new taste for me
It's really good
This is the reason why I have to live long
I have to try all the delicious dishes all around the world
So that I can realize there are so many joys in the world
And I even ordered 'Garlic Rice'
to enjoy it even more
Let's dig in
I saw a dish called 'Sinigang' while searching for Filipino dishes
I heard that is a soup dish in the Philippines
I'm curious about that
If we order this rice with soup, it's Korean rice soup
That's why I was curious
Even though we ordered other dishes today,
I became curious about other dishes while tasting these
It's always entertaining to eat the egg yolk
from dishes with eggs on top
You can relate, right?
It'd be really good if we cook it this way also in Korea
We usually make boiled pork slices with the pig's head
or put it into soup
Sundaeguk? (Korean blood sausage soup)
We usually put the meat from a pig's head in for something like Sundaeguk
Do you know what's in my head now?
I just had Sisig
And It's time for the rice
So I had the rice
Up next, the meat
So I had the meat
Shall I steal her noodles?
That's all in my head
It's really good to have them alternately
For this 'Sisig', it feels a little bit greasier
the more I eat
Actually, they fried the meat with the oil
and added the sauce something like mayonnaise
It can be greasy even when
they added onions and peperoncino
But it's okay
Maybe you can have this radish when you feel greasy
That's why the radish is served
You should have had it earlier
Let me try the radish with it now
This is it
This is the combination
The perfect harmony
May I have the last piece of meat?
This is really...
I wanted to have it all on my own at first
But the more I ate, I started to wonder
how others will react when they have it
Each of the countries has different recipes for the dishes
And different flavors and spices
But each of them are so delicious
We're still having it, but we finished the meat
Anyway, I think we've got enough footage
So it's almost the time to finish filming
So we had Pancit Canton, Sizzling Sisig and Liempo today
We experienced these three dishes
They were all delicious because each of them are unique
It was better to have them separately than to have them all together
I knew nothing about Filipino dishes
And this was a great experience
since I could find out
the taste, uniqueness and characteristics of them
Next time, I'd like to try different dishes too
I've tried three dishes
The taste can be familiar to Koreans
But I found out something a bit different
The sauce and the recipes are different
I loved the meat the most
And I think Korean people would love the stir-fried noodles too
I always have 'Morning glory' whenever I go to southeast Asia
This is my next favorite since it's served after cooking with them
'Sisig' was quite exotic
But it's worth trying at least for once
So I enjoyed all of them generally
I enjoyed it so much
It was a fun experience
