what job did you apply for when you finally decided you wanted or you needed 
to work so at first you know like maybe the the 
kids are maybe three years old or four years old i'm  
trying you know like in Sam's club or Walmart i'm 
you know i'm not having any luck but um when i was  
in Japan i did work for maybe two to three weeks 
in um what i call the department store of the base
even though my mom and dad was 
there taking care of the kids  
for whatever reason my uh young you know my 
newborn doesn't want to go to bed and then  
they're having a hard time making her you know 
putting her to bed and then when i come home  
she's sleeping he said you know you have to stop 
working you can't work right now with this baby  
it's you know it's hard for me i'm working too 
and then we can't rely all the time to your mom  
and dad they're going to be only here in a 
matter of time they're leaving and it's just  
us so yeah you can't work so that's when really 
i had i'm forced to like yeah i don't work  
so i had to stop and then yeah i think when 
we went back here it took me three maybe three  
more years and then i decided to yeah the kids are 
going back to school now and then you know i found  
uh a job that you know i could work at night so 
that's when um ever since i'm working in swings so  
i was to take care of them daytime and then 
i'm working at night and then go home morning  
so maybe a month maybe six months or maybe 
four months because it's a seasonal job  
yeah did you work for the irs i do yeah are you 
still working there guys yeah so i started at 2009  
and then i worked only seasonal like maybe two 
three months it's not really permanent job so  
which i really like because i could take 
care of the kids you know i i it's like a  
supplemental income and then at the same time i 
could able to i was able to help my parents and  
the money back there both of them are my dad 
stop uh didn't go back to uh saudi arabia  
so no there's no income really there 
you know how the life is yes yes  
you're the eldest in the family correct yes 
i am and you only have two siblings sisters  
yes sister okay i remember correctly what 
i learned from you 17 years ago and on that  
short time that we were together so when you 
come here even though you did not work for  
for five years oh but they were with you for the 
first six months uh that you were in Japan right  
but during that so when they when they get 
back when they went back to the Philippines  
from Japan did you support them financially okay 
i don't really have a job that time so basically  
um you know i had to talk it to my husband um yeah 
troy it's really hard it's you know how it is it's  
really hard to um have you know your spouse case 
because they don't understand even before he  
met me and he we get married um i think he has a 
co-worker before that knows somebody that had a um  
a uh wife too or maybe ex-wife that if you married 
a filipina in you will support the family mm-hmm  
um i prepared for that before you guys got was 
not at first and then of course you know he  
has a big heart so i try to balance it out you 
know we're supporting them here and there and  
still small during that time so we're not 
really it's not a expensive raising kids  
during yes so for five years yes and then even 
when i start working 2009 that's when i really  
had to force myself okay need to learn how 
to drive and then you need to learn how to  
go to work because for your mom and dad at 
the same time you know uh supplemental it's  
and it's not gonna be hard for your husband 
to um send them the money because you're  
contributing or contributing also in the household 
so he he doesn't have he had a say but at the same  
time he can't send say no when you say he has 
to say but at the same time he cannot say no  
was it like uh did it put a strain in 
your relationship like not uh probably  
a little bit but has to understand too that they 
they don't really have an income there so it i i  
really have to support them yeah so when you 
say support is it like a monthly financial  
yeah monthly yeah i i do send them like maybe a 
hundred dollars that that time like 10 years ago  
very you know a lot it goes a long ways fast 
forward now you can't do that yeah so it's  
like for five years it was it was that scenario so 
you your sisters here are both sisters already in  
the us too so it's just the youngest the youngest 
is with with you guys so uh so she's the one now  
attending the house in taitai no no no i mean 
the middle is the one in thai thai okay and uh  
California so i think maybe i'm already maybe 
here two maybe two years or a month maybe  
a year maybe a year i'm already no less than a 
year i'm here my sister came uh came here in the  
us too like did she also marry an American or an 
American too okay they live in California were you  
instrumental in your sisters uh no uh okay oh you 
know how it is before you know like uh um you know  
online chat before it it's in that um early stage 
so that's when i think i guess she got lucky he  
uh you know she met him and he's really a good guy 
and they've been here real married for a long time  
you know how she ever did she ever complained to 
you or so uh or you know ask you for advice like  
i'm having difficulty in this challenges like 
did she face the same challenge like yours like  
driving i know California at least in some parts 
they have buses because uh back in 2001 i went  
to California i stayed there for a couple 
of months and i was able to navigate by bus
she um she never learned how to drive i never 
think she already knew how to drive but she  
don't drive that far but it's mostly i know 
because she's working in Albertson she does  
um bus all the time ever drove or uh or in the 
afternoon in the morning her shift uh her husband  
will drop her off her husband will either pick her 
up or she will ride the bus and plus you know like  
grocery shopping nowadays especially with the 
pandemic one of the positives of pandemic is  
the online grocery shopping and curbside or also 
delivery right yeah just for a little amount of  
money five dollars Instacart is there right yeah i 
am curious about your kids so you are you now have  
two teenagers correct yeah how was it racing 
because you were raised in the Philippines and  
now you are raising your teenage girls in the 
u.s was it like did you apply whatever your mom
like it's it's really different i mean they're 
upbringing here the culture here the surroundings  
you know their environment here where they go to 
school and uh it's really different our culture  
it's kind of hard to apply our cultures kind some 
of it i can like what uh work hard uh study hard  
pull first um not in a relationship even though 
uh my eldest now is in a relationship uh-huh  
how did you react that's like 17 years 
old no she's only 16. uh-huh she's 16  
and then she has a boyfriend yes so okay 
how how did mommy grace react to that  
i was furious you know but um later on i i 
had you know like accept the fact that she  
it is what it is that she is in the 
relationship but i say at the same  
time i'm supporting her at the same time do 
you know the parents of the boyfriend yeah  
yep the parents had like a business you know 
how those signs yes for are they designing  
it they're making designer like you know 
mcdonald's signed or oh okay business signages  
that's what that's what the parents business i 
kinda you kind of gave me an impression that you  
grew up in a conservative family so how about 
your uh daughters they are growing up here they  
were born here in the u.s they're they're really 
conservative since we raised them in a in an  
athletic athlete environment they're very both 
athletic what kind of sports do they play play  
soccer both of them oh wow so the youngest 
is more of athletic uh she's she's in a um  
high school mars or jb or junior varsity so same 
time she were she plays the club too you know like  
a club uh soccer and then my young my eldest 
is only she's playing on a club you know she  
get easily uh discouraged um she's been trying 
out the high school and she'd never get picked
i was just gonna stick on my club you 
know the clock playing you know they  
play uh indoor outdoor indoor and then outdoor 
during the fall or in the springtime so yeah  
but young members of these clubs uh gonna 
help them get scholarships in college  
uh my my little one my 
youngest one is um yeah they  
they could i think uh my young my eldest is trying 
academic she's trying out um her in her school um  
youngest one is i think maybe if she keeps doing 
this she'll probably get an athletic scholarship  
grace you mentioned earlier you know raising 
kids is really expensive and it's a fact can  
you help me understand how expensive it is 
to raise kids like i mean not the food but  
just like for the preparation for 
college are you are you going to  
help them fund their education more likely will 
help them you know the boarding you'll stay here  
still at the house while they're working other 
uh in school and not probably the whole thing  
because we're in the middle class we don't 
really have a whole a lot of money prepared  
like a savings for their school they really 
have to probably go through uh a um student loan
there are still grants available for them correct 
yeah so that's probably what's gonna happen  
we don't really have that five to nine savings 
for the uh college kids so we really just a  
middle class family yeah so probably yeah student 
loan and then we'll support them probably books  
or something like that but a big chunk will be 
taken uh via the student loan and then of course  
when they're driving already they have their 
car they have to buy their own car are they both  
driving now she's in the learning learner's permit 
right now she has a driving test so imagine you're  
gonna buy a used car for them gonna be added in 
your insurance and your insurance skyrocketed  
so yeah there's a lot of involved raising a kid 
do you expect your kids to move out of the house  
ah i will keep them as much as i can you know how 
it is like uh as a parent you you want them to be  
uh what they call that you you want them uh with 
you till you know there you prepare yourself that  
hey they're not kids anymore they have to go out 
and move out there uh out in adventure or you know  
like venture themselves be independent because you 
know in the Philippines i think we do we overdo it  
uh sometimes even a child already has his own 
child and they still live with their parents  
yes i'm not sure probably they'll be independent 
they'll have their own lives you know when maybe  
five ten years from now who knows so yeah right 
now yeah i'll probably keep them as much as i can  
i hear a lot of stories about kids moving out 
for college and it is really very emotionally  
you know charged for the parents i see some 
friends post on Facebook that they are like  
really not looking forward to the day that they 
will drop off their kids to their college um  
we as much as possible we wanted them here 
you know close by college here but if they get  
uh like the young youngest if they have she uh 
get a scholarship athlete from other state yeah we  
we will be forced to let her go and have be on 
her own well and that's the time also they could  
learn they're on their own learn how to manage 
their time clean their dorm or apartment but at  
the same time it's a responsibility it's like us 
as an adult you know as a parent we're working  
taking care of the household taking care of the 
kids paying bills so same thing as them there's  
they have to get their grades up there if 
she's an athlete she has to you know um get  
her maintain her grades and then she play the the 
soccer and then she has to maintain her her dorm  
it sounds like you have or your family have set 
those expectations for your kids or these are the  
things that you know like to prepare to help you 
prepare for the future that you will be out of the  
care of your parents is that how your parents 
also uh both troy and your probably parents  
uh did to you that you are actually doing 
to your kids also or you just learned that  
when you got here in the u.s uh i think i just 
learned we learned it in here that you you really  
have to in the Philippines work close time that 
yeah even we have husband and kids we're still  
living together no when you uh move out 
you had a family you have to move out  
and you have to be on your own you wanted your 
kids to be the same way to be independent uh  
go through life on their own learn from it um 
do you guys plan to retire in the Philippines  
i wanted i wanted i want to retire i don't 
think he wants to retire there has he ever
