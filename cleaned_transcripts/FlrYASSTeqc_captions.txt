Thank you for coming to the taping.
The last thing I did
was for Kevin Hart,
and he messed with me right before 
I went on the show.
He looked at me
and was like, "you know what, man?
"You look like the bootleg version
"of Dwayne The Rock Johnson."
I was like,
you look like the bootleg version
of a normal-sized man.
(audience laughing)
I didn't say that out loud.
It was more like, thank you.
(audience laughing)
The last show I did before the COVID
was for the Vietnam War vets and--
oh, yeah, give them a round
of applause.
(audience applauding)
My manager tells me to wear
a full army outfit to support
their cause.
Now, that's the stupidest thing
to wear when you're Asian,
and you're playing for a bunch
of Vietnam War vets.
(audience laughing)
I got heckled.
"They're still alive."
It was really scary.
That's what I'm sa--
(audience laughing)
I started comedy in 1995.
My first year in comedy,
I had to tell the audience I was
Chinese because nobody knew what
the heck a Filipino was back then.
(audience laughing)
What's that, Philadelphia?
What is that?
(audience laughing)
We were around the '90s
because nobody knew who we were.
We're like kale.
(audience laughing)
If you're not laughing, sir, 
you're really unhealthy, so.
(audience laughing)
My parents met in the '70s.
We started off in the ghetto.
My dad worked really hard to get us
out of the ghetto.
We're rich Filipinos in the '90s.
This is before rich Filipinos,
before Bruno Mars, before Manny
Pacquiao the boxer,
before the Jabbawockeez.
(audience laughing)
If you don't know the Jabbawockeez,
they're a Filipino dance group
with one Black guy
for the hard moves and --
(audience laughing)
we don't have strong necks
as Filipinos.
Do the headspins, like,
(cracking sound)
"Shoot.
(audience laughing)
"Wait, I'm also a nurse.
"I'll heal myself.
"Yay!"
(audience laughing)
We were rich, but our faces do not
match the neighborhood we lived in.
I remember my dad was working
in the lawn.
The neighbor came over to my dad
and asked him, "hey, man.
"How much does the owner pay you
"per week to work on his lawn?"
My dad was so smart.
He was like, $1,000 a week.
(audience laughing)
I can give you a deal for 800.
(audience laughing)
The guy goes, "cool."
So my dad goes in the house, 
tells my brother and I 
we got summer jobs
for 100 bucks a week each.
(audience laughing)
My dad invented outsourcing
before India.
Anyways, that's OK.
The one Indian guy is laughing.
(audience laughing)
It's cool.
I'm so happy to do this because this
is my first month back
after the whole year of pandemic,
and it's a real audience
with real feeling.
(audience cheering)
This is not a Zoom show.
(audience cheering)
I've been doing Zoom shows
for the whole year.
They mute the audience.
(audience laughing)
So when I do the punch line,
I don't hear any laughter.
So I have to create it in my head
like a narcissist.
I'm funny right now.
So hot, too.
(audience laughing)
And you stare at yourself for 45
minutes just-- now,
we all look at ourselves
in the mirror every morning.
After 10 minutes, you're done.
Imagine 45 minutes straight.
You know how disgusting you look.
You compare-- like my eyebrows
shorter than this eyebrow.
I have a giant forehead.
I had no idea.
My forehead is huge.
I can put my face on my forehead
and talk to you like this.
I have a massive wart,
plus I'm receding.
That's global warming on my head.
(audience laughing)
My ice cap is melting.
(audience laughing)
When we guys lose hair here
we counter it with the beard.
Do you see that?
The balder the head, the bigger
the beard gets.
I'm trying to recreate their face
upside down.
(audience laughing)
If you're white or Black, grow
that beard as thick as you want,
you look good.
If you're Asian, no, you got to stop
right here.
Any more than this brings our faces
back 5,000 years.
(audience laughing)
Is that a samurai at the bus stop?
(audience laughing)
It does make you look tough 
you got that beard.
Not that tough.
I'm allergic to too many things
to be tough.
Like, if we got in a fight
and you threw peanuts on my face,
I would cry and pass out.
You win the fight.
(audience laughing)
I'm allergic to too many things,
peanuts, peas, chickpeas, soy,
lentil, cats.
Man, I lost all my lesbian friends.
(audience laughing)
No offense.
Listen, guys.
(audience laughing)
It's so cute.
(audience laughing)
I'm allergic to soy sauce.
I'm freaking Asian.
That's our ketchup.
That's like white people were
allergic to--
I don't know-- guilt. Anyways,
I say that because it hurts you,
and you deserve it.
No, I just say that because you
can't be racist to white people.
It doesn't work.
It just bounces off your chest
like Superman
and you don't care.
I try it all the time.
Cracker-- I like crackers.
(audience laughing)
I just think certain things in life
should be white.
I think people want to represented
in television, too, so things on TV
should just be white in the game
show Cash Cab.
They're going to be hosted
by a white guy.
Any other race would be too
scary for the contestants.
(audience laughing)
A Mexican, "hey, vato.
"Lock the doors.
"Let me ask you a couple
"of questions."
(audience laughing)
Or the hit movie Back to the Future
because only a white guy
go back in 1955 and then return.
(audience laughing)
Come on.
If it was me, the movie would be
called Escape to the Future,
let's be honest.
(audience laughing)
I'm happy Santa Claus is white.
That's a good call.
Santa Clause should be white.
If there was any of the race coming
down your chimney at 2 o'clock
in the morning, call the police.
(audience laughing)
Certain races in sports can't mix.
Filipinos and Mexicans, we couldn't
be on certain sports.
We could be in curling.
Not that we wouldn't be good at it.
This guy is an amazing sweeper,
is what-- this looks pretty racist.
(audience laughing)
Rosa, you're amazing.
"Oh, it's like a part-time job."
(audience laughing)
It's OK to laugh.
I'm the one-- it's OK.
Me and the brown guy,
we're having a good time.
(audience cheering)
Oh, man.
My dad's a hard-core Christian.
I love him.
But he gets really angry when they
do dirty material.
He gets really upset.
"Stop that.
(audience laughing)
"Stop talking about this one.
"God will get mad at you."
That's my dad's favorite saying,
"God will get mad at you.
"One day, they'll be talking bull
"crap on the streets,
"talking about this one.
"And the gloves will open.
"A giant fist will come and punch you
"in the face."
(audience laughing)
Usually, at this time, I'm overseas.
I go across--
I go around 30 countries a year.
And first time, I went to Asia
five years ago.
An Asian should go, right?
Not what I thought.
We'd totally be lied to in America.
First country I went to Asia
was Korea.
Guess what guys?
No Korean barbecue
buffets anywhere.
I'm like, this is bull.
I'm going to South Korea.
(audience laughing)
Next country I went to was China.
Check this out.
No fortune cookies in China.
It was invented in the 1800s in
San Francisco.
I was like, where's my fortune
cookie?
"What's that?"
It's a cookie with a note inside
that tells you your future.
"Oh, you're going to get diabetes.
"You've been here three times
"this week."
(audience laughing)
Then I went to India,
my favorite place.
Love Mumbai, no 7-Elevens.
I'm like, this is weird.
(audience laughing)
In Japan, it takes you 10 years
to become a professional sushi chef.
That's a long time learning to cook
something that doesn't 
need to be cooked
in the first place.
This is sushi fish before you catch
the fish.
I think originally,
sushi was the Japanese word
for stove not working.
(audience cheering)
I'm happy you guys laughed
at that joke.
You're not as PC.
I'm from Canada.
They're really PC out there.
That's where all the Karens 
came from.
And this one lady was like, "that was
"racist against Japanese people."
I'm like, why?
"Because you did their accent."
I'm like, look, man.
I did that joke in Japan.
They love the joke.
They didn't get it,
but they're like, oh, you sound
exactly like us.
(audience laughing)
Oh, (pretend Japanese)
(audience laughing)
Look, I'm not being racist,
I'm being racial.
Let me just tell you right now, OK?
There's a big difference.
Well, let's understand this.
When you're racist, you're there
to hurt the other culture
on purpose.
When you're racial, you're racist,
but you pretend you're not.
(audience laughing)
Now the truth is,
if I do a joke
about another race,
I do it in front of that race.
If they like it, I keep it.
If they don't like it,
I don't do it.
But if they like it and say,
I can't do it, I say, shut up.
It's your fault. You laughed.
(audience laughing)
Here's the gray area.
We all have to know what
the gray area is.
We all have people in our family
and friends of different cultures,
religions, and backgrounds.
We love them like family.
And the way you joke around
is the way you joke around.
It's nobody's business.
And if people want to come in
and say, you, you don't know us.
Get the heck out
of our racial party.
Because it's true.
Some people make you feel bad.
Do you ever feel bad?
You're like, oh my gosh,
I think that was racist.
Oh my gosh, my thoughts
are even more racist.
(audience laughing)
And then this guy named Yoshi,
like, Yoshi, where are you from?
"Japan."
Real Japan?
"Okinawa, Japan."
Like ninja Japan?
"Why do you say ninja?"
(audience laughing)
And I said sorry, and I bow.
And I'm like, why'd I do that?
(audience laughing)
"Why do you bow like that?"
That's what you guys do?
He's like, "no, no, no."
Then he cuts like this, hai,
like the opposite of your what's up.
(audience laughing)
And by the way,
it's like, I hate talking
about this, but it's happening
outside.
They're killing Black people
outside.
They're killing Asians.
They're killing white people
in movies and I hate that.
And my cousin's so stupid.
She's like, "you know what?
"Don't worry, Ron.
"We're safe.
"We're not Chinese.
"We're Filipino."
I'm like, are you crazy?
You think the racists know
the difference between Chinese
and Filipino?
Do you know the difference
between Chinese and Filipino
to a racist?
It's a difference between a Honda
Civic and a tinted Honda Civic.
(audience laughing)
Looks a little darker but 
more stylish.
That's it!
(audience laughing)
Filipinos were not even full Asian,
and the government didn't know
we were.
They just put us
in an Asian category.
We're actually mixed.
We're half Asian and half Latino.
When my parents came to Canada,
they had to fill out a form
for the government
to choose what race they were.
They had to checkmark white, Black,
Latino, Asian, and Middle Eastern.
We checkmarked Asian and then
Latino, have two lines drawn to one,
and then write Filipino.
Those two are half Asian and half
Latino.
So what happened was back 
in the day in the 1500s,
Spain went to Philippines,
made love to everybody,
and then left us.
(audience laughing)
He's like, "where's your dad?"
On those boats.
"Where are they going?"
To the Caribbean.
Why?
"To make Cubans now."
(audience laughing)
That joke never works in Miami
by the way.
(audience laughing)
My parents taught me English.
It was kind of weird because they
had the Filipino accents.
So I grew up with an accent.
You know how messed up that was?
I had a Filipino accent growing up,
but I wasn't born
in the Philippines.
I didn't know how to speak Filipino
either.
I just had a Filipino accent
as a kid.
The teachers like said, 
"where are you from?"
Canada.
(audience laughing)
"Are you sure?"
Positive.
(audience laughing)
"You can't speak any Filipino?"
Not at all.
"This kid's a North Korean spy,
"for sure."
(audience laughing)
I remember the report card read,
Ron has a problem, pronouncing
his Fs and Ps and Vs and Bs.
He pronounces friends as priends.
My dad's like, "why do you pronounce
"priends as priends?
"Who taught that to you?
"You have a preaking froblem.
"You know that?"
(audience laughing)
I'm big for a Filipino, too.
My dad isn't even five feet tall.
He keeps looking at me like
I'm a monster.
Look how big you are.
(audience laughing)
Look at my creation.
(audience laughing)
Like Frankenstein.
(audience laughing)
They love seafood.
They love fish, tilapia,
red snapper.
My dad's favorite fish is called
milkfish.
It's from the Philippines.
There's a million bones in the fish,
and he can't get enough of it.
Here's my dad every Sunday morning.
"Number one fish
"from the Philippines, milkfish,
"number one.
(audience laughing)
(gagging)
"Call the doctor."
(gagging)
The cat looked at him like,
(cat hissing)
"call the doctors."
(gagging)
We have delicacy-- any Filipinos
here make some noise?
OK.
(audience laughing)
You're not Filipino right here?
No?
You?
No?
Just say you are.
Anyways, you make me feel
comfortable.
(audience laughing)
We have delicacies in our community.
Every culture is a delicacy, 
which means it's gross.
That's why they call it a delicacy.
You have to be
delicate to the situation.
That's like having an ugly child.
You can't call the child ugly.
You have to call it smart.
You know, it's--
He's a genius.
He'll be fine.
Look away.
(audience laughing)
Filipinos has this one delicacy
called balut.
(groaning)
Wait, you guys know this?
Do you have Filipinos
in your basement?
What's going on?
(audience laughing)
If you don't know,
it's a duck embryo.
Relax.
I'm not selling them to you
after the shows,
(audience laughing)
I'll sign your balut.
(audience laughing)
To explain the first week
is the embryo, the yoke,
the fourth week is the bird.
It's right smack dab in the middle.
I don't know how Filipinos eat this.
We couldn't wait for the process
to end.
Could they pull the plug out.
I'm hungry over here.
I saw this on that TV
show Fear Factor.
Remember that Joe Rogan show?
This guy wouldn't eat balut
for $50,000.
My dad was like, "that's bullcrap.
"I have two in my pocket right now.
"50,000, very easy."
(gagging)
(audience laughing)
My dad used to sell these baluts
to the Filipino community in Toronto
back in the '80s.
When I was six years old,
I was a prankster.
What I would do, take a cook balut
come home, bring it to school,
put it under a tree,
take the balut halfway out to make
it look like it fell from the nest.
I know.
I was a messed up kid.
I went to therapy for this.
But anyways, and the kids
would gather.
Oh my gosh, there's a baby bird that
fell from the tree.
That's so sad.
I walk in, "how much
"would you pay me to eat it?"
(audience laughing)
I made $100 at six years old.
I was a diabolical genius.
The principal called my dad, 
"Mr. Josol, your son's 
"eating dead birds
"falling from trees."
Are you stupid?
"No, no."
That was a scam.
They made $100 with one balut.
And I take you, bring it
in our school, and you can do it
again.
You're a genius.
Look at my creation.
(gagging)
(audience laughing)
Here's a question for the room.
Who's more emotional when it comes
to the breakup?
Men or women?
- Women.
- I didn't say, hmmmm.
(audience laughing)
This is Judge Judy, answer quick.
(audience laughing)
I believe men are because men are
more--
we get angry too quick.
When a guy breaks up with you,
"it's over.
"We're done.
"Forget about it.
"I hate you."
And then a minute later like, 
Why did I say all that bullcrap?
I got to pretend I'm happy now?
Women break up differently.
Women don't see,
they compartmentalize the breakups.
They can do something we can't do.
They can go, OK, let's look
at the situation.
OK, I know I can't break up now
because it's all about timing.
I can't breakup now
because my birthday's next week.
And he's bringing me to the Dry Bar
show.
(audience laughing)
What I'm saying is some of you
guys are going to get dumped
after this show.
(audience laughing)
So my dad-- really, I love my dad.
He's one of the greatest guys.
He taught me a lot of things.
He also taught me how to fight.
He was a martial artist.
And I got into Brazilian jujitsu.
What happened was-- so the UFC--
here's a quick story before I
continue.
The UFC started in 1993 in Denver,
Colorado, but it was happening
in Brazil in the '30s.
A family called the Gracie family
learned jujitsu
from Japanese tourists,
took it in their own family,
and then made it a martial art
on the streets.
And in 1992, they promoted the UFC
through this thing called the Gracie
Jujitsu Challenge.
If you can beat any Gracie brothers,
you get $10,000.
So in 1992, when I was 18,
I flew to California to fight one
of the brothers.
And as you can tell,
I'm doing stand-up comedy 'cause
the fight didn't go too well.
(audience laughing)
This is when you know people are
good at what they do.
They don't take nothing serious.
It's too easy.
I walked in, I'm, I want to fight.
I want that 10 grand.
They're like, "oh, very cute
"very cute.
"Sign the waiver.
"After you lose, we have cookies
"and milk for you."
I'm like, how do you know I'm going
to lose?
"You took off your shirt.
"You're a D cup.
"You will lose."
(audience laughing)
So I put my shirt back on.
And in wrestling,
I had to fight this guy 
Hoist Gracie.
Now Hoist Gracie in 1992,
nobody knew who he was.
But he won the first two UFCs,
right?
And so he was 26 years old, 6' 2."
He couldn't speak English yet,
so I had to fight him.
And I was a wrestler in high school.
So this was my thought,
I'm going to pick him up, put him
down, and beat him up, and take
that 10 grand.
This is why you'll fight
a professional fighter.
This is how fast I'll win.
I picked him up, put him down.
Right before I punched him,
I woke up.
(audience laughing)
What happened was I charged him,
grabbed his legs, and picked him up
over my head.
I thought I won it right away.
I didn't know there were counters
to different moves.
My head was under his armpit,
so he took his other bicep,
grabbed it.
When he land-- when I slammed him,
he choked me up 
with my own body weight
(audience laughing)
to stop the guillotine.
I was out cold in a right angle
position.
(audience laughing)
When I woke up, I'm like,
what happened?
He's like, "you didn't tap out."
I'm like, why can you speak English
now?
(audience laughing)
"If you can't breathe, tap me,
"I'll let you go."
Why didn't you tell me all that
before we fought man?
Across the room, I see my brother
getting choked up with his brother.
I'm like, "tap out, they're cheaters."
(audience laughing)
You ever learn something in life
when you're a child
or you're younger,
then it comes back to you years
later?
It's such a weird thing, right?
I remember when I was-- that was 18.
So literally, 20 years later,
my brother and I are in a bar.
We see this fight.
These guys are beating up these two
guys.
And we're like, that was crazy.
And they're like, "you want some,
"too?"
I was like, no, I've eaten,
and I'm full, right?
That got them pissed,
so they charged at us
and put us against a wall.
They tried to take us down
by our legs.
I was like, well, they're beat.
I turned to my brother and go,
we know the counter to this move.
Take your guy.
I'll take my guy.
Pull!
Both these guys passed out.
Cops came in.
What happened here?
Not our fault. 
They know how to tap out.
(audience laughing)
Here's my last story.
So I started comedy in 1995.
My first year in comedy,
I met this guy who was 
Russell Peters.
He was one of my first friends.
Yeah.
And he blew up on YouTube in 2004
as an East Indian comic, really
world-famous, right?
I'm still friends with him today,
got to open up for Vegas
20,000 people, kind of like this.
And--
(audience laughing)
And there was more of this
in the audience and--
he's still laughing.
It's OK.
(audience laughing)
And so basically, I opened up
for him in Vegas, right?
And he's a very generous guy.
One time, he was driving
on Hollywood Boulevard,
and he saw one of our comic friends
who was sleeping in his car
with his wife and newborn baby.
It's like 2:00 in the morning.
He knocked on the window.
What do you do in the car?
The guy's just crying.
He's like, "I'm so embarrassed plus
"I'm homeless."
He was like, you don't have to be
embarrassed.
Russell was so sad.
He gave enough money
to stay in an apartment for three
years with his whole family.
When I heard this, I was so touched.
I drove to Russell's house,
and I slept in my car.
(audience laughing)
I'm so embarrassed.
I'm homeless.
"You should be embarrassed.
"There's two cleaners are coming
"in 30 minutes, idiot."
(audience laughing)
He's a very serious guy.
So after me and my friend Jason
open up for Russell in Vegas,
they paid us.
And then Jason comes up to us
and he's like, "Ron, Russell gave me
"another 500 bucks."
I'm like, how?
"I just asked him, and he gave it
"to me."
I'm like, I could never do that.
I can never ask my rich friends
for money.
That's against my morals.
I could bait him, though.
(audience laughing)
That's not asking, right?
It's like OxyContin.
It's not heroin.
There's a receipt.
(audience laughing)
Caught you.
He laughed too much.
Anyways, so I'm trying to bait
this guy to give me money,
all right?
So I'm like playing in this lottery.
It's just like, oh, if I don't win
the money back, I messed up.
I might have to sleep in my car
again.
He didn't even look at me,
so I leave.
And I noticed something, 
when you're subtle,
when you're trying to do things,
people do respond to me,
you have to be subtle.
So this is a real emotion.
I was walking away.
I was upset.
Ever seen a pebble in your ground
and you kick it because you're sad?
It was like, hm, shucks.
He's like, "are you OK?"
I'm like, that worked.
I'm like, yeah?
"Do you want some money?"
I'm like, I don't know.
"If you want some money, just ask."
I can't ask you for money.
You know what he does?
He takes from his wallet,
puts it in my hand.
He goes, "there's $1,000 right there
"for you."
I'm like, I can't take this Russ.
He's like, "Ron, I make $30 million
"this year.
"Giving you $1,000 is like you giving
"your friend $1."
I was like, why are you being so
cheap?
(audience laughing)
Hey, you guys have been amazing
thank you.
(audience cheering)
