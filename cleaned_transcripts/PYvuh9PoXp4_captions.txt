Hi, I'm Christopher from A Kids Perspective.
Today i'm on the Fly Away Bus on my way to
LAX to start my journey.
As you've noticed, my hair is braided.
To me it looks like a row in a farm field.
I'll check back with you later at the airport.
I'm going to see my family, my uncles, cousins and the rest of my family.
So peace, See you soon.
So now i'm here at the airport waiting for
our shuttle bus to take us to the airplane.
By that time i'll be ready to do this.
It's very exciting to meet the rest of my
family and
i'm going to have a really goodtime.
So i've just realized i only know one filipino
word which is Salamat which means thank you.
I don't know any more so this is going to
be really hard to communicate.
I"m going to have a hard time but at least
i'm learning.
Now i'm on the shuttle that takes to the plane
and were about to take off.
I'm about to go on the airplane.
This is really exciting.
yeah
yes
So Now i'm still in side the tunnel. And gonna show a passport.
So now i'm getting ready to go aboard inside
but right now i'm in the tunnel.
almost ready to go to the Phililpines.
Right now i'm in the airplane on my way to
the philippines.
I want to select a movie but don't want to
push the buttons.
It's really exciting and having a good time
so far it's going to be fun definately.

watch videos
