eating lunch at jollibee home of the famous  
chicken joy the strawberry is between 39th and 
40th on the 8th avenue near times square and  
poor authority today we are here to try the new 
chicken sandwich it's called the chicken witch  
this chicken which looks really good really crispy 
really juicy we just got our free one at chicken  
sandwich lawyer dot com link right here with all 
the fierce chicken sandwich competition around the  
world right now from all the food places we gotta 
give this one a try and see how it measures up
just got our food let's try it out
the worst thing that could 
happen happened check this out  
spill this these sandwiches better be juicy
that's true i don't want to choke 
minus a soda what else do we have  
okay we got two chicken sandwiches the gravy for 
our chicken joy and jolly spaghetti we also have  
the peach mango pie and the pie let's try the 
original chicken witch they got rid of the sand  
and the chicken sandwich ooh 
all right so okay so we have the  
sandwich in here and i have a special 
sauce special sauce in here it's yellow
ready yeah go for
it oh yeah it's really flavorful it doesn't 
taste like any of the other chicken sandwiches  
there's a special really oh you just oh look look 
you can see the juice i don't know if you can see  
it but i see it it's so it's really juicy it's 
really good yeah yeah i might eat really quick
this is pretty thick though it has a jalape 
special taste to it secret ingredient right
but the chicken itself is really 
good wow yeah so impressive yum
here we go
all right here we have the 
spicy one this one has some  
spicy pepper in here actually 
and some orange sauce
wow it's just wow this is pretty darn good 
wow definitely a kick to it it's just as juicy
all right man you have to try this one
this is spicy some good chicken what's spicy now 
yeah let's manageable right it's not really spicy  
it looks like buffalo sauce but 
i can't it's probably not buffalo
it's so good i love the
sugar you definitely got the recipe now to keep 
it juicy we ordered this about 20 minutes ago  
it actually is juicy they make it fresh because 
the lime was pretty long so they have to keep  
making and making these i know they look crispy 
from the outside but it's actually not crispy  
these chicken sandwiches have a lot more 
flavor than the chick-fil-a sandwiches  
in my opinion i think these are more savory  
and chick-fil-a remember it's more salty 
but it's just as good yeah they're both  
really good but yeah this is different you 
definitely gotta try this out i love these
i like my food really savory and really 
flavorful this is really good this is a  
good thick sandwich with just the chicken and 
the bread nothing else oh that's true yeah  
they don't add anything else they usually 
like to get pickled it's not needed switch
these pepper are the real deal it's what we have 
at home it's pretty spicy if you eat the pepper
pepper my pepper bell but usually i like to go to 
jalapeno to get you know the jolly spaghetti the  
chicken joys but i think this one i would get this 
again as well how is it compared to a mcchicken  
oh okay so my chicken is you know for smaller 
less taste like chicken is good when you're  
you're in a pinch and my chicken is good for like 
a snack this is more of a meal actually you need  
a little bit more than this corn meal but there 
is a surprise difference this is worth a lot more  
quality chicken yeah really good killing me 
yeah not a murderer you had the last fight
five years later five years later how 
dare you you legit took the last bite  
yeah all right done with that good stuff
voila all right here we have some jollibee staples  
the chicken joy i believe it's called yeah 
the chicken joy and the jelly spaghetti you  
already know it's gonna be good yeah 
and this is for the chicken joy gravy
all right all right all right
just makes you want to take your shirt off
that sweet pasta sauce it's amazing ben

he really likes my seafood and the best way to 
enjoy it is if he had soda and then shirtless

it'd be better if it was hot though but it's 
really good i love the sweetness oh look oh yes
