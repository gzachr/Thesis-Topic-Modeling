the Philippines the first time we're back in over 
three years and honestly it feels surreal to be  
here in this video we're checking out more of Cebu 
City and while exploring we can't help but notice  
how everything has changed I'm Trevor and this is 
Anna Welcome to our brand new series here in the  
Philippines make sure to hit subscribe and click 
the like button so you don't miss a single video  
a huge thanks to our channel members and patrons 
for making these videos possible this is Cebu City
today we're going to be talking about how the 
Philippines has changed at least how it has  
changed for us because last time we were here 
it was under very different circumstances and  
we are still in seduce in this video we're going 
to be exploring a little bit more of what we did  
not see in the last video maybe we'll be eating 
some stuff as well so if you have not watched the  
last video very important to go back and watch 
it because we give you a lot of context about  
why we're here about our history here also what 
our plans are for our full month here in Cebu in  
the Philippines it is loud here huh yeah we're 
kind of in the busy part I think this is like  
the business sector of the city around Ayala Mall 
yeah we're close to the mall again and you can see  
all this traffic this way yeah the city though 
it's really pretty very modern and developed  
and that's something we're going to talk about 
yeah for sure so first off we have to bring up  
just how big this city is how much bigger it is 
than we thought huh yeah I know I didn't really  
I guess I didn't really know what to expect I 
watched a few videos on it I knew a little bit  
but in general I didn't realize there's so many 
different areas of the city that it was really  
developed like you walk everywhere and you see all 
these brands that you know there's a huge building  
also some like more rundown areas as well but it's 
like a bunch of different sectors in the city and  
even like when we're searching for something 
always like oh that doesn't look far away on  
the map so then you map and you're like oh it's 
like a 15 minute fifth five zero minute walk  
that so that's just some of the things that 
come to mind because remember for us kind of  
our memories of the Philippines are being trapped 
in El Nido on a beautiful gorgeous Beach and this  
is quite the change I mean we are we are in a 
massive city that is very modern and it's very  
beautiful I think for those of you that have never 
been to the Philippines or to Southeast Asia you  
might when you think of it either think of a lot 
of beaches or kind of like slums in the big cities  
but it's so developed here there's actually 
constant development happening you might be  
able to hear construction now there are cranes 
literally all over the place I'm gonna guess  
that in the past tennis years it's this city has 
probably changed exponentially maybe people in  
the comments that are from here can let us know 
and I'm gonna guess just based on the amount of  
construction that's happening now then in the next 
few years it's going to be a lot different as well  
well you know us we are hungry and we found this 
great little cafe because we're looking for some  
breakfast a Filipino breakfast and it's been a 
while you guys since we've had something like this  
now it's been a few years should be more specific 
but this is called chasalog now we were trying to  
remember if we had that in the past I'm not sure 
if we did but it looks great this is actually  
sausage that's kind of browned up I think it's 
called like Bunga Cog it's I think that's like  
the filipino word you can see some egg and there's 
some very special rice down there we'll talk about  
that rice and I think uh banana so as Trevor 
just said this is called chose the log and the  
reason it's called that is because it's made with 
chorizo so it's like I guess the breakfasts are  
kind of called the logs which I think Me Maybe 
rice and egg the person here told us log means  
egg I believe someone can correct us but I'm 
totally off here we used to have a breakfast  
back in lockdown days long Salon which I think 
was made with sausage and tapsilog which was some  
sort of beef sausage I think it was beef Yeah so 
basically this is maybe a new one for us as Trevor  
said I don't know if we actually had it with three 
though but it comes with garlic rice there's some  
bananas on the side and then fried eggs on the top 
I think I have a little bit of everything here can  
I tell you how excited I am for garlic rice I know 
it sounds really basic and I'm sure I can make  
garlic rice at home but you don't really see it in 
other places but it's so good in my memory anyway
oh my God that just honestly tastes like Nostalgia 
to me I know if you didn't watch our last video  
you might not know the history of us getting 
locked down in El Nido for months and months  
and months now for a long time we couldn't 
even leave our hotel so we'd have something  
like this for breakfast a few times a week and 
it just whoa it just takes me back I love garlic  
rice going back I'm gonna keep talking about this 
it's so good it's so simple it's so delicious got  
the egg I need to try the chorizo again because I 
didn't only have a tiny little piece back oh wow  
that's incredible it's a little 
bit sweet I'm not surprised because  
Filipinos definitely likes we think 
it's almost like like candied chorizo  
so it's salty and sweet at the same 
time all right she sold me you guys
whoa oh oh I forgot how much I needed this in 
my life well I think it's safe to say a one  
thing that has not changed is the food it's still 
delicious spoiled little alert this is awesome you  
guys like honestly one of my favorite breakfast 
dishes you can get and it's typical Filipino dish  
all it does is make me want to try more we have a 
whole entire month here to try different kinds of  
breakfast but yeah figure out how much I needed 
this in my life another thing that has changed  
for us at least this time in the Philippines is 
there's no masks or curfews or restrictions this  
time you guys I mean again last time we were here 
it was a very different different circumstances  
and uh yeah we had to follow all those rules of 
course which we did but this time we have freedom  
like we have complete freedom to do whatever we 
want to do in this beautiful country and that  
feels really great so if you're wondering about 
like flying in and what the restrictions are there  
if there's anything you have to do this is March 
2023 so if you're watching this in the future  
sure to do your own research because things change 
all the time but we basically had each had to fill  
out an online form you have to upload your the 
certificate with like two doubts I think it's two  
doses they require I'm not sure about testing 
if you don't have that but you can look that  
up yourself and basically you upload that you put 
in all your information where you're staying your  
flights and all that stuff and you get a QR code 
and then when you get off your plane right before  
you go into immigration there's a little spot to 
scan your QR code PPP well should we take them to  
another part of the city let's do it welcome to IT 
Park this is the area that we heard about the most  
when we came to Cebu City huh yeah this seems 
to be the area that if you look up like where  
the stay or like the most modern the best areas 
to stay in Cebu this seems to be the newest and  
the coolest place to be I think a lot of people 
live here there's a lot of condos yeah sidewalks  
like it feels very modern it's very interesting 
because to get here you actually go through some  
of the older parts of the city and there's like a 
divide you just get to this new part you might be  
able to see a sign behind me there's like another 
Mall back there so I think the city is actually be  
full of many many many malls Filipinos like their 
malls but I mean take a look just what's around us  
there's so many high rises and they all seem brand 
spanking new there's no shortage of restaurants  
and cafes and probably everything you want here I 
think there's some bars I think there's a rooftop  
bar funny enough so I think a lot of people come 
here and like live in work and stay and play in  
this area I think it is yeah it is a work day 
sometimes you know as a full-time traveler you  
kind of forget what day of the week it's a work 
day so I bet you in a couple of hours from now  
it'll get really really busy around here they do 
have all sorts of Brands here as well people from  
outside the Philippines maybe you wouldn't know 
that maybe you would but they have everything here  
funny enough fun fact for you fellow Canadians in 
Manila and throughout parts of Southeast Asia and  
the Middle East we've seen lots of Tim Hortons 
yeah well some people might not know what Tim  
Hortons is Right Canadians will so for those 
of you that don't know what Tim Hortons is it's  
kind of like a Dunkin Donuts for those of you 
from the states except it's like Canada's thing  
but here's here's the real thing it's kind of 
bad coffee in my opinion don't hate me Canada  
don't hate me I just think there's lots of better 
coffee options in Canada I don't even consider two  
horns coffee and there's amazing coffee options 
here in the Philippines so in general I'd say  
crossing the road here not too bad surprisingly 
chilled out and we should talk about the reason  
like why we came over to this area in general huh 
well one being that we are going to be jumping in  
and out of the city quite a lot throughout the 
month because we are going to well we sort of  
hinted in this video or the last video I don't 
even remember that we're going to an island next  
yeah and then we're going to another Island later 
on in the month and we're still trying to figure  
out the rest of our itinerary but we're going 
to be in and out of the city a couple of times  
so the question is next time do we want to stay 
here our initial thoughts is we stay here it's  
way quieter very modern places like this behind 
me I think it's called the park social it looks  
like a beer garden so we might have to check that 
out and there's just interesting buildings around  
there's also some kind of like triangular building 
straight ahead of us that uh you're about to see  
okay we got close up to it and it's really not 
that cool it's actually quite dirty and everything  
I don't know what this is greenhouse or something 
it's odd that it's in the middle of like all these  
really nice buildings clearly it was something 
maybe it's being renovated well maybe hopefully  
it turns into something because it's really cool 
looking another thing we've just been discussing  
about this area is it seems like a good place to 
live if you were going to live in the city this  
seems to have it all it's a nice little uh Green 
Park over there and if they if you guys don't know  
we've been kind of traveling the world looking 
for different places to live so that's one of  
the reasons we're actually back in the Philippines 
not just for the gorgeous land we've actually been  
trying to do some like slower travel and staying 
for in one place for a month or a month at a time  
at least didn't really we're kind of failing at 
that it's because there's so many places we want  
to go see so staying in one place for a full month 
just seen just we wouldn't get to see it what did  
I like to do but in the future what I like about 
Cebu so far is we know that to get to beaches it  
seems to be only an hour or two hour drive to 
different places and I think in Manila I don't  
know if that's the case correct us if we're wrong 
so it's just interesting to compare the two cities  
if we were coming longer than say one month if we 
want to come back again on our next trip for maybe  
three months where would we set up shop in the 
Philippines question for you you guys all right  
we're just coming by a little kind of a markety 
pop-up shop place here at a bus station yeah  
there's a really big bus station here I'm guessing 
there's a lot of people that like work in this  
area and then probably live in different areas 
but they can pop by get a little treat and then  
hop on the bus before they head home for the day 
speaking of like living in the cities obviously  
a lot of people in the Philippines live in the 
cities but a lot of people that don't think about  
the Philippines in terms of like the nature and 
how beautiful the beaches are and like waterfalls  
that's kind of what comes to mind probably when 
you think about the Philippines but the cities  
themselves are really really interesting we loved 
Manila as well I think when you come to the city  
if you find the right area you're really gonna 
like it so what we're trying to say is don't  
skip the big cities at least give them like a day 
or two because I think you're going to find it a  
great combination between the beautiful nature 
of the Philippines and this modern modern city  
we're really liking it we are and I think it's 
also good like you were saying spend a day or  
two you'll probably want to anyway because it is 
it seems like every place that you want to go to  
from Cebu City is like a good three hours in each 
Direction so you might want to take a break and  
here's here's a fun little fact when we got here 
we liked it so much we actually extended our stay  
and I don't think a lot of people say that about 
Cebu City by that extended our standing right here  
in the city because we're having a lot of fun plus 
we wanted to stock up on some items like clothing  
and well tech gear yeah the pace of development in 
this city must be just out of this world we really  
want you guys to kind of chime in and let us know 
like how old is this area it feels to to us pretty  
pretty new but right now we're looking for like 
a place to get a drink or like a beer garden and  
uh I think we might have found it scratch that we 
took a complete Wrong Turn that's not where we're  
going so now we're going to try to find a place 
for a different place I should say all right we  
came over to a place called Park social and this 
is the place we walked by earlier we got a beer  
to drink a San Miguel light because we'll really 
really liking these what's funny is this place uh  
the part social I think is the is kind of like the 
sister restaurant to the social which is what we  
we were at in the last video we didn't know that 
the waitress just just told us but speaking of  
what she just told us we asked her like what does 
IT Park stand for like that's the neighborhood  
we're in this is this new development we also 
asked her like how old is it because it feels kind  
of new and she said it's fair it is fairly new and 
within the last I think 10 years or so just about  
maybe five to ten years so that makes sense 
because it's super modern and the reason it's  
called it Park is it is to do with tech technology 
I guess there's a lot of call centers around here  
but what I found the most fascinating is what what 
used to be here so we're walking around I'm like  
how did they get this enormous plot of land in 
the city and turns out this is the former airport  
like the Cebu airport used to be here so that 
makes way more sense obviously there would have  
been all this empty space they moved the airport 
further out inside the city so here we are having  
a beer and where the old airport used to be in 
a very very modern part of Cebu cheers to my  
second San Miguel light we have one in the video 
I think our last video I think Trevor just said  
but I think this will be the second of many that 
we'll have over the course of a month I love San  
Miguel light it's probably one of my favorite like 
domestic type beers it's just like nice and light  
good with the lime in it could go to and I've 
missed it for sure anyway let's talk a little  
bit about one thing that has not changed in the 
Philippines and that is just how nice Filipino  
people are oh my goodness I'm sure lots of people 
that have met Filipinos around the world know that  
they're really friendly and happy and just like 
the nicest people but when you get here you're a  
little bit like almost overwhelmed with how nice 
people are in a good way of course like our server  
just came over and talked to us for probably a 
good 10 minutes that she was interested in what  
our channel is there's another kind of funny thing 
about the Philippines is that a lot of people  
watch YouTube here so a lot of people inevitably 
know what you're doing when they see the camera  
and they'll come over and they'll ask me about the 
channel it's a good thing and a bad thing because  
in other countries people just look at you like 
you're completely in nuts they have no idea what  
you're doing here in the Philippines everybody 
knows like you're a vlogger and you're making  
a video so if you're watching this and you're like 
when are you going to the beautiful beaches in the  
Philippines it's happening in the next video 
we're leaving Cebu like basically tomorrow  
and we're going to somewhere beautiful we're going 
to pray to the weather God so we're going to get  
the weather that we're after and we honestly 
cannot wait here do you want to tell them what  
islands we're going to should we tell them or 
should we make them wait now we're going to tell  
you guys so a lot of you would not have heard 
of where we are going but I think if there's  
any Filipinos watching which hopefully there 
are you guys will probably know we're going to  
bentanian Island I got to get the pronunciation 
right bantayan Island it's at the very north of  
Cebu it's a pretty big island here I think it's 
about what a two and a half hour drive a half  
hour drive and then like an hour or so ferry 
to get there it's gonna be a big travel day  
but we'll pick you up when we get there hopefully 
on a beautiful beach yeah the beaches look really  
really dreamy and we can't wait so it's going to 
be very different than these last two videos huge  
contrast going from a big city to a very sleepy 
little beach Village and I hope some people will  
be excited that we're going to probably an island 
that you might not have heard of before yeah I  
don't think it's one of the more popular touristic 
Islands so we can't wait that's what we came back  
here for and it's about to happen again and it's 
gonna be so exciting so if you guys got this far
