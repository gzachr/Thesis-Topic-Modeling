Now let’s try the dila, which is the beef tongue
Again, drown it in vinegar
Put it on top of my porridge
Some more vinegar
Cheers!
3 years
It’s probabbly the longest time I’ve been away from home
And for my comeback, I thought of bringing you to my home province in Bulacan
And what better way to start than to highlight the capital city of Malolos
Malolos Bulucan takes pride in its rich historical and cultural heritage as the birthplace of the first institutional democracy in Asia
It’s also famous for its cuisine and traditional delicacies
We went on a short day trip but I know we barely scratched the surface
So in this three part series
I’m excited to share with you all the delicious kakanins for a well known institution
So here we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 kinds of kakanins
So let’s try
Mmm!
Really good!
Classic Filipino Chinese dishes from a local panciteria
And then this one is the Lee Foo Chicken, their speciality
Drenched in some kind of red sauce
This one is the leg part
Drenched in some kind of red sauce
This one is the leg part
Including unique snacks you will only find here
Now let’s try the Empanada de Kaliskis
Look how flaky it is
It actually reminds me of the Curry puff that you can get in Singapore
Because it comes in many layers
Then let’s see
Let’s break it in half
Woah! Look at that
Mmm...
And today we’re starting off with one of the established lugawan in the city, Lugaw ni Abel
They started in 1989 serving plain lugaw and became popular when they added cow’s brain and eyes to their menu
Well that sounds like a good way to warm our tummies up for this Malolos food trip
We have just arrived her at Lugaw ni Abel
Bright and early, it’s 8 am in the morning here in Malolos Bulacan
We’re starting the exploration
Food exploration here with porridge
So let’s go try Lugaw ni Abel
Alright, so we’ve ordered up our lugaw and side dishes
We have here the laman, which is like the meat
I believe this is like beef meat
And this is dila which is like beef tongue
This is goto which is like beef tripe
And I’ve already drowned them individually in vinegar
They have a spiced vinegar here with some chilies
I believe there’s some garlic and some other spices
Of course everything goes with this plain lugaw
Which is porridge cooked with..
I believe the beef part
This is what Lugaw ni Abel is known for here in Malolos Bulacan
So this one is topped with fried garlic
So let’s try the lugaw as is
Mmm…
Really comforting
I mean I woke up early morning
I’m not really feeling completely well
To start it with porridge, it’s just very comforting
A little bit savory and sweet from the garlic
Now let’s try it with the laman, put some vinegar on top of it
Put it onto my porridge, add some more vinegar
Just the way I like it
Let’s try it
Mmm…
This is like plainly boiled beef meat
And I love the vinegar it’s a little bit spicy actually
So it contrasts the savoriness of the lugaw
Now let’s try the dila
Again, drown it in vinegar
Put it on top of my porridge
Some more vinegar
Cheers!
It’s very tender
I’m not sure if most people in a lot of countries eat tongue but it’s one of my favorites
Because if you cook it right, if you make it really soft
It’s really delicious and it just taste like beef meat
This is really soft
I imagine they have cooked this and boiled this for so long
Mmm…
Next is the beef tripe
This is one of my favorites as well because of its chewy texture
Let’s try
Mmm…
Oh yeah
Chewy at the same time soft
And that’s the perfect texture you want from the tripe
It means it’s been boiled for so long
Again, that’s what they’re doing right here
The porridge is just on the oilier side but if you like it like that then it’s for you
I like it a little bit less oily because my throat is not feeling well this morning
That’s why, you know, we’re starting with porridge
But overall it’s cheaper and I believe Lugaw ni Abel is an institution
It’s been established here in Malolos since 1989
People from the neighborhood, all the locals here come for the comfort food lugaw to start their day or for lunch or dinner
Quite a heavy meal to share with the family and to fill up your tummy with warmth
Overall I’d givet this 6/10 for a neighborhood find
Not the best porridge that I’ve tried but from here in Malolos it’s a good start, Lugaw ni Abel
If you want to try, you can come here
I’ll put the link in the description box below with an address
On the next video we’ll keep on trying cuisines or different local delicacies here in Malolos
So I’ll see you in Malolos Bulacan!
Bye!
