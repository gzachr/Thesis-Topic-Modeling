Marcelito Pomoy and the song that I'm

...anyway...
Oh my goodness!
Wow control to
Wow, I would like to know how old he is.
Only because of ...the range
listen that song was 
emotional and as he started singing, in the beginning, It made me tear up but then
what he's doing with his voice
it just the tears went away then I had
to start focusing on was this voice
really coming out of his mouth I had to
really look at him and look at his lips
and his chest and I have to see him
perform again I have to see him perform
again I would really really love to see
him perform live Wow
that's talent that is talent now I've
seen other singers do that sort of you
know that same range but that's not
something you come across very that's
not something you come across every day
that was amazing tell me what you guys
think about that performance

him while you're watching this video
back look at his lips and his chest and
right he's singing he's absolutely
singing and that is amazing and I love
the fact that he he not only has that
wide range but he is singing in two
different languages and that is amazing
