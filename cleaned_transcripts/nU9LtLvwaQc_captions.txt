- My boyfriend lives in the US.
And so you're from the Philippines.
OK, so what I'm taking from this is
you're from the Philippines,
you're a contractual worker,
what are the odds of you
getting a tourist visa.
That seems like the long and short of it.
Honestly, I gotta say that
they're not good, unfortunately.
I wish it was different.
I myself have family in the Philippines
and we're good at this and
we do this all the time
and some of my family members I've not
been able to get a tourist visa.
And they have regular jobs and everything.
So it's not good.
If you're single, if
you're a single person,
that's a strike against you.
For getting a tourist visa
out of the Philippines.
And again this doesn't
apply to every country.
But it will a little bit.
In general, for many countries,
they're looking for the same thing.
They want to know
what are the odds you're
gonna leave the United States
at the end of your tourist visa timeline.
So, with the Philippines,
the odds are, in their
opinion, and I guess in fact,
not good that you will leave.
So it works against
you that you're single,
and then, believe it or not,
it works against you
that you have a fiance
in the United States
because that's yet another
temptation for you to stay.
What they really want to see is
married, middle-aged, business owner
with all kinda ties to the community
who knows nobody in the United States
and wants to come take some
pictures of the Grand Canyon
and go back to the Philippines.
That's the guy who gets approved.
Young people, very
difficult to get approved.
Single people, very
difficult to get approved.
People who don't own
some kind of substantial
business or real estate
in the Philippines,
difficult to get approved.
So you know it's $165 to apply.
And we can help you with that.
Our fee is $100, so if you
want to spend 265 bucks
to find out, it doesn't
hurt your later case
to do a fiance visa.
That's another common question.
"If I get denied a tourist visa,
is that gonna hurt me later
for a fiance or spousal visa?"
Absolutely not.
As long as you're honest, you
don't get denied for fraud.
If you're completely honest,
you do a tourist visa,
you get denied, we've had a
lot of customers come to us
after getting denied and
they sail right through
on a fiance visa.
So if you want to spend
the money and try it,
you got nothing to lose except that money
and your time of going to the interview
in Manila and everything.
But I wouldn't get your hopes up
based on the situation as you laid it out,
you're probably not gonna be approved.
I hate to say that but I don't
want to see you waste money either,
even if you're spending
some of that money with us.
We really don't want
you to waste your money.
If you want to try it, and you're willing
to spend that money to take a chance
to surprise your fiance, hey go for it.
But you gotta know going in
that your odds are not good.
