hi guys! when I was in sixth grade quite
decades ago I had this wonderful
opportunity to go on a cultural trip and
what stuck to mind during the trip was a
carabao ride, a cultural dance and a
lunch by a waterfall with your feet
immersed in water. I said to myself one
of these days I will return and so I did
here at Villa Escudero.
This time though it feels much more
special because I brought my family
along with me to enjoy what's in store
for us.
Follow the path to the carabao.
Everyone was excited to take the carabao
ride but I knew they'll be more
impressed by the buffet lunch by the
waterfall.
It is a buffet style lunch but there are
staff that will assist you for example
getting some more fruits or getting some
drinks they're always there to help.
And food is delicious!
What I also like about Villa Escudero is
that it also provides some of the
comforts of the city such as swimming
pool, playgrounds and other water
activities such as bamboo rafting as
well as golf and there are also random
patches of land that you can probably
have a picnic in.
And another highlight especially if you
have foreigners with you it's the
cultural show at the end of the day.
Pandanggo sa ilaw.
Originate in the islands where families are fishermen who'd guide their menfolk back home with candle in shores.
