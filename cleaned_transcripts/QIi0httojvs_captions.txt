UK versus Australia
Today we have a very special guest all the way from Australia. 
 So, please introduce yourself then.
Hi my name is Irene 
I'm a registered nurse working in the operating theatre
first ah of course from the Philippines 
and then from the UK and now in Australia
So how's the experience working in 
the UK?
I found it very educational because obviously coming from a third world country
 like the Philippines we didn't have that much  
access to equipment back home and you 
know learning in the UK it was like a whole  
new world for a registered nurse because 
you had a lot more um a lot more things  
to learn and a lot more processes but it's 
somehow made life a bit easier and the  
treatment that they have for their nurses is a 
whole lot better as well
why did you leave the UK was it the original plan were you planning 
something else were you looking for something else?
We left the Philippines I was 26 and around 2014 it was um moving close 
to 30 and we said by 30 onwards we'd like to  
be in the place where we could see ourselves 
retiring and somehow UK did not hit the mark  
I think mainly because it was of the weather 
it was the cold was surprising but it was  
more of the gray that I guess affected me you 
know I don't mind a bit of cold as long as you  
get a lot of sun because I'm a very sunny person
cause I'm from the Philippines and all  
The debate back then was either moving to Australia
versus getting British citizenship and a lot 
of people they didn't want to risk  
that citizenship because obviously it's a it's 
a security but once you get the  
citizenship then at least you got you can go anywhere 
because you've got fall back but I braved to  
go to and still Australia instead because the 
longer I stay then the less I see  
myself moving so it's a it's a decision of like if 
I don't do it now then I don't do it ever
the cost of life is well I think cuz we were 
in London before we moved so we didn't think  
it possible to you know own properties in such a   
a short time whereas I wanted to get something 
before I was 35
how do you compare the cost of living between two countries
are there any pros on both sides and cons on both sides?
the stuff are actually more or less the same cost of living I would say 
is the same
 London was an expensive place to live in but Canberra is not cheap either because 
I'm in Canberra at the moment and Canberra is the  
capital city of Australia living cost wise I would 
say the the cities both cities don't differ very  
much the salary that you were given and offered 
from both cities actually played a big difference  
because the offer in Australia was a bit higher
it's basically the salary gives you a bit more flexibility
UK would um beat out anyone else because 
there were a lot of there were a lot of  
things that were free for the British 
citizen so you have the NHS was completely  
free in Australia it works on a half-half 
basis so the Australia has it's um has its  
public sector which works the same as the NHS 
but then you are also encouraged to have your  
own private health insurance. People chose to just rely 
completely on the public system
every tax refund time come June July every year 
they would have to pay a Levy or a fee
if do not have private health insurance 
and that and there's a certain amount that  
caps that goes on top of it for every year 
above 31 that you do not have private health
with regards to nursing practice what is the best 
part from both countries how do they compare would you say?  
with me its the same practice wise if anything 
Australians are a lot more laid-back I would say  
so uh oh the practice is the same and they do 
the best they can at work but they also know you  
know if it's not very busy or you can have a bit of 
downtime they do know how to chill stuff like that  
and you know they try to make things fun at the work place.
I see and how about Filipinos in the workplace and in the community
would you say there's a big group of
Filipino community at least where you live or where you work?
yeah actually I was we were actually surprised because 
we thought all the Filipinos would flock to
it's very normal to see them you know in big groups and the
likes of Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, and Perth. you know the big four
but we didn't think we would know anyone
in or we would actually meet anyone in Canberra
and when we came we thought there'd be like a select
handful but when we came and we actually got around
we found out there's quite a lot of them living in Canberra as well
the thing I first saw about Australia and I think I still love
about Australia actually is how its a
half and half of the Philippines and the UK 
because obviously everyone knows the  
Philippines and then when you get around because 
I live in Las Piñas and then I worked in Manila 
and then you know you get around to party in
Makati stuff like that so you have the big high-rises and stuff
when you went to the UK it was all full
architecture and colonial and formal and royal
and then when we went to Australia it was back to the high-rises 
and CBD so it was like BGC all over again 
but in certain areas you still get those old architecture 
that won't make you home sick of the UK too much  
and then obviously the culture is majorly 
British because it's a it's a British colony or  
we're still under who knows the better the common 
law anyway so so they're yeah the balance good
coming from somebody who worked in both countries
looking to move in Australia that's that's a very good
I would say I'm biased it was it wasn't no regrets decision for me
but obviously the situation could be different for you 
both countries are great and both has  
both countries have their own pros and 
cons but if anything it's a very cliche but  
it's follow where your heart is because I my 
husband still loves London he likes Australia  
but he still loves London and I would say 
travel is a lot more expensive here  
than it is back in the UK so um follow where your 
heart is and wherever that place is that  
you could see yourself really settling and you 
know getting in with the community and that's a  
place where you're looking at yourself being 
for the next 50 years or so then go for it
always remember, Manong knows.
