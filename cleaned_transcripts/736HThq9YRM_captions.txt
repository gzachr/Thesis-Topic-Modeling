it's again another cold day here in 
the netherlands and i will try to make  
lumpiang shanghai filipino lumpiang 
shanghai and give it to my sister
oh yeah thank you so first let's 
have a look at the ingredients  
so i'm using ground pork meat or giniling 
giniing diba some fresh parsley at carrots  
of course pimenta asin  
and finally mantika so i washed the vegetables 
so now i'm gonna chop everything very fine
and look who's there
so
okay so finally i'm gonna add some asin and black 
pepper and oil and then we're gonna halo halo
so
so while the meat is getting marinated 
and while the rice is cooking  
i'm gonna buy some lumpia wrappers
now i got the lumpia wrappers i hope they are  
the good size for lump young 
shanghai so i have a question  
i want to make a dipping sauce if i have enough 
thyme otherwise i'll just use chili sauce but  
how do you call the dipping sauce for lump young 
shanghai is it just sausage i saw that you can mix  
ketchup with vinegar and some cornstarch and a 
bit of sugar and salt to make a sauce for the  
lump young shanghai so if i still have time i'm 
gonna do that but please leave your comments below  
on how to make the best sauce 
dipping sauce for lump young shanghai  
okay so for this salad i'm just gonna try a 
bit of vinegar too hot so just add the ketchup  
if i would have banana ketchup i would add 
that one but i don't so let's say 50 50.
and then i was just thicken 
it with some cornstarch
it seems Pogi is hungry too gutom na pogi gutom
okay so i'm gonna try the lumpias
so i think this one is very tiny it's too 
tiny i'll try to roll a little bit bigger okay
okay let's hope that this one 
will be a little bit bigger
like this
like that no look oh
okay so i think i found the trick i need 
to spread the lead a little bit more  
wide lengthwise okay so i think this 
one looks pretty good what do you think  
you know i wanted to fry the lumpia shanghai 
here but uh when i bring them maybe when they  
cool off they're not so nice anymore so instead 
i'm just gonna fry them at my sister's place  
okay so i'm on my way let's see how 
the lump young shanghai will turn out
okay so here we are and we're gonna 
fry the lumpias i'm curious because  
they got a little bit flat in the car but uh 
should be all right so the oil is getting hot  
okay i will start with the mini because 
uh that was the one that i started with  
oh it was not so hot yet so this is just a 
test version it's called lump young shanghai  
but it's actually from the philippines oh 
so i don't know why the name but it's a  
filipino lumpia okay so let's have a look at 
the mini lumpia the oil was not hot enough so  
but now it's really hot i think it needs a little 
bit more time and then we're done okay let's go
let's try three or four at a time yeah 
now it's much better the temperature
yes warm rice  
okay so we have the warm rice the sasawan or 
dipping sauce and let's take out the lumpia
that sound in the background is my coffee 
okay i'm gonna put them on a paper first
because they are really hot  
i'm really curious i did not taste it myself yet 
so my sister is gonna try the lumpiang shanghai  
from the philippines it's still a bit hot but i'm 
very curious yeah careful a little bit of sauce
it sounds very crispy
how is it that's very good 
okay what do you say mess it up
so i'm now having my dutch coffee where did dutch 
apple buy with a freshly baked apple pie Dutch  
it looks very good my sister baked this apple pie  
so i hope you like this episode and i'll 
see you next time with more filipino food
