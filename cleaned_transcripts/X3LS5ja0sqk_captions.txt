Hello, I'm pipe and welcome back to this new video, I invite you to activate the English subtitles
and for this occasion I present to you rabiya mateo she is the representative of the philippines in the upcoming edition of miss universe
She is in charge of looking for the 5th crown for her country 
after those won in 1969, 1973, 2015 and for the last one in 2018,
She also has the extraordinary work of leading the Philippines to the top finish after 10 consecutive years.
But let's talk about rabiya
She came to the contest being a beautiful contestant but over the days we managed to see that great evolution she had and her enormous willingness to excel in competition 
and position herself as one of the favorites and today the winner.
She is 23 years old, measures 1.70 cm, has a degree in physiotherapy and with the intention of giving back her education works as a teacher,
Something that I have noticed and I consider quite important is how born in her is the voluntary altruism, love for social works and the power that her voice has when wanting to help,
In a clear example of personal improvement, we learned about her story in her private interview 
and this is one of her reasons why she works for education since she considers it a golden ticket to success.
As for her physique, she keeps her body in shape and we managed to see it very stylized thanks to its proportions,
 her attractiveness is undeniable and one of the points that most exalts her is the great facial beauty that she has, this gives her an amazing record in photography ,
Her charisma, strong presence on stage highlight that she is a candidate who proposes and this makes her stand out in a group together with her personality, 
queen aura, in addition, a potential candidate heading to miss universe.
do you think rabiya mateo is the next miss universe?
