oh my gosh
whoa
right behind you
right
behind you
morning
it's 5:00 a.m.
it's day three
we are in cebu
we are in our rental car
which is there
and we are heading to we're heading to....
we are heading to oslob to do some....
whale watching
oh my god
alright
my brain is
we were up here at
4:30 this morning
ahhhh!
no coffee
my brain is still fuzzy
we're gonna put this away
and we are
going to hit the road
so we will see you
maybe on the road
maybe in oslob
see you then
so it's about a hundred and twenty seven
kilometers
and the GPS did say it would take us about three and a half hours to
get there
but it took us closer to
like four and a half hours maybe five
but we were taking our time
and we were so glad that we went to the car
because
it really gave us the opportunity to
just explore and just stop if we saw
something interesting
so I don't know
what that was
it was ten pesos
I asked him
if it was coffee
he said no
I saw him pour some condensed milk on the top
looked like he was scooping up some
solidified white stuff almost
like yogurt but with the consistency had
more  like a custard consistency
we
think it is soy
could have been soy, again i asked him
if it was coffee
it wasn't
it's warm
It's sweet
not yogurt
might be
could be soy
just predominantly sweet
definitely not coffee
it's good though
we don't know what we are drinking!
We couldn't findthe stand for the
GoPro
looks like i'm hand holding it again
but we are here, we are going to be seeing the
Whale sharks
we're excited
I'm really hot
like super hot
it's really hot
but the breeze is good and I'm sure the
ocean will be cool
enjoy it
thank you
salamat po!
Wow
that was great we got to see the whale
sharks
and they came really close
actually it was pretty awesome
we loved it
okay so we got back to the
car and wouldn't start
