[Music]
well hello everybody and welcome back to my 
channel my name is katrinka I'm a professional  
singer and a voice coach welcome back it's been 
some time I'm very sorry that I have not been as  
active as I should have been the previous week but 
I had my voice rest my voice has been suffering  
quite a lot lately it was mainly because I am a 
full-time streamer I scream 4 times per week and  
now I also record 2 to 3 videos for YouTube 
per week so the pressure on my voice kind of  
multiplied I didn't count on it but yeah now this 
week I had a proper voice rest I will be making a  
tiny music project here on my channel and I will 
need your help I will be asking my Instagram  
for help so if you haven't yet go follow me on 
Instagram and the wait patiently I'll give you all  
information needed very soon today's video is long 
awaited very much requested and it's gonna be more  
resets this wonderful lady is gonna be part of 
the ladies week which was started by Tatyana from  
Jinja I'm gonna leave the link to the video right 
here I didn't realize that ring light can be seen  
in my glasses hold on what what what tell me she 
is not the most adorable ever haha she's so cute
which one owed 7-5 [Music] it 
counts [Music] almost ready [Music]  
such pretty melody very beautiful melody
[Music] Oh
[Applause]
[Music] okay all right well call me psychic 
guys because I don't know why when I first  
looked at her I kind of imagined exactly this 
kind of voice this kind of color this kind of  
like tiny teeny weeny tiny rasp in her voice 
like this is exactly how I imagined her voice  
to be she's given me vibes of big ladies of 
lyrical romantic singing like Mariah Carey  
selling Dionne she knows exactly what she's doing 
with her voice the cry that she had in her voice  
um it sounds like a little bit of a crack for 
someone who doesn't know what it is it's called  
a cry and this cry was absolutely completely 
intentional so it didn't came on its own it  
was intentional she used it because she wanted 
to use it and it really suited there very well
[Music] keyd Baloo
yeah [Music] Oh
[Music]
love
Thank You Colonel of
such a beautiful melody [Music] canalize
ha
[Music]
come again I saw the change in her by the language 
like her whole body got prepared for something and  
I was I originally thought that she there's okay 
the here it goes here guilt she's gonna hit some  
insanely high note but I did not expect this I 
did not expect whistle not at this heights not  
this unexpectedly this was super unexpected it was 
very clean it was very nice the whistle itself was  
super thin there was a lot of finesse in that 
whistle it was really really really beautiful  
whistles on their own are pretty tough for a 
lot of singers not just because of your physical  
limitations but many many many times whistles can 
be difficult because of your a mental block any  
singers can develop mental block to do certain 
techniques or just reach certain notes [Music]
honey
[Music]
[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]
[Applause]
talking about the mental blocks the singers 
can have there are a lot of techniques and  
a lot of work that can go into it to ease the 
mental block a little bit or even get over it's  
completely cheese for example one of the thinkers 
did he used air Hansel up like when she was going  
to run up she used her hand she literally made 
a visible gesture and that can help incredibly  
and is one of the methods that are commonly 
used [Music] wish closes I wish 175 [Music]
she's killing me with that whistle oh my god can 
I have it once again that's fine [Music] first and  
foremost fantastic singer and if she is gonna walk 
this path mariah baby this girl is coming for you  
other than a very good breath control and overall 
beautiful color you can tell that she is fully  
there she is hundred percent focused on what she's 
doing she knows where to do a cry so it's gonna  
sound really well she knows where to do whistle 
where to start preparing for the whistle because  
you've got to prepare for it it it's oh it's just 
so well thought through - Creed is really really  
really wonderful experience so yeah she is 1996 
therefore she's 23 now and I cannot wait what  
her future holds I think that we're gonna see 
something really beautiful growing up from this  
girl I'm pretty freaking happy - I saw her now and 
I'm definitely gonna be paying close attention to  
how her career is gonna devil up and yeah very 
pleasant very very pleasant listening and think
