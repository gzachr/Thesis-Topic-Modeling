Sakura (cherry blossom) is finally here.
It means winter has ended and spring is coming.
Japanese people loves hanami (cherry blossom viewing).
Cherry blossoms only lasts for a very short period of time
which makes it a visual representation of how beautiful and how short life is.
It is Japan's national flower and hanami (cherry blossom viewing) is a part of their deep cultural tradition.
We're lucky to witness it this year before the government
closes the cherry blossom spots due to coronavirus.
2 heaped tsp matcha milk powder, 1/2 tsp sugar, 1/4 cup heavy cream.
My favorite drink recently.
Such a very pretty Japanese sakura sweets. ‚ô•Ô∏è
I decided to paint cherry blossom today.
It's been a while since I last painted.
I love how the cherry blossom reminded
me of how life can be so beautiful but tragically short.
In this chaotic time, cherry blossom
serves as a reminder to laugh and love while you can.
Forgive and apologize when you should,
and let go of the things that you cannot control.
I will make sakura crepe cake to celebrate cherry blossom season at home.
3 eggs, 2 cups milk, 3 Tbs melted butter
1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour, 6 Tbs sakura latte powder
1/2 tsp red food coloring powder
Rest the batter for 1 hour in the fridge.
2 cups whipping cream, 1/4 cup sugar
Time to layer the crepe cake.
Crepe cake is done. üëåüèº
Refrigerate for at least 2 hours before serving.
I hope you like this video. See you in the next one.
