Alright, lads.
 This was after the video where I was messing around and joking about the wind.
Here, I started going bonkers. The wind was strong enough to push and pull the door. The door is heavy.
Like, glass and not the hollow plastic, or the cheap kind, like... It is heavy-duty plastic.
But the wind was able to move it around! And you know those doors that have auto close features?
So like, It is trying to hold it still, but to no avail. In addition to that, it made this ominous noise...
Here, I started telling myself. Alright, the typhoon is not a joke.
 The difference between the BGM is because of the laptop. I just hope there is no copyright...
Honestly, lads, I will keep going until the typhoon reaches the centre of our village.
Because it is like a circle, and it keeps taking turns like a Beyblade or something.
More importantly, It will be 15:00 soon, but right now it is 13:00
15:00 because it will arrive in Surigao and become the main target, the centre of its attraction! And it will be Signal 3? I think.
