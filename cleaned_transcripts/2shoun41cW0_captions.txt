Hey guys, today we're gonna show you how to make champorado with Nutella. Champorado is a Filipino chocolate rice porridge, that's occasionally eaten for breakfast.
To make Champorado, start with adding half a cup of sweet rice into a pot.
Followed by two cups of water.
Cook the rice over medium low to medium heat for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the rice is soft.
Make sure it occasionally stir it to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom of the pot.
When it's done, the water should have thickened and become starchier, but shouldn't have fully evaporated.
Now add in one and a half tablespoons of cocoa powder.
And mix it in with the sweet rice.
Next add in three generous tablespoons of Nutella.
And continue to stir. And
finally pour in one and a half teaspoons of sugar. And
stir it in. If
your Champorado ends up being too thick, you can add evaporated milk until it reaches the consistency you want.
Once it's done serve it up in a small bowl.
Champorado can be served with dried salted fish, like anchovies,
but if you're not feeling too adventurous or not a fan of pairing fish and chocolate, you can also add a pinch of salt.
Or you can skip the salt all together and just drizzle it with sweetened condensed milk.
It's talagang tasty!
What's up guys!
