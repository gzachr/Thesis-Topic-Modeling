(THE PLAY)
(Play means to play/have fun/play games)
(The Play: Time for The BOYZ to play,
eat and have fun however they want)
Where are we now...
THE BOYZ, go!
Haknyeon and boys
Please come here. Please gather here
Gather here, please
Our team, our team, Team Jacob
We're excited now
Because we came to an amusement park
That's right
The four of us are in a team
Wow, you even take a picture for us
It's Haknyeon and boys
Yes, Sunwoo and older boys
Haknyeon and boys
Jacob and younger boys
We'll show you. Look
Ta-da!
We're going to ride the Ferris wheel
Bye
We're going to ride it first
then ride other ones too
Right
Jacob and Haknyeon are running
because they're excited
Yeah! Roller-coaster
Woohoo!
Sunwoo, Sunwoo! Catch Sunwoo!
(Sunwoo, got it!)
Are we going? Are we going?
It's going up so high! Yikes!
Sunwoo's a coward
We're on a double date
Double date, double date
We should turn on some music
No, not here
Oh, should we ride that?
Should we ride that one? That one
Viking ship ride?
No, that one
Oh my god! That one
(I want to ride it, too! High five!)
Is that like the Everland twist ride?
What is that?
That one is so fun!
I really like that ride
Please take a picture of that
Oh! Something just fell out
Ha ha!
Wow, that looks fun
Round and round, drop, drop
Let's tell scary stories
- Okay
- Oh, it's so cold by the way
There is something called
Final Destination...
I know
The scene is exactly this
Yes
I don't want to spoil the movie but
You didn't see? Final Destination?
People...
It's so good
Die really cruelly in that movie
And there is this exact scene
Suddenly, bam!
For an unbelievable reason
The machine stops and
it flips over suddenly
People in the movie hold on
to the Ferris by one hand
And say "please save me".
It's that kind of movie
Wow, it's my first time on the Ferris wheel
I've only been on a child-friendly
version long ago. A small one
I can imagine it now
Beyond imagining
But because we came up
here, we can see that ride
Right, what's around
When we get off, let's
go ride that immediately
Oh, that sounds good
What time do we have until?
I have to do this one
(Looking around)
Oh, that zombie!
Hey, you like the scary ones
Why do you say Zombie?
Anyways, here we go!
I don't like zombies
We're here
It's so fun
Oh, hello
They're welcoming us
Let's stand up
Really?
Why?
So we can go quickly
How was it compared to what you expected?
It wasn't as scary as I thought
Aren't you going to open our door?
Oh
The Ferris wheel takes 10 minutes?
Or longer?
I thought it was less than 10 minutes
Thank you
Thank you. Come out quickly
Thank you
The other team is here, too
They're here
Oh, I think Hwall will
look cool when he gets off
Yay!
Ha ha!
It's scary, right?
It was really scary
I was so scared
You were scared?
It was shaking and wasn't even funny
Wasn't Juyeon screaming?
Let's go, let's go!
(Building another memory like this)
Bye
Bye
(He he)
The final team is here
Oh, we're here
Wasn't it scary?
It's scary, right?
Let's confirm from the video later
Let's confirm from the video
We're going to ride the Viking ship
Yeah!
Jacob, you stepped on my foot
(I'm going to get there fast)
Where are you going?
Who wants to sit in the last row with me?
Me!
How about we divide into
two groups to ride it?
In the very back?
Of course
The last row
Six on each side
But I don't know if we can do it
The last row is the best
for the Viking ship ride
The last row is the best for the
Viking ship ride. Don't you think?
What?
The Viking ship
Of course
Didn't you know?
Didn't I know what?
'You didn't know that my heart wants you'
'Hurry and come to me'
'Hurry, la la, hurry, la la'
Ha ha
The Viking ship
Well now
Yo! We have no fear
So we can walk on water
Viking, you're my king
Lion King
Yes!
Exercise! Breath
Let's get it! Let's get it
Let's Giddy Up!
(I'm so nervous)
Hey, just get in
Yeah!
The cameras are all here
Hey, the back row! Six people
Six people? Seven people
Oh, yes, yes
Wow, the Ferris wheel looks
so pretty over there
Okay, everyone
We're here to ride the Viking ship
Oh, we can see the Ferris wheel we rode
Okay, okay
Hyunjae
Hyunjae is scared
(Hyunjae's a little scared)
Then sit in the middle
Hyunjae, you can sit in the middle alone
Hyunjae, sit on the other side facing us
(Shaking)
Ask them in English to finish it quickly
We want to ride for a long time
Hey, hey, hey
Long time
(Horrified) No, no, no
Short time, no
Long time, no
Very high, very high, very high
Very high
Let's go, let's go
(Viking ship ride is starting)
Go, go go!
Okay, we're going!
(We'll hear "Get it" by
excited Sangyeon and Eric)
No, no, no
Three minutes, please
No
No, it's Giddy Up, Giddy Up
(Let's hear 'Get It' by happy Sangyeon and Eric)
Hold on tight
I can feel it coming
Hey, it's Giddy Up time
Are you ready to sing Giddy Up?
Yep! Woohoo!
Woohoo!
Hey, let's all do it louder
Wow!
(I'm Hyunjae... and I have no thoughts.
Because I have no thoughts...)
(The Viking ride is so fun)
(Please end quickly)
Five minutes (I think
it's been five minutes)
He's scared
What? What's up with Younghoon?
I think Younghoon's scared
I'll protect you
Wow
Ha ha
That's the best you can do for now
Wow
(So cute)
Raise your hands
Higher, higher!
Higher, let's go higher!
Higher, higher!
(I'm in the state of Nirvana)
Going, going, going, wow!
(If you're excited, singing
Giddy Up is perfect)
Giddy giddy up, let's go
to the tip of the sky
Go, run, run, run
(I have no thoughts)
Hey, it's coming, it's coming
Is it coming? Is it coming?
Yes, it's coming. Woohoo!
Wow!
Bam!
(The characteristic of somehow
who talks well on the ride)
(He's pretending to enjoy it,
but actually scared)
What? It's not that high
Argh! Argh!
(I'm Hyunjae and I have no thoughts)
(Ha ha)
(Again, I have no thoughts)
(Argh, my heart aches)
Higher!!
Yeah!
(Let's just play without thinking today)
Go, go, go, go
It's so fun
(Let's just play without thinking today)
Hey, but it's really not scary at all
(Really? Now, I'm scared)
After doing bungee jumping
Yeah!
(Look at Sangyeon)
Younghoon says he's scared
(It seems like Hyunjae is used to it now)
Yeah!
(The ending bell sound)
(So excited)
THE BOYZ, let's succeed!
Yeah!
(It's our new song time!)
Wow!!!!
Ha ha
Why are you doing it now?
It's all over now
Now he's confident
Hey, Woohoo!
You can't edit this out
The Viking ride was fun
Yes, we're now at our hotel
Jacob and I are suffering
from motion sickness
Argh
We have motion sickness
It's my first time getting motion sickness
I really like the Viking ride
and I often sit in the last row
But the ride was very long
I've learn my lesson you have to
ride it shortly but with an impact
Oh my gosh
Argh, I feel sick
So, what are we going to do?
We're going to sleep
No
We have to wash up
No
Are you going to eat a mango?
Right
Oh, my stomach really hurts
As he says that he brought two
Mango, oh!
Mango, oh!
I'll put the mango in the refrigerator
I'll eat it tomorrow morning
Then I'll eat it tomorrow morning, too
I'm going to eat just mangoes all day
Hmm, then we'll get going now
What? The mango is smaller...
larger than Sunwoo's head
No, do it like this
Oh, it's smaller
Then, we'll be going to sleep now
We'll say good-bye!
Two, three
We're Sunwoo and Jacob
Woohoo, bye-bye!
Please cover the screen
(Jacob listens well)
Good? What's up with that?
(Working hard)
It's good
No, it's not
We'll stop it now. One, two, three, zap!
We were going to sleep, but
I am going to eat a mango
So I'm shooting a mango eating video
It looks like a very big banana
It looks like an enlarged banana
I'll try eating it now
Earlier, the other members said
the mangoes are so delicious
It's my first time eating mangoes like this
I'll try it now
(Chow)
(Yum, yum)
Wow
By the way, is there something
in the middle of it?
Is there something in the middle?
Like a seed?
I thought you can slide it
and eat the whole thing
It's a bit different, but so tasty
Wow
Wow
Oh, wait, this is so tasty
I can see why Sangyeon
kept mentioning mango
I heard Haknyeon also likes mangoes a lot
(Chow)
Oh, delicious!
The way Haknyeon eats...
I just eat it like this
Hmm
But Haknyeon eats it
Slurp, slurp
Like that
Maybe that's Haknyeon's unique sound
(Yum, yum, until the last bite)
Oh
I finished it
Really, bye!
THE B, good night!
Good morning!
I got up a little late
So I came down to eat a little later
I'm going to eat breakfast
Something delicious
I'm a little swollen because it's morning
They all left me
Just because I'm last, how
could they all leave me?
That's so mean
I should hurry and get some breakfast.
What tastes the best?
What tastes the best?
They're all delicious
I'll go get some
Would it snow?
It's the Philippines
Would it snow?
(THE PLAY, that's it for today)
(THE PLAY)
