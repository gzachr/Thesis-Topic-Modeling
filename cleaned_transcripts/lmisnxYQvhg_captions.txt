so i thought this time i'll make a chicken dish
yes today my nephew and his girlfriend 
will try chicken afritada i have made  
the chicken afritada before and i really 
like this dish so i'm very excited to see  
their reaction as you might remember last time i 
made the bicol express for them and they really  
enjoyed bicol express also with a little bit 
of chicharron baboy as usual i start with some  
bawang the exciting thing is that they don't know 
yet what i'm gonna give them today using these  
beautiful white onions today they're really fresh 
i also found these bell peppers they have such  
a nice color yellow and red nowadays these bell 
peppers in the netherlands are very expensive so  
i wonder how much you play in the philippines but 
one piece is around 60 pesos in the netherlands
so it will be really a surprise for them
as you can see i use maraming sibuyas quite 
a lot so i'm gonna set it aside for a while  
so that i have the space for the manok
manok goes in
let's first make them nice and brown
we gotta be creative today because everything 
needs to fit in this pan as you can see i already  
transferred most of the chicken here and now we 
need to add the sibuyas the potatoes the carrots  
and bell peppers as well as 
tomato sauce tomato cubes  
some other things and chicken stock no 
not my coffee so i'll do the carrots first  
like that potatoes are pre-cooked so 
not yet i'll go for the bell peppers
take them out and i'm on
we'll get there i'm struggling a 
little bit today but don't worry  
we'll get there guys promise as usual we're gonna 
do this look there's the chicken and the onions  
pan is pretty full but now i will add the chicken 
stock so that it will go down then tomato sauce
then i'll add the carrots and bell peppers on 
top yeah and i also have this tomato cubes which  
i wanted to add but look at this it's pretty full 
already shall we do it yes or no we still need to  
add the potatoes you know what i think it's syang 
otherwise i need to throw this so i'll just put it  
you know when when we cook this 
the uh the volume will be reduced  
anyway okay so when i cover this then the chicken 
will become smaller manok you need to get smaller  
so i was a little bit hard-headed i had to 
transfer it to two pots in the end so here's  
the chicken afritada tonight i'm gonna add 
the potatoes as well as black pepper a scene  
some spring onions as well as patties then 
the flavors can really develop during the day  
i am very curious to their reaction
hello
i made chicken afritada
did you try before no i'm preparing 
the chicken afritada apparently they  
have never eaten i have two uh pieces of 
chicken manok and then the rice of course  
and also i'm gonna add a little bit of 
the vegetables in the sauce exciting
chicken afritada from the philippines enjoy this 
one has more sauce i think see you can share
so it's a rice with chicken 
potato and then bell peppers
last time you had bicol express 
right you remember the pork  
spicy pork so i thought this 
time i'll make a chicken dish
yeah yeah is it masarap
so ground syrup so brown salad yeah
last time they asked if you are 
filipina many people ask her
is it not too salty okay so this time i 
also have a dessert from the philippines so  
later if you want if you have 
still have some space of course
and this
it's rice sticky rice with coconut and actually 
i did not make this one i got it from a filipino  
restaurant it's called chibog so the the last 
in the last vlog if you didn't see the video yet  
the people can watch where i bought 
this and what city uh that is uh latik  
this uh topping it's called latik what 
is it it's made from coconut cream
the texture is strange or you don't find it
from the philippines
