here in east in slovakia and today
we are going to the most the biggest
castle here in slovakia which is
special rad

good job
so we are going to explore this castle
and after that we are going to eat in
spieski
salash and go to level champa today but
tonight now let's first explore the
castle of the species
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
so apparently this pisce
red is just not the biggest in slovakia
but also the number six biggest castle
in the world and i think with the most
beautiful
view look at this
[Music]
now we are entering
the castle
and this path
will take you to that main gate
this castle is a big ruin but they
started reconstructing it
and
i could imagine they're during the old
time it must have been very beautiful
castle
[Music]
do
[Music]
here you can see everything
that's the courtyard
and if you see some anything from afar
you can easily see
very nice
[Music]
i don't know what happened in the during
17th century here in slovakia but it
feels like
all the castle that i have visited
was got on fire
during that century
and
it broke down to what we see today
[Music]
if i collect all these coins
i'll have free lunch
in this espishki
salash
free
halushki
let's make a wish
and throw this coins
let's be let's be gullible let's be
naive for a moment
throw the coins and make a wish
[Music]
so we are right now on the top of the
tower of the species
species
speech
[Music]
so
[Music]
so
[Music]
so
[Music]
and that is my adventure here in speech
gate castle
the entrance to the castle is around 8
euros and if you want to go to the tower
as well you have to just add an
additional of one euro and
you'll be able to go around the castle
area
if you're
you know in slovakia i really recommend
that you come here it's really worth it
it's beautiful castle and you will learn
a lot and there's an audio guide that
you can download it's in english so it's
super helpful
[Music]
do
[Music]
so what i have
here it's three times i have dreams of
patching with claw basket and piro
filled with brinza
let's try it
is so good
it's starting to pass
through a little bit of plobasca
[Music]
that one is good as well
yum yum
now let's try brings over
[Music]
oh my god it's so good as well

enjoyed it a lot so thank you you guys
who suggested this place to me now we
are heading to la voce
to see this beautiful
[Music]
so we are now in lavocha
just maybe 30 minutes from speech girad
is this old town
and we are going to explore it more
we're going to see a lot of this burgher
burger
burger houses
burger houses there's gonna be this uh
old
um old town hall and the church we'll
try to enter but i don't think so that
will be able to see inside
so
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
saint james basilica was very beautiful
this is actually the second largest
church here in slovakia and you can find
it here in lavocha
um village is in a village
city
lavocha city and inside the
church
is the
[Music]
largest wooden
altar made by master pavel which he
never ever used any
nails
when building the altar and it's
absolutely stunning
[Music]
this is the cage of shame and during all
times when the woman walk alone during
the night which is really prohibited
during those times they could be locked
inside for 24 hours and sometimes people
will speed on them show them something
which is really shameful
[Music]
and that concludes my second day
adventure here in this region and in
this beautiful old town of lavocha i
find it very quiet there's not a lot of
people and this town the city center is
small but if you have a way around and
you're traveling to see spichkey
you can drop by here and enjoy the quiet
scenery of this old village old city
and enjoy the small burger
places
houses as well as you must visit the
saint
james basilica because it's really
really beautiful inside i hope that you
