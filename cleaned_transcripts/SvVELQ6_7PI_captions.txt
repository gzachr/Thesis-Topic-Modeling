oh my god
i'm like ascending right now
it looks like fake food
do you think if we have penises this is
how we'd act
they're probably just flinging around
the outfits today we are going to be
trying
sucks
so excited we're pumped we're nervous
let's do this let's go mabuhay my name
is rizzelle i am a filipino australian
and i'm just going to share some
filipino snacks with my friends here at
buzzfeed some of it has been inspired
from like our spanish colonization
and a lot of it's from our indigenous
culture you'll see that a lot of them
have rice in it in various forms having
sticky rice means like good luck
stickiness is to stick the good luck to
you so a lot of this stuff like what we
call in tagalog is malakit is sticky
rice that we eat a lot during festive
seasons like new year's so that the good
luck sticks to us with all year round so
hopefully there's a lot of good luck
with everyone trying these snacks today
so the first snack we're trying is
called chicharron it is a deep-fried
pork rind or pork skin the perfect snack
to have with a beer by itself you dip it
in vinegar or you crush it up and you
put on top of your noodles it goes with
anything for our vegetarian vegan
friends we've got the vegetarian version
of chicharron which is made out of
dehydrated peas vegetarians you're not
going to miss out on chicharron hope you
enjoy it always wanted to eat this but i
never have been able to because it's
pork
so you get the vegan bread
to be honest i'm not pork's number one
fan i think it's overrated holy [ __ ]
that's not that's not fair that's not
that's gonna make some people feel real
bad about themselves okay cheers cheers
my love
oh the crunch
that's pretty good this is delicious
try this
i'm trying to seduce you summer air a
couple of babies put these on the table
i would demolish it veggies
version let's go
this is football that's
so good
so i'm sure that's also good it's just
the idea of eating like puffy skin
i love these that's really nice it
doesn't
taste like the original one but i like
both equally bloody good yeah holy [ __ ]
vegans win this round
so the next snack is called choc nut
it's like a small little chocolatey
peanut treat if you're not into
chocolate you might like it because it's
more peanuty than chocolatey zit i'm
looking at you
peanut milk chocolate this reminds me of
like some grand chocolate bar like
italian chocolate factory golden ticket
situation
oh it's crumbly it's kind of like a
flake almost if you're new here i don't
like chocolate but maybe i like filipino
chocolate
that's so peanutty
i'm so sorry the texture's [ __ ] weird
i love it why is it like fudge this
tastes like hollywood which is like a
middle eastern dessert
this is [ __ ] amazing i'm gonna do the
whole packet it's a bit intense for me
like it's nice it's just that i can't
cut that texture that's really weird
texture
yeah look at that it's like sand it's so
delicious though maybe i like filipino
chocolate because it's you're eating it
it doesn't taste like it but you're
still eating it because usually you'd be
like throwing up at this point so the
next snack
which means boy garlic or garlic boy
which is the quintessential flavor of
filipino cuisine it is a deep-fried corn
kernel that has been doused in garlic
flavor like if you love garlic oh my
gosh your world will be changed garlic
flavor poppy corn i love puppy things
the minute you open that or you can
smell it garlic
[Music]
oh that's gonna make us smell awesome
oh my gosh
oh my god it's like the kind of thing
you could like
just eat like a mouthful of
i like them once again would go really
well with like a beer this [ __ ] is right
up my alley stop eating it there's so
many snacks why you keep doing that
thumbs up
why are you giving it a thumbs up shout
out to philly proud and american for
hooking us up with these snacks [ __ ]
amazing
yum we'll be coming to visit and so
should be
so chippy is a filipino brand of chips
in the philippines this is a corn chip
it is a favorite of a lot of filipinos
a barbecue flavored corn chip and
they're called chippies
[Applause]
like a freaking spiral that's cool as
[ __ ] right oh yeah all right let's taste
these cheers
i feel like they'd go really well with
like an avocado dip i don't like it i
like the texture i can't taste anything
no flavoring needs to be about like 40
times the amount that's actually really
nice
what i just feel like it needs
like a dip it tastes like they forgot to
add the flavor stop crinkling
[Music]
this is why we're not paired in videos
i like when you show me that i'm
expecting like pal barbecue it doesn't
look like the picture
and i don't know in my dating
catfishing
not bad i would still late
oh my god i love turon it is like my
number one favorite pinoy snack thoran
is basically a banana spring roll but in
the philippines it's like sabbah banana
with jackfruit in it wrapped in spring
roll deep fried and then caramelized
brown sugar
so crunchy so good so indulgent
really good with ice cream basically if
this doesn't taste like pure happiness
i will be so confused oh [ __ ] wow
oh my
god it's very sweet it kind of tastes
like potato it does i like the sweet
kind of crunchy exterior like it's been
caramelized almost yeah yeah my sugar on
it yeah i need another bite for science
reasons obviously science is kind of
savoury which is really good yeah yum we
love that the banana has a little bit of
a flavor but it's more like a texture
that's really yummy
too sweet for me i quite like that i
think these are really cool though
because it's something that i haven't
tried before like i would never think to
put jackfruit in a spring roll i like
these they're solid they're solid they
are good yeah they're my favorite but
solid yeah so bibingka is a rice flour
cake so it's like the cake on top of a
banana leaf put in a terracotta pot and
cooked over coals that's how it's
traditionally made and then once it's
cooked you top it with cheese desiccated
coconut and a salted egg it's a very
special treat that we have during
christmas but you can eat it all year
round shout out to titus cakes for
giving us all this stuff
yeah wait
is that egg i thought that was coconut
and mango can you not see the egg guys
the egg is very obvious
yeah i know but i think it was like oh
it's salted egg salted egg oh no
look how cute the flag is
look at that color
looking at how
like spongy that is that is insane yes
that's super soft i am a little bit
skeptical about the egg though me too
i'm not a huge fan of coconut like this
wow wow this is really good holy [ __ ] a
lot of flavors there's a lot going on
god the philippines know what's up huh
did you buy the yolk yeah did you
actually because you can't taste it like
it's not gross i like it it's not really
eggy half of it the cake itself is
incredible that is so nice it's
so good dense but spongy
like a bunch maybe yeah like a bunt a
bunt i like the cake and the coconut
i'll pass from the egg that's really
good it especially the egg that was my
favorite bit
you're a [ __ ]
i am so suman or budbud is a glutinous
rice cake that's been wrapped in banana
leaves and then steamed and it comes out
kind of like in stick form so you can
like peel it like a banana you can have
with like caramel sauce highly recommend
came through dripping that is the best
thing i've ever seen on sauce in my life
once again presentation beautiful
this is so fun it reminds me of like um
the crackers you get at christmas
oh my god this is like a cheese trigger
but like
rice not this is very hypnotic
[Music]
do you think if we had penises this is
how we'd act
probably just flinging around the office
this is so good
okay i see why you would dip it because
that would taste like just rice
well that's a big bite yeah really
excited
because it's solid
caramel sauce and rice
this is yummy
[Applause]
i know it sounds really fun to say
is a purple rice steamed in its bamboo
shoots and then serve it on banana
leaves and you put like brown sugar with
coconut and lots of butter and you just
like slather all of that on top of it it
is so delicious all together this is a
pile of brown sugar
and butter it's glistening oh it's
stretchy
oh it keeps going it keeps going i'm
gonna use my hands i'm an indian i'm
very comfortable with my hands here i'm
experiencing like an entirely new flavor
in my mouth i know
i really like this
and then at the end there's a coconut as
well then i left like chewing the
glutinous rice with the coconut mm-hmm
it tastes so good did you get the sugar
you didn't get the
butter did you get the coconut i got the
gravy i actually got everything
real good i really like the chewiness of
the the rice the chewiness is freaking
me out i'm scared i'm gonna choke i like
it it reminds me of um
like bubble tea when you have the pearls
like the chewiness never had bubble tea
yeah that's a tick tock i know
don't what don't
don't
don't
can i get a new partner
wow it's so good also if i saw this on a
menu i honestly probably wouldn't wear
it
because i'd be afraid yes
i just feel like there's a lot of love
that goes into this and so i really
appreciate it for those reasons it's
just heavy so sapienza pin is another
glutinous rice cake sapienzapi means
sheets or layers and you'll see that
it's different colors so you've got the
bottom layer which is white vanilla the
yellow for jackfruit in the top layer
which is ube then you top that off with
latik which is basically a reduced
coconut milk that's turned into these
chewy flakes
all that together you've got different
textures and different flavors it is a
treat look at this that's gorgeous
i'm so into it i love coconut oh i feel
like i've made this myself i could just
smell this all day okay i'm not here to
smell i hate to eat so let's eat it
[Music]
oh my god this is [ __ ] amazing
flavor-wise like it's pretty good mm-hmm
it's also once again very filling yeah
like i'd probably have one half of these
maybe half pull it a day it doesn't
really have that much flavor which i
like like i don't want it to be too
enhanced no you can taste the jackfruit
it's very yum and it's very pretty
like cedar exactly i think that's the
first nice thing you've ever said to me
that's [ __ ]
[Laughter]
so ginataan bilobilo means sticky rice
balls in coconut milk
it's got a number of ingredients like
jackfruit sabbah which is banana the
glutinous rice balls themselves tapioca
pearls
sweet potato or ube in a smooth silky
coconut milk it is great cold it is
great hot but for me it is the ultimate
comfort food pure warm creamy comfort
whoa
i've never seen anything like this wow
this looks like fake food this looks
like it does it looks like fake food
[Music]
it just tastes like sweet coconut mmm
i think we just learned you're not a fan
of rice with this texture i love the
texture of the rice ball it's like mochi
it's [ __ ] delicious the coconut milk
is super creamy
super light not overly sweet it goes so
well with the fruit yeah the coconut
milk is good it makes me feel like like
i'm on holiday yeah two root vegetables
for me the rice ball was [ __ ]
delightful though
like so soft and i was crunchy
but not in like a sweet potato way maybe
like a grape
very little flavor though this out of
all the desserts so far my least
favorite this also reminds me of an
indian dessert we have called kierd
which is rice pudding
kind of similar flavor profiles but the
coconut in this just really shines so
sensitive which means unrivalled is
inspired by french cooking it's
basically layers of meringue with butter
and
some sort of nut usually cashew nuts or
pistachio nuts is this just balls of
butter
close it's actually supposed to be the
cake but they've made into bites one
bite how big do you think my drop my
mouth is the nuts on that looks awesome
this looks right up your alley yeah
that's my vibe
um
contest cashew these are cool not as
sweet as i was expecting it's a good mix
of like savory sweet i'm glad it's known
as this
as sweet because that would have kind of
taken away from that meringue it feels
illegal to eat because it tastes like i
know because it tastes like pure butter
please come and get me because i've done
something naughty buttercream so good so
smooth this has been in the freezer how
are you so smooth
oh my god
i'm like ascending right now
wow that's really something that is
something is it unrivalled
i mean look
it feels unrivalled sans revel
you win we ate all the snacks
love delicious loved it loved it loves
it love that what a birthday treat what
about birthday treats merry christmas
merry christmas happy birthday to you
