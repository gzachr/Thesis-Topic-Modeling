messy but it's so fresh it's a really nice thing
thank you enjoy I can't believe how good it 
looks the menu but you know the smell I wish  
you could smell it guys this is so amazing 
and you know the thing is the price is not  
so expensive I'm surprised here in Paris so 
let's try this menu from the Philippines we  
ordered Filipino Lumpia with vinegar suka 
and then we also ordered the crispy okoy  
veggie okoy with a sweet and sour sauce and 
we also ordered the Bikol Express of course  
with kaning with rice so I'm gonna 
start with the lumpia with Suka wow

crispy nice sour taste from the suka of course 
wow the filling so nice I don't know what's  
inside what kind of meat is that so nice they have 
a spoon and fork of course Filipino style they're  
like wooden you know wooden spoon and pork makes 
it look so cozy also the the plates and the bowls  
are made of wood it's a lunchtime here in Paris 
so we're gonna try the bicol express with rice
oh so good
so nice yeah immediately you can taste the  
um the coconut of course very rich coconut 
flavor I guess they use a coconut cream
you can taste a little bit of the bagoong but not 
so much and the sili it's spicy now it kicks in  
here I will take you around Paris I know you 
like to see Paris many of you have maybe been  
there already or maybe not I don't even know how 
many times I've been here but a lot but there's  
a few areas that I really like for example the 
arc de triomphe, champs elysee it's a really  
nice area and also the Eiffel Tower of course and 
the Louvre the museum but there are so many other  
nice areas in Paris and I will show you around 
a little bit so you can also enjoy the scenery  
of Paris and then later of course we're gonna 
enjoy more Filipino food here at Bobi we are  
here in the middle of Paris behind me you can 
see the art studio it's a really Ganda building
foreign
and behind me you can see the Eiffel 
Tower this is really a famous city  
worldwide known for many nice things

threat as well we're very grateful 
for its French people they like it is
okay and on the weekend we 
have the brunch like the silogs

vinegar vinegar-based sauce or this sweet and 
sour and she recommended the sweetest sour but  
and now I know why she recommended it's really 
good so now let us try the color my dessert
