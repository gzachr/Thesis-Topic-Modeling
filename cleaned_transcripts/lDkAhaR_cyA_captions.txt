street and there's so much here like i can't hey
this is so cool
wow this is cool there is so much 
i can't even like concentrate on  
what we're getting or what there is no so i 
understand i know that like a few of you in my  
comments even like you guys from the philippines 
were like hey don't don't go to different story  
or like be careful or anything like that and 
like i totally get it and maybe i'm getting  
this amazing reaction because i am a tourist i'm 
not sure i'm a vlogger and a vlogger i get it  
um and maybe you'd have a completely 
different experience i don't know hi  
but i have had a really good one here and everyone 
just seems so accommodating and so friendly  
and just like they are like i don't 
know just nice seems really nice  
i've got all the valuables in my hands and 
no one can take it but everyone's been like  
overwhelmingly nice here and everywhere else that 
we've been that it has been this sort of scenario  
i can't speak for your experience or like things 
that have happened to other people but for me hi  
it's all right but for me i have hi but for me 
i've had but for me i've had a really good one so  
i can't say anything's gone wrong when it hasn't  
and maybe that wouldn't be okay maybe 
that wouldn't be the case but it is for me  
and me so far so i've just been felt felt 
really welcomed um but yeah i'm taking all  
your advice on board but i haven't needed 
to so far yet i will just say that hi hi
mom hi oh thank you thank you thank you so much
they just subscribed to my 
channel that was so lovely  
he was like stopped on his motorbike and was 
like what's your channel that was awesome
everyone's just yelling welcome to the philippines 
this is cool little do you know i've been here for  
a month honestly i don't know where to go 
i think that the the thing with this mall  
is this probably is heaps of them and in the 
comments you'd probably say if you just took a  
left there instead of a ride we would have found 
them it is so big i don't think we could cover  
this all in one in one go without knowing where 
to go i'm just not sure where things are yeah  
all right we'll try this way but we're kind of out 
of the like really busy narrow streets right now  
and we're kind of into the more like bigger open 
kind of moore street hi so we're just heading down  
here again we had we don't really know where we're 
going well michael probably does i have no idea  
you have a small idea there's a lot of streets 
a lot of like streets that also look similar  
so i think you get a little bit lost um this is a 
whole different kind of vlog than i normally do so  
let me know in the comments if you like it 
or if you don't if you're new to my channel  
i do make different other kinds of videos 
as well not just ones like this but  
like this one if you do and leave some 
comments down below what you think  
but it's really cool to get that 
local interaction like to talk to  
everyone and say hello we're gonna try chicken 
intestines i think it's chicken i have to ask so  
we've come across the tutu band night market where 
you've all told me to come for some food let's  
see what there is here it's a short walk from the 
other divisoria market so let's see what there is
all right so for the purposes of the vlog we 
had two of these and josie's already ate one  
off camera right no she didn't want to try it but 
i'm gonna try it this is actually i don't know if  
it's chicken or beef you'll have to tell me in the 
comments but it's intestine of some sort and some  
sort of what i assume is like barbecuey hopefully 
like honey flavored because the filipinos do that  
a lot sauce top of it and whatever this is to dip 
it in which i don't know if i'm actually gonna dip  
it or not i'm not gonna lie i'm actually excited 
to try this i've been looking forward to this a  
lot so let's go it smells super good i've heard 
it's really chewy as well hmm this is potentially  
the weirdest texture i've ever eaten in my lap 
almost as chewy as mochi really flavor is awesome  
the iso like the intestine itself it almost tastes 
like the consistency is almost like clay like i'm  
eating play-doh i've been so admired so much more 
adventurous with my food since coming to thailand  
and now the philippines than i ever was back home 
but i'm still not up to eating intestines just yet  
so okay so michael just went and got some shupao 
which is it looks like it's like a chinese pork  
steamed bun but it's uh this is a filipino-style 
one so you can see the chinese influence but these  
ones apparently are a little bit bigger than the 
other ones and we do get like chinese steamed  
pork buns at home in australia if you go to like 
a chinese restaurant or something that's generally  
what you get so let's see if it tastes the same 
or what the differences are it looks really cool
oh all right the paper hold on really fluffy the 
inside has like big pieces you can actually see  
the pieces and then the sauce um whereas normally 
i think it's more of like a mint i don't know  
it's pretty tasty okay so we were actually 
told to not film and that we needed a permit  
so we're gonna end this vlog now but to to bear 
market and the divisoria one today was so cool  
i wish we could have shown you a little bit 
more but obviously we have to abide by the  
rules and stop now but make sure you do like and 
subscribe if you want to see any more street food  
or anything else you want me to try make sure 
to leave that in the comments below and again
