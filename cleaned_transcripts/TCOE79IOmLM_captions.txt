I just really miss this.
You know, we copy each other's answers.
Joke only!
[laughs]
I thought there's a goddess.
[laughs]
This is how I do it.
[makes a sound effect]
Am I good?
[laughs]
Just joking!
Campus tour!
Woohoo!
[claps]
Hey guys!
Welcome back to 'Heaven'!
So today, we're at a totally different location.
We're not at a taping,
we're not at home,
but we're here at SISFU!
Before we start,
I would just like to say
that we followed all
of the safety protocols.
Actually, we're the only ones here,
plus Ate Puril,
and of course,
our helpers here in school.
They were all able to get a swab test,
and so did we.
I just want to share with you
because there are a lot of you
who have commented about
knowing more about this school.
Before we start with SISFU,
I would like you to meet Ate Puril.
Puril: Hello and welcome to SISFU.
Southville International School
Affiliated with Foreign Universities.
That is the meaning of SISFU.
And Ate Puril is actually the one
who has helped me with everything.
Puril: I'm so proud of this girl.
Puril: I really missed you!
Yes!
Do you remember one of my old vlogs?
She was a part of it.
Our friendship has never changed,
so we really need to start.
Let's go!
So of course, we have one of these things.
I already sanitized my hand,
and this is a temperature checker.
36.2
I'm really safe.
Wow!
So now, we're in the lobby.
[exclaims]
Who's that?
Just kidding!
No, guys.
Do you know the story behind this?
This is actually an old picture.
It's okay if you don't change it anymore,
because it's the first photo shoot
that I had that's actually okay.
Okay so, in this lobby,
there's actually a meaning behind our logo.
Wow!
Are you proud that I still know the meaning?
Is this a test?
[laughs]
Ate Puril, really?
Okay.
So, wait.
I'll try.
So, the globe represents our international presence
and the rings around it,
it refers to the school's continuous presence
for technology.
Am I right?
Okay, nice!
So, the leaves represent excellence.
And then, the shield..
Actually, why is it shaped like a shield?
Puril: We are considering our students as paladins
Puril: and they're using shields, okay?
Puril: and that represents our affiliated schools here in SISFU.
And of course, we have here the clocks.
I think these are our partnerships.
Puril: Yes.
Like, we're partnered..
Puril: And some of our students are studying in those countries
Puril: and some of our employees here in SISFU
Puril: came from those countries as well.
So, we really are international.
Okay, let's go have a tour.
Campus tour!
Woohooo!
[claps]
Okay, I really missed this.
Actually, this is the only place I visit when I come here.
The Cafeteria.
I also made a vlog here, right?
I was eating something chicken.
Orange?
Lemon?
I missed those days where there were a lot of students
and professors that I talk to.
Like, I just have a conversation with them.
I really wish that everything will be okay
for everyone's sake, right?
Okay, guys!
Team, c'mon!
Let's tour!
We're now going to the Culinary Arts Laboratory.
Actually guys, I only went here once - 
No, twice because I went here
when I toured the school.
Puril: Yeah.
It's really beautiful.
If you want to take up Culinary,
this is really perfect because they're well-equipped.
Puril: That is where they practice real-time..
Oh, yes.
Puril: for their dishes.
Puril: And to mind you, those are international cuisines
Puril: so it's really good because we master the art of cooking.
Puril: Not only here in the Philippines,
Puril: but also we tackle most of international cuisines.
Wow, international cuisines!
I think those were the ones I ate at the cafeteria.
Puril: Yeah, definitely.
Wow!
See, here are the awards that we have,
and the certificates.
They're all very good.
Round of appluse!
Yay!
So now, we're going up.
I'll show you all the happenings from where I study.
Are we going to use the elevator? 
Yeah, definitely.
Guy, welcome to my school!
Puril: Did you miss the elevator here?
Yes!
This one, guys.
It's really..
It's really exhausting to go up the stairs
and resume studying.
No, just kidding.
That's why the elevator is needed.
We're just showcasing the premium facilities the school has.
So now, we're going to the second floor.
I remember a lot of memories.
I used to go here for face-to-face consultations
with the professors.
Is this the faculty?
Not yet, right? That's where the marketing - 
Puril: This is the marketing, the admin office.
Yes, so this is the marketing and admin office.
Puril: Registration.
Yes, registration too.
That's where I had my ID picture taken.
Oh, is my ID picture still here?
Puril: Yes, it's upstairs.
I want to show you my ID picture!
Puril: Say "Hi", Heaven!
What?
It's you again.
[exclaims]
[laughs]
I thought there's a goddess.
I'm just kidding.
Puril: That's funny.
Really?
You're a true friend.
Yeah, it's funny.
Okay, wait!
I'll show you my ID,
but I'll just cover the info.
There you go.
See?
It's fine. 
My face was chubby before.
So this is where I got it actually.
Now, we're going - 
Actually, this is the classroom I go to.
I just really miss this.
You know, we copy each other's answers.
No, just kidding!
I just really miss talking to my classmates.
You just miss those memories, right?
So...
Puril: You studied here.
Puril: Accounting!
Yes, this was where I studied Accounting, guys.
This was where I understood Accounting.
For the first time.
No, just kidding!
The professors here are excellent.
That's where I recorded my old vlog.
There you go.
Right here.
I had a lot of papers,
a lot of books
because we focused a lot on research.
I did my assignments from other subjects
at this table, so I really miss those memories.
I really hope everything will be okay.
Actually, i was really happy that before this pandemic started,
SISFU already had Online Blended Learning.
It was really fortunate
because they have the flexibility,
accessibility,
and because of that,
I only have one unit left.
And I'm about to graduate.
This is where I should be.
Puril: The Graduate School?
[laughs]
Just kidding!
[laughs]
There!
Do you have a pictorial?
[laughs]
Such a girly girl!
So what do they do here?
Is this where they study..
Puril: Yeah, the Hospitality Management students.
Yes.
Puril: They're commonly accredited by Australia.
Puril: Okay, we have a partner school in Australia.
Yes.
Puril: What's the best thing is that,
Puril: they will have their internship in Australia.
Oh, okay.
Puril: Paid internship in Australia.
Paid?
Paid internship in Australia.
Woah!
Wait, Ate Puril.
I have a question.
Am I understanding it right?
If you're a Hospitality Management student,
you'll get an Australian degree.
Puril: Yes.
And, you'll get a paid internship in Australia.
Puril: Yes.
Puril: If you applied there.
Puril: Because you can choose to have your internship here
Puril: in the Philippines
Puril: or there in Australia.
Wow!
Actually, it's the same with my course, right?
Puril: Same!
I'm currently taking up Business Management
and it's with the UK Online Blended Learning.
Puril: Yeah, that's Pearson UK.
Yes, with Pearson UK.
Puril: So if you want to work there
Puril: and if you want to have your internship there,
Puril: you could definitely apply.
Yes, because I will get a UK degree
after I finish the last unit.
[screams]
Puril: Are you excited? October!
My energy is through the roof!
Puril: I'm so proud of you!
[squeals]
Puril: October!
Yes, I'll be finished this October,
and I'm going to finally graduate.
What are we going to do for our graduation?
Puril: Graduation should be face-to-face
Puril: but we will pray for that
Puril: so it would be like that.
I just wish things will be okay soon.
Puril: Even they online..
It's so sad.
Can't I just postpone my graduation?
Puril: You want to use the elevator or the stairs?
Let's use the stairs this time!
Puril: Here is the Senior High School Student Center
Puril: and that's where they study.
Puril: Those computers are available for their review.
Research.
Puril: Yeah. And this room is considered
Puril: as if you are serious in your studies,
Puril: then, you should be here.
This is where I usually stay.
[laughs]
Puril: You stay here all the time?
You didn't know?
Puril: I didn't know!
[laughs]
You really didn't know?
Puril: I really didn't know!
Puril: You didn't tell me!
Puril: And, if you guys want to have fun
Puril: and then play games, here.
Chill.
Puril: Here, chill. Yes, that's correct.
Puril: I see you here often.
Yeah, this is where I usually go.
Puril: This is where you really go.
Why are you throwing me under the bus?
Puril: No.
Just kidding!
Actually guys, when I go here,
there aren't many students.
It's either their summer break
and I am still studying here.
Puril: She doesn't have a choice
Puril: because I'm the only one with her
Puril: and the professors.
Yes, and the professors.
So, I'll go there and then I take a nap.
Puril: You don't sleep!
Puril: She just asks for coffee.
Puril: "Ate, is there coffee?".
But Miss Anabelle,
I really do study.
Puril: Ms. A, your daughter is finally graduating.
Sir Leo, I don't just hang out here.
I also go there.
Puril: Studying.
Wow!
So what's this?
Puril: So, here are the books.
Puril: So, you could actually grab that right now.
Puril: This is designed by our Student Council,
Puril: the Student Affairs team,
Puril: so that you could just grab it and read it.
This is perfect for my last unit.
Puril: Here is the..
Computer Lab.
Puril: Computer Lab.
Puril: Have you been here?
No.
Puril: Not yet? Yeah, this is where..
Puril: And now, SISFU will be offering
Puril: Information Technology.
Yeah?
Puril: So before, we...
So we'll have Information Technology?
Puril: Yeah, we're going to have Information Technology this year.
Puril: So, yeah. Stay tuned for that.
Ooh, so wait.
We'll have IT students, right?
Puril: Yeah.
Puril: And that's also UK Qualification.
UK Qualification.
You know what's nice here?
You'll get a degree.
Like, from UK, Australia..
Puril: You will be accepted in the Commonwealth countries.
Puril: You could work there.
Puril: Singapore! There.
So for everyone who wants to work abroad,
this is the school for you
since they have so many connections and partnerships.
So Southville will be able to help students
that have families abroad, right?
So, this is the gym.
My favorite part.
Puril: We were supposed to invite you to SISFUN.
Puril: Last year, you were supposed to play like, any sport.
I didn't want to.
I was too shy!
It's really nice and it's big, right?
I really miss the intramurals.
The SISFUN, that's what we call it.
This is how I do it.
[makes sound effect]
Am I good?
[laughs]
Just kidding!
Puril: You don't have anyone to play with.
[laughs]
Okay, let's go, guys!
So guys, this is the Capital Market Learning Center.
This is where they study stocks.
Actually, I've been here before.
So, you offer this to all students?
Puril: Yes, we encourage students to join.
It's nice, right?
They're really competent.
Here are some..
Clocks?
Puril: Yes, the clocks.
Puril: Tokyo, Frankfurt, and Lagos!
We're going to one of my favorite places.
Puril: Where is that?
Secret!
You'll find out later!
Puril: Wait, I don't know what it is!
[laughs]
And now, we're entering Bistro Lima.
So, Bistro Lima is actually for Hospitality Management students,
so they're the ones who handle this area.
They really give the Hospitality Management students real-time guests
for them to apply what they've learned.
And now, we're going to eat!
Thank you so much, Southville for the dessert!
There's cake!
Okay, so let's eat and talk for a bit.
So let's talk about Jodi Sta. Maria.
Did she really study face-to-face?
Puril: Yeah, face-to-face.
Who made this?
Puril: It was made by our Culinary students,
Puril: and of course, Miss Cath.
Puril: Thank you, Miss Cath!
Wow, thank you so much!
It's so delicious!
Puril: She prepared it for you yesterday.
Thank you!
So wait a minute.
Southville has two campuses, am I right?
Puril: We have 5 campuses.
Puril: Here in Las Pinas, we have the Southville International School,
Puril: which is considered as the purple school,
Puril: so you won't be confused.
Puril: And we also have SISFU,
Puril: which is Southville International School
Affiliated with Foreign Universtities.
Puril: So there you have it.
Puril: Perfect.
So what's the difference?
Puril: We have the Philippine diploma in SISC.
Puril: And among the four schools, only SISFU
Puril: has this UK and Australian degree.
Puril: They have those kind of degrees,
Puril: so when you graduate, you will see your diploma.
Puril: It's really UK
Puril: or it came from Australia.
Wow!
Puril: UK degree.
Here at SISFU, the place we just toured.
Before the pandemic, they already have online.
Online classes were offered by Southville School
Affiliated with Foreign Universities.
That's really nice!
Puril: Even before the pandemic, SISFU was already offering online courses
Puril: because most of our students are studying from the US.
Puril: Some of them are working abroad,
Puril: and some of them are celebrities
Puril: just like the one I'm sitting right next to.
Liza Soberano.
Puril: Yeah, Liza Soberano.
Ate Liza.
She studies here.
Who else?
Kuya Enrique too?
Puiril: Right, Enrique.
Enrique Gil.
Puril: And Joshua Garcia.
Joshua Garcia.
Puril: Same program with you,
Puril: but he majors in Entrepreneurship.
Wow!
Puril: Yours is Business Management, right?
Yes!
Puril: Gabbi and Khalil, too.
What do they study?  Business Management also?
Puril: Business Management, same as yours.
That couple is so nice.
It warms my heart.
Actually guys, I just wanna share the reason I went here.
Because I'm graduating, and it's been
a long time since I've seen the campus.
So, I might as well visit before I graduate.
Puril: You have to stay true, okay?
Puril: And I'll keep you posted.
Puril: So those tarps within SISFU premise,
Puril: that's gonna be you, still!
Puril: And yeah, we are just so honored
Puril: to have you as our student ambassador.
Puril: Yeah, I would just like to extend our gratitude
Puril: coming from SISFU.
Puril: I really appreciate you going here
Puril: because she's just too busy all the time.
Puril:  But, she's one of our dedicated student ambassadors
Puril: here at SISFU
Puril: and we are just so proud of Heaven.
Puril: And knowing her,
Puril: doing all of the hard works.
Puril: And she's now going to graduate this coming October.
Puriul: I just wanna cry.
Puril: Yeah, she's really close there,
Puril: and yeah, we're just so proud of you.
Puril: And I just wanted you to know
Puril: that SISFU is so, so happy
Puril: that we have you here at SISFU
Puril: because you consider us wholly as a family.
Puril: Not just only an education provider for her,
Puril: but yeah.
Puril: That's her.
Puril: Really humble.
I was really touched by your message.
But yeah, I really consider Southville as my family.
They're extremely helpful
and I wouldn't have been able to finish my studies
if not for them.
They were immensely patient with me
because at some point,
it was too difficult to study
especially in the online course.
Because of the pandemic,
we really had to adjust.
Of course, I would have preferred face-to-face classes.
Southville understood my needs
and that's why I go here.
Because I prefer face-to-face lessons.
I want to talk to my professors.
I want to learn from them in person.
That's why I wish for things to go back
to the way they used to be.
Anyways, that's it!
