so guys before i start this video
i would like to show you around i am
actually walking on the forest and
alone and i decided to make this vlog
and also before i start this video i
would like to give
some uh thoughts about the
corona situation here in norway because
people are asking me about
how is it going norway the corona
situation the travel bugs etc etc
you know it's a very general that i
cannot answer
all your questions and i cannot give the
right answer because
i am not really authorized to do that
and um there's a lot of things going on
there's a lot of rules updated from time
to time here in norway so
i actually recommended and suggested
that you should go to the main website
of
norwegian institute of public health and
you will find all
the necessary information and details
that you are looking for about corona
situation here in norway
i'm gonna put the link on the
description box below so you can access
the website yeah
oh my god i remember we went here last
time
around autumn with daniel and then we
fly the drone
up there on that
on that mountain and i cannot go alone
since
it's very slippery and rocky
but i'm gonna go and walk a little bit
further show you around it's really nice
out here
[Music]
so i manage and i'm still walking
through the forest and it's actually
getting dark it's just almost
past 2 p.m and i can see the sun
going down but i have to hurry
so yeah it's not easy
it's not really easy to make vlog while
walking on the forest
[Music]
so this is the area where they cut
all those trees and use it as a
christmas tree
oh my god
so in this video i will be sharing to
you what living in norway taught me that
changed
my life forever you know things i
learned while living here in norway and
some of it
is i already adopted and i think this
will also help you to understand the way
of life here in norway if you are
new or planning to move here in norway
it's
totally different from the rest of the
world there is so many many things
that i learned during my almost four
years of staying here in norway
and still the norwegian language
is a big big challenge for me and i'm
still learning it
but there are most important things that
norway has taught me so number one
is the importance of privacy
i knew that this might sound like cliche
but
this is one of the most important thing
that norway has taught me
you know although i can say that my life
is an open book for
most of everyone and you knew
some of my past story i shared it to my
social media account but
nowadays i don't share the most private
you know
like what is going on to my life from
time to time
and norway taught me to give importance
of being
low-key and this is the reason why i
don't do the normal
everyday vlogging live work updates
personal things about me
i mean us in facebook or you know in
youtube
because i want to keep it thriving and
also
most people are asking me why my
norwegian husband
is not appearing in most of my
blog in youtube because he is a
norwegian
and i respect his you know privacy
concern
and i understand that and i want to
remind you that in norway you cannot
just take
you know photos or other people uh other
people photos video
other people property home especially
taking photo of kids
and posting it on social media you might
want to think
many many many times before you post and
uh just ask for permission you know
so i guess if i am in the philippines
right now
and i never live in norway i am not sure
if i am ever
gonna know the importance of privacy
well
yeah um
and the second one is the work-life
balance you know
if you're gonna ask a lot of immigrants
living in norway
they will tell you that a work balance
in norway
is the best and it's very different from
other country
or the rest of the world you know in my
country balancing work
and personal life is very difficult
unless you are in a high class society
seriously i receive a lot of message
from people living mostly in
america in canada and they will ask me
this
random questions about how they can
migrate to norway
because they heard and knew a lot of
stuff go like good stuff about norway
and
you know in norway you basically work to
live and
not live to work meaning you can allow
yourself to have a vacation to relax
and have a family time do your hobby and
just enjoy yourself you know
my friends also noticed i became more
relaxed after i moved to norway
and because the old me will always kind
of
like stressing and the third one is the
importance of
health way before the pandemic hit us
norway already taught
me how to look after your physical
health
emotional health and especially your
mental health
you know the health care system here is
the best
in the world although it's expensive and
not everything
is free here they gonna provide you
with a very good quality of health care
and it's for everyone meaning
there is equality here in norway
so you know i just want to share this
story about someone
who had a broken heart because of a
failed relationship
and they went to a doctor
to check the you know mental health and
the doctor
told them to have an off from work take
some time to rest relax and take care of
your mental health and get a vacation
you know without
people judging you you can do that here
in norway
that's why health is a very big deal
here in norway so
i love this mentality you know and the
fourth one on my list that
norway taught me is the nature therapy
is a real thing and a very big thing
here in norway
you know i love this norwegian nature
norwegian people for uh their desire to
keep
the nature clean and pure and they
really preserve
the nature at its best i was actually
here in the middle
of the forest and i am watching the sun
set right now you know guys norway was
so blessed with some you know of the
most beautiful
nature on planet and norwegians are very
lucky and you know they know this and
they take advantages
advantages of it on a regular basis but
in a positive way because
it's very beneficial to everyone so i
guess norway taught me to be more active
every day i didn't feel any pressure
because
i knew i will have a lot of good
benefits from it
you know walking to the ninja oh my god
you can always find them hiking
active and playing around the forest
just enjoying the nature
