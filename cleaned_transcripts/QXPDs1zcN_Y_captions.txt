we're the Lockwoods and we're traveling the 
world to experience up close and in person  
all the natural wonders and distinct cultures that 
our kids would otherwise be consuming only through  
textbooks and TV after a one-day delay caused 
by a misflight connection we've made it to the  
beautiful island of siargao in the Philippines 
since we've missed a day of island hopping and  
Adventure we're teaming up with a couple of 
locals to pack as much into just two nights  
as possible let's get to it we finally made it 
to Siargao and it's beautiful here it called for  
rain the whole time but look it is sunny and 
gorgeous out so we're going to be chasing the  
good weather a little bit and hoping that we're 
going to have good weather the rest of the day  
because we cannot wait to explore this whole 
island we just met up with our tour guide Zach  
with travel Essentials and he's going to take us 
around and we can't wait to see it but if we're  
being realistic we are probably going to hit a 
lot of rain today it really does feel like the  
wet season here even though it's the opposite 
the forecast currently calls for about an 80  
to 85 percent chance of rain every single hour 
throughout the day so we will see if we luck out  
hi nice thank you we're all starting off 
in the van and June is our driver hello  
good morning my friends how are you this 
morning subscribe to ABC yeah the people  
of the Philippines are some of the nicest on the 
planet but traveling anywhere around the world  
still carries risks especially when you're 
a YouTuber family whose life is built around  
online access that's why we run nordvpn on all 
our devices it keeps us secure when connecting  
to any public or unsecured Wi-Fi networks on 
PAL flights Beachside Donsol cafes airport  
lounges or remote house boats in Hidden Palawan 
lagoons nordvpn encrypts all of our data before  
it gets sent over Wi-Fi so it would just 
look like the Matrix to anyone trying to  
intercept our financial transactions personal 
Communications or Oregon Duck football games
nordvpn has over 5000 servers around the world 
allowing us to choose between maximum speed and  
maximum access to the content we like watching 
back home like Oregon Duck football games and  
since we can connect up to six devices with a 
single nordvpn subscription our entire family  
is covered for one low price you can support our 
Channel and try nordvpn for yourself with a 30 day  
money back guarantee by clicking the link in the 
description or the pin comment below they'll hook  
you up with huge discounts plus one additional 
month for free [Music] so that's the best one  
yeah okay Mom we just bought some bamboo straws 
thank you we just bought some bamboo straws to  
take home with us we see these at restaurants all 
around the world and they're very eco-friendly  
and we're like hell yeah we want some of those for 
our house they don't last forever or anything but  
you keep them in the refrigerator they last 
longer you can use them over and over until  
they get so dried out that they start to break 
apart so that's a cool souvenir we're trying to  
replace plastics as much as we can it's not an 
easy task but little by little we're hopefully  
going to make a difference and get rid of the 
use of plastics one two three okay let's go
[Music]
[Music] [Applause]  
they call that the human drone we've 
been curious what they meant by human  
drone and you're gonna have to follow us 
on Instagram to see how it turns out oh and  
um on YouTube we've got both the coconut Forest 
has over 652 million coconut trees I actually  
don't know I just made that up but all these 
coconuts are taken by a private company and  
then used to make beauty products shampoos 
conditioners and that sort of thing which I  
think is really phenomenal coconut forest in a 
very small town and that's how the locals make  
money by selling the bamboo straws and doing 
the human drone for you so if you do that make  
sure to tip them because that's their income 
starting out itself is known as the surfing  
capital of the Philippines although there 
are other popular activities here like rock  
climbing and spelunking or Cliff exploration to 
the late person this was the path that we were supposed  
to fly yesterday Manila to Siargao speaking of 
rock climbing check this out shark out was a  
relatively small island it's 437 square kilometers 
so about 169 square miles but more important than  
the size of the island is the beauty Siargao 
was named the number one Island in Asia in the  
2021 Conde naste traveler readers Awards well now 
we're in Del Carmen that's where we flew into
that and go to Sugba Lagoon
the largest contiguous mangrove forest in 
the Philippines that's Mangrove not mango  
Erin here in Del Carmen they actually have like 
the largest chunk of that for us which is like 5000  
hectares of mangrove forest including 3000
crocodiles I hope we see some because I  
want to see how big they are how big are they 
Zach crocodiles it's like a 10 feet yeah 10  
feet oh that's pretty big that's pretty big I'm 
really concerned for Colt because he tends to  
want to catch a crocodile but that's not allowed 
also he just said they're nocturnal and they're  
nocturnal so they're gonna be sleeping we're not 
even gonna see them there's a baby on the boat
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
this entire Lagoon is absolutely stunningly 
gorgeous but obviously the big attraction here is  
going to be the jumping or diving deck up here so 
I think we're gonna get both kids to go off this  
time they don't always do the cliff diving at our 
destinations but this one's like 10 feet high so I  
think we can get them both to do it so let's give 
them some encouragement yeah I love it confidence  
gotta do the sunblock protect your skin and we 
love sunbum 50. Brooklyn is a very brave girl  
she's gonna go first she's really Brave and she's 
excited about it right baby yeah looking down now  
remember it's not actually this High it 
seems like it [Music] you can do it sweetie
[Applause]
[Music]
great job baby
I'm terrified yes
[Music] so when I I like jumped off and I'm like 
as soon as I jumped off I'm like why did I do that  
I'm proud of you guys
can I go again and here comes that 
rain we've been avoiding all morning  
it's perfect timing we got in all of our 
fun all of us jumped and I'm really proud  
of the kids but we're gonna have 
to make it back in the rain now
the rain stopped got about a half an hour 
on the boat and then a half an hour drive  
to get to the next place for lunch the rain 
is off and on in the middle of our trip back  
we had a torrential downpour so much so 
we couldn't even pull the camera back  
to protect our equipment and if you want to know 
what equipment we use while we're vlogging and  
traveling you can go to followabc.com/gear 
they probably think I'm crazy that's how I  
get the water out of my ear you hop on one leg 
and tilt your head to the side why does it have  
to be on one leg I don't know but it works 
that's exactly right it works who knows why
a little pit stop for a road trip snack  
this one's piping hot they're called 
Ponte toy toy and it means nipple
good bread helps that we're starving but 
right off the oven like that that is so  
good oh it's like a hot potato the way they 
cook them they make a little dough rolls put  
them in the drawer and right above that they 
have all of the with the fire going so it's  
heated from above and she's just constantly 
moving them around to keep them evenly cooked  
and then throws them into the box makes it 
look so easy the best bread I've ever had  
my entire life we're getting dressed we're 
getting back on the road for our real lunch
is this a great little Beach area mug cook  
what he said yeah that's exactly it but look at 
this view the ocean the beach it looks gorgeous  
all right this is where we're setting up shop 
it is Mama Soul Grill but before Lunch is ready  
in about 10 minutes we're gonna head down 
here and take a look at the beach real quick  
there are signs on the trees I thought they said 
no snorkeling but actually I think they say no  
smoking I was like it would make sense if it was 
no snorkeling because it seems pretty rough this  
is the Pacific Ocean and it's the Pacific trench 
that goes all the way from here up to Japan it's  
some of the deepest sea in this area so that 
makes sense really big waves these are gnarly  
see that surf term gnarly what is it I cut 
a some sort of caterpillar I put him down  
did you see the plate of mangoes okay 
I gotta start with one of these spring  
rolls they're vegetable spring rolls probably 
use one of those sauces but I'm not going to  
um I love the size they're like fingerling 
fingerling spring rolls dig into this  
grilled pork oh wow a lot of barbecue flavor 
everything's so good and the sweet and sour  
fish and it's not just sweet and sour let's get 
a nice little kit to it this is stuffed squid  
we also have Fried Chicken peel and eat 
shrimp a whole mess of rice and of course  
the mango and bananas so I'm gonna need 
both hands for this so we're gonna Chow  
Down we just found this little kitty 
cute he's so cute and sleepy I love it
let's go play in the water it's 
not a Sandy Beach but it's very  
cool there's like a tiny little 
seaweed that's growing down here  
maybe some algae and it's very Rocky 
but it's Crystal Clear Water beautiful  
the unevenness and slipperiness of the Rocks 
makes it kind of treacherous to walk through here
we're gonna go check out the tide
pretty crowded but that'd be good it's a popular 
spot talk about a tide pool that really looks  
like a swimming pool just a huge drop off Blue 
Water like a pool this is quite the trek we  
are walking around the tidal pool to get to 
the Rocks all on the other side so it is so  
deep over there in the pool so it's almost like 
an edge of a cliff you can't go too close to it  
and we're trying our best to keep the kids close 
to us too because uh it's it's really slippery  
Rocks Under here so be careful right over here 
is the namesake for this beach and it's this big  
rock that's sitting on top of another rock they're 
not actually connected it's just plopped on there
that was a lot of fun Colt found in eel he 
was hiding in a little hole and its head  
kept popping out not positive it's an eel he says 
it's a eel it could have been a sea snake but it  
was really cool really interesting we got more 
stuff to see so we're getting back in the van  
Another roadside stop but this time it's 
not for bread it's for something that  
looks like a clam are they clams yeah in 
Filipino word it's twice oh you're gonna  
go first gonna start with plain and then 
try the vinegars not like an oyster super  
mild seawater flavor and that's about it no 
Brine and then just go for it everything yeah
all of it one of those I got a big one 
I love clams clams are my favorite over  
oysters mussels what have I got myself into that 
is the biggest clam I have ever seen that's huge
a little messy I'm gonna redeem myself 
that last one was a little too big this  
looks like a a pretty approachable size 
so good and that spicy vinegar is awesome  
thank you [Music] we just stepped down 
here to the Mason River and this is like  
a combination of salt water and fresh 
water and everybody's gonna jump off of  
another high dive I don't know if I get to 
do it or not I keep playing cameraman today
hi everybody it was awesome and honestly that 
was refreshing to jump into the fresh water  
instead of the salt water it hits you like 
it was a little terrifying from up there it's  
like the same height but it looks much higher 
even like on the top on the top yeah it looks  
much higher than it would when the last time 
when we were on the top can I go one more time
I think I prefer the first one because
because it doesn't have it doesn't make 
my eyes scream and Agony and pain Zach  
has another place he wants to show us and I 
don't know how you can top any of this this  
has been really incredible really like 
exotic locations that we're going to  
beautiful scenery and Wild Adventures for the 
kids like them they're so brave I'm proud mama
welcome to Molly now and the secret Beach this 
all used to be white sand nice and soft on your  
toesies but after typhoon Odette about a year ago 
it pulled all of these rocks from the water out  
here and washed them right over the Breakwater 
and into the sand it doesn't look so secret no  
it's well known with the locals so some of the 
tourist companies will bring people here it's  
more of a name than literally a secret this is so 
cool I love the sand what because it's like Silk
it feels a lot like a lagoon here but it is salt 
water and it's a beautiful smooth smooth beach you  
can rent a bunch of stuff like kayaks and these 
boats over there but we are just gonna chill and  
relax and absorb the day we've just had because 
it's been an eventful day a lot of fun a lot of  
fun and if you're curious we use travel Essentials 
so you can check them out on their Facebook page  
if you want to book them too this is one of the 
more expensive areas of Siargao where hotel rooms  
can easily run 1500 to 2 Grand per night and 
if you wanted to buy here real estate prices  
are approaching about a thousand dollars U.S per 
square meter so do the math on that Philippines  
isn't so much cheaper than the us anymore Brooklyn 
can't get out a sandcuffed her to the beach  
perfect relaxing time to end a day of activities 
but don't go anywhere yet this is where we're  
staying and this is our favorite room in our Villa 
the bathroom it's huge and it brings the jungle  
in with you so you feel like you're showering 
Outdoors which is our favorite thing to do we got  
the deluxe Villa so we have a king-sized bed but 
they brought in a little extra mattresses for the  
kids to have their own beds separating us but then 
Phil and I still get to be together and we've been  
binge watching our new favorite YouTubers mom duty 
let me show you our favorite feature of this room  
we have the sliding glass door right on the pool 
so we can jump right in and we have a corner  
Villa on the ocean so beautiful ocean views and 
poolside views they only have 10 of these Villas  
and then they have some uh indoor Suites as well 
big wraparound porch and a lot of amenities here  
at Siargao Blue they have a Sunset Bar beautiful 
place to have a cocktail they have a yoga room a  
small gym and breakfast is included each morning 
I really like a good beach club something with a  
nice bar where you can sit in the shade enjoy 
a few cocktails looking out at the water and  
they have a fantastic one here in addition to 
a little beach just a little bit farther down  
there they have a great Spa here if you're into 
getting massages you can even get some right out  
here next to the water that's a really cool 
way to get a massage in a tropical location  
I usually give Aaron her massages so we save 
money when we travel the rates here run about 25000  
Philippine pesos night which comes out to 
equivalent of about 500 US dollars or so at  
least for the Villa that we're in some of the 
other options are less expensive than that and  
across the way here is General Luna which is 
the most developed little town on the entire  
Island and we're gonna head into town now because 
the internet here is not ideal and we are trying  
so hard to get our next episode out to you so 
we're gonna go in search of some food and Wi-Fi  
it's just a 15 minute walk and really there's 
only one main road so we're not gonna get lost
warm day that was a hot 15 minutes but we made 
it spot a pig there are a lot of cute shops on  
the street this is where you go if you need 
groceries but we just need internet I want to  
give a shout out to shella one of our followers 
who told us that the spotted pig has internet  
she saw on our Instagram that we were struggling 
getting our episode out and she recommended it  
for us so thank you first order of business is 
going to be a cool drink and then second order  
of business is getting on the Wi-Fi alright I got 
something on the way but I'm gonna hydrate before  
I dehydrate bartender Phil back at work I got some 
ginger ale because now we have no ginger beer this  
will be the closest thing I know it's different 
by the way ginger beer is brewed and ginger ale  
is not that's the difference between the two 
I got a double shot of Captain Morgan because  
I think it's spiced rum and that's the closest 
thing we can come to a dark rum and then I got  
some rocks with some lemon I was actually hoping 
to have room for the ginger ale in here but since  
I don't first of all we'll make a little room and 
voila back in the States or more appropriately in  
Bermuda this would be called a dark and stormy 
it's just not very dark just as tasty though  
success cold cold mango smoothies obsessed with 
mangoes and we are online and we are uploading  
our episodes so the one we're doing right now is 
our floating markets episode from when we're in  
Thailand I hope you check that out I hope you 
like it you do let us know we came we launched  
the episode we conquered thank you for all 
the comments that started pouring in right  
away while we had internet to respond so thank 
you thank you and now we have a plane to catch  
we've got another stop to make before we are done 
with this little southeast Asia tour and then we  
move on to more and more destinations we're 
gonna go to one more place on the way back to  
the hotel now this is an exceptionally beautiful 
day the sun's right overhead but it's not too hot  
definitely not cold it just feels like a perfect 
tropical day to have some ice cream ice cream
is cool I'm going to get Fanta and venereos 
I want to get the strawberry crispy popsicle
it's corn a big lump and knob it's got 
the juice it's got the juice [Music]

which oh I love it was a big lump no but  
it's got the juice it's got the juice oh 
my God tastes like corn it's insane and  
it's delicious I love it this is my favorite 
it's my beef pan down for me all right let's  
go one thing I'm going to miss the most about 
being here is the bananas and did you know the  
bananas grow up like this not down one day I 
want to come across these when they're ripe  
pick one and eat it we didn't get the chance 
on this trip though well goodbye chargow and  
hello Vietnam we have an 11 hour Trek ahead of 
us we're gonna get there in the middle of the  
night in the meantime I hope that you'll consider 
helping out that YouTube algorithm we really love  
the Philippines and the more engagement we 
get on this the more the YouTube algorithm  
likes it and rewards it and shares it with 
more people so that we can get more tourists  
into this beautiful country so please like comment

check us in for an international itinerary so
