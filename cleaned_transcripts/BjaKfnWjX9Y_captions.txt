Hi guys!
Today we're going to play a game of
PINOY HENYO!
Basically pinoy henyo is a 
filipino version of 20 questions
But instead of 20 questions 
we have a time limit so
unlimited questions with a time limit of 2 minutes
2 minutes
and we'll be paired into two groups
one will guess the word which 
will be strapped on our foreheads
and the other will answer 
with a yes, no, or maybe.
so let's get started
what's the penalty?
The penalty is, for our next video, I 
have to wear like makeup the whole video
So Gelo lost again
