I remember recently in one of your videos you had  
the worst pangang ever where was it in Malaysia 
Malaysia they serve a fried banana with soy sauce  
with soy sauce and in the soy sauce they put 
garlic garlic and banana it it was awful that  
sounds like a wrong combination so this one is 
better than I guess very good very good good all

maruya Maru mar mar mar first we try this okay 
okay cheers buddy okay cheers quite warm on your

actually so you can actually taste the the pieces 
of sugar like you know this small Crystal pieces  
yeah so you can still taste them okay this one you 
bite into it and I don't even have banana in my  
mouth now ah because the outside layer is so thick

20 pesos per stick yeah yeah wow good food great 
prices and even better people okay Sal thank you

this was delicious man great experience and great  
food yes yeah really nice when I eat a banana like 
that I think why would I ever eat raw banana ever  
again it's so much better when you with sugar put 
sugar on it so good it's good for your diet yeah  
exactly and yeah earlier I mentioned already 
that the whole day today is planned with a new  
tool that I've been using and the tool is called 
Magic Ai and it works basically like jet GPT but  
for traveling so for example so if you're planning 
a trip let's say to Manila as well so you can just  
insert the dates that you're traveling and then 
let magic AI do all the planning for you you can  
for example also say specifically what you want to 
do do you want to find food do you want activities  
do you want to find restaurants or do you want 
to find hotels and then magic AI will recommend  
certain places to you and if you're going for 
example to a restaurant or to a hotel magic  
AI can also read through the reviews and then 
summarize them for you and the best thing about  
magic AI is that it's completely free to use you 
can just click the link in the description on the  
pin comment give it a try play a little bit around 
with it and then plan your next trip to wherever  
you want to go so thanks to Magic for sponsoring 
today's video and now let's try more food okay  
so we just negotiated a price for one of these 
tricycles here this is actually a very interesting  
tricycle a very large one actually you want to 
sit next to your wife no I stand up back here come  
stand with me okay maybe can you hold this okay 
okay so we're going to the next location now in
maybe it's not safe maybe just one person stands 
there and not three okay we had the front of the  
bike in the air hello hello everyone waving 
over there it was a bit scary no it was a bit  
scary yeah oh you can sit here okay oh can sit 
there ah he was bringing cat bards oh so nice  
thank you thank you I there feel more safe 
inside the structure anyway yeah yeah okay  
okay do it I can also sit there if you want okay 
sure okay okay it's not even a motor bike what  
is this it's going to pedate no way but it is 
motorized right yeah is there a motor or maybe  
we should get out first while he's pulling 
it oh it seems to be okay he's strong this  
is a very interesting uh tricycle I'm not even 
sure if this is a tricycle and look at his like  
seat here like self-made seat very interesting 
oh very unique again Bic bicycle fully GLE yes  
okay very interesting is it safe yes safe okay 
oh there's a motor in there a tiny little motor  
in there almost almost like a lawn mower like 
a small motor is he using this now to stop it  
he's going to pull that and here it is gone 
oh what's happening now oh oh yeah oh what oh
wow oh this is
interesting this is I thought first part this  
is a regular tricycle but it's 
definitely not a regular tricycle
wow that looks so
cool wow this is
exciting I'm wondering if this is like a 
self-made vehicle it seems like it's all  
metal that he like welded together and 
then taped everything together yeah it  
looks pretty selfmade right and it looks 
totally unique it's not like there's lots  
of them around this is the one that looks like 
this yeah yeah I think he's selfmade he's an  
engineer yeah wow excuse me did you built this 
did you build this yeah oh good job good job  
oh what a unique vehicle here so he has one 
accelerator and then one brake brake a three  
what is this one like the shift the gears 
you doesn't me shift the gear again I don't
know wow what a we I wonder if this is like 
properly registered and legally allowed to  
drive here you know think so if you know let us 
know in the comments oh he has license plate how  
has a license plate let me have a look at 
the license plate ah oh oh oh yeah there's  
a yellow license plate whatever yellow means here 
in the Philippines wow oh this going to be bumping
out everybody is so kind every was waving and 
smelling yeah you're right that's that's the  
Filipino Vibes so I think in theory you can fit 
two more people or even three maybe standing  
there in the back and then you can fit maybe one 
one more inside here yeah and maybe maybe a baby  
in your arms maybe a baby in your arms is that 
a hint for your family situation coming soon  
coming soon you can build one of this to right oh 
what's happening now we have problem do we have a  
problem okay break break break break I took The 
Brak off Lamborghini no stopping now Lamborghini
lambor great but not breaking down it 
didn't break broke down no no he was  
tightening The Brak tell me about 
the break okay okay Canada Canada
Germany thank you thank you it's so crazy I've 
heard the phrase welcome to the Philippines  
probably already 10 times today yeah people are 
so welcoming here everybody is an ambassador  
for tourism like everyone in the street is trying 
to promote a good image of so friendly people oh
making a Kickstart here Lamborghini
Lamborghini if this is a Lamborghini Lamborghini 
he's reving it up okay now we are taking this one  
to the main road here oh gosh oh gosh we're 
actually passing through the Chinatown of  
mandila now you can see all the dragons here 
by the side of the road and many Chinese shops  
around here Chinese restaurants many of the 
shops here have Chinese characters written on  
it and I think if I remember correctly this is 
the oldest China Town in the world actually okay  
I'm actually wondering how fast you can get 
with this vehicle I don't think we're going  
to break any speed records with this what do 
you think is the maximum speed uh maybe like  
20 km an hour yeah it's not really that 
fast right how fast can you go how fast  
like there's just speed maximum speed because 
like there's no how do you call that display  
to show the speed speedometer how fast can you 
go no no okay because there's no display here  
so you can't see how fast you are you can't see 
how much fuel you have left all of the things  
you can usually see in the car yeah it's just 
nothing here it is running with fuel right it  
is a proper motor yeah yeah it must be running 
with yeah but how do you know when it's empty  
another good question so after every ride 
you have to uh look inside how much fuel is
left
wow hello
hello almost I never shook hands on the highway 
before all right so this is actually a part of  
the town where I also have never been to before 
so we're exploring a bit of a new area now hello  
hello wow Salam that was very nice that was a 
fun ride I got to show you the vehicle properly  
from the outside so have a look at this vehicle 
what a unique ride this is wow and he has like a  
like a motor here looks like a I don't know how 
to call this but it doesn't really look like a  
motor for a car yeah not at all right not at all 
wow almost looks like the same motor where they  
put they put sugarcane inside and the sugared up 
you he was asking for 200 but let's pay him 300  
yeah EAS hey it's okay you Salam thank you very 
much have a good day byebye are you hungry again  
I'm hungry we ready for more food right ready 
for a burger ready for a burger minute burger  
right here by the streets oh I could go for a 
delicious burger right now let's see what they  
have here hello hello is this a Mas up Burger 
yes Mas up yummy yummy yummy which Burger can  
you recommend all Burg is yummy all Burger is 
yummy I think it says buy one take one buy one  
take one so maybe you get one 43 pesos and you 
get two burgers I think so yes take one why want  
take one yes for all the burgers yes oh wow that 
sounds pretty affordable best deal I've ever heard
of shout out shout out thank you did you 
say hello K did right oh we actually also  
have bigger Burgers here black pepper Burger 
vegie chicken beef shama I think I'm going  
with the with the classical minute burger 
can I get a minute burger one so I get two  
right okay what do you want can I have the 
the crispy chicken burger I take one I want  
take one you want water as well sure good idea 
Sweet Water okay free water please okay so he  
has the burger patties over there in the 
freezer and then he's putting them on the  
Little Grill here all right now he's putting 
the the Buns on there as well to grill them a  
little bit as well oh slicing them open this 
is my burger already so he was wrapping the  
burger in the paper here can you ask him 
how many burgers he sells in one day I'm
curious but it looks like he's selling a lot 
because since we are here like people are ordering  
there's always buy one take one so it's always 
two burgers with one order so I guess like he  
must have a high turnover of burgers here 100 pie 
estimated 100 pieces per day so 50 orders or 100  
orders 50 orders 50 orders so 100 burgers one yeah 
yeah right but I see the burger shop over there  
has the same right Enemy enemy enemy let's call 
it competition not enemy but yeah there's another  
burger place across the road and I can read from 
here buy one take one it's the same concept crispy  
chicken burger so that's your order and that's my 
order let's see what we have here so as expected  
to be on it the burger are rather small but I 
mean you get two for one so I think that's okay  
and then then what we having here is just a very 
basic burger oh interesting looking sauce looks  
like a like a pink sauce almost yeah and then we 
have a thin Petty right here and that's it already  
so very basic Burger but I mean this is now like 
40 cents US 22 pesos for one Burger so you can't  
expect a lot of course right but what's more 
important is the Taste actually I'm curious what  
is the sauce the sauce mayo and ketchup combined 
Mayo are combined that's makes sense ketchup is  
red Mayo is right you combine it looks like this 
makes sense it's actually a good idea yeah okay  
let's give it a try I have a good feeling I think 
it'll be very yummy be honest it's better than I
expected of course this is not 
the best burger I ever had I  
mean you can't really expect a lot from 
a burger that cost less than 50 cents uhh
but actually the tast is fine yeah good yeah 
the quick snack by the side of the road you  
can one that we a p yeah I think it's good and 
honestly very popular since we've been here he  
sold 10 Burgers I think exactly it's good food 
for on the go and Iana got the uh chicken burger  
this one's highly recommended by the different 
sauce ladies out front on the picture out front  
it's got a lot of lettuce and it looks kind of 
beautiful this one looks very simple inside but  
you can't go wrong for slightly more than the 
beef I think this one's 40 Cent each this one  
even has salet on it tiny bit of lettuce yeah 
different sauce I think onion and lettuce I  
think mhm can't go wrong tasty or yeah very good 
you are North American you know your burger I was  
going to say I'm a million miles from home and 
I'm eating a cheap Burger feels very familiar  
to me actually it's good you can't go wrong for 
the price it's good good for the valum okay 187
187 a little bit talog a little bit Tagalog 
Mao po I know that 187 sir 187 200 is okay  
no change thank you sir thank you Sal thank you 
very much Sal byebye you actually we still have  
the banana left from earlier excuse me you want 
banana okay have a good day and as we enter the  
metro station there's another burger place here 
selling buy one take one Burgers so that seems  
to be the thing here and yeah we're going to 
another place now and one of the best spots I  
can show you today a very famous place in in 
Manila here un Avenue three oh and the train  
is right here that's ideal I filmed the the 
metro in my first day video here and then in  
the comments everyone told me you went into the 
female section so I did this mistake in one of my  
previous videos thanks to you guys in the comment 
section I I know now but there's a female section
here okay I feel like the energy of my tour group 
is going down everyone is a bit tired of walking  
around in the heat yeah so I know exactly what 
we need now to bring up the energy so this is  
the resal park one of the top recommendations 
from Magic AI as well a big Park basically in  
the center of Manila there's a huge flag over 
there Filipino flag there's a water show here  
in the evenings with the fountains and just a 
little bit of a quiet area after the markets

sold in the streets but very delicious very good  
all right and now it's almost sunset time I'm not 
sure going to be lucky for Sunset because it is a  
bit cloudy but we are heading to a place that in 
theory at least is very good for Sunset so I have  
one more place to show you today listen Ken so far 
it's been a very good tour am I a good tour guide  
so far absolutely five stars five stars even got 
the national team jersey on looking like a true
Filipino oh check it out we have some very 
old classical German cars here Mercedes BMW  
these were very classical German cars in 
like the early '90s when I was a little  
boy wow oh I wonder what they are doing here 
I mean obviously they're not really in use
anymore I remember my granddad used to have 
exactly this car when I was a child like even the  
same color the same model look like a little bit 
of childhood memory here for me cruising around  
with my grandpa and exactly this car oh well but 
the one for my grandpa looked a little bit better  
not like with broken lights and everything okay 
so we had a lot of street food today yeah but the  
last stop is going to be a proper restaurant but 
we're going to try more delicious Filipino food  
okay so we have the Harbor View Restaurant here 
which actually is another recommendation from  
Magic AI I was asking magic AI earlier what is 
a good restaurant in Manila to watch the sunset  
and this is the place that got recommended but 
yeah let's see if we are actually lucky Sunset  
should be in about an hour whatever Turtle here 
oh I guess the turtle is not on the menu though  
I've had Turtle sou really yeah which country in 
Jakarta chinat Chinatown Jakarta had turtle soup  
it was pretty good actually really oh I never 
knew that you can actually eat turtles but wow  
have a look at this restaurant here nice view 
over the ocean what a place to have delicious  
Filipino food and this does indeed look very nice 
and your Sunset is right over there this feels  
good now sitting down after walking around the 
town for a few hours so you never really tried  
proper Filipino food yet right what have you 
heard about Filipino food so far uh it's not  
the most wellknown food internationally famous 
yeah I definitely know balut yeah which is it's  
like a challenge of if you can eat it or will 
you be sick so maybe not the best advertising  
for Filipino food but I'm sure there's some good 
recipes here yeah so what I can recommend one  
of my favorite things to eat here is Leon which 
is pork so I think we should order one of these  
just for you to have it to try okay then one L 
Chan cavali and then one chicken adobo chicken  
only on chicken pork adobo oh you can mix oh you 
mix it okay then we mix it thank you thank you I  
like your shirt sir oh thank you I like my thank 
you all right so we have beer Cheers Cheers have  
you tried this beer before yeah very popular 
beer in the Philippines and actually I think  
my favorite beer in the world really and saying 
that as a German wow I really like I really like  
s Migel yeah saying it as a German is no joke 
how do you say cheers in Te uh Cay I think Cai  
Cai I think they say Cay yeah all right Cai Kai 
Kai all right all right and you remember earlier  
today I already told you that magic AI can also 
summarize reviews for you and earlier when I found  
this restaurant on Magic I was reading through 
the reviews so for example foodie Paradise food  
especially the seafood is highly praised by many 
visitors and then for view goals the restaurant  
offers a stunning view perfect for distracting 
your date from any questionable jewelry choice  
so it's a little bit of fun as well that's funny 
in the reviews and then a review about the service  
speed some visitors mention slower service so if 
you're in a rush this might not be your speed so  
actually also pretty helpful for getting insights 
of the reviews of a place yeah it's a useful thing  
it really is yeah so the speed review I think we 
not on Rush so no I don't really mind the speed  
yeah so far he has been very uh Speedy with the 
drinks so maybe we prove that Comet already wrong  
all right Del now we have a big bowl of rice 
and this one is the sauce if you like for the  
Leon for the Leon okay then we have the pork and 
chicken adobo here with a bright garlic on top  
what is more popular in the Philippines Leon or 
adobo adobo adobo is more popular adobo okay okay  
what's your favorite I like noodles noodles yeah 
okay long life pet p p noodles are very popular  
long life yeah noodles for long life noodles for 
long life all right so after all the sweet food  
today now you also have a proper Filipino meal 
and we are sharing everything like Asians in  
Germany and Canada everyone orders their own 
meal but in Asia you just order and everyone  
shares and I guess in Philippines they don't use 
chopsticks yeah do they eat with their hand uh I  
don't think Filipinos eat with their hands no no I 
don't think so how about eating rice with pork or  
spoon I guess with spoon as well with spoon but uh 
in Canada and in Germany we eat rice with with the
F the adobo is very good yeah so the Leon is 
pretty familiar yeah you've tried it in another  
country similar something similar to that but 
Theo's got a really nice flavor into it uh that  
dark color looks so yummy right quite good yeah 
yeah I agree adobo is one of my favorite dishes  
in the Philippines definitely so this one right 
here tastes almost like like a Gravy Sauce right  
you know when you eat a steak back home and then 
know the thick Gravy Sauce similar to that and  
it's chicken and pork combined yeah it's quite 
yummy M big F although today honestly nothing  
can beat cheese ice cream burger cre burger and 
then you lots of garlic on top as well it also  
adds a lot of flavors to it and then the lean 
right here with the crispy skin which I really  
like yeah so crispy but I think out of these two 
now I would prefer the adobo the adobo is better  
than the Leon here mhm yeah same thank you so much
