Hey guys! This is Jessica! Welcome to my channel! (In Tagalog)
Today's video is going to be about
trying a famous Filipino delicacy
which is also a food that my titas (aunties)
urge me to try it with my friends!
Therefore, I've invited
Hey guys! This is Johnson! (In Tagalog)
Do you have any idea on what we're going to try?
Something Filipino?
Are you nervous?
Kind of...... kind of.......
Before we try the food,
let me tell you some information about it
It is a VERY VERY VERY
Good food
Because it has so much protein
It packed with Vitamin C and carotene
Is that something like insect?
No, it's not insect
But remember,
Don't judge a book by its cover
It may not looks pretty on the outside
But it tastes extremely delicious
Oh I know, just like you!
Just like you!
You!
No, just like you!
Let's welcome the food!
I'm so nervous!
I've just tried this food once in my life
This is the second time I try
And I tried it in......
Philippines?
when I was in primary three
Long time ago......
I'm so excited!
Maybe you open it yourself
Let me just smell it first
What is this?
Is it an egg?
Yes, it's egg
I don't wanna eat egg
It got so much protein inside
and it's called "Balut"
Before you try, let me tell you what is Balut
Balut is a very popular, famous and delicious street food from the Philippines
It's actually a duck egg
I don't wanna eat duck egg
And it's a.....
I really don't wanna try it
It's so yummy!
I don't want......
Just try it! It's a fertilized egg and.....
It a street food that everyone eats
I will try it first
Let's do it together
I remember the taste is just like a random chicken egg
But it so curel!
Killing a bird.....
It's just the same when you eat the normal chicken
No, they are not fertilized
The normal chicken isn't fertilized?!
Let me just smell it
I didn't judge it from the cover
It's moving!
It is moving!
The duck is moving!
Do you wanna open it together?
Try it!
You cannot see a duck inside
There's no duck
Nothing happened
I wanna throw up
I can't live in Philippines.....
Take a sip of the soup
I know what is it
It tastes like protein shake
Can I have some water?
It's actually taste like protein shake,
and mixed with some oysters
mixed with some egg yolk
I wanna cry
What did I do wrong?
I'm gonna try the egg yolk
Bless you
You are Hong Kong Mulan
How does it taste?
It's tasteless
I don't trust you
It tastes like oysters
And the texture is thick and creamy
Shall we do the ending now ?
At least you try the egg yolk
Not the embryo
Please don't let me try it
Give me a sec
Cheers to our friendship
Cheers
The yolk tastes better!
I told you!
Better than the soup
It just taste like random egg yolk
It tastes better than it smells
I think so
I think it tastes like egg yolk
Are we about to end the video?
Do you remember the name of this egg?
Lemme give you some time to think about three words to describe Balut
Do you wanna try some more Filipino food in the future?
Or do you want to go to the Philippines?
I think I will, but not to try balut again
I wanna try something that is more delicious
I think it's like durian
Thank you Johnson
You're such a good friend of mine
Do I get paid?
One more balut is your reward
(Keep Watching! Behind the scenes at the end!)
