Is it your first time to try
a filipino dessert? Yes.

How is it Iván? Did you like it?
A bit strange?
Is it strange for you?
 
 
It seems like...
like a japanese dessert, like mochi
they taste the same
me too, I think the same way
so have you already tried the japanese mochi?
it's got the same texture, right?
And how is it?
From 1-10
 
 
Sometimes they put cheese on it.
well, it depends on the person

You can try and if you don´t like then do not finish it.
That one, I will give it a 7 out of 10
It was delicious.
Let´s see if you will like this.
How do you call this?

coconut powder
 
 
I thought there was a specific word for it.
I am going to put it on top of it.
this too is so sticky
colour orange with coconut
 
Look at this
Well, it is not so sweet.
No.
This isn´t.
 
 
 
It is liked a mixed of gelatine and quince paste
 
Well, that is true.
Quince paste is sweet.
 
This one is better. I ´d say the same.

In the Philippines a lot of food are made of coconut
because it is a tropical country.
 
It is hard to open the drink
