hello everyone
chris kusinero here
how is everyone?
hoping everyone are okay
we are cooking today for peter taylor
 
on his 21st birthday
oh really?
 
so peter's birthday today
and we are cooking
some Filipino food
and this is for our friendship
so lets go
lets cook
no more talking.....
 
 
so let us start with cooking oil
first the potato
they are a little bit hard so i started with this
aldente and brown it a little bit
flip them on the other side
 
then add the carrots, they are a little bit hard too
same, just browning it burnt a little bit
to give some aroma in our dish for today
the afritada
then add the chicken
same wok
remember
the way you cook your dishes
depends on your taste
and on your own way
mother and grand mothers techniques
right?
whatever moms cook for you
and you grow up with that dish
it is going to be your special dish for life
even there are some
famous and delicious meal around
made by famous chef or celebrities
moms special dish
that your eating since you dont remember
food that created with love cook with love
thats the special dish that we will always looking for
even we get old
moms dishes will always be the best meal
because
 
those cuisines
are the special moms made for us
 
 
then lets add some tomato sauce
so red
then bay leaf
some
mix it a little
you can add some
enhance your dish
you can add any veggies you want if you like it
lots of veggies there in the Philippines
or add some chilies
your own style
caldereta style
add liver spread or some cheese
whatever you want to add
it is on your own way on how to make a good dish
remember that
it is you who will make it
delicious and different from others
discovering your own dish
your own style
of food
so it is cooked
just add bell peppers and green peas
and ready to serve
our chicken afritada
i also prepare some Pinoy fried chicken
my version of fried chicken
first
boil the legs and thigh
there
 
 
to cook the chicken
and the blood from it
i dont like it
when cooking fried chicken
with blood in their bones
 
so this way i am sure
no more blood for my chicken
just fry it
just like that
simple
so simple my friends
