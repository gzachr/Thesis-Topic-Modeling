welcome back to pinoy planet magandang 
tanghale po sa inyong lahat my name is  
joey I cook and eat Filipino food and i 
travel the Philippines if you want to see  
more Filipino food videos please hit the 
subscribe button now let's start cooking
so let's start with making the uh filling for 
the fish okay just moving the barbecue aside  
i have some beautiful ingredients here so i'm 
just going to start with uh cutting some onions
so i guess i just need to cut these in small cubes 
for the filling we're going to make a delicious  
inihaw na isda next i'll 
use uh some bawang as well
and i'm very curious what uh filling you would 
use for inihaw na isda and today we're going to  
uh grill these fish on the barbecue 
on the charcoal just cut it like that  
now in the philippines i often see that they use 
tomatoes so i'm also going to use tomatoes today
how do you actually call tomato in Tagalog 
i also like to use some spring onions
very nice fresh spring onions
more flavor a bit of soy sauce
not too much because i will also add some salt 
on the fish later on okay maybe just like that  
pogi is chilling there
i will add konting black pepper and then 
i'll just mix everything with a spoon  
so there's a white onions tomatoes garlic 
spring onions black pepper and soy sauce okay  
we're gonna set this aside so 
it's time to put the barbecue here  
i went to the fish market yesterday to get 
a beautiful fish so i have a fresh mackerel  
okay and also this one i'm 
not sure the english name  
i have to look it up but it's really 
nice on the barbecue they said
mackerel and this one i'm gonna 
try and turn on this barbecue  
in the meantime i'll show you also uh some other 
fish that i bought hipon and tuna burgers and i  
made another dish yesterday so please enjoy 
this one and i'll see you in a second okay
okay
they have lots of fresh fish here
shrimp set up  
so let's drizzle some olive oil
tiny hipon  
oh they smell amazing so i don't think these 
should be baked so long so i'm gonna turn them
let's also have a look at the tuna 
burgers those are really tasty as well
mini tuna burgers mmm these smell so good as well
so
let's flip over the burgers
i'll combine this dish with 
some kimchi korean kimchi naman
and some mayonnaise
there we go rice and seafood platter it has 
a tuna burger some kimchi rice and hipon  
it is really masarap so this burger is a 
little bit on the dry side and the salty side  
maybe i bake it a little bit too long 
but that's why i put some mayonnaise
but very flavorful nice with the rice
and kimchi
and these shrimps
they're really good they're really 
good they have a very good flavor
and set up two yummy fishes okay 
let's hope this will work out guys
i guess the charcoal was not so strong i 
may i was able to make a fire but take a  
very long time to get hot so they are gray 
but not white so let's hope it will work
i guess we have to be very patient now i 
remember the name of tomato it's kamatis diba  
so i also have some banana leaves here i think 
you put ini how on uh roasted banana leaves dipa  
so after the fish is done i'll 
roast these for a little while  
and we're gonna serve it with rice it's 
nice because now you can hear the sounds
you see i put the sibuyas and kamatis very 
flavorful so i still don't know how you call  
this fish in english in dutch we say forel 
okay i'm gonna carefully flip over one fish  
to see how it looks i don't think it's cooked 
yet but yes yeah it needs a little bit longer  
but it's it's going there we'll get there just 
roast them a little bit i flipped over this fish  
it looks pretty good it's cooked on one side but 
the other one doesn't listen this fish doesn't  
want to listen because when i flip it the skin 
will come off so it looks like really cooked  
underneath but carefully i'm gonna try to 
flip it over okay you see the skin came up  
but it smells great and i think it's cooked really 
well so i'm adding a little bit of oil on the fish
okay maybe i'll flip them over one more time
before we can serve with rice so with the hot 
rice let's try the filipino way kamayan style
whoa set it up
this one is really good 
let's also try the mackerel  
it got that really um that inihaw flavor i hope

some filipino ice cream diba so next time i'll
