As soon as I brought this into the car. 
I'm like oh my god this smells delicious
Look at this, Look at this
Hello friends we're trying some Filipino food  
um which is in Maryland Heights I believe that's 
the place in St Louis very very friendly teacher  
at the counter trying to give me suggestions and 
figuring out what to eat so I'm gonna try some  
they just they said that they're just trying this 
now so it's beef Kaldereta now you guys know I  
don't typically eat beef and I'll probably regret 
this later I'm like you know what they didn't have  
any chicken they were all bought out by the time I 
got there I got there just before noon while I was  
sitting there the line stretched outside out the 
door so if you're ever gonna go plan accordingly
oh that's good just enough spice just enough 
to tickle your tongue you guys know I don't  
typically eat beef they ran out of chicken so I 
didn't really have any other options they got peas  
got your carrots I'm not really into 
olives so I probably won't eat that but
MMM MMM
Now what was that taste that was an interesting 
taste I don't know what that was I've always  
not been the biggest fan of like soups because a 
lot of brothy soups I should say because there's  
a like I don't know it's nice when you're 
sick but other than that maybe that's just  
what I associate it with maybe it's just 
I associate it with being sick outside of  
being sick I don't really do a whole lot of 
soups but I could probably do that like the  
actual Soup part of this any day so it's very 
flavorful
oh that was hot there is peppers in it a whole pepper corn I don't really like that but that's okay
it's so good I don't want to stop eating it but I have to try the other oh y'all know that I love food and I love to try different foods
every time
I'm reviewing a series or something and they have 
some interesting food in it I'm just like I want  
to try that give me the opportunity and I will 
try it I just like food food and music Universal  
languages that we could all just like come 
together with I don't really understand people who  
like disrespect foods from other places I'm like 
I want to try that **** give me a chance try  
the beef Now reminder I don't typically eat beef 
anymore we'll see how my tummy handles it later
mm got a pepper beef is well done melts in the 
mouth basically I love it when a soup  
or anything can make my mouth go or make 
my nostrils start *sniff* dripping a little bit  
it's just so flavorful now that my taste 
buds got have gotten used to the base now  
I'm starting to explore some of the other 
flavors and there's just enough spice  
to uh to tickle my tongue but in particular it's 
tickling back here
the only thing that I don't personally like and this is just me being a picky little person I don't like biting into peppercorns  
like even even when I make stuff like I have to 
ground that stuff basically to a powder I don't  
know I've just never enjoyed that since I was a 
kid and maybe it was just because like I grew up  
in a very Italian area Italian families immigrated 
it is either Italian or Irish a lot of the time or  
German of course you know we had Amish where I 
live lived and uh a lot of Italian restaurants  
some of the best that I've ever had because 
they actually cared about their ingredients  
I've lived in a lot of places now still some of my 
favorite to go back to and sometimes in the subs  
you would just bite down into a whole peppercorn 
cold peppercorn in the salon I don't even know what it is
 then the salami or whatever they use 
and uh and I would just be like OH like it would just not be good
 it's just more of a me thing yes 
so great I love it I was gonna get chicken adobo  
just because I like chicken and and it's what I 
eat the most if I'm gonna eat protein an animal product
but like I said they didn't have any 
more so just is what it is so the second thing  
that they suggested was pork barbecue again pork 
I don't eat pork but when in Rome
[Music]
Oh smells good my stomach is really not going to like me after this telling you guys that right now
tonight is not going to be a good night for me
good flavor smoked clearly 
made with fire this is amazing
the barbecue that they're using it's not 
too sweet one of the things I don't like  
about pork in general in a very general sense 
is the fat the barbecue sauce is pretty thick  
it's very good I like it a lot I don't 
know what this is but I'm gonna try it
well combined mm that's actually very good I think there's 
pork in here as well but that's okay 
 I do typically like spring rolls and egg rolls 
and all of that 
that's not surprising that I would like these
I like it with this 
whatever the sauce is though too got a good crunch to them
I could eat that stuff 
all day
for the last bit Sapin-sapin
Look at this, look at this
oh! I can smell the coconut
I've never had Ube so cheers
I like it 
it's a bit more gelatinous than I had anticipated and I don't hate it
usually, I'm a texture. like there 
are certain textures that I don't necessarily like
like shrimp I hate shrimp I can't do shrimp 
the texture of shrimp destroys me I can barely  
do Lobster and crab and only a little bit so 
like texture can be a weird thing for me and  
this is definitely a different texture than I've 
probably experienced before but I don't hate it  
I'm not sure what this orange stuff is
aerate it, warm it up
but it has this familiarity to it that I'm not sure it's like taking me back to my childhood but I don't know from what
I don't like coconut by itself actually I don't mind like the taste by itself or mixed in with others and so you can definitely taste the coconut and I like it
and the flakes that they put up here on the top definitely add a textural difference to it and I like that as well
it's really good
I want more of it honestly this was a Shawn 
eating Filipino food vlog
if you guys like this let me know
I'll do more of this and I love 
food culturally diverse food food that I've never had before
and I would love to try them in the 
actual places that they're at but you know I'm not a rich guy
anyways guys if you like this 
let me know and uh we will do more
BYE!
