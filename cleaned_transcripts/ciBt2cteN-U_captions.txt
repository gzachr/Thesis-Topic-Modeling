foreign
good morning everyone good morning we are saying 
hi to you from the beautiful el nido and you know  
it's amazing oh my god we fall in love when we 
arrive here with el nido it's amazing yeah except  
this the prices yeah the the prices and the taxi 
drivers are not fair yeah even with local prices  
they ask double or something but it's you can 
you have the option to rent a scooter which is  
way more cheaper and yeah it gives you freedom 
especially if you stay longer yeah like we always  
take even for one day two days i think it's okay 
if you plan to travel yeah yeah to check the city  
eat uh the restaurants and yeah then definitely 
better renting but other than that yeah we love  
it finally this is the vibe we are looking for 
here island by the way yeah it's amazing the  
philippines yeah philippines exactly what we are 
searching for yeah yeah so we have orange first  
tour for today yeah for which we paid eleven 
thousand pesos yeah eleven thousand pesos 150  
maybe two hundred and twenty dollars yeah 
two hundred twenty dollars it's double
yeah we'll see about here how long it will take 
yeah and we'll see how it goes yeah i mean guys  
they have four tours but we did our customized 
customized so yeah a bit customized because we  
want to go not in so many popular places we want 
to go in even though exactly they will go today  
i mean these are the places yeah these 
are devices today we're basically making  
a but not complete and plus uh something extra 
yeah yeah we'll update you while yeah we get  
there but the thing is these are the places the 
most beautiful but hopefully tomorrow or the next  
days we'll do something a bit different yeah than 
the person what is this private tool for us gives  
us freedom to say how much we want in a place to 
can feel to can show all the beautiful places so  
this is amazing for the freedom you know you were 
confused by the smell yeah yeah i was confused  
i was thinking smell engine because we had our 
problem we didn't film because uh was like that  
film you know but we had some problem with 
our boat some water goes inside and we need  
to stop to take the water out and continue 
and the smell is you said they are doing some  
yeah barbecue nothing interesting to see yeah 
they just do some chicken some barbecue yeah on  
the boat so oh my god nothing really exciting 
but we are the first location big dragon big  
lagoon and they uh we will take a kayak yeah a 
small cake to go inside inside and see explore  
it's beautiful but it's so popular it's yeah yeah 
way too crowded for our face yeah yeah yeah well  
both men said that it's always that crowded 
so yeah yeah because we plan to come after  
but no no no which i don't believe it it's too big 
no because there's no logic in this because if the  
all the tours they start in the morning you know 
oh with big black ones yeah nobody comes here to  
three or four o'clock in the afternoon yeah 
maybe so yeah sure yeah so so let's go baby  
and take a kayak and with the gopro the quality 
of image will not be so good attention please
so yeah let's go let's see what we can 
do all right baby so we are on oh my god  
omg we got our speed we never did 
these guys before the ocean is rough  
and we are just 12 months oh 
my god i don't know how to see
but it's good nothing to worry about no he 
said okay the the guy from the ball said  
vlad first but i said why blood first 
because he is a driver but since when  
jasmine are the driver i say ah he is professional
so if you are men if you have peanuts you 
should drive so guys learn how to drive
oh my god we are not good here here is beautiful

well like he helped me because i'm ruby
so he's in hell i am in heaven 
guys wow how cool is this what
omg guys this is amazing oh a sun
another accident another water comes 
in our boat forward and the water  
uh the color of water is changing from 
turquoise to blue if you can see guys there  
omg this is so cool the water level here it's not 
that big and yeah it's nice so a tip for girls

sorry about him but so happy for me because i
this is something girls guys this 
is now this is heaven how cool is it

you are so happy very happy oh my god
and we almost hit this rock
beautiful and here is the end guys so 
just that was but i mean these rocks  
how you call them baby because i forgot cleaves 
these cleaves this cliffs and everything
we just arrived we are here secret lagoon
famous secret lagoon yeah it's beautiful not so 
secret anymore let me show you yeah yeah yeah  
this is it sometimes yeah sometimes maybe 
secrets sometimes maybe not sometimes  
maybe not but maybe that's why it's secret 
because it has that pool on top you know baby
yeah bud which pool is there one baby oh there i 
think huh there somewhere on top on top you know  
on top on top and how do you get there with the 
drone with a drone only with the drone yeah oh  
let's see here where are those guys is 
that over the cliff where those guys are
you say okay yeah i think you 
have to swim yeah your way
down there maybe then why i saw the image that is 
uh maybe i just think it's on top i just stopped
i mean
but you can't send the drone from here you know 
yeah i think that will do yeah it will be easier  
maybe you look so funny with your clothes normal 
clothes all wet yeah all right yeah because the  
water level was so deep so this is secret lagoon
what do you guys think
it's beautiful baby it is it is amazing 
here and all this vegetation on top yeah
we are surrounded by vertical 
rocks there cliffs all over
did you see just in 3d you 
know animations yeah animations

absolutely breathtaking yeah yeah beautiful 
baby definitely worth it so far definitely yeah
yeah we had lunch good lunch good lunch they 
cook it down the boat yeah we've had the same  
barbecue yeah yeah and now we are here finally 
to a small beach where no one else is here
this is good yeah we love it so let's 
see babe what what's on the offer  
what property we find here to buy to build a 
house what do you think babe it's beautiful  
yeah babe i like it yeah but it's 
rocky yeah yeah it's rocky this  
rocks and also some coral some yeah yeah 
yeah yeah yeah this might be the reason why  
yeah yeah nobody don't stop here yeah you 
don't come no no we don't mind obviously
what you cannot do you cannot jump in the water 
ah because these rocks are wrong you cannot dive  
yeah why i don't know and you cannot catch the 
turtle oh you cannot catch them oh that's not okay
no littering no feeding the fish 
no gloves okay no gloves though
so we are devastated guys because we brought  
100 pairs of gloves with us yeah with us and 
we want to catch a turtle yeah to wear them  
on this beach and no we cannot we cannot 
wear them this is this is what's happening  
when you don't do your research yeah do your 
own research yeah don't don't be like us no
there's the ocean guys that's our boat yeah 
just us and the the big rock baby how cool it  
looks oh my god this let huge show you these guys 
like everywhere here yeah you are surrounded by  
rocks big vertical rocks yeah this is why it's 
so spectacular here yeah sure this is nice  
guys this beach is amazing for a photo session 
yeah i reckon you come here i'm trying to do a  
photo session here yeah no one else will disturb 
you and you have so beautiful view yeah you do
look here it's amazing it is okay this one 
yeah this is more interesting i would say  
yeah oh it's so big you could 
climb babe wait oh no way why  
maybe i don't know maybe you can find a snake or 
something oh my god up there for a snake i run  
go and search it okay so guys this is 
uh we we don't know we know his name  
and in tallulah west and yeah but yeah 
my heavenly mind i don't know yeah
so this is here
a nice beach small but spectacular yeah 
wow i love the water it's so warm uh-huh
the water is warmer than in our shower
guys i believe we'll see you see you in 
the next uh destination yeah next part oh  
this is beautiful baby yeah this is like sweet 
jungle i love all this vegetation on the rocks  
yeah look at that rock here wow these trees are 
so beautiful everything here is so so spectacular
is
all right
we are back
so another famous shop on el nido stores is the 
snake yeah but unfortunately today is not snake  
we are dealing with a drone 
snake yeah drawn in water because  
this is where it starts this is 
the head and then it goes yeah  
yeah so there is no snakes on this island it's 
a name like that because it has a snake shape  
yeah it's a descent yeah this built here like 
can multiple s yeah yeah but unfortunately  
because now it's high tide it's almost all of it 
covered in water so yeah not much we can see no
and there's more people
ah do some snorkeling yeah others seems like 
and another tour is coming yeah another boat  
look at that dog i don't know guys if you can 
see him almost on the other side i believe he's  
the dog that belongs to these guys here yeah 
i mean there are people here i don't know is  
they stay here permanently or just during the 
day so they can sell drinks and who knows baby  
what not here oh this is not enjoyable at all 
yeah i mean our boat guy told us that we should  
come here at 6 or 7 pm for the low tide yeah so i 
mean i don't know babe what do you say shouldn't
they have told us yesterday 
before i think they should bomb  
because there's a reason why you come here it 
happens with this communication all the time  
with both with tour with organization yeah 
with the two operators every time we was
what is worth it you know because 
look guys this is not worth it  
this is not worth it because you cannot go if 
you know yeah that if there's high tide yeah  
you should tell the people yeah yeah there's no 
point in coming here no no no at toward this hour  
yeah or this hour or avoid this one if uh yeah if 
you want to see it's the full potential yeah yeah  
you should be here at 6 00 p.m yeah yeah yeah so 
then arrange something yeah for 6 p.m for this  
like they are all good taking the money yeah but 
services are like crap yeah so yeah there's that  
but babe looks like the dog is not your friend 
no he's running from you he don't want to be  
my friend baby now guys i believe you can see 
more clear here yeah the snake the snake so babe  
how do you rate oh this snack maybe for the 
evening i was eighteen out of ten but for now it's  
nine out of ten nine oh still good it's 
still good because the view yeah and  
everything it's beautiful what about you baby 
yeah i don't know tell me i didn't see it yeah  
in a little choice so that's definitely i saw 
it just in pictures on the internet okay but  
you know you don't know exactly how no no i don't 
know how it looks but yeah as of now i don't know  
i give it like a five a five yeah yeah no snake 
you will not come back here no imagine how cool  
is this to visit in the evening when the sun is 
uh exactly for the sunset and then you have it  
all available yeah then you can 
yeah really enjoy it enjoy it and  
but still the scenery is breathtaking yeah uh-huh 
so definitely worth coming in no matter what time  
of the day no no no no no you're still amazing 
here it is it is baby okay so i don't know if  
our tour uh our boatman is taking us somewhere 
else i need to deal with him because it's just  
three and we anyway we left at 9 40 the boat was 
broken we maybe we left at 10 something like that  
and we should have seven hours something at 
least at least seven hours so you pay 220 dollars  
guys by the way yeah we are not not happy at all 
with this it's not worth it private yeah it's not  
worth it so yeah don't pay for it especially 
nowadays if you go you can still enjoy it  
you know there won't be many people no they won't 
fill up boats no no they're not enough tourists  
now so maybe there's like four or six people in a 
boat and you pay like the normal price yeah right  
yeah which is about one thousand i don't know one 
thousand two hundred yeah some two hundred some  
three some four yeah but um what gives you 
the privacy it gives you the time where you  
can tell the both men where to stop where to how 
much time to stay you know this is but you don't  
need no but you can how long how long to wait for 
you but not really where to stop because we were  
dealing with dealt with them something else 
yesterday yeah yeah yeah and now today yeah they  
just brought us to that uh small beach ah because 
we we said like uh to go there to and candalula  
beach yeah and they brought us to western candela 
something the beach was nice it was yeah but  
not enough yeah not not like the other one 
yeah you know exactly and not enough for the  
money we spend here and lula in tallulah so we 
went we didn't went to entalula beach but we  
went here in tallulah west yeah anyway yeah 
so unfortunately yeah for us two operators  
private especially they are not worth it in 
every country it's not about just philippines  
it's about every country it's it's not worth 
it this is the first country where we took  
but we took with the dolphins as 
well in sri lanka there was also  
yeah yeah everywhere you know with this 
tour tour operators yeah they don't make us  
happy no you don't feel it's worth the money 
you spend no no no no no but anyway yeah i mean  
guys it thinks that this money is making 
hard everybody is making money hard yeah  
i mean depends we are so yeah normally people 
may makes money hard and if you spend it yeah  
for something it's not worth it you are 
disappointed right obviously no problem  
on to the next one guys looks like we are in 
business yeah right babe back in business baby  
all right we're ending the day 
with this beautiful island wild
yeah oh yeah i can see yeah the 
crowd yeah there's some crafts there  
really wild ah there are some toilets there 
or they used to be big they used to be uh  
backing times long gone babe i was just wondering 
how many years ago did the ocean was at that level  
oh my god you see everywhere yeah yeah 
it was at that level there used to be  
the level yeah that used to be the level like 
now underneath there's another one yeah yeah
another another and now we will 
see oh my god wait this is amazing
can i fit here yeah you can this is like a lion
foot foot ah like a foot ah okay yeah like from  
sri lanka no like the sri lanka rock 
yeah sigilia yeah oh my god yeah
oh i'm in yeah well well somebody was 
here babe they drove was this yeah  
but look at that it's like 
from horror movie this stone  
is like from especially for for 
crowd cows crowds crows yeah crows
can you how cool is this it's 
black it's safe to say that uh  
it's not recommended to fall no on that rock yeah 
because you'll end up in a spike just if you are  
you had you did bad things punish 
like that but now that times when
and this is you guys small 
beach parts here spectacular
baby this is cool oh these are mussels yeah oh my 
god that's so cool it's supposed to be something  
before here baby yeah obviously but we don't know 
what i don't know yet so you guys let us know  
in the comments down below down below yeah so the 
water the level of water was still there one side  
yes oh my god this is crazy long time ago yeah 
long time ago yeah oh no so many years yeah so  
guys i believe we'll end here yeah because we will 
go to el nido yeah and uh and then we'll see what  
what other tours we will find we need to figure 
it out because yeah yeah we need to figure out  
how to deal with these people because yeah 
yeah they don't know what we are asking for  
we don't know what they they they don't care 
you know because even though you tell them  
yeah yeah then they won't care because they'll do 
like they want basically yeah yeah even though you  
pay so much money because i think they are used 
with uh with the normal tours you know exactly  
people who have no expectation no requirements 
you know even though they pay for the private  
they just okay if we are coming now tell them 
they don't know exactly what we want what  
what exactly you know because they haven't done 
it maybe before yeah but the thing is also with  
our guys from today we agree yesterday on the 
route with five stops and yeah after the snake  
island he was like okay can we go back to el nido 
and we said we need to do this island and he said  
oh maybe we will do another island near to el 
nido no it's not okay yeah since we agreed to this  
one yeah yeah and we pay extra yeah for for snake 
island and was not that far yeah which we couldn't  
see anyway because of the high child so people 
should know about this yeah and tell us okay  
don't go there because there's no point because 
you have to be there in order to enjoy it later in  
the evening i think now is the perfect time to go 
there yeah after 5 p.m anyway yeah yeah yeah so  
but yeah this is from every lessons we 
learn they learn and everybody learns  
it this is exactly this is good for 
you guys yeah yeah so anyways the the  
the landscape it's amazing it's amazing 
and breath thinking so we're definitely  
this is worth it nature is amazing people 
always sucks you know people yeah because  
nobody is perfect yeah i mean okay don't 
worry about it but nature 100 worship perfect  
and i think you guys have the same opinion 
after you saw this this amazing landscape  
it's worth it it's worth it this nature these 
philippines it's amazing el nido palawan we  
love it so we love it we love it you guys see 
in the next one yeah yeah see you take care bye
