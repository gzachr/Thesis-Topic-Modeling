- What's up, Ray-Ray.
- (screams) Oh, my God.
- Finally, how can we
make this magical voice
even more magical?
(Raymond laughs)
- I know you gonna make me works, so...
(both laughing)
(Cheryl vocalizing)
So that's for the vowels.
(both vocalizing)
You work on the vowel placement-
- Okay.
- First.
Each exercise is full of
traps , so it should not be,
(Cheryl vocalizing)
(Raymond chuckling)
Try sing it for me?
- Okay.
(both vocalizing)
- Hmm?
- Oh gosh.
(Cheryl laughing)
(Raymond vocalizing)
(Cheryl laughing)
- Oh.
- It's okay.
(Raymond laughing)
(Raymond vocalizing)
- Good job and go.
(both vocalizing)
- That's right Ray-Ray.
- Yeah.
Good job, baby.
(Raymond chuckling)
Let's do a cool one.
Start off on the chest, we go to the mix,
we go to the head and then
we go to the "falsetto",
four vocal registers.
(Cheryl vocalizing)
- So cool, right?
- Yeah.
(Cheryl vocalizing)
- It's so pretty.
(Raymond chuckling)
(Raymond vocalizing)
- Ray, be careful.
- Mm-mm.
- Oh.
- So that's not bad, not bad.
- Okay, okay.
- So when you do the
"passaggio", you wanna,
(Cheryl vocalizing)
You wanna make sure you don't
build up to the passaggio-
- Yeah, yeah.
- But you wanna like slide into it.
- Okay.
- So it becomes,
(Cheryl vocalizing)
(Raymond vocalizing)
- Sing it, Ray-Ray.
(Raymond vocalizing)
Sing it, baby.
(Raymond vocalizing)
Real nice.
(Raymond vocalizing)
It's perfection, and go.
(Raymond vocalizing)
Yes.
(Raymond vocalizing)
Be careful.
Real good, baby.
(Raymond vocalizing)
So pretty.
(Raymond vocalizing)
Yes.
(Raymond vocalizing)
Sing, Ray-Ray.
(Raymond vocalizing)
You better sing it, Ray-Ray.
(Raymond laughing)
You better sing in falsetto, come on.
(Raymond laughing)
So beautiful, I love it.
You sound so good, baby.
- Cause I knew when I was gonna come over
I was like watching your
videos and everything else.
Like, I know she gonna kick my butt.
She gonna tell me off.
(both laughing)
Was Lauren (Allred) in this car too?
- Yep.
- Oh, that's so sick.
- Loren was here.
- Oh, my God.
(both laughing)
- Now you, baby.
(Raymond chuckling)
You are in Lauren's seat.
(both laughing)
We not gonna do no runs,
we're not gonna even begin.
(Raymond laughing)
Let's keep the silence, awkward silence.
What did I tell you
yesterday about the audition?
- Yeah.
- What did I tell you?
Every second counts-
- Counts.
- On that stage.
- Okay.
- Run it, do some falsetto
but use those seconds to let them know,
"Hey man, I'm here."
Do some more runs.
(Raymond vocalizing)
Do it, Ray-ray.
(Raymond vocalizing)
Yes, right.

Baby you're a Star!
You got it.
you gotta...
We gotta do some...
Somebody better.
Hey, whoever watching this video, listen.
(both laughing)
How do you think your confidence is
as a singer, Raymond?
Honestly, how do you feel?
- Sometimes I do have those
second guesses, you know?
But I feel like throughout the years
I've definitely been coming into my own
where I've been, you know,
singing for like pretty
much a lot of my life.
Like, I wanna say 10 years,
like 10 plus years of training and stuff,
and I'm still training,
I'm still learning.
I feel like every session that
I do, I'm always improving.
- Yes.
- But sometimes, you know,
I do get hard on myself
'cause I'm such a perfectionist, you know?
- Yeah.
- It's that Virgo energy. (laughs)
- Yeah, yeah
- You a Virgo too?
- Yes, I'm a Virgo as well.
- No, we both Virgos.
- We're twinsies. (laughs)
- Perfectionist.
What's your birthday, baby?
- August 24th, so late
- I'm 28th.
- Oh, my God.
August is heart.
- Oh, yes.
When I was growing up, I wasn't a prodigy.
I mean, I wasn't one of
those kids who grew up
and everybody's like,
"Oh, my God, you're gonna
be such a great singer."
It's like I had to study really hard.
It's like nobody in my
family was in music.
Nobody in my family was a singer.
And so I didn't even have
like, support, you know.
It's like, so when I wanted
to sing my poor mother,
God bless her heart, she was like,
"Np, you're not gonna be a singer.
Like, you're going to be broke.
You ain't going find no job,
you going to be on the streets."
You know, it's just like
the worst thing, you know?
And a lot of people don't understand that
there are possibilities for people.
- Right.
- There are possibilities.
And so thank God I got a scholarship.
- Oh, yes.
- I found people who believed in me.
My teachers believed in me.
And I think that's probably,
like, the main reason
why I became a teacher
is because I wanna help
singers like myself
to realize you may not be the best
but you can become the best.
- Yes.
- You can become your own best.
- Yes, your own best.
- You know what I mean?
- Yes.
- And so, even though I
believe wholeheartedly
in vocal technique,
I want you to go out there,
don't think about the notes,
don't think about the performance.
Think about opening up your mouth
and touching those people's lives,
making them feel something,
giving them some hope,
giving them something
to believe in, Raymond.
Just like the lady that you sing for
at the senior citizen's home.
- Yes.
- You know, that's what it's all about.
So I want you to become a
better singer technically
but don't get caught up on the technique.
- Okay. (chuckles)
- You know what I mean?
- Yes, yeah.
- Get caught up on the soul.
- On the soul.
- 'Cause you got so much hard, baby.
'Cause if you get out there and
you show people who you are,
and you're vulnerable and you show them,
they all gonna fall in
love with you, baby.
(both chuckling)
Make the heart connection.
- Okay.
- The notes will come.
- Yes.
- That's why we doing the exercises.
- Mm-mm.
- They're going to be there, baby.
- Yes.
- Touch the people with your heart.
- Okay, I will, Cheryl.
- Do that, do that.
- Thank you.
- Okay, let's do another exercise, baby.
- Yes.
- Thank you.
Thank you, Ray, baby.
