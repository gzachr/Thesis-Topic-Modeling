so is manila a dangerous place do you need to be 
careful when you come here these are questions i  
find really interesting and i actually have 
a bit of insight into this let me explain
so i've been to manila i'm 
pretty sure this is my sixth time  
coming back here and i just love the place 
i've met so many amazing people you know the  
first time i came here i just honestly i fell 
in love with the place and that's why i've kept  
coming back so many times but it's funny you know 
i've never felt unsafe here and it's the place  
ironically it's the place i'm warned the most 
about but i actually feel the safest here  
so i took my first overseas trip god 20 years 
ago almost now back in 2003 and i've now i've  
been to 14 different countries but i've been 
to most of them more than once i've actually  
been on over 40 different overseas trips and 
the philippines is definitely a place i love  
coming back to i always have such a good time when 
i'm here and one of the things i love doing when  
i travel is what i'm doing today i basically i 
just go for a walk and i aimlessly walk around  
i see where i end up and just see new things 
for the first time and i always find that no  
matter where i am here in manila wherever i am 
walking through the streets people just come  
out they want to talk to you there's kids 
just appear out of nowhere and they want to  
chat to you be your friend they love youtubers 
you know they love seeing you walking around with  
the camera and they want to be on camera they 
said take a photo with me there's kids hello  
everywhere they're just so much fun 
so right now i'm in an area called  
pillow del pilar i think i have 
no idea if i'm saying that right  
but i'm just aimlessly walking 
through here just doing some exploring
this is definitely one of the things i love 
when exploring manila and walking into new  
areas that i haven't been for the first time 
the kids just all come out and they you know  
they're so friendly they want to play they want 
to chat to you those kids they were just that  
was such a laugh i had a great time i was actually 
hanging out with them for quite a while what's up
hello
so
so i was just walking along and then 
this lovely gentleman behind me i  
asked do you want to be here i said okay 
this one yes okay thank you thank you
such nice people see everywhere 
you go such nice people  
i was literally just walking along and the 
guy's like hey where are you from do you  
want to be here so i mean i always want a 
beer so i said okay so i stood and shouted  
to them for a while and they were lovely 
really nice people they're just saying hello
so everywhere you go this happens and i love it
is
i haven't been here before so i 
wanted to already stay here explore uh
thank you i love this country so is this your 
first time here no no i've been maybe five or  
six times oh nice yeah it's nice to meet you have 
a nice day youtube be safe thank you you too see  
this is the same you know everywhere i go people 
just want to have a chat and there's a rooster
this is grade six this is from my child's
now i can definitely agree that parts of manila 
are definitely visually intimidating and places  
look you know you look like you might be in a poor 
neighborhood or a squatter area or places where  
you know there's a lot of makeshift housing 
i hate to use the word slums but there are  
you know places that represent that all 
throughout the city here in manila but i find that  
every time i go into places like this i just have 
the most amazing experiences people are so overly  
friendly everywhere i go i've never felt unsafe 
in any of these places so definitely the first  
time i visited one of those you know dangerous 
looking neighborhoods i was definitely i was a  
little bit on edge i was being quite careful i 
know that day you know i didn't take my wallet  
with me i didn't take much money i didn't i 
didn't think i took my phone i didn't really  
wear any jewelry sort of everything i had with 
me i was prepared to lose basically at that point  
so i went to a place just near addition hills and 
visually it was very intimidating you know it was  
a squatter area that was being knocked down and it 
was very overwhelming because the kids just come  
running up to you from everywhere but i quickly 
realized that everyone there was just so friendly  
and people were happy to see me people wanted to 
talk to me it's just something different happening  
for them in that day i actually went back there 
just a couple of days ago i made a video on it  
if you haven't seen it already i'll link it at 
the end of this video but that was just one of  
the best experiences i've had ever traveling 
you know just this unbelievably overwhelming  
response from everyone like kids running up to 
me everyone wanting to be my friend they want  
to know who i am where i'm from what i'm doing you 
know it's just such a lovely experience and while  
those places are visually they look scary or look 
dangerous or whatever that's not the case at all
so one of the things i really love seeing when 
you come to these areas there's all the kids  
outside playing in the street you know they're 
not inside watching tv or playing with an xbox  
or whatever they're out playing playing games 
laughing having a great time it's so good to see  
man this has been another awesome day of walking 
around and exploring so is manila dangerous i  
really don't think so you know you've seen today 
i've just been walking through these neighborhoods  
and everyone is so friendly to me i've walked all 
over this city you know daytime night time and i'm  
the prime candidate to get robbed i got like this 
camera i've got a brand new iphone watch jewelry  
like i'm the best target there is and i really i 
don't feel unsafe anywhere that i walk here you  
know i don't have any hesitations to walk around 
anywhere and if you come here i really don't think  
you need to as well a smile definitely goes a 
long way here and when you have that positive  
energy coming out of you you know the people 
just respond to that and it's just the most  
rewarding experience when you have these random 
conversations with people on the street you know  
invited for beers and people just want to 
have a chat to me you know it's so so nice  
so is there crime here i mean obviously there's 
crime everywhere in the world but i don't think  
it lives up to the reputation you know 
manila seems to have this reputation if  
if you're walking down the street with a camera 
in your hand someone's going to chop your arm off  
just to get your camera but you know i've had no 
bad experiences nothing like that happened to me  
all right i'm gonna wrap the video up here 
if you haven't been to manila you need to  
come here this place is awesome so anyway as 
always thanks for watching see you next time  
so just a quick status update we are 
doing well getting through our tower
that's right we have drawing three 
liters of alcohol you're good  
yeah we have drugs we're good you're we drank 
three liters of alcohol the last part left is beer

cocktail no after cocktail the beer is
