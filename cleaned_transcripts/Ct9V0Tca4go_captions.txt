when you think of the philippines in the
context of world war ii you might see
american general douglas macarthur
marching onto that beach on late with an
avenging force of american and filipino
soldiers in tow
if we fix our scope on this phase of the
war namely the 1944 to 1945 philippines
campaign we might surmise that the
americans were fighting for the
liberation of their filipino brothers
whose islands had been subjected to a
sadistic japanese occupation since
mid-1942
sure a great many americans and
filipinos fought side by side against a
common enemy during the second world war
but that did not mean they were star
wars friends
in fact the united states and the
philippines have to say the least
a rather turbulent history
in this video we shed some light on
filipino-american relations in the early
years of the 20th century focusing on
american and filipino atrocities
committed in the philippine-american war
[Music]

from 1565 to 1898 the philippines were
under the thumb of the spanish empire
from august 1896 to june 1898 filipino
revolutionaries fought against spanish
in what was known as the philippine
revolution or
tagalog war
concurrently the spanish empire and the
americans were at each other's throats
so it was only natural that the
americans involved themselves in the
conflict taking place in the philippines
providing support to the revolutionaries
after the filipinos and americans
defeated the spanish the us and spain
signed a treaty in paris ending the
spanish-american war
this treaty stipulated that spain had to
give the philippines to the u.s
to sweeten the deal the u.s gave spain
20 million bucks essentially buying the
philippines from spain
if the filipinos thought the spanish
sucked they were in for a surprise
after the spanish defeat filipino
revolutionary leader emilio aguinaldo
established the first philippine
republic
with himself as president
but the americans were not having a bar
of it they'd already mailed the check
this understandably caused a bit of
tension and by february 1899 a
full-blown war had broken out between
the filipinos and in quotation marks the
new proprietors of the philippine
islands
this was the philippine american war
america's game plan with the filipinos
was one of quote benevolent assimilation
because those two words clearly go hand
in hand
according to andrew clem's article the
filipino genocide published in the
journal historical perspectives the
occupying americans were prejudiced
against the filipinos dehumanizing them
with racial slurs
in clem's words the ideas about racial
differences were ideally suited for the
goal of annexing the philippines the
united states needed to either bring the
filipinos into the fold or remove them
from the islands
one of the more benevolent ways the
americans brought them into the fold was
through education with white teachers
mostly women coming to the philippines
to educate the next generation in
american ways
when the fighting started however the us
took off its gloves
funnily enough it was general douglas
macarthur's daddy
arthur mcarthur who first marched
american troops against the forces of
the philippine republic
this was in the 1899 battle of manila
waged on the 4th and 5th of february
between 19 000 u.s troops and as many as
40 000 filipino troops
the americans won and it was raw
brutality from that point forward with
filipino bolo knives spears and bows
going up against the fearsome us war
machine
the philippine republic learnt quite
quickly however that a conventional
approach wouldn't work instead they
opted to fight a guerrilla war
this bogged the conflict right down as
it was now harder for the us to
distinguish combatants from civilians
soon they stopped trying to distinguish
them
american brigadier general jacob h
smith's instructions to one of his
officers summarized america's new war
strategy
i want no prisoners
i wish you to kill and burn
the more you kill and burn the better it
will please me i want all persons killed
who are capable of bearing arms in
actual hostilities against the united
states and if you were wondering the
brigadier general deemed anyone over the
age of 10 capable of bearing arms
more conservative estimates suggest that
between 200 000 and two hundred and
fifty thousand died from violence famine
and disease while some sources put that
vigor as high as a million
many of these people died in american
concentration camps encircled by free
fire zones which were aptly nicknamed
suburbs of hell
according to the aforementioned clam
the deadline surrounding the camp kept
all the natives in check and prevented
them from leaving on the threat of death
outside of these disease-ridden camps
american troops forced filipinos to
evacuate their homes or watch them burn
in the words of one e.d fernan of the
washington regiment we burned hundreds
of houses and looted hundreds more this
was apparently an initiative to counter
guerrilla warfare as was torturing
captured men for intel
one method of torture was unsurpassed in
its infamy during the
philippine-american war
this was the dreaded water cure
af miller of the 32nd volunteer infantry
regiment explained this method of
torture in a letter later published in
the omaha world herald
lay them on their backs
a man standing on each hand and each
foot
then put a round stick in the mouth and
pour a pail of salt water in the mouth
and nose
and if they don't give up the
information
pour in another pail
they swell up like toads
i'll tell you it is a terrible torture
some american troops believed their
actions were justified however brutality
in answer to brutality according to a
letter written by an anonymous soldier
from new york
last night one of our boys was found
shot and his stomach cut open
immediately orders were received to burn
the town and kill every native in sight
about 1 000 men women and children were
reported killed
i am probably growing hard-hearted for i
am in my glory when i can sight my gun
on some dark skin
and pull the trigger
the aforementioned brigadier general
jacob h smith supposedly gave his i want
no prisoners order in retaliation
to a filipino atrocity as well
on the 28th of september 1901 in the
town of balinga on samar island a force
of filipino civilians attacked and
massacred 48 american troops who had
been stationed there relatively
peacefully for over a month
according to joseph l shot author of the
ordeal of samar the native labourers
suddenly turned on the soldiers and
began chopping at them with bolos picks
and shovels
the mess tents filled with soldiers
peacefully at breakfast
had been one of the prime targets
dean c worster the secretary of the
interior of the philippine islands
depicted one especially gruesome
atrocity committed by the filipinos in
his book the philippines past and
present
one american prisoner had been buried in
the ground with only his head projecting
his mouth had been propped open with a
stick a trail of sugar laid to it
through the forest and a handful thrown
into it
millions of ants had done the rest
with both sides committing atrocities
such as those few we discussed among
countless more we can safely say that
the philippine-american war won by the
u.s in july 1902 left a bad taste in
everyone's mouths
it would ultimately take a world war to
push the philippines struggle for
independence over the line but that war
namely world war ii was still some 37
years away
those in between years weren't a walk in
the park and there's plenty of history
in there to bring to light such as the
bloody moro rebellion which you may just
cover in a future video
for now a quote from one fa blake a
californian red cross worker who found
himself in the philippines during the
philippine american war
i never saw such execution in my life
the philippines did stand their ground
heroically contesting every inch but
proved themselves unable to stand the
deadly fire of our well-trained and
eager boys in blue
so did you know the philippine-american
war which the aforementioned clem deemed
a 20th century genocide was that bloody
how do you think filipino-american
relations were between the end of the
conflict and philippine independence in
1946. can you think of any other
atrocities committed by either side
