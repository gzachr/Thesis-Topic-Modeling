hey guys it's michael here so first of all let me 
ask this question are you an expat or a foreigner  
like myself who moved here to the philippines and 
are you looking to be able to meet that future  
wife of yours that future girlfriend or maybe 
you want to be able to meet that filipina over  
here in the philippines just to be able to have 
some fun or maybe come to the philippines for  
a nice vacation well that's what this channel is 
forced to be able to give you amazing content and  
information to be able to make sure that when 
you come to the philippines you actually enjoy  
yourself now a lot of the people that's going to 
be visiting this channel right here are people  
also who maybe are starting to experiment in the 
whole online dating and you've met this filipina  
and you want to be able to know ideas on how to 
be able to curate that relationship also how to  
be able to avoid being scammed because that's one 
thing that's happening right now but let me tell  
you guys coming to the philippines is probably one 
of the best decisions that you guys can actually  
make now let's say you're actually a foreigner and 
you already moved over here to the philippines or  
you're this close to moving to the philippines 
what i want to be able to do is give you guys  
tips and advice on where should be good places 
that you should be staying at you know should  
you move into the luzon area the mindanao area or 
the visayas area or should you rent out a condo or  
should you rent out a house these are things that 
a lot of foreigners and expats are wanting to be  
able to know and here's the thing guys there's a 
lot of information out there but my goal is to be  
able to give you guys my opinions but other than 
my opinion is to be able to share with you guys  
knowledge that i've obtained from other foreigners 
and expats that have come to the philippines  
and here's the thing also is to be able to 
get information from filipinos and filipinas  
themselves and that's what i'm going to be sharing 
with you another thing is also is when you come to  
this country you should be assimilated a little 
bit you should actually understand and know more  
about the culture like i have right whether if 
you need to learn some of the tagalog or visaya  
language or longbow language whatever it is and 
at the same time is know what to experience how  
how to avoid problems in the near future they 
literally say knowledge is power but what if  
you're getting the wrong knowledge so that's my 
goal here to be able to explore the both sides  
you know the yin and yang of the information 
in going to the philippines especially as a  
foreigner especially if you're deciding to end up 
moving that's the advice that we're going to be  
giving you guys and i hope that you guys you know 
join us with all the information here at first
