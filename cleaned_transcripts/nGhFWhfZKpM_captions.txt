hey everybody it is will and jose thank you for 
coming back to our channel if it's your first  
time here welcome nice to see you today's video we 
are homebodies but there's a reason why we aren't  
traveling and that's to give you guys our honest 
review on what seems to be the philippines most  
visited fast food chain the good old guys ever 
since we got here we've seen nothing but jelly  
beans everywhere it's the equivalent of having 
7-elevens in thailand they are everywhere and  
there's no way we can be here and not try it 
so here we are we ordered what they said was  
our most popular items we're gonna try them and 
see what's all about guys we're gonna start with  
hey everybody that's the jolly hot dog brown it's 
got like unmelted cheese on it half melted half  
knot and some type of like i'm gonna assume it's 
like ketchup what else could it be ketchup hot dog  
get it rarely do we see hot dogs on a fast food 
restaurant menus usually just burgers and fries  
also remember the last time i had 
a hot dog all right let's try this
let me just start off by saying 
i've never been the biggest hot dog  
fan but i'll eat them if they're chicago style 
it's not bad the breading tastes like a corn dog  
you don't taste the cheese like will said 
for being a hot dog at a fast food chain i  
see why people will order it next up is one of 
their best sellers and that is the yum burger  
and don't forget that jellybean young burger 
we'll see what everyone's been raving about
she's really thinking it through 
she's planning what she's gonna say  
so the patty itself tastes like a 
sausage patty that you have for breakfast  
the sauce is kind of sweet 
on the mild side let's try it
hmm
it's borderline like a char-broiled taste guys 
it is hot in this room because we can't have the  
arrow because it's so loud so if we look like we 
like just dive into the ocean we came right back  
out to film this we probably we didn't we're 
just sweating we're gonna try something that  
i'm a little nervous to try only because it's 
jolly spaghetti why not try some jelly spaghetti  
i never go to a faster restaurant in 
order to spaghetti actually i don't go  
to any restaurant or spaghetti the only 
spaghetti i would ever eat was my mom's  
ever since we came to southeast asia they've had 
this fascination for spaghetti in their restaurant  
wait wait wait wait i think 
this is a hot dog it smells good
like i'm i'm impressed with the 
sauce i'm not a big fan of the noodle  
i like my noodles a little bit thinner the 
meat i don't know what it is it's definitely  
not a hot dog but it has like that texture 
interesting and again the cheese there's it
it added nothing for me that was the slowest 
so it's definitely in the sweeter side would  
you agree with this yeah it's definitely 
on the sweeter side it's not bad yeah i  
probably wouldn't get it again no again i go to 
a fashion restaurant i want a burger and fries  
speaking of fries i don't know how we missed 
the whole internet guys i'm obsessed with fries  
and you know what goes good with anything a jolly 
bee french fry so these better be good jelly bean  
right thickness there's not much 
salt on them which is great you know
okay jollibee you got my bow on those french 
fries like they're they're great oh we  
we heard that you dip your  
grave your fries on gravy okay hence why they gave 
us this little we got gravy gravy i'm not a gravy  
french fried dipper person but i'm gonna do 
it here let's feed each other no i want my own
do you prefer to dip your fries on ketchup or 
gravy neither we've only nibbled but i got thirsty  
and we got a coke we wanted their pineapple 
juice drink but they didn't have it oh no the  
jelly bean pineapple quencher is ow i'm going to 
call corporate don't let that big bolt fool you  
everywhere we've been didn't got a soda there's 
like no carbonation in it why is that philippines  
why have you guys had no carbonation in your pop 
let's try another one of their best sellers and  
it's their chicken joy don't forget the jollibee 
chicken joy oh the gravy with the rice oh okay oh  
you're really committing so now i have to try 
the rice with the gravy it smells really good
wow a full meal this is my favorite this is your 
favorite why what about it the chicken's moist  
you still get that crunch on the outside from 
i hate that word they know how to cook chicken  
here in the philippines man we've had more 
chicken in the philippines than we've been  
in thailand we've only been here two weeks a 
little over two weeks every place we've been  
whether it's been street food or a restaurant 
the chicken has been amazing philippines
holy crap like joy or not 
mcjoy the yum burger yum burger
oh yeah
it's a perfect bite you did it right the first 
time the rice the gravy and the chicken together
chef's kids chef's kids oh yeah this is like 
this is some good chicken this isn't like
save some for the rest of us
i swallowed a bone and this is why you have to 
chew your food 20 times you first of all i'd  
chew my teeth he does not chew his food we're 
going to try their beefy saucy burger kit steak  
and don't forget that jelly bean 
saucy burger steak it's a real winner
let me get some some rice
we're going to attempt to 
get some rice it's not going
what's happening i don't know they're 
sponging though okay we're gonna try this
their beef patty is really good the sauce reminds 
me of like um like a salisbury steak oh my gosh  
this tastes like home this is like 10 year old 
clam which is my middle name getting home from  
church and mom had this cooked oh my gosh instead 
of rice i need mashed potatoes oh my gosh this is  
good all right next let's get back to the burger 
trend we have another one and we're gonna try the  
this is the jollibee 100 beefy champ junior it 
already looks messy yeah it's gonna be good whoa  
it looks like there's the sauce the beefy 
patty it's like an orange tomato and jalapenos  
okay so it's gonna be spicy it's gonna 
be good just go for it i'm already like  
the sauce is spicy already 
good we got spicy by the way  
and he has a very low spice 
tolerance just putting that out there
oh oh oh why it's like oh there's a lot 
happening in this it's tangy it's spicy it's like  
a sour taste to it oh i think it's because of 
the pickled jalapenos you've gone through all  
those feelings you want to have a second bite 
i love the sesame bun though that's a nice take
this is bomb it's good it's really stopped this 
is spicy and it really hits you actually i don't  
know if their sauce is but it's like here some of 
the best i mean we have two more things left we're  
gonna start with oh my god it's a tuna and you 
can't go wrong with the jelly bean two and a half  
the tuna the cheese the carrot look at it it's 
like it's legit guys it smells like a party on  
the inside a party like this is the party i want 
to go to smell that oh my god oh you went for it  
you committed to that fight done game changer 
holy crap oh my gosh this is my favorite thing  
no way this is my favorite thing literally 
it's a hot tuna it's literally i love tuna  
guys it tastes like a hot pocket but the 
breading's even better it is the most  
crispy cheesy tunae tuna tuna tuna e i'm done i i 
hit the jackpot try it you have to obviously you  
can't go without dessert at any meal of the day so 
we ordered jubilees julie hello julie never heard  
of this restaurant ever we ordered their bucco pie 
wait we ordered the peach mango pie thank you and  
for all you sweet toothers out there don't forget 
the jelly bean mango peach pie it's my favorite  
and it's a nice little bite size what the hell 
is that scale for size oh yeah my thumb's bigger
he literally got the bite that i wanted you need 
to get more inside your mouth than on the table  
messiest eater ever or tape like a toaster strudel  
you've never had a tussle strudel i'm not that 
person i had pop tarts oh i don't like mango
mm-hmm i'm honestly god i don't care i don't 
like mango or peach to begin with so like i'm  
automatically not going to like it but like if i 
spill the apple i'd be okay guys that was jelly  
bean we got more food we thought we did everything 
we've had was actually good the one that i didn't  
like was the mango peach but that's because i 
don't like mango or peach there's definitely a  
different taste than going to like mcdonald's or 
burger king it has its own taste we we thought  
we were going to pay way more than what we paid 
but all of this combined was a total of 438 pesos  
we got a lot of food for the amount of money and 
it's all good which is the nice thing to walk away
