just wanna try
i really wanna try the skin here
the outside
wow
so we are here at
sugbo
mercado
in I.T Park in Cebu
and umm
the food smells so good
it's hot
it is hot
it's humid, it's smokey
the food smells good
man, i'm getting hungry because we haven't
eaten all day
so
we all want different things
i think
so
what we have done
is that we have split
and we have 500 pisos each
and we have gone out and we are going to get
what ever we want and
bring it back
the problem is
is that there is too many choices
there is
but we are going to try some local dishes
i think
there's lots of seafood
i saw some ribs
i saw some pork belly
i saw some sisg
i saw some lechon
i didn't see any BALUT
which is kinda what we were looking for
maybe!?
the guys did say we are not going to find
it here
i don't think we are going to find it here
we'll find it
we'll be on a mission
that will have to wait
too bad
(not)
there's nothing left to do but go out and
look for some food
ok
so who's hungry?
i'm starving
let's go eat
so i remember seeing this on google maps and
thought night market
and my impression of what this would be was
completely different
yeah, i thought that this was totally going
to be like the Taipei night market, which
it was not
not as many street vendor type food
but still a wide variety of local cuisines
to see and check out
the food market is only open during the weekends
that is every Thursday to Sunday
between 5pm and 1am
it's pretty spacious
lot's of table and chairs
plenty of room for you to sit down and just
chill out and relax
the market is set p out doors, so if it's
raining
perhaps maybe, look for somewhere else to go
(or bring an umbrella)
but it does attract a little bit of a younger
crowd
lots of different dishes like a fusion of
cuisine
this is pork belly?
what have you put on it?
what's on there?
Pesto
wow look at that blow torch go on that pork
there.. chicken
that is some butterfly squid
and ooooh
look at those scallops
we should have tried those
i know
they smelled so good too
but
there's only so much space that we have in
out stomachs
and we were determined to try and find some
local cuisine
saving room for the lechon
all the food in this market smelled so delicious
there's different kinds of sisig?
ok so we went wth the local dish
this is something i have been excited about
trying
this is the LECHON
which is the roasted pig
it's actually spit roasted pig
which is usually done whole over a fire
you can see them chopping it with a meat cleaver
rather violently
but it's got this nice crispy skin on the
outside
juicy on the inside
the pig is usually stuffed with seasoning
so
that infuses through the meat
like a spit roasted pig with some rice that
is wrapped up in these banana leaves here
(maybe bamboo)
all this was 75 pisos which works out to a
dollar thirty five U.S
we are going to open up some of this rice
break it apart
i'm just going to try
i wanna try some of this skin here
the outside
wow
that is good
it's just crispy and greasy of the fat
that underlies it
there's no meat in there
it's not hard it's not overly crispy
it's not chewy either
it's actually really easy to eat
like the chicheronnes
is that what you call it
but way more flavorful
woaw and the pork is even more flavorful
i think it's been infused with some of the
fat and the seasoning from the inside of the
pig
very rich
i think they give you a smaller portion
because it's so fatty that yu stomach would
feel funny because it's so rich
you can soak up some of the juice with the
rice here
oh that is really good
so this is the
chicken sisig
Filipino bibimbap
if you guys know what that is
which is mixed rice (KOREAN STYLE)
this is the Filipino version of that
chicken egg
rice
all mixed together
little chili in it
it's like
wow
it's spicy right up front
and there's some nice flavor behind that
it's a board based chicken flavor
that mixes nicely with the rice
it's like a good stir fried rice flavor without
that oily felling
it's nice and light actually
but i like the spice behind it
and the local beer
which was really only
100 piso
this is the cervesa negro, which is the other
local beer besides san miguel, which i haven't
tried yet
kinda like a guiness
which goes nice with the lechon
this is what i came back with
and this came up to 190 piso
so a little bit more
double the price
but before i start
i will put some bags on my hands
because this is how you do it
i am going to eat with my hands
i'm going to put some calamansi
so this is what i got
i think i got chicken skin
i am going to take some of this rice
and the meat
i made a mess
it's really good
super good guys
and this over here is a pink lychee
i like it how they have these little bags
i think this is how you do it
i'm just kidding
and there you have it
ooh that's like super sweet
but it's super cold
really nice
i like it
now i just want to
now here's some general observations we were
making
first thing
the average age of everyone around here well
under the age of 30 probably the average age
everybody around here
25
we are the oldest people here
we are like the senior citizens
this is a young vibrant crowd
everybody speaks perfect English
in el nido there were people that spoke broken
English
a mix of Tagalog and English
but here, it's like being in America
in terms of the English level spoken here
it's a little early
but we headed home and we are kinda going
to hang out here in the apartment with our
friend
we got an early day tomorrow
so glad that we decided to walk there because
we got to see some really interesting things
we had a great time walking to the market
and exploring some of the sights and sounds
of Cebu city at night
what was really interesting was walking around
seeing these local stores that seem to be
set up outside peoples homes
they were like restaurants barber shops
so interesting to see all the local people
were so friendly too
they told us not to go out in certain neighborhoods
at night, but there were all these kids playing
and families out having a good time
so we felt like t was ok
and we got to see the colorful beautiful and
wonderful sights and sounds of Cebu city
this is probably one of our favorite things
to do is to walk around the city and just
explore
we are going to call it a night here
going to sign out
thanks so much for watching guys
and we will see you
in the next vlog
and catch you in the comments
bye
