Hi guys! This is Kelly.
Welcome to my channel~
Today, I'll be talking about the culture differences in school 
from the Philippines to other countries.
So let's get started~ 👈🏻👈🏻
Firstly, it’s the groupings.
You might wonder, “What grouping is the same for all countries.
It’s educational stuff.”
But no!
It’s not about the teaching method.
It’s about the students.
In the Philippines, whenever the teacher announces
“Group yourselves into 3s,”
What is the response (from the students)?
“Ms/Sir can we go by 4s?”
YES!!
“Can we go by 5s? Can we go more than three?”
That is the typical answer (in the Philippines).🤣
I am guilty about that as well :)
Because we want to go by friends.
 However, in Korea or in other countries (when teachers asks),
MOSTLY
“Class, group yourselves into 3s.”
“Yes, Ms.”
Or they say, “Hello! Who wants to go with me?”
This is the negotiation culture that students have in the Philippines.
Is anyone guilty?
Comment down if this is you 😂
The next culture difference that I've experienced is the quiz.
When there’s quiz in the Philippines, we mostly
use the intermediate pad, quiz pad, or the yellow pad.
Students, what do you mostly say to your friends?
Penge isa!!
Can I have one (a piece)?
So, what does the teacher say?
Let's say Julia is the one that has the quiz pad.
Julia, sell it to your friends for a peso (Philippine currency)!
Back when I was in high school, it was cheaper.
But nowadays, it's worth a peso.
Does this mean the teacher also used to get a paper from his/her friend?
Yes~
We all know it.
The teachers, principals, and everyone knows that
whenever we ask for an intermediate pad,
one in the class will be sacrificed.
But in Korea, whenever we have short quizzes,
the teachers print it out all and distribute to the students.
But in the other countries,
I'm not sure how they take their short quizzes.
But at least based on my experience, that's how it's done.
Like if you're really in the lower level/grade (in Korea),
we write it in our notes and submit it to the teachers.
Then, they will check it.
The last culture experience that I want to share is the suspension of classes.
In the Philippines, we are aware that whenever there is typhoons/ monsoons..
Basically when it’s rainy seasons, we experience a lot of
suspension of classes due to flood (and other reasons).
When it starts raining, students what do you say?
Suspension! Suspension!
This is ridiculous (to hope for suspension) considering that
there will be a lot of people  suffering because of the typhoon.
But then as students, we normally wish for suspension (to rest).
I think everyone would have at least once wished for suspension.
YES
But then in Korea, even if it snows a lot, even if it rains hard,
We still go to school, we still report to work, we still go on.
In the Philippines, depending on the signal number,
(Explaining what signal number is)
This was the saddest thing I've realized as I reached the University level.
 Come to think about it.
University students and people reporting to their work are
the ones who commute the most.
But how come we have to reach signal number 3?!?!
Oh, we once said
Oh my gosh, are we a frog?
Oh my gosh, are we mermaid??
Oh my gosh, are we immoral???
This is my personal experience.
One time, the flood reached my knee level.
I'm quite short. 😝
It reached my knee level, it was my first ever experience. 🙄🙄
I decided that I'm not going to school anymore (but I was near the school).
I can't ride the bus. The situation was really bad.
So I booked Grab and I waited.
 Do you know what the driver said? 
Hey, child, you cross the street and then you meet me here.
Wow 🙄 (I booked Grab because it was flooded...)
So I just cancelled and I went a little above the LRT station.
So that I can escape from the flood.
I called my mom, I cried, “I can’t go home.”
I don't know what to do anymore,
and she was really worried about me.
But, I saw this person riding Jeepney, he was wearing slippers.
He was so ready for this flood.
Back then, I wasn't so ready for this flood.
It was my first experience.
So, my socks, my robber shoes, my jeans. It was so, so, so wet.
So, basically that’s the suspension differences in the Philippines
from the other country.
Mostly, schools and educational institutions are the area,
where many people escape to.
It's like the rescue center in case emergencies happen.
Then, in Philippines, when situations, like suspension, etc
We are asked to go back to our family/ to our home.
So that's it for the culture differences in the Philippines
and the other countries in the school.
