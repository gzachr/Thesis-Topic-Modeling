traditional tattoos called batok were
once a symbol of beauty wealth and
strength
um
at 106 years old apple one God is the
oldest person in the world practicing
this Filipino art
the tradition nearly disappeared when
the U.S took control of the Philippines
in the late 19th century
but one God never stopped tapping
her persistence eventually landed her on
the front cover of Vogue
now she's a celebrity
[Music]
every week hundreds of tourists will
hike up miles to reach our isolated
Village
all for a chance to get one simple three
dot tattoo the only design one God still
makes
so how did a centenarian woman save this
art form
and can it survive without her
one God's Village of buskalan sits over
3 300 feet above sea level
and the only way of getting here is on
foot
one God finds everything she needs to
make her tattoos in her backyard
sharp green Thorns from pomelo and lemon
trees will become her needles
she inserts the Thorns into a bamboo
stick to make the tapping tool called a
gissy
to make the ink she scrapes the fine
soot from a burnt pot and mixes it with
water until it thickens
one God got her first tattoo when she
was a teenager almost a century ago
foreign
she's lost count of how many she has
foreign
on the porch area outside her home
each client brings their own geeky from
local sellers
she dips a small twig in the ink and
marks the design
with the geese she pierces the Black Ink
into the skin leaving behind a permanent
mark
for elders of the Kalinga tribe these
tattoos are one of the most important
possessions
they believe the markings are the only
way for them to be recognized by their
ancestors in the afterlife
was once mainly practiced by men
but one God's father encouraged her to
defy the tradition and learn the skill
foreign
tattoos were an essential part of
society for tribes in the Cordillera
region
girls got their first as early as 13 to
show they were ready for marriage
many men earned their tattoos for
headhunting like modern day military
medals the tribes believed they could
bring luck to their people by beheading
their enemies during battle
each kill Headhunters would earn chest
tattoos for their bravery
the tribe managed to survive centuries
of colonization by Spain
but when the U.S took control of the
country in 1898 headhunting was outlawed
in the appeal of bathok tattoos waned
Christian missionaries considered the
tattoos to boo and tribe's people were
told to cover them
the Philippines is the only Christian
Nation in the Far East by the time the
Philippines gained independence in 1946
many old indigenous practices had
disappeared high schools
grade schools everything taught in
English

about the tools and that's when she just
she smiled and just say uh gave me a tap
in the shoulder and she pointed at a
tool and then the translator was saying
like oh I think she wants to get
tattooed

didn't want it to look like culture
appropriation or stolen valor
