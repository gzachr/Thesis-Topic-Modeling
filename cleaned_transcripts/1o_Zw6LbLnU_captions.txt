let me know maybe we don't need to focus so much  
about about like all the legal goings on 
uh but yeah I remember last time I did a  
reaction yeah I was being told by 18s just 
yeah for now let just uh how do we say it  
just yeah call them as Mahalima by their names 
as well uh but I think think sb19 uh we always  
love but uh so they've got sb19 have a new 
song uh but yeah let me know uh let me know  
the status of everything that's happening 
but also let's focus on a some new music

sb19 playlist or Mahala for more for more of  
my reactions to see what I've discovered and

again Mahala with yeah with their sound
Justin let your thead we don't know
I yeah
wow Ken
if if you're new if you're new you know 
Ken is my bias easily easily he's you  
got to love him you got to love him for so 
many reasons right come on but this is so
good yeah there he
is
but don't you worry I know wow this part is so
good yeah you had you had Ken Josh and 
then PA oh they did that so well arranged
amazingly
Ste his voice

yeah this is so fun too it's just a fun
song but it's it's made so well
yes wow wa reset full music video I really 
enjoy this one it's yeah a very a very very  
fun song there they are that's a nice that's a 
nice picture there I'm going to keep it short  
and sweet though uh I might just add this to my 
playlist because this song is going to make you  
feel good regardless again shout out Pablo and 
his brother production is fire and like I said  
the arrangement of Parts where who comes in where 
and following each other and uh the harmonies just  
beautiful uh yeah beautiful arrangement of it too 
as I said no matter how we are going to describe  
them no matter how we will you got Justin you got 
Pablo you got Josh you got St and of course of  
course my favorite Ken Ken or Phillip H love them 
love them all and first time introduced to her i i  
s I did search mind you uh in the description her 
name is sander sander uh let me know about her uh  
what I need to know but anyway so I'm just happy 
for new music and I'm sure 18 all 18s are the same  
I'm going to leave it there it is a pop it is a 
pop hit this one it's a smash the pop pop Vibes  
and see I don't want to go too deep on it I said 
I'm going to keep it short but I say Pablo he can  
work with anyone like as a producer like a song 
like this produced like this I feel like could  
be big with any of the pop stars top of the US um 
charts you know what I mean it's it's that type  
of song it's produced that way but yeah uh they 
all can do great things in their solo careers I  
could go I could see here for an hour to talk 
about that um them individually but anyway I'm  
going to leave it there and again see that's 
why Ken is my bias in all different ways how  
he looks now um how he was singing uh with his 
voice or and when he raps as well uh and then  
when he was being a little bit silly as well it's 
just you just love him you just love him that's it  
but we love them all Mahala I'm going to leave 
it there subscribe for more s sp19 check my S  
sp19 playlist to see all I've done on them much 
more to come I'll see you in the very next one
