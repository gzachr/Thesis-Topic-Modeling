[Music]
our family of five is on a quest to experience
110 distinct cultures across all seven continents
by the summer of 2025.
we're currently on a three-week tour of Southeast
Asia and after spending 10 days in Singapore
Manila and Coron island in the Philippines
we're swapping the adventure of private Lagoon
houseboat life for the luxurious resort life
of Boracay this 10 Mile hot spot was named
the best island in the world by Travel and
Leisure magazine thanks to its white sand
beaches world-class coral and shipwreck diving
and reputation for being one of the world's
top destinations for relaxation but before
we can feel the sand in our toes we have to
get there and that means leaving our current
paradise behind it is so hard to say goodbye
to this place now we're are off to wherever
we're going next and I as much as we love
this place I can't wait to see what else Philippines
has in store for us [Music]
I think we may have run out of gas on the
way we have a flight in a little more than
two hours so hopefully this doesn't delay
us too much we're just far enough away from
where we started that they can't see us or
hear us not close enough to make it with a
paddle Felix the captain is able to call into
the reception at the restaurant and hopefully
they're going to bring somebody to rescue
us out here in the middle of paradise but
also nowhere
sounds iffy fingers crossed we're moving we're
cruising we're back on track we're heading
to the city so we should be good
[Music]
made it to the airport we've been trying to
check in here for about an hour and it's turning
into quite an ordeal first thing was pretty
typical baggage stuff but then they said since
you're flying from this island to another
island in the Philippines you need to fill
out some additional paperwork online here's
a link and she's been up there for about 20
minutes I think filling this stuff out I don't
know for sure because I'm sitting here watching
our bags and her purse but up here comes Erin
I did it we finally got all the documentation
sorted out and we're off we're gonna
board in five minutes so we better get going
that was a little bit stressful airport experience
made it down to the wire I mean what are the
odds that our boat's gonna break down and
then you don't have the right documentation
but we're here we're still going strong this is
only half because we got two flights today
back to Manila then Manila to Boracay one
flight down we're in Manila now and here's
flight number two to Cataclan and we're
traveling on college football game day in
the U.S when we travel I have a hard time
watching the games I usually keep up on a
Facebook group that I love and sometimes I'll
just refresh the score over and over to get
the play-by-play so if you have any tips on
how I can watch college football while we
travel let me know
we're at Cataclan airport
I think this is the tiniest airport that we've
actually flown into well especially considering
the size of the aircraft that come in here
I mean that's a legitimate plane right there
but yeah the uh the terminal is minuscule
we're staying as Shangri-la and transportation
from the airport to the hotel is included
in our stay it's a quick seven minutes to
the Shangri-La there are no direct flights
to Boracay Island so you should expect
to take a few different modes of transportation
to make it from the airport to your hotel
thank you welcome sir I'm thinking that now
we need a boat to get to the main hotel this
is called the lounge now it's just a 15-minute
speed boat ride to the resort so now we're
going to the resort urukai is an island in
the west visayas region it's only seven kilometers
long and one kilometer wide and manages to
pack over 300 Resorts and hotels into that
space because of its beautiful beaches and
a variety of water activities that are available
it's been growing as a prime Philippine tourist
destination since the early 2000s over 2 million
visitors make the trek each year I think we
take a golf cart now so we're hitting all
the forms of transportation hit the air see
and now land
[Music] so pretty and so tropical here our
hotel is known for being a family-friendly
and spa-like Oasis separated from the hustle
and bustle of the downtown nightlife if this
paradise is also known for while Erin checks
us in we're gonna check this out
so we have our own personal Butler and we
have a welcome drink I should say that we booked this through our travel destination
club inspirato they're the ones who told us
about this place and recommended it so we're
very happy to be here and if you want to know
more about inspirato oh cheers if you want
to know more about inspirato and how we use
their club to travel all over the world go
to followabc.com/pass now that the check-in process
is over we're gonna go to our room because
it's all ready for us
not available
[Music]
[Music]
and look at the view look what we have
on our balcony guys hot tub  gorgeous
Glasia is our Butler and we get this neat
little device and we can contact her morning
or the evening Butler or the after hours after
midnight Service uh this is really cool very
high tech I gotta be honest this room is more
than we are expecting we thought we were getting
kind of a basic hotel room but it's pretty
legit we've got a bar back here with mini
bar they set up the couch and then a spare cot
for Brooklyn and Colt so that's going to be
really comfortable for them to sleep and then
we've got our king size bed over here we've
got a desk TV we have to watch TV in like
a week and a half okay and then in here is
the closet with actually a huge safe look
at this one compared to the one that we just
had this is the safe it's probably just big
enough to put your passports in keep them
dry keep them safe it's like a gun safe really
big hang up area places for for all of our
suitcases to go right here a toilet room and
this one has a flushing toilet totally old
school totally the opposite of where we just
were we're trading one of the most beautiful
settings in the world but one of the most
rustic lodging accommodations for a really
nice accommodations here with all the bells
and whistles air conditioning and everything
I mean we're just getting a little bit of
everything on this whole trip and then this
massive bathroom with a big tub ginormous
shower two sinks we're in a hog heaven we're
also very hungry we're having dinner at a
treetop restaurant tonight and we're up a
little bit higher so the views are phenomenal
I mean we can see for nautical mile after
nautical mile and the Sun is gonna go down
right in front of us it's just stunning this
is a Tropical Paradise beyond our expectations
so pretty two years ago when we started traveling
as a family we didn't really have the Philippines
on our list it's because we watched other
creators and were inspired by other people
who have been here and we thought we've got
to go well I'm glad we did because I feel
like every new adventure we go on every new
destination we have we learn a little bit
more about the world we realize the world
is bigger than we thought it was before and
we're inspired to continue to travel and we
are so grateful that we've come here to the
Philippines and we're only halfway through
our tour of the Philippines so still so much
more for us to see I completely agree with
Erin I really had never considered the Philippines
to a large extent I knew it from my military
friends being here military presence my very
first girlfriend in kindergarten but that
was about it but seriously we've been to Belize
we've been to Costa Rica so many places in
Mexico the Exumas in the Bahamas Croatia
places that have beautiful water and beautiful
geology but I had no idea how incredible the
Philippines are these islands have been nothing
short of spectacular it's just so much Beauty
condensed into these singular Landscapes I'm
just blown away by how beautiful the water
is how beautiful the diving is and how beautiful
the mountains and all of the greenery are
this is absolutely at the top of my list where
every place we have visited so far yes and
every place we've been to is so different
so far in the Philippines it's been Manila
coron and then now Boracay and they are just
like worlds apart but so enriched with culture
different culture and Beauty but different
beauty I just love how we're getting something
so unique and special at each spot we've been
at and we'll continue to go between this house
made veggie burger my family my beautiful
wife and this view can't imagine better setting
to eat yeah everything looks delicious and
the seafood is really good here the seafood
Philippines in general has been excellent
and uh had it for acai is really delicious
too because I got the octopus salad dinner
with a view awesome let's go this is a Tropical
Paradise and if you're from the US I might
compare it a little bit to Hawaii in the way
that there's so much culture and tradition
coupled with some luxury accommodations and
it's lunch time and we decided we're going
to walk down here to the poolside Cafe because
it's casual the menu looked interesting but
mostly I think just looking over this multi-level
pool is a really cool way to just kind of
hang out these mosquitoes are pretty serious
about their bite so if you're coming to Boracay
bring bug spray I guess I'm just lucky because
I haven't even seen a single mosquito on this
entire trip there is something going on with
me because I used to never get bug bites and
then suddenly ever since we went to Puerto
Rico I'm getting bit all over the place I'm
just too sweet sweet blooded Brooklyn and
I are gonna share a smoked salmon Pizza they
have a huge Pizza Oven over there so it seems
like they're experts at the pizza game but
I would like to point out that most of the
menus we're seeing is not strictly Filipino
food it's a mixture of Steakhouse or Italian
I see a lot of pasta dishes there too so it's
a hodgepodge meant to accommodate everybody
because people from all over are vacationing
here I'm gonna dig into this Thai seafood
salad which looks delicious and is delicious
and our pizza says here this is actually the
first time I've seen them cook the smoked
salmon inside the cheese gonna make my pizza
of course darling Pizza I feel like I've been
eating so much better since we've been in
the Philippines I feel like it's just easier
to eat better here this is delicious and fresh
well look who decided to take a break from
lizard hunting and have some lunch I think
this is the new best place I've been to because
when it has monitors two it probably has my
second favorite lizard period the toke gecko
okay time to check out morikai's best assets
the beach in the water and an immediate detour
to the ice cream shop hello can I do the strawberries
and cream wow there's so many so many amazing
place here the dark
passion fruit lychee which Colt's gonna
get and wasabi not much wasabi with you
thank you can we also get a one scoop and
a cup of the bucco like like cheese sorbet
Colt's not even here to order it himself because
he's off looking for critters not just lizards
but frogs can we also get one scoop of Wasabi
I licked it and then it just fell off
Colts is yummy here he is thank you one Gekko
and one frog in each hand now which hand are
you gonna hold your ice cream in my mouth
what do you think that actually look like
this it's so good this is why you can't have
cones because his hands are always filthy
dirty and here's the wasabi I'm gonna guess
it's oh no I was gonna say I was gonna guess
it's gonna taste like ginger but it smells
like Wasabi oh my gosh I am so curious that's
crazy it's Wasabi ice cream so interesting
it tastes like you're eating Wasabi the cold
and not actually because if you took a bite
this big a Wasabi you'd be in a lot of pain
even the texture is just so similar it's so
granulated that is weird you're just eating
frozen mild Wasabi very good mommy
no oh
she didn't learn her lesson the name Boracay
is attributed to several different origins
depending on who you ask the island's indigenous
Ate people say that the name of the island
came from the anati words Bora which means
Bubbles and bokai meaning white but there's
another theory that says the names derived
from the local word borac which means white
cotton and it's supposed to be a reference
to the color and the texture of boracai's
white sugary and powdery sand I love that
we all like to do something different when
we come to the beach you know what Colt likes
to do I just caught a shrimp and he whacked
me I'm sorry I've never seen a shrimp in the
wild so shrimp
wow Brooklyn loves being in the water she's
a little fish hi [Music]
Phil wants to be anywhere there's shade and
I like to do a little bit of everything yeah
but there's something else that we know the
entire family is going to love so we're gonna
head up there now and get started since four
kinds of place that people go to vacation
we're gonna do something pretty vacationy
we actually haven't done it before it'll be
our first time and we want to try and do new
activities instead of just doing the same
things in different places so we did try to
mix it up a bit so we do try to mix it up
a bit and it's not just a vacationy place
for foreigners like us this is also where
a lot of Filipinos come to do their vacation
so in the States this for example might be
like our Hawaii or Florida or Southern California
we're gonna do all right that's our speed
boat out there [Music]
all the water is so beautiful here I want
to give off of everything high dive off of
every dock every balcony
[Music] foreign
[Music] not to sound pretentious but maybe
a little too touristy for us and even if this
is a touristy vacation place not our style
but at least we tried it now we can check
it off our list it wasn't my favorite either
but at least we tried and now we gotta wash
the salt out of our hair and get ready for
dinner and now that we are cleaned up we're
ready for dinner but we're not gonna do it
on resort because we just learned our lesson
with the touristy stuff so we're gonna catch
a shuttle and we're gonna head into the downtown
area of gorakai and we're gonna explore venturing
out our Resort provides a free shuttle service
to the downtown area and it's just a 15 minute
drive turned out to be a really productive
car ride over here because we got some great
advice on where to go for dinner if we like
seafood and we do and we're starting off in
what they call the mall it's obviously not
a mall but that's just their word for it to
let people know that it's a Market Place hey
cool come on bud I think first we're gonna
go over to the beach because we're really
close to White Beach and I want to see if
maybe we can run into Willy's point or at
least do a little people watching over there
as the sun's going down because it's pretty
much sunset time right now so it's a perfect
time to do that
foreign
stunning this is the busiest Beach I think
we've seen since we got to Asia but it's still
plenty beautiful and this area really gets
hopping after dark because of the big nightlife
scene here on the island you may notice that
pretty much the only automobiles that are
on the island are those vans like we took
in here and everything else the Tuk Tuks and
scooters and motorcycles and that's because
of an intentional initiative from the island
to change the nature of the transportation
that they use around here for the sake of
the environment it is really crowded in this
area and I'm surprised because this isn't
even the busy season we're still in the rainy
season in the Philippines this is an epic
Sunset to go with our epic Beach cuisine Cuisine
love eating with a view obviously we don't
know of any places to go down here we did
get that local recommendation but we kind
of wanted to eat here with a very good view
of the beach and that one was more in town
so it wouldn't have a view at all and walking
through here there were some places that looked
pretty promising except that they were empty
and a long time ago I heard a really good
rule of thumb which is stay away from the
restaurants that are empty because there might
be a very good reason and this one is pretty
hot so I think we're we're looking pretty
good of course I've also heard a rule of thumb
that you should not go to a restaurant that
has an enormous menu and this one's perfect
so [Music] not very adventurous but that's
just Beach food for me shrimp well the sunset
award definitely goes to Boracay it was breathtaking
and a great way to spend our last night here
we got to get back to the resort you might
as well get back to our resorts in style and
a little tuk-tuk so whatever they call them
here in the Philippines well if it gets the
job done
we made it safe and sound unfortunately we
have to leave this paradise but don't go anywhere
so subscribe and follow us along to our next
adventure we are moving right along to bahal
we are going to check out the Chocolate Hills
hopefully see some tarsiers and some amazing
Filipino culture so please stick with us and
we'll go to the next destination together
okay
okay
