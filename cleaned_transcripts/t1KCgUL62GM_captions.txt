welcome to tawi tawi here we are wow this 
probably is one of the smallest airports  
that I've ever been to so here we are guys in 
tawi tawi It's a beautiful morning just arrived  
it's about 10 a.m and it's raining a little 
bit some overcast but it's all right hopefully  
it clears up and we get to enjoy this island 
another place that I have heard be careful it's  
not too safe so I'm going to try to break the 
stereotype just like I did in Zamboanga so now  
the name of the airport sangasanga airport 
so just arrived here gotta figure out how to  
get to my Resort and yeah let's let's enjoy 
tawi tawi I'll check in with you guys soon  
wow this is potentially the smallest 
airport I've ever been to um
okay because the smallest now I have to go 
to baggage claim I have no idea where this is  
but that's literally the airport  
let's figure out where is the baggage claim 
and oh okay I think I have to go this way  
yeah guys this is it this is the airport welcome 
it's crazy hello sir where is the baggage claim  
oh this way okay all right so I guess they 
just bring the bags out and put them over here
so from here I'll probably take one of those 
little pedicabs or uh rickshaws to get to my hotel  
[Music] so I think you have to wait for your bags 
here and they bring them everybody's waiting here
so we're gonna wait
hopefully this rain stops I'm 
only here for two days so I'm  
gonna try to show you guys as much as 
I can in tawitawi but super excited  
so this is how the luggage is brought out 
right on a truck like this and we kind of  
just have to figure out where ours is let's 
grab it and then go I don't know where mine is
but this is uh it's the baggage claim baby
very interesting way of claiming baggage
yeah so my friend here is helping me my name is
so we're going to get a tricycle now yeah 
and then I'm gonna head over to the resort  
known as almari I'll show you guys what 
it looks like but this was a very easy  
airport experience to grab the luggage and 
now I have my friend Muhammad helping me  
and we're gonna grab a taxi but as you 
can see this airport is a small airport  
it's right in the middle of the Town a 
band yes yeah yes where do you play yeah
how much
at this point I'm Filipino you know
all right so our place yeah I want to show how 
nice tawitawi is that's why I come to Vlog here  
is a very peaceful yeah yeah and the people 
are nice yes yes and it's safe yeah it's safe  
because many people say oh be careful in tawi 
tawi you have to be careful but it's uh it's  
it's okay it's safe right okay yeah very nice 
all right so as you heard Muhammad we're safe  
that's my house oh right here 
yes you live right here okay you
all right so we're gonna grab 
one of these tricycles yes  
hey what's up bro all right 
so tricycle loading area  
let's figure out how much it's gonna cost 
to go to almari and it'll be on our way
this way
[Music]
all right [Music]
okay yeah yeah cool you're also going yeah  
okay along the way okay great so 
we'll just split it then uh yeah
okay okay here this one you 
can put on top no problem  
just make sure it doesn't fall okay 
Muhammad thank you so much thank you
all right so we're gonna get in a pedicab tricycle 
and be on our way guys I'll show you some sights  
welcome brother sorry
I'm from the US thank you brother 
and you're from tawi tawi yeah nice  
thank you man I'm excited to see the city uh the 
island I should say yeah and vlogging about it  
so I'm gonna show how nice it is because many 
people say you have to be careful blah blah  
blah but I want to show people that it's 
okay to come here it's okay and and visit  
actually anywhere you must be yeah always be 
careful always be careful exactly yep solo
[Music]
solo
oh no problem no problem moving shots
[Music]
we have arrived to the resort it's raining like 
crazy man we're right on the beach because it's  
beautiful but unfortunately it's raining and 
I won't be able to show you that right now  
but hopefully the rain stops but so far 
look at that beautiful mountain up there  
so let's go see what this room looks 
like here this is the almari beach resort
alrighty guys so this is what the hallways 
look like about to enter the room in a second  
uh this is a little view from the lobby area very 
little small island nobody really comes here guys  
I mean this is uh exclusive stuff you're seeing 
right here from a foreign vlogger I'm one of the  
first I think to ever come here so enjoy it as I 
will as well welcome to the almari beach resort  
this is the room see the bathroom first now guys 
you have to keep in mind this is not a tourist  
destination so this is one of the nicest hotels I 
could book and it still cost me like 30 a night so  
it's just how it is in these places where 
tourism is not really a thing but with that  
being said the room is decent to see the bed oh 
that's a hard bed all right um it's pretty No  
Frills at least we have an outlet and there's a 
balcony overlooking the water which is quite nice  
very nice I guess that was supposed to be a 
swimming pool but Lord knows what happened to it  
and this is it guys we are in tawitawi absolutely 
beautiful um it's a nice remote island I really  
feel remote also another thing to keep in mind 
here is that there is no phone service here so  
like I I am trying to uh use my phone but there's 
absolutely no service um and even here you have to  
pay for the Wi-Fi even at the hotel they make 
you pay for the Wi-Fi which I found kind of  
strange but hey it is what it is it's really cheap 
though for like four hours they charge you like  
two dollars or something so it's not a big deal 
but yeah look at the water guys absolutely amazing  
a nice isn't that really a beach they call it 
a beach but it's not really much of a beach  
um but there are some other beaches around 
here so we're gonna go check out the city  
in a bit it's raining so hopefully this rain 
stops and then we'll be able to check it out  
but yeah not a bad place for 30 a night like 
I said you have to keep in mind that yeah this  
is not a tourist destination so beautiful guys 
the sun came out look at this mountain in the  
background amazing let's go explore a little 
bit explore the city or the island of tawitawi
alrighty so here we are this is the back side of 
the resort and uh it's not much here but this is  
it there's a some grass almost pool a place to 
sit down little area where the kids are playing
