♫ When I feel bad, I try to hold it,
♫ Hold it all inside

And we're the Caleon twins.

For today's video, we are
in the Philippines again
and what better way to say
we're in the Philippines
then to do a video of
trying Filipino snacks.
And we've tried a lot in our lifetime
but the ones we've chosen,
we haven't tried before.
So, let's get on with the video.
So our first snack is called Knick Knack
and oh Knick Knacks, and
it's milk coated biscuits.
I actually thought these were
pretzels when I got them.
So, apparently they're not, ah.
Imagine a goldfish coated in like milk.
- Okay let's try it.
Taste pretty decent.
- It's good, it taste like
something very familiar.
You don't like it (laughing).
- I mean it's fine,
I just don't want to eat
something so sweet right now.
- They're good, they
taste like another snack
that I get from Canada, I just
can't put my finger on it.
- They're like icing coated crackers.
- I'd get these again, how 'bout you?
- Next, we have a chocolate
bar, and it's called Cloud nine
and it says luscious caramel,
crunchy peanuts and soft
- Soft nouget
(laughing)
- In rich chocolate.
I'm not really a big
fan of chocolate bars.
- Or peanut butter.
- Or caramel, in general.
- So, I don't know why
you bought that, but.
- Just to try, we'll see (laughing).
(upbeat music)
- Oh.
- Oh, it feel like.
- It's very caramelly.
Well, I don't like caramel, so,
I mean if you like caramel,
maybe you'll like it.
- It's all in my teeth now.
I can't even show you my teeth.
It's alright, I wouldn't get it again
'cause I don't really like
chocolate bars that much
so maybe that's why.
- Here we have Pacencia vanilla.
They say they're egg
cookies and vanilla flavored
so I've seen this around
- Yeah.
- In Chinese grocery stores but
I've never tried them before
(upbeat music)
- No, I can't eat that.
- It taste like fortune cookies.
- But there's like this
sort of after taste
that's really gross.
- Yeah but it's not that gross
to me it taste like fortune cookies.
- No they don't (laughing).
I wouldn't eat them again,
they kinda taste kinda bad.
Next, we have these Ovaltine crackers.
- They're popular in the Philippines.
They're like
- A chocolate drink.
- Yeah, that's like a chocolate
drink like a hot chocolate.
- It says it's a chocolate
malt cream sandwich.
- They kinda do look like Oreos.
I mean like the outside
is not as dark of a brown
but, let's try it.
(upbeat music)
Oreos are still better but
I mean this comes like as a close second.
- I can't even taste the chocolate in it.
- No, you know what it taste
like, powdered chocolate milk.
- I'd still go with Oreos.
Just because you can barely
taste the chocolate in here.
- Yeah.
- But it's not bad
but just not as sweet
as I thought it'd be.
- Yeah.
- So our last snack is
a twist on a traditional
Filipino snack called Polvoron
- Polvoron.
- Which is what?
- Powdered milk
- Cookies, made into a cookie
- Powdered milk made into a cookie.
- So this is a chocolate coated Polvoron.
I've actually never had
chocolate coated ones before.
We love the regular kind, so.
Really chocolatey
- Oh.
I'll take a bite.
(upbeat music)
Don't really think they
go together really well.
- No.
- On their own, they'd be good, no?
They don't really match, like
- Yeah the combination of the
cookie part of the chocolate.
The chocolate doesn't
taste that good, though.
- No.
- Maybe that's why, so X.
That's it for the video
- That's it for the video.
