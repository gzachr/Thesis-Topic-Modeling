- Greetings, my beautiful lovelies.
It's Emmy.
How are you?
It's great to see you and welcome back.
Today, I'm going to be
showing you how to cook,
prepare, and eat balut.
Do you know what balut is?
Balut is a developing embryo,
usually a duck, inside of an egg.
It is cooked, it is eaten
and it is well-loved.
You can find it all over Southeast
Asia, including Cambodia,
Thailand, Vietnam, and Southern China.
But it's very popular in the Philippines.
Now I had my first taste
of balut years ago.
My dear friend, Ken,
showed me how to eat it.
It was the first time I had it.
I enjoyed it, but I have
never cooked it myself.
So I went to the Chinese
market the other day
and there they were for sale.
I've never cooked them myself.
So today I'm gonna show
you how to prepare them
and to eat them.
Balut are nutritious, tasty, portable,
and they've been eaten for centuries.
So I purchased two eggs.
They were 99 cents each and I
put them in some boiling water
and cooked them for 25 minutes.
Balut is often served with a bit of salt
or some seasoned vinegar.
I've got some palm vinegar
here that also has some garlic
and some chilies in it.
Yum, yum, yum.
So we're gonna try it both ways.
And you know they're duck eggs
because they are much
larger than a chicken egg.
So you can see the difference
in size between the two eggs.
Duck. Chicken.
But I've heard that balut also can be made
with chicken eggs as well,
but ducks are traditional.
So there's an airspace either
on the top or the bottom
of the egg.
I'm just gonna try the top.
I think it's on the other side, so,
(egg cracks)
Yes.
Do you hear that sharp crack?
That means there is the airspace below.
Like that.
And you don't want to
make the opening too large
because there's soup in there.
And that's what we're going to sip out.
A little bit of membrane...
and you can take a little bit of salt
and drink that soup up.
Here we go.
Itadakimasu!
Mm.
Tastes like chicken soup!
Chicken broth is slightly eggy,
but that little bit of salt -- delicious!
Now we're gonna continue
peeling back the shell.
And you can see some of
the egg yolk in there.
Now the egg yolk is
what the embryo feeds on
while it's developing.
A bit graphic, I know, but it's food.
And so many people love
this and it is a tradition
and one that a lot of
people take pride in.
The shell is much harder than
a chicken egg -- it's thicker.
And there's the balut.
I'm gonna have my first
bite with a bit of salt.
Itadakimasu!
It's eggy.
It tastes a bit of
chicken, but it's tender.
Really full kind of chickeny
protein flavor to it,
and very, very soft texture.
It's delicious.
That was just with a little bit of salt.
Now let's try it with a bit
of chili and palm vinegar.
Just right on top.
Mm.
Mm.
I really like it with the vinegar.
The vinegar, adds some
acidity, some added complexity.
It cuts some of the
richness of the egg yolk
And that chili in there --
a little bit of heat. So good!
Now we're coming to the
bottom of the balut.
This is pretty much it.
And this portion, which is very hard --
it's so hard and rubbery and bouncy --
oftentimes this is discarded
because it's so hard.
It's completely edible, but it
doesn't have too much flavor.
And it's very, very firm,
almost like a rubber ball.
So there you have it.
That's how you cook,
prepare and eat balut,
a very simple, easy, nutritious,
and much loved street food
from the Philippines.
If you ever have an opportunity to try it,
I would highly recommend it
just to have the experience
of trying it and perhaps
understanding a little bit more
about another culture.
Thanks so much for watching.
I hope you enjoyed that one.
I hope you learned something.
