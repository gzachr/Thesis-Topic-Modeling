What's happening, beautiful people.
Good morning to you Jabbari here hey,
we're five days away from the Christmas
holiday and there's a lot of strong
traditions with Christmas and foods like ham,
Turkey sides like potato and green beans.
Help me out, Frank,
you name it, thank you.
But not everybody goes that route.
You know what I mean?
So I'm bright side.
We talked about vegan holiday meals and some
of the dishes for Puerto Rican celebration.
So this morning we go to Manila
eats in Riverview where Chef and.
Owner Veronica cooks up two
Filipino staples that you
can add to your dinner table.
We are at Manila eats.
I decided to open to cater for the
growing Filipino community in the area.
We do offer authentic Filipino food
and this is one of the dishes that
actually we served during the holidays,
which is what we call the lumpia.
So this is the ground pork.
So what we do with the ground pork is
we're going to mix it with the soy sauce.
Mix it with garlic.
Onion and carrots.
We're going to marinate this for
at least one to two hours. We
use the piping bag. And then by using the
cookie dough cutter, this actually going
to seal your lumpia WADA.
Yeah one good looking lumpia
and now it's ready for frying.
The dish that we're going to serve also
is very popularly called pancit bihon.
Pancit is rice stick noodles cooked with
veggies and shredded chicken with soy sauce.
Having these dishes in your table,
especially during the holidays,
it brings back the memories and the
the thoughts of being
back in the Philippines.
You know it, it's good if it looks good
at 4:00 in the morning. Manila eats.
Cal guys opened up back in May 2020
during the height of the pandemic,
but they've attracted Filipinos
from all around and even people from
all different walks of life come
from places like Miami Fort Myers.
There's even somebody who came from
Alabama to get a taste of Filipino food,
and you can see other chefs and
traditional meal ideas on our website,
including the ones that we did last week.
