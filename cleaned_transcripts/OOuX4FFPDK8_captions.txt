it wasn't that long ago when couples who 
have a substantial age gap was frowned  
upon in the philippine society however 
in the current philippine dating scene  
filipina foreigner couples with a considerable 
age difference have slowly become a norm  
in fact for many older foreign bachelors 
younger filipinas are ideal brides  
so why do mature foreign men seek true love on 
the philippines well it might have something to  
do with the fact that filipinas are ideal lifetime 
companions these women are capable of giving and  
sustaining love which transcends age and race 
filipinas are true romantics and this makes  
them fearless when it comes to love they believe 
that love is limitless and knows no boundaries  
this makes them willing to give relationships 
their all and go well beyond their comfort zone to  
seek and maintain it for the beautiful filipinas 
age is just a number when it comes to love  
they typically prefer men who are older 
than them fortuiously more men also prefer  
to marry younger women so if you are an older 
gentleman a filipina might just be your perfect  
match age differential theory hypothesizes that 
younger women older men relationships will occur  
because men want a woman who's 
young and is fertile to conceive  
this theory also states that women prefer someone 
who's already mature and stable this theory also  
explains why filipinas tend to embrace romantic 
relationships with foreign men much older than  
them filipinas in general are more accepting of 
this type of relationship and aren't bothered by  
a huge age difference if your desire is to date 
a filipina don't hesitate due to fear that your  
age might be viewed unfavorably here are just 
a few reasons why you should set your mind at  
ease filipinas don't mind an age difference 
between them and their foreign partners  
to them age is associated with experience and 
maturity they believe mature men are far more  
knowledgeable and wise they also believe that 
older partners can impart many more significant  
lessons to them in life filipinas think that older 
men are more open-minded and patient for filipinas  
older men also have a broader perspective 
and a clearer picture of how the world works  
they understand a wide array of situations and 
are capable of adapting to any circumstances  
furthermore filipinas believe 
that maturity breeds patience  
unlike younger and less experienced men who 
are more likely to act on impulse filipinos  
know that older men are more adept at making 
calculated and well thought of decisions  
filipinas put little to no emphasis on age when 
it comes to relationships they don't consider this  
a factor that would detract from success of love 
what is more important to them is trust commitment  
and genuine love for the ladies of the philippines 
these are the qualities that define the course  
of a relationship not their partner's age but 
filipinas are the kind of women that tend to look  
past superficial attributes they look at the inner 
characteristics of their man the fact that divorce  
has yet to be legalized in the philippines makes 
filipinas extremely discerning in choosing their  
husbands due to the uniqueness of the filipino 
culture they are more concerned with compatibility  
and chemistry than they are with your age they 
want someone who can be their partner for life  
these are the reasons why filipinas are the most 
sought after brides for older men from around the  
globe once you are in a romantic relationship 
with these women you can expect them to be far  
more interested regarding your inner qualities 
than your superficial characteristics filipinas  
would prefer to settle down with someone who has 
the same beliefs as them regarding love marriage  
and family life they want a man of substance 
because for them wisdom and maturity are sexy
