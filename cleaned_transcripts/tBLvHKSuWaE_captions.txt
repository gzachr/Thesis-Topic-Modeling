But enough promotion let's get on to the video and with that
I want to know what is the most exotic place that you could visit let me know down there hughey Hawaii
100% yeah, so the philippines in our last video
We mentioned quite a bit
So if we miss any cool facts in this video be sure to check out our first one because we probably
Mentioned it there, but one thing we didn't mention is how the country is the second largest exporter of?
coconuts your coconut [van] you definitely want to go to the [philippines] because the philippines exports a
as a matter of fact in 2009 they exported 19 million five hundred
thousand tons of the fruit and reports say that 25 percent of the cultivated land is
dedicated to coconuts which equals 3.6 million hectares and anywhere between 25 to 33 percent of the
Population depend on coconut farming sales shipping and distribution as their income
But that is not the only thing that the philippines has exported you could say that a philippines theoretically
Exported the yo-yo although the yo-yo originally comes from Either Chinese or greek
origins the Yo-yo became popular [in] the 19th century all because of
Pedro flores who was an inventor who traveled to the United states in 1928 to start his yo-yo company?
But the word yo-yo is said to come from the Filipino ilocano word yo-yo, which means come back and speaking about languages
Let's actually talk about the languages of the philippines the philippines has many native tongues currently it [has] eight major native
Languages which are be called Soriano [here] gained an Electron. [oh] cap'n Penguin?
Pangasinan Tagalog and [soir√©e] now Tagalog and English are the two most popular?
languages throughout the country, but including these languages - English they say there is anywhere between
[120] to
175 native languages throughout the country and unfortunately [for] them are no longer in use but as for these languages most of them
Are malaya Polynesian in descent except for [Sheva] Cano which has [creole] origins?
So let's move on and let's talk about Volcanoes
Because the philippines has quite a few of them and one of the most active volcanoes is the Volcano of tao now
Ironically it is on a island called Volcano
Island and although it is one of the smallest active volcanoes in the world it is a special volcano because it is one of 17
Volcanoes that is listed as a decade volcano
Now these volcanoes are watched closely by scientists throughout the world the reason for this is because of their history
Proximity to population and many other features that scientists look for in order to prevent future catastrophes and since
1572 tail has had over 33 dock
Interruptions, but one of most fascinating things about this volcano is not just size and the amount of eruptions has had its crater lake
Which may only be 20 meters deep and good for swimming?
But it's cool, because it's a lake within a lake within a lake and really quite bizarre to see now in [sidon]
We're talking about Volcanoes
Let's talk about [Cammie], Guin Island although
the Island May only have
238 Square [kilometres]
It has more volcanoes than cities with a population of over eighty eight thousand four hundred people and the island itself has seven
Volcanoes and five towns making it the island with the most amount of volcanoes per square kilometre
Unfortunately none of them have blown except for mount Ibaka back which was in 1953
But one thing when it comes to the philippines have you ever heard of jellyfish [linked] you probably have because it's world-famous
It is a small Lake on the Island
Il Mount that stretches over
14 Acres
And is 30 meters deep and the reason
It's called Jellyfish Lake is because it's home to a lot of jellyfish Roughly 12 million jellyfish to be exact with only two species
known as the Moon jellyfish and the Golden Jellyfish
The Lake itself is a saltwater lake and it is one of 50 lakes in Palau that is open to the public
which you can pay
$100 to visit however Scuba diving is totally prohibited because the bubbles actually do damage to the jellyfish and although you're swimming with
Jellyfish it is completely safe to snorkel
This is because although the lake may be connected to the ocean for the past 12,000 years. It has been listed as a self-contained
Ecosystem where the Jellyfish have had their sting become diluted and when it comes to aquatic life we got to talk about the philippines Trench
Located east off the Island of Mindanao. It is the third Deepest Trench in the world stretching a total of
1320 Kilometers long by 30 kilometers wide and ten thousand five hundred and Forty-five meters deep
Beating the [corral] can check a trench by only three meters and although it is listed as a subduction zone
Where tectonic plates are colliding into another it has not caused any large earthquakes since the 1600s
[now] the land of the philippines is fantastic
What about its people let's talk about vernon and markos who was the first president [elected] of the philippines he ran from?
1965 to
1986 with a corrupt dictatorship
But was the first and only person to be elected twice in the philippines however during his second term he declared martial law on
September 21st
1972 thus extending his limited two-term presidency
but however martial law didn't stay in the philippines forever when it ended in the
1970s the first philippine parliamentary election was held on April 7th
1978 in Which Ferdinand also won becoming the [prime] [Minister] however no Sooner after that [on] June 6
1981 the Country held another presidential election and guess what that's right
He won the presidency for a third term but without getting into too much detail [about] his presidency one of the most interesting things about
him well this is death because he died on september 28th 1989 however in
1993 which was four years after his death his body was returned to the philippines and put on ice [for] preservation and until
2016 they didn't know what to do with his body until
There was a vote where [50%] of the voters decided that they should bury his body
but many decades later after his death on November 18
2016 he was finally buried to rest at the heroes [cemetery] of the philippines now in the philippines
You can't go far without seeing one of these vehicles these are called Jeepneys
They're the most popular method of transportation around the philippines
but these vehicles
Came from the Willys jeeps from the second world [war] at the end of the war when the united States troops were leaving they ended
up abandoning or either selling the jeeps to the locals of the country and since then it's become a symbol of their culture and
community as people decorate these things for their personal and public use and as a matter of fact the first GP was shown at the
World's [Fair] in 1964 at the Philippine exhibit and throughout the years they've made many modifications to the original Jeep
But if you still want [to] get one of the old Willys Jeep yourself you can contact MD1
enterprises in Manila who make an exact replica of the old
1940s jeep now [the] Philippines is also a country that's progressing to be a bigger country than it actually is
And in 2014 it had some pretty interesting moments as in april of that year
They legalized birth control for all of its people
But ironically enough that same year in july a baby girl was born
[making] her the hundred million Filipino [her] name is Jenna Lynn Santino
[and] she's one of a hundred other babies born around the same time in the country who have given this
historical title and because of birth control and her births it marked a major change in [the] politics of the country although [she] was a
Celebration of life she was also a celebration of choice as the country for the last years had suffered a major
[population] increase with the health department hoping to reduce the population
Increase in order to reduce the Poverty line and health for woman giving birth
[and] with the introduction of birth control it marked an important time when the philippines fought against the catholic ideals fighting for pro-choice
Allowing its citizens to make Their own
Decisions in their life and last but not least probably one of the most amazing things about the country [is] the philippines is the second
largest geothermal producer in the world
but it is the largest consumer of energy from geothermal sources at
17 to 18 [percent] of their power needs are covered by geothermal energy and in total they produce over
1904 Megawatts a year
But if you were to throw that in [with] the other renewable energies that the country has renewable energy makes up
26% of the Country's need so there you [have] it guys
It's amazing to talk about how the philippines is a great country and how it's progressing for the future
