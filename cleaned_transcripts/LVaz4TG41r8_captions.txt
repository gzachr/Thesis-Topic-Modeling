good morning good morning my friends 
and welcome back to another video and  
in today's video guys we are waking 
up at the crack of dawn we've got  
Ian right out here. Ian how are you hey 
hey hey there he is nice to meet you
I'm a [__] yeah okay I'm good 
awesome awesome in the back sweet okay
yeah guys so Ian and I have actually been working 
together on editing videos for like a year and a  
half now and or almost two years now I think 
in May of 2021 and so uh he's from uh Quezon  
City yeah that's right that's right yeah yeah 
so we finally made it work while I'm here in  
the Philippines to meet up so we're gonna go on a 
special Adventure today yeah yeah yeah so what's  
the plan for today then then so we're gonna we're 
gonna travel just outside Manila around one and a  
half hours and we're going to this special 
place to have breakfast and then have the  
everything goes perfect yeah that sounds great 
let's do it all right guys we are uh cruising  
now the uh light is starting to come up with 
the sun's starting to come up so we can see  
a bit more of Manila we've got one hour and 
19 minutes we're gonna be cruising and you  
can see the city skyline and in what part 
of like what city is this on the left side
okay so that's not like a sub city of 
Manila that's like proper Manila yeah that's
uh in a few seconds action will 
be in Makati oh Makati okay  
yeah and makata is a BGC that's the most 
modern yeah yeah BGC yeah yeah sweet
you guys to look from outside
yeah guys and so the place we're taking the 
trip out to is a pretty Common Place Ian was  
telling me for uh people to go on like weekend 
trips in Manila like a weekend getaway you know  
it's not too far from Manila but you're gonna 
get grades Vibes we're gonna have a delicious  
breakfast to start out at place in those 
yeah yeah you've been a couple times I'm  
assuming yeah yeah just just once and just once 
okay before okay so it's been a while then yeah  
sweet sweet so I'm excited for this we're gonna 
have lots of fun guys doing some exploring today  
and uh we'll probably learn a lot more about 
the Philippines that we didn't know before  
because obviously you guys have seen the videos 
coming up leading to this we've done a lot of  
exploring of Manila, Chinatown uh you know all 
down by the water uh by Dolomite Beach but uh  
now we get to spend some quality time with Ian 
here and learn so much more about some of the  
Cities here in the outskirts of the Manila area 
so let's do this so this one colomba is the last  
City in the Metro Manila that's the that's 
the that's the that's the town in the first  
Province oh first Province yeah it's it's the 
boundary of Metro Manila and uh Laguna the  
province is called Laguna Laguna okay and how 
many provinces are there in in the main island
I can't remember I'm not sure but per regions 
in the main island of Luzon there are three  
main island groups Luzon, visayas in Mindanao 
yeah in Luzon you have five regions so we're  
going south so uh South consists of of 
three regions 4A, 4B and five okay  
wow so yeah a lot and there's is it 7,000 or 17 
000 islands in the Philippines. Seven thousand plus  
seven thousand plus yeah that's a lot and is there 
any Filipino person who's been to all of them  
I think so yeah wow really I think so 
well that would be an incredible goal yeah
the downtown area of it yeah
foreign
the last City before uh going 
out of Manila oh good cool  
yeah well this guy just shows you how far Manila 
stretches and keep in mind it is 6 40 a.m we've  
been going at a cruising speed with pretty much no 
traffic this whole time we left almost 30 minutes  
ago and we're still in the greater Manila area so 
that just gives you an idea of how stretched and  
spread out this city is it's it's incredible like 
it just goes to show if you truly want to explore  
this place you need like five months just for the 
greater Manila area to check out the what is it 16  
cities in the Manila greater yeah 17 cities yeah 
yeah so it's it's absolutely mind-blowing guys  
just uh so so cool Skyway that we're on right 
now which you know looks very familiar to like  
road infrastructure where you know that you'll see 
in Europe you'll see in the United States like uh  
you know very very similar in terms of like the 
general design has just opened in the last uh  
I did last summer last summer okay so like as in 
2022 something yeah wow all right so it's you know  
just revolutionizes everything guys because before 
it was all that congestion going through these  
cities to get through here now there's basically 
straight shots that bring you above the city  
and you think there's going to be more and more 
projects like this going through Manila definitely  
uh they're thinking about uh you saw the river 
right yeah beside binondo yeah yeah I think about  
building one on top of the river oh wow so you go 
from West uh right where the the beaches are the  
white beaches the the embassies yeah that's the 
West that's the west Western part yeah and then  
when you go to the eastern part uh that's where 
the river traverses and then they plan to build a  
a Skyway above it wow so the folks from the 
Eastern Park can go to the to the western part  
vice versa uh faster yeah that'll be a huge change 
yeah amazing so guys on this uh trip to get out  
here it's probably I think that was our third or 
maybe a fourth toll and the tolls range between  
like 60 to 200 per uh toll so uh what Ian's 
telling me is because well especially before  
these uh new highway infrastructure projects 
were completed you know uh or even now probably  
still with traffic you know if we went at rush 
hour it's going to take three hours before the  
infrastructure projects what would it take like 
four or five hours yeah so you know to go such a  
uh well not that long of a distance but in such a 
congested area and so now with these new projects  
you can get there much faster like I was telling 
you about and if you choose the right times like  
we did you know leaving at 6 a.m. from the Binando 
area you can actually get here in a reasonable  
amount of time and and actually make a day trip 
out of it and so that works out but most people  
that are coming out here will usually at least 
stay for one night and so we'll get a good idea  
of what this place is like today and then in a 
future video hopefully we'll come back here and  
maybe stay the night in one of the hotels so we 
are cruising through the province of Cavite as  
you can see uh salamat [__] so that's uh thank 
you is that because we're leaving the district  
I'm leaving and then entering so it's obviously a 
much different type of road that we're on now and  
the interesting part I wasn't filming it before 
but we were going through this small little uh  
you know Town Center Village and Ian's telling 
me that like you know the locals are just you  
know now getting used to what was once probably a 
quiet road is now an incredibly busy road because  
of that new infrastructure project so there's a 
lot of traffic in order to get to what's the name  
of the city, we're going to again yeah so to get to 
Tagaytay now this new route to get there you know  
brings you through some of these side streets and 
so there's just a lot more going on and so they're  
they're right now in the Philippines trying to 
figure out how they can expand some of these roads  
just to make room for this additional traffic 
we're starting to get an idea of where we're going  
because the terrain over here is pretty hilly and 
so I think we're gonna have some amazing views I  
know absolutely nothing about this I think Ian's 
saving it for surprise the only thing you told  
me before he picked me up was bring your drone so 
that just gives you an idea of what we're about to  
see we're about 17 minutes out but you can see it 
now versus like uh just a couple minutes ago here  
in the video about 20 minutes ago for us it was 
kind of the small little windy roads now we've  
got a four-lane road here two lanes each way and 
lots of local shops starting to see some larger  
advertisements and you know if that's a big sign 
right there uh you know pun intended you got a  
McDonald's sign and I'm sure we're going to see a 
lot of the other big chains which usually means if  
you've got a lot of big chains we're going to have 
a lot of other like tourist related attractions in  
this area right when we drive in we're already 
seeing a mall it looks like we're gonna we're  
gonna be entering in kind of like the Town 
Center oh we've got an older style car here too
oh wow whoa so are these like volcanic mountains 
right here yeah that's right wow that's incredible  
that is amazing guys we're gonna be 
seeing some beautiful views today  
that is awesome I'm already wishing we were 
I was staying here for at least a couple days
look at this guys we've got this old 
style car here looks like an old Jaguar  
still in perfected condition all right guys 
we're arriving right here to Antonio's which  
has been around since 2003 and let me 
just tell you one of the observations  
I was just mentioning to Ian here is just uh 
how amazing the views are so I bet the views  
and the volcano views from here are going to 
be just absolutely mind-blowing and I'm so  
hungry you guys could probably tell my eyes 
are still a little bit tired even after some  
time here I'm gonna get a nice cup of coffee 
to wake me up you get that energy back foreign
looks like it's uh pretty busy today 
that's how you know it's a good restaurant  
yeah there's a lot of people so now that 
we're here I'll put in perspective so we  
were right here in Chinatown and we went all the 
way down here and you can just see right there how  
interesting these land formations are because 
you got tall Lake well that's gonna be uh so  
so cool to check this place out all right guys 
we are coming up to Antonio's now salamat kuya
thank you
so am I pronouncing uh salamatron 
Salama Salama Salama okay wow  
and look at this guys a Fresh Bakery 
oh that bread smells incredible  
um and look at this like fresh Bagels there 
too pepperoni on there oh this is incredible
okay long thank you hello oh look at this 
fresh bread that looks incredible oh my gosh
wow wow I think Ian has brought me to the 
best restaurant in the whole area yeah he's  
the best it's the best restaurant yeah the 
best one in the entire area yeah perfect I  
know Yuli nice to meet you wow look at this 
guys and right up here we have beautiful  
paintings and almost like in the size of 
wall murals here surrounding this area  
and it looks like the ice cream options as 
well dark chocolate raisin cookies and cream  
that looks so freaking good and also right over 
here even more options Rocky Road apple crumble
hello oh mango here too that is 
that is definitely a favorite  
oh good this is gonna be such a good experience 
okay hello hello good morning how are you okay
Okay so we've got a nice 
seat right here with views
okay shut this down right here
you guys you can see this is a cool setup 
here I don't think I've ever sat in a chair  
that has like this wire figure like this oh so it 
looks like we uh scanned the QR code for the menu
and let's see here
[Music]  
was that from the QR code no
foreign
oh there we go we've got it pulled up here 
Chef's top picks we have smoked salmon  
Benedict Bagels oh this oh this looks amazing 
guys and I am super super hungry I made sure to  
um not eat too late last night since we were 
waking up early I wanted to make sure I had a uh  
really big appetite and so we're 
gonna have to try out probably
ham and cheese bacon and cheese hand rolled 
croissants freshly baked pancakes oh this is this  
is unbelievable and this will be my first time 
having a breakfast like this in the Philippines  
even pizzas here too for lunch options we've 
got Burgers pastas and then of course there's  
a better look at the ice creams that we saw 
right when we were walking in and milkshakes wow
never been better uh yes please can I 
have actually what's your most popular  
uh breakfast for the best Sunday the popular or 
the rice meal we have the beef tapa the fresh  
garlic and also the homemade okay yeah 
so The Corned Beef fresh corn beef okay
that sounds fantastic can I please have that a 
fresh one sorry for the egg how would you like it
yes please and then do you have a cold coffee 
yes yeah perfect I'll do like a iced latte yeah  
and then cookies and cream milkshake oh yeah yeah 
knows I'm getting all this stuff you know I'm  
gonna have to work out after this but well worth 
it but uh yeah I have the you know sauteed yes
garlic rice that's it so let me repeat the  
order one freshwater with potato and 
then Iceland cream milkshake perfect
thank you so we've got some bread 
that I served salamat from China  
thank you well thank you so much so as 
you can see here guys we've got a nice  
big slice of bread and that was like the 
fresh dough was the smell that Ray when  
we walked in it just like brings that smell 
of breakfast right in so we're gonna butter  
this thing up and give it a taste so the 
food has arrived Salama at the Alvin oh
this looks incredible so you which one did you 
get again sauteed corned beef look at that that  
is a very beautiful looking breakfast and over 
here guys we have my roast beef with some big  
slices of potatoes some eggs and then we got the 
toast buttered up because of course I think the  
best way to eat this toast is with the eggs on 
there so let's go ahead and feast oh yeah oh and  
one of the best parts that's for me thank you 
Mark oh wow I gotta taste that thing right away
me too oh that's incredible it's 
like a buttery ice cream Oreo flavor  
we're gonna have some full 
bellies after this thank you Mark
okay so let's go ahead and dig in yum so I'm 
gonna try out a piece of this corned beef  
right there and this just reminds me like 
guys I eat this in the United States for  
mainly for like special meals like usually I'll 
have corned beef and maybe like Thanksgiving or  
on the you know December holiday times so to 
have it in the Philippines as like part of the  
standard breakfast is uh pretty interesting for 
me and it looks delicious I'm so ready [Music]
oh wow that is that is so mother up so so good 
yeah guys as you can see it's cooked perfectly
right there just basically when you take 
a bite out of that falls apart right in  
your mouth I'm no corned beef expert but 
straight away I'll give that a 10 out of 10.
wow how's yours over there Annie yeah so good 
yeah and went with the stir fry there that one's  
mixed in with what potatoes and onions or yeah 
there's lots of onions oh yeah so garlic even oh  
garlic just like just like the how most Filipino 
households cook it yeah I can see some tomatoes  
and so this is like a daily meal you'll have 
this like breakfast almost daily almost daily  
oh that's really nice yeah but differences we 
have it in cans yeah yeah yeah it was like fresh  
the fresh way yeah yeah so you can taste a big 
difference then that's right that's right that's  
right oh wow so guys we're gonna move on to the 
potatoes here test this one out it's a nice like  
thick potato and it's covered with uh it looks 
like a bunch of different uh spices on it here
wow so basically you've got like an outer 
layer that gives it this crunch on the inside  
obviously you have that chew that you expect 
when you bite into a thick potato like that  
but that outside crunch the spices on there 
a match made in heaven for the taste buds
oh incredible thank you sir yeah thank you 
thank you just let me know thank you so much  
wow all right now we've gotta 
make a move over to the eggs here  
we're gonna pull off a piece and we're 
gonna do this the American way my friends
put that egg right there on the coast
gonna get maybe a little messy here but  
that's going to get us the uh 
infused flavors of the bread
oh my God egg is cooked perfectly  
you take a bite into that the egg yolk just 
drains right there into the bread sheeps in and  
when you take a bite of it you can just feel that 
chewiness of the bread and the yolk becoming one
um
and do people ever make like a breakfast 
sandwich out of this like roast beef egg  
then you mix them all together all right 
we're gonna have to try that one out  
so we're gonna call this guys a Filipino 
breakfast sandwich here with a mix of it all
[Music] phenomenal hands down 
the best meal I've now had in  
the Philippines since I arrived well 
very very good selection Ian so good
and then last but not least guys we got to try 
out the iced coffee here so we've got the shot  
of sugar we're gonna just dump that right in 
there see it infusing in oh it's broke the straw
all right let's give it a taste here
oh yeah that big shot of sugar 
really really sweetened it up there  
strong coffee good flavors and Ian's telling me 
that coffee beans are local to this area and so  
you get the coffee like literally as fresh 
as you can imagine that you can get coffee  
so we're gonna head to the market 
here in a little bit after the  
meal and we might even be able to buy 
ourselves some coffee beans over there
so guys we're making some good progress through 
the meal here and I was just saying to Ian that  
the portion sizes here are massive I mean 
literally we had multiple slabs of the uh  
The Corned Beef two eggs a slice of bread 
probably like three or four fourths of a  
full potato so almost I guess one full potato 
though yeah I'm gonna be so full like filled  
up after this I think I ordered slightly too 
much but hey always got room for that milkshake
that ice cream is rich so rich and yeah the 
unique part about this ice cream versus other  
ice cream I've had in the Philippines 
as I said at the beginning of when I  
got that milkshake it's like slightly 
more buttery but it's got like a nice  
like unique flavor to it I really like it you 
can tell it's like a gourmet type of ice cream
so guys for a ble to eat here at the 
restaurant it comes out to about uh
2000 uh pesos here so 2,000 pesos is uh about 36 
US dollars so really good price very gourmet meal  
thank you to Ronald and the staff for a very 
Maserat [__] meal thank you so much I really  
appreciate it salamat will be back again here 
all right thank you very much let's do it again  
thank you take care nice to meet you all right 
so we're gonna head out to the uh back area
we've got a whole nother area 
to eat down here all right  
big tables too and so right down here this is 
like the Garden area oh wow I didn't expect  
it to be like this there's like a whole bar down 
there picnic tables and a massive breakfast sign  
that's beautiful guys and look at this this 
is the first view we get to see of this area  
volcano that is the volcano so guys right there 
is the volcano wow and it was just three years ago  
that erupted It's actually an active volcano and 
there used to be Ian was telling me locals living  
on this island and they're no longer allowed to 
because it's still an active volcano and uh Ian  
was also telling me that basically there were 
tours to go over there and the day it erupted  
the guide was like uh feeling the ground shake 
maybe similar to an earthquake any his intuition  
knew something was wrong and so him and the 
tourists you know quickly got out of there  
and they made it out no casualties or anything 
but just goes to show you you just never know  
um I can't see any smoke or steam coming 
from it from here if I look really closely  
I want to say I can see a little steam 
but it might just be my mind thinking  
I can see it but uh yeah just such a 
such a gorgeous Viewpoint here I mean  
look at this and I'm guessing you can come here 
at night also for a beer you've got overhead  
lighting as well and so that is where we 
just enjoyed our meal my friends [Music]  
oh
foreign [Music]
so guys as you probably saw there from 
the Drone shots incredible scenery here  
and it's just amazing to be disclosed to a 
volcano and uh so awesome that Ian's showing  
me this side of the Philippines because 
like for tourists you know you think of  
like Boracay I think El NATO you think of pot 
you know Palawan [__] all of these different  
places and you know you don't ever think 
to come see the lake in the volcano so to  
come up here and experience a place that 
not as many foreigners go to is uh such a  
cool experience so don't get me wrong we're 
definitely gonna make content in the islands  
too my friends but you know it's fun to do some 
things that not as many people visit as well so
