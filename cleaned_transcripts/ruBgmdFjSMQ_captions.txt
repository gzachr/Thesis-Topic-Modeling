quite a while now
learning could be quoted because i've
been just watching anime
that's okay also asking suzu a bunch of
things like how do you say this how do
you say that
so she taught me the phrase and it's
been working great i'm enjoying it too
actually
really yeah i thought i was bothering
her but this is for the better of our
relationship so that when i go to japan
i can actually converse with people but
yeah i'm gonna try to speak to her in
japanese the entire day
using my handy dandy best friend google
translate
yay i'm so excited please respond to me
in english
okay but sometimes japanese i use the
japanese that you know only
