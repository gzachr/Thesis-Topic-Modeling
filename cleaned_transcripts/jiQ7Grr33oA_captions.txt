-i can see the melted sugar
lets try this
smooth
it is difficult to choose
-i m not
-me neither
bbada is thick
but butter coconut is smooth
I thought korean snack would be better this time
(but it's not)
korean snacks disapointed me haha
poor korean snacks..
similar taste but different texture
i already decided
me too
how about you?
hmm.. difficult
i know its similar
there are differences
but i m struggling with the pros and cons
i agree
ok
let's vote
butter coconut
vs
bbada coconut
1 2 3
no abstention?
-choose one!
both have similar taste and names
filipino is much smoother
easy to eat
i also think it tastes similar
filipino snack is sweater and feels softer
stop eating smith
which one?
-bawang
i forgot my comments because of you
my dudes fight again
so what?
-so filipino snack is better
sweet, smooth
both of them are similar so i chose a familiar korean snack
i remembered my childhood
why do u eat bawang? you said chicken pop is delicious 
-cuz korean snack can be eaten at any time
ok. stay focus guys
did u went buffet again?
no its just mine
so i swam hard
ok its last one
fudgee barr
vs
outte
u know that both are delicious
these days fudgee barr feels more familiar
-oh cuz you ate it often?
look at this package
outte is longer
let's try korean first

-me too
cuz its expensive
-yes it is
hey wtf

outte has no cream. unlike fudgee barr
instead there is chocolate at the bottom
look at this
he spilled powder

i saw everything you did 
i have eyes in the back of my head
don't spill dude
fudgee barr
and next , filipino fudgee barr
looks so nice
it looks better then outte
i agree
let's try it
cheers
ah paper
its difficult too
yes
fudgee barr is thicker than i thought
cuz i ate outte before

philippines7:2 korea
right?
korea won't beat philippines even if we all choose korea
i decided
its difficult to choose
i think so
you guys decided?
i did
i need time
i need to eat one more outte
i think you re trying to eat a lot
-no its difficult to choose so.
r u ready guys?
fudgee barr
vs 
outte
1 2 3
why did you choose fudgee barr
first i thought outte is better &smoother
but when i compared fudgee and outte
fudgee was more delicious
fudgee has deep flavor
so u choose fudgee barr
yes. better than outte
i choose outte because 
outte is smoother than fudgee barr
so i choose outte
i think outte is smoother but
fudgee has deeeeeeep flavor
taste like chocolate cake
Philippines 9:3 korea
philippines has won!!
congrat to ph
we must celebrate the winner
we chose it honestly
and filipino snacks gonna winner
i thought it would be a similar score
but its not
so how was it smith?
first all of filipino cookies are delicious
filipino snacks have their own character
i want to eat it often
i think 
korean-weak flavor
filipino-strong flavor
thats's all
that's why i chose filipino snacks
i think korean snacks are good enough
it would have been delicious if we didn't eat filipino snacks
in summary
filipino snacks are much better , and suitable to us
but korean snacks are good enough
agree
yes
okay then today.
ah yummy
ok then see you next time and
??
