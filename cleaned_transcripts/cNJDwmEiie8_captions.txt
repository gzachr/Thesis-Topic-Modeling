thank you good afternoon from Cebu and check 
out what I just rented for the next two weeks  
I'm going to have my own motorbike I'm very 
happy about that and yeah we're going to start  
a road trip around Cebu Island not today but 
tomorrow so in the next episode we're going  
that was done oh my God I thought it's going 
to fall oh my God no everything safe oh  
yeah I'm still in Cebu and I will not leave the 
city today we're going to do that in the next  
video so tomorrow and but I just got the motorbike 
and I just came to this place here to uh try  
one of the most popular and most recommended 
dishes here in the Philippines called lechon  
to quiet today and actually I didn't plan to get 
the bike already today I just went by the shop  
and asked if I can see it why 
does the helmet not fit in here
um
wow oh what's going on over there I see all 
the other bikes also have the helmets just  
hanging here so it should be safe and yeah 
I didn't plan to get the motorbike today  
just wanted to have it tomorrow and see you 
today but then I thought oh you can just take  
it for today as well no problem without extra 
payments so happy days and yeah if you watched  
my channel already last year in Thailand you 
may be recognize the bike it's the same bike  
that I also had last year for four months in 
Northern Thailand Yamaha airwalks 155 but more  
details about that in the next episode when 
we probably start the road trip um hello hello
I think it's okay to leave the helmets here 
because there's actually a security guard here  
to check the bikes or to take care of
what's happening over there
he's blowing the hole the 
whole time okay uh recall
okay thank you very much  
I go there okay thank you thank you and so yeah 
I'm going to try lichon I try to lead Sean before  
maybe you remember my first impressions video in 
Manila I tried it there but it was in a soup and  
many of you guys in the comment section told me 
that's not the proper way to eat lechon I need to  
try the proper lechon so I did some research and 
I came across two different places here in Cebu  
one is called House of Legend and one is called 
Rico's lechon and I heard these two are the most  
popular places to eat with John here and then I 
asked some locals which of these two places is the  
better one and every local set the Rico's lechon 
is the better one so I'm curious to try that one
and I think it's here very cool Legend if you 
don't know what a snitch one all I know so  
far is that it's pork everything else we're 
here to find out this way to main door okay
oh looks like like a nice food court here 
actually or maybe like a little business area here
and then we have cebu's best Rico's 
Legend okay let me put on my knife
oh first thing I see here is this 
oh that looks super good already
hello I would like to I don't 
know I would like to eat lechon
one person here
is it possible to sit outside yeah yeah okay
I can sit and then choose yeah 
okay you can go out here okay
okay
let me sit here what what can you recommend I 
never tried later on before but many people tell  
me it's very very good in the Philippines yeah 
yeah so what's what is the the most important  
size one half and then one kilo or one kilo 
is probably a little bit too much for me yeah
um Okay so I'm not sure if you 
eat it with rice or if you get  
some side dishes usually or if it's 
just really all about the pork um
so you can order it as a whole like this that 
would be a feast right check it out you can get  
a large one 14 to 16.9 kilo for 10 000 pesos 
are that probably if you have like I don't  
know like a wedding or a big birthday party 
and you can probably order a whole whole pick  
which is then probably looking like this so I'm 
excited I'm very excited I'm a huge fan of meat  
so I'm really looking forward to try this one and 
is it the most popular dish in the Philippines I  
don't know it was definitely recommended a lot a 
lot in my comment section that I need to try this  
and actually Sean was I think the only dish the 
only Philippine popular dish that I already knew  
before I came here so I heard about that before 
um but anyway okay so we have 250 gram 501 kilo  
I think 250 grams sounds like a good 
portion for single guy like me here  
spicy electron I can also choose spicy and 
regular I'm gonna go with the regular one  
whenever I try new food I like to first try it 
just plain raw no sauce just I want to eat or  
taste the real meat you know so I'm just gonna try 
to try the regular version of this dish on Baka
yeah I'm wondering if you if usually order 
side dishes as well let's see what they have  
here oh hello Halo I tried that in the one 
of the previous episodes maybe you remember
maybe some rice actually let me ask 
you later again what he recommends  
so yeah I would like to get to regularly 
the 250 gram yes but I'm wondering do you  
is it like with rice or just 
a meat just the meat the rice  
is separate usually you eat a good rice 
or with noodles or vegetables here part
okay
and then okay um yeah and for the drinks 
we have the uh roast beer iced tea we have  
something that is that Filipino usually 
drink when they eat snake chunks yeah  
mostly as uh you know soft things but 
for now the soft things is not available
right now is their root beer root beer but 
it's not alcohol right yeah okay then uh
anyway in case you're wondering why I'm sitting 
outside because inside this music and I can't  
really film when there's copyrighted music 
around me YouTube doesn't like this that's  
why I'm sitting outside although it's air 
conditioned inside but actually it's not it's  
not that hot today yes okay all right I'm waiting 
for the electron now very excited you use it on  
the park oh yeah so this is vinegar and soy 
sauce okay and this is a Filipino root beer okay
I'm not sure because it's the it's a product
I'm not sure if we have it in Germany but probably  
because there's so many brands 
of root beer like that one is
here yeah okay thank you foreign
to be honest earlier this year but they're 
definitely another brand so look at this  
there's a angry looking dog under on 
the can you see it is the light okay  
that looks funny okay let me throw 
it in here looks like a Coca-Cola
am I completely like black out in my brain 
now or do we don't have to in Germany  
is it if you're watching from Germany 
you probably know might spear is it the  
same mild sphere but might be a small to be all 
right is there mold in here sugar water caramel
no I think it's not mold beer that's 
popular in Germany might sphere most beer
no I never tasted this before no
how does it taste very sweet a lot of sugar 
in there interesting but I like it actually  
it's not bad it's more like flavoring you 
can add this one a native silly okay spicy  
yeah how do you you put it over yeah you can 
put on your in here okay okay and you usually  
like I use the big plate yeah and then I mix 
it with the rice or you don't mix it yeah you  
can you can uh you can also not to mix the 
rice but you put it on here right okay okay
thank you so much okay okay
take photos oh it's okay it's okay okay thank 
you so much thank you very much okay um yeah  
so this is the lechon let me get some nice oh look 
at this even the plate is a the head from the pick  
you can see it that looks funny and so this is 
Legend and I see the the skin looks very crispy so  
I guess the the skin you eat it with the skin that 
would be my guess wow so uh let's get a thumbnail
me with the surprise face like this 
some behind the scenes you're making a  
thumbnail for the videos maybe like this 
the lighting is maybe better from here
to have different angles
what are all these YouTubers doing on 
the thumbnails like faces like this
um okay so we have to rise in here
we put the rice here
so something that I learned also from you 
guys in the comment section is that you um  
don't pour these things over the meat you put it 
inside the extra cup here and then you dip it in  
I think that's how it works so you 
basically create your own dipping sauce here
so maybe adding some of these as well
again I don't know but some of unicorns 
actually told me that uh you're normally  
supposed to do it like this so I have my own 
little dipping sauce you know I have to meet here
oh this looks very juicy oh
wow oh I think this is uh gonna be an 
amazing meal I think we have some bones here
wow wow this is tasting amazing actually 
oh my gosh definitely place you guys here  
so I can use both of my hands so we do have 
some parts here I think that you cannot eat  
some uh some bony Parts here so you have to eat 
a little bit around it but the most of it is just  
pure meat this is a meal for meat lovers okay I 
want to try the crispy skin it looks like this
super crispy I don't know if you can hear 
the cracking sounds when I'm biting on it
go check it out wow
oh my God this is amazing
and look how juicy the meat is here oh my God
and the meat is so soft I can like cut it with 
my tongue you know like I don't even need to my  
my teeth basically wow I'm wondering if you 
normally eat this with your hands that will  
be my guess now to just eat the meat with 
my hands Let's uh oh let's dip it in here
oh oh I think I used a little bit too much vinegar
that was a little bit too 
much vinegar in here I think
with some rice to a cover after the flavor
wow
I'm very close to um even say this is one of 
the best pork Roots I ever had in my life and  
in Germany we also eat a lot of pork I would say 
pork is even more popular than chicken in Germany  
but this is like perfection wow 
it's so soft juicy and tender
oh my God oh my God okay this is the first time 
I'm eating properly John in the Philippines  
maybe not the last time I'm wondering like 
does it taste as good as this one no matter  
which place I'm going to is it just because 
this is a popularly chunk place because lechon
so I will also try it in getting more regular 
spots that are not as famous and popular as  
this one but I can see myself eating this uh 
a lot amazing it was very good very masala  
oh you say here Lamy yeah right that's the 
same meaning like Masala yeah okay it was  
very good very very good it's great very Lamy yeah 
yummy you say Lamy it's yummy in a local word is
very good okay how much you get 500 I have 500.  
so this is your first time uh Davidson yeah yeah 
I I tried it before in Manila but it was in a soup  
yeah so many people tell me it was not original 
yeah so this was the first time I tried Origins
um it's okay thank you very much oh no it's 
okay it's okay thanks thank you very much
the Russian celebrities came here oh 
I would like you to see this again  
oh because yeah check it out I 
think they prepare it here every day  
um fresh of course and I like restaurants 
where you can actually see how they prepare  
the food you know so you can sit here and 
probably look how your dinner is prepared  
so yeah you can see the skull of a of a pig over 
there and so much delicious looking meat here  
yeah this is a habit for for meat lovers I would 
say okay okay thank you so much salamat thank you
