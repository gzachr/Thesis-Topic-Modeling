[Music] we just spent like 10 minutes trying
to ask for no sugar and the waiter was like
extra sugar and we were like no no sugar after
all this he came to the table and Lawrence
went extra sugar yeah and the man was like
so if you come to the Philippines or pretty
much every Asian country I think they like
things really really sweet and they put sugar
and syrup and stuff so I always ask for stuff
with no sugar and then it just tastes like
a fruit it's really nice I'm happy thank you
very much wow [Music]

very much
[Music]
[Applause]
that is exactly right that's exactly what
those are no no it's not a strong flavored
actually that's really nice yeah okay so we're
currently discussing how to get to all the
islands because a lot of them are high pain
to get to you have to go on a boat for quite
a while so we're gonna see what orders go
to the places and see where we can get blood
basically because the floods are much is that's
the research being done
this place is supposed to be the bomb I don't
know how much I love a bubble tea so this
is the Taiwanese mobile team that you can
get here so I went for the passion fruit because
it's got coconut jelly and fibroid so tasters
toasters [Music]
I said no sugar so it's not too sweet but
it's really nice and like Tangy it's got actual
pressure
