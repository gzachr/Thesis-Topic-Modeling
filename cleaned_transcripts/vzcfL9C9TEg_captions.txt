[Applause]
there is story it was written for each
of us and it's yet to be
told this is the last one it's always
the best one but first you must rid of
the
old at first it's on repeat March to the
same beat around and around like we
do they proceed to tell us darling keep
your head up go on March along like you
[Music]
do while doing our
mukbang um
we are also going to interview David oh
no we have just just random questions
right random questions about
childhood about family um intimacy also
an but first eat a little bit a
[Laughter]
little so let's talk about um family and
childhood what is your favorite family
tradition
Christmas for me also Christmas but more
in my childhood is Christmas time not
today so anymore why it's it change when
you get older but what do you change in
what way you need to be more serious and
the family is not so close
anymore you don't get so much gifts
anymore
but since I met you in the Philippines I
spent my first Christmas that's it
reminds me on my
childhood I'm very happy lot of people
lot of food lot of gifts not for me so
much that's okay but so you
already spent Christmas three times in
the Philippines yeah yeah done
2017 2018 and 19 yeah only because of Co
2020 and
2021 we cannot
yeah yeah okay good for me to Christmas
that's
my okay number two mhm what ways are you
most different from the person you were
in high
school high school long long time
ago right today I think even even I'm
funny here but this kind of serious you
need to need to be more
serious in high school what what is your
problem your problem is maybe that your
crush don't like
you maybe you want to go to the next
party but got no
budget mhm school is not so important at
this time but today you got you have a
lot of bills to pay you need a job you
need to take care of your wife a lot I
was damaged would you love me the same
would you vanish or would you not be as
sham to see me manic because he's very
shy of course I am not try
try everyone say oh you speak so
good it's
okay but even even you can still be
funny today you always need to
think for the future and that's yeah
change I think yeah even I was always a
little bit more measure maybe than
compared to some classmates or something
but yeah but every year it's get a
little little bit more
serious
yay for me um I
know like as you have as you that this a
serious for me it's like maturity
M I think it's because of your
experiences in life
also
okay next
question
um what is your favorite childhood
memory favorite childhood yeah for me
example for me
no when my father um every weekend came
home
mm and we visited uh the for Ford pillar
shrine okay that's the most special time
for me that we spend our time together
as a family wife for me something
similar my parents get divorced very
early when I was 3 years old so I often
miss my father in this
time but we visited him all two weeks at
the weekend to twice a month so and
that's what we really you have scheduled
this yeah emo mostly schedule two times
a month that be visit and that was also
a special time daddy always want to make
every wish come through to us like
unhealthy food like Co he always know
that he get us with food like today my
maybe that's the way he's showing his
love even today yeah today with food so
for us it's the same if I buy candy for
her she love me and if she cooked for me
I love her too a
so this is one big important thing
spending time with
Daddy good so it's more on our parents
yeah no our family
H let make our childhood
special next m
what did you use to enjoy doing as a kid
that is still part of your life
today for me I start very early with
playing this um like PlayStation or
before it was this Nintendo so mhm I
think it
started I got a big brother so when I
was was six seven eight years old the
first experience with this game boy at
this time something and still today I'm
enjoyed to play even it's sometimes like
something like sport games or a little
bit action games so she don't like to
and she's lucky because this second
controller is broken already so she
don't need to play with me but this is
really what I enjoy even even uh also in
reality to go out not just play on this
is like doing sport games like I love
basketball I love this football soccer
playing since I was a kid today I'm not
in this condition to play a lot you can
see but I I still love this I really
love to be active even outside but she
don't like to play with me she always
lose yeah but but it's still it's the
the virtual gaming and even the outside
I I really love still more than around
30 years already good
because for me I think I don't
have next um what food or drink most
evokes a feeling of home for you H home
of home for you like for me for example
um pork
cigam that's really an know a feeling of
home for me
mem pap
so every weekend and
then sinigang na
pork for you wait a
[Laughter]
[Music]
second
my crazy color
so my
mother always was a good Chef in the
kitchen so there's a lot of
dishes you know this feeling when you
when you get older and visit your mother
for maybe you stay overnight like us
sometimes and she's cooking something
for you and then you really feel this
childhood feeling again so one just a
simple very simple food or dish is for
example something like this meatbats
with this grounded pork potatoes and
just some vegetables like a fresh salad
or green peas something or carrots and
Mommy always she always cook like my
wife here she always cook with love and
that's what you really can taste yeah
not in a hurry not in something like you
need to cook you want to cook now so
there's a lot of other dishes but this
this is one I I really enjoy every every
time she cook yeah later there come some
other like today also the lasagna yeah
when Mommy make lasagna very yummy
everyone loves it yeah even it's the
vegetable one or just with uh also
grounded beef grounded pork it's very
yummy and always this is when I hear the
the word lasagna I always think about my
mother first yeah and then about my wife
because she also can do a good lasagna
a next question we will talk about
intimacy oh no
intimacy while eating what what is your
predominant or main element of love
language is it like Words of Affirmation
or also Quality Time or for me it's it's
always or physical touch physical
touch I think for me it's more about
this after this long relationship long
distance relationship always the biggest
uh enemy is this distance even it's it's
got a lot of good things because you
really know each other before you
meet we can
fly so I will never die that's why today
after this long distance relationship
for me one important thing is that I
always know that my partner my wife my
beautiful wife is always near to me yeah
even she will work and I'm at home but
always know ah in the evening or in the
afternoon she come home and we are
together we we got time together and
this is for me one of the most important
things that I know we are near to each
other whenever I want to talk to her I
can or even phone call but but I know
it's not far away and we will see the
next that's the same day and this is
gives me a good feeling in my heart and
makes me
happier I want to taste the fish yeah
right but it's plenty of Bones yeah you
need to get here the other side here in
this
area this so is
enough so last question name three body
parts of your partner that you like the
most first for me what I really like on
David's body part body
part first is your butt oh yeah yeah gra
why it's very white and then it's very
big and when I give you massage it's
very very
fluffy you know
you okay let's go on that's Filipino
always when when we speak English you
know
second second is his face overall your
eyes your nose your the bir you don't
like lips of course your your birth I
don't like that
one only this Tre thing and your hair of
course yeah the bir is also hair your
hair you not the bir
connect and lastly for me you're
[Music]
hard Wow Let's make Who You Are
oh yeah I will make that adorable be
chicken liver and chicken hard you can
eat yeah give it to the kid so for
me very
similar my
[Music]
[Applause]
face okay okay let me I will start first
because the first the biggest when you
make it in the order or something is the
hard
because at first I fall in love with
honestly with her heart yeah I got the
pictures Al she's very sweet at this
type I am not with anymore today oink
oink
um you are very beautiful and a little
bit more measure
today
din yeah the sweet and cute is over when
you're more older than 30 this is you
are so beautiful but not cute and
even for me no the first thing yeah is
her heart because at the beginning um in
this longdistance relationship I'm
always happy when she share with me her
childhood her how much she do for the
family and for others also and that's
why it will always be the heart at first
yeah then the second
is but the face yeah especially I I
really love the lips I I really want to
kiss them and this very cute little
nose you know it's a very good match
when you got a partner with a small and
big nose kissing there's nothing in the
way it's very good yeah to face itself
[Music]

I really appreciate it when when you
give me always this m so maybe later you
can also when you got aggressive no I'm
