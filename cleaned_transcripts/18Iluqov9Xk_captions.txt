What's up everybody my name is Hadji
this is Kevin!
Welcome to another episode of
Brown and Hungry!
Today's video is a super special video because we have
no idea of what we're eating today
- Ayyyeee!!!
- We've been on a mission visiting
different Filipino eateries trying to
explore our Filipino culture we just
felt a little out of touch with our Filipino roots
so we took it upon
ourselves to delve into the culture by
visiting different Filipino eateries and
looking into the dishes
- You're not even piercing the tape
"weird noises"
- Okay there we go.
before we open up this box lets try to guess what's in
here.
- I think its Filipino deserts.
- Well we know it's Filipino food
- Yeah
- and I know it's not balot
because balot would have gone bad by now.
and if you don't know what balot is,
it's basically a Filipino delicacy
- in which,
- That's a good way to explain it.
- Right. In which you take an unborn chicken egg...
I don't know how they prepare it
but for some reason you can eat it and
it is decent.
Paper???
- Hahaha!
- Whoaaa! What is this???
- I don't even know what this is?
- What is this?
Ri-Chee
- crunchy snack milk flavored...
- What is this?
milk flavored??? Okay???
- And there's snack...
Snacku rice crackers vegetable flavor
- Sky Flakes! Hooo!
- If you do not have this in your house...
- Oh I know what this is.
- And you're Filipino, I don't know if you're filipino.
- Sugo, I don't know this?
- Sugo, Garlic adobo peanuts.
- Oh I had that before
- I had this but maybe not like from this brand
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh from swap meet
- Oh Swap meet. Yeah, yeah.
Swap meet is this awesome thing here in
Hawaii where it takes place up to Aloha
Stadium and you basically go to exchange
and look at different like vendors they
sell different stuff like this snacks
goodies uh local within local items I
guess yeah
I want to try this the Pasencia
Oh maybe you wanna open one as well?
It's really dry yeah?
- Oh not bad.
- I don't really... Well okay...
- So you know just looking at all these different snacks
especially in a packaging like this so
was I was born in the Philippines on up north, in the Ilocals north there it's a very province
area and there wasn't a lot of like
department stores or grocery stores where
I lived and what we had was these like
makeshift mom and dad stores that were
literally on the side of the road or
operated out of someone's house and I
remember seeing snacks like this kind of
just hung up on racks on the walls of
like what they would do is they would
build a like a shack almost like this
must a small storefront right and it
would literally just sell snacks out of
the storefront and like all the kids
would come out and you know why should
one of the one of the really unique
things that I remember as a kid is that
if you wanted soda
they wouldn't put it in a can or they wouldn't like you know open up a can of soda
- and give it to you instead
- They had the bag yeah?
- Right. They would put in a plastic bag 
and then they put the straw
Ho it smells amazing!
Wow!
- Sniff test.
- Okay
- Some
- Oh it's like...
-That tastes like poke
- Really?
- Yeah that tastes like spicy ahi poke
-Let's do this, milk milk flavored crunchy snack
- Save the best for last.
- I can taste a little milk
- maybe you need like a lot 
to get like the the true experience
- smells like sweet milk
- You know what?
This is really good for a milk flavored  crunchy snack
you know what's one of
the weird things about like snacks in
the Philippines I remember
just like this being milk over there
would be like really random flavored
chips like for example this one or
vegetable this is a garlic adobo peanuts
right and I would see like chicken adobo
flavored chips which to me sounded
amazing because I love chicken adobo
chicken adobo is a food staple.
- Adobo in general.
- Adobo in general.
- How would you explain adobo?
It's like...
- It's just like stir fry meat...
- mmm
- I don't know how to explain it.
- Jeff's laughing at us like no it's not.
- It's more than that.
- I don't know.
Would you consider yourself to be...
How would you describe yourself as a Filipino?
Knowing that you've been raised up in Hawaii knowing what you know.
- Describe myself?
I think I'm like... I was raised very...
very locally I guess like not so much with
with my culture with my Filipino culture.
I mean yes we did like do it and stuff
but yeah I was like really raised with
trying to be just be American I guess
I wasn't really raised to be like,
okay you gotta learn the Filipino language do you have to learn
all these different things
yes did my parents and my grandparents do speak
it at home and I don't understand it
I understand most of it but not all
of it but I can't speak it myself
- Similar to you how I can understand most of the language they
look on the language but I can't speak
it I can't hold a conversation and I
remember as a kid, I was more my
parents were very passionate about me
learning English because that meant that
I could I would have more opportunities
for myself right? I mean back home my parents didn't
push me to like okay now you got to
review like your Ilocano or whatever
right like that it just it just
disappeared because I don't know for
some reason like it wasn't something
that we went over but my folks and my
family they would so speak it and so I
guess that's why I was still able to
retain some of the knowledge of
understanding what they're talking about
but however I was I was unable to speak
it and I realized that when I was in
high school that was my version of a
Filipino are like a localized Filipino
and then there's another group of
Filipinos which the stereotype for that
is they're called fobs and pretty sure a
lot of people are familiar with that but
you know to me they weren't flops to me
they were just a a group group of
Filipinos who were more cultured. right
there there were more in touch with
their culture and they could they
retained the language they could speak
it they could understand it and to me I
was actually very jealous of that.
This is about it for the end of the video
final thoughts just thinking about what
we've eaten today so we've had
various snacks we've had a noodle
version a cup noodle version
and just just thinking about what we've
eaten I think it's it's it's funny how
here in Hawaii I never really went into
a lot of Filipino stores to get these snacks.
I mean couple times I have gone with my
parents whenever we shopped for
ingredients to prepare for parties but
whenever comes to the the snack section
I never found myself like grabbing a
bunch of snacks that want to munch on
right and what what the default was is
actually going to a main branch store
and getting stuff like like Lay's potato
chips, Ruffles, Cheetos, Doritos
- All the American stuff
- Yeah Chips Ahoy Oreos, those kinds of things right?
and it's so funny because eating these these
foods I gotta say like I definitely want to
- get more of that yeah because
- Go back
- these foods are definitely part of our Filipino culture.
You know?
- And they're good they taste good
- They taste really good
especially this, this is my favorite right here
- and
- No more instant
- no more cup noodles
well I can't say no more cup noodles
- because you know I don't know where to get these
- True true true
- but I will have to say that like just this experience
alone has opened up a bigger perspective
on our Filipino roots you know I'm
I'm really happy that we got to do this.
Thank you for watching our video
we'll see you in the next one!
- Thank you!
