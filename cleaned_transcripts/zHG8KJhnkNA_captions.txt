and welcome to another one of our videos right  
so you know our main goal here is to be able 
to give you guys you expats you foreigners  
you know all of us you guys coming here to the 
philippines is to be able to give you guys some  
amazing information especially when you're trying 
to look um to the philippines to be able to meet  
your significant other your loved one you're great 
that's why you're coming here to the philippines  
or you're deciding to move here to the philippines 
so my goal is to be able to share with you guys  
things that you should know you know and to 
kind of immerse yourself into the culture of the  
philippine culture you know when you come down 
here to the philippines so in this video we're  
going to be talking about seven words seven words 
that you as an expat as a foreigner should know  
your filipina might be using now before we get 
started all i can ask is that you guys subscribe  
to this channel make sure you go ahead and click 
that bell button because it's going to be able  
to notify you of new videos coming out which we 
will be coming up with about three to four videos  
every week for you guys out there so let's go 
ahead and get started so you know filipinas  
you know they they like to use slang words and 
you're gonna have to learn these things because  
you might hear it first of all there's gonna be 
that you know that disconnect because they speak  
a different language a lot of filipinos do speak 
some english or really great english or sometimes  
no english at all so you might actually hear some 
of these slang words now what the funny part is  
like if you go to the u.s when i used to live 
in the us for example in the us you know a lot  
of the hip words hip slang words you know comes 
from you know a lot of the hip hop culture right  
and here in the philippines for some reason the it 
culture or the it thing of people coming up with  
slang words comes from becky's like the becky's 
and if you don't know what becky means it's a  
short or a slang word for bakla and a bakla is 
a gay person so for some reason they're the hit  
people that comes up with these really cool words 
right so we're gonna share that with you guys  
right now and the first word that you should know 
right is a veil right they're going to say a veil  
they're going to say something like you know 
oh my god you know john is so cute today i  
so wanna avail is something that they'll probably 
say so what they really mean by that a veil  
right is just a short version of the word 
available okay so they can use it something  
like this like yes actually he's sobrang avail 
sobra means so available so much available but  
really what they're trying to say is it simply 
means that he or she is someone who is actually  
worth pursuing so you're in a bar you're 
the restaurant you see a really nice  
cute looking filipina you say listen i just 
wanted to come here to meet you because you  
are so avail right so that's a word that you guys 
can use when you guys want to use some filipino  
becky slang because trust me don't feel weird if 
you're you're gonna say you're as a guy well i'm  
a guy i'm a dude i should not have to use becky or 
gay lingo but the truth is it's commonly accepted  
here in the philippines the second word that 
you guys should possibly know is the word aura  
right aura a-w-r-a or just think about it as 
aura a-u-r-e right i mean a-u-r-a aura right  
so uh what you get you know the typical you're 
gonna see a girl say something like you know girl  
i caught you making aura to that cute bartender 
right aura simply put is to attract attention  
that's when aura is when somebody has an aura 
around them right you know that that that  
bright shiny light that surrounds their body you 
know it's just it attracts attention you know or  
what happens is it puts um the spotlight on 
a person's self so the second becky word is  
aura right moving on to the number three word 
and it's an english word right it's called  
booking booking so when you hear them say 
booking it it kind of means a little bit  
has some things about the word booking 
right when you hear somebody oh you know  
you know booking right so um yeah it's booking 
when you book something with someone you set up  
a date right so pretty much when somebody says 
booking you're gonna say something like you  
know if i see a girl you know you can i'm gonna 
say something like you're so extra sexy today  
do you have a booking or you can 
say something like i have a booking  
later on right so pretty much it is 
a date or a time that may or may not  
but most likely will end up in a non-pg 
situation right not a hotel booking that means  
somebody's going to get some nookie later on 
right so that is how they use the term booking  
when it comes to becky language right and 
another word you should know is checka chica
right you know so something like you know or 
pretty much you can say chaka right you know  
so the older version of of this slang word is 
um or right so what happens is it's pretty much  
meaning i'm just kidding so i'm going to 
say something like girl i love your hair  
charot or chica right pretty much meaning 
i'm saying like you know i like your hair  
just kidding so you can kind of like use this in 
a way if you're going to flirt with somebody is  
just like saying you know what listen i love your 
hair or i love those eyes of yours or i love those  
key light or those brows just kidding right just 
to get grabbing attention so check chose those  
are some becky slangs for just kidding moving 
on to the next word we're going to say ganda  
ganda means beautiful or pretty right that's what 
it means if i say or if i say that means you're  
pretty you're cute you're beautiful right but what 
they end up doing is they use that as a question  
right meaning that oh you think you're pretty 
right so if you see somebody like you know  
trying to grab your attention trying to you know 
to overdo themselves and be a little bit more  
sexual to you or they're trying to feel pretty 
trying to look pretty even though they're not  
then you're going to say right so it's a sarcasmic 
way of telling somebody oh you think you're pretty  
right you think you're pretty okay then right so 
that's a sarcastic way of doing that so instead  
but you can use it if you want to be um if you 
want to tell a girl that you know hey you look  
beautiful you look pretty i'll be like you know 
right meaning that i'm saying hey you're beautiful  
you're pretty but if i'm if they're feeling 
pretty and i want to be sarcastic i'll be like  
and give that facial expression to them right 
so that's another one right there and then  
going to the last word or becky word or gay 
slang in the philippines is the word right  
right so you know if you know some spanish words 
you know the word p-u-t-a is a spanish word for  
a [ __ ] right now shutter is a combination 
of putting the p-u-t-a word and the s h i t  
word so you know you can use this 
in a you know you'll hear them say  
something like you know why did 
you tell them about our secret
meaning that you know you're [ __ ] and you're 
a [ __ ] you know you really are by saying that  
right so that's just another word you know and so 
that's what i want to be able to do here is kind  
of give you guys those slides because you know 
you might actually hear your girl you know the  
filipina that you meet your future wife they might 
be using these slangs guaranteed why it's because
becky slangs and becky culture is all over 
your your beautiful woman that you meet  
or the beautiful woman you're going to meet i 
will more than guarantee has a gay best friend  
all girls have one of those gay best friends 
they're becky best friends they're bbfs right  
so you guys have to understand and understand that 
this can actually happen so learning some of these  
slang words may be actually helpful for you maybe
