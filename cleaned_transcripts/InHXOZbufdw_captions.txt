we're in the middle of the street you know 
why because we're crossing to get McDonald's  
if you guys know all my series I always do a 
beautiful McDonald's review in every country and  
today we're doing a Philippines McDonald's review 
because every McDonald's tastes different and uh  
everybody's flavor is different chicken nuggets 
Big Mac so far we are heading out to McDonald's  
and we're about to eat duh the burger arches The 
Arches the golden arches I said Burger arches  
that's horrible but as you know they compete with 
Jollibee all the time so you won't see as many  
McDonald's Jollibee there's like a million of them 
from McDonald's there's not a million of them but  
still I still think a lot of people love Jollibee 
in the Philippines more than anything else  
but McDonald's hands down is different so let's go 
to the golden arches and oh wow Jollibee is open  
24 hours that's interesting and let's go finally 
get some McDonald's and I'm so excited because
gotta watch out for that I'm ready oh now 
we're going to McDonald's so never really  
had like the McDonald's like in other 
countries because no one told me about  
it but if you look at it Ronald is right there 
and we're gonna try something it's about time
and then you have different orders bro just so 
you know the best thing over here I would think  
I would definitely try the uh those wings are 
awesome this is gonna be my first time trying  
a McDonald's menu they got me chickens and as you 
can see they have double cheeseburgers they have  
a double cheeseburger deluxe and a Big Mac so I'm 
guessing you're gonna go where what are you gonna  
do it so the Frenchie's taking the quarter pounder 
with cheese I'm gonna take the original nuggets at  
oh I'm gonna take an influential which is what 
is it in France why okay okay I've never heard  
that so that's my first time so McDonald's review 
first time I don't know what to order so I'm gonna  
see what I can order I'm looking at the Big Mac 
but I also want the uh the chicken nuggets six  
piece chicken nuggets the wings are fire that's 
all I gotta say but I already know that by the  
way Singapore wings that has been the best I've 
ever had in my life Singapore has the best wings  
yep so I don't know whether it 
go chicken nuggets or Big Mac
what should we go for Big Mac or chicken nuggets 
chicken nuggets so we're gonna do a chicken  
nuggets we're gonna try everything so we're gonna 
do a different type of thing so we'll see we have  
chicken nuggets they have Fried Chicken which 
I've already tried the fried chicken I want to  
try something new but it doesn't look like they 
have everything different I see fresh and tasty  
so I'm gonna do it okay so we're gonna do a 
cheeseburger make a do which I've never had  
chicken nuggets fries and a drink and that's what 
we're gonna get I'm so excited and we're gonna get  
a mcfreeze and I'm gonna try something different 
so with the mcphreys they have Frozen grapes they  
have Fiji apple and they have oil and I I've never 
seen those so I'm gonna have to try that foreign
[Music]  
I wonder what I can get I'm gonna get 
like so I'm gonna get like a Fiji apple  
mcfreeze or a frozen grape I don't know 
which one to get oh I'm gonna ask the  
guy after we ask him so I'm gonna ask him 
and then we'll see what we're gonna get oh  
they went on the on the side so I'm gonna 
go ask this guy how you doing sir hello

maggots yeah the six piece meal small with it  
yeah fries and drink uh Coke Zero as the 
drink okay and then what do you recommend

for for a burger what's your favorite out of 
chicken or beef which one do you like the beef

uh both can I get both barbecue sauce 
and sweet and sour I'll pay extra  
I want one barbecue one sweet 
and sour do you have Ranch also
[Music]

yep
well not the meal just a Big Mac itself yeah 
yeah just a Big Mac itself anything else  
and then is there any other sides I need 
to try a Coke mcfloat a favorite coffee

oh you got pepper steak too yes sir yeah okay and 
let's get uh one is that pretty good the mushroom  
pepper steak yes sir there's no pork in it right 
yeah sir we have uh one piece and cookies but it's  
not there's no pork yes sir that's beef also 
it's beef yes okay uh let me get a one piece  
yep without fries and drinks without 
fries and drinks just sell alone yeah
[Music]  
so 417 is what I bought and uh I think I got 
a lot I'm not gonna lie 417 you're less than  
less than 13 to 10 it's literally like seven 
eight dollars I believe I have to look at my  
calculator and so we'll see you on the Food review 
and I'll tell you exactly how good it is all right  
guys crazy crazy crazy news we got the food okay 
let me clean this off because I got a little bit  
but check this out we got a Big Mac we got fries 
we got mushroom with beef and cream of mushroom  
with rice chicken nuggets Apple um float and it's 
like an apple juice like uh Fizz is what they call  
it in Coke Zero and let's try it out I'm actually 
super excited to try McDonald's so you guys don't  
understand I'm going to every McDonald's in the 
world I'm gonna try everything so people think  
they love McDonald's but they can't they 
can't love it as much as me that's how  
much and we got first of all case review 
on barbecue sauce I love barbecue sauce
oh that's a no that's it though I can't do the 
barbecue sauce here that's not good at all we're  
gonna do sweet and sour I'm very disappointed 
in um in the barbecue sauce sweet and sourdough  
okay perfect so we got clean sour all right first 
thing we're gonna slap nuggets sweet and sour
CE [Music]
it's good I honestly think that chicken 
nuggets in Indonesia is better but overall
it's good fries I'm a little disappointed they're 
kind of cold and that kind of makes me sad but it  
is what it is [Music] next thing what's crappy 
is I didn't get a fork but you know since I'm a  
Savage I'm just gonna eat it with my hands because 
that's just how I am and so right here let's go  
cream of mushrooms [Music] it's like a beef 
sausage patty with rice [Music] not bad
not something I'd order too often um it's 
just a weird combination but it's not bad  
but so far I'm loving the Nuggets 
that's sweet and sour sauce
I don't know anything about 
this but let's see [Music]
okay this hands down delicious this 
is truly delicious it's an apple fizz
wow I gotta slow down because I'm 
probably gonna get a brain freeze  
um that is really refreshing that is really good
next up
the final thing we got a quick Big Mac [Music]  
Bismillah they say that their Big Mac is supposed 
to slap over here but we'll see right now
[Music]
that's good um
the sauce is good the meat a little juicy but
it's okay I mean the sauce is good yeah
it still tastes the same to me  
I don't really see the big difference 
of like the Big Mac I'm not a big fan of  
yeah honestly the best things over here were the 
chicken nuggets and the Apple face and that's it
Philippines McDonald's if I 
were to tell you right now
I would go with the chicken 
nuggets and the fries [Music]  
Coke Zero but this apple piece made everything 
where I'm actually smiling because apple pays  
with everything that's what Sands down really good 
[Music] so I would say the chicken nuggets yes the  
Big Mac okay uh fries I'm just mad because they're 
cold They Don't Really soften their fries but  
I am I'm not a fan of this like it's 
okay I don't need a Patty with just rice
so honestly Jollibee is better than McDonald's 
in Japan or in um in in Philippines [Music]  
Jollibee is the way to go 
you're not gonna like that
what is this barbecue sauce
I didn't like it [Music] it is I didn't 
I didn't like it yeah I didn't yeah yeah  
it's like Smoky Barbecue but it doesn't taste 
like it doesn't hit me right okay so so far  
chicken nuggets yes fries need a little bit more 
salt I wish they were warm Big Mac okay this is  
probably the most delicious thing ever from 
McDonald's I think the good thing about it is
it's refreshing for some reason everything went 
Apple over here has been really refreshing [Music]  
so so far favorite McDonald's so far Indonesia
Philippines um they're Jollibee is amazing 
their Fried Chicken is really good [Music]  
but Indonesia definitely wins on best McDonald's 
so far I actually wait best chicken nuggets  
Indonesia you Dubai the mcravia delicious 
so Dubai wins on the mcravia chicken nuggets  
hands down Wings over there Philippines okay 
I actually went with this the Apple uh Fizz so
and we're off to the and we're off to the 
next McDonald's and wherever I go next  
I think the next one I'm gonna have to hit 
up is um is Vietnam McDonald's so right now  
this was a good amount of food I'm done for the  
day for the McDonald's review this was 
just a quick one in the Philippines but
very happy with [Music] the drinking the Nuggets 
but overall stick to drinking nuggets or deer  
fried chicken I didn't try it because I feel like 
Jollibee still has the best fried chicken here but  
um I can tell you guys right now just make 
sure when you come here don't order the  
barbecue sauce I wasn't a fan of Smoky 
Barbecue but everybody is different so
you guys enjoy remember to live your 
dreams and eat every McDonald's you can  
because um you gotta live life to the 
police and you gotta enjoy every McDonald's  
and tomorrow's never promised so while the 
journey I hope you guys enjoyed this quick  
McDonald's in the Philippines you guys have 
a wonderful day Bismillah have a good day
