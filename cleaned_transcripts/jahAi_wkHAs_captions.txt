[Music] previously on Voltaire Travels
in this episode we take you inside the home of a  
friend and Filipino shipping magnate 
and give you our first impression of
Cebu
see you in Cebu! 
Good morning, welcome aboard!  May I see your boarding pass?  Yes.
Cebu, here we come.
Yes.
here we are welcome to Cebu! okay we 
just arrived in Cebu and Olga has had her matcha  
had the matcha and I had a venti white 
chocolate mocha we're a little hyped we have  
our cafeine and we are ready to go! Nothing 
can stop me I'm all the way up! 
Is this original not fake? 100%? okay. Not from China m'aam. It says says made in China here. (joking) Made in Italy. Oh made  
in Italy. Italia!  She's from Italy? No, Ukrainian. Where 
you from? Negras, Philippines. Oh Philippines. Oh me  
too! Negras, yeah, born and raised. My whole life. 
Umm, I went to Negras high school. (not really) Don't listen  
to him. This is a beautiful island... First time... uhhuh 
oh wow. So where should we go in the Philippines? Palawan.  
Boracay. Boracay! Yeah we just came from Boracay. It 
was amazing! Yeah. Where's my glasses? Oh here  
we go. I lost them already.
Hi, hello. So it looks like 
we brought too many bags and we cannot close the car.
(We are in Cebu as a group and the other drivers are picking up friends and family in full size vans.)
Too many clothes.
 
So we 
found the solution... Hey how are you doing? Ah I can't breathe! I can't breathe! Good?
Yeah.
We have Olga doing what she does best makeup 
in the car. I don't think I've ever seen her actually do makeup... At home. At home.
We have 
a finished product. Oh wow, oh. Looking good. Mhm. Very nice. (professional model makeup expert)
Jeepney? Yeah Jeepney. Yeah okay it looks 
super hot. Yeah that's true. I don't know if there's  
a fan blowing around?Come on it's open windows. 
I know but it's all metal. Yeah. When you were
a kid you would sneak into the Jeepney? Yeah. Nice. 
Just sneak in the back and kind of hide. Yeah.  
When it's near to our drop off area 
we just jump out. That is the capital. Oh it's a capital building?
 
Monterazzas. Yes its kind of complex? Yeah 
it's like a complex subdivision of a village. Yeah it's kind of 
like Beverly Hills. It's a city within  
the city. A city away from the city. Like 
this is still part of Cebu city but we're 
on top of the mountain. See Cebu City down there?  
Such a nice view! Okay I'm staying here. How much does it cost, like what?
He knows. He knows. It's more than a million.
Oh yeah I think it's 20 million US dollars.
[Music] Wow.

the property here doing a little 
karaoke practice let's check it

Security guard singing, "Nothing's gonna change my love for you." [Music]
We are staying currently at the home of Lucio, who 
is a shipping magnate, here in Cebu and he's been  
very kind enough to invite Olga and myself into 
his home. Today we're going to go on a little boat  
ride. We're going to go to Bohol and I'm very 
excited to show you Bohol and to do a couple  
of photo shoots. So let's go on an adventure. Coming
