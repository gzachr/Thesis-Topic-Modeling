Today, we're checking out some Filipino
food in Perth's south
at Ready Eddie's Cafe.
Anyone who knows me knows that I love
the Philippines and I
especially love their food.
The menu here is really big and it's got
a little bit of everything for everybody.
I let the girls do the ordering
because they are the real experts.
I did have one request and that's the dinuguan.
that's like a pork stew and it's
thickened with pig's blood.
I'm really getting flashbacks
of my time in the Philippines.
We were given some complimentary
bulalo, which is a beef soup.
That first taste of bulalo took me
straight back to the Philippines,
the first dish to arrive with adobong pusit,
which is Squid Adobo,
and of course, our rice.
And as they say in the Philippines,
rice is life!
Next up is our dinuguan,
which is that pork stew that's
thickened with the pig's blood.
It's really one of my favorite
dishes in the Philippines.
I ate it almost every day.
Another one of my favorite pork sisig
sisig is generally lots of different cuts
of pork, they use the brain,
the ears the liver and the meat.
I love all those different
textures and flavors in one dish
So I was told you have to squeeze
the lemon and then mix it all through.
Check out that egg.
Thank you so much.
The final dish to come out
was braised bullet tuna.
Watch this, one,
two,
three, must be it at it four!! Nah.
Five scoops of rice.
I really am a Filipino.
I decided to taste all the dishes from
Lighter to heavier in the flavour profile.
So I started off with
the braised bullet tuna.
The bullet tuna was an oily fish like
a mackerel, and it was so full of flavor.
Next up is the sisig, which is
a load of fun on a sizzling plate.
The flavors, the textures in this dish are
on point,
and that egg gives that beautiful velvety
mouth feel and that richness that I love.
Now for the adobong pusit,
the squid adobo.
This is one of my favorite things to cook
after I've been fishing and caught some
squid, the squid is simmered in vinegar,
soy sauce with some garlic,
onion and a little bit of tomato
just for that umami boost.
I even add the squid ink sac to give that
beautiful black colour, this adobong pusit was really damn good.
Now on to my favourite, the dinuguan,
as I mentioned earlier, it's a pork stew
and at the end they thicken it with the pig's blood.
Now, some of you may be a little put
off by the pig's blood in the stew.
But don't be scared it is beautiful,
don't be a chicken, eat the pig's blood.
Yeah, get yourself some
more rice, big fella.
That's six, seven, eight,
but who's counting?
The Filipinos really love their food.
And you can see them get excited
when they're talking about it.
It's so nice.
Now close your eyes.
You don't want to see this. More rice.
man, I'm going on a diet after this
and this time I mean it.
Who am I kidding?
OK, one last stop,
and that's the halo halo
Now, apparently, I was doing it
all wrong and there's a technique.
So Roxy took over and started smashing
it with the spoon to mix it up.
Halo halo
Is a really fun dessert.
It's got crushed ice,
Different jellies,
condensed milk and ice cream.
And I love it.
Oh, wait did I say last stop?
We've got to leche flan as well.
So they cut some of that up
and put that in my
halo halo
Now, although I can't travel
at the moment, Philippine's
is always in my heart.
And now I've got Ready Eddie's cafe to go to.
And right next door
there's a Filipino market.
We grabbed a few different kinds of longanisa
for our breakfast tomorrow
and took some happy snaps.
What a great day.

Masarap!
