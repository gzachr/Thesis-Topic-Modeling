we are going to be spending the next few nights
staying on this remote island oh my God I
love this place and we are here for the Euler
experience and if you don't know what that
is it's an authentic oil and life experience
centered around staying in these massive bamboo
huts and it looks right over the ocean it's
absolutely beautiful is there any people yes
you're making dinner Fair Lady thanks yes
as you can imagine we're oil and life there
is going to be some mutation so over the next
few days we'll have no Wi-fi we won't have
any air conditioning we are literally going
to have to rough it because we are on an island
in the middle of nature so this will stop
any insects one of the girls was saying she's
seen one in or hot and was like this size
okay time to test out the shower
one of them is called Wilma Wilma
what they are supposedly later on we're going
to be learning a Filipino dance and we all
have to take part in it
[Applause] with this current trip that me
and Samantha are on coming up to the eight
month period this seemed like the perfect
place to disconnect at least for a few days
thank you very much you're so kind thank you
[Laughter] welcome to our bamboo Huts let
me show you insights as you can see it has
a spiral staircase to get inside the whole
thing is made from bamboo it's absolutely
gorgeous we have the extra large one so it's
actually quite tall look at the height of
that roof we also have tree beds which we
only need one because it's just me and Keelan
there's a double bed and there's two single
beds the beds and all are made from bamboo
it's amazing there's actually mosquito Nets
as well covering over the Beds which is great
because we are on an island in the middle
of nature so this will stop any insects we're
getting in the bed which we don't want to
look at the bottles as well of decoration
on the beds it's really cool isn't it there's
sort of just toys to it it really gives it
that like Island life Vibes this is the best
part of our huh this is our balcony and it
looks Royale over the ocean it's absolutely
unreal beautiful isn't it isn't it it's absolutely
incredible we've never say it anywhere like
this honestly it's definitely very unique
isn't it the way it's there's no windows in
there just like that the Sea Breeze just comes
in from here right into our room no windows
at all so as I said this is a balcony but
it's actually like attached to the room and
we have a little cover here and we can zip
it if we want I think that's for rain is that
what that is yeah it's for rain but if it
doesn't rain you just keep it open we can
just keep open I mean whether it rains or
not you're probably cold should it but yeah
it's probably to block the rain coming through
maybe you're right but that's why we have
the mosquito Nets as well because like that
is open out but um I can't wait to actually
wake up we've only arrived but I can't wait
to wake up here in the morning I know that
would be the first thing that we see when
we wake up that can't be uh bad for me can
it definitely not
[Music]
so the idea behind the island experience that
we're doing is to give people a feel for like
the Simplicity of Island life so the hoods
actually are quite basic we have no AC oh
we do actually have a farm there the place
doesn't have a huge amount of light in both
there is one light there that we have inside
our home we also don't have our own bathroom
but there is a communal shared bathroom just
outside of our hotel and there's also a shower
with that as well and speaking of shower they
also gave us two tails so yeah that is our
haul and we can't wait to spend the next three
nights here honestly we're so excited we've
just checked in and we met all the people
who run the place here at Isle experience
and they are very welcome and very nice they
actually gave us a quick brief on what we
can do on the island so even though it is
quite small it does seem like there is a lot
for us to do so yeah we're really excited
and as I said yeah we can't wait to spend
the next three nights here [Music] oh
[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause]
[Music]
so we're after getting changed into our Island
clothes and nice and fresh now we were roasting
honestly but uh I just want to show you around
the rest of the island and what they have
on offer at the islet experience so I don't
know how many Huts there are exactly on the
islands but there is a lot so there's a role
here where we're staying and then they go
right around the other side but they all come
in different shapes and sizes so we're in
the extra large one but there's also like
a small one there next to us as well that
you can see and the small ones are actually
quite cute too and they all have their own
individual names so the name of our one is
the Bolton so yeah they all have their own
kind of individual names which is really cool
also right outside I hope there is a volleyball
net which is one of the activities you can
do here you've actually seen a few people
playing so we're definitely going to jump
in on a game right so and this is the toilet
situation so I did mention earlier we don't
actually have a toilet in our hoe but there
is a few of them spread around the grounds
and which is really handy then as well so
this one is actually quite close to our ho
so if we do need to use the toilet or in the
night it's not too far of a walk so the showers
then just at the back of the toilets and again
there's a couple of showers around as well
so plenty for everybody so this block here
this tree one two three and then there's another
kind of uh Ale House I guess you'd say on
the other side there as well so yeah it's
handy and as I said there is a few toilets
spread around the island and each of them
have showers at the back of the toilets yeah
so there's plenty of showers for everybody
in order to mention the island doors have
a restaurant slash bar so you can get a breakfast
lunch and dinner and it's a buffet don't know
every day so it's really convenient and also
the bar sells some soft drinks and alcohol
drinks they also have a lovely cocktail list
so I think they'll enjoy some of them later
on for sure and they also do karaoke
I also like this feature here Wilson
it doesn't feel like a wrong Castaway doesn't
it oh my God yeah well son also between the
meals so we have breakfast lunch and dinner
then there's also some snacks as well that
you can get so they have like a fruit salad
some french fries sweet potato fries a vegan
platter as well that's really good actually
to know and so yeah there's a there they're
just the snacks as well that you can get but
this is actually the area where we eat so
the food is served off this table it's thrown
out like a buffet and then we all eat together
over here which is actually really nice because
you get a new new people and get chat and
share stories and everything else so I've
also heard something really funny supposedly
later on we're going to be learning a Filipino
dance and we all have to take part in it you
have to do it there's no excuse to say I just
can't wait to see Keelan oh my God right so
now that we're all settled in we've heard
that the island has some pigs so I think it's
feeding time for them now so we're gonna go
down onto the beach I'm not too sure if we'll
get to feed them we're gonna go down and have
a look
come on YouTube
launch [Music]
[Music]
so I don't know why I think they're so horny
but they are like a cute funny
oh that was something else to show the names
Betty Wilma and Peppa Little Island pigs [Music]
the little small one yeah oh that was funny
probably seeing there as well the people who
were feeding them so how how it works here
at the oil experience is that people can volunteer
so that they come and they stay for like a
week or two weeks I think one couple in particular
are here two months and what they do is they
come there right to the island they stay in
the island but then they also volunteer and
they do kind of like daily chores I guess
you'd say and and help with with guests and
tours and things of that so so those people
that were feeding the pigs they were actually
volunteers so um it's a big cool job but it's
a great opportunity as well if you are a traveler
and you're traveling and you just want to
sort of stuff over they always take on volunteers
yeah which is great so you can just apply
online and one girl we got so she's offering
to do yoga here then as well so that's like
horror volunteer work yeah and yeah it's just
really good it is cool yeah I have to say
they look after us very well so obviously
like we're guests here and um they really
look after you and help out with like the
different activities so we plan to go to Northland
now in a while and one of the lads from New
Jersey yeah so one of the volunteers will
bring us because there's a shipwreck um there
somewhere that we can go and see when we snorkel
so like so what do the volunteers will bring
us to do that so it's pretty cool the way
it's set up it's really cool yeah
okay so as we said earlier snorkeling is one
of the activities that we can do here and
I think we mentioned briefly as well it is
a shipwreck out here that we can kind of swim
out to and see so that's what we're doing
now one of the volunteers uh Eunice he's from
New Jersey in America he's going to bring
us out and uh and show us he knows exactly
where it is it's not too far actually from
the uh from the shore so I think we've got
maybe like a 10 minute swim to get there and
then we can kind of snorkel and see uh it's
like so we're looking forward to it it's a
bit choppy to be fair and if you watch our
videos and that's why they're not the strong
swimmer so we're hoping that we'll be able
to to do it and everything will be okay
also the way the current is the hardest part
is to get out here once you get out here and
we want to come back to Corinth we'll just
bring us back to shore so the most difficult
part is actually swimming out to the point
of where the Shipwreck is
supposed to be amazed when we've heard so
many people say like you have to go out there
yeah so I was sort of second tank in it because
it is quite windy as well and the current
is quite strong I'm not really the strongest
swimmer I love snorkeling I've done many trips
around I travel but it's usually the boat
actually brings you to the snorkeling spot
and I just have to Simply get down the ladder
and then off I go I'm there in the spot with
all the fish but this is obviously takes a
little bit more effort yeah yeah let's hope
I get out okay [Music] into more
[Music]
thank you
[Music]
oh what a mad situation it's nice out of the
last name
[Music]
oh that was pretty existing
foreign [Music]
[Music]
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
thing which indicates that males are going
to be served so obviously it would have been
8 30 in the morning it's now time for breakfast
thank you
[Music] all right time to test out the shower
oh
that was lovely it was cold I'm not gonna
lose freezing colds which is really good pressure
for me and I'm nice and clean
so there's a local Village not many people
live there um and I think there's like a little
shop as well that you can pick up a few snacks
so we're going to just take a walk in and
have a little look around
spiders
I got over this morning and uh there was like
a big muscle spoiler on the door looking at
me let's go in the toilet it was too late
then to run but I'm getting Kayla just to
check now I'm not a fan okay spoil the check
okay no I can't see I need somebody [Music]
good to go okay to be fair the one earlier
was the first one we've seen on a trip in
Asia so far I thought I would have seen a
lot more of them over here but uh one of the
girls was saying she's seen one in or hot
and was like their size so that's sort of
free to be out I don't think I can really
describe Samantha's fear of insects you'd
have to actually see it in actions but um
I mean you might be thinking why the hell
are we in Southeast Asia with a fear of insects
because they are everywhere but In fairness
to her like she's definitely come a long way
in terms of uh her reaction to things like
that you know obviously it's just still going
to become a couple of things that still freak
her out you know but this is what coming to
places like this is all about you are literally
immersed into nature so whatever is going
on here it's going to be part but there's
no there's no way around it it's just that's
just power for the course when you come when
you stay in a remote island like this you're
gonna have all these insects all this Wildlife
the different sounds different boards different
creatures animals you hear it um at night
time and stuff like that so it's just it is
part of it I guess you'd say but like I said
she's come a long way right so I just asked
we're going to actually walk to the Village
by ourselves they do do a village tour that
you can go with a group and they just tell
you a little bit about the village but we're
actually just going to take a little walk
in ourselves we might end up meeting the group
as we get in there but uh we've been directed
so we have to go this way we might have to
ask a couple of people on the way I think
it's like a 10 minute walk not too sure but
I just know it was the gate is because I don't
know like one of the big like Palm leaves
it was just such a fallen in the tree oh did
it yeah the world is wild like okay so don't
get hit in the head by a cold yeah right head
down and nice and quick [Music] yeah this
one here look at this just fell off the tree
off the tree yes this is what I'm saying this
is Island lights Amanda this is the real deal
I know this is proper tested me now
I tell you what it's proper windy as well
here the weather is so like five minutes it
can be just absolutely glorious Sunshine real
calm Sears and then literally five minutes
later it's just wind ran things falling out
with trees oh within the space for five minutes
it's mental
thank you
hello
just a few hands around is there any people
this is like a something to see in a movie
it's like a kind of ghost town that we've
just stumbled into there's only about maybe
eight or nine of kind of like Shack kind of
houses and we're on the lookout for a shop
to get a drink but there's nobody there it's
actually there's nobody around no no it's

way before finishing our night off with a
very funny traditional Filipino dance
[Music] thank you do that
[Music] [Applause] the next day we were determined
to have the full Euler experience this meant
putting the cameras away turning our phones
off and completely disconnecting for my usual
day today since we started traveling and creating
videos for our YouTube channel we have always
been doing something whether that's talking
into the camera taking pictures and videos
on our phones posting to social media or doing
some crazy activity but today for the first
time we did absolutely nothing this island
promotes Freedom the Simplicity of doing nothing
with no distractions to relax and let time
pass without caring or worrying about anything
else we didn't realize but this was something
that we both needed we said earlier in the
Vlog that this trip in particular has been
eight months long we have traveled through
India we've traveled through Thailand we spent
some time in Malaysia and now we are moving
through the Philippines it's been go go go
so to have this day was very special [Music]
