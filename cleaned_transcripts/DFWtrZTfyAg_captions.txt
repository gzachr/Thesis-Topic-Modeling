So, good morning guys. Herejean just still 
asleep it's 3pm okay keep me kind and this weekend
I'm taking her out to a cabin for her birthday. 
Um, but she doesn't know that we're about to go
somewhere else right now, once I wake her up um to 
go buy her an actual gift. So it's not too crazy~
But, uh it's something that she would like and 
that's she's been asking for so she did something
really awesome for my birthday. If you haven't 
seen that vlog you can check it out here. Um, but yeah 
I wanted to go get her something so I'm gonna bring 
her along so she can pick it up.
Let's go wake her up.
I told her that the place closes early that 
we have to go send money at which is not true.
Yeah, just to got you out of bed early. 
Yeah? So, where are we going? We're heading
somewhere to get your birthday gift.
Oh? Yeah, so we're taking her ~ So you lied to me?
Yeah ~ Duh!

a gift that closes at six. Okay ~ You don't normally
wake up till about four? Herejean wakes up at 
like 12 p.m. or a.m. oh yeah. Yeah, he told me guys
I need to wake up because the Filipino store that 
we gonna send money, they are closed like 5:30 p.m.
 He lied to me that's why, we like we just woke 
up you know we woke up like this. Early yeah exactly.

know so we are already celebrating her birthday
this weekend at a cabin right? This is a extra gift.
{ Surprise! } So where are we going? 
I'm not telling you.
Yeah, but we're not heading straight to send 
money! Oh okay,  ~ Yeah, that's why I guess we
did have a misunderstanding. You lied 
to me? Yeah, I totally lied to you. You're a good liar.
Thank you!

Korean food? You always saying you love Korean food.

No, I wouldn't do that. Okay ~ so let's find out guys.
So, guys Dominick bring me to a "Trader's Garden Center".

It's a plants lover. Yes, you are. And Dominick soon~
His gonna be a plantito. So, over there guys ~
That's where all the plants. { Okay }
Yeah, but I remembered Dominick 
don't want me to buy plants because he said, All 
of them are died. Yeah ~ yeah I said why am I gonna
buy more first ones all died. That's why but, 
I was just joking because I already had this plan.
So,
How many I'll gonna buy for plants? Um ~ I had to 
look at the uh prices on these things first but 
the original idea was that you can get quite a few.
Quite a few? Yeah. Yeah? quite a few ~ 
I expected maybe one.
No more than one. We'll go take a look.
Okay, so we're gonna go inside now.
What do you think?

instructions for you this time?
How to keep them alive? No instructions.
No instructions? We'll use google.

They're a little expensive.
This is all herbs. Yeah? I'm not going for cooking.
