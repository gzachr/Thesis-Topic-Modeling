I am in Boracay one of the most popular Islands 
here in the Philippines this island is famous  
for white sand beaches crystal clear water so I'm 
very excited to be here today is my first full day  
so join me as we explore this island unfortunately 
the weather isn't the best at the moment but yeah  
the day is long I'm getting some breakfast at the 
moment so let's hope for the best that the weather  
will clear up later today ah no not that she just 
want to get some food no here yeah oh but so far  
I want to get here okay you can do it but I have 
some restaurant here I have a look okay thank you  
yeah I'm at the moment on the other side of 
the island as the locals call it here this is  
the not so touristy side of the island and over 
there and the other side which is just a short  
10 minute walk from here um you can find your all 
the the restaurants the the most beautiful beach  
but my hotel is close to this side 
so I thought let's check out this  
side first and then later today we 
will head over to the other side
okay we have food shakes here I love 
to drink food shakes in the morning
can I get food here
and I think we have a local Filipino 
food which looks better to me than all  
the Western Restaurants on the touristy side 
hello hello can I get food here yes right yeah  
okay free sitting okay thank you very much 
can I also sit over there yes so I can maybe  
have a little view of although the view is a 
little bit blocked here because I'm too tall
okay I'm actually curious again to try 
local food because if you remember last  
week I had a little bit of food poisoning so 
I was yeah avoiding food that I don't know  
in the past days but I'm all right again so 
let's see if we can get some nice local food  
what is the name of this dish peanut fish yeah 
peanut fish so I ordered some Filipino dishes
yeah I make a YouTube videos 
so this food will be in YouTube
okay and this is something very uh famous in 
or typical yeah many people like to eat this  
yes okay so we have um Can abroad 
yeah you can you can search it up  
so yeah I'm very excited to 
try more Filipino food now
yeah
okay yeah it's very delicious also okay it 
looks really good so what is inside so we  
have different vegetables yeah different and 
this is a pork yeah pork okay okay and it's  
not spicy right not spicy spicy and on top 
we have some garlic right you call it babang  
all right I learned about one already mango 
banana no sugar yeah trying to stay healthy
fresh fruit shakes for breakfast are absolutely  
the best especially if you 
are on a tropical island
so sitting right here now at this 
local spot let's give the food a  
try how do you eat it do you put the rice 
in here or separate exactly up to me okay
so but normally where the people here how 
do they eat it you put there and here is ah  
you put the because the the rice in Asia is 
usually the main the main part of the food  
right I like this okay and then you dislike this 
yes okay I try to to always learn the local way  
so okay yeah let's see like this I as a 
German would mix it all together that's how  
we usually eat dishes with rice in Germany 
but I know it's usually different in Asia
um oh I really like the sauce here
oh it's very good oh I'm not set up mess it 
up yeah oh I really like it the sauce is very  
uh flavorful rich in flavors and all these 
vegetables make it a healthy meal I think
okay I'm really curious to try the meat now
so we have a pork here these have fatty 
pads are usually very Juicy and Delicious
there's a little bit of peppery flavor 
to it that's the right word peppery oh
so I'm not sure if this is typically 
a breakfast food in the Philippines or  
if you usually you eat this more for 
dinner or lunch or whatever but this  
is my breakfast now and I really 
like it very masara sit down here
you want to tell the joke again which 
one the the black water joke let's see  
if maybe some people will guess it correctly it's  
flavored sparkling black water that's your 
favorite drink that's his favorite drink yeah let  
me know in the comment section if you uh know what 
he's talking about yeah let me say it again that's  
Sparkle flavored sparkling flavored black water 
on the rocks sounds delicious right and I was also  
a surprise to to hear that you speak English with 
each other yeah yeah and they explained me because  
they grew up with speaking English here right 
yes yeah because I was confused I was sitting  
here and I see all the locals speaking English 
with each other and I was like why why didn't

the languages right yeah or three or it depends 
on where you are or even three the third one is

kids in Spanish oh yeah yeah I remember like  
like when I was a child I always hated it when my 
mom spoke English at home because I was annoyed  
by it and now I am happy that she did it because

let me um the name of this place the name is uh 
Tambayan right yes the name of the restaurant okay

I just had food there come by and hang out so 
if you're looking for a place to hang out on  
this side of the island okay thank you bye-bye 
bye and so yeah it's raining now but uh as I  
said already in the previous video don't complain 
about things you cannot change that's how it is  
a club hi station three yeah I 
think so you know where it is
open how much 100 okay hello hello
all right it is the next day actually now because 
yesterday it just kept raining and raining and you  
can see today the weather looks much better so I 
think today is the day where we can finally check  
out the beach and see its full Beauty hopefully 
some jumping on the on a motorbike taxi here to a  
yeah good it stays number one yeah or three yeah 
yeah so here's number one yeah this one ah okay  
so yeah they're called the different parts 
of the beach station one two and three and  
so we're going to number three now number 
three okay so this is one and then number two  
around here but the whole beachfront I think 
you can get from station one to station three  
five minutes with a motorbike taxi so I 
think the right here will not be too long but  
yeah we can have a look at the yeah 
this is like kind of the main road here  
so the beach is right behind these buildings here
is this the main road here main road right yeah 
station three so the main area of the bodakai yeah  
okay so yeah you can see we have all these kinds 
of restaurants here lots of tourists on the island
and then these uh yeah how you want to call it  
kind of a tuk-tuk but these are all 
electric all electric right Electric
are electric but motorbike 
is not electric right yeah  
yeah it's a normal motorbike but the electrics
oh that's the filipino word okay
so we are approaching the beach now inside yeah 
so we have to drive through this small Alicia  
to get from the main road which is 
behind us to the to the beachfront  
I'm very excited actually the first time I can 
see the beach with uh the old sun shining weather  
I hope the wind is also not so strong so 
the rays are not too big but let's see
yeah you can see it rained a lot yesterday 
the roads are still very wet actually
okay 100 for you okay so much 
thank you very much have a good day  
okay so yeah it is indeed uh once again pretty 
windy here we have some some huge waves actually  
and you can probably see my ears all 
over the place because of the Winds
but uh where are we now actually there is 
a bar slash hotel which is nice to hang out  
I found that one already but okay so welcome to I 
would say almost the full beauty of this place wow
yeah if you saw my previous video when I 
arrived here it looks very different now right  
ah check it out and I'm actually surprised 
how empty it is here it is uh two o'clock  
so uh the middle of the day and uh what's going 
on wow beautiful palm trees here coconut trees  
sky blue look at the color of 
the water I mean how cool is that  
unfortunately a little bit uh windy and big wave 
so it's not really that calm but I mean come on  
we are complaining on a little on a very high 
level here actually now this is amazing and  
the sand also sand is hot white and clear so 
I would rate this beach actually quite High  
it's a very nice Beach ah I'm in a good mood 
now let's see if I can maybe get a drink  
the place that I'm looking for I think is the 
one over there I was sitting there actually  
yesterday evening watching uh Rainey 
rainy sunset but today is much better
the good thing about the wind is 
that you can really hear the the  
ocean the rage the sound of the waves 
I hope it's clearly true here on the  
on the video because it actually sounds 
very nice I like to hear the the ocean
wow beautiful place really beautiful place and 
yeah this is where I sat down yesterday evening
very weird that you see me drinking a beer in 
my videos but uh on a beautiful day like this  
right on the beach I feel like drinking a beer 
and actually sun make light sun make a light  
um as far as I know it is actually a beer 
coming from the Philippines but I tried it  
already many times before you can also get 
it in Thailand for example and I would say  
it's actually one of my favorite beers in 
the world because yeah The Taste is more  
light that's why it's not something alive so it's 
actually quite easy to drink so yeah cheers guys
I know I don't I don't need 
it thank you very much foreign
beaches like this touristy places  
so I don't really mind that they're just trying 
to to make some extra money so as long as they  
are not very pushy and unfriendly I 
have absolutely no problem with that
but uh I think I am in need for some sunglasses 
when I was sitting there the Sun was shining  
against my face so I feel like uh yeah maybe 
a sunglasses or Samsung glasses would be nice  
let's see if we can find some this by the 
way is the beach front here ah no thank you  
ah we have some sunglasses here maybe I can get a 
simple clear hello I'm looking for some sunglasses  
how much are your sunglasses 100. 
by the way it's so yeah we have  
these ones here which uh which are 
like a mirror I can try right yeah
well I think they are maybe to smoke from you
now I can use the other 
sunglasses here as a mirror
actually I think it's already all right
we have a big mirror here
maybe you can have a proper look somewhere
we have basketball jerseys here um basketball
basketball like this but from 
Philippines no no hat another  
store other store or nothing oh yeah 
maybe I think this one 100 yeah okay  
okay I would like to get this one okay 
okay you can remove this one here please
clear okay so that was an easy 
put oh I have a sticker on there
to sticker which is on top of the glasses here
okay thank you very much um maybe I need 
a new shirt yeah I'm still looking for  
Filipino basketball jersey so I couldn't 
find it and here we have all these typical  
Boracay t-shirts here how much are the t-shirts 
150 and if I buy it true I get discount  
150 and if I buy five pieces 
then discount oh no discount okay  
yes but I think 150 for a t-shirt 
is actually not a bad price
um but I think just a sunglass for now 
100s okay salamat thank you very much  
um okay so yeah this is the beach front which 
to my surprise is rather empty at the moment  
I would guess if I would take a guess why it's 
so empty I think it's because the locals avoid  
the sun which is the case in almost all the Asian 
countries but the locals don't really like to uh  
to get the sun on their skin but maybe 
it's also another reason I don't know
oh I found a man and he claims to know 
a shop that sells Philippines basketball  
jerseys so he's had a over there one minute 
yeah okay I'm Mighty excited because this  
would be the first shop that I see that 
sells these Filipino basketball jerseys
there are markets like this are not available
10 seconds
10 seconds there's a shop selling basketball 
t-shirts here that would surprise me a lot now
this doesn't look like a shop 
selling basketball t-shirts
but yeah he seems to be quite confident 
about it oh there's a shop indeed and yeah
okay let's see what we got here
um hello I'm looking for a Filipino basketball 
jerseys like the the gilas Filipinas
no I know you you were like you printed here 
yeah ah okay so it's not like um I'm looking  
for like the original shirt from from Nike 
yeah but you don't have it here no no you you  
print t-shirts here ah okay I see customize it ah 
okay but that's not what I'm looking for ah well  
thank you very much um okay the search for the 
Philippine basketball jersey continues um maybe  
yeah getting a set printed would be like a plan B 
you know but yeah I will continue to look for it
maybe let's get a small snake in here
I think if we continue to walk this direction we 
are actually like leaving the the tourist area  
so I would also be very interested to have 
a look at like a look behind the scenes
but first
this place looks interesting
looks like like a prison cell you know right 
hello what are you selling here hamburgers  
ah cheeseburger and a hot dog Hungarian sausage
can I get a hamburger one
one a street food hamburger
why do we have this here thank you so not 
safe looks like like she's working in a prison
yeah even with the with the chains here 
okay the hamburger here is just 45 pesos  
Which is less than a dollar for a burger
I'll buy one take one so I get one for 
free it's a two for one burger here
hamburger
no cheese today
is actually totally all right especially 
now that I have two for 45 495
how many how many burgers
92 Burgers oh wow
so this is a company lunch uh so many burgers 
okay enjoy enjoy wow I make YouTube videos  
okay it's okay thank you thank you bye-bye
all right if you want a quick Burger snake 
here for just 45 pesos wasn't that bad
okay so I'm actually very curious now to 
continue working here and leave the touristy area  
and I am actually in a desperate need of 
a haircut you can see my hair is getting  
very messy and I haven't done a haircut in the 
Philippines yet so this is going to be my first  
haircut here and I just came across a little 
Barber Shop here so I'm not sure what gupit  
means does it mean haircut and the price is uh 
70 pesos is that a normal price for a haircut  
here I have no idea what's a normal price here 
let's ask and see if I can get a haircut here  
hello can I get a haircut here yeah how much is it 
70. 70 pesos okay let's get a haircut here in yeah
I can show you a picture okay yeah 
I always have a picture on my phone
like this like side underline here
and this is my video picture that I 
always take while I always show okay okay
ah okay I hope I don't forget my sunglers 
later you cannot Remind Me Maybe I forget
okay hello
thank you
okay so yeah we need to get rid of 
the air here because it's getting  
too long and I like to have to slide more shorts
it's funny that uh in all the barbershops in 
the Asian countries I think I saw like maybe  
100 different barber shops in the past years 
although the pictures are always uh Western men  
you never see Asian models in 
these barber shops thank you
the funny thing is I am a true troll so he 
has to stand on this little uh box there to  
to reach my my head not the first time that 
I have this happening in a in a barber shop
it's done and I'm very happy with 
the results we worked very accurate  
all the details on the corners so I'm very 
very happy with it it's very good very good
you can give me a 300 follow much thank you very 
much oh look how tall I am I'm too tall for your  
shop I'm quite exactly fitting until the ceiling 
here I need to be careful with the fan here  
very nice thank you bye-bye and so  
now I need to do some some styling and 
then I'm looking fresh again I think
small little shop like this nice local 
neighborhood and I guess local crisis I'm  
not sure what the haircut usually costs here 
in the Philippines if 70 pesos is uh price  
at the lower end or the higher end I would 
guess it's a price on the lower side of the  
price ranges for haircuts and I gave 
you 500 just give me 300 bags and then  
the rest is for you thank you 
very much have a good day bye  
all right and oh I see it um getting rainy again 
you see the the rain clouds are coming back  
and I'm viewing a cat over 
there ah nice beautiful day here  
oh the traffic is intense here 
so many vents so many tuk-tuks
uh four people on the motorbike we have yeah
souvenir shop yeah oh okay okay I'm from 
Germany Germany yeah yeah ah thank you thank you  
I'm very happy to be here
oh nice ah look how much cars are here now maybe 
the beach was this empty because uh everybody is  
leaving the island today I don't know um yeah 
it was interesting to basically see the the  
two sides of boracai today so we saw the the 
touristy sides the beach ones the the all the  
the restaurant there Etc and also an area like 
this which is uh the more local side of a very  
touristy and famous place here in the Philippines 
and I always like to see uh these both sides you  
know the tourist side but also the behind 
the scenes the local side of each place that  
I visit and yeah if you haven't seen the video 
of me arriving here the journey from Manila to  
get to product guide and you can check out the 
video right here see you on the next episode
