Pa this is the brazo the mercedes
yeah it's called brazo de mercedes i am super 
excited for this sweet food from the philippines  
called brazo the mercedes and today my parents 
are gonna try this i will show you the garden  
where i cook filipino food as many of you know 
already of course and here's the table on which  
we will make the brazo the mercedes first i will 
change my shirt because it's really mainit today  
i think it's approximately 27 degrees celsius 
today it's nice so we're gonna use this machine
super excited so this is good for the egg whites i 
also used that last time since this is the second  
time actually that i'm making this dessert from 
the philippines i'm gonna take some eggs oh here  
they are last time i used six eggs i believe but 
today i'm gonna make a little bit more since i  
will also give it to my parents let's use 10 this 
time we'll start with splitting the eggs the yolk  
from the white so we're going to put the whites 
here and the yolk here six this is number six
you know what maybe i'll just stick 
to seven seven should be enough  
so we're gonna add the seven 
egg whites to this bowl
i'm gonna eat something first because otherwise i 
cannot make this uh dessert i'm already thinking  
about the brazo de mercedes this is a dutch 
um snack by the way it's called ontbijtkoek  
it's a lot of carbohydrates but it's very nice 
if you're hungry for a snack you know in between  
have you tried brazo de mercedes with other 
colors i think it could also be really nice  
Pogi Pogi are you excited for brazo the 
mercedes Pogi i think Pogi is not excited today  
maybe he prefers adobo so let's turn on the oven 
we're gonna preheat this one at 180 degrees okay
you know what i really missed from the 
philippines it is the bakeries you know and  
not just the bakeries where they sell the pandesal 
but where they sell those delicious cakes you know  
some of the sweet uh bakeries that 
i've seen they have so many nice sweets  
and it's always nice when you go out for dinner 
and then you go you pass the bakery and you bring  
some home right with share with your family 
that's what i really miss from the philippines
first a little bit soft
i hope this is firm enough i hope i did not 
over mix it so we're gonna put this on the tray
carefully
just like that then we'll spread it oh this is 
gonna be so masarap promise promise talaga i  
hope the shape is okay like this you see it's a 
little bit wet here on the sides but i guess it  
should be all right let's quickly put this in the 
oven guys it's already sobrang in it so it should  
be all right i'm gonna put it in the middle 
and leave it there for about 20 minutes okay  
it's now time to make the custard filling 
i'm super excited lemon so i will basically  
add four ingredients to this the egg 
yolks okay i'm gonna add those first
okay i'm gonna heat those up and i 
will also add one can of condensed milk
sweetened condensed milk carefully 
stir those and make a custard  
this already smells great by itself i 
noticed the heat is a little bit too high  
so i will reduce it and then we'll add 
a little bit of vanilla extract tiny bit  
i'm adding one tablespoon of flour to make it 
extra thick and now it gets really thick now it's  
at 80 degrees celsius so i think at first i turned 
it a little bit too high it was like 100 degrees  
now it's getting really thick as 
you can see now let's set this aside  
since the egg whites are almost done
there we go so we're gonna leave it in the oven 
for another five minutes and then we're gonna  
let it cool off so it looks pretty good it looks 
a bit thick so it's gonna be quite hard to roll it  
but let's take it out and leave it for a couple 
more minutes to let it cool off completely you  
see it deflate it a little bit so it might be 
easier to roll now let's put the powdered sugar
tapos another sheet of baking paper 
on top cover it with this rack  
and then we're gonna turn it around
turn around
remove the paper last time i did do this 
a little bit too fast did you see my first  
brazo de mercedes so the first one i made 
was approximately six months ago that was  
the first ever so i'll put the link in the 
description for you okay you can watch it later  
time to put the custard so as you can 
see i made the custard a bit more a bit  
thicker last time also i've made a bit more 
custard this custard smells great with the  
vanilla extract you know it's really 
nice i'm gonna spread it out set up  
i tasted a little bit of it it's uh really set up 
but uh slightly matamis of course it's a dessert  
moment of truth i'm gonna try to roll it promis 
ha you will share this video if you like this dish  
just kidding guys see i put a little bit 
too much custard don't worry i'm gonna  
eat that i will cut a piece of the side 
first so that it looks a little bit nicer  
so let's see my parents filipino food reaction  
magandang gabi po i put it in the fridge for 
about one hour hopefully it's good to cut thicker
very often i make drawings because i like that 
to do and that's most flowers but in this time  
i make most women women and dogs and children 
and colorful things colorful things paintings  
yes so let us know in the comments what 
you think of my mom's paintings okay yes  
i liked it i liked this very much my mom 
looked forward to all the comments yeah  
this knife is super sharp i can already feel it 
so we're gonna try to cut the brazo de mercedes
oh this is so sharp look beautiful the insides  
i don't make two big pieces because these are very 
matamis sweet i like the mata no misunderstanding  
oh this uh the knife is super sharp 
this brass of the mercedes is very tiny
okay this is brazo de mercedes from the 
philippines and the weather is also from the  
philippines today yes it's a 27 degrees looks like
