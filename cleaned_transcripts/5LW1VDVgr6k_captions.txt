Good morning. today we have come to the main parts of Bohol 
Island we've driven about 1.5 hours from Panglao  
Island where we were staying in the last video 
and we're now in a small town called Loboc  
today we're going to do a bit of exploring 
around this island we were thinking of staying  
on this island but we looked at accommodation 
but nothing really met our needs and we really  
like Panglao Island so we decided to change 
hotels to a still a really nice one but way  
cheaper literally two minutes down the road from 
the one we were staying at so the move was super  
easy and it is way cheaper than the one we were 
staying and the Wi-Fi is still good this wi-fi is  
still good it's really really nice I would 
say it's arguably as nice as the other one  
maybe the room is like less fancy but it's way 
cheaper we haven't had breakfast today because  
the first thing that we're going to is kind 
of like a lunch thing yeah it's not really a  
breakfast thing right it's a lunchtime thing 
we just happened to be here like 10 10 30 in  
the morning because we have loads of other things 
that we want to do today we want to make sure that  
we have time to do them all so we'll have to eat 
early. Doors are open already. good morning
Dylan, yes and Adriana okay write your name thank you
so many counters that was the most well-oiled 
machine yeah I've ever been in basically you  
arrive they Usher you to level one 
and then you're like filling that in  
and then level two and filling that in and 
like within 10 seconds these are postcards  
like the tickets come as a kind of postcard oh 
that's really nice whoever leaves the nicest  
comments gets a postcard from us oh yeah each 
yes okay so two people no the comment I guess  
the most likes okay the comment with the 
most likes we'll get a postcard yes okay  
and what do we do with the second postcard no 
no whereas in second place also okay so the  
two top liked comments on this video will get 
a postcard each so you'll have to give us your  
address but not in the comments don't give your 
address out to uh strangers hello hello
This one? thank you. what time do they go? 11:02.
okay what time is it 10 47. okay thank you okay 
we got some time there's loads of boats here I was  
under the impression that are we in a rush? No 
they're messing with us they're like hurry
oh are we going through this one 
to the next one maybe it looks like
oh wow your mask just just the food and then you can
take it off. okay no problem we have to walk  
through another boat to get to this boat 
so the boat looked super empty this was  
the last seat on the phone we just had 
to walk through another one I think the  
food has already started we can go and grab 
whatever we want and get munching I'm curious what they have
oh wow look at that yeah I don't know 
if it is just coffee and jelly you know
oh wait he's actually singing I thought this 
was just playing they were playing a trick
this is the best seat look we're going forward 
well we were totally rushed to come on this boat  
I don't know how often they go but as soon as 
we turned up we basically came on I think we  
were one of the last people yeah we got the last 
table but that's worked in our favor because we  
got the view going forward I thought we were 
at the back because they came in but there's  
a live band playing the food this insane quality 
and just the amount of food there is insane I've  
got some noodles rice some dim sums some fresh 
prawns some lechon and some chicken adobo as  
well there's loads of pescatarian options 
and then there's loads of desserts this is  
what I'm excited about I want to finish this 
so I can eat that per person it is 850 pesos  
to go on this because it takes one hour 
so I think they do a loop-de-loop because  
they did say that we come back to where we 
got on which is really good for us because  
we actually drove our bike there but I can't 
believe we're at the front of this boat like  
this is the best seat of the house this is 
awesome oh we got such good weather for it
it's so nice
that's nice that's a really good coffee. This boat 
cruise is so nice we're getting epic views of  
the jungle driving through here and the band 
is pretty good playing songs in like Chinese  
Tagalog English I can't tell what the other 
languages are but it's very nice oh banana bread
Oh that's good I can't believe it I'm 
so nice such a clear day this is only  
the first thing today it's like a full 
day of activities so the man that was  
singing to us just told us that they're 
now going to do a traditional dance here  
in the Philippines so we're just kind 
of like stuffing off for a sec and then  
you can dance with them also I don't think 
I'll be doing that but we get to enjoy it
come on
wow. That was way harder than I thought.
Your turn now!
A whole boat of people, and I'm the only one that went up!
I was snorting so hard it was hilarious
That was really difficult, like coordination between your feet and your mind.
this is so pretty I think we keep going  
I'm getting emotional just had 
to get more of these coffees
waterfall's coming up oh wow this is so peaceful 
isn't it completely different to the boat trip  
we did yesterday that was like so loud oh 
my God this boat is quiet and we're at the  
front where there's no engine so it's nice 
oh is that yes that's where we're going yeah  
Zipline. that was intense we've got a 
few fun things planned today that's for sure
these here's our pictures this one the heart the 
thumbs up and the happy one okay thank you real  
quick one of the best parts about living overseas 
is that your money can go a lot further if you're  
smart about it but the hard part is getting there 
to begin with it took us years of work budgeting  
saving side hustles and we still have to work hard 
to stay on top of things especially with inflation  
at record highs and the stock market at record 
lows which makes today's sponsor Masterworks  
even more impressive last year they delivered 
tens of millions to their investors thanks to  
an asset whose Market has had a record-breaking 
year While most other markets suffered double  
digits losses it's fine art while last year 
was the worst year for stock returns since  
2008. each of masterwork's nine sales delivered 
positive net returns to their investors with the  
last three returning 10 13 and 35% Outlets

description box below that was um probably one 
of the funnest things yeah nicest things we've  
done in so long so true I was expecting it to be 
a little bit cheesy but it was just like the music  
was really good the singer was fantastic the 
whole band was great food the food was so good  
the desserts were spectacular the views I didn't 
really know what to expect but it was gorgeous  
everything was just ah so good so obviously we had 
to get some photos to remember the day by I know a  
lot of you have been telling us that we're very 
oily on our videos in our comments but it's not  
oil it's sweat because it's like it's seriously 
hot you know when we're doing these videos plus  
we normally have the driest of complexions so 
maybe yeah but it's also when there's a flash  
or there's a light it just like reflects off our 
face so the lady took these photos look insane we  
look like we're made out of wax they are really 
cute though how cute no these actually need to  
be framed yeah this is so cute while we were 
on that we saw the the next thing that we're  
gonna go on which is like a crazy zip line um we 
didn't know it actually went over the river but  
that's pretty cool yeah I'm super excited I'm 
terrified terrified terrified of heights but  
when you're attached to whatever is high I feel 
like it's less terrifying you know so obviously  
the zipline you can't just jump off of it no 
which is great in my books I'll be strapped in  
oh it's going to be super intense I think it's a 
dual one as well so we can go together that would  
be so cool that was fun all right let's jump back 
on the bike and it's only a five minute drive from  
here everything we're doing today pretty much 
within like half an hour of each other yeah so  
that's pretty good it's so hot outside which is 
amazing but ah because our bike seat is black  
luckily we have a towel on the side that we can 
sit on otherwise we will literally burn our butts  
nice there we go yeah it's really hot oh 
yeah oh look that's always so soft nice
oh my gosh hearing men scream is always 
a lot more intense isn't it that sounds  
like it's going pretty fast actually there's a 
zip line in Wales actually there's a couple in  
Wales that are like the fastest in the world 
or in Europe I've never actually been because  
we've been out of the country for so long but 
this looks like it's up there with with that  
wasn't this one supposed to be the longest in 
Philippines and the highest I don't know it  
was two cool things but I can't remember what the 
second cool fact was hello hello zipline yes yes
hello this is the loboc eco-tourism Adventure 
Park so they have a few things here but we're  
gonna do the zipline over the river apparently 
that we've just seen first thing we have to do is  
treck up to the top I don't think it's 
that far no we just had food though yeah  
I feel like doing something adrenaline adrenalini 
after eating it's a little bit intense but yeah  
wow Bohol is really nice it's just like an 
Island full of nature trees waterfalls water  
zip lines this zip line was 500 pesos each but 
you get two goes so you get one that goes over  
the river and then comes back how do you feel 
Out of breath from climbing but I'm not nervous yet  
I think I'll be nervous when I see the top yeah
Should've worn our motorbike helmets. YEah, haha.
Mine was too big I think. My head is misleadingly small.
thank you
front of the queue
there's nothing actually holding 
us in we're just gravity okay
that was so much faster than I expected 
I set off so fast yeah he pushed you I  
think oh wow it's so high up I didn't 
realize how high it would be when we  
were with the river I was like oh my 
God for a second I was like I could  
feel myself turning like this I was like 
oh my God is this safe now for round two
sweden with love okay bye bye
thank you whoa you passed me I took 
off slower that time and I came past  
you wow but I won again oh my God my 
cheeks are hurting smiling so much
that was so good and for only 500 pesos each and 
you have a massive line on your head yeah I think  
the helmet was a little bit too small but the 
other one was too big so it's fine it has like  
Safety First you know you weren't actually stuck 
to anything you were just lying on that little  
um yeah sheet and then gravity was putting you 
down yeah quite scary it was quite intense and  
especially when it really dropped down 
and then the river was below you and then  
I overtook Dylan so I looked to the side and I 
was like oh everything is just like a little bit  
terrifying and The Landings are like woo. I don't 
know if anyone else does this but every time  
I'm on a zipline I'm trying to look at if I 
fall where am I gonna land oh no I don't do  
that water okay I'm carrying water trees okay 
I'm gonna land on that tree contingency plan  
all right on to the next spot yeah
this road trip I say road trip because we've 
probably been driving for about two hours in  
total has been so right why don't I actually 
don't know what the time is to be honest but  
it's been so nice like the roads are perfect but 
we were just driving through place that's called  
the man-made forest and as soon as you went in 
there it was like so cool it was cold yeah and  
like the trees the trees were coming like over 
the road both ways basically completely enclosed  
in like trees I'm not sure what the man made apart 
um they're saying obviously they're real trees but  
um it was a reforestation project yeah that 
makes sense put trees back yeah but we're now  
in a place where we're probably gonna have to 
look at some things from afar yeah that's why  
I got my glasses out I'm so excited I have 
been dying to see these cute little things  
since I found out about them I didn't actually 
know I knew that there was cute little animals  
like this but I'd never actually heard of them 
properly before yeah hello two regular please. thank you
look at that look how tiny
thank you very much we're gonna have to 
be a little bit quiet here so bear with  
us while we try and find these animals 
are called a tarsier and I think they're  
the smallest mammal on the planet they're 
nocturnal so they might be sleeping right  
now but also they live for up to 24 years 
let's hope we can find some apparently
apparently each eye ball weighs more than their brain
Just like you. I don't have big eyes
or a big brain trying to find one
is that one in the tree
long hot day so far so we were just walking 
around and we couldn't find anything for a  
while and then there was a lady there telling 
us where to find these tarsiers but they're so  
small they were like this big really tiny even 
even smaller than I had anticipated yeah most  
of them were sleeping yeah but we got to see one 
that opened its eyes because the forest kind of  
got a bit windy or like yeah I think it's like 
there's insects starting to make noise it was  
always like cicadas were going off I don't 
really know what was happening a little bit  
louder and it turned its head opened its eyes and 
we were like ah it felt like it was staring into  
our souls yeah it was the most amazing thing 
tickets were 120 pesos each which is pretty  
affordable really to see something that's so you 
know endangered and I think last year during the  
um the typhoon a lot of them passed away I 
guess so yeah now there's not that many of  
them but really cool the cutest animal ever yeah 
when it opened its eyes I could have cried anyway  
we have one last stop ever our full fun-filled 
adventure day here in Bohol I'm super excited  
yeah but it's like a little bit far further out I 
think half an hour drive from here yeah let's go
I didn't realize we'd have to walk up about a 
million steps to go up to this stop the view  
is so cool though I haven't even looked to this 
side I was so concerned about tripping over on  
the steps we're currently on the viewing platform 
for a place called Chocolate Hills the name might  
sound a little bit confusing because they don't 
look like chocolate Hills right now because  
we're currently towards the end of rain season so 
they're actually growing we know that pretty well  
yeah yeah exactly so they're growing all sorts 
of green things on them it's another Green Hills  
but normally they're in the dry season they're 
chocolate looking fun this place though this place  
called Chocolate Hills is a UNESCO world heritage 
site as well and there's 1700 of these Mounds  
probably way further than we can see here but 
this is only one of the viewing points and there's  
a lot of people here it is very nice we picked 
the best day to do it oh today has been the most  
glorious day in terms of what we've been up to and 
weather it's just been blue skies all around you  
can see a few clouds now but it's been hot it's 
been Sunny yeah it's just absolutely amazing we're  
so happy and we're so so happy it's literally been 
the best day I have loved every single moment of  
this from starting it with an actual River Cruise 
where we had the best table yeah I can't believe  
that so like that little toes you're turning 
and looking at us and zip liners the zipline  
was awesome this is really beautiful I think 
there's a lot more to do on this island as well  
and in Philippines in general like I think there's 
a lot of activities you can do in the Philippines  
yeah we're gonna do some more yeah we're gonna do 
plenty plenty plenty more we still have a few more  
islands that we want to see this time around in 
this trip but like we've mentioned before we are  
planning to come back sort of during the summer 
time in the Philippines and do some island hopping  
then too yeah yeah loads of exciting things to 
come so for now we'll see you in the next video bye
