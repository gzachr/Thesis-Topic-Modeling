I'll be honest and say that when I first got
to Puerto Princesa I was not a fan primarily
because I had next to no cell service or Wi-Fi
for basically three days and I don't know
how that's possible in the largest city on
Palawan Island the hotel I stayed at a very
well-rated hotel in the center of town didn't
have working Wi-Fi for about five days this
last day that I'm leaving it finally works
and strangely with my cell phone I have a
globe SIM card which has been working great
everywhere else gets like one bar of service
in most places that are downtown Puerto Princesa
I don't understand it I don't see how in the
largest city on this island they have such
poor connections but in the last few days
of being here I have enjoyed myself so much
more I found some really great spots in the
city that I think are really nice that are
really beautiful some great restaurants and
of course the biggest attraction of this area
is the underground river which was my prior
Vlog and it was amazing so 100 I am happy
I came here and I would recommend you guys
checking it out but just expect that maybe
um you won't have access to the outside world
depending on uh the Wi-Fi situation and also
sad but true today is my last day in the Philippines
guys it has come up so quickly it's been only
three weeks being here in the Philippines
and usually I spend two or three months in
a country so in a way I feel like I just got
here and now I'm leaving a hundred percent
I will be coming back like a hundred percent
uh I want to come back to the Philippines
it has been such an amazing time and there
are so many places that I want to discover
but yeah in today's video I guess I just wanted
to show you a little bit of Puerto Princesa
we are on the bay walk right now and I have
about an hour and a half until I need to be
back at my hotel uh to take my stuff to the
airport so this is more or less going to be
a very casual sort of chatty Vlog because
I don't think I've really talk to you guys
about what's been going on in my life outside
of travel and you know obviously some things
I'm going to keep personal but just kind of
tell you on a more human side what's all been
going on [Music] foreign
[Music]
thank you
I feel like it's only appropriate that my
last meal in the Philippines is at Jollibee
don't you guys agree
every time I come here I swear it's so busy
like every single Jollibee I see it's always
packed which makes sense because it is delicious
but I actually don't know what I should get
today uh for sure I want the fried chicken
because that is delicious but in a way I feel
like I should try the burgers so I don't know
I decided to try The Best of Both Worlds where
I got chicken but it's almost like a burger
it's a chicken sandwich and apparently this
is one of their new menu items so I think
it's going to be delicious and then I'm also
trying their fries because the last time I
was here I got the spaghetti so we'll see
how their fries are and last but not least
I also wanted to try their peach mango pie
all right
customer number 2034 please proceed to the
counter area thank you
so while this is super good personally I preferred
I don't know the original chicken so to say
just like the drumstick of the chicken that
I did last time and then the pie the pie is
also good but I preferred the coconut one
that I got last time fries they're okay I
wouldn't say they're my favorite all in all
Jollibee it's a hit
so initially I was going to get a tricycle
uh back to my hotel but I actually have a
bit of time before I have to be there so why
don't we go on a little walk and I'll kind
of touch on what's been going on so I don't
think I have to go into detail when talking
about the atrocities that have been happening
in Ukraine for almost a year now for those
of you who are new to my channel and maybe
don't know I'm originally from Ukraine I was
born in Kiev and moved to Canada when I was
five and while my mom and dad live in Canada
I do have some relatives that are you know
very close to me that are still currently
there in Kiev and half of them being men they're
not allowed to leave the country because of
the mobilization the last couple of months
Russia has basically gone back to bombing
all parts of Ukraine and especially with winter
coming up and then bombing energy infrastructure
it's basically knocked out the heat in electricity
in most parts of the country it's absolutely
sick what they're doing and obviously every
single day I worry about my family and everything
that's going on there so that has obviously
been weighing quite heavily on me and you
know just in the past month there was actually
a day where there were missile strikes right
in downtown Kiev where my family lives so
like literally a kilometer from our family
apartment you know people died there's huge
holes in the ground and a children's playground
got bombed because that's you know uh military
infrastructure and then outside of everything
that's been happening with Ukraine it's also
been scary because um some of my family and
then very close family friends have been having
some pretty serious health scares thankfully
in this last week we got some you know semi
good news that people are you know on the
right track towards a full recovery but you
know things are still up in the air and it's
just been a really intense time thinking about
how you know we never really know what's going
to happen and that at the end of the day Health
really is the greatest wealth that a person
has on a personal level like a just me not
concerning other people level technically
everything has been great like obviously can't
complain uh with working my dream job seeing
all these amazing places being in plus 30
instead of minus 30 when I see all the serious
problems that people all over the world are
facing it's obviously playing the smallest
violin to complain about you know the little
problems that I have myself but at the same
time you know you never want to invalidate
yourself because we all go through very severe
difficult times and then we have our regular
day-to-day kind of stuff so it really has
been a mix um at the end of the day like I
said I feel so grateful that I get to do this
job and uh I realize just how important it
is to me especially in these uh difficult
times with war going on because this literally
is my outlet to just pretend like that stuff
doesn't exist you know at least for a day
or two and just focus on showing people amazing
places and it is a sort of Escape that's why
I basically decided to not really do a lot
of political videos on my channel because
I think if I did do that kind of stuff all
the time I just know I would be a shell of
a person like I already you know sit in that
kind of stuff enough as it is in my personal
life I don't really want to be doing it in
my work life as well and just never have any
Joy so maybe some people will call that selfish
that's you know up to them to form their own
opinions but for me personally it's been really
important to have an outlet on these times
when I don't think about all the Terrible
Things happening in the world because there's
more than enough of that out there
[Music] thank you thank you
[Music] all right guys I am in Puerto Princesa
airport not a super big place but I am flying
with Cebu Pacific just in front of me um to
Manila and then from Manila I'm going straight
to Ho Chi Minh
all right well I got here way too early you
just never know right like these days they
say you should get to the airports early because
a lot are having delays postcovid and since
I am on an international flight they say it
should be at least two and a half hours three
hours beforehand so that's what I did but
now I basically have two and a half hours
to chill here at this very little terminal
until I get to Manila and then in Manila I
will actually have a four hour wait but Manila
is a very big airport and I think my credit
card lets me get into the lounge there so
I might go chill out there for a while and
on my flight from Manila leaves at like 11
p.m so that means I'm gonna get into Ho Chi
Minh at like 1am [Music]
foreign [Music]
[Music] guys we made it through immigration
officially leaving the Philippines but we
did get in about an hour late meaning now
I only have about two hours until my flight
starts boarding so I actually don't know if
I want to go to a lounge um I also have like
2 000 Filipino pesos left so instead of exchanging
it maybe I'll just buy food at the airport
here and then save the lounge passes for another
place
I feel like I'm in the U.S of a with these
portions at first I was just going to get
this which is already enough for like 12 I
guess but then the Fresh Salad which I wanted
you couldn't get with this so I got it on
the side and it has to come with a soup and
it was only three dollars so with a beer water
and everything this was actually only about
16 US Dollars which sure for the Philippines
is a lot of money but considering how much
food there is that's not bad
I'm fading fast guys it's almost 11 p.m and
my flight should be boarding real soon here
and I wish I could be crawling into a nice
warm bed right now I always try and avoid
you know flights where I'm getting into a
new country especially um really late at night
but sometimes it just can't be helped where
there were no other flights to Ho Chi Minh
available I was about to go grab a coffee
but I thought no maybe I can actually sleep
even two hours on the plane and then by the
time I get to Ho Chi Minh I just need to get
to immigration I need to get a SIM card apparently
you can get one at the airport get some cash
and then get a grab to my hotel [Music]
thank you [Music]
thank you
all right friends we made it to Ho Chi Minh
I'm so excited to be here but I forgot that
there's a time difference with the Philippines
where we're an hour behind here meaning it's
like almost 2 A.M and uh Manila so uh yeah
by the time I get to my hotel is probably
going to be like 4 am so definitely a long
day of travel but hopefully everything goes
well I'm just gonna wait on my bag and then
uh I'm really hoping that the SIM card kiosks
that I read they have here in the airport
are going to be open I think it's vital that
uh I wrote down was like the best one to get
and then if I have a SIM card I'm just gonna
order a grab to take me to my hotel [Music]
I'm so happy guys everything went so well
everybody here super nice though the immigration
officer was very Stern not as fun as my Filipino
experience but you know they let me through
and that's what counts so I'm already in my
hotel and I'm like in a triple room because
I guess that's all they had available I had
booked a room with two double beds because
my special guests will be here in four days
so we needed a room with two beds but this
will do but yeah guys I am in Vietnam and
Good morning Vietnam because it is two in
the morning right now or even three in the
morning I don't know I actually have a wind
of energy because I'm just so excited to be
here so I hope you guys enjoyed the video
let me know your thoughts in the comments
have you been to Vietnam what was your experience
and as always I'm sending you so much love
I hope you're having a fantastic day and keep
being your own kind of beautiful bye guys
