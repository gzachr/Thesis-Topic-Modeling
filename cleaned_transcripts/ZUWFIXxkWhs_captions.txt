- [Group] Hi.
- Hi Liz.
I haven't seen you since
before the pandemic.
I know.
It's so good to see you.
We got the team.
- [Liz] Yes.
- Kinda back.
- [Liz] Yeah, yeah.
- The three Amigos.
(group laughs loudly)
Hi camera.
I know you're stalking me.
(upbeat music)
Something keeps happening here,
where I'm trying to log
into Microsoft office
but it keeps giving it to me in Tagalog.
I'm guessing.
So I have no idea what
it's trying to tell me.
Do you know how I change
my settings on this?
Or can you explain to me
what this actually means?
- Stalker.
- Stalker.
See ya guys.
- [Liz] Bye.
(group laughs loudly)
- So when I first came to the Philippines
I thought that everybody
here spoke English
and that's true, kinda,
actually not really.
What I found out is that
everybody here speaks
Tagalog
which is the main language.
Most people speak English
but if you're in regional areas,
a lot of people speak
whatever's the local
language in that area.
So for example right now, I'm in Cebu
and I found out that
most people speak Bisaya.
I need to go upstairs
Come with me.
So once I got to Cebu,
I learned pretty quickly
that even though most
people speak English here
if I didn't learn Bisaya,
I wouldn't understand
sometimes up to 90% of
what people are saying
in a given day with me.
And the other thing I find is that
if the conversation ever becomes important
where I really need to
know what people are saying
that's most likely when people
are gonna speak Bisaya
so I'm totally lost.
(upbeat music)
A lot of people will speak English
but sometimes it really
depends on their age group.
So sometimes what I'll find is that
people that are younger,
maybe people up to their thirties
will be most likely to speak English
but especially in some
of the province areas
from what I can tell
it seems like some of the older generation
doesn't speak that much English.
So I've been in situations with people
where they know that I don't
speak Tagalog or Bisaya
and I know they don't
speak English very good
and we wind up sign languaging things
and using Google translate a lot.
Fortunately, people here are so friendly.
It's not too difficult
to figure it all out.
But for me, I care so much
about connecting with
people on a personal level.
Now without knowing their language
sometimes I feel locked.
To be honest I even feel
a bit lonely at times
because sometimes the experience's like,
if you've ever been in a crowded room
and there's a group of
people that maybe you go over
and maybe you know who,
you're trying to connect with
but maybe they don't know you
and start to whisper.
You can't hear them very well.
And you feel excluded.
That's what it feels like
for me at times here.
Where I'll be in a room of people
even people that I know
and I'm close to and I love
and they'll be talking
and we'll all be on the same time talking
about a particular conversation
but then they'll start speaking Bisaya
or one of the other languages here
and then it's kinda like
that moment where everybody's whispering
and I don't understand what's being said
and I feel a bit left out.
So we're gonna head over to
IT Park in just a second.
Right now we're at the top floor of Avenir
where Purple Cow Agency
and Delish Deli are.
But just down there
there's a place called IT park
where there's a lot of large businesses
from JP Morgan Chase to McDonald's
to a lot of BPO type
of businesses as well.
(upbeat music)
So one of the other things
that I've noticed here is that
even if locals can speak
English really good
they're mostly really shy
to speak to a foreigner.
(motorcycle exhaust roaring)
That was really loud.
It is so loud.
For whatever reason
and I think that they think that,
their English is maybe good
enough to talk to others here
but maybe not to someone
that speaks English as the first language.
But overwhelmingly,
I think with the exception
maybe of Singapore,
I've never been to another country in Asia
that has so many people
that speak English so well.
That's one of the reasons why we moved
Purple Cow Agency here
is because a lot of our employees
are talking with people overseas
in the US and in Australia.
We have different people
working as outsourced employees
and they need to be able
to speak with our clients really well
and because people speak
English here so well
it makes it a lot easier to do that.
So right now we're on
our way over to IT Park.
IT Park is a great example
of one of the areas
at Cebu City that's
really growing like crazy.
There's businesses that
employ thousands of people
over there.
Most of them are up during
the night, Philippines time
because they're talking to customers
in the US and in other countries as well.
When I was a little bit younger
if you would call the phone company
or other customer service
normally would find that you were talking
to somebody in India.
But these days that shifted a lot
where for the last nine or 10 years,
Philippines has overtaken India
as the Business Process
Outsourcing capital of the world.
Especially with customer service.
Whether you realize it or not,
when you call your cable company
or your phone company in the US
mostly you're talking to somebody
that's in the Philippines.
You might think they're in the same city
as you are close by
but more often than not
they're right here in
somewhere like Cebu City
and IT Park where we're going right now.
So when I was a kid,
one of the video games
that I used to like to
play was called Frogger.
And with Frogger, you
were a frog in the game
and you would have to jump on to logs
and dodge different things in the water
to be able to make it across the street.
Trying to cross the road
in Cebu City is a little bit like that.
You just hope that you can
make it to the other side
without needing another life.
We survived to play
another game of Frogger.
(upbeat music)
There's also like Shakey's Pizza
it's over here too
if you feel like.
(upbeat music)
Hi, we're just going to Abaca.
(Guard) You need a face shield.
A face shield to go into Abaca?
(Guard) A full face shield.
Not allowed, no face shield.
So this is one of the
challenges during the pandemic.
You don't bring a mask for sure
you're not allowed to go anywhere.
But if you don't have a face shield
sometimes you find out that
they don't let you inside.
Even if once you get in there
you're gonna take it off immediately.
Really stupid.
(laughs loudly)
Everything's been a ghost
town around here in IT Park
in terms of businesses being open.
There's still been a lot of
businesses that have been open
but not the retail type businesses
like the restaurants.
So Jollibee is one of
the most famous places
to eat in the Philippines.
I guess it's like, McDonald's.
Say hi to Jollibee.
Thank you sir.
- Thank you sir.
- Come on, get whatever you want.
Don't be shy.
Can I get a peach mango pie?
- [Attendant] Peace mango pie.
That will be 10 minutes sir.
- No problem.
Actually, let's get for the team
some peach mango pie too.
So we're at Jollibee today
because the secret man behind the camera,
we were having a
conversation the other day
and I was telling him
that we put Delish Deli on,
Let's Eat Bai
and let's eat bai kinda means like
let's eat dude.
But here it's actually
the name of kinda like a
foodie type of Facebook group
that people in the
Philippines locally follow
to see what new restaurants are out
and what they should buy.
So the name of the page is, Let's Eat Bai.
But because there was a bit
of a language misunderstanding
Sef thought that I was
taking him out for lunch.
So I owed him one.
So here we are.
(upbeat music)
So we're gonna stand by the
air conditioning for a second.
One of the things with COVID is
they don't have the air conditioning
going quite as often.
So you wind up sweating
to death anywhere you go.
There is an adorable
baby out there trying to
talk to Jollibee.
So one of my favorite things at Jollibee
they have something
like this at McDonald's
and McDonald's they have
cherry pies and apple pies
but even better at Jollibee,
they got these peach mango pies.
I love these things.
We got a whole bag full
for the whole team at
Purple Cow and Delish Deli.
There'll be excited when
we get back with these
later today.
Something I have to say about Jollibee
they have great fries.
I really shouldn't be eating these
because I've got way too
fat during the pandemic
but I can't resist it.
You wanna try one?
It's really up to me as the foreigner here
to learn the language.
When I first came here
I actually had a Bisayan teacher
because I already knew in advance
how important understanding
the language was gonna be.
But with the busyness of
starting the first business
and just acclimatizing through a new time
and everything new around me.
Literally.
I didn't have the teacher for too long.
So just recently again,
we put out a job post to
find another Bisaya teacher
and I think this time
11 months down the track of living here,
I'll be able to adapt
and to learn the language a lot quicker.
So we're thinking through
the different ideas
that we're talking about.
One way, it's about language.
Really, It's about communication.
It's about understanding.
Ultimately it's about relationship.
How do I connect with people
from a different culture
with different ideas that use words
that I don't quite
understand yet challenging
but it's worth the effort.
Wait, just a second before we go.
- [Camerman] What's that?
- He has something to tell me?

(upbeat music)
Guess what I brought?
Not chicken.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Thank you sir.
- You are welcome.
- Thank you Santa Claus.
(laughs loudly)
- Everybody here has been so hospitable
and it's been such a wonderful
place to spend this year
even in the middle of a pandemic.
One of these days, I'm gonna
need some English subtitles
because I'm gonna be speaking in Bisaya
the whole episode.
I get to be Santa Claus
a little bit early.
Hello, hello.
- Thank you.
