gonna propose to Louise now this has
been a long plan in the making first had
to ask permission from the Reese's mum
unfortunately I didn't record the sound
annoying but trust me she's saying these
are tears of joy okay
tears of joy honestly I'm not lying
they're tears of joy as family is the
most important thing to the Rees I
really wanted the family to be here for
this unfortunately I couldn't get her
mum above around work to come here but I
could get someone so here I am at the
airport so about further adue me Tina
Louise's sister yay
I may be emotional
I just thought you're above our
permission yes they gave me
okay so eNOS been teaching me to garlic
for the last month Louise doesn't think
I know any Tagalog the reason native
language basically so it should be quite
suffice
tonight when I I'm gonna perform I'm
gonna sing sugar in Tagalog sugar kind
of Awesome that's the song that came out
where we started dating so it became our
song unfortunately so yeah she should be
quite surprised when I start seeing in

thinking you're thinking well of course
she's gonna know something's up you

just got you kvz yesterday so what I'm
saying is I brought her out in case you
didn't get the UK tourist visa and then
we could celebrate if we did get it and
be happy if we do because just over here

talked to your boss and she gave you
Monday off for the record the really
what I'm doing today when she woke up it
