this is wild
yes come on the ball
welcome back to manila everyone as you can see we 
have come to the mall of asia today we know that  
the philippines is known for their shopping malls 
and this one is actually one of the biggest in the  
world yeah it's actually got over 600 stores over 
200 restaurants and over 200 000 visitors per day  
go through this mall that's a crazy amount of 
people it's absolutely massive it's also our  
uber driver told us has the biggest ikea in the 
world in the philippines the biggest ikea and it  
was only open this year and it's actually the 
only ikea in the philippines too that's nuts  
can't wait to head inside and check out the 
mall i guess yeah see what it's got to offer
okay first impressions this 
place is absolutely massive  
we're going to try and find a map just so we 
can see what we're actually like aiming to  
look for and stuff there seems to be shops 
from all around the world here from the uk  
from america from europe so we can try and find 
a map and just see what exactly we want to see  
so we're not aimlessly wandering around 
because you could spend hours you've  
spent all day in here just wandering around yeah 
i think one thing i have noticed is a lot of the  
shopping malls we've been to before have been 
like six or so floors but this one seems to only  
be three but the difference is it's a lot longer 
yeah a lot more spread out so you can easily get  
more lofty i guess and definitely take a just 
to find what you're actually looking for yeah
we've come to the big food court there seems 
to be loads of different options but we haven't  
heard of anyone before none so we chose to eat 
after a suzuki man are we just waiting for our  
food now so they've given us one of these and when 
it closes we'll go collect it so yeah we just gone  
for that and we're just right there there seems 
to be a really cool sort of vibe in this food  
court they've got lots of different like outdoor 
plants uh they've got the outdoor like light but  
across as you can see in the background there it 
almost makes you feel like you're outside yeah  
and this the ceiling's black as well so 
it looks like yeah it looks really cool  
so we both went for the teriyaki rice balls i had 
no idea what is going to happen but it looks like  
we've got some chicken rice teriyaki sauce and 
they've got a couple of vegetables and things  
looks like we've got some pepper 
i think this could be sweet
all right
that's so good okay so we're just coming out of 
the food hall behind us now and we've spotted  
today is a full ice rink i've never seen an 
ice drink inside the shop before that is crazy  
should we check it out to see if we could 
do it yeah let's see if we can get tickets  
it is uh we the uber driver to tell 
us it's like their holidays now  
yeah so it might be quite busy but yeah 
there's a full-on ice rink so cool okay  
so we can't get tickets for the next slot so i 
think we're gonna bother but there's also archery
there's also artery and the laser arena here 
as well they've literally got everything  
yet all in one shopping mall there's a big 
entertainment floor basically on the third floor
we just won like a big amount of tickets 
like 800 tickets here um but we're not  
going to use them so i think we're just 
going to find it just to give it to i think  
okay so we've come to sort of like an outdoor 
indoor area now and there's like there's  
restaurants all aligned inside and then outside 
then there's like these little shacks selling  
different foods and things as well it's really 
really pretty and these little anthems are so nice  
okay we've gone across a bridge and we have 
spotted some sort of fun fair thing park  
we're still in the mall this is wild i've 
never seen a fun venus shopping mall before
okay so you find the first we're gonna go 
on it was only 150 pesos each was about  
two pound i think which is really affordable
so we've seen that the view up 
here it's also really really good  
it's a nice air-con machine i've never seen 
an air conditioning wheel uh yeah the vehicle  
is supposed to be really good it actually 
got really high and i think you're going  
to be surprised at how much you can actually 
see from the top but yeah it's really cool  
we've come to the arcade event 
falls off let's try and live
last one
oh
okay we're playing another game we've got a bucket 
of rings string toss um good shot is it yeah
please
okay so we've got a new companion to uh to the 
channel what should we name it i don't know  
but we can't take it anywhere but it's not fitting 
in our bags uh i don't quite know how we're gonna  
get this enough for like tomorrow i think we're 
gonna give it to someone we're gonna have to find  
someone to give it yeah our game is really 
hard as well i'm just i'm just on fire today  
i think we got to play another one yeah actually 
no i don't think there's a point cause we're just  
winning who are winning prizes and we can't do 
it we need to uh give it to someone now again  
i feel like alice would have liked this oh she 
would have ashley's niece would have loved this  
sorry alice we can't bring it home it won't fit oh 
sorry we just won this but we can't take it back  
it won't fit and i was so pissed
that's okay i'm sure that guild would be a 
lot happier having that unicorn than we will
there's also a bowling alley here i 
can't believe how much is here there's  
a ball in an ice rink a lasers on an 
artery uh the whole theme park outside  
four play areas about three 
cinemas a couple of arcades

spend all day i think you could spend  
all weekend yeah to be honest if they 
had a hotel in there oh belgian waffles

this place is already massive  
but they seem to be making it bigger 
because they're renovating more shops
