but they have a new singer
and he is amazing.

- Arnel has an extraordinary story.
He's Filipino and of course,
Filipinos are known
for being able to sing,
however he had a really
difficult start in life.
He grew up with his mother and father.
And his mother really
really got him into music
but by the time he was 13 she had died,
and his Father was so poor
that he ended up living
on the streets and had to ration biscuits
to be able to eat and survive
and it's just amazing to
see just how far he's come.
At age 15 he became the
lead singer of a band
and the rest is history.
He get some working.
He became really famous in
the 1980s in the Philippines
and then 2007 is when he got
international recognition with Journey.

- What is amazing about him, and his voice
is very very similar to Steve Perry's
in that it is just crystal
clear, great chord closure.
Very, very high set.
It's very, very easy up here
and this is not easy for most men.
And he's got this wonderful, wonderful mix
that is just fluid.
- [Arnel] Put your hands
up while you're singing.
- You can hear it when he speaks there
that he's up in his mix.
It's higher than where
I'm speaking, of course.
♪ Circus life ♪
♪ Under the big top world ♪
- Lovely, easy vibrato.
♪ We all need the clowns ♪
♪ To make us smile ♪
- And forward placement.
so you can hear his vibrato,
that's a really good sign.
Often what people do is
they can hit this note,
they can't get vibrato on.
They haven't got the freedom there yet.
But it means it is so controlled
when you're just able to
sustain and put that vibrato on.
Often you can't sustain
on these high notes.
Oh, he's wicked.
♪ Through space and time ♪
- Time, really open vowels as well.
♪ Always another show ♪

has lots of open vowels so
it really, really helps.
And also the accent as
well, really, really helps
in the placement of singing.

♪ And being apart ain't
easy on this love affair ♪
- Oh my God he's so perfect.
♪ Two strangers learn

good key for me to sing in
as a female.
♪ I'm forever yours ♪
♪ Faithfully ♪
- It's just so hard to
fill Steve Perry's shoes
and I found someone he
completely smashed it
which is amazing.
He's got the emotion, he's
got the technique, it's ah.
♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh ♪
- Oh I love a sing-a-long.
It's such a clever tune just
having a part of the song
that's for the audience to also sing.
It makes the audience feel
like they are part of the song.
So if you're ever writing a song
and you really wanna get
the audience involved,
so maybe that's something to think about
♪ Oh oh oh oh ♪

♪ I'm still yours ♪

So one thing that I always
fell about these artists
who are just phenomenal,
it's like, I can I've tips and techniques
on how they're singing but
you're never gonna get like this.
One, his voice is just set like that.
It's set mega mega high and
he has huge amounts of talent
but also it takes a lot of work.
If you wanna get there
you have to work so hard
and he just has so much
stability that, yeah.
It's not easy to get a voice like that.
