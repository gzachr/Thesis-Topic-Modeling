- Don't you have contacts? (private joke)
Working on my recommendations...
No, I actually don't.
Some might say that I do
But no, I haven't!
It's been a while since the last time
I made a cocktail.
- You still got it!
I think the last time was in Castelo Branco
when I worked at a pub to pay my Uni tuitions
This was all made with seashells.
-These curtains?
Got some really nice shots!
- Let me see!
Love!
Love!
Jetlag?
Good morning... Good afternoon... Good night!
Remember I spoke about massages on the other vlog?
It's the best thing to reset
Mainly after 22 hours of traveling!
When we went to Thailand
we only booked massages and the end of the trip.
My biggest regret ever!
Ever since we've booked massages
at the beginning and at the end of the trip.
I know you'te recording but I still don't know what to say
This is really special!
We're going to have dinner here at the beach.
This afternoon we were just there
and we noticed something was beeing prepared.
Today we're celebrating the Earth day
soon during one hour, all the lights of the Island
will be turned off to celebrate this day.
Our table is set just by the sea.
We're dining a special menu prepared by the resort's Chef
Let's see what awaits us.
We also saw some rehearsing this afternoon.
Looking forward to it!
I'm doing this vlog 'cause I really loved my stay
and because this last night was so special.
Meeting new people is the best thing about travelling!
This night we met new people,
enjoyed great food,
we were surprised with several performances,
we got handmade crowns...
After dinner, the most fierce
joined the party!
We too, of course!
By the time to leave
another super special moment!
This time I really wasn't expecting it!
We said our goodbyes to Badian with music!
We got a serenade!
I have to be honest...
I kinda got emotional
and I didn't really know what to say
It was beautiful!
Loved our stay at the Badian resort!
