hey everyone welcome to another video 
this is traveling solo Lodge and today  
I'm not traveling so I'm actually with my buddy 
here hey solo members how is it going welcome  
and follow us on this trip yeah so basically 
right now we're in the Philippines and we're  
in a Muslim district over here here you can 
see over here it's all Muslim town and this  
they have actually have the oldest and the 
biggest mosque in Manila we're just want  
to show you guys how it is and also other 
districts too so let's go on and see how
the over here that says Muslim town let's 
walk straight there's actually our first  
time here which is awesome we just we just 
came here a few hours ago to meet up with  
a friend but now the friend has left 
so we just want to show you how it is
this kind of reminds me if I want to 
say someplace in India why would you  
say yeah India Mumbai or something yes 
see people hanging out their clothes  
that's how they dry their clothes 
over there get some fresh watermelon
that's interesting that vehicle over there 
the tricycle yeah it's fixing that well it's  
a bicycle yeah I don't know what you call 
it actually it's a motorcycle with life  
it's nice this this stuff I don't know 
what is this stuff what's that sir what  
is this one say your onions yeah I think it's 
onions let's get let's carry on see what else
see over there on the right is the mosque 
it's called the golden mosque and actually  
was made in 1976 it was created for the 
good off yeah for Omar yeah Gaddafi the  
ex-president of Libya and he actually did 
not come on this visit but since they already  
created the mosque they just you know kept 
it and it's been standing till till today
some nice band Deb cafe we're gonna show you guys 
also some nice Filipino halal food over here so  
stick with us stay with us stay put ladies and 
gentlemen let's see let's see what's over here
land up Kevin this is what they have 
empanadas tuna sandwich okay very nice  
little kids hello kids hello little took took cars
this is definitely one of the most 
interesting places I saw where I'm  
asked is how are you sure yeah Wow 
hey I came and described it well this  
is the entrance this is called Manila 
golden mask and cultural center hello
yeah the dome is nice actually the dome I 
believe they want to repair it right now  
because if you see over there there's a sign 
that says don't repair because look it's golden  
but unfortunately the years the paint just you 
know came off yeah you see this as office let  
me see Republic of the Philippines office 
yes it's a rehabilitation for the dome so  
it looks like they want to rehabilitate it 
and here's the mosque so let's step inside  
and see how it is all right so before we get 
in the mosque we got to take off our shoes
okay this is the golden Mosque sound 
like yes so there's a lot of people  
sleeping yeah there was a lot of people 
sleeping here because I guess they just  
like to take breaks here but it's 
very nice and you can see every  
part of the mosque is wrapped with this 
golden lining it's nice material yeah
and you can see over here this is where the 
top is where the dome is right here and you  
can see all the windows over here 
very nice and beautiful architecture
here's where they ma'am or the leader of the 
mosque or do his Friday prayers or any time  
when they pray the leader would be in front 
that's where they you pray and everyone would  
be behind him over here over here is where they 
change the time I believe it's not electronic  
they actually just push it themselves which 
is interesting because other mosques around  
the world it's all electronically done so 
any time when there's a prayer time because  
every day that prayer time changes by a 
little bit so that's why they have that  
have you ever seen that like man-made like 
usually it's electronic right I think it's  
my first time seeing it like this but it suits 
the area and the structure of the place so fun  
check this place out let's see and then it has 
no AC but has a lot of fans just in right now  
this is the winter so it's actually not 
very high and that's beautiful weather  
in the Philippines well I think you become 
in the Sun where we'd be sweating by now
because it's gone back to compact the 
area oh you see here over here is the  
architectures a little bit differently and 
over there in the back is where the ladies  
yes unfortunately I'm not a lady so I can't 
show you and I don't know if the ladies are  
without their hijab which is the headscarf 
oh and maybe they feel uncomfortable if  
I was there to record them so just want to 
show you this is the barrier for the ladies  
yeah for me though okay nice to meet you and 
he's still a man yeah nice to meet you Sarah
yeah you can see over here they also have this is 
oh I see this little kid is selling so I'm okay  
not right now no thank you over here is where 
they learn Arabic are just very interesting I  
don't I guess this is all their old carpet 
actually this is a chapter of the it's from  
surah al-ma'idah which means the tables 
okay it's like the whole version of this  
all right very nice all right let's carry on 
let's go let's go outside and check it out
and now we're going to go outside and we're 
gonna show you more of the surrounding area
and it said that this mosket 
hold I believe 2,200 people  
yes a lot of the kids playing in the street 
having some fun with each other so I want to  
show you just around the mosque like Pulsar 
like over there I do need to put on my mind  
because coronavirus is still hearing it 
strong so I got to put on a mask got your  
mask oh yeah you ready had a mask on from the 
beginning of the video school you attend yeah
here's the Sonics enter my pocket yeah the mother 
cell is actually a place where kids learn Quran in  
Arabic so that's where they go I was an ablution 
area yes where they make what do or evolution  
as he just said and there's the bathrooms via I 
don't think it's all of a dirty inside so there's  
a mosque right now right oh I look at well you 
see the mural on the mouse yeah it's beautiful  
it's like a mosaic design yeah that's actually a 
really interesting one of those motorcycle cars
