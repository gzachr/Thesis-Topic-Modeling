if anyone's going to ask me what's your
number one
protein i'm going to say pork all the
way everyone has a different preference
but we got a pig on the truck for a
reason
hi my name is gil paynumo i'm co-owner
and chef of senior cc
hey i'm evan cadara i'm the co-founder
and ceo of senior cc
senior seasick is a filipino fusion food
truck out here in the bay area
california we fuse filipino flavors with
seasig being the main component
into burritos nachos rice plates tacos
of course we started one truck that was
2010.
now you know it seems like every year we
kind of
grew you know we do san francisco-style
burritos man you have your starch you
have your protein you have a sauce on it
and it's something easy to eat i kind of
look at it like a battery pack you know
like when you're just hungry as hell
you know you get a burrito and just
recharges you
so seasick traditionally is made out of
pork's head traditionally like the snout
and the ears and uh it came from a
province in the philippines
called pampanga over the years seasig
has evolved and so people do it in
different ways
and what we do here we use pork shoulder
so we're here at the commissary in the
bay view the process
over here is basically to cut it about a
quarter inch
so i got a couple ingredients here we
have the vinegar soy sauce
and we also have some of the pineapple
juice so we got salt over here and sugar
minced garlic black pepper and red chili
flakes you get different kind of flavors
from the marinade from the citrus taste
from the vinegar
you get the depth of the soy sauce and
the saltiness
you get the spice of the red chili
flakes and the garlic is going to hit
you
after that even in the beginning we
didn't have a prep kitchen i had my
parents house
and you know you got to start from
somewhere day one the marinating process
was
taking a pork shoulder cutting it by
hand that's just the regular cutting
board and a knife
and again time consuming inconsistency
and and refrigerated
for 48 hours and with this new process
we don't have to do the 48 hours
we can do it in a half an hour and you
can do 300 pounds at one time
so i was born in san francisco but i was
raised in daly city
daly city was predominantly filipinos my
mom and dad decided to open up a
filipino convenience store like kind of
a mini-mart
pampanga is known as the culinary
capital of the philippines
so that's where the best food comes from
is what they say so that's where his
father and his ancestors are from
i was born raised in san francisco and
in my junior year
i transferred to a school in delhi city
when i transferred there gil was one of
the first people i met our families were
both
immigrants that came to this country and
started their own businesses and my dad
came from japan and you know first thing
he did was become a chef out here
i'm i'm half japanese half white so i'm
not even filipino a lot of folks thinks
that
we're both filipino and when they they
realize that we're not both filipino
they're like
oh i get it you're mexican and he's
filipino
senor seasick i always loved to eat
but i didn't have the passion to be a
chef you know my dad would always
try to teach me how to become a sushi
chef
this is how you roll this this is how
you cut the fish and i was
you know i was interested but not as
interested as like how much does this
cost
and how much are we selling it for
so we're going to be taking that
marinated pork we're going to be char
broiling in our charbroiler
so the reason why we want the char we
definitely want the smoky flavor in our
meat
you know almost like a barbecue flavor
that balances out with the acidic
sourness and spiciness of our meat our
staff hand cuts all our meat that's been
char boiled and you're talking about you
know five to six hundred pounds a day
we got all the the pork seasick chop
now there's a final marinade process
we're taking soy sauce lemon juice
red chili flakes and black pepper this
brings it back to life
all the sugar comes out from the soy
sauce which gives it another set of char
on top of the char-broiling that we do
my dad always had that kind of interest
to cook even from
the seasig recipe which i got that
seasick recipe from him
we were constantly making these for
family parties and this is something
that was a treat for
our family to have because they know for
one it's labor intensive and
and it takes a lot of work to do and we
did it right so i went through the whole
california culinary academy
here in san francisco i worked in the
hotel and restaurant industry and kind
of just trying to work my way up
along this whole process i was also
doing music you know i was a rapper
that was another real big passion of
mine i think around 24 is when you know
i was at my job for three years my rap
career was
you know kind of just you know going
okay but not great and
and i was like look i got to figure
something else out i use the analogy of
like
you know most people aren't ready to
fight until somebody starts pushing you
the last mixtape album i put out was
called quit your day job
it's just about if you don't have the
passion for what you're doing
don't waste your life doing that quit
all the things that you're wasting time
with and move forward
we did a show in la and this was around
0809 some folks in l.a were talking
about these korean tacos
and i seen this truck and it and it said
kogi on it and it was like a korean taco
truck there was a long line in the
middle of the day which i've never seen
before and i was like that might be it
and i saw we i jumped back into this
minivan that was had like eight of us in
and i was like guys i might not be
rapping anymore i might like
be dumb you know i just saw this truck
and i'm going in the food i'm gonna
start something i remember
going to gil and the thing i asked him
was are you happy
he stopped and he thought about it and
he was like you know like
nah nah nah not really the biggest i
think leap
after you know working around the
restaurants working around hotels
and working my way up into pretty good
position
to say you know what i want to stop that
and open my own business and start a
food truck and they're like what
what are you talking about even from my
parents to
my colleagues at the hotel i was working
at the time was saying like
man you're crazy when i first bring the
idea of doing senor seasick we didn't
have the name at the point to gil
you know i was like hey let's do
japanese filipino korean
chinese all the all the asian tacos we
made the seasick tacos first that's the
first thing because you already had the
recipe
and once we kind of got that we were
like yo we don't need to
do anything else so i'm going to show
you one of our most
popular items in our menu it's the senor
burrito
all right the first thing i'm going to
do is fry the egg so when we throw the
egg on
any of the items we call it the logic so
traditionally salugit means an egg with
garlic rice
it's a breakfast item but in our menu we
get to throw it on anything you want
so once that cooking i got a 12 inch
tortilla over here
it's important for us to brown on each
side because you want that that burrito
to be insulated with the heat
and also have your your tortilla fully
warmed up you want it gooey
see that little brown spot right there
it's going to bubble up just a little
bit
so first we have our adobo garlic rice
pinto beans i think pinto is a lot
neutral
you know instead of black beans so next
we're going to do our chicken seasig
of course our original seasig is pork
but we also do a chicken version
we use fresh green jalapenos next we're
gonna
add some shredded lettuce with some
purple cabbage mixture
pico de gallo cilantro cream sauce and
lastly i'm gonna throw that egg or
really tops it off
so you see that oozing down then we're
going to take this
and pull it over so this is the senor
seasick burrito salogic with an egg
hella spicy in the beginning it was just
me
ev and we would just run it we'll run
seven days a week and do
as much markets we can if it's like a
morning and a night we're doing it you
know we're just trying to get out there
right after that first truck is like two
trucks and the next year was like three
trucks and we kept on growing
now we have six trucks we have a
restaurant
here in terms cisco and valencia always
continue to grow and
see what what kind of uh you know what's
ahead of us and keep on pushing
[Music]
it's about 5 45 right now we're in my
backyard i'm out here with my barber
cream the barber from dog pass
barbershop in san francisco
i would see cream weekly and then during
the pandemic
when it started i had to start learning
how to cut at least my size
myself you know you got to get it where
you can fit it you know
we out here well i was born and raised
in san francisco
2015 i moved to oakland i had a kid
and we were kind of outgoing our space
in san francisco but at that time
san francisco's rents were really
starting to take off and
to get a reasonable space with bedrooms
for a family in san francisco at that
time was
almost impossible and uh leading up to
the pandemic you know we were probably
one of the most expensive places in
america to live
it kind of feels similar in a way right
now when it comes to the economy
just because it was a little struggle in
2008 as well so
a lot of folks were kind of making
transitions in their careers
which i feel like led up to a lot of
street food as well i really feel like
street food is built
for a pandemic when i heard that there
was a filipino food truck
i was like oh man that's i gotta go and
it was a good thing because that's
that's part of my culture
me and being a filipino you know growing
up in a bay area
to see something like that compete with
like the
the masses you know we're talking about
culturally it's a beautiful thing to see
so
i love it
man well it's another day
it's another day back here
so it's saturday today it's the weekend
you know it's one of our busiest days we
got about
four trucks going out today um and you
know i expect union city to be
pretty busy today they always show up
the first time we went out there
you know like 250 people came out to
come support us
man there's nothing like this there's
nothing like it i mean
it always gets me really pumped coming
in
i mean it's my my home city but like
look at that man
it's a gorgeous city
at the beginning of our day we load the
trucks probably around
7 00 a.m after that we have hooks start
around
8 30 start setting up the truck and
after that we're on the road
then we get to location around probably
9 15 9
20. we open around 11 and serve
to 5 pm
got to do this horn before you leave
i was talking a little bit about evan's
creativity he's not a cook
and he doesn't cook as much but he does
have the vision of like
being risky and trying different things
you know he helped me out with that
because i like to like
be realistic with him like saying like
you know let's let's try something
different or
let's stick to this kind of concept a
little bit more
it kind of aligns me and i just move
forward after that
i don't even know where i'm parking but
i'm just gonna go in here
and try not to get stuck
[Music]
so right now we're doing pork season
fries and i feel like it's a nice
sharing dish or
something for yourself the fries is what
sets it apart first we're gonna take our
fries and put in the basket again these
fries are
lightly coated i wish you had tongues
but they don't just have to bare hand it
i got burns all over my hands i think
the reason why i got this sleeved up is
because
i got a fat ass burn here and i was like
hey i'll just cover with some
some roses and that's cool used to it
i mean it's nacho cheese you know you
can't go wrong with nacho cheese so
we're gonna use the pork also on this
we're gonna hit it up with sour cream or
the crema
and we got some fresh guacamole next i'm
gonna go with the
pickled jalapeno this is a must if you
have fries or or nachos
pico de gallo and if people are asking
for hey i want i want a little bit more
kick in it i want to throw a little bit
more spice
then that's when the fresh jalapenos
come in also on top of the pickled
jalapenos
i feel you need that freshness there's
so much flavor coming from the seasick
itself
you need kind of things to kind of tame
it down in a good way
there you go that's a pork seasick fries
when we started the business we got a
lot of good feedback with the younger
generation
people were excited about it you know
i'm filipino yeah i know seasick so
people
were identifying the dish um but of
course they're
the elders they were very stuck on
something that was original or how
people make it and filipinos are very
kind of like you know i make this dish
better no i make it the right way
with something like with food shows a
lot to the younger generation it's okay
to speak your mind it's okay to say what
you believe it's okay to do something
that you're not told to do in a sense of
a career-wise
when it came full circle for me was when
i went to the philippines i think in
2017
and i was in makati i went to i think it
was a dive bar that served it was called
like chupacabra or something like that
and they
had seasig on the menu and then down at
the end of the menu
it said san francisco style cc and we
talked to the owner and the owner was
like yeah we got this inspiration from a
food truck in san francisco and we
didn't say anything but it was it's like
we kind of knew
[Music]
