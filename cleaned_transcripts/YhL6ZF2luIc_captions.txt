All right, so today's a new day
Been a very eventful morning for me. I got pulled over
I have no idea how I didn't get arrested this morning for driving without my license
But it is what it is.
I'm here today with my boy Steven and Jeremy's back over here, you know
There they are.
Right there, Yup..
Yeah, we're gonna work on his upper right arm today add to this sleeve that we've been working on and yeah
Hopefully we can get this finished up today.
We're gonna be here pretty late so
Yeah, we got the stencil on here
I'm gonna draw a little bit more on with a marker just to kind of plan for the future to kind of blend it in
To what he has going on in the bottom
And I kind of just wanted to fit his arm
Completely a little bit better so
I had did...
A tree piece down here
with a moon in the background
So I was gonna take the moon
And kind of...
Roll it with the moon phases...
and then use the circular motions to transition into this piece right here
