all right I am currently exploring the northern 
part of siargao Island I am here with Alex once  
again hey guys maybe remember him from 
the previous episode he saved me I saved  
him today but that's another story um we're 
trying to find some some drinks or snacks  
saw a little place there I'm 
wondering what are they selling
are they not open yet what are they selling
I want to have a look because the place looked 
interesting we just drove by here foreign
looks like like a barbecue place here  
ah but yeah he's right they're not open yet 
I think they're you're right they're not open
Halo-Halo I did actually yeah yeah but that 
would be nice like some like something for some  
ice cream it's over there like over there okay 
I follow you check that out let's check it out
yeah I don't know the name of this Village 
this is a random Village here in the yeah North  
stunned part of the island I think on the other 
side of the the tourist Village General Luna  
so we are far away from the places we are 
most tourists on this island can be found
Pizza House
let's see
foreign
for some recommendations
go ahead yes all right I learned 
that this morning actually
okay yeah you know okay
you might just heard him saying Yaga now 
if you remember from the previous episode  
he actually lives in Germany so he speaks 
German a Filipino guy who speaks German
I mean it's a beautiful day here once again and 
the northern area of the island where we are  
currently is even more beautiful than the rest of 
the island it's so green coconut trees everywhere  
and just a lot of pure nature
right here this looks like someone's 
porch ah but there's a place okay
let's park maybe not
maybe on the side
okay
so this looks like someone just opened a 
little stall at the front of their house  
am I guessing that right yeah yeah right that's 
an entrepreneurial thinking I like that because  
you know what this is like so Random because I 
would not expect that there's going to be a store  
in here because it's not along the road right 
yeah this is not a tourist Village right yeah  
I don't think no we are on the other side of the 
island where most tourists don't yeah it's very  
really quiet but if you have noticed there are 
a lot of people who are driving with um their  
surfboards so I think the Surfers really come here 
yeah we saw some huge rapes a few hundred meters  
away from here actually so I guess this part of 
the island is also very popular for for Surfers
thank you ah they have some milk tea 
here okay yeah go ahead and take it yeah
oh you're Italian
how big it is because last time I had one 
it was huge actually oh really I don't know
and I serve it in a plastic cup here no 
oh okay that sounds like a good size 10.  
okay and maybe something to drink 
do you have um calamansi juice
I found that a few days ago 
when they're on the roadside
let's have a little look here yeah I absolutely 
like the village Vibes here driving around here  
for already I don't know two hours or so yeah 
almost two hours just enjoying experiencing the  
the village life here seeing what people are up 
to on their everyday normal life here that's how  
I like to travel rather than joining tourist tours 
around the island you know just exploding on your  
own on the motorbike through the local sites okay 
like the reason they have their store here because  
there's a [ __ ] fight Arena oh in there so 
it makes sense that they have a store here
father can we have a look at the arena yeah 
yeah I would just like to to be curious to  
just see the arena no you haven't seen a car 
first no no no I saw many uh cockfighting  
chicken farms like these Farms where every 
chicken has their own house yeah but I  
haven't seen an actual I'm not really sure 
if I want to see it though oh yeah but uh  
yeah that is it's so difficult here in the 
Philippines like I'm not I'm not judging yeah  
I would be curious to experience it because it's 
like such a big tradition here and I want to learn  
about the traditions and the cultures but I'm not 
really sure if I actually want to see it you know  
but especially like during like um weekends in 
like small villages they even like do like a  
small cup fight just because yeah you can see that 
yeah it is a very popular thing all around the  
Philippines right but I think if there's an arena 
it's professional it's uh there's a lot of money  
involved yeah also people bet on the chicken 
yes it's isn't gambling illegal here actually  
so it's like not 100 okay okay then uh maybe 
let's have a refreshment here and then we have  
a look at it I will be very curious to there's no 
fighting today but just to see the arena okay okay
so what is this is not the hello hello right now
so this is
milk tea right yeah yeah okay are they the name is
twins in besides so the owners are trained no
okay okay
so you just said something special about the 
Halo Halo here you can think normally they  
mix it with ice right like shaped eyes 
yeah but this time this is like candid  
ice the what is candid well they made sure 
they mix it with them so this is ice yeah  
ice candy ice candy it's candy yeah so 
it already has flavor in itself oh yeah
looks like a hobby like vanilla flavor no is it
oh yeah
so she's Crossing it now yeah
would you say hello hello is the 
number one dessert in the Philippines  
hmm I would say mango float right mango float 
yeah no I haven't but it was offered to me once  
but I uh I don't remember why I decided 
situation but uh next time mango float s
yeah it's a bit more expensive
yeah so maybe if there's like a house 
that would invite us with mango photos
but it's chilled it's not really big
like crushed biscuits right yeah yeah okay okay  
it's a layer of graham crackers meal and 
mango okay sounds good and they chill it  
yeah after you chill that it's like uh 
ice cream ah okay okay consistency okay  
I'm going to make it my mission to try it 
in one of the next videos yeah mango float
so this is not the Halo Halo right 
this is that's it that's our hello  
hello ah okay I thought that's uh that's her order
so Halo Halo is like like a ball of 
uh lots of delicious things yes you  
mix banana there's corn inside 
these pearls the crushed ice my  
sister makes outfits to mix mix and mix 
it mix with the end of the end mix yeah
you can also say Mission yeah so Halo Halo 
means mix yeah I learned that before mix mix  
look away no tinkle we're still young
she said my cheeks
but this is actually like 
a modern take on Halo Halo  
um the fruits are not really the fresh 
ones oh she's putting like dry fruits
materials okay
so every place makes the halo Halo a 
little bit different yeah with their  
own touch okay and this is their 
own version but it makes it more  
interesting for me to try it more often 
oh I love this one have you tried Uber  
before no oh my goodness one of the best 
flavors here yeah can we add one ubiscope
a special a special like uber
wait man whatever I would like to try 
would be maybe I can get a scooter who babe
I also have to try that another 
time maybe you should try the Ube  
ice cream it's really good it's 
like nutty and vanilla flavor
okay so we have this um it looks almost 
like a smoothie now because the cup is  
like a smoothie Let Me Maybe showed 
in better light condition out here  
where's the light coming from from there 
so uh yeah looking forward to try it now
thank you
so we have to eat it like 
like a like a smoothie Bowl
okay
do you mix everything yeah right yeah a dish 
that is called mix mix I would assume you mix it
oh this is just the the crushed ice now 
because it has already flavor in it yeah
oh yeah guys
hello
um
so let me properly mix it yeah how to 
get everything from the from the bottom  
I think they're the most 
Treasures are at the bottom now  
so maybe I have a spoon now full which 
lots of delicious mix there you go
um
especially on the hot day here
oh thank you so who are the customers 
here usually just the people who go  
to the to the chicken fights or 
did they locate from the village
like Burger and Fries here which 
sounds like a menu for Western tourists  
but I'm wondering do you have 
Western tourists coming here
yeah like the foreigners that have been living 
here in Chicago ah okay okay you get married  
also you can so some some foreigners live here 
they are married with with local Wife oh okay  
okay that's actually you see that uh sometimes in 
the Philippines like a mixed couple with Western  
guys and local women so the closer I get to the 
bottom the better it gets actually because I find  
more and more Treasures in here so many different 
ingredients here and they're all tasting uh so  
fresh like it's not like freshers maybe one word 
not like fresh fruits but refreshing you know
the mango in that actually fresh so 
we have some mango pieces in there  
and then together with a crunchy apart 
from the cornflakes this is very good
okay that was very good I think I 
don't need the fruit here anymore  
yeah because this was already uh 
at the end it was like a drink
how much is it
very cheap yeah only one Euro yeah that's in 
your like one Euro 40 150 yeah you don't get  
a good dessert for that price in Germany 
no no definitely I mean you can tell you  
you can get something from the grocery for 
like two Euros yeah right but like a fresh  
something a big cup like this and Germany would be 
at least like seven double or three times surprise  
something comparable yeah so okay we 
can have a look at the arena now yeah  
okay the wind is blowing away the 
money here let me put it like this okay
all right is it far from here I like to 
see sometimes throws in some German words
what is your favorite German word
nine nine
in case you don't know what is nine it 
means I know oh my God oh my God oh my God
okay I am oh no that's my 
hotel Key I have my motorbike  
oh here it is okay I had to change my motorbike 
by the way a few days ago actually after we did  
our Island trip in the previous video when I 
came back to the pier our motorbike was not  
working anymore oh really so we had to switch to 
a new bike because it just didn't start anymore
this one is starting okay we're gonna wear 
this look but just gonna follow the road here  
huh what is this Eggman eggplant yes these 
are the eggplanties I like the ones that  
we ate at their Budokai yes because like in 
Germany our eggplants are almost round right
eggplants in Germany are looking like foreign
okay let's check out the arena and 
then like the sun will set soon  
I don't really like to drive around in 
the dark and it's like an hour and a  
half back to the village where I'm staying but 
anyway let's find we have Alex find the arena
Vietnam
yes he knows now where it is
are you sure it's here your Google Maps yeah 
but well it looks pretty beautiful over there  
regardless if the arena is here or not yeah but is 
there Arena on Google Maps there must be like uh
I say a community Farm 
Felix dulpina Community Farm  
is that what we're looking for it's very 
near yeah like a few hundred maybe 100 meter
okay the road gets interesting now looks a 
little bit like we are entering the jungle
okay we're all good just needed to stabilize 
the bike a little bit with both of my hands  
or check out the view here guys
oh it is so amazing that  
I'm stumbling across beautiful places like 
this randomly so many times around this island
here let's uh continue a little bit but we don't 
find the chicken farm it looks beautiful here
it's not the best road to drive for the bikes  
oh okay I see chickens at least 
here that's uh that's the first time
you think that's here oh yeah I think it is
ah yep that's it and you think 
we can have a look now yeah  
so it's uh these places are only 
open on the weekends right yeah  
okay so yeah because I'm still not sure if I 
actually want to see a chicken fight I would  
like to see everything that goes on around it 
like because I know that many people gather  
together and maybe there's drinking involved so 
it's like a big Community event I would really  
like to see that but I'm not sure if I would 
actually like to see the actual fighting you know
it's a house
but there's nobody here why do we have 
any chickens here but they are not uh  
pork fighting chickens because I know 
that they wouldn't live together like this
looks beautiful here man oh
you wanna have a look on my Google Maps again
does it say you know you think this is a 
place I have no signal so I can't load it here
I think um
it sounded like you were arguing with him 
really like both of you were speaking like  
loud and it sounded like oh are you arguing 
normally people think that when I'm speaking  
German with someone like because German 
sounds very aggressive usually but I  
was wondering now because both of you 
sounded like very energetic and yeah
about finding the chicken place 
okay see you at the chicken place  
okay looks like we found the right Road 
Alex said this time he's very sure it's here
oh the roads here definitely uh interesting
okay so it's a beautiful little uh Valley here
okay okay okay ah this looks like Arena
oh yeah I think this looks like Arena yeah okay
and let's see if we can 
actually have a have a look
is there someone here it would be 
nice if somebody can maybe show me  
something or show us something no I think 
there's a it's a house it's a house okay
but uh maybe the uh the owner oh hello
four o'clock stack combo Derby 
November 30 maybe that's the next one  
guaranteed price 300 000. minimum batch 5500.
so it's closed maybe we can talk 
I will be really curious to see it
salamat have you been to such a fight 
before no no because like we usually  
have it in our like small villages not in 
this kind of a professional setting are you  
so yeah it's a little bit like a 
like a stadium with seating areas
as you can see there's a square over there 
yeah like a like a field field in the middle
yeah well the owner's not here nobody here
well I guess I have to see an arena 
from the inside another day then yeah  
but maybe in other recipes we're gonna be here 
for two more months right yeah I'm gonna stay in  
the Philippines for a while so it happens every 
weekend so I guess I have some opportunities
I'm most not really sure if I could film this for 
YouTube if YouTube would like if I post a video  
from an event like this but yeah like like I said 
earlier I would be more curious to see everything  
that goes on around like the community aspect 
of it rather than seeing the actual fights so  
I think I would yeah film everything around but 
probably not filming the actual fights you know
maybe we can have a sneak view inside here I can 
put the camera through maybe you can see something
not really visible from here right
the sign says 300 000 pesos that sounds like a 
huge price it's around six thousand dollars yeah  
that's just very well yeah so minimum bet is 
5500 so around 100 euros yeah so but you don't  
have to bet that if you just want to watch it 
it's just if you want to place a or you want  
to let your chicken fight yeah then you have to 
pay five thousand dollars like people I mean if  
you're going to watch it you can also bet yeah but 
I mean you don't have to pay 5000 just to watch it  
right that an answer you're not 
sure okay okay maybe someone in  
the comment section can explain about 
this but I don't think you have to pay 5  
000 which is like 100 euro 100 just to 
watch it that sounds like too too crazy  
accepted rate stack 1.8 kilo to 2.2 clock 1.8 
to 2.2 so they have different weight classes  
sounds like like unboxing mm-hmm battery penalty 
all the way in the penalties oh okay okay
that's funny that uh cultures around the world 
are so different something like that would never  
happen in Germany would totally be not allowed in 
Germany but uh people around about our countries  
around the world cultures around the world are 
different and that's what I like to learn about  
the differences about the cultures all around 
the world and I'm not here to judge I'm here to  
learn an experience foreign guys check out this 
wave Viewpoint here we have huge waves here that  
looks really really nice and the whole Coast here 
looks just incredible so picturesque and actually  
I learned surfing I actually spent a few days here 
like almost a week here without filming so taking  
some time off as well and I learned surfing I had 
some surfing lessons and it was the first time in  
my life standing on a surfboard so that was quite 
a lot of fun and yeah this island is very popular  
and famous for the surfing spots surfing season 
all around all around the year here but yeah  
we are going to head back to our main village 
yeah tourist Village on the other side of the  
island and if you haven't seen the previous video 
where we did island hopping together and check it  
out right here stay healthy stay positive 
and then see on the next episode ciao guys
