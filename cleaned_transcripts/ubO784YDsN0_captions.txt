so we got to talk about something so you
probably saw in the title or on the
thumbnail what this is all about this
happened I don't even know what to say
honestly me and Brianna were like how do
we even start this like start talking about it
I can't even speak right now, like, what am I supposed to do!
I'm gonna let
Brianna tell most of this story because
this is pretty much mostly her story but
I can pretty much started off by like
talking about how things led up to
Brianna even being on Twitter at 4:00 in
the morning in the first place I was on
Twitter of course like usual technically
I was supposed to be editing last night
and I actually didn't get to edit a
thing to start off of course we
definitely have to say a huge huge
congratulations to SB19 for making it
onto billboard so proud of them that is
HUGE that's huge that's amazing and like
they're by a bunch of our like groups
that we stan in kpop too there's (G) I-dle,
there's Victon there's A.C.E like yeah and
then SB19 being their god that's like
that's huge for them and for us like
A'TINs everywhere International or
Filipino it's just that's a huge thing
we're so proud of them congratulations
guys I don't know if you're watching
this and I mean I kind of doubt it but
congratulations I was posting about it
on Twitter like all night last night and
that's why I was not really editing I
had my laptop out in front of me the
entire time and I was like I'm gonna get
to it I'm gonna get to it and I just
kept going to my phone
it never happened in the process of
being on then I get a notification
because I have the bell clicked for SB19 I saw that it said SB19 posted
something and I was like "Ooo! what else did they post?" like what else has happened so
I clicked on it like really fast and
then I see it's Justin's picture and I
was like oh my god I was like Brianna's
gonna freak out when she sees this
picture he looks so cute and so it was
in Tagalog so I was like I don't
know what it says but I pressed the
translation button and it was pretty
accurate so I saw he said "let's talk" and
I was *gasp* this is it like this is it he's about to
start talking to people like the way ken
did it and then the way Josh had done it
it was Justin's turn so I was like oh my
god this is it this is it last night we
were actually supposed to do like quite
a bit of reactions too Brianna was
exhausted and she was willing to but I
just felt really bad so I was like you
know I was like go ahead and go to sleep
early tonight and we'll just do some
extras tomorrow and then the next day so
I knew she had like been asleep for a
good while I'm gonna let her take over
from here I was really tired last night
I was like over here playing like the
guitar you know just like practicing and
then I was like
I should probably take a nap like now so
I did it was like 7:45 and I just stayed
asleep it's pretty bad I was--I was pretty tired
I knew she was asleep because I had texted her about the Billboard thing and she
never responded and I knew she would
have so I was like she probably went to
sleep and like stayed asleep I woke up
in the middle of the night and I
couldn't go back to sleep
Brianna basically told me that she had
woken up what would you say like 3:00
4:00 in the morning and she did sound
asleep when I called her so I'm gonna
guess that maybe she was like in and out
of sleep because she was like still
trying to fall back asleep since it was
so early in the morning I called her
twice so the first time she didn't
answer so I'm gonna guess she had kind
of like dozed off and so like I called
her the first time she didn't answer and
I was like God surely she's not still
sleeping that hard I called her again
and then she answered she sounded like
half asleep and I was like oh my god you
have to wake up and she was like why
She was like it's so early and I was like
Brianna you need to go look at Twitter I
was like you remember how Josh and Ken
had talked to people on Twitter I was
like it's Justin's turn right now like
he's responding to people right now and
she was like what really she sounded
like all of a sudden super awake and so
I think she was so half asleep because
technically we could have probably still
stayed on the phone for a little bit but
she was like okay I'm gonna I'm gonna
get on Twitter I'll text you and so I
was like okay people thought it was
Brianna but it was actually me but that
was the only one that I was gonna be
posting up all the other tweets after
that-- all her. Technically I posted up the
first tweet although she was asking me
what to say so I was like kind of trying
to like help her out but I was
struggling too. I'll let you take that over
The first Tweet that I had posted was this one right here the one
the pun. It said Justin are you a bank
loan because you have my interest.
and I -- for some reason -- I was feeling so brave to put a winky face and normally when I do
that type of stuff I put a laughing face so I make it as a joke but for some reason
I didn't put a laughing face
You were half asleep
yeah and so I sent it and then I
realized I didn't put a laughing face
and so I go and text Meagan and I say
I didn't put a laughing face after the winky  face! I was stressed out!
you can tell there was like
instant regret there like I personally
feel like you were like you regret that
you even posted it in the first place
but then there was like the winky face and
then the lack of laughing face and oh my
I was dying laughing when she told me
that so we we got to tell the story
behind that pun there's actually a story
behind that pun I don't know how many of
you follow us on Instagram I also posted
them on Twitter too but on Instagram on
our story like what a week ago yeah we
posted up a pun that was tagged to every
single guy on Instagram like all of the
guys all of them all five of them
there was a story behind that
and we probably were never planning on
telling the story it's not bad we just
it was just I don't know kind of random
we made a bet for something that day
I was like okay here's what happens
whoever loses has to send a cheesy
pick-up line to somebody from SB19 I
told her if you lose I'm picking who
you're sending it to and if I lose you
pick who I send it to so naturally of
course I picked Justin cuz I've got it
like embarrass her you know and she of
course picked Ken even though I'm OT5
Because she's Ken biased
Because I'm OT5!
And so that was the plan
she lost the bet and so originally those
puns I'm putting them down here all of those were actually
supposed to be that one pun that she
sent to Justin yesterday that was the
pun that we chose because we heard it
like a little before that and we thought
it was like so cringy but funny at the
same time we've been holding on to that
pun for a long time and so she was
supposed to post it that night but she
had mentioned how it would be really
funny if one day we sent a pun to each
guy or if we sent like a cheesy pick-up
line to each guy and so I was like
actually why don't we just do that now
so I was like fine I was like let's
forget the bet let's just do it
so that was the plan was to send a
a cheesy pick-up line to each of the guys
and so we sent all of the ones that you
saw down there but we still have the
interest one and Brianna like to
yesterday had been regretting that she
didn't send it to Justin because when we
were figuring out ones for the other
guys she was like I feel like Justin's
doesn't quite match we were saying how
they're all kind of cute in a sense
the bank loan one just didn't really it felt
like misplaced yeah so we changed it to
the socks one because out of all of them
I think that's the one that we were like
oh my gosh that's so cute!
that's the one we ended up sending to
Justin and then like I'm gonna say like
almost every day or every other day
Brianna was like I wish I would have
sent the bank loan one
I just felt like that one was so good and then I was like
I'm probably not gonna send that to him at all. Like ever
all ever ever so I kind of regretted not
putting it so yesterday was her chance
and I don't think she has thought of it
she was like what should I say I don't
know what to say like I'm not I'm not
awake right now and so I was like oh do
the bank loan and she was like what I
was like yes you've been regretting it I
was like you're gonna you know you're
gonna regret it if you don't say it just
send it so she was like ah fine she's
like I can always delete it I guess so
then she ended up like posting it and
then when she was like
"I forgot the laughing face!" oh I was dead I was dying of laughter
I was scared I was like that's
probably gonna be too much like... I was just so. I dunno
She was like he's never gonna respond
She was like I'm just gonna send a lot more so that maybe he won't see that one
so after like the bank loan tweet I ended up sending more tweets
So if like there was a chance he could notice me or something
He never like responded to any of my tweets BUT THEN LATER
an hour later he responded to the bank loan one
Out of all of them
Out of all of those, THE BANK LOAN ONE
The one I was most embarrassed about
But he did the same exact thing almost!
So he said like the pun
I was rolling laughing OMG
like I fell to the ground and then I
stand up and I'm like jumping up like
laughing so hard oh it was I was a mess
at first I texted Brianna and I was
like "BRIANNA!!"  like all in caps I was
freaking out and she didn't respond like
for the longest time she didn't respond
and like at first I was like oh my god
she's freaking out right now but then
after a while I was like I'm kinda thinking
she could have actually passed out
because it took her so long to respond
So whenever Justin had actually responded to me I wasn't on Twitter because I was at this point getting
ready for school
'cause I didn't want to be on Twitter for
like two hours just, you know, on Twitter not getting ready for school
And so I was washing my face
at that time and you know this is
whenever
I have soap all over my face I don't
have my glasses on so that's one thing
and I get a lot of notifications on my
phone and I'm like what's happening so
while I got the text message from Meagan
I have this soap bottle in my hand and I
just drop it because
she's freaking out and then I'm like oh
no something happens so I'm freaking out
and then it falls in the sink and then I
just see it start like the soap coming
out and I'm like no this is expensive
so I'm over here trying unlock my phone
and then get this soap bottle at the same
time and it was a mess this morning
literally it was oh my god
I look to see what she was like freaking out about
And I was like I should probably go look on
Twitter so I did so whenever I saw that
he responded to me I couldn't exactly
like scream out loud because my parents
are still asleep and I'm over you're
getting ready and so I kind of I do like
a quiet scream like "ahhh"  it was so weird and I'm just kind of like freaking out in the bathroom trying to
be quiet as quiet as possible and first
before I figured out anything I put my
phone down washed my face first so I can get this soap off my face and then I go back
to my phone and I like read his tweet
several times and I'm like I don't get
Because I was thinking more like my kind of pun
like how it had one subject and
then another subject and then I realized
the capital letters it spelled
INTEREST and I was like "OHHH"
And so when I read it again and I understood it
I was like that's so cute cheesy!
I love it!
And so then I freaked out even more because
I'm like this this pun is so adorable and Justin sent it to me so you know I'm freaking
out over two things one him responding to me
and then the pun that he made
So yeah...
That was brilliant. That was literally like
the best response you could have ever received. Out of everything she sent
I'm so glad he responded to that one and I'm glad he responded the way he did because
that was priceless like I instantly got
it granted I'm not half asleep like her
like and I don't have soap all over my
face and no way to see so yeah like I
can get how it kind of threw her off but
for me I instantly got it and I was like
freaking out I'm freaking out the fact
that he just responded to her but I'm
also freaking out the fact that he
responded with a pun and the way the pun
was and just like there was a winky face and OMG
I forgot to mention that! He sent a winky face with that also so it was a good thing you didn't send a winky face
with the laughing face like it was
perfect
like it was destiny the whole thing
was just destiny it really was cuz she
would not have been up at that time had
she not gone to sleep as early as she
did she wouldn't have had that pun how
do we not like a week ago planned out
this pun before and just the way it all
fell through together
Yeah it just all went together
Yeah it was crazy the accidental not putting the laughing face
and putting only the winky face and him
replying with a winky face
It was just so many little details coming
together to make this one big like oh my
gosh
and so after that I was like now I don't feel bad about the laughing face
My whole day was just amazing because of that one response
so yeah that was basically the story
pretty great story I think it's a pretty great
story I mean y'all probably didn't
expect there to be such a story behind
it well thank you Justin you made the
