the all-in-one platform dedicated to helping

morning from vinodo also known as Chinatown yeah  
Chinatown Manila yeah we are going to kick 
off a food tour kind of a walking food tour  
for the most part uh hitting some of the coolest 
eateries here in Chinatown we're starting a course  
with dumplings at dong Bay uh Dumpling House 
pork dumplings you guys thinking about some of  
that yes pork dumplings now I think they have 
some I do believe they have the veg so I think  
they have like a I think they have a green onion 
um dumpling so we'll go check that out yeah the  
idea here is that we are going to get kind of one 
plate and pretty much share because we're gonna  
hit as many different eateries as we can and Dong 
Bay gotta kind of watch these tight streets here  
dog race just right here you walk 
up you order right at the counter  
and uh eat it on the streets so looking pretty 
good all right guys what do you think here we  
go this is what we're after the uh kuche 
with pork Gucci with pork it looks like 14  
pieces for 200. plain pork boiled they also have 
fried they have a stuffed pancake so yeah a lot  
a lot of options here let's uh get with the 
lady Kelly can I pass for us off to you yeah
all right so guys yeah I'm definitely thinking 
boiled boiled dumplings okay sound good all right  
they have plain pork no let's get the the 
couche with pork all right how are you uh

alrighty thank you oh six six okay so Kelly uh  
well good news for us bad news for 
you no bad she said no vegetarian okay  
um but we did get the kuche with pork uh number 
six we're gonna eat it just essentially there's no  
tables it's all just sort of the sidewalk eating 
in front of the window so I can see the lady she's  
like chopping all the dumplings back there I 
assume they boil them in the back and uh should  
be uh pretty good the green onions would dump with 
with pork so just within a minute our order is up  
Hello thank you okay this is uh this is vinegar 
yes okay vinegar and garlic soy sauce vinegar  
garlic blend wow those look really nice I think 
I'm gonna pre pre-add okay I gotta be careful
okay don't add too much there we go okay cool so 
we got the garlic soy sauce vinegar blend here's  
a little chili I'll add the chili on this side 
chili oil we'll just add it here that way uh  
people can use it as they wish okay so we have 
Chopsticks let's grab a couple of toothpicks  
see today we take two of those or one of 
them granite all right in the extras I'll  
just put uh right here okay so guys let's 
just have a seat on the uh on the side here  
we can come back for more vinegar as we 
need for us you happy with your banana  
all right so granted you go ahead and pop a squat 
there we have uh sufficiently waited a couple of  
minutes for the heat to escape the box but you 
can see um cooled down it's got that dumpling
done that jumping uh wrap with 
the pork on the inside whoa
it's still hot and the green onions it's a 
little hot but it's really good I can really  
taste the green onions yeah yeah it's nice 
yeah I can really taste the green onions it's  
good it tastes fresh like I mean she was just 
back there making them cutting the dumplings  
so these are good the vinegar that it's soaking in  
that's awesome this one I'm gonna go 
for some of the chili the chili oil
there we go
we get two boxes vinegar and chili yeah so the 
finger was soy sauce vinegar garlic in one bottle  
and then the chili sauce kind of on the side how's 
the chili sauce excellent It's not spicy actually  
I could probably pour some over here if you guys 
think you all want it oh I can see the inside of  
Cedar's dumpling there yeah pork and the onion 
it's so good yeah do you want more of the vinegar
yeah more vinegar okay I'm gonna 
take this one more piece here you  
can see it's just kind of the angle 
you're holding again is good because  
it suits all the vinegar in the corner 
it's kind of just dripping with flavor
that's great what do you guys 
like about them they're sweet
they're sweet um they aren't that hot and the 
texture is just amazing yeah it's the chewiness  
of the pork and the the wrapper for The Dumpling 
is awesome yeah good description and they're juicy  
wow sports do you want to try dumpling it's like a 
noodle it's a big noodle with yummy on the inside  
what sweet it granny said or sweet is that like 
the meat is sweet or is it the biggest vinegar
it's
wow that's excellent nice can you eat 14 of them 
uh I feel like I could eat 14 alone what about  
you guys we were kind of worried when we saw 
there's 14 per order like oh man we don't want  
to get too full now I'm glad it was 14 in the 
order completely destroyed those in about two  
minutes flat that was excellent what'd you guys 
think it was so delicious that man this is add  
this to your your food tour list you can also 
get these fried but I'm glad we went boiled if  
it's one to 100 I would give it uh 100. nice tops 
top scores boom what a way to start a food tour
like the chili oil to be a little bit more spicy 
this is true that could be a critique the chili  
oil wasn't blazing but you know pretty good 
place I love that vinegar all right everyone  
heading down the road our next stop as we work 
down these narrow streets here in Chinatown Cafe  
mezzanine now there's a couple of things here they 
have I believe a vegetarian fried rice kyongpong  
rice I think is veg rice but there's also um 
super number five now Granite soup number five  
yeah this I believe has you know some private 
mail like uh male parts in it testicles penis  
are you interested giving it a try yeah why 
not man why not so there is a huge queue  
um here's the restaurant pretty busy and a pretty 
big queue let's see about uh where we actually go  
to get into the queue for this place I mean 
Chinatown all the lanterns all the dragons  
okay I'm guessing the q's back here wow all right

Philippines so we got seated it did not take long 
at all because we were actually needing to come  
upstairs to Cafe mezzanine so that line was on the 
restaurant downstairs the menus are very similar  
but okay I think we're ready to order uh do you 
have um suit number five oh no Granite number five
I think I'm disappointed but maybe I'm not okay 
so no problem uh okay well let me just give it  
a second on the menu food has been surf the 
full menu so the seafood Lomi guys how is it  
sweet and the noodles are like thick and chewy do 
you like those noodles they look really long yeah
yeah okay so you're getting yourself 
um it's really good you can definitely  
get the seafood flavor right on 
Cedar what do you think soy sauce
texture that's spicy oh nice you're getting 
so spicy out of that yeah if you get them all  
together it just tastes like beautiful nice 
one big bite of noodle fish broth awesome all  
right I'm gonna go for it myself oh they're 
shrimp in there nice all right you can see  
chunks of fish maybe egg as 
well but it's a rich looking bra
it's good
flavor it's fresh it's delicious I can say shrimp  
in there yeah that's really good I 
think I even see Fish balls as well
foreign guys those are the fish balls 
if you have any of those in your cup  
yeah Kelly you got you've turned up playing 
kanji into something quite fancy over there  
I really I don't know if I changed the way 
it's supposed to be but I've added white  
pepper soy sauce this super oh hot sauce 
I don't know if it's hot and I should have  
tried it it's hot sauce but it's hot I put 
it in there you wanna see that pepper yeah  
I've always had a big glass of a warm milk so 
that's pretty good um peanuts in them in the
rice here which I believe is 
veg but now I thought it was  
veg but upon further expression there 
might be little meat trucks in there
good I haven't tried hot sauce all right go for it  
the kanji looks thick it looks 
nice yeah it's a good content
well it's quite a spread of food now Forest had 
a big glass of warm milk how you doing bars you  
want some of the rice you want a salsa mom sauce 
yeah Brandon how's that fish bowl it's really  
good yeah the fish balls are nice and Cedar you 
got a big chunk of fish there is that so yummy  
oh all right well this against the spread I 
mean for me the seafood balmy is fantastic  
Kelly turned a plane kanji into something 
quite delicious and then the rice we got  
to go for the rice now this one I thought 
was like a vegetarian fried rice but I I  
think there are chunks of pork in there yeah 
there definitely are chunks of meat in there
it's a real Smoky flavor um you know there's 
definitely a soy sauce on it it looks like good  
rice it's really good rice like a brown rice I 
think it's kind of that grainy flavor I'm getting
Smokey grainy peanut scared a nice crunch texture 
all right so we'll spend a little time finishing  
this up and we'll head on down the road after 
kind of nice full tummies from dumplings and  
seafood loamy it's time for something sweet 
are you guys ready for something sweet okay  
there's a bakery just down the street hey by 
the way Forest how are those fish balls good  
good yeah that kid man he uh he loves the seafood 
loamy who knew so fish balls and noodles right up  
this guy's alley but either way right just I 
mean we're already here I mean a one minute  
walk down the road from the restaurant and here 
we are at the Holland Bakery and uh here we are  
we'll go right in and get this figured out 
all right so as we're reviewing kind of the  
different flavors of the hopias I don't see 
mango so maybe I misunderstood because I see  
mango this mung bean paste uh mango so maybe 
there is not actually a fruit one uh let's see  
although I am seeing pineapple here so there 
are some sweets ooh purple yam uh wax gourd
missing this one there's something 
light though yeah no sugar added yeah  
oh yeah here's this one has pork okay 
here's a custard one salted egg custard  
keep your refrigerator purple yam custard 
here's your Jackfruit Jackfruit would be  
kind of guy well listen let's uh it's it seems 
to me one two three four about five per package  
at least as my thumb feels it should we just get 
one or do you want to get one for a little later  
or we can get a couple we can do a little taste 
test right outside uh maybe two two okay sounds  
good so we got the original this mung bean paste 
I would do the purple yam purple yam it's called
sounds good to me hello how are you hi sir 
thank you so much hey total price 172 pesos  
and uh we're just gonna eat them right outside 
because there's no uh like Cafe chairs or tables  
in here it's pretty much a uh grab-and-go type 
system all right guys let's find a little space
so we've got uh what is it 
five cakes in the Box yes  
and we'll try this one you guys 
want to just share it okay all right
it's custardy it's soft chewy
yeah it's kind of like a um what's that what's 
a jelly thing that you like to eat oh Emoji  
it's like Emoji but it's more flour oh it's like a 
potato Kinda Yeah Yeah mung bean paste it's floury  
it's flaky it's kind of delicious let me see if 
orange will go for it yeah it's a little dry first  
you want a Bible a little cake it's like bananas 
oh you like it a thumbs up you want more of it no  
no okay so there you go that one's a winner that's 
the original this is kind of the one everybody  
seeks out you want the rest of this one right 
here you want to finish it and we have another  
flavor as well so we got the two flavors that 
was mung bean and this one is a sweet potato okay  
it's called the Hopi up I think Ube I'm not sure 
I'm probably butchering that but purple yam paste  
purple yam paste very nice sounds good right oh I 
can see the purple already oh yeah right in here  
maybe we can break that into a few 
pieces all right let's see how we can  
do this butcher did I think well it's 
definitely purple this one's softer
okay here is purple here purple yam 
paste I'm sorry oh that one's really good  
it's softer it feels softer and 
it's definitely sweeter so there  
must be certainly some sugar in that paste 
yeah it's good sweet yam yeah you like a  
cedar these are good these are tastes 
good with a coffee I need a coffee yes  
nice black coffee oh I hear you perfect 
Forest you want to try this one it's purple
that one no no that was not for him which ones 
did you guys like better the purple the yam or  
the original the mung beam do you like the mung 
bean the yellow which no you like the original  
one better oh I like the purple yam purple 
yam boy I like both I've had to really pick  
I'm gonna go mung bean the yellow the original I 
mean although well that's a tough choice so again  
you get these right here I mean this is a bakery 
right down the street is a vegetable fruit market  
and you eat them on the street I mean I 
suppose like normal people would take them home  
yeah but we'll go with on the street our next 
stop is right down a back Alleyway total Market  
Alleyway fruits vegetables Meats but we're here 
at this little unassuming window stall the new  
Pho Hing Lupa house this is it Olympia my house 
fast so we try 95. so again under a hundred pesos  
I'll go ahead I'll go ahead and pay this bill 
this Kelly is all Veg it's like carrot cabbage  
um herbs all chopped up I know you guys can't 
smell this but it smells fantastic just from  
everyone around us eating it it smells like the 
inside of like uh egg roll like cabbage carrot  
smell well we came here I said it smells spicy 
yeah spicy so it looks like a burrito yes that  
looks like spicy sauce the trick on this if you 
want to add the soy I learned this actually on  
YouTube is you bite the little tip off and then 
you can squeeze down it okay here we go all right  
so oh it's oh dewy yeah I thought it was a soy 
sauce I thought it was soy sauce but it's a lot  
thicker not quite ketchup my knees but but maybe 
it tasted yeah it sounds like a vegetable burrito  
looks messy I can't tell what it's made out of 
maybe I mean all types of edge maybe some lettuce
vegetables sugary ketchup cabbage maybe egg 
not sure that looks like I'm not sure what  
this one is cabbage maybe maybe cabbage yeah you 
guys gotta try this thank you okay there we go
that tastes looks so good 
yeah what do you like about it
I bet peanuts
peanuts a try so again you can see 
a huge variety of ingredients Forest  
Forest that has a peanut buttery taste to it yes
yeah yeah well it's sugar there's definitely 
sugar in this like it's a sugar peanut base  
Yep this is all bad this is not me it's delicious 
yeah what you're seeing in that dark that's the  
peanut sugar blend uh cabbage carrot all types 
of good stuff Granite you want to try this one
that one tastes like peanut butter 
yeah there's like full flavor and  
really sweet okay yeah sweet delicious yummy 
you think for us to go for a bite I can ask  
him Forest crunchy do you want a little 
bite of the burrito no spicy it's sweet
but
okay well that one little granule of flavor he 
uh you know not gonna not gonna go for anymore  
but this is good yeah yeah so we'll spend a minute 
kind of knocking this out but you can see there's  
so many good options here in Chinatown I mean 
wow yeah all right I can't wait to see what's  
next so as we work our way down the drag we 
step off about five steps here is Yin Ying  
you guys ready for Yin some Yin Ying yeah I 
think so me too what that is kanji it's the  
dish we're after so Kelly I might not show the 
well I bet we can find one additional but I did  
it plenty already well and you showed a veg 
kanji uh it looks pretty good this one though  
it's all about the beef Congee so uh there's 
multiple levels to this restaurant so although  
the downstairs is busy yeah we will go up and 
find a table sound good all right which table  
upstairs yeah oh better okay all right so again 
multiple layers oh wow look at all those buns  
yum okay so lots of good stuff but you know you 
come to a place like this with one dish in mind  
like the beef cranji but then you start looking 
around you're like oh that looks good that looks  
good that looks good so it's hard not to uh overdo 
it in a restaurant like this to uh just completely  
like uh order so many different items but for 
sure beef kanji all right we'll work our way  
up oh yeah there's lots of levels so Cedar look 
to your right see if there's a table in there
so if you're ever curious like what do we do 
after we order but before the food arrives  
a lot of thumb wrestling thumb wrestling and cars  
that's that's a little behind the scenes info 
for you the beef kanji's here nice these are  
shrimp I believe three Waters yes thank you sir 
now taking a look at this kanji raw egg yolk on  
top that is awesome I wasn't expecting that 
that's like that beef awesome thank you sir
okay so I figure what we'll do is uh we can  
um we can serve into these little 
bowls from the Big Bowl all right
sir okay so I'm gonna get a little bit of the  
raw egg yolk for everybody and and the 
hot kanji itself will kind of cook it
Cedar I'm going to show you next okay
and it's kind of minced beef is what it is
okay there you go and now in this bowl will 
be mine you can see that yellow bright raw  
egg yolk in there crispy crackers I'm gonna jaw 
mine up a little bit certainly with the vinegar
thank you Forrest the vinegar and I'll take some 
of the soy all right some of the soy sauce coming  
on top okay and then of course we've got 
the uh chili that bright dark chili sauce
I'm definitely gonna give it 
a stir so that raw egg yolk is  
um kind of within the hot kanji 
but it looks multi-colored
oh man that's good okay lots of different textures 
and flavors the kanji is chewy the beef is uh very  
flavorful I can taste the vinegar I can taste 
the chili sauce it's all very very good they  
also brought out the uh the dim sum the shrimp I 
have an idea here on this one so I'm gonna kind  
of get it out of the bowl put it onto the spoon 
and then I'm going to kind of spice up the uh  
spice it up off the spoon I think 
I think it'll work so vinegar
and then I'll get a little soy sauce action on 
this one how's the hot sauce the hot chili is  
really good okay so the Taiko is here I see how 
I taste um Rina it's definitely the way to do it
that's the soy here is some vinegar it's kind of 
a big bite you could probably do two bites but  
if you got a big mouth like me you can 
kind of it's good right I'm getting the  
shrimp and that vinegar you can really taste 
the vinegar in the soy off of something like  
that uh in the kanji it just kind of Blends 
together but you can really put some soy sauce
perfect yeah perfect exactly right quite delicious
it's a really good uh Kelly I Wish uh you're 
you're getting on the full side though from  
the last stop Yes okay so you're not you're not 
feeling neglected I mean a little I'm not feeling  
great okay good all right Forest is distracted 
watching some of our YouTube videos good for  
you young man all right everyone well we will 
spend the time enjoying what might be one of  
my favorite meals for the day is kanji Granite 
how you doing try a little bit about that okay  
yeah I love it man go for it that cherry 
sauce is where it's at it's not so smart  
I mean it's got a heat but it's very different 
than say like the India Pakistan Nepali spices
all right well quite delicious again you've  
got a very yolky batch there 
quite quite quite creamy yeah
yeah that hot sauce makes it 100 times yeah 
I did it I did the exact same thing all right  
so we'll spend the next little bit of time 
sort of polishing off you notice the uh the  
haiko uh dimsum artigan I will finish off 
that kanji and we'll be on our way so our  
next destination Fried Chicken but just 
take a look at the hustle and bustle uh
Chinatown I mean wow all these huge buses 
these are basically like super discount  
local taxis you flag these guys down these big 
trucks and it can hop right in so we are yeah  
we're looking for a famous fried chicken place 
that's been interested in 1920s let's see if  
we can uh see if we can find it I believe we're 
getting pretty close but you got the big church  
across the way there all right granted 
you got room for some fried chicken yeah  
yeah I think so Fried Chicken there's always 
food for fried chicken yeah Cantonese style  
but wow oh I see it okay remind me 
I believe it's the name Ramon Lee
everyone's so friendly so 
our chicken place since 1929.  
all right let's just see about getting in there 
see how it's done but yeah there it is right  
there remind me Fried Chicken sooner you got room 
for a little Fried Chicken should be since 1929.  
all right this traffic yeah man this is like a 
much more dense part of Chinatown I think we can  
get a bus out that Indian uh Magic hand just 
sort of throw your hand out and start walking  
I'm a little nervous though I'm gonna put forest 
this way I bet we can do it I think I got a plan  
we usually I look for a local Crossing but I don't 
see any locals that might be a sign that there's  
no locals crossing right here yeah maybe this is 
actually okay here we go we got a little window  
all right here we go here we go here 
we go thank you all right we did it  
okay all right we got it okay it's the Fried

it looks really good colorful it's got so the  
the Fried Chicken this is what they're famous 
for you've got the noodles the rice and then a  
little kind of bonus oh that's really hot like a

came with soup should we start with the soups wow 
this cools down because this is uh it's actually  
pretty hot so oh yeah I said the little banana

just I got the wrong frequency but this should be 
actually we're gonna do some seat switching so I  
can shoot from this angle I didn't know the not 
the suit okay okay salty I see icy sweet no citrus
this gentleman I was kind of coaching us 
on what to do so this kalamanci that's  
the name the calamansi is basically

so we've done we've done it's pretty much a 
straight shot down a couple of streets uh but yeah  
I think anywhere you turn any shop you go into for 
street food I mean if it's got a cue like this at  
four in the afternoon you know it's a Hopping 
spot all right so we're gonna rest the battery  
for a little bit but uh once we get up there 
you know for sure we're getting those show Pals  
ship out all right our time is upon us we're 
just like two three people back I believe if  
I'm reading the science right it's 35 Pesos 
for one we're gonna go with two of the show  
Pals uh-oh I don't see any more trays hopefully 
we didn't just miss it that that'd be horrifying  
oh no I bet there's another tray somewhere 
down below are there more oh there's a whole  
oven full of them so yeah I bet the cues I bet 
the queue's waiting for those really hot ones  
all right so you can see a bunch of other 
YouTubers have been here before pretty cool  
this place is quite popular I 
mean that Cube certainly shows it  
oh there they are you see the guys are making 
them here just before they go into that steamer
oh Granite you excited yeah yeah I think they're 
gonna be really tasty yeah I think too yeah
there you go this lid on all right so 
we'll just kind of hang out in the queue  
until they're they're ready so we'll 
get the hot fresh ones that's a bonus  
all right you can see these done ones so fluffy 
they I think they at least tripled in size yeah  
off the steamer onto the plate and then into the 
bag so there's four of them we're getting two

um they're like green vegetables in it 
okay so it's a mix of pork and vegetables  
wow see that's a big old bite oh yeah I

it's steam so that bun should be a bit chewy 
different than say like a hamburger bun yeah
