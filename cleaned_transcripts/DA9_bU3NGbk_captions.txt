-I was working
since I was like 14.
Like, there was this bizarre
telemarketer job
that a bunch of my friends did
in high school,
and they, like -- they stick you
with a piece of paper
and you read the piece of paper
to somebody.
And, like, to interview
for the job was like,
"Read this piece of paper."
And you read it,
and she's like, "Okay.
When can you start?"
And we did it after school.
And then, like, one time,
I was so fu--
It's so fucking boring,
I fell asleep.
They said, "You can't
work any more."

Hi. My name is Dale Talde,
and I am the chef founder
of Food Crush Hospitality.
And today, I'll be making black
beans with adobo mushrooms.
So, this dish is really
a variation of a Filipino dish
that my mom makes
from where she's from
in the Philippines,
called iloilo.
And it's originally
called KBL --
Kadyos, Baboy, and Langka.
And kadyos is the black beans,
baboy is pig,
and "langka" means jackfruit.
It's, like, this dark
and murky stew,
and I think that's what's
really cool about adobo
is that it means so much
to the people.
And, like, adobo is never
one of those things
when you go out
to a Filipino restaurant,
you almost never
see it on the menu
because they always have it
at the house,
and it was one of
my favorite things growing up
and it still is today.
So, let's get started
with the beans.
To flavor the beans,
we're gonna take some shallots.
Let's get some garlic.
What I like about this dish
is that
it's such a murky, like, stew.
This is definitely my, like,
bastard version of this.
My mom probably would kill me
if she knew
I was making, like,
a vegetarian.
We're going to dice this.
What you're making now
is your sofrito.
I'm gonna smash some chilies.
I do like this dish with
a certain amount of heat to it
'cause I think it adds
a nice bite to something
that's sweet and salty and sour.
Chop up some garlic.
And a rough chop is fine.
I love Filipino food.
I just think sometimes,
it's a little heavy for me.
Like, I'm not
from the Philippines.
I was born and raised
in Chicago.
You know?
So me loving this dish
is definitely, like,
a first-generation American.
I'm just here to kind of, like,
update it, lighten it up,
and give a different spin on it,
'cause I'm not traditional.
This is your sofrito -- onions,
shallots, these bird chilies.
Being in Southeast Asia,
the Philippines does use
a fair amount of lemongrass,
and I don't think
it really shows a lot in --
in some of the dishes.
But this flavor profile
is definitely necessary.
And what we do is...
smash the lemongrass
to release the essential oils.
Going in with the aromatics.
Besides being --
not overcooking your beans,
this is the most important part
of this entire dish.
Unlike, I think,
French cuisine --
I was classically
French trained,
and there was always this,
like, softness
or this gentleness
to cooking our aromatics,
making sure
they don't get burned
or getting too much color
on them.
You want color in this.
You want a toasty garlic,
a toasty shallot,
a toasty chili in this,
and I think that really sets
the tone for the entire dish.
If you don't cook this
long enough,
or if you start to add salt
in this right now
so it doesn't brown,
you're never gonna get
that intensity of the garlic
and the shallot and the chili
that you need to --
for this dish
to be really delicious.
While we are letting
our sofrito cook,
we are going to strain
our tamarind.
Pass this through a sieve.
You can eat these pieces.
They're just not a great
mouth feel in the dish.
Like, any tropical places are --
they have tamarind.
So, Caribbean islands,
Southeast Asia,
you know, Mexico,
Central America.
And it has this
really beautiful acidity to it.
I don't know if you know
anything about Filipino food.
They love sour. We love sour.
You know,
and I think it was a purpose of,
like, preservation.
Vinegars, things that were sour,
like, held better.
But I love the way
that Filipinos use it in,
like, savory food.
So, we're gonna add
our lemongrass.
So, we made a mushroom stock.
You could definitely use a veg
stock here if you wanted to.
And we're gonna use this
to deglaze the pan
and kind of stop the cooking.
But we're using mushroom stock
to kind of give umami
and to mirror the flavors
of the trumpet mushrooms
we're gonna cook.
We've -- We soaked some black
beans here in water overnight,
and we're gonna drain them.
And we're gonna add them
to the pot.
To this,
we're gonna add soy sauce,
and we're gonna add
all of our tamarind puree.
I'm gonna take canned jackfruit.
I like the canned version
of jackfruit.
I mean, I think getting real --
like, whole jackfruit
is such a daunting task to clean
and pick ones that are ripe.
And this has, like, really
good mouth feel to it.
It's a sturdy fruit
that actually, when you cook it,
it doesn't lose its,
like, integrity.
We're just cutting it into,
like, large pieces.
Season this, salts.
Some black pepper.
We want to put some more water
into this
'cause it's -- the beans
are gonna soak it up.
I mean, the dish is supposed to
be brothy and served over rice,
so the -- the rice
kind of soaks up all the juices.
We'll bring this up to a boil,
turn it down to simmer,
and then let it cook for about,
I think, like 45 minutes
to an hour.
Just until the beans
are just tender.
So, when you look up adobo
in the Philippines,
you'll see a basic recipe
of vinegar, soy sauce, garlic,
onions, bay leaves,
and cracked black pepper.
But because the Philippines
is made of, like,
I'm not sure how many
different provinces
and, uh, regions,
but it is like 7,000 islands --
you will find different
variances in p--
in styles of adobo.
You'll see adobo that has
coconut milk in it.
You'll see, like, a white adobo
that has no soy sauce in it.
And you'll see drier ones.
This style that we're doing here
is from my mom's region.
It's in Basilan,
so that's a southern region
of the Philippines,
and this is a dry adobo.
So if you could imagine
it's almost as if
you're pickling the ingredient
and then reducing
the liquid out of it.
So it's --
almost sits in this fat,
and it's almost, like,
preserved in this fat.
But it's a cooked dish.
It's not, like, uh, pickles.
I chose to use, like, king
oyster, royal trumpet mushrooms.
I just feel like
they are the heartiest
of the mushrooms out there.
They really hold up to a braise,
and they feel like
you're eating meat.
So, we're gonna take off
the bottoms
and then split these in half.
In restaurants that I'm at,
they clean the outside of these,
and I love the idea
of keeping these whole
'cause I feel like it adds,
like,
an even heartier texture
to the mushroom.
Get the pan rippin' hot.
We're going to score the
mushroom to make it look pretty
and to get the vinegar
really incorporated
or, you know,
really penetrate the mushroom.
And whenever I'm searing
mushrooms, I --
one, I do not season
the mushroom
'cause I want to get --
let it get a really great sear
on it without --
It's to kind of release
some of its moisture.
One of the keys for me
is cooking this like you cook
or sear a piece of steak.
Hearty amount of oil.
So, this is coconut oil.
Want to stay in this whole world
of the Philippines,
and, you know, they use
a lot of coconuts there, so...
[ Pan sizzling ]
So, let this sear on one side.
Got a healthy amount
of oil in here.
You might need more.
Mushrooms, like,
really soak up oil.
That's why I love using
mushrooms for this application
because they soak up
whatever you're gonna give them.
And you can see the pan
started with a lot of oil,
and you can see the mushrooms
have already started
to heat up into that.
So, you want this type of color
all throughout the mushroom.
Gonna get that
on the other side.
I want to prep the rest
of the aromatics.
When you have a normal adobo,
my favorite part of,
like, a chicken adobo
is actually the onions
that have been stewed down
in chicken fat and in vinegar.
So, I want to cut these shallots
a little bit big
so you can actually,
like, pick them out.
And you can see they don't
lose their integrity.
And the garlic,
we're just gonna slice.
I'm gonna toast off
the annatto seed in this oil.
Just gonna bloom them
in this oil,
and you're gonna see
it immediately turns
this super cool color, right?
You see annatto seed show up
in a lot of Filipino food.
A lot of it's just for color.
Make something look like
that beautiful saffron red.
If you don't have saffron,
annatto seed
will definitely do the trick.
So now we're gonna add
the shallots,
and it's quite a bit
of shallots that I have in here.
Probably, by weight, almost the
same amount to the mushroom.
So, now I had the mushrooms
back to the pan.
And the -- I guess
the most important part,
bay leaves we'll add
and then coconut vinegar.
And what I like to do is add
just a bit of water to this.
To cook this dish out
almost dry, like,
in my mom's
very traditional style
where you'll see almost the oil
really enrobe the entire dish.
And, you know, this is a very
traditional way of preserving.
So, now that we have the vinegar
in, we can season the dish.
Some salt.
We're gonna let this stew down
and cook down
until it's just the oil,
the mushrooms,
and most of the liquid
is gone from this.
And that'll probably take
about 15, 20 minutes.
That's why I like using
the shallow pan with edges,
'cause it can do that
very slowly,
and you have more control
when -- in a pan like this.
'Cause effectively,
you're braising these mushrooms
in vinegar.
You want something
with some high sides to it.
When you hear the sizzle,
not a lot of liquid left,
so that's really kind of
just refrying in this,
so we're gonna season this
with some more pepper.
And then, we're ready
to plate this dish.
We have our black beans here.
So, let's plate up
the black beans and jackfruit.
So then we'll take
a few of these...
...mushrooms.
♪♪
And this oil, it's like this
very beautiful mushroom oil.
And then, like any Filipino,
we're gonna serve this
with some white rice.
And I always leave my rice
separate, and it's just me.
I always leave it separate
from my dish.
Like, I know a lot of people
who would, like,
"Oh, why don't you put
the rice on the bottom?"
and...I don't know.
I like controlling the ratio
of rice to beans to mushroom.
I like those bites.
And that's my, uh, version
of mushroom adobo
with black beans
and jackfruit.
♪♪
So, I just got a bite of
the jackfruit with the beans.
There's a sweet-and-sour note
to this dish that I love.
I like that the mushrooms --
You have to use a knife
and fork for them,
that they are so kind of meaty
and have this beautiful texture
to them.
And then, together, you really
get the floral sweetness
from coconut oil,
definite sourness from,
you know, the coconut vinegar
and the mushroom.
I love this. [ Laughs ]
