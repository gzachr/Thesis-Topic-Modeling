Hey guys, what's going on? Dave waffle back at it once again to talk about another great country today?
We are talking about the philippines, but before I get in this video
I want to know from all of you guys out there in the real world. I want to know considering
We're going to talk about animals with your favorite animal. Come on. Let me know down there Mina. [I]
Can't talk to New York. I was good to the hedgehog, but I don't know what happened
But let me know your favorite animals down there and on top of that once again
This is another one of our videos that has been requested by so many of you people like Ricardo and [yura]
Kristine Casa [poles] [Nadine] Jan Jessica Poms and Sarah Nina
And of course a lot [more] of you guys because you guys
Really wanted us to do this
So thank you guys so [much] for turning our eyes to this nation which for those who are joining us for the first time here
on this channel
We really like to listen to you so get in on the comments section make a recommendation
Because we talk about everything and everything you have an idea. Well. That's know
We're going to do it now parsley where does the philippines get its name from well this all comes from King Philip II of Spain
your Spanish Explorer Rua Lopez de Villalobos [vane] to the collection of Islands in the
1540s at lot [it's] a Filipina now
Let's not get this confused with Brandon Magellan who first really discovered the philippines for Spain this is when he landed on Hamona
on March 16th of
1521 and at that point he claimed or founded the Islands as part of Spain and it wasn't until later that the
Archipelago got the whole name the Philippines [now] speaking of the archipelago of the philippines it comprises of
7,107 - approximately 7,000
600 Islands the reason for this
inconsistency is sometimes there's high tides and small islands get swallowed up by the water and surprisingly enough this country has a
landmass of about
[300,000] kilometers [Square] here the population of over
102 Million Five hundred
Thousand and because [of] that it sits at the 12th most populous country with a growth rate of two percent
Meaning it is one fast growing country now the philippines was the first south Asian country to gain Independence after the second world war
In the late 1800s the philippines got caught between a quarrel with the united states and spain and after the Spanish-American war which ended in
1898 with the signing of the Treaty of Paris the Philippines had a problem being under the rule of the United States and this
resulted in a three-year war [Jutland] from 1899 to 1902 now strives for Independence began in the
1900s [what] in 1934 they introduced the philippine Independence act
which gave the philippines the limited Independence until the United States granted full Independence however because of World [War] 2 the
philippine independence was postponed until it became a free nation on july 4Th of
1946 and this was all due to the treaty of
Manila now during the second world war this [was] not just a dark time [for] other countries
But a dark time for the philippines as well as during this time most of the islands were occupied by the Japanese
Now we all know of the terrible attack on Pearl Harbor which happened on December 7tH 1941?
December 8th about [10] hours later
Manila was also surprised attacked by a japanese land and Air Force the large-scale attack on Manila and the ton
Resulted in general macarthur being ordered to retreat [from] the philippines which made resupplying and [counter-attacking] the philippines
Impossible until he returned on October 20th
1944 and
Unfortunately by the time the war ended the conflict had taken the lives of five hundred and [twenty-seven] thousand people now
let's jump out [of] the dark moments in the philippine history and talk about some of the lighter and greater moments of the philippines the
Philippines is a
country that is rich with
all Sorts of different types of lights as a matter of fact they say there is a large portion of life that they've never even
Discovered yet, [so] what makes the philippines great?
is that it is the country with the highest rate of discovery for a new life for example [in] july of
2006 they found
23 new species of Mammal and that was discovered on the island of
Lucia now the interesting thing about the philippines is that 90% of its population is
Christian and 80% of them are identified as Roman catholic what I mind also weird about that
Is that it is the only South Asian country to have a catholic?
Majority [and] because of that the philippines holds the world's longest Christmas
Celebration now the reason for this is [because] it is very common to [see] people in september putting up decorations
At their houses or in Malls
Actually up here in North America
We love the Christmas tree
But down there they prefer their Christmas parole which are lights created from Bamboo and paper and the holiday itself usually
Continues into January with the feast of the three kings now speaking of balls
Do you guys know that the philippines has four of the world's top largest malls those walls are Sm megamall
Sm
Seaside City Cebu
Sm the Mall of Asia and the biggest one coming at third in the entire world the Sm
North EdSa Mall with over five million one hundred
thousand square feet now one thing that's really interesting about the philippines it is the world's top supplier of
Nurses, that's right
25% of all the nurses worldwide actually come from this country and not only that but
11% of its population are
Generally working all abroad which equals to almost 11 million people now another [thing] that makes the philippines
Amazing is its amount of un e [ezio] [world] [heritage] [sites] one of the most famous is [the] rice terraces of the cordillera
Which date [back] to over [2000] [years] ago now they were inducted into the une seo in
1995 and it was the first ever property in the heritage list as a
cultural landscape and speaking of [heritage] sites you might be shocked to know that the philippines have nine of them right that range from
Churches to mountains and let's not even consider the other 19 that are on the list for consideration
But one [of] the most special heritage sites is this about a reef
Yes, battery is located in the sulu sea
And this was a site that was inscribed in 1993 it is home to no less than six hundred species of fish
350 Coral 11 Shark Species
13 Dolphin and whale species and over a hundred species of bird and because [it's] diversity in life it is one of the most protected
Sites in the entire world that's it guys my name's dave waffle head. It's been awesome talking about the philippines
This is one that I've been looking forward to for [a] while
I know you guys have but you know I've always wanted to go to the philippines because it looks really beautiful
But for all you guys out there be sure [to] leave comments for future places for us to talk about because for me
It's been awesome talking about the philippines and learning something new about a country that has a vast and amazing
landscape while just merely touching on its history and stories [of] its people and culture a
growing country with lots to offer from heritage sites on
Land to aquatic the Philippines is a place that helps remind us that we are not the only creatures in the big picture
We call life
