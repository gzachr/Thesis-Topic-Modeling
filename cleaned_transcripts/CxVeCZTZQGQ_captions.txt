good morning everybody so today we are heading to  
the Philippines Manila and we're going to be 
showing you basically our first impressions of  
this city but right now we're in Bangkok so 
let's get on the plane and let's go to manila
we've just got through check-in and we're going  
to manila it's official now we've got 
all the documents all the right stuff
so we have just arrived in the Philippines we're 
in manila right now and we're just gonna have a  
little walk around and just basically explore 
the city we're gonna be meeting a friend i met  
last time was in the Philippines so yeah we're 
gonna meet him later so yeah let's go and explore  
so joel has been to the Philippines 
before but it's actually my first time so  
first impressions of the whole country but i 
actually never came to manila you think of manila  
sometimes you hear a lot about how it can be quite 
dangerous so yeah we're gonna let you know how we  
feel about being in the city and what it's like to 
be here as a foreigner motorbikes the old jeepneys
these two are grabbing mangoes 
from the tree how cool is that  
so we're back in the hostel now but i'm about 
to go meet my friend that i met last time i  
was in the Philippines he's from manila yeah he 
actually lives in manila so he'll be able to take  
me to some of the spots but i've actually not been 
feeling very well i've had some food poisoning so  
i'm going to chill yeah for a bit unfortunately 
yeah amelia's going to stay here just because  
we don't want to you know stress her out with 
all the food pausing and stuff that you've had  
for like a few weeks in thailand so 
she's gonna stay here i'm gonna go  
out and so you're obviously coming with us 
so well with me so let's go see you later
okay guys so i'm with my friend now zen thumb 
and we just got these little iced coffees  
yeah little iced coffees they're like a little 
slushy kind of thing but it's actually really nice  
and i think we're heading where are we heading cc 
beach i think it's like an artificial beach and  
yeah we're gonna head there and i will take 
you with you i can't speak let's carry on
so guys we are now in the ccp basically this 
area as you can see around me is used to be  
the actual sea but they put loads of blocks 
down and basically now it's now it's land
so we've just arrived at manila 
bay and it looks so beautiful here  
you can actually see the views in the 
background these are like the skyline  
it looks really modern from here there's also a 
yacht club here there's also a guy swimming down  
there's a guy swimming here how cool 
is that i mean i want to kind of get in  
the water it's so warm it's actually not as 
warm as bangkok bangkok at the moment is oh  
it's too hot but yeah this is a really nice area 
of the town obviously there's stereotypes in  
manila that it's a really dangerous place and i 
think there are you know there's places that you  
shouldn't go as a foreigner but i think around 
here i feel pretty safe and obviously being with  
zen it's obviously it feels a lot safer because 
you know he knows his way around where not to go
wait what is that bird that looks so cool is 
it fake oh no no no it's moving what is it  
you don't know they probably attacked me some 
some filipino bird all right we'll leave it alone
so we've just come to exclusive access of 
the beach area which they are building it's  
an artificial field and i'm not sure when it's 
going to be finished they started building it  
last year but it looks it's going to be really 
cool we might bring more tourism into the area  
there's so it's just along the marina 
marina bay um manila bay so i get good  
views of thailand still but yeah it looks 
like it's going to be a really cool area
a little notice please follow me on instagram 
if you want live updates of where we are  
and what we're doing thank y'all good man what's 
your name stephen nice to meet you i'm joel you're  
watching on this youtube watch me on youtube 
one of the nice things about the philippines is  
people actually speak really good english 
especially compared to like somewhere like  
thailand just because in the textbooks it's 
all written in english and so even the kids  
like that kid back there i could actually speak to 
him which was really nice but we've just reached  
rizzle what was it called grizzle park which is 
like a big monument right in the center of manila  
and yeah let's check this out look at this 
big old filipino flag right in the middle
sorry
so we're at rizzo park and there's well there's 
a tree blocking it now but there was the filipino  
flag and it's pretty cool around there it's really 
busy because it's actually good friday and if you  
don't know the philippines is a catholic country 
so it's a national holiday so yeah it's very well  
kept around here very clean as well look how many 
people are at this park it's crazy it probably  
is because it's good friday but it's just amazing 
it's nice to see everyone out enjoying themselves
hey
come on okay so we are gonna head back to my 
hostel now we're actually gonna ride a jeepney  
which is like a filipino bus big taxi thing but 
a load of people jump on it they look really cool  
last time i was here i never took one so we're 
gonna go on one and see what it's like so let's go
um
we just got off the jeep thingy and it only cost 
us nine pesos to come back which is i'll put the  
conversion on the screen it was such a good price 
and now we just got a little walk back to the  
hostel which is great it was so cool like everyone 
just jumps on and jumps off and it's a really  
cheap way of traveling around the city and a lot 
of places a lot of cities around the philippines  
i just wanted to say the filipino people just 
seem so happy and outgoing and always want to  
wave at you and say hello and it just makes you 
feel really welcome in this country okay so i  
didn't really explain what happened but basically 
we had dinner in the hotel and well the hostel and  
basically just relaxed for a bit in the evening 
with zen chris who you would have met manila was  
really cool to stay there for a bit but obviously 
it can be considered dangerous so just make sure  
you stay in safe areas and do your research before 
you go to the city but overall i found it very  
safe especially um going around with a local and 
yeah that's my thoughts so we are now in a super  
new cool location and i can't wait for the next 
video which will be out on sunday to show you  
where we are it's going to be very exciting yeah 
it's so it's so cool and it's literally behind me  
but yeah make sure you're subscribed please like 
the video and we will see you in the next one
