Hi everyone! Welcome back for another vlog
and this time we're going to do another mukbang vlog
because a lot of you have commented on
the last video, where we did an unboxing
that turned out like a mukbang of
Filipino food. Yeah, so a lot of you have commented
how you like seeing her eat pandesal
So now we're going do a proper
mukbang of pandesal
mmm Loads of pandesal
I don't know if anyone has ever actually done
a mukbang of pandesal
We might be the only ones
Yeah, so... I don't know what that is
this...Oh yeah I got something new
we've got some ensimada as well
ensimada
Yeah
I think it's got ube inside it
It looks purple so...
I thought it was actually blueberries
Oh...
Yeah
You don't get blueberries in the Philippines
Right, so we got 2 Spanish bread,
we've got three pandesal there
Is that to share, the extra one?
Yeah, to share and then I made some scrambled egg
I cooked it how you would cook it in the Philippines
Slightly burned, yep
What's different? How do you cook it differently?
Oh well, you burn it in the Philippines
and some sausages,
we don't have the red sausages here
hot dogs, so that'll do
Chilli bratwurst
Yeah... oh, and we've also got some
Kutsinta... again. Yes!
Extremely delicious
What's that sauce at the back?
It's for the kutsinta
caramel, isn't it?
Yeah, mmm
and then we've got some tomato sauce
ketchup and some mayonnaise
We've got 2 mayonnaise,
because I've got this Kuppai mayo
and It's really expensive so we'll not use loads of that
£5 a bottle for that!
It's really good though
yeah
so we'll not use a lot of this
Just a little bit
We've got the regular mayo
Which is like about...£1
yeah
so yeah
and it's bigger
Right let's eat
let's pray
oh yeah
So we'll start with the Spanish bread
Yep
get the Spanish bread and then...
you dip it in coffee
Oh!
What with the middle bit inside it as well?
are you sure you drink it to put in
coffee so everyone knows
that makes sense oh that's delicious
isn't it
i'll tell you what it's delicious
so up it's also very expensive
how much actually was it i never look at
prices
i just grab things like three questions
we can't waste any of them
wait three pounds for five
pieces of panda song it's worth it
though
i'd pay 10 pounds 20 pounds to pander
well you didn't pay yesterday did you
you let me pay your credit card was in
my test
so why not so
this this is what we normally do in the
philippines i don't know if
you guys do this as well so normally be
the
red hot dog
notice i gave you a knife and fog
you did yeah and i put them in the
proper way
this one
brought loads yeah cutlery because i'm
not sure what the exactly what we're
using
okay so oh no i don't know i want the
bits on top
it's messy
i'm gonna give you some sausages i think
i do need a knife actually
no no you don't need a knife
i do think the philippines has the best
bread in the world
i don't know if there's anyone out there
who disagrees and thinks they've got
better bread
it's funny though because canned this
out is something that we grew up with
it was stable yeah you took it for
granted
and then she tried to plan this out like
oh i absolutely love this
yeah and i'd wake up nice and early just
so i could have
extra while everyone's sleeping my mom
machines
philippines yeah there's always pandesal
every day and i don't normally have
canvas out every day but because
she's there we have this all every day
she made this uh
tuna tuna yeah
she made a big batch of it and i noticed
when we went for little trips out in the
car there'd be a little
style with this tuna bear would you
practice some pandas all as well
all right so where's your panda sal here
you got to put a tomato sauce yes oh you
don't like too much sauce do you
oh that's all right there you go
i would never put tomato sauce on bread
though
cool thank you put some
mail i'm not using the nicer meal
you've got a plan for that haven't you
now put some egg right
there that's cut nice before you
yeah ricky
uh
oh i think we need this every day
a bit like delicious no it's bad
thumbs up definitely that's delicious
i like how you do the egg what burned
and then we used to make omelette like
she puts cheese inside it
that's why i take to school or pack
orange and some rice
trust me i can eat it all when it's this
delicious
it was actually really good
it's fun in the park
lovely oh this is interesting trying to
squeeze this in
thanks very much

very nice of cheese you can't buy it out
here
all right so we're having kuchindta or
