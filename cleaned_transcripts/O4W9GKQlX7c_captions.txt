for the single guys out there
this is what's
gonna happen to you
so if Abe said at one point
you wanted to be this this is
it!
[audience laughter]
this will be the highlight of your life
[audience laughter]
performing for a bunch of strangers
on Saturday night because you want to
escape your kids
[audience laughter]
I mean we love our kids
don't get us wrong but sometimes you
want to kill 'em right? that's why you leave
and then you vent and then you come back
the lovey-dovey dad again. coz you
gotta take a break
otherwise... that's why in the States they
don't have yayas
they kill their kids
that's what happens
I'm not saying it's

HAPPY WIFE!
especially coz their wives are here

nothing rhymes with husband
that's why it's like happy husband - who cares
nobody gives a ****
you happy you sad just pay the bill
just pay the bill [bleep]
we don't care if you're happy
we give you one day, father's day
and who cares? even on father's day
you still have to pay the bill [bleep]
[audience laughter]

have to pay right you have to pay for
sex that's true
maybe not always in cash
you pay with commitment
you marry you ladies for life
anyway if you
guys want to keep your wife happy here's the secret
you just gotta always say those three
words that she wants to hear from you
even if you don't feel like saying those
three words you say it
