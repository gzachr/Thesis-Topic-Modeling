there's a reason people love looking at
waterfalls it's almost like staring
directly into a flame the hypnotic
powerful and breathtakingly beautiful
the waterfalls in the Philippines are
all of these things but also the most
incredible shade of Gatorade blue as
they're often called and it's a pretty
spot-on comparison
where Matt and Danielle from couples
Quest and today we're taking you on an
adventure to see the top five best
waterfalls that you can find in the
Philippines
[Music]
first up is the most fun waterfall in
the Philippines this is camburger High
Falls in City Hall and you can see
straight away why people love spending
entire days here
before the water is so blue it's amazing
we had a bit of a hiccup this morning it
doesn't open until eight o'clock well
actually it's been there until 8 20.
yeah you have to wait for someone to
come and uh open it and by that point
quite a few people here but it's still
incredibly beautiful there's a swing
that I've been off
I think you can have a lot of fun here
so come check it out
[Music]
a few things to know about camburger hay
Falls it's 20 pesos entry per person and
the swing is an extra 50 pesos for that
you can swing all day until your heart's
content which is definitely worthwhile
the rat is 100 pesos but be prepared to
be photobombed by people who can't
resist that swim AKA us
oh
my God
if there's a waterfall that needs to be
on your Philippines bucket list then
this is it it's so much fun

waterfall which is amazing to explore we

much fun here you can jump swim right up
the Towering waterfalls and then go and
