So last week we went to Fashion Valley Mall
It's one of the nicest mall here in San Diego
They also carry high end products
I really found good deals there
including Forever 21 and TOPSHOP
But anyways, I am going to include those clips
in this video
and we are having lunch ar Blue Smoke
We just ordered a lot of dishes because we are hungry
what we have here is miso soup
and we have one of their best sellers
and here is what they call ishiyaki hot stove
and here is our meats
and just place it on top of this heat
you can costumize your sauce if you like
And we are here in TOPSHOP
here are the clothes that I am going to try on
first one is this black jeans
this is a new arrival
I love the fitting and specially the embroidery
this jeans is $110
what i like about this jeans is the high rise fit
one of my favorite style recently
next is this black shear top
and it has some bell sleeve style with dots
next is the white crop top and I will definitely buy this one
because it very comfortable and i love white collar tops
and also the price for this one is $55
another crop top that i really like but did not buy is this one
i like the fitting
but I am definitely buying this jeans by moto mid blue step jeans
its a high waist jeans
the reason i like this jeans is its perfect shade of blue
and the its price is $75
and our next product here is from FOREVER 21
I am getting this pastel colored kimono
with embroidered details
I think the design is very classy and looks very cute
and it goes with everything like jeans, shorts or dresses
in case you are wondering, this is priced at $7.90
next is this long drape dress long line trench coate
i need something light this
very light weight and i can wear it almost anywhere
and this cost about $34.90
this one is a utility jacket with four pockets and the details is superb
but i think i will pass one this one becuase the size is too big for me
even though this is already in extra small size
So I am here in front of Forever21
and i just bought a whole bunch of stuff
and it took me forever to get through the whole store
and TOPSHOP had a great sale in their clothes
and later I will do a haul on what i've purchased today
here is COACH
but we are going upstairs to buy some coffee
hey guys so now we are getting some ice coffe
because of the hot day
and just an update, we are going home
I just finished shopping
just spent all my money today so we are done!
and here is our ice coffee
i ordered a hazel nut ice coffee
the taste is quite different from your normal coffee because of the Morocan coffee beans that they used
anyways, lets go home and see you later!
