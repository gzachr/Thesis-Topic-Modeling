Hi
Yo everybody it's your boy JRE and right now we're about to check out Sistar's Lonely
when I saw the teaser and I told it in my own kpop video
I was like yo I hope it's like summer bop to like leave like on a high note but they got that- it's called Lonely.
it's slow
it sounds sad
I don't know what to expect
well I feel like it's just sad
I just remember I didn't get into Sistar as a group
I got into Sistar19 first
I remember
when I first really got into KPOP
when
MA BOY
Still, to this day, one of my favorite songs of all time
Sistar! Sistar came with them hits, after hits *clap*
They are Hyolyn, Bora, Soyou, Dasom.
It's sucks that they are disbanding
but- I don't know.
I love me some Sistar
like Sistar gets you back-in-the-mood
even though their slow stuff was good too
obviously Hyolyn is gonna do her solo stuff
it looks like it
it's seems like
They're either gonna go do their solo stuff
wither be acting, singing, whatever they want- you know modeling I don't know
they're all talented
it's depends on the kpop fans- if you're into Sistar or not
if you ain't into Sistars there's the door
enough talking- Let's begin!
