this is going to be
[Music]
very crunchy airy salty i like sauteed
crackers
jingling say that three times
no it's a bit spicy not spicy at all i
thought it would be more we can handle
spice
we can have spice that's something
that's great but enough to taste
yeah that's
[Laughter]
[Applause]
i like all of them to be honest hey
how's the whole six which one's your
favorite
i'm gonna have to go to the corn kernels
i would be a stretch between these two
and you'll be the qualcomm i'm gonna be
the corn crown it's called boy bowel
probably
these are pretty damn good crunchy i
like it
these are second because i love the
airiness this is made out of
all things evil that's why it's so
delicious
my favorite will probably be the one
that cheetos
favorite is this one as for its
nutritional value
which one's your least favorite
that one yeah
these two
[Music]
my least favorite would probably be the
sweet corn
if i really had to say there's one that
really packed a punch as an aftertaste
i'm gonna have to go to the prawn ones
that's your worst one
for the ones i didn't like the most the
most
um definitely these for my first and
then this quick form as in the second
front
