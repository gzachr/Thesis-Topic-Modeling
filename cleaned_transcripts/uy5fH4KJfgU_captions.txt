when we immigrated to the u.s from the
philippines we stayed in daly city with
our auntie edith and her family
i remember waking up the first morning
and they had turned on the tv so we
could watch
bananas in pajamas but there was one
problem
i couldn't understand anything they were
saying
and their voices were different i
remembered staring at the tv having like
an existential crisis
are the bananas and pajamas not filipino
or are these the fake bananas in pajamas
am i going bananas
