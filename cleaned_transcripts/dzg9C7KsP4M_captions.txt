- Ooh!
- (man) It's chicken intestines.
- Did he just say chicken intestines?
Woah, it looks like
an intestines.
(laughs) This is funny.
- It kinda looks like a lollipop.
- Mm-hmm.
- It's like a tube of chicken.
- I bet it's just gonna 
taste like chicken.
- I would assume
it's pretty chewy.
- Beautiful.
- (PvF) Isaw, or grilled intestines
is one of the most sought-after dishes
at street markets.
- And I know why.
- It's good?
- It's good!
- It smells like I'm walking past...
- (laughs) Secretions?
- The flamingo exhibit.
- No, these are good,
hell yeah.
- This was inside a chicken.
- So was this!
- (laughs) I know,
but all I keep thinking about
is how this was literally
wrapped up, in the way it is now.
- I think just the fact that
you know it's chicken intestine
makes it weird.
- Okay, if I'm being honest,
it tasted like carne asada.
- Have you ever thought like
what if an alien came down to Earth,
killed us, and then was doing 
food review videos of our intestines?
- (laughs) Oh my God.
♪ (upbeat music) ♪
- Okay, this is cool.
- Oh, woah, woah,
that's like a whole four-course meal.
- I mean, it's like,
that's a work of art.
- Oh, it's so nicely organized.
Like, it stays in there.
- I want that, 'cause I always want
different kinds of pizza.
- Yeah!
- It looked tasty.
- Yeah, it looked yummy.
- Yeah!
- Mm-hmm.
You know what, Sharon,
I'm hungry, we should order a pizza.
- Japan Domino's?
We'd like the Quattro, please.
- (gasps) Oh my God, Sharon!
- (gasps) Oh!
- Wow, talk about fast delivery!

- (PvF) This is the most famous
type of Korean hot dog,
called the potato.
It's the classic covered
in a layer of crispy French fries
before being deep-fried
and sprinkled again with sugar.
- Oh wow.
I see hot Cheeto dust,
so I know...
That's not hot Cheeto dust.
French fries, what?
- This looks like the most
American food.
French fry hot dog.
If I told you this was at like Denny's
you'd probably believe me.
- Oh, we're gonna give this
a try now.
Okay, here we go.
- We're gonna go 
right in the middle.
We got this, Emma.
- Alright, it's good.
It's actually quite good.
- The sugar, it goes well,
like again, it's one of those
strange things where you 
don't expect it to go well together,
but it does.
- I'll give this a taste,
oh my God!
That's a lot of cheese!
- Ah, oh!
This is the best hot dog
I've ever had.
- Yet again, the cheese dog strikes.
- (PvF) Pani puri is easily 
one of the most popular street foods
on the Indian sub-continent.
The round flatbreads
are called puri,
and the soupy water is called pani.
Together, they make for 
one of the best treats on the street.
- Ooh.
- Ah!
- It smells good.
- Oh, these are so cute!
- Can you put,
sometimes it's spicy,
but I feel like it's 
more like spices.
- They said to crack it open
in the middle,
oh wow, that really
cracks open real easily.
- I love that it's just like
a little cereal bowl of deliciousness.
- A little bit of that.
- I want as much as I can.
- Oh, it smells kinda...
- Is it like hot?
- It smells a little lemony.
- Cheers.
- Mmm!
- Mmm!
- I was expecting the soup
to be warm,
but it's really good cold.
- Can we eat all of them?
- (PvF) You can eat all of them.
- Oh yes!
- But it's pretty good.
- I like how you can just make it,
and just...
- Mmm!
- Oh, I'm making a mess.
- I think it's good!
- I could jam on that all day.
- (PvF) We have a traditional Georgian
cheese-filled bread called Kachapuri.
It's very popular in both restaurants
and as street food.
- Is that pizza,
or a vagina?
(Zaria laughs)
- I need one of these ovens
in my house.
- Wow, that looks really good.
- Uh, I'll try it!

ricotta, feta in there.
There's fresh herbs.
- This is an Arab pastry, actually.

- Don't tell me to eat it!
- Just take a bite!
Just one little bite,
just nibble at it.

- Uh huh, I was just waiting.
- I might as well just go ahead.
I know.

- (PvF) So we've stolen
one of the trays of paella
from Money Heist 
just for you guys.
- Oh.
- That looks so good.
- We don't deserve this royalty!
- (PvF) Have you ever had
paella before?
- I've never had it,
it always looks so good though.
- This one's not gonna be
very difficult for me to...
- It's not either, because
I'm really not the oyster guy.
(buzzer rings)
- (laughs) I feel like I made it
so far already.
- Mmm!

that strong.
(buzzer rings)
Mmm.

low key, just the rice.

I blame all of this on her,
it's pretty good!

salesperson for all of this.
- (PvF) Fit fit is made with
shredded injera bread,
clarified butter, berbere spices,
and leftover wat or stew.
- Yo!
- It smells like chorizo.
- It's very interesting,
'cause it's very spongy,
but very thin at the same time.
It's almost like a crepe.
- Ooh, sour!
- Ooh, it's got a kick.
- Spicy!
- The thing that trips me up, is...
- Is the spiciness of this meat.
- Oh this meat, yeah.
- Or whatever.
- Man, that's good!
- Yeah, that's really good.
- Man, that's good!
That'll start your day off right.
I feel like I kind of know
where this is from,
but I don't know, 
like specifically where?
- Me too, I have a region!
- Yeah, same.
- Flat, but it's airy.
- I went with Nigeria.
- And Brazil, interesting.
- (PvF) There are three countries
that I would have given you.
Ethiopia, Eritrea,
or Sudan.
(buzzer rings)
- Okay, we're completely 
not on any...
- This feels more like lunch
to me, than breakfast.
- Aw, it's Ethiopian!
- (PvF) This breakfast is
Ethiopian.
Similar to how Asians 
use all the leftovers
to make fried rice for breakfast.
- (both) Yeah.
- (PvF) That's what this dish is
for Ethiopia.
- Oh, okay, that's pretty cool.
- Oh!
- (PvF) Warm, buttery, flaky, rich
and decadent

better in person.
- Right?
- Look at this,
this is so satisfying.
- It just smells so good.
- I love pastries.
- It's like just a big croissant
- Holy crap, look at that.
- I need to do it.
(buzzer rings)
- It gives me the vibes
of a croissant,
so I feel like it's just like
a very sugary croissant.
- Yeah, just like sweet,
buttery, flaky.
- Don't you think it's worth it?
- Mm-hmm.
- I think this is so worth it.
This, with like hot chocolate.

seen this anywhere?
- Right.
- Where's this stuff hiding?
Like where's this been
all my life?

that you knew all sorts
of Mexican street food.

The beans throws it off
completely for me though.
I just, I can't.
- I have such a weak spot
for taro though,
so this smells just like it.
- I've never had it.
- Mmm!

going on in there.
