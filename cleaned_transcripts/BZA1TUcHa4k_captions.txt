why do i like this dish from the philippines we 
go back to 2008 we were in batangas near the beach  
we were sitting at a big table for dinner at the 
resort with the family and our dinner was served
so 2008 batangas philippines near 
the beach big table with the family  
by the way as with any filipino dish we 
will start this dish with cooking rice  
food was served and those waiters and 
waitresses they have beautiful clothes  
on they served us lots of delicious baboy 
dishes including crispy pata and lechon kawali  
so it will not be the only dish but the 
first part of our dish will be lechon kawali  
we are in rotterdam the netherlands and 
i'm going to get a beautiful piece of  
pork meat for this dish from the 
philippines we need again some baboy
so the baboy story continues like i said 
they served a lot of baboy dishes there  
in batangas now we will fast forward 
to 2017. nakapunan kami sa mall
it was in the city of dreams
okay so you might wonder what is 
the connection the first is in 2008  
and it's uh with pork dishes and the second 
one is in 2017 and it has spicy food with gata  
you can see the baboy is already boiling so first 
before we continue let's get some more ingredients
i'm looking for bagoong i 
hope they have bagoong here
so they don't have bagoong unfortunately 
they have some shrimp paste from  
vietnam but i still want to use the original 
filipino bagoong so let's go to another store  
actually they do have it i found it i found there 
are two types this one is uh ginisang bagoong  
and they also have bagoong so 
i'm gonna take two just in case
we do have the coconut milk and coconut cream  
i'm so happy i found something that really 
looks like a calamansi i'm not sure if it's  
calamansi but it looks very similar let's try 
this one this one looks like you know i'm not  
100 percent sure if you would use ginger in this 
dish but just in case i'll bring a little bit one
we got the ingredients of course the 
ingredients are for bicol express  
now why do i like bicol express
Pogi Pogi why do i like bicol express 
from the philippines Pogi why i like that  
so i will tell you that later but 
first let's take out the lechon kawali  
those look really crispy we will combine this 
with the bicol express to make a crispy version  
do you remember i said i had a nice experience 
eating this in batangas we had lots of fun there  
with the family we did picture tayo lots of 
pictures we did games basketball, Karaoke  
the place was super ganda and so we had a really 
great time there lots of good memories the nice  
thing when you eat food there's always some kind 
of story right you remember a time when you ate  
this food so i wonder what is your favorite uh 
memory eating bicol express or lechon kawali
coconut milk
i will also add a can of coconut cream make 
it extra creamy luya for extra freshness
we want us a little bit of paminta at asin
in terms of sili we'll use three green sili's but 
these are not so spicy i also found labuyo these  
are really spicy but since bicol express is a 
little bit spicy i'm gonna add three of those
a little bit of calamansi juice mmm that smells 
good so what about the 2017 vacation in manila  
well i also had an amazing time there of course 
the food was great but it made it more special  
because of the circumstance i 
was able to enjoy an amazing time  
in the philippines filipino culture with 
lots of jokes of course and laughter  
this is why i love this food bicol express from 
the philippines and this is my crispy version
see you next time with more filipino food
