- Greetings, my beautiful lovelies.
It's Emmy. How are you? And welcome back.
Today, I'm gonna be baking some bread.
I'm gonna be making pandesal.
So, so many of my beautiful
lovelies from the Philippines
have requested that I make pandesal,
and of course, I didn't know what it was
so I had to look it up,
and it looks marvelous.
Pandesal are beautiful little rolls
that are typically eaten
for breakfast or lunch.
And they're so cute and charming,
and they're dusted with a
little bit of bread crumbs.
So stinking cute.
They kind of look like Parker House rolls,
but they're not served typically
in the evening with dinner.
They're had for breakfast or lunch,
and sometimes they're dipped into coffee.
Ooh! Sounds delicious.
Today, I'm gonna be making
two versions of pandesal.
I'm gonna be making an ube version
and ube is a beautiful purple
yam eaten in the Philippines
and all over Asia.
It's got a lovely sweet flavor,
and a gorgeous purple color.
So I'm gonna be making
half a batch with ube.
Oh, not only is it gonna
be flavored with ube,
it's gonna be stuffed with cheese.
So ube cheese pandesal.
And then I'm gonna do the original version
since I've never had pandesal before.
I thought I must have the
original and then I'm gonna do
the sweet, sweet potato version as well.
So big thanks again to all
of my beautiful lovelies
who reached out to me and
requested that I make this recipe.
It looks absolutely lovely.
A little bit of background about pandesal
and how pan or bread was
introduced to the Philippines.
Bread has been in the Philippines
since the 16th century
when it was introduced by colonizers,
and has since become a huge
part of Filipino culture.
So let's go ahead and make some pandesal.
The recipe that I'm gonna be using today
comes from Savory Easy.
I'll put a link down below
to the original recipe.
My plan of attack is to
make the classic pandesal.
I'm gonna divide it in half,
and then the second half,
I'm going to flavor with the ube extract
and then stuff it with cheese.
So let's go ahead and get started it.
In large bowl, we're gonna
add one cup of warm milk. Oop!
Quarter cup of melted butter.
One large egg.
Give a little bit of a mix.
Now we're gonna add two
teaspoons of instant yeast
or rapid rises yeast.
This is not the same as dry active yeast.
If you have dry active yeast,
you're gonna have to
find a conversion online
and you'll probably have to bloom it
in a little bit of warm water.
So this does not need to be bloomed.
Two teaspoons of that,
and switch to my (mumbles)
These measuring cups are
pretty stinking cute.
They're really great for kids actually,
'cause they can visually see
how much a quarter is
relative to one whole cup.
Really great.
I do have to say,
they don't clean up as
nicely as I would like.
They are out of plastic and they scratch.
So yeah, there is that.
And they also have corners.
So they're not the greatest to clean,
but they're great teaching tools.
We're gonna use a quarter cup of sugar.
So these are gonna be sweet,
which is interesting because
this is salt bread pandesal,
but it actually is sweet.
So quarter cup of sugar.
One teaspoon of salt.
Now we're gonna add three
and a quarter cups of flour.
Oop! And form it into a dough.
See what I mean with this whisk?
It's got such large holes that it makes it
really easy to stir a stiff butter.
So this bread recipe does
not require a stand mixer.
Actually most spreads can be
made without a stand mixer.
A stand mixer just makes them
being processed a lot easier.
Very shaggy looking, right?
Now, we're just gonna wrap this
and let it rest for 20
minutes before we knead it.
It will allow the flour
to completely hydrate,
absorb all of that milk and
allow the corn gluten to relax,
and it'll make the kneading
process a little bit easier.
So I will see you in 20 minutes.
It's been 20 minutes, so
let's knead our dough.
I'm gonna divide the dough in half
and I wanna do this accurately.
So I'm using my scale.
Half of this is going to be plain
and half of this is going to be ube.
We're going to knead
this for seven minutes
until the dough is nice
and smooth and elastic.
Now this dough is an enriched dough.
It contains an egg and butter,
kind of similar to like a brioche dough.
And they tend to have a
lot of moisture in them.
So don't be tempted to add too much flour
because you're gonna have
a very dry loaf of bread.
What you're gonna do
instead is just knead it
seven minutes by hand,
and you'll see already,
see how elastic it's getting and smooth.
And when I roll it, it's
actually not sticking
to the surface at all.
And that little bit of a rest time
makes this dough a lot easier to knead.
So our dough is beautiful and shiny.
And I'm tucking the ends under
like this, forming a ball.
Now I'm gonna oil my bowl,
coat the top of the ball,
and tuck it under.
And now we're going to let this rest
for about an hour or so,
or until the dough doubles in size.
For the ube pandesal, we're
gonna add some ube extract.
This is butterfly brand ube flavoring.
Oh, it smells lovely.
Smells nutty, almost like hazelnut. Sweet.
I'm gonna add one tablespoon
of this to my dough.
Ooh! Look at that color.
Look at that.
Oh my gosh.
So since we're adding a
little bit more moisture
to the dough, we might need
to add a little bit of flour.
I mean ...
Gloves, where would you have gloves?
What do you need gloves for?
Gloves.
All right, Frank. Settle down.
All right, so we're just gonna knead this
and try not to get our
hands too badly stained.
I think it's kind of a
lost cause at this point.
I'm gonna use the little bit of flour.
'Cause this looks wet.
(slow dance music)
Here we go.
Work all that ube
flavoring into the dough.
(rock music continues)
You can really feel it
transform in your hands.
Okay. So I think we are
there. That's beautiful.
So tuck the ends under.
Kind of pinch it together,
and then another bowl.
Add some oil.
Ooh! I have an earwig in my oil. Awesome.
Toil it and then flip it over,
and let that rest until it doubles.
Hello, lovelies. I'm back.
It's been about an hour, hour and a half,
and my doughs have doubled beautifully.
Is that interesting how the
ube dough looks larger than
the plain dough even though
they weigh exactly the same amount?
It's because this bowl is smaller.
So it's all about relativity, isn't it?
Now we're gonna shape these into rolls.
So 409 divided by nine is 45 grams.
Is that right? 45, 46 grams.
Yeah. Okay, de-gas this.
Remove the carbon dioxide.
So let me weigh these out.
Now we're gonna shape our dough balls.
Just take the dough and stretch them,
tucking the ends under and
rubbing them to seal them.
So seal it like that.
And then on the countertop,
give them a good little roll.
So we get this cute little sphere,
and then we're gonna roll them
into some fresh bread crumbs.
These are breadcrumbs and then
I push them through a sieve
to make sure they are nice and fun.
Dip them into there.
Oh, look how cute.
They look like little fuzzy hedgehogs.
And now we're gonna place
them onto a baking tray.
Did you know that the
Philippines is made up of
over 7,600 different islands?
7,600 islands. Oh my gosh. Amazing.
Okay. Dust this.
All right, so I'm gonna
shape all the plain ones
and then we'll come back with the ube.
We're gonna do a similar thing
when it comes to shaping these.
We'll take the dough, stretch it,
and then we're gonna put
a piece of cheese inside.
So I'm using piece of bright
orange Velveeta cheese.
You want something that
can melt in nicely,
and pinch that inside.
(rock music)
Twist it together and dust
them with the bread crumbs.
So there are other versions
of the ube pandesal
that include a little bit of ube jam.
Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find any.
But I think that would
be so delicious as well.
When I buy loaves of bread,
I like to save the ends.
And then after I get a bunch of the ends,
I grind them up to make fresh bread crumbs
and I use them to bread chicken and stuff.
And I store them in my
freezer -- the breadcrumbs.
And then I always have
fresh bread crumbs on hand.
We're gonna cover these in plastic
and let them have their second rise,
which should take about
30 minutes, 45 minutes
until they're nice and poofy.
And then we're gonna place them
into preheated 180 degrees centigrade,
around 350 degrees Fahrenheit oven
and bake them for 18 to 20 minutes.
And then we should have beautiful pandesal
to eat and to eat and eat.
All right, my beautiful
lovelies, look at this.
My pandesal have just
come out of the oven.
They look beautiful.
I wish you could smell
them. It smells so good.
I love the smell of freshly baked bread.
It's just so inviting.
It just makes you hungry
even when you're not.
(soft rock music)
Lets eat this. They look so great.
I know you're supposed
to allow bread to cool
once you take it out of the oven,
but I mean, how can you
resist? How can you resist?
I can't. I'm gonna grab
this one right here.
So stinking cute.
Oh my gosh! Yes.
(dance music continues)
Ooh! Looks great. Look at that.
Beautiful. It's got a
slight yellow color to it
because it has egg and butter in it.
Oh my gosh. And it's got this crispy top.
This looks amazing.
Okay, here we go. Itadakimasu!
(slow dance music)
Freshly baked bread is so good.
I have to say that's one of
the positives of this pandemic
is that I've done a lot of
baking this year -- a lot.
And I've come to appreciate
bread baking even more.
And the way it fills up your house
with such a beautiful smell.
(chews loudly)
Warm and tender, slightly sweet enriched.
The top has a really nice
toasted like little crunch to it,
slightly crackly, but then
you've got the breadcrumbs on top
which give you an extra little
bit of crunch and toastiness.
So lovely.
The crumb is light and fluffy,
and it reminds me a little
bit of Hawaiian bread,
which was inspired by Portuguese bread,
which this bread was inspired by it too.
So not surprising.
They're not as sweet as Hawaiian bread,
but similar kind of enrich
flavor and billowy texture.
So good.
Already, let's go ahead and
taste one of the ube ones.
I can't wait to open one of these.
These are filled with cheese.
That, yeah. Look at that color contrast.
All right, let's give that one a go.
Too hot.
That's good.
The cheese is salty and oozy.
And the bright purple bread
has a slight nutty sweet flavor to it
because we added that ube flavoring.
I'm sure if I had some ube jam,
it would punch up the
ube flavor even more.
But that combination of
slightly sweet and salty
is delicious.
That Velveeta cheese
works really well in here.
Not only as a color, but as a flavor too.
It's salty and rich, but
that richness kind off
is echoed in the richness
of the bread itself.
Lovely.
So soft and tender.
And then I love the
little breadcrumbs on top.
They add a little added sandy
crunch to the top. Delicious.
(humming)
Pandesal, two different ways.
We have the beautiful ube cheese
and the good old pandesal plain.
Absolutely delicious, and
relatively easy to make,
as all bread making generally is.
It's just a matter of planning.
You have to plan for the two rises.
You mix the ingredients, make
sure you knead it enough.
Bake it and you've got bread.
Thank you all once again for joining me.
I hope you enjoyed that one.
I hope you learned something.
