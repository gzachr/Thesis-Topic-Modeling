hi everyone my name is kim and i'm a
filipina living in slovakia and today
we're going to be talking about the
things that you should never ever do
or say when you are in slovakia so if
you're interested watch until the end
because you're gonna learn a lot of cool
stuff about slovakia as usual
these are purely based on my experiences
after living for
one year here in slovakia and as well as
the reactions that i get from my husband
whenever i try to trigger him
with these topics
[Music]
this is the first because this is like
the major one and i have learned it the
hard way
i once met a group of girls whom towards
lovax
then i started this topic and i got a
lengthy
argument why slovakia should be a
central
europe not eastern europe it has been
long debated whether slovakia should be
part of
eastern europe or central europe however
for slovaks especially the young ones i
think they don't really want to be
referred
as eastern europe as a foreigner you may
ask why well i think because being an
eastern european country
has a lot of negative connotations
because of the association it has
with soviet union and maybe the country
russia that is why looking at the
history one might say
that slovakia is part of the eastern
europe however geography wise it's
considered as central europe which
actually makes sense because if you look
at the map it's in the
center of the continent and even if you
ask wikipedia you can see there that
it's part of central europe i know i
have a lot of slovak viewers too so guys
let me know what you think about this
i would really appreciate to know your
opinion about this topic leave it a
comment below
[Music]
i know a lot of foreigners may have this
idea just because of the history of
soviet union however
be really careful when talking with
slovaks and associate their country
with russia well because truly it's an
independent country now
and it's a long way from russia to be
honest
i'm still curious what do russians
thinks about slovaks and what do slovaks
thinks about russians i'm not aware
of the full history of slovakia and
russia and that is something i'm really
curious about
hungary and slovakia are neighboring
countries and
also have a very colorful history at one
point in the history slovakia was part
of hungarian kingdom and as far as i
know bratislava once
served as the hungarian capital during
turkish invasion
however of course tensions aroused
between slovaks
and hungarians in terms of their
politics economics and culture
during this time slovak culture and
language was
actively suppressed in terms of the
hungarians
so as a natural response slovaks doesn't
want to be referred as part of the
hungary
although because of their long history
there are still hungarian minorities
living here in slovakia
but they are in the part of the border
with hungary
[Music]
yes though their names and vlogs looks
and sounds
very similar they are entirely different
countries
i was guilty of this one too i thought
that they were the same as well before
but
no i remember before when i was in the
philippines i was filling up some forms
and i put slovenia instead of slovakia i
actually read it before that
sometimes they mistakenly send males to
slovenia instead of slovakia and then
vice versa
they are both small countries in europe
but they are both
very very beautiful i hope i get to
visit slovenia someday as well
[Music]
czech and slovakia used to be one
country before but they have split
already now slovakia is one independent
country
they split on january 1 2003
which they call as the velvet revolution
which
followed the velvet divorce so they say
this is good to know because if you are
visiting slovakia and you decided to
post in your social media you wouldn't
look funny because you would say you are
in chica slovakia
because well it doesn't exist anymore
i think this is a silent rule in slovak
custom when you are visiting someone's
house
try to bring something when you are
visiting like a bottle of wine
chocolates or something sweet i am not
sure up to what extent is this expected
here in slovakia
but so far i am told this way this is
not very common in the philippines
so when my husband and i are still
living in the philippines so i have
some families or friends coming over to
our house and he always notices
how people don't bring him something
until my brother decided to bring him
bunch of bananas and he was so happy
[Music]
slovaks may be cold but they are very
generous when they take you in
when you visit the slovak house they may
offer you a welcoming drink or food
some are enthusiastic to offer you their
home
cooked meals or maybe sometimes they are
this homemade
alcohol spirits that they want you to
try
and as a sign of courtesy just accept it
and try it because if you don't
they can get easily offended so even if
you're vegan and you are offered a
homemade claw basket just taste it
you'll be surprised how it tastes so
good
i noticed that veganism is still not
widely known here in slovakia and not
practiced
by a lot of people especially those who
are in the villages
my husband is a slovak and he became
vegan
after living in abroad for quite a while
and then he came back to slovakia
and he started telling people that he's
vegan and doesn't eat goulash anymore
and people were like
what and then he said i eat hummus
and they were like what is hummus
[Music]
oh this is very important now i am more
conscious when looking
people in their eyes when i am cheering
this is also true when you are shaking
somebody's hands when you met them in
the first time you have to look them in
the
eyes and your handshake should be firm i
think this is most common in western
countries but for asia
or at least in the philippines as far as
i know this is not a big issue plus
bowing your head like this
is a more common greetings in the
philippines than handshakes so if you
come here and meet slovaks
shake their hands as firm as you can
this is a common courtesy here in
slovakia
in the philippines you are actually not
expected to remove your shoes when
you're visiting somebody's home
actually they would ask you to keep your
shoes on
because they may be conscious that
their floor are dusty also it's not
common
in the philippines to offer people or
visitors home
shoes unlike here in slovakia whenever i
visit the slovak
i am always offered a home shoes so
if you are visiting a slovak house as
well
just make sure to take off your shoes
also i'm not sure for other countries
but i've seen a lot of american movies
wherein they always wear shoes even
inside the house
and even sometimes they are on the bed
they have shoes on
i am not sure if it is actually a
cultural thing in america
or its just in movies let me know in the
comments below
czechs and slovaks are like competing
brothers you know
so if you go to the pub and you see
people
watching maybe football or ice hockeys
never ever say that checks are so good
and that they are better than slovaks
i think this also holds true when you
are in shape you will just offend them
especially do not do this if you are
having a beer
with a slow fact i only say this when i
want to piss off my husband
and he's watching sports on tv maybe ice
hockey or football
and 101 it gets to his head
[Music]
and as a bonus although i'm not sure up
to what extent
this is true here in slovakia but never
ever open a fridge of someone's house
unless you have a permission to do so i
think
it all depends on what kind of
relationship you have
with the person that you're visiting i
remember back then when
my husband and i are still living in the
philippines
and i have some friends who come over to
our house
for us it's kind of normal if the
visitor wants to open our fridge or
maybe kitchen cabinet if they need
something
and it's not a big issue but for my
slovak husband he was like
what is he doing why is he opening our
fridge
so it's like that another thing that is
very unique for me
here in slovakia is the rule of giving
flowers
they say that don't give an even number
of flowers in a bouquet
because it's offensive i'm not sure why
fortunately
i didn't have to give any flowers to any
slovaks i only received them
alright that's it for me today guys i
hope that this video helps you
if you are coming here in slovakia as
well in the future

if you're slovak and watching this video
