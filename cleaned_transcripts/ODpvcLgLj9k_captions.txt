hi guys here is my five tips for when you
are going to be dating a Filipino I'm actually
married myself to a Filipino in October 2016
so I know a little bit about this if I knew
these tips before dating my partner this would
of helped me out a little bit and I hope these
tips help you out to.
number one when you are dating a Filipino
if you are actually serious about this and
you want to go through with it they might
be a potential person you want to marry or
spend the rest of your life with you are going
to be marrying her family and you are also
going to be marrying into the community to
where she grew up to as well with Filipinos
its a little different to white people with
white people you have a next door neighbour
our you have a uncle or aunty you don't really
know them you meet them at Christmas and that's
about it with Filipinos they are really close
to their family and the community is really
important if someone is in trouble in the
Philippines they get together and help each
other out if someone is in trouble in Australia
they either take out a loan or get a credit
card there are two big differences so you
need to get used to the idea of helping out
family if they are in trouble and that's a
part of what you need to do the same thing
in white culture as well if your family is
in trouble you and your partner need to get
some money and help them out to and try to
put that in perspective so number two this
is important and this is probably one of the
most important tips I can give you there is
a thing called tampo sorry if I didn't say
that right for any Filipinos out there but
tampo is when your partner gets really angry
about something it can be something really
big or minor it really doesn't matter what
it is so she gets really upset and she just
doesn't talk to you so she just shuts downs
and doesn't talk to you from all of these
videos I have seen online your partner can
be quiet for a day, week and hours personally
for me it has been hours so you need to understand
they are just trying to cool down because
they get really angry so in comparison to
white culture or Weston culture if your partner
is angry they will let you know if they are
pissed off they are going to tell you about
it and they are going to get it off their
chest and your going to be in the dog house
for ages but I would say the tampo way is
a lot worse because you sit their and say
what have I done and you actually don't know
for a couple of hours at least so you need
to just sit in there hang in there, talk to
your partner, reassure your partner that you
love them you are going to be with them and
you are just going to work things out and
slowly and slowly they are going to open up
and give you some hints on what the problem
is and once you find out what the problem
is you can address it as well so just hold
in there it happens to every guy that dates
a Filipino so it might be a shock for you
to find out about it but its good you are
watching this video to understand about it
and just work though it you will be fine hold
in there it will be fine my third tip tagalog
so that's the national language of the Philippines
make a effort to learn tagalog make a effort
to talk to your partner about tagalog what
does this mean what does that mean how you
can add words together how you can count to
ten they will really appreciate the time and
the effort to learn about their language and
for me and Ange it has been really good when
we walk away we go somewhere we can talk in
a few broken words in tagalog that I know
and just say look over there or lets cross
the road things like that bring you closer
together that you are trying to learn your
partners language you are trying to connect
with them on a close level and when you go
meet their family you might know a few different
words and its showing you are actually trying
to engage with them instead of knowing your
words they might know a little bit of broken
English you can't really connect but if you
know a few little words you can try to make
that connection with them and in my experience
personally they really connect with that because
they say this person trying to engage with
us they are trying to learn our language they
are actually putting in the effort so just
try to do that when you meet your partner
just say what is that is it an apple mansanas
just ask them random things in their language
and you will connect with them a lot quicker
so moving onto number four my fourth tip is
to learn about your partners experience in
the Philippines now you and your partner have
completely different backgrounds and that's
fine they went to Australia or where ever
across the world wherever you met your partner
just try to find out what it was like to live
in the Philippines and what that will do is
put you in their shoes and its very important
for you to understand this because not everything
is in your way or the westerners way in my
perspective things happen differently there
in the Philippines so you really got to delve
in and ask them as many questions as you possibly
can to really understand what it is like to
live in the Philippines and that will give
you an appreciation how to handle issues that
come along the way in your relationship and
its a good idea to understand what the culture
is like as well so you can blend in what religion
is over there and how important it is number
5 your going to be taking out your Filipino
out on a date do not take her out for a burger
no nooooooo do not take her out for a burger
it is not happening it is not happening there
is one word that you need to know when you
are taking out a Filipino for your first date
or multiple dates thereafter Rice easy as
that rice you got to understand rice of kanin
in tagalog is important so white people love
bread right white people love bread I'm going
to have a hamburger or a croissant they don't
get down like that the Filipinos don't get
down like that they like rice they have rice
for breakfast lunch and dinner and if they
don't eat rice if it is a Filipino that has
just come down from the Philippines and they
are not used to western culture their is no
point taking them out for a burger there is
no point taking them out for a salad they
think salad is like grass on a field so if
you take your partner out to sumo salad or
what ever like that and you give them a bowl
of grass imagine that sitting there getting
a bowl of grass so remember rice take them
to a place with rice you will be in good stead
trust me trust me on that so these are my
five tips guys and I have got one more finial
tip and this is personally the best tip I
can give you when you data a Filipino its
important to give them a chance now what I
mean by give them a chance is you hear a lot
of horror stories either through the media
or the interest or stupid YouTube articles
now horror stories can be its a older gentleman
and a younger Filipino in a romance scam now
what I want to let you know is just don't
listen to that bullshi and sorry for swearing
but it is it is bullshi give your partner
a chance and don't care about stories listen
to what they have got to say listen to their
experiences and that is the only way you can
do it you will be really happy if you can
push through that you really will I'm happily
married quite recently happily marred and
I have been with my partner for about five
years now and we spend so much time together
and I love her so much so just don't give
up to stupid stories that you hear 99.9% of
Filipinos out there are absolutely amazing
people and you got to give them a chance you
got to listen to them and you got to learn
to you got to be open to a lot of different
things culture religion language and you got
to try so hope you guys enjoyed the video
