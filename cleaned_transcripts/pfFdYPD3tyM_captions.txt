Baguio is about four hours drive from
Manila will family be there just for a
two-day trip and hopefully I can
showcase some of the beautiful sceneries
nice
in there
never been this video
we're just stopping by Starbucks to get
some coffee breakfast we're gonna go
straight there so it's about four hours
130 135 kilometers from the city from
Manila so yeah we'll see how we go
yes of stopping by stopping by Starbucks
then grab some breakfast in here
summer has heading to Baguio which is
about 125 kilometers from my lab driving
there for about 4 hours haven't been in
today for about 20 years now
and
that would change them
videos photos in there my microphone is
at the car so they hear a lot of noise
in there
video footage cut from that it's been
very great the looks the last couple of
days ever since I arrived here all I've
been doing is state and eat and eat and
I've really been vlogging or doing any
content for in the video so apologies
for that so I have really been
publishing some of my videos as well
just catch up with some family some of
my relatives extended relatives here
Tennessee my sister I would say my
sister but long
my brother's a quick update for me so I
gotta go and I'll see you see all of it
later
just noting by the
we took it
constructions happening in here actually
it's about three floors
see it's pretty big
trying to clean up my camera anyway
very nice pretty happy with the
accommodation we just got here it just
checked it in too dark too dark we're
gonna rest here for a couple of hours
and then we're gonna wander around
Baguio City so yeah peace I'll see you
in a couple of hours
- flume I'll Drive for a couple minutes
fortunately started to rain but
hopefully the drone shots are good
enough just to showcase some of the
sceneries here and then I took a nap
then I woke up man it was freezing
now I had to show I'm just very
showering and now I'm wearing a jacket
it's cool it's alright in the south
there may be about 15 to 17 degrees and
yeah we can head off for dinner soon so
stay put and I'll see you all a little
bit
it gets dark really early here like
about 5:00
it was dark I was raining a little bit
talking in the video and we will one
foot in there not much to see as well
because most of the shops are closed
today
unfortunately so this is the only place
I can go and shoot some some footage so
you could say the night market here it's
not as the same as Taiwan but it's
massive there's a lot of cheap stuff in
there I don't know with it whether
they're real or fake probably fake and
still see some fake eases in there and
yeah hopefully this gives you an idea
where what value is particularly in this
area
so hopefully tomorrow I'll be able to
shoot a few more places so yeah for
Manila
it was pretty warm and then here it's
cold so I'm time to get sick in here
both of them true but anyways nothing
really much for me I'm gonna head back
home and sleep
we popping some medicine anyways until
next time I'll see you on my next video
