hi everyone welcome to my channel if
you're new here my name is kim and i'm a
filipina living in slovakia and all my
videos in this channel is all about my
life living in this beautiful country as
a foreigner
so today in this video i decided to talk
about homesickness so come sit with me
while i show you how to make my favorite
bulalo dish it's a filipina dish that i
really miss
now that i'm living here in slovakia
while i talk about my experience if i
ever get homesick in slovakia
i get a lot of questions whether i miss
my home country or do i feel
an extreme sadness living abroad also i
get a lot of message from you guys
especially the foreigners that they i
they are admiring me so much because i
was able to adopt in my new life here in
slovakia while
they are struggling on their own but to
be honest that is not always the case
many times i feel sadness as well just
because i miss my family and my friends
in the philippines a lot but it only
lasts for a very short time i believe
homesickness is very subjective what i
feel or experience may totally be
different to what you feel or experience
i don't think that there is a general
meaning of what is homesickness is or
how do you cope up with it or how do you
get out of it or how long do you feel
until you get out of it i know some
friends who went abroad and really felt
extreme anxiety just because they are so
away from home and they couldn't wait to
go back
i can say fortunately that for me it's
not the case although time to time i
feel lonely as well especially nowadays
the travel is so restricted so even if i
want to visit my family in the
philippines i cannot
do so but the feeling of loneliness is
fleeting for me and today in this video
i want to share with you how i do it
when i feel lonely what i do is i
indulge myself with it i don't deny the
feeling i acknowledge it and i
feel it
if one day i don't want to get out of
the bed i just stay there for as long as
i want or as my mind and body wants
if my tears want to fall i just let it
be feeling lonely is part of us as being
human and by acknowledging it that it's
normal to feel that way it is so much
easier for me to snap out of it
of course you may say that it's easier
than done i know a lot of people who
fell into depression because of it but
for me allowing yourself to feel lonely
for very long time has also something to
do with attachment i believe that we
feel homesick because we are too
attached we are attached to our family
our friends our dogs our cats our homes
our hobbies back home you know anything
that feels comfortable and then you move
to another country and suddenly things
are so different take it from me when i
move here in slovakia i am so afraid of
going outside
i am always cold always sick and i'm
afraid to make friends but that is all
because i am so attached to the idea of
home when i stop thinking that
philippines is only my home
then i opened my eyes to a lot more
possibilities i started meeting people
locals foreigners i attended gatherings
and meetings of groups unfortunately
during that time corona happened as well
so now i'm stuck but the point is if you
start letting go of your comfort and let
yourself explore more
then you realize that living in a new
country is not really so difficult be
open don't limit yourself and stop
attaching yourself to the things that
are so comfortable it will help you a
lot to not fall to that cycle of
loneliness and extreme depression
remember you are only alone if you
choose to be alone even in a new country
every day is an opportunity to meet
someone new and make friends
now because of the pandemic i have more
time for myself so i was able to keep up
on my old hobbies when i was in the
philippines i liked sewing a lot so when
i came here i
started doing it again it gives me a
sense of normalcy because i started
doing something that i used to do back
home but at the same time i picked up a
new hobbies as well you guys know that i
have a garden a huge one
i love planting
harvesting eating my fruits and
vegetables storing them for the winter
which is so so exciting we also bought
an old house which kept us busy time to
time because we start
some project like painting the hallways
the walls the doors or renovating an old
furniture like tables and chairs which
is enjoyable then i get to paint vases
that i like and arrange flowers for you
guys which turn into a business as well
the bottom line is i think it's very
important to keep yourself busy do
something that you love to do maybe it's
an old hobby or a new one it could even
open up doors for you to meet new people
with the same interest as you it is so
important that you build a routine for
yourself maybe you like to exercise or
cook or maybe something else and
speaking of which exercise helps you a
lot keeping your body and your mind
active all the time will help you to
snap out of loneliness so easy time to
time i like to do yoga
but i used to do hardcore exercise
before but now i'm so lazy to do it i am
still motivating myself to do it again
but now
i'm still enjoying yoga so until then
i gotta do yoga point is you don't have
to be professional work at your own pace
enjoy how it goes and see where it leads
you homesickness also results from
confusion or maybe you don't understand
what is happening around you it could
even be more difficult if you move in a
country where you don't speak the
language i am so lucky because even
though slovakia has its own language
my husband is a citizen so i get a lot
of assistance from him but of course i
understand that for some people
this might not be the case maybe you
move to another country without knowing
anybody even one person which if you do
i really admire you for doing so because
you are so brave
i highly advise that you learn
at least the basic of the language in
that country because you know it will
help you a lot and
just a simple greeting in their language
will take you a long long way but of
course at the same time don't feel too
frustrated
if the language is too difficult to
learn i feel that a lot moving to a new
country is not so easy and adapting to
your new life is not a walk in a park i
hope that this small steps or tips help
you to overcome homesickness or maybe
you are moving to a new country i hope
that this video helps you to get
prepared and give you an idea of what to
expect when you move to another country
if you are in the same food as me let me
know in the comments below what are your
experiences in overcoming homesickness
maybe you will also be able to help
other people who are in the same
situation like us
let's try the soup
um
will not agree that i'm using the spoon
to cut the beef
but that's how it is in the philippines
guys
no knife
and then normally you like to eat it
with a fish sauce
with a lot of chili
and calamansi
but i don't have fish sauce right now
so this sauce that i have is a
combination of
my
garlic and chili sauce with
vinegar and soy sauce
let's try
[Music]
just like home so tell me if it's weird
for you guys that i am eating rice with
the soup
that's how it is in the philippines
if you like the recipe i'll leave it in
the description below it's bone marrow
inside
i was told that here in slovakia you
actually use it as a spread on your
bread i never tried before
maybe someday i will try
good luck to your blood pressure

the philippines i hope that you like the
recipe and if you want to try it i'll
