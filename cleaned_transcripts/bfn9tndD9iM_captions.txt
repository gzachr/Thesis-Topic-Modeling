for the sasawan i'll be using 
a little bit of suka pinakurat
that was a really nice tennis game that we 
enjoyed now we're gonna go to a restaurant  
where they have mexican food
set up spare ribs i already ate the steak  
and chicken or the pork i ate 
the pork this is the chicken
food's really nice you know what 
these are just onion onion rings
look at the goat guys
look at this one he's so cute hello
pogi we are back home hello there  
hello pogi today i will be trying my second 
filipino budget meal this meal is gonna be very  
exciting because i will also make instant 
coffee ice cream and for the ice cream i  
will only use a few simple ingredients i will 
start with 200 grams of sweetened condensed milk
we'll be mixing in the same 
amount of cream okay this is a 35  
fat cream we'll just add those together then 
we will be mixing this on a low setting first
can be a little bit faster but not too fast okay 
after it has thickened a little bit you can add  
your favorite filipino alcohol okay so you can 
add a rum or a whiskey or even some coconut wine  
for for example something strong better something 
strong but only one tablespoon okay so i'll be uh  
adding one tablespoon of whiskey again it doesn't 
need to be expensive so just one tablespoon  
this will make a big difference now we will 
also add two tablespoons of instant coffee okay  
i like a little bit stronger
so i mixed this uh until it thickened a little 
bit and the coffee is disappearing you see the  
instant coffee but there's still a little bit 
instant coffee there which is nice it will  
give it a nice crunch we'll be just adding this 
here and we're going to put this in the freezer  
we'll put this in the freezer for a couple 
of hours okay now let's make tortang sardinas  
i'll take like three sardinas out first okay 
and we'll set this aside on a piece of paper  
i'm chopping uh one onion and half a courgette 
i'll make sure to chop both very fine
first the onion next the courgette i think carrot 
would be nice too of course and also spring onions  
but today i don't have those so i'll just try 
using this courgette and it is also a cheap  
vegetable you know the courgette is not expensive 
so i'll be adding one tablespoon of cooking oil  
i'm adding the mixture the onions and courgette  
last time i made my first uh filipino budget 
meal palabok in center parcs so if you didn't  
watch the video i'll put the link for you in 
the description okay so it was below 70 pesos  
and i'm really curious to how low today we can 
go with this budget meal we have to see i have  
no idea actually how expensive it's gonna 
be but we'll see at the end of the video  
i removed most of the oil the excess oil from 
the sardines two cans i'll try two cans today
and just mash it up a little 
bit making it a little bit flaky
courgette mixture goes in
we'll add three eggs
tatlong itlog
we adding a bit of paminta asin
then mix everything with the fork and 
we'll just fry them in the same oil  
let's try to flip them over
yummy
maybe nice with some suka and 
sili diba and rice of course
wow
so was able to make nine pieces out of it so 
that's really nice yummy for the sawsawan i'll  
be using a little bit of suka pinakurat 
okay with some extra green sili must be  
sobrang maanghang no of course we're gonna serve 
this with rice but i will be trying a little bit

this with rice and then we will go to the  
theaters we're going to watch a movie and when

let's have a look at the ice cream
so i heated up the spoon a little bit under 
the tap water oh that looks really good see
that is a nice ice cream 
so you can see the texture  
it really looks like ice cream diba and so simple  
very simple with a few ingredients i will put the 
price down below okay you can see how expensive  
this ice cream is but i don't think it's really 
expensive so this is a coffee flavor ice cream
