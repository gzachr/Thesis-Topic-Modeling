bet all right all right but here it goes guys

we're gonna switch this game up we're gonna  
switch this game up and she my wife is actually 
going to try to food herself i want her to try to  
i always have to try it and and be the one 
doing everything so you tell me how do it taste  
and everything let's let's hit it up let's see 
let's see let's see let's see let you know uh huh  
you know so let's get down up in there let's see 
can cut a piece just cut a piece of that yeah  
get a piece of that yeah go ahead on let's see 
see how it come out close up close up close up
did i get it the flavor i'm telling you i'm 
telling you about these those are narrow seeds  
put the flavor because i based it i kept pasting 
it i it like six times you know what i mean so  
you know it came out perfect let's just go back 
down let's go look at it give me a nice little  
nice little piece let me see look at it look 
at it good that looks good well it's done yeah  
yes this this looks good so yeah  
nice nice nice [ __ ] look at the close-up 
oh my god and look at close up in my um
i like those you know some i'm glad you're 
enjoying it so hey hey try my pasta my faucet  
you know i know you know everything else is 
still starting to show i know the quantity  
ends the start of the show but you know we did a 
little something with a twist to it to make it you  
know make it pop you know we wanted to go all the 
way in so you tell me on the flavors let me see  
what do you think because you know some i didn't 
go heavy guys the deal is i didn't want to go  
heavy you know with the flavors for the pasta 
because i didn't want to take away i didn't want  
to take away from all the flavors we put with 
the cornish hand you know what i mean in the  
salt i didn't want to take away from that so we 
basically use a light you know wine sauce butter  
wine sauce garlic butter wine sauce that's all 
it is you know so i don't want to be light with  
it and it goes good with the you know the lemon 
and i mean the lime it goes good with all that so  
all the flavors we put in there the soy you know 
a little bit of the brown sugar we added to it  
so it actually goes good with it so yeah so i 
mean i'm happy are you happy with it i'm i love it  
all right good i gotta go over there and try 
myself actually so you get back around here  
don't be trying to eat it all up you know i gotta 
go try myself and and see how it tastes you know  
so let's let's let's just trade up again go around 
here you know let me try and and do do do do let's  
see if i did adjust it with it justice so no it 
looks good looks real good damn flavor let me  
see let me check it out wow i mean it's better 
than i know it's better than that one ahead uh  
check it out right right guys 
look at that look at that
the ginger the lemongrass bringing it out then 
it hits you with that that the lime hits you bam  
you know what i mean the lime and the lemon seeds 
oh man that makes it when you baste it with that  
then like this it do something make sure make 
it make it move move move it is this is popping  
it's popping oh my god it does a lot to it 
and every everything is just everything's just  
going together even the pasta goes with it and 
i was you know i took a chance with the pasta i  
didn't be honest with you i took a chance with the 
pasta because i didn't think it would go with it  
but i said well maybe i try and i do a light sauce 
with it and see if it goes oh no no it's it's  
perfect because you can squeeze the lime over the 
pasta and just give it that boom because normally  
i put lemon juice over the pasta when i make 
this pasta but you're not squeezing lime over it  
same flavor same thing same thing so yeah i'm 
gonna eat my mouthful if you like this guys
