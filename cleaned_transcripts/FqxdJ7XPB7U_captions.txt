all right we are back at the airport because today 
I'm starting my journey all around the Philippines  
for the next two months I think 
I'm going to travel all around  
and today oh so somebody else forgot his bag yeah 
oh that's very funny how can you forget such a  
big deck in the taxi okay thank you very much okay 
have a good day bye-bye all right yeah we're going  
through one of the most beautiful islands in the 
Philippines today so I'm very excited for that it  
is early afternoon now I hope I can make it to the 
island for sunset today that would be very nice to  
have a sunset already today on the first day so 
yeah feel free to join me body thank you okay  
this is the domestic terminal so it's actually 
very small but still a long waiting line to enter
all right 12.2 kilo yeah still traveling light 
okay so I go over there right okay thank you  
very much all right check in complete it and I'm 
very good in time although the waiting time here  
was actually quite long I think like 25 minutes 
but I still have over one hour time so all good  
but all right this is the boarding area so yeah 
it's a very small domestic terminal here I think  
they only have three or four Gates over there 
so have an hour to kill here now and then we're  
going on the on my first domestic journey 
in the Philippines I'm very excited today
hello it's time to board the flight I 
think it's a very short flight I think  
it's like 40 45 minutes only so uh yeah 
today only very short and easy flight
foreign
videos before you know I like to have exits it 
because I am a tour guy so I always appreciate  
the extra next space that I have here and 
often the exit seats are not booked so many  
times I'm actually the only person sitting here 
so that's of course all these very convenient
all right if the boarding is completed 
I'm having the whole world to myself the  
captain just announced that 
it's indeed only a 45 minute  
flight the weather is nice okay wow I'm 
really looking forward to this let's go
hi thank you thank you very much all right we have 
arrived on a island not on the island where we  
want to end up today so I have to get to the ferry 
terminal now and then we take a short film ride to  
our final destination and yet the flying time was 
about 40 minutes now so very easy and smooth and  
now we have about two hours left until sunset 
time if the weather is nice so far so I think  
we will be able to see a beautiful sunset already 
today all right so we have different counters here  
which are yeah selling transportation to the 
fairy Pier the ferry and then to your hotel  
on the island but I did my research before 
and the price here for foreign tours is 1  
000 pesos and I read online that you can 
actually do it for less than half the price  
if you organize it by yourself and don't go with 
these two operators how much is the tricycle here  
to the ferry right okay then I would 
like to get a tricycle this one
it's 75 right okay where can I get my bag I need 
my bag first yeah right over here okay thank you  
all right so I'm going with a 
tricycle which is only 75 pesos  
and then yeah I have to pay for it here we will 
see later I'm sure it will be cheaper than 1  
000 pesos but yeah we will see but 
first I need to wait for my luggage
back secure let's get to the tricycle make 
it to the ferry get the Perry make it to the  
island to my hotel and then to the beach 
for Sunset sounds like a good plan right
seems to be very organized here 
the tricycle outside okay thank you  
okay so you can either book the 1000 Pesos 
all-inclusive package you can also take just a van  
out here or you can take a tricycle to the to the 
pier so you have several different options here
oh yeah I see some tricycles over there  
perfect and I think the pier is only a short 
five minute ride array police gets what I saw  
on Google Maps hello this one just one yeah this 
is the 150 just one only so let's go into four  
you want a 75 just with another one person 
175. 75 is only for for two persons yes okay
somebody here wants to share a tricycle 
yes oh you're all together ma'am
oh then I pay 150 okay okay
so if you're doing alone you have to trade a ball
oon
okay so this is actually interesting so if you are 
only one person you need to pay double the price
and maybe oh I think I I get it now it's 
150 per ride and usually it's two persons  
and then it's 70 50 each I think that's how 
it works then yeah it makes sense actually  
how far is it how many minutes
oh we have the ocean here 
already it looks very inviting  
ah yeah traveling around Islands that's what you
travel to this can be
all right I think we have arrived well it was 
only like five minutes now so very short and  
easy actually and yeah let's hope the next area 
is leaving soon okay thank you very much all right
okay have a good day bye
I don't have fever I'm allowed to enter the 
ferry terminal great news Well it smells  
good in here there's an amazing smell 
on here some fresh lemon or lime smell
which you can get online to enter the island 
ID vaccination and your water cooking otherwise  
you are not allowed to enter the island so 
they check it here and then over there the  
other counter we also have to Tire pay a fee 
environmental fee and a terminal fee Windows  
7 okay so much okay I got the receipt now so 
you have to pay the environmental fee and the  
terminal fee is this including the boat ticket 
the boat ticket this is not including the boat  
so outside I buy the boat tickets okay and so 
400 for foreigners and for local tours it's 250.
the name of the island we are going 
through yet we're going to Boracay  
which is here one of the most popular 
Islands in all of the Philippines hello
one person um I forgot the name of my 
board again it's written on the MB prints  
um okay where's my boat
oh this is oh there's a shaking 
here oh this is not easy to walk  
here especially when you also carry your 
bag luckily my back is a smaller light  
can't recommend this with a 
heavy and thicker luggage foreign
thank you very much so much
okay my seat number is 40. 
let's have a look inside
or you can also if you want you can 
so now you don't have to stand up
that was indeed a very short 
ride five minutes or so  
and oh we have beautiful white sand here already 
unfortunately it's getting a little bit cloudy  
I hope the cloud will disappear in the next 
hour all right so let's see how I can get to  
my hotel the island is very small I think you 
can get it all around the island within like  
half an hour or so so it shouldn't be uh 
that far and expensive to get to the hotel
yeah you have tricycles
okay have a good day
you know yeah how much 150 
150 yeah is this electric yes  
oh you only have electric here on the island
right okay um so that means my total 
price now from the airport to my hotel is  
um let me calculate I paid 150 for the 
tricycle 150 here that's 300 400 for  
the for the Feast at 750 for the boat ride so 
that's 750 in total so that means I saved 250  
um yeah instead of taking the the two operator 
all-inclusive package so 250 in savings is it  
worth that I don't know you have to decide for 
yourself if you're really traveling on a budget  
and probably it is but if you just want to 
travel carefully free and don't organize  
anything then yeah maybe 250 extra isn't that 
big of a deal anyway we are on the island now  
so let's get some very first impressions 
yeah I'm going to stay here for a few days  
so there will be a few videos from this island 
probably we're going to explore all around see  
what this place has to offer spend some time 
at the beach maybe do some some boat rides  
oh I'm so excited to be here haven't 
been on the on a proper Island in a while
all right she's my hotel uh seems to 
be in a little side Elite I already  
saw a shop over there selling a 
fruit shakes which is awesome for  
my breakfast I love to have fresh 
shakes in the morning okay uh 150
okay thank you very much have a good day
all right for the right yes now 
maybe around 10 minutes not that long  
so hello good afternoon is this the right 
Hotel yeah right okay because I didn't see  
a sign outside so I wasn't 100 sure okay 
check it out I gotta welcome drink here  
this is probably is it iced tea it's too oh 
exactly what I need now cold beverage after  
the it wasn't really long journey to get here in 
total I left my hotel in Manila five hours ago so

the tool is on the fifth floor 
yes okay okay thank you very much
Wi-Fi is seven five eight eight okay and your bath 
towel sir is here here's it thank you very much
all right so let's make a quick Moon tour so 
this is my hotel room here and let's check  
out if I do have a view normally when you 
come to hotel rooms and the curtains are  
closed that normally means that there is 
no view let's see if I'm right or not yeah
oh no oh no Do You Hear What I am hearing oh no 
it's raining check it out oh damage that means  
the sunset is probably ruined um anyway I don't 
let that ruin my mood maybe this will be just a  
quick shower then one hour we will have the most 
beautiful sunset I ever had so oh check this out  
welcome to Boracay Mr Ken Dasha and Company I 
don't have company please enjoy your staycation  
and make yourself at home that sounds very nice 
so I have a little Kettle here coffee facilities  
all right little closet that's open like this safe 
all right a desk which is always important for me  
because yeah I need to do a lot of work as well 
editing behind the scenes work so I always need  
a desk in my room let's check out the bathroom 
oh a huge shower here check it out oh and nice  
really huge shower hatch really nice actually 
it's not that tall I can even touch it with my  
uh with my head all right so what do I trade here 
now actually I'm not 100 sure let me check again  
what the price I know what I pay in 
total but the price per night here was um
1650 pesos per night so almost 30 US dollar
all right the rain has stopped but yet 
still very cloudy and I feel like it could  
rain again any minute but yeah it's always 
very important that you don't let something  
like this ruin your mood ruin your day you 
can't change the weather so why waste your  
time complaining about it so we're still 
having an amazing evening here I think
so let's head over to the beach and see what's 
going on there maybe we can uh get a get a quick  
meal in actually only a little bit hungry but 
we have a great option oh some chickens here  
yeah if there's a great option of food then why 
not and this is by the way the place I saw earlier  
breakfast shakes so maybe I 
check it out in the morning okay
there's some some food places here
so according to Google Maps the beach 
is just a short walk away over there
something on the grill here
oh yeah Island Vibes are always a little 
bit different right if you have been to  
these islands before anywhere in Southeast 
Asia you know the Vibes are always a little  
bit different compared to the mainland 
although well technically every place in  
the Philippines is an island but uh 
I'm sure you know what I mean right
all right I can see the ocean over there and 
as I am approaching I get sprinkles on my face  
it's starting to rain again but yeah are you 
ready to see one of the most beautiful beaches  
in the Philippines and probably also in the 
whole world check it out hello hello hello
yeah so of course this is the full beauty of 
this place when it's windy it's rainy it's cloudy  
but once again yeah don't let something like this 
ruin your mood I'm gonna be here for at least five  
days so I think in one of the next days I will 
be able to show you the full beauty of this place  
and we're gonna have an amazing time here I think 
but yeah this is of course not really what I came  
for to the Philippines but okay Let's uh get

a beautiful spot here somewhere seriously do you

as uh in Manila which is awesome but um yeah 
okay let's have a stroll around get some first  
impressions of the the beachfront 
here lots of food options available
ah no massage today I'm just looking for food
yeah I'm having this typical tourist Island pipes 
here and like in Phuket for example in Thailand  
which yeah the beach phones there can look very 
similar all the the bars here the restaurants  
promoter trying to sell all kinds of stuff 
so yeah the typical first impression here  
I would say this typical tourist Island Vibes but 
I knew that in advance I knew this was a touristy  
place so I was expecting that but actually yeah 
people come here for the beauty of this place  
which you know of course is uh or can't 
be seen at the moment oh no thank you  
it looks very nice but I don't 
have space for that in my back
behind Gary no I I travel 
full-time I don't go back home  
I travel full-time so my back is 
very small and I don't go back home
yeah I see it it's nice it's not driving yeah but  
I don't have space for that I'm very 
sorry okay have a good evening bye
yeah of course you have people trying to sell 
something on the beach which is of course they're  
just trying to to make some money right so uh 
always be a respectful to these people although  
I know they can get annoying when you're walking 
around the beach and every 200 meters or every 100  
meter there's somebody offering something but I 
always try to stay a polite and respectful because  
they are just trying to earn some money right 
oh no thank you no thank you have a good evening  
see and there was the second one just 20 
seconds later although it actually just  
met a guy promoting a party and uh I asked him 
about uh yeah all the wood that is lying here  
is that usually the case like this because it 
doesn't look that beautiful right and he said  
it's yeah because of the wind and yeah all of 
this gets uh yeah from the ocean to the beach  
but usually he said it doesn't look like this 
so uh yeah fingers crossed for tomorrow sunny  
weather a more clean Beach without all the 
the woods here or whatever this is actually  
so uh yeah stay tuned for the next videos 
I see fresh fruits here that's always nice
we also have a big menus here fried rice pancakes 
pork chop can I get a mango shake this one because  
one but uh no sugar please no sugar and then also 
the pork chop please all right found a little  
Eatery here which uh it's right by the beach 
although you can't do the city beach now because  
the view is blocked but the view isn't 
that nice anyway today so that's okay  
do we have uh we have banana ketchup oh sorry 
no because I heard that's very popular here but  
I never tried it I will try it inside so yeah oh 
you will see if we have it oh yeah because yeah I  
heard about banana ketchup in the Philippines and 
that sounds like a very interesting combination  
so I would like to try it 
so we have some lime here  
so yeah basic and quick mute for now nothing 
fancy nothing super special nothing local  
so uh sometimes I just need a 
quick bite so excuse me for that  
also I'm still a little bit careful with 
what I'm eating because you know I had the  
food poisoning last week so um yeah and the 
mango shake is also very good you can really  
taste when it's a fresh Shake make with made 
with fresh fruits oh nice oh that's very cool  
so is it really with bananas or is it just a 
name but this banana inside yes really oh okay  
I never saw ketchup before with banana okay okay 
now okay it looks like um like a regular ketchup  
but a little bit more dark I would say Okay first 
time trying a banana ketchup in the Philippines
maybe I need a little bit more 
so I will try with a spoon
interesting yeah that is a little little 
aftertaste to it which is a different let  
me put something on the on the pork chop here when 
I first heard about the banana in the Philippines  
I was like oh it's a joke banana and ketchup it's 
not bad it's not bad interesting definitely well  
I think it makes it a little bit more sweet 
at least this ketchup is kind of sweet okay
that's okay that's okay so 
that much thank you very much
okay have a good evening
yeah guys I am very sorry that I can't show 
you the the beauty of this place right away  
on the first day but uh that's how it 
is I don't fake my videos and go out  
and film the beautiful beach tomorrow and 
pretend it's the first day you know this  
is my real traveling experience and not every 
traveling day is a is a all day perfect every  
day is fine day sometimes you end up on a 
beautiful Paradise Island and you have to  
deal with rain and wind and clouds so that's 
how it is and if you haven't seen my previous  
video where I was in one of the richest areas 
in Manila in the BGC area then check out the  
video right here stay healthy stay positive 
and then see on the next episode ciao guys
