03:00 AM just woke up, our driver text us that he's already here
but we were agreed as to come on 04:00 AM, but he arrived earlier
So we quick gonna pack our stuff
and we gonna go to pick up our friends
...and we will go to the port,
we will go to other island, where we should dive with the whale sharks.
maybe a bit too cold, no?
05:00 AM first boat
I'm a bit confused at this time, cause dont really know what to do here
not really getting help from the guides
Wheather is so-so, a bit cold
How are ya?

It seems like slow motion

To be continued
