We started this top 5 with Miss Cavite

And has already represented the country at Miss Grand 2021
In 4th place we have Miss Baguio
This beautiful woman is 22 years old
Is a business expert
And is one of the big favorites for the crown of Miss Universe Philippines 2023
In my Top 3 I have Pauline, she is 27 years old
Representing Bohol
This is her third time in the contest
And I'm sure your perseverance will pay off
I believe she can represent the country in some international pageant this year
In my top 2 I have Makati
Michelle Dee is 27 years old
It was one of my big favorites last year.
And she comes back for the last time
To try to represent your country at Miss Universe
She already represented the country at Miss World in 2019
And finished among the 12 finalists
And at the moment my Miss Universe Philippines 2023 is Pampanga
Angelique Manto is 26 years old
She is a mental health advocate
And for me, she is one of the candidates that stood out the most at the beginning
I believe she has a great possibility of becoming the next representative of the country
at Miss Universe
