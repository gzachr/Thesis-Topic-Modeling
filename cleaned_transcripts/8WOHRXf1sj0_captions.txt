what's going on with the noodles
hi my name is alisa and i'll be tasting
other women's concerts i only eat pants
at filipino parties but i eat it a lot i
love panted a lot of filipino believe
that panset brings long life or longer
life so it's kind of a tradition to have
fun see in every celebration the panzer
has to have good and firm noodles if
it's soggy no no no no
my favorite ingredient in pam sit would
be chicken pork or fish bowls
i'm ready to eat some pancetta that's
how this is so filipino
[Laughter]
my perfect fancy is pancake with chicken
a nice medley of vegetables and
mushrooms i love mushrooms in it and
pancetta bihon don't be mad at me i love
that
oh bunset b horn
i like that
this fancy smells amazing the first
thing that i got was the whiff of like
flavors mmm can't wait to try
[Music]
it looks a bit sad
[Laughter]
why did you cut the noodles
the noodles are
short they're short the noodles are
short
they're not long and really you're not
supposed to cut one sit this short
it's like cutting spaghetti
italians don't like it i just think
maybe it needs more
veg
i don't know if this is mushroom oh
there's mushroom in it i've never seen
mushrooms in pansit before it doesn't
look planted to me i don't know
the noodles i'm quite disappointed on
the noodles
it's tasty
that does need a bit more flavorings to
it not getting as much of the flavors
that i smell when it first arrived more
pepper than anything else actually
taste more dilemma
what is that
i feel like my tongue is like sticking
together
it's nice that she added mushrooms to it
i haven't seen that really in one set
before
i would like to
have gotten
crispier vegetables
but otherwise it's okay
but only okay unfortunately it's my doll
i gave this pancetta 4 out of 10. i know
you try but i know you could do it
better i'll give this seven out of ten
i would give this i would say a five out
of ten
[Music]
for my panty i used both bihon and
kanton so it's a mixture of really thin
glassy noodles and like a noodles my
fancy i would say is fresh it's full of
flavors and the noodles is not soggy
oh
that's a lot
this looks hefty man you put a lot
oh
i like that it's mixed two different
types of noodles oh it's got fish balls
we got some fish balls
right in there right there
the noodles again
what's going on with the noodles why
isn't that long the noodles only a
couple of vegetables
and
not that much chicken from what i can
see from the smell i'm sure it will
taste really really nice
i really like that actually it's got
really nice texture to it it's not
overcooked or undercooked it's perfectly
done the noodles are cooked well it
looks really nice the presentable and
everything like that and i thought the
taste gonna be nice but
i don't know what's that smell
the favorite thing about this dish is i
would say the crunchiness of the cabbage
because everything else is obviously a
kind of similar texture and i think the
crunch is like bite to it you both stop
me because i'm going to keep eating this
yeah
this lady put a lot of
love and effort into this dish and it's
delicious i'm sorry
is the smell i don't know but it's gonna
have to be three out of ten i'm sorry
sorry
i'd give this pan set an eight out of
ten i would give this sponsor
9 out of 10.
well the ingredients i put in my pan
sets it has obviously the vegetables the
cabbage the carrots i actually put some
baby corn in there so hopefully they
like that one
there's baby corn in it
i've never seen that before
so really interesting to see how that
tastes with it
oh my god it smells so
good smells great this looks promising
there's a lot of like vegetables and
chicken
and i like that there's got baby corns
in them i love baby corns
okay i think i'm gonna like this one
first off i can already see
the noodles are noodles they're long
[Music]
it's good but it's dry
there's not enough juice i like the baby
corn in it
i really like that the noodles are
cooked
really well
i like that the vegetables are not
overly cooked and even the baby baby
corns are diced nicely look how cute
that is this almost tastes like my mom's
cooking
are you sure she's she didn't make this
and she's hiding away from me this fanta
tastes really good
if you like it dry
some people might like that i don't know
what a shame
i really like it i just think it needs a
bit more seasoning
i would give this one an eight
everything was really good mixed
together really well i'd give it a nine
out of ten
i would give this spam sip a six out of
ten
so my
cooking is more traditional and rustic
rice noodles with chicken
carrots
cabbage
home leaf
more for the family it doesn't smell
like the fish sauce that i would use it
smells like there is like fish in here
and i i don't really like fish mmm
there you go oh
the nose again
first thing i noticed is the noodles are
broken
so
the panzer looks a little wet i think
it's just over soaked it's uh
quite
watery
floppy
anyway it might be nice so let's give it
a try i'm gonna hesitate because of the
smell
oh i'm so i'm very fussy with fish
so uh
it kind of put me off a bit
i'm tasting something that i don't
normally taste in panzer though there's
an aftertaste i'm not sure what it is
i'm trying to put my finger on it
but it's in there fish sauce i'm getting
flavors of fish
when it's a chicken pansit it just
doesn't make sense to my head i'm
confused
weird that's weird it looks really good
but there is something there that i'm
tasting that's just throwing me off a
little bit
this is all right it's okay
i'll give it some i'll give it five out
of ten i would give this fancy a six out
of ten i'd give this pan set a four i'm
so sorry it's just not
my
cup of noodles
[Laughter]
[Music]
yes what is the noodles
it's long
oh that's so sad
i mean i tried i tried you know i'm
sorry i disappointed you guys
