- So, what would your life look like if
it was decided on by people you've
never met before on social media?
Well apparently, it would look a
little bit something like this:
There's a first time for everything,
and unfortunately it is my
first time missing a flight.
But we're gonna make the most of it,
and we're actually gonna leave our
unfortunate fates in your hands,
so today I'm doing an Instagram story
where I'm actually
asking you whether we go
on the late flight to Boracay or we
wait tomorrow to go to Siargao Island.
When life gives you lemons, make lemonade,
and now that we have missed our flight,
we wanted to ask you guys
what you think we should do.
Do we take a late flight
to Boracay through
the Kalibo airport, or do
we go to Siargao tomorrow?
It is now posted, so I'm
gonna give it 5-10 minutes.
What I've seen from
polls is within 5 minutes
you can already see what the result is.
Where do you think it's gonna be?
- Ooh, it's 50/50.
- Is it?
- Yeah.
- I legitimately don't
know what I want right now.
What I wanted was to be on my flight,
but that's not part of
the equation anymore.
Boracay is winning 55 percent!
59 percent say go to Boracay tonight.
The tribe has spoken.
But, there's one issue.
Within the 10 minutes I filmed the story,
checked the poll results, the last tickets
have been sold out for that flight.
The website said no tickets available,
but we want to check one last place,
which is Terminal 4, so we
got ourselves a cab here.
- It's fully booked.
- It's fully booked.
- Yeah.
- Aw!
Let's try that again tomorrow.
So I've prepared here an Instagram story
that will go live asking
people if they want us to stay
at an eco-resort or at
a budget accommodation.
Rise and shine, guys.
Let's get this bread.
So, who's gonna get the window seat?
I wouldn't get too comfortable.
- There's no way - you asked them?
- If who get the window seat.
- Are you serious?
- They voted me.
- No! I didn't know that.
(♪♪♪)
- And welcome to Siargo, guys.
We just arrived. I'm so excited.
Oh, wow!
- Welcome to Siargo.
- Thank you.
So, that has to be the
easiest checkout process.
There's one tiny little belt. You
grab your suitcase and you are off,
but this is what's waiting for us.
So this is a traditional jitney,
but basically like, imagine Xhibit took it
and said, "let's pimp this ride out."
This is what it would look like.
- Yo!
- It's a jitney like
you've never seen before.
- It's like the Magic
School Bus, just fancier.
- Would you say it's out of this world?
- Yeah.
- See what I did there?
- Yeah.
OK, guys, we're on the way, and
the next stop is Nay Palad.
(♪♪♪)
- So we won't be needing
that anymore, Katy.
- Bye, shoes.
- This is basically the policy here
at the resort is barefoot living.
- Sounds like perfection.
- We have arrived.
This is our place at Nay Palad.
It is one of the most beautiful
rooms you'll ever see.
So just come through the
glass sliding doors here
and you'll see it's all
hand carved here by locals.
Katy has already become
one with the resort.
- Yeah. I'm part of the hotel now.
- This shower is in
the middle of the room.
How mad would you be if I turned it on?
- I would be very mad at you.
Look how much repellent I used already.
- You used half of it.
Also, if you come out here,
Ugh! Ugh, how do you turn it off?
The room is one of the
most beautiful I've seen,
but it's not really about
the room when you stay here.
It is the all-inclusive feel
where it's not a resort,
because you don't see anyone else here.
It always feels like it's
empty, because they have
a very small group of
people here every time.
If you want drinks, if you want alcohol,
if you want a massage,
everything's included.
You don't need to carry around a wallet.
Now, of course, it doesn't come free.
In fact, it's very, very
expensive to stay here.
But if you're looking for somewhere
special to stay, a special occasion
like a honeymoon, this
is definitely the place.
It's so quiet, that all
you can hear right now
is these little crickets.
It's like when I make a joke.
Exactly.
So our first meal here,
and all of the ingredients
you're looking at have
been sourced right here
on the island or in the ocean
right in front of us, so
- I could've.
- Katy caught it herself.
- Yeah, I took my mahi mahi.
- Well done. Did you prepare it, too?
The best carrot cake I have ever had.
I don't even know what this was, but
the best carrot cake I've ever had.
- It's so incredible.
- You sounded very emotional
when you said that.
- Yeah, it's so good. It was incredible.
- (fake crying) It's just- it's so good.
We're gonna go to the Mangrove,
where you've got to
watch out for crocodiles.
- She say, we don't have crocodiles,
but there are snakes,
which makes it even better.
Don't fall!
- I don't think you need the hood.
- I like it.
We just got out of the
massage and it was so amazing,
and now we're going to
have a couple of cocktails
before dinner, and I just had a sneak peek
of our dinner, and it's just-
(cooking and plating sounds)
a dream.
I can't believe they did that for us,
but I'm like this.
Team Get Lost is starting their day here
with a boat trip out to
the surrounding islands.
Can I tell you what one of them's called?
- No, no. I want, I want a surprise.
- It's called Naked Island.
Alright guys, so this is their yacht here,
Wait, what?
This- different boat?
I guess this- I guess that's not the boat.
That's the boat. Never mind.
Pretty good acting?
- You will win an Oscar.
- Thank you.
(laughs)
Hey!
Hi!
We've just arrived here at Guyam Island,
which is like, the most stereotypical
island you could ever find.
It's got the blue water, the
palm trees, the white sand
and it's just like a
perfect little circle.
Do you know what they call this island?
- Nked Island.
- No. Lunchtime Island.
Some beautiful, beautiful local food here.
- We're ready for lunch. We have coconut,
and another word to say it is?
- Buko juice.
- Buka- buca juice.
- Buko.
- Oh, buko.
- In Guyam Island, this
island, we're already seeing
all the locals are building
their businesses here now,
and of course, you know, generally
that's not a great thing,
but it is rather to be expected.
The lucky thing is though,
Siargao is a very large island.
General Luna, which is the
main town and this region
might get a little bit busier,
might get extra touristy,
but at least you have a huge
island to go and explore.
I really don't think there's
any reason to complain,
but this is where the
best surf breaks are.
So for those of you
looking to come surfing,
General Luna is the place to do that.
Deliciosa.
- I'm gonna fly away!
This is Nked Island!
- Whoo!
- We got here at the perfect time,
I can see only one other boat over there.
We pretty much have this
island to ourselves.
- I haven't laughed so
hard in a long time.
- You like that? My Superman?
- It was amazing.
- It is perfection, and the
skies are going off tonight.
Katy, do we go nked on Nked Island?
- Yes.
- We have to ask our followers.
- Yes, I want to.
- Do we go naked on Nked Island?
The vote has been casted.
- Okay. Tell me.
(laughs)
Christian, why do you get nked so far?
- You know, I didn't really
think that one through.
- (laughs) Bye!
I'm gonna take his clothes.
(laughs)
- How unpredictable.
And now it's time to
leave, and I need you guys
to vote on the next slide to
tell us where we stay next.
Our destiny is in your hands.
All good things must come to an end.
We're leaving barefoot living and
going back to the real world.
- I'm staying barefoot.
- And to get there, this is the means of
transportation in the Philipines.
It is a tricyle.
Basically, what you've got is a motorbike
with this little sidecart fastened.
Luggage is being strapped back there.
How far to General Luna?
- Three kilometers or four kilometers.
- Okay.
Tricycle ride into town: 300 pesos. And
friendly greeter dog. Hello. Priceless.
So, from going from $1500 a night for
the two of us to now being $35 a night,
this is what you get here in Siargao.
This is actually a little expensive
for Philippines standards, and here
is a very basic but clean bathroom.
I've said it a million times, I like
affordable accommodations as long as they
are clean, and that's
definitely the case here.
It's really nice.
- Yeah, I like it, and
we have a couple poppies
on our door. It's so cute.
- We do.
So I want to show you some more
affordable goals right here.
Like I said, $35 a night for our place,
you walk 30 meters and you are right
here on the beautiful oceanside.
Check that out right there. The sun is
definitely gonna give us a show tonight.
Beautiful clouds, colors are forming,
Katy's getting harassed.
You're such a cutie.
So we just got a ride into town.
A random family made room for us.
I'm realizing we overpaid
for our last tricycle
after paying 300 total,
when everyone's like,
"Yeah, it's about 20 to 30 pesos each.
And it's time to get some dinner
at what is probably Siargao's,
I would say, most well known restaurant.
So this happened last time, it was
a 40 minute wait just to get
a table, so if you eat at
the bar, at least you can eat pizza.
So we're gonna skip the
line and get some pizza.
It's actually really good. I'm impressed.
Alright, this one is not a tricycle.
As we drove from one side to the other,
we've seen so much new
development that's opening up.
You can already see this
is an up and coming place.
Another thing that's
contributing to that is actually
Boracay having being closed
for basically 6 months now.
The restaurants are
full, the bars are full,
and Katy and I are right
now in this little tiny
coffee shop, where we're
doing a tiny bit of editing,
but finding Internet is not going well.
We actually had a very
interesting conversation tonight
with a local, and he was
telling us of an island
that's nearby that's kind
of like this uncharted,
undiscovered place by the name of Sohoton.
Now Sohoton is a two-hour banka ride away,
which is a tiny little
boat. So the question
is onto you now: do we
stay here in Siargao
and travel through what we know, or
do we go off in a banka to
explore a uncharted island?
It's a landslide win for leaving Siargao.
With exploring new places
comes early wake-up calls,
and we've got a wake-up call for 6:00 AM.
See you very soon.
- The driver asked me if I was Filipina.
Actually, it's the second
time that they asked me.
- A woman of many countries.
Poof! Guys, before we go
on our next adventure,
I have a quick interruption
that, I'm sorry, bear with me,
but I want to give a huge
thank you to Pure VPN
for making today's video possible.
What is a VPN, you may ask? Hmm.
Well, basically a VPN
is Internet security.
It is Internet freedom and flexibility.
It's the ability to watch
your favorite shows,
even if they're geo
restricted in your region,
It's the ability to know that when you use
public Wi-Fi, nobody's watching your
conversations, stealing your passwords.
Some of the best things about Pure VPN is
the fact that they have over 180
network locations, making
them one of the vastest.
They've been around since 2007,
and they have over 2,000 servers,
allowing your to make
sure that you're able
to access your content
no matter where you are.
At a cost of just $35 a year, it's
a great way to keep yourself safe.
With that being said though,
if you go for the 5 year plan,
it's actually only $79, so
it's an 88 percent saving,
and let's hop back to the video,
because we have a
two-hour ride ahead of us.
Good morning, guys. It's
5:30, it's time to go.
If you're looking for an affordable place
to stay, Eddie's was really good to us.
So here's how Sohoton typically works:
People will spend almost 2
hours going towards the island,
then they'll spend maybe
about an hour on the island
with their island tour, and from there,
they're coming right back to Siargao.
Now, that doesn't sound that ideal,
so what we've managed to do is we made
some last-minute moves, and late
last night we called
one of the few hotels,
if not the only hotel on the island.
But it's one of the
best ways to see Sohoton
and really be able to stay around.
It's almost like a local tale.
I don't know if it exists yet.
(upbeat music)
We have made it, an hour and a half later.
This is incredible. There's
nothing else around here.
I'm so excited. We only
have one night here,
but we're gonna make the most of it.
I can already see it's like
the clearest of waters.
I love this place already.
Guys, this is the welcoming dog, Bunga.
Hello!
My day has been made. The
Nescafe Creamy Latte, that's the
only thing I could have
ever asked for right here.
I'm a very happy man.
Quick room tour here, this is Club Tara.
Hands down, the best
thing about this place
is the location and the
view from your room.
Turning around here,
you'll see for yourself.
This is what we wake up to in the morning.
The bed, the Jacuzzi has a
180 degree view of the lagoon,
and, you know, the hotel room itself
is definitely a little bit older,
not everything is perfectly kept,
but it's clean and again, the reason
you're coming here is the location.
We're getting right back in
the boat that brought us here.
(boat motor running)
We've made it to stop numero uno.
That is a tiny, tiny boat,
and this is a big bag.
So this is Bobby here, and Bobby's
gonna take me through Sohoton.
Katy's got to get her own boat, because
she was just a little too heavy.
Do you feel insulted?
- No. You're the fat one.
- Oh, wow.
It's like a Venetian gondola, but
all the way in the Philipines.
So now we have now entered into
the jellyfish sanctuary,
which at the moment
it kind of looks like the jellyfish-less
sanctuary, because I don't see any.
Guys, we have this entire
lagoon just about to ourselves.
So this water is very murky
here, which is kind of strange,
because it's been so clear
until we got here, and
it's so beautiful, like,
this is just one of the
many, many lagoons and
coves here in Sohoton.
Just the experience of being here,
it doesn't even matter if there's
jellyfish or not, it's just incredible.
- I found your replacement.
- (laughs)
- I'm gonna leave you.
- I've been replaced.
- Ready?
- It's the next Lost Leblanc.
(boat motor running)
If you're wondering why I'm wearing this,
it's not because I got a job here doing
construction, although
I was open to it, it's
because we're going into a cave.
Watch out everyone. Whoa!
Watch out!
- Okay.
- It's bats everywhere in here.
So you have to come through
the cave to get to Sohoton?
Yeah.
Really? So we're only just now in Sohoton?
- Yeah.
- Where's the entrance?
- There.
- And that is the skip.
- You have to swim under there.
That's so cool.
- So we have to hold our breath
eight seconds and swim under there.
I have to do my free
diving. I got this, but--
Katy? How are you feeling?
- I don't know. I will let you do it
and tell me if I can do it or not.
- I might not come back. Maybe life
is so much better over there.
- I'm so scared.
- One, two, three, dive.
Okay.
(gasps)
You know, the light, if
you hit the water, all
the light from outside
somehow reflects and so
it creates almost like
this flashlight. So cool.
- Go!
- We have just arrived
here at a little jump,
and I of course need you
to vote. So, do I send it?
There's absolutely no cell
phone reception in here,
but, are you silly? I'm
still gonna send it.
See you in a little bit.
Still gonna send it though.
(water splashes)
You have no idea what we
just did to get up there.
You had to literally, like, breathe upward
and push yourself through a, like, a tiny
tunnel through a cave. It was crazy.
You had this much of an opening to get
your head through and, like, your
shoulders barely fit through the cave.
Guys, that was so amazing! So, kind of
confusing at first. I didn't really
understand how it worked. But basically,
you need to hire a vessel to bring
you to Sohoton for your day trip,
and then from there, they drop
you off at different points
Where you can, either you
know, hire other local boats
to take you into the jellyfish lake,
or take you through the Sohoton lagoon.
Everything costs extra,
definitely an expensive day trip
relative to the average
Filipino travel cost.
Definitely pricey, but
again, it's worth it.
This is one-of-a-kind.
The perfect white sand
beach, with the blue water.
It is because of you that
we stand here right now,
and that is the beauty
of the Philipines is that
when you leave the touristy
areas, you can find
deserted beaches, white
sand, incredible sunsets
anywhere you go, and I'm
so grateful we decided to
push the envelope to try something new.

- Started off our day with
a beautifully missed flight.
We're not gonna make it
to our flight on time.
- We're becoming experts.
- Dude, we are becoming very
good at missing flights.
Alright, my ears are ringing a little bit,
but we have made it, guys.
We just arrived at Dapa Pier.
The time has come to leave Siargao.
We have a van taking us
from the main part of
General Luna to the airport
for $300 per person.
I must say Siargao is
worth your trip as well.
It still remains my number one favorite
island in the Philippines,
and if you're coming to the
Philippines, you must check out my

Guys, see you next Saturday, and
let's get lost again in the next one.
