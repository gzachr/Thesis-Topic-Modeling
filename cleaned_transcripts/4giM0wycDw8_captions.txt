Ate and Kuya?
Family acceptance in the Philippines.
If you've visited the Philippines as part
of an Australian Filipina relationship, no
doubt someone has
called you "kuya" or "ate" (pronounced like
"ah-tay") if you are a girl.
You've probably asked about it
and had it explained to you.
But there's a bit more to it, and it's actually
quite charming and reminiscent
of old-Australia in some ways.
There are some societies that are fairly closed.
I haven't actually lived anywhere but Australia
or
Philippines, so I couldn't tell you the intricacies
of other countries for comparison as I can
with
Australian and Filipino societies.
But I think we know instinctively that the
Philippines is just that bit
friendlier and more inclusive than many others
where people are not valued quite as much
as they are
here.
Relating to each other - Philippines and also
old-Australia
I sometimes find myself caught out a bit when
I speak of Australia and Australians, and
how "Aussies
wouldn't do this......." about various things,
but reality is that I can't really speak for
all sectors of
Australian society in this day and age......particularly
in relation to my own day and particularly
my age!
I'm 51 years old.
Not what one would call "old", but at the
age where I find myself saying "in MY day...",
or where I tell my kids about something I
did at their age and realise that it was 40
years ago!
THEY think
I'm old!
Fortunately whilst growing old is compulsory,
growing UP is still optional.
I also lived in rural
QLD for 18 years before moving here, and old-fashioned
Aussie values are still alive and well in
the bush.
Long may this remain the case!
But the point I'm getting to (another sign
of age!) is that "in MY day" kids used to
refer to their elders as
"Auntie" and "Uncle", and never by their first
name.
Would have copped a clip behind the ear if
you did
otherwise!
Here that will call each other "Ate" and "Kuya",
or sometimes "Tita" (auntie) or "Tito"
(uncle), "Lola" (grandma) or "Lolo" (grandad)
and a few other titles.
Respectful titles, but there's a bit
more to it than that than just matters of
respect.
And I guess there was in Australia too, although
probably not quite to the same extent as it
is here.
Please read on.
Philippines - One big family
"Exclusive" means to exclude.
And there are traditions which exclude and
separate us into "them" and
"us".
Filipino society is far more inclusive, which
means there's a willingness to include and
more of a
desire to do so.
And it doesn't take most people very long
to realise this on coming here.
People are
what matters.
Most Filipino's personal treasure consists
of the family and friends that they love,
far
more than money.
They feel happiest when surrounded by their
nearest-and-dearest.
What made me think this the other day about
the "kuya" and "ate" tradition was when a
client said
"Thank you, Kuya Jeff" to me when I complimented
her on wedding pictures posted up on the
"Philippines to Australia" Facebook group
page.
The message to me is "I'm your sister, and
you're my big
brother!"
Same thing happens when someone younger calls
my wife "Ate Mila".
They respect her as an
older sister, and she treats them with kindness
and caring just the same as if she were biologically
related.
I can still remember many years ago when we
first settled here we actually had a client
come and stay
with us for a few days just before her flight
to Australia.
Don't get any ideas!
The Down Under Visa B&B
isn't open for business!
It just worked out that way in this case,
and it was fine.
She was out all
day.....came back....Mila said "Tess, you
should go to bed now".
She responded with "Yes, Ate" and went
to bed!
I think she was about 27 at the time.
This is Philippines, and that's not so unusual
here!
And 
I had a wonderful experience myself many years
ago when I first came here in the 90's.
Yes,
previous girlfriend.
Steep learning curve!
The issue was that her "Ninang" (godmother)
and family
basically took care of me as part of their
family.
She told me I was like a son to her, because
of the
relationship with previous-girlfriend.
She and her family treated me then as one
of their own, and to this
day we're still in contact.
I'm "Ninong" (Godfather) to her 17th grandchild
now, and so it goes on.
Nice,
isn't it?
So yes, it's a sign of respect most definitely.
No kid here would ever call me "Jeff".
Most of them call me
"Daddy" because it just worked out that way,
but if they didn't they would 
certainly find another
respectful title for me.
It says "I respect you", but it also says
"Please take care of me as you would one
of your own", and the right thing to do is
to do just that in return.
BE that big brother or that uncle to
those who are younger than you.
Be fatherly to kids and to teenagers.
Let it bring out something good in
you.
Use your judgement, of course.
Not everyone here has the best of intentions.
But let a few barriers
down, and you find yourself feeling more a
part of everything and less like a stranger.
It's certainly one
of the better aspects of Filipino society.
One of the problems in western societies is
loneliness and
feeling isolated.
It doesn't happen very much here!
