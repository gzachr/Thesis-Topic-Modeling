Let's start
Quarterfinal
I have heard about Wroblewitz
It's said she is German descent
But her family name looks Polish
Anyway... beautiful
Kathryn looks popular in teenagers
Maybe a young star?
Maureen has a delicate charm
Dreamy, isn't it?
Immersive
Let's choose
She looks popular
Janine has a feeling like Selena Gomez
Don't you know?
The singer?
Gutierrez is also attractive
I think I saw her somewhere
I think I saw her too
Something familiar, right?
Did I see at the airport?
She looks pretty and sexy
But Marian Rivera is...
I got it
Both have model-like styles
Filipino actresses are so beautiful
I think they have their own personality
I felt Julia was sexy at first
But looking up close, she is graceful
Megan is very sexy
If I talk with them at a bar
I think Megan will listen to me better
Do you like a bar so much?
Whenever you do 'choice tournament', you seem to go to a bar
Let's choose
I liked both as soon as I saw them
I liked both as soon as I saw them
I'm going crazy
It's so harsh to drop one
Both are so attractive
We have to choose without worry
She looks really sexy
I couldn't pass this charm
Semifinal
This...
At first I didn't think so
Her smile is
The smile looks kind
Are they both your style?

Final
Kathryn resembles a Korean idol someone
Ryu Sujeong of Lovelyz?
I think the style is similar, not her face
Long ago in Korea
30 or 40 years ago
Korean actresses were pure and pretty
She has such charm
A bit different from recent Korean idols
And Anne Curtis looks a little cold
But attractive
If she talks to me, I might fall in love
Let's choose
I'm confused
I don't know
Think slowly
Close eyes and calm mind
3 seconds
I will change my heart
Our 'Choice Tournament' among 8 Filipino Actresses
The final choice is
She resembles a Korean idol
I will search, just go on
we didn't deal with videos related to the Philippines
But our Filipino subscriber recommended this time
Thanks to her, we could see Filipino actresses
So beautiful, I was surprised
I also started wonder about Philippine movies and dramas
Not resemble
I searched Sujeong of Lovelyz, but not resemble
Because everyone has their own personality
She is so beautiful and sexy
I think she has various charms together
Dreamy and innocent
Mature and beautiful
But looks a little young
So complexed
It was a really interesting and surprising experience
Our funny challenge will continue
