lets get it
The texture is like kiwi
seed taste like kiwi
-taste simple
-feels simple
I thinks mango was too sweet
it dosent sweet a lot
i searched it
It has a lot of water and low-cal so its good for diet
seeds taste little sour and sweet
seeds are sour and fruit is delicious
In summary,
not so sweet and little scent of kiwi
its good
more you eat,  more delicious
its good
in simple sometimes there are little bit sweet
this taste
It has simple taste so it feel free to eat
-Its first taste
-me too
I thought I know its taste but
I only ate what's in the salad
i never had real dragon fruit
It's the first taste
If you go to a Korean buffet, it's with sauce
right
I think its like simple kiwi
simple kiwi
if its sweet i ll eat frequently
It's literally a healthy diet
if given that, it ’s delicious.
we ate dragonfruit well. lets get to next fruit
The third fruit is Rambutan
It looks pretty
i tried to get Rambutan, but there is no place selling raw Rambutan.
so we get canned-rambutan
Lets get some
ginger flavor? vinegar flavor?

cuz its canned?
Soft fruit-peel texture??

lts like jelly  little bit
I dont know what it is. Its first time i eat this so its strange
feels like Lychee texture
is there any seeds?
no i just cut it off
we don't know much about  Tropical fruits
because it's canned, the juice is full in that place.
The juice tastes jam. that's it
if i chew more juice come out

Sweet and savory and soft texture
The scent coming into my nose is embarrassing
-I cannot eat this much
- i surrender
give up. are you good??
Until now, there was no food I felt I couldn't eat.
-you looks fine .is good? 
-i think its good

-yup
There may be many who don't like this
I can eat as an experience, but I can't eat much
Woo didn't touch this at all
-In Korea we had similar foods
There are foods that can't even try like  spicy foods
like 청국장(Cheonggukjang)
Its insane. at first when u smell it  you say "oh?"
and then chewing it and "Oh????"
for real. deep inside is nice
each part outside and inside are different
i felt its like old garlic flavor and
It tastes sweet and savory
Finally, the scent left over in the mouth is melon
i felt smell and

The more you eat, the better.
-But first smell is too difficult
little bit creamy
1st- smell
