hi guys good day this is wena Ayala and today's 
video we're going to react why filipino don't  
hate japanese the way korean do yeah last time if 
you remember guys if you saw or watched my video  
my previous video about it's um from the video 
of Jessica Lee "cancel korea" in that video  
it explained why korean hates very or 
very sensitive about the flag the racing  
sun flag and that's why i saw this video it's kind 
of related. Today we're going to react this video  
why filipino don't hate japan the way korean do 
koreans do so it's so intriguing to to know or to  
watch this video and so without further ado let's 
start reacting.. so the content of the content of  
this video contains the dimension of the sensitive 
topics such as war violence and rape okay
it was made from a neutral standpoint and has 
no political intentions to rewrite negate or  
invalidate the history of the philippines korea 
and japan this video was not made to defend the  
filipinos koreans or the japanese but to give an 
attempt to understand why filipinos don't hate  
japan the way koreans do from the point of view 
of filipino students and research this channel  
respects the history of all the nations involved 
in this discussion the thoughts views and opinions  
that will be shared by those featured do not 
reflect those of this channel and the filipino  
people as a whole but will be based on their 
personal knowledge of philippine and world history  
that they have learned through the filipino 
curriculum viewer discretion is strongly advised  
to answer the post question through this video we 
looked at a familiar topic to both filipinos and  
koreans comfort women these were mostly women 
and girls from the philippines korea and china  
together with a number of women from other asian 
nations australia and europe before and during  
world war ii were forced into being sex slaves 
by the japanese army the following interview was  
shot in november of 2018 but was never released 
until today the faces of the people featured were  
blocked further privacy due to the sensitivity 
of the issues being tackled through this video  
when you say japan or japanese what 
are the things that come into your mind  
they're extreme work ethicals karashi yeah 
i research about that i think a pokemon and  
also that is really progressive it's 
like everything's so fast discipline
the yeah occupation the philippines 
anime yeah the language cleanliness  
because they're known for liking um as you 
can observe they don't think about world war  
right they they first think about anime the 
food the culture right it's so nice to hear that  
people actually japanese 
people are sort of loners yeah
the japanese occupation in the philippines 
was taught back in elementary high school  
and even college what do you remember 
from these lessons the harsh treatment of
i japanese that my grandmother was telling me 
about how they invaded philippines they use  
this term how we're gonna asianize you guys 
because most of our colonizers are from the west  
so that's how they got us but honestly in terms 
of their invasion it was very harsh compared to  
how the spanish and the americans colonized it's 
the same for me like when i think of the japanese  
occupation i also think that those really harsh 
comfort women yeah and then i remember how brutal  
they were when they killed our countrymen i 
remember that they were here for a short time but  
then their period in the philippines was abusive 
i guess very general like they were very abusive  
yeah just like any colonizers i guess it was 
1941 it was until 1945 august 6 and 9 that they  
stopped because of the hiroshima and kazaniwas 
their intention for the credibility was really  
not just really fascinating but also really when 
we talk about wars it's a very sad topic right  
this um i hate this subject though um about those 
slavery and whatsoever it's so sad history but  
of course we have to not forget forgive we have 
to forgive we have to forgive but not to forget  
about forget but forgive oh but then history is 
his stories but in the past so we have to move  
forward about the history it's written in the 
book elementary high school yeah it's well said  
economic they wanted the 
supplies for their ministries  
and also rice the japanese people became more 
so they started expanding and before world war  
ii it was more offensive because they 
had to keep up with western powers and  
like the western powers were taking over 
asia so japan had to step up the game yeah
oh yeah i forgot that's what they said 
i only changed a lot of policies and  
like madonna you're right
horrible parts of the war and mostly on the 
cruelty of the japanese soldiers when i hear  
about it it's more of a very negative connotation 
in my mind i think that's what they've taught us  
but actually one of the researchers that 
our friend gabby is doing in historiography  
she's saying that her lola was a 
life-giving japanese occupation
they're saying some positive things 
about the japanese people which is  
contrary to what you read in history 
books yes i have um was married
with a japanese soldier hindisha indigenous
so let's continue guys  
just happened between filipinos and japanese 
people they were treated well and in the provinces  
at least in small areas it's not necessarily sober 
and bad from japanese people have you ever looked  
negatively at japan or the japanese people why 
or why not india when they occupy the philippines
war ii when foreign had like battle between 
japan and america when yeah the americans  
bombed the two japanese cities and they returned 
like japan pearl harbor however yeah but i don't  
know what happened because i can't really judge 
no because from what i know japan it's a very  
flourishing country and everyone there is polite 
and you don't really hear about issues in japan  
i'd have to agree with her because i feel like 
they established their reputation while being
i think it's just in that context for me 
i have this notion that for example young  
chinese or like koreans or japanese they have 
to stick to their culture it's not negative  
enough and that's just what i think that they're 
really firm with how they live on their culture  
well like certain historical events during 
world war ii the rape of mankind for example  
i mean i hate this getting historical but then 
i think all countries have made mistakes so  
japan doesn't call for more hatred 
than anybody else the torture they  
did filipinos at that time but then 
yeah same thing we were in one country
experiencing the world war
without those um history happened so just accept 
it and anyway you cannot change anything not  
really get present times but then if you're gonna 
study like history and then you're gonna look back  
at how they take to the filipinos back then you're 
gonna have somehow a negative outlook towards them  
but then since it's in the past you fix the 
thighs and all i think the presents are not  
to be inflative i don't look at the japanese like 
in a negative way normal japanese person different  
nationality for me i feel bad how they're 
portrayed as loners and how they override  
themselves they actually adjudicated people so i 
feel bad how other people keep them personally no  
having already met japanese people and i've 
been in japan i know that sometimes we look up  
at the machado or like when we read philippine 
history it makes it seem like they're enemies  
or something in reality they're just people 
and what happened in the past was in the past
in korea and china the situation of comfort women 
has been highly controversial at times emerging  
under political tensions in japan up to this 
day why isn't this the case in the philippines  
i'm thinking about it now it's probably because 
japan like i said like it's very superior to the  
philippines so i think that's there also 
one reason why but they'll be governments  
yeah i think the philippines is scaring them 
economically i mean let's be real we're a  
third world country and they're one of the first 
worlds how they treated us possible when i saw it  
with google images and stuff like that i guess 
it's not really hatred but more on fear i feel  
like it's talked about a lot in history class 
we're aware about the abuses done during the  
japanese period i guess because filipino people 
are the type to forgive and forget we don't really  
represent japan yeah it might be because like it's 
not really an issue today like it was already in  
the past so it's not something we still think 
about as it means you're very forgiving because  
i also think in general we have this tendency 
to forget about what happened in the past
in line with what happened before conditioning  
sensitive topic most filipinos 
tend to forget about what happened
is
woman
about the world war about the colonization 
of japanese knowing the things that you have  
mentioned what do you think has prevented the 
filipino japanese relationship from being strained  
okay i think that japanese people happily good 
relations the filipinos also the reason why  
they don't want to speak about the issues 
because they don't want to like ruin their  
relationship the influence of the japanese to us 
it's also evident in the philippines they help us  
build bridges flyovers and i think that if 
ever the philippines talks about the issue  
people like the way the relationship part 
of it is that their government values your  
relationship with a much bigger mp than let's 
say japan countries like japan are not as much as
put the past in the history and let's befriend 
i think let's move forward and let's be friends  
that's all for this reaction video for
