hello everyone and welcome
What's better, on a rainy day, than seeing a nice Video Reaction?
So, it's what we'll do today
Yesterday while browsing wish 107's videos, I found new singers
I recently saw moana by disney
wonderful, I've adored it
beautiful animations
In my opinion one of the best 3D animation
I was shocked by the expression of the faces
details in the movements
the water
colors
all perfect
I usually do not appreciate a thing about disney movies
it's the songs
Especially in the oldest film I do not like them
It's rare I remember any of that songs
But in this movie, there is one
is wonderful
Obviously the song I'm talking about is how far i'll go
Who sings by moana
She sings it twice, maybe
But the first scene has excited me
I loved moana's character, and I was affectionated of this song
The part of the movie she sings that song makes my heart beat
i don't know why, when i see this part
I feel my heart swell
The song along with the scenes excite me
You can see moana's strength
She can not give up on a dream that calls her
then, in spite of everything
Despite having the parents against
Against popular beliefs
Which prevent she from going to the sea
Moana departs for her journey
Makes the decision with all its strength
And she goes, singing this song
Which we'll listen to soon
The singer is called Janella Salvador
I'm very curious
I hope that song will not to be deleted by Disney's Company
Due to copyright rights. It can happen on youtube
I hope it does not happen
Because this song is worth listening to
Ok
Now, after this long introduction
let's hear it
pop (XD)
I must be honest
That song, i do not know
It's just the song in itself
it makes my heart shakes
I identify myself in moana
i identify myself in her desire to leave
to go against everything and everyone
And every time I listen
No matter who sings it
Of course, this girl sings it perfectly
She has made me revive those moments
it's not easy
When you play a song sung by others
It does not always give you the same emotion
She was really good at this
She tightened my heart
i admit
so...
I will continue to looking for other singers
actually, i have two others for the next videos
hello everybody
