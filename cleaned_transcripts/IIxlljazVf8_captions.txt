This is Pork intestines.
Can I get this out of the way?
What’s wrong with this?
Nothing it’s intestines!
Picture Calamari
Oh like it can be an unclogged piece, are they all clogged?
I think so.
What does that mean?!
You should dip it in the vinegar.
It’s going to be better with the vinegar.
What?
It’s calamari.
Welcome to Foodie Momma PH!
Here we are the final episode which I have Justin Bratton and Claire Jedrek.
Did I pronounce that right?
Actually yeah you’re one of the few.
Ah you say..
So we’re gonna have a Filipino feast but it’s gonna be the Pulutan or the beer match.
We have a lot of items from El Mesa restaurant which is located in Clarke Quay here in Singapore.
So we’re going to pair all these with Filipino beers.
So we have here, this is what we call Lechon Kawali.
This is the closest to the roast meat.
This one is deep fried, we have here Grilled Liempo.
Liempo is like pork belly but with like maybe soy sauce calamansi or lime.
We have here the most famous Pulutan or beer match in the Philippines which we call Sisig.
Oh beer match, so you mean it matches a beer.
I kept thinking it was an actual competition we were doing with food.
She kept saying beer match.
How do I say it?
I’m just competitive okay, I’m sorry.
So Sisig, this is not the most traditional type it’s basically made out of the pig’s head.
So everything pig’s head the brain.
No!
The cartilage, the ears, everything is in here chopped down into pieces and boiled.
And the cheeks as well.
The cheeks, I’ve have many times before but the brain of the pig.
Picture it like it’s avocado.
Why no!
I would never eat avocado again!
Is it green?
Are pig’s brain green?
It’s creamy.
Oh no you made it worse!
Have you had chicken liver before?
Yes.
It’s creamy as chicken liver.
Served with onions and chili’s.
To distract us.
To distract you.
And some lime in there.
Let’s save that for last maybe.
We have here Pork mesentery, like we’ve got the large intestines and small intestines.
Oh my god it’s really intestines I told you.
And it’s like a wall the lining there the mesentary.
So we call this Chicharon Bulaklak.
Chicharoon!
Just like a flower crackling.
Well they’ve really, they’ve marketed that one as a flower crackling.
It looks like it could be some kind of sick flower.
This is a famous Filipino barbecue.
Most Filipino barbecue are marinated in a sweet sticky sauce.
Usually it’s color red because we use banana ketchup which is famous in the Philippines.
Well I’ve realized I know nothing about Filipino food, really a different world of food.
And this is Pork intestine.
Oh I was really hoping it was going to be squid.
All right, and we have here a huge serving of pork knuckle or trotter.
It’s basically seasoned and then deep fried, so it’s the perfect beer match whatever you call it.
This is quail eggs covered in orange batter.
The small ones are Kwek Kwek and then the big ones yeah
Kwek kwek.
And the bigger ones we call Tokneneng which are either chicken or technically duck eggs.
It comes with these dipping sauces, we have 3 here.
So I think we should start with some refreshments.
Yes agree!
Cheers to your first!
Cheers to …
Proper Filipino food?
Oh my god I think so yeah.
Filipino Pork barbecue, the safest.
We’re going easy.
Mmm!
It’s actually really good.
But it’s made out of banana?
Most Filipino barbecues have banana ketchup.
Sweet soft.
This is really good.
Yeah!
That’s a proper barbecue.
You guys have a lot of this like lime.
Yes!
I noticed that as well.
All of our noodles we put lime.
I think my son has developed it, he loves limes.
Quite similar to some of the street food barbecue you get like say Bangkok.
Yeah yeah.
Next safe one is Lechon Kawali.
All right.
So I can get a use of this something right?
Yes. 
You can either dip it in a soy vinegar.
This is optional right?
Yes it is.
Not too spicy, I was afraid that it would be too spicy.
You get all 3 of the soft, chewy and crunchy in one go.
The trifecta of texture.
The holy trinity of Filipino food texture!
I love this with rice as well and with the liver sauce.
Kwek kwek!
Oh I think I’ll go with the vinegar.
You can’t go wrong with this right.
You know the young town feel sweet sauce?
Yeah. 
We dip it in a kind of like the same type.
Oh!!
Damn it!
Oh it’s still safe we can try again.
Oh no!
It’s so big!
I’m just gonna eat it now it’s not like I didn’t have enough attempts.
I’m not sure if it’s gonna taste good dipped in that.
Oh really?
It should though.
It’s still good!
Okay, I haven’t tried that version before.
I think we’re going easy so we gotta start with a good one here.
Can you say Chicharon bulaklak.
Chicharon burakrak, buloklok.
Chicharon bulablok.
Bulaklak.
Chicharon Bulaklak.
I’m trying to see if there’s another piece that I can pick but I think they’re all the same.
You gotta dip it in the vinegar.
This one?
Yeah yes.
This is good with rice, with beer.
Oh my gosh!
I love this!
How can I not look at it.
Yeah, it’s not bad.
Right?
It’s good with beer because it’s salty and crunchy.
I just don’t want to I just in my head I can’t.
So one of my favorite kind of tacos is Chicharon tacos.
Near leon like Northern Mexico and stuff the way they do it it’s like all really really soft and almost kind of sweet and salty.
It’s really good.
Yeah this is great!
I think this is gonna work on a taco as well.
It’s really good, it was amazing.
I think if you didn’t tell me I would've just eaten it .
Really simple, we love it with rice as well.
Mmm!
That’s a nice one.
So your culture is very much into barbecue?
Yeah we love barbecue, like the street style you know.
Mmm..
Just not as fatty as like this giant like chunkers over here.
It’s a leaner piece of meat.
Which one is your favorite so far?
I think this one, there’s like a tanginess to it.
The calamansi.
I think I like this and this.
Like you said I like the trinity of Filipino food.
The holy trinity of texture of Filipino food.
Oh wow okay that’s way too long for me.
So we’re down to these 3 right.
Which one do you want to try first?
Can I get this out of the way?
What’s wrong with this?
Nothing it’s intestines.
That’s okay I would do it.
Picture calamari.
Yeah calamari.
Okay.
Oh look this is really chunky.
This is one got like heart disease.
No this this..
It’s clogged.
Oh god!
Oh like it can be an unclogged piece, are they all clogged?
Mmm…
Oh yeah!
I think so.
What does that mean?!
The sauce really hides any kind of flavor.
You should dip it in the vinegar.
It’s going to be better with the vinegar.
What?
It’s what
It’s calamari.
See because this also has a bit of the creamy texture that you have here though.
But this is a no go?
I can’t do it.
Iit’s surely visual.
Close your eyes.
Go Claire we believe in you!
Oh no it’s got fatty bits.
So does this.
It’s vesceral fat.
It’s good for you.
He’s done with 3 pieces.
Justin is done with 3 pieces, just one Claire.
Look at that.
Go for it!
And this isn't the best Calamari I’ve had.
I can get a non chunky piece there’s like one down to the bottom there’s a non chunky piece.
Wash it down.
It’s like there’s something in it that's making this taste bad.
This is what the beer is for.
I like it.
It’s sweet again because of the sauce and then you got the there’s a little crunch.
I just can’t mentally like intestine.
I just, I’m just like.
It’s just not something I would pick.
It’s not my favorite but I mean I can have like 3.
I think I’ve had my max.
I think we’re ready for the Sisig.
This looks like it’s gonna taste really good.
Yeah it does.
I would eat this.
You can try it without the lime.
Which one’s the brain?
Is it that?
I have no idea.
Is it the gray matter?
It’s all mixed up in there.
It’s kind of like uncooked egg.
Mmmm.
Oh I like this!
That’s really good!
I haven’t had Sisig in a while.
Yeah!
I can do this over that one any day.
Wow!
Yeah.
This is really good!
It’s almost like a warm potato salad type of thing.
Yeah you have like onions, like a sour onion thing.
Some people put it on tacos as well.
Yes!
Can you imagine.
This would be really good on tacos.
This is a good taco filling yeah.
Any day over fatty.
Look at that.
I’m not fussy with food, I just can’t it’s just something I just can’t do it it’s just really weird.
I don’t know.
Okay so you’re not an intestine fan.
No.
But you’re a Sisig fan.
This is really good.
I think when I was in the Manila I’m pretty sure I had Sisig several times and had no idea what it was.
And we’re just like this is amazing!
You had it with rice?
Oh yeah rice.  -That would really go well with rice.
Some before we get to the final dish the Crispy Pata.
I want you to try the Pale pilsen.
Oooh.  -Okay.
Which is another type of San Miguel brand beer.
Have you had San Miguel beer before?
Yes, I have.
Makes me think of Boracay.
I don’t actually like this because I’m not a beer person but it’s light enough where I don’t feel too full.
This is actually super light.
Wait how do you say cheers if you’re in the Philippines?
Tagay.
Tagay!
Mmm!
Yeah.
I’m in my happy place right now.
You like it?
Oh yeah, I went to the brewery when I was in Manila several times because
Seriously?
Yeah, I lived in Manila for like 3 months.
The San Miguel brewery it’s like you know not too far away.
It’s right there, the beers were super cheap.
They got a good little drinking area.
It was brilliant!
Yeah this is produced in Manila.
Yeah.
Well I’m not a beer connoissuer so I couldn’t tell you what’s nice or not nice or great.
But like I would drink all these stuff.
This is a phenomenal beer.
This is phenomenal beer.
I mean it says it on the can “Premium beer”.
What more do you need to know?
The final dish which is the biggest.
This is way too much food like this afternoon like for me.
Okay we’re gonna get through this together.
Thank you.
You’re welcome!
Breathe, breathe.
Okay, Crispy Pata!
Let’s give it a try.
Usually we’ll go for the skin first if you wanna try.
Yeah!
Cheers!
I love how I got like my healthy breakfast.
So this is low in cholesterol higher in nutrients right?
Yeah yeah.
Could be.
Okay.
Yeah
I like this one.
In Germany they have a dish that is super similar to this.
Really?
I don’t know how it’s called.
Is there any meat?
There.
Oh there’s the piece.
Yeah.
Oh it’s got a little spice to it.
Oh I love this one, I love it!
Filipino dishes are mostly savory, fatty, oily, sweet and sour all the flavors.
Is there a reason why?
Because we don’t use much spices, so we make it savory so that we can eat more rice
Because everything goes with rice as well as with beer.
Now I feel like less of a man.
Claire Jedrek making men feel emasculated every day.
That was amazing.
So I don't understand, the chili’s just decorative.
And Filipino’s in general don’t eat spicy so it’s always either on top or on the side.
Oh really?
Yes.
So why have it at all, just to scare white people?
Yeah I think so.
Well to be fair my husband’s Asian, he would not touch if they had a piece of chili.
Between the 2 beers which one did you like?
I think I like this one more.
Because it’s lighter.
Yeah.
I like the Pale Pilsen.
And out of all the dishes, which one did you like the most?
Actually I like the meat from this and like the crunchiness from this.
I’m gonna go with SIgsig.
I like the Sigsig.
Sisig.
Shh damn!
I’m gonna try one more time.
Oh!!!!
Oh my god that’s so good.
Like I said a roller coasted of emotion and flavors and taste and trinity.
Yeah, wrong uses of words.
Not good if you’re a vegan.
Or have high cholesterol.
It definitely is beer food.
If you’re in you’re bulking phase.
Maybe.
Like during your workouts kind of regimen, this is great.
You’ve got a lot of saturated fats.
It’s protein but I think you need to have carbs here.
Or on a keto diet.
This is all keto.
Yeah it is.
Minus the beer.
Replace it with whiskey.
