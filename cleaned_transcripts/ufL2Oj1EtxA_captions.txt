Candy: Hi besties!
Welcome back to my channel.
And for all those who are new here,
Hi, I'm Candy from The Porkchop Bun,
your best friend in Macao.
Today, it is freezing cold in Macao.
It is like, eight degrees
and that is really cold in Macao, okay?
I am wearing a lot of layers.
We are here to try Boodle Fight.
It is going to be a huge feast,
and joining me are
a group of my closest YouTuber friends.
And I can't wait to see if
we can finish this together.
Do you think we're gonna finish it?
Like, you know, let's
take on the challenge.
Carla: We should.
Pierre: We have to.
Candy: Let's take on the challenge everyone.
Carla: We don't waste food.
Zeack: This is my first time
that we've come here.
Pon pon: Yup.
Candy: Oh, so it's your first time also?
Zeack: So you know, I prepared,
I told Pon Pon not to have dinner first,
because I saw there's
too much food to eat.
Candy: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Zeack: So we will try our best.
Candy: Good, good, good.
［Announcer: Three, two, one, go!］
Candy: Yay, let's Boodle Fight!
Yo, I don't even know
what to start yet, okay?
Everything just looks so good.
I should just close my eyes
and just grab something.
Carla: Yeah, you should do that.
Candy: Right?
Just be like...
(Carla hums)
They have given us disposable gloves.
Because, I think that's pretty good,
you know, for hygiene reasons.
So, this kind of looks like Chinese,
you know, fried spring rolls.
You know, I'm curious if it's
gonna be really different
or if it's gonna be really similar.
So I'm just gonna test it out first.
It kinda does resembles
the Chinese spring fried rolls in a way.
The meat is a little bit drier.
The Chinese one is more oilier.
I'm going to try the sausage.
The sausage is like a little bit spicy.
So fragrant.
You know when they put it on,
it's super, super fragrant,
smells so good.
And then for the rice,
they have this like...
This is the base
and then they put those
fried crispy garlic on it.
It smells so nice.
Oh my God, I wish you guys
are with me right now.
So good.
I feel like there's a
coconut layer on the rice.
Dude guys, I really like the rice.
I think the rice is so good.
Just plain rice,
I don't even put anything on it,
I think it's so, so good.
Guys, you have to come for the rice, okay?
And there's seafood on it,
there's meat on it,
and it just kinda melted,
especially when it's piping hot,
it melts on that rice
and you can see and taste
all the flavors on there.
SO GOOD!
Oh, the fish is so crispy.
You know I just put my fork in there,
so let's try it out.
There's so much meat in the fish.
mmMmmm
The fish is super, super meaty.
I think it's really good
if you put lemons on it.
Oh my, look at that squid.
It's so filling.
It's like stuffed turkey,
but it's stuffed squid, guys, okay?
Oh my gosh.
It's like oozing out, okay?
When I just push it,
everything just comes out.
I think it's minced beef.
Mmm.
So good, guys.
This squid is really easy to tear off.
You just bite it,
it just tears off.
It's grilled so perfectly.
Mm, so good.
Thumbs up from me.
Look at what's inside.
It's really filling.
Oh my gosh, look at this.
Lots of meat in this crab.
Mm. So good.
Look how big it is.
Oh My God~
TA DAAA~
So apparently, this is pan-fried
燒肉 (BBQ Roast Pork)
It's really crispy all the way through,
like wow,
really different from what I'm imagining.
Carla: Can you hear the crunchiness?
It's so crunchy.
Candy: So we are half-an-hour in.
I think we're doing okay.
Not bad, not bad at all.
Pierre, what are you doing?
Pierre: Change outfit.
Candy: Why are you changing your outfit?
Pierre: It's for my second episode.
Candy: Are you full Pon Pon, or do you have room for more?
Pon Pon: Now it's getting hot.
[Two hours later]
Candy: Carla, how are
you feeling right now?
Carla: Full.
Candy: Really full?
Carla: Really full.
Candy: Pierre?
Pierre: Surviving.
Candy: Surviving?
I am so full right now.
I think me and Carla,
we call it quits for now.
We're quitting.
[Game!]
Candy: So Pon Pon's the final winner here!
Yay!
So we just finished the Boodle Fight.
Oh my gosh,
it's actually super, super full.
Totally recommend it
if you have a lot of friends coming over.
I think it'll be so much fun,
especially if you're just
trying a little bit of everything,
you have to use your hands to eat it.
I totally recommend to try it out.
So let me know how it goes.
And I'll talk to you next time. 
Bye bye!
