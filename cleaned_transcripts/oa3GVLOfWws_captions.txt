I think I want some grapes.
Pick some.
It's been a while since you cooked.
It's probablyh been about three weeks.
My beauty had to take a rest.
That's why you see I have grapes today.
Oh my God Mom, your lipstick is smeared.
That's OK.
It's not OK it's all over.
There.
Do you have it here, who are you the joker?
What are we cooking today?
Highly requested and highly favored,
Filipino Style Spaghetti!
Let's look at the ingredients.
Alright.
English only?
I quit!
3 pounds of ground beef.
Filipino red hot dog.
Garlic.
Ground black pepper.
One big onion.
Salt.
Mom why do you have salt?
Where?!
You have salt!
Of course!
They always tell me I don't have salt.
I don't have salt, but I they do.
Of course the sweetness of my life,
Sugar.
Classic spaghetti sauce.
Sweet style spaghetti sauce.
That's what we're going to use because we couldn't find Jufran (banana ketchup).
Is that OK? They said OK, they answered me.
I'm not OK with it. I didn't answer. Where's Jufran?
I think you have earphone on.
Our spaghetti pasta.
Because spaghetti will not be cooked without the pasta.
It's two boxes.
There's a lot.
And of course our toppings will not go missing.
The cheese!
It's not complete without it right?
I don't know, I think there's spaghetti without cheese.
Depends, yes! Me sometimes I do not use cheese.
Only when I forget to buy.
Now,
I will teleport to the stove.
Sorry I didn't let you see how I put the pasta.
Already boiled water earlier.
I already with the pasta and a little bit of olive oil,
so that it will not stick.
Is that OK?
Now,
we will wait until it's cooked, about 8 to 10 minutes.
Now with cooking the pasta, if you want to do it last,
or if you want it first before you make the sauce,
do you what you want.
There's no problem.
I cook it first so that when my sauce is cooked,
I will just put it in a plate,
I was just decorated with the sauce,
and cheese!
Before we start making our sauce
we will now drain the spaghetti.
Now we will start making our spaghetti sauce.
Let's open our stove.
High heat
We will be cooking with olive oil because this is a pasta dish.
Is that OK?
I will put it in.
Our olive oil is hot.
We will now put the garlic.
Let's put the onions.
Next is our ground meat.
Grounded meat of a cow.
The only thing different about the Filipino style spaghetti is the sweetness.
The sauce.
And the red hot dog.
That's what makes it Filipino.
The sweetness because we are sweet.
Let's leave it alone until the ground beef has cooked.
5 to 10 minutes we can mix it again.
Then we will put our hotdog.
Mommy are you OK?
Here you go again! You're so dramatic!
Are you OK because you don't have any knorr (chicken bouillon)?!
I put it to rest for now!
You be quiet!
Mommy, I don't know you!
Get out of my Mom!
Let me fix my dress it's going out of place.
TIP!
DING! DING! DING!
If you don't want any ground meat,
Mushroom is also good and it taste like meat.
White button mushrooms and portobello (best types to use).
 That came from Olly,
Because his favorite is mushroom.
But please do not use canned mushroom, it has no taste.
It needs to be fresh.
As in P-R-E-S-S.
Mom, "fresh" starts with an F!
There, it's cooked.
The color is changed and it's now become brown.
We will now put our next ingredient,
red hot dog.
Let's put it in.
Of course mix mix.
Mix mix.
Salt.
Pepper.
The sweetness
Sugar.
Now, if the sweetness isn't enough for you,
you can always add more.
If it's too bland,
you can put more salt.
Anything that's lacking in flavor, you can always add more.
OK?
There is no problem with your taste buds.
In every cooking, it is always to taste.
You tasted a bit here and there.
Until you finally achieve the perfect flavor for you.
Do you will now put our classic spaghetti style sauce.
Because lots of sauce is more delicious in spaghetti.
Let's mix altogether.
Let's put our suite style (filipino) spaghetti sauce.
Because I couldn't find Jufran.
This is already sweet,
so I only put a little bit of sugar.
Because I haven't-
Actually, I'm not lying, this is the first time I've used this sauce.
We will find out today,
if this is good for my taste buds.
We will make it again,
before we try it.
We will wait until our meat is cooked.
Let's leave it alone for a short time.
You know I was really surprised,
when you told me to cook Filipino style spaghetti.
Because it is so easy, I feel like everyone knows this.
I got scared that you will not like my recipe.
But of course,
I think you're testing me.
But here it is, we are making it today
for your happiness.
Don't judge me!
Is that OK?
TIP!
If you only have tomato sauce,
That's easy,
Sugar is the only thing it needs.
Just put sugar, some pepper, a little bit of salt,
As long as you don't forget the sugar.
Just as long as you have sweetness, it will be Filipino style.
I didn't have Jufran, but we still made it possible.
That is a mother's ability.
We always find a way.
It's already been 10 minutes.
Look at our sauce there it is.
Looks delicious. I'll go ahead and taste it.
It's just right!
I put just the right amount of sugar because it's already sweet,
the filipino style sauce.
It's just right!
Now if you want to put some thing a little bit more spicy,
Just add a little bit more of the ground black pepper.
Now we will turn off our sauce.
There it's done!
I told you, this video is only 5 to 10 minutes.
It's so easy.
Everyone can do this!
We will put together our spaghetti.
We will put cheese on top so it's ready to eat.
We will eat and we will put sauce on our spaghetti.
Look at our sauce.
We will now put the sharp cheddar.
We also have mozzarella here if you want to put it as well.
For the most part, Filipinos use sharp cheddar.
I will mix it.
For me I don't like a lot of sauce, that's why I put just enough
There we go.
Ready to taste.
Our spaghetti.
Let me see myself again a happy birthday.
The sauce I made is already delicious,
for me and my children for sure.
They will like it.
But if you want it just a bit thicker,
Put it on low fire.
For about 15 minutes, or when the thickness is enough for you.
Oh my, I think I want some chicken.
 Delivery for Mama Lulu.
Where did this come from?!
The Jollibee marketing team reached out to us (after they saw our one of our videos on TikTok of my Mom eating Jollibee).
They said they will give us chicken (all the food pictured above).
Thank you Jollibee, we have chicken.
Don't forget!
