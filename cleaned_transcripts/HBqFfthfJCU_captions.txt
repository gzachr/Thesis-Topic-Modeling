- Hi, besties.
Welcome back to my channel,
and for those who are new here, hi!
I'm Candy from The Porkchop Bun,
your best friend in Macao.
I know it's been such a long time
since I filmed the food
video, but I am finally back.
Today we are going to Jollibee.
We don't have Jollibee in Canada,
so I never tried Jollibee before.
This will be my first time
at the Jollibee restaurant,
just to try it out.
According to my friend,
Jollibee in Macao does
taste slightly different
than the ones from the Philippines,
so we gotta check it out just
to see how it tastes like.
(soft music)
So just by looking at the menu,
they have a lot of fried chicken.
I guess fried chicken is one
of their biggest sellers.
They have hot dogs, and
hamburgers, and also, let's see,
spaghetti, which is pretty cool.
I think I'll try the spaghetti for sure,
maybe the fried chicken also.
It's my first time here, yeah.
- [Jollibee Crew] Okay, actually, you can try this one
- Oh. It's a little bit of everything.
- [Jollibee Crew] (indistinct)
the tropical chicken burger,
we got bacon and pineapple.
- Okay. Let me see.
- [Jollibee Crew] With
honey mustard dressing.
- Okay. I think I'll have the champ.

So the super meal has
fried chicken, pasta,
there's steak with gravy,
and also mashed potatoes,
so it's a little bit of
everything of their classics,
which I really appreciate,
and I feel like, you
know, for someone like me,
who is like a little bit
overwhelmed with what to pick,
this is like a starter collection.
Mix it up first. So this is how pasta is.
They have some cheese on the top,
and I see it's red sauce,
so it's like tomato sauce.
Yeah. It smells spicy,
like spicy tomato sauce.
So they do have little pieces of,
I think these are sausages.
Wow. The sauce is super, super sweet.
If you give me a blindfold to eat this,
I would legit think this
was a dessert or something,
'cause it's really, really sweet.
This is what the steak looks like.
First impression wise, in my opinion,
it just looks a little
bit bland color wise.
I haven't eaten it yet,
but just color wise,
it looks a little bit on the blander side.
Like just, you know, it's not lively.
It's not like, "Hello.
Eat me!" Kind of thing.
So it's a really thin layer of a patty,
from what I'm seeing, with
a little bit off mushrooms,
so maybe like mushroom
gravy going on here.
Like really thin piece.
I just wish it was more chewy,
'cause right now it
just tastes a little bit
on the flatter side, you
know, just like, "Mm."
You know?
I wish it was a little bit
bouncier and just a little chewy.
That's what I really
prefer, that squishiness.
I'm quickly looking at what
other people are getting.
It seems that a lot of people
are getting fried chicken,
so fried chicken is a must order
here just by looking around
and like...
Yeah. I see a lot of fried chicken
So I'm going to try their chicken next.
One thing that I give a lot
of props for is the chicken.
Inside it's juicy.
It's not dry, 'cause you know
some fried chicken?
Some fried chicken are so dry.
I was just like,
"You know what? I can't do
like super dry fried chicken."
This is actually, there's
some juiciness to it,
and also that crispiness
surrounding the chicken,
and its flavorful too,
it's not like there's no flavor to it.
There's actually flavor in the chicken.
I only taste a little bit of spiciness.
I do feel a little bit like
a kick to it, but for me,
I love my spicy spicy,
so I hope that one day
they make super spicy
chicken wings or something.
(video game jingle)
(alarm blares)
You know what?
I take a back about the spicy,
its actually pretty spicy,
the flavors kicking in right now.
Before I'm like, "No problem.
It's not that spicy."
Now I'm like, "Ooh." I
actually feel the kick to it.
This is what a Jollibee
burger in Macao looks like.
Is there lettuce inside?
How come it looks really
different from the photo?
The photo looks really big.
I do understand it is
photoshopped, you know?
Photoshopping all the way.
Just by looking at it,
okay there's patty, cheese.
I found a tomato, guys! I found a tomato.
There's like ketchup.
I'm just gonna press on it,
'cause I feel like,
for McDonald's burgers,
they do bounce back a little bit,
so this one doesn't bounce back.
So like this, if I go like,
it seems like I'm massaging
for the burger right now.
Does it have onions?
(buzzer buzzes) No, I
don't see any onions here.
When I take a bite of this burger,
it's super, super saucy.
Like, you know, explosion
of what the sauce is,
like ketchup.
It's like super in your face sauce.
I'm only eating maybe a
third of the burger so far,
and I feel like all I'm
eating is the patty,
but for me, I want to eat a
little bit of tomato or lettuce.
I think there's only one
small piece of tomato in here,
and lettuce in the back.
Let me see if I can peel it open.
This is legit how big
the lettuce at the back.
It's like one small piece,
so I wish there was a
little bit more lettuce.
So it's like a one small piece
lettuce with like one tomato.
(whimsical horn music)
Oops.
Oops. (dramatic music)
I just ate the lettuce in one bite,
and there goes my
lettuce, no more lettuce.
So I just finished the whole Jollibee meal
and it was pretty interesting.
I get to try out a different
culture's fast food chain,
which is really, really cool.
Some things I didn't expect,
like having spaghetti and
hot dog as part of fast food.
It was like, "What?" I am pretty full.
I feel like I need to walk or
run five rounds or something.
I have to walk home or something
'cause this is actually a
pretty heavy meal, okay?
I actually ate quite a lot of it,
so I feel like my cholesterol
will be really high, you know?
Just walk around just to
lose all that, you know,
fattiness and greasiness to it.
Let me know how it goes, and
I'll talk to you next time.
Bye bye!
