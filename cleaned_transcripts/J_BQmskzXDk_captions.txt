that little ty in there we have tried this before  
lumpia oh yeah oh you guys forgot what it was yeah 
i told them we got the pizza and they were like  
yeah i remember they were really good the spring 
rolls which i mean these are fantastic amazing so  
here's a plate for you to dish out your 
rice all right all right you guys let's  
mix it all in and let's dig in because i am so 
excited about this chicken yeah let's go go go
that adobo sauce seasoning delish oh my god oh 
my god so good do you need to be left alone with  
that for me yeah that is amazing steve might need 
a chance of pants i think so wow so i'm all about  
the chicken because this this chicken it's like 
melt-in-your-mouth chicken oh yeah but the season  
on that thing is phenomenal wow it's so good 
it's so good i heard that you could guys juicy  
as tender i heard you can get adobo seasoning 
like dry packets in the grocery store i wouldn't  
buy that because this is phenomenal so my question 
to you guys is since this is really gonna they're  
gonna be like what where's the uh sauce since um 
we've tried numerous filipino dishes and there's  
still so many to go that we're trying tirelessly 
to obtain um it's another running journey what  
has been from what you can remember that we've 
tried what has been your most like surprising  
dish that you were like i still think the crispy 
pad that was my favorite that is like that  
fantastic with the crispy skin on it yeah with 
this this is delicious and if i remember these  
the lumpia were amazing lumpias are really good 
yeah i remember being really good get that crunch  
oh low crunch what about you what's the 
mommy the food which one of you like the best  
okay um for me like the crispy powder and stuff 
was good everything i've tried has been really  
really good but this the chicken adobo is probably 
something i could see myself eating like once a  
week like regularly um like the crispy powder was 
good but you know i don't know the halo halo halo  
halo i forget how to say it oh hello almost killed 
me but that's okay that was the jackfruit thanks  
everyone for the tips there i have no idea it was 
jackfruit and everybody told me and i'm like that  
makes sense actually i'm thinking about it crispy 
crispy powder was my favorite crispy powder was my  
favorite are you just copying steve no i had to 
jog my memory when you asked me it wasn't right  
all of them yeah but that crispy powder was so 
good the crispy uh screen outside that was the  
thing that created the tender porky side oh my god 
i loved it i actually really really like the uh oh  
i'm gonna forget how to pronounce it without the 
words in front of me but the singing gang singing  
[ __ ] you guys we're trying we're practicing but 
i don't have it in front of me to see how it was  
spelt so well i feel bad too but some of these 
it's been months since we tried them that it's um
but this chicken adobo is so good 
it's really really good it is  
probably one of the best things i've eaten 
on this channel it is really really good  
but they cook the chicken really really well 
like i said it's like it's like melts in your  
mouth almost like if you were going to like 
pull it apart with a fork it is like that you  
know like the yeah you can pull it apart oh 
what is this called again lumpia the lumpia  
the rules the the olympia these are like they're 
really good i think this has to be a side with  
every like filipino meal these are so good yep i 
think i'm gonna pass the dipping sauce i'm gonna  
i'm gonna steal a piece i think that if i remember 
correctly when we first tried these um and i did  
some research on it but this is like a staple 
at like parties and stuff so yeah well i can  
do that it's so good and we're having some is it 
a party if there's no lumpia um like we've tried  
a bunch of other different from other countries 
and we have enjoyed all of it like there's some  
that obviously we've enjoyed more than others but 
the filipino cuisine is one of those ones where  
i don't think we've ever kind of 
been like so far it's all been yeah  
something really good it's i think it's yet to 
disappoint us like i said i'm shaking my head  
but this is me this is me enjoying it i'm like 
like don't stop don't stop yeah in north america  
remember wrong but rice is not really a finger 
food no what no the filipino cuisine from what  
i've seen it very much is oh yeah everyone said 
yeah just use your fingers and just get in there  
yeah let's go bye i'm using the chocolates 
maybe maybe another thing we could do you  
guys have to let us know down below if you 
think we should try it but maybe we can try  
making chicken adobo one day we could yeah now 
that we've actually tried it from a restaurant  
we can see if we can do it justice in our own 
kitchen i'm scared i don't want to do anything
but this is really really good in this whole 
video just here licking our lips and oh my god
