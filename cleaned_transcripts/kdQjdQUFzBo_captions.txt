hey everyone welcome back we have finally 
made it to the beautiful island of boracay  
Philippines if you caught our last video 
you'll know that the journey here was not  
easy so in today's video we're going to be 
going around and trying out a lot of the top  
rated things to do here and at the end we'll 
let you know if we think it's worth it or not
so this Vlog is starting off and in a way that 
I pretty much wish to start off all my days of  
my life and that is by walking on a beautiful 
white sand beach the beach we're walking on is  
literally called White Beach I have to say that so 
far this beach is probably one of the best beaches  
we've seen in the Philippines because it's so 
powdery yeah there's nothing like there's no  
Coral there's nothing else yeah so one of the top 
things to do here is to rent a crystal clear kayak  
see like this guy I'm pretty sure we're gonna try 
and get our handsome one I think that'd be really  
fun go for a little kayak around the ocean but I 
have no idea how your rental I'm assuming there's  
just gonna be a person at some point that we 
can just say hey we want your kayak hi I cry  
until it's 300 for 30 minutes 600 for an hour that 
seems pricey I think we should walk down the beach  
so it looks like we found the shopping 
part of the beach because there's lots of  
souvenir stores here and I still love this 
because it's still all along the beach so  
you can do your swimming and you can do 
your shopping pretty much the same time  
how much for one hour pop for an hour or so yeah 
or two people give you 800. the guy gave me 800  
for two people for one hour or 400 for 30 minutes 
so surprisingly Nicole got better pricing maybe  
this is the power of being female that's true 
I just I guess I'm not as cute that's probably  
it you're a definite if you're cute you could 
knock off 100 pesos after a crystal kayak ride
I love the bartering we've Enlisted 
the locals to help us I think it's  
gonna work soon okay yeah let's do it sure okay
thank you [Applause] so much [Music]
all right guys one of the absolute 
top things to do in Boracay get on  
the crystal fire all we need are some fish 
and some Coral underneath so look at oh  
you can really see the bottom yeah there's 
nothing there there's some seaweed apparently  
this is the time of year we can get some 
seaweed in the water when the sun comes  
out like it feels like the entire ocean floor 
is Flowing but when it's uh dark it's a little  
bit cloudy then it's just uh seen from Jaws 
except now we can see our see our uh our Doom
so the reason we only did half an hour is 
because it's not like you can really like  
go anywhere like you just like go up to the 
Sea and like like paddle around a little bit  
but like normally the kayak I'd like to like 
go to little areas do stuff around like you  
can't really do that here so we only did 30 
minutes because I think an hour would kind of
money then it's a workout
well I'm alive yeah it's true I think it was 
actually better than expected considering we  
did we didn't really go anywhere yeah 
and there's not really much to look at  
no there's not I think I do think the reason 
you got me though is like takes a photo then  
like for us to take video like if you're not 
into that I don't really know what you would  
do here but then you can look at the water but 
there's like no fish or Coral or anything yeah  
like the turquoise ladder in 
the boat I actually get tackle
[Music]  
okay so the kayak was great but now the 
sun is out and it's blazing we're gonna  
hop in the water because we need a 
little bit of cool refreshingness  
so you've probably noticed there's a ton of moss 
here maybe we've already mentioned it I don't  
know there's like all this moths here apparently 
that only happens at certain times of the year  
so it's not always like this I think we just 
chose the time of year to come when there was  
a ton of moss which we actually thought I'd be 
gone by now it sounds like uh yeah I don't know  
I think it's here later in the season than normal 
right now but anyway Moss aside the water actually  
cold through like compared to where else 
to be in the Philippines it's true yeah  
like the coldest one we've been in since 
we got once again hashtag rockeye problems  
it's real it's real thrill of chili right now okay
this is so nice we're gonna have 
nice weather today Moss me up
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
okay so I know we're in Philippines but one 
of the awesome perks about being in Boracay  
is that you can get any kind of food here you 
don't have to eat Filipino food so if you feel  
like Japanese food go for it I got goo done 
which I've discovered throughout travels that  
I really like even though we haven't been to Japan 
we've been having a lot of Filipino food recently  
mainly because that's probably the cheapest food 
that we could find when we're just kind of doing  
like a whole working day and a vlogging day we 
decided to treat ourselves a little bit and go  
to a different restaurant on like the main 
strip the main Beach and we landed on some  
delicious Japanese food I got the katsu done or 
Kat's done which is like a breaded chicken with  
some egg and some rice and I got my own miso soup 
as well oh man I mean at the end of the day it's  
rice and meat and it has the essence of Filipino 
food but it's Japanese food well Club meat food
[Music]  
okay so one of the most popular things to do here 
in Boracay is water sports so we've waited for the  
afternoon to relax a little bit and now it is 
time to do when we signed up for I'm a little  
nervous they're going parasailing I'm so excited 
oh oh it's right here oh it's like right here
hello hello
how do I drive where do I go
okay there you go we're going 
it's like the gas pedals
all right
cool
[Music]  
oh my God I'm scared
[Applause] oh man there's way too much 
power for me for a first timer driving  
the boat I think he's doing really 
good nope part one of our extreme  
sports for the evening is Nicole 
driving the speed boat [Music]  
yeah oh yeah okay signing our lives away and the  
Sun is setting and I think 
it's time to get on let's go
[Music] but you know what's cool about person is 
I feel like the worst that can happen is you fall  
from this guy into the water it's true maybe the 
parachute like gets wrapped in you and that would  
be scary but you've got a life jacket on so I feel 
fine as long as they don't crash onto the boats
it's gonna be good and they got a gorgeous 
sunset happening it's not bad for my first  
time parasite well you know what let 
me hold off on that until we get down
okay [Music]
thank you
wow [Music]
thank you [Laughter]  
are you okay
okay I feel like a little calmer I think 
like we're as high as we're gonna go now
[Music] is so beautiful from up here it's like 
hard to appreciate honestly a little like sick
I'm so happy this is perfect timing 
if you go parasailing you gotta do  
at sunset this is an awesome 
way to see barakai yeah okay  
this is pretty cool this is pretty cool 
right pretty cool yeah it's pretty cool
[Music]

that just happened okay it's been like 40 
minutes since we left this dog like it has  
been like no time at all that was so fun so to 
wrap up this video I gotta say I think Baraga is  
worth it this is pretty cool the like in the 
daytime the beautiful white sand beaches the  
water the coconut trees good food and then also
