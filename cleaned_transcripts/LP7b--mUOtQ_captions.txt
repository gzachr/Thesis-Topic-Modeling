Hello Manong George here welcome to our channel
and today we have a very special guest
Ruel Martin Lonzanida I work as a senior healthcare
assistant in cath lab cardiac center
I used to be a commercial and print ad model
and also I work as at home as an editor for a company in the U.S.
came here 10 years ago and I didn't start
as an HCA I found a job which is in the hotel
as a receptionist and then I worked there
for two and a half years and then so I
kept on checking and checking on NHS website
which is which from there they always show
if there's an opening and fortunately my wife
was working, nurse in theatres and she said
that there's an open and she said that there's
an opening for an HCA so right there and then
I went to the website gathered all my
resume and everything and then I applied there
so I had after that after a couple of weeks
I they shortlisted me and yeah I started there
already as an HCA
with regards to the requirements or experiences
I was always thinking about that as well but
they didn't require any experience what they
needed is you have started to work here in
UK that's what they wanted to see because
without any experience or any previous
job experience they won't be having
history of your job employment so that's what
I wrote in my uh CV or resume and with regards
to the requirements it doesn't have to
have like an experience in an HCA or medical
job as long as you are eager and willing to
to work and you show them that you are responsible
and honest enough yeah they they're going
to hire you immediately
as an HCA in theatres I worked there for two
and a half years as well what I did was
is to stock up to prepare the trolleys to
help the theatres if they're in need of a
runner like getting all the equipment necessary
equipments that they needed in the operation
and then I also helped them in tidying up
after the operation as well as cleaning
and sanitizing the area and then after maybe
that was two and a half years if i'm not mistaken
I there was an opening as well in which I
transferred to theatres procurement and from
there I learned how to order stuff disposable
stuff from different departments which is
the orthopedics, bariatrics and everything
and I work as a theatre procurement for one
and a half years and I've learned a lot so
I moved on in my career work in renal department
from in that department there's an it's
different type of job in which uh it's a hemodialysis
from where these people who has kidney problems
or their kidney failure that's the time that
they needed dialysis now I transferred to
katla which is a heart specialist or cardiac
center in which they do angiogram but then
it's a promotion for me because I I've been
I applied there as a senior healthcare assistant
in which I do the pre-assessments of patients
under before they undergo their procedures
like pacemaker, angiogram and then I also do
the ordering as well in which is a part of
my job that's it
the adjustment it's a big uh adjustment
which in which they call it like from like
a 180 degree turn from like a relaxed job
back home up to then I suddenly became an
HCA excuse me in which is really a big adjustment
I don't see it like it is a hard job but being
optimist is like I always enjoy doing my job
to be as a HCA because from there you
get to meet different people from all walks
of life the only adjustment that hindered
me when I was there it was like talking to
different people in which I might not understand
them properly because you know of the accent
our accent is different from the accent of the english
I started as an HCA in theatres as a band two
I was hired as a band three in which they call
it here in the hospital as senior healthcare
assistant in which you have another job to
do or task to do or responsibilities as well
in which like what i did was reassessing the
patients in which that I should really know
uh what are their needs in
which also I take blood
don't lose hope
there's you know here there's a great opportunity
here if you are always eager to look for a job
always go not only if you don't want an area in which
you don't want to work in the hospital you go to job center or you
can always find a job online but the only
thing that I wanted to say is that you always
have the the urge or the uh willingness to
to look for it because if you are here and
then you all of a sudden you're always thinking
of oh I you got homesick I need to go back
home it won't be for you that's what
i did when i first stepped in this country
I immediately the following day or
after two days i went online prepared my my
resume or what they call it as cv and I wrote
everything down so I'm always prepared so
that's what you need to do and don't be
pessimistic always be optimist
that there will always be a chance for you
