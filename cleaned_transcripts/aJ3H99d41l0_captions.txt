the ride is going to be about two and a 
half to three hours and I hate having to  
go to the bathroom when I'm writing public 
transportation and squiggling around holding  
my pee that's not gonna happen today okay 
I'm crossing the street I have to be careful
okay I caught a red light so that's 
good maybe I can go to the bathroom  
here where's the entrance okay 
guys we're gonna find the entrance
okay so I think I found the entrance 
into TriNoma it's really nice look
see the sign try no more there okay so 
there is a restaurant called manam and  
it looks like it says Filipino comfort food so 
I might go in there if not I'll just use the  
public restroom inside TriNoma Mall 
should be fairly easy let's see
okay a bunch of restaurants  
hmm maybe I should just eat yeah okay 
where I have my options romantic bad boy
J Cole that sounds good oh it's 
Donuts wow okay where's the toilet
toilet oh
I was holding my umbrella I'm 
indoors now okay let's put this away
upstairs thank you okay wow China mall is so nice
wow okay so we went up one floor and 
he said go left before the toilet  
and there's so many restaurants here 
fights we'll take you which is like sushi
cool we found the bathroom next to 
Blake's wings and steaks okay I'm  
gonna do my business so I'll see you 
guys in a bit wow this is so pretty
there is a bunch of restaurants here on the floor 
of TriNoma and it's gonna be a long ride I didn't  
really eat anything for breakfast so I'm just 
gonna grab something to eat really quick it's  
about 2 20 my bus ride leaves at 3 P.M to 
Dao Clark Pampanga so I better not miss it  
um so I'm just going to pick something that's 
quick and easy so I'm not gonna go to Jerry's  
Grill because that's like a huge Family 
Restaurant and the food takes a long time  
um there's periperi I'm not sure 
if that takes long there's Ramen um
Ki mix Sushi hmm that sounds good aston's I don't 
know but it looks like a big family restaurant too
let's keep looking ah Popeyes that 
sounds quick uh yeah let's try Popeyes
it is currently  
2 30 p.m my bus leaves at three I don't want to 
go right at three so I ordered something easy
um I ordered fresh rice paper rolls with 
shrimp and pork so that's 185 pesos and  
then I told him that my bus is leaving 
at three and if he could tell the chefs  
to kind of be aware that I have to 
leave so hopefully it comes quickly  
um but yeah I'm getting super hungry so I 
can't wait to eat fresh spring roll sounds  
really nice for my stomach and good 
for a long bus ride so see you guys
thank you
oh it smells good here so this is noodle soup 
Vietnamese restaurants and I just wanted to  
get something easy on my stomach I saw Popeyes and 
that was tempting but honestly I don't think Fried  
Chicken for the first thing I eat for breakfast 
would be good for my stomach especially for a  
two and a half hour bus ride so fresh spring rolls 
sounds really nice up I made a discipline decision
okay so for the spring rolls that cost 194 okay so 
switch equals about three dollars and fifty cents  
USD so not bad it's a chain restaurant so a little 
more on the pricey side just for spring rolls but  
um I'm here at the mall so that's kind of what 
you have to expect all right oh you got it to  
go so it is 2 35 that took five minutes though on 
we go let's go ahead and get on that bus thank you
all right let's go ahead and walk to the bus out 
of TriNoma Mall pass by all these restaurants  
there's Popeyes I was about to go there but no 
fried chicken for me okay let's go downstairs  
I'm gonna put this away all right we're heading 
out of TriNoma Mall and it looks like the rain  
stopped but it's still pretty warm and humid out 
it usually feels like that after the rain but now  
we're gonna cross the street doesn't look too 
crazy there's a walkway here I'll show you guys
no cars at all okay let's see 
if I remember where the bus was  
um should be oh this guy I feel like he 
could have waited for me but whatever okay uh
let's see there's the mall and then where is
it I totally forgot
um oh okay okay it was on this side of the mall
going there
okay what a journey guys what a journey 
honestly I'm just so excited to eat this food  
all I got this morning was an energy drink 
Cobra I don't know if that's like a famous  
energy drink in the Philippines uh it looks like 
this guy's Crossing I'm just gonna follow him
okay let's walk with this guy
oh it is so humid right now 
after the rain oh here we go
let's go
oh there it is ooh big bus
so P2P stands for point-to-point bus and I'm 
riding the Genesis premium point-to-point
and the driver was nice enough to lend me his  
umbrella because it was raining but I'm gonna give 
it back to him uh where is he thank you so much
wait okay
time to eat let's see spring roll take 
away at the Hua restaurant looks like
one two three four five eight tiny pieces 
for three dollars and fifty cents so it's  
kind of small seems like a lot for 
whatever I paid um I honestly wish  
I got street food instead but I was at 
the mall so yep let's see how it tastes
um
very chewy with the pork so it's vermicelli 
um vermicelli noodles pork and some carrots
maybe some shrimp there I don't see the shrimp but  
what makes it so good is the peanut 
sauce the peanut sauce is bomb.com
wow look at that flood guys
