it's a very special beach
I love it
so now we are going on a new boat adventure
let's go to pink island
today we have a small boat so cute
program changed. they had no more small boat
that's why we had a hudge one yesterday
but today as then went back to the pier
they maybe find a small one
now the color of the water is becoming more and more beautiful
Pink Island, here we are
welcome to Pink Island !
That's it, the sand is a little bit pink here
and I think it's under the white sand that
there is the pink sand
look at this, you can see some orange and pink parts
here you see
it gives a color to the sand
so Vincent explained me the story about the pink sand
it's all around the island but I'm sure we can see it better in some specific places
We'll try to find it
you can see that here it's really pink compared to this
yes
this is white and this is pink
so if we dig a bit it's pink you think
demontration
the sand is white
you dig a bit
now it's really pink
we discover why the pink island is called the pink island
yes we can see it pretty well
you can see the thickness of the sand here
here you see the sand thickness and the beach doesn't seems to be pink
it seems to be fake
fake add
if you dig
all the beach
is pink
you don"t have to stop at the first impression
everytime you have to search more deeper.
it cracks here, you can remove the sand on the top
and you see the pink
it's a very special beach
I love it
It's very funny this concept of pink island
I find funny the fact that you have to dig
to see the pink of the beach
and the water once again is very blue
I think that wherever we are going on Balabac
The water will still be beautiful
it's maybe with this kind of pink shell
that the sand takes this color
beautiful
oh we found this fruit again
this one is a bit dark
it's really strange
a filippino told us that's this fruit is maybe not edible
it's funny because it's with a lots of little pieces
like the pomegranate
we are playing like kids, we just wrote Nomad France
in hudge on the beach
to try to write Nomad France in pink
on the pink island
on this island the trees are really different
it's funny, the wildlife is
it looks like the mangroves
the different trees here
they are
it's not trees with a lots of leaves. It's  trees
with the fruits, as we show you before
they looks like pomegrenate, pinapple, I don't know
so it's weird
I not sure that there are some people living on this island
But when I was flying with my drone before I saw some people
I went until the end of the island
and it was not the cleanest part
I think that this place is a bit like their dechettery
But what we understood was that
the island is cleaned once a month
So it was not cleaned yesterday for sure
I think they will clean it soon
so don't be surprised if the island is a bit dirty
I think it's a bit normal
It's really because it's cleaned once a month
it's the end of the adventure on pink island
go back on the boat
After a crazy morning
Amazing breakfast on Onok Island
Onok, you can see the video here, I'll put the link
now we'll take the boat again
go to our next island
I don't remember the name, as everytime
back on the boat
I'm just waiting Salomé, she has a new friend
And we have to complete the logbook before to go
so now we'll put our names ans we will pay
100PHP fees per pers
because it's an island where you have to pay 100PHP, but we can understand it
and that's it
100PHP is like 1,80€
it's ok, it's not cheap at all
to go on the island it's perfect
100 each
ohhh yes sorry
