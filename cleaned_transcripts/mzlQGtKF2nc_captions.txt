there was this little boat that goes away that goes in
world where you work where you need to
we have to go, and this is the classic paper boat that teaches us to be mum or dad
to play when it is raining to make him go to the street where the water forms
the first games you play as a child
which very much symbolizes everything that was written in the text, the family and union
that we live with them when they grow up, but as they grow up, the roads divide
