Original Filipino Street Food."

the only places you can get
authentic Filipino street food.
-The main reason
that brought us here
is the memory of what we had
in the Philippines over there.
Like, there will be, like,
literally a whole street
probably as wide as me
with stalls side by side.
This is actually a lot cleaner.
It's a lot more interactive.
-When I came to the States,
I was really looking for, like,
stuff that would
remind me of my home,
because I was really homesick
when I was studying,
and then I found out
Dollar Hits existed,

it's, like, fulfilling.

[ Indistinct conversations ]
Oh, man. Usually, in the
Philippines they prefer, like,
a sweet and vinegar style.
That's why they have a lot
of dipping sauces,
but this probably
fits the more American taste
because a lot of people
like salty and savory.
This is juicy as hell because,
like, in the Philippines,
they'll cut it nice and thin,
like, kind of like bacon strips.
This one, you know it's meat.
-How many balot?
-Three.
-Three?
-Yes.
-Three, three balot.

kind of savory inside,
like chicken but duck.

If you will get this,
you will get a straw.

like this.
So it has, like, liquid,

only in the street,
