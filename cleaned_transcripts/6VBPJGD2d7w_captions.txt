Hey guys, we're Asians Down Under
Today we're going to try a famous Filipino or Vietnamese food called Balut
I ain't ready, bro
So I heard it's a fertilized chicken
It's a duck fetus
Duck fetus
That's what we're eating
So I think if you guys enjoy your chicken
Enjoy your eggs
It's not the same, Rach
It's the phase in between
Alright, so we have a bin ready case one of us vomits
Alright let's do this
I don't even know how to do it
I heard you tap it on the top
On the top?
Like this?
Mine's not cracking
Is this how you do it?
I don't know how to open it
You crack it
And then you peel it
There's juice
So much juice
Very juicy
You're meant to peel it
Oh bro, this is hard. Are we doing it right?
Are we doing it right?
What, it's the other way?
Is that like chicken broth?
She's started
Oh it's nice!
I like it
It tastes like soup. Just like Chinese soup
We got it!
Is that an actual duck inside?
Oh yeah
Diane: It's not bad
Rach: It tastes like chicken broth. It's not that bad
Oh what's that?
Oh quick eat it eat it
Quick
Put salt on it
You're meant to suck the juice
Are you supposed to suck it?
Yeah you're meant to slurp the juice
Does it smell bad?
It's like a boiled egg and I'm just eating the egg yolk
I feel like it's just like chicken broth
I don't know I can just imagine
what it looks like already and it's really putting me off
It's alright
Cheers bro
How do you eat it?
Slurp it
What do you mean "slurp it?"
Drink some like a shot
What is this?
I do like the broth
It does taste quite nice
That's really...
Can you put salt for me please?
Sure
That's only the juice man
Oh you actually ate it?
Bro, you need to put salt
Here hold this, can you put salt?
I can taste duck
Put some salt
Can I have some too?
Salt us up, bro
Alright alright
Trust me this will make it so much better
Are you sure?
No
It doesn't look like it
Thank you
I need salt as well
Do I just keep peeling it?
Is this how you eat it?
Do you just put the whole thing in your mouth?
Right, how about we put the whole thing?
Just putting some salt
How about we take a bite so we can see
the..
Oh god
So sometimes like I've seen before when I've gone to the Philippines
Sometimes it still has feathers in it
So let's hope this one doesn't
That's an eyeball staring at me
You can see the veins
Is that a vein?
Is that a beak?
You can actually see it
It's a beak!
What is that?
I'll eat the yolk for now
Are we just taking a bite?
Or are we eating the whole thing?
Just a bite?
One big bite
Oh my god it's so soft
Are you ready?
Oh my god
How big is a bite? Like half of it?
Oh my god
They look like eyes
Is that an eye?
I don't want to eat that
Half of it
I'm going to lick my [finger]
Law: Half of it
Kirk: Half??
One big bite
Alright we'll go half
Ready?
You guys need to finish it
Finish it?
It's looking at me
I'm sorry guys I was wrong
It's nothing like eggs or chicken
Or duck
Eat the whole thing
Eat the whole thing then
How do you eat the beak?
Oh mine is splitting
I can't do this
It's a baby duck
It's next level
It's from a completely different universe
Phoebe's fine
She's killing it
So is this still the egg yolk?
Why is it yellow?
I'm going to have the yolk
It looks okay
It looks like a normal egg
Alright, we just need to eat, we're delaying too much
I'm eating this
Here. Ready?
What's that?
I don't know, half of mine fell off
Ready?
It's not like the chicken freaked out and opened its bowels inside the egg right?
 
Ew I don't like it
That was gross
The yolk is nice
I think the yolk is really nice
Cheers
Alright
Three, two, one
All of it
Three, two, one!
I like the yolk
But not the actual (duck)
Maybe mine is not as developed
Because I can just see yolk
It actually tastes quite good
The flavor is nice
Oh my god
Please don't let me see an eye
I can see an eye again
It's hard to see it
I don't eat my friends
I got it
It tasted like eating jelly
It was kind of chewy at the brown bit
Come back, Lawrence
If you're going to vomit, do it in front of the camera
I'm done
I'm still eating yolk
I've got so much yolk
The yellow part is fine
It actually tastes good
The yellow part is nice
I saw the intestines!
What's this?
What is this?
Oh that was disgusting
Holy sh**
I can do it. I can do this
Nah
I'm done
What is this?
It's like a little...
It's like the chicken saying [middle finger]
I'll finish this
I'll finish whatever this is
Show us, Rachel
Here Rachel, let's see yours
Hold it up
It's its intestines
I think I just saw an eye
And the intestines
This is sort of freaking me out
I don't know if I want to go a bit further
This is freaking me out, I don't want to go any further
I'm going clubbing tonight, I can't go smelling like this bro
Alright, I can do this
I'm a strong woman
You are a strong, independent woman
Fake it until you make it
Okay
It's actually not too bad
Did you eat the white part?
No
It was like the meat
Well, it's a NO from me, guys
Here, I'll feed it to you
No no no
The whole thing
Say "Ahhhh"
You can't eat the white part of it
I'm not meant to eat the intestines and the eye
I'm going to eat it
Alright
So
Alright I swallowed it
Good job, man
That was...
That was gross
It's not that bad
I think it's gross at the start
When you see it and you taste the --
Egg in your mouth
Yeah
Rach: I saw its intestines
Diane: I'm alright, that was okay
Diane ate it
 
Did you eat this part?
Yep, all gone
I've still got yolk left
I don't want to clean that up
Alright I'm done
Do you like it?
No
Alright
So at least one of us did it
Did you eat all of it?
Yep
Finished it? Oh wow
Yep
There's nothing left
That was actually okay
It's mind over matter
How is it?
Do you need water?
I'm never doing that again
Yes
I'm not eating that again
I'm a disgrace to Filipinos
Alright, cool
Alright
Are you guys ready?
You've just freaked us out
It actually tastes not bad
I really like the yellow part
Phoebe: Me too
You have to mentally be really strong
yep
I think just don't think about it
Just think about something else
And it's not as bad
It's not a food, it's a psychological game
You need to overcome yourself
It's actually not that bad
It's actually not that bad
I really liked the yolk
I wouldn't eat it again
But it was okay
It was alright
I think I would prefer to eat the egg yolk only
That slimy part
The intestines I can't do for a second time
No, I think we should just stick to normal eggs
You just have to be mentally strong
Hey guys, thanks for watching us do the balut challenge
