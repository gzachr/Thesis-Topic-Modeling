Where do you get these from?
The Philippines
But...
If you go down to Queens
There's a couple Filipino supermarkets that have these kinds of things, so...
What do you think about the flavor, what does it taste like to you?
It reminds me of something, I'm trying to think
Something I had before
I don't even know how to explain it
Somebody said it tasted like the butter in the AMC popcorn...
Yeah, that's what it is, it's like the buttered popcorn!
That's it, buttered popcorn!
Yeah
That's it!
Wow, guys
That was truly
An amazing experience
To be able to bring the SkyFlakes to New York City
And you know what? It was very interesting because
This is not a thing here, these cracker sandwiches
You know? 
And people really enjoyed them today
And that was really a lot of fun
And in particular
I would say
People liked the sweet...
Maha...maharlik...mahalika?
I forget how to say that
The sweet butter flavor, the most
That is today
NYC strangers' pick
For the most delicious
SkyFlakes flavor
And with that
You guys gotta subscribe
And I'll see you here next time
Bye bye guys!
