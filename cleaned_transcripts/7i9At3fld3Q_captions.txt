hi Gary here today we're visiting Malcapuya Island Coron Palawan
here we are at the Harbor right near
little hottie park now here's our boat
no not that one the one in the back
and finally we're on our way as you can
see a few people have already fallen
asleep
hmm what did cheche say them Malcapuya Island Coron Palawan
Island Coron dead ahead
and this is where we were abandoned if
you read our blog post you'll know the
story behind this
we wondered around for a good ten
minutes before we found the other
members of our party who lucky for they
ever had arrived from the first boat
half an hour before us but without said
the island is amazing there's plenty of
things to do see and experience
I love sand I love the sea I love the
color
I love to return back to melkor puia
island one day with the full citizen
Oakland gear and a full day to enjoy us
we didn't get to spend a lot of time of
Melkor pea island we only had an hour
and that hour also included eating lunch
but I still rape Malcapuya Island Coron Palawan
as one coron island that is a must-see
so when you're looking at the itinerary
of your Coronel and to make sure it
includes Mel Kapoor your Island
it's well worth the visit
all my faults and whirling motion you
were there to take it up you poured it
out into the ocean because she can't
keep it when I fall yeah when I fall
