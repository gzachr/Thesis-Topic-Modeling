vocalists from philippines as well so today
we are going to look at moira de la torre
and her rendition of oh holy night so the
first time i reacted to maura was my reaction
to paul bayer which we all know how that went
down um that was definitely some tears included
because come on the song and the whole video
was such a tearjerker i really loved that
she had such a fundamentally different approach
to singing and to storytelling through the
singing and other singers so i was very excited
when some of you guys recommended me to check
her oh holly knights during my christmas week
so let's get into that now if you are interested

further ado moira de la torre and her oh holy
night all right let's get into it [Music]
this is a recording with a live band you know
that i am a huge fan of those it was probably
my most favorite ones ah there she is let's
go [Music]
oh this is very a typical rendition i like
it [Music]
[Music] ah this is gorgeous [Music] the stars
are brightly
[Music]
notice how she was not actually dragging the
e but she chose to open the eye so no shining
but she chose to open the brighter vowel
such a good choice
[Music] was
[Music]
[Music]
[Music] oh it's beautiful but a second voice
[Music]
i always adored um 
that she does not go for heavy build or very
very very rarely and she is currently continuously
in her upper mix she's staying there she's
making it very very soft and very warm and
uh it's beautiful because it's such an angelic
it's a christmas song so it if you start with
such a soft approach it does build up the
atmosphere and she knows exactly what you
think i'm very excited for like you can feel
the atmosphere you're building up so i'm just
so excited for how it's gonna continue but
i love the second voice as well it is very
very like in the tiny doses but it's enough
that's enough to actually create a nice effect
[Music]
truly
[Music]
is
[Music]
[Music]
of joy
is [Music]
[Music]
oh
[Music]
beautiful [Music]
so for this time she chose a much much fuller
approach which again um filipinos love to
build build up the atmosphere build up the
song and uh they don't ever go flat they do
know how to build the song from the ground
up to that highest tension highest emotion
so um you could hear the audible difference
warm a tiny bit of husky a lot of earth and
singing which she was actually utilizing the
second time so much cleaner toe tone coming
through and uh overall that one tiny switch
that she did there was from the clean tone
switch and back into the clean and that was
beautiful because i genuinely um expected
that she one would to go into hat voice but
she immediately reconnected to the full voice
which i really really really liked there was
there was nice detail that she had there [Music]
[Music]
now she calmed it up it's not the end of the
song you would expect okay so we're done but
this is kind of a midsection so from the drive
the momentum that they kind of gained she
completely tamed it out sank it in a head
voice so it's not too big not too loud
[Music]
and you can feel it rising again slowly
it's gorgeous [Music] foreign
[Music] is
[Music]
now this is in her upper mix area so what
she's doing is that she started with a lot
of breath through so there's not that much
of resistance so it's very super light but
now she is building it up so it's cleaning
that the volume slowly and just adding a lot
of uh heaviness into it slowly step by step
each repetition 
a little more [Music]
[Music]
is
[Music]
[Music]
is
[Music]
is [Music] foreign [Music]
[Music]
absolutely gorgeous rendition of that song
i really love this one this might be one of
my faves actually of that song it was so atypical
but it worked so incredibly well i do have
highlights from this video so don't click
off yet we are going to go through and check
what i think was really like the best of the
video but one thing i want to mention right
now and that is actually the very last part
where she was saying [Music]
so she started with she was the whole time
she was actually in her mix but this was such
a stunning example of how breath can change
everything and the way breath pressures or
you pressure the breath and how you utilize
it to create a bigger and bigger bigger sound
um fantastic example so when you're putting
a lot of arithmetic [Music] and you start
adding a little bit of pressure with air and
every single repetition she was adding a little
bit more and more and it created this huge
buildup of the atmosphere it was completely
gorgeous you could just close your eyes and
swing along with her it was beautiful until
we got to full wish you could finally develop
into that gorgeous heavy vibrato it was so
so well utilized and especially when you have
a songs where you have a lot of repetitions
this approach is absolutely fantastic and
it's gonna sound great because it's just never
gonna sound the same every repetition is gonna
be slightly different and um also my big plus
what she did at the very end is and i'm gonna
replay [Music]
[Music]
this is the last repetition [Music]
is [Music] here [Music] imagine you would
be opening the the word here a lot of singers
especially beginning singers e is quite enclosed
vowel so what she's doing is she's morphing
into e e which is so much better to open so
she's not getting stuck in here here but she's
like here here which is letting her open that
and create a beautiful tiny like beautiful
vibrato like in a tiny dose at the very end
of the here
but such a good opener because normally if
we would pronounce it in the singing just
as we pronounce it in the like a normal life
we would be like here but that's just here
it's so stuck and our our jaw is completely
locked when we're saying that so here yeah
so much better it sounds so much more open
overall i love this rendition because it was
very different i loved the composition of
the instruments as well very typical maybe
for christmas song everybody's using carols
everybody's using very typical christmas c
sound and this was actually a very different
approach to it it a little bit reminded me
of when sarah g sang where are you there very
very similar composition not composition but
like the composition of the instruments i
loved it i think moira is a very very talented
singer she doesn't know her strengths and
she just thinks about what she's doing she
thinks about her singing and she puts a lot
of effort and detail into really perfecting
the sound throughout the whole song so i i
did not expect any less from her and i was
just very pleasantly surprised here again
so i enjoyed it a lot and i hope you enjoyed
the video as well if you did don't forget
to subscribe right here here's the video that
youtube actually recommended for you and here
is the rest of my filipino reactions so please
stay safe and healthy i'll see you next time
bye
