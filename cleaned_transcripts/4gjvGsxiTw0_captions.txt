Camera rolling...
The Spanish ruled the Philippines 
for over 300 years !
until the end of the 19th century
and during this time, we made a big mark
on the Filipino language
buuuuut
does this mean that the Spanish and
Filipinos can understand each other ?
let's find out...
Although the Philippines were occupied
by the Spanish for such a long time
the official language of the Philippines is still...
buuut...
after travelling around the 
Philippines for 1 month
we realised there are lots of things
that were introduced during the colonization
and haven't really changed since
for example...the names
such as the president
the boxer
and the famous singer
or...clothes
and basically anything to do 
with food and cutlery...
and there are other words where
the pronunciation and spelling 
have been slightly changed
(SPANISH : EL PASILLO)
(SPANISH : VIERNES)
(SPANISH : VIAJEROS)
so basically, when it comes to vocabulary...
there are LOTS of similarities
however, although they use lots of Spanish words
Filipino is still very different to Spanish
because Filipino has also been 
influenced by other languages
in particular...
Malay
Chinese
and more recently English
therefore neither the grammar
nor the pronunciation
is similar to Spanish
as an example in this sentence...
it is simple to recognise 
the word 'ba침o' (toilet)
but apart from that
you can't understand a thing!
MIA : we can't do video ?
SECURITY : Picture only
SECURITY : We allow picture only
am i faking it okay ?
yeh that is pretty good
come on, let's film quickly 
before he comes back !
In conclusion we can say that no...
we can't understand Filipino
only a few words
and the Filipinos ?
Do you understand Spanish ?
NO
anything ?
NO haha
some words when you speak
and some words when you write it
Hablo espa침ol un poquito !
Nooo
things...
like pantal칩n and cintur칩n
Do you speak or understand Spanish ?
No, no, no
No, no, no, no way (singing)
hahahaha
Oh no, here he comes
give me a kiss
so it looks like we are taking a photo
