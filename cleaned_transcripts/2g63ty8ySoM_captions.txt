But  we go on, on, I'd 
like to to you an t from excerp
Tim Keller, he wrote a book 
unintentional preaching models, 
and this says about this 
particular incident that he had 
with his brother in law. 
just I'm going to read it to 
So this you. is not my brother  
law. This is Tim 's Keller
brother in law, he said. My r 
brothein law would never wear 
a seat belt in the car I 
belated him for it, then 1 
he pickedday.  me up at the air 
and his he had on 
seat his belt and shoulder heig 
in it. And I ask what ed happen 
What you? then and his 
brother in law, said. I went to 
visit a friend mine of in the 
hospital who was in a 
accident car and went through t 
windshmy brotheand r in said 
law, had two he 300 or es

I went but when I went to the

got new no ation informbut the  
informI had  becamenew informat 
The got real to my 
heart finally and sat down and 
affected the way I live now 
many things hear we ed preach
today, perhaps is new not to us 
but until it alive in comes 
heart, our then it gives to us. 
meaning maybe in our heart own  
in own way, we Jesus 
Christknow  rose from the grave 
until becomes in real our 
life, we can never  come really
to the throne of the and Lord 
say Lord thank you for iming me 
proclato be not 
guilty, know and you that's the 
essencof today's message. 
can We also say the same thing 
with the word of God when 
we like the read word of God, 
remindlet's  ourselves to ask t 
Lord Lord. What are you 
teaching me? What are 
remindyou ing me what of are yo 
correcting me or what are you 
admonish? From me, oh lord. 
what are you trying to  reveal
yourself to me in your word? so 
going back to Corinthians first 
chapter fifteen can we see 
Paul that was reminding the 
Christians in h Corintthe about 
resurrof the Lord Jesus 
Christ now as far as 
resurrectionthe  of the Lord Je 
Christis it seems it 
somethis ing that they already 
know, okay, are They already of 
aware it. The resurrection the  
of Jesus Christ was an 
event to themselves that they 
cannot. know They it let me 
read passage some to you First 
Corinthians r fifteechapten. 
verse to four  eight.Let me 
read that to you. 
Paul 
So sayingwas  
resurrectionthe  of the Lord Je 
Christan event that you 
know. it happened There'it. s a 
lot of weaknesses that has seen 
that Paul and ned mentionames 
that they knew okay. know 
he You was by seen he he seen 
by was James and then he said a 
if  want reallyto verify it 
or if you want to convince 
someone about the ectionresurr 
of the Lord, ChristJesus  and  
you'relooking for a witness, 
there still are witnesses 
during the that this time is 
live, you can go to them. Ask 
them to verify if the the 
is true event or not, and then 
finally y, finallPaul says you 
can also ask me gh I'm althouli 
not  myselfup. I'm the 
chief of sinners, but if you 
would ask I me, saw him 
the also ected resurrChrist. an 
now, said, I he know that you 
know Jesus Christ's ection
resurr as a matter of 
fact, I have preached that to 
you isn't it then he ues contin
You know it. I know  you're
you're not denying it, but 
however, how come some of you? 
Still e believthat there's a 
resurrection of dead the first 
Corinthians 1512 what he so 
said. if now  Christis preached 
that raisedbeen  from dead. 
the How do some among you 
say is no there resurrection of 
the dead? How come some of you 
still say that there's no 
resurrection with the one the l 
possibexplanation of this 
passage comes from the 
explanation of John hur. Macart
It's not that the Christians 
were rejecting the resurrection 
of the Lord. Jesus Christ. It's 
not that they not believdo e it 
perhapare sayingthey , of 
course, we believe it's 
it's just that that whatever 
happened to Christ that is l. 
speciaPerhaps it's ing someth
good him. for he resurrected 
from the dead, s the perhapsame 
thing that happened has with s 
Lazaruer RemembLazarus, he 
resurrected s. LazaruIt's a me t
one-ti a special 
miracle for them, but the then 
Christians didn't e realizthe a 
implicChrist's ection 
resurrfor them. Okay. 
Maybe they're thinking it's 
good for them, but not. it's I 
mean it's okay for I know us. 
we are not going to resurrect 
but it's good them. for 
happy I'm for them. They 
didn't just e the realizthe of 
resurrection of Christ them to  
and affects them First hians fie
Corintn. 
nineteen to it okay reads. but 
there is if no resurrection of  
dead then  is Christnot risen. 
And if Christ is that reason, 
then our preaching is empty and 
your faith is empty. also Yes 
and we are found false 
witnesses of God because we 
have testified of God that 
raisedhe  up Christ, whom he di 
not in if fact that 
they do not for rise if the 
dead do not rise, then Christ 
is not risen if Christand  is 
not risen, faith is your 
futile, are you still in your 
sins, then those also who have p
fallen in Christ have ed 
perishverse in nineteen if 
in this life. we Only have hope 
in Christ we are of all men the 
most. what does it mean? so 
Paul was explaining if do you 
not believe there is no 
resurrection. Then it also 
means Jesus Christ did not ect 
resurrHe he  even didn'tect you 
resurrwould not and 
he if didn't ect, then resurryo 
would also not be resurrected 
from the dead. It's like 
we are then just wasting our 
being time Christians. There'Ok 
no hope for us then. you 
would If not be resurrected fro 
the dead, then wastinwe're g 
our time ing preachJesus Christ 
to as a matter of fact it 
would not be true that Jesus 
Christ resurrected we will be  
liars.I mean it's waste a of be 
time ians Christremember 
that what he says there If in 
this life only have we hope 
Christin . then all of men we a 
pity other In words there's no 
use being Christian if 
Christ Jesus is did not rise. s 
no There'point in coming here e 
Sunday right. a It's waste of 
time First now hians 
chapteCorintr fifteen. It's a 
very very long r chaptecomposed 
58 verses I would and like 
thank to Paul spent  really
considerable time expounand d 
to the Christians in Corinth, 
the ation implicof Christ's 
resurrection. because. 
believing in Christ's 
resurrection s that impliethey 
would also be resurrected by 
God e becausthe victory of 
Jesus Christ over death is also 
your victory. death Over 
eventuand ally whole point the 
poll of for this chapter was se 
expresthe verse of last 
this chapter verse Fifty-eight  
is said. This is 
whole the point. Why he is ded 
expounabout importance the 
of 's resurrChristection verse 
fifty-eight? therefore, my 
beloved en be brethrsteadfast b 
immova alwaysing aboundin 
the work of lord the g knowin
that your labor is not in 
in vain the Lord. see that. Sai 
telling you about the 
resurrection of the Lord Jesus 
Christ that you so will be not 
discouraged and talkinhe's g to 
Christwho are y 
laborialreadng are doing who th 
ministry for the Lord and yet 
somewhere in the back of their 
mind, it seems that they are 
thinking. when they die, they 
die and that's it. But 
Paul then tells them well. No, 
know a you  about littlehaving 
faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, 
But it's also true that when 
Christ ected resurryou will 
also be ected and resurrI'm 
telling you so that will you be 
encouryour labor not is in 
vain every. 
And the Bible and I'm 
tellinsays, g you this so you w 
be ast. steadfwould be you ble. 
immovaWe even have hymn a 
about this are familiyou ar 
with him. He I shall says. not 
be shall I be moved not I shall 
not be. I shall be not moved 
just the like tree. that's 
planted by the water. I so 
shall not be moved. Immovable. 
In other words. That's 
picture the of a christian's wh 
bombaris ded lots with tests ofs
and  from left and right 
top to  front bottomand back, 
but he decides. I will not be 
moved he strongis  in the Lord 
so the message of resurrection 
is a message of victory for all 
believers to believers, all say 
Amen. Amen. Amen. Praise God 
the resurrection of the Lord 
Jesus Christ is so important 
and it is so significant that 
if it did not happen, s 
no there'point a being Christia 
after all Paul and even says 
that did if not happen, know 
if you  did Christdie and 
resurrected from grave,the  
then we should. our Spend time 
eating and ng drinki
marryiand ng because tomorrow y 
will die. That's the context 
that I of mean. first hians Cort
1532. first hians Corint1532 
beat it says there. If the dead 
do not rise, let us drink and u 
let eat and drink for 
tomorrow. We die, you know 
have just a good time. That's w 
Paul was saying and. and in 
modern our day philosophy, we h 
heard lots of s, clichesaying 
you know. do what you call 
what's this s? enjoy clicheyour 
life still can have heard 
you that have your enjoy 
life while you still can when 
will you enjoy your life when 
you are y alreadold or when you 
are. The meaning weak I'm I'm 
not  if sayingyou're old,  not 
you'reenjoying your life, 
but I'm  if sayingyou don't 
have time anymore well so. To 
me, I extra a can cal practi
message to as that Christa ian 
who is a believer of the 
I lord, would say message the m 
need I to what I do can do now. 
Okay. Share the gospel Now. 
That's what I'm , sayinging the 
redeemtime but for 
someone has not who ed accept. 
Christdoes What message that he 
say tells them to enjoy life 
to the fullest and  forget
everything that would be 
destruction for. 
was 
Paul blishireestang the ance of 
importectionresurr to 
the believers in Corinth they 
will not be raged discouthat 
they would keep on doing their 
labor for the Lord and that 
they would not think their 
labor is for nothing that if 
you miss out in the enjoyment 
in this world, you're 
actualnot ly missing out anythi 
becausare ng spendiyour 
life on your and your time 
something on that is not vain. 
That's. Paul was telling to the 
believers first Corinthians 
1520 first Corinthians 1520, no 
but Christ is risen from 
the dead has and become the fru 
first those of who have  
fallen asleepNow, Christ is and 
risen he has become the 
first fruit of those have who  
fallenasleep the the term 
first fruit is agricultural 
term It means when have a you 
first fruit, it means you have  
bountiharvest. it is. 
many more That  thingswill come 
after it it and is a time 
giving of thanks God's to ion 
provisthat he remembers 
that he s. blesseThat's 
fruit. for okay. is It also a n 
ceremoterm, You the 
the know priest would gather 
bundle a of first the fruit and 
he would wave it and he is ing 
conveya message that the 
entire harvest belongs to him s 
belongto God and Jesus. 
And after knowing that Jesus is 
the first fruit of those who 
have fallen asleep, it 
means then many are more coming 
after him. other people people 
who will be ing acceptChrist. 
They also be resurrected 
brothers and sisters. Think 
about this. does it how apply 
in our evangelistic crusade? 
What's next? let's do this
