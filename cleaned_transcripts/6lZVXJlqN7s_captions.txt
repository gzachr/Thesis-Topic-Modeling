 
the Philippines home for the next five weeks
we'll be backpacking around these Paradise
Islands together
we're here for some special reasons the main
one being to visit some of the most beautiful
islands on planet Earth
as well as attempting to climb Mount Apo the
highest Summit in the country
also explore the historical streets of Manila
will go on week-long Expeditions on traditional
Filipino sailing vessels all right all in
the search to find out is it really fun in
the Philippines [Music] and 
because the locals here love to sing and obsess
about karaoke we're probably going to be having
a good old sing song along the [Music] I'm
so excited to share with you the backpacking
scene here this country has opened up a new
side in me and it's a side I really like
welcome to the next level searching Paradise
in the Philippines
[Music]
welcome to Manila population of over 14 million
people and one of Southeast Asia's mega cities
and of course this is the perfect place to
begin our adventures in the country [Music]
okay I thought a good place to start our journey
across this beautiful country was to start
here in the monument in the middle of the
park in the middle of downtown Manila and
just sort of very quickly touch on the history
of the Philippines so that it gives us a little
bit of context to exactly what we're seeing
and what we're going to experience here so
obviously the Philippines was sort of discovered
if you want to say that firstly by indigenous
Indonesians indigenous malays obviously that
gives us the Asian persuasion that we're all
used to here with the locals and then the
Spanish is heavily influenced their language
and a lot of their culture and architecture
which I'm sure we'll see today in the old
quarter and of course because the Americans
were here too they have this cute American
accent they're really into baseball and basketball
here and there's a Big Slice of American culture
in this country it's a real Melting Pot the
Philippines is 7 000 islands and it's had
Asian Spanish American you know influences
over the years it's going to be a real change
of pace for us to be here so let's explore
the Spanish quarter the old quarter and see
what else we can find and learn just as we're
getting to know Manila and setting the scene
for what we're going to experience here in
the Philippines [Music] foreign
get to a new destination than just going out
on a stroll seeing what you can see smelling
all the new smells and trying to get a grasp
of the place yeah just getting your walking
shoes on going for a walk getting lost engaging
your senses I think it's the best way to start
any trip however today was Bloody hot Manila
is a sweaty place and so walking around in
the midday sun was not really an option so
I ducked into a very interesting Museum place
was really interesting guys let me explain
a little bit more about what I learned here
okay the national museum of natural history
free entry and very nice I really liked all
of the representations of all the animals
that live here in the Philippines and then
there's lots of other monuments lots of other
installations that teach you about the geography
the lava flows the volcanoes in this country
looks like the whole place is about to blow
up which is a little bit disconcerting fingers
crossed it doesn't happen on this trip another
little thing that I just saw observed over
the past day or two that I've been here just
walking around the streets of vanilla it's
just and I'll just briefly touch on this but
if you see behind me um behind me over my
shoulder here every street seemingly seems
to be kind of uh occupied by people people
just sort of living on the street selling
things I think they're sleeping rough I think
a lot of people just live out live out on
the streets here hustling trying to make money
so it's just an observation I also I want
to see if I can get a Jeep setting up oh hi
um does this go to uh the Manila Cathedral
no no go straight or that's it so okay thank
you thank you yeah I want to get one of these
Jeeps these are cool right very colorful and
probably very cheap [Music] here's the world
famous jollibee's this is like a fast food
chain all over the Philippines apparently
it's very very popular with the Filipinos
and you can tell because it's absolutely packed
in there
so I didn't find a Jeep but I found an e-trike
very cool little mobile and 20 pesos to get
to the other side of town [Music]
15 minutes later that was quite far actually
good value for money for 20 pesos also the
driver a really nice guy he told me his life
story really interesting life we used to live
in Israel and he was a big time chef and then
he got sick and he had to come back and they
canceled his Visa so now he's working as a
taxi driver it was a pleasure to meet you
my friend and good luck with your new venture
we are here Manila Cathedral we'll have a
good little look around here but I do want
to get a drink I'm very thirsty what's this
guy got here
[Applause]
maybe after hours yeah I will give you the
money when I come back okay no problem oh
that's cold and sweet and delicious
obviously with the Spanish being here for
over 300 years of course they brought with
them Catholicism and this is the largest church
in the city the Cathedral of Manila and inside
it was magnificent it's actually been destroyed
and rebuilt over eight times in its history
it began actually as little bamboo Hut just
here in the Town Square but of course over
the years hundreds of years of this existence
it's developed been knocked down developed
been blown up developed burnt down and it's
standing in its current form here and inside
it was really nice there was actually midday
Mass so I actually sat down and joined um
about half of it I was raised Catholic so
it was nice to sit down and just hear prayer
a few hymns I'm not religious anymore but
I thought I'd give it a go see if I don't
know see if I had some sort of Enlightenment
moment but nothing struck me down but it was
nice to be in there really nice to hear the
beautiful organ playing and the Filipino people
singing and hemming away it's quite a nice
experience actually I was I had to like pre-trip
Jitters as I always do anxiety creeping in
leaving Thailand coming to a new country there's
always that little underlining fear I'm glad
okay [Music]
[Music] I was feeling so unsure about leaving
home I just flew in for the first time
all the sights and sounds so new to me did
I make the right choice I don't know drop
the bags off I'm going to explore I can feel
the rushes
I can't believe I'm worried at all [Music]
I'm getting lost and I love it [Music] I'm
going missing for a while I'm getting lost
and I love it
I'm going to miss him for a while
[Music] thank you [Music]
[Music] [Applause] [Music]
okay nice little sing song but I'm still lost
do you know where the fort Santiago is yes
that's useful you go right turn right okay
turn right then turn left perfect don't be
straight thank you okay
I'm getting lost in no no no hey guys this
is like the national sport basketball man
it's nice when you you know walk these streets
nice and quiet actually in the old town not
much traffic so thumbs up for walking around
and when you stop to buy a bottle of water
hello hello when you stop to buy a bottle
of water please everyone speaks English here
which is great
um so just walking around people are speaking
Filipino then they switch to English everyone
seems really friendly
yeah I absolutely fell in love with this part
of Manila the Spanish quarter there's so much
history here and so much atmosphere the Cobble
streets the colorful buildings and the really
friendly locals it was just a great place
to be I must have explored every street of
the old quarter I just got so lost and so
happy here every little nook and cranny and
just having a little nosy at the local food
see what they were cooking see what they were
selling on the streets and it looked delicious
actually and I really like this little candy
store I found on the side of the street just
looked really interesting I love the way that
they displayed the candies just in their plastic
boxes really cool the streets here were just
full of life people walking around hanging
out playing basketball just this place was
alive and kicking and I loved every second
of being in the old quarter my favorite part
of Manila for sure [Music]
I'm not a big fan of using Google Maps when
you're trying to find somewhere in a labyrinth
like this because part of it as the song mentions
is getting lost that's the fun part um but
in the end yeah I did actually have to get
Google Maps out because these streets are
difficult to navigate and I really wanted
to find the fort if you're new here by the
way welcome my name's Paddy hit subscribe
and join us we like to express ourselves and
have fun whilst traveling on this channel
I'm just really excited guys I'm so excited
to be in a new place anyway enough about that
we found Fort Santiago and well let me explain
a little bit more because this place was magical
okay we made it to the beautiful looking Fort
I'm really looking forward to exploring inside
here I've been talking a lot and a little
bit of singing so I think I'll give you guys
a little bit of a break give your ears a break
so I'm gonna head in I'll give you some factual
information and text because there's a lot
of interesting stories in here but because
there's actually like buskers outside and
they're singing in Filipino some beautiful
songs I've just recorded this guy's singing
an absolutely gorgeous song I have no idea
what it's about but it was very emotional
so I'll play that for you now while I go in
and you can learn about the fault and not
listen to me but listen to him [Music]
[Music]
[Music] foreign
[Music]
[Music] you know
[Music]
[Music] I'm here
[Music] [Applause] foreign
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
[Music]
[Music] [Applause] [Music]
[Music] no no [Music] no no
no no no no no [Music] no no it's amazing
what you can find on Google Maps
just zoomed in I was like I want to be near
the marina I want to be somewhere where I
can watch sunset together look at this beautiful
this place is packed I can't believe I got
a table seafood restaurant lovely jumping
[Music]
thank you
actually when I was flying the Drone just
to sort of get perspective of this area in
the distance is a really big fire somewhere
in the city I hope everyone's okay it looks
really big looks really really big so I hope
it's not like a big disaster somewhere in
the other side of the city so that was quite
worrying so fingers crossed everyone's okay
um but it's also quite nice because over in
this direction you can see the fishermen hauling
in their catch for the afternoon and they
seem to do quite well so yeah first day in
Manila so far has been brilliant
[Music] foreign [Music]
[Music]
different part of the city here in Manila
this is called the BGC which is one of the
newest areas of the city and you can tell
the second you get into this area that this
is modern clean organized and very impressive
actually I'm highly impressed just walking
around exploring the streets and stuff like
that very very cool very very nice my favorite
thing actually was walking through they have
obviously these beautiful glass and steel
structures these big high-rise Condominiums
Apartments offices it does feel like a completely
different city it feels like we've flown into
a suburb of Sydney or a very beautiful expensive
Western City but around it in the outskirts
there's quite a lot of charming character
this place isn't as sterile as I thought it
was going to be it's actually it's very very
nice and extremely livable I think some nice
cars here too
yeah the begc this area of Manila very clean
very organized feels very safe and yeah I
rate it highly it's very modern kind of feels
like you're in Singapore or somewhere this
is an area that a lot of foreigners in the
Philippines are based in and I can see why
and yeah it's impressive
[Music]
okay so I've popped into another area of the
modern new part of the city and I've come
to this mall just to sort of check it out
because look they've kind of created this
whole mall to look a little bit like Venice
you can get on a little Gondola and up and
down take pictures it's kind of just restaurants
here you know every single franchise going
McDonald's Taco Bell Burger King TGI Fridays
they're all here you can get Thai food here
which is good I had some pacapao yeah I was
getting hungry and yeah it's quite nice it's
a bit of a gimmick but I would come here if
you were looking to get some food get some
home Comforts maybe the Venice Grand Mall
I think it's called not quite sure but anyway
let's keep exploring this area check these
guys out
as far as a tourist destination goes if you're
visiting Manila I mean it's okay the BGC you
walk around the streets and there's a few
malls and things but the most interesting
the most valuable thing in this area for a
tourist perspective anyway is the cemetery
let me explain
[Music] foreign
yeah this place was incredible I didn't do
any vlogging here I just got a few Clips on
my phone to be respectful but this World War
II Cemetery contains the graves of over 17
000 men and women and the names of over 36
000 people who went missing during many battles
in the southeast Asia region it's the largest
of All-American overseas cemeteries and over
150 acres with the beautiful skyline of the
BGC as the backdrop most who lost their lives
did so here in the Philippines in Papua New
Guinea and in Southeast Asia region in general
during the second world war it's magnificently
done and the grounds are impeccable and you
know seeing the names of the soldiers is just
mind-blowing how many they are and they're
etched in Marble you know when you see your
own names there just becomes a little bit
more real and connects and hits a little bit
harder and what was really nice is because
it was in the afternoon at five o'clock they
lowered the Philippine flag and then the American
flag with the beautiful American trumpet War
song just really an interesting place to come
if you're in the BGC
foreign [Music] [Applause]
[Music]
from the cemetery was a rooftop bar and actually
overlooked below to the cemetery and the streets
of Manila itself a great place to have a beer
and just kind of reflect on the experience
[Music]
I'm just going to finish this beer and I'm
going to take you for dinner somewhere really
unique really really really really really
unique and highly recommended so I'll take
you there I'll show you dinner and I'll give
you my final thoughts on this massive Metropolis
when we leave tomorrow morning but so far
so good
[Music] hi hello
[Applause]
so welcome to the Singing Cooks and waiters
restaurant so this place came recommended
to me by Will and Jose and they said this
is one of the best things they did in the
entire country it's just a restaurant on the
side of the road but the waiters the chefs
the front of house staff they put everything
down they stop cooking they stop serving you
drinks and they just sing and they sing for
about 10 or 15 minutes and then they get back
to work
it's just very Filipino very beautiful they
can sing amazing but let me just see how they
can cook first before I give it a full recommendation
but this is yeah this is an amazing experience
okay what do I order Ed
wow
I'm really struggling to look at the menu
because it's too much fun
all right
[Applause]
hey
together
[Music]
I'm sorry
[Applause] eventually the food came out and
look it didn't look the best you know it wasn't
like Gourmet style but this is the Filipino
way it's just Rough and Ready and full of
flavor I had this coconut cream curry with
pumpkin and green beans and just delicious
and fried chicken of course and you cover
everything with gravy and like I said it didn't
look much but tasted great full of garlic
and then I had this delicious mango ice cream
thing really cool really like the food kind
of reminded me of Hawaii and that kind of
Island theme I can see a lot of American influence
in the Filipino food already and just a great
restaurant 100 recommend this place
[Music] okay it's time to leave Manila I've
had a really good time here to be fair I heard
a lot of things I heard a lot of people say
you know Skip Manila skip Manila just get
straight to the islands get straight to the
adventure but I think Manila isn't an adventure
there's a lot of history there's a lot of
beauty here the people have been really friendly
and you know if you're flying in Long Haul
you know if you're flying in from Europe or
the states I just think it's too much to fly
all the way to Manila and then immediately
connect to another flight I think you should
take a couple of days and explore the city
the old quarter is definitely where the history
and the culture is and then the BGC is obviously
a much more modern area obviously Manila is
a huge Metropolitan City with so much more
than just what we've seen in this video you
know I've only just scraped the surface so
come here find your own adventure and explore
more of the city and let me know what you
think I'm off to the airport I've just left
my hotel my hotel was shocking by the way
it had no hot water it had bugs in the room
loud music in the mornings from people working
out outside and it was a decent hotel it was
about forty dollars a night so um yeah didn't
have a good experience in the hotel so I didn't
share with you my room or the hotel because
I can't recommend it
um yeah anyway um we're going to our first
Paradise Island today and in the next episode
I'll be sharing with you lots of Adventures
and here's a slice of what's to come I hope
you enjoyed episode one if you're new here
