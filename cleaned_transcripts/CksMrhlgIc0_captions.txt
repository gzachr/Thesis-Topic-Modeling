It was most terrifying moment

It was most terrifying moment
im still shaking abit

Is it Gracija, right?
The scariest thing that it seems like you not going to stop right?
It seems like i'll gonna hit that wall so hard
I though, i'm heavy, im heavy so probably they'r not gonna stop me
damn, poor Mantas, nobody will record him from behind, but it's ok, he got gopro aswell
That face, of everyone before the stop
yeah, i were scared aswell so much
i were thinking that i'll gonna hit somewhere there

So, Mantas, the scariest part was the end, no?
