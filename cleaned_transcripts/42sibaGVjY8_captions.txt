- [Guy] So what is that?
(speaking in foreign language)
(indistinct talking)
- [Guy] What is that?
- [Guy] Here's the salt
- Okay, shall I do it?
Okay.
- [Xiaoma] Go for it.
You've made it this far, might as well--
(people softly screaming and laughing)
Three, two, one, what's
going on everybody?
Welcome back to the international
Xiaomanyc Food TV, YouTube show.
It is our job on this food YouTube show
to bring food from all around the world
to Times Square, NYC and see
what people think about them.
But today guys, I need to tell you,
I personally, am feeling
a little bit anxious
for this video.
'Cause today, we're doing something
that I've never done before.
I've never eaten this thing before.
And for me, it's a little bit...
a little bit nerve-racking, I have to say.
So if you're wondering what the special
food is today,
it is actually a Filipino
snack food called balut.
And ah, I'm sorry I know
I'm very anxious because
this is my first time actually
ever seeing this thing.
We just got it from a restaurant
in the East Village (NYC),
it's a Filipino restaurant,
and they've already cooked it for us.
They also colored them
a little bit for Easter,
so it's a little bit of
an Easter Special video.
And now, before we give them
to people in the street here,
I am gonna try it for the first time.
Here we go.
Ah, so what is balut?
Balut is just an egg.
It's a duck egg but
inside the egg there is a,
from what I'm told, an actual
fermented fertilized duck embryo.
So, I don't exactly know what that means,
but we're gonna find out, okay.
So first, you crack the
base open, like this.
(egg cracking)
Okay, now I just open it up.
(gasp) Oh sh*t guys.
So that is the duck embryo.
Oh, man.
Got a little egg and you have the duck.
So let's give it a little smell.
Smells kind of salty.
The first step I heard is, you gotta,
try the...gotta try the liquid.
I'm so nervous!
No it's okay, go.
Oh, okay the liquid is actually not bad,
It's like, umm...
The liquid tastes a
little bit like a savory
chicken soup, like a duck soup.
Oh my god, there it is.
That's it, that's an actual
baby duck inside of this.
We are gonna try the duck egg first.
(Smashed glass)
Not so bad alright,
I could deal with it.
Now I have to actually
try the duck...part...
No, we're gonna do this together.
This is for you.
And for me so I can learn about food
from other cultures.
Here we go.
(screaming)
Wow, actually do you know what?
That's not bad.
That's actually not bad.
The taste is actually very mild,
it's not stinky or anything like that.
Anyway guys, today we're gonna go,
and find some strangers,
and see what they think about
this amazing food called balut.
Let's go.
It's called Balut.
- Yeah.
- Have you ever heard of Balut before?
- Filipino...
- First time.
- Yes it's a Filipino street food.
What it is, so we just got this
fresh from a restaurant.
- Wow.
- It's a duck egg,
with the actual embryo inside.
So if you want to take one,
I can show you how to do it.
- You want me to take it slow
or can I go fast with this?
- You can go fast.
You can put salt with it, I think it
improves the flavor a little bit.
- Okay.
- The main thing about it is,
it looks kind of strange.
But the flavor is actually totally fine.
- Eh.
- So yeah.
- I'll try it.
- And when you do this you kind of
crack that open.
- Oh, okay!
- Yep.
- Damn.
- Right, be careful.
(laughing)
- This is so weird.
- The soup you can drink first
That's the best part I think.
- Bottoms up.
(laughing)
- Woah, careful!
There is yolk in there,
as well as the actual embryo.
- Okay.
- And we're curious to see
what you think about it.
Bottoms up.
- It's actually not that bad.
- It's not that bad!
- Oh god...
- It's alright!
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
(laughing)
You'd mess with this?
- Yeah I guess.
- Yeah, what is the flavor remind you of?
Have you ever had
anything like this before?
- Tastes like a normal egg to be honest.
- A normal egg.
- Yeah a wet normal egg.
- Wet normal egg.
- Very wet.
- Thank you so much man,
I really appreciate it.
- Nice meeting you.
- Thank you.
- Is it alive?
- No not alive.
- And I just bite into it?
- It looks like a regular egg.
- Yeah it just looks like a regular egg.
- It's big.
- So I just open it?
- Yes.
And I have a fork as well.
- Okay, can I share with someone?
- No, I'm not sharing...
- Why is it so big?
- What's inside, what's inside?
- Egg and the embryo.
- Oh, and the embryo, that's kinda...
- And the embryo...
- Just eat it.
- No way...
- I don't know.
- Eat it, eat it, eat it!
It's really not bad
and it's actually very popular.
- I know it's just a mind thing.
- I know, for me it was the same thing.
- Alright, can I have a bite?
- Sure absolutely.
- No, I don't want to try that!
- So I'll have a sip.
- Have a sip.
- I've had a...okay.
- How is it?

- Okay.
- Am I getting poisoned?
- No definitely no poison!
- Because I don't have...life insurance
- Have a sip.
- Alright, let's try!
- It's okay I'll do it for the clout.
- How's the taste?
- It's not bad.
- Not bad, right?
Now there is the yolk,
and the actual embryo inside.
- That looks kind of messed up.
- Is there a baby in there?
- Is this moral?
- I mean no more or less moral than
than eating a hamburger, to be honest
- So what is that?
- Papa.
- What is that?
- Here's the salt
- Alright should I do it?
- Go for it.
- You've made it this far, might as well.
(cheering)

- I thought it was gonna be worse.
- Yeah.
- I thought it was gonna be worse
- It was pretty good.

thank you guys so much.
I really appreciate it, thank you.
- It's really difficult
to find in New York,
but it's actually a very popular
street food in the
Philippines and what it,
- What is that?
- This? It's a duck egg.
- Oh my God!
- It's called balut,
have you heard of that before?
- No I haven't.
- Do you want me to drink it?
- Do it!
- You're not trying to kill me right?
- No definitely not, so I think...
- You see this, he's trying to kill me!!!
- So basically just grab an egg.
- I'll get this one.
So how do you...
- No no no...
- Crack that part open...
- How?
- Use the base of the fork.
Yeah, and then just kind of crack it open.
- Oh, what the...
- So the idea is, you
want to try the uh...
the broth, so you can just sip it.
For you
You!
- You're the one that wanted to do this.
- I just drink it?
- Yeah, it actually tastes
very good with salt.
So you pour a little bit of salt in,
not too much but a little bit.
- Is it good?
- Tastes like soup.
- Like soup?
But what is that?
Yeah that does taste like soup.
- Now if you guys want
to try the yolk in there,
and the actual embryo
is actually very tasty.
- That?
- Yeah.
- Ah! That's the eyeball!
(laughing)
You expect me to eat that?
- Yeah!
- Eat it! You eat it.
Me? Well, here...
Let me see you eat it first so I know.
He ate it, now you eat it
Okay
- The flavor's actually pretty mild.
- F**k it, ready?
- Three, Two, One.
It's not so bad right?
- It could use a little salt.
- A little salt yeah I agree.
- It's not that bad, (to
friend) get over here!
- Hey people liking balut!
Careful careful.
So what did you think about that?
- Um, it's not that bad.
- It's pretty good.
- Not as expected
- Well I'm glad it wasn't as bad
as you guys thought it would be.
- I thought it was going to be real bad.
- Wow, you know what,
that was really interesting guys.
So first of all, I want to say that,
I think a lot of times,
if you look on the Internet,
there's all these videos about people
eating balut and it's like,
they're saying it's the weirdest thing
the craziest thing.
I think honestly if you really eat it,
most people today actually enjoyed it.
Or at least they didn't really think
it was so bad. I think when you look
at the Internet and when
you look at these videos
it's very easy to get an impression that
this is such a weird,
strange, disgusting food.
But actually it really isn't.
It's honestly pretty
normal once you try it,
and the flavor is actually totally fine.
Especially if you put a little salt.
So yeah.
I'm kind of glad that we
bought this interesting,
unique food to people to try
in New York City today,
so yeah, thank you guys
so much for watching.
I hope you're all able
to subscribe if you like
these types of videos, and recommend me
more interesting foods to try.
Whether from the Philippines
or anywhere else,
and oh yeah, if you are
from the Philippines
and you like Filipino videos,
You can go watch the video
we did at Jollibee...
Which is a very very fun video,
and people really liked that.
Most videos I do are in Chinese but
I'm also trying to do more international
videos as well from all over the world so,
Yeah, thank you guys so much for watching
- Thank you.
- Thank you and we will
see you next time, baby!
