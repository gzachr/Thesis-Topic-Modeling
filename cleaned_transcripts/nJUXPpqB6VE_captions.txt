hello everyone hello welcome to a new video yeah 
so we are on the beautiful island charles yeah  
in the south is the southeast of the philippines 
yeah yeah so we have arrived yesterday this is the  
first video obviously uh i don't know why babe we 
don't film like this in between yeah destinations  
we never do that sorry about it yesterday 
was uh something interesting because yeah  
we did check uh prior to arrival booking on an 
accommodation on booking and when we got there  
well it wasn't ready to receive guests 
actually yeah even though it was listed  
on booking yeah it's ready you know to rent but 
unfortunately this is the state of the entire  
island yeah so guys be aware i don't think this 
coming months yeah the problems will be solved  
but why tell them why because yeah because of 
the typhoon that hit the island in december  
way back in december i don't know something like 
that yeah so everything is ripped apart devastated  
most of the houses and i don't know all of 
the establishments they don't have roofs  
so their people are working hard now to rebuild 
everything so clean to but it's such a disaster  
so most of the trees are falling down yeah they 
are broke yeah everything is but the island  
is beautiful yeah exactly we love it it doesn't 
matter of this yeah exactly and this is this place  
exactly where we are now this is the famous cloud 
cloud nine i believe it is famous for surf and it  
was famous for this bridge yeah which as you guys 
can see i mean some of the local guys told us that  
there was there were two like two how do you call 
them two posts here that were literally yeah also  
ripped apart and they are gone now two towers 
small towers i don't know what kind of towers  
maybe you will see in the photos well 
i mean look at the state of these guys  
i think there are some there some pool you know 
natural pools where the people are swimming and
yeah look at this here enjoying if you can 
watch yeah the this section it's completely gone  
yeah and they are working now to rebuild 
yeah yeah the bridge there's some metal
metal how do you call that metal bridge 
i don't know yeah no there it's uh yeah  
those that you use to to rebuild stuff here 
so they are working hard now to rebuild it  
but i will take a while and yeah this is why 
i was saying that they won't be finishing  
all of this work on this island in next couple 
months no that will take i don't know one year  
two year maybe to recover to fully recover yeah 
they also told us there are problems with the uh  
cell antennas yeah for the signal for the phones 
so that's why because of that as well yeah we have  
poor coverage also problems with the internet 
but this i believe these problems were from  
forever since forever a problem on the islands 
yeah it's hard to find good internet on really  
any island the wind came and took everything 
yeah i mean and people stayed just in one room  
to protect each other all of them in one room 
and in strong buildings yeah exactly pour them
but apart from that i don't know we we just 
love it we love it yeah definitely we do because  
since we arrived we found good food not to 
receive exactly how we like yeah old places  
yeah not too touristy so yeah what's not to love 
i mean the nature beauty is still here yeah yeah  
that's the scene but i mean it's a little bit of 
this dirty nature you know yeah exactly and also  
it's a heartbreaking to see everything torn 
apart but yeah yeah we'll still have fun here  
so this is called like surfing uh capsule uh of 
ireland like oh okay okay this place yeah yeah  
yeah this island oh this island of the entire 
philippines of the entire philippines really  
this is the capsule of surfing oh chicago okay 
guys philippines yeah so so if you enjoy it  
i mean we can see you can yeah you won't be 
able to see that because our lens doesn't  
reach that far this one yeah but yeah there 
are indeed nice waves you could totally surf  
and big one there is dangerous they said 
yeah exactly but on this side there's four  
beginners yeah smaller ways so who else sir 
who will try to serve i don't know you yeah so
okay i mean i think i will like it but i don't 
know how to sing but they said no problem because  
the water is yeah but no problem if i die i die 
happy exactly yeah you die doing something nice  
nice yeah something joyful let's continue because 
we want to do the south east or how we plan  
something like that yeah coast and yeah now 
we'll take a stroll around the island yeah do  
uh parts of the island you didn't tell them about 
our scooter oh guys yeah we have rented a scooter  
also our accommodation is decent yeah for the 
26 dollars we are paying we also have a small  
kitchenette with fridge and cattle the only two 
items i'm interested in it's perfect they have a  
wi-fi wi-fi a bed a bathroom yeah the wi-fi 
they provided us i think they took their router  
and they gave it to us they gave it to yeah over 
to for us but also yeah there's another couple  
i believe is a couple goes next to us so yeah 
there's someone else staying at the property  
also we rent our scooter per day with six point 
seven dollars exactly three hundred three hundred  
fifty pesos yeah and pesos from their neighbors
