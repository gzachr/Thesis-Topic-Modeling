i will be trying corned beef i'm gonna make it for 
tomorrow's breakfast and of course filipino style
so i found these ones and i 
want to combine it with the  
corned beef okay and i think you call them 
radish i'm not sure but these are very tasty  
i don't know if you know these in the philippines 
but let's try them to combine with the corn beef
so what you saw was some tinolang manok
that was the dinner of yesterday so we still have 
uh cooked rice left let's make a little bit extra  
light here that's better it's still 
early morning so sinangag first
i wonder if there's any 
special way of making sinangag
i reduce the heat a little bit 
and i'm going to add the oil
not too much
bawang
it's getting brown a bit already i'm gonna 
add the rice quickly a little bit of salt
sinangag is ready so we're 
gonna put it in a big bowl
like i said i'm trying corned beef 
today in filipino style i have the  
potatoes here that i bought yesterday these are 
pre-cooked so i'm gonna use half of this pack  
i've seen some recipes on youtube uh by 
filipino chefs um and you all use uh patatas in  
corned beef filipino-style corned beef so i'm 
trying to um to do a little bit of the same  
um i'm cutting these potatoes a little bit smaller 
as you can see because i saw that they use tiny  
pieces of potato like i said these are pre-cooked 
so they should be ready soon a bit of oil  
i decided to use a little bit less okay so it's 
a little bit less potatoes there we go potatoes
just fry them a little bit yeah like i said i 
often get inspiration from filipino chefs on  
youtube like panlasang pinoy or chef morris 
danzen chef sheilla i also like um Judy Ann  
Judy Ann's Kitchen and Richard Gomez those are 
channels that i watch and get some inspiration for  
filipino food so please let me know which channel 
you like to watch which is your favorite filipino  
chef i would be very interested to hear from you 
how do you remove this thing i just roll it right  
just like that some beautiful fried 
potatoes let's take them out for a while
sibuyas  
so i'm gonna wash some of these radish
now these look really good and i know they're very 
tasty look they're white inside i'm just gonna  
make a few slices for just for a little bit of an  
invention so the onions are starting to 
get brown so let's add the corned beef
yummy i remember eating this in the philippines  
so yummy and then i know what is missing it's 
the 3 in one diba the coffee the sweet coffee  
let's make it a little bit smaller 
fry it a little bit with the onions
i have a lot of muscle pain from yesterday's 
workout so even this tiny thing i feel in my arms
so the meat is getting nice and soft i'm adding 
the potatoes back a little bit of black pepper
a little bit of salt not too much
mix everything
some lovely corned beef with potatoes
and some dutch radish
and some fried itlog completo na with 
some three in one coffee pinoy style
hmm set up and this tiny radish is really tasty
