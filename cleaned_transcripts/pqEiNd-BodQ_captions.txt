- Never have I ever lied about
a makeup product being good.
(suspenseful music)
Next question, please.
(beeps)
Hi guys, it's Bretman Rock,
and I'm here to play Suck It Up.
It's like never have I ever,
but with everything that I have done.
Never have I ever cringed
from watching my old videos.
(gasps)
Oh my God, I have.
I have to eat one of these candies.
Ugh.
And as the questions get harder,
the candies get more and more sour.
You got me (beeps) up.
So let's get started.
Bring it on, Delish.
(upbeat music)
I'm trying not to eat
any at all, honestly.
Never have I ever wished I was
a different astrology signs.
Never.
(beeps), I'm a Leo as (beeps).
Like what else would describe this?
Honestly, I don't.
Aquarius, (beeps) I don't even know.
I'm a Leo through and through.
And even thinking about
myself being another sign
gives me the ick, ugh.
Imagine, I walk around being like,
"Hi, I'm a Taurus."
Next.
By the way, for those of you at home,
Marc is on here and he is so cute.
Anyways, the editor out here at Delish,
tell Marc I said hey.
Second card.
Never have I ever
preferred TikTok over Vine.
I went to school looking all
(beeps) cute and (beeps),
you know the drill..
But, bae didn't even come to school.
(beeps), I don't care how
sick you are, who's dying,
you finna come to school and
look at how cute I am, (beeps).
(upbeat music)
I honestly, as much as I miss Vine,
six seconds simply was just not enough
to entertain the world.
I'm a 15 second gal, so
I'm, I would say never.
I do think TikTok is better than Vine.
Never have I ever cringed
from watching my old videos.
Righty or lefty?
I am a, I am a left, what the f?
Yes, you're right.
I have never cringed at my old. (gasps)
Oh my God.
I have.
I cringe at all my videos.
So if I have that means
I have to eat now, right?
Okay, well it's just this, so.
Darna!
Filipinos would kn, they only.
Oh my God, I actually swallowed it.
Hold on.
Only Filipinos would get Darna.
But yeah, not even sour at all.
Went straight down my throat.
Never have I ever actually liked poi.
Ooh, is this something I lie about
'cause I don't want to eat the next?
I do like poi,
but this is a trick question
because I only like poi with
sugar and it doesn't say that.
So technically I don't like poi by itself
- [Marc] Still poi, it's still poi.
- (beeps), it does not say poi with sugar.
You really think you could get the getter?
Marc, (beeps),
didn't they tell you I was a savage?
- [Marc] Okay, I need you
to eat these candies, man.
- Girl, you just wanna see me,
you just wanna see me swallow
again like stop, Marc.
But to be honest, I
only like poi with sugar
and a little bit of lomi in it,
or sometimes just poi and
lomi, but never poi by itself.
Unfortunately, Marc.
- [Marc] Just quick note,
we actually do need you
to eat these candies.
- And I will, Marc.
And I will, Marc 'cause I need
you to know that I swallow.
Give me a hard question.
Never have I ever been a fan of the WWE.
What if I'm a Raw girl?
What if I'm a WWF girl?
You know what, I'm gonna
just eat the candy.
Yes, I am a fan of WWE.
Not you celebrating, Marc,
and I just really wanna try it.
And honestly, because I was named
after Bret The Hitman Hart and The Rock
I feel like I have to eat this.
If you guys wanna know more
about that read my book.
And I'll pick the red one 'cause.
(upbeat music)
Period.
Period.
So good.
Mm.
First it's sour then it's gone.
You really thought you
(beeps) had me, Marc.
That was Warheads, right?
- [Staff] Sorry, can't see for a second.
I know like he's on cam,
but if you could still just look right
because it might look awkward.
- Why y'all make me on
FaceTime with cute boys?
Who, who's fault is that?
Never have I ever been starstruck.
Oh my gosh.
There's literally a story
time of me being like,
I was starstruck by Adriana
Lima at the elevator.
Whatever.
Let's do pink.
Oh god.
That was instant.
That was little instant.
Ooh.
Okay, I'm really trying to,
I'm really trying to suck it
until the sourness is gone.
Ugh.
Period.
That one was good.
Genuinely, that was good.
Never have I ever thought about
eating one of my chickens.
Never.
Come here if you think
I have a fat (beeps).
Come here if you think
I have a fat (beeps).
Oof.
One of my chickens, never.
Chicken period, yes.
(beeps), I'm a chicken lover.
I love chicken both
ways as pets and in me.
What it's foo, like in
me, like after I eat it.
Not in me, like up my (beeps).
Never have I ever liked
makeup more than fashion.
Like makeup more than fashion.
This is a good question because right now
in this time of my
career, I would say yes.
I do like makeup more than fashion.
I feel like I'm more of a
makeup girl than a fashion girl
that's why I have a stylist,
but I also do have a makeup artist.
But I started with makeup
and she pays my bills.
So yeah, makeup.
- [Marc] That means you have to eat.
You have to eat a candy.
(suspenseful music)
- Wait, but I have never.
(staff laughing)
I have, no, it says no.
(beeps), hold on.
Stop playing games.
You just, oh my God, you stop flirting me.
I don't even wear makeup.
Yeah, I'm agreeing with that.
I have never and I have the,
the prompt is if I have,
and I have never.
They say vanity fair,
y'all ain't gonna hook me up
to a (beeps) lie detector.
- [Marc] We have the proof.
- Oh my god, Marc.
Girl, let me just (beeps) eat it.
Can I just put it in my mouth
and swallow it with water?
How about that? Okay.
I'll give you a good bite.
- [Marc] I'm dumb worried
that that hurts your throat
'cause they all kind of rough, right?
- Are you threatening my throat?
Do you know where my
throat has gone through?
You don't know her.
(beeps)
Oh my God.
Oh my God, t's still in my mouth.
Period.
(upbeat music)
Marc, (beeps), I'm suing you, (beeps).
Trust.
- [Marc] We went from dating to being sued
in a blink of an eye.
- Literally you have
to marry me now, like.
Never have I ever had a favorite dog.
What the (beeps) does it even mean?
Never have, I have never, I've never.
No, I have never had a
favorite dog, actually,
'cause all of my dogs are my favorite.
Honestly, I feel like whenever
I find something funny
this is how I laugh.
(dog panting)
You know what I mean like?
(Bretman laughs)
See?
- And this is a, a, singular.
I have five (beeps) dogs,
and each one of 'em is my favorite.
(Bretman laughs)
Never have I ever preferred
Hawaiian food to Filipino food.
Yes, that's true.
I have never preferred Hawaiian
food over Filipino food.
Filipino food over
Hawaiian food all the time.
Hello? But I do love
myself a Hawaiian food.
I'll (beeps) up Hawaiian
platter from highway
in any (beeps) day, girl.
But hello, my family has a food truck.
If you guys wanna visit
Mama Merce's Kitchen, girl,
it's in Ewa Beach.
Never have I ever lied about
a makeup product being good.
Next question, please,
Marc, you're really trying
to stop my bag out here.
(beeps)
You better (beeps) skip through this.
Never have I ever collabed
with someone I hated.
At the moment?
Like I hated them at the
moment or hated them after.
Therefore, never.
I've never collabed with someone I hated
'cause why the (beeps)
would I collab with them
if I hated them at the time?
Never have I ever used
Facetune slash Photoshopped.
I have.
But this says never have I ever
used Facetune slash Photoshopped,
does it count if I sent it to a friend
to Facetune for me 'cause I
don't know how to Facetune,
and then I posted it
because it says, "have I?"
- [Staff] Used.
- Have I?
- [Marc] Yes.
- I don't know.
I guess I could say never.
I guess it goes both ways here.
You're not getting me today.
I have never used Facetune slash Photoshop
'cause I don't know how to do it.
I make other people do it.
It's not never have they
ever, it's never have I ever.
I'm not eating this.
I can literally smell it.
All right, this is the last question.
I also have one more candy left,
and it is (beeps) reeking
my nose right now.
I literally, I feel the dust
on my left nostril, (beeps).
Never have I ever deleted
a video I've posted.
(beeps), I have.
Are you happy?
I have.
I have deleted so many
including my very first YouTube video
that you guys will never (beeps) see.
All right, let's get this over with.
What even is this, this?
What is this yellow thing?
This apparently is a sour
candy in the market right now.
Well, it's not in the market
'cause it's a Delish special.
But yeah, let's taste this (beeps).
Wait, let me taste this
powder stuff first.
Ooh, vinegar-y.
Ooh, that's good.
(upbeat music)
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
That got your girl good.
That got me good.
That got me good.
You know what?
I deserve that for not,
for deleting my last,
my very first YouTube video
'cause I really regret it every day.
I really wanna laugh at
my old fashioned videos
that I thought I was giving, but.
- Serving you fish,
glamour.
I don't know what else to say.
Bye.
- But I will say this white
powder in itself, so good.
I'd do a line of this every day.
Oof, Delish, you really put me through it.
Marc, (beeps), you got me (beeps) up.
Thank you so much, Delish for having me,
and good luck to whoever is
trying this next, honestly.
Marc will get you.
But wait, before you guys go,
make sure you guys check out my book,
"You're That (beeps)" by
Bretman Rock, yours truly,
