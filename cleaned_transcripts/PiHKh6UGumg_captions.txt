Hey man
could you open the door a 
moment?
Morning!
How is it going man?
Really bad, man.
Yeah, that's what I thought.
It was just a little bit of 
sleep
really nice
and I hear something
what time is it?
I know what time it is
it's Philippine Time!
Ladies and gentlemen
we will be landing shortly
please return to your seat
put your seat in the upright 
position
fasten your seat belt.
Good morning mate
we're going to the volcano
I only forget the name again..
what was the name of the volcano
again?
Pinatubu.
So, we're going there with the 
taxi now,
then there's a four-wheel pickup
waiting for us to bring us
the last way
and then we have to walk for 
about one hour.
We're going all the way up to 
the volcano
named Pinatubu, yeah, I forget 
it all the time,
sorry about it.
I'm really excited about this
because this is really a new 
experience for me.
Look at all the sand,
it's actually ash from the 
volcano
that just erupted 20 years ago,
and we're going all the way up,
it should be a beautiful 
beautiful lake there,
we will swim and snorkel a 
little bit around,
so let's go up there and we'll 
show you later.
We're climbing now more and more
up the volcano,
and you can really see how 
incredible, beautiful this view 
is.
This volcano erupted last time 
20 years ago,
it last for about 2 weeks the 
eruption,
but the big bang came on the 
16th of June 1991.
And on the way you can see how 
devastating and big the eruption
was.
All the big rocks lying 
everywhere.
And here you still have people 
who live really in the middle of
nowhere.
It's hot out here, really hot.
It's all ashes coming out of the
volcano.
The eruption is so incredible, 
powerful, yeah?
If you're here you die..
Yeah, that's for sure.. You die
They had ashes snow in Manila.
A lot of sh*t was coming out.
You can see that the river is 
coming down here,
the water is very very clear.
It's coming all the way from the
lake,
from crater upstairs and it's 
unbelievable hot here,
unbelievably hot.
But it looks very very nice, you
can see,
in the last 18 years when the 
volcano last time erupted,
that the vegetation grows so 
good here.
A little bit of water from the 
tourist with the plastic bag and
the sporting shoes?
Thanks man.
Here we go, mate!
As you can see, we just arrived 
on top of the volcano,
and you can see there's the 
lake, and it's just incredible,
incredible beautiful!
See the colour, see all the 
ashes around in the mountain?
Ah the last eruption must have 
been very very big.
This is what we came for,
you can feel it's cool up here,
have a lot of wind, and we're 
gonna swim in the lake 
downstairs there.
I hope the water is not too 
cold.
Let's goo!!
Can I change on camera?
Costs you 100 pesos!
Ok, I pay it!
You ready? Yup! Go!
It's ok.
There are no volcano sharks 
around here?
It tastes a little salty 
actually.
Yeah?
A little, like Swavel, how you 
call that?
Swavel, like a match?
I have no idea what a Swavel 
is..
ah, a match! Ok ok!
Anything to be seen?
Yeah, sand and ash!
What about the volcano shark?
I passed the shark already, 
yeah!
But he said that he didn't like 
Dutch meat,
so I said well I'm pretty lucky,
I said there's some Swiss over 
there, yeah?
To be honest, I thought it was a
little bit more touristy.
At least.. everywhere were I 
came,
even In Venezuela,
as far in the jungle you could 
go,
there would be a little wooden 
or bamboo booth
or a little thing where you can 
buy a Coke
or a bottle of water
here it's just nothing,
really nothing, yeah?
So, if you really wanna be on a 
lonely planet,
you should come here,
to the Philippines.
Get a little bit of that Dutch 
color out of you!
Hey, listen, this is real milk 
color!
We're famous for milk!
No, you're cheese-heads, not 
milk-heads!
You don't call me cheese-head 
for nothing!
Hello!
And, we're back!
From the volcano,
it was incredible,
it was much much fun, and maybe,
because we didn't have a boat 
ticket,
maybe we have to do it again.
Go over, say hello to them.
Yeah, and if they don't say 
anything back to me
What then?
In the next episode Jerby, 
Patrick and Mirko
will meet the reclusive 
indigenous Ieta minority people
who live on the lush slopes of 
the Pinatubo volcano.
Did you ever swim in the crater 
lake of a volcano?
