- So, when you first come to a new place
like the Philippines,
it's hard not to notice the
things that really stand out
about the culture.
Today, I wanna talk to you
about the different things
that really surprised me
when I first came to the Philippines.
Come along.
So, one of the first things that I noticed
about the Philippines is how
amazingly kind people were.
I've literally never met so
many people that are so sweet,
kind, respectful, the way
people talk to each other
is amazing as well.
When I first came here,
everybody would call me sir,
or use phrases that were very respectful.
And at first I thought
it's just because I'm old,
and so, they're talking to
me that way because I'm old.
But what I've really found is
that even if people are young,
similar age to each other,
that's how people just
talk to each other here,
very kind, very respectful,
something that has meant
so much to me to this day,
living in the Philippines.
(upbeat music)
So violent GoPro, dead, I mean, come on.
So, one of the other
things that I've noticed
about Filipinos on the whole
is that they're really shy.
Even if on the outside,
they seem kind of confident,
on the inside I think
that they are pretty shy.
Not exactly sure why that is,
but I find that often the
shyness is centered around,
speaking to a foreigner,
especially in English,
even though Filipinos
have amazing English,
very easy to communicate
to most of the people here,
they're really a little bit
insecure about speaking English,
especially to a foreigner.
Another thing that surprised me here,
is how long things can take.
My concept of time
compared to Filipino time
as it's called here,
it's really different 'cause
some things that would take
four hours where I'm from
might take four weeks here.
Some things that might
take four days in the U S,
might take four months here.
The concept of time is really different.
That also goes for when you
agree to meet with other people,
time is a little bit more
of kind of like a suggestion
rather than a rule.
So, if you agreed to meet
with friends or family,
sometimes even interviews
with people that I interview
at work, you say that you're
gonna meet at 9:00 a.m.
doesn't really mean 9:00 a.m.
probably nobody's going
to be there at 9:00 a.m.
and a lot of the cases,
9:00 a.m. might mean 9:30 or 10:00 a.m.
it's a little bit different here,
and a little bit of a
surprise to figure out,
how different concepts of times
can be in the Philippines.
(upbeat music)
So, another thing that was
a surprise here is that,
there's actually two prices here,
one for locals and one for foreigners.
And the way that I found out
about this the first time is
I took a trip to Boracay,
one of the beautiful islands here,
and I was walking to go into a restaurant,
and just over to the side,
there was a massage place.
And one of the guys is out
there with a sign on his hand,
and he was asking me,
would you like to come and get a massage?
Just come for half an hour or an hour.
And I said, no, thank you,
headed to get something to eat right now,
and then he took the sign
and he switched it around,
and he said, sir, I'll
give you local prices,
and that's how I found out
first that there's often
two different prices there,
one for local and one for foreigners.
(upbeat music)
Are these new here?
This is at Ayala Mall
I don't think I've ever
seen these ones here before,
but sometimes art looks so painful,
where is the rest of the body.
(upbeat music)
So, in this video,
I wanted to talk about some
of the things that most
surprised me about moving
to the Philippines.
Come along with us, I have
a special guest here today.
- Hi guys, my name Yuki
Suzuki nice to meet you,
nice to meet you John.
- So, one of the last times
we were out shooting video,
secret camera man and I came
across someone that was,
out there with a gimbal and a camera,
taking some footage at
IT Park in Cebu City.
(upbeat music)
And we were kind of stalkers
going up and meeting him.
And he was kind enough to
catch up with me today.
He's been living here in the
Philippines for seven years.
- Yeah, seven years.
- And passionate about
videography and photography,
doing some business over here as well,
and it's always a great
opportunity for me to meet,
different foreigners here.
And actually, that's one of the things
that we were talking about.
A lot of countries, there's a
lot of foreigners everywhere.
And so, you're just one of many.
Philippines is really a
little bit different, right?
- Yes, I totally agree that
especially culture and people,
yeah, it's totally different.
- Yes, absolutely.
So, I gotta be honest.
It's not a lot of
foreigners here that I meet,
that I would want to actually
talk to more than one time.
And I think a lot of people come here,
and maybe they're on vacation,
or maybe they're here
just to meet a lot of
different people in a short time,
and then head back to wherever
it is that they're from.
It's always a great opportunity to meet,
fellow expat that is here,
that really cares about Filipinos,
cares about Filipino
culture and learning it,
and where we could share
some similar experiences with
living in the Philippines.
So, let me ask you Yuki,
what is one of the things
that surprised you,
about the Philippines when you came here?
- Wow, that's really nice question.
Most surprise, that's
I think maybe people,
especially people are very
talented here in Philippines,
even during work time, I mean
working time, work hours,
they're singing, dancing
just they enjoy their life,
even we have very serious jobs there,
but they are just enjoying.
That's I guess most surprise only, yeah.
- Yeah, I think that's one
of the things that I found
very surprising here as well,
so many talented Filipinos
here with all of the arts,
but I also got to say
on kind of a fun side,
so many Filipinos are singing, dancing.
I think that's a big
part of family life here,
in terms of singing and doing karaoke.
Sorry if I'm pronouncing that wrong.
That's the foreigner
version of saying Karaoke.
When people get together as friends,
they're gonna be singing together,
especially I think with TikTok
and other things like that,
a lot of dancing,
are you on TikTok?
- No, I'm not.
- Me neither, but I
think that's the thing.
Maybe people from other cultures,
they can't sing well or
if they can't dance well,
we're probably not gonna do it.
- Very talented,
- Yes, but here, where
they're very talented,
maybe sometimes not very talented,
I think people still are so
comfortable in their own skin,
that they're still gonna sing and dance,
and really enjoy life together regardless.
So, one of the things we
were talking about is,
similarities between cultures,
what's different in the U S and in Japan.
And I got to say for me,
when I look at what are
the similarities between,
Filipino culture and US culture,
for me, I probably think
of more differences
than things that are similar,
but I think a lot of popular
culture like movies or music
or TVs, some of those things are the same.
I think also it depends a little bit more,
but I think a lot of Americans
are very sociable as well,
and like being out and
connecting with others,
I think that's very similar
here in the Philippines,
but what about you?
What do you find similar between
Japan and the Philippines.
- We talking about the food,
I think we have similar especially tastes.
Yeah, so do you know, Adobo yes you know.
Yeah, actually we have really similar,
almost the same food in Japan.
We call it, Nikujaga, yeah Nikujaga.
Probably most Japanese like Nikujaga
because like our mother tongue,
I know usually mothers
cook Nikujaga for kids.
Yeah, so I think that's like
similar Japanese and Filipino.
- So, what about differences?
When I think about differences between,
for example, the US and
Philippines culture,
probably the biggest thing
that stands out for me is how
Americans are and Filipinos are in person,
compared to when they're driving.
So, for me, when it comes
to meeting Americans,
sometimes friendly,
sometimes not so friendly,
when you first meet them,
but Filipino's are always
so friendly, right?
- Yeah.
- Like I've never one
time since I've been here,
met a Filipino that wasn't
really friendly in person,
but when I get inside of a car,
or when I try to cross the road,
it's like Filipinos turn into
kind of like angry Americans
and really have to watch
crossing the road because,
it's maybe like,
there's a target on your
head that you don't see,
and they're going right for you.
And also, with driving Filipinos
are so polite in person.
- Yeah.
- But driving, you're
kind of taking your life
into your own hands.
One of the differences is
I think that in person,
outside of the car,
Filipinos are the most friendly people
you're ever gonna meet anywhere,
but inside of a car, very different.
But it's really the opposite
in American culture.
Americans are mostly pretty careful,
and follow rules while driving,
but may be different how
they are in everyday life.
So, what about you? What
is it that looks different?
- Oh, my God John actually,
definitely same opinion,
that's why I was so laughing.
Okay, I don't drive here,
but have you noticed when
you walk on the street
Filipinos are very friendly,
it's true, very friendly.
And then, but one time if they drive,
they are not friendly
anymore because, okay,
for example, where I want
to cross away, I mean,
the way in Japan, every
time car, the car stops,
and they give a way for people walking.
- Right.
- Yeah but here, they
never give a way for me.
So, they become not friendly
if they grab you like handle.
Yeah, that's true, yeah.
Also in Japan drivers are
very careful to drive.
Of course, if there is a person or people,
who want to cross the way we
stop and they wait for them
to finish cross the way, but here, no,
even we are here already
in the middle of the way,
the car never stops.
Oh, my God, usually
Filipinos are friendly,
but when they're in the
car, they're not friendly.
- Different story.
What makes it a little
bit more scary for me,
and I just found out this law recently,
for example, in the US and
I'm guessing Japan as well,
the laws really look at who was at fault.
- Yeah.
- So, for example, if
someone is on the road,
and maybe they were
drinking too much alcohol,
no matter what happens,
it's that person's fault,
because they shouldn't
have been on the road,
drinking and driving in the first place.
But in the Philippines,
they have a law where,
say for example, that
somebody is driving drunk,
or maybe they're driving very dangerously,
and they run into the
car at somebody else,
and that person dies,
it's actually the fault of
the person who was driving,
even if they were sober,
even if they were driving the speed limit,
even if they didn't do
anything wrong at all.
But because the other
person really at fault died
or got hurt,
ultimately, the person who was driving
and not doing anything wrong,
it's gonna wind up in jail,
and is mostly gonna have
to pay some type of fine,
or some type of arrangement
with the family,
in order to get out of that situation.
- Okay, I'm not sure
because I was working as a,
manager before in previous company,
and I had around 80 or
a 100 people Filipinos.
So, what's the difference
that like management in Japan,
usually, okay, your boss or
you if you make some mistakes.
- Sure.
- And then, you will be, your
boss say something to you,
even there is a lot of
people, they don't mind.
It really happen in Japan.
So, it's kinda embarrassing or insulting,
but it's really normally happen in Japan.
But here, I totally
don't suggest to do that,
because usually Filipinos
are very sensitive,
and probably they will
get more serious emotion,
if you just say something
bad or too much strict,
that's the big difference
in Japan and Philippines
so probably, you have business here,
you have to be careful communicating
with your 15 people like that.
- That's true.
- Yeah, that's one of the big
difference about management.
- Well, you mentioned about
Filipinos being sensitive,
is something that you don't
recognize immediately.
- Yes.
- But I think whether
it's a man or a woman,
regardless of the age,
Filipinos have really
soft sensitive hearts.
And I think that on the outside,
you might not know how sensitive they are,
but it's a really big
difference here as well.
And one of the things that's really
endearing for me about
Filipinos is as well,
is just how soft of a heart they have.
So, do you feel with Filipinos that,
if something goes really wrong,
that maybe they're gonna
stop the relationship,
or what's your experience with that?
Or they're forgiving.
- Yeah, they give another chance
still, even when I mistake,
but it's kind of difficult
to recover our relationship,
if ones you've made big mistake.
- For me sometimes I find that Filipinos,
will hold a lot inside.
So, mostly most Americans,
I'm not sure in Japan,
but most Americans, if
you do something to them,
they're going to talk to
you about it right away.
And maybe not always in a very nice way,
but here, I find that even
if you really upset someone,
they feel it, but maybe you won't know,
until one day or one
week or one month later,
because they'll hold it inside a lot more.
What about Japan?
How was that there?
- I think usually yeah, people do,
like similar Filipino.
They try to hold their emotion
feelings usually, yeah.
But one time, I mean someday,
if they cannot hold it
anymore they will resign,
they will leave you.
- Actually, that's been
my experience at times,
as a boss here at times is that,
I really try to communicate
with people at times,
and maybe it's something
with work needs to be done
at a higher standard,
or maybe something needs to be changed,
in the US that would be
a very common discussion.
And people would be able to hear that,
maybe it would be a little hurtful,
but that would be a normal
part of the conversation,
between the employer and employee,
or a manager and employee,
to have to work on
certain things in culture.
Here though, this has been
part of my learning experience,
I've had a few people resign because,
I think the conversations
were maybe too unfiltered.
I was never yelling or anything like that,
but I think that how I communicate,
things that need to change or be improved,
is really important here.
I've had to learn the hard way,
that I need to communicate in a way
that is appropriate for
Philippines culture.
And I got to be honest like
I'm still working that out.
I really want to work it out,
but it's something that I
am still a work in progress,
of how the bands communicate
cross-culturally,
in the workplace.
- Kind of a deep topic.
- Yeah, yeah, it is.
Well, it's really been a
pleasure getting to talk to you,
and meet and especially
communicate our different
experiences here at Philippines as well,
always a pleasure to meet a new friend.
Thank you for making the time.
- Yeah, thank you so much.

with us on the channel.
Also, you have a YouTube as well.
- Yes, I have a YouTube
channel for my dog,
about my dog.

Yeah, thank you so much.
- All right, camera man,
