street in Korea.
Also Japanese food is very expensive in philippines

from the Korean Store 
Just buy Local snacks

To be honest, I think Glaze is the best in Krispy Kream
Yeah I will get this one 
These are what i bought 
The are not working effienctly 
They should use only one beg and work efficiently
Get what you need from Aussi Mart
because im not going to purchase any items 
This is the street view of Philippines
Oh ~ Run ~
We are going to buy few things from Korean Market and  will 
go home
Im not going to buy anything from Korean Market because i 
dont eat noddles that much
Why dont you just purchase for 1 week 
Rather then ordering food 
You just need to cook at home
Just purchase the items here and cook at home it will save 
your money
There are lots of people in Korean Mart
The lines are very long
Whats all this? you purchased a lot
From my expereience living in foreign country for 16 years
When ever i vist korean mart there are many people 
These are what we purchased
You tired?
Its very hot
We finished our shopping and waiting for our Grab
House mate is exhausted
See you at home ~
These are what we pruchased today 
Total cost of all of these are
Approximately 50K KRW (2,500Peso)
OH ~ Not even 50K KRW
I purchased the items based on what i like 
Total cost of these are approximately 20K KRW (800peso) in 
Korea
But in Philippines its only 548peso including with milk
 548peso is approximately 14K KRW
 This is how i feel about Philippines Price index, 
Philippines has similar price index with Korea
I will end the Video 
See you again in next video
I will come up with Dessert Mubang
Thank you for watching our video Bye Bye ~
KKYONG-I POGI  TV CONCLUSION 
PHILIPPINES PRICE INDEX IS NOT LOW 
IF YOU USE MONEY EASILY YOU WILL BE END UP IN THE FALL
