in 1985 Mr Leonardo 'Sandy' Javier Jr unknowingly 
created one of Philippines most trusted fast food  
brands with his store Adok's. Now with over 
300 stores nationwide the famous roast chicken  
Branch offers a huge array of dishes and we are 
here today to try as many of them as possible
[Music]  
we are on the Majestic island of Boracay 
which has six andock stores spread across  
this tiny Island which seems insane 
we're going to a store in the epicenter  
of Boracay near station two so let's 
head inside and check out this menu
where we're going to try a lot we're making 
a video we're going to try a lot of the food  
one versus Zig I do Kawali Royale
we are styling off the day strong 
with our food taste test with the  
original Fried Chicken for 89 peso per piece
[Music]  
um quite a thick piece of chicken 
really good coating that is looking  
delicious the coating is so similar to 
KFC but not as greasy what I'm finding  
like the KFC chicken often super greasy 
a solid piece of chicken can't really  
falter I am having the original Fried 
Chicken this looks delicious here we go
the coating the skin is what makes it it's so 
yummy spicy fried chicken this is also 89 peso
oh yeah got a little cut really nice kicker for 
spice once again I can feel in that building  
was quite spicy
I think I maybe a little bit too spicy 
for me it's maybe like 15 overboard I'm  
a bit afraid of this because what 
Scott said here it goes [Music] um
that's quite spicy and I've only had a tiny bit of 
the coating so pull up Scotty you're a great man  
for eating as much of the coating as you did 
next dish is the limpo which I think is pork  
belly of some sort but this is 330 peso for the 
entire plate with some sort of like Gravy Sauce  
super crispy looks really good there is one 
sexy looking pork so crispy I'm sure it's tasty
um no sauce very sweet very Char grilled for a 
fast food restaurant this is I can't complain  
like this is as good as we've given restaurants I 
thought it's gonna be really low quality but that  
is actually a fantastic I really rate that and 
I love I love poor belly so I'm a bit biased but  
really tasty I am so intrigued by this it comes 
with its own source oh my goodness here it goes
that's really sweet I thought it might 
be more like gravy I'm just confused  
right I read a fast food restaurant 
and this is not normally fast food  
now this pork this is a I think it's like 
or sizzig well it's 249 peso it came out all  
sizzling all nice but we've been in the other 
food so it's no longer sizzling but it looks  
really nice we've got onions in there I've never 
had sizzix this is my first time having it in the  
Philippines really tasty there's a little line 
there to squeeze on as well oh what's in there  
so fatty but onions are delicious I don't 
even know what's in there it's very very  
oily that's one thing I can kind of see them if 
you look down here you can see there's a kind  
of oil all through the plate lots of little 
onions but a lot of oil very oily and fatty  
I feel like if you've had a big night you're 
hungover this would be the perfect treat [Music]
I really like that it's got the 
lime in it it's also got garlic  
onion it's so like juicy that's delicious next 
one on The Chopping Block is the Kawali Royale  
which looks like it's 391 peso so quite a pricey 
dish we've got some I think spring onions some  
other normal brown onions and then meat it does 
look oh my God so crispy look at this hanging off  
I assume this is just I'm pretty sure this is just 
their famous pork belly here in the Philippines
wow you know from a fast food restaurant oh my 
God crispy so moist really amazing flavors how  
is this added like a fast food restaurant pork 
belly usually you know back home any country  
this is like nice proper sit down pork belly 
the Philippines they've got some witchcraft  
in the kitchen here to whip this up for us 
moving I can die happy now we have got the  
famous dish what made an ox the famous famous 
roast chicken which is pronounced litson manok  
I think so this is the super half chicken which 
is 209 peso and you get half a chicken with this  
it looks delicious we've got a little bottle of 
sauce that we're gonna dip that thing and get  
the I think it must be another gravy not sure if 
it's different from what we had earlier [Music]  
wow it feels like it's just been injected 
with moisture I've never had such a moist  
roast chicken I definitely see why enox is 
a famous for this red chicken and why this  
place got big because just a very simple piece 
of chicken with a raspberry simple sauce but the  
flavors are so complex it just melts it's like 
it's like chicken it's butter I have high hopes  
for this chicken because of Scotty's reaction 
I'm so excited get all of that sauce in there
it just melts in your mouth that is the 
softest chicken I've ever had why is it  
so soft what are they doing to their 
chickens here that's delicious so this  
is called the daquito it is a fried chicken 
burger and it costs 79 pesos the cheese is a  
fluorescent yellow it does not look like cheese 
at all I'm a little bit scared but here we go
maybe it's not cheese maybe it's mustard the 
chicken's a little bit chewy the Bun's really soft  
I mean it's all right just an average Burger this 
does look like a very basic looking Burger even  
the bun does feel a little stale and maybe it made 
a few days ago but let's give this thing a whirl
oh that is an odd sauce it's yeah mustardy 
I mean it's fried chicken but it's like  
you know like a thin cheeseburger patty 
it's like the thinnest the thinnest thin  
chicken burger patty I've ever seen 
it's the it's basic it's cheapy but  
I wouldn't recommend it the other meat on here 
is far superior so maybe give this one a miss  
we have gotten two rice bowls and the first 
one is the adobo rice which is 65 peso and  
it's got the meat an egg and a thinnest of 
smally thin tomatoes on it a bit pathetic I  
don't know why it's there a bit for show 
but here we go oh no no don't the tomato
out of there
all very dry the ratio of rice to meat is way 
off oh so salty as well the first lot of meats  
were really good and now we just get into salt 
overload I don't know if it's because we've had  
a lot of meat but this just seems very salty 
it looks very dry to start off with um I don't  
like the best cuts of meat but here we go it 
looks like mainly rice and a little bit of meat
very salty very salty I'm not really a fan of 
that it just has like salt and rice on to the  
next one second up with the rice we've got the 
list six rice which is 75 peso this one looks a  
little bit more Saucy a little bit more to it 
so let's go they've got some just some onions  
meat and rice pretty basic much better stronger 
flavor it's a little bit salty but I way prefer  
this over the adobo the top half looks nice 
and Saucy but underneath once you get through  
a few bites I think you're just going to 
have plain rice this is brisket it looks
sticks this is a tongue twister press six  
and it looks very saucy from the get-go 
so having higher hopes for this one
very plain and very salty I'm really not a fan 
of these rice bowls but it might have just been  
the ones that we picked probably wouldn't get that 
again this is the cutest little plate of spaghetti  
I have ever seen I always say it wrong spaghetti 
I'm gonna go run for a bite twist it twirl it all  
up I mean the noodles look a little bit sad but 
hey we're in a fast food store what do you expect
um that's not good that's really not good it 
tastes like it came out of a can to be honest  
this is very sad looking I see Haley's oh I think 
oh that's just Tomatoes I know is it hot dogs  
there's little cut up maybe Tomatoes or hot dogs 
I don't know but this looks very sad very basic  
but you don't go to a neat 
place for this spaghetti
oh
if the world was ending and I had nothing 
else to eat I would eat that but anything  
else would go above this this is 59 peso 
and I don't think I would even eat it if it  
was free we're finishing off with a delightful 
dessert which is a leche flan which is 40 peso  
and this thing looks delicious hopefully 
this will get away that spaghetti taste
oh yeah yeah it's a lot better than 
spaghetti it looks like a custard  
sorts of thing with a little bit of 
like juiciness into it here we go
good caramel custard that's delicious good 
way to end the meal all wrapped up now that  
was delicious I think my tip is to stick 
to the favorites menu that's where all the  
good stuff was everything else give it a pass 
not really worth it that's like kind of a low  
quality stuff my two favorite dishes because I 
can't really pick one was a Kawali Royale and  
also the roast chicken I think I've had lots of 
pork belly here Philippines so I think the roast  
chicken might take the cake for me what about you 
Haley my favorite was the suzuk that was amazing  
and then also the roast chicken was amazing 
too it was so so soft and just melted in your  
mouth so I think as we both see roast chicken I 
feel like it has to take the number one spot so
