good morning everybody it's will and jose and we 
are coming to you from batanyas more specifically  
the mother of asia yes she is 
beautiful she is mass evil and  
it's a moment it's a moment for sure she truly 
is so why don't you guys check this place out  
with us and we'll give you a little bit more 
information of what there is to see beauty
and just so you know there are a bunch of stairs 
to walk however they're very nicely spaced  
and it makes it so much easier what 
makes this place even more beautiful  
is it's located right off the coastline 
so as you're making your way up you are  
starting to see all the ocean that's surrounding 
it along with the nearby islands it's beautiful  
it's sunday it's palm sunday actually so 
that explains the amount of people that  
are here special sunday special sunday for all 
the catholics and christian people here in the  
philippines in the world in the world and 
i'm one day guys i need to work out again
as much as we love doing adventures 
here sometimes it's really nice to just  
take things a little easy and slower a slower 
pace so that's why it's important for us to  
visit these churches and kind of see the other 
perspectives of the filipino culture and yeah
okay guys we ended up leaving the bantangas 
area and are making our way towards the tagatai  
but on their way there we came across this 
little gem back here so it's funny because i saw  
a picture of this place it was supposed to be the 
biggest or supposed to be like the disney world of  
the philippines apparently um but we've never seen 
it in person we just saw a few pictures actually  
yesterday i was just scrolling and saw it it's 
so freaking cool so of course like we had to pull  
along the street and be the tourist that we are 
like film it and fly the drone the drone footage  
looks great so it looks like it'd be super cool 
but yeah it's just a little something along the  
way honestly i think if i were a disney princess 
i lived there hashtag princess jasmine all the way  
yeah it's more colorful though to be fair i've 
never been to disneyland or disney world i'm  
probably the only person in the world in the us 
that has never been there i'll take you there one  
day babe yeah all right wait what disney princess 
would you be um what disney princess would i be  
cinderella hello that's stiletto comment below 
and tell us who you would be if you were a disney  
princess no i prefer jasmine yeah like pocahontas 
like with my dark brown hair and my like flowy i  
don't i don't know if it's supposed to be the 
disneyland of the philippines but like it's  
fantasy world so basically it was never opened 
um but there's like a lot of people went there  
for photos and it literally looks like it would be 
the best place to do photo shoots it's super cool

looks badass to be quite honest with you enough  
stalling let's go have lunch together yeah you

homeowners this is a type of style home that  
we will want yeah it's industrial but it's like

like a lot of hotels but like they're lodges

smell like pine trees at all so i don't know what  
type of pine trees these are they're beautiful

tomorrow no it's south of manila north 
of botanist where we were just at but  
we're really about with these names 
we're gonna just like do voiceovers  
when we announce the place from now on yeah 
just so we don't sound like complete idiots  
when we're pronouncing them we're 
sorry we mean no disrespect i mean  
but we appreciate your patience and understanding 
for our lack of times yes during these times
we really wanted to go to this volcano called 
tall so it's like in the middle uh it's like  
its own island basically um but it erupted 
what like a month ago a couple weeks ago  
weeks ago so you can no longer go over there 
but you used to be able to go like take a  
boat over there and hike up it and we went to 
really really bad but it's like stage three i  
think right now which means you can't even like 
get near it but you can see it from here i hope  
we can pick up some footage you can see it it 
looks it's so freaking cool and insane to see
you
