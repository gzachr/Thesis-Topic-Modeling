it's like an unpleasant surprise oh my
god did you hear my belly i don't know
what's going on
[Music]
hi i'm mae and today i'm trying other
filipino women's adobo adobo is the
philippines national dish everyone had
their own way of making their own adobo
the most important aspect would be the
soy
the vinegar
bay leaves and garlic i don't put bay
leaf in maya double i don't know if
that's weird my perfect adobo has a lot
of zabao which is the soup and meat has
to be tender and delicious nothing chewy
maybe there might be a chicken and pork
one gonna have to
[Music]
i see wait to try everyone else's adobo
so let's just get to it i'm not gonna
lie i switched up this adobo i
kept it in the slow cooker for like five
to seven hours and i added carrots
because you know we need to have some
vegetables it's pork i love pork first
off the sizing of the meat's tiny isn't
it it looks nice but it's just a smell
i just can't get that um the adobo smell
it's got carrots in it it's weird to me
but it might be nice
i think there is coconut on there you
know
this is definitely much more sour than
mine it smells different to me
it might just be me though
different
is there vinegar here i can't actually
taste the vinegar
it's a bit tasteless
i think it's the carrot that just takes
away the taste the meat is
really soft it's nice the best thing
about this dish is that i like that they
added the fat of the pork in there but
taste wise it doesn't taste overly like
a double to me i wasn't too sure of the
carrots to be honest that's the first
time i've ever seen a double with
carrots i like this dish i don't think
it needed to be improved if her family
loves it then
that's all that matters i would improve
this by adding a little bit more of the
traditional filipino adobo ingredients
you gotta have peppercorns in a double
maybe remove the carrots it's nice but
um yeah it just needs a bit more
seasoning
[Music]
for an adobo dish i would give this a
5 out of 10. i would give this dish a 7
out of 10.
i will give this a 5 out of 10.
a bit more
seasoning that's it thank you my adobo
is nice and succulent juicy i like a bit
of that burnt in there
so that crispiness and my kids love it
as well well they have to love it isn't
it i'm their mom
oh hello oh this egg smells so fragrant
i love it so what is this about
i'm kind of sad because my rice is going
to feel a little bit dry because there's
no soup we usually use jasmine rice but
basmati rice is also nice the pork size
is great actually this is perfect i
think it's talking to me because of all
the oil from the fat
it's good there's more vinegar in this
adobo than i'm used to
[Music]
nice and soft so good
[Music]
i can tell that they put a bit of chili
oil in that shorter double so that's a
nice little kick to it
i would really like a bit
just a tiny bit of sauce
i feel like i'm chewing a lot the rice
is dry as well because there's no sauce
i think it's good it's a good adobo but
the meat oh the meat is just perfectly
cooked and it goes really well with the
chili oil
chili the chili oil is actually really
nice to it i really like this adobo i'm
saying that i'm not entirely a fan of
dry adobo it just feels like a fried
dish rather than a soupy home dish i
would definitely borrow the egg idea but
i probably won't cook it as
cooked as this i'll give this dish eight
out of ten because
it looks like than a double it's just
that for me i want more sauce i'd give
this a seven out of ten i would give
this a double an eight out of ten
[Music]
i wanted to give it a lot more than that
to be fair but
because i don't like bay leaf
in my double i use pork as the main
ingredient also in my adobo i add a bit
of green chilies it just gives that
extra flavor for me yeah you really need
to try it it smells really good like
that was the first thing that hit me
but it's nice it's quite similar to what
i would do from what i can see they've
got onions and it's got fat in the pork
the chili i don't know if i'm going to
even try and tempt that chili because
i don't want to be like
okay
no maybe i just don't take chili well
you can taste the chili but not much
spice in it
[Music]
that's nicely cooked the meat
that's really nice
it feels like they actually marinated
because i could
taste them
the sauce more in the in the meat
so initially i did think it was going to
be dry but when you bite into it it's
nice and soft
i like that it's got the fat
in the in the pork because i think that
adds flavors to it as well the meat is
really nice it's not chewy it just melts
in your mouth so it's lovely it's lovely
taste my least favorite thing is the
chili i'm not into that especially for
my adobo this lady cooked it really
really well she should be proud of
herself i would like to
to know what's what she's put in there
it's delicious
i'll give this adobo
nine out of ten
i don't give anything ten
but you are so close to 10 i will give
this a double
and the rain
i give this a double of 5 out of 10.
i know there's more to eat but this is
lovely
my adobo today has chicken and pork i
couldn't decide which meat to use so i
added both it doesn't have a lot of
sauce but it's got an intense flavor in
it oh
it's chicken and pork
i've heard people do that actually but
i've never made it myself it's a really
big chicken
with the small little pork it smells
more vinegary than the usual double i
see the danger the little black pepper
ball don't don't have this in your mouth
the meat looks tender and it looks like
it's well cooked and it's got the
peppercorns which i love no no ginger
unless it's under there let's see
it's tender it's succulent
it's not that chewy it's nice and tender
it's lovely
[Music]
oh i like this adobo okay the pork's
good let's try the chicken
[Music]
hmm
how many items have i said now i think
you're gonna have to leave some on the
side for me i'm gonna finish this i
reckon they actually um you know
marinated overnight to get that
juiciness the sauce is thick which is
good my favorite thing about this adobo
is probably the mixture of the chicken
and the pork taste is amazing actually i
really like it i would also maybe cut up
the chicken maybe have it the same size
as the pork it's nice just i haven't got
that vinegary and the sauces it's just
something maybe a little bit more the
meat's perfect i thought and it's
something that i would really like to
eat again i would give this score seven
out of ten
i would give this a double dish a nine
out of ten i give this a double an eight
out ten
[Music]
hey
i'm so happy thank you so much
really can they try again
it's okay i'm gonna eat some more of
mine at home anyway
