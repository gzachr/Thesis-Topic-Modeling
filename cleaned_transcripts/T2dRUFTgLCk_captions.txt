i'm at a beautiful farm here in the netherlands 
you can see behind me now you might wonder why  
i'm at a farm because i'm going to make a 
filipino dessert but i need some eggs for  
this dessert and i thought it would be really 
nice to have really fresh eggs okay so let's  
go inside and see what they have my shoes 
might get a little bit dirty but that's okay  
so it looks really beautiful and it's a very nice 
weather today i'm excited to look for the manok
manok so you can see i found the chicken here i 
hope they have some fresh eggs that we can buy  
so we're here in the store guys it's a beautiful  
store here in the farm and they 
have lots of ingredients i can see  
so let's have a look if they have something 
very tasty that we can bring home okay  
so it looks like these are all fresh freshly made 
juices it's like uh they have cranberry juice and  
apple juice you know and that i believe they made 
them make them here i make them fresh in-house
oh they even have nice ice cream here  
i love carrot juice so i'm gonna bring 
one bottle of this carrot juice okay
so they even sell meat here 
so let's bring also some meat  
never know maybe we're going to make 
another tasty dish what's up yeah okay
okay
so first i'm going to split the x i will use two 
whole eggs okay and the rest is gonna be only the
yolk
so we're adding one can of condensed milk we 
will also add one pack of cream cooking cream  
to make it a little bit more rich in
flavor
a little bit of salt
just to get a little bit extra flavor
and finally i will add a little bit of sugar 
because this was an unsweetened uh condensed  
milk okay so we need it's a dessert so 
i'm gonna make it a little bit sweet  
and then we're gonna whisk everything together
now i have this tiny bottle with 
ube flavor okay it's a purple yam  
flavoring so we're gonna have a look at 
this oh wow it really smells like ube
wow look at that it's like flowers
and then we'll we'll mix everything wow ganda no
so the next step is melting the sugar
it's already melting guys and 
it's turning brown a little bit  
so now it's becoming like a real caramel 
there's a little bit of lumps in there  
which is a bit hard to get out but i think 
it's okay we give a nice crispy texture at  
the bot.. at the top okay so we're gonna 
quickly fill these cups with the caramel
uh the caramel smells amazing
so we're going to add some 
hot water just beside the cups
just a little layer
so i'm going to cover these and we will put them 
in the oven on 190 degrees celsius for one hour
so it went in the oven i let it cool off 
and then put it in the fridge overnight  
so we're gonna turn it around and i can 
already see guys it's a beautiful color
there we go
let's try a little bit of a design 
guys this is like a farmer's style
oh wow real leche flan flavor and it has 
a little bit uh subtle ube flavor as well
