- Welcome back YouTube.
Today we're gonna be trying
some delicious Filipino food.
You know, there was a
place called Seafood City.
It's a supermarket that just
opened up right where we live.
Apparently, it's a big
supermarket in the Philippine.
And we bought a bunch of delicious food
from that store today.
It was a super long line.
It was super cold.
But the food smells so good right now.
And I got a lot of Filipino friends.
I got a Filipino girlfriend,
but to be honest most
Filipino food I ever eaten
was probably just adobo and jollibee.
So a lot of things here
are pretty much my first
time trying it out.
And I'll tell you my
experience as I try them out.
(upbeat rock music)
Okay. So the very first
thing I want to try
is the barbecue squid.
Now, I had squid before,
but nothing like the way they do it here.
But, but yeah, let's try it.
And apparently to eat this,
you have to dip it in this sauce.
I think it's a vinegar.
So let's try that.
Yeah, the vinegar is kind of the strong.
Let me try it without the vinegar.
(chews)
I like the way it was cooked.
It's very chewy.
I don't know if they use like
wood charcoal or what it is,
but I could feel like a good flavor.
All of the squid.
And I actually don't
like the vinegar sauce.
I feel like the vinegar
sauce is too strong,
but apparently you're supposed
to eat it with vinegar.
Like out of a score of 10.
That's probably like a six or seven.
It was pretty delicious.
I would eat it.
Okay. The second thing
I want to try is thing.
I think it's called dinuguana.
(laughs)
- [Man Speaking] Dinuguan.
- Bad, bad, bad.
Yeah. I'm going to try this.
Yeah, apparently it's pork blood.
What? Pork in there? I'm not sure.
- [Man Speaking] Eat it with rice.
- Let me eat without rice first.
So let me smell it first.
- [Man Speaking] Wait, is
that pork or pepper you there?
It like pepper.
- No, it's a pepper.
(man laughs)
- [Man Speaking] It's not even pork.
(man laughs)
- [Man Speaking] That's a good footage.
(man laughs)
(coughs)
- Why would they put pepper in this?
- [Man Speaking] It adds to the flavor.
You're not supposed to eat it.
(man laughs)
- I don't know.
It was covered in pork blood.
I didn't know it's pepper.
(man laughs)
- So let's try this again.
My tongue is so spicy from the pepper.
I didn't realize there's pepper.
Why would you put pepper in there?
It's pretty deceiving.
Let's find a piece of pork.
Yeah. So this definitely smells like pork.
(coughs)
(sniffs)
Let's try this.
It's a little bit weird.
Cause usually when you,
when I eat pork,
there was meat, right?
I feel like I just ate a,
like a piece of fat, I don't know.
Maybe let me try the other piece.
I'm trying to find an
actual piece of meat.
Not gonna lie, this, this doesn't.
I don't like the color.
(sniffs)
It's not gross, but I don't know.
I think this is probably
a better piece of meat.
So I'm gonna try this.
Yeah. So this, this one this okay.
It kind of reminds me of Indian food.
Probably like seven,
seven, seven or eight.
Like, I don't mind eating this.
I just don't know why you would
put pepper in this, right.
Cause I accidentally ate that.
But yeah, overall I like this.
I would recommend it,
but just be careful of the pepper.
Okay. So don't kill me,
but the next thing I'm going
to try this called bergeron.
Ant it's apparently a,
a shrimp sauce.
Apparently, it's pretty popular.
Every Filipino house apparently has that.
I haven't seen it.
I haven't seen it.
My girlfriend never showed me this,
But yeah, let's try it.
It's a shrimp sauce.
Yeah. It definitely smells like shrimp.
But it looks like a pepper.
You know, the Chinese
pepper you get that's red.
Yeah like the chili pepper.
It looks like a Chinese chili pepper.
It smells like shrimp.
It's really greasy. Yeah. I
don't know how you eat this.
I'm just gonna try this.
I'm going to try this, a taste test.
It's okay.
But I'm just giving
like a raw taste, right?
Like that's okay. I just,
Okay, let's try with rice.
So now I'm going to try with rice.
Let's see.
Yeah. So I don't know what to say.
It's, it's just, it tastes like shrimp.
It's like a sauce.
You put it on rice.
I mean, rice is good as it is.
I don't know why even need
this, but it's not bad.
Our guests, if you like shrimp.
Yeah. You can eat it.
So out of 10,
probably again like six, seven.
Like is this something
I will eat every day?
I don't, I don't, I don't think so.
Cause I like rice.
The shrimp taste is pretty strong.
I mean, it's, it's not bad,
but just, I don't I don't get
like why you put this on rice every day,
but yeah, it's okay.
All right.
So the next thing I'm gonna try is a
crispy pork bun,
crispy pork bun.
So look at this box, right?
This is your typical French fries box.
And because I'm trying these
I want to talk about the price.
This is for $12.82.
I think this is really expensive.
Because you know, our French fries
it's like $2 or $3.
This is $12, $13.
So I mean, after this much, this expense
I'm guessing this is a delicacy
in the Philippine, right?
It must be.
And apparently this is just a,
this is just fried pork butt.
But anyways, let's give this a try.
(chews)
Yeah. So let me try this again.
(chews)
So it's pretty chewy, it's pretty crispy,
but as kind of greasy, right.
And it's kind of gross if you
think this is a pig's butt,
but I like it.
(laughs)
I like it.
(laughs)
I guess I like to eat pig's butt.
That's something new, right?
This is actually pretty tasty.
But just don't think about
pigs' butt when you eat it.
So let me dip it in the sauce.
(chews)
I think I like it without the sauce.
'Cause once you have the sauce,
you don't taste a pig butt anymore.
It just, it has no taste.
It just chewy and crispy.
And I, me personally,
I love the smell, the
taste of a pig's butt.
Nah, I'm just joking,
but this is pretty good.
So this out rush should
give it a high score.
I probably give it an eight or a nine.
And I would definitely recommend it.
- [Man Speaking] Is it worth $12.82?
- Is it worth 12...
12.82?
It's hard as say, right?
Cause like for $13,
you know, like as a Chinese person
I'm expecting a meal, right?
You know, like, like a
meal from McDonald's.
So it's hard for me to justify it,
but I would recommend it.
You know, if this was on a discount,
you know, if there's a
50% off a fried pig butt
I'll definitely you know, go
out of my house and buy it.
But at $13 I think it's too expensive,
but I'd still recommend it.
So the next thing we're gonna
try is chicken skin garlic.
So this is basically fried chicken skin.
And guess what?
The price is also $12.
$12.99.
And look at this.
Compare the two of them.
This is way bigger, you
a get way bigger portion.
But I don't know, if this
is cheaper than that.
So I'm giving this is not as good,
but I don't know.
Let's just give it a try.
(chews)
So yeah.
So you know when go to a KFC,
for jollibee, like the best
part is the chicken skin.
And this feels like.
if you take the chicken and skin now
left it in their freezer for like a week
it's just, it's just crunchy,
there's no taste, no flavor.
And missing the, the pig
butt taste, you know.
I'm missing the big, the
pig butt smell, right?
So I mean, if you can't afford a pig butt,
I mean, this is a good alternative, but.
(laughs)
I mean, this is okay,
but nothing beats like fried pig butt.
So yeah, this is probably
like a five or six.
I mean, you could eat it for a snack.
I could see me eating a self,
me eating this for a snack.
But if I'm really craving,
you know, if it's my
anniversary with my girlfriend,
I want to surprise her
with some fried pig butt.
This is, this is the way to go, right?
This is, this is more like, you know
on your first day, right?
The fried pig butt is more like
for Valentine's day, for anniversary.
So next we're gonna try the scr...
Haaa.
(man laughs)
(chuckles)
So next we're gonna try to skewer.
Aah.
(all laugh)
- [Man Speaking] Skewers.
- I could say this.
So the next thing we're
gonna try, it's the skewers
The skewers.
What Dan is that right?
So the next thing we're
gonna try as the skewers.
(laughs)
Okay. So the next thing
I'm gonna try is the s...
(all laugh)
- [Man Speaking] May be you
should be the video Luke.
- I Feel stupid.
Okay. So the next thing I'm
gonna try is this thing,
let's call it the skewer.
(all laugh)
- [Man Speaking] Counting back.
Can you say it properly.
- Okay. No, no, no.
I got this.
I got this.
So the next thing we're going to try
is the barbecue skewers.
This is pork.
So I'll take that out.
I think this was what? $3 for skewers.
(chews)
That's pretty good.
They have a lot of flavor on top.
I mean, I like it.
I mean, a lot of Filipino
restaurant have this.
It's like a nice staple
food, I would say at dinner.
Definitely recommend this
is probably seven out of 10.
I think this is chicken.
I personally like the
chicken better than the,
than the pork.
The chicken just feels like a softer meat.
But yeah, out the two would
probably recommend the chicken.
Alright, now it's time for dessert.
So apparently this is a fried banana.
This is very odd to me
because banana is supposed
to be curved, right?
I don't know why banana is straight.
Cause I don't know, straight banana?
That's a little bit suspicious to me.
But, but yeah. So apparently
it's a fried banana
inside of spring rod.
So let's open it up the banana.
So yeah, it was actually a banana,
they didn't lie to me.
Like you could see the banana here.
But, and also
I got to say this banana is
bigger than the average banana
I've seen here in Canada.
(laughs)
I don't know what kind of banana
people in the Philippines.
But, this is your average size
banana in the Philippines.
This is like the size of
banana here in Canada.
I would say right?
And maybe in China, maybe the
banana are too kind of half,
I don't know.
But, but yeah, this is a long
banana from the Philippine.
(laughs)
I, I, I just got to say that, right?
But anyways, enough jokes.
Let's. let's, let's try this out.
Okay. I don't want to just
pull up in my mouth, okay?
I got to take a piece out, right?
This is a PG show.
So let me, let me take a piece of banana.
(chews)
Yeah, it's actually pretty good.
Like that banana usually like
you have that banana taste.
It's hard to describe but it is.
But this one it tastes a
little bit sweeter, all right?
I feel like they probably
coat it with sugar.
As a dessert, it's okay.
I would probably give it a seven or eight.
But because it's a banana,
subtract two points.
Cause why eat a banana
for dessert, as a guy?
That's just weird.
(laughs)
So because of that, I've had
to give it like, you know,
a four or five on a dessert scale.
But I know I'm not supposed to do this,
but I'm gonna try it with a sauce,
see if it makes a difference.
Cause apparently it feels like
you guys eat everything with a sauce
in the Philippines, right?
So let me try it with a sauce.
Let me try with a vinegar sauce.
(chews)
Yeah. That, that doesn't do anything.
It's probably even worse.
So don't, don't eat your
banana with the sauce.
And now we're gonna try deep fried banana.
So yeah, this is kind
of interesting, right?
You got a lump banana and short banana.
What's the deal bananas, right?
This is like an average
banana I'm expecting.
But when I saw this long banana?
Oh my God.
Like, I don't know what's going on here,.
But yeah. So this is a fried banana.
So that's way it looks like.
Now, when you have a banana this size
I could put it all in my
mouth in one go, right?
I mean, I feel like this is probably
a more suitable snack, right?
Something like this.
I mean, there's, there's no way
I will put that whole thing in my mouth.
But this thing I could actually
put the whole thing in my mouth.
But yeah. Let me just try this.
Yeah. Like surprising, this is also sweet.
Like the inside it's
actually really sweet.
So this is,
I would say this is definitely
a better than this dessert.
Not only because of the
taste also because the size.
I just feel, this is a more
appropriate size for a snack.
So out of 10, I'd probably
give it like, you know,
seven out of eight or
seven, eight out of 10.
That's a pretty good snack.
Okay. So the next thing we're going to try
is the ube halaya.
A halaya.
So this is purple yam.
And it's about $11.
Let's open this up.
Oh my God.
This looks like Play-Doh.
This honestly looks like Play-Doh.
It smells like candy,
like candy even open it for 2, 3 hours.
So let's give this a try.
So yeah.
It really has a Play-Doh texture.
It looks like Play-Doh.
So let me, let me try it.
So it's very soft, very squishy.
Very sweet.
If I were to describe it,
it tastes like, like candy
that's freshly melted down.
It's like, like one of those
candy that you have as a kid
but you know, like it's been
really hot and as it's melted,
but it's very, very soft, right?
It's like a candy cake.
A melted candy cake.
So it's pretty good.
I, I would say maybe like
six or seven out of 10.
I would recommend it.
But it just looks like Play-Doh.
Okay. So the last thing we're gonna try
is this bubble tea drink.
It's called a PUCO pendant.
PUCO pendant.
So apparently it's made out of coconut.
I don't know how this is green, right?
Are using coconut tree leaves.
I'm not sure.
Maybe just a flavor.
It's just a coloring.
I don't know.
But it's apparently supposed
to be a coconut drink as green.
So let me just give it a try
Personally, it's okay.
I would drink it if I'm on a desert
and I have nothing else to drink.
But you know, why pay money to,
for this kind of drink?
Probably not.
It kind of tastes like,
to me personally, it has
like a plastic kind of taste.
I don't really taste the coconut.
I could see why people like that drink.
But I just mean personally.
I don't know.
I don't like it.
Out of 10 is probably a six or seven
for someone who would like this flavor.
But yeah, me personally,
I'd probably take a pass.
But it's not a bad drink.
So yeah, there you have it guys.
We tried all of these
foods from Seafood City.
And I will say it the winner,
my favorite, is still the fried pig butt.
Now, this is so crispy, so chewy.
And I could see this as a perfect
snack for Valentine's day.
But the only thing I don't like
is just how expensive it is.
But yeah.
