hey guys! my name is Victor and this is
Grace
I'm canadian and I'm taiwanese
today's video we want to talk about some
dating experience with some stereotype
of asian girls
yup
so from your experience and from 
my western friends have ever asked me
i want to know about let's say four or
five things
to see if it's true yeah from your experience
shoot!
i'd love to answer
okay first.. are asian girls more clingy?
clingy?
yeah like need more
time with their other half
but westerner will be more independent. is it true?
just a disclaimer before i answer everything
not everyone is the same! okay?
our asian goes more clingy? i would say
based on my experience
yes.
oops is it my fault?
i would say it's
in a good way though because
number one, i actually prefer it rather than you
know
not reciprocating anything from
 my partner
so if you were like not that clingy, just
a comparison, i'd be like..
is there something wrong? does she really want to spend time with me?
but then if someone's clingy
not to the point that it's over clingy
it's just
you know like a good amount of clingy
it's like
oh i feel good because she really wants
to spend time with me
yes
and like she wants to be with me at a certain time
some westerners won't like it because
it's like hey i want to spend time with you
did I do that?
no i'm just
like i want to spend time with you
and all that stuff and they'll be like
no like i have things to do
like go
 
yeah exactly like everyone's different
but for me it's a good thing
you hear something from them like
i thought I'm dependent
don't ask me for.. well you're
different i'm not
going i'm not gonna ask you anymore
spend with me
you have another juicy one?
this is not
juicy but
do we take too many selfies?
yes
so many pictures
let's take a selfie here
oh my god
everywhere you go there's pictures
pictures
pictures
you like to take
pictures!
i love to take pictures
but he doesn't want
to take selfies
i can't do selfies though
yeah we! Weird right?
I'm the selfie...
anyways it's not an issue to me
because i love taking
pictures
but i'm sure it's
different for other guys out there
not just guys, my british friends, my
classmates
grace, really again? another selfie?
why not? sure but really another one?
yeah we're in different locations yo
yo
mate
do asian girls care about food a lot like when you guys go dating..
sometimes it could be a pain in the ass
tell me about the past experience it's
not it's not like a pain in the ass but
like
that's good it's like you want
different you want different cuisines
western, japanese, korean, taiwanese, you know
whatever it is
like every single time is different so
it's like every single time you go out
with them it's like
oh i'm experiencing something new
oh i think why i  will put it in that way
like the pain in the ass is because when
my
when my foreign friends, westerner friends, when they go over on a date he will say
let's have a burger today and she'll be like
we just had breakfast last week it's a
it's been a week
but for themselves so it's been a week
yeah but for
us we just had a burger why we have to
what do you what would you like to have
the same food again
no that's true
we won't do it they say we we want to
have like
different cuisine every day
i would just say
that westerners are not
not all of them uh western girls
are not open to all the cuisines
like their their selection of food
varies like very european and western
and then the asian cuisine would be more
like
you know your typical chinese food your
typical take out food
thai food like pad thai which has been
westernized as well
like all of that stuff like it's all...
you know, you can't really go outside of
that realm
it's the same thing over and over again
you go to a fancy restaurant and it's
still
pad thai and i mean
it better be a good pad thai
maybe maybe
it's just like less selection
like than they would prefer
number four
this one i don't know i don't want to
be the judge.. they say
they asked me if it's true like you
say
asian girls like to be cute or
pretend they're pretending oh baby
you know
i would say yeah
use baby voice
and pretend they're still like a kid
yeah i would say more than western girls
yes
like you do see you do see that in western girls but to the point that uh i would say if
a western guy comes into asia
and realizes this
he would think oh
they're weird like it would be like too
childish for them yeah
my friend was like..
am i dating a
seven years old girl why you need to use
the voice to talk to me
yeah like
girls in canada are like that sometimes
but to a point that there's a limit oh so
can i use something
to talk to you?? i can't
good try
im not violent..
okay this is a very difficult one
shoot
from our experience or from other other
people's experience as you see.. like asian girls
would ask your commitment earlier than westerners
we want to
see if you commit to this relationship
and we'll have family with us
you know what you know what I mean?
i want to be serious
yeah i think that's a good stereotype
again like i think it's part of the
culture
but i would rather prefer that than
trying to gauge, hey like are we
is it going somewhere or is it just like
you know a fling
you never know until
you actually talk to them and then
most of the time when you talk to them
it's like eh that's date but like you
know
put labels on it we can say girlfriend
boyfriend
you know if you're dating it's not like
you're serious
but if you're dating with an asian girl
it's like you're actually in a relationship
here's the difference
saying i guess the same with asian, right?
but the difference is that the
actual feeling
so with asians, correct me if i'm wrong, with asians you go on seeing someone is
like oh okay we're going to date like
and we'll see
and if you commit to each other that's
when you start really
feeling something right? and that's
when you know it's serious
but for westerners it's different you go
seeing someone
to check if like oh maybe they're
compatible with me maybe you're good dating and go from there
and you're dating already exclusive but
that doesn't mean that they love each other
that doesn't mean commitment
They are still committed but that doesn't mean they love each other they have feelings
for each other like maybe it's starting
to grow
but it's not  as strong
there's a stage between yeah
it's not as strong
i think that's the major difference and then obviously when you're dating
like feelings grow and then
that's the major difference between
dating stages in
western society
gotcha so there's three stages
yeah well four because seeing someone, dating someone, commitment, and then family
and we are more like three stages
gotcha yes i figured a lot of people
westerners,
told me they don't they don't tell the
magic words
like i love you maybe
until like really far ahead
it's not like one month
two months it can be years
Why?
I dont know!
you've been asking me a question now
i have a question for taiwanese girls
Okay
maybe you can answer
it, maybe not
is it true that asian girls
or taiwanese girls have white fever?
Do you consider yourself as white? i
would say i'm white washed because like i
have color
oh white wash...
banana banana
so you're not white but inside you are
BANANA!
okay back to the question
is it true?
do we have white fever..
depends you met a lot of my my friends
half of them it's not i don't like
white people they just don't think they
would date
white people because they think they're
too much effort
too much effort and like careless
independent all that stuff right?
no but my friends are more independent
to be honest they don't they don't care
about if
their partners are too independent but
they
they do care about putting too much like
more effort
you know what i mean like when you don't
want to spend time
on polishing your language
in order to have a better conversation
with your other half
you're like oh my god after a long day at work
i still need to explain again and again of what i'm thinking
i see you
you what i mean?
but some of my friends
not a lot they're like oh yeah i like
white people they're
hot they're hot and
you guys care about body shape more i
would say that
and you're more confident
so do we have?
half half i guess
half half depends on the person right ?
yeah really and we do have like a certain friends
who love white people
preferences
preferences
keyword: preferences
okay!
