do you like mochi or mango sticky rice
then you're gonna love this dessert it's
my favorite
it's called biko and it's from the
philippines first i take coconut sugar
and coconut milk and i cook them down
until they thicken and caramelize
in the meantime i cook sticky rice in
the rice cooker cutting back a bit on
the water so i can continue to cook the
rice in the syrup
after when the sweet coconut syrup has
thickened up i dump the sticky rice in
and cook them together until the rice is
fully cooked i layer it atop banana
leaves to impart some of that banana
leaf flavor
it reminds me of home this dessert is my
ultimate weakness
i can't not eat it just making this
video makes me crave it
