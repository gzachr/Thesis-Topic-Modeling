hello everyone hello and good morning it is 
will and jose and today's our first full day  
in cebu so we woke up at 6 00 a.m we got dressed 
we are ready to go explore the city a little bit  
yep so tag along and get yourself 
ready because there's a lot to see  
and do here yeah let's go with 
some first impressions guys  
holy freaking crap look at this
this is a view whoa this was worth the drive up 
this was worth the drive and it was quite the  
drive oh my gosh so cool obsessed good morning 
guys and welcome to the very top of cebu city  
we're here at tops lookout where 
you're able where's the camera going  
we're worried it's about 100 pesos each person 
i really don't know the conversion in usd so  
i'll just put it down here um i'll work on 
that while we're here and it's beautiful  
i mean you get this full 360 view of cebu 
city when you walk in you get the whole city  
escape and then you take a couple steps to 
your left or a couple steps to your right  
and you get these luscious green mountain 
tops peeking through like the mist of clouds  
and now the sun's coming out which just makes 
it even better but the greenery here is insane  
guys first impressions i really like cebu city i 
like it a lot it's huge there's lots of buildings  
there's a lot of chaos going on organized 
chaos i'm sure a lot of cars a lot of bicycles  
a lot of people a lot of buildings a lot 
of a lot of english language and i know  
that doesn't sound like that should 
be a big thing no there's a lot of  
english we have not seen that much english 
since we were back home in the states so  
it's gonna take some getting used 
to which is a weird thing to say but  
we've gotten so accustomed to seeing everything 
in thai that yeah but no we like it we love it  
there's a lot to say and we're going to cut 
this part because you were not wait no i you  
didn't i didn't require an extra for the scene i 
just don't say but what makes and if this camera  
is focused on you and not on me i'm so pissed off 
what i'm trying to say is that the best part about  
the philippines well one of the best things 
so far is that they have popeyes here weston  
job why did you not tell us they had popeyes 
the first night we got here in manila for our
why do you not tell us with popeyes like the 
first night we got here for our layover in manila  
we saw popeyes we opened up our grab app 
and we immediately ordered and could not  
have been more happy now that we gave 
you guys a perspective of the whole city  
from the very top we're gonna start making our way 
down to this awesome we'll see we'll see we'll see  
just a short eight minute drive from the 
viewpoint and there's a love story behind this  
there was this married couple in the year of 2012 
his wife died of cancer and afterwards he decided  
to put 80 million pesos into this beautiful 
structure behind us and inside the structure are  
a lot of her belongings so if that's not true love 
then i don't know what is and if there ever comes  
a time where i pass before will you better build 
a structure and sorry if there ever becomes a time  
yeah just because you're six years younger we're 
not gonna have the conversation that sad but yeah
something jose did not tell you guys is that it's 
called the tip of leia because that's her name  
the more you know
i'm crying because i got bitten by a mosquito  
no this is sad this is sad guys it's so 
pretty it's beautiful what a sentiment
you can walk around the whole temple ground or the 
whole structure ground and look through these like  
cage-like windows and see all the belongings 
that belong to the layout all this
a babe
so we ended up coming to the cebu heritage 
monument figured we kind of immersed ourselves  
in some history knowing that we don't know 
much about the philippines and what better way  
to do it than here and the monument pretty 
much tells you kind of the history behind  
cebu city and how it was invaded and 
how that kind of ended it's nice man  
giving us a little history lesson this is 
before she says everyone was saying okay
this one and this is when they uh brought 
christianity correct yeah okay guys that  
was so super cool we were just me and jose know 
nothing so we're trying to figure it out on google  
and then eduardo works here he's lived here inside 
this for 10 years now he watches the grounds  
and he came gives the story of every depiction 
here it was really really really cool and yeah  
that's actually kind of how it's been ever since 
we got to the philippines people are super nice  
and come up to us and interact so we're loving it 
so far first impressions man you guys are killing  
it here we love it we love it we love it already 
also one thing to know and one thing i need to  
get accustomed to not seeing are temples now that 
we're in the philippines uh the philippine people  
are mainly identified as christians um catholic 
and catholics so there will be no signs of any  
buddhist temples whatsoever and yeah there might 
be some there might be some but i'm excited to  
see all the cathedrals because that's where 
we came from in the states and how intricate  
they are in their interpretation of them in the 
philippines you know 7-eleven good old 7-eleven  
but guys guess what there aren't that many here 
as they are in thailand that's so sad it's so sad
all right guys so as you can see 
we just walked through the basilica  
el nino um they're doing 
maths inside but of course  
there's not enough people in space so they also 
have a section set up outside for people to do  
it which i think is incredible and necessary um 
so we're gonna go on the other side of it and  
see if we can get inside it's the oldest 
church in all of cebu we have to see it
so mr jose ricardo martinez also known as my 
boyfriend my partner my best friend anyway so  
what are your first impressions of philippines so 
far cebu city i am really enjoying it i feel like  
there's a level of comfort from back home knowing 
that the philippines have some spanish background  
in it there's a lot of streets here that are 
named after like girl you are from america  
no but what i'm trying to get at is that there's 
like a lot of spanish words here that i can't  
understand so it makes me feel like i can somewhat 
connect with them even though there's still a huge  
disconnect they speak english yeah they speak 
english but then there's also some spanish  
words in there whether weather's way cooler than 
thailand so that's plus and i'm just excited to  
see what else there is to see i mean we came 
to the philippines for experiential moments  
so let's let's live it up all right babe what are 
your thoughts of the philippines stuff so far so  
to be quite honest it's a little anxious because 
we just came from thailand like literally two days  
ago just came from thailand let me tell you i 
already love the philippines there's nothing to  
dislike i love the organized chaos of the 
city i love how interactive everything is  
how busy it is and i can't wait to see more 
and explore more but my first impressions are  
two thumbs up it's been well over 24 hours now 
since we've landed here in the philippines and  
there's so so much to digest we gave you a little 
snippet of our first impressions but i'm sure  
there's gonna be way more where that came from 
so be sure to stay tuned and like subscribe and  
hit that bell notification for our next video 
we're already like falling in love here guys  
uh we're super excited to be here we 
cannot wait to go explore everything else  
and be on the lookout for our next video because 
i will tell you this it's going to be insane  
like we never thought we'd be doing this be 
on the lookout it's going to be the video  
philippines guys you have my approval me and jose 
went to the mall earlier today because we had to  
get some stuff get there walk by a restaurant 
they're playing baby one more time by brittany  
then we're coming home just now and jose

they start playing toxic any country that 
plays britney and shows her love for her
