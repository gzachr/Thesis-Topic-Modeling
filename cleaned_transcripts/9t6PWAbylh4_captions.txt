(music)
Oh yeah this is easy
How do you say "Hello" in Indonesian?
Hello is easy, it's just "Hallo"
Hallo
Hallo yeah
Hello, I think, we just in the Philippines, we say Hello but if you use it as a greeting, you say the word "Kamusta" it's like asking how are you
It's like the basic Hello for us
Oh Yeah, we actually use Hi, but spelled "Hai"
It's literally Hai
Yeah, like japanese Hai
Yeah yeah, like japanese Hai
yes yes
How about ahhhh
I am handsome, how do you say that?
I am handsome.... well okay
I think there are many ways
So the first one is
Saya Ganteng
Saya Ganteng
Yeah.. Saya means I
Ganteng means Handsome
Saya Ganteng 
(I am Handsome)
for Philippines, Ako is I
yeah Ako ay
gwapo
Gwapo means handsome
Ako ay gwapo
Yeah
Ako ay gwapo
(I am handsome)
(laughter)
(music)
Today do Indonesians/Filipinos still believe in mythical creatures?
Oh yeah, i think for example, ghost, like giants, we usually call this creature "Genderuwo"
It's like, it's a ghost but it has giant hands
Ahhh
yeah
Can you see it?
No I cannot see
No sorry, like how people can see them if it's you know like
I dunno
maybe
Do they need to go to the mountains?
yeah maybe maybe
Maybe there will find one
I don't know
Oh yeah
For the Philippines, we have this like, quite similar to vampire, but also different
like we have this "manananggal"
I'm not sure but I think "manananggal" is half  upper body only with wings and they eat either the blood or the babies
Is that manananggal or aswang, wait either that's manananggal or aswang I'm confused
Oh, I think I have similar one, we usually call it "Leyak"
It's only half and it's intestine
Oh my ghad
And it's flying
It's popular in Bali
Oh, in Bali?

Ummm....hahahah
I don't know, I'm sorry
Hmm, how about Manila?
Oh yeah yeah, I know Manila
I just know Manila actually
I'm sorry i'm so bad at this
For me maybe, Bali for me, because of the beaches
It's very famous
I think many foreigners know about Bali but they actually don't really know about Indonesia
They just know Bali and What is Indonesia?, I just know Bali
Is there like a difference between Bali and Indonesia?
Yeah yeah because it's very free
I mean their rule is very different in Bali, it's kinda free more, than the other area of Indonesia
Like how free?
Yeah, like we can drink alcohol there, but in my hometown, we cannot drink alcohol yeah so
Maybe because is it a tourist spot?
Yeah maybe because it's a tourist spot
Oh okay, wow

Last Question
(music)
What words do you know that are similar in Filipino and Indonesian?
Okay, I'm gonna give one
Mahal
is expensive
Oh yeah, Mahal is expensive it's the same in Indonesia
Bawang
Yeah bawang, garlic
garlic, yeah bawang is garlic
What else?
Gunting
yeah gunting is Scissors 
Scissors
It's the same
Buwaya?
Yeah, buwaya, crocodile, buwaya
And like buwan (moon)
and bulan (moon)
It's bulan, yeah
Buwan for filipino but I think in several Filipino languages it's also bulan
Oh, it's also Bulan
Oh, I remember... Payung (umbrella)
Payong (umbrella), yeah
I remember when I go out and you said "oh it's the same"
It's a funny story, like did you mention the word payong like I asked if it's similar, it's quite similar in the Philippines
but I think we use Payong with an O
Oh with an O, but in Indonesia it's with U
It's Payung
But I think Payung is acceptable in the Philippines, I'm not sure
It's so similar
So that's it guys
I hope you like it
