and I see this with you...
Don't be long...
Why I really like seeing a man's body from behind...
Because it looks like broad and certainly handsome guys...
Lots of decoration like stars...
like smiley emojis...
Their style is nuanced in black and white...
I really love it when they shake their bodies like this...
Whoa...Stell's face is so handsome here...
Woww...Their aura is the same as BTS...
Really cool...
I love Stell's black hair colour here...
Looks more handsome...
Oh...I want to watch their concert live...
Ouch...There's a woman blocking...
They remain powerful...
In every appearance, they're always powerful...
then...I really like their style...
I've never seen their style complicated...
Their style is simple and pleasing to the eye...
Who is this?
Justin...right?
Still my favorite is Sejun and Stell...
Gosh...Stell is really handsome here with his black hair...
See...Really Powerful...
Among them, 3 people wear black long jeans...
and...2 people wear white long jeans...
Gosh...
I feel like watching their concert live guys...
Amazing...My goodness...
For me, my goodness they're so cool...
They can already be aligned with BTS...
Because of any dance they can do it...My goodness...
and in their every move, when they bring a song or dance cover is always powerful...
Gosh...Full of energy...
then here, as usual I always focus on my 2 favorites "Sejun and Stell"
and here, I really love seeing Stell...
Stell with his black hair...
As usual too, I always like their style
I've never seen SB19 style complicated...
Their style is always simple and really pleasing to the eye...
Here seems to be dominated by black and white colour...
Earlier, there were some who wear black long jeans...
and there were 2 people wear white long jeans...
Gosh...I feel like watching their concert live...
When do they have a concert in Indonesia?
Oh...I want to watch their live while carrying their photos...
