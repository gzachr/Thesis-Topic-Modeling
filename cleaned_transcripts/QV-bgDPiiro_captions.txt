hello everyone and welcome to a new episode here 
in the Philippines and today is another Friday  
afternoon here in BGC area and today we have an 
important Mission as you've seen as in the titles  
today we're getting a cut so now we're gonna 
head into outside of BGC because here I know  
in BGC there are many like really like I would 
say mid-class to high-class premium haircuts but  
today we're going to get a Filipino cut so today 
we're going to head out of BGC and go to uh the  
local area which is just outside here and recently 
we actually discovered a shortcut that leads you  
directly from BGC to the outskirt of it as you 
can see on the other side that's the outs got  
the biggest already so today we're gonna head over 
there and I'm going to show you guys shortcut that  
I discovered recently with Alina so uh it's just 
going straight we're almost there so uh compared  
with uh it's actually my first time ever getting 
a haircut in my travels because I think during  
my six months Adventure solo Adventure before 
I now had a single haircut in other countries  
just because I was giving this long hair 
this like Japanese looking Korean haircut  
um but now today I think it's finally time for 
me to get a little bit of trim and get away  
just along here so that it's more breathable 
and Alina is going to be a bit upset this one  
all right let's see let me show you guys this 
shortcut so I only recently discovered this  
Trail and uh just just around the corner 
of near Uptown and uh the Japanese Mall
all right let's see
usually usually there is like a security 
person sitting here all right let's see
okay and now we are on the other 
side of BTC on the outskirt so as  
soon as you arrive you see a lot of 
street food vendors here already whoa  
traffic some coconut juice I believe and uh 
it's my first time in this area so uh it's  
quite an interesting experience walking 
around local streets here not even just  
sure where I can find a haircut place but uh 
yeah I guess let's walk around hello hello
it's only like a war difference outside 
of a BTC let's see let's see where we go
oh sold out everywhere with 
some sort of announcement  
wow this area of many Street Food 
and it's just on the outskirt of BGC
I'm not I don't even know where I should 
begin this uh this Vlog because simply I  
don't know where to find a good 
haircut place you know normally  
when you go to a haircut place gotta 
look for reviews and everything but  
yeah this place is brand new and I 
haven't seen any haircut places here
looks like we're in some 
very very local streets so  
I'm not too sure how I can find a good haircut 
place but let me maybe I have to ask someone else
there's a lot of announcement around here
wow it's like a whole different part of BGC 
outside BGC let's try to listen to what they say
it's not in English let's keep 
going straight and see what's there  
oh bell ringing hello hello wow many 
tricycles yeah this uh it's a local  
side of Manila that we haven't been exploded 
enough we haven't explored enough around here  
well maybe I can find a lot of hidden gems here oh 
dogs chained up oh that's the one creepy doll pet  
oh wow this is uh this feels like 
so different to the Manila I know
wow that's under the tricycle oh this is in 
Manila it's been so different all of a sudden  
simply because we haven't explored Manila 
enough oh I don't want to talk too loud
all right and I heard like these small shops 
actually have a name that they sell um things that  
are in smaller portion compared to like you know 
normal retail places they sell in small portion  
because um I think some people explain tell me 
explain some people they maybe don't have the  
budget to afford like um like buying in a whole 
pack that's why they only buy a small portion of  
that product or some shampoo they sell in sachets 
so it's easier for people to buy it hello hello
many hard workers hard-working uh tricycle drivers 
here all right I can see the BGC building around  
here but this really feels like a just separate 
between a wall and it looks a whole lot different  
is that fire truck hello just wondering 
oh do you know where can I find hiccups  
just down there okay okay thank you  
oh not gonna lie it's been a while it's been a 
while since I've gone out solo vlogging you know  
um without Alina so it's a little bit unusual 
but I'm gonna get used to it very soon I think
what is this satellite office  
the guys that just keep going straight so I'm 
just gonna keep going and see what's in front
let's see what's in front
waiting to get the passenger pills we haven't 
actually wrote a tricycle here in Manila yet  
but uh it looks like there are many available here
some interesting experience looking a lot 
I've been nerve-wracking because this is  
not the usual environment 
that I was in hello hello
oh just wondering where is haircut 
oh keep going straight okay okay
all right keep going Shake very 
friendly kuya say it's going straight  
karindaria oh budget meal looks like sweet 
and sour park that one I want to try what  
bachoy is is it I always think like bacho is 
something like bok choy something similar but I  
know it's different you get some sort of meat 
oh [ __ ] should I go there don't attack me
go guys it goes everywhere be very careful
I feel like if I don't watch out I might 
get run over here because uh the traffic  
here it feels like even a crazy at 
the BTC many strikes tricycle room  
all right let's see uh if I can find 
my backup place soon hello hello
oh many chickens just roaming on 
the streets yeah it's so different  
all right where is my haircut place I want to 
do laundry here too oh let's see and it's not  
too far away from BGC and we might be able 
to get do some laundry here oh interesting  
I'm very curious about the pricey actually 
hello can we start hello how much for laundry
oh okay yeah okay oh we live around 
here so maybe we'll come here
okay we'll bring our own 
thank you so much thank you
okay that's good to know good to know that there 
are more options for laundry around BGC because  
right now we're doing um something online 
and we we're paying like extra but they'll  
be paying a lot actually sometimes we pay 
500 to 700 pesos for a load of laundry each  
time including batteries and everything of course 
but uh yeah I feel like they are definitely more  
affordable options out there but we just didn't 
know all right what is this place called South  
there's a modified oh it's not a tricycle I 
thought it's tricycle looks like a tricycle though  
all right I might let the GoPro cool 
down a little bit and we'll continue  
okay I just walked down the street and I came 
across a shop like this and it looks like they  
sell a lot of individual packages inside 
compared to like normal retail stores so  
I'm really interested just to find out what's 
inside okay let's see oh I know this is a  
I thought this is Alina's favorite brand that 
looks very similar they've got many snacks here  
well actually guys I was thinking to do a Filipino 
snack review like I said filipino's neck reaction  
because you know we've been here for quite a 
bit now and we've got to try some Filipino snack  
and they have a lot of like typical snacks you 
can find in like big Supermarket I wonder if it's  
a bit more affordable hmm and they've got Oreo 
options here and these are assuming Filipino snack
oil that we might need
yeah I have a good feeling here 
that things will be more affordable  
big type of ice cream let's see all 
right even so uh separated coconut inside
okay interesting experience yeah because we 
don't see a lot of these in our BGC area only  
if you go to local areas and you see this kind 
of things they're more affordable hello hello  
how are you oh do you know where I 
can find haircut yeah haircut there  
okay oh okay over there on the right side okay 
tell them like selling my pool I don't know if I'm  
going right can you call someone younger than you 
he looks up quite young actually so I got Salma  
kuya is it not good I think you only call 
kuya if it's older than you whoa soccer
wow popcorns different colors
it's like a bus station looks like oh it's 
just a place where you're gonna sit here  
and hang but it looks like some sort of a bus

figure out how to cross the road yeah definitely
