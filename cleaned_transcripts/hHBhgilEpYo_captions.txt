this video is brought to you by Squarespace i 
can't believe i'm doing it but i'm a bit scared  
my first impression of the Philippines is 
out of this world at the moment we have left  
Vietnam and we are now in the Philippines over 
the next couple weeks we'll be exploring this  
exciting country and we are starting off our 
trip here in Manila we both have never been to  
the Philippines so we don't know what to expect 
so come and get to know the Philippines with us
300 that's too much 150. it's very 
close 10 minutes this is so cool
okay we don't know what we're doing we just 
hopped on uh the first mode of transportation  
we found what does this call what is this 
car a car yeah that car side car car driving  
a truck okay so we are in a tricycle and we are 
going to the sunday market in makati right now  
we should be only 10 minutes away because we 
are staying just a little bit outside makati
so how do we get there  
thank you thank you hello so we can't 
actually get to our destination because  
he said the tricycle and pedicabs are banned 
from entering the street another 15 minute walk
i don't know but i i feel like he kind of tricked 
us i don't know why but i just felt that way  
maybe there's probably other streets 
that he could take us but he decided to  
come here and show that you can't take 
the tricycle here and told us to walk  
we will never know well the positive thing 
is that we are now in the heart of makati  
where all the tall high-rises are and we're 
just gonna walk over to the sunday market  
which might be closed by the time we get there but 
it's okay because there's always jollibee right
this looks like uh hong kong like central side
and the street is so big and everything's 
so clean around here i'm impressed
we're finally here at the market but people are 
shutting down they're closing but we might be  
able to find something to eat here first this 
looks like it would have been a lovely market  
to come and get some food it's almost like 
farmers markets back in canada like artisan  
products people making jams and chutneys 
and breads and desserts home-cooked meals  
what is that sisig sisig yes is it filipino yes 
yes what's in it pork okay you want to try it  
sure do you eat it with anything yes you eat it 
with rice do you still have any rice no okay this  
looks good i want to try it okay let's go buy some 
rice to eat with this yeah can i buy some rice
how much 20 20 only 20
yes i love it because i'm a filipino citizen  
and filipino people are very 
lovely here and so many in Canada
thank you thank you
so i'm just looking at what pork sisig 
actually is so it's a popular filipino dish  
consists mostly of mainly of pig 
parts minced pork meat ears face  
and liver you like liver though yeah i eat pork 
ears so maybe like when there's a face it kind  
of sounds scary throw you off a bit this is our 
first filipino dish going right in and we just  
got like a simple uh fried rice to come to go with 
it gotta take some of the pork some of the rice
oh it's very tasty tastes just like um pork 
meat i don't taste any pork face or anything  
i guess pork face probably 
doesn't taste like pork face  
oh yeah you can see there's like chilis and 
lots of garlic there's some looks like pork  
belly like pork fat pork ear i think like 
this is pork ear probably it's a bit like  
gelatinous and how much is this 150 and the 
rice the fried rice was 20 pesos for a box
this is a rice cake wrapped in banana 
leaves so it's sweet but it's rice so  
it's more breakfast or you 
just feel like having a snack  
you can try it thank you what is this called again 
what is it uh it's called suman suman yeah wow
thank you so much we'll try to 
come again next time when it's open  
be here early you'll enjoy it more you 
can see more wow thank you she's so nice
oh and there's like five pieces 
should we open them and try it
that looks good
it almost tastes like khao lam you know the 
thai the thai sticky rice yeah bamboo sticky  
rice with coconut milk it's perfect sweetness 
i can see what she means by it's not it's like  
you don't really eat it with a meal 
because it's heavy and it's not  
as sweet so you can't call it a dessert yeah 
it's not really a dessert it really is a snack
oh it's so sticky it's very nice very nice  
now that we have some food in our 
bellies we are going to find some coffee  
there is a really nice place just around 
the corner here around three minutes away  
i think you'll like it a lot me yeah okay
is that where we're going what do you see we're 
going to timmy's do you want to go to timmy's  
because that's actually not 
where i was going to go oh no
okay bye timmy's next time but now we know 
where the timmy's is this looks really nice
i have a table for you perfect
thank you
oh so refreshing so good  
good choice what's on the side of the cup that's 
a design for your cappuccino cup wow thank you
delicious exactly what we needed it is such a 
hot day here so the place we're at is called  
the antipodean coffee roasters and it seems to 
be a really popular brunch place for locals here  
in manila so the only area we've seen so far is 
makati and it seems like a very developed place  
it almost feels like Canada like easily could 
be like downtown Calgary or downtown Vancouver  
i think as we head out to the other areas 
in manila it will start to look a little  
different real quick we have been building our 
new website using Squarespace and we have made

it's four o'clock now i think we should end our  
day at Mall of Asia which is the the seaside uh 
promenade but we need to get there first i think  
we should just call Grab we learned our lesson 
i think it's the safest way to call Grab yeah  
one thing about gGab here though it takes 
a long time for a driver to accept your  
request yeah how come there's like 
not many cars around yeah oh wait  
see no one's picking us up yeah let's 
try again we got a driver neil dennis
hello yes yes we are
i wonder if this happens every weekend 
it's just the whole promenade here is  
full of people there's lots of restaurants 
there's also some like food stalls like food carts  
i think it's a popular spot for local people to 
come and watch the sunset too you can see like  
hundreds and thousands of people sitting along 
the side of the ocean wow even look up there  
where people are crossing from the mall over here 
to the promenade that looks packed that's insane
yeah i think you just pay for whatever rides 
you want to do you want to do one of those i  
don't think i'm dressed for the occasion it 
feels like filipinos really like to gather  
like you can see families together with kids 
with elderly friends sitting together and they  
seem to be having a very good time so along this 
promenade we see a lot of food stands and they  
are actually hot dog stands and pizza stands 
and bubble tea shops not exactly what i thought  
it would be like it's very westernized street 
food it's like a carnival yeah yeah it's like  
carnival food this is the lineup for 
the ferris wheel oh my goodness no
no let's just sit along the bay in 
here and then just enjoy the view  
finding a spot may be more difficult 
than we imagined i see an opening  
i think this is a good spot

philippines by having the ultimate filipino  
dining experience we're having Jollibee so we've 
ordered jolly spaghetti chicken joy one spicy  
and one original and it comes with rice let's 
eat i'm super hungry so this jolly spaghetti  
so it's just like spaghetti and tomato sauce 
that's it and cheese on top there's no meat  
there might be meat in the sauce i'm not 
sure but i did see a family order 10 of these  
just now for pick up so it must be really good
this is really delicious really 
like for real it has a really  
bold tomato paste taste and that 
cheese is like nice and salty
quite good
it's our first time trying Jollibee very good
it's delicious i gotta say it's 
better than KFC really buki  
pie is young coconut pie i think  
it's like mini egg roll yeah
get out that is delicious
there's like big pieces of coconut meat in there
i don't know is it because we
