Morissette and Daryl Ong in the same video?! 
Apparently this happened about four years ago  
and I had never seen it because I'm relatively 
new to Daryl's work more said I'm more familiar  
with but together this is like exactly what 
I needed today I am so excited to check this  
out welcome to the channel where we learn 
from some of our favorite singers together  
my name is Liza Quin special shout out to you 
guys for hanging out with me helping me build  
this community enjoying music with me and I'm 
definitely learning a lot about music from so  
many different cultures I am learning a little bit 
of different languages I'm learning a little bit  
of Portuguese which is one of many on my list 
that I'm going to learn thanks to the sponsor  
today's video Babble so if you have not checked 
this out yet it's pretty incredible there's a  
desktop version there's the app I already started 
one of my first lessons and it gives me options  
for listening speaking flashcards writing and 
I can go over everything I just learned and  
it's totally customizable so they'll ask you 
do you like to learn by yourself do you like  
to learn with other people and I work better 
when I'm just kind of alone with the app and I  
just do it here and there and I have it scheduled 
to 15 minutes a day but you can choose how much  
time you want based on your goals so if you want 
to try it out too they've been nice enough to give  
me an exclusive link so that you can get 60 off 
it's a huge deal you're gonna find this link in  
the description below make sure you use that one 
to get that discount without further Ado let's  
go ahead and check out this beautiful duet with 
a couple of my favorite singers foreign [Music]
but I'm still breathing I'm hopeless now
I Climb Every Mountain and swim are ocean 
just to be with you it's what I'm broken  
oh cause I need you to see that you are the 
reason [Music] he's just such a star the way  
he commits to his interpretation and look on his 
face and he's just so involved in the story he's  
telling and it's just really captivating I 
love that about him the Simplicity of the  
start of this it's a beautiful choice for vocal 
production nothing is overdone he's basically  
just telling you the story beautifully 
simple and effective There Goes My Head  
[Music]
everywhere
[Music]  
just to be with you [Music] to see to see that 
you are the reason [Music] how effortless was  
that there is a Sweetness in this approach 
and that's allowing that vocal color to just  
feel so free that vibrato to just it's 
like butter this little climb up do you  
notice how there's no squeeze no attack 
no push beautifully in control [Music]
I need you to hold me tonight
[Music]
their stops and starts so beautiful their blend is 
so beautiful but if you'll notice the interweaving  
ad-libs it doesn't feel like there's too much 
going on because they're very thoughtfully curated  
so you don't feel like there's just like a bunch 
of people singing at you and that's when a really  
smart vocal Arrangement that's how effective 
it can be and that's what can make you feel
yes modulation [Music]
with you
[Music]
are the reasons
they both exhibit so much control and it's 
not just the control and Agility that they  
exhibit in their in their vocal runs that 
they're both so good at so to hear them on  
them together so clean like that is really 
just I love that there's so much control  
and when they're both going for the power 
notes there's like a reserve right this  
control and like I'm gonna hold it back just 
enough so even when they're both kind of in  
their upper register and they're showing 
off it is just the amount of lift that it  
needs I just want to take a quick second to 
point out both of them on top here [Music]
beautifully executed
so they're on that Harmony together it could 
have been a lot of attack up there but they're  
both in that area where they're preserving 
the blend so it's really important to just  
listen to each other bring out the best in 
each other like they're doing it's just a  
great skill to make you more versatile 
as an artist if you have more specific  
questions about things like that you can visit 
my patreon or you can shoot me an email those  
details are in the description below I 
look forward to seeing you next time bye
