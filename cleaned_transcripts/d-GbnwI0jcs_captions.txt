Filipinas pride in filipino appearance
Not sure if I've written something as specific
as this before.
Maybe it's something obvious to Down
Under Visa BLOG readers, but I feel like writing
about it.
Because if it wasn't for the charm and beauty
of
Filipina ladies, none of us would have any
specific to talk about, would we?
Beauty is definitely in the eye of the beholder,
of course.
I always liked petite women.
Always preferred
brunettes to blondes.
And I have early memories of being a 6 or
7 year old and finding a little girl at
school of Asian background to be particularly
pretty.
So yes, it made it particularly logical that
one day I
stopped dating Aussie women and turned my
attention to the Philippines.
Odd that I didn't do so earlier,
really.
I've lived full time in the Philippines for
the last 7 years, and to me it's far more
normal to see
Filipinas than it is to see Caucasians.
And I'm not complaining in any way.
And whist beauty is in the eye of the beholder,
the number one factor in why I think we decent
Aussie
gentlemen find ourselves attracted to Filipina
ladies is their charm.
Their sweetness.
Their gentleness.
Their kindness.
Their generosity and compassion.
Their easy-going nature.
Their old-fashioned and
stable attitudes toward marriage, families
and children.
And that propensity to smile just-because!
To
me?
Those are definitely the factors that push
our lovely Filipina wives and sweethearts
well and truly
over the line, and make them completely irresistible.
I can remember talking to Australian friends
after my first two relationships with Filipinas
fell down, and
discussing how I would try again.
Aussie woman looks at me and asks me why I
hadn't "learned my
lesson yet?"
Why on earth would I try again?
Why don't I just look for a local lady?
I asked her a straight question, and to her
credit she answered honestly.
I said "OK, YOU tell me if you
know of any local woman whom you could introduce
me to who would be prepared to get to know
me
with a view to marriage-for-life and would
make a great wife and mother to my two sons?"
She knew a
lot of people, yet after thinking for a bit
she shook her head.
Plenty of lovely ladies around in Australia,
but most of them are married and will stay
married.
Of the ones that are left, it's not so easy
to find
someone who has the family values, traditional
view on marriage and easy-going kind caring
nature to
match what the average family-oriented Aussie
man is looking for.
Yet in the Philippines?
It's not so unusual.
Yes, I recently had a bit of a rip into the
effect of modern
western-style values on the younger Filipino
population, and I stand by this.
But it's still not so hard to
find a sweet, kind and caring lady here who
can make you very happy.
I tend to think in a positive tone
that many of the "millennials" will soon tire
of the experimentation into western style
morality when
they meet a decent man who wants to marry
them.
I couldn't write this without praising my
own wonderful wife Mila.
Couldn't possibly hope for anybody
to take better care of me than her.
Most selfless and generous person I've ever
known, and like that line
in the movie "She made me want to be a better
person".
Fact!
I know I'm kinder and more generous
than I was before I met her, simply by being
with her every day.
And because she's very obviously taken
already, I will tell you that she's not the
only kind-hearted and generous woman here
in the Philippines.
Empathy for others, and a willingness to share
what they have and to give of themselves,
this is normal
here 
in the Philippines.
Kindness is shown to friends, family, total
strangers and very much to husbands!
My challenge is to try 
to keep up with how much she does for me.
I try, but I haven't a hope because I
don't believe I have the same capacity for
kindness.
Although simple gestures, kind words, sharing
time
and a few romantic gestures seem to go a long
way.
And smiles?
My goodness, how wonderful it is to be greeted
by ladies who smile for absolutely no
reason at all?
To have a house full of laughter.
Where ladies don't spend too much time dwelling
on
those real or imaginary things that could
get them down, because there's always something
better to
think about and plenty of reasons to be grateful
for a good life.
Hard to frown when she's too busy
counting her blessings!
And being greeted by a smiling face from someone
who's genuinely happy just
because you're there?
That's something pretty special.
So yes, I must admit my beauty-detector finds
these ladies utterly gorgeous physically.
Big brown eyes
like chocolates.
Shiny black hair.
Cute little noses.
Coffee-coloured skin.
Utterly delicious!
But whilst
that's very pleasant, it's the beautiful hearts
that these ladies possess that is their true
essence.
It's that
goodness that the love and the smiles stem
from.
I'm happy, and I'm not going anywhere!
