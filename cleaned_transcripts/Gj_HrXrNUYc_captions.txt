we are Andrew and Leanne and in 2021 we packed 
our bags quit our jobs and sold our car to buy  
a one-way ticket to travel the world in the 
last episode we left Manila and made our way  
to Cebu [Music] good morning guys so this 
morning we have rented a scooter and we are  
on our way to pangsama in Mobile to try and see 
the infamous sardine run good morning guys I'm  
back on the bikes and it's the first time I've 
ever ridden with Leanne on the back give it a go
so we have just arrived we have made it to Chile 
bar which is where we are actually meeting a  
long-term friend of the channel and then we've 
come here to do something super special today  
about 40 or 50 feet in that direction there is 
like a Shelf at the edge of a coral reef and  
at the very edge of that is where like a huge 
baseball of sardines will come it's apparently  
one of the best places in the world to see 
something like this and we've never swam in  
amongst the bait ball of fish so we're gonna 
head out and try and see that and here he is
living the dream
at last so yeah we rented a couple 
of snorkels and some fins for 150  
pesos each and then jumped in the 
water and swam out to the ledge
we didn't get lucky enough to see a big sardine 
run but we did manage to catch a couple of turtles
and two guys catching an octopus with a spear
I also managed to record half of it in 
time lapse so it all went by super quick
after swimming we spent a couple of hours in 
Chile bar before heading back to our hotel
[Music]  
we're now about to head back out again 
to meet with Chile for the second time  
and we're gonna try some very very local 
Filipino foods we'll show you in a second
so we've come to the pier uh right next to where 
we're staying in Mobile town to try one of the  
Philippines most famous Foods it's called ballot 
we've uh we've never ever tried it before we're  
both a little bit nervous yeah very nervous so 
on his first ever appearance on the channel uh  
we're putting them through a bit of a baptism of 
fire and he's going to try the infamous uh ballot
so for those who aren't aware Ballard is a 
fertilized duck egg you get like different  
degrees of like developness development stages 
of life stages different stages of development  
no idea how far through these ones are they're 
actually really warm wow they're a lot they are  
so hard and as far as I'm aware from what I've 
seen you crack open the top oh I think she's  
drawn a line she's drawing a little line on and 
I'm presuming the line is um where we open the egg  
oh no can you drink the 
juice yeah let's have a lot
got a drink your juice fellas
ready think it cheers
okay so soup's not too bad the thought 
of it is much worse like the second I  
touch my lips my stomach to turn a 
little bit but that's just in here  
so I have now opened mine and um I'm starting 
to think have I made the right decision
what's the best way to eat yum
I'm going with the little girl in Yum 
Yum Yum yep I'm gonna get a bit of salt
oh Andy's getting in there before 
me no same time three two one go
I've got the white cap [Music]
you know what that just tasted like an egg [Music]
nice looking egg
apparently that's what you don't 
eat this is like rock solid  
that metal spot out guys it's really really hard
and apparently you're supposed to so 
you don't you don't let me eat that bit  
and apparently you're supposed to 
squeeze this into your mouth as well
oh it's just like a spicy vinegar honestly 
not as bad as I thought it would be  
um the texture the texture is different 
it's kind of when you first eat it you  
get part of like a normal egg yolk but then 
there's also part of the kind of like goo  
um and it just kind of melts in your mouth so you 
kind of got like a video cross between like like  
chunks of egg yolk um almost like a duck flavored 
soup it's very tastes very eggy um and the texture  
like kind of said it's very yeah almost gooey and 
I think if you look at it too long it can put you  
off so it's best just to get it down but um yeah 
I'm going in a night generous I'm going in at a  
night I don't mind that I don't mind it wasn't my 
favorite thing I'd give it maybe six out of ten  
um that's not too bad considering I did 
an eight yeah no well done guys well done
so those eggs were apparently 17 
days old so they're like a nice  
Middle Ground they weren't too young 
they weren't too old yeah as we said  
not too bad would we eat again possibly 
if Posh games shove uh there's a bit of  
a meat market here so we're kind of gonna 
look around this now and see what there is
[Music]  
so now that we've had a little look around the 
Meat and Fish Market we kind of just wandering  
around looking for somewhere to eat and this 
caught the corner of my eye it's like this  
beautiful area all lit up with pretty lights and 
there's like a garden with really nice grass and  
the beach is right there we actually haven't gone 
to this part of town just yet but it's really nice
[Music]  
good morning it's currently the 
next day here in Mobile mobile  
um it's a rainy day unfortunately the rain has 
been chasing us and yesterday was beautiful and  
we managed to do a bit of a sardine run but today 
it's raining again but it's still fairly warm  
um on the agenda today we have several 
waterfalls it is a Saturday and it's  
after 10 so we're already going to be kind 
of busy but hopefully the rain puts people  
off it's about an hour's drive from 
here and I'm actually really excited
so we've made it to binalayan Hidden waterfalls 
it took us much longer than Google Maps said it  
would to get here sorry if the audio is horrendous 
we haven't got the microphone on the GoPro at the  
moment uh because it is absolutely chopping it 
down with rain we are both drenched already so  
we don't mind we have a guide with us um 
we're about to go to the waterfalls and  
apparently there's a couple of areas where we 
can jump from a ledge into the water I've never  
done this before but I'm more than willing to 
give it a go yeah Leanne might pass on that
so that was absolutely insane absolutely awesome 
completely terrifying I've never like waterfall  
jumped in my life um and I did bottle over one 
of the jumps but chili is a nice move mad man  
57 and he just has no fear whatsoever we're 
gonna head back towards the bike now and try  
and find somewhere to eat because we're all 
starving I could do another cup of coffee  
but what a day the two guides we had were 
absolutely awesome guys compulsory in this  
place guide to voluntary but you can 
choose to pay them we definitely will
okay so our time in Mobile has come to 
an end unfortunately sorry we didn't  
film much over the past few days it has 
absolutely chucked it down here and it's  
just not been possible to get the camera out 
we actually have a six hour bus back to Cebu  
Ferry and a taxi to get to our next 
destination so we're on our way
so we're finally off that bus Which took how 
many hours in there about four about four  
hours this time which was considerably quicker 
than it was on the way there I don't think the  
air con was working so it was boiling hot you 
get ragged around everywhere but it's you know  
it's good fun we're finally back in Cebu now 
and we have a ferry to catch but that's not  
for another for like five hours so my tips 
for the bus from Cebu to mobile would be  
sit on one with aircon definitely don't 
eat anything before you get on because  
it's a twisty bumpy ride you can take 
water because they only stop once and  
that's about an hour in and then they don't 
stop again but yeah at least we're here now
Okay so we've actually come to the ferry 
terminal about four and a half hours early  
we're gonna see if we can jump an area Ferry 
we did book the 20 plus three Ferry there's  
a few ferries from the same company going 
out every day so we're gonna see if they'll  
let us jump in earlier ferry so we'd 
get up to pangla a little bit earlier
[Music]
yeah okay we have just made it to tagpilaran 
uh I think we have a small taxi ride now  
from here to our hotel in Panglao so 
that's what we're gonna try and do next
so we finally arrived at our sea Garden View 
sweet sweet we are exhausted it took quite a  
few hours we actually ended up getting a 
earlier Ferry obviously it took us a bus  
a fairy a taxi and a tricycle and a tricycle 
to get here but so far we're loving it  
um that's pretty much it to be honest with this 
video yeah we're gonna end this one here we'll  
show you around the apartments in the next video 
but yeah sorry this one's been a bit disjointed  
as we said already it's been really really rainy 
so we couldn't film anything in Mobile the weather  
is glorious today so we're hoping that this 
carries on for the next few days um but yeah  
we'll see you in the next video where we'll 
start to explore panglao see you then [Music]
