hello snack pack welcome back to travel snacks 
in today's episode i try filipino bakery treats  
for the first time with my friend rachel this 
is part two of a one two punch kind of video  
set with my friend rachel who is healing from 
triple negative breast cancer so she is on a  
fully plant-based organic cutting pretty 
much everything out of her diet called the  
gerson therapy she knows how much of a sweet 
tooth i have and she wanted to treat me it's  
something i've never experienced so she took me 
to the baker sun bakery in jacksonville florida  
usa it's summertime and it's 105 million degrees 
in the van so the air conditioner is on so sorry  
about the sound there's so many great treats 
packed into this episode so let's jump right in  
okay so why are we here okay so we are 
here at the baker's sun because this is  
a very special filipino bakery and they have all 
kinds of like squishy doughy yummy goodness like  
they give you a cart and everything is 
sold in bulk because that's how good it is  
you want to take it home so let's try something 
are you living by carrots if you're me on this i'm  
totally going to live through her but i am going 
to be doing the smell test and the squeeze test to  
let you know what i think it tastes like and then 
you tell me if i'm right oh yeah that's a good one  
all right so we're gonna explore jean is the 
owner of the baker's son he is from the valerio  
family and they have over 30 bakeries all over 
the west coast his grandfather had a bakery and  
his dad worked in that bakery and then in 2002 he 
opened his own bake shop in union city california  
on the website it says we bake fresh daily in 
store we use quality ingredients that are sourced  
locally whenever available we keep our prices low 
and we'll always do due diligence to keep it so  
jacksonville florida is our first store and we 
plan to branch out to other parts of florida the  
east coast the midwest and eventually circling 
back to the west coast the baker's son's tagline  
is make good bread and they will come some of the 
things featured in their store are bagged breads  
like hot pandesal brioche bread logs pretzel 
buns and even spanish breads they also have  
hopia i don't know if i'm saying that right 
macapuno buns empanadas syopayo i don't know  
how to say these things and then they also have 
cassava bites palata biko puto fiesta ensamada

ones you want to ask me well the first thing we're

like a real youtuber okay so when we saw this in 
the store i was like oh that looks like cheddar  
cheese i thought it was like frosting wisps oh 
and then you're like no it is cheddar cheese i  
think it is and then we saw it is and so i was 
like ew put that back and she's like no we're  
gonna get that okay now i'm gonna smell it and 
i'm gonna give it a squeeze and tell you what i  
think it's gonna taste and feel like okay okay you 
gotta stay in the camera though yeah oh whoopsie  
hmm interesting what do you think i think it's 
gonna taste sickeningly sweet with like a hint  
of cheddar and i think it's gonna be odd it might 
be one of those like it's oddly delicious slash  
oddly not so delicious okay feels like it's gonna 
be grainy and gritty we're gonna give it a try  
it's like i feel like this is like a taco like you 
know you put cheese on a taco it's weird oh it's  
also got like cream cheese or some kind of the 
frosting that's the frosting there's also that's  
what i'm saying i think the frosting is gonna 
paper grainy no no oh right into it girl come in  
it's like real cheddar cheese like real like 
shredded cheese go well she took a big bite  
too i would have done like a baby like let me 
just you don't really taste the cheddar cheese  
really you're [ __ ] a napkin you probably 
do i don't have one to offer you though  
oh look how comfortable you are she's very 
prepared snack mobile this is actually really  
good really yeah is it not sick and sickeningly 
no it's actually really good it's like it's like  
a moist cake and not like dried tastes like 
a cheese danish kind of okay oh well you've  
already tried this i tried this but let me let me 
uh let me try it for the camera for the camera so  
this is a cheese roll she had work to do and so 
then she's like we're gonna do this filming later  
and i was like well bring me something sweet in 
my van for just you know and so she brings me this  
and i was like okay cheese rolls whatever 
but i didn't tell you this was the one to try  
yes you did was that right you were right because 
i took a bite and then i was because i told i just  
want like a little just a little something bro you 
see i i couldn't stop it's so good let me show you  
it's cheese danish isn't it i mean it is powdered 
sugar it's like doughy like almost like it's not  
gum but it's like almost like squishy wet squishy 
it's got like cream cheese frosting it's like  
powdery sugar gravy you hear that that was a real 
good one it's delicious i'm probably gonna go back  
to that bakery and get more of these you know what 
that would be good with a hot cup of coffee oh  
right this just looks like it goes with it really 
does delicious it's delicious that one's my  
favorite so far and i actually do like the cheddar 
cheese one this next one is called a pandesal  
it is one of their go-to bread rolls is it like a 
dinner roll yeah like a dinner roll but it's sweet  
i bet that with a spread of 
butter oh yeah and some coffee yup
that would be perfect okay i like 
this oh if you had this for like  
thanksgiving with mashed potatoes
you know what does my zoom slightly less sweet 
hawaiian roll i'm digging these filipino sweets  
i'll tell you okay this one is the spanish 
bread they say that this one is more like  
a bread and butter roll yeah didn't she say 
that this one had honey and something in it  
i don't know does she i don't know but we're 
gonna try something with butter chocolate  
all these have like this kind of damp feel 
to it which i like i love that it's very  
gluttonous is there something in there no you 
sure maybe she met like a second night okay
no nothing but maybe she meant like they make it 
false afterwards maybe it's honey and butter in  
the mix you know what i would do with this i would 
slice it and throw in some ham and cheese and then  
put it on a panini press and get like that crispy 
in puerto rico you do that with a hot dog bun and  
you do ham and cheese mayonnaise and like shredded 
lettuce you put in the the press and we call it
that sounds delicious i feel like we need 
to have a travel snacks in puerto rico  
oh okay this is the last one this is 
the cheese balls and i gotta tell you  
these balls smell delicious i wouldn't mind 
putting my face in these balls you never made  
balls sound so good there's some big balls 
these balls aren't as wet as the other buns  
they got like a crust on them too yeah 
and they're not wrinkly so there's a plus  
okay go i gotta stop laughing  
okay does it taste cheesy it's just like 
parmesan parmesan cheese like you could  
actually have this with spaghetti sweet and 
parmesan all of their stuff is sweet by the way  
they know what i like then yeah even the empanadas 
are sweet even though the meat feels oh really  
yeah they're sweet my husband's like i don't 
like it what yeah he doesn't like like sweet meat  
i like sweet meat just wait a little 
better well those are all our snacks my  
first experience with filipino bakery 
is high marks how many snack bags  
see i don't know it was 45 what do you think 
on price okay so it was 45 for all this that  
you see plus i think that that's a good that's 
a you got like you get a lot because i could see  
eating any of these things as like my morning 
breakfast yeah with the coffee yeah and that's  
all i would need in the morning yeah yeah i would 
give it a four for the pricing okay the service  
i'll give it a four they are lovely when you ask 
them stuff but because they're always so busy  
they can't really give you that like let me 
walk you personally i never had filipino food
it's delicious you need lumpia chicken adobo 
fancy never had it that might be on my list  
like on my travels flavor for me i'm gonna 
pick the flavor i'm gonna go with a solid four  
i'm also gonna go with the four even though i've 
never tasted a single one based on your reaction  
and the reaction from my family of all those 
things i do like them all and i will eat all  
those things the number one thing was that cheese 
roll which is the thing you told me to try first  
that thing is legit like that's dangerous it's 
so good i have a knife for the good stuff i see i
