Yo whats up everybody it's your boy JRE
This is Z-I-Co (Zico) - "She's a baby"
Now, actually KML really likes this song and just really
likes Zico in general and KML is doing well by the way
for those who remember who KML is from "JREKML"
she kinda stopped because she wanted to focus on other things
she recommended it for me to check this out
I dont know why I havent checked this out yet
but you know there's a lot of things I haven't checked out yet
which is... shame on me
Let's get it. Let's go. Let's begin
Hi JRE I'm Tamera from Croatia

There's Converses
I saw like- she showed me pictures of Zico
and he has like- he looks- it's a different type of side to Zico right?
than we're usually normally to...used to*
She's a baby
Who is that girl?

but I don't know if I'm mistaking her with someone else
I feel like I should've had subtitles up

What an interesting MV
I feel like I need to watch it again
just to get what just happened
I mean, I kind of have an idea but I'm not sure at all
She's a baby
Interesting, yooo. Z-I-Co man
This-what can
What can't Z-I-Co do?
He can sing, he can dance, he can RAP
like RAAAP. Like RAAAAAAAP!
he can look like a badass, he can look like you know
the boy that you can bring to your mom
He has so many different things he can do
it's so interesting to watch his career grow and grow
There's this other one that I do like:
that slower version he put out where he's in a supermarket
and it goes "duhnahnuhnuhnuuhnuh"
I probably butchered it
that's one of my favorites
and I love what Block B had been doing too
Toy is still my... I still jam to Toy
it's so good
it's just nice to see what Zico be doing
