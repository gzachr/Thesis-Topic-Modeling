Forget about the
electrolytes and ibuprofen:
When you're hungover, we
all know the best cure
is a delicious and greasy meal --
preferably with melted cheese.
Today, we're headed to Flip
Sigi in the West Village,
where they serve a
unique blend of Filipino
and Mexican food, resulting
in some of the best
hangover cures in all of New York City.
The first dish you're gonna wanna try
when you come to Flip
Sigi, is the Plan B-Rito.
It's their take on a
California breakfast burrito,
but with a Filipino twist.
It's guaranteed to get you
back on your feet in no time.
They start by grilling up
the three meats that go inside:
bacon, ham, and longanisa,
which is a popular sweet barbecue sausage
from the Philippines.
Next, they fry up an egg and
cover it with shredded cheese.
They throw it all into a
grilled, extra-large tortilla,
and top it with hash
browns, avocado, and salsa.
It's all wrapped up, sliced in half,
and ready to be consumed.
If you're hungover, the Plan B-Rito
is exactly what the doctor ordered.
It's this ultimate,
booze-absorbing, grease trap.
My favorite part is, without
a doubt, the longanisa.
It's this perfect addition
of Filipino flair,
that blends so well together
with the other breakfast meats.
Flip Sigi is also working longanisa
into their mouth-watering DP burger.
They blend ground longanisa
with grade A beef
to make the perfect patty.
Then they give it a
nice char on the grill,
and top it with a slice
of American cheese.
Next, they take the bottom
bun and cover it with a base
of special sauce and slices of avocado.
After, they pile on a stack
of fresh-made French fries,
and a handful of house-made kimchi.
Last but not least, they
finish off the burger
with a sunny-side-up egg.
Now, much like the Plan B-Rito,
the DP burger is your
ideal hangover helper.
It's just got the perfect amount of grease
to get you going again throughout the day.
On top of that, it's just a great burger.
The longanisa in the patty
and the kimchi coleslaw
really elevate the whole thing,
and add this nice Filipino
touch to the entire burger.
Flip Sigi is known
for changing up their menu
weekly, announcing new
specials on their Instagram.
The special they were offering up today,
was the 8-inch flip roll.
A massive, deep-fried sushi burrito.
They start by
spreading out coconut rice
in a tortilla.
Then they add slices of
avocado and sliced jalape√±os.
Next comes a handful of fried
wontons for an extra crunch
and a big spoonful of spicy tuna.
They roll up the burrito, then
cover it in tempura batter
and fry it up.
The burrito is then sliced and served
with a side of sweet teriyaki sauce.
At first, I was pretty
skeptical about the whole thing.
I mean, normally a sushi
burrito isn't wrapped
in a flour tortilla; it's more sushi-like.
But the fried tempura adds
this great crunch to every bite
and really helped the
burrito keep its form.
It's easily one of the best
sushi burritos I've ever had.
And it may not be really Filipino at all,
but I think Flip Sigi should
put it on its menu every day.
A little fun fact about longanisa:
Much like the wines of Italy,
or the cheeses of France,
every region of the Philippines
makes its own version of the sausage.
Where they even are stuffing
it with tuna in some areas.
The more you know.
