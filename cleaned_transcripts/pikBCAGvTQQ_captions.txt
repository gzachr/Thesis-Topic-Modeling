we just arrived in paradise
now we're talking
we are officially in el nido palawan 
i'm so excited to be here it's our  
actually our first full day of being here 
devon's already rocking some el nido merch  
bought an el nido shirt yesterday our plan for 
today is to just explore the small town see  
what the beaches are like and see what el nido is 
like right now when there are not as many tourists  
now we're taking a walk through the town and 
it seems to be pretty chilled already pretty  
laid back we are literally a hop in a skip away 
from the beach el nido is part of the palawan  
island and to get here we had to take an hour 
flight from manila directly to porto princesa
then you have to take a five to six hour van trip 
all the way up to el nido which was very long  
but it is so worth it now 
that we are here we've arrived
i already seem to be getting super chilled laid 
back vibes that's exactly what i came here for  
the most important things to see in el nido are 
the beautiful beaches so let's go check one out  
when you walk down these 
small alleys here in el nido  
they are just these side cars everywhere 
they are so trendy how they've converted  
a small motorbike into this luxury little vehicle 
there's definitely a chilled relaxed atmosphere
everyone's very laid back  
oh my god i think we just arrived in paradise wow  
look at these cliff faces 
they're absolutely amazing
el nido is so small but you 
literally just walk through this  
road and the tar stops and it just turns 
into sand and then you just end up with this
el nido i'm liking you already this is what 
we came for and so many of you recommended  
we have to go to palawan and it's a reason 
we listened it's the reason why we are here  
and you were right it was worth it it 
was worth the six hour bumpy van ride  
this is a little bit of a different 
vibe to where we just came from people
oh my god this is so relaxed tranquil wow 
i can see why so many people come here this  
is paradise for [ __ ] and we're not the 
only ones here on this beach right now  
it is completely quiet nobody is on this beach you 
can see behind me even this side there's nobody
look at where you are right now
wow we gotta go see the boats oh my 
gosh he loves boats so much the boat so  
we're gonna go and check that out in el 
nido obviously the main attraction is the  
boat tours the island the lagoon 
and that's why we just got stuck  
in the mud that's why we came here so in 
the next few videos we will be doing some  
of the island tours seeing those lagoons so 
make sure you subscribe so you can see those
everywhere you look you're just 
surrounded by crystal clear water  
beautiful cliffs they're just everywhere one 
of the reasons we came to the philippines  
especially for me is these boats i've just 
researched that they are called banker or bunker  
you'll have to help me with the pronunciation 
they look like dragonflies or grasshoppers  
and it's what we're going to be using 
when we go on all these island tours
everything is so laid back and tranquil 
it really forces you to just relax
that looks so cute getting into the island 
live i need to be i need an island right
just shopping
i think i need a coffee and 
this looks like a good spot
we just ordered the biggest coffee in the 
world and it was just 120 pesos wow thank you
lots of people have said that if you spend 
a full day in el nido you have to go and see  
los cabanas beach and that's exactly what we're 
gonna do right now we're going to take one of  
these little tricycles or one of these pedicabs 
and we're going to las cabanas beach first we  
need to find one but i don't think that'll be too 
difficult they're everywhere maybe we just saw one
hop in oh is there space for me yes
thank you thank you
it's our first time taking one of these pedicabs
it's about 10 minutes south of 
el nido city to las capanes beach  
everybody has been recommending it so here we go
have a good day thank you see you next time
wow we made
this pristine beach is so picturesque i can't 
even describe to you what it feels like to be  
in paradise that's how i would 
explain it are you a tour guide
bye-bye now we're talking this 
beach is so lovely it's so pristine
well we spent some time on the beach we've come 
back to el nido but i need to get a haircut so  
we're hopefully going to find somewhere 
where i can do that i think you're about  
to have the cheapest haircut ever probably and 
i'm very sunburned it is it's hot in el nido
people are very friendly so devin's 
getting his first haircut hello
so cute i'm just soaking up all the entertainment
i think he is getting the cheapest 
haircut ever for 150 pesos what a deal
so far we have been loving our time here 
in el nido it's just been full of surprises  
it's been beautiful but i think 
we have just scratched the surface  
i feel like there is so much more 
to see i'm going through the cables
