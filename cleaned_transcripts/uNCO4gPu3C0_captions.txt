Cafe Laguna. We'll to discover u some filipino
specialties. So, we continue in this Philippines.
Let's go to Cebu !
Here we are at Cafe Laguna in Cebu
at the Ayala Center.
We were really hungry !!!
We will eat and test a bunch of typical Filipino dishes.
To drink, we had a little iced tea.
It's coconut juice.
with coconut fruit !
So here they are shells with cheese gratin on it.
We're going to taste that. I've never eaten it before.
And here we have kinilaw. So that's the Filipino specialty.
It is raw fish, marinated in vinegar and coconut milk
with peppers, ginger, onions, ...
Then there is also fried pork, which they call crispy patta.
There is also a soup that Noel has ordered.
A beef soup
with vegetables, corn, ...
That's it ... We'll taste all that!
We will now taste the shell with cheese
and apparently ... garlic.
It looks so so good!
Is it good ?
Yes.It's delicious
We ate too much ...

It was the Cafe Laguna. We hope

We will end up in a few days with
a last video shot this time
in Manila and there we will offer you simply to discover the big fish
Market : Dampa. This is a special market
since you will be able to both buy fish but also eat it directly in a
restaurant. You will see this in a few days.
