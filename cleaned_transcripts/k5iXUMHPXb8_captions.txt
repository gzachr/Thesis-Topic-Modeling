hello everyone and we are back at my place in 
RAS AL KHAIMAH in my home, we're out of the hotel fancy  
experience and for today's video 
i am making my boyfriend a lumpiang shanghai
today's video is balkan man tries lumpiang shanghai 
and we need only carrots and some onions and 
probably some salt and pepper and then we put  
it on a wrap and i forgot to buy eggs but i would 
buy um eggs just to help everything stick together  
but you'll see it later what will i do for now 
just keep on watching and subscribe to my channel  
you know just just because there should be a 
lot of videos to be coming up on this channel  
subscribe to be updated and like and comment um 
if ever you want to say something that's it and we  
were busy shopping we bought some new pans some 
groceries and some tender juicy hotdogs no it's  
some just a different kind of hot dog but cheese 
dog because he's craving for tender juicy but we  
weren't able to buy a tender juicy hot dog if both 
if all of you are not aware what tender juicy is  
it's actually a very nice hot dog i always forget 
to wear um these because we don't usually need  
i mean in my in my household before we don't 
usually use uh apron my mom uses if i never do  
 
i'm talking about me can you open 
the pans for me so i can use now
so make sure when you chop 
the onions it's very thin  
because it's going to go on a i'm 
not good actually at cutting stuff
you can try the PIAYA now love 
a what ? you can try the PIAYA now love 
so we bought cdo's bibo cheese dog 
go down because they can't see you love  
literally i'm in a cartoon where they 
don't see your head i swear so we bought  
this because he's addicted with tender juicy 
and it's been a long time since he had one ow
the eggs has arrived but before that this is 
also one of the ingredients that you need for  
the lumpiang shanghai it's called the spring 
roll pastry usually in my country which is the  
philippines we buy it fresh lee made which is some 
guys using this big round whatever it is and then  
just tap it all but unfortunately i'm a different 
country so we'll have to rely on this um so still  
the flavor is going to be the same and if you 
guys are wondering i am using brazilian beef minced
um usually and most likely we prefer the pork 
minced but because i'm in a country i'm in a  
muslim country so that's why it's very hard to 
find one and if it if there is one place then  
it's a little bit far so yes i mix the carrots 
the onions and the beef together and i'm gonna put  
salt and pepper on it and mix it again so 
i need an assistant where's my assistant
love i know you're i know you're resting,
but can you please help me hold the gopro  
one quick tip while you're preparing to 
roll the wrapper and everything all together just  
make sure that you prepare also the oil because it 
needs to be crispy and frying oil so you need to  
hold this and make sure that you're seeing what 
i'm doing this is not necessarily but i like to  
put and one piece of egg on my beef carrots 
and this one because it will make it stickier  
so there's one egg there one egg is 
enough put salt pepper. grinded pepper  
any questions nope when you put 
in the pepper you have to say
BAAM ! 
 PIM PIM PIM PIM
i like a lot of pepper do 
you like a lot of pepper? i do  
i wanted to add either oyster sauce or 
soy sauce not necessarily but i think it  
adds a little bit of flavor on it okay what 
do you prefer oyster sauce or soy sauce  
damn it i don't want oyster sauce anymore i don't  
know it's the first time i'm trying anyway go with  
your gut instinct i'll go with soy sauce only  
a little bit because it's not necessarily oh
can you open it you have to remove the 
one in the middle nice okay now we're back  
so i i mean you can use your bare hands with 
this i just want to use plastic just you know  
for aesthetic so make sure you mix it and again 
the soy sauce or the oyster sauce is optional  
i like to do it that way so let's 
do it that way just a little bit
please don't judge me and if you have other secret 
ingredients that you do please comment down below
water and clean hands my hands are clean 
duh um my wrapper is so small oh my god
so how do you roll it like that
i love you. are you excited? i'm very hungry 
i mean excited. oh my god these are small
okay i think that's how you do it make sure 
it's hot i hope its hot. wait stand back
so when the lumpiang shanghai's are golden brown 
like this then you mean it's good to go but it's  
up to you if you feel more crispier up to you 
just put it on the side but so far it is crispy
oh and by the way if you want to see 
my boyfriend try his piaya watch on  
my other video and for the lumpiang shanghai i we 
bought sorry why can't i we bought um sweet chili  
sauce we mean i bought we bought no he bought 
it um sweet chili sauce or a banana ketchup  
um yeah banana ketchup or sweet anything we 
do but i always like this this one this one  
i don't know we'll see rice obviously he's 
gonna use spoon and fork this is banana ketchup  
this is sweet and sour have you 
tried the sweet and sour ketchup  
sauce yes this is the cdo bibo hot dog with cheese 
inside and this is it's not cheesy tender cheese  
shanghai i hate it when they there's like a burnt 
part of it but it's because of the roll give them  
your first reaction for your first ever lumpiang
shanghai baby are they really hot yeah they are
boiling oh
you can first try it with ketchup 
and the sweet and sweet and chili
