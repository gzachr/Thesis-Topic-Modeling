so you're a foreigner you're an expat think 
about moving here to the philippines let me  
share with you guys the five mistakes made by 
foreigners when they have decided to move here  
to the philippines before we get started don't 
forget to subscribe to this channel at the very  
same time as click the bell icon to be notified 
when we have new videos coming out the goal of  
this channel is to be able to help foreigners and 
expats who are either moving to the philippines  
or you're thinking about coming to the philippines 
to visit to be able to meet your future wife go on  
a date with the filipino you've been talking to 
or just to have fun now let's get started the  
first mistake first mistake that i have 
seen that people have also shared with  
me that foreigners have made to the philippines 
is they moved to the philippines and is already  
committed to a woman now listen if there is a 
definite love there then i'm not gonna kind of  
maybe dig in a little bit deeper 
there for you but here's the thing  
you might get what they call buyer's remorse 
you've been talking to this filipina you you know  
you you see that you know 
something may come of this okay and  
you decide that i'm going to move to the 
philippines now and i'm going to commit to this  
girl i promise you that once you move here you're 
going to see the other options that you have or  
that you potentially missed and you're gonna get 
buyer's remorse and you're gonna say oh my gosh  
why did i commit right away so here's the thing 
guys if you think that you are financially stable  
and you say okay i really do want to have a 
more minimalistic lifestyle rather than you know  
let's say you have two thousand dollars a month 
coming in 1500 a month coming in but that's not  
going to work well in the us it's not going to 
get you much but that's going to get you a lot  
in the philippines right then come down here 
and do that and do the minimalistic lifestyle  
and then make a decision to go meet some 
people right so if if there's no love there yet  
then don't commit to somebody right away and 
what i mean is this is that what i mean by  
commitment is when you move out here don't all of 
a sudden make this person a house person meaning  
don't all of a sudden have them 
move in because once they move in  
that is what we call a full commitment if 
there is somebody you're interested in and  
you see yourself maybe try you would want 
to have something or commit to that person  
live separate places for now enjoy the experiences 
of dating someone first because at the very same  
time as you might actually realize that this 
is maybe not the person you want to be with  
and that's gonna actually prevent you from meeting 
the next person because once that person lives  
with you you're gonna get comfortable but 
then eventually you're going to regret it  
so if there's not full love going on 
or it's just in the beginning stages  
and you want to move over here then do that but 
don't go on a full-fledged commitment having that  
person live with you right away okay get your 
place let her stay at her own place for now  
probably with her family still her her parents her 
sister maybe but not moving in with you right away  
that's one of the first mistakes made a lot of 
foreigners and you know there's some foreigners  
that come out here some expats and you know 
they're able to just ditch the person right away  
and say look this is not gonna work but there's 
also a lot of guys that end up marrying the woman  
end up having children by the woman and then 
all of a sudden they're like i should not have  
committed so that's good that could happen and 
so that's one of the mistakes made by foreigners  
here so don't go full commitment right away the 
next thing is starting a business look i know  
i understand you come out here you move 
over here and you tell yourself hmm i need  
to have supplemental income so i need to open up 
a business foreigners can't really have or own  
businesses here in the philippines you know not 
unless it's a it's like a multi-million type of uh  
business then there's ways to go around 
that depending on you know where you live  
and what type of incorporation you're going to 
be doing but if it's just the basic mom-and-pop  
type of businesses then technically 
you're not allowed to have that and more  
than likely you're going to need a filipino 
partner to be able to start a business now  
me here i do have businesses that i own but it's 
not in the philippines you know my businesses  
are related in the us you know i have a digital 
marketing agency and a consulting agency for sales  
and marketing so i can do like a laptop style 
business be here in the philippines but still  
all my clients are based in the us now i do have 
what they call virtual assistants that work for me  
that are you know that are gig what they 
call gig workers and they do work for me here  
some of them are in cebu some of them are in 
davao some of them are manila and so that's how  
that kind of works as well so you know you don't 
want to just also start a business here and what's  
funny here is the way filipinos do business 
here it's cut throat and also if somebody sees  
you doing good in your business they're gonna want 
to replicate the same thing that's why when you  
go to places like you know if you go to places 
like divisoria you know pretty much everybody's  
selling the same exact stuff in the same row if 
you go to if you go to like um like baklavan or  
cartimar for example like in cartomar everyone's 
selling shoes for some reason it's a shoe capital  
so just pretty much make sure that 
number one is you are financially stable  
in moving out here okay the next one is they want 
to purchase land as an investment or whatever but  
in the philippines you are not able to 
purchase a house and lot here because  
foreigners cannot own land here we can actually 
buy condominiums because in a in a condo facility  
you don't own the land you own the the uh the 
unit itself so you can do something like that  
but if you're gonna have to own land here you 
know it's pretty much gonna go into the name of  
your filipina that you end up with right so you 
know you have to think about that because what  
if you know what if the relationship doesn't turn 
out good you're crap out of luck with that right  
so you want to kind of stay away from 
that option now you know there's gonna be  
some girls that's gonna that you're with it's 
gonna say hey we gotta buy land this hey look  
if you decide to do it do you but you have to make 
sure that any business or financial decision that  
you make here in the philippines is you're not 
gonna be stuck with a loss and it's just a matter  
of being more smart about what you need to do 
the fourth mistake that we hear a lot that a lot  
of foreigners do is the miscalculation of their 
budget the thing though is you're going to see  
and you're going to hear people talk in you know 
in vlogs by expats in youtube or you're going to  
see some comments made by expats in facebook and 
other um social media places that they say you  
know all you need is 600 and you can actually 
live a decent life here in the philippines  
and yeah technically you can but you're going 
to be living a life just like a filipino  
right i mean just just imagine this right you can 
get a decent place for rent for a hundred dollars  
and what i'm saying is decent as in whatever 
right but do you really want to live that  
small i mean you're not going to be in a nice 
condo unit you're not going to be in in a nice  
area you're going to be amongst the 
same people that make the same range  
as that you know filipinos make between 
500 to 600 a month in average us dollars  
so if that's the amount that you can only afford 
in a monthly basis that's how you're going to live  
i mean just look at this right i mean you know 
i'm going to do another video of you know how what  
type of life you can live with a thousand with 
fifteen hundred or with two thousand dollars we're  
gonna make some videos of those because i honestly 
say that anything below a thousand dollars  
it's not gonna be the most comfortable life ever 
because just imagine if you got a place for let's  
say let's just say you got it for 200 that's you 
know a decent you know an average size condo well  
electricity here fluctuates you can be paying 
a hundred dollars one month and then pay 120  
another month in another month pay 150 and then 
that's if you you you need ac right how about food  
you're gonna be spending some around 200 a month 
as well just right there alone 200 plus 100 plus  
200 that's already spent 500 how about you know 
basic things that you want to do when you want  
to purchase you know 600 will get you by don't get 
me wrong it will get you by but it's not the most  
comfortable thing ever okay my monthly expenditure 
for for average is it around between 1700 to 2000  
okay and that's because i do want to eat a 
good restaurant i don't want to eat at like  
dollar restaurants all the time i don't want 
to eat at restaurants that are what they call  
turo turo means means point point those little 
small carindiria type of places i don't mind  
eating there sometimes but i do like enjoyment 
enjoying a nice good steak a nice good meal  
you know and you can't do that with a 600 a 
month budget so the best way to really figure  
out a budget for you is number one is kind 
of look at you know how do you want to live  
i mean if you want to let's say you're a guy 
that you enjoy a coffee shop for example you  
enjoy going to a nice coffee shop maybe three 
four times you know a week let's say let's  
say a starbucks starbucks here compared the 
prices to the states for example is not that  
much different maybe it's about 25 cheaper so 
if that's something that you need in your daily  
you know in your monthly or your weekly routines 
you know it's already gonna cost you a lot if you  
need internet internet here is expensive it's 
one of the slowest internet in the whole world  
yet you pay so much i remember in the us i was 
paying 59 a month for a really high-speed internet  
59 is not going to get you anything here in 
the philippines so imagine if you need internet  
pretty much everybody needs internet nowadays 
right so you need to make sure that one of  
the biggest mistakes everybody makes who moves 
out here is not calculating a budget correctly  
now the fifth mistake made by a lot of foreigners 
moving down here is that they don't decide to  
learn the culture you know one thing that you need 
to do is before you immerse yourself in some place  
before you move yourself someplace you should 
learn about the culture and actually that's why we  
do a lot of these videos because we want to share 
it with you guys you need to know the culture and  
at the same time is don't get upset if people 
here don't adhere to the culture that you have  
because remember you're in the philippines not in 
the u.s not in australia not in europe you're in  
the philippines it's their culture so you have 
to respect that and i don't even understand how  
there's some foreigners that have expats living 
here in the philippines for you know five six  
seven whatever years and they just they only 
know the basic words and sometimes they'll  
forget that look i understand the philippines 
majority of people here can't speak good english  
can't understand english can communicate with 
some english as well for some people but just  
because that's okay that does not mean that you 
should hold yourself back and just because you're  
60 years old that does not mean that you can't 
learn the language you should be able to i mean  
just just do one word a day in one whole year 
that's 365 words that you should know by now  
learn the top 20 phrases we actually have a video 
about that learn what are the top 15 insults that  
that people say all the time here learn those 
things are such important things so those are  
some of the top five mistakes made that i've seen 
i've heard and heard from foreigners and expats  
that are deciding to move here to the philippines 
so that's one committing right away or do a full  
commitment right away before they even move here 
um start a business you know and then buy land  
they don't have the proper calculation 
of a budget and the last big mistake is  
not learning the culture and not even 
trying to learn the language spoken here  
so what do you think did i miss anything else if
