Good morning from Bohol,
where I'm at the Tagbalaran Seaport, right here.
About to take one of these boats across the water to Cebu.
About a two hour journey.
That's not my one, thankfully.
My one's coming in about 40 minutes
and I'm just waiting here in this departure lounge.
And it's pretty decent, actually.
It's fairly chill compared to
the airport departure lounge.
Okay.
Little drink to pass the time
as we wait for the boat
to arrive.
Just got this
mango coconut milkshake.
150 pesos.
Here is my Ocean Jet ferry to Cebu.
So it's about 20 minutes before this is due to leave
so I assume everybody's gonna
get off who's came from Cebu.
And then we're all gonna board.
I'm travelling in business class, so there's two classes,
I believe, economy or tourist class, I think they call it,
and business and
the price difference wasn't too much.
It was like 800 for tourist
class and 1200 for business class, so
we'll see the difference once we get onto the
boat and see if it was worth the extra
50% surcharge.
So I'm not sure what happens with my suitcase,
if it goes with me to my seat or I have to...
There seems to be a bunch of guys there
loading suitcases.
I don't know.
Does anybody else?
Yeah, nobody else seems to
have like a big suitcase like me, so
I don't know.
Hi po.
I take this suitcase on with me or no? This?
I can take this?
- You're business?
Yeah, business, yeah.
- You're business.
There's enough space? It's upstairs?
Upstairs.
- Okay.
So he says there's enough space in business for the
suitcase. I guess if I was travelling
tourist class I would have to...
Oh, thank you, po.
Thank you, so much.
Oh, very good.
Very nice service here, eh?
Okay, let's check this boat out then.
Hi, I'm in 1E.
1E, alright.
Business class upstairs. Yes
- Business class, upstairs? Okay.
So this, I guess, is the regular class.
There's 2 x 5 x 2.
So 9 seats across. We'll see
the difference in space.
Okay, for business class
passengers up the stairs. Let's
hoof
this is 25 kilo bag up here.
So I'm in the first row. That's A.
Ah, okay, so it's 2 x 2 x 2 so
6 seats instead of 9. You get,
you pay 50% more for your
ticket and you get 50% more space.
I think that's it.
And I'm in 1E which,
I think I've got the worst seat in the whole,
I think I've got the worst seat in the whole cabin.
Because my legroom is blocked by these stairs.
That's bad, isn't it?
I literally got the worst seat in the cabin.
I've got no legroom.
Look, every other seat has,
every other seat has legroom, apart from mine.
That's insane.
That is absolutely ridiculous. Look at this.
Check my, look at this. That is,
that is no good at all guys. That is no good at all.
I'm gonna check my ticket to make sure it really is 1E.
Yeah, 1 bloody E.
1 bloody E. That's it.
So, I didn't choose my seat. They chose it for me.
If I knew,
if I knew there was a bad seat like this,
I would have not chosen it.
So now you guys know, if you ever take this
and you're booking your seat, don't choose 1E.
You can literally choose any other of the,
how many rows is there?
Goes from 6.
So there's 6 X 6 = 36.
You can choose one of the other 36 seats.
I had a 1 in 36 chance of getting
stuck with this, guys.
And who knows, maybe
there's not somebody sitting next to me and
I can move over, but the next ferry after this...
Obviously this is an early ferry, 11.40.
I tried to book the one at 1 o'clock
so I could sleep an extra couple of hours,
but the business class on that one was full, so
I'm assuming... That was 2 days ago, as well, when I booked it,
so I'm assuming this one might be full as well,
by now, so,
yeah, we'll see. Look, there's plenty of people,
there's plenty of people boarding, right here.
I think we're gonna, I think we're gonna be packed and
as far as my luggage goes, I guess it can just go here.
I guess the good thing about the front,
the front seats is that I've got plenty of room for the,
the suitcase, here.
Other people don't have that.
Guess this is just a general luggage space.
So maybe the guy sitting next
to me also won't have any space if he,
if this guy loads up a bunch more suitcases over here.
I don't know if that's what he's planning on doing.
Well that is the control room right here. Oh.
I'm getting chased. The driver's coming.
Hi.
I think he's chasing me away.
I was just having a wee look.
That is where the ship is, driven?
Steered?
Navigated?
What's the correct verb,
guys?
It's where the driver's driving the ship,
up there.
But let's check out these seats, guys.
So you've seen the seats downstairs.
I don't think they were padded like this.
These are cushioned
chairs and they recline as well.
There's no fancy features.
There's no like electrical ports or anything like that.
No in-flight entertainment.
No in-boat entertainment.
Hi, you're in 1F, yeah? Okay, I'll let you in.
My neighbour,
right here.
You've got plenty of leg room.
Me, I've got this thing, here.
Yeah, good.
- Yeah.
But, yeah, there's some life jackets under the seats.
But...
It's packed.
This is where my feet are going, right here.
Yeah, you get long legs.
Yeah, it's not too bad.
I can just sit like this. It's only 2 hours.
Okay, we're heading off now, guys.
In about 2 hours will be in Cebu.
It's 2 hours, right?
- Yep.
2 hours, we'll be in Cebu.
I think there is one ferry that's faster.
There's one that goes in like 1.5 hours.
I think.
- Oh, yeah.
Yeah?
- Supercat.
But it's only, it only leaves
at like 6.30am or something like that.
Which I'm not gonna be awake for that.
This one has more regular schedules.
Yeah.
- They do this every 2 hours.
Ah, yeah.
- This ferry.
Yeah, so.
Yeah, there's this one.
But if you want to save money,
there's a cheap one that takes 4 hours.
I think it's like a freight ferry.
Where they're moving like containers?
They actually call it RORO.
- Yeah.
It's slow but cheap, right?
It's large.
- Yeah.
Where the cars ride.
Ah, so you can get your car on it?
Yeah, but there are passengers.
If you go as a passenger, it's
only like 400 pesos or something like that.
Yeah, so you can save money like that.
And just like the buses, like the Victory Liner bus,
they play movies on the ferry.
That's a big thing in the Philippines.
When you're on transport, they're always playing a movie.
Especially for a 2 hour boat ride like this.
Ah, right.
It's enough, the movie will be 2 hours.
And it is full. I think all the seats are taken.
So it's, if you come on this
ferry and you want to take business class,
you should book in advance, because if you just turn up,
there's not gonna be any seats left in business class.
Yeah.
I booked 2 days before.
This particular schedule.
It's always... You take this a lot, right?
Yeah, yeah.
- Because you're backing forward for business.
I do that once a week.
And it's always full, the business class?
Not all the time.
This schedule, 11:40 schedule.
Oh, 11:40 time?
- Because it's lunch time.
Yeah, and it's time people are
checking out of their hotel as well.
Yeah, yeah.
- So the 1pm ferry was...
That's the one that's...
Yeah, the 1pm ferry was full.
And the one earlier.
10:40. Yeah, there's a 10.40.
- Yeah, 10:40, yes.
And it gets full.
So is this the pace we go at or does it get faster?
We go faster.
- We go faster than this?
We go faster.
This is a shallow part.
So it is going slow.
Bye bye, Bohol.
Okay guys, let's check out the facilities here.
I dunno what to expect. Let's see.
Oh, it's nice and clean.
Check this out, guys.
That's not bad at all.
A nice business class bathroom here.
Check it out.
Very nice.
And I've just noticed
there's like a little outdoor part here.
Hello.
I didn't even realise there was another part upstairs,
that's like open air.
This is cool. There's hardly anyone here.
And you get the breeze.
Let's see if I can get a good view.
Guys, we're almost at Cebu.
We're almost there.
That is Cebu right there.
Right ahead of us.
And we are here, in Cebu.
Hi, how are you?
Here in Cebu after 2 hours.
We're in Cebu!
After 2 hours on this Oceanjet.
It was a nice comfortable ride.
The bloke I was sitting next to was really friendly.
I was talking to him the whole journey.
Gave me lots of advice for Cebu.
Told me that the Grab app works here, unlike in Bohol.
So I'll be able to get the
normal price for transport to my hotel.
And that's what I want to do now.
I think these people are boarding.
I don't want to board again.
I don't want to go back to Bohol.
I want to be going this way.
I think.
So it's gonna cost 172 on Grab.
There's a bunch of people shouting, right there.
I'm gonna get to the exit and see.
I think we're still inside. This looks
like a road, but I think this is actually,
we're inside the terminal here.
The ferry terminal.
So I'm gonna get outside. I know
it's 172 on Grab, so we shall see.
They're all looking at me.
Sir you take taxi?
- Yeah, I'm gonna get Grab.
Grab?
- Yeah.
You already booked?
- No, I'm booking now.
I'm gonna get from here.
How about taxi?
What?
- Taxi.
How much?
I know you.
- Where you go?
Hello, hello, hello!
Where you go?
- Holiday Inn.
Yeah Holiday Inn, come on.
- Yeah, how much, how much?
350.
I will take Grab, 170.
You're my idol. You're my idol.
- You're not.
If I'm your idol, give me the fair price.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I give you discount.
- No, you've got a motorbike. I need a car.
No, I'm taking a car, I'm taking a car.
I'm taking a Grab car.
No, no, no. I'll take a Grab.
It's only 170 on Grab.
I'll take a Grab, I'll take..
- I forget you, what's your name?
Dale. Nice to see you.
Okay, bro. Okay.
Okay, so, yeah.
As I thought, like they're trying to charge double.
And I think he was trying to take me on a bike.
I think he was trying to take me on a motorbike.
I can get an air-conditioned
car for half what he was charging, so
yeah.
I don't know where I'm supposed to stand to
await a pickup from a Grab.
I think probably just at the corner of this street, here.
I'll put that 7-Eleven in as the pickup point.
My friend.
It's okay, my friend.
I can't take a bike.
Look, I have a massive suitcase.
Give me, no, no.
Oh, you just want to take a picture?
Yeah.
- Ah, okay.
But I don't have a pic.. cell phone.
- You don't have a phone?
So how are you gonna take a picture?
If you don't have a phone?
- I will grab on your page.
What?
- I will grab to you on your page.
You will grab my page?
Oh, you want to take a selfie? Okay.
Okay, there's the selfie.
He's gonna see this video and he's gonna screenshot it.
And that's gonna be a selfie.

Yes, I'm gonna get my Grab to my hotel now.

Going to Holiday Inn. I'm waiting.

- Yes, I'm Dale.
Okay, friendly style.
We're in the front with the Grab driver.
Thank you for picking me up.
Oh, nice AC.
A nice, clean, comfortable car. That's what I want.
These guys were trying to take
me on a motorbike with the big suitcase.
Can you believe it? With a huge suitcase.
They were trying to charge me like 350 as well.
Big joke.
- Yeah.
I know that the way is to take Grab, guys.
It's nice, comfortable,
air conditioned, good.
Okay. So we're going to Holiday Inn.
Okay.
- Yeah.
So you're American, sir?
Scotland.
Scotland, UK.
You meet Scotland before here or no?
- Yeah, yeah.
So many.
You did? Oh, okay.
You meet all nationalities, right?
Because you're a Grab driver.
- All kinds of people.
Edinburgh, Scotland.
Yes, Edinburgh, you know. Yes.
But you need to pronounce like this, Edinburgh.
Edinburgh?
- Edinburgh, like that.
Yes, don't say Edinburgh.
Say Edinburgh.
Ah, because of burgh.
Yeah, burgh.
Yeah, Edinburgh, burgh.
Like that.
If you pronounce like that,
Scottish people will be impressed when they hear you say it.
- Edinburgh.
Edinburgh. Yeah, he did it.
Good, Edinburgh.
Edinburgh.
Yeah.
So you've met Scottish people before in your taxi?
- Yeah.
Yeah, okay, good.
Today I came from Bohol.
What part sir? What part?
Yeah, Panglao.
- Oh, Panglao.
But, I took the motorbike and I went all over.
Yeah, chocolate hills and such like.
How much did you rent?
The motorbike?
- Yeah.
400 per day. But a good one.
It was only 2,000 kilometres on the clock.
That kind of one?
No, Honda Click.
Ah, Honda Click.
- But a new one.
Okay.
- It was nice.
I have friends there working in UK.
In the UK, they're working?
The Filipinos are working everywhere.
Every country they're working.
Nurse.
- Nurse?
Ah, okay, yeah, yeah.
We're bringing in a lot of nurses
because we don't have enough of our own.
So we're bringing in from overseas.
In London and Birmingham.
Ah, okay.
- Also in Northern Ireland.
Londonderry.
Londonderry, okay, good.
Londonderry, they're going to, as well.
Part of UK, is it?
- Yeah, it's part of the UK, yes.
Oh, what's happened here?
The taxi bump.
Oh, the taxi. So it's the taxi's fault.
It's always the car who's behind who will be blamed.
So this taxi is... Just a small bump.
I think he just like,
a little bit,
dented the bumper or something.
His own one.
His own bumper.
It's gonna rain soon, right?
The sky is looking pretty black.
There's a low pressure.
Yeah, so.
This whole week has been rainy.
In Bohol, I don't know about Cebu,
but in Bohol it was super rainy.
Only yesterday, here.
Heavy downpour late night.
Yeah, and the forecast is for more, right?
Yes.
- Yeah.
I have bad timing for coming here.
But it's okay because it's very hot.
So it's good that we have a rain.
No, but even when it rains it's still hot.
It's just hot and rainy.
It's not like it cools down or anything.
Because you're used to cold place.
Yeah.
That's why I like Baguio so much.
When I was in Baguio.
So far it's my favourite place in the Philippines, Baguio.
Just because I can walk around
all day and not sweating, you know?
Yes, because the most there don't use air condition.
The most, no air condition.
Yeah, they don't need it.
They don't need air conditioning in Baguio.
Even in my hotel room I was sleeping with no AC
and I felt good, because most
places I'm sleeping with the AC on
and I wake up with a dry throat,
dry skin, dry eyes, you know, from the AC.
And in Baguio I didn't have to run the AC.
Just natural, just the natural temperature was perfect.
That's the summer capital of the Philippines.
Yeah.
- Baguio City.
If I was to live in the Philippines, I
would live in Baguio. You know,
if I had to choose a home in the
Philippines, that's where it would be.
In Baguio.
I don't know if there's another
place, is there another place like Baguio,
like this, that's high up and is cold?
Yes, there's a lot but not developed like Baguio.
Oh, Baguio is a developed one?
- Yes.
Now it's major for tourism, right? Domestic tourism mostly.
That was developed during the American time.
Ah, right. Yeah, I seen the park is named after like an American.
Burnham Park.
- Yeah, Burnham Park.
That's architect, Burnham.
Yeah, he's an American architect, right?
Yes, that place was built for
rest and recreation of the servicemen.
Ah right. So then it went, when the servicemen left,
then it went to being like a domestic tourism place.
Yes, that's right.
- Ah, okay.
I only learned that now.
I didn't learn that in Baguio. I
only learned that from the man in Cebu.
The man in Cebu told me. Okay.
- Yeah, because I'm fan of history.
Yeah. Have you been to Baguio?
Not yet.
- Not yet, he's not been. Ah, okay.
But you know about the history, so you're...
You're really into history about the Philippines?
- Yes.
Okay, so Cebu was the first place that
de Legazpi landed, made the settlement, right?
Yes, this is the oldest city in the Philippines.
Yeah, the first Spanish
colonial settlement, right here in Cebu.
The oldest street is here in Cebu.
Yeah, I will go investigate the oldest street.
Do you know the oldest street? Cebu?
- Yeah, I...
I don't know the name of
it, but I know it's here somewhere.
It's in Colon, Colon Street.
- Yeah, Colon Street, yeah.
Just like Magallanes Street, name after Magellan.
Okay.
But many people don't know who is Colon.
Yeah, who is Colon?
It's Christopher Columbus.
Really? Ah, really?
- Yeah.
His native name in Genoa, Italy is Colon.
Ah, so they named the street after him?
Yes.
- Christopher Columbus. Ah, okay.
Is there many old buildings still on the street?
- Yes.
Ah, okay, I will go check that out.
That's a historical place in Cebu, the downtown.
Downtown area.
- Colon Street.
I've not traveled outside the
Philippines, but I know all the places in the world,
all the countries, including their capitals.
Oh, really? Let me test you then, let me test you.
- Yeah.
Okay.
- What is the capital of Australia?
Canberra.
- Oh yeah, good.
What is the capital of Austria?
Vienna.
- Yes, good.
What is the capital of Luxembourg?
Luxembourg.
- Yes, yeah, Luxembourg is the
capital because it's a city and a country.
Yes.
What is the capital of...?
I'm trying to think, what's a difficult one?
What's the capital of St. Kitts and Nevis?
Basseterre.
I have no idea, I guess it's correct.
You seem confident.
I don't even know myself.
I just tried to find one that

Jamaica.
Kingston.
- Kingston, ah.
Okay, good.
So, what, you studied it or...?
No, it's embedded in my mind,
in my memory because I love geography.
Ah, okay, that's why when I got in your car
you said, oh, you're from Scotland, Edinburgh.
Oh, that's right, that's right.
So everybody who gets in your car, who's international,
Oh. Yes. That's why,
- you can tell them their capital?
they were amazed, I know their place.
- Oh, the Bogota people?
Yeah, they got in and you were like, oh, Bogota.
I know, the Cali, the Medellin,
the Medellin Cartel of Pablo Escobar before.
Ah, right. Oh, good.
So you know a lot about countries, but
you've never traveled outside of the Philippines?
Yes, yes, that's right.
I know all the countries including their capitals.
- That's good.
Maybe I will miss some because of memory.
But then you will remember again?
- Yes, sir.
Even United states, capitals.
You know the capital of each state?
- Yes.
Ah, okay, Florida.
- Philippine provinces.
Florida.
Florida, Tallahassee.
Okay, wow.
Wow, wow, wow, wow.
Incredible.
Incredible.
Yeah, you're good.
It's holiday.
Holiday Inn.

Yeah, like a first name but it is a surname.
Like a first name but it is a surname.
Yeah, Phillip.

Okay.
I'm always nervous getting
out a taxi when I have the suitcase
in the trunk, in case they just

You know?
Okay.
You got it.
Okay, thank you so much, sir.
Nice to see you.
Thank you, so much.

A nice driver.
Okay, so this is my hotel, Holiday Inn,
right here. Let's go and check in.
It's okay, I got it.
I got like three quarters
of the way there so it's all good.
Okay, let's go and check in then.
Okay.
Hi, how are you guys?
I'm checking in.
Yes, Mr. Philip, I can see that you're Diamond Elite sir.
Yes, Diamond.
So for this one, you booked for this five nights right?
- Yeah, five.
You don't have any girls?
Look at this. They don't have any girls.
All men. Six men.
Where are the pretty Cebu girls?
They're inside. We will go out later and change.
Ah, okay, you will change.
- After the day shift.
Ah, okay, so the evening. I think the evening shift is girls.
We'll see.
But just now we just have six,
we just have six dudes.
Here.
I'm gonna check out this Colon Street.
Anyway. Yeah, the taxi driver told me about this.
It's like the oldest street in the Philippines.
Also you can also check Santo Niño Church.
Santorini Church?
Santo Niño, sir.
- Santo Niño
Little Jesus, black Jesus.
Black Jesus?
- Yes sir.
Really?
So I've been recommended to go and see the black Jesus.
And it's black because it was washed up?
- Yes.
So it was washed up and it turned up
like that and now they've like made it like a...
- Yes, sir.
It's just same thing in Manila, the Nazareno.
Okay, I'll go and check that out as well.
It's near the Magellan's Cross.
Okay, thank you.
- But it's a small, it's a baby Jesus.
It's inside the church?
- Yes.
It's inside the church, okay.
We'll go and check that out as well.
Okay, this my card?
Yes sir, here you go.
- Okay.
Thank you so much guys. Thank you.
Okay, shout out to RJ and Paolo.
- Yes, sir.
But not to the rest, right?
They told me they wanted a
shout out but not to the rest of the guys.
So, thank you RJ, thank you Paolo.
Okay, let's go and check this room out then.
I'm paying $75 a night.
That's what I'm paying.
I'm just expecting an ordinary, Holiday Inn room.
Nothing special, just a small, comfortable
room with a good working desk and internet.
That's the main thing.
When you stay in one of these
chain hotels, you're kinda almost guaranteed,
almost guaranteed a good working desk and internet.
Let's see if they've got it, guys, here on the 18th floor.
And I think this says 18... 15.
I think it's 1815.
Yes, it is indeed.
1815.
Let's check this room out, guys.
I've made a right mess of that, haven't I?
What have I done?
Okay.
Doing things one handed, it's difficult.
Right, let's check the room out.
And it's kinda what I was expecting.
There we go.
It's kinda what I was expecting.
Small, but comfortable and there is no working desk.
Yeah, there's no working desk. There's just this.
Which I suppose is good enough.
At least you've got like a big
space and yeah, there's a power socket there.
So, okay, I mean that's fine.
I'm definitely gonna be comfortable enough there.
I was just thinking there would be
like a space there, for a working desk.
It's more of a coffee table.
But, yeah, most Holiday Inns, the
room is kinda small like this,
but the furniture, the bed
and everything's always comfortable.
Like, you know, here it's like a big open wardrobe thing.
It's like they're trying to maximise space, basically.
And then they always give you
the two different types of pillows,
firm and soft, so you can
combine the two, combine two soft ones,
have two firm ones.
That's always good when you're kinda like,
when you're fussy about how you sleep, you know?
You can always try and make yourself comfortable.
And the bathroom, it's nice, it's all clean.
And no overhead rain shower,
unfortunately. It's just the kinda attachment thing,
but it's a fairly decent one.
It looks like a fairly decent one.
And then the
herbal
shower gel, shampoo and stuff.
Okay.
I think I can be comfortable enough here,
but most important thing is, internet speed.
And here we go guys, my office
for the next week, right here. My working desk,
which I can easily slide my legs under,
unlike in some hotels where the desk and chair don't match.
If you've watched my previous
vlogs, I've been stung by that several times,
but not here, it's good.
It's a pity about the round, coffee table type desk.
You just lose so much real estate like here, you know?
It's awkward for your hand, here on your mouse.
It's just not that comfortable compared
to a square desk or a rectangle desk, is it?
But it's decent enough. I can be fairly comfortable here.
I can be fairly comfortable here.
I'm not too comfortable with the internet. It's a bit slow.
We've got 8 megabits download, almost 13 megabits upload.
A bit on the slow side.
When I read the reviews for this
hotel, it said the internet was fast.
Oh, they've got fast WiFi.
But the people writing the
reviews, they never say what speed it was.
It's just like, probably they were
checking their email and it opened really fast
and they were like, "Oh, fast WiFi."
So, yeah, people in the reviews, they
need to start running speed tests and say,
"Oh, I got 13 megabits upload and 8 megabits download."
And then you know, okay, it's actually a bit slow.
It's actually a bit of a
slow internet. It's not that great.
But I can make do with it. I
can make do with like 10 megabits,
is kinda like the limit of what I can make do with.
And keeping me company here, is my wee teddy bear.
Guys, I got this as a gift from the first
hotel I stayed at, in the Philippines, the Somerset.
On like the third day, they came and
they gave me a tray with a teddy bear and like
dried mango and a bunch of snacks and gifts and stuff.
It wasn't in the vlog because I'd
already done the hotel room tour and stuff
a couple of days before that but it was very nice of them.
They probably usually give this
to kids, like the little teddy bear.
But I've been taking it around and
I normally just leave it at the bedside.
But today, it's at my working desk,
my wee Ascott Cubby, it's called.
I think Ascott are the chain
of hotel that that Somerset was part of.
But, yeah, this is my office for the next week, guys.
And my view for the next week is of this. Let's see.
Ta-da!
It is a kinda office / condominium type area.
As you can see, loads of condominium buildings there.
These are like office buildings
and in the middle is a fancy mall, the
Ayala Centre, Cebu.
I just looked it up on Google Maps and
people are saying that's the best mall around town.
And have a look at the area down here.
It's nice big open roads, nice clean pavements.
Look, it's just very clean, very well developed.
So, yeah, I think I'm in the fancy area.
Maybe you could compare this area
to Makati or something like that in Manila.
But definitely a lot less,
a lot less busy, there's less people, there's less traffic.
It looks very peaceful. I'm looking
forward to getting out and having a look about.
Just getting settled into my room right now, guys.
And, yeah, they should really have a working desk.
That's what I was thinking, as I was looking at this room.
They should really have a working desk.
Because instead of the space for a
working desk, they have this long sofa.
Which is nice. You could probably sleep on that.
If you were a family or something, you
could probably have like
mum and dad in the bed
and then have the kid just sleeping here.
In fact, does it pull out or something?
No, it is just the chair. Maybe that's why they have that.
So that parents can bring their kids.
But, yeah, I would prefer they just had the one sofa there
and then this was an actual
proper working desk with the nice view.
But, hey, who am I? I'm not
an architect. I'm not a designer.
I'm just a guy who lives in hotel rooms 365 days a year.
What do I know? What do I know, guys?
But, what I know, right now, is it's like 3:30pm.
I need to get out and do
something in the city before the day ends.
Don't want to waste a day.
So, yeah, I'm not gonna go to the mall. Too boring.
A mall is just a mall. I'll go
there eventually, but not right now.
I fancy going to that Colon street.
Like two different people have
mentioned it by the time I even checked into my hotel.
The taxi driver and the hotel receptionist.
So, yeah, apparently right now it's
not like the night market time or something.
But I looked it up on Google Maps and it looks
like an old street with street vendors and such like.
Maybe I can get some snacks, some
street snacks or something down there.
It's about 4km away, guys. Let's make our way there.
So here I am, guys. Colon street.
The oldest street in the Philippines.
This street has been a street since 1565
when the Spanish set up their
first colony here in the Philippines.
They set up this street first and everything
else in Cebu has been built all around this street.
Colon Street. Named after Cristóbal Colón.
Christopher Columbus.
Named after that man who, he would have died like
60 years before this street was established.
But they named it after him.
And this is what it looks like these days, guys.
It's basically a big old shopping street.
Kind of lower end retail shops and eateries.
A few street vendors, like that.
The buildings themselves don't look old.
They're definitely not from the 1500s.
They're more recent buildings, guys.
So, I don't see a lot of history around, guys.
It basically looks like, I would say it just
looks like any other street in a big city in Asia, you know.
People selling bits and pieces.
Socks, baseball caps and such.
Those baseball caps ain't too bad are they?
How much are the baseball caps?
- 130.
130 each? Ah, okay, it's good.
I like that Adidas one, there.
And what else is there?
Oh, North Face.
What is this?
This one, 150.
Yeah, what is it? I don't know what it is.
- Marijuana.
I've never seen before in my life. I don't know what it is.
Marijuana design.
It is marijuana, uh?
Design.
Okay, let's see.
I don't know, I think if I
wear this the police will come to me.
I know.
Yeah, the police will bother me if I wear this one, I think.
Okay, got Slipknot.
US Army.
I think, I like this one, the Adidas. I like.
Okay, so 130, basically 2 bucks, $2.
Can I try?
- Yeah.
Let's see if it looks good.
What do you think?
Good or not good?
Okay.
She says it's okay.
I'm getting soaked by
something. Something's dripping on me.
Something's dripping on my arm.
Oh, it's this.
Oh, okay, something's dripping here. That's why that's there.
I was standing right over it. I'm getting soaked.
Okay, 130, yes?
130, okay.
Lady buying some earrings.
You're getting earrings?
- Yeah.
Ah, how much are those?
One pair 10 pesos.
110?
One pair 10 pesos.
Only 10 pesos, really? Oh, wow, that's good.
It's really good.
Wow, only 10 pesos. Okay, let's find...
There's 150. You can keep the change, Auntie.
Thank you, so much. Thank you. Okay.
That's nice.
Got myself a new baseball cap. I
wasn't really looking for one, but I just saw it.
I saw she had some good ones.
And then I asked the price. The price was cheap, guys.
130 pesos, $2 bucks for a brand new, a
brand new Adidas cap,
here on the Philippines' oldest street,
Colon Street.
Yer man is shouting because
it's also Philippines' loudest street.
And if I wasn't shouting, you wouldn't
hear a word I was saying.
So... Oh, it's a bit quieter here. A bit more chilled at the,
the Mickey D's. Let's give a high five to Ronnie McD.
Okay, there you go, Ronnie.
High five from yer man.
Dale Philip.
- Let's continue. Hi, guys. How are you?
Hello.
- Nice to see you.
Okay. Oh, we've got a juice
vendor right here. That looks good.
And it's fresh, because
they've got fresh mangoes, right there.
I think I'll get a...
I think I'll celebrate my new
Adidas cap with a fresh mango juice.
Hello, Auntie.
You got a customer before me.
What are you making here? Papaya?
Melon. Melon, Cantaloupe.
Melon. Cantaloupe.
Yeah, it looks like a...
Cantaloupe.
It looks... Oh, it's this, cantaloupe, yeah.
I thought it was papaya by the
colour, but it's that orange melon.
Maybe I'll go for that then.
She's just made it fresh, so maybe I'll go for that.
- Yeah it's fresh.
Yeah, can I have one glass of this? But you
have another customer before me, though.
Serve her first. I don't
wanna be accused of skipping the queue,
or anything. Okay.
How much is one cup?
This one is 50.
- Oh you have different size?
You have different sizes?
????
That's the biggest or no?
- Biggest.
Oh, 50.
Okay. 50 pesos, that's good.
It's like 90 cents for a
fresh, fresh juice, from fresh melon.
And you add this as well, right? That's...
Oh yeah, evaporated creamer. Okay, they always...
Even though fruit is already sweet, it's like in Indonesia.
They always add condensed milk
or something to make it even sweeter.
Oh.
There you go.
- Okay.
Okay, thank you, so much.
The sweet drink from the sweet
lady. Thank you. Thank you, so much.
That's good.
And I saw there, she wore the glove to pick the straw out.
So she cares about hygiene. That's nice.
It's what you want to see when you're
consuming things from street vendors, guys,
as we continue strolling
down this Colon street right here.
Like I said, it's kinda lower end retail
stuff and a lot of shops selling the baseball caps.
I guess that's why they're so cheap, guys. The competition.
Anywhere where everyone's all selling
the same stuff, you always get it cheap.
Don't you guys?
Okay, so I think I'm gonna walk
up this side of the street, check it out,
and then I'll walk back down the
way, on that side of the street, guys,
While I consume. Oh, that's a mall.
Like a wee mall in there.
Aye, while I consume my melon juice.
It's good, yeah. Oh, yes.
Like a ripe, ripe, ripe rock melon. It's like the...
It's like the rock melon.
But even sweeter because she's
adding the condensed milk. It's delicious.
They've got Pares here. Pares Pinoy.
So I still haven't tried Pares yet.
Pares is braised beef with rice.
I haven't tried it yet. I might go
there after I've checked this street out
because I'm trying to tick off all the Filipino
cuisines that I haven't tried yet, before I leave the country.
Still got to try Pares and a few
other things like pork lechon and bulalo.
That soup with the bone marrow. Those are the
three things I really need to try before I leave here.
Ah, that was lovely.
I could have another one of
those, or I could have something else.
I'm looking around for something else.
This part of the road seems to be pretty derelict.
There's nothing going on. A lot of shops closed and stuff.
So I might be heading towards... This is a
long, long street but this is probably the end of it.
And I was just sitting there
consuming my juice and
somebody else told me that there's a night
market here on Friday, Saturday and Sunday
and he says they stop all the cars
and this will just be like one big market.
So I will definitely come back here and try that.
What is this guy selling? Some
kind of fried... Looks like pakora.
Looks like an Indian style pakora, yeah.
Just the colour of it. The colour
of it reminded me of Indian street food.
But, yeah, there doesn't seem to be much else going on here.
I'm probably gonna just cross
the road and start walking back down.
Guys, is it safe for me to just run out of here or not?
It better be because I'm doing it. It better be safe.
Hey, bro.
Okay, good.
I was looking for a 7-11 to find a
rubbish bin but I found some just random shop.
Hey, guys. What's up?
What's this that seems to be
popular? Patty's. It's like a bakery.
It seems to be popular.
What do they sell? Let's have a look.
All sorts of ube stuff. Ube bar, ube roll, ube everything.
Okay, maybe I'll pick some of these up. Look at that, guys.
Look at that, right there.
Maybe I'll pick some of these
up to take back to my hotel with me.
I didn't bring my bag. I didn't bring
my bag, so I can't just buy stuff like that
and carry it around in my hand. I only have
one free hand because one is for the camera, guys.
So I can't be walking around
with bags of shopping. Can I? I need my...
I need my free hand for eating. For eating and drinking
local food and drinks.
Which is what I'm looking for right now.
I expected there would be more on this street.
Like more street vendors and
stuff. Just looking at Google maps, but yeah.
Looks like I'm gonna have to come
back when they have the night market for that.
Oh, I do see Lechon right there.
That's what I've been looking for guys.
Some lovely Lechon. Except I wanna find the
restaurant where they're actually, you know, roasting the pig.
I don't just want to go into one
of these places where it's already made.
And they just serve it to you on a
plate. No, I wanna see that pig roasting.
So that's what I'm on the lookout for while I'm in Cebu.
I didn't really see that in Manila but
everyone tells me Cebu is the place for Lechon.
I see this restaurant a lot,
while I've been travelling in the Philippines.
It must be some kind of chain restaurant.
What is it? Is it like a Nando's or
something? Some kind of like spicy chicken.
Inasal. I don't know but that's definitely
like a big chain that must be popular here.
Oh wow. I've just walked like one
minute down the street and there's another one.
There's another one of that same restaurant.
And they've got Halo Halo, as
well, that starts at only 39 pesos.
Yeah. I gotta try that out at some point, guys.
Lots of stuff that I've got to
try out. What are these guys doing?
Rubber stamp?
- Oh, it's rubber stamps? Oh, okay, that's cool.
You do custom, custom made ones? Or
it's just these ones that are available.
Leyte, Leyte State University. Ah, okay. Very cool.
Oh, yeah, I think he's like custom making them or something.
Okay, thank you for letting
me look. Thank you, guys. Very nice.
Oh, yeah, he's like custom making one there.
Okay, very good. Okay.
So you can get yourself
a... Oh, there's loads of them. Look.
Loads of these rubber stamp guys. So,
if you're in the market for a
rubber stamp, this is where to come, guys.
Colon Street. Opposite from Mickey D's.
In between Mickey D's and Jolly B's guys.
And this is me veering off Colon Street right now.
Guys, I think there's not much to see here for a tourist.
I would say if you're a tourist and
you want to see Colon Street,
come here for the night market that's
apparently on the Friday, Saturday, Sunday nights.
I'm gonna come back for that but for
now I'm going to go for a wander elsewhere, guys.
Check it out. They still sell
DVDs, Blu-ray discs and such like...
Yeah, you don't really see
that anymore in other parts of Asia.
Mobile disco shop, right there.
Yeah, you don't really see...
When I first started
travelling around Asia, like 2010, 2011,
every market, they were selling like
copied DVDs, copied Xbox games and stuff.
But you never see that anymore.
Everything's all digital these days.
Digital downloads, streaming or
just... people just download their stuff.
It's so easy to download stuff.
But, yeah, they're still selling DVDs there.
Oh my god, another one of
these. Another. Another bloody Inasal.
Okay, I think I'm gonna have to try
it at some point. It looks like it's Nando's.
Just looks like a Nando's, plus
you can get a halo-halo for dessert.
Guys, okay.
My mind was actually on that Pares,
the first restaurant I've seen, the Pares.
But, yeah, maybe it's a sign. I've seen so
many of these restaurants around, this Inasal,
I think I gotta try it.
Something is going on
here. I don't know what this place is.
Hi.
Take off. Please take.
- I have to take the hat off?
Okay.
Ah, okay. What is this? It's church?
- You can do a vlog. Yeah.
Basilica del Santo Niño.
Basilica de santerino. I think
that's where the guy said the black Jesus was.
I was about to put my cap straight back on.
Like I do when they tell me to put on the
mask and then I take it straight off afterwards.
But I think, yeah, from what
I remember from when I was a kid,
you can't go into a church wearing baseball caps.
So that's what it is. Basilica de...
Basilica del Santo Niño.
So, yeah, very quiet in here.
Just a lot of people praying.
Let's walk to the front and have a look.
I don't think there's any
service going on or anything, guys.
It's just people just come here to sit and pray.
Hi. How are you?
Hi.
Oh, this is beautiful out here, the garden area.
Very nice.
Yes.
You from Cebu?
No, Davao.
Oh, so you came, you're tourist?
From Mindanao?
- Yes.
Okay. Hi. How are you?
Little kid.
- Hello.
What is he eating?
Bread.
Oh, ube.
Ah, okay.
Ah, okay. He's eating ube.
Oh, what?
These, this is like Japanese style.
Yes.
You try?
Okay. Thank you, so much.
Okay.
She's offering me one.
Yeah, these are like,
I think it's like Japanese style,
but they've got ube in it,
so it's Filipino.
Filipinos love ube.
It's like a spongy sponge with ube cream.
And an ube cream that's in the middle.
Can I take a picture with you?
- Yeah, sure.
Mmm, yes. Lovely.
Thank you.
Thank you.
- Okay, no problem.
Thank you for the ube fish.
What do you call these?
- Manju.
Manju?
Is this a Filipino thing or? I think this is Japanese.
Yeah, I think it's Japanese.
Because I've seen this.
Like Japanese ice creams.
When I was in Tokyo, they'd have like, it
was more like a wafery texture though in Japan.
Wait there, my brother take me a picture with you.
Oh. Your brother wants to take a picture with me.
Yes.
I see you on Facebook.
You see me on Facebook? Ah, okay.
- Yeah.
So this is like a garden area for the church?
Oh, it's nice.
Hello.
Eat more.
You tell me to eat more.
She's like, she already gave me one.
She's like, "Eat more, eat more."
Yeah you eat more.
- Really? I eat more?
Oh, you're so generous.
Thank you, so much
for giving me more of the manju.
Ice manju.
- Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.
- Yeah.
These are lovely.
Delicious, delicious.
Yeah, tasty. Ube.
Take a picture.
Why do Filipinos love ube so much?
Why you love ube so much?
Because we are rich.
This one's not ube. It's like...
Filipino people are rich.
This is custard.
- Rich in foods.
Rich foods, yeah.
Good?
- Yeah.
Oh, thank you so much for the manju.
This is a custard one. It's lovely.
What's your name?
Philip.
- Philip?
Yeah, Dale Philip.
My son and daughter and grandson.
Oh, this is your family.
Ah, so you came from...
- I'm the mother.
You all came from Mindanao to visit here as a tourist?
Ah, okay, good.
So they're also tourists, but domestic tourists.
I came from China.
When?
Vacation there.
You're...?
- Vacation there for over seven months.
This year?
- Nice to meet you.
I came here last Sunday only.
Nice to see you guys.
Nice to see you. I'm gonna walk around this church area.
- Nice to see you.
See you next time.
- Yes, I'll see you next time.
Okay, this is nice.
And these people here, they're
queueing to get into the chapel to pray.
There's like a praying area, but...
I think no video allowed there.
Okay, there's a huge big complex here.
It's more than just this
Basilica del Santo Niño.
It's a whole big complex and I've just read on Google.
I was looking for signs inside that
would tell me something about the history,
but I had to go to Google
and I found that this was the
first ever church in the Philippines.
This was the first ever one in 1565.
Dale is here.
- Hi, hello.
So, the same year that they came here, the Spanish,
they built the church in the same year.
So that's how important religion was to them, guys.
Now, how important food is to me.
That is what I'm gonna go hunting for right now.
Hi, vlog.
Hi, how are you?
- What is your channel?
Dale, Dale.
Subscribe, subscribe.
Dale Phillip. Okay, subscribe, subscribe.
- Ah, yeah, yeah yeah. How much subscribers?
Only a few, but if you subscribe, I will have one more.
Okay, thank you.
Thank you.
Hey guys, how are you?
Good.
- Good.
Bye-Bye.
- Okay, so,
I'm heading back towards that Colon Street.
That's it right at the end, the Colon Street.
I'm heading back up there.
Maybe I'll go eat that
Inasal stuff that I keep seeing, guys.
That's really what's on my mind right now.
Unless I see anything better on the way.
Okay, here we are, right ahead of us, Mang Inasal, guys.
Hi po.
Good afternoon.
- Okay, thank you.
Okay, so it's one of these, you order,
and then take it to your table.
Like McDonald's or something, I guess.
Kinda informal.
Hello. Can I have the chicken Inasal please?
Sir, only this one.
Oh, you don't have that one? I wanted the regular one.
Is it the same flavour but bigger?
Bigger.
But the same flavour?
- Yes.
Ah, okay.
- But like breast part.
It's the best part? Oh, the meaty part.
Okay, I'll have that with the drink.
- Which drink?
I'll have the iced red gulaman.
We only have Coca Cola, Sprite and Coke Zero for drink.
- Okay, I'll have Coke Zero.
Then, also I want the halo-halo.
Ah, that's small and that's regular.
Okay, I want the big one. Okay.
I'm gonna get the big one.
Oh, and they have... Okay, I
think that's gonna be enough for now.
I'll repeat your order. One order of...
- Pecho
Coke zero for drink and halo regular. For dine in.
- Yeah. Okay.
Good.
- 304.
304.
Okay, thank you.
- Just go upstairs.
I wait or I come down. I wait?
- Wait.
Okay, thank you. Okay, so you get the, you get this.
They've got an upstairs part. I'm gonna go up.
And then they bring it to your table. That's good.
So, I was saying it's like McDonald's but
you don't get that kind of service at McDonald's.
I did get that kind of service in Jollibee.
Before, they brought the food to my table in Jollibee.
Okay.
Oh, it's popular, guys.
It's popular. There's like multiple branches
of this restaurant, all in a small space.
And, yeah, it's packed full of people.
Okay, let's rock up right here.
It looks like this guy comes round with a bucket
and he gives you more rice if you need it.
He just comes round with that.
People are eating.
They finish their rice. He just gives them an extra scoop.
That's good.
At some restaurants, you get
free refills on your drinks.
Here it's free refills on your,
on your rice.
Oh, this is mine here. Wow.
Look at this halo-halo.
Look at the size of this halo-halo right here.
That looks amazing.
My Coke Zero.
And this, the Chicken Inasal.
Okay, what is this?
Noodles?
Oh, okay, I dunno. It's a tilabo?
Okay. Some various sauces and such like.
Thank you so much. Thank you. Okay.
- Thank you.
This is what we've got, guys. Right here.
Okay, I'm gonna eat this as quickly as possible
because I don't want this halo-halo to melt, guys.
That's the thing. I can see
it's starting to melt already, so
I'm gonna try and eat this chicken as quickly as possible.
And I see most people here are eating with their hands.
Almost everybody is eating with their hands.
And there's a hand wash station right there,
so that's what I've done.
I've just washed my hands and then,
I'm gonna... Is it hot?
Not too hot. I'm just gonna dig in with my hands, guys
and eat this
big old piece of chicken right here.
Yeah.
It just tastes like a grilled chicken with
sweet sauce. It tastes like that
Lechon Manok that I ate in Bohol.
It just tastes exactly like that.
The rotisserie chicken.
So, they're saying here. This is the grill expert.
They're saying it's like a, like a grill meat plate.
So that's what it is.
Grilled chicken.
And it's approved by Jane De Leon, whoever she is.
She's that woman right there. That's who she is.
Lovely.
The sauce is kinda sweet. It's
kinda got like a sweet glaze to it.
And the crispy bits right here.
There you go.
And this stuff, I've no idea.
It looks like little rice noodles with,
what is on top, what is on top guys?
I think it's fish.
Pieces of white fish in a kinda slightly spicy sauce.
Hmm. Interesting.
I don't know if you're supposed to eat this with your hands.
It's a bit messy.
Yeah guys.
Fork for the noodles.
Hand for the chicken.
That is the method.
That is the method.
I think soy sauce.
Yeah, soy sauce.
Halo-halo guys. The halo-halo.
Wow.
So there's green jelly, there's red jelly,
there's, looks like caramelised banana,
there's leche flan, looks like red beans,
some other kinda yellow beans,
looks like there's some cheese in there,
and of course the ube, the
ube ice cream right in the middle there.
Wow, I'm going straight for that ube ice cream, so I am.
Straight for the ube ice cream.
Yum, yum, yum.
Just what I need guys.
Been walking around out there,
all hot and sweaty.
This is the antidote to hot sweaty walking about.
A halo-halo.
It's all this shaved ice on the bottom, so cold,
but it's starting to melt already.
I tried to demolish that as quickly as I could.
I didn't want this
to be all melted by the time I got to it.
It's almost a soup already, look at it.
It's almost like a milkshake.
I should just be drinking this, guys.
Yeah I need them to put this in
a big cup and give me a straw.
I can just walk around outside and drink this.
Guys, it's delicious, it's so sweet.
So the first time I had halo-halo,
it was a lady who, her friends
were, a lot of diabetics were her friends
and she made it with very little sugar.
It was very little sweetness.
It tasted kind of healthy, actually.
This, it doesn't taste
healthy, but it tastes a lot sweeter.
Oh, it's so cold, so sweet, so delicious.
Mmm, and I really like
these, the little red sago jelly pieces.
They are really like
strawberry, intensely strawberry flavour.
Demolished.
Demolished, guys.
Okay, thank you po. Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Okay, that was lovely, guys.
That was looovely. Feeling nice and satisfied now.
Hope you guys are nice and satisfied with the vlog.
I'm still shouting because, like I said,
this is Philippines' oldest street and
also Philippines' loudest street.
So I'm just gonna have to be
Philippines' louder's vlogger right now, aren't I guys?
But I hope you guys...
Got a bit of an obstacle to tackle here.
I hope you guys are satisfied with the vlog
and I'll see you on the next one, won't I?
I'm gonna stock up the minibar from 7-Eleven
and go back to my hotel.
