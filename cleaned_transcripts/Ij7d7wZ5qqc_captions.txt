- (PvF) What are your thoughts
on Jollibee?
- Love, love, love!
- Yeah, it's great.
It's great!
- Absolutely, absolutely, so good!
- We're just waiting for
the other shoe to drop, Nicole.
- Are we trying Jollibee?
- (PvF) You are trying 
Jollibee, sort of.
We are doing an
Eat In One Second: Jollibee.
- No, I saw videos
of you guys.
You guys were just like...
- Yeah.
- (PvF) You guys, the winner
of this episode
will get a Get Out Of 
Punishment Free card.
- I want one of those.
- Yeah.
- I really want one of those,
'cause I never say no to the food.
- I just can't lose.
That's not my thing.
- I don't like this.
- We can tie!
- I just wanna win though,
I just wanna win.
- Okay, if that...
Okay, so now we're
playing street rules.
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- I see, okay.
- (man) Hey guys, today we are
trying Jollibee mango peach pie!
- Mango peach pie?
- Oh my God, that sounds amazing.
- Okay, this is delicious.
- Mango peach pie,
one second to get that in.
- That was crispy!
- Ooh!
- Wow!
- (man) Did you hear the crunch?
- I did hear that crunch.
- (man) Let's go one more time.
- Oh!
- Aprons.
- Some aprons!
- Ooh.
- Hand it over.
- (PvF) Sweet and flaky,
fun fact,
these peach mango pies
are made with real Philippine mangoes.
- Oh, we love that.
- Ooh, we do love that!
- Ooh!
- Like a little empanada
or something.
- It does look like
an empanada!
(Yeshua sighs)
(Zaria gasps)
- Dude, the crunch is insane.
(Zaria screams)
- Okay, there we go.
- I gotta hear from the vet.
- (PvF) What are you doing?
- Well, I'm seeing how big this is.
(Benison laughs)
- I'm nervous.
- I'm a little nervous.
I had a huge lunch,
so that was a mistake.
- This is, I don't even know how to,
which way to take it.
- That's what she said.
(Benison laughs)
- (PvF) You ready?
- Ready as I'll ever be.
- (PvF) Three, two, one.
Time.
Time.
Zaria!
Time.
Yep.
- Mmm!
(bell rings)
- (PvF) You guys each get
a full point.
(bell rings)
That's a half point Zaria,
and a full point for Yeshua.
- That was like the best
fast food pie I've ever had.
Like, McDonald's has nothing.
- I don't know, I think like
halfway through...
- What happened champ?
- I like knew I failed,
and then I wanted to actually
enjoy it.
(both laugh)
- (narrator) Jollibee 
Yumburger.
- Yum!
- Yum!
The Yumburger,
100% pure beef!
(Zaria laughs)
- The whole burger?
- Yeah.
- There's no way I'm
getting a burger in my mouth.
- Ah.
- This makes me wanna eat this!
- I know, that's part of 
the problem too,
with these challenges,
is that looks very good.
- Look at how happy
and handsome that man is.
- Wow!
- Homey looks so content.
- Big frickin' burger.
- Oh, this is a little bigger
than I expected.
- (PvF) The Langhap-Sarap Yumburger,
which tastes as good as it smells,
is simply a burger
with their signature dressing,
a slice of cheese,
on a fresh bun.
- Ooh, look at that,
that's a thick burger right there.
- That's a thick boy!
- That's a thick boy right there.
(Benison laughs)
- I tore my burger in half.
She's mashing her burger
like some potatoes.
- Give me a second.
- (laughs) I didn't know this was like
such a hands on experience.
- Oh yeah, that's why I don't wear
my wedding ring here anymore.
- Ah!
- Bloating in my hands.
- I don't know if that
helped at all.
- Look at our little meatballs.
(Zaria laughs)
- Alright.
- Okay, hurry up,
I'm nauseous.
- Two seconds.
- Mm-hmm.
- (PvF) Two, one.
And time.
Time.
And time.
- Mmm!
- Hmm?
(bell rings)
Hmm, hmm, hmm-hmm?
- (PvF) That is a point.
- I don't appreciate that, Nicole.
- (PvF) That is a point 
for each of you!
- You were like...
- (PvF) That is a full point
for you, Jayse.
A half point, Jillian.
- Mm-hmm.
- (PvF) How are you feeling,
Benison?
(Benison mumbles)
Try saying chubby bunny.
- Chubby Bunny.
- Oh, my hands, I don't know
what's happened to them,
but they are not the same.
- That special sauce,
I gotta know the secret.
- I think that's what
victory tastes like.
- Yeah, easy there, champ.
We got four more.
- I was like, I did it!
- We got four more going here, pal.
- Oh, see...
- Oh, I love rice.
- That's a lot of rice.
- (sighs) I can't do rice.
- That whole thing?
- Rice and beans, let's go!
- Oh man.
- Alright, some rice.
- Spoon it in.
- One one thousand, two one thousand.
That's tough.
- Yep.
- (PvF) Here you go.
Do you want a spoon?
- No, I only have three seconds
to eat this, right?
- Alright, spoons and forks
are used to enjoy food,
to take bites,
we're not taking bites.
We're taking one bite.
- (PvF) The one side dish
that reigns supreme
is the adobo rice seasoned with
Filipino adobo seasoning,
vinegar, garlic, bay leaves, soy sauce
and tiny bits of savory pork.
- This is a ton!
This one might get me, dude.
We're on level three right now?
- (PvF) How are you
gonna do this?
(Jillian laughs)
Ooh, hair's going up.
- I gotta use some math right here.
- What math are you using,
calculus?
- (laughs) This is not
gonna work.
- This stuff is super dense.
- I think my strategy is just
to get it as small as possible.
- Ugh, I was like touching
my forehead earlier,
there's like all this
sweat here now.
- (PvF) Oh.
- Yeah.
- I was just seeing if I could
fit that whole, I could do this.
- I don't know if you can see it.
- It's tough, huh?
- Yeah, this rice is shaking.
- (Sharon) You're already shaking!
- One bite Bennie.
- Yeah, but it wasn't
with like bowls of rice, yo.
- I'm really just thinking to myself
how am I gonna fit all of this?
- I'm gonna pull my cheek open
and shove that [censored] in.
- (PvF) Three, two, one.
- Mmm!
- (PvF) And time!
And time, show me
your hands.
And time.
Oh, I think Jayse gets
the full point!
- I will give you each a half point.
(bell rings)
- Yes!
- (PvF) Jillian, you get
half a point, sorry.
Zaria, I don't know about...
I feel like you still have
most of it there.
(bell rings)
- Mm-hmm.
- (PvF) Yeshua, I think, 
gets a half point though.
(bell rings)
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- This is the best thing
I've had so far.
(PvF laughs)
- This is really good.
- Mmm!
- (child) The cheesiest,
meatiest.
- Woah!
- Oh!
- Spaghet.
- I love my Jollibee spaghetti, yo!
- Yeah, Jolli spaghetti!
- I'm just waiting for him
to realize.
- They can't be happy,
they can't be that
happy about spaghetti,
and I'm not happy
about spaghetti.
I'm usually happy
about spaghetti!
- I feel like this is
totally a TikTok.
- It's a serving!
- Dude, Jollibee continues to make ads
that make me just wanna be there.
Oh my God, that's...
- See?
- What?
- (Sharon) See?
- (PvF) This is the kids portion.
- Just so you all can see
how much is in here,
like, there's a lot.
- (PvF) Made with the iconic
banana ketchup,
Jollibee's Filipino spaghetti
is a hearty and comforting dish
that might be pretty messy
to eat in four seconds.
- This is the kids portion?
- (PvF) Yes.
- Damn!
- That's a hungry kid.
- Oh my, the weight on this!
- I mean, there's some 
girth to that.
- I probably do need
a beard bib as well,
or to just shave my
terrible beard, but...
(Jillian laughs)
- My spirit's down.
- I'm trying to think,
like, there's no other way
besides just clawing it.
- Maybe it's like a toss back.
No no no, no, 
not happening.
- Ugh.
This is making me gag.
- Hello?
Okay.
- What are you doing?
- Exactly, what, how do you
have it all in one hand?
- Ugh!
How am I gonna get this
in my mouth in four seconds?
- (PvF) Three, two, one.
(spaghetti squelches)
And time.
- Mm!
- (PvF) And time.
Time!
Wow.
I'm gonna give you each
a half point.
- Mm-hmm!
- (PvF) Jillian will get
half a point too.
(bell rings)
- Mm.
- (PvF) Jayse, half a point.
(bell rings)
- I'm literally shoving my hands
in my mouth.
- (PvF) I'm gonna give Yeshua
3/4 of a point.
- This is tragic,
it's everywhere. (laughs)
- I feel like I was pushing
neverending noodles into my mouth,
and it was going nowhere.
- I'm over here hesitating,
and then I look at him,
and he's like...
- (narrator) Hang on,
there's more joy...
- Yes, I love fried chicken!
- Yum!
- Oh, what, bro?
- (narrator) Creamy, delicious
mashed potatoes.
- I also love mashed potato.
- Mashed potato!
- It's gonna be mashed potatoes
and gravy,
and a piece of fried chicken
in five seconds.
- This is the type of food
you're supposed to enjoy!
- That's a lot.
- It's the entire freaking meal.
- I swear to God,
Jollibee killing it. (gasps)
- (PvF) Known simply
as Chicken Joy,
because that's what
it makes you feel,
Jollibee's fried chicken
marinade is top secret,
and every order comes with
a side of gravy.
We've also included
a side of mashed potatoes,
to up the ante.
- Yeah, 100% I can get those
chicken tenders in my mouth,
without question.
The addition of the mashed 
potatoes as well, just makes,
logistically, it just creates problems.
- Go ahead.
Go ahead with what?
- Go ahead.
- I'm ready.
- What are you talking about?
- Do I get a spoon,
can I get a spoon?
- (PvF) You can have a spoon.
- It's called your hand, man.
- (laughs) You're...
- I've seen other people do this,
and I feel like this is the strategy.
- Yeah, so I'm going for a 
one one thousand, two one thousand,
three one thousand,
four one thousand,
five one thousand?
- Alright.
- (PvF) Jillian like makes the cutest...
- It's like a little sundae,
you know?
Like a little banana split.
- Alright.
- Oh my God.
Okay, wait.
Every time I look over,
I second guess myself.
- You ready, you ready?
- I'm about near throw up.
- Okay, five seconds, right?
- (PvF) Mm-hmm.
Three, two, one.
- Mm!
- (PvF) Time.
Time.
- Ah!
- (PvF) And time.
Sharon gets the point,
Benison gets a half point.
- No!
- (PvF) Yeshua gets a full point.
(bell rings)
Jayse gets the full point!
Jillian, half point.
That's a half point, Zaria.
- Mm-mm.
- You know what that tastes like?
Victory!
(Benison laughs)
- (narrator) This is your sign
to eat Palabok at Jollibee.
- Palabok, wow!
- Ooh yeah!
- What, bro?
- Yeah, the noodles are tough.
- I don't think I've ever
gotten a full point on noodles.
- Mmm!
- This is also very heavy.
- (PvF) Palabok Fiesta
is a traditional Filipino noodle dish,
covered in garlic sauce,
pork, shrimp, and egg.
- Oh, [censored].
- Even to put half of that
in your mouth, like...
- Why am I even using
a fork at this point,
you know what I mean?
I learned from my last round.
You just gotta go all hands, baby!
- Woah! (laughs)
Yay!
- Dawg, what?
- No, I'm not, I don't think
this is gonna be one that I do.
- No no, don't speak like that,
what are you talking about?
- You're right.
- I think sometimes I underestimate
how long six seconds actually is.
- (PvF) Like you have a little...
- Ah!
- (PvF) Food baby!
- Ah!
- Okay, I can do this.
- I'm gonna do what I did
with the spaghetti,
kind of like initiate, 
you know, at an angle,
and then just back up,
and then just dump truck it.
- Dude, I feel like this is gonna be
another one of those
stuck in time, 
never ending noodle situations.
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's just do this.
- Okay.
- (PvF) Three, two, one.
(noodles squelching)
And time.
And time.
Time.
- Hey!
- (PvF) So we'll do 
half a point, Sharon,
3/4 of a point, Benison.
(bell rings)
- Let's go!
- Mm-hmm.
- (PvF) Yeshua, half a point,
Zaria, you can have a quarter point.
- Nice, you get a quarter.
- (PvF) Yep, half point
for each of you.
(Zaria sighs)
- That was disgusting feeling.
- (PvF) Congratulations, Jayse!
♪ (triumphant fanfare) ♪
With five points,
you have beat both 
Yeshua and Sharon!
- Yes! (laughs)
- (PvF) And earned yourself
this Get Out Of Punishment Free card!
- Yes!
- (PvF) Here you go!
You wanna hold it?
(laughs)
- Look at, bloop!
(laughs)
- I was wondering when
you were gonna pull it out!
- All I feel is garlic,
and all I taste is garlic.
- Mm-hmm.
- Usually you only taste garlic,
but somehow I could feel the garlic.
- (PvF) This is your first 
time doing this, and you won,
and you beat literally
the two greats on our channel.
- Yeah.
- I feel like that's gonna
cause some hate for me,
so I didn't mean to,
I'm sorry, internet.
I didn't mean to beat Sharon!
- Beat Sharon,
he beat Sharon.
- We just love Jollibee.
I just love Jollibee so much.
- We love Jollibee.
- Once I tried that peach mango pie,
it was just all over.
