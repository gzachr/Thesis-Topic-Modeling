Stop recording.
We're at Jollibee in Cerritos.
Founded in 1978, Jollibee is a chain of popular Filipino fast food restaurants dubbed as Asia's answer to McDonalds.
There are currently 34 locations in the United States,
and Jollibee is often endorsed by American celebrities.
[Jon Barr] I think it's a good value, and I'm not shocked this place is so crowded.
It's two o'clock right now on a Tuesday. You can barely get a table here.
Today will be our first time eating at a Jollibee.
Their menu includes American influenced dishes specializing in burgers, spaghetti, and fried chicken.
The employee is telling us what's popular here.
...and the Yum Burger over there.
These Chicken Dippers look good.  We'll order one too.
And a cup of Pineapple Cruncher.
I'm going to try some pineapple juice.
[Brother] It tastes like apple juice.
[Brother] It tastes like apple juice.
It doesn't, Brother. It tastes like pineapple.
Our food have arrived. Let me show you what we ordered.
There's spaghetti with two pieces of chicken.
And a bucket of chicken.
And a burger.
And bunch of sides.
We're going to divide up the food so we could sample a little bit of everything.
First I'm going to try the spaghetti.
It's sweeter than the regular spaghetti.
I'm going to taste the fried chicken.
It's juicy, and the skin is really crunchy.
Brother, how did you like your food?
[Brother] Good.
Now I'm going to try a Yum Burger.
This tastes a little bit like White Castle burger.
Now I'm going to try a Chicken Dipper.
It tastes like chicken.

We had a yummy time here.
