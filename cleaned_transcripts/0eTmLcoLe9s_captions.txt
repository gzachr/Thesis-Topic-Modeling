hello it is me again it is ena francia for 
everyone who is new to this channel i make videos  
about vietnamese culture vietnamese food overseas 
filipino worker lifestyles apartment hunting and  
all my misfortunes here in vietnam today is 
january and year of the tiger and speaking  
of new year vietnam will celebrate its annual Tết 
holiday to end what is Tết you ask Tết is celebrated  
to welcome lunar new year it is considered 
as the most important celebration in vietnam  
so if you are a tourist slash a future tourist 
maybe next year maybe this year if you are up  
for that celebration you are okay with celebrating 
with this tons of people it is the perfect time to  
visit vietnam but if you want a more relaxed 
visit you might want to take note of that  
and avoid those dates it is usually happening on 
the last week of january until the first week of  
february and with that celebration it is also a 
perfect holiday to wear an oei or aozai i'm sure  
i'm not correctly pronouncing it but basically 
it's a traditional vietnamese dress of course i  
want to wear one for this coming tent so for today 
that is my mission an oi hunting type of vlog i  
will be using the accent aoi for the sake that i 
am here in the south oh my god i didn't say this  
but for everyone who is new to this channel i am 
here in ho chi minh city i am a 3d artist i have  
been working here in saigon for almost three years 
now it's gonna be three years but anyway let's go  
back to aoi it is widely used by vietnamese people 
during weddings during even at schools etc etc  
special events and what i like about it is that 
it is accessible for all for all ages for women  
for men or for kids even for foreigners so you are 
very much welcome to wear one if you're gonna be  
visiting vietnam if you are here for tourism i 
highly recommend you guys to try one or if you  
are a vietnamese you already know about this that 
everyone is welcome to wear one so where i might  
be getting an oei there are multiple options to 
get one if you want to get it as a souvenir you  
can buy a ready-to-wear away and these shops are 
also offering tailor-made audis and another option  
is by renting which is i'm gonna be doing today 
as i told you i already have my own aoi so i don't  
really need a souvenir anymore if you want to know 
more about oei or if you are a foreigner who's  
looking for a perfect oei or if you are a local or 
a vietnamese also looking for an oya for a special  
occasion this video is for you okay so don't get 
too excited y'all guys here are some reminders  
here are my guidelines before jumping into finding 
an away so firstly research the design that you  
want will it be plain will it be floral a design 
with pattern do you want a bright color or do you  
want pastel aoya has a wide range of designs so 
you might want to settle on that first next one  
is deciding also the style do you want it long 
sleeves there are also three forts you also see  
yourself wearing a skirt or you want a long pants 
and thirdly is to know your body measurements  
specifically your bust your waist and your height 
also fourth one is if you want an accessory like a  
headdress so here are some options like the nonla 
a headband this one is the one that i am curious  
about and there are many more options and another 
accessories would be bags like you might want to  
take note the shoes and bags that you already have 
if you're buying another accessory it's up to you  
and my last tip is very specific to girls it's 
up to you guys boys if you want to take this tip  
i highly suggest to wear a tight fitted 
undergarments because you know it's  
it's tight to be honest it's gonna embrace your 
body you'll know when you wear one okay so a bonus  
tip guys is also where the shoes that you'll be 
wearing if you already have one i highly suggest  
at least two to three inches of heels so you 
might also want to wear that when fitting so  
that's the five tips it's gonna save you time and 
it's gonna save you troubling vietnamese people  
anyway i already researched the perfect shop 
for me its name is aoya han okay so i think i  
i'm scared but i'm excited please 
don't talk about me when i'm gone
don't they already picked but it turns out i have  
to look for myself or i don't 
know if they will help me
what
so i already chose five 
reis i'm gonna beat them now  
okay welcome to an away fitting session with 
me let's start this aoya session with a bang  
a fiery red peacock designed liai red color 
is also used for wedding ceremonies by bride  
in the grooms if you are a guest better choose a 
different color if you are attending one red oei  
is born during tet for luck and prosperity if you 
want to be lucky for the whole year this aoi is  
for you let's just say you can never go wrong with 
red ho ho ho if you are up for a bolder design  
this mandela slash a red ish ao dai is your choice 
i mean look look at that look at this fabric  
this is not your typical oei and wait for it i've 
got a ribbon oh yeah she is thriving the epitome  
of modern art meets classic traditional vietnamese 
dress surely this aoya will turn some heads with  
its unique prints and patterns do we need to talk 
about how fit and how this oya makes me think that  
i urgently meet hitting the gym next week this 
pastel pink aui with koi fish and purple lotus  
flower is a symbol for strength and growth you 
can also use a nonla a traditional vietnamese  
hat color indicates age and status lighter color 
means youthfulness and purity while married women  
usually wear richer and darker colors this oei 
is slightly small for my preference piece of  
advice choose a no yay that is comfortable and 
makes you confident alrighty if this blue au yai  
is not screaming lazada for you well you haven't 
tried online shopping in asia if you are not  
used to wearing long sleeves give it a go for the 
street force away but the fun is not stopping them  
you can change the pants into skirt if you want a 
more girly vibes check the oya's dominant colors  
from there you can decide the color that you 
can use for your pants with this outfit i use  
the golden color this becomes a totally new outfit 
something out from a feminine hygiene commercial  
this outfit will perfectly match your taste 
okay this is the lasso yai and i must tell you  
that the gold patterns in this bright yellow oya 
means long life and double happiness so this oya  
is a bit loose on my waist but no need to 
worry guys since our eye shops can fix this  
if you want an accent you can match any aoi 
with a headband now that completes a vietnamese  
dress there makes the outfit interesting 
and reflects the symbol for happiness  
so i just got back from ao yaihan it looks easy 
when you squeeze a 2r fitting session into few  
minutes of edit i will message ao han for the next 
coming days i am still actually undecided with all  
the signs with all the callers i am so overwhelmed 
after all that struggles after all that perspiring  
moment or which aoi did you like or which 
oei do you like me to wear this coming tent  
and if you buy one for yourself what things do you 
want to consider will it be the color will it be  
the design do you want a fit away or do you want 
a loose one if you are here in vietnam if you'll  
be visiting vietnam i highly suggest that you try 
wearing one did i miss anything about oyai what's  
special about it if you are a vietnamese if you 
know anything any information fun fact about aoyai  
let us know guys in the comment section 
we would love to know about that i hope

future oei for your next travel for your next
