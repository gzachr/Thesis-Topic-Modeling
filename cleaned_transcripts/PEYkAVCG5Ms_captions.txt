hey everyone welcome to Pai's kitchen today i'm 
going to share with you another version of  
filipino adobo so a while ago I posted my original 
chicken adobo and many of you have told me about a  
variation that you guys like to make in your 
families now two of those really stood out  
to me that's adobo with coconut milk and adobo 
with pineapple and I thought hmm pineapple and  
coconut milk go really well together already 
so what I would both of those in my adobo and  
I tried it and it is fantastic I'm pairing it 
with pork belly which goes so well that fatty  
tenderness goes really well with pineapple so 
I'm super excited to share it with you let's  
get started so I've got some pork belly here 
that I've cut into big cubes and remember this  
will shrink quite a bit so make sure it's bigger 
than you want it to be at the end I'm gonna start  
by just searing these just so they get the nice 
browning develop some flavor around the pork just  
a little bit of oil the porks gonna render out a 
lot of fat on its own but I like to add some oil  
just to get it started there you go you want 
to hear that sizzling sound and depending on  
the size of your pot or how much you're making 
you might need to do this in a few batches you  
don't want to crowd this because the minute 
you overcrowd the pot you're not gonna get  
browning because it's gonna tap trapped too 
much steam oh yes nice and brown like that
hmm so I've got my Park done up here it's really 
smelling really good now in my pot here I have  
browned pork yumminess if you feel like this is 
too much pork fat you can definitely get rid of  
it and I'm gonna sear my onion nuts here saute 
my onions with it and I just want to cook these  
until they're nice and translucent and they're 
just gonna go in with a pinch of salt because  
the salt helps draw out the liquid from the 
onions and they soften faster once there's a  
little bit of salt in it my garlic lots of garlic 
give that a minute to infuse and now I'm going to  
deglaze this whole thing with coconut milk oh 
yes and as you can see it's picking up all that  
browned goodness around the pot mmm like grilled 
pork flavor going in now with soy sauce I'm using  
Filipino soy sauce for this to stick with the 
theme but you can definitely use Japanese soy  
sauce for this like the Kikkoman would work Thai 
soy sauce a little lights for adobo so I would not  
use that and now adobo is all about the salty and 
sour balance so I'm going to add vinegar this is  
Filipino cane vinegar which tends to be a little 
smoother and milder than white vinegar you can  
use white vinegar maybe he was a little less 
and just see where it's at rice vinegar would  
work try apple cider vinegar maybe and this is 
the Filipino vinegar so this is the brand and  
that is what you want to look for right there on 
the back it does say cane vinegar now I'm gonna  
add couple bay leaves for some flavor lift those 
infuse in there and lots of black pepper there's  
no chilies in here but you want a little bit of 
heat from black pepper that gravy just looks so  
good already now the pork is gonna go in try not 
to splatter the juices all over yourself and now  
I'm gonna add just a little bit of water just 
so I have enough liquid to barely cover the pork
so I'm gonna let this simmer gently we don't 
want it vigorously boiling for about an hour  
and a half to two hours you want fork tenderness 
so at an hour and a half maybe give it a check I'm  
also going to keep it covered so I don't lose 
all my liquid and now I know you're wondering  
where's the pineapple she was so excited about 
well pineapple coming right up I am using fresh  
pineapple fresh ripe pineapple and it's really 
important if you're one of those people who are  
like I don't do pineapple and savory food no 
Hawaiian pizza for me I hear you but trust me  
all the pineapple you've ever had on Hawaii pizza 
is our canned and it makes a huge difference when  
it's fresh it's not as sweet it's nice and tart 
it doesn't clash with savory foods so give this  
one a try okay so I've got a pan here that just 
has a little bit of oil on it and I'm just gonna  
put the piece of pineapple down just it can 
be my heat pester all right this little guy  
is bubbling I'm gonna add the rest and I'm not 
what I'm not pouring it because I know I have  
collective juice at the bottom of the bowl which 
I don't want to add I'm telling you if you just  
saute some pineapple caramelize some pineapple 
in butter put that over ice cream that's all  
you need so delicious now don't touch it until 
they've developed browning on the bottom don't  
be stirring it because you don't get browning 
if you keep stirring it all right all right I'm  
seeing some browning at the bottom of my pieces 
just gonna give it a quick stir look at that  
that looks good now depending on the amount of 
effort you're willing to put into this you can  
sit there and individually you flip all of them 
so you get both sides seared or you can just call  
it a day and be done with it that's up to you 
all right and I think I am happy with that OOP  
now I'm just gonna go relax for a little bit oh 
look at that veggies looks so good so this took  
me about an hour and a half and about halfway 
through I left the lid a jar because I wanted  
the liquids we evaporate until I have about this 
much so just keep an eye on sort of the level of  
liquid and even if it's gone too far you can just 
add a little bit of water back it now there's only  
one more thing to do and that is to stir in 
our sautéed pineapple for all the collective  
juice that's all flavor you don't want to cook 
the pineapple to death I just like to give it  
another like five minutes to to allow the flavors 
to exchange and mingle now make sure you taste it  
to taste it don't forget taste the sauce and 
adjust oh it's perfect you want a balance of  
salty and sour a touch of creamy sweetness from 
the pineapple and the coconut milk perfect now  
as an option you can add some fresh cilantro 
or green onions just so you know for fishing  
giggles yes now this being pork belly there is 
a lot of fat that is part of the sauce if that  
concerns you you can let it sit overnight and the 
fat will solidify on top and you can scrape that  
off but it doesn't concern me oh look so good so 
tender I can just pull that apart with my fork I  
gotta get that fatty bit piece of pineapple some 
rice that pineapple is the best thing that fatty  
piece of pork could ask for that top layer of 
the pork belly the skin and the fat it's like  
soft and juicy and tender it just goes so well 
with the tart fresh pineapple I mean these two  
things are just complement each other incredibly 
well the flavor is just a perfect balance of tart  
and salty a touch of sweet oh man I have to say 
like I do prefer this one to my chicken adobo  
one like that's a legit recipe in its own right 
but this kind of just takes the whole thing to  
the next level so I definitely encourage you to 
give it a go and let me know what you think and
