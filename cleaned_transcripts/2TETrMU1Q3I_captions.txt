hi everyone Welcome to our series on Could I live 
here today we're doing Camotes islands in the  
Philippines Camotes actually means sweet potato 
and we did actually find some yeah and there's  
actually two islands two separate islands with 
with a Causeway that was actually built by the  
Spanish yeah and it's about 20 km by 10 km it's a 
very small place it's like two round balls oh wow  
uhuh they have one main town uh San Francisco and 
then there's Poro and Consuello yeah with the port  
with a climate of 30° year round it's the perfect 
place if you're a digital nomad or looking for  
somewhere to live vlog a l yeah yeah doing some 
editing wait doing some editing can we go get  
lunch yeah let's go eat something uhhuh L retire 
to the Philippines watch the space there is a lot  
of short-term holiday accommodation at the beaches 
but the only long-term stuff we saw was actually  
it's going to be in the town there's not a lot 
of selfcatering we could barbecue but we could  
probably ask them for use of a kitchen however 
good news for you guys who are thinking of living  
there permanently and buying a place it looks 
like they're building some condos and some some  
beautiful looking Villers oh wow we didn't see 
what the price was like 10,000 Pesos to secure I  
think also everyone everyone is selling land there 
I don't know what the legalities of it but you can  
buy land from 500 pesos a square meter all the 
way up to 11 million for 5,000 square m beautiful  
place though how's that cliff wow people actually 
jump off it not us not us and then I don't know  
if you can do long-term accommodation in a tent 
but there are tents I don't know if we need can C  
onto the cost of living it's all about the money 
just they really don't rip you off they don't  
everywhere is the same price locals and tourists 
are paying the same and it's reasonable from that  
one cave yeah we we found that a bit expensive 
well we like to stick to our budget of $50 a  
day and here we actually spent Riki about $35 
a day because including accommodation including  
accommodation both of us as it comes to food you 
can save a lot because the food isn't expensive  
you can eat out a lot breakfast is 75 if you get 
the breakfast special you can actually get an 85  
meal but mostly they're going to cost you between 
150 and 200 for a good dinner yeah and beers are  
like just over 100 yeah they and they the same 
price everywhere so whether you buy it on the  
beach front or at the Sari sari it's practically 
the same price onto the price of the accommodation  
on on the beach we paid p800 for a fan room or 
p1,500 for an air conditioned room at the resorts  
they a little bit more expensive but they have the 
pool pool and a spar and another big expense is  
actually transport uh you have to hire a scooter 
which is 300 a day or take a trike which is 300  
uh one way yeah but we'll talk more about that in 
our transportation we found some options to save  
you money what about getting there and getting 
around well getting there there's a ferry from  
Danao which leaves at like 5 :30 in the morning 
but they have it like every 3 or 4 hours all the  
way up until about 8:30 at night I think yeah also 
they've got the new Mactan one so straight from  
the airport you're on the island 1 and 1 half 
hours later but they only leave twice on the  
weekends and once during the week I think there's 
a Cebu one I think twice a day or something well  
there you go I forgot to tell you guys the the 
price yeah the ferries are like I think it's  
650 from the Mactan one the now is 330 for the 
air conditioned or 300 take the a take the air  
condition it's comfy comfy chairs public transport 
oh man there isn't not in Camotes not in Camotes  
guys sorry about that there are trikes but they'll 
take you but they're individual trikes they are  
jeepney but it's a it's a catered the whole thing 
you have to rent the whole thing the best option  
the best option is to get yourself a scooter 
you either hire it longterm or buy it p45,000  
yeah it's aome I didn't think of it but you can 
actually buy a car we did see some for sale but  
we didn't see what the price was we weren't 
even thinking that we were thinking scooters  
so yeah you could probably get a car as well if 
that that or you could bring one across from the  
mainland actually you can bring almost anything 
across from the mainland on the ferry yeah yeah  
yeah you can just bring they bring buses over they 
bring all buses they bring they bring tankers they  
bring everything oh yeah sometimes we forget the 
obvious yeah yeah well there you go guys you can  
come buy one in Cebu will drive it back come on 
break over let's go yeah we were just saying if  
there's a storm or something the ferries do stop 
so are dependent on the weather it didn't happen  
that often but since we've been in the Philippines 
they've stopped twice in 3 months in 3 months on  
a positive on the island it didn't seem like 
parking was a problem yes you could park almost  
anywhere I was worried but no one else seemed to 
be do be aware there are some bad roads there are  
some fantastic roads the new roads are perfect but 
some of them have fallen a bit into disrepair so  
it's navigable fun Services what a lot of you are 
going to find very important things like internet  
electricity especially if you're planning to get 
digit nomad we had internet that was between 10  
and 50 depending on where we were Megs per second 
up and down mhm um and uh they had peso machines  
and they had um free Wi-Fi free Wi-Fi yes you 
you got like like actually good like 100 Megs  
and you use it and then you just resign in and 
resign in right at the beach but there's very  
little signal Elsewhere on the island apart from 
in the main Center some areas are dead absolutely  
nothing no cell signal nothing electricity we 
had 10 minutes out that the whole time we were  
there would be bad there were no fluctuations 
there was no up and down it was just straight  
electricity apart from 10 minutes when they were 
cutting some trees near a a thing and they turned  
it off as for water you're not going to worry 
about water they have the biggest fresh Lake in  
Visaya how beautiful is this Lake uh-huh yeah 
Healthcare there's hospitals and there were a  
few doctors and dentists there a lot of dentists 
here there's a big Pharmacy and I saw lots of the  
little generic pharmacies as well but then in said 
it was just yeah literally a short ferry ride away  
ATMs we were told there was only one luckily we 
discovered two others one at the Princes in San  
Francisco and then two in uh Poro but cash is a 
problem because they give you thousands and no one  
takes thousands everyone takes cash small bills a 
juggling act you have to you draw your big money  
I think the best thing is to go into the bank and 
change it all into hundreds every single one but  
there's only one bank so it's crowded but some of 
the resorts do take card so you can take your card  
and pay the resort when it comes to churches 
we saw three Ricky knows the names uh there's  
a Catholic Church obviously an old historic one 
also beautiful um a Baptist Church and a couple  
of Seventh Day Adventist when it comes to safety 
there is nothing safer than Camotes so far we we  
saw maybe three security guards in the whole time 
we were there we went to the market no one said oh  
change your backpack or be careful or any anything 
even Riki said that if you're a Solo Traveler solo  
woman traveler it's been really safe I haven't 
felt uneasy at any point everyone's always  
looking out for you and asking you are you okay 
do you need to know something it's really cool
morning and the one time we only had a 1000 note 
as we told you in the money problems and they  
said oh don't worry come back tomorrow and you'll 
pay when you get some more food so yeah they're  
very trusting as well everyone seemed occupied 
no one was asking for money there were people  
selling baked goods just just one one one Piece 
One Piece there was a guy playing guitar if you  
wanted to give some money you could mhm Camotes 
islands is not a big earthquake zone and also  
it's protected to the east with with a lot of 
the rest of the Philippines so it doesn't get  
the big Cyclones and huge storms but doesn't 
mean they don't do come through occasionally  
mhm on the island there are some landslides and 
flooding but they are demarcated and signposted  
so they're easy to see where they are yeah and 
they had tsunami evacuation places but the island  
goes up steeply so it it's probably very safe 
once you go literally 100 m in land well when  
it comes to things to do on Camotes you are in 
luck cuz there is so much stuff there's beaches  
people sit on beaches I've heard there's fishing 
love fishing there's scuba diving I mean amazing  
diving crystal crystal clear waters snorkeling 
snorkeling of course if there's diving there's  
snorkeling there's all those caves there's you 
can go explore a cave spelunking they new caves  
to be discovered and bird watching bird watching 
many birds yeah someone actually said it's a great  
find the kingish they never seen that before 
that is pretty awesome yeah and then there's a  
lot of history with abandoned places there are 
quite a few abandoned buildings that you can  
go and explore and and treasure hunting yeah yeah 
apparently the Japanese brought a lot of treasure  
look it up look it up look it up I know where I'm 
I know where I'm looking for so don't go look at  
my spot actually I'm not telling you so that's 
okay uh hiking hiking yes oh and walking around  
the lake don't forget about that that's beautiful 
loads of private white beaches absolutely tons of  
them you find your own while you kayaking oh 
there kayaking we didn't even nice segway Rick  
you're the winner today there are however no malls 
no Cinemas no golf courses not even 10 Pin bowling  
onto the foods there's quite a lot of selection 
although is pretty similar yeah there's no Thai  
there's no sushi there's no Indian Italian there 
a little bit of pasta no Mexican but there is a  
lot of Filipino foods and some great choices and 
weirdly fries I don't know what the big deal is  
these are just fries with a straw in them oh wait 
a second you're drinking the it's it's mango juice  
below and wait for it fries on top no oh really 
good fries M no like it's like she put the fries  
into the juice separate cup though I see you look 
at that how is that not a thing that is a thing  
oh these chips are so good really good chips in 
the Camotes that's a reason to come there's some  
great Keras caraderas please correct me on how you 
say where you get homecooked meals really great  
they're fantastic Foods super great belly and if 
you want to cook at all you probably just get it  
to make a whole bunch and you put in your freezer 
I think that would be the best I rediscovered my  
love for Soups here they got amazing soup and and 
a lot of fish dishes yeah fish and that fish soup  
was just one of my favorites but fish on a grill 
can you do better yeah but it's a fishing island  
so your Seafood is going to be awesomely fresh 
but that said they're Fried Chicken oh great  
Fried Chicken all thumbs up yeah yeah and there's 
no chains there no chains but you can get what you  
want the burgers they fries are they are but not 
your familiar you need to go to sa you have to go  
to Cebu yeah everything's open with a great view 
there's no AC you're not stuck in a room with AC  
you've got fans and things so it is cool and the 
air breezes nice one Riki and a lot of the time  
where you sitting they're cooking right behind you 
so you're eating fresh fresh fresh well there is  
some shopping and there Prince's Supermarket it's 
actually a hypermarket they also have Prince's  
Town which is a supermarket and a place where 
you can buy pots and Pans store and there's a  
department store M uh Lucky 777 something like 
that and then they've got the markets the fresh  
produce markets where you get all the fruits and 
vegetables that you get everywhere all over the  
Philippines as well as fish and pork yeah Riki did 
you see chicken a little a little chicken they've  
even got some tobacco yeah you can just buy your 
tobacco roll your own cigars that's another thing  
to do learn to roll cigars don't demonetize us 
please Facebook YouTube whichever one this one's  
on when it comes to regular shopping they're Sari 
sari stores everywhere but if there's something  
you want in particular just ask the mainland is 
close someone will probably bring it and then  
the fridge will be fully stocked like it is a 
feta if you if you go to your local sari sari  
and they don't have it they'll just run across 
to another person that they know has it yeah  
and you're paying the same price they haggle the 
deal ultimately if you really want your shopping  
done there's Cebu you just catch the fairy to 
Cebu spend the night shop at SM seaside that  
has everything yeah or you could even go in the 
morning come back in the afternoon yeah you could  
actually do that so yeah you can get everything 
if you're willing to have a little trip it is an  
up and coming island but at the moment there not 
very many expats the few we saw were in the bank  
uh but there are developments and the airports 
coming in so expect big things to happen in the  
future pretty quiet when it comes to luxury there 
are a few massage or spy day treatments most of  
the resorts I'm going to say are three star at 
best but you do get like a private service at  
Mangodlong Rock yeah that was pretty cool but 
you sit and they bring you beers and food and  
stuff yeah I would know I would do that for a day 
but other than that it's there's not too much you  
can hire a boat and they go island hopping 
but it's all just Beach hopping really like  
sunset cruise or something you don't to have to 
be creative for your luxury gift you're going to  
have to come up with them yourself onto the big 
question would we live there let's deal with the  
cons first it's a slow pace of life if you're in 
any sort rush your your meals are going to take an  
hour yeah sometimes you're just going to sit down 
and you're going to wait of course another big con  
is that cash thing having to get uh One ATM two 
ATMs then having big notes and not being able to  
cut the small notes it's it is a problem other 
one is you are dependent on the ferry everything  
if the ferry stops you stop basically one of 
one of the issues is it's not very modern but I  
think if you bought a house or rented longterm you 
could modernize it yourself but the infrastructure  
around is is pretty Antiquated onto the pros it 
it is laidback it feels like Bali or Mauritius  
in the'80s for sure that's all chilled for us it 
wasn't expensive like I said we did 35 a day um I  
think if you had a long-term rental you could get 
even cheaper than that and still have a great time  
yeah everyone there is really friendly they say 
hello and they out of the way to help you out yes  
like a small and then there's the nature beautiful 
I mean untouched Beauty it doesn't get old it it  
you sit there in the palm trees and the White 
Sands and the crystal clear water and wow and  
you got trees and so and and and Lake you you you 
have the best of all worlds another big positive  
is literally an hour and a half away you got the 
big city of Cebu with everything it's a modern  
big big city but could I live here well I would 
probably need a bit of a nest egg so you could  
get a long-term lease and really get some nice 
stuff in but I think you could find the perfect  
place here I really do these are a few of the 
things that we came up with but we are open to  
suggestions always in the comments in the comments 
guys and do let us know if you are coming to the  
Philippines or planning to move here and what sort 
of place you'd like us to visit for you yeah list  
some towns you want us to go check out you're open 
to suggestions and of course if this has helped  
you out yeah buy us a coffee do appreciate it wow 
Camotes Islands well anyway everyone thanks for
