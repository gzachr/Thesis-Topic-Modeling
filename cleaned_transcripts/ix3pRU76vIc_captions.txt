What's up guys, today Nicole and I are gonna show you how to make petit casoy. Petite casoy is a filipino cashew macaroon
that's super easy to make and is ridiculously addicting.
To make petite casoy, start off by dropping in a cup or so of cashews into a food processor.
Then finely chop the cashews by pulsing the chop button a couple times.
When it's done, pull out the blade and scoop out a cups worth of the finely chopped cashews. And
then pour it into a separate mixing bowl.
Next add in 3/4 of a cup of condensed milk.
And then carefully separate and add in 2 egg yolks.
Mix all the ingredients thoroughly until they're all fully incorporated.
Afterwards you can either start preparing a mini muffin pan for your batter,
or you can add in some maraschino cherries to make them extra cute. If you decide to add in the cherries, cut each of them
in half so they aren't too big for the macaroons.
Next fill your mini muffin pan with mini baking cups.
Stir your batter a little if necessary.
Otherwise carefully start pouring in your batter into each cup.
Fill each cup about two-thirds of the way full making sure not to spill.
If you do end up spilling a little, just wipe it off. Unfortunately
We weren't able to completely fill our pan, but that's okay. Just remove the extra baking cups if you run out of batter.
Now just top off each macaron with a maraschino cherry.
Pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees and then place your petite casoy in for 20 minutes.
When they're done, you'll need to resist the temptation to eat them right away and allow them to rest for a day.
Otherwise, if you try to peel your baking cups off, your petite casoy will fall apart. But trust us. It's worth the wait!
They're talagang tasty!
