walking down to alorna beach in Bohol  
in today's video we're going to be exploring the 
absolutely beautiful Alona Beach which is located  
in Panglao in Bohol and it's known for its Lively 
atmosphere and its variety of activities that are  
on offer for all visitors we'll take you to 
explore this beautiful beach and find out if  
this is considered to be the more stunning 
beach in all of Bohol let's find out [Music]  
Beach the best beach in the hall in the 
Philippines that's debatable we did a  
little bit of research on the internet and many 
people were saying that Alona Beach is the most  
popular Beach but some people disagree and 
say that it's not the most beautiful beach  
today we're gonna find out whether we think 
it is the best beach in Bohol and we're going  
to do that by speaking to a few local people 
we're going to find out their opinion we want  
to know why they think Alona Beach is the 
best beach and we'll also try and find out  
which other Beach is equally as beautiful 
or more beautiful than Alona Beach okay
there's a few different ways you can travel 
around Bohol Island if you want to rent a  
motorbike a motorbike will cost you about 
in between 350 pesos and 500 pesos a day  
and there's a lot of tricycles on the island I'm 
gonna speak to one of the tricycle Riders now just  
to confirm the price from TAG balaranpier down 
to ilora beach just to give you an idea of how  
much you would expect to pay for the tricycle 
ride which I think is about 30 to 35 minutes  
excuse me sir hello sir is this your tricycle 
yeah yeah we're trying to find out how much  
it would cost to go to tag valarancia 
from here 500 that's brilliant okay  
and we're going to do that tomorrow oh 
okay oh I'll just take a picture [Music]  
on the way down to the beach looks like there's 
quite a lot of options available with food so for  
fast food behind me there's McDonald's and 
there's also Jollibee if you want something  
sweet across the road there is Duncan and 
there's souvenir shops there's Korean food  
um you can get a tricycle from here to any way 
that you want and then when you walk down this  
way there's a lot of people if you want a massage 
either on the way down at the beach or when you  
leave the beach you can have a massage as well 
also if you need to get some money changed there  
are a few money exchange booths here my personal 
experience I found that the rate here changing  
Euros across to pesos it wasn't the best rate we 
changed some money in the airport in Manila and  
the rate was definitely better so if you don't 
have any choice then I think the money exchange  
booths here are okay but just a little bit too I 
think we paid a little bit too much in commission
and if you feel like having a burger there's 
a great burger spot here Jack's Burger we  
had a burger there yesterday and the 
price was great not expensive at all
okay [Music] oh it would be this 
one that we would be interested in
thank you
the maximum of five people uh 1 500 okay and at 
least all five oh that's a little bit early for  
me 5 30. can I ask you a question um so we this 
is the only beach that we visited here and many  
people say that alone a beach is the best 
beach in Bohol is that true it is okay are  
there any other beaches that are as popular 
or as beautiful as this one in your opinion  
which one all of them okay okay I'm gonna take 
a picture of this if that's all right [Music]
this lady she said that all of the beaches are 
beautiful in Bohol that's probably true but we'll  
try and find out whether someone says this one's 
definitely the best or where there's a there's  
another one I think called do maluan I'm not 
sure if that's the right pronunciation but many  
people online say dumalawan is also a beautiful 
beach it might even be more beautiful than this  
hello sir yes sir can I ask you a question yeah 
we're trying to do a little bit of research and  
online many people say that Alona Beach is 
the best beach in bahal but some people say  
there's another one yeah in your opinion which 
one's best southbound is the best salsa yeah
three kilometers same long list Long Beach 
ah okay Alona is like one kilometer only here  
the beach right but the clear and uh you 
know the clean Beach is the best oh thank  
you that's really good information 
how far is that from here from here
and what time does this one leave uh we'll depart 
at 6 30. because mostly of the other people who  
want to see the dolphins and then in the morning 
a lot of dolphins we're gonna see six third is  
better the other one was 5 30 and 5 30. that's so 
early yeah yeah so dark okay thank you we'll have  
a walk on the beach and we'll have a think uh-huh 
we're making a YouTube video can we include this  
footage yes excellent thank you okay thank you 
have a nice day enjoy ment you're welcome [Music]  
thank you
this see and have a look and 
see what this is all about
one thing that we've noticed immediately after 
spending a little bit of time in the Philippines  
is the water is just a gorgeous turquoise color 
and if you've watched any other of our other  
videos you know that we've spent a lot of time 
in Thailand and we absolutely love Thai beaches  
but I must admit the water in the Philippines 
it seems to be clearer in general and whether  
it's a sunny day or a cloudy day sometimes on a 
cloudy day the water doesn't look as clear but  
that doesn't seem to be the case here the water 
is just constantly turquoise so I actually think  
the Philippines definitely gives Thailand 
a lot of competition in relation to beaches  
but there seems to be quite a busy Beach as 
well it attracts a lot of people and I can see  
why because there's a lot of restaurants on the 
beach and there's so much Choice with food then  
obviously you've got the diving centers you've 
got the laundry you've got this gorgeous Beach  
here and there's also quite a few boats that 
are parked up on the beach so it looks like  
there's an island hopping tour that leaves 
from here at 6 30 in the morning and you can  
possibly spot Dolphins you can spot Turtles you 
can also do a little bit of snorkeling and that  
lasts from 6 30 until 12 p.m and the price for 
that we've been quoted if you want to go with a  
group it's 1 500 pesos per person but we were 
offered a discount and for two of us it would  
be 1 250 pesos per person which is quite a good 
price that doesn't include any food I think it  
includes water but there's a stop on an island 
and you can buy some food when you get there
[Music]
and it looks like there's quite a lot of 
options available with water sports so  
there's some kayaks here and there's also some 
paddle boards but look at this these are cool  
there's some kayaks here and I've never seen 
kayaks like these before these are clear so  
that would be interesting so obviously this 
is a good spot for diving but there must be a  
lot of sea life here so if you get into one of 
these kayaks because it's clear hopefully you  
can see a lot of fish underneath I wonder 
how much that costs I'm gonna ask this guy
okay thank you
500 for one hour I always translate 
everything into Thai bot which is strange  
um you would think that I would change it 
into British pounds because I'm from the  
UK but after being in Thailand for so 
many years whenever I get a price now  
changed into Thai ball so yeah that's okay we 
might do that see if we've got time [Music]  
if you do want to witness a great Sunset 
while you're in Behold a Lorna Beach might  
be a good choice however it's not entirely 
on the west coast so the sun doesn't set  
exactly on the beach but the colors in 
the sky are enjoyable and the atmosphere  
is really Pleasant so is elorna Beach the 
best beach in the hall it seems to be the  
case locals seem to think that this is 
definitely the most popular Beach on the  
island with a couple of competitors thanks for 
watching and we'll see you in the next video
come on
[Music]
