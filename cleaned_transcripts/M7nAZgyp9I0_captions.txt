it's Christmas time in the city
all right good morning everybody so it
is 3:30 in the morning here in Cebu City
and the reason why I am awake right now
is because I will be partaking in the
tradition of Simba gabi today Simba
Gabi is a nine day tradition the nine
days leading up to Christmas everybody
wakes up at like 3:30 in the morning and
goes to four o'clock mass yeah for en so
since I'm here I figured that's what I'd
do
I'm gonna go check it out at the closest
church nearby so let's go let's go check
it out see what it's all about little
wrinkled but that's okay
I've had this outfit in my suitcase for
almost two months
and I've yet to break it out
okay so the church that I'm going to is
the st. Joseph patriarch church I chose
this church because it's closest to my
hotel obviously and it's very beautiful
there's a lot of beautiful churches here
in the Philippines
I give these guys a lot of credit for
waking up this early it was hard for me
to wake up
a lot of people lots of
packed house
I just went to an entire mass I think my
mom would be proud of me I went to
an entire mass willingly
everybody just pours out onto the street
that's pretty cool
I've never seen that many people packed
into a church before that's for sure
pretty good turnout sun's starting to
come up here slowly I'm gonna go take a
nap very happy that I could be part of
this I didn't go all 9 mornings but I
just can say that I went once
I found snow!
pink earmuffs and gloves is the last
thing I thought I would buy in the
Philippines
I am now at ayala center in the heart
of Cebu I came here to check out the
beautiful Christmas lights because when
you think of Christmas of course you
think about the lights
the food eating contest!
one day and 30 seconds down our our record
is four minutes that's good that's good
clean fun right there good clean fun I
just won this necklace cuz I brought him
a camera son
really intense
I think it's so cool how popular
Christmas is here in the Philippines
Filipinos definitely celebrate Christmas
like no one else in the world I think
it's great that I get to celebrate my
Christmas this year here and say boo I
wouldn't have it any other way
Merry Christmas everyone happy holidays
I don't know what's happening what is
going on 5:00 in the morning its a parade
there's just a parade at 5:00 a.m.
there's a random parade right outside
I'm gonna go back to sleep
