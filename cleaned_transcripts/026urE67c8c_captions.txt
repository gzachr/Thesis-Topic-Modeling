Hello, you're a taxi? i want to 
go to a dolomite beach how much  
do you think how much i pay how much 
is the price 100 150 150 okay hello  
i sit in here all right ah that looks rather 
small ah welcome back to manila guys i'm on the  
way to the beach there's a beach here in manila as 
well and it's about sunset time in like one hour  
so i hope we can see a happening 
place the sunset and i found this
taxi pretty interesting so it's a 
little bit small for me but that's okay
let's have a
look exactly how do you call this 
how do you call this name nice game  
bicycle ah they call it tricycle here okay
not sure why he wanted to show me that but okay
ah that's actually a fun way but um here 
on one meter 90 tall not really made for a  
smaller sized vehicle right like this but it's 
fun let's see if we can have a look out there oh  
all right this is actually uh kind of enjoyable 
and i think the beach is uh right over there  
so it's actually not far from the beach 
check it out they even have horses here
uh here yes okay yeah that comes like the main 
entrance okay and we can come here somewhere
i think they have a lot of different form of 
transportations here tricycles i saw cookbooks  
before we have the jeepneys uh like a public bus 
we have motorbike taxis regular taxis ah okay  
okay salamat he's my friend this is your friend  
all right hello hello you're a 
horse here oh okay horse riding yeah
but not today i want to go to the beach  
uh 1 50. okay bye-bye okay okay we have drinks 
here hello hello okay so i have to concentrate  
i'm a little bit overwhelmed with all the 
impressions and people talking to me and it's  
beautiful here but that's what i'm here for i'm 
very excited but yeah let's walk over the bridge
and then have a look what's going on at the 
beach oh wow that looks awesome here yes i think  
we will have a nice sunset today and also so far 
there's no rain and i don't see any cloud around
oh yes we have a lot of food stalls here oh 
i think i saw these balls before but i never  
tried them hello yummy it's a crack crack yes 
something like that what is it huh well what is  
it no but uh is it it's egg ah yes egg egg okay i 
would like to get one one more yeah one place one  
i think it's a eggs inside here and then 
they fry it with some flour around it
sauce
the sauce is really good yeah masada masala
i think she's heating it up here again  
so putting it into the oil for a short 
amount of time just to make it hot again
hello
okay
thank you spicy so you have different sauce 
here yes which house is the best spicy  
what you like do you like spicy this one's sweet 
this one is sweet oh yeah okay that sounds better  
oh okay sweet sweet okay okay thank you very 
much okay um yeah i will try it here i will  
try it right here hello okay so we have these 
little bolts here come on actually they are ah  
i expected them to be very soft but they are 
actually quite hard okay first time trying this
it's an interesting combination 
because the outside is sweet or  
maybe that's also because of the 
sauce and then inside is an egg
oh you also had this one 
cucumber i can add two yeah
cucumber yes i like so we have 
an interesting mixture now of  
these eggs the recommended 
sauce and some cucumbers
very good
thank you
i guess it's easier to eat your cucumbers
i really like the sauce the sauce 
is very good i like the sauce
one more again one more nut now how do i go to 
the beach where's the entrance here over here  
okay okay salamat thank you very much thank you 
very much oh yeah ah no thank you don't wanna  
have a horse ride thank you very much okay okay 
i will take this to the beach now but i'm also  
looking for some drinks actually but a little 
bit more than just a water i think we can  
oh it says exit only here excuse me can i 
enter here here over there okay thank you  
oh entrance this way okay this is only the 
exit here yeah it looks like a happening place
i need to outside okay i will eat outside 
okay i can't take the food inside so i will  
eat it here first and then we go 
over there or it looks like a very  
clean and nice beach actually oh yeah let me 
finish this and then we have a proper look inside  
okay actually that was a really nice 
snack these little balls with eggs inside  
really delicious so this was definitely not 
the last time i ate them i think and wow  
i am really impressed to see a beautiful and 
clean beach like this here didn't expect a  
place like this to be in manila like obviously 
philippines are very famous for their beaches  
but i didn't thought but there's 
also a beach in manila itself
all right i noticed one thing now is and inside 
the beach area there are no stalls to uh buy food  
or drinks so i should have bought something to 
drink outside but then again you're not allowed to  
bring it inside so that's a little bit not ideal i 
would say it would be nice if there would be some  
you know some beach bars here some stalls where 
you can buy food and drinks inside or while being  
at the beach but i guess they don't allow that to 
keep the area clean i mean the airway here looks  
super super clean which is obviously a good thing 
hello you want to take a picture yeah okay okay
we want selfie you can take a picture
you can sit and i'm the same size
are you from manila
from cebu are you a tourist here yeah oh 
okay okay have a good day enjoy it bye-bye
you want picture too okay okay my uh  
my pen lie i wanted to say thai i don't 
know how to say no problem in filipino

oh i don't know that but not from manila okay
okay okay have a good day bye bye
okay you want a picture as well
you don't see many foreigners here 
normally foreigners don't come here

the only foreigner around here
and i make videos about manila 
yes i make youtube videos
oh so many pictures
yeah my first first time in 
the philippines go picture
thank you so much okay okay i have a 
question uh inside here no no drinks
why not to uh to make make it more clean yeah
but if i if i buy the water 
outside i cannot take inside
water but no food right okay okay then  
i buy water outside and then i come back 
thank you okay nice to meet you okay bye bye
ken abroad can

okay nice to meet you nice to meet you bye-bye
i'm collecting uh filipino subscribers here on 
the beach um oh lovely people yeah so friendly  
and welcoming my first impressions of the 
philippines as i said in the previous video  
as well is awesome so far but yeah i 
definitely would like to see the sunset here  
but i'm also thirsty so we're going to get 
water from outside and then we bring it in again
excuse me i can buy water 
and bring inside yeah okay
okay so we can get water and then bring it inside 
oh i see coconuts as well can i get coconut  
you know how much okay okay please one

oh delicious fresh coconuts here 
again okay thank you very much
ah check it out this view with fresh 
coconut water what could be better  
absolutely amazing oh i'm so 
happy to be in the philippines
amazing yeah let's um find a 
spot maybe where we can sit
didn't want to ruin the photo shoot here
oh hello hello i got some coconut water 
yeah have a look around how many people  
are here now probably most of them are coming 
for the sunset here which is gonna be amazing  
or maybe let's check out the water a little bit
i'm not sure if this is a beach where 
you can actually also go swimming  
let me turn the camera around so you can actually 
see something other than my face so i'm not sure  
if you can also go swimming here i see nobody 
in the water but that is nothing unusual in asia  
if you go to beaches in thailand or malaysia it's 
very rare that you see locals actually swimming  
but maybe that's different in the philippines 
i don't know yet okay the water is not like  
this typical crystal clear blue water that you 
usually see on beaches in the philippines but  
this is a city here there's a big port over there 
as far as i know you have many ships over there  
so of course the water is not going to be as 
clean as on some islands here i'm from germany
you very much i'm very happy to be here sure  
are you from manila yeah no you 
see me i don't know that city
all right
how do you say one two three here
and dancing but how do you say in filipino one
really that sounds like spanish spanish
oh i didn't know that the numbers here are 
the same as in spanish that's very easy  
i used to live in spain a few years ago
abroad can abroad yeah
no problem
thank you very much that's actually very 
interesting that you count here as you count  
in espanyol i heard before that some of the 
words in the philippines are the same as in  
spanish because um the spanish used to be here it 
used to be a colony of uh spain as far as i know  
but then maybe i can get back some of my spanish 
skills then i used to live in spain for half a  
year in 2015 i did an internship there during my 
university time so that's a while ago so i have to  
get back my spanish skills from back then yes my 
first time in the philippines the second day today
yes it's very beautiful like today 
is no raining the perfect weather
where you came from i'm from germany germany yes 
how long you stay here uh two or three months  
long time i want to see uh many places in 
the philippines there's the camera okay
oh that looks really nice here
nice okay thank you thank you so much are you 
from manila no we we just worked here we came from  
i feel like everybody i ask here nobody is 
from manila everybody is coming from outside  
okay different areas around the philippines 
okay okay hope you can enjoy you can go around  
yes that's my plan i want to see many 
places in the philippines you better come to  
some provinces because there's a lot of if 
you like if you're a man who loves beaches  
in the provinces there are a lot of beaches it's 
more beautiful than here right yeah yeah with  
like nice water and palm trees yeah that's really 
what i'm looking forward to see in the philippines  
it's a it's not uh how do you say 
that in english it's a man-made  
beach right so it was created here 
right it's not in natural beach  
something like that there's a lot of beaches 
here in the mountains yes right you have over  
seven thousand islands here right so uh i have a 
lot to see here i hope so too thank you very much  
okay nice to meet you yeah there are over seven 
thousand islands here in the philippines and and  
i think i read that like two thousands of them 
are actually inhabited that means the majority  
of the islands is not even inhabited and therefore 
probably very beautiful to see yeah sunset time  
should be in like 15 minutes so i think that we're 
gonna lose view to the sun because there are some  
clouds that will block the sun in a few minutes 
but nevertheless wow it's fun here it's really fun  
and i have the feeling that not many foreigners 
come to this area of the town all right the sun  
has set it was quite beautiful to see and now 
you can see um most people are leaving the beach  
so the sun is actually gone now and 
yeah i'm actually a little bit hungry  
and since there were so many food stalls 
at the entrance let's see if we can  
grab a lot of another snake 
try something new preferably
somebody else is filming here
nice to meet you
people here are definitely not 
shy of the camera which is great
makes my life as a vlogger much easier let's 
see what we can get here so we have some some

it's an egg i think i heard about this 
egg before it's with the bird inside right
and it's a good delicious i think i 
saw some videos before where people  
made a challenge out of it to try this  
i don't know why it's a challenge maybe i'm gonna 
make a tasting of this as well in another video
the sugar or salt salt after 
they put salt on top of the egg
okay how do you eat this

not sure about what i'm very chewy
what's going on
thank you very much thank you 
thank you so how to describe this  
taste it's actually not true it's very 
chewy but it's also actually not bad here  
you can't bite it off you have to 
eat it in one piece i feel like
thank you thank you thank you okay i arrived 
at the last piece and the last piece wasn't  
dipped into the sauce and it's 
way more crispy not as chewy
and it's also more dry obviously 
if you don't put it into the sauce

squid into the sauce here hello hello hello i'm
