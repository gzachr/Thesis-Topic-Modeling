and that is the sound that you want to
hear
i can't really hear you the chicken's a
little bit loud
guys it's melissa i'm here in seattle
washington and today we're going to be
making a roasted chicken afritada
chicken afritada is a filipino tomato
based stew
is super similar to this italian dish
called chicken cacciatore it's got
chicken
there's always potatoes carrots tomato
sauce and we're actually making it with
fish sauce and soy sauce today
normally when you make chicken afritada
it's like a one pot
kind of stew but today we're kind of
breaking it down
by browning the skin so we have a really
nice crispy chicken skin
which is like the best part of the dish
and we're going to roast the veggies
separately
but to start with the base we're going
to make a sofrito
i lived in florence for almost five
years and this is kind of the italian
side
of putting what i learned in italy and
then applying it to this dish
the rule of thumb for sofrito is two
parts onion one part carrot one part
celery
cutting strips and then small little
cubes
you wanna cut everything the same size
so that it cooks evenly
so i'm just gonna use half of this
yellow onion and then a good trick
is to start along the radius but don't
cut all the way to the top
everything's still attached and then
you're gonna get the same size as the
carrots and the celery
i'm actually gonna add a red bell pepper
and some smashed garlic to it
and then i've got about five cloves here
how do you say garlic in italian allio
and then olive oil is olio
we can speak in italian if you want but
i'll be really nervous
so we're using um chicken thighs with
the skin on and the bone in
just because it adds a lot more flavor
having the bones in the chicken and it's
just really really good so
i'm gonna season the skin
side of the chicken first and then i'm
gonna flip it around
we're using johnny seasoning salt it's
got paprika garlic black peppers
and it's just really really good so they
should give you a sponsorship
i'm trying to get a sponsorship from
johnny's seasonings
but they don't have an instagram and
they're based here in tacoma
so if anyone is watching johnny johnny's
seasoning salts
musang would love to have you in their
restaurant
cast iron is hot nice and hot i'm gonna
use some olive oil
then i'm gonna put it skin side down
and don't be afraid to use your tongs to
press down on the chicken skin
so it can really evenly color
okay just going to cook it for a couple
minutes on each side
all right so the other side of the
chicken looks like this
and see how beautiful that color is and
i'm going to place it
in this with the skin side up yum
[Laughter]
all right so cast iron is still here
you can see all this kind of wonderful
juice that's in the skillet
so i'm going to take our sofrito and you
want to hear that
sound and then i just use it i'm going
to season it with some johnny's
just so that we can layer this dish as
we go
there's just like a lot of nostalgia in
this pan
so i'm gonna add about a cup of chicken
stock
then i'm gonna add a can of diced
tomatoes
i'm gonna add three bay leaves here
so right now this would be pretty
italian i think in a sense
but we're gonna make it filipino by
adding
our fish sauce and our silver silver
sand soy sauce
so i'm going to add about a tablespoon
and then i'm going to add
some fish sauce which actually in italy
there's this thing called kolatura and
it's anchovies that have been pressed
and then you get this liquid from it so
this would be like the filipino version
of that
it's always important to taste your food
oh my gosh it's so good i'm actually
going to add the chicken back into the
pot now
i'm gonna make sure that the chicken
skin isn't covered with the sauce
so that when we pull it out we're gonna
have a really nice beautiful crispy
chicken skin oh god see how strong i am
not that strong um while that's cooking
we're actually going to prep some
veggies that you'd normally find in the
chicken afritad as well but we're going
to roast them separately
just so we can really get the flavor out
of the veggies and they don't get lost
in the sauce
so i've got some rainbow carrots here
that we're gonna peel
you're gonna cut it and then roll it
having this kind of surface on the sheet
tray will allow for a higher
amount of caramelization so i've got
heirloom potatoes here
i'm going to cut these into quarters so
they're kind of the same size as the
carrots
coat it nicely with the oil and then
we're going to hit it with seasoning
salt
you can use your hands you can use a
spoon but it's
more fun to do this
you want to make sure that you have
ample space on your
tray so that everything can get
caramelized
so we're going to roast red bell peppers
as well but we're doing it separately
from the
potatoes and the carrots because it's a
different cooking time
and then i'm going to pop this in the
oven too
all right now we wait
[Music]
if i could do a shout out my i was a
nanny when i was actually in culinary
school in florence
um i nannied these two boys named leo
and cosimo
and uh the first video that we did leo
actually commented
on the video and he's a huge fan of bon
appetit
he's like i saw your name on the
notifications and i almost dropped my
phone
and he's like probably 20 now and when i
was his nanny he was 10
and we would like cook food together and
i would cook them filipino food so
it's just really special to kind of see
this full circle of journey
our 10 minute timer went up and i'm
gonna check on the red bell peppers
i think that they're done so you can see
there's a little bit of char
i'm gonna grab a fork and just check the
doneness on it
find a fork
you can see there's a little bit of
color on the side and it cuts really
easily
it's got a little bit of crunch oh my
gosh it's so good
roasted red bell peppers
20 minute timer just went off for our
carrots and our potatoes
you can see here that our carrots and
potatoes are perfectly cooked
it's delicious it still has bite to it
i'm happy
i'm gonna check on the chicken actually
too because i think if we've timed
everything correctly
that it is ready to come out of the oven
just be careful because the sauce and
like the fat that's coming out of the
chicken
i have two towels just to make sure that
i can carry everything
safely from here to there check out
this beautiful chicken skin i'm actually
going to take out the chicken
very carefully make sure that you don't
get sauce on that chicken skin you
worked so hard for
it's tender it's juicy it's picked up
the flavor of all that tomato
and you can see the sauce has reduced
down
smells so good you can see that our
sofrito
i mean like maintained its character in
here and so it's really nice and chunky
for our frittata um usually we'll add
green peas to the dish
i like to add two different types of
olives so i'm gonna add some of these in
here oops
fly away all of dark kalamata adds this
pop of color
oh my gosh it's so pretty now the
roasted vegetables actually come into
play
so i'm going to add our roasted red bell
peppers
and then from here i'm going to add our
roasted carrots and potatoes
at this moment would be the perfect time
to return your chicken thighs
back into the dish it looks like
christmas in a pot
oh it's so pretty this is not
our lola's afritada but this would be
mel's afritada i think that they'd still
be pretty proud seeing their food
plated this way not that i'm gonna cry
because that just made me want to cry
oh man i just got like hella feels
looking at this dish i think that like
as filipino
and philippines americans and filipino
americans
there's so much for us to be able to
share and there's just like
so much of us reclaiming and taking
pride in our food
and to be able to look at our food and
it be so beautiful and to be able to
share it like this with our elders and
our parents and our grandparents so
it's pretty beautiful so i'm gonna take
a bite out of it
oh man all right chicken skin meat
[Music]
oh it's so good oh the veggies are
perfectly cooked
there's a nice bite to it
[Music]
the fish sauce you can taste the tomato
has reduced
there's like acidity there's savoriness
there's sweetness to the vegetables
all that's missing is a bowl of rice
[Music]
oh my god it's so good i'm just gonna
keep
eating it's so good homer
