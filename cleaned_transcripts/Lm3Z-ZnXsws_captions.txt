grab a drink while I'm here so let's go
and find something to drink right here
oh yeah oh you guys look so friendly
no wonder I keep hearing this thing but
it's the buzzer I'll be back hold on
I thought it was my phone ringing but
it's just like deeper I got I'm like
what is that sound so let's grab our
food I'm excited
it's a chicken chicken okay excellent
here's your thing I can't wait to try it
thank you sir thank you so much
got the water let's go eat that seasick
I'll be honest when I first keep the
Philippines I wasn't really a big fan of
the food but as I stay here longer and
understand what to eat where to eat and
who was cooked by I start to realize
Filipino food does not get enough credit
oh man look at this snow so this is here
calamansi which is like a Filipino lime
it's really really small it's not that
sour it's a bit sweet it's got about a
hundred different little seeds in there
probably more seasoned here than there
is actually juice is that squeeze this
in here and check this out
now normally seasick is made with pig
parts of the head and cheeks mouth lips
and all that but this is chicken sea
sick because I don't eat
is like actual chili and lime and they
use a lot of soy sauce and vinegar to
give it that nice little kick I'm really
curious and it's supposed to mix in the
egg in here so let's see it it makes
this bad boy in here
here's the moment of truth
look at that
I dropped it on the table
whoa
a bamboo man that is delicious thank you
they're watching me eat this hmm
immediately I could taste the different
spices there's a little bit of salt a
little bit of sourness and of course the
tanginess of that soy sauce
delicious now this will go perfectly on
top of white rice I'm not trying to fill
up you want to check out some different
foods
and this was only around three dollars
wow I can't believe it it can't even get
a cup of coffee for three bucks get all
this chicken and delicious food for just
three dollars oh I forgot I'm in the
Philippines I gotta use a spoon not Fork
you want to eat and sweat at the same
time
the Philippine the place to be
Cebu was famous for their pork roast so
the lechon I'm not gonna eat any so it's
not really fair to do a food tour about
the Philippines without eating pork but
if you're coming here to Cebu City you
have to try the lechon the roasted pork
it's really really famous and it looks
absolutely delicious so I finished that
seasick it was really really uh
delicious and filling let's see if you
can find some more Filipino food now
this behind me looks super interesting I
don't know what it is but it looks local
I see some peanuts some boiling or
something
foreign
and is this your shop yes
it looks very busy I guess people like
it
banana cue yes sir
peanuts right
yeah very nice how much is for one
sticky how much is one cup this is 50
and this is 35. okay I'll take the 35
one please
okay
check out this Grill man who
barbecue this is real coke yeah
Filipinos love barbecue so wherever you
go you're gonna see like barbecue sticks
uh chicken intestines pork not so much
beef but you can find all kinds of stuff
here I'll show you what this banana cue
looks like tastes like you try some of
the peanuts right now the most difficult
thing is to find a place where that's
not too loud so you guys can hear me and
see me and let's go in for the banana
cue I've had this one time before and
I'll be honest it's a bit too sweet for
my taste but maybe this one's a little
bit less sweet this is I think deep
fried plantains or some kind of banana
of course I don't know the different
species but they cover this with brown
sugar and it's really popular here in
the Philippines I always see it on the
streets people love it it's really
inexpensive only 20 pesos right for two
of these so basically 10 per banana and
the woman was so sweet and kindness she
was so like I don't know man people here
are like wonderful makes your eating
experience completely like 10 times
better than if you're just to like eat
somewhere else or buy yourself here we
go
look like
it's like candy
imagine like a candied apple but it's
instead of Apple it's banana
actually I don't mind this one it's a
lot less sweet than the last one and
it's not very like mushy like the one I
had before this is really really good I
highly recommend it
I mean we're all familiar with peanuts
the roasted peanuts raw peanuts but it
really has boiled peanuts for a storm
look at that
three in this one
salty
it's really good
see how wet is inside 35 Pesos for like
probably 500 grams it's about 60 60
cents for all this you can have this
with like movies and chilling outside
whatever you know nice little light
snack
wait that's alive
I had four peanuts in India but this is
really good I like it this is a bit more
salty than the last one but it gives it
that flavor you need you know salty
snacks anyway let's go find some more
food to eat and maybe some drinks
