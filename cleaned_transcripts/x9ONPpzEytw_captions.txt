now when you talk about the philippines
you understand this is a country where
uh
filipinas are abundant yeah man they're
all over me they're here they're there
they're
everywhere and they're all seeking to
help to the altar to the ve
them want just a mortar but a lot of
them just want
love man you just want to be alone and
they just want to find somebody that
loves it that's a problem
sometime what happened is foreigners
come out here and they look for love
and so the filipinos be looking for love
to so it's a natural hookup
filipino and florida filipina and
florida
born in the filipino and they have a
natural
affection for one another and they begin
to have what a love
connection okay a natural affection
leads to a love connection
so they hook up you know it's okay man
that's what life is all about finding
the one that you love
finding the ones you want to be with
find the ones you want to commit
yourself to
and then get into it you know they say
when you don't if you don't get in the
game you get in it to win it right
so get in the game of love get in the
game of life in order to win it okay so
the hook up
and then you go up with the filipino
because of multiple reasons number one
filipinos are very very affectionate oh
yeah man
they'll love you as long as you live in
this world that if you do them right
hey they will do you right thailand they
will love you man
and when they say love you they'll do
whatever it takes to make you happy
they will cook for you they will clean
for you they will uh
shine your shoes whatever it takes man
they're about the family they wish they
would cook for you
they will they will take care of you
royally like your team
they'll make you feel happy and never
make you feel content
that's what they do and you know they're
they're designed to do that
what do you mean they desire to do it
but they're robots now man they're not
robots
they're trained from children on the
girls are trained to take care of the
family
they watch the mother the mother is a
role model the mothers
emulate how it means and what it means
to take care of a family take it from
men
they give children that's what they're
doing take it home that's what they do
so they are drilled on that they're
chained on that from children on up to a
dust
so number one they're loving not only
are the philippines loving man
they're caring yeah they're caring they
care for you they share for you
and they'll do whatever it takes to make
you feel
that you are welcome you're warm you're
loved
because they're about caring sharing for
the family
the family is everything to the filipina
and everything to the filipina is to the
family okay
that's the way it goes that's the way it
is uh i have never been in a society
where they put so much emphasis on the
family as this
country does that from the beginning
from kids on
they will do anything for the family
they will sacrifice their lives for the
family
they believe that the father and father
are more important to them
so many filipinas go overseas and they
do what's called overseas filipino
workers
they work overseas to gain money gain
income we send back home to mom and dad
and their children and their sisters and
brothers they will sacrifice their life
for the love of and the well-being
of their family so not only they're
loving and sharing
sharing but they are giving yeah
yeah man they will give you the shirt
off their
backs if that's what you need they
i told you they go overseas and they
send their money they're giving up their
life
they give up their life so that their
family can be better off
that's how much they love their family
they're loving
they're sharing they're giving and
you can't ask for no more and no better
than that they will make you
happy if you the court the big thing is
if
you find the right one baby yeah and
taking finding the right one takes time
you just can't get online and see a few
ladies and
next thing you know you oh she's doing
now give the time man
it took me several times before i found
lisa give it time man
you need time to talk to the lady walk
with that lady speak with that let me
talk with them
eat with that lady share things with
them so as you begin to know and learn
them
they they need to see different sides of
them and see if they're compatible with
you
it takes time okay so that's how you
know
well you can find a loving that's why
foreigners come out here
all over the world to find the loving
sharing caring filipino
that's what they do and because
filipinas respond to
them most of the people want to form
some of them don't but most of them want
to format you know why
because they got the multi-hard time
they can they know that they'll be taken
care of because most filipinos
can't take care of the filipina like
they want because they just don't have
the money they don't have the jobs
question for today what is your opinion

coveted item as far as women are in the
world
