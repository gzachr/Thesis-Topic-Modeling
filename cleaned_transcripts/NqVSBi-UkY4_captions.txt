I received this package from a Philippine 
company as you can see I already opened the  
box but I did not yet check which items are 
in there so we do that together came from
[Music]  
Mama sitas so this was sent through a distributor 
in the Netherlands and as you can see there are  
many items so we're gonna have a look at all of 
them first one is already something that I don't

how to use this one please let me know in the  
comments okay then we have a caldereta mix which 
is really nice of course caldereta always yummy

thinking to try make tocino today

nice would be nice for sinigang na baboy or  
sinigang na hipon diba there's more of those 
for tocino and then what is this barbecue  
marinade wow that is nice and it comes with 
a kind of recipe yeah free recipe book that's  
really nice cook booklet Asian easy Asian

have used this one from Mama sita's before  
and we have wow as you know I love labuyo 
I like this looks like a sauce yeah it's  
a hot pepper sauce very curious to try 
this one and I think there's another one  
yeah there's another one here and oh there's 
another barbecue marinade that's really handy
oh yes look at this one it's sarsa 
Nang lechon atbp what does it mean  
atbp all-purpose sauce yeah I guess 
this is just the lechon sauce right and  
I have not tried the one from Mamacitas 
before I believe so that's exciting
oh foreign that's it so there's 
a lot of items as I said I want  
to try making the tocino first what 
do you think should we make tocino
that's a beautiful weather 
today here in the Netherlands
Bob where would you choose for tocino 
there's many different types of baboy here  
I guess I will just go with this one which 
is a little bit more fatty you know fatty  
piece I think that's always nice for the tocino 
internally to prepare this tocino it's pretty  
easy all we need to do is chop the baboy put 
them in a bowl take the Mamasitas tocino mix  
spread it open and pour the 
tocino mix over the baboy
now we just need to mix this
well the tocino mixture is doing 
its work it's gonna make a nice  
and delicious salad and we're using celery 
today apparently this is very healthy gulay  
just chopping it into tiny pieces talking 
about healthy gulai or healthy fruitas I  
should say the other day my family and I went 
to a really nice farm so I am here in a really  
nice place where there's a lot of trees apple 
trees you can see behind me it's so beautiful  
and there's thousands of apples literally you 
can see here in the trees and you can pick  
your own Apple you can choose different types 
of apples one for apple pie one just to eat  
like that and we're gonna bring a few they also 
have pears and other fruits let us try [Music]  
see they look pretty nice so nice 
[Music] these apples look amazing  
so we're gonna bring like buckets you 
know and then you have to put them here  
and then we can pay for them
baboy [Music] if you like this video so far 
please don't forget to give it a thumbs up okay  
apparently this is so simple this tocino we just 
heat up the pan then pour in the baboy mixture
add some boiling water just a little bit to cover 
it we let this boil gently okay for approximately  
20 to 30 minutes I guess until the meat is 
really tender and then we're gonna fry it  
of course now I want to show you a place where 
I've been uh last week I've been to Slovenia  
and Slovenia is really amazing I've been there 
a couple of times and I really recommend if you  
if you're going to Europe if you're coming to 
Europe with your family to check out Slovenia  
it is such a beautiful country with Mountains 
clean air and everything is so clean the streets  
food is nice people are nice so I just wanted 
to say that you know that it's a really nice  
country to visit Meanwhile we're making a nice 
dressing for the selery this is coconut vinegar  
feeling lang we have one clove of garlic here bar 
one this is a big one which is enough more than  
enough now the way we will cut it is like this 
first we do tiny pieces so then in order to get  
this really get the taste out I'm gonna just do 
like this with the knife get all the juices out
it's super fine all the juices 
of the Bawang are in here  
so we're gonna add this to the coconut 
vinegar contain black pepper see
Dutch mustard this is so delicious so Brown syrup 
it is quite spicy so we're gonna add one teaspoon
one tablespoon of mayonnaise
let's give it a good flavor the 
fats and a little bit of honey
we're gonna whisk this all together carefully  
become a super nice dressing it's 
my signature honey mustard dressing
perfect so yummy we're gonna pour it 
over the celery okay give that a good mix
meanwhile the baboy is really tender 
and there's only a little bit of  
water left as you can see and in a moment 
this will be dry and becoming crispy oh
let me also know what you are eating 
today very curious to the tocino

but I think it looks really good wow and the  
smell is amazing now I'm also very curious how
