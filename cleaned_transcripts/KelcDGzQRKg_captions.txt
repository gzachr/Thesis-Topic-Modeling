starting my morning walk this morning here 
in pavia iloilo province in the philippines  
and just uh gonna try to put 
a little comment in there  
and getting ready to go gonna hit 
the pavement here just in a minute
it rained last night so everything is nice and 
fresh today i'm really enjoying my morning walks  
here in pavilla it just seemed like almost 
every morning something just calls to me you  
know and it's time for me to get up about five 
and get out there and start enjoying my life  
i'm getting ready to run up on this guy that 
sells me fruit you won't see him but he's got  
a little gold van i'll be here just in a second 
right over there is the tiguan river t-i-g-u-m
morning
um what are you going to have
i love that i love the pears yeah they're 
really okay thank you yeah that little guy  
sells me fruit he's got that little gold van 
and he drives around neighborhoods i think he's  
he's a retired cop actually but uh really nice 
guy he did end up coming to my house that uh  
that probably an hour after i got back got some 
of the sweetest pears you've ever ever tried  
in your whole life they don't even resemble 
really or taste like a pear they're too juicy  
i put them in the refrigerator every time i 
get them man i'm telling you what they're great
i really enjoyed the walks because it seemed like 
i just keep getting healthier the whole time i'm  
here i mean my blood pressure's dropped i'm more 
relaxed by far maybe it's just it's a hot weather  
i don't know but man i'm telling you what i'm 
really enjoying it we've been about six weeks in
good morning
that was the panda salt guy or a 
pandas all guy pandas all just a bread  
little bread like a roll or something 
that's delivered every morning to your house
we got a little place here good morning
a little place here it sells fish and  
small grocery items a little 
bit everything they're hustlers
these sidewalks they go they go up and down
if you take your eyes off of 
very long you could fall down
i was listening to one of the vloggers here 
philippines info channel and he made a good  
point he said if you're if you're really well 
i was gonna say old but it doesn't matter  
how old you are if you have trouble getting 
around if you have trouble walking this is a  
kind of a hard place for you and philippines 
info channel's got a lot of good information
i love this little town i gotta 
watch all my obstacles here
a lot of these little depressions here made for 
the cars so they get the cars in and out of course
the political signs political signs the 
politics will be over this week i guess  
i think don't quote me but i think of may 5th 
is the election a lot less noise music going  
around on these trucks that's how they distribute 
distribute their political ads by pickup trucks  
with uh with big speakers on the 
back of it i gotta look both ways  
morning
it's nice to be out after rain 
it's pretty humid but still  
it's going to get a lot hotter today 
and this is the best part of the day
see the political ads
philippines is great a little store i just 
passed there's a probably a an eight-year-old  
kid asleep on a on a tabletop a little 
blanket i guess he slept there all night  
it's just funny things you see the 
signage in the philippines is always  
funny and to me american perspective it's 
kind of funny not funny to them you know but  
from my perspective look outside looking in it's  
it's mildly humorous you know 
that's the way they name stuff
i hear the catholic church doing 
some kind of prayer or something
lots of big trucks there's 
the the main grocery store  
i don't know how to say it what kind of grocery 
store it is but uh it's like the main americanized  
type grocery store i went in there last night i'm 
gonna have a whole video on that it was hilarious
but i think a lot more stuff sold at the 
palanqui you're going to see the palenque  
here in a minute clanky is just you don't know 
it's a word for market open air market they  
sell fish and uh meats and vegetables just about 
anything else your average filipino would need
there's my chicken place i've eaten there 
several times get a chicken for about five bucks  
five five and a half it's been 
grilled on a spit there's 7-eleven
i don't see a lot of 7-elevens 
back in the states anymore
but they're here here comes the jeepneys
oh wow looks like that one is uh
cut vegetables some of the jeepneys 
are just for public transportation  
and my c-cod guys and tricycle guys uh 
and some of them actually here here we go
yeah it's filled with people but it's 
also got a lot of vegetables on top of it  
so this is the pavilla plaza  
and uh that's where the fiesta is gonna be in a 
couple of days they're getting set up takes them  
a couple weeks they've been working on at least 
two weeks probably more with the political stuff
and the police policeman
morning
everybody likes to say good morning which is 
great not everybody the alarm goes are kind of
kind of stoic i would say as compared 
to the rest of the philippines
you know you go different places in uh pampanga 
you go dutch i've been there a lot and uh  
just a lot of different places people see a camera 
they want to jump in front of it here a little bit  
shy a little bit camera shy which is fine we're 
that way in america too some people warning  
some people probably punch you if 
they oh wow if you get them on camera
if we're unloading all that 
stuff going into the market
i try to respect people's privacy nobody 
asked me to come down here and film them
so i'm going to shut it off for a 
minute and i'll go inside the market
morning
morning
morning
good morning  
oh
so
okay
thank you
uh
good morning
guys
morning morning
good morning
okay
so
good morning
i'm trying to get across the street
not that busy this morning
oh nice breeze coming along here
somebody's speaking in there i 
don't know what they're saying  
but that's the one of the oldest churches 
one of the old churches in the philippines  
i think it's uh maybe one of the first 
built by the spaniards this is pavilla  
i guess i could look it up i should 
look it up right uh i looked it up
so anyway just everybody's 
out for a walk this morning
morning
you know i'm i may be you may 
be like me may not be but uh
when you're in a hot climate it's  
in your first like you come out of that's 
left last night air conditioning so
it's like you come out of air conditioning 
into you know the heat a little bit of the  
heat mugginess whatever it was 
like 80 this morning 78 80.
morning
and uh you know you first start to get hot 
and i'm an american guy i'm used to living  
in air conditioning even in the summer it's 
like you go from one air conditioned place to  
another you don't really break out in a full 
sweat so you know that's kind of a challenge  
living in the philippines is the heat and you 
have to learn how to adapt and i'm in that  
process but i find that if i'll get out and take 
a walk in the morning it doesn't feel too bad um  
you know especially when you first get out and you 
walk around i stopped while ago and there's like  
seven eight nine old guys sitting around this 
little coffee shop and i've been meaning to  
stop in there i see them there on my walks and 
i kind of always wanted to stop and you know see  
what they're up to but you know there's a language 
barrier and so i'm like i don't know man you know  
i can't speak the language so i thought now one 
of these days i'm just going to walk up there well  
that was today i just walked up there and as usual 
when you try something that you're a little bit  
afraid of or concerned about usually it ends up a 
lot better than what you thought it was going to  
and so i walked up there and immediately 
there's one guy pretty well off dude you  
could tell by filipino standards and he spoke 
english so you know i was able to talk and uh  
have a conversation with this guy he 
traveled all over america he had actually  
he had uh spent a month he's got a tourist visa so 
you know he's i'm on my way back you know he's a  
wealthy filipino considered wealthy here because 
well if you're filipino and you go to the us  
then you've got to have some resources you got 
to own some property you got to own some land  
and so he was able to morning he was able to uh be 
a tourist okay so he learned he's he knows quite a  
bit english we communicated very well his name was 
larry and uh i sat there and had a cup of coffee  
and that's my first time that i actually uh
actually sat down with a bunch of guys like that
i came into town by myself my wife's always 
been kind of concerned you know she don't  
want me to go in just take one of your 
nephews or nieces or something in the town
but i kind of like to go by myself 
sometimes you know because i don't know  
i'm a guy that i've built uh three businesses 
in my life in the last 20 years and sold them  
and had a lot of employees and i'm just not 
one to sit around the house all the time i mean  
but you know there's a there's a certain 
apprehension i i get that from her i mean  
what if something would happen to me but you can 
see this little town is is actually safer than
it's actually safer than any town i've 
lived in the united states i think  
so i'll give you an example i
i came into town last night morning morning and uh 
i took one of those little little bikes like that
i'm back in the neighborhood and uh i rode into 
town to the puregold grocery store well i've  
been walking back and forth quite a bit sometimes 
with somebody accompanying me sometimes not and
sorry if my speech is i gotta look around and i've 
got to pay attention to what's going on so much  
sometimes i'll stop mid-sentence but anyway so 
i came into town i needed some sand miguel light  
beer and i don't i just get tired of sending 
people go get me stuff i don't feel like  
you know they got other stuff to do let 
them do their stuff i'll do mine so i hopped  
on a c-cod and came in to town last night got out 
of course you know i'm riding down this street  
i'm riding down this street and 
i'm sitting in that little little  
basket of a side car and there's like a lot 
of people look at me because i mean my skin  
color is white that's unusual here you're 
you're uh you stand out let's put that away  
and uh they all look and smile and some of them 
wave you know so it was kind of fun but uh then i  
i went in and that's a whole nother story but i 
come out and this tricycle or c-cod driver they  
call the little bicycles with the side car they 
call them c-cod morning and the motorcycles with  
a sidecar they call a tricycle so anyway i was 
i come outside i was gonna grab another c-cod  
and go back home because it was dark i walk 
out and they all line up they have to take  
turns the guy in the front of the line gets 
the guy next person you know so anyway uh
see my neighbor across the road over there  
so anyway i go to the front of the 
seacoat line and the guy jumps up  
well he mentioned are you from saturn says 
neighborhood i said yeah good morning guys
gonna be hot today
so anyway he jumps up and he he mentions my 
subdivision he knew me he why he'd seen me he  
knew where i lived you know just for some morning 
some random guy driving a c-cod to know who you  
are you know it's small-town life here i don't 
even know the population here iloilo's like a  
half a million so it's a major town as far as i'm 
concerned i've never really lived in a huge city  
but uh it's a nice place see a lady over 
there she's sweeping up that's very common  
people sweeping you got these little little 
brooms they call them the wallis and uh
and i got a broom it's called a 
wallis i need to bring my phone stick  
so i can hold it a little bit farther away 
there's a guy carrying a rooster in front of me  
sorry uh anyway they got these little little 
brooms they call wallis and it's just basically  
little tiny sticks all wrapped together you 
can sweep outside and sweep inside i guess  
it's a rough surface yeah pretty pretty 
utilitarian you know and they're cheap so  
that's just about it on my morning walk
i i've enjoyed it i've worked up i've talked 
about working up a good sweat you work up a  
little bit of a good sweat and then when you 
get back home and you can tolerate the heat a  
little better another thing i try to do try to 
think about three showers a day sometimes four  
for a big old guy like me i mean i'm not that tall 
but had too much weight on me for okay let's just  
say i sweat sweat a lot for a fat guy anyway uh 
so yeah three to four showers a day helps a lot  
anyway that's about all i got for now catch 
you later okay so i'm gonna add a little clip  
on this video this is uh coming up close to 
my house i don't live in a rich neighborhood  
uh nice people here good people local crime i 
don't know if there is any crime probably is there  
is i don't know anything about it but you know 
there's some nice places here this is our house
we built that took us about three years to build 
it on 120 square meters i just kind of guess  
guess that it cost me maybe three and 
a half million pesos which is about  
i don't know 60 70 000 morning
it's just kind of like the jungle's 
almost taking over out here  
but uh that's yeah that's this 
is our place that's my last  
first initial to my last name there's lazy 
filipino dogs so anyway have a great day
