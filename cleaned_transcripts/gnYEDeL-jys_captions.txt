hello good evening wow smells great so there's 
so many products yeah amazing i never saw so  
many filipino products in one place so they have a 
century tuna, bagoong alamang, filipino spaghetti  
sauce that's great but this is the filipino 
hot dog bread oh that's nice oh it's amazing  
you have hot dog bread this one are the spanish 
food oh spanish spanish bread there's no hotdog
is there inside you recommend i prefer the other 
one oh this one is it typical filipino yeah  
vegetarian chicharron crackling oh yeah 
cheese balls these are nice cheese balls
how is this one is it nice 
yes do a taste like that or  
what it's like red horse yeah you have pizzas 
how do you call how do you pronounce it
so i was able to get a full bag of filipino 
products so let's quickly go back home  
just in time let's make champorado i 
think we need to start with adding the  
malagkit
this time i'll add bit more than last time
i hope that's enough water let's mix it a little 
bit while the rice is boiling let's have a look  
at some of the products that i've got mang tomas 
lechon sauce almost finished this is so masarap i  
tried it with uh lechon and with chicken we have 
banana ketchup mango juice spinach cocoa powder  
century tuna sisig ligo and of course tuyo gourmet 
tuyo now you might wonder why there is a bago  
because i'm gonna cook another dish for you 
so today i'm gonna cook uh both champorado  
with toyo but also bicol express because many of 
you requested me to cook bicol express now the  
water is getting hot now the question is how much 
cocoa powder do we need i just do this on feeling  
chocolate and fish what a 
combination it smells very fishy
the filipino tuyo these are all pieces nice i 
think there's some bawang in there wow actually  
it smells good let's fry this in another wok 
here okay for sure that's gonna smell a lot
mmm
wow let's add the cocoa powder
mmm malagkit cocoa
now i think this for other will 
be much better than last time
i think i should not cook this dish in 
the garden because otherwise the neighbors  
they will smell this uh tuyo it's really slimy  
i made it very crispy i would not try it yet 
but i will try it with the chocolate the first  
much better
with a little bit of evaporated milk 
whoa a little bit too much and it to you  
mmm chocolate and fish now here comes the moment  
special moment first time ever for me to try 
chocolate and fish or champorado with tuyo
wow i have to get used to the taste but i think 
it's good this is good yeah it's nice at first  
it's like a whoa it's salty and sweet and crispy 
and soft but i like it yeah it's good i like the
taste combination so next 
we make a big express okay

nice and crispy before i add the sibuyas  
so let's add the sibuyas red and white

so tasty on bango guys would you like 
to see me bring this dish to my parents
