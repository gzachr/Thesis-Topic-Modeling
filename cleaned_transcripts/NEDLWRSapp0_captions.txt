good morning everyone we are Nicole and mico 
and we have exploring Philippines for the  
past two months getting to know more about the 
culture and mico's roots in the last video we  
finally made it to my childhood home city 
of Bacolod which happens to be one of the  
big food capitals here in the Philippines 
so in today's video we'll be exploring the  
best way that we know how which is with 
our very own self-led Filipino food tour
all right we have made it to our first stop of 
the day every food tour in Bacolod has to have  
chicken in a Cell this place is very famous for 
chicken and salad which is basically like grilled  
chicken Filipino style so we've come to like 
the number one spot where you can get chicken  
and salad which is manokan country which is 
kind of like chicken country and they got  
big signs already says delicious chicken 
home to the best chicken and a salad the  
problem is we gotta pick a restaurant because 
they're like they all serve the same thing and  
they're just like it's just a huge lineup 
I kind of want there's one called nickel I  
kind of wanted to pick the one called Nicole 
there's no one in it though is that bad news
[Music]  
foreign
like I said earlier is like a Filipino barbecue 
it is made out of chicken marinated in local herbs  
and spices and then skewered with bamboo sticks 
and then grilled over like a charcoal fire and  
it is uh it is really special here in Boko because 
this is where chicken in the cell originates from  
and what makes it really really good here in 
bacola as well is that the chicken in a salad  
is extremely juicy so we got three different 
kinds of meat today so this is chicken thigh  
right okay this is yeah it's called Baja it's 
the chicken thigh What's the Filipino name this  
is uh this is which is like a chicken intestines 
yeah so it's all parts of the chicken yeah and  
then I also ordered us a Thai which is chicken 
liver yeah a little different for Nicole but I  
love this food I'm gonna try liver I think okay 
we're keeping it pretty tamed right now because  
we have a lot of food ahead so this is dang look I 
mean like in terms of the amount of food normally  
this pile would be stacked high if you're coming 
here with your family all right guys take a liver
it's not my favorite like squishy and like mushy 
I just like eating um actually the texture is kind  
of like eating like a squishy potato or something 
try the pop that's like the main the main thing  
now this looks absolutely amazing because it's 
like so it's so juicy looking and like crispy  
I'm also gonna make you a sauce good Josh Berry 
again we've had chicken and a salad in Manila  
as well but it does not compare to this this is 
really juicy I'm making like a sauce for Nicole  
this I've got like soy sauce in here and I'm 
gonna add um some vinegar this is calamansi by  
the way I didn't know that before coming to the 
Philippines so it's like a tiny lime but it's  
um sweet much sweeter than a lime and I'm 
gonna add that calamansi into the sauce
rice
so I'm gonna have the liver I want to say 
the best way to get this with your hands
man this is which is like cool looking 
chicken intestines you gotta try this one yeah
cheers [Music]
it's good
Nicole always laughed at me because  
she's always not as funny that my favorite meal 
in the entire world is just chicken and rice
again
as it turns out that my hometown is actually 
like famous for chicken and rice so it must  
be I didn't know this I had no idea so all these 
years so much it's just a thing and then we put  
the book and we're like it makes sense now I think 
what I'm learning too about a chicken and a salt  
is that like it's about like the whole thing 
together like I really think you're gonna do  
the sauce you gotta do the chicken oil obviously 
like a mixture of rice and then meat it's really  
like like the whole thing you need the whole 
package and then it's excellent this is what  
I consider the perfect barbecue date you know if 
you're out having barbecue in the park this is  
what I would love to see on the grill every 
single time this is just your perfect day
guys if you can see that
[Music]
Okay so we've made our way into a place called 
Sharon's County house county is a dish here in  
Bacolod and for what we understand this was 
actually potentially the very first County  
like restaurant here in the city that's where 
the front told us at least it's a super famous  
One apparently the content is amazing I'm gonna 
let me tell you about the currency though first  
of all shout out to my buddy Robin back in 
Canada who told me about this place uh this  
looks awesome already I am really pumped 
because pansy is like I think I've had it  
before but I've never had a rainbow colored it's 
like a big almost think of it as like a big bone  
with like I think it's a beef bone with a 
chunks of beef on it and also bone marrow  
and it's been cooking for hours and hours and 
hours and it's supposed to be like Mega soft  
like fall off just giant bone soft so I'm really 
pumped for it also it's like presented in like a  
soup so the broth or the soup you mix it with 
the rice it's gonna be so I'm sultry thank you
before I actually eat this why did they give us
I'm a huge fan of like like homemade 
broth when we lived in Canada I still  
did that a lot I loved it and like 
look at this look at how like dense  
and Meaty it is you can just tell that 
like the these chunks of meat have been  
stewing in what is now brought for so 
long oh my Lord it is so soft [Music]
it's so good I'll try the broth this is so good
oh salty there's so much flavor in that 
it's like meaty but it's not overly meaty  
which is good because like I prefer not super 
meaty broth wow also I'm pretty sure should I  
like I think I should be eating the inside 
of this yeah yeah that's the bone marrow  
looks like fat but I know it's marrow 
I feel like I should try it with rice  
that's so healthy for you it's so good 
for me right okay all right it's good
oh okay I don't love the texture because it's 
like gooey which is just not my favorite food  
texture okay it actually tastes like really good 
like meaty salty I want to get more but I don't  
know if I could eat it you know I think it's 
funny because where Nicole and I are from like  
beef is such a huge thing like everybody loves 
like steaks and whatnot but it turns out where  
I was born beef is also a huge thing with constant 
this is like a cute like honestly I think I would  
choose this over steak yeah it looks way more 
flavorful to me anyways and it looks good and  
I love just having just straight chunks of beef 
because I don't like anything added on to it like  
no like extra vegetables or anything garnishing 
No Frills just beef and it's soup this and with  
the bone and the marrow that's very good and I 
always thought that when Nicole and I started  
dating she thought it's so weird to eat the bone 
marrow but here she is today right oh the heart  
Chunk in it it's like a seed okay guys Miko's 
gonna show me his uh his filipino-ness right now
that's so weird
I didn't think it was gonna come all out and like
I guess I don't get anymore it was 
also a typical Filipino tradition  
is after you finish your campsie 
you take the bone home with you
I don't think that's real [Music]
finding that something that's really cool 
about these places we're going to is that  
they like do one thing and they just 
do that one thing really really well  
like there's a couple other things that 
you seem to be able to order but for the  
most part it's like when you go to like 
this is like a bonchai place and like  
all they do is Bon Joy they do it a few 
different ways I've ever had toy before  
um but I've been told that you gotta try when you 
come to pakolo it's like a Filipino noodle dish  
that has uh some Meats added to it so you usually 
have some beef and chicharron which is like a pig  
skin I think the noodle in here is sunset which 
is like a very classic Filipino neutral friendly
crunchy the Twitter run is super crunchy I was 
not expecting that okay I like the flavor I really  
like the broth this is very good this is I really 
enjoy this this might be should I say it's my  
favorite of the day but that's not true they've 
all been so good honestly it looks so weird  
it looks a little strange it looks weird to me 
let's see if it tastes great it doesn't it's good
do it for me it's like I haven't had any  
crunchiness but I can taste it and 
I can smell it [Applause] [Music]
okay so that's not stop I don't know 
that it's particularly Filipino but  
it's like bacon Bacolod it's a cafe 
called what is it called and like so  
many people told us we had to come here 
and try some of their desserts apparently  
it's amazing I don't really know that it's 
Filipino but I don't care because I really  
wanted to go Nicole says she's ready for 
a little less meat and a little more sweet
we've had multiple people here from Bacolod 
tell us where to get the mud pie specifically  
here I guess it's like chocolate ice 
cream fudge Oreo crumbs and almonds  
this is like why I ate everything else I ate today
so today I feel like we did try a ton of different 
foods but this is a pretty good representation of  
like a piece of Filipino food Cuisine and culture 
because it was very meat heavy very delicious and  
then we top it off with some intensely sweet 
desserts you're right that was super Filipino  
meat sweets I think those two words sum up 
a small a small section of Filipino Cuisine  
because there's a lot more to it I swear there's a 
lot more to it so we're gonna dive into this cake  
and uh some uh hot uh latte some lattes I think 
the next video will be we're not actually totally  
sure pretty sure it'll be on a different Island I 
think make sure you subscribe so you can see where  
the heck they go next since we don't even know 
and uh yeah we'll catch you guys in the next one  
thanks for watching just put it in your pocket 
that's everybody knows he had a good can see
[Music]
