kid in a in a candy shop that's nice

Michael is thinking about what we're gonna 
have the change was the Sunday night wow okay
thank you
very nice people so this is 
my number I'm going upstairs  
to get my table to see Michael to check 
him if he's okay if he didn't get lost
in the meantime and let's see I'm very excited on  
how this thing is gonna turn out 
to be there's some people here
foreign
that's a lot of money and change okay 
I'm not used to this money yet but uh  
it's very colorful so far yeah hopefully 
I can get used to it quick because uh well  
it's a new country a new country new money 
so Michael what do you know about Jollibee
joints around the world and supposedly the food 
is very good so if the food is good we come here  
really and so we had a bit of a misfortune because 
when we arrived in the Philippines we arrived in  
the middle of typhoon carding or noru or however 
it's called and we were running through the  
streets yesterday evening like idiots trying to 
find the same card and some money and I know the  
Necessities around to manage our day-by-day life 
but in the end we managed and now we have both  
internet and a lot of money as you saw before and 
we're ready to try the most amazing food available  
looks like the people at the bigger table have 
left so I can do a Switcheroo and change our  
place so this nice boost looking area 
because it's more comfortable and more nice
okay and just like that for the miracle of 
time our food has arrived and we have uh  
chicken Jollibee something with spaghetti okay 
I think that's yours I I never thought I would  
eat spaghetti and chicken at the same 
time just look at the spaghetti foreign
pineapple Burger yeah give me one second let  
me put this stuff here okay 
okay so this is the burger
I like pineapple and pizza so of course I like it 
on the burger as well it's good okay okay don't  
eat all my burger because that's my food you got 
your spaghetti chicken and I got my nice a burger
yo just look at this one yes no 
this is more like a GG this is  
more chicken for us oh wow so on three 
Michael let's do it okay three two one
um
holy cow this is good chicken  
what has this been all my life this is a 
very good thingy spicy amazing sauce the  
chicken is amazing it's super crunchy it's 
a bit salty and with the spicy sauce mmm
it's a match made in heaven I mean it's perfect 
I don't have that many bones which is good for  
me so I don't know you have option to choose 
between this kind of sauce which is brown and hot  
but not spicy
another spicy one which I tried before 
so I don't know and considering the fact  
that we have a huge amount of chicken here 
in this bucket I mean that's a ton of food  
but we're hungry because today we haven't done 
anything so okay perfect come here don't be no
push food is done finally time to go now we still  
have this hey more Fuji did you see 
the amount of chicken I had to eat
peachy
all right
so good
honestly guys crunchy and sweet and tastes 
like mango and pineapple usually when I go  
to fast food places after I eat I feel like 
like I'm dead like I have a brick inside my  
food but this time is the first time ever I'm 
coming to a fast food place the food is good  
it doesn't feel like it's post processed so I 
don't know what they put inside the food here but  
it's good so I don't know it doesn't taste 
like a hot food food right it tastes like  
homemade food somehow at least a combination 
with the pasta it would be something that I  
would eat at my parents or something chicken 
and pasta yeah but not in that form but still  
okay interesting I would have never thought 
that I would have liked fast food food but I  
will apparently I do so who knew very good place 
yeah first time in Jollibee, super impressed okay  
thank you now one more thing the total price 
for this for everything we have here it's
756. okay yeah it's actually good yeah especially 
the fact that we had a huge amount of food good  
okay that's um I think the end of the video thank
