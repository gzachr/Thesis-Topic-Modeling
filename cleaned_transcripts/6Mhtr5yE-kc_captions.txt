so i got
ten dollars on me and we want to see
how far we can stretch it
[Music]
so these ten dollars are gonna take us
all around town in manila from haircuts
to food to so much more and in order to
save a bit more of that money today's
video is sponsored by a rate punk the
best way to save money on your hotel
bookings but a bit more on that later
[Music]
now guys it's going to be 10 bucks which
is around 450 pesos of recording of this
video so we're going to take a bit of a
walk we're going to go probably also to
the chinatown we're now in intramuros
which as far as i understand is
considered to be like the main manila
town
and so i feel like today we're really
gonna see
the real manila and we're gonna see
how far
if anything
10 can get us
well there we go this one's not too bad
oh wow okay this one's about you what do
you have so we have
all i do is eat and sleep i mean that is
pretty much oh you need this one
happiness happiness
i do need some happiness in my life
okay so we're gonna be starting out our
video in front of one of the oldest
churches
in the philippines
and it's crazy i think it was built in
1571
so yeah
soon approaching the 500 year mark
we got some ice cream over here so let's
see hello how are you what type of ice
cream do we have pizza dessert oh nice
so what is this cheese cheese and this
abogado what is avogadro
like fruit fruit okay
okay so how much for one 40 pesos 40.
we're gonna get some nice ice cream i've
never heard of both flavors so we'll see
where that's gonna go
nice all right well well guys we're
gonna get our first dollar to use today
what did he say was the yellow yellow
thing i didn't know what the yellow
thing was but i think the green one is
avocado
i have no idea what that is
but it tastes pretty good actually so
there's the first
dollar investment
of the day honestly it tastes
really different like nothing like
gelato or anything like that
a little bit watery very very sweet but
it's not bad at all actually it's like
yeah so we're walking through a bit of
an old area we got some tricycles some
horses we've actually been debating
maybe hop on a horse for a video but
i don't know
honestly for me personally that's what
makes manila pretty interesting it's a
very very unique history in southeast
asia and walking through the streets you
really feel it like nowhere else in
southeast asia you're going to feel
these like spanish influences
like i don't know maybe it's not quite
correct but i like to call it the letter
vibes when i walk through the latin
vibes of southeast asia just like
absolutely every building has been
around here for a while
and i think we're gonna head to
chinatown right now
okay so over here we're getting into a
little bit of a more let's say
touristy chinatown area
so the boys actually got a hotel room
over here i'm still staying in pgc so
they have this amazing view actually on
the main
column of the church and talking about
hotels that's where we sit right now and
this is where raid punk comes in the
tool to hunt down the best hotel prices
on the internet so we all know this
feeling you're on the internet you try
to find a hotel and
even though you see the price feed on
booking.com agoda wherever it may be but
you know out there on the internet is a
better rate so the way to make sure that
you always get the best deals on hotels
it's very easy like step one you
download the rate punk extension
literally takes a few seconds completely
free no signups no nothing step number
two you just load one of your favorite
websites from me for example booking.com
you look let's say hotels in manila you
click on the hotel you might want to
book and bam you might see that they
have a cheaper rate for you and this is
exactly how rape punk works sometimes it
may be 10 20 but sometimes if you
compare the different websites you see
the difference can be quite huge so
saves you money gives you more budget to
travel sorry punk works on all the
popular booking websites expedia golda
tripp.com booking and so on and you can
install it on any of the major browsers
you know guys when raypunk reached out
to me i was thinking it's a really good
match because i show my hotels all the
time i also all the time make sure to
get the best deal and i know some of you
are traveling as well so i really
recommend for you to try it out yourself
it takes like a few seconds to download
it it's completely free as i said no
sign up no commitment or anything and
sponsors like great punk make it
possible for me to upload more videos
have them more frequently so by using my
link in the description you're also
supporting these videos on this note
let's get back and let's see how far we
can take these ten dollars
okay guys so we made it into chinatown
and it is supposed to be one of the
oldest china towns in the world and i
have to say just my first impression
already it's not like one busy market it
seems like a huge place we just walked
through the bridge and we really saw how
much
just there is you see kind of like the
chinese
style decorations starting out but i
think this is a little bit more just
like you know to make it a little bit
more of a touristy chinatown if you will
but if you turn around this is what i
love about philippines it's the real
deal we got another
freaking ancient basilica church
palace san lorenzo ruiz
city of manila
[Music]
and i feel like there's very very few
countries left where you can really feel
the dna of the place
it's like this is to some extent a
tourist place but at the same time we
haven't seen any tourists the whole day
it's all locals going about their daily
life
there's the come to the philippines
while you can because at some point
they're going to remove the jeepneys a
lot of it's just gonna disappear
while it is fairly touristy country
still it just feels so raw and real
what's up boys
cheers
cheers bro
nice nice bro
subscribe
more fun
and here looks like we're able to get
some food
i really want to have a drink first of
all
let's find a drink yeah
i'm gonna also get some food so
walking in super nice
yeah so let's see on the go snacks
okay can i get an uber
honey roast pork
and uh
coffee milk tea
okay guys we're gonna be going in for
the coffee milk tea
definitely can get some coffee right now
and this is wild so this is some type of
purple bun i think it's just the color i
think it's regular bread for the most
part but
never try that
so guys this is how i transport my money
here
i usually going for the coke zero but
we're way too caffeinated already
let's see so
orange
all righty let's pay for this right
in light
thank you
no thank you
thank you so much
okay guys so we're gonna position
ourselves a little bit on this uh
i don't know some type of volunteer
firefighter car
i was just so freaking thirsty we got a
right and light
i found some type of zero drink
oh
it tastes like pretty much sprite zero
so good so
special uber now so the total of this
was a
120 peso
which is pretty much three dollars
so as for now we're in 450 dollars five
dollars
for the day
we got a
purple bun
so in there it's supposed to be pork
that is just the white one
actually it's with bob i used to be a
big fan of it
honestly you really underestimate how
much calories these drinks have but i've
been working like a madman all day so
nice
[Music]
so guys chinatown is lighting up quite
nicely right now
so ali is filming a bit of a food video
and everything looks a little bit nicer
at night so it's kind of walking through
i mean
as of right now i spend like around five
dollars during the day just get a little
bit of snacks guys i really hope i can
find a bit of a barber today to clean up
a little bit
okay so it's getting a bit dark gonna
switch back to the dslr
uh let's walk over a little bit here let
me go on right yep
so honestly chinatown hello
you know when you're coming in the
church really impressive really really
cool
and it felt really cool there because
that was still the beginning of
chinatown but the moment you get into
the street of binondo
um it becomes a little bit tense you
know you see a little bit also people
living on the street and things like
that not that i minded but it's
definitely because it's kind of like a
tourist street so
that's kind of the full picture so i
personally prefer a little bit more
local and this is where we're going in
right now
we're heading into the kiyapu area
right next to it and you already see it
you know it just starts to get alive
right away
because chinatown i would say at the end
they still
at this point bit more of a tourist area
so kind of like tied down a little bit
so on the menu for today is still trying
to get a nice
haircut
started to rain a little bit
so this man is selling some eggs
might be the best protein source out
here
let's see oh
nice what do you got over there okay
which one which one's more popular
beef chicken chicken okay
hey guys this is
the furthest away from
wyatt
diaper is a life

fan

[Music]
okay guys
good
morning right now
from the roof this is a super local area
and this is a little bit the contrast of
manila this is i think also a little bit
the contrast
you have seen in today's video so it has
been a lot of fun has been an intense
day
me and ali i think uh
yeah did a nice tour through on one side
the old town and tramuros chinatown
and uh yeah as you always you know i
always want to share with you the full
experience i really love the chinatown
especially the church area if you go in
a little bit deeper it starts to get
touristy and if you go in a little bit
even deeper starts to get quite rough so
but at the same time manila
the more i walk around it the more i
feel like if you are traveling for
adventure if you just want to explore
unique destinations the more i find it
interesting in many ways and yeah going
to be staying here for another i think
four or five days
oh yeah i'm also hitting a workout right
now here on the roof
we gotta make sure to you know
no matter where you at i really would
have liked to skip this workout right
now but
you know
i'm not traveling just for pleasure or
vacation
i am building this life
and right now is a very intense let's
say session of filming a lot of
different videos
but
at the same time have to find the time a
little bit for yourself have to find the
time to stay a little bit in your
routine and the more challenging it is
the more let's say you can build the
reference experiences of still sticking
to your
certain let's say
agreements that you made with yourself
which for me is at least three workouts
a week no matter what so
let's get it
in yeah it's kind of nice so kind of
today i'm staying by myself just to get
a lot of work done and if you want to
get a little bit more of a behind the
scenes where i am right now what i'm
doing you're welcome to join me on
instagram and other than that
youtube
got a world to see
[Music]
so
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
and here you kind of feel like still the
remnants still kind of like the the
signs and
no it's not flowing too but too much
yeah that's [ __ ] sick i was thinking
