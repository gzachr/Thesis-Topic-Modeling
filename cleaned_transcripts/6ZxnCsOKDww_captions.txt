hey Michael Boot what's up I see you
everything's going good man Tokyo all
right Michael Michael boots in Tokyo
yeah all right Mike I've been to Japan
is a nice place
you know Mike the only thing on a life
by Japan is that they're very very high
very expensive us lil I've been there so
several times Tokyo is nice everything is
nice out there
beautiful and clean and fresh and the
people you know that's compared to the
people that's compared the Philippines
you know that just means the best of
course I'm biased yeah but as far as the
people are concerned in Japan I found
that they're a little bit more
conservative and not as friendly Hey but
the Philippines most families place in
the world for me so forth I've been
to alot of the southeastern Asian
countries man I've traveled all over the
world

gonna talk to you just just a few
minutes guys about where we headed on
our channel I know those of you that has
been with us for a while you know you've
seen a lot of different things lately
from us and that's where it's going
that's weird we're heading into some new
territory wayne johnson what's up my man
how you doing so we headed into a lot of
new territory and a lot of new areas
we've been stagnant for a long time but
we'll bring out a freakin out of that
stagnancy as you guys know I was one of
the first
vloggers african-american vloggers
broadcasting from the Philippines since
2015 I started this channel and since
that time man there's a ton of black
guys out here I can't keep up with him
it's so many but you gotta be i'ma tell
you you got some of them are great some
of them are great
okay I'm not I'm not trying to put none
of the everybody everybody contributes
in their own way to informing the
black American and that's not necessary
black America but American community how
good it is to live in the Philippines
okay so we don't want to discriminate
we're here for everybody but you have to
be discriminating as far as some of the
channels are out there guys because some
people will not tell you the full 411 on
everything they lhey're gonna
tell you stuff but they tell you
something that from what the good stuff
you know if you look at my channel I'm
gonna tell you the good bad and ugly
yeah I like to bring it to you straight
up of all different perspectives all
right so Michael says I got off early
today okay it's a holiday huh okay all
right Michael Manny then he said that's
how I found you go with searching black
guy the Philippines he came across your
channel yeah yeah I mean I was one of the
first ones out there but uh there's a
another now I gotta tell you there's
another couple called Yuri I thought I've
forgot her husband name but they were out
there before me but they were actually
they are actually broadcasting from the
United States okay they he has his wife
in the United States Dave they're not
they were not actually living here I was
one of the first that was actually
living here in the Philippines and
broadcasting here me and Lisa D so I'm
still here guys we got into a little
slump for a while for about maybe six to
nine months so that was I was I was
swamped I had a whole I hope you know I
run a lot of businesses I got got
swamped with business all right
and I did what I could to maintain a
channel but now I'm freed up
Lisa D took over eighty percent of the
stuff I was doing and so I'll bring it
up best in the channel now so you're
gonna be seeing videos
almost every day yeah almost every day
and it may not be a Philippine video but
it'll be something that will be
uplifting something that something that
you can take and say okay I got that I
feel you you know it's gonna be
something hard heart and live a heart of
something that you can identify what
that's what I'm trying to say and that
you can take and maybe take and use it
or if you can't use the inspiration and
the motivation in the video that you see
you can recommend it to somebody else
and share it that's what it's all about
sharing is caring and that's that's what
we're going to be doing going to be
doing old out of this new stuff okay
yeah Eric it was a URI and Bruce Bruce
that's his name
that's his name Bruce they're nice
couple right there and they're in
America the D you know let me tell you
this story about Lisa D and I least it'd
be okay
Lisa D was
every year seared visit her parents and
everything they and I asked her to marry
we got we got engaged okay
and I wanted to bring  LisaD back
to the United States of America I'm like
no, we get married you coming here I
can't I can't handle this Philippine
stuff now cuz I had come you know by 14
trips in about almost six years going
back and forth visiting visiting and she
wasn't the first person first for the
Filipina that I had met okay I admit other
Filipinas and during that time but she
was the one out of I was seven so she
was number seven and the best of them
all by far
okay so so I say look I'm gonna bring
you back home cuz I don't I don't wanna
be staying in the Philippines I mean it's okay here but I want you I want you to give us a
this she said I'll come, I'll come
so we greed on it  like that and we I was
getting ready to do the k1 visa
paperwork get you know k1 for those of
you that don't know k1 fiancee visa is
the visa that allows you to bring your
fiancee to United States you can make
arrangements to marry okay so that's
what I was gonna ready to do and then we
sat down one day we chat online she's
yard fine I like what's going on you see
all right I can't do it I can't do what
would you I can't I can't do it
you mean we are you trying to back out
of the engagement me she said no I
love you I said okay so once you post
what's going on I can't go to the yes I
said you can't go to the USA I mean I
said look that's our whole plan for you to
come to USA you have a
proper to United States no I'd like to
go there but I know that if I go there I
want to be away from my parents and I'm
not going to do well with it so I was
devastated because my whole thing was us living together in the U.S and I say I mean I really I mean
I like the Philippines is okay but as
far as me living here no that was out
the question that was out of the
question at the time because
was not my intention I was I wasn't
intending on living here and so when she
told me that I was like I don't know do
I need to continue with her or do I need
to leave her and goes oh I need acccept her and go on so I prayed about
everything I decided time to move make
some changes make some radical changes
so that's what we decided for me to move
here and they feel with her and when I
moved here it wasn't a like planned move
okay
I knew that I was going to eventually
move here because we agreed that I would
come live here with her back but as to
when that would happened we had no
specific date on it and so one year in
2014 I came to visit here December 24 to
be exact noon of Christmas Eve I came to
visit and I stayed I had it like a
two-week vacation on the job I was like
it was like three it was like three days
before us get ready to go home go back
to USA a lot now I'm not doing it she
said we're doing what I said I'm not
going back she said  what? said, I'm not
going back I'm gonna stay here he said
well you're not prepared I said I've
been a preparing for several years I got my
stuff together I just I'm not going back
so I called my boss emailed him up hit
him up let him know I'm out I'm done
resigned and I've been here ever since
me and Lisa D got married and we stayed
in a condo for about almost year then we
move into a subdivision where we have
three-bedroom house  two baths and
guys out there that are looking for a
slowdown it's nothing to rush into take
your time LsaD and I dated for years
online I got to know every part of her
personality you know I've seen all sides
of it you know the good the bad and the ugly I
seen it all and and that's what you need to
see that's what you need to experience
before you make the plunge and before
you make that commitment about marriage
and that kind of stuff now if you just
want to just you know be friends that's
good that's cool too but you should
always take your time when you're
dealing with a Filipina Filipinas are
special people and i know you guys seen my
videos you know how I feel about
Filipinas they are very special people
see ya a lot of changes Manny made a lot
of changes to channel and I'm doing some
things that are that's not consistent
with what I've been doing it for but
sometimes you have to take chances and
you have to break out of the mold so
when you when I do my videos you'll be
seeing a lot of different things not
just one type and you know in the past
I've done a variety of different videos
you know I've done historical videos
I've done informational videos I've done
relationship videos and that one of my
specialty is this relationship you guys
know I have a BS in psychology and a
masters and so relationship did
counselling for years and did that I'm
like a jack-of-all-trades you see he
said well I thought you did computer
yeah I did
I've done a whole lot of stuff so um one
thing I think anybody to have a youtube
channel should do know it's on down
what's up bro I hate you I see you wait
I said yeah all right Michael I
understand
take care bro next time but yeah if you
have a youtube channel you should do
what you like doing you should do what
you enjoy doing because it's another expresion  of you.
and the people that view your
videos begin to know you as a person
they begin to trust you as a person and
at the same time you begin to know just
your subscribers and your fans and
like Manny I feel like Manny is a real
close friend and man I've known for
years you know we've never been in
person but I;ve known him for years I mean and I was
just one of many people like Manny I
know from from the channel yeah and so
it's good to communicate and be who you
are that's what I'm am I mean the way
you see me right now
the we met in person you see I've been
same way I'm the same way I'm just
another ordinary guy just like everybody
else at this like you guys I mean and I
don't put on in the ears I don't try to
fake I don't try to be phoney this is
this is why this is this is the way I am
and if that's the only way I know how to
do it yeah man man yeah man he says I
feel the same way that's why I Love You
Tube community
yeah community managed the YouTube
people are great and if you show an
interest in them they were story
interesting you they will support you
that's a no no doubt about it they will
support you but the live streaming thing
I'm just getting into it I've done a few
of it a little bit of it but I'm doing
oh I'm starting a whole lot more I'm
gonna develop a schedule for it maybe
two or three days a week based on based
on my schedule cuz guys I tell you I'm
putting out a lot of videos and if you I
don't know if you know about video
production shooting or man you know this
man he goes man you got a challenge and
I let me tell you guys remember to check
out Manny's channel I want everybody that's
a subscriber friend of mine check out
Manny's Vlog channel if you interested
in information about  New York City
 information information
restaurants entertainment Manny he's got
an awesome channel I'm serious
I learned stuff about New York
that I've never he takes you there he
takes you in the back alleyways a places
I've ever seen I've been to New York
several times some of the places he
showed me I'm never see him I thought
what they got that in there yeah you
check man he's young
but yeah it's an awesome thing to be
here to Philippines and it's awesome to
be speaking to you guys right now I know
you you guys had a whole all you guys
have a lot of schedules we got things to
do
- you know sit down and chat with me you
know I know you've done you guys are
busy but I thank you free time I really
do
let's see what we've got the comments we
got here now this is just a Q&A session guys
so he gotta question me got any question
about LisaD  put it out there I'm not
gonna hold nothing back
is it being real and giving it to you
straight up that's how what I do but
yeah this since I was being a youtuber
since 2015 and it's been a blessing open
up a hole me I've got to do things that
I wouldn't have done without the channel
I've gotten notoriety I've been on a lot
of articles and interviews and it's it's
just a blessed and so blessing to report
all over the world the Philippines is
not just for Caucasian Americans I mean
I mean before before then I went through a
huge life changing divorce okay
and after that divorce and I was married
to an American I'm like it's got to be
something different it's got to be
different women types and that's when I
started looking in the Philippines and
that's when I started dating online and
after dating online and seeing how the
Philippine side was I was like man I got
it
maybe it is something something here and
that's what got me curious about moving
or getting involved with the Filipina
now you can say well there's a lot of
Filipinas in the United States why not
get involved with one there rather
didn't have to go to the Philippines
well I could have done that but I think
that you will find that the Filipinos in
the United States are more Americanized
if I could use that term and they're not
once because once a Filipina is out of
her native country she goes to the
United States or whatever they
sort of change okay they get acclimated to
the new surroundings new environment and
then they wind up acting  different so
that's one thing you can watch out for
now some not all of them some of them do
and I'm getting ready to do a video about that very soon so be on the lookout for that
some of them change like overnight was like I'm American now you can tell me nothing
you think I'm kidding but I'm serious
that's how some of them change a change man
they really do so you know and that's
 that's another blessing for me
because I plan on bringing LisaD here and I'm so thankful that it
worked out worried she didn't have to
come she she didn't actually want to
come you know so you gotta be careful
when you bring feel opinion let's see
what messages we got here
okay Lord Sanda you're getting ready
to come to Cebu Alright I understand that
okay
okay they see seek nor Santa said they
changed somewhat but they do have a
community in Chicago and some cling to
their customs that's awesome that's
awesome
that's awesome now on the flip side and
that is just as well I've met okay I had
a couple that came here married couple
they were from uh Seattle now this couple
this guy was african-american and he was
in the military met his wife here and
they were married they moved to the to
united to Chicago to excuse me to
Seattle move to the back to USA and they
were married for 25 years now this
couple had never come back to the
Philippines after she's married so a few
years last year last year it came back
he retired okay he retired from the police
force police retired and then he came he came back to Cebu got in
touch with me said BobbyD coming
down wanr to meet you know we met you know you
talk we chitchat glad to see him he said
we want to help me help I helped to find
a place to live I helped him with
someone to help them find a place to
lve and so everything was cool and then
as
or you plan on staying here for good?
I'll say yeah he's said yeah i'm retiring here
his wife was happy too.  a few momths later
they were getting ready to head  back
out to the United States I said
what? you just got here
what's going on man found out his wife
was homesick for the United States she
has a couple of daughters there and she
was missing them and he had gotten her
board here as well because he hadn't
have a lot of stuff to do so sounds like
man you gotta give it a chance you just
can't
yes any more time than this so they
stayed here for about nine months
 almost a year and then they left
I told I warned him before  I said
this is what's gonna happen, i  said you're gonna go
to the United States and then you're
gonna come right back
geez what's up what's up I I see you out
there I say you're gonna go to United
States and you're gonna come right back
because you're gonna recognize what you
your lifestyle you here here was better
than you had the United States said ah
my wife's always crying every night
I gotta go we gotta go us okay so they
leave back they go back to United States
and they stay maybe three months hey
guys they're right back here yeah
they're right back here I mean you can
you've got to understand we learned when
you find someplace it's good for you
hang there and stay there I really in
this place is a nice place to live it
really is and I'm like okay you should have  listen to me she listened oh oh oh you
nice plce is beautiful but the best
country is america no question no doubt
about that
so no don't anybody doubt my Americans
status I'm proud of America
yes serve my country but there are other
countries out there that can offer you
some things that  America can't you
know the same time we don't have to give
up our citizenship but you still be
proud to be in here wherever you are I
pay taxes just like you guys everything
yeah so I it's gettin it's gettin down
to wine the downtime it's been nice
chitchat with you you guys be lookin out
so because I'm planning on doing live
streaming maybe two to three times a
week two times a week and I don't have a
set schedule yet so you'd be looking out
for the broadcast notices Steven Dye
what's up what's up I see you all right
you guys would love your content Bobby
my wife is homesick for the Philippines
after three years here in Atlanta has
made very few friends here even though I
encourage it
yeah I know Steven that's that's one
reason why I did we didn't bring Lisa do
you new to the United States because she
told me that would not be good for her
and she said wouldn't be that's addition
specifically exactly what she said it's
not gonna be good for my spirit that's
exactly it and when she told me that I
would flabbergast I'm like whoa
that was deep to me she said it's not
gonna be good for my spirit you know and
I when she said that to me I'm like okay
I was sort of ticked off about it at
first I said man when he told me we were
already planning on you coming to United
States you won't tell me you were not
coming and when she said was not gonna
be cooking my spirit it touched my heart
all that man it's deep so I had to I had
to you know pray about it we decided
that I need you to come here I didn't
want to come here this was the last
thing on my mind
I mean I've come here to Jesus you know
like you guys some of you guys that that
you come and visit have nice because you
go home that's what I would nowLOrd Sanda says his wife is from Mindannao
for those few weeks of one o the cebuano
and language or dialect itself there are
other dialects you know an accent said
at LisaD speaks English she speaks so
Cebuano and she speaks Tagalog and even
though she speaks Cebuano the one you can come
out here and speak to somebody else
weeks Cebuano and may notunderstand
you because of an accent at some Cebuano words are different in different areas
so it's it's a communication issue I'll
be doing I'll be doing man I'll be doing
another video about communicate as well
but yes communication wayne johnson  take
care bro then let's see gradually touch
bases with us yeah but then I'll be
doing a video very shortly on the
communication as well but you guys if
you guys want to variety of videos as
Philippine videos as well as
motivational videos keep them around
hang around stick around
stay on the channel but that's what's
coming up I'll be doing videos almost
every day not fluent yet Manny I'm
trying to I speak Spanish and English
and Cebuano not fluent in Cebuano
not fluent in Spanish no knowledge if
it's a challenge it's something that
keeps me keeps me active and keeps me
working he's mind  mine right - okay
you said Lord Sanda says she seems
to get along with everyone that's good
now Lord sander does your wife work is
she working out there where you are or
she not working because working it makes
a big difference
Manny says he speak in Spanish
okay okay Manny your wife doesn't work
there that's that's a huge problem Lord
Santa
your wife isn't working she has no
outlet okay except for you
and Filipina has to philippine is a very
very social people okay
they thrive on community and they thrive
on togetherness and when that that
option is taken away
and then they tend to go into a shell and
they tend to regress and so you wouldn't
you;re the head so you wanted to make some changes there bro you gonna have to get
her involved with some things maybe she
if you want to but you have filipinas
are very very social people but as you
guys know I think Filipinas are some of
the most powerful women in the world and
I keep saying it because it's true and
you guys that know that are married to
the Filipinasyou guys that have girlfriends
you know the same thing all right guys
