Filipino food has enjoyed quite
the exposure in recent years.
And I know this not because of
national recognition
and accolades,
but because I'm hearing
and seeing more
and more people
being exposed to it
beyond just chicken
adobo and lumpia.
But this kind of recognition
once faced opposition
from the mainstream
and Filipinos as well,
but it doesn't mean
it's not delicious.
I'm here to taste the details
of Filipino-American food.
Growing up as a
Filipino immigrant,
in school I was embarrassed
about the home-cooked meals
I'd have for lunch,
squirming in my seat
as I heard the
"Eww. What's that?",
"That smells funny"
comments.
This experience isn't unlike
what plenty of the chefs
behind the Filipino
food movement
of today have gone through.
As Filipino-Americans,
these chefs were exposed to
other kinds of foods growing up.
The results are a fusion
of dishes cooked
from the lens of
American-influenced
second generation chefs
and entrepreneurs.
Here at Lasa, brothers
Chad and Chase Valencia
bring cheffed up sensibilities
and techniques,
along with the influence
of growing up
Filipino-American,
to the table.
This might be a lot of people's
first Filipino food experience
but we also definitely
remind them that it's
blatantly non-traditional
and it's Filipino inspired,
you know,
that we're Fil-Am
and we're second generation.
Is there still some pushback
from some Filipinos?
When we started, there
was a lot of pushback.
We grew up conditioned to taste
our food in a certain way.
To kind of challenge those
perceptions and those flavors,
those memories,
those attachments...
Yeah.
...you know, that's-,
that's a lot.
We had to also see
where we could push
the envelope on certain dishes.
We can't do too far out,
we've got to do kind of
a little balance
so that way the foundation
of Filipino food is there
but you still see
the creativity.
I think we realized that
there is a mountain
and we're just starting to
climb that mountain.
I think we're just
trying to put
our flag on top
of that mountain.
Yeah, we're going to have to
come back down but
our flag's going to be up there,
you know what I mean?
When do you think it's time to
celebrate Filipino food like?
Once your average
Angelino family is
considering going to a Filipino
restaurant for dinner.
Mexican, Italian, Korean,
Vietnamese, Chinese.
Filipino food is not part
of that conversation yet.
So once Filipino cuisine is
part of that conversation,
so I think that's when
we did our job well.
My mom used to like
slice these baguettes...
Uh-huh.
...and then she would put like
spaghetti sauce on it
and put some mozzarella
and some pepperoni,
so that's a pizza.
And we were like...
Just [indiscernible]
versions, right?
Yeah.
It's a very admirable effort.
It tastes...
It's not the same taste.
It tastes great
but it's not the same food.
It's not the same thing.
At Frankie Lucy Bakeshop,
Kristine De La Cruz
used the sudden appeal for ube,
the sweet purple yam used
in Filipino desserts,
as a launch pad for
unique baked goods,
pastries and sweets
that incorporate familiar
Filipino flavors.
We just got so much love
for our ube stuff
and they just come in
for the ube stuff.
But I'm still trying to
force-feed them like
other flavors.
"Well, try this one,"
and they're like,
"Hmm, I just like the ube."
To be completely honest,
we do get the Filipinos
that say, "This is not
what I grew up."
So I'm like,
"Absolutely, auntie.
This is not what you
grew up with."
It's not supposed to be.
It's not supposed to be.
It's like it's basically
a new creation.
It's something
that's totally different.
I just hope that at the very
least our food is able to
not only just break
the mainstream barrier
but also break
the Filipino barrier
where people are a
little bit more accepting...
For sure.
...of the Filipino-American
versions of it.
Here at Ma'am Sir,
they have a vibrant
cocktail program using
Filipino ingredients
and inspiration.
Since I grew up in
the Philippines,
I always knew I wanted
to bring a part of
the Philippines here.
This also ports
a popular restaurant
that is packed most nights,
which is something that
I wouldn't have pictured
growing up.
We're in America after
all, you know.
If I wanted a Filipino
restaurant
with Filipinos coming in,
I'd put it up in
the Philippines.
Yeah.
But we're in America and
that's what we have to do,
serve the people.
Once you win the trust,
people are like,
"All right, whatever it is,
it's probably dope."
Kind of like this
purple old-fashioned,
it tastes like ube.
We want to educate
without educating.
Is this new face of
Filipino cuisine
that's the product of
Filipino-Americans applying
their experiences
and interpretations,
is it Filipino enough?
Well, that really
shouldn't matter
because what we're seeing
out of cities like Houston,
San Francisco,
Chicago, and more,
is an exciting take
on the cuisine
that's generating
mainstream attention.
Nowadays, I'm reassured that
I probably won't get teased
over the scent of
my chicken adobo.
Instead, I'm expecting to
slide a plate over to share.
