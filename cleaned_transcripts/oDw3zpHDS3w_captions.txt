And then we have here the Longanisa another Spanish term.
It’s like a sausage that we have adapted.
There’s countless of versions in the Philippines.
Every region has their own version of longanisa.
And this is the garlicky…
I want to say something but I’ll go along with it yes.
Lot of various versions and sizes of sausages.
These are great looking..
Yeah, they look good…
Have you had any salted eggs before?
Nope.
The white one is really salty.
Oh wow!
Wow!
Woooh!
Ohhhh!!!
Thank you for giving us the heads up there because I was like this..
I know I would eat the whole thing like it’s just an egg.
Hello!
Say hi Kayla, say hi to uncle.
Hi, how are you?
Say hi to uncle.  -Oh hello guys, how are you?
Morning!
Yes, hello what’s your name?
Give me five.  -Yeah.
Alright!
Say hi uncle Bobby.
Hi uncle Bobby!
Hi Mikayla, how old are you?
Three.
Here’s my toys.
These are your toys.
Hi!
Go say hi!
Hey sweetheart.
Hi!
Wow, she’s beautiful!
Can I come in?
Have a sit first we’re still prepping.  -Hi!
Nixalina, nice to meet you!  -Nice to meet you.
Alright, we have here Bobby Tonelli and Nixalina to join us on this Filipino breakfast boodle feast.
Now guys, any experience about Filipino food?
Absolutely none.
Not even Jollibbe?
No.
Wow!
You gotta venture Jollibee.
So you’ve tried Jollibee?
I’ve tried Jollibee, I’ve been to the Philippines a few times.
I was shooting out there called Celebrity Car Wars.
And then I hosted a beauty pageant.
Filipinos love beauty pageants, I found out.
They’re crazy.
It’s massive!
It’s like a rock concert.
Any specific dish that you remember you ate before?
Pork x4
Most of the dishes here are pork as well.
I figured as much.
Okay, so we have here different types of meat.
Okay.
That goes with garlic rice and eggs for breakfast.
Garlic rice for breakfast…
It supposed to go with the meat.
So we have here Beef Tapa.
It’s like a dried and cured beef.
Okay.
So, in the past you know we need to preserve food so we do a lot of drying and a lot of curing.
Yes.
But the modern days it can be saucy but it’s still cured with salt and some spices.
And then we have here Tocino.
It’s like the Spanish bacon but this is kind of like our version of..
Closest to Charsiu.
So Tocino it’s like pork or pork belly, it’s usually fatty and fried.
And then we have here the Longanisa, another Spanish term.
It’s like a sausage we have adapted, there’s countless of versions in the Philippines.
Every region has their own version of Longanisa.
And this is the garlicky..
I want to say something but I’ll go along with it yes.
Lot of various versions and sizes sausages.
These are great looking..
Yeah, they look good…
If you’ve never had garlicky sausage before, this is it.
Beside the garlic sausage we have here the red looking sausage.
Well well there’s, like you said all different types of sausages.
Yeah we’ve got two different types of sausage here.
So this is the red sausage.
This is very iconic and classic hotdog.
Oh!
Okay.  -In America, we call these hotdogs.
Yeah x2
We just don’t have a bread.
Yeah.
Yeah, I was about to say where’s the color come from?
I don’t know why it’s red, I think it’s just coloring.
Every child, every person from all ages eat this with rice or with our Filipino spaghetti.
You will see it in every fiesta.
We usually do it in a skewer and we put marshmallow hotdog, marshmallow hotdog.
Well you guys really get into it, I’ve never done a marshmallow hotdog before.
That’s an interesting combination, sweet and savory like ultimate right there.   -Yeah.
And we have here Spam.
Philippines has been under the Americans for around 50 years.
The American army has brought them for like their food.
But then you know Filipinos started seeing it and we’re like…
Okay this is something new and then we liked it, we paired it with rice and egg and it’s become breakfast as well.
It’s garlic rice and we call it Sinangag.
Sinangag.
You will see this in almost every restaurant the combination.
The Tapa, so we call it Tapsi because it’s Tapa and Sinangag.
And then with itlog it’s egg.
So it’s called Tapsilog.
Tapsilog.
If you want Hotdog.
Hotsilog.
And with the Longanisa, guess.
Long…si…long.
Longsilog.
When do you have to wake up to prepare this for breakfast?
Around 6:30 in the morning.
And this is like feeding three people size or ..
It’s like for a family and relatives coming.
Because  n Filipino culture anyone can come.
If there’s a feast, then you will just be surprised “Oh the neighbors are coming.”
Ohh! I love that!
Come on in!
Who are you? Oh nice to see you come on in.
Yeah just people flooding.
We have here also the Omelette with tomatoes and onions.
And then we here some salsa, some chilies if you want.
And everything goes with vinegar and banana ketchup.
Banana ketchup?
I’m sorry what?
Ketchup is huge in America right?
Yeah, we call it Heins.
When Ketchup has been brought to the Philippines we didn’t have much tomatoes.
Or if there are it’s expensive.
So we had to produce something with what we have in abundance which are bananas.
So we had to make banana ketchup.
Oh and it’s hot and spicy as well.
I’ve never had a hot and spicy banana.  -this is a version of it.
This is going to be an interesting meal.
I want to try this.
Okay, I’m going to try it as well.
Am I using the wrong hand?
it's okay you can use your right if you’re right handed.
It was nice and sweet, that’s nice right.
Mmm…
It’s chewy.  -Yeah.
It’s really nice.
The garlic rice is good, very garlicky.
That’s how we like it.
Good thing I’m not a vampire.
It’s also really hard to eat right through your hands right.
It is.
You take your meat then you put it on top of your rice.
You form a kind of like a small mountain.
So you do it.
So it should look like this.
And you push it with your thumb when your about to eat it.
I’m using the meat as a fork.
That works.
It’s very good with the rice.
Let’s try the Beef Tapa.  -Tapa.
Low carb is not this meal.
Is this Keto friendly?
It’s good but after that.
Yeah
That is still my..  -Yeah I’m with you on that.
You’re still with Tocino?
Yeah.
A little drier.
So you with Tocino over Tapa.
Yeah so far.
You pick your sausage, the garlic or the red.
I’m going for this.
I’ll go for this one.
Alright.
Not bad.
Ketchup.
Oh yeah, the vinegar brings out, it brings it out.
Is it different, really different?
No.
No? Taste like Ketchup?
Weirdly the Ketchup taste like Ketchup.
And we don’t do really overly spicy because Filipinos in general don’t eat spicy.
So chilies are always on the side.
It’s just got a little bit of a kick.
How do I put, can I put it on there?
Yeah x3.
Just pour it on top.
Oh okay.
With your rice.
Oh okay.
Whoa!
Its got kick.
Got a little kick.
That’s not too bad actually.
It’s not unhandleable.
Is that even an English word?
The word of the day, unhandleable.
Unhandleable?   Yeah, but it’s not, it’s not unhandleable.
I’m going to mix sausages and sauce.
I’m going to do that.
No problem.
I’m going rogue but..   -Yeah!
You’re off the grid right now.
Yeah, I like the Ketchup!  -The Ketchup is actually really good
I’m gonna try this, I’m gonna mix this up too.
Mmm…
When you said banana ketchup I was like oh but it doesn’t taste anything like it.
Which is really nice.  -Yeah.
That’s good.
So far which one’s your favorite?
I think the brown.
Yeah the brown is more hearty.
It just feels more like an actual sausage.
Yeah it does right?
The hotdog just feels like a hotdog, like there’s nothing wow about it.
It’s like a fresh and then between a processed.  -Yes, that’s exactly, that’s how I would put t.
Yeah.
Have you had any salted eggs before?
Nope!
In the Philippines, the shell is usually red just to distinguish that it’s salted egg compared to the white normal egg.
Oh interesting.
This one is not Filipino made, it’s made here but it’s like almost the same.
How is it salted?
I don’t know how they do it, some versions they bury it in the ground.
Some versions they soak it in salt water for about a month or two.
With the shell on?
With the shell on.
See, so I wasn’t crazy asking that question.
Alright girl!
Try small portions first because it’s too salty the white one.
It’s really salty.
Oh wow!
Wow!
Woooh!
That’s like 5000 millligrams of salt.
Ohhhh!!!
Thank you for giving us the heads up there because I was like this..
I know I would eat the whole thing like it’s just an egg.
Oh man that would have been like.
Yeah it would have come straight back out.
Wow that’s a lot of salt man.
I can’t cope with the.  -Holy cow.
Have you tried salted egg prawns or salted egg anything with salted egg sauce?
Yeah, salted egg chicken wings.
It’s from this, so it’s really rich that they make it into a sauce.
That’s really salty.  -Yeah.
You know what I’m going right back to this chicken.
Yeah.
Yeah just to kind of cut that salt out.
I think it’s safe to say between these this is the least favorite so far.
Okay.
Do you eat a whole one of those like in one go or ..
No not in one go.
You eat stuff then you eat this, and then you go back to the salsa.
I think you need some salsa.
Bring on the salsa!
Yeah.
Oh wow!   -You eat it together.
The salted egg man.
Yeah that was really, that’s… I’m never gonna have that one again.
Sorry.
I’m not sorry.
Maling.
I don’t think I’ve ever had spam either.
I’ve had spam fries once.
That’s interesting.
This is Maling, it’s like a Chinese brand that is famous in the Philippines.
Mmm you’ll like it with salsa.
Looks like we’re going rogue.
It is yum!
This pretty good.  -Even I don’t like spam.
Yeah neither I, I actually kind of like it.
You know spam fries, they make fries out of this as well.
Can I have more of the hot and spicy.   -Okay
It’s good right? it’s kind of good, I might buy a  bottle after this thing.
Where do you buy this stuff at?
Lucky plaza.
Not sponsored by Lucky Plaza.
This episode is not sponsored by Lucky Plaza.
Which dipping or side was your favorite?
Ketchup.
Salsa is good though.
Yeah it is.  -It’s fresh.
But I feel like I need a taco with it.
But none of this for me is breakfast.  -No it’s not.
It’s very alien to eat this at this time.
This is lunch or dinner.
Yeah, I agree.
I’m with you on that.
Rice is good but yeah it’s not a breakfast dish.
I’m with you on that.
And this is legit breakfast for us.
Yeah.
Like big breakfast.
We don’t eat cereal for breakfast, I mean if there’s pancke and then there’s this, we choose this.
I would be the size of a house if I was eating this for breakfast.
Because it’s all quite like fried fatty stuff right.  -Yes.
Next, you gotta try the really simple omelette.
Try it with rice because we eat it with rice.
Of course.
Everything with rice.
And banana ketchup.
Ooh..
Yeah this is pretty breakfasty actually.
Yeah, this is the most breakfast thing I think.
And the fried egg.
Also, Americans have spam for breakfast do they not?
I never had but maybe some do.
Before going to work or school you have this big breakfast in here. -Wow!
You’re ready for the day.
I’m ready for a nap!
I’m definitely gonna keep eating this.
That’s good.   -Yeah.
Tocino, number one.
Oh absolutely delicious! -Yeah.
I agree.
But we  got a sweet tooth.
Between the sausages is the Longanisa right?
Longanisa.
But I have to say you’re a very good chef.
I mean every Filipino can do this.
It’s just special in a way that we always gather as a family.
That’s nice, the community aspect of it.
Yeah.  -I like that a lot, I didn’t have that.
Do you drink coffee?
I can’t handle the coffee the local stuff.
This is worse than that isn’t it?
It shouldn’t be.
But it’s a stronger type of Filipino coffee but it’s not as strong as the local coffee here.
Okay, because that one like when I had that coffee I was like “what is going on!”
This is very interesting what is this called?
It’s a drip coffee and it’s made in the Philippines, grown there in Batangas somewhere in the South of Manila.
Okay.
Stupid question, but do you have it with milk or sugar or just as is?
Do you have your coffee with it?
I will taste it as is.
So you’re not huge on coffee but on liquor?
Oh yes.
Yes I’m huge coffee, I’m huge on both liquor and coffee.
But I’m a latte girl.
You’re an Italian so I assume espresso is good for you.
Espresso good, cappuccinos good, all is good.
Yeah I love coffee, everyday coffee!
Cheers!
Okay.
Yeah!
That works.  -Yeah!
It smells stronger that what I thought it would be.  -Yeah same.
I had in my head like the local coffee.
The local here is really.
It’s a lot smoother like..  -Yeah.
Still need some milk?
100%!
Bring on the milk.
Is that salt?
No, it’s white sugar.
Because I’ve had enough of this egg.
That egg right there gave me enough salt content for the next month.
I can’t believe you get through that, that’s an intense egg exprerience.  -Yeah.
It’s like gargling salt when you have a sore throat., it's that!   -Oh my god, yes!
I can’t believe you get through that, that’s an intense egg exprerience.  -Yeah.
It’s like gargling salt when you have a sore throat., it's that!   -Oh my god, yes!
Oh that’s interesting.
Do you want milk?  -No, that's ok.
I feel like you do but you want to man up.
You do don’t you?
Actually a little bit of milk would be good.
Oh here we go  you stoop at my level.
Yeah, the milk and sugar actually helps it out, kind off cuts it a bit, it’s good, very good.
Balance.
Yeah, the milk and sugar actually helps it out, kind off cuts it a bit, it’s good, very good.
Balance.
Good balance yeah.
I make good life choices, no.
Can I eat more meat?
Yeah, sure!
I want more of this, I’m gonna keep eating this..  -It’s good right.
Yeah, I’m obsessed with it.
This quite too oniony for me and the eggs are too salty but everything else, yeah.
Do different households have different things on their table?
It’s almost the same, it’s like your English breakfast.
A lot of things we English do not do well right but full English breakfast…
Because the rest of the food is not that fanstastic.
But.
Fish and chips.  -Yeah.
It’s not bad.
Sea side fish and chips.
But you know for the majority of the breakfast where it’s at?
Yeah
And the Shepherd’s pie.
Oh! Toad in the hole.
Wookh! -Shepherd’s pie.
But everything else we suck.
Do you want to chase it down with some fruits?
The only thing I’ve chased down is alcohol ever, so chasing..
We don’t have alcohol.
I’m gonna chase down the mango.
That’s good, good coffee.  -Wow.
Finished.
Yeah I’m wide awake right now.
Yeah I might have another one.
That’s actually really good.
Can I have another one?
Wow!
Yeah!
See I knew it.  -Yeah look at that.
He’s the male version of me.
Filipino’s in general don’t drink strong coffee.
Okay.
We always have instant coffee.
Kopiko.
Kopiko, this brand is really from Indonesia but it’s popular in the Philippines.
So what you just gave us is that strong coffee to you guys or is that stronger than that?
That’s strong coffee from the South of Manila, mostly get it from there.
Generally Filipino’s would just drink 3-in-1.
Right.
This mango is good.
Oh!
It’s mango season that’s why.
I’m butchering the mango.
This is why your daughter was like “Mango! x3” right?
Yeah
I get it.
I’ve never had drip coffee before either.
I didn’t actually know what it was.
Really?
This is like more modern.
We don’t normally do this.
This is from the Split Bean.
Barako.
Barako coffee.
While you’re having your second cup of joe.
Oh hell yeah!  -Oooh!
The energy levels just jumped up like five notches.
She’s like YEAH!
But I understand coffee in the Philippines is probably not that strong, that comes from America.
Americans have some of the worst coffee n the world, sorry guys.
Well it’s basically dirt water or like brown water.
Isn’t it Starbucks from America?
Yeah but they’re improving.
Britsh is also…
Is it like brown water?
I grew up on instant coffee, nescafe instant coffee.
But you’re more on tea right?
Yeah English tea.
And you put milk on your tea as well right?  -Yeah
I shouldn’t have served them second cup of coffee.
No, totally it’s great!
It’s fine!
I’m great x3.
It’s really getting hot in here.
Nix, any final message in your first experience of Filipino breakfast on a boodle feast?
I didn’t think I would like it as much as I did.
I’ve never eaten with hands before, but it’s quite comforting and nice.
Just because I’m not a breakfast person it’s just feel like a heavy breakfast.
Salty, garlicky, oniony, like the flavors are quite intense.
That being said, I’m her for the outrage.
I would definitely have eaten all that meat, that’s delicious.
And the spam is lovely as well.
Tocino, just remember the word, yeah you had Tocino.
Tocino.
Tocino love.
Sorry I forgot, Banana Ketchup, it’s a vibe!
Yeah right, exactly.
It’s delicious.
Literally I’m with you, the Tocino started it off and it was just like…
You hit it at the top end.  -Yeah.
And I think everything else was okay but that Tocino, Boom!
Maybe if we’d eaten inside out.
Maybe so.
So I reckon start off from the inside out.
Yeah and with the Tocion then you’re like oooh…
So it’s Tocino and Banana Ketchup.
And the coffee.
Coffee is good.
Barako coffee.
Thank you Barako coffee
Oh it’s sponsored by the Split bean who brings in Barako coffee.
Thank you Split bean.
My turn.
I’m kind of with you on exactly what you said.
We’re like two peas in a pod on this one.
Tocino number one.
Spam or Maling?
Maling.
You make it sound very exotic.
Maling.
This is actually, I kind of like this Omelette, it’s very Spanish.
Kind of reminds me of you know when I grew up in Las Vegas that little Spanish vibe to it.
With the onions and a little bit of tomatoes inside, kind of nice.
The mangoes, phenomenal.
Mango season of course and Barako coffee.  -Yeah.
You can never go wrong with Barako coffee.
When you say garlic rice I was like uhmmmm…
Garlic for breakfast but actually really nice.  -That’s true.
And it’s brown rice, healthier.
I call this tan rice.
