If you think Manila is like 
any other capital city in the world,
like Tokyo is in Japan,
that's not exactly true.
It's actually a metro area 
with 16 cities inside it
So while there are places
that look like this,
this is also a part of Manila.
Just got in someone's photos.
And in this video, I'm going to show you the fanciest parts
of Manila Metro, BGC and Makati.
So I'm still in Manila,
and now I'm going to
what is supposedly
one of the fanciest parts
of Southeast Asia.
Makati.
-Hey man
Oh, this is nice.
-Yeah.
-These are our beautiful ladies.
Hi.
-Hi.
It’s pretty nice.
Chill area it seems.
There’s video games and a pool table.
And a foosball table.
-So, you just need to tap this card
at any of the elevators
-And then press your floor number
And...
Thank you. 
-Thank you.
Salamat
This gentleman is assisting me to my room.
Okay.
-Here’s your room
Thank you. 
-Enjoy your stay, sir.
Wow! nice.
Okay.
-Here’s your luggage.
Okay.
This is...
nice.
So I guess this is technically a hostel.
You know in hostels,
the private rooms are...
...usually not the best, but this one is...
...pretty nice. Pretty amazing.
There's this window
which is locked, I guess.
So this is not a balcony
Here you can see Makati.
There's a river and a bridge way over there.
In the distance right over there.
But, yeah, this is pretty sick.
Let's see what else is in there.
Man, this AC feels so nice
after, like, three days with no AC.
There's a room here.
I don't know. Let’s see.
Maybe this is like another room here
that I'm not supposed to access.
Okay, let's see what else.
Think I’m gonna have some coffee right now.
Some instant coffee.
Is this cake?
Let's try out this cake or whatever this is.
Definitely. Definitely a cake.
Making a mess.
Delicious.
Can't believe I'm so hungry because I just ate
that massive portion of beef stew pares.
This is delicious.
So, there’s a huge mirror.
This is nice.
Sink
Let’s see the bathroom.
There are more mirrors.
I like this.
Yeah. Nice little bathroom.
Hot water.
That's going to be nice
after like, few days of cold showers.
Bed is pretty spacious.
It's going to be hard going somewhere else after this.
All right. I think I'm going to go
check out the rooftop area now.
Well this is a pretty nice view.
Oh, it is a hot day.
I think Manila is going through 
a heat wave right now.
Well definitely feels like it
because it's 35 degrees and...
very, very humid. 35 degrees Celsius.
I'm still in Makati.
Found out I'm in the Koreatown of Manila.
This place is called Poblacion.
Which I think means a settlement in Spanish.
And you kind of see some Korean restaurants
right next to the hotel or hostel where I'm staying.
So there's apparently this
food market on Saturdays.
that's like out in a park
somewhere up in this area.
So now I'm going to go check that out.
You know, it might not seem like it
if you're in a Malate
or in Manila proper,
But once you're in Makati,
it becomes pretty obvious that Manila is like...
one of the wealthiest regions
in this whole part of Asia.
and one of the most populous cities.
And it's become wealthy
because of its very strong
service sector.
Like I said in the last video,
because of the American occupation,
to this day,
there are a lot of cultural similarities
with the U.S. and the West 
and a lot of Western ideals
that are followed here.
Also, the people here
speak amazing English,
which makes this a great place
for hiring offshore people.
And the Philippines has become 
the offshore accounting center of the whole world.
which must be related to how many
huge bank buildings that
you see all around me everywhere.
I think I see the street food market 
right in front of me.
There's like tables and stuff
right in the middle of the street, too,
so people can sit down and eat.
So different kinds of fast food.
Dried fish.
Oh man it extends
all the way over there.
Is this juice or what?
-Yes.
Okay.
-This one is coconut juice.
Lemonade?
And what is this?
-Buko Pandan. Yes.
Buko Pandan? What is that?
-It has condensed milk.
It’s green?
-Yeah, it's green, because of Gulaman.
Okay. Can I try one?
How much is it?
-We have 50, 60.
15? 
-Regular and large.
Give me a regular one.
Not a large one, ok?
So it's called Buko Pandan.
What's inside it?
Condensed milk?
-Coconut.
Coconut.
-And jelly with milk.
Ok.
Coconut and jelly with milk. Okay.
-Yes.
-Buko Pandan.
Ok.
Why is it green?
-Because of the jelly.
-Gelatine.
Ok.
-Yeah.
Coconut, jelly and milk.
Does Buko mean coconut?
-Yeah.
Okay.
Is it cold?
-Yeah.
-Where you have come from?
Bangladesh.
-Aah!
Yeah. 
-Are you tourist here?
I'm a tourist. Yes.
Thank you.
How much was it again? Sorry.
-50. 
50.
Five Zero, right? Ok.
Thank you. Salamat Po
-Thank you.
Salamat Po.
Let’s try it.
So, I got some coconut juice.
It’s like coconut gel and milk.
And it's cold and it's green.
It's cold Buko Pandan.
Where do I put the GoPro now?
I'm going to have to get innovative here.
Oh, no!
I dropped it.
Can I have another straw?
I dropped my straw.
-It’s okay. 
Okay. Thank you.
Salamat Po.
-Sir?
-It is a big straw.
Big one? Ok.
Thank you for that.
I can keep it here. 
-Let me help you.
Thank you.
They give me a big straw this time.
Man see how much I am sweating.
-Hello.
-Hi. I am from the Philippines
-What did you say about our country?
It's really nice.
I like the food so far.
I love the food.
-Aah!
Yeah. 
-Oh, really?
So hot today.
Like sweating.
Time to try the actual thing.
Let’s get my face in the sun
so you can actually see my face. Ok..
This is really good.
This is really fruity.
I was expecting like a sugar rush, 
but no, this is like delicious coconut water.
The white stuff from
inside a coconut is also here.
This is amazing.
It's my favorite drink
I've had in the Philippines so far.
Very much worth the .50 pesos.
Oh. Sorry.
Someone just hit me,
Or scratched my head with the umbrella.
Oh, man.
This is so nice. This was so needed.
I didn't realize how much
I needed a cold drink until I had this.
It's really cool. You can see...
You can see the green stuff?
Like that's from the coconuts
Stuck inside the straw.
Are you here every Saturday?
-Yes.
Every Saturday? Okay.
-Come again.
What's your name?
-I'm Corosan.
Come to Salcedo market every Saturday.
Come to this place
and try her coconut drink.
Buko Pandan.
Now trying to find some other stuff.
This is more fried food.
Wontons.
Now, this one looks like more like a
Filipino Chinese food.
Hello.
All kinds of fruits.
Sweet melon is 
120 Pesos per kilo.
Hello.
-Hello.
Oh, look at this.
There’s shawarma.
One of my favorite things in the world.
- (Foreign language)
Hello.
Oh, they are like literally
making it right here.
It looks like Bangladesh.
Not hungry enough for shwarma
quite yet.
But that's good to know
that they're here.
Family recipes.
More cooked food.
Maybe this store is closed
because I don't see a lot of people.
Okay, There's literally plants here.
I don't think you're supposed to eat these
Sunrise Bloom Plants & Flowers
So it's not just...
...stuff to eat.
Okay, Now I'm going to go inside the park
to check out the rest of the stores.
There's so many little shops and vendors.
La Reina Food
Is this meat like sausage?
-Chicken.
Chicken? Okay.
And this is?
-Pork.
And what's this?
-Chicken belly
That one looks like it's really popular.
And we got like
lots of different kinds of pies over here.
Egg pie, buko Pie.
Okay.
This one has different kinds of oils and stuff.
Okay. And this has got Peanut butter
which is the most important thing for me.
Sardines, it’s like fish too.
So are these all like pickles or something?
-It's not really like apickle,
-but it's with vinegar.
Yeah.
-This is soy sauce and calamansi- Philippines lemon.
Do you have this in a small quantity 
that I can eat or do you just sell it in jars?
-No, Sir. It’s just in...
In a jar.
-With me, I finish this
if I don't, I don't watch myself.
-I'll finish this in a one go.
-That’s how good it is.
What’s that?
This looks like protein powder.
I don't know what this is.
Honey.
Oh, these are like big things of honey.
So what's cool about this
little market in Makati...
...is that they accept Paypal and other
sort of digital payments, which is...
not what I found for,
like any other street food place in the Philippines.
So whenever you're in the Philippines, 
make sure you have like lots of cash with you.
Do watch your pockets though.
Because pick pocketing can happen in certain areas.
Speaking of money,
if you're living abroad
and you're trying to send money
back to Bangladesh,
check out this really cool app 
called Taptap Send.
It's a really simple app using
which you can send money to Bangladesh
from the US, UK, Canada and Europe.
Lots of good perks
for using Taptap Send. 
Number one: There's no transaction fees
no matter how big of an amount you send.
Number two: is the transaction times are pretty fast.
The exchange rates are also pretty good.
You can send money directly
to the receiver’s bank account or Bkash account.
And number five: They've given a special promo code
for my viewers, which is OTG.
So if you use that on your first transaction,
you get a 10 credit bonus on your first transaction.
So that's 10 USD
if you're sending money from America
10 Canadian dollars
if you're sending money from Canada,
 £10 if you're sending money from the UK
And €10, you're sending money from Europe.
Make sure you check out that app Taptap Send
if you're sending money to Bangladesh from abroad.
Lumpia.
Hi.
Lumpia
-Yes, Sir.
Do you have one piece 
or like can I get one?
-Yes.
I had Lumpia the other day at...
Globe Lumpia in Quiapo.
There's a place. 
-Yeah. 
Yeah. Yeah.
-Just one?
Yes. Just one. Yeah.
How much is it?
-25
25?
Thank you.
Salamat Po.
-Thank you.
Ok, I got a Lumpia.
Oh, man, it is so hot.
This is cold too which is nice.
This food definitely has some Chinese influence on it..
So sweet.
I'll ask them what it's made from.
A question.
What is Lumpia made from?
-Coconut.
Coconut? Yeah. Okay.
Just the coconut?
-Yes.
Ok.
-And then with shredded chicken breast.
Shredded chicken breasts. Okay.
-With fresh garlic and some sugar.
Okay.
It tastes little sweet.
Is that the sugar or like...
-Yes.
Ok. Ok. Thank you.
I was expecting like a savory thing
and then it’s like sweet.
Okay. Salamat Po.
There you have it. Chicken breast.
Coconut.
-Dark Chocolate, sir.
Hello.
Oh, man.
-Sorry, Sir.
I just ate everything.
If I had seen that earlier...
-This is Dark Chocolate
Okay.
-Specially, it's locally made from cacao beans.
Locally made.
-There is also some sugar.
-So we have free samples. Sir, if you want to taste.
Ok, let me finish the Lumpia
I'll eat the lumpia first and then...
I was just walking past
and the lady mentioned dark chocolate.
I was like, “What?”.
70%. Can I try that? Yeah.
-This one, sir?
Yeah.
-70% cacao mass or the cacao..
-30% has sugar and cacao..
Eating all the lumpia first before
I like it. Yeah.
How much is a small one?
-This one is 75. The big size is 190.
Okay, I'll take the small one.
It will melt if I take a big one.
Okay. 
-It’s sample only, sir.
Okay, you put it in the fridge?
-Cooler, sir.
-Are you a vlogger, sir?
Yes. I am a vlogger.
Here it is.
-This one, sir...
Salamat Po.
-Welcome, sir.
-And you change 25 pesos.
Ok.
Salamat Po.
What's your name?
-Sally, Sir.
-How many days will you stay here, sir?
In the Philippines?
-Yes.
I'll stay two months, but like...
-Two months?
Yeah, yeah.
In Manila, only like 7-10 days.
Then I like go around like everywhere else.
So I'm like leaving soon,
Salamat Pro, for the chocolate.
-Welcome.
I was not expecting to
buy something to take honestly today, but...
I cannot say no to dark chocolate.
This is like Croissant
Pan Au Chocolat
So it's like a French corner.
I think I've run out of shops that are open.
There's a few more that there's like...
What the hell is... ?!
Ok, there's a shop that says...
Free Warts Removal
This is not what I expected 
in a food market.
But maybe it's just a sign 
that's been up there.
Yeah, it's probably a sign
that's been up there.
I don't think they actually do that here.
This is open from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
every Saturday.
But really it's like 1:45pm
and most of the places are closed.
So, it closed a little before 2:00pm, which makes sense
I guess because the market slows down
and it's just so hot right now.
So if you come here, 
come here earlier than I did.
Don't sleep in till noon like I did.
If you want to get the most out of this experience.
It's right here on Toledo Avenue
and Leviste Avenue
in Makati.
Makati is so fancy.
You know, there was also the park there, 
which was this little cute part,
But right in the middle of all the 
tallest buildings of Makati is this area...
...called Ayala Triangle Gardens, 
which is like a pretty big park area.
where you can come and go on a picnic
practice martial arts,
like those gentlemen are doing over there.
And just have some food 
and relax, you know,
Man this wind feels like something
straight out of heaven.
So right on the cross section
of Makati Avenue and Ayala Avenue,
there's that hotel behind me...
...called the Peninsula Manila, which is supposed to be
one of the nicest hotels in Manila.
Well, I don't have the money to stay there,
but you can go stay there if you want.
Now I'm going to take a scooter on this
ridesharing app called Joyride
to go to this other part of town
that's also really fancy.
Also a financial district called BGC
Rider has arrived here.
Our driver has arrived.
Hello, brother.
Can I have this? Ok.
Oh, this is cool.
And I wear like a hairnet 
so it doesn't mess up my hair.
Feel like I'm going to work in a restaurant.
Let’s go, brother.
Kuya.
This is why I like Joyride.
You can just zoom through cars 
that are stuck at a traffic light.
This is funny.
Looked like we left Makati and the really fancy high rise buildings,
and then we're like in a normal part of town for like a minute.
And then we're in BGC 
which is fancier and bigger.
How is it going?
-Hey, what’s up?
And now I am inside BGC.
And we're next to this place
called The Mind Museum,
which I think it’s supposed to be 
some sort of huge science museum.
Yeah, I don't think I'm going inside.
Those tickets are not exactly cheap.
Okay, This is a really fancy part of town.
This is way fancier than Makati so far.
And this reminds me a lot about this place called 
the Promenade in LA,
where I used to go, like, 
more than once a week.
It was my favorite part of town.
And this looks a lot like that.
The only thing that's missing are...
people dancing, because you know, we see people 
performing and dancing in L.A.
kamusta ka kuya
Can I get a strawberry shake?
Over there? Ok.
Are you going to make it?
Yeah, just one.
Making it with fresh strawberries.
Look at that.
Is that just milk or...
-Fresh milk.
What is that?
-Fresh milk.
Fresh milk? Ok
-Yes.
Milk wasn't white.
-Strawberry shake.
Salamat Po
Let's try it out.
But I need a place to sit down.
Oh, my God.
I just saw
they have a Shake Shack.
And I haven't had a Shake Shack since...
I don't know when.
Like,
maybe the last time
I was in New York 2019.
If I knew they had a Shake Shack.
I would have gotten a shake over there
instead of strawberry shake here.
Okay.
Time to try it out
This is good.
This feels like more raw.
I mean, I literally saw them make it.
They put strawberries and milk in there.
Usually when I have
strawberry milkshakes,
I just get like a strawberry
ice cream flavor.
This is more like
you literally
just taste the strawberries.
So we’ve something here called 
The Great British Festival.
I guess they're moving 
Glastonbury To Manila this year.
Okay, so we are on 
Bonifacio High Street.
So this is the street to be, High Street
In the market.
This is definitely fancier than Divisoria.
So looking for my CameraHaus.
It’s spelled Haus, like the German way,
so I'm guessing it's a company or a store
from Germany or Austria.
I hope I said that right.
Well it’s closed.
That's what I get for like
not calling in, but
for some reason
I'm like unable to
call numbers
using even the local Filipino SIM card that I got.
Hopefully I'll find some other place
for batteries at some point.
I don't know who that is,
but that lady's putting on
quite the performance.
OK so we've walked away from that festival
and the really loud and busy part of...
High Street,
but I think I'm still on High Street.
Still it's pretty nice.
Still lots of benches
So there's a nice little area in the middle
if you smell too bad and
want a free shower.
After walking for ages,
I think I'm finished with High Street.
There's a shopping mall here.
I'm going to go inside.
And see if I can find my batteries here.
Trying to find the same store,
but in a different market.
Also, I'm feeling
like I want some coffee to re-energize
because I'm way over
like 10,000 steps already for the day.
So need something
to like boost me up for a second.
Man, this place is really pretty too.
If you go to Manila and Malate...
...and then come here in Makati...
you definitely feel like 
you're in a different city.
It's a lot like L.A., where you have...
Santa monica and Skid Row
in the same city.
Hello.
I’ll get a double chocolate iced blended coffee.
Is that okay?
-Do you need the large size?
No, the regular one. Yeah.
-Regular one?
-Alright, Sir. Would you like to add something else?
No, I’ll just get a coffee for now. Thank you though..
-Is it for dine in, Sir?
Dine in.
Salamat Po
-Welcome.
Okay,
This is beeping.
Coffee ready.
-Salamat Po.
Salamat Po.
I got the double chocolate coffee which is
not just coffee, more chocolate at this point I guess.
But I'm proud of myself
for not getting like cookies on the side
or whipped cream. So this is kind of healthy..?
I walked liked 13,000 steps today,
so I get to eat some chocolate.
Let's try this out.
I barely taste the coffee.
Just taste the chocolate.
Met this girl here in the mall
who was my fan.
Okay, this is the second time
it's happened in Manila in the last week.
Thank you Rica for making my day.
I think that was her name. Rica.
I don't know how I always end up
entering the bookstore
every time I see one.
but I'm in another very, very fancy mall,
and I'm going to try to find
these camera batteries finally.
Do you have batteries for GoPro?
-Which GoPro? 
GoPro 9
-Oh, we don't.
You don't? 
-Yes, Sir.
Which one do you have batteries for?
-Out of stock. Sorry
Look at this.
This is the Mini 3
I have the Mini 2.
This is the FPV one, right?
Okay.
So FPV drone from DJI is 72,000 pesos
I think that's like $1400.
So just looking at drone prices
and apparently they're coming up with the Air 3,
which I can't imagine
how good that would be,
because the Air 2 I've been using
for two and a half years.
and I can't complain at all.
Ok. So we're in our third shopping mall...
...of this evening.
And hopefully I can find some GoPro camera batteries here.
And this mall is called Market Market.
Hi. Do you have a battery for...
-GoPro?
GoPro 9?
-Yup.
You do?
-This is the new type.
How much longer does it last?
-Almost one hour at one take.
Okay. Okay.
I finally found it.
Do separately sell something 
that charges three batteries?
Thank you
Found a charger, finally.
-5800, Sir.
5800. Okay.
And those are the original GoPro batteries, right? Okay.
-Yes.
Thank you. Salamat Po.
Man, that took...
...way too long,
but I finally got my batteries.
Somehow this became a vlog about me 
finding new GoPro batteries than exploring BGC.
But I didn't get to see a lot of BGC in the process, I guess.
And I got my batteries,
so I'm going to call it a happy ending
to my BGC Makati vlog.
I'm so ready to go home.
I've done like 16,000 steps today.
So thank you for watching.
