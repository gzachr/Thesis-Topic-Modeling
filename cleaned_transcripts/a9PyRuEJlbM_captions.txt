hi everyone so another topic for today is 
what are the caliber skills or profession
that gives you a high pinging rate 
okay these skills are more leashed
because basically in reality the morning 
you are the high rate you have and the
top profession that gives a high paying 
rate is a engineer so whether you are a
friend an engineer a Mac and engineer or 
a full-stack then that will range from
$15 per are to $100 per are and it really 
depends on the stocks that you are good at
okay when I see engineers they are good in doing 
website they are good in doing softwares so that
kind of profession is really have a good you 
know something like that and then the other
profession with the graphic designer okay the 
kind of graphic designer I'm like either either
whether you are a UI or UX or a web designer then 
that will be a good rate and the more specialized
you are the high rate you can have again so that 
will range from $10 to $30 per hour but the if
you are really good in UX and doing wireframes 
wireframes or something like that then you can
even go higher than $30 and then third one would 
be the project manager so if you're really good
with talking with the clients I mean if you are 
you can portray to represent it be half of the
CEO over in behalf of the company and that will 
prove that will give you a really good speed rate
okay there are still profession as well that it 
doesn't require you to be creative you don't need
to be a graphic designer or it doesn't require you 
to be technically good work you don't need to be
a programmer but it still give you a good rate 
these are the vs okay but I'm not referring to
the general v8 but these are the V ace that has a 
niche so they are MVA that specialize on let's say
on e-commerce or they are a VA that specialize 
on podcast or they are a VA the specialized on
on insurances so that can range event - let's say 
$15 to $50 per arm so I really have recommend if
to niched your your expertise you can start from 
general you can I mean you can what would say you
can accept jobs that involves general tasks 
like you are in general VA but that can also
can can only take like I think $5 to $8 per hour 
that's the max for that general VA and you will
be yeah yeah but all the stuff you will do a lot 
of things from email marketing website development
graphic designing social media marketing that is a 
general VA even though you do a lot of things you
are a jack-of-all-trades but the rate would be not 
really quite good especially for data encoder or
researcher then that might range from $2 to $3 per 
hour customer service representative it depends if
you are bilingual like if you are you can speak 
Japanese at the same time English then that
could be a high rate but if you are purely like a 
customer service then some even pay you only three
dollars we're unfortunately others only gave you 
like five hundred dollars per month so yeah yeah I
hopefully you can find it's okay to to be general 
first but hopefully you can find a niche so you
can have a better rate in the future because I 
started for to be general it's totally fine to
be general but make sure that you slowly find 
your niche to to be selective is you won't be a
employee anymore but if you have an expertise you 
can you will be considered as a consultant so they
will ask you something because they don't know 
how to do it so you will act as a brain on that
certain film that's why it is a high paying job so 
hopefully this has been helpful and please don't
