leica which really stole my heart on which
bus her performance was just incredibly dreamy
and you literally felt like you are in a fairy
tale and i looked a little bit about her and
her journey is really really incredible and
i found one a live performance uh of her singing
when i look at you which is one of the songs
that i truly truly love so i got super excited

a lot of fun and now without any further ado
like her and when i look at you all right
let's get into
[Music] it um
[Music]
[Music] so i am super excited and a little
surprised because here like it is not going
for that very shiny apatown here we are getting
a little bit of the deeper goodness as well
so we can hear how her tone quality is also
incredibly gorgeous at the little lower places
where she can really get all that color just
really shine through now there is something
incredibly special about street performances
and i don't know what was the occasion of
this one but street performances have another
level of soul another level of atmosphere
and i'm loving this so so much but definitely
the lower places of her voice are so gorgeous
she did a bunch of have very very typical
and very signature i would say even cries
and also the tiny run that she incorporated
wonderful also she's clean beautiful and still
soulful in the industry performance amazing
job leica let's continue
the little crime [Music]
i
[Music] [Applause] [Music]
[Music]
when she's making the little vibrato uh in
the lower spaces of her voice oh it's definitely
giving me a little bit of a jazzy vibe and
it's adding so much to the song because the
song is typical poppy but leica is really
adding that extra extra flavor to that song
and i
[Music]
know is [Music] um [Music]
you can tell that she has someone close to
her in the audience because she's making so
much eye contact with them and those really
soulful phrases when she's thinking about
home and coming back to the loved ones that's
so so freaking adorable i think this song
fits her so so nicely because she has a space
to show off her gorgeous color and the lower
spaces but she also has tons and tons and
tons of opportunities to really open the tones
make them shine and also and also a lot of
places where she can incorporate her signature
stuff so the cries and the little runs so
very fitting for her style very fitting for
her for the way she structures her singing
within the song
[Music]
this was very tasty
[Music]
let's go
[Music]
is [Music] notice how lightly she approached
the upper toes it was beautifully open so
it was beautiful open shiny tone but she was
not pressuring it she was not over doing it
it was very lightly approached and i actually
like it because the atmosphere of the song
was really asking for a light approach nothing
too aggressive
[Music] and a little bit of extra
[Music] okay i'm so proud of her she did a
lot of stuff that i also used because within
my sinking i do incorporate a lot of jazzy
bluesy kinda little details that kind of spice
up the singing a little bit and i love them
because they fit my voice and they fit her
voice as well as a singer choosing a little
ornament and a little elements from different
genres from different singing styles can really
enrich your singing enrich your performances
and just elevate them to a completely different
level and she definitely did that now on wishbone's
performance that was a song that really really
was asking for some very light very princessy
approach but here she really reminded me of
sarah geronimo sergi when she was singing
where are you there which i made a reaction
on definitely so go and check that one out
because that was one of my favorite performances
of sarah and that was very similar no hesitation
from the lower spaces beautiful rich color
but light and soulful approach to higher tones
no overdoing no pressure no too much of an
aggressive approach to higher tones like too
aggressive builds or anything like that very
good very very gorgeous very gorgeous now
when i say that sanger needs to be smart about
singing it needs to be smart about song dynamics
and choose the right approach not to completely
kill the song with over doing it over the
top but doing exactly as much as is needed
this is what i have on mind she's very young
but she's very very smart with her singing
and she understands the importance of dosing
what you're doing great job and double amazing
preference for me because it was a street
performance which for me just have another
level of amazing vibe because you have these
surroundings incorporated into the performance
you can feel the atmosphere from the people
i really enjoyed this one so i hope you enjoyed
it as well don't forget to go and subscribe
