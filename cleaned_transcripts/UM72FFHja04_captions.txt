The Filipino Comfort Room - The great oxymoron
The Filipino Comfort Room (CR)
Australian slang has so many words for that
room with a toilet in it.
The dunny.
The loo.
The bog.
The
thunder box.
Most of us Aussies could prattle off about
another 10 - 15 without even straining the
brain.
In the Philippines they call it the "Comfort
Room" (or CR).
Maybe it's just me, but I can think of
many places more comfortable!
Read and learn if you are in an Australian
Filipina relationship, as you
will need to face this several times a day
when you visit anywhere other than a flash
hotel in the
Philippines.
Some Comfort Room peculiarities
Goodness me!
Where does one start?
I wasn't too shocked when I first came across
one of these little
rooms.
I had traveled in Asia in my youth before
I came here, and after a public dunny under
the streets
in what was then Bombay that contained beggars,
it takes a bit to shock me.
I think one in an Auntie's
house in Pasig where there was no light and
where everything was as wet as a limestone
cave was
probably one of the worst.
It's the lack of dryness which probably bothers
me the most, so I can start
there.
Yes, Philippines CR's are a damp affair.
Water everywhere!
And trying to emerge without looking like
you still 2 years old with a lack of bladder
control, this can be difficult.
I detest it when my shorts
become a blotter for toilet floor water.
I don't know why it is that a trip to the
bog for a Filipino
necessitates getting water a metre-and-a-half
up four walls as well as creating a swimming
pool on the
floor.
They usually have small bottoms.
How much water is actually needed?
Bum-washing rather than dunny paper
I've long thought this was a more hygienic
practice than the western practice of using
a roll of semi-
absorbent paper to clean such a grubby area.
I won't go into graphic detail, but obviously
a good
dousing with water will be cleaner and more
effective.
The inventor of the dunny roll makes me think
of
the inventor of the chopstick.
Who ever agreed with them that these were
fantastic ideas??
Water was
already invented, for goodness sakes!
In the Philippines, they have a bucket and
a tabo.
This is a little plastic dipper with a handle,
which
normally sits in a bucket of water under the
single solitary tap.
The idea is to tip or toss water onto the
icky regions and to give a good wash with
the hand.
Pretty straight forward.
The Filipino Toilet Bowl
An Aussie will notice a lack of what we consider
essentials, namely a cistern and a seat!
There's also a
complete lack of design flair.
We purchased one for a local school once.
Cost P500.00, so I suppose you
get what you pay for.
This is part of why I say that the word "comfort"
in "Philippines Comfort Room"
makes it a serious oxymoron.
So you can either sit on this charming little
bowl, or you can do what most of the locals
do and squat on
it.
Ever used one and wondered why it looked like
there were dirty footprints on the two side
edges?
Probably because that WAS dirty footprints
on the two side edges!
So you do what you need to do....give a good
wash of your nether-regions with the tabo.....and
you hoick
the rest of the bucket contents down the bowl
with sufficient enthusiasm to send your contribution
down the pipes and out of site!
This may take a few goes, and don't be surprised
when it never looks
Harpic-fresh!
Comfort issues in the Philippines CR
Can you use toilet paper?
I told my two sons on their first visit to
the Philippines that the plumbing here only
used 50mm piping,
so that use of dunny paper would block up
the toilet.
Should have seen the look of horror on their
faces!
Fortunately I was only making it up so as
to make them panic!
Sewer piping here is 100mm just as it is in
Australia.
It can normally cope with paper, just as it
can back home.
I suppose you just need to be aware
that flinging a bucket of water down there
doesn't create the same force as a damned
good flush of an
Aussie cistern.
So copious amounts of paper coupled with minimal
water pressure may cause some
issues.
There is a strange custom particularly in
public CR's of asking CR-patrons to toss their
used paper into a
waste bin there.
Why?
I have NO idea!
YUCK!!
I repeat, YUCK!!!!!
There is no practical reason for this,
though.
How do you keep your clothes dry?
Not always easy!
I have a mop permanently in our downstairs
bathroom at home here.
Some dunnies,
especially service station dunnies when traveling,
I walk in......and walk straight out of.
Some literally
have an inch of water on the floor.
As a general rule, the art seems to be to
lower the pants with one
hand, and hold them up with the other.
And to use, say, left hand to hold up the
clothing away from the
soggy floor and to never let it go.
Or if you DO happen to find a dry patch, you
can always remove them
and leave them there until you're ready to
put them back on again.
But dry patches are rare in the
ocean that is the Philippines comfort room!
The bum sprayer, bum washer, or "hand bidet"
If you are in a more luxurious Philippines
bathroom, you may well find one of these handy
little items.
Consider buying some at the hardware and taking
them back to Australia, as they are brilliant!
Don't buy
extra-cheap flimsy ones, or you will regret
it.
I think you can figure it out!
Showering, or "taking a bath"
The Filipino CR is also a place of bathing.....showering......"taking
a bath", as Filipinos call washing
yourself.
No bathtubs.
Rarely a shower.
Even more rare to have hot water.
See that single tap, the
bucket and the tabo?
THAT is generally the shower.
The instruments of comfort!
This is what is
sometimes known in other parts of the world
as a "bucket bath".
How?
You squat down on the floor.
You tabo the water from the bucket over yourself.
You soap yourself up.
You use the tabo to rinse the soap off.
You're done!
And yes, the water is nice and cold!
Some may add some boiling water to it to take
the freezing edge off
it, but most simply tough it out.
And before you scream like a schoolgirl, remember
that your delicate
little Filipina lady did the same thing today
probably just before you did without making
a sound.
Don't
embarrass yourself, man!
By the way.
A little funny story.
Here you will often see a roll of toilet paper
in someones house.
They
will refer to it as "tissue", because a tissue,
a dunny roll and a serviette here are all
called "tissue".
This is
therefore "tissue".
But here the bog roll is used for nose-wiping,
hand-wiping, polishing things and
general cleaning.
One of my daughters was shocked to see it
hanging up on a holder in our CR when she
first arrived from the province.
Silliest thing she'd seen in a long time,
she thought.
Why would you put it
in the CR?
Had no concept of it being used to wipe the
bum with.
So as usual in the Philippines, keep your
sense of humour.
You're going to need it!
