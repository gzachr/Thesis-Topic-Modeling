foreigners fall in love with the
philippines now when you talk
about philippians you understand this is
a country that many many people come
from all over the world and they come
for many different reasons but one of
the reasons my guys is that they come
for a love
l to the ultimate
he love baby yeah love makes the world
go around what the world needs now you
love sweet love no not everyone but just
someone know that's all hey but yeah man
hey one of the main solid reasons that
people come philippines is for love baby
they found that lady over the internet
they found that lady and when they came
to visit before and she and they want to
be with them okay so it what's wrong
with that is anything wrong with that
when you find the love when you find the
one you love when you find nothing you
want to be with them you want to be
close to them you want to touch them
hold them squeeze them you don't slide
you want to feel really warm and fuzzy
you want to feel good man so ah
you know those are the reasons why i
want to read why you know the people you
know and we're going to find out today
people come here because they need
people and people here are what friendly
yeah you know they like they like
friendly people and they're very
friendly themselves so it's a really a
variety of reasons why people fall in
love with the flippies i fell in love my
why did why did you fall in love with
the philippines why why bother the
encouraging minds to know hey
i fell in love with the philippines
because i found a lovely filipina here
man because i didn't really my first
time coming here guys i did not like
this country i'm like you know because i
met some you know i was just dating
online testing the waters out i said man
i've been talking everyone at least i
said i'm talking to you for six months
now i need to see if she really you know
i saved up my mind i have money right
there i didn't have the money so i
started working all the time man
just over time i got to see about you
late you know so i guess the philippines
man and it was hot last night
i don't like me man i do not like him
okay
i'm straight up with you i don't like a
lot of heat that's why i go to the beach
but i be trying to find me an umbrella
you know her name at the time was susan
blue day
and i liked her i thought actually i'll
be honest man i really thought i love
susan
but if you know susan like i know susan
oh
oh
oh she's not the one she wasn't the one
man and uh but she was she was
oh man she was someone else i loved the
lady
i loved it really hard i felt a really
hard love for her but i found out she
wasn't right time long and i had to let
her go hurt me hard man i love the girl
i wanted to marry her man i'm straight
up i thought i had found one but when i
found out she wasn't right
it took me i took my little knife out
and said hey baby
talk to you later
cut the cord between our relationship i
didn't cut her y'all know get it don't
get a twist i didn't cut her but i cut
the cord
and you think you think i just you think
i didn't uh continue to think about her
you think i didn't say
i had to fight every everything in my
body man
had to fight the urge i want to get back
in touch with that lady every time
you know
but it was hard man you know
i did it though
cause i ain't crazy
i still loved him you know you just
don't you might cut the relationship off
right but you don't cut the love off
like that it ain't easy you know it love
didn't start like that right so it can't
get out like that it takes time
look you'll build up like over
time so it has to go down over time what
it just don't fall flat okay so it took
me a while man but
i went on and i found this so listen to
me guys don't give up don't lose your
hope baby cause your hope is who you
found you found somebody to make you
feel like a man make you uh talk like a
man walk like a man wanna be with her
every time you turn around
you better hold on to her for dear life
cause if you lose her you may not find
nobody like you might find somebody
better than them you never know but you
ain't gonna find anybody like her
because they ain't gonna want her and
one of you okay and if you're meant to
be together
you're destroying your future
if it listens to me good
you have to see this to you because a
lot of you guys out there you know i'm
tired where you know
look here man
you selected her for a reason
huh
didn't you
did you select her because you love her
right you say you love her
or did you or just want to sex up with
her
huh you want a bang huh slam bam thank
you man but which one you want you want
something permanent or you want a
temporary if you want if you want a
temporary lover get rid of her huh
yeah get rid of her
toss her
that's all you want right that's a good
piece that's all you want get rid of it
what's the use of it you don't want that
long time so get rid of it don't string
her out like you want her to be your
wife don't string around like you want
to live don't do that
get rid of her
and get rid of her going to your next
victim that's all you are
play a player
huh
said that's all you are man but for
those of you that looking for somebody
permanent
huh lifetime relationship whether you
marry her or whether you leave it you
live for somebody like that
hang on you got her you are the founder
and you waiting
hang on to your hope
okay
because when you you already made the
work you already put the work and you
want to put the time in with that lady
and he was like
it takes too long then you didn't really
have a strong love did you
i questioned it and i couldn't wait i
got i'm qualified to question you you
really wanna qualify to question you
about your love steadiness
because i took me five years baby
five years i waited on lisa d i dated it
for five
you know and that's real look five years
you can tell me you can't tell me you
can't wait a year you can't wait two
years huh
so so so you when you can't wait man you
become so impatient question your uh
reason why why you getting rid of it it
must not be real
i told you
uh women
are always
strategized
and the men like me and you
we always fantasize
i would be me and her and be the big man
man i can't wait but they know i can't
hit that can't wait till they hit that
man yeah
fantasize but women strategize okay this
guy like me
i'm gonna get some money out of here
i'm gonna show him a little bit of my
coconuts just a little bit of cleavage
you know and i'm gonna make myself a
real sexy and hot you know and he gonna
want me strategize and we
fantasize
look at him man
learn to strategize just like they do
plan it out
don't fake it out in your mind don't
fantasize make sure that what you want
is what you want and then when you know
what you want is real and you ain't go
and nothing's going to change your mind
whether it's the pandemic 10 years
you're still hanging in the waiting line
it'd be to 15 years you're still hanging
out with uh that's real love
i don't care if i had to wait
another five years for lisa d i would
have did it you know why because i knew
she was for me
and she knew she
i was for her we knew that it wasn't
beyond the shadow but that some of you
still testing the waters well you know
i'm see how she left me but i'm i'm
gonna deal with her but nobody i gotta i
gotta get my knees man why i'm waiting
on her i got these little flutes outside
i'm gonna do my thing you know it's like
okay nah it's not okay
you know how with your woman that you
she's waiting faithfully on you how
would she feel if she know you flipping
around on her come on man
find somebody's right ty long strong and
stick with them
to the end
um
i'm gonna stick with lisa d she might
kick me out you know but i'm not i'll
never kick her out she might she might
whatever but i'll never because i made
up my mind
that's that's the one
and the only one for me
and i'm not going to quit on her i'm not
getting angry with her she might get in
but i'm not going to quit on her but
when i quit on her i'm quitting on
myself
okay
i know she's the one for me
i prayed for lisa d
some of y'all
bobby i believe in prayer you know okay
you just leaving rolling the dice down
shooting down you you like to you like
your crap like you shoot that crabs
and you take yourself everything you get
now i want some surety in my life
and so when you want some surety from
the man up above you pray and he
provides you okay let me get out let's
go all right so we talked to you on the
private on the prior and somebody needed
to hear that when you see me go off on a
tangent like that
if somebody has a pressing urge or
pressing need or pressure in question
desire a situation
and and that's putting me to say to that
individual or individuals okay
so whoever that was meant for take that
and run with it
okay if you know what's meant for you
say oh man i needed that head i need to
hear that because i know you did that's
why i said it okay
the basis makes sense i know it does all
right so yesterday on the last pro last
uh live stream markel was here and we
did an awesome job he did an awesome job
for us we talked about uh
veterans information and he made a very
significant point uh
it's about the veterans that are
necessarily better but anyone that's on
ssi
uh be careful if you move out of the
country over 30 days you could be cut
off that's all one of that and that's
all i'm going to say that you want to
check out the video uh check it out this
was the thumbnail free or last live
stream check it out okay
and uh today we're going to talk about
five baby
five five things
five reasons
four men like you and me falling over
the philippines and the reason i'm
bringing this topic up is because i'm
coming up with a lot of people that's
getting tired
i'm tired man i can't wait no longer
come on man
are you forgetting the reason why you
started the journey
huh whenever you get tired about
something whatever you want to quit
remember why you started okay that's
what i did you think i didn't get tired
waiting on today you think i didn't get
time working eight twelve hours a day
six seven days a week you think i got
him to get tired of that
sure i got tired
but i began to remember why i started i
had a picture lisa d on my refrigerator
and i looked at it every day every
morning every time i got went to the
fridge like her personal friend the
bible failed
again getting my second win again let's
get up look
i said let's stop
i motivated myself and her picture
motivated me you got to have something
to motivate you man
you know a lot of you guys have found
that woman out there and you get a
little tired and when did you know to
out of waiting but so what
you think you're the only one tired of
waiting on your lady
you think she ain't tired of waiting on
you
huh
come on man you used to use that grey
man up there
show [ __ ] you get tired everybody oh
you're human
we all get tired man
this because you're tired don't quit
you keep going the only time you stop is
when you drop you can't go no
your life is gone that's when you stop
don't stop
you want some happiness in your life you
want some success in your life you want
another woman you want a woman that can
help you mold you help you shape your
mind your body and move you up in this
world stay steady
steady is the man steady is the hand
steady yourself and ready yourself
i hate to see you lose it
huh you put time in with that woman
three months six month dime i give
twelve you put time in with that lady
and you're gonna give it up cause you
getting a little tired wait a minute i
can't wait
man
man up
grow some balls again gotta gross on
this is the time you should expand your
desires this is the time you should get
more energy this is the time you should
get more enthusiasm so the longer you
weigh the more joy you got coming on the
other side somebody told me george
coming in the morning
weeping me and do it for a night but the
joy comes in the morning you want some
joy in your life man
hey keep on waiting huh and why are you
waiting just don't sit there i'm waiting
and waiting and waiting now just don't
sit there like a dummy get up and do
something about yourself get up and get
some money get up and get a better job
get up and get a business get up do
something right that long waiting is not
only the thing you need to do while
you're waiting you need to work on you
up and move on up just like george and
we ain't nobody told you we're gonna be
easy
you got to have some strength you got to
have some courage continue the journey
and if you don't if you quit
then that wasn't meant for you you were
just playing yourself and playing her
too
and you needed to quit if you just
playing around are you just playing
around you know you just want you don't
want to taste that damn
it's quick but if this one you want for
real don't quit man
that's my advice let's go man let's go
i hate to see people lose their dreams i
hate to see people uh uh
turn in and quit and when they got the
capacity and the ability to move on and
continue sometimes you have to go
through stuff in life
i mean to see the to get to the rainbow
you'll never see the rainbow if you
don't have no rain in it right
wait a minute i'll say that again
because i don't think y'all got that one
you will never see the rain if you don't
have no
you'll never see the rainbow if you
don't have no rain okay are you with me
yeah
it's like joy
comes after the weeping
the rainbow comes after the rain
after the rain after the pain
then you get the game
some of you so impatient you can't wait
you can't you don't get no gain you go
just hit this hit that
come on man slow your road
be steadier steady your hand steady your
mind steadier spirit steady your heart
be true to the one you chose be true to
one if you pray for her god gave it to
you and you're gonna turn you're gonna
turn your back on what god gave you you
think you're gonna get blessed like that
now you're gonna get stressed like that
and you're gonna get messed like that if
that's the one for you and you know it
and you know god bless you with her
never never turn your back on something
god gave you
just a friendly word of advice all right
let's go ah so we talked about uh mark
we talked next about uh
veterans information this thumbnail
yesterday uh last broadcast and it was
awesome man check out markell's channel
marquels tv the podcast m-a-r-k-e-l-l
space s space tv the podcast you will
not be disappointed all right all right
let's go ahead thumbnail for the day
here we go
i got two thumbnails really uh this one
right here
it says like us you like us y'all find
filipinos up in here every last one of
them got some flavor
they got a little spice in them
sugar and spice
everything right they got them they got
that's why people come here cause they
say you like me sir
yeah we like
you that's why they come and then i got
this one right here she said
you like
you see what you like yeah i see what i
like and i like what i see
i like it hey that's why i'm here man i
found the filipina i saw what i liked in
her and i liked what i saw her and
that's why i'm here i didn't come here
to escape the united states of a dog on
america i know there's a lot of racism
all of a sudden yeah yeah
yeah but yeah i didn't confidence many
people come for that reason
but i didn't come for that my primary
purpose was to marry lisa d and live
here and dwell in peace uh her here with
her until we decided to move elsewhere
we have not decided to move elsewhere
yet we may with the next few years we
don't know but right now we've got the
way this pet we've got to wait this
pandemic out okay and then we'll make
our moves okay but yeah that's my reason
so a lot of you have that same reason
but that you're getting tired
so i'm here to motivate you to to see
that there is a light at the end of the
top but if you don't ever get to the end
of the tunnel you'll never see the light
huh
did you give if you
can never get to the end of the tunnel
you'll never see the light and when you
never see the light you're still left in
what darkness
you'll be blind as a bat you can't see
nothing but what you have
to say
because you ain't never been patient
enough to get to the top get through the
dark pains look at the dark times get to
the waiting period you have to go
through that man
see only the strong survive you know
strong mind strong spirit strong uh hell
those are people that make records those
are the winners in life okay
you don't have to have the most muscular
body into being athletics if your mind
is right and you got the perfect
technique you can take it you can play
uh 80. you go 100 you can take a 200
pound man down to the ground if you use
the proper mental uh ability and and and
the techniques it's leverage okay and if
you know the way to leverage somebody
down you can beat them up okay so it's
how you use what you've got to get what
you want
you got to use your mind right tight
longer
spend the time take time make the time
shake the time to wait it out
to see your lady
the main thing you got to make sure is
she not shaving okay and if you chose
the right one buddy she ain't gonna be
shaving okay let's go
i'm telling y'all some good stuff all
right um
focus for the day now hocus pocus just
about kissed about guests that's focus
now come on man everything in life is
about your ability to do what focus
that's why i try to give you a focus a
lot all the time but most of the time
i'm gonna have a focus up in here to let
you know where we're going number one
we're gonna talk about the prices
philippe number two we're gonna talk
about the places in the philippines
number three we're gonna talk about the
people yeah baby people lovely people
people who need people
are the luckiest people in the world
pace man we're gonna talk about the pace
man are there slow pace fast-paced
medium pace man and then we're going to
talk about peaceful
oh yeah yeah yeah peaceful man got some
peaceful people up in here and if you
don't know it by now you don't know
nothing okay peace man you know i always
say right peace is the answer and love
is the way that is my motto in life
that's caught got me through a whole lot
of trouble all right and now listen let
me tell you this
with remarkable beauty and undeniable
friendly locals the philippines isn't
difficult to love they're not they're
not difficult to love it's not difficult
to love the philippines
really it's not
it's so easy to fall in love with the
philippines because
number one
i got five reasons to show you why okay
all right so so it's not difficult to
love them at all and then when you love
a filipino or filipino they love you
back that's the kind of people they are
some people you love them they care less
you know they don't care nothing about
you but when you love a filipina and you
show them and you wrote them and you
tell them hey i love you they will love
you back and then with the love you give
they give you back unity is more than
what you give them because they don't
take much to get a filipina to love you
all you gotta say is i'm gonna take care
of you all you gotta say i love you you
mind and you take care of them that's
all you need to do and they will love
you to the rest of your life
most tourists think that the philippines
is just about beaches
i didn't say bi i said be y'all get that
out your mind okay
most filipinos most tourists think that
the philippines is just about beaches
but actually it's much more much much
more we're going to show you today okay
much more than that man and if you for
those of you that have never been to the
philippines you probably don't
understand
uh
the full grasp of what it means to be in
this culture and suspend this around
these beautiful people
and uh living here but i do and i try to
convey that to you on a day in day out
basis but at the same time i try to
compute a a a holistic picture rather
than just some minuscule my tiny picture
i want you to see the entire picture so
i show you the what the good
the bad
and ugly okay i'll show you all
some guys just show you good man we have
a good idea and so you know yeah
sometimes it's like that but sometimes
it's beautiful
i'm glad y'all it's a tiger bh you know
what i'm saying full age yeah but but
all in all it works out it balances okay
and that's what i'm saying it was all
age i would not be here but it's a
little bit of that but it's more more
love than anything else okay all right
so number one and what what's number who
remember number one tell you don't man
you don't pay attention to nothing man
you don't pay what's number one i'm
asking what's number one
what
okay you didn't get it right i'm gonna
show you what it number one is this
right here come on man let's pay
attention man i told you that prices
okay are you with me jp now go get you
something to drink man please i gotta i
want to be trying to wake you up gonna
get you something to drink get your
cocoa get you get you a shot of vodka
whatever you need man get you something
i want you to pay attention because you
need i want to remind you
why you chose the philippines i want to
remind you why you chose your leg i want
to remind you why you are waiting what
you're waiting on baby
come on now that's why i did this video
that is the purpose of this video to
remind you gentlemen that you are
getting tired that are getting tired of
that why you started this journey and
everything you do in your life ain't
nothing but a journey buddy you better
get there everything you do in your life
is nothing but a journey
and sometimes your journey has been
ordained by god
yeah your journey may be ordained by
your job
your journey may oh baby ordained
ordained by you but everything in life
is an ordained journey so you got to ask
yourself did god ordain this journey or
did i do it or or somebody other why am
i on this road why am i trying to reach
this woman why why that's the question
you need to ask yourself why did you
start this journey and who authorized
you to get this journey if you started
it on your own and god ain't in it you
might be on the wrong journey buddy
because if it got in it it's not
ordained okay let's go
i'm telling you something good oh my god
thank you lord all right here we go uh
number one hit the wrong button sorry
all right my screen isn't oh come on man
see every time you try to do something
decent and right for the lord
okay something always got something
messed you up come on hold on y'all i
messed up man okay here we go
okay here we go all right so number one
is what prices so i'm i'mma speed this
up i'm taking too long gotta speed it up
let's go about it all right prices in
the united states you wanna talk about
prices man in united states
price and cost of stuff in the united
states 2.5 times more expenses okay
uh paid
it's about three
in other words you pay 3.5 times more
for a restaurant you pay 59.8 percent
more for groceries you pay 2.9 times
more for transportation you pay 3.1
times more for housing you pay 2.8 times
more for child care you pay 2.5 times
more for entertainment you pay 26.2
more for clothing and the source of this
is
on the website my life elsewhere okay
uh it's the data's there it's clear
anything you buy in the united states
gonna cost you more than it costs you to
feel it and that's one reason why many
people come to the philippine prices man
cheaper you know
you know you get more for your bucks
your money can go longer and stronger
here in the philippines versus yourself
and a lot of retired people come here
you might have got in your mind i'm a
recruiter i'm retired here with my lady
and we're going to live in peace but
don't come out here thinking you're
going to live on 500
or 5 we talking about the other day
don't come right here be going over 500
you're going to need more than that okay
unless you live in the province you
might you might barely i don't know
you're going to need more [ __ ] you got
to pay rent you got to do this they'll
come out here like that have you some
money okay when you come out here
warren buffett said price is what you
pay for
value is what you get okay
price is what you pay for
value in that price is what you get so
really price is not really the object
but it's the value that you're looking
for you said bobby i'm gonna spend two
thousand on the letter trying to get it
here and
we can't get through our k1 visa man i
don't know what to do man my money gone
nobody ain't gonna do it you know you're
buying a woman
are you buying a woman that's my
question to you are you if you're trying
to get a mail order brad you're buying a
woman huh
what are you trying to do
ain't about the money buddy it's about
the value that you're investing in that
young lady
value
when you when you get when you actually
get hooked up with her whether you're
living with her whether you uh marry
it's going the value that she provides
you is going to be way more than the
money you spend okay
it's about the value of that individual
entering your life okay so understand me
i know you guys i got these accountants
out there and these guys the penny
pinches every pay seller every penny
every dime they got to be accounted for
and they don't want to spend no more why
am i spending this no i'm not spending
the cheapos if you cheat man don't come
out here
because this you're gonna have to spend
money okay to live out here and if you
ain't got enough money do not come out
here that's just plain and simple okay
so while you're waiting for your woman
if you don't have enough money go on and
get the money get you another job
part-time job get your
promotion raised get your business but
don't come out here with another you got
plenty of time no excuses now but you
know but you know i need this now you
know you need money to live out here
all right so prices man everything's
gonna be hot and that's one of the
things i enjoy about living in the
philippines uh everything is way way
cheaper than it would be less expensive
than it would be if i were in the united
states of a dog on america that's one of
the best features of living out here in
the philippines the prices are way lower
now i got to tell you this on the other
side of that whatever you buy out here
they're they're like you buy a growth uh
not groceries but if you buy like cheer
furniture and stuff like that
the quality is not as good as the usa i
just have to tell you that because every
time we buy something we bought a nice a
nice sofa
uh about
about year two years ago so far tour
and it's just two of us we don't have a
bunch of kids tearing up stuff it's just
too we just know where
whoever here so we buy tonight we pay
good money for this overdue and it all
took and i we had it fixed i had a real
good poster man come here and repost it
and it went bad bad i guess now when we
we gotta get now we look for another
soap yeah but uh quality is not there
but still the prices are way less uh
than you would find in the united states
of a dog or america number two here we
go don't know what to do wrong what to
do what they do places man
yeah the philippines has some of the
most beautiful places in the world and a
lot of people kind of different places
you know they want to see they want the
scenery they want to scoop with that
they want to do this they want to
snorkel yeah it's okay man that's what
that's why it's here this is a tropical
country and people like tropical places
to come especially when you had a hard
winter in the united states and you
freeze your butt off you want to come
and enjoy your life wow then beautiful
summer in a beautiful woman and a
beautiful place to go boracay you know
look at the beach out there man behold
retards you see that big animal right

of a dog on america buddy very seldom
when you find it philippines have hearts

strong they'll make you feel that you're
the only man on the planet that's such
respect they give you okay they're
friendly
they're compassionate they're helpful
they're loving they're sharing they're
giving and forgiving come on man what
more can you ask for in a lady and more
more can you ask for a nation of people
as the philippines i love the
philippines man and i love the
philippines people
you know and i'm not i'm not putting my
own people down now
i got people we got people in the usa
just like them but they're hard to find
because the attitude of the western
society the filipinos the philippines
are in asia they have a very very
different and conservative nature about
them but it's also compassionate it's
also helpful it's also loving it's also
friendly and it's also giving
philippines where asia wears a smile see
a lady smiling right there
every last one of them got a big
beautiful smile on their face and
whenever you meet a filipina and they
don't know you first thing you don't do
is smile like they might not say nothing
but they will smile that's just the
nature of the filipina that is the
nature of the beast philippine is where
love is yeah you want some love in your
health to the oldest of b.e.e come on
down to the philippines don't stop
don't quit
don't stop cause if you stop if you quit
on your dream your dream gonna quit on
you i don't know about you man i don't
want my dream quitting on me
i don't and i won't quit on my dream if
i'm working for my dream i want my dream
working for me huh does that make sense
keep on going keep on doing it it's all
right man it's only a matter of time
you're halfway there
they can't keep this pandemic going on
forever
huh
that's what you need to say
hey
it won't last for a lifetime and it
won't last forever so deal with what you
got to keep on all right number four
getting ready go out the door let's go
got time to play that number four what
pace man pace what you mean by what you
mean page man
the temple i mean the speed of there the
area of the country you know it's
filipino time you know what filipino
time is right filipino time they don't
do nothing on time you say me be here at
4 pm you might see them at 4 30 4 45 5
o'clock
they do everything in the slow pace here
everything is like
uh
two two steps behind i mean every
they're not on time most of the time
some are but most of them that i've
dealt with are not most times you'll
deal with a filipino listen maybe
whatever such time you're gonna expect
them to be 30 minutes an hour the
everything is on a slow roll slow pace
so if you kind of guys don't like to you
don't have to be uh slow in the role of
it then you may not want to come here
because everything is not this is on
filipino time okay filipino times that
you don't watch nothing we take our time
doing everything yeah that's why we do
it because we do it because that way we
like it that way we like it we like it
like that
if you can't deal with that buddy i
might want to say uh is this for me see
a lot of you guys like this
where she ate
i told you to be the one here
you know i know you like that but that's
how i used to be
i was like what's here
i had no sense back then man i had i had
no sense i had no empathy i had no
compassion i had no sympathy
i didn't understand that they people one
in the world was like me and i want to
be on time and so i had to get used to
uh somebody not being and i'm talking at
least d my prior wife she was always
late man i don't care what it was
you know and it got me so who knows when
we first got my prior right well before
coming every time i turned around we got
to go so i had to wait i said look i'll
go in the car we get ready to go to
church
i didn't i'm sitting in the car
i'll take it i don't took
so you know but everything here is time
it takes time so i'm adjusting to it now
i've learned to deal with other people's
inadequacies and and not to expect that
everyone will be on my level as it
changes time i give them some leeway i
still make a standard time now but i
give them a 10 15 minute leeway now
beyond that 10 15 minutes you still
ain't you ready look man i got to go go
okay hey all right but time man slow in
the pace you know everything is slow
here ah we call it filipino time and
then it slows your momentum it slows
your tempo everything slow down calm
down don't worry don't hurry trust the
process okay that's what i had to learn
i had to learn and trust the process
even though people are late you know you
have to trust the process that whatever
you're doing whatever you're involved in
whatever you're engaged in at the time
will happen cap and if you want it to
happen time is only something that we
use as a measurement of when and how we
want to do something okay so they lay
that doesn't if you still want to do it
hey get it done it may be not on your
time screen for your time frame but it's
still on the right time frame when it's
done and all right are you with me let's
go last one man we finna go out there
come on come on let's go i ain't playing
number one number five peaceful man
that was why one of the main reasons i
didn't know was this peaceful
when i when i was visiting here because
i when you're visiting
the philippines when you come to on
vacation you're visiting it's a whole
nother realm it's a whole other
environment it's a whole number pace
it's a whole other level of living as as
compared to actually living here on a
day in day out but it's a whole totally
different i thought you know because
i've been here for five years i said
well i got this
i already know
[Music]
the united states you know all kinds of
stuff i saw that i didn't see when i was
visiting here for five years i didn't i
couldn't understand that's why i didn't
know like this
but it was it's like that's the way it
is when you when you move here even
though you visit here you're going to
notice a big difference one of the main
things i did
that bothered me a lot when i moved here
was not being able to see people with
the melanin in their skin like i had i i
very seldom there's more of us here now
but six years ago very seldom what i see
and that they're just like i don't want
to go outside man i can't see nobody
like me i don't want you know i just
wanted my part of time i didn't want to
go outside you know and so i had to get
used to that
and it was hard for me man because i
love my people and i love i love seeing
people like me and when i i'm not i'm
not i'm not putting asians down
everybody else down i'm just you know i
just raised up to see me and when i
didn't see it man
i had to do i had to learn that and so
things like that you will learn to deal
with as you move here and you have to
learn how to cope with that and get your
mind right now while you're waiting and
what i found out was a big bonus for me
that i had a very i developed a very
peaceful
manner i developed a very peaceful
demeanor and you know that's what this
country is all about most of the people
here are very very peaceful they're very
very calm natured people they're warm
they're receptive man and they will
they'll make you feel at home you know
when you leave your country and you come
here you're you're not going to go to
this to the step where you say well they
don't want me you know you're not going
to feel that way unless you unless you
found out with some scammer just want
your money but if you find the right
person that wants you hey you're going
to be at home you're going to feel
peaceful you'll be calm warm i learned
to relax here in the united states i was
so
tensed up man because everything for me
was like let's go man gotta go give me
your money okay you know that's what
when i got here i had to make an
adjustment
i had to make an adjustment because the
lifestyle here is not
go go go go lifestyle is it let's go
ahead and take your time
you know and they get it done but they
get it done in a slow effect so i had to
learn how to slow down my roll slow it
down but i still get it done and now i
feel much more relaxed and much more
calmer than i used to be but i still get
my things done i just do it in a
different pace and in a different way
and you'll find that out when you go
those are some of the things that
foreign men i i fall in love with the
philippines i gave you five man peace is
the answer and love is the way that's
what i always say that's my that's my
expression i made that up and that's
what i do i go by that i flow by that
and i sometimes i mow by that and even i
told by that peace is the answer mm-hmm
and that's supposed to be t-h-e not
pieces he is look
what's wrong with me
a piece of the answer and love is the
way okay remember that okay peace and
you'll find a lot of beautiful scenes
says here right there waters blue waters
crystal room blue waters and ladies
that's just so relaxed she said come on
i'm waiting for you i'm waiting for you
honey
come on man you mean you're gonna
disappoint her
you won't disappoint a beautiful
filipina just sitting up there counting
the days until she see you personally
face fake call cause you got tired
yeah you
you black man you got tired you
caucasian man you got tired you brown
man you got tired
you meant to how many times i got tired
in five years
i got tired every freaking day
every day i got tired i'm tiring on it
when i looked on the refrigerator door i
saw this d
and i realized i got something to work
for i got something to hopeful i got
something to go for and i renew my
strength i got i took a second breath
get me something to drink and let's go
that's how you got it you ain't got that
mentality man
if you don't have a mentality of
persistence consistency and and
determination you are not going to make
this journey
okay you know uh whenever you start out
whenever there's a group activity and
they have like several people start out
and then we all finished it we're gonna
finish but only a certain small
percentage will finish it to the end you
know why it's the ones that weren't
strong enough the ones that wasn't long
enough uh they did not make it and the
reason why they didn't make it is not
because they didn't have the ability to
make it
is because they got tired
and it gave up
you won't let
nothing defeat you if you really want so
if you get tired that's normal
understand that we all get tired i'm
tired of waiting some time myself
you
but you have to motivate yourself focus
yourself i told you the magic words
focus
determination persistence consistent and
ask yourself this single line underlying
question
what's the reason i started this journey
what is your reason
and if your reasons the lady is waiting
on you
how silly of you to disappoint a
dedicated individual that's loving you
every day of your life and waiting on
you how silly of you
how weak of you
okay
don't do it man don't quit
when you quit you cannot hit and you
want to hit that thing right that long
strong when you come to me all right
that's it hey one more time i'm gonna
run over this real quick five points i
gave you and we going to train right
y'all ready man i don't know what y'all
man i'm worried about trying now so we
talked about five things y'all uh that
foreigners falling low prices places to
people with pace and the peacefulness of
this country and people awesome things
man that will uh get your mind in the
right place when you think about
quitting you know i don't want to see
you quit on your dream i don't want to
see you feeling your goals your desires
in life and if you quit you might just
wind up resenting it you know
five let's say you quit this year i'm
tired of you i'm waiting for over two
almost two years
i'm quitting i'm done with it i told her
i caught up i told her i'm done okay
so what's your next step
um you quit you quit on that right you
got another what's your next plan
huh
you don't know
i don't know what it is
i'm done with this
you didn't mess yourself up you blocked
yourself in the box you cut off the
potential that you have with some
individual and for for something you
only know about
you know the lady was nice you know she
loved you you know you loved her but you
got tired you got weak and you waited
and you quit and you and you stopped
so somebody else can come along and pick
up your blessing on that filipino side
and you still running scurrying around
trying to figure out what you're going
to do come on man let's do let's finish
this thing anything worth doing is worth
finishing let's be a finish you know
what if you know what's saying mma mixer
martial laws you got to finish it
when you get in the fight
and you you got an opponent against you
there's two things you can do you can
you can give up or you can finish it and
i don't know about you
i want to finish anything i start if
it's worthy if it's worth it i want to
finish it to the end

train bobby listen one day who we got
paul he said yes when it's real you will
wait if it's not

you need to do it's a blessing to find a
pretty better lady right in my uncle
yeah if you have
a good point right paul if you have the
wrong one jaylen what i was talking to
you today was when you know you've got
the right one back okay
and you know that you know that you know
that you know that you know you got the
right hang with her but if you know that
you know that you know that you know you
got the wrong run baby
the wrong one baby let her go in that
rack
yeah but if you know
um like i told you i told you about
susan right i remember susan when i told
you i love someone i want to marry her i
found out
guess what she went the wrong one
bye-bye
so people told me some stuff about her
and i at first i didn't believe the
people then i followed up on what they
told me and i found out what they told
me with you she didn't even have the
decency to tell me the truth
so you know when you find out stuff like
that if they're not the right one you
have no business being with them
you're not going to be blessed with the
right the wrong one
you're not so if you notice she's not
the right one let her go if she is the
right one

your heart yeah yeah you know what in
your heart that she's the one
and uh
let me tell you how you're gonna know
she's doing what she loves you with
everything she's got you tell me if
you're a human being you can feel love
you know when people show you and do
things for you and you know how you
respond to it you feel so good inside
and they do things they don't have to do
for you and you know what jump beyond
the shadow of a doubt they don't have no
other man on you they're not cheating on
you you know that and all they do is
send love to you things good words and
good tired and good good teachings could

out of me i understand they understand
and you know the va seemed like they
should be your friend you spent time in
the military you got this injured
disability and they act like they don't
want to believe you you know and it's a
shame the things they take veterans
through just to give them the money that
they do you know you know they shouldn't
be that that difficult to get what you
do
i can see you know whatever you
understand some of these music rules
they have are for a reason because
there's a lot of people trying to cheat
them out of money trick them that they
got didn't end today but
for the veterans they have a true
uh uh uh a real injury and disability
they should be a streamlined process
that
i know this man is good but this is the
one trying to fake out that's the one
they need to put through all them
changes i'm saying not the one that got
the real you can prove everything you
said i showed the doctor this doctor

through this that's running through this
fast line the one that can't prove

most of people here care and love more
better and stronger than the people in

like about living here is that they
treat you with respect they don't look
at your color they treat you with
respect man and i don't know if that's

going to say something to say so let us
see he said so there still is no travel
to the philippines i am in brazil i love
it here but i still want to see you
see what day it is what day yeah there's
no travel here right now travel is
locked down
and that's a lot of different places
it's just locked down some places are
opening up now
but the philippines is not because of
the delta environment
it's like a second wave like actually a
third wave coming in and so the
hospitals are filled up right now
and uh people are lined up in the
hospitals around the side waiting for
bed to open that's how bad it is here uh
they have they were they called uh ecq
uh a community quarantine for manila
and uh they were going to extend it for
another week but they they dropped it
down to mdcq which is a less lesser a
lighter form of quarantine but yeah man
i know i've never been to been to brazil
but uh i i don't know how well they're
doing but
brazil has uh
president of boston belsonaro i think
bill sonaro and they talking about
getting him out they want to kick him
out of office because he didn't handle
the pandemic there well either ryan's
everybody really seen one nation we got
thinking man he said is it open back up
now man
now man it's not open up yet uh it's not
open up yet
uh
anything other than i don't know when
they're gonna open right now uh we can
you can guestimate and estimate but
that's not gonna do anybody no good uh
right now we're fighting a third wave of
the delta variant and uh it's very very
serious here uh this is a pandemic of
the unvaccinated so you're not
vaccinated uh and you run into that
corona virus it may take you through
some hoops and i don't want to see
anybody go out like that right everybody
easy one nation michael coffey need some
cop is it bobby hello a good day with
you i think a good day with your
filipina is the cebu ocean park i've
been there man uh across from the uh sm
seaside mall lots of fun there from yeah
i've been to seaside
but the seaside i went to mike wasn't
another i went to the ocean far seaside
that was that but this is the same thing
one is
when we went to the one in manila they
didn't have the one and see
boo yeah they just built that there in
the last like three years something like
that anyway but yeah you're gonna have
an ocean park it's like um wow
see sea world y'all been everybody have
been to sea world
ocean park is very similar to sea world
and they have a lot of ocean animal i
mean i got a picture where at least
indeed me took with a a seal i'm gonna
show that picture see you guys that i
should we we talked with at ocean park
in manila we took a picture with us hold
and seal y'all like let's get the fish
we still got it right train by really
see one nation michael carpenter need
some
treacherous filipinas and some of their
family members to the viking buffet and
restaurants yeah viking is good
uh we go there we've been there uh uh
one time we went there
by ourselves and then
uh buffet 101 international that's
similar to biking they have good food we
like buffet 101 better than viking
because they they have more better
variety of food but this they they both
have the same principle which is like
smorgasbord type eating ryan james
probably seen one nation spoon he said
uh in florida a woman laying on the
floor of a hospital became because there
was a
there's a no i see icu beds left but
these same people who are fighting this
vaccine in mass
uh what wanna run from their mouth
want to run their mouth about but yeah i
know
they're the anti-vaxxers they want to
talk trash talk this
and uh when they when it's their time to
get sick if they get sick they didn't
cut that talking out they started to
start crying
and they start begging
you know see how people do man as long
as it's not them they're gonna run their
mouth but as soon as they get it they
change like overnight because then they
begin to begin to feel the pain
that covariate 19 causes they be
beginning to feel the stress
strain on their body the inability to
intake air
they feel like you're suffocating they
begin to feel out of that but when you
feel that stuff then your attitude
changes
and it's you know sad that
all of that had to make their attitude
they don't listen that's what i say some
people just hard-headed you know and
some people cause their own problems in
life
i don't want to be like that i always
want to listen i want to kind of be the
kid like that hold on
i wasn't the kind of kid that you know
yeah i had to learn by getting a beating
or talking over them you tell me one
time and if it makes sense to me up here
i got you
you know i might i might not have him
twice whatever but you don't have to
tell me too many times if i i receive it
if you explain it to me in a way that i
get it i understand it i can it makes a
reasoning sense to me
i'm not going to fool i mean okay
but some of us don't we don't deal with
it like that we have to actually do it
if you tell us not to do something we
want to do it anyway you know they're
just crazy man you know listen
listen to the facts
listen to the science you know dr dr
falsey listen to people like that that
are in
in in charge and nobody talking about
professionals yeah don't listen to me
listen to the professionals i'm saying
the same thing they say but some people
don't don't consider me professional
they don't listen that's okay listen to
the perfect go to the whole website you
know it'll tell you all the facts about
this nasty stinking virus
called kobe
we had an alpha cover
a beta covered a theta kofi now we got
the delta and we've got a lambda right
after okay
they all bought one thing killing
and you know what that you know what i
mean right they what killing come from
devil devil come to what steal kill and
destroy that's what kobe are doing right
cover stealing killing and destroy lies
and so i like to think that kobe is from
the depth let's go around train bobby
see one night who we got
move what's up he said in florida a
woman laying on him okay i got that
sorry
i got there right uh
michael coffin he's in car he said bobby
hello when in the philippines go to the
atlanta supermarket by the filipino
family
some food buy the filipino family some
food then have
a buddha fight okay
yeah we had a we had our membership
landers but you know we stopped going in
the reason why because we we uh we found
out that we were spending more money
there because in landers you have to if
you buy
you can't just buy a single item it's
like walmart man you don't know but i
love what my what's called
you don't buy a single lighter you buy a
box so we were spending more money we
stopped we start going to landing but
that's a good idea uh uh michael
go there and buy the food and stuff you
know what that's amazing if you buy a
bunch of it you can wind up actually
saving a lot of money good idea thank
you roger everybody murphy hey what's up
man he's a gold finger
all the members in the house there
hoorah i'mma end it in the house
of all my members in the house
hey goldfinger man you got to do it
wrong every now and then man just let
you let your wings fly spread out your
wings
right right and bobby
florida texas georgia
ohio
mississippi okay
my why georgia got to be number three
because they got a dumb me
i'm sorry
because they got it uh
uh governor
that's not enlightened
the governor that's falling after the
orange man tactics okay and florida's
the same way okay that's why florida is
number one and florida has a no mass
mandate can you believe that man
they have a no massive mandate for the
entire state
can you care and school's starting to
start back up can you believe that
and tell them that's why ford is number
one the delta variant is raging before
they don't have no icu bed
and people are just dropping
and the people that have vaccine you
might get the virus but you're not going
to die that's why the vaccine is pretty
much guaranteeing you a life
you might get a little illness but
you're not going to die and that's the
that's the promising thing you have to
look forward to uh if i take that
vaccine
science
based on all the data is telling you
that you will live and not die i'll take
those odds any day round chain bob
releasing one nation who we got terry
fleming he said va will fight you tooth
and nail they want you to quit trying
for your do better because most quit
trying yeah i know man
i keep hearing about these from these
best today
when do they win but one thing for these
veterans veterans out there uh i heard
this story too and it's this is from a
guy that got the money
he was in the usa right
he applied for disability
oh man five or six times got turned down
turned down turned out
and then he moved out here
and guess what he did
he applied to the va here and they
approved him the first time boom okay
okay if they approved for the first time
so i don't know what the difference
between the va here and the idea but
maybe it's uh maybe because you're
overseas in melenia i don't know i don't
i don't know i'm telling you what the
guy told me
he was playing out there never got he
moved out here applied and then he gave
him back pain he said hi
they gave him backpack all the time he
would turn down and for the second time
he was black i'm telling you man hey
it's the difference when you go to
something like that right train bobby
who we got
[Music]
lisa rodriguez it probably good if you
have taken the pfizer and modern and
kobe 19 vaccines you will have to take a
booster shot into three months from
there okay i took mine in july
uh i took my uh my second shot in july
july august 10 october
i think i think i guess i might actually
be coming up in the next you know
several months i'll be waiting for them
to say that i'm in the philippines but
you know how slow they are so i might be
next year like
recently
it's been like two at two weeks ago now

one shot
so hers uh i understand john johnson
will come out with this first so she
might be you might take her before i do
rodrigu one nation we got
micro it's a bobby hello most patient uh
u.s nurses have in acute care hospice
hospitals from the delta variant are not
vaccinated yet that's why i keep telling
y'all man this is a virus for the
unvaccinated
you want to be
if you want to guarantee you're not
dying i'm not saying guarantee you're
not getting a virus but guaranteeing
you're not dying not for 99 of time not
100 but 99 if you vaccinated you will
not die you might get a little illness
some people that have the vaccine and
get the virus many of them have
asymptomatic they don't even feel it you
know but they when they do the test it
shows in the system okay so but when
they have to do that they have to
isolate because even though they're not
sick it still could be transmitted to
others ryan trained by releasing one who

ryan train bobby lazy one night and
rhythm go you just told the j not sure
about mixing vaccines yet there's my
what's your recommendation for booster
okay good question uh i'm gonna get if
they say here's the thing about the
[ __ ]
the the what i've heard is some people
say it's okay to take the booster some
people said they haven't they're not
sure yet but the usa just proved
i recommended that we take boosters and
they're starting except sometime in
september some people of the without an
immuno compromise will be taking
boosters so i'm like this
if they say i need to take a booster i'm
going to take it but if you're the kind
of guy if you got to have problem with
the boot but to shop before
you might want to consider not taking
this check with your doctor that'd
probably be the best suggestion right
everybody needs to wonder who we got
remember he said the local walmart joke
through here it's mixing margarita and
georgia okay you know what man
they say uh
i've heard both ways you don't want to
do it and then something i don't see no
problem with me personally i'm not a
doctor and not like that but i don't i
don't see any problem mixing long as it
works man you know what i'm saying
uh and i told you three people out here
i've been taking three shots some people
taking three shot and they're getting
prosecuted because it's illegal i had to
take three shots right now because it
has not been approved but
i really don't see any issues with it
but uh uh
i would i would if i had an opportunity
to take a johnson johnson right now i
would take it

no that's not okay i got another i got
another comment hold on
uh
michael he said uh bobby hi your booster
shot is for the kobe 19 vaccines
variance beta and delta okay to help
contain the virus please take your
booster from okay so mike is saying that
the the booster
is regarding the variance okay
so because as we know
many of the the shots the buddha kobe 19
vaccines
their their efficacy rates fall
when as it pertains to the variant the
delta variance okay
so
the booster what that does is targets
the delta variant and it helps your
efficacy rate goes back up where you
will not get the delta variant okay it
may help you protect this better for for
the belt to vary good good information
mike appreciate that all right let's go
