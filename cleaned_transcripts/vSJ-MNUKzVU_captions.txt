good morning from Davao I'm trying to get 
breakfast now I realize that I am in this  
country for like six seven weeks now and I 
never had traditional Filipino breakfast so  
I'm trying to change that today um let's 
see what I can find I know there are some  
restaurants on the corner here let's hope 
they are selling Filipino breakfast um I'm  
not sure what to expect about Filipino breakfast 
I read about some dishes before on the internet
something like that hello but I'm also open 
to try anything else as long as it's typical  
Filipino breakfast let's see what we can 
find oh there's a seafood restaurant here  
um they do have some food options here
maybe I can ask someone that might 
be the best option to ask the local
breakfast like I worry about Tucci log or tapsiloc  
there sir just press the wrong 
sausage oh yes yeah and this one
seasick yes sir I got something different 
right oh yes yeah ah but also good oh yes  
sir what what is typical breakfast here 
like do you eat turkey look for breakfast  
yes yeah that's breakfast and seasick yes 
sir also breakfast this place is open yes  
it opens it ah oh okay have a look thank 
you very much oh okay um she's sick okay
and I have a menu here
let's have a look our different types of Seasick 
I never tried seasick before so that's another  
dish on my list to try actually adobo yeah you 
saw me trying this dish before Oh we have the  
breakfast dishes here Topsy lock 2C log bang C 
log these are the dishes that I wrapped before  
uh I read that these are typical breakfast 
dishes so maybe we can try it right here  
let's see what else they have shakes here oh yeah  
I really like to have fruit shakes in the 
morning of red fresh fruits in general
let's see if I can get food here hello 
can I get food here I would like to eat  
a Filipino breakfast and I heard this is 
breakfast right available right this is
not available not available
maybe I can sit right here 
by the road or maybe here
um actually do they have coffee
um I think I'm getting an iced tea on on the side
I'm having a hard time doing coffee in the morning 
not every morning but sometimes I do so like iced  
Americano or iced cappuccino something like that 
and I think I've never seen like a coffee store  
by the side of the road here in the Philippines 
before so maybe this is not a coffee drinking  
country also cheese I think not that popular to 
be honest maybe I'm wrong if I'm wrong correct  
me in the comment section but uh yeah of course 
you have like cafes where you can find coffee  
actually let me ask if they have coffee 
here excuse me do we have coffee here  
no coffee just the iced tea yes okay then I 
get the iced tea you also have a fruit here  
fruit shake fresh fruit shake hello hello oh 
hello hello is sweet right no I don't I don't  
want to sleep now you have these shakes shake 
like mango or watermelon watermelon Shake yeah  
okay can I get a watermelon Shake as well yeah 
and no sugar please okay no sugar coffee is not  
so popular here right yes it's very hard to find 
coffee sometimes yeah jalapeno don't drink coffee
okay okay thank you very much
maybe we can try to find a 
coffee after this meal here okay
what that means so we have to shake here the 
tea the water so this is a soy sauce okay  
okay you just said there are no bones in the fish 
so I don't want you to be that careful and Okay so  
this is what it looks like so we have basically 
just plain rice I think and fried egg and the  
fish here yeah thank you oh that's okay no 
problem what was the the name of the fish again
this is and c-lock is always rice with rice 
egg and iced tea ah so like Topsy lock is then  
topsiest I think meat right yes so chopsy lock so 
then underneath with your rice beef yeah okay okay
so so silok means rice and egg ah okay okay thank 
you very much okay so I learned something new  
today different sea lock onions and yeah this 
is my first time trying this dish my first time  
trying typical Filipino breakfast if you are 
from the Philippines watching this let me know  
in the comment section what is your most popular 
breakfast what do you usually eat in the morning  
what other breakfast food do I have to try 
next time but uh first let me try the shake
or watermelon having three drinks 
here now the iced tea try that next
typical iced tea I will say maybe sweet
so I think I can maybe squeeze the  
I think you call it calamansi here 
this little line over the fish
and this is a chili over there which 
I'm sure probably not going to use okay
let's get out of so let me see where 
I will place the camera probably here
okay the meal doesn't look that special but 
sometimes these simple looking meals are the best  
let me try to fish right away
ah the meteor looks very soft really nice
looks like this you know
so he's had no bones so I don't need to be careful
oh oh this is really good I like the the 
crunchy crust around it like uh the the  
crunchy parts around it and then they're very 
soft meat that's a very nice combination okay
a little soup on the side
oh this is very good so far I really 
like the fish so I guess there are the  
rice and the egg is just rice and egg 
probably nothing too special about that
there
oh all my favorite the egg yolks 
if it's like soft like this and  
then you can mix it with your eyes 
uh that's the best oh I love this
wow
he said something about a 
soup on the side for free
so beef soup yeah okay it's a very very good 
yummy yeah it tastes very good thank you very much
oh this is very good oh so having this 
soup here now which I think is just a broth
okay
oh yeah that's the typical raw flavor  
or maybe I can use the broth to make the 
rice a little bit more um how do you say  
that not so dry anymore you know because 
the rise alone is of course a little bit dry
is the best part you look at this we 
have the crunchy part on the outside  
and then the soft meat right here oh this is nice
and the crunchy part is very flavorful 
probably they put some special  
sauce around it or some ingredients 
it's very very nice and oh by the  
way yesterday something happened here 
which was a little bit scary for me  
I'm just sitting here editing a video 
and suddenly the whole room is shaking
I think it stopped now wow was this 
an earthquake oh that was super scary
oh first time that I uh realized or 
experienced an earthquake that was scary
I think it stopped now it was like for 
I don't know like 10 seconds maybe but  
suddenly the whole room was shaking the desk was 
shaking and I was like what is going on here now  
that seems to be all okay now I mean nobody 
seems to be in a very everything normal outside
oh that was a little bit scary for like a few 
seconds I was like what is going on what should I  
do now oh okay so and I just Googled it earthquake 
today estimated magnitude 4.7 earthquake  
uh at 405 it is now 4010 so it was here a few 
minutes ago and you can see the center is here and  
I am here so yeah everything okay here now I hope 
everything is also okay in the center which is  
here according to this uh 29 kilometers away from 
me I think who okay so yeah that was my first time  
experiencing an earthquake um yeah a little bit 
scary but yeah luckily uh everything's still all  
right here nothing really bad happened do you hear 
that there's a man with a bicycle driving by him
and I'm wondering what the speaker is saying 
I heard I heard that room before I was like  
Tahoe something like that so it's a man 
on a bicycle and he sells something out  
of a box I think and then the 
the speaker thing I think Tahoe  
I'm wondering what he sells if you know what 
let me know in the comment section please  
so the meal is finished and yeah it was really 
good really really enjoyed this meal so I will  
definitely eat this again and next time I'm going
