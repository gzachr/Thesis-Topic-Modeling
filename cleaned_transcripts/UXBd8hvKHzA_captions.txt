Good afternoon from a wet
and cold day here in Manila.
I'm joined with Roy.
Wow I'm wet.
That's a puddle.
Um, my shoes are soaking
now, but I'm joined with Roy.
We're heading, uh, down
here to a street food place.
It's called Ugbo and it's one of the most
famous areas in Manila for street food.
Right? You can get everything that you can imagine.
We're gonna get halo halo, even
though it's super cold and icy.
Uh, but we're gonna eat lots
of delicious fried street food.
Everything that I love.
When, uh, coming to a new country, trying
out the local cuisines and whatnot.
So we've got our lift, we got our tricycle
and we're navigating through the wet
streets of Manila at the moment, I think.
Uh, yeah, it's actually just over here.
And, uh, it's around 4:00 PM at the
moment and it's just opening up.
Hopefully they have cover.
Oh, that looks cool.
Oh yeah perfect.
There's like tarps and stuff that
are, you can eat all kinds of things.
You got famous Korean.
Egg drop sandwich.
Maybe that'll be our first first meal.
Oh my God.
It's so wet.
Thank you very much.
All right.
Let's chill here and compose ourselves.
And then we can decide, uh,
what we want to eat first.
Um, what do you recommend?
What's like the most.
Famous dishes here in the Philippines.
Oh we have the ihaw, like the grilled food here.
Grilled food is -
Maybe we have to walk there.
Yeah.
All right well.
Hey bro.
Once we decide what we're doing, I'll
bring you along for the journey, Tara na.
Let's do it.
It's the best one?
Yes.
Do you like halo halo?
Yes.
It's good.
It's good.
Very good.
So we see halo halo down there,
which is like, It is one of the most
famous foods here in the Philippines.
I think I need some proper food first and
then we can eat desserts, uh, later on.
But I think this double egg, double cheese,
egg sandwich is calling my name, Roy.
Yeah, but I'm worried about ordering it because
you know what, I'm gonna run over I'll order.
And then maybe I can get go there.
Yeah, I can get behind them.
And, uh, then I can film the cooking process.
All right.
3, 2, 1.
Hello.
I would like one, uh, double
cheese, egg sandwich, please.
I can have one? One double cheese, egg sandwich.
Okay?
Yeah double, double cheese, egg sandwich.
I need to get undercover here.
We can scoot in here.
The rain always makes everything so interesting.
Everybody, the streets quiet down, and
you have to seek for cover, but this is what
happens when you're traveling to Philippines.
During the rainy season, you have like a
couple hours during the day where it's perfect.
And then in the evening times it starts bucketing
down as the heavens open and the rain,
it comes on in.
So this is the egg, it's like scrambled egg?
We've got this sandwiches being cut and,
uh, we'll see what the cooking process is.
There's all kinds of things.
They've got sauces, they got spices and
whatnot, but what else do they have on the menu?
They got double ham, egg, cheese sandwich.
We got the Korean sausage, egg, and cheese
sandwich or bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich.
But I just want the double cheese, egg sandwich.
As soon as you see.
Cheese in anything on the menu,
you know, I'm all over it.
I love my cheese.
I love cheese, bro.
All that good stuff.
And uh, I think it's gonna be cooking.
You have, you have the VIP service.
Will they cook it here or here?
Do you know?
Okay on that one.
There's balut there.
Balut? Where?
The blue tent.
Yeah.
Oh, over there.
That's like the fermented bird egg thing, right?
The mini Pokemon.
- The mini Pokemon, oh, I like trying new
food, so I'm not sure how adventurous I am this
early into the series to be eating a fermented bird
egg thing.
We'll have to try it out at some point.
What are they saying about you?
We're a couple.
Oh yeah.
Good very good.

Oh.
So funny out here in the Philippines.
Everyone's so friendly, but what else have we got?
We got all house of DG.
All right.
The butter has arrived and now it's time
to get this cooking process under way.
The bread gets butted up,
kind of like French toast.
It kind of crisps it off, both sides,
get it all in there and you can already
see how soft that bread's gonna be.
I am, uh, super excited to get my lips over
that it's gonna be, I love the smell of butter.
Butter just makes everything good.
As you can see, we got body going in there.
We got the egg, the scrambled
egg already scrambled.
I imagine it's gonna be, uh, put in
there and just kind of like reheated
and given that extra crispy taste.
All infuse with that butter that
it's just sizzling in there.
Oh, we got the fresh, fresh egg.
There we are.
We ordered the one with the double cheese.
So you already know there's gonna have to be
a lot of cheese, not just a single cheese.
We're gonna get two X the amount.
So, uh, oh, it already smells so delicious.
I'm super excited for this.
The smell of street food 
here into Philippines.
It's delicious.
How many years have you been working here for?
10 years on the same street? Wow.
Every, every day?
Wow.
10 years straight.
I'm getting distracted by the timeframes here.
We need to keep an eye on the eggs.
Look it up, starting to crisp up, turn
into a little bit of a omelet as you see.
And those bits of Brad data
look so delicious, crispy, buttered.
On the outside, hot, warm in the middle.
Oh yeah.
You can see how much it's in raining.
They all have to push over the tarps to make
sure that the water doesn't pile in this lady.
Oh, look at this.
There's a big bubble.
Oh.
So much water.
And it's dripping through.
All right, here we go.
We got this is mayonnaise or? Secret sauce.
Secret sauce in the middle.
The eggs are being slowed down a little bit.
I think they're all done there.
All this different kinds of sauce.
We got cheese, nice bit of cheese on there.
More cheese, more.
How do you say more in, uh, tagalog?
I don't know, more.
- More more.

And then the eggs you can see they're almost done.
She slides it on.
It gets slid on like that.
And then there, we have it, everybody.
That is what we ordered the
double cheese, egg sandwich.
I think those two are for other people.
I think maybe that fellow there, but here.
What else?
Just on the right there.
Oh, even more.
Amazing.
I love that. You can't, you can't
get enough cheese in your life.
You can never go wrong.
Oh, a bit of bacon on top.
And only for that one, unfortunately
we didn't order that, but it would've
been a great oh, more cheese.
Oh yeah we should have gotten like.
Like a bacon, egg and cheese.
You want bacon?
Uh, no, they have to cook it again.
It's okay.
Oh, what's this?
Parsley.
Oh, nice.
Oh, this looks delicious.
I'm so I'm so hungry.
Yeah, I'll eat it here.
Yeah.
Should we eat -
Should we eat here?
Or we can eat like.
- Yeah, we can eat there.
I think 75 pesos.
So a $1.50 or so, but the street's
starting to get a little bit more busy.
You can see all these like
different ice creams and stuff.
We got master Korean.
Oh, red dog cheddar.
All these cool little foods
I have to come back here.
Definitely at a later date as well
and try everything on the street.
We got this little conjunction
of quail eggs and whatnot.

We have it.
The double egg.
Double cheese, egg sandwich,
just cheese sauce in there.
That's parsley on top.
You can see the egg in the middle, the, uh,
the buns or the bread got sliced in half.
You got butter on the outside
and I've got all crispy.
We've got slices of cheese in there as well.
It's dripping everywhere.
Look at that.
let's get a big mouthful of
this and, and try it out.
The cheese is oozing.
- It's dripping everywhere.
That,
is delicious.
Wow.
The butter on the side of the bread kind
of makes it taste like French toast.
And I absolutely love French toast.
That is actually.
So good, and only like a $1.50
for this. We got the sauce dripping down.
Look all the sauces down to the bottom there.
At least you've got a double cheese -
Two slices of cheese in there.
We got the cheese sauce as well.
I'm devouring this.
Look at that guys.
Omelet and the sauce dripping out.
You can see the slice of cheese are starting
to melt as well due to the heat of the omelet.
And, uh, man, man, this is good.
Bro if you live here, you won't get hungry.
It is the most convenient place to live.
Step outside your house and can eat
anywhere.
Oh, wow.
This is actually incredibly good.
I'm devouring it.
I just got a really big slice of cheese too.
You can see that little bit
of cheese straight into.
But I think the favorite part about this
is that, you know, it's a rainy day.
It's a lot, um, cooler than
it usually is here in Manila.
And this is warm.
This warms you all up.
Last little bites here.
She's saying masarap.
I approve.
That was goddamn delicious.
What did she say?
I don't know, masarap something.
Wow right.
Let's clean up here and then we'll head
back and, and, and pay 75 pesos for that.
So good.
Oh, look, Roy.
Your VIP service is back.
Oh yeah.
You want to avail her?
She knows that we're leaving
and we need the VIP service.
All right, man.
That was incredible.
Look at this streets all the way down.
There's street food on the side left,
right, we got limes, little juices.
We got all kinds of things.
What are those?
Ah, are they corn dogs?
Oh my God, man.
That's bacon with rice.
I might have to move out here.
This is just so delicious.
All right, let's pay them.
Thank you so much.
There you go.
You can keep the changes.
Okay.
Thank you.
Delicious masarap.
I approve let's
uh, go on to the next food item.
Guys look what we have here.
As soon as you see a menu with cheese, cheese,
cheese, cheese, cheese, and more cheese.
You know, Luke, Damant's gonna be there.
So we're gonna get ourselves a good old corn dog.
You have so many options.
You got the classic hot dog, just one
filled with, uh, with a juicy hot dog.
You got the Koreans one with
sausage, the cheddar cheese, one.
This is where they get better.
The ones that have cheese in the middle, we got
the mozza sausage, one with, uh, a bread filled
hot dog and mozzarella cheese or the full one.
Oh, that's literally just bread and cheese.
Everyone's so friendly.
All right I think we will go for, can I
please have one mozza sausage?
Do you want one?
No.
Which one would you -
Oh yeah.
It's -
Is that a block of cheese and hot dog?
Oh, my God deep fried Oreos.
This is literally the place
to be deep fried Oreos.
Your cheese options.
You almost get run over by tricycles every
three seconds, but, um, let's see what the, oh,
So this is, what is she making it right now?
Is this one for me?
Oh yeah.
Oh, so you can see the cheese there's batter
that it goes into and that's gonna create.
Uh, kind of like the bit that gets fried.
And I imagine it goes, comes outta that
gets a bit of bread crumbs and then
chuck it in the big, hot, deep fryer.
And it turns out like this, you can
get, uh, mustard, ketchup, whatever
you want, but here we go, oh.
These are my favorite kinds of food.
Like deep fried with cheese in it.
Like, I don't think anything is
better than deep fried bread or deep.
Anything with cheese in a middle,
but look at that.
Yeah.
And how much is it only like
60 pesos, just over a dollar.
That's all the batter in there.
She's making sure that it's all hot and ready.
So as soon as it goes into this, oh that's hot.
I can feel it as soon as it goes in,
it's just gonna be sizzling and that's
gonna be done in a matter of seconds.
So I'm excited to see this. It's time.
To get coated on all sides, the bread
crumbs, and then boom, look at that.
That is how you make a corn dog, everybody
right in front of your eyes, fresh as.
It started off as a stick, the cheese,
the sausage got put on side, it got added
to the batter, added to the breadcrumbs.
And now it's being added to
the crispy hot boiling oil.
Is this one for you?
Yeah.
What one did you get?
- The full mozza.
The full mozza oh, literally
there's bread and cheese.
It's only cheese.
It's just two block of cheese.
Oh, you you've been hanging out with me too long.
it's literally just like deep fried cheese.
Oh my God.
I have to come back here and grab that one
after my one's starting to be golden crispy
brown, and it's starting to look a whole lot.
The pictures up there.
I think on my one, I'll just
get ketchup up down the side.
That'll, uh, be a pleasant
and enjoyable experience.
I don't think I've seen a better menu in my life.
With pictures like that.
Yeah.
Like bacon with cheese spicy bacon,
hot dog egg nuggets with egg.
You got your desserts deep fried Oreos right here.
They get chuck in the middle and
you can see, oh, it's starting to go
real golden, crispy, golden brown.
I didn't realize there's
no hot dog in my, my order.
Yeah, you just, it's just, you just
got cheese and it's coming out.
she's having to do, uh, quick
surgery to make sure it doesn't bleed
to death of cheese.
House of DG is
like a family owned business.
Oh, house of DG.
DG stands for duty? Duty girls?
So they're mostly girls.
Oh really?
Do they only have,
stores on, uh, this street or they have them all
around Manila or the Philippines all along here.
So it's like a monopoly.
You guys own the whole street.
All of that is house of DG.
I imagine if we continue going down
there, we'll see a whole lot more.
House of DG, but guys, how
can you not love this place?
You go and have your, your main meal or
you start off with a appetizer, like an egg
cheese sandwich, come and get your main meal.
And then you pop over about two meters and
then you have dessert right on your doorstep.
It's literally perfect.
But here we go.
That's your one, right?
Yeah.
That little cheese sauce here.
Cheese sauce as well.
You can load it up with either more.
You want cheese sauce and ketchup?
Yes, please.
More cheese.
The better.
Look at that.
Wait, which one's yours?
That one's mine.
Yeah yeah.
I thought so.
So you're gonna have a cheese overdose.
Yeah.
- Literally.
Melted cheese crumbed, and then added
more cheese to the top.
I'm following the steps of Mr. Cheese Paratha man.
I've taught him well.
Okay.
Thank you.
Where can we?
Well, we can eat at house of DG, right?
Perfect.
It's good that they have seating
like outta the rain, especially when
you're vlogging, you need a stable place.
All right.
Here, we have it.
The, uh, What was it?
The full mozza or no, you got the full mozza.
Mozza sausage.
Oh, this is mozza sausage.
Well, I remember having like corn
dogs at the circus and like festivals
in Australia when I was younger.
So when I saw on the menu, I was
like, oh, I gotta have, I haven't had them
for ages, but let's, uh, give it a try.
We've got cheese on the top, ketchup on the
top sausage and cheese in the middle, all
surrounded by a, uh, a bit of deep fried batter.
That is, masarap!
Very masarap.
Cheese everywhere.
I don't even know where the sausage
is, but I'm not complaining.
Oh!
Yours is even cheesier.
I'm about halfway through.
I'm trying to figure out where the sausage is.
All right good to go.
Wow yours is literally just deep fried cheese.
Oh my God.
It doesn't stop.
It never ends.
It's infinite cheese hack.
I'm having trouble eating this.
I can't bite it.
There we go.
I almost choked on the cheese, but this is
so delicious guys as you'd expect anything
that's like deep fried add cheese onto it.
Add like some
toppings on top as well.
And it's like delicious, but where look at
that, and it's kinda like crispy on the outside.
And then on the inside,
it's been like half cooked.
So it's like a soft doy batter.
It makes it so delicious, but I'm sure we're
gonna have to be reaching the sausage part sooner.
Wait, you haven't reached the sausage?
No.
It's just more cheese.
But I'm not complaining at all.
Guys,
we did it.
We finally made it to the sausage.
And it's delicious, super hot as well.
Man so it must have been the
sausage, first cheese at the top.
That's why we had literally, every mouth
was just stringy cheese coming off.
But
you all know how much I love cheese.
I'm not complaining at all with
a little bit of excess diabetes.
When it comes to cheese.
When you get bored with your food, you
can actually just play with it, spin it
around, like this, get it to the end.
Oh.
And then, oh,
Sausage cheese, corn dog done.
That was delicious.
What a great start to the food street
video here in, in the Philippines.
Oh, that's delicious.
How's the cheese overload?
I can't finish it.
You can't finish it?
I understand cheese gets the best of you
sometimes, but, um, I'm gonna go pay quickly.
Yeah, just over here.
So it should be, I got the mozza
sausage and Roy got the full mozza, so
it should be around a 130.
So is one 40.
Thank you
That's okay.
You can keep the change.
You have halo halo?
Yes, sir.
- Ah, perfect.
What is, oh, is this a 50 cup?
So we got, oh, the super special,
the special and the regular.
Is this what it looks like?
You eat the, no.
- It's just a cover.
That's just the cover.
So what is halo halo?
Looks like -
lot of beans, ice cream, like mixed ice cream ice.
Oh, it looks different dessert.
Uh, which one do you recommend?
Like, what's a good one because
this is like the most famous place
in the Philippines you were saying.
Yeah, let's get this super special.
Ah halo halo.
Corn, corn.
- Corn?
Corn and ice cream.
The bottom there is corn and
then banana.
What's at
the bottom of this one?
- Beans, gulaman, everything.
Interesting.
All right yeah, let's do this one.
You want one, two?
No, no, no.
Okay just one please.
Thank you.
Where do you, where, where do you make it?
It's made here? Oh, this is a cool little shop.
Have a little seating area.
You got the outside area.
This guy's enjoying his halo halo.
Oh, look at all these.
You remember ube?
- Oh, that's what I had, the sweets right?
So it adds all kinds of like
beans, that's banana?
Oh, beans.
Yes.
Wow.
Like literally a mix of everything.
And this is?
Gelatin.
Ah, so it really just is like a
Mixture of.
- Mixture of everything.
Every single thing you can find in the fridge.
And then we got the ice being made.
Or being shaved off.
Wow.
It's a really interesting mix.
You have like ice, you got different kind
of beans.
- This is the inside of a coconut.
Oh inside of a coconut?
Inside of a,
coconut mixed with, uh, jelly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, and what is this stuff?
Oh it's kinda
like mixing it with all the ice.
It's getting
soaked in there.
And Roy, you were saying, this is like the
most famous place in the Philippines here.
What's it?
What's it called?
Wow.
How many, like how long have they been here for?
Two years?
Two years? Is that all? And then -
And they're that famous?
All right cool.
I missed out on so much.
So those ice cream?
Yes.
And this is?
Egg, something.
All right, chuck it all in there.
It really is a mixture.
Wow.
That's done?
Yeah.
Wow.
All right well, this is something I've
never had anywhere in the world.
Thank you.
Salamat.
We will eat inside.
It is big.
I should have opted for the small size so
I could, um, so I could save space for the
rest of the street, but here we have it guys.
The halo halo.
This is the like one of the most
famous dishes here in the Philippines,
you know, got all kinds of ice.
Ice cream sweets, your beans at the, the bottom
that are like, oh, that's like really warm.
That's really cold and whatnot,
but let's give it a taste test.
It is kind of like weird to
have beans and ice cream.
Yeah together.
I think just my opinion, but if a taste
good, then the opinion might change, but
let's just get a mixture of this to begin.
So, what were you, what were you saying?
This is what?
- That was the letche flan.
It's made out of egg.
All right.
So it's kind of mixed in with the ice.
Let's try it out.
That was very sweet.
Yeah.
That's super sweet.
It's like super soft as well.
It's a weird, really, really interesting
like texture, but we had some
of the ice, he added some like weird
milk in there as well or something.
That's why it's kind of.
Got the creamy, uh, look, to it as well.
So sweet and there's purple stuff here.
I actually had it in like a sweet yesterday
and I I'm pretty sure I enjoyed it, but
let's get it mixed in with everything else.
Oh
- That's good,
right?
I love this stuff.
Yeah.
Ube was the one I really enjoyed
when we were at, um, Divisoria.
And it kind, it's such a cool
color, such a deep, uh, purple.
It like kind of overpowers all the
other colors that are in there.
You might want to mix everything.
That's how you do?
Yeah.
Because I was wondering, I'm like, oh,
you get through all of this stuff.
And then you're just like
eating beans at the bottom.
Alright.
Let's mix it all up.
Yeah because there's all that like red.
Um, gelo and stuff in there as well.
Yeah.
Coconut as well.
Yeah.
There we go.
Now it's looking, is that like how they do it?
Yeah.
- Yeah.
Mix it more, especially at the bottom.
Yeah.
It's a proper color.
Yeah I was wondering it look
look too clean before now.
It's like a, a big mixture of everything.
Oh, look at this little, uh, shred of, pink coconut.
All let's try this now.
Ah, yeah.
Because now it's like all icy and everything.
Ah, it's so cold.
Oh, you like chew the ice as well.
That's a really delicious flavor.
Everything's mixed in there.
You can see the beans in there as well.
We've got all the ice like
shaved, uh, shaved off in there.
All the, uh u-u-ube.
So many different things that I'm learning
on the spot here.
- Like the sweet potato.
Tell you what, it's not what I was expecting.
I thought like halo halo, was just kind of like
ice cream and shaved ice with all these different
other kinds of things, but the ube makes
it, I absolutely love, uh, love the purple ube.
There's a lot of beans there.
Ooh, so cold.
Yeah.
Brain freeze.
Oh my God.
It's actually difficult to eat.
Like how cold and crunchy ices you,
like, you get a spoonful of this and
it's literally just like, you're chewing
onto ice blocks or something like that.
But can you drink it as well?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So I think after like melts a little bit.
Starts to get more liquidity, but
we do have to mix this all up again.
We need to get the beans down the bottom in there.
Yeah.
Well, there's also some sugar at the bottom.
Oh, all right.
We're getting messy.
Let's give it a sip.
Here.
That was delicious.
There's condensed milk in there, I think which gives it
like the creamy taste, but it really is just
like a whole different, like you say, what
you're saying, halo halo translates to mix mix?
Literal translation is mix mix.
And it literally is just like a mixture
of every single thing you can find in the
cupboard, in the fridge, on the shelf, on
the kitchen bench, chuck it all in there.
And if you do it with the right amount
of ingredients, it ends up being like
a really delicious, uh, dessert slash
snack that you can, uh, enjoy here in the
Philippines.
- Especially during the summer.
All right, let's finish this off.
And, uh, we'll pay, I think it was
like 50 pesos, around a dollar.
Now I'll try and get a little bit, look at that.
So down the bottom, all the like
solid, heavier bits have gone.
If I pulled up, then you get a mixture of the
beans, every single thing that's in there.
So, whoa, they tried attacking me.
Oh.
It is pretty, it is pretty weird to
be eating beans like with cold ice.
I will say that it's the first
time that I've had that, but.
I'm enjoying it.
It is actually a really like
unique texture and flavor.
I approve masarap.
Very, very masarap.
I like, I like.
Let's finish this off guys, and we'll
head back out for some more adventures.
There you go.
Thank you so much.
I do actually need the change running low on it.
I only have big notes and you're here
watching the videos from the first day.
I didn't have any change.
I ended up paying like a thousand
paces for pineapple and whatnot.
So.
Thank you, salamat.
Thank you.
Delicious masarap masarap.
All right.
The food street is becoming more lively.
Everybody look at this.
No, thank you.
Can I see it though?
oh my God guys.
I may try this at some
point, but right now I can't.
Um, but.
So inside, there's like a mini bird.
Yeah a mini Pokemon.
- A mini Pokemon.
Like charizard or something.
Yeah, I would love to, but I cannot.
Thank you. Guys,
I can't do it yet.
I do love trying foods.
Oh, almost got run over.
I do love trying foods, but only, uh, when it's
cheese that's involved, not a fermented bird.
So let's walk down here.
We'll walk down to the end of the street.
We'll see what happens.
Along the way.
You wanna have some fun for one night, Roy?
Yeah, no.
He's asking you for a massage.
- Massage.
Only if it involves a, uh, a happy ending.
I wish I was filming.
Uh, I walked fast.
They'll saying all kinds of things.
Uh there's so many
cool little street foods.
A lot of the things here are,
uh, like seafood related.
So we've got prawns, sushi,
all kinds of different things.
A lot of meat like here, sausage
drinks, we got potato chips, kind of
like the tapioca chips I had in Sri Lanka.
Hello!
How are you?
Good?
They got corn dogs as well.
They even have Shawarma!
But I can't imagine it's any better than
what it has been and the ones that I've
had in the middle east king of shawarmas.
I reckon the middle east, well, I know the middle
east is, but Lebanon, they have some damn good
shawarma there.
Hey, how are you guys?
Good?
What are you guys selling?
Sizzling.
Oh, look, Australian ribs.
Australian T-bone.
You have?
What is all this?
What is that?
Tongkatsu.
Tongatu?
What, what meat? It is
meat?
Uh, no, no, no, no.
Ah pork.
Wow so many interesting things to it's like
such a change in like foods that I'm
used to, obviously like a lot of like
south Asia, India, Pakistan, for example,
they have a lot of like similar foods.
Obviously they have unique foods to,
uh, the specific areas, but here in
the Philippines, I haven't traveled
much to south Southeast Asia guys.
That's why I'm so excited.
Now that Southeast Asia is starting to open up.
I can like come and show all the different foods
and the different cultures that they have here.
So we're gonna be trying a whole lot of
different foods over our time here in the
next couple of months, as we continue to
travel around, they even have a basketball going on.
All right so this is where we ate the
Korean egg sandwich, but just.
Here when we were here, I was like,
oh my God, this is probably the
most amazing way to get diabetes.
You can get, uh, Oreo overload,
you get the kitkat ones.
Nutella the perfect way to have a heart attack.
So we're gonna put ourselves halfway to that
after eating all the cheese that we've had.
And by getting to the other half.
We're gonna eat a ton of ice cream
and chocolate live in a dream.
Well, what one do you want Roy?
- What would you get?
I personally love a good old Oreo overload, Oreo
big scoop of ice cream filled with Oreos, crushed
Oreos, more sauce, more chocolate and syrup.
That is also true.
Cause I saw that lady there has a damn big cup.
So we made the mistake of, coming
here and going heavy with the
eating and heavy with the carbs.
First I'm super filled up.
Oh, that's perfect.
Could I please have one Oreo overload?
And you want?
- Um, what do you reckon?
Milo for energy.
Yes, please.
Oh, you want kitkat?
Yeah kitkat.
That's a good, that would be my
second choice, but Oreo is always superior.
Oh, is that, is that it Oreo.
Oh, that looks I'm happy with my choice.
Very happy with the choice.
It looks delicious.
So back again with the house of
DG, they're gonna hook us up there.
Let's uh, I think this one's for me, so,
oh, he gets all the sauce in there.
The chocolate sauce,
chocolate syrup.
And now it's time to add a
couple of scoops of ice cream.
It is vanilla?
Yeah.
Very good.
Whipped cream.
Oh, whipped cream.
Oh, we get more than one.
We got two, three.
Is this a third one?
Or is this oh three?
Geez.
Yeah, the cup is small.
Yeah.
Right.
Is this a -
Okay I was gonna say that was going in my one as well.
I would've been worried, but man, it looks good.
Oh, the brownies that looks so delicious,
the Oreo crumble, the almonds, the pesos and all
that stuff, but you can even get big size
like this, like that's how many ounces this?
Oh, that's for the Milo.
So they have different cup for
the different foods that they get.
This one kitkat or Oreo, which one?
That's not ours.
- Oh, that's not ours awkward.
Oh, so this is the Magnum almond one.
You got literally an ice cream
in with another ice cream.
That looks so good.
And as the other one, look, Brownie's
on top mini Magnum in there as well.
Three scoops of ice cream, lots of chocolate sauce.
Oh, here's the money man.
Bank of Philippines.
Never seen so many pesos in my life.
This is the Oreo one, this one.
Ah, that was Oreo.
And that is kitkat?
Okay.
So these are one, these are our ones guys.
Time to, uh, document the process.
I think it probably will be similar.
We got Oreos, Vanilla.
And different, uh, sauces and, and
toppings on top, but that looks good.
The almond one looks delicious in hindsight,
depending on how this one looks, uh, appealingly
I made, made a mistake in getting the
Oreo, but time will tell, I don't think so.
Any chocolate and any amount of ice
cream is always a win in my books.
So I guess right now it's
just a ton of chocolate syrup.
Most of it is then filled
up with vanilla ice cream.
There's three or four scoops
in there of both ones.
So I got the Oreo one, Roy got the
kitkat, uh, and now it's all time
for the special little toppings.
So.
Uh, yeah, so Roy gets, oh,
we both get whipped cream.
Nice.
Get some kitkat in there.
More chocolate on top.
And of course, a couple Oreos or the brownies.
I love the brownies.
Can you do extra brownies for me, please?
Thank you.
if you're gonna dive, uh, diabetes,
you might as well do it the right way
with lots of, lots of brownies on top.
Oh.
And then crushed Oreos to finish it all off.
Thank you so much, sir.
Salamat. Here
we have it guys.
House of DG's, famous Oreo overload.
All right, here, we have it guys.
We gotta get through the whipped cream
first, but we'll combine that with a couple
of brownies and a bit of the crushed Oreos
Heaven?
I am in heaven.
But when the heart attack kicks in from
this, I'll be going straight to hell.
That is delicious guys.
I love the brownies.
Nothing is better than some brownies and
chocolate sauce, vanilla ice cream, all of the
above and everything that you can see in here.
That's why I asked, all the extra
brownies that I know how good they are.
And I was exactly right.
The ice cream is pretty actually like it's.
Cold and super tough to get through.
I feel like the fork, the spoon is about to snap.
Oh, it's really good though.
You can see just how cold it is.
It's actually like got steam coming off of it.
How you liking yours?
Kitkat's good?
Yeah.
Good choice?
Very sweet.
Yeah it's so sweet, it's so much.
I might eat this in one bite.
Yeah, the whole kitkat?
I'm gonna steal my Oreo
and shove it down my mouth.
I'm going to combine it
with some ice cream though.
Best choice.
The perfect wave to finish off a street food hunt.
You start off with the entree, get the
main meal, you get some halo halo just
to advertise yourself for the dessert.
And then you go a hundred percent
in to the, the lane of diabetes by getting yourself
House of DG's, Oreo overload.
What is this little thing?
It's like a chocolate.
It's a pepero.
Chocolate little stick
is it?
Oh, it's crunchy.
Wow.
That is really interesting.
Hello.
You want some ice cream?
Jumbo hotdog, kaya mo ba to?
Oh he's singing.
Oh he's doing a performance for me.
Yeah.
I don't know what I have, but
thank you for the performance.
You can have a 20 pesos.
Hey, you even get live music here when you're
eating the, the Oreo overload in, in Manila,
but oh, the brownies are the best part of this.
I reckon.
Mix it with some vanilla ice cream.
Add like some
chocolate syrup, chocolate
sauce on top of that now.
Well, maybe we have to mix.
- That would make sense.
Let's mix it up, get everything
combined and whatnot.
The color is changing.
Mm.
So thick, right?
Yeah the ice cream is so, um, so solid.
It's really hard to get through.
I stick my, like my spoon in there.
It's like almost bending.
It's gonna snap in a second and fling ice cream.
It's gonna snap and somebody's gonna have
ice cream going straight into their eye.
Hopefully not me, but it's just so thick.
Like not complaining on one thing I
will complain about is that I have
no more brownies in my, my ice cream.
I just ate them all.
So that's pretty disappointing.
We're gonna finish this up.
Then we'll make our way back, uh, to
the hotel and, uh, see where the rest
of the night entails upon us.
Guys I just found out I got Oreos at the bottom.
Right when they started, they must have
put in like crushed up Oreos.
So I was like saying to Roy I'm like,
man, I don't think I'm gonna finish this.
This is so much, but now there's
Oreos back in the picture.
I'm uh, 100
percent back in the game.
All in there, we are gonna have to
make moves shortly, because it's starting
to rain again, but we're gonna have to
eat, uh, all the Oreos in ice cream.
Before we do that.
All right, let me put you guys down.
It's hard to eat with one finger.
Oh, one hand.
Sorry.
Thank you.
What is the total price?
I'll just give you that.
The bank of Philippines needs to come back.
Look, it is everybody got free
money over here, free money.
He did have, he did have a
lot of money on that purse.
So if you are trying to plan a bank heist,
any time soon, you might just come to
house of DG and pretend you're getting an or
overload, then a quick little sneak attack.
And you're a millionaire.
Yeah that's fine.
Okay.
Thank you very much.
Have a great day.
Hello brother.
We need to go to, where do we need to go?
Sorry.
We need to, we need to go to the mall.
We go with him.
Who are we going with?
Alright, I'll let, I'll let
you do the communicating.
He's mute.
He doesn't want us.
See you brother.
I'll sit in the back.
It's more fun.
Which one?
This one?
Yeah, this one.
All right guys, the street food hunt is done.
We had some delicious food, a lot
of cheese and a lot of desserts.
I'm honestly feeling very bloated, but
we're on the back of a tricycle now.
Ooh, almost just got hit by
two cars and a Jeepney.
I've already lost a few fingers.
I can't be losing my legs.
Uh, but we're heading back to where
we parked Roy's car and, um, we're
going, oh, we're gonna finish it off.
Uh, finish off the video here, everybody.
So as always I would like to thank you
all so much for watching, chase your dreams and
we'll see you all in the next one.
Tara na!
