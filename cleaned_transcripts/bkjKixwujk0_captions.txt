Spanish period this place is definitely a whole  
different flavor for the Philippines the colonial 
era City we just don't see many of them here  
because of the earthquakes and harsh typhoon 
weather and stuff a lot of the earlier buildings  
in most the country no longer 
exists but they've kept them up here

brochure that we went to the tourist information  
center they say the architecture here 
is combined Spanish Mexicans and Chinese
be gone home
there's a supermarket there and 
wants to get it JTC Supermarket  
it's more like a snack place 
than a grocery store stainless
I like to drink this milk buy it 
too you can buy it it's more like  
a sophisticated snack like a bunch of 
snacks there's some soap here and stuff  
but not away a lot in the way of groceries 
other than no Fresh Grocers you know  
I love that huh beer brand steroids I have 
a Robinson here but I don't want to go there  
okay wow we just wake up from our naps decide 
to see this city that's how you know you have a  
good life if you're taking naps this city that I 
was wanted to visit for a long time after I know  
that they they have a town it's like a Spanish 
Colonial Town so here I miss okay we really  
enjoyed the colonial era towns and North Central 
and South America so we're enjoying this one  
nice little sitting area just outside of our room  
a lot of local artists here and 
they're featuring locally Philippines
I think moon was a famous General 
it's probably Matt family members yeah
old part of the hotel you can talk this is 
how far apart the doors are and then the new  
Hotel over there once it's famous and  
it's starting to cash in on the luninaire he 
built this thing still beautiful I suppose  
it's probably where we were supposed to 
be there's a swimming pool down there
wow very good weather today they're 
very hot which is good because it's  
not raining so we can come around to 
see outside move Sky it's beautiful
beautiful place
these places have been restored 
and some haven't all matter of time
wants to get a photo here some 
of these streets that are not yet
refurbished or our most 
interesting you want a shot here
that's the original though they will restore 
it yeah you can see the construction of  
these buildings they were built with 
brick and mortar and then uh facade  
played over the top of it 
it's Colonial air Construction
before and after before on 
your left here and after
a very busy street here and the famous one yeah
foreign
souvenir places all up and down this 
Street and restaurants bars everything
totally a tour strap but very turning  
it reminds me so much of south or Central 
America as a previous Spanish colony
the funeral home here people die even in beautiful 
places like this great artwork around here
this was a Filipino Catholic priest during 
the colonial era and he wrote and spoke  
that the Filipino priests should 
be on the same level of the Spanish  
and they I don't remember how they 
killed him but they killed him for that  
was not apparently popular with the Spanish 
crown so they have yellow tape around this Tower  
likely because we just had an earthquake here they 
want to make sure it's stable and then it becomes  
down it doesn't kill anybody and here's the 
church which is also closed for the same reasons  
the earthquake was quite a shake it was 
a 7.1 and it was about 45 kilometers  
from here photos of the front of the church 
but you can't even get near it that's smart
you can see all the damage here tonight 
anytime will be full huh yeah it's  
a serious quake and we're only 45 
kilometers from the epicenter so  
this is the colonial air church and they don't 
all stand up forever as you probably know
street food here
what are you gonna be able to get 
like more reasonably priced food  
made by Grandma you just look for 
the one with the line but just now  
to my left a lot of people waiting 
that's the one you want to eat at
foreign
we just finished our dinner and we're coming 
out and now it's getting dark so you get a  
whole different feeling for the city yeah 
the lights are beginning come on yeah
like the old town you can see but 
it's only this part it looks like  
other hair now this is very 
beautiful yeah this part yeah
