foreign [Music] to a place I'm not sure if
I can take y'all [Music] wait why am I wearing
shoes
[Music]
you see you see where I'm going today shoes
and socks will just get annoying
because I'll get sand and rocks in my shoes
[Music] so the shuttle it's up here yeah so
let's have to go up the stairs and then yeah
okay and do you think it's gonna stop raining
today all right I guess I'll have to go in
with the video okay thank you
so I don't know how the rest of this video
is going to turn out because now it is uh
it's raining
like time for the umbrella
[Music] this beach right here tamsion beats
and buttercy there's literally no one here
this is a rustic beat so we have boats out
here that look like they're owned by the locals
and there's literally no one here and the
fact that this is some of the best coral reefs
that you can actually see Marina like here
in butter Kauai right out there you guys need
to come here for that
[Music] why are you guys sitting here we're
going to the secret hidden Beach here in butterfly
let's go so this guy just saved my life what's
your name uh Alan G he just saved my life
he's about to take me to the secret uh the
secret spot [Music]
s
apparently there is no secret Beach here it's
private property don't believe everything
you read on the internet
thank you
[Applause] [Music] thank you for helping me
even though I could not find it have a good
day thank you sir so white beats is Apparently
one of the most beautiful beaches in the world
and when you're walking along this beach you're
going to get hit up with so many people saying
do you want to go kayaking do you want to
go island hopping but apparently this guy
right here this is the guy you need to come
see don't worry I'm here what's your name
we're carrying for all what are y'all
[Music] only one yes I used to live in South
Korea
almost the height of dehydration here but
the white beats here in Border Collie this
is the most popular Beach on the island and
I can see why there's a lot of people if you
want to go kayaking in a crystal kayak if
you want to catch a boat to another Island
you can do that if you want to get water so
you don't die of dehydration you can do that
but big butt we're gonna head to another Beach
that's more rustic I will say though white
beats is so long that you can find a quiet
place like right there to where you can sit
and just be free but sadly there is no alcohol
allowed on this beach there's no Cabanas there
is no chairs there's no umbrellas none of
that literally it's just the get on the sands
and kick your feet in the water
when you're here on Boracay Islands make sure
you come into some of the local parks so the
center part get away from the beaches go into
one of the stores here buy something from
the local support the economy here don't just
be in the touristy areas leave white beets
come in here like just look behind me nothing
but just nature it's beautiful and there's
no one else there's no one else here but me
and the locals [Music]
that is the reason why people come to this
beach the Leaning coconut trees getting that
Crystal Clear photo with the blue water in
the background but this beach also has more
to offer than that it's very rustic there's
a lot of boats that line the a lot of boasted
line the shore here at the beach it's quiet
it's very small there's a lot of seaweed and
sadly a lot of litter trash it seems like
I don't know if that's the tourist but if
you don't want to wait in line at that coconut
tree there is another one right here that's
the one down there that everyone goes to but
this one right here and the biggest thing
the biggest reason why people come to this
beach is actually kite surfing that looks
like he's the only guy out here but there's
a kite school that you can actually learn
um that you can actually get lessons from
here and actually go out and kite surf so
this is the last beats so this beats right
here is actually a part of my Resort so the
only way you can come to this beach is if
you're staying at Fairways here in buttercai
and honestly this is a really nice Beach when
you come to Boracay Island try to stay at
a resort that has a private beach that way
you're not fighting the crowds you're not
fighting the tourists in you can just kick
your feet up and lay in the sands so I have
a dilemma I don't want to get in the water
today I'm tired but I can't come to Boracay
Island and not go jump in the water at one
of these beaches right like I have to you
know let me go jump in [Music]
the only one here in this crystal clear blue
water today started off rough not gonna lie
it was raining and I was like just go do it
this is The Universe telling you right now
to just go for it and to just just die for
it [Music]
