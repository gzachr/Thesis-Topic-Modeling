- So today I want to show
you a day in the life
of what it's like here at
Purple Cow Philippines,
recruiting new people for our clients.
Purple Cow is one of the
companies I work with.
I know on this channel,
I've talked a lot about Delish Deli.
But really what I've been doing
for the last 12 years in general,
is Purple Cow Agency a
digital marketing agency
in California.
Which here in the Philippines,
started off as kind of the backend office
for that last year.
But then it really morphed into something
in the Philippines.
That's called a business
process outsourcing company.
I know that's a mouthful,
it's shortened for BPO for short.
But in a nutshell what
the company does is,
clients will come to us
from all around the world.
And they'll say,
we need a specific job position.
So it might be a digital marketer
or it might be an architect,
or it might just be a virtual assistant
to help somebody have
more hours in their day.
That info will come to us,
and then we'll scour the internet.
LinkedIn or Facebook ads or connections
to try to find the best
people for the job.
So normally I'm working
with my HR, Arvin, on that
and going back and forth.
Trying to find the best
people for our clients
and then presenting them
to the clients at the end
of the day.
Hoping to find a match.
So it's kind of like a
dating matchmaker only
for businesses who need
people to help them
out with their, with their business.
So anyhow, I hope you'll
find it interesting.
Follow along with us today,
as we show you a day
in the life recruiting
at Purple Cow Agency.
So I'm actually excited to
have Yuki here with us today,
he is secret camera man.
I guess it's not secret.
He is not secret, secret camera man.
Number one.
So now we've got a secret camera man
and then not so secret camera man.
But it's fun that with a new friend,
Yuki to have him along.
Helping us out with some footage today.
He's actually a great
videographer as well.
Hi Yuki!
(Yuki laughs)
You didn't see it coming.
- I try to take a photo.
- (John) Thank you, thank you.
- No problem
- More coffee.
Hey Arvin.
- Yeah.
- Mark got in touch with us
and he wants us to hire
a new virtual assistant
and a digital marketer for him.
- Is it for home base or office based?
- It's gonna be office based here.
He wants us to have someone
that works out of our Cebu City office.
- Okay, so I'm gonna ask Melanie
for the graphic design or did
he say other requirements for,
- From what it sounds like he wants us
to use our best judgment in
terms of the skills needed
for both roles,
but I'm sure that he'll clarify
that a bit more as time moves on.
- Alright, I'll post as soon as Melanie's
done with the design and do
some LinkedIn search as well.
- Sounds good, sounds good.
Okay, get back to me when you
find your first few candidates
(upbeat music)
- Hi Anna, how are you?
- Hi Arvin, am doing fine.
How about you?
- I'm good.
Can you tell a bit more about yourself?
- So I'm Anna.
I'm very passionate with digital marketing
and I actually take my masters
but during the weekend.
- How long have you been
doing digital marketing?
- So I've been in the industry
for almost six years now.
And I can say that I really love my job.
- Mm-hmm, as to the areas of expertise,
which are you very proficient with?
- I have the highest expertise in SEO
and social media marketing and everything.
- Is your role off office-based,
or are you able to work in the office?
if given the chance?
- Yes, if given the chance.
I can totally work in an office space.
- Right.
Okay, I'll be endorsing
your profile to John.
He's actually the hiring
manager for this role
and I'll be sending a zoom invite
for the next stage of interview.
- Okay.
Thank you so much.
- I started coming to the
Philippines in the beginning
of 2019.
And I got to say when I first moved here.
I didn't have my clear glasses on.
I had my rose colored glasses on
and everything was perfect here.
I thought that I entered a paradise.
The people were a 100% so sweet
and kind and respectful.
And I still feel that way,
except for maybe not a 100%,
maybe 99%.
But I got to say,
this is still out of all the
countries I've traveled to,
my very favorite place that I've been.
But when it comes to work
and when it comes to
recruiting in the Philippines.
There's so much that
I've learned and far more
that I'm still learning
about work culture here
and recruiting and really how so,
how incredibly different things are here,
compared to recruiting and
having employees in America.
Some of the differences
that come to mind is,
you know when you interview an American.
They're very confident.
You know, if you say can
you tell me about your areas
of expertise.
They're going to say,
you know I can fly faster
than Superman.
I got a cooler car than Batman.
You know, I'm more
talented than Wonder Woman
and on and on.
But when you interview
people in the Philippines.
They're very humble.
Even if they're extremely talented.
So if you say, what are
your areas of expertise?
They might say,
well actually I'm doing
search engine optimization
and I have done graphic design.
And they're just kind of
sharing their experience
but they're not really bragging
or kind of going over the
top about their experience.
Just they're just kind telling
things in a humble way.
And so sometimes it's a
little bit challenging
to know who really has those skills.
So I find that we need to do
a lot more tests in advance
to actually have people show the skills
that they have and what
they're really good at.
The other times,
it is people here or
often on Filipino times.
So sometimes the interview
starts at 9:00 am.
Maybe they might show up as 9:10 am
or maybe they might not show up at all.
And so it's kind of a way
of disqualifying people
just by their own actions
by not taking some of
these things seriously.
So I find that in both countries,
dealing in the US,
dealing in the Philippines.
There's really different things
that I need to look out for
and discern what makes
a great candidate here.
And so I'm still learning
and I'm really relying on my team here.
To give me feedback
and to help me understand
the culture more.
Like I said I'm really
very beginning student
of Philippines culture.
And hoping in the years to come,
I'll be able to do this a lot better.
So I'm about to go inside of Purple Cow
and to talk with Arvin
and to get some work done.
And I'm hoping that Arvin
will have a bit more feedback
on some of the people
that he interviewed for our client Mark.
Let's see how it goes.
Hey guys,
how's it going?
- Do you have a second?
- Yeah sure,
What do you need?
- So yeah, about the
digital marketing role
- Yeah.
- We have two candidates that's ready
for interview but there is
one that I think will best fit
for this role.
- Okay.
- I, I scheduled it for you.
It's in your calendar.
- Okay, can you tell me
how many years experience?
- She has been working for six years,
- Okay
- In the field and she is
willing to work on office space.
- Okay, sounds good.
Just send me over a Zoom link
and I'll hop on it.
- Okay.
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you.
(upbeat music)
- I have to say, I'm so
grateful for my team here
at Purple Cow Philippines.
The people that I've met
through us recruiting
and finding employees
for ourselves internally
and my other businesses,
as well as our clients here
is really been a pleasure.
There's ups and downs and mistakes
and successes and interviewing and hiring.
But overall, I have to say
that our team has been such
a pleasure to work with.
And I look forward to
many years to come working
with the team here,
working with our clients.
And I appreciate all of
you as usual for watching.
