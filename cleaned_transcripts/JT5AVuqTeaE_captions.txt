Previously we were on the island of Cebu and
after being in Boracay and Manila before that
it was time to get off the Beaten Track and
head deeper into the south of the Philippines
on the island of Mindanao I took a quick one-hour
flight from Cebu to the city of Davao my plan
was to spend a couple of days there and rent
a motorcycle and then go on a little loop
around the southern parts of Mindanao because
I'd heard that they had beautiful mountains
incredible zip lines lots of local Village
Life and plenty of opportunities to take our
experiences here in the Philippines to the
next level so let's pick things up as I am
whizzing down the highway on a crappy little
scooter with a really crappy little helmet
as we explore General Santos and the southern
area of Mindanao
there's lots of Adventures along the way in
this episode so sit down relax and let's continue
our search for Paradise in the Philippines
[Music]
okay good morning and welcome to General Santos
Fish Market but this is not just any old normal
Fish Market this place is very very interesting
let me show you around
so I've been here this morning for a while
now just sort of hanging around and checking
out how the fishermen work here and they're
very proud very hard-working guys so firstly
the boats come in and they spend about half
an hour here at the pier offloading their
catch and they can be out there for up to
six days I was just speaking to some of the
fishermen they fish out here in southern Philippines
and in the Indonesian Waters and they're catching
Marlins they're catching Bluefin and yellowfin
tuna that's where the most of the money is
as they offload the fish they carry them by
hand on their shoulders no matter how heavy
they are over here where they get weighed
and processed [Music]
and over here is where the fish are then processed
and they actually check the quality of the
fish they stick a little tube in and they
cut a slice of the tail and they inspect the
meat and they're given a score and a grade
and actually they were kind enough to let
me try some [Music] fresh tuna
wow delicious everybody here is very very
friendly very very hard working and they're
all very proud of their catch and I just love
it it's a real conveyor belt I had to rent
I had to rent trousers and some Wellies just
to get just to be able to come in guest and
I had to leave ID at security I mean feel
free to come down as a tourist they've been
very welcoming but it's a it's a legit Fish
Market here I just love it this is so much
fun
[Music]
[Music] oh [Music] so the fish market was
an absolute success really fun a great way
to meet the locals a great way to ask questions
and I really recommend it if you're in General
Santos in Mindanao just come down here early
I got here at seven o'clock okay let's continue
our adventures in Mindanao yeah a great start
here in General Santos and so I jumped back
on the motorbike and headed north away from
the city up into an area where there's lots
of mountains volcanic lakes and some yeah
some crazy zip line okay we made it to the
mountains of South kabato I think it's called
in this area there's a beautiful Lake where
I hope to find accommodation today there's
some beautiful waterfalls and a very cool
looking zip line so I think it's down here
let's explore together there's a beautiful
River
not gorgeous and in the other direction one
of the first waterfalls yeah the first waterfall
we've seen in the Philippines [Music]
[Music] wow
wow I was first waterfall together in the
Philippines
absolutely stunning
okay let's go do the zip line I hope it's
open it's 350 for two rides looks like and
300 on a weekday it's a bit cheaper during
the week
looks like you go up here
any zip line across that Gorge
gonna be absolutely terrifying and then how
do you get back because I've got my backpack
with me I haven't found a combination yet
okay so the guy told me that this is the highest
zip line in Southeast Asia and I think there's
a big waterfall so as you zip line down I
think behind you here will be a big waterfall
so it'll be a nice view
I think it's doable I think we can do it
yes I'm from England we're getting strapped
in guys straight away
this is a bit different to a normal zip line
I think we're going to be lying down on our
belly right we're going to lie down oh God
this is lay down on the floor oh okay oh God
oh God okay I mean all right these are I'm
absolutely terrified what am I doing oh this
feels really weird
we're just going straight for it are we
there whoa the highest zip line in Southeast
Asia and I haven't even had breakfast just
before we go down that crazy zip line I just
want to say a big thank you to my sponsor
nordvpn they helped me keep me on the road
they help the adventures to continue and the
production to roll on and I really believe
in this product because I use it every single
day especially when I'm traveling the two
reasons why I really love nordvpn is the first
is you can switch very quickly to a different
location so your IP is not only protected
but it's now in another geographical location
and get access to cheaper flights and a bigger
library of Netflix and Disney plus so that
when you're on the road because some countries
have limited libraries it's not the same like
it is in the UK or in the US and with a quick
few clicks you can change your location and
get your access back and it's really good
to get cheaper flights if you just change
your location using a VPN you switch a location
and a flight price can drop quite considerably
sometimes if you're lucky but the main and
most important reason to get a VPN is to protect
yourself against all of the common and security
threats that sadly plagued the internet as
a user no matter where you are in the world
more and more these man-in-the-middle attacks
fishing password attacks malware malvertising
and ransomware all of these common internet
security threats are just instantly protected
if you just have a VPN active so if you're
in the marketplace for a VPN for your travels
or for just hanging out at home and be secure
and safe then use nordvpn and they have an
exclusive deal for you in the description
below head to nordvpn.com forward slash Paddy
Doyle to take advantage of that great deal
and it's completely risk-free because there
is a 30-day money-back guarantee so thank
you to nordvpn for sponsoring this adventure
and talking of the adventure let's head back
and begin the zip line can you guys have a
look how am I tied in I haven't even been
a website left side okay [Music] okay
just try to enjoy it Superman just try not
to think about it enjoy it oh
they haven't asked me my weight they haven't
asked me anything they just tied me in
well if this is my last day on Earth I had
a good innings [Music] I enjoyed my life and
I tried my best okay
oh my God here we go [Music]
[ __ ] [Music]
[Music]
oh my God we did it
[Music]
[Music] wow and there was two waterfalls there
was one that one was absolutely terrifying
but then we had a bit of a break and we went
over the jungle and then there was a second
reveal to this one and that for me was the
scariest point because I could see the shadow
of me on the zip line so far down shining
upon the canopy and the water below [Music]
wow they just took it in their stride lesson
English English speaking English-speaking
country yes thank you okay
here we go
okay here we go you guys can have a front
view this time wow look at that [Music]
[Applause]
incredible [Music]
[Applause] [Music] I feel like Superman okay
there was actually a path after the second
zip line around to the bottom the base of
the waterfall so we can get a nice look at
it up close little family here enjoying the
incredible scenes look at the size of the
cabin here
just simply stunning and to think this is
a non-touristy place and yeah some of the
most beautiful parts of the Philippines we've
seen we're searching paradise and we found
it here for sure
foreign
[Music]
we were having a great day here in southern
Mindanao and it was time to continue and so
I got a lift away from the waterfall back
up to the start of the zip line where I got
back on my motorbike and headed towards this
Lake
yeah so part of the process of this zip line
is getting a ride back to the top because
that's where my backpack is that's where my
motorcycle is and then nearby this area there's
a lake with a with a resort we'll try and
stay there tonight
I found a resort called Isla del Punta I think
it was called and quite expensive about 50
US dollars a night but it did include dinner
which was a very local Filipino Seafood dish
with vegetables and rice and it was quite
delicious but a big storm rolled in and so
I just kind of called it a night and enjoyed
the facilities enjoyed the room and just the
serenity of this gorgeous Lake and the lotus
flowers and yeah I spent a nice night there
and then the next day again just exploring
this little area around the lake this was
a very unique and different part to the Philippines
that I had experienced anywhere else
foreign
I did want to do a whole road trip around
southern Mindanao and my plan was to do it
for three days guys three days on this motorcycle
and this was the beginning of day two and
so I drove around I tried to go to a place
called Lake hollon and failed I tried to go
to a Ridge Mountain Trek and failed I just
couldn't find these places there's very little
service so Google Maps wasn't working and
I just found the roads to be just very difficult
to drive on and my motorcycle just wasn't
good enough in England we have a saying when
we say I'm at my wit's end and I don't really
fully understand that saying but I feel like
I'm at my wit's end because this has been
the most challenging three-hour Drive I've
ever had and we've done a long a lot of different
difficult drives partly the reason is this
bike this bike is just a little twist and
go scooter thing and it's it hasn't got the
tires or the suspension the second issue is
the roads in this particular area of the Philippines
are non-existent it's flashes of bliss when
you have a little bit of tarmac but the majority
is just pebbled stones and potholes and so
the bike and the bad suspension just makes
the whole ride really on like not enjoyable
plus I have my big backpack and I'm getting
absolutely murdered by the sun I've pulled
over and put Sun cream on twice but my legs
are getting battered my arms are covered in
Sun cream but they're still getting battered
it is so hot here I wanted to take you to
the Mountain Ridge which apparently on Google
Maps is a place where you come and you park
up and you can go on a little Trek and there's
a really cool looking Ridge on Google Maps
looks really nice but it's been three hours
and I haven't been able to find it and I've
tried multiple times and I've given up guys
I've given up
hi
there's one last thing that I'm gonna try
though um there's a little bit of a gap in
the trees here we'll put the Drone up and
we'll just do a 360 because according to Google
Maps I'm right next to this place but I've
just come through a village and um no no no
no no no sign of anything so we'll fly the
Drone we'll see if we can find it [Music]
[Music] yeah
right I'm just kind of zooming around looking
and apart from it being very very beautiful
and apart from it looking Lush and green I
don't see I don't see any Mountain Ridge here
sometimes you win sometimes you lose and the
mountain ridge in Mindanao is an L for us
[Music] look to be honest I gave up my three-day
road trip licked my wounds and headed back
towards Davao because I was about to embark
on a very very cool Expedition a three-day
Trek to the tallest Summit in the country
of the Philippines a volcano called Mount
Apo it was going to take three days and I
needed to go back to Davao to get some gear
because it was going to get cold it was going
to be wet and I was Ill prepared so let's
pick things up on the first day of the Trek
as we attempt to climb the tallest mountain
of Mount Apo about five kilometers away from
the trailhead at 5am where we're having breakfast
excited dread nervous all in one so let's
begin our track
s
and up there in the distance you can see the
summit of Mount Apo the Philippines tallest
mountain a dormant I hope volcano and it's
going to be a three-day adventure and this
section of the video will document the entire
thing and I'm a little bit nervous if I'm
honest because it looks number one very imposing
the weather forecast is bad and it's going
to be very wet and very muddy oh I don't know
I'm just always nervous at the beginning of
a trail I always wonder will I make it um
everybody here there's quite a lot of people
here as well they've got a lot of gear we've
just had a big meeting I've just got a little
backpack with some water and a fleece and
a hoodie so I hope I'll survive the cold they're
already making their way so I don't want to
get left behind so are you ready we're going
to climb the tallest mountain in the Philippines
or fingers crossed let's go
next time on Next Level Adventures [Music]
thank you
to me this is Paradise we found it up here
in Mount Napo on thousand percent they sum
up a Hollywood movie in five seconds and it's
just like this shimport this ship will never
sink and then it just cuts to it [Laughter]
okay everybody's packed up and we're about
to start the cold dark climb towards the summit
it's 3am now
[Music]
thank you
